these are my only space base plates from classic space actually with only 2 plates i could not do much serious expansion with it instead i merged it with my old city baseplates and used it as a docking station for scientific purposes or restricted facilities that is guarded by the police these baseplates are very useful and is suited for creating a space command center up in the space  	positive
first what i liked sooooo much was the cover of these plates with this large picture of a classic space scene i still have a 306 misb just to keep that nice feeling of taking it out of a plastic box and look at it there were different versions of the cover though second the markings of the landing platform changed at some point id have to check it later when im at home think it had something to do with the interupted yellow lines	negative
lokix on jul 8 2008 0309 pm said why pay 350 dollars just download the instructions on buy the pieces off bricklink thats the problem the instructions arent anywhere to be found not that ive seen the set does seem to have some rare parts but i doubt 350 worth	negative
kdog on jul 8 2008 0948 pm said thats the problem the instructions arent anywhere to be found not that ive seen the set does seem to have some rare parts but i doubt 350 worth by looking at the pictures used to display this set ive a sneaky suspicion it did not come with instructions but meant for the pictures to be ideas the whole set was suppose to teach children to use their imagination giving them instructions would somewhat defeat this while trying to figure how to build things from looking at pictures would be a much better educational experience	negative
i also love these plates i build a lot with them eg this  unfortunately they are not available in bley 	neutral
year released 1976 piece count 53 minifigs 2 lego brought out floating boats quite early and in many ways the first were the best ill explain why later this set in particular is interesting as it came out in two versions one that includes the first minifigs and another that included the nonarmless type set 709 the police signs are stickers and are in surprisingly good condition considering the age of the set i am missing one sticker on the front though note the technic bush and axel they are the old type the position of the second figure is not a mistake i think hes supposed to be sitting down the first boats out by lego needed a weighted keel to prevent them keeling over i have tested this i suspect this is because of the density of the old hulls and the flat bottom but i could be wrong it cant be just because of the flat bottom as the new cargo ship doesnt need one the keel in detail the bottom extension is for a motor not included nor made by lego at the time the keel had longer studs even now it holds extra firmly this is why i prefer the old design you can extend or shorten the hulls as you please or even insert other lego in the middle you can easily add wheels or any other piece to the bottom of these hulls i wish they would go back to this idea the 4 hulls were of this concept but were too wide probably so the keel wasnt needed the old minifigs aside from having odd feet and no arms had a normal stud as the neck thus when you turn the head it tends to come off i love this set	negative
how about these policemen are unarmed	neutral

lol i cant help but smile everytime i see the quote on this thread dont worry these police are armless lol	negative
well what to say i got this boat late 70s when we were on our way to italy to spend the holidays there my parents always needed to keep my quiet during the 3day trip and the best way to do that was to buy me a lego set i got this one in a gas station in germany as far as i remember italy didnt have lego sets so a gas station close to the italian border but still in germany or austria was very often their last chance i often saw large quantities of lego sets in those gas stations though i remember seeing yellow castle and the galaxy explorer standing on a shelf it would be my birthday 13 weeks later so i always made sure they knew what to buy for me	positive
so youve been bitten by the classic bug too sinner great review but one would think arms would come in handy pun intended when you are a police officer right its a shame that many of the original figs must now be forced to stand looking like they have their hands in their pockets eh i have no idea where i was going with that last sentence	neutral
image link from brickset i thought i would do a pic review of the 1st lego castle the yellow castle 375 released in 1978 first let me say that this set was truly ahead of its time it introduced new building concepts such as the hinge and new figs most were still the armless faceless minifigs during this time this set introduced me to castle which was my first real favorite theme i enjoyed breaking it out from the garage and building it again the majority of the pieces are 1x1 1x2 1x3 1x4 1x6 and 1x8 standard yellow bricks the set also includes yellow 1x4 1x6x2 and 1x8x2 arches yellow 2x2 2x3 and 2x4 bricks various grey plates 1x2 black inverted slopes red drawbridge pieces two classic red castle doors 8 hinges 2 for each corner and a few other nifty pieces including six red 1x1 windows a complete inventory is available at peeron 375 inventory a view from the front the drawbridge is 6x8 the front tower stands 12 13 bricks high plenty of room for horses the drawbridge does work the string originally black is attached to the opposite side between a plate and the arches the right side of the castle identical to the left ive always loved the 2x2x3 sloped bricks and corner pieces the back i love these red doors a 1x4 brick attached to the other side of the baseplate keeps intruders out that banner was the original sticker piece notice the wear the rear tower largest of the towers and backside two hinges at each of the corners allow the corners to open for playability before opening open lots of arches add to the detail of the inner walls inner front this set included 14 figs how about that for quantity unfortunately i peeled off worn stickers from the shields and the breast plates years ago the blue castle guards and knights are the keepers of the castle i still think that these helmets are the best lego ever made they just look good the black and white knights and the red knights ive always prefered to use the black and red guards and flags from the knights joust sets conclusion the yellow castle is truly a classic set and im so glad i kept the pieces to this together after all these years if you have a chance to buy one or even obtain the set instructions its worth building and wouldnt be difficult to substitute grey or other colors i hope you enjoyed this review and feel free to share your comments	positive
great review it is nice to see an indepth photo review of this set i especially love the last picture of your old city it certainly does bring back memories	positive
snefroe1 on dec 28 2005 0844 am said nice review i havent built yellow castle for many years but i do remember the fun i had building it when i was young yellow castle just opened up an entire new world for me also i liked all the alternate models on the box od wish i still had that i found this pic of the inner box this evening in searching for sticker sheets with castles like this one could build a variety of mocs	neutral

theme hobby sets set name harleydavidson 1000cc set number 394 price new 260280  185200 euro price used 14175  10125 euro pieces 143 year of release 1976 links peeron bricklink and brickset looking at the release date of this set makes me remember the good old times when lego sets stayed in production and could be found in stores for long years yes i hear you younger fols say this meant we had less variety at the time but at least we did not have to go on a frenzy to get them all in just 1 or 2 years before they disappeared to reappear on the secondary market at crazy prices anyway i also realise this set is older than me by 5 years at least the first boxes of this set i think my parents bought it when i was something like 12 year old or even before as my father really liked the hobby set line and took any chance to get one you know for the kids when theyâ€™ll be old enough to play with themâ€¦ i am really happy my father did it too as a matter of fact this has always been one of my favourite nonminifigure scale sets i know younger eyes will look on it and wonder how we could love and enjoy a model like this so blocky and rough just remember this was the best tlg designers could do with the bricks available at the time enough about memories letâ€™s start with the review the box front the front of the box here cut and folded to save space shows the harley davidson 1000cc in all its glory upon a nice town landscape i really appreciate how tlg box designers used a real life photo of the model in a real life environment to give this hobby set a better background moreover the landscape does not distract the eye even with its lights since the focus is strongly set on the motorbike itself back and sides the back of the box shows the model on a more neutral background and from another angle we can see the stickers in place take a good look at them here because i did not apply them the right side we also see a pic of the set from the front and one with a child playing with it in this latter shot the model rests upon a nice black box with a harley davidson sign on it i frankly do not remember if this was some sort of tray or smaller box within the lego one or if it is meant for publicity only another thing we can notice on the rightmost side of the box is a white band right below the lego logo sporting the sign â€˜designed for experienced lego buildersâ€™ in various languages all in all a really well done and professional job contents inside this set includes a number of parts in mainly black white and light grey some blue and yellow add nice touches of colour to the total the partsâ€™ selection is not mindblowing as most of the pieces had been in production in these same colours for years anyway iâ€™d like to focus on a couple of details the milky white technic axles as well as the red technic bush old 2 are among my favourite parts the bushes in particular are quite useful to build more sturdy looking tubes than what can be achieved with the newer and slimmer ones it would seem that the tile pieces appeared in the â€˜without groveâ€™ version as a standard and in the â€˜with groveâ€™ version as alternates see bricklink inventory notice though that the box above and instructionsâ€™ below pictures all show the â€˜with groveâ€™ variety as said there are no recoloured parts in this set new pieces the few new molds used in this set are black and white slope inverted 45 2 x 2 old type with round bottom tube black technic brick 1 x 2 with hole type ii and red hinge plate 2 x 4 with articulated joint â€“ male and female the most interesting piece from this lot as many of you will have noticed is the technic brick 1 x 2 with hole type ii this kind of technic brick was use during 1976 and 1977 only it would seem tlg tried a new design variant which did not meet success and was later replaced with the standard bricks again nonetheless iâ€™m sure that people who own these bricks like them for the unusual design and the possibilities they offer into adding details to their creations instructions cover â€“ as usual the instructions are not organised in the form of a booklet but they consist of a folded double printed sheet the â€˜coverâ€™ shows again the same shot as the front of the box with bigger lego logo and set number and without the other additional information â€˜back coverâ€™ â€“ here we see the full name of the set harleydavidson flh 1200 this makes me wonder why is this set known as 394 harley davidson 1000cc when it is indeed a 1200cc anyway what really makes me love this page is the list of stats below the photo and in particular these two lines hp not given this calls for just one question why did harleydavidson not release this info my opinion is that since this is a motorbike built for the police they did not have permission to share the specifications on the motor which was probably customised either by harleydavidson upon request or by the police themselves â€˜random pageâ€™ â€“ as expected no callouts here but the build is pretty straight forward and does not need them apart for one passage weâ€™ll see later the colours are easy to tell apart in the end there is no dark grey in this set that could be confused with black again notice how the instructions include the â€˜with groveâ€™ tiles and not the older ones maybe this was changed during the long time this set stayed in production the â€˜last pageâ€™ shows other four models included in the hobby set line unfortunately i own only one of them the 396 thatcher perkins locomotive indeed i would have liked to have them all building start the handle bars look a bit too squared to me but itâ€™s just a minor feature and the overall shape is still good in my opinion notice the red hinge plate which will be almost totally hidden in the finished model see below and the blue tiles which work as indicators the first steps used to build the front wheel and windshield are really easy until you get to the wheel in facts the instructions do not show clearly all the pieces needed for it and i found myself with a â€˜floatingâ€™ wheel for the absence of one of the red technic bush old 2 on one side the one not visible on the instructions of course not a big deal but something that could have been done better motor and seat the second part of the build includes the motor seat and â€˜saddle bagsâ€™ the technique used for the motor or better the radiator is very clever to get the ridged feel tlg designers used 4 light grey plates stuck one on the other but not completely in contact this way the studs while keeping the plates in position keep them raised from one another at the same time the yellow round bricks add some details and colour touches to this predominantly light grey parts of the vehicle the use of the engine smooth small 1 x 2 side plates for the exhaust pipes while quite clever still looks a bit strange to me iâ€™m mostly used to see them in airplanes helicopters and spaceships â€˜saddlebagsâ€™ a simple build for one of the iconic parts of this motorcycle here you see them in place as well as get a look at the finished seat i like how lego designers managed to make its shape with just a few quite big bricks the â€˜saddle bagsâ€™ are a really nice touch and they work perfectly when compared to the original this is the rear wheel as said before only when you get to this passage in the instruction you get a real understanding of how the front wheel is supposed to be mounted as well careful readers will notice how this is not one of the original wheels in this set the original ones were mounted using the technic gear expert builder 9 tooth unfortunately i could only find one of them in my collection an itâ€™s used as the front wheel by adding the rear wheel which is shown from a better angle in the instructions we complete the model notice how the two technic bricks supporting the wheel are held in position by two 2x1 plates i think this was a bad case of â€˜building by compartmentsâ€™ mentality if tlg designers had considered this a bit more they would have used 2 4x1 plates instead of 4 2x1 on the other hand this is not the worst case i have seen in a lego set and they keep up the tradition nowadays too finished set front and here it is our fancy police harleydavidson indeed the front looks blocky and quite horrible to our eyes but again it was almost the best that could be done at the time i only wish they had made it a little less bulky even though this build is clearly thought to give better stability to the wheel the blue tiles work nicely to emphasise the indicators the slightly unsightly red plate is normally covered by the plate sticker and the windshield albeit being hard to see through is nicely shaped back the back side is less detailed than the front but shows the red light and antenna which are typical of the police motorbikes from this period how many times have we seen this angle in the chase scenes from tv shows like â€œchipsâ€ side all in all this model looks pretty sturdy apart for the antenna which falls off all too easily and detailed especially considering the limited variety of parts available and used at the time they even got so far to put a 2x2 tile as kickstand to display it without fear of it falling on the sides bonus images size comparison what i never understood about this set is what scale it is meant to be i mean it is clearly not minifigscale and it could not be technicfigscale those came later but it is not even miniland scale moreover the only other model with the same scale is the other hobby set motorbike as the cars have a scale of their own and the thatcher uses still another one final comments overall this is a great set for collectors of old models and motorbike fans or both it does not sport a huge variety of bricks but was a good choice at the time and even if the result is matteroffact blocky when compared to the original it implements some good solutions to minimise the lego brick appearance and maximise the similarity as much as possible design  colour scheme â€“ 910 the design is as accurate as possible apart for the front mudguard maybe and the colours are completely in line for a police vehicle the solutions and details included in this set justify the â€˜expert buildersâ€™ label and add to the appearance and why not playability of the model parts  810 not a huge selection and very few new molds nonetheless a good source of black and white standard parts for mocs and one of the few sources for the extra rare technic brick 1 x 2 with hole type ii pieces playability  910 a sturdy model which can take some serious play and swooshing without falling apart the easily detachable antenna and the lack of an appropriate scale interaction with most other models make it lose one point though build  710 pretty straight forward with few nice solutions and an already mentioned slightly obscure passage in the instructions price  510 like most older models especially the hobby set and model team ones this set can be found at reasonable prices only rarely most of the times people are asked shameful prices for such a smallish set overall 810 very good as always questions comments and pic requests welcome edited by whitefang 17 april 2011  0619 pm indexed	positive
great job on this review of a unique and rare set luxorv considering the year it was released this must have been a cool set back then even up to now with all the specialized pieces and advanced building techniques i could still appreciate the beauty of this brickbuilt harleydavidson police motorbike the various elements are instantly recognizable and it even has the unusual partlystacked plates technique for the motor overall id say this is an above average set that is a musthave for any hardcore lego collector	positive
luxorv this is an awesome review the classicness of this set is just lovely its so easy to just fall in love with this set youre review is outstanding as well the pictures are so clear and the review is just solid youve really polished your reviewing skills	positive
thanks luxor for bringing us this excellent tour round an old classic for its time this is truly a remarkably detailed and beautiful set and i think its amazing how its still in such good condition after all this time do you have any more from this era excepting the harley of course  ive created a whole new index to put them in	positive
nice review great nostalgic set like you said it has nice designsimple yet effective i like construction vehicles so this set has even bigger impact on me	positive
ah the good old daysthanks for the review yoshi648  cute and cool at the same time its interesting to see that the same front end parts had been used from the early 70s up in to the late 90s  nice again to step back in time and keep on bricking everyone 	positive
its simply amazing how far lego has come in 30 years	positive
and again those tears in my eyes with original box i really love those classic space stuff looks like i need to clean my stuff this summer	positive
indexed everyone remembers their first time for me it was in 19coughsomethingsomethingcough we were at her house and her mother was gone for at least an hour she slowly unzi uhhh sorry wrong story um yeahh anyway i do remember my first time it was 1977 in late summer our neighbor who worked for a department store called famousbahr said that the main store had a travelling lego display so my family filed into the car and drove into downtown st louis to see this display to tell you the truth i dont remember much about the display itself but i do remember that my parents bought me my first lego set set  456 the spirit of st louis set  456 also sold as set  661 name spirit of st louis theme legoland  large vehicle year 1977 pieces 49 minifigs 0 price 500 usd bricklink misb start  17500 usd used complete 3500 usd links peeron bricklink brickset packaging box front the original box that my set came in was most likely trashed 5 minutes after returning home this image was lovingly stolen off of the peeron page for this set i feel lucky that i even got this much similarly i have no pictures of the plastic baggies the set came in truth be told i cant be sure that there even were plastic baggies that the parts came in the set side view well there she is my first set ever  actually i seem to recall the real spirit of st louis was silver colored not black and yellow if you need a history lesson the spirit of st louis was charles lindberghs plane when he made the first transatlantic solo flight more details can be found on the wikipedia page the overall shape is pretty close at least the cockpit window could stand to be moved forward one stud but everything seems to be relatively close the tail piece isnt the right shape but it is likely the only tail piece lego produced at the time if you look closely you can see the various bite marks that my brother and i inflicted over the years i know some people would be aghast that there are bite marks but brick separators wouldnt come out for another 10 years besides we were young we didnt know any better i certainly had no idea that it would become my obsession there are some interesting part choices here everything is brick and plate built as you might expect the same set nowadays would have lots of slope wedges and wedge plates to round things out but lego was all about the brick in 77 so bricks are what we got the black inverted slopes worked pretty well asthetically as the wing struts the wings are simple 4 x 10 plates nice and square there were no minifigs in this set if i remember correctly 1977 was just about the time when minifigs made their first appearance i know i have one other set from 77 that does include a minifg at least i dont have a lot of comments for the following photos ill let the pictures speak for themselves 34 view back back 34 top front parts interesting pieces i have no idea if there were any extra pieces that came with this set i kind of doubt it instead i took a photo of some of the interesting parts to the model that translucent white piece didnt photograph so well but it is a technic axle 8 thats right sets from 1977 contained technic elements the two black parts are the forerunners to the 1 x 2 technic brick as well everytime i hear someone on the forums complain about technic elements in system sets i think back to this set the round brick is special as well here is a closer view of it complete with bite marks  round brick as you can see the stud is closed it is only one of two closed stud 1 x 1 round bricks that i own they stopped appearing in sets in 1981 for those that are interested the dss you thought you were going to escape this heading didnt you surprise yes even in 1977 lego sets had stickers the oldest printed elements i can remember were in the classic space sets that started in 1979 again when people in the forums complain about dss in sets i can only help think of this set and chuckle to myself maniacally the sticker has held up really well considering its been stuck on the brick for 32 years no discoloration very little curling i think if all stickers held up this well over time there would be less dss complaints the ratings playability 610  the set is quite swooshable and the propellor spins outside of that though minifigs na design 610  the overall shape is quite good especially given the era the color choice leaves a lot to be desired price 110  its been retired for 30 years its going to cost you to get your hands on it overall 1330  this set is for true collectors only i cant imagine anyone wanting one because they want to play with it it was a great set back in the day but the design feels really dated and if youre wondering mine is not for sale ever all the photos plus more can be found in the gallery	neutral

thebrickster on jul 4 2008 0414 am said a closeup of the alpha1 rocket the white bricks never stayed together well often times coming apart within your hands huh did they not think of putting a technic axle down the center of the rocket come to think of it when were technic axles invented its a neat little set makes me think i oughta make some similar kinda layout in ldd very elegant for playability	neutral
thanks for the review my favourite detail is the salad d btw could you exchange the modules and make pics of that id like to see how the building looks with the flat roof instead of the dutch style one im not sure though if the vents on the flat roof makes sense as long as its only used as a garage top  maybe they should be removable as the balconies and such things to make the modularity leading not to weird results other than this in combination with a lot of money and the cafe corner set this really could get me into city 	positive

thanks for this review and that great little comic about the skellies though xd you have to admit that besides their long arms making the skellie legs look out of proportion that theyre just made poorly theyre sticking straight out as opposed to every other fig which have a slight bend to make them look more natural also as im sure youve noticed the pegs are on angles that makes it impossible for them to hold their weapons straight and they cant even put their arms over their heads without stressing the plastic some i mean theyre dead well at least undead theyre not supposed to be stiff and personally i like the ragdoll look more it makes them seem more dead p	negative
very nice little review tis too bad im skint and cant afford any sets at the moment loved the little story too also on your comment about the skellie horses all lego horses are posed like that because its the way horses walk check it next time you can	positive
nice review and a great story also grevious this is a great set and a nice little army builder one at that the only thing that saddens me about the line itself is the new arms on the skelies they just look far to big when placed next to a normal fig for me the old versions of the skelies were far better why tlc changed to this is beyond me still i shall be buying alot of these sets just to increase my army	positive

capn slyowl on nov 8 2007 0831 pm said ive searched high and low accross england to find thisand its nowhere im too stingy to buy off sh and so ill wait my turn ok now ot the set lets say i buy 3 for 12 thats 6 soldiers 3 skellies and 3 horses considering each fig is worth 1 and horses 75p that means 25p for the catapult awesome theres no lego castle anywhere in england  argos have exclusive rigts for selling them at the moment  but you can also get them from the lego stores at milton keynes and bluewater	positive
iamded on nov 9 2007 0351 pm said it seems the catapult defence has been taken off sh for nz so i assume its out of stock for us its been off for a while you guys might want to check your countries too peace  catapult defense is still on for me but the final joust has disappeared all the sets are still in my stores though so no worry sweet batbrickismuchcoolerthaniamded away 	neutral
thanks very much for that review i downloaded the instructions last week and i was largely impressed with what was in it however like holodoc i am waiting for the bulldozer i might have to settle with the dino though if lego charge australian some absurd price edit i just watched the videos thanks they are great the dino is better than i thought edited by sinner 10 july 2007  0229 am	positive
i didnt spot this great review earlier thanks for the effort of posting all those pics and videos they helped me decide that this set is worth getting	positive
got this baby via shophome a little early and i though it was time to post my view of this set  snefroe you need to get this one   sorry for the lack of pics but there are already many pics online of this baby so here it is  best space set since a way too long time this is my first new space themed set since more than 20 years and i must say that i’m not disappointed at all i have much to say about this little gem first let’s cut it straight about the martians minifigures they are absolutely rubbish i can’t imagine how lego could produce such atrocity this said let’s move on to the dropship a real piece of art reminiscent of the aliens movie dropship the cockpit is spacious and provides a great field of view too bad there is no hinges to open it you must remove the canopy completely to switch pilot the drilling unit can be attached under the ship with the clever use of a rubber piece it stays well in place once attached good point some people don’t like the inclusion of the 2 containment area for the martians and crystal on both side of the ship but i kind like it it makes the ship less empty the 2 wings are complete with air intake some armaments and 1 standard launcher on the right wing normally i don’t like launchers but this one is very discrete and well integrated on the tail section are 2 thrusters that can be rotated and provide thus some “realistic” movements to the ship one of the last highlight of this ship is the landing gears or i must say landing dishes 6 medium sized radar dishes provide and incredible stability to the set they are quite sturdy and can take a beating i’m not going to review the alien spaceship in detail since it’s quite uninteresting i consider it more like a bonus addition to the set than anything else the look is passable and there are some interesting building techniques in it that’s all to end the review a little proscons table we all love proscons table   pros  incredible design  at last a decent space set  modular functions  quite sturdy  beautiful  great value for money cons  martians are rubbish  no hinges for the canopy  the drilling unit could use some more details score 910 by the way  i added a nice cool feature on my site  you can download the stickers for some sets that i own before building i always scan the stickers we never know it could come handy check this out on my site you need to go in the lego lists on the left vtx classic games	positive
ive got it also but i think ill replace the ball joint pieces with the kind of pieces that give the wings their angle	neutral
great review sweet maybe i will buy this one but not this month buying lego in billund has left me totally broke x 	positive
the dropships looks neat and your review is good it isnt my theme but it clearly is a fantastic set for the space lovers under us mars mission is really a good step in the right direction for tlc	positive
i already made my 5 cents to this horrible colour bastard x x x in ickelpetes thread but i wanted to clarify about this dunamis on jul 13 2007 1041 pm said finally ive never seen one of these before although someone will no doubt rattle off a dozen sets where you can find this part in about 5 seconds heres one of the sets its included in it didnt even take me 5 seconds  p	negative
thanks for the bonus review i am still on the fence with this one so every opinion is good dunamis on jul 14 2007 0741 am said but what about the atat in case you dont know the atat in the dark side development kit had a single motor and a moving head it worked by the head simply swinging from side to side due to balence shifts i suspect the atat will be same i also think that there will be no remote for it either edited by sinner 14 july 2007  1131 am	positive
thats a nice looking dino set there great review dunamis also on this side of the border see that big thing above the us thats canada where im from byob still means bring your own beer my uncle is already on his third molsons edited by lieutenant colonel thok 14 july 2007  0221 pm	positive
oh is he ugly or what ive never seen a dino that needed to go on a diet more then him d but id get him for the pieces all those limegreen pieces drools but meh im not really in to mindstorms so i dont think id get this but anyway nice review i now know exactly what hes like kml	negative
i kind of like the design of this but more importantly i really want to get my hands on the power functions motors and ir control system id prefer the 8275 technic bulldozer but theres no way i can stretch to the 100 price tag so i was thinking i would have to see if i could get a 4958 monster dino cheap in the january sales then two things happened today firstly i saw the dino in tescos reduced from 70 to 55 then my wife said shed buy it for me for christmas wow thats never happened to me before i love my wife wub cant wait till christmas now	positive
looks really nice one complaint is the back it is a pitty that lego didnt use any plates greebling there	negative
pretty good first review this looks pretty great i probably wont be getting it due to budget constraints bionicle but still very nice set to me it kinda looks like the missing link between when the atst evolved into the atat also i know the rebels stormtroopers get a lot of hate but i really like them thanks for the review	positive
awesome i am really looking forward to buy this but is it really 5000 us i was hoping more around 3000 also i was wondering how the hip section for the legs work does it have a stiff turning axis to it	positive
smitty500 on 25 december 2014  0721 am said awesome i am really looking forward to buy this but is it really 5000 us i was hoping more around 3000 i mean it fits the 10 cents per piece count and has 4 figures so for a licensed theme you cant beat that but i guess lego can never satisfy everyone	neutral
whitswj on 24 december 2014  0253 pm said here are the pics of kallus his head would be good for a steampunk character thanks indeed his face printing is really nice they captured his looks and spirit well	positive
namioik on 25 december 2014  0853 am said i mean it fits the 10 cents per piece count and has 4 figures so for a licensed theme you cant beat that but i guess lego can never satisfy everyone this is true i just had that price in mind when i saw the first images of it it did not appear to be this big or complex but new sets are getting so much more advanced than what they used to be	neutral
the legs are about 2 shorter than the atat its cockpit is a little larger than the atats head it doesnt look out of place as an escorttype walker or heavy walker especially as both are built in the same style although if scale differences really bother you the most recent atst is probably a better bet for you edited by hjmediastudios 29 december 2014  0432 pm	neutral

super outstanding review i am outside at this moment and this review is certainly great to read while you are on the move i am looking forward to get this upcoming new modular it is definitely fun to play and real awesome indeed thanks oky for this very fine review	positive
a great review of an obviously fantastic set a musthave for 2015 thanks	positive
i want more of the story you made also ace review	positive
brilliant review and thanks for plenty of detailed shots of the interior i may invest in this set but ill have to wait until 2015 star wars is sorted and budget for the arrival of pirates in april	positive
firstly great review  i was really on the fence on this one this review has greatly changed my view on this modular a definite buy for me love the interiors and the whole concept the more i see it the more i see the little features which put this set apart or at least slightly different from the others of course great playability for the younger lot and i think a nice building to give any lego city more character and colour	positive
great review oky i really love your introduction text you put a lot of effort in this review with lots of nice touches well done for me the set gets 4 out of 5 its a great set but theres something preventing me of giving it 5 stars	positive
great review oky i managed to pick this set up a few days ago and i must say it might be my favorite modular yet for the feel alone the pool hall barbershop and the detectives office itself are all wonderfully designed	positive
can you please take some picturesexplain how the water tower is built i understand that there are some tank treads bot how exactly and it is there can be only one edited by yooha 01 january 2015  0714 pm	neutral
great review the intro was great but im still not convinced on this one the height seems too small for comparison with the rest of the modulars the play features are ok but i wish it would have been taller	negative
snaplock on 01 january 2015  0740 pm said totally agree with you the height does seem rather small also 2x buildings on a 32x32 baseplate with a lots of spare studs behind the buildings are these buildings 12 studs in width it still looks great style wise however this might be a set i buy and look at it after i have built it  regret the amount of  i have spent on it 239 for us aussies  both are are 14 deep on the upper floors do is 3 studs deeper on the ground floor buit thats pretty much it cant believe how cramped the upper floors of the barber shop look weve come a long way from the wide and empty halls of cc and gg	neutral
thanks very much i love it wub  it needs tweaking but isnt that half the fun incidentally when people were calling it rhino i thought it was just a reference to captain scarlet seeing the stickers in the middle made me realise my mistake buy buy buy	positive
thanks dude this is a great set can you please take more pictures thanks	positive
seems like they infuse system sets with more technic bars must be that technic isnt selling too well and they want to educate ppl how cool technic can be p its quite apparent when even the small bike needed technic frame	neutral
this set is truely incredible a must have but this set is also incredibly overpriced n  com on its only a big vehicle  nothing really special to justify the near 100 price tag this set is clearly worth something like 65 at max look at the incredible dropship for 34 thats a good value for money y edited by mutex 15 july 2007  0457 pm	neutral
thanks for that very interesting review snefroe1 y that vehicle looks really nice with a lot of playability but too much technic brick construction for my liking it seems like theres pretty much space wasted inside of it some kind of small laboratory or a room for the crew and at least a mining toolshed wouldve been cool	neutral

yes they can hold the crystals they cant move the hands    but they do have the clawlike hand of the droid arm edit could you post some general beauty pics of the rhino and the attached craft such as front side back etc all we have of the ship is one top pic edited by mr mandalorian 20 july 2007  0518 am	positive

two of my daughters are building this as we speak i agree the design is a lot smaller than i would have liked but theyre loving it no question the figures are the real draw here and at 6 and almost five years old theyre doimg a good job building so far at least for the 46 range in my house this set is a home run thanks for the great review mostlytechnic	positive
i managed to get two sets for my twin girls for christmas and would have to agree with your ratings the anna and elsa figs are indeed excellent	neutral
isnt getting parts in new colors a good thing it is a shame there is only this one set i think tlg could make a whole subtheme out of frozen i do agree that they overuse lavender and magenta i dont see why every girl set has to have these sort of colors instead of what would be accurate to the source material 	negative
when i first saw the pictures i didnt realize that this set had so much color barf going on in it also there is a bunch of stuff that does not fit in with the movie and it is pricey the minifigures are nice but no kristoff or sven i thought about getting this but this review is pushing me towards no	negative
the review is very well done thanks i dont know the movie my key question is whether the bricks in the set will allow to build my own snowice creations now with transglitter being part of the design approach i am not so sure can those who have already bought it tell me can transglitter be used as transparent with snow particles or is it just terrible i cannot really tell from the review pic above	neutral
very nice review indeed and i also cant wait for the release of this set it will be a superb wonderful addition to the lego disney princess theme	positive
im pretty sure ive gotten other sets recently with three pieces of tape on them	neutral
thanks for the review this will end up being a must buy for my daughter	positive
great review i definitely agree the minidolls are too awesome and are definitely a musthave i love all the extra pieces from any set some of them go on my phone case	positive
bennemans on 13 january 2015  0608 pm said there is a very simple reason for the flowers and greenleaved trees you should remember from the movie it was actually summer when elsa set of the eternal winter… true but all around her ice castle it is all winter so why are there nonwinter bits in this set doesnt make sense the picnic is because they wanted a minivignette for olaf to fit into but the rest of the green and flowers dont make sense tenorikuma on 13 january 2015  0958 am said im pretty sure ive gotten other sets recently with three pieces of tape on them cool good to know was wondering but havent remembered to look when im at a store recently whitefang on 13 january 2015  0912 am said very nice review indeed and i also cant wait for the release of this set it will be a superb wonderful addition to the lego disney princess theme thanks for the fp but a lovely sweet review i thought i bashed this set pretty hard	negative
im trusting there is something else going on behind the scenes because this should have been a huge set and released in november of 2014 at the latest maybe we will see more and better frozen sets when the postchristmas consumer spending wave hits edited by m0dulo 13 january 2015  1003 pm	neutral

hinckley39 on jul 18 2007 0451 pm said sinner thanks brother and yes please take your request and stick itback in your heart where it came from x i know you mean well but i love the camp i purposely put to the batcopter and my favorite the jig is up in there because its so ridiculous and dont you know requesting me not to do it will only encourage me to do it more i annoy because i love wub i thought you would like it i am pleased to say that i didnt know that the jig is up was also a common line most of what i remember about the old batman tv show actually comes from the movie as i own that mum bought it for me i tend to put in on if i have friends over and i am drunk enough i like the darker side of batman only and thus anything that is against the idea that batman is as big a loon as the guys that he hauls in i dont like joel schumakers movies fall well within that category hinckley39 on jul 18 2007 0451 pm said the crow is my favorite part  im happy to be swaying you over to the side of minifig suffering  it sucks that your pricing is so different over there perhaps if youre a good sinner  santa will bring you some evil pumpkin heads for christmas or whoever brings you presents over therea magical wallabee flying a didjeridoo i presume p santa brings presents here in the middle of summer in full winter rig he is a hero at least he can come down chimneys here without being burnt p  but i am not too badly done by i should be buying some more nonlicensed lego goodness tomorrow	neutral
when i first saw pics of the biplane i wasnt sure if i liked it or not but after seeing it in more detail i gotta say i love the thing wub its a great plane with so many good aspects its also the perfect counter vehicle for the new batplane for me though the best part of the set has got to be the new pumpkin heads those are just beautiful and i cant wait to get lots of them	positive
great review funny as allways the comic was just a hell lot of fun it really had me laughing i would love to have this set but the price is just to high here far worse than i had expected ill be better off buying the battank which is much better priced actually there is almost no price difference between the batcopter and the battank here wacko	negative

sinner on jul 19 2007 0415 am said sorry due to my convoluted sentance structure you misinterpretted me i meant that joel shumakers movies fall well within the category of being against the idea that batman is as big a loon as the guys that he hauls in just to be sure i hate x the joel schumaker batman movies thank you for clarifying we can still be friends now people are entitled to their opinions but the opinion that the joel schumacher batman films are any good is just wrong and stupid p sinner on jul 19 2007 0415 am said ill get back to you at christmas it is possible i made a mistake yes i also wrote to lego about it and i posted their reply thanks for the link i was too lazy to search	neutral

out of nowhere this set appeared at my local tru hadnt been expecting this one for a while so a nice surprise sweet firstly the box nice pic on the front good selection of minifigs the officer and pilot look cool with their dark blue trousers a new r2 unit as well dont remeber this in the film but great to have one in a new colour wub back of the box shows some of the ships nifty features first thing you notice when you open the box is the awesome selection of bricks this makes a for a great parts pack loads of unusual red and dark red pieces its so refreshing to see a star wars set that isnt predominantly grey there are also two instruction booklets as soon as you open the first booklet you hit an error why would i want two obiwans  its also at this point that you come across a big disappointment on the box you get a flesh quigon what is actually in the box is an epiii obiwan come on lego  why change it  all the figures look impressive in the flesh despite the big mistake once i started the build it progressed rapidly red pieces seem to be a lot easier to find lots of clever techniques quite a few technic elements get used at the start it reminded me of building a technic set from the 80s at times here is the main body half way through the build the landing mechanism is a nice touch its not fully retractable but still folds away nicely you find the ship keeps tipping over as you build it despite the feet as its only at the end thay it all becomes evenly balanced at both ends here the feet are extended you can also see the yellow knob that rotates the radar on top of the ship landing gear up viewed from the front here are the radar a great collection of dishes they spin easily with little friction here is the ship at the half way point the front works well with the top flipping up to squeeze in the pilot more to come 	positive

brick miner on jul 31 2007 0746 pm said as for the set the thing that jumps out at me most is the use of dark blue for water im so used to seeing the classic blue for water that the dark blue seems weird i dont like it  bm indeed i only noticed this when i saw the sh images i guees that theyre on dark waters you can always put some trans blue and trans clear 1x1 round plates no i tried that technique to make the lava using trans red and trans orange plates it looks neat regarding the human soldier thing yoda mentioned its quite weird like him im going to swap the legs so theyre coherent with the soldiers from the other sets third note is it just me or did you attach the two black gate pieces too high shakar	neutral

ok here is the set alot of us star wars fans have been waiting for the 7666 hoth rebel base wub first the box now the great minifigs that stunning k3po fig now the snowspeeder aaaaggghhhhh these parts are all stickers now for the turret the 2 cones on the side press in to fire out 2 blue lights saber blades d now for the small crane thingy yes the part under the engine on the snowspeeder is another sticker 8 echo base well the front door anyway d  the main control room d again these are stickers on a tinted clear panel and on the slope  i have no idea what this is meant to be d finally 2 shots of the full set wub well over all i really like this set and think it is great value for money the minifigs alone would set you back more than the cost of this set the build time was a good 2 hours or so and was good fun the snowspeeder is not as good as the second snowspeeder and no where near as good as the first in my opinion but i did love that first one the k3po fig is perfect and it is good to be getting more droids that arent r2d2 and c3po it is a shame about the stickers but that is the price of keeping the cost down i suppose the only printed part in the whole set is the snowspeederxwing windscreen i will definately be getting atleast another 3 of this great set 910	positive
thanks for the review mutley777 on aug 2 2007 0237 pm said i have no idea what this is meant to be d thats to put the snowspeeder on there should be a 2x4 plate underneath the snowspeeder that fits in that gap	positive

great review i see now why the b model is so popular i wonder though on the car if instead of the panels for the rear spolier or wing if they could have used studded panels and maybe layer them to give the appearance of ie a three element rear wing i wont mention the front lights if i had the money i would buy it for the b model h	positive

i think this set will be my next purchase i love the color scheme and indeed it looks like a nice set also 1200 parts for eur 100 is not a bad deal and yes the looks of the car have really grown on my since the first official pictures appeared im curious how the bright green will work combined with other colors than white i really hope more sets in the future will use the color so that more different parts will be available over time i think im the only person on eurobricks who doesnt like the looks of the b model but i appreciate the extra functionality it offers besides the set itself i think this is one of the best reviews i have read in a while great job on the superb photographs which i think are essential to a review and the extensiveness of it all you really touched every subject which is great d	positive
i think i read somewhere that the us will not get this set or the motorcycle until august 2015 that means the flagship most likely wont be in august but even later in the year nothing bricklink cant solve though	neutral
this is a mega review youve taken the right pictures and the video demonstrations of the mechanisms really help get the good points of the set across whats more amazing is that the review still feels very concise and to the point youve actually convinced me to put this set on my list and not just as a decent parts pack lasse d on 12 march 2015  0847 pm said  the front shouldnt open like that  instead it should be easy to remove the whole front cover leaving the suspension easy to work on  the aero seems to be realistic except for the rear end where theres no indication of a venturi channel this should have been easy to include  there is no fuel tank nor fixed fuel connector right behind the cabin  there are no air jacks seriously this is one of the most unique features of a race car like this and lego forgot about them instead they automated two functions which are manual on a real race car  the top cars at le mans are hybrids with ingenious systems i would have loved to see the front wheels connected to some kind of spinning apparatus indicating a kinetic energy recovery system im not sure air jacks are the feature that will have people fawning over this set and pneumatics are being covered rather well later in the year  but i agree with everything else most notably removable front and rear bodywork the removable engine cover on 8674 would be a good starting point here and the inclusion of some nod towards a hybrid system its also worth remembering the preliminary design did have the big honking fin bhf that is mandatory on all current prototypes so maybe when that was removed any trace of a tunnel or diffuser went with it on the subject of steering wheels all modern prototypes actually have left or right hand drive the regulations demand that both lmp1 and lmp2 cars are nominally capable of seating two people of course in practise the extra seat is taken up by the hybrid system in lmp1 and electronicsextra cockpit access in lmp2 however this doesnt change the fact that it would be easy to link the steering wheel to the hogfront axle edited by jay psi 12 march 2015  0955 pm	positive

i have been waiting for this set since the pictures for the toy fairs eirlier in the year and i am glad to say i am not disapointed first the price it is not cheap at 9999 but i guess that is typical for a set with this amount of electronics in itthere is no parts count and i have not had time to add up the 2 pages of contents to get a figure first the box standard flip top with large internal picture and rip to open lid inside there are no numbered bags in this set which i prefer i like to open all the bags and put all the parts in the box before building next is a picture on the electronics 2 xlmotors as lego describe them and 2 standard motors 2 ir receivers and 1 ir transmitter i know these have been discussed before but i really like the thought that has gone into the transmittersreceivers each receiver has 2 outputs to corespond with the 2 controls on transmitter they also have a choice of 4 channels so one transmitter can control up to 8 independant motors by changing the channel switch the transmitter also has a neat motor direction switch so you can configure the transmitter operation the set comes with three manuals 1 is the main drive mechanism 2 is the cab and engine and 3 is the attachments front and back there is also the now standard parts list in the back of the third manual there is no alternative model instructions despite the pictures of one on the box however there is a reference to the technic website on the back of the box but at the moment the page only has an advert saying the set is to be released on 1st september so i guess i will have to wait untill then to see if the instructions will be online the build is fairly straight forward the main chassis is studless the next picture shows the motors mounted into the chassis and the drive for the shovel and claw it also shows the v6 technic engine this next picture shows the ir receivers mounted on the back the battery box slots into the back and can be easily slid out with the removal of two pins which is useful because i can imagine i will need to change the batteries on a regular basis the next 2 picture are of the completed model overall i was very happy with the finished dozer the functions work really well and as i have the monster dino i have used a second transmitter so i dont have to touch the channel switch i have included some video on my brickshelf page unfortunately this set does suffer from some quality issues for example moulding marks on the plates colour diferences some of the pins not finished properly some pins were very stiff and quite hard to push into the holes but the worst issue was an axle that would not turn freely in a hole which just adds extra friction into the system i am glad to see some studded technic in this set i much prefer sets that use both varieties of technic beam there are only 2 fairings which is a great improvment over recent sets if tlc had tried to make the bulldozer shovel with fairings this would have been a complete disaster marks for the set 810 for price with the number of motors i expected it to be greater 910 for fun my kids love this type of set that does something when finished 610 for quality tlc really need to work on this one 810 overall i would definately get a second one if i see it in the sales feel free to post questions but i will be on holiday next week more pics and videos available here	positive
ickelpete on aug 2 2007 0845 pm said the treads are dark grey i not too good with naming colours the treads are the same as in the snowmobile set released earlier in the year they are a hard plastic thanks you have proved yourself strong enough for the dark side	positive
thanks for the review it really looks cool too bad its soo expensive  i must admit that i prefer the 8421 mobile crane for more or less the same price the design is more sexy wub	neutral

ickel thanks for that awesome review it makes me want to buy this set i think itd go just swell with the mobile crane the fact that it has all the motors and such is awesome i can foresee using those for a lot of other functions for mocs and well im a fan of treads you can never have enough treads d hm would you be able to tell us perhaps after a test or two what kind of weight this beast can push around thank you	positive

i have sooo mixed feeling about that i loved the simpsons house save for the terrible wall in the homer and marges room but this so far is inferior in almost every aspect the walls made of panels is a bummer i expect a d2c set to be better that this 60 stickers the same thing same price for less bricks and smaller build then the house strange coloured bricks on the outside wall some ugly mix of yellow  tan panels again with their fronts facing towards the inside of the shop so we and up with those squares all around the walls are yellow this was so nice lost opportunity to make it in some other less common colour then again the set overall looks is good the roof is a nice detail the shop looks actually like a real one not just an approximation of one the roof tiles are in dark orange  we got newrare colour here the car looks interesting to build just like the pink one from the house lots of nice references to the show its the simpsons definitely a must buy but for a discounted price ill try to find one with maybe damaged box or afterdisplay copy edited by mestari 14 april 2015  0115 pm	negative

did anyone else have a problem with the piano against the wall of the simpsons house it just kept coming off way too easily and i was getting really frustrated with it sticking out and not fully going on so i had to put the two tiles that hold them one place over away from the wall for it to sit properly without falling out i think i might put snowball ii behind it since cats love to hide underneath or behind things lol but just curious to know if anyone else was encountering this problem with the previous set	positive

yes my spongebob fans its time for another review  lets look at our bikini bottom map and head strait to meet miss puff at her boating school she is waiting for us to give us a guided tour of her establishment  another bit of sb history this set comes from the following episode boating school spongebob fails his boating test for the 38th time what a freaking retard lool hes so determined to get his license that patrick decides to help him he implants a walkietalkie inside sbs head in order to cheat and tell him what to do you will say that i am biais but i really enjoy building this set and i really like the sb theme  lets hope 2008 brings more of that cool spongieness  but i digress here are general pics of the instruction booklet and the dss g there are loads of crappy stickers in that one also  as you can see the set is divided in 3 polybags shamelessly but nonetheless wilfully hehe i will disregard the third one which is that playability crap course  i would have reviewed it but since it involves stickers i didnt want to ruin the parts and without stickers it would look dull plain and ugly it does look crappy with so imagine without so that review will not be 100 complete and i do apologise in advance but how many of you would have build that and keep it hehe off p 1 mfs and extras i will start with the really cool miss puff wub the fig mind you  she looks a bit stressed  no wonder that sponge menace will bring her to the hospital once again hehe as you can see that mf comprises 3 parts the small blue 1x1 round and the 2 major parts yeay another great stupid looking sb i love those idiotic faces  3 different sb figs and 3 idiotic faces hehe you never can get enough of them  here is just a regular patrick too bad patrick doesnt have different expressions  the pull back boat car nothing really to report except the fact that i left it sticker free  the only thing i built from the third polybag is that pretty cool ancker holding tower thingie  looks great in a lighthouse set hehe yes the roud tile bouey is printed  its the same as in sbs bed in the bikini bottom set  ok its time for those two great buildings the lighthouse and the school  pontoon  before reviewing them individually here is a general pic 2 the lighthouse one of the main reason to own that great set  sure it suffers from accute stickeretite sad but d  t worst is that door but nonetheless a great and simple building  great whitered colour scheme and a really fantastic 2 turning lights  i really like the yellow top of the lighthouse it adds to the comic atmosphere of that theme instead of having a more plain redwhite only the rear has nothing really fancy except tools to fix it in case of problems hehe the only thing i modified since i didnt build the third polybag is that i got rid of the trechnic parts on the right of the lighthoue to replace them with regular logs all hail the tower king  d 3 the school and pontoon i really like that little building and its great to see that once again tlc uses the amazing dark blue color  its really a simple design but looks fantastic and can be used for many things in a town hehe i also really like the combination with those dark bluish grey slopes  the rear reveals the desk stickers on the wall doh  and two clams serving as chairs really like on the show its really great to see that tlc stays really as close to the show as possible the pontoon again is simple yet really cool and effective and its really nice to have 2 lifesaving boueys the only thing i modified since i didnt build the third polybag is that i got rid of the trechnic parts in front of the pontoon to replace them with regular logs on the overall i think its really a great set  apart from the crap stickers i think tlc should have ditched or simplified the third playability polybag to lower the cost  oh well parts are always usefull except those one part shitty palm trees  so until my next review i bid you farewell my spongebob fans  and i really hope to see next year hehe will sb get his drivers license one day  for the sake of bikini bottom lets hope not  no license ever on  yoda	positive
thats really a great and overall nice playset with a very cool mrs puff and a fine new spongebob sweet the boating schools indeed very nice with a beautiful color scheme and so is the lighthouse im really tempted to buy a second set just to complete these buildings although its a little too expensive for doing so and it wouldnt even fit with the style of the other sb sets xd wet highway to the poor puffer fish privat hell on d	positive

great review as always y lego is timeless so there is no such thing as an old set i never build brick monsterscreatures but this set had such a nice assortment of parts that i had to pick a couple up as they werent clearancing out on shop  home i absolutely love dark orange and tan so it was an automatic win i love the use of familiar characters in the review i can almost hear hinckley screaming my megabloks p you sort of look like youre planning some vulture stew though might have to start a new challenge to determine a winner there sinner and his big pot o doom vs giant vulture only thing is does everything horrify the mrs she seems perpetually shocked andor dismayed at the goings on here now that i think about it i can see why im occasionally shocked andor dismayed 8 brick built beasties on y	positive
thank you for the nice review sinner i also bought this set but in combination with 4883 when it was on sale 50  hurray at sh i made a short review of 4883 but wasnt really sure what to tell about 4884 so im glad you did that for me d i have different feelings about this set on the one hand i love the lion he is really impressive even my wife not known for being lego enthusiastic asked me if there were more animals of this kind the lion is  restricted  poseable and the colors used are fantastic wub 3 models can be built simultaneously  thats great on the other hand i still dont know what to do with these rotation joints wacko and the other models are somehow disappointing compared to the lion i seem to have missed the little lizard  i put it on my to dolist like all the creator sets great parts pack  but wait until they get on sale xd for me  i had a lot more fun with 4883 indeed roarrrr on 	neutral

yesterday i went to toys r us and bought the dilophosaur ambush beside that the shop had a display of the jw polybags for €349 i picked up two of them now here is my little review of this pretty nice set first some data line jurassic world year 2015 pieces 29 price €349 packaging polybag ok lets start with the polybag itself it is a standard size and had plenty of room for all the parts the front depicts the whole set with a little hexagon on the right with a seperate picture of the dinosaur and its name in this case the celophysis is called gallimimus weird choice next is the instruction sheet it is a doublesided paper with every building step in clear sight the part selection is nice there are only a few but all of them are pretty usefull for all kind of builds there are two parts which stoodout both are printed tiles the first one is the yellowblack warning tile in 1x4 you cant have enough of that the second one is a 2x2 tile with the jurassic world logo on it thats pure awesome the bigger sets seem to have only sticker for that so this little set is a perfect way to get hold of this nice tile the leftovers nothing special here is the complete trap it is a basic build and functions pretty well in the end the parts are more interesting as the build so it will definitely end up as a partspack now on to the star of this bag the celophysisgallimimus i dont know why lego decided to call this dinosaur mold any different but i think it has to do with movieconnection and the will to not produce a new mold nevermind this figure is great and the colour is very bright and totally stood out pretty beastie a comparison between the 2015 gallimimus and the 2012 celophysis the final set in all its glory final verdict it is a great little set the parts used a nice and usefull the printed tiles are the secret stars of this set and the dinosaur is fun two with a few packs of these you could easily build a celophysis pack with lots of jurassic world signs on their way highly recommended	positive
great review man really well written and structured hoping to go on a hunt and see if this is available in uk stores soon	neutral
a terrific very comprehensive review  but im not at all impressed with this set it feels like a mishmash of bricks with no clear design aesthetic and as such blatantly underdeveloped ie designed to hit a pricebrick count point rather than provide a solid set in the creator town tradition compared to other creator sets at this price point 31025  mountain hut for example it feels utterly uninspired and ugly edited by johnny6666 04 may 2015  1002 am	negative
reviews for this set really should picture them next to the bike shop  cafe which its intended to be compatible with right down to the size of the baseplates and grey tiles around the edge it doesnt look that great on its own but if you add the two sets together you get something that begins to look like a street scene	positive
andy0306uk on sep 13 2007 0136 pm said really hope they do different themes next year but not sure how theyd managed 24 different minisets for castle can envisage 78 minifigs but what else yeah i guess this would need a little more out of the box thinking than tlcs doing usually for their castle line things that are similar to the city theme and more civil life based like some blacksmith equipment market place bakery farmer and so on but a wizard workshop a hidden treasure and some medieval furniture would also work fine and an evil santa with spiders and coal pieces as gifts and a sledge pulled by a dragon of course d	neutral
ive never been fond of these sets but still buy them every year because my daughters like them i am however looking forward to the belville advent calendar which likely will have some parts that usually are quite hard to get in it my girls will love it and i love all the belville parts httpshoplegocomproductp7600 if anyone has pics of what is contained in this set i would love to see them	neutral
thanks andy for the review i prefer the city advent calendar 2006 a lot those mini sets are nor good for me the road subtheme sets are nice but the others not so good the 05 version waf ok the 06 version was better with bigger sets and more building ones and the 07 is poor its just 23 pieces to put together on 2x4 plates where are the gardening accessories where are some nice small constructions that you can put in your layout like a mailbox or an orodator and the chrismas tree looks x imo and no santa y for andy n for this calendar	negative
930 euro is msrp here in denmark 7 euro would have resulted in a nicer reception from my part but the strong marked position of lego in its homeland together with the general high prices because some of us are supposedly rich makes the prices less bearable it is funny you should mention germany i thought the prices for lego were even higher there im sure i paid more than msrp last time i bought lego from from your country on the other hand the last thing i bought was the 5521 model team sea jet from 1993	neutral

i couldnt find a review of this wonderful set in here so here it goes i got the set for msrp 180kr  24 euro which is a fair price here in denmark as all other creator sets there are instructions for several models 3 in this case the box the box is a little larger than city sets in the same price range the primary model is shown on the front while you see the secondary ones on the back what you get 312 pieces in 5 polybags and two building instructions one for the primary model and the other for the rest the built it was impossible for me to speed build this model because of the nifty functional details from the retractable landing gear to the wings that can turn by means of the handle in the back of the model it took me a full hour to build it because i had to test how it all works together the finished model the landing gear isnt fully enclosed when retracted and the models are subminifig scale but i still love the design of the models the doors for the rear wheels open as you pull the wheels down and the final piece of functionality comes from the wings that can either tilt the horizontal stabilizers or have elevators wing in wings out wings in wings out ratings as a whole i actually like this set even more than the big rig the models are just as diverse but the added functionality makes the plane more fun to play with than the rig price 710  a good price but not a bargain as the big rig design 910  there could have been a sligtly higher level of details in the main model but all models are really good looking and i especially like the design of the hovercraft functionality 1010  i guess you could ask for working rudders opening cockpit and so on but the plane is really filled with movable parts and the turning of the wings works really well secondary models 710  a hovercraft how awesome is that if only the last model was just as inventive instead of a standard helicopter modifiability 810  the bricks are in ordinary colours and there is a good variety of them giving you plenty of possibilities for mocing you can easily make the main model into something that looks more like an f14 910 probably as good as it gets for a creator set in this price range it is entertaining to both build and play with looks good and the secondary models are worth building as well brickshelf gallery	positive

3499 is not too shabby the big guy itself is nice but the gem of the set is the mech really nice mech i must say great for posing the mini figs suprisingly nice little buildvehicle never seen this element beforeits probably nothing new though lol no articulation of the legs nooooooo phew the front two legs do articulate would of been bad if they didnt overall i give the set 7810 not the best but its actually quite nice and the yellow mech is awesome if it was him on his own then 9410 cheers	positive

overall i wish marvel in particular would have more playsets in its theme batman has several great ones in the dc theme but then again if this is the best playset to date for marvel maybe its better just to leave well enough alone i would definitely like to see them attempt something in the 100 us price range because i think it could be good marvel needs an equivalent to the arkham asylum set regarding this set i saved myself some money and bought the 4 minifigs i needed all but spidey on bricklink for less than half the set price edited by dmarvin 17 september 2015  0625 pm	neutral
personally i thought your review was spot on and i very much enjoyed your tone im not usually much of a minifig person but i will admit i bought this set mostly for dr doom and considered nova a bonus growing up i was a big fan of the fantastic four and an even bigger fan of dr doom i hope that someday the film rights will revert to marvel and well finally get a ff film that respects the original source material and features a dr doom worthy of the name as for the set itself i dont have much use for playsets not that theres anything wrong with them i think the marvel lego line could use more of them in fact and i didnt even realize it was linked to a specific show as ive fallen a bit out of touch with the franchise of late i bought it i built it it sat a shelf for a while i scrapped it for parts i think most of it wound up as a greenhouse for my winter village setup its not a bad set but i think you summed things up nicely when you called it mediocre thanks for the entertaining review	neutral

thank you for the review sinner at first i wanted this set for the 4 blue 1x1 slope tiles but i can see there is much more into it than that it sure is a great value compared to what you get in the building bonanzas no cars and less detail it was funny to see the little side story in your pictures would it be hard to modify the cars to fit minifigs better	neutral
a beautiful and humorous review with very fine pics y a fantastic set full of neat details and in a wonderful color scheme great for every city builder for sure i guess we waited for sets like that we dreamed about them im glad we got them now  edit congrats it seems youve got your bucket back p	positive

thank you very much for the review sinner i definitly wub this set this will make a great addition for us townies i thought the size was too small i plan to make my house fit practically the whole baseplate plus i will definitly add floors that looked d  i cant believe tlc skimped on the floors	positive
i too have bought this set and the only thing i notice which is a bit odd with the exception of there being no floors in the house is the lack of a steering wheel in the car	negative
thanks for the review sinner i definitely want this set now the mixed rough and smooth roof bricks would annoy me on a model like the mtt but here it looks as is if the roof is quite old with some parts being worn and pitted and some parts being replaced with new roof tiles i quite like the effect i agree on which is the best vehicle and if it doesnt fit minifigs just mod the heck out of it xd	positive

i actually bought this set last monday as it was reduced to 1499it actually not a bad little set considering the size and part count has a decent array of functions its a nice little setthe b model looks just as good so i might buy a second set as you get the bucket left over and i need that bucket for another set edited by richard dower 19 october 2015  0442 pm	positive
remember when i said in my review of 7090 to expect a review after i went to toysrus well somehow things didnt work out but fortunately im finally reviewing my latest purchases starting with 7091 catapault defense which happens to be one of the best sets in the castle line the box and instructions lego box art is at its highest point ever these days with lots of special effects and great action poses the castle theme is no exception and 7091 isnt either ill let the box speak for itself i love the back of the castle boxes as well since they give another action scene and other neat info like a layout of all the accessories the contents only the bare essentials as usual piece bags and instructions i seriously wish they still put mini catalogs inside sets like they did when i was young but i guess they are too expensive to make or something ah well cant have everything no picture of the instructions this time but since that isnt necessary ill just say that they are fine and do not have a problem with distinguishing dark gray from black the pieces heres your basic shot of every piece included minus a few extra pieces like an extra viking horn and black skeleton leg not too shabby for a 10 usd set theres a lot of nice pieces in 7091 as you can see and this doesnt include the accessories or minifig parts the brown plates wheels and spoked things are always useful and the dark blue and gold slopes are really cool however theres also a fair amount of technic in here so be warry as usual for the castle line 7091 has a heaping helping of accessories most of them are old pieces recolored but the ball on chain whats the actual name could someone tell me and the shields are brand new i actually like the new skeleton weapon since its fairly detailed and was really the only way tlc could make a part like that and yes the shields are printed quite nicely too if i do say so myself plus you get viking horns always useful to have a grey boulder a basket and 3 helmets not a half bad deal eh oh who am i kidding  its awesome minifigures ah yes one of the highlights of any castle set you get 2 soldiers and 2 skellies this time all with different weapons the two soldiers are just regular crown troops with different faces  nothing special except that they are awesome anyway the skeletons on the other hand are much more interesting an archer and a black skellie archers cool of course but i know many dont like the printing on the black skeletons well let me say that i dont mind it so much the only real problem is that the eyes are dark red instead of just red which makes the printing a bit less noticeable and ive been through it before that the new skeleton molds in general dont bother me at all  go skeletons the finished set alright theres two builds in this set and ill start with the smaller the skeleton barricade okay so its nothing special but its cool all the less the shield on the front and the slanted spears are nice touches heres just how the skeletons can tower over their own barricade with a little step ah the catapault the lovely catapault seriously i love tlcs design very effective and also very realistic especially compared to kk love the side details and the swiveling base and you gotta love the clever use of that basket playability yes ive made it a tradition now to write stories for any castle set i buy and this isnt the last one you can be sure of that heres one featuring everything in 7901 oh and heres a small ship i made out of all the pieces in this set plus a couple extra figures and weapons from my copy of 7901 not half bad imo considering what i had to work with overall rating presentation 910 pieces 810 minifigures 910 finished model 910 playability 810  final score 8610 once again i highly recommend the reviewed set castle is possibly the best theme this year and this set is one of many that prove it as with all castle sets its best if you buy several if you want to truly enjoy it but this set alone is also impressive in both design and pieces and minifigures get at least one if you have even a slight liking for castle edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0131 pm	positive

sinner on oct 13 2007 0248 am said great review sweet i wasnt aware that the catapult rotated either this set isnt on my buy list though as it is all more of the same for me thanks for the cool moc d i always plan to add a moc to my reviews but i always run out of time  true there are too many catapults already and in my opinion some with a better design as well but my lack of interest in this particular set doesnt reflect at all on my opinion of this review which i enjoyed very much please continue making great reviews like this one grevious y	positive

hobbythom on 29 november 2015  0407 pm said great review you almost make me want to buy one i dont know what it is with these sets on the one hand they are so nicely designed and cute on the other side i never seriously consider buying one i cant explain what it is that holds me back a lack of money maybe thats the thing that usually holds me back anyway i have the older version so i am not interested in this set	neutral
thanks for the excellent review unfortunately it only highlights how minimal the upgrades are though they are nice definitively a pass for me lets hope lego does continue to make the more realistic winter village sets versus santa im not opposed to a rehash the post office could use some improvements for example but this one is just a wee bit minimal	negative
oky on 02 december 2015  1249 am said i dont think that would be a realistic option as that would mean that they would have to spend twice the resources on this theme which i dont think they are ready to do but if more people would like this option i can add it to the poll i know but one can always hope cant one i hope the wv theme will be continued in coming years with new sets but given santas workshop and this rerelease i dont get my hopes up too much time to get mocing and reverse engineering	neutral
i didnt own the original toy shop so i bought it this time around i just finished building it saturday and i love it however i wish they had both rereleased this one and came out with a new addition to the village 	positive
review  42044  display team jet introduction the smallest of the 2016 sets is the display team jet it doesnt seem to have lots of functionality but maybe the landing gear is retractable this set kind of reminds me to the 9394  jet plane although its obviously a lot smaller as you can read in my review of the 42052  heavy lift helicopter basically anything flying is 1 for me so lets find out if this set also fits the bill note all images can be clicked for hires versions set information number 42044 title display team jet theme technic released 2016 part count 113 box weight 193 gr box dimensions 154 cm x 138 cm x 59 cm set price msrp € 999 price per part € 0088 links brickset bricklink the box being a small set it obviously comes in a small box the display team jet is an aerobatics jet used in air shows on the box its flying rather high but at least its at a safe distance from the crowd front side shows the main model together with a small section indicating you can use digital building instructions to build this model back side the back side shows the bmodel a stunt plane and again a reference to the apps for digital building instructions more on the stunt plane later content of the box the box contains 2 instructions booklets a and bmodel 1 sticker sheet 3 technic liftarms 2 bags instruction booklets both the instructions for the a and bmodel are included in the box sticker sheet a lot of stickers for such a small set apparently no panel is left untouched liftarms three liftarms unsealed nothing out of the ordinary for a small set bags two bags containing the rest of the parts highlighted parts this section describes the new andor otherwise interesting parts yellow 5l axles the 5l axle in yellow has never been released before so its one of the new parts for this year black 7l flex axles for the layman this seems a common part but the 7l soft axle actually has never been released in black before combined with the rerelease of the 19l soft axle in black this will open up lots of possibilities for those of you thinking youve read this text before you are right the new drag racer contains these new 7l flex axles too white panels this small set comes with a whopping 10 panels great for the ones who like panels not so great if you think tlg is using too much panels lately rudder this part the small bionicle wing is the same as the one used in last years 42033  record breaker part list this set contains 113 parts all listed below the build this is the collection of parts used to build the jet it sure looks like we are getting a landing gear the build is fun but pretty straightforward there arent any special or cool techniques used in this set it almost took me more time to apply all the stickers than to build the actual model finished model the finished jet does look cool though the white and yellow color scheme combined with the stickers work really well i have seen people refer to the plane as being orange but its definitely yellow technic or lego in general tends to have some color variation when it comes to yellow i do concur this is the warmer variant of yellow but its not orange the back of the plane looks nice too although i am not a big fan of the rudder part it looks too detailed compared to the other panels its not a big deal though and maybe its just me parts left only three common parts left features and functions this set has a single feature and that is a retractable landing gear its operated by the black 12t double bevel gear near the cockpit in the following picture you can see the landing gear retracted this image shows the landing gear when the plane is ready for landing hopefully the pilot will roll the plane before landing but you probably know what i mean video heres s short video demonstrating the display team jet bmodel this set also includes the building instructions for the bmodel a stunt plane the building experience for the stunt plane is more or less the same as for the jet well what do you expect when both models are planes with a limited number of parts for an alternative model the stunt plane looks fine theres not a lot of functionality in this plane but its worth mentioning that the tail wheel allows the plane to roll on a flat surface the plane also has working propellors both functions are demonstrated in the video unfortunately the landing gear of the stunt plane is not retractable parts left a couple of extra leftover parts but its nice to see that most of the parts have been used in the bmodel as well actually theres probably an extra yellow technic smooth 12 bush left i just found it on my desk but it could belong to one of the other sets video heres a video demonstrating the stunt plane summary two nice planes for 13 bucks thats basically what you get both models look good and the set has some interesting new parts especially the 7l flex axle will be very popular it comes with a decent collection of white panel although they are very common nowadays both models have limited functionality but each of them has at least one function to give the model some playability for kids other than the swooshability that is okay it might lack some proper functions but i still think kids will love this set i can see kids running around with one of the planes in their hands all in all i think this set delivers what youd expect score lets see how this set flies remember that the grades are based on it being a small set obviously a set like this cannot be compared with a mercedes flagship 8 design for a small set the model looks very authentic 7 building experience no surprises 7 features just the retractable landing gear 8 playability it has swooshability so i see kids running around with this model 7 parts lots of panels if you are into that 8 value for money cant go wrong with these small sets 75 fun for kids more image can be found on my flickr page thank you for reading i hope you enjoyed it	positive
very nice little set and a lot of those new white small panels its a need	positive
very nice review for a nice little set i especially like the smoothness of operation for the retractable landing gear i dont like the lack of symmetry for the propeller of the b model though but understand the alternative would be to add one extra small panel to the set or skip two of them in the b model	positive

i got this little set for xmas and i noticed all the gaps and decided to fix them so here it is img5344 by jj2sam on flickr first i added some beams to the wings and top to make it less hollow second i put some navigation lights on it i made the nose a bit wider and added a control panel and lastly i changed out the landing gear wheels to more appropriate ones img5349 by jj2sam on flickr more pictures are here	neutral

jim on 01 december 2015  0934 am said you are right i came to the same conclusion when writing the review i tell you it doesnt look that good without stickers but i dont have a picture to prove it to be honest i compared it to the model posted in the 2016 topic a few days ago i applied the stickers before building the model so i wasnt able to make a proper comparison i will keep it in mind for future reviews thanks for the suggestion youre welcome im not a huge fan of stickers for 2 reasons i do reuse all the parts normallyand also i believe a model should look great even without stickers then obviously they can be a plus but only afterwords anyway im enjoying the reviews as usual and those pics thanks for making them jim	neutral

lego 42049 mine loader thanks to lego and eurobricks for making this review possible this was supposed to be a previewreview before the dec 1 release date for the set but it got stuck in customs or something and didnt arrive in time well id rather do a good late review than a rushed review so here it is name mine loader set number 42049 pieces 476 i think price 3999 i think minifigs 0 theme technic year of release 2016 links bricklink brickset the box another standard technic box not that theres anything wrong with that it is a littler weird that the mine loader is shown outside the mine but whatever the back of the box again very standard its oddly technical showing the exact angle of the machine when turning but thats the sort of nerdy detail that technic people like the alternate mine cutting machine model looks interesting and unusual as well the 11 part the 11 part on the top of the box is especially helpful with this set these mining machines are very oddly proportioned since they need to fit in mine tunnels so its hard to judge the model size based on the wheels or seat like you can an ordinary set the contents you get manuals for both models a single book for the b and two books for the main a medium size sticker sheet 4 bags and 4 loose tires the special parts this set has 4 of the new mudguard panels in yellow two cylinder halves in red a new color some of the new color red and yellow axles a couple of the newish technic spacers some of the axlepin combination pieces and a couple swords im pretty sure thats an antenna and a spare the start of the bmodel since i like the main model better im building the alternate first so thats how ill write the review theres power for something probably the engine being taken off the one axle here overall a pretty standard technic frame beginning with some structural beams a frame and using liftarms to support axles out to the sides more of the frame the far end of the model has some obvious steering mechanism being formed as well as a pivoting arm right in the center thats probably the connection from the hand of god knob the steering yup called it oddly there is a different turning radius between right and left right now i wonder if thatll get fixed more mechanisms thats looking more technic now sad to see a ujoint being used just as a fixed straight connection like that but it is the alternate model the engine block because all engines should be enclosed in a red cylindrical housing am i right the chassis its definitely coming together now and yes the bmodel instructions tell you to put the stickers on it doesnt matter whether you build the main or alternate first youll get the stickers on almost  there were a couple leftover that didnt get used in the bmodel almost done with the rest of the body done and the wheels on you really get the scale of this machine that blue seat is tiny compared to the rest of it and yes the uneven steering lock got fixed after putting the wheels on you add a couple of pin with ball pieces to the underside to restrict the steering they didnt do that at first so that you could turn the axles sharper while putting the wheels on which made it easier to do the grinder keeping in mind the scale of the machine this thing looks terrifying the tan gear at the back drives the spinning blade up front the red bushes near the turntable let you adjust the angle all done the arm quickly attaches to the body and its done sadly that tan gear doesnt connect to anything  its just a knob so you can spin the blade by hand raise your hand if youre sure i think im dating myself with that title this thing has massive reach im imagining this inside a mine grinding away the rock overhead pretty viciously effective machine the crank on this side of the model is used to raise and lower the arm works well and the grey spacer makes it nice to use since it spins freely the leftovers not much left for a bmodel nice usage starting the main model the main model starts similarly to the alternate with a frame some axles and a drive connection from one axle to something later getting complicated already were only a few pieces in and we already have three separate gear trains going on theres the axle driving the tan beveled gears inside the frame at the bottom theres more tan gears in the middle and theres also a black gear sticking up as a knob that turns the grey connector in the center the body is done i skipped ahead quite a bit but it was a bunch of standard technic building youve got a fake engine with fan at the back driven by one of the rear wheels a knob sticking up for steering and an axle coming forward to open and close the claw the claw i like that they used a link system to open and close the claw instead of just gearing it the axle comes forward from the chassis its the red axle with a couple ujoints for flexibility and drives a worm gear that rotates a gear below with a 2 stud liftarm on each side those arms have pin with towball in them and then a link going from that short liftarm to the claw its a small rotation of the liftarm but makes the claw open widely and works very well raising the claw a few black liftarms join the claw to the body of the loader and allow it to move up and down its a simple mechanism there  one yellow beam goes back and connects to a lever that lets you raise and lower the claw when raised as shown the lever locks in place by going just slightly past the centerline and its done add some wheels a cab and some wheel arches and were done its a great looking machine pretty unique and looks like the real thing the main difference from reality is these usually have a scoop for moving loose rock since weve had so many scooping vehicles in the past tracked loaders the volvo l350f excavators etc the claw here is a fun change and adds to the playability for kids like the real thing the body stays very low so the cab only has to stick up a little bit for the driver to see all around because mines are cramped and busy areas from the rear this angle is great i love the use of the new mudguard panels to make a nice curve to the back of the loader the antenna is a little weird but perhaps they had a big pile of flat silver fencing swords to use up the black gear just to the left of the antenna is the claw control rotating that gear opens and closes it the back end is a little lighter than a real machine would be but lego wanted to leave the engine exposed so you can see the cylinders moving the conclusion so whats my conclusion on this model i like it a lot its simpler than a big set would be but its got lots of design and playability crammed in a midsized set its a unique vehicle however it does have a few flaws the steering on the main model needs some drag added as is you basically have to drive by holding the steering knob since itll bend if you push it from behind i dont like the use of pin with pin hole as mounting points for the orange and red trans plates for lights since they can turn slightly and be at weird angles the antenna is unnecessary and in the way but none of these flaws are dealbreakers or even big deals theyre minor the ratings value 1010  less than 10 cents a piece lots of useful liftarms and such nothing too weird or singleuse design 910  looks very realistic for the size of the set good functionality not too dependent on stickers minifigs na  na playability 910  controls arent perfect loose steering small knob for claw control but very functional and cleverly done parts 910  nice selection although heavy on the standard yellow and black almost zero studded parts overall 9510  its a great intro to technic set  a unique vehicle good functionality nice part selection and decently priced i like it a lot and plan to keep it around as a finished set	positive
i was waiting especially for review of this set let me add few things about this thing it all will be complainging of person who works with these type of machines so if you just want a unusual machine in your collection ignore my complaining  i see underground loaders almost every day and believe me this model would now work in the underground mine first of all its cab should stick out more from the frame each loader has cab placed out of the chassis to provide better view for the driver in this class of machine it would help a bit but in low loader ones it is extremely important this is the view from the cab of a low profile loader looking at front  and yes front of the machine is where engine is placed because at least at kghm all machines drive engine forward another thing about that cab is that seat and steering wheeljoysticks are placed perpendicularly to the machine chassis to provide same view for driving forward and backwards so another weak spot of the set the model lacks of trans clear lights on the engine part because all machines that work underground have same lamps on front and back another thing that comes to my mind is that warning light and antena would not live too long in the mine becuase it could be torn apart by ramming into tunnels roofs it does resemble shape of underground machine but not a loader only machine that comes to my mind is something that are used for movingplacing hydraulic support jacks in tunnels sorry for poor quality i didnt find better picture of it it does have claw four wheels and articulated chassis but have much greater range of movement of the arm anyway id give it at least 35 for overall look model itself as a set looks unfinished or cut down on pieces after visit of an accountant for me it looks like engine part was built differently with knobs for steeringclaw operating sticking out from back claw needs almost seven full turns of the worm gear to close from opened position and is rather annoing to use it in way it is built in this model bracket that holds bevel gears responsible for steering is rather loose being hold in place by single 34 pin on the other hand the steering works very well it seems that lack of differential will be more common in lego sets becuase it is another model that have fake engine driven by single wheel like in old russian rc cars i am ok with that but it is a pitty that this model has only r2 engine thing that i do not like the most in this model is how the claw arm works first of all it barelly lifts the claw of the ground the movement could be much better and it has major design flaw  universal joints are not placed in line with articulation points and this is main reason of 5l axle not being suported on both sides under the turntable while rainsing the arm it bends a little i really would like to see this model built differently with normal bucket and better range of movement edited by mlonger 05 december 2015  1108 pm	negative

you switched the sides for the panel with the unsymmetrical sticker otherwise you would see that the cut off part is where theres a beam in front of the panel thats probably done because the beam could possibly damage the sticker either while building or while placed against it for a long time or its simply omitted because it wouldnt be completely visible	neutral

until i saw photos of this set i wasnt convinced i wanted it now after seeing all the combinations ab and tumbler tires i am definitely buying two copies i need orange parts and black treads anyway the only problem i have with this is that its going to encourage me to buy many copies of the drag racer just to get enough wheels to play with	positive

youve done a good job of this review mr imperialscouts but two things 1 background far too bright and the set is far too dark easily rectified with brightness  contrast adjustment 2 no poll to rate the set out of 5 nonetheless this should be frontpaged on classicpiratescom	neutral
the poll doesnt allow you to select 2 from 15 it instead says 1 3 3 4 5 but besides that your review i give it a 5 because 1 shows the set in all angles 2 shows the characters 3 comment on the little creature comforts of the set 4 added a comic playability 5 showed true enthusiasm y wub	neutral

i got most of the sets from 07 theyre pretty cool	positive
thanks for the review i still will not get this set speechless about it	neutral
a wonderful set and perhaps as close to classic space as possible y also theres a great amount of very useful and interesting parts too like these round stabilizer parts with clip  theres a complete different feeling with this new sets compared to the first mm ones 8 beside the a little more realistic aspects of it with the more enclosed cockpit nearly with some controls   its the overall more solid feeling i guess the other sets look pretty neat and fashionable at the surface but their internal structure is much more hollow and useless with some studless technic beams and such stuff very shining but hard and boring to mod just aimed for maximal cool looking box art and the rest went down for saving costs beside that already pretty good 7692 dropship that is the only thing i dont get with that is why the minirobots a onearmed one ach pirates on mars i suppose xd	positive
that head might have been from rock raiders lovely set and a good review jifel	positive
hmm not actually a bad set not high on my to buy list therere other things up there first but definitely a possibility somewhere down the line thanks for the review	neutral
great review but am i the only one who thinks this is a pretty homely looking vehicle the small exploration robot is cool but the large windscreen on the main vehicle reminds me about jack stone i also think the bases of the vehicle parts are very basic and look almost unfinished with the holes and such i think i will pass this one even though the alien has a jet pack and there is the nice mini vehicle	negative

xwingyoda on nov 26 2007 0125 pm said tks for the great review mm  its always appreciated to have reviews of new set having said that i really dont see the point of that set and its such money and time wasted imo i dont like that theme apart the dropship and 6wheeler and that tiny vehicle doesnt do the trick for me i see it as a really cheap excuse to try and please classic space fan with that horrendous mm graphics and what amazes me is that you guys loke that d money saved on  yoda poor yoda  look on the bright side at least its not a mass of technic parts like the 6 wheeler 	negative
piranha on nov 26 2007 0713 pm said jelly jetpack   come on you have to admit that a jelly with a jetpack is funny pathetically so any way i might make a vig of this involving a brick wall and plenty of transgreen peices xd	positive
thanks for posting the picture of this new mm set when i first saw the mars mission sets i was a little apprehensive about the design and the aliens they could have at least make movable arms  but anyways when i bought the small fighter i was totally hook my fave set from the line is the mech	positive
during the annual thanksgiving road trip to the relatives i stopped by the tru in portland or lo and behold the new mars mission sets predictably i bought them i present to you the mx41 switch fighter man what a long name the box standard mm on the front it shows the fighter in flight mode and a yellow note telling you that it transforms the back shows three pictures showing it happen the parts once i open the box the first thing that comes out is a bent and rolled up instruction booklet and i was forced to put it under a stack of beer books for an hour then theres the dss yes two of the stickers do feature a cobra i wonder why because this sets decal should be a beatle xd decent parts nothing too special then i noticed this little part its used for the flickmissiles but i have no idea what else it would be used for  the build the alien ship when i looked at the box art for this set i was releived to see that the aliens dont have another curvedforward wing ship instead they have this little beauty which appears to be the alien mini cooper small and hot wub anyway partially completed even if you dont like the set it has some nice green flame peices which work nicely for space laser swords fully completed the only annoying bit about it is that the crystalholding thing in front wobbles all over the place the alien fits into it by way of impalement it must hurt getting in and out switch fighter cockpit the set makes good use of the alpha team cockpit for controls it has a meagre handlebar that the astronaught cant even reach the rear shell of the fighter starts out around the alien containment chamber its a bit odd that the containment chamber has an alien sticker because the instruction booklet lists it as holding crystals the crystal canister is held back by a technic pin this is without a doubt the ugliest color arrangment ever warning mass stickers x the cockpit fits into grooves in the shell then it clicks into place in a 1x1 brick with a horizontal clip the wing mechanism the wing for some reason the body of the mechanism has a blue brick wacko the wing and mechanism connect to prevent the fighter doing a nosedive while in tank mode the wing mechanism completed the underside the body and wing connect by way of a miscolored red brick i have no idea why its red black would bave been much much better completed tank mode all in all this looks pretty neat the wheel base is pretty short but its not bad transform the set transforms neatly if ungainly without antigrav support it would fall forward on its nose each time it transformed jet mode its all right but it could be a bit better the shell keeps slipping back forward to the tank mode because theres nothing to stop it sliding spare parts overall i thought this set was great it could do with some fixing such as the mismatched colors but it should be a definate buy for mm fans brickshelf gallery when available	positive
cool review im actually liking that new missile part as it seems to combine a bar with a pin but its a real eyesore if you ask me	positive
great review sinner on nov 26 2007 1222 am said well since antigrav doesnt exist and will never exist there has to be another option looking at it in tank mode it does have a vague aerofoil shape so i think it should be able to work as a lifting body all it needs to do then is move fast enough to start taking off and then it can extend the wings 8 this is clearly tlg officially supporting antigrav technologyi mean think about it how can it support itself without antigrav while transforming the answer it cant sweet p	neutral
hmm its actually a nice bit better than i expected and great review thanks but think ill pass on this one i quite like the alien fighter though heh and loved the way you described how he sat in the cockpit	negative
very cool review mr mandalorian this isnt a bad set the alien craft is very sleek if only theyd gone with the old alien body in transgreen and the transforming is alright the tank mode looks sweet sweet peace	positive
thanks for a very thorough review i might think about getting this i really like the mini alien fighter and the transformation idea is always a welcome one both modes look pretty good despite the some of the odd coloured bricks which id mod out you know what it reminds me of some of the futuristic designs in the gerry anderson series	positive
i really like the transforming aspect of this the one thing i wish mm sets would include would be baseplates i liked that about the classic space stuff because it really helped create the environment some red rock orange mars baseplates would be great	positive
lasse d on nov 26 2007 0454 pm said im not sure it would nose dive when transforming from tank mode i guess it would pick up speed and transform quickly since it doesnt seem to have any downwards pointing thrusters the one thing youd have to make sure of though is that it was fairly light and the wheel base had a fairly large surface area actually thats two things so as to make sure it didnt dig into the soil if that happened transformation would be harder as the wheels would dig into the ground and drag through the soil then itd nose dive	neutral
and another tks and congrats mm on that review  like the oher post i think that this set is a wastre of time and money and shelfspace its such a ripp off from that ugly alfa team crapjet i do not like the design of the jet itself the small flags as front is so lame  and i dont like those orange wheels as engines  furthermore i dont like the rover mode either  the only cool thing about it is the special martian jet which they should ahve sold separatly p at least some interesting parts but that far from saving that set imo  money saved on once again p yoda	negative

sweeeet wub its nice to finally see a set thats not bipedal or  tripedal quote exoforce is an anomaly in my lego interests i dont know why i like it so much or why i keep buying it but i do that would be a problem wouldnt it p quote the cockpit itself is constructed very well but the canopy seems like an afterthought closing on to the robots head and leaving his back and sides completely exposed i dunno at least it has a canopy unlike past sets	positive
thanks hinckley its always nice to see your reviews and i cant wait to see the story mode from the pic i guess it will include sinner and hinckley instead of bianca and gavin right 8  luxorv	positive
thanks for that very neat review hinckley y this set looks indeed very interesting with a very cool antlike look and a simple but essential overall design the cockpit seems better protected than many other ef ones that spines lovely and the way these iron dronesre attached is simple but effective  and hey did i miss something orre there really no crappy shooting devices p thanks to the minirobots and their inventor i guess 	positive
great review as always hinckley frankly im in love with this thing so much so in fact that ive been calling it shadow panther for weeks but never mind anyway why do i like it well purple is such a fantastic lego colour its sparingly used which makes it interesting and it simply looks great those jetpackbackpack things the robots are wearing and if they are jetpacks as the back of the box suggests then the use of chaisaws is quite nifty and innovative the minibot is cool and certainly an interesting gimmick sure they dont look quite as good in some of the other sets but here it looks great the overall structure and design are cool too its always nice to see an irregular mech and this is no exception its especially cool whee the spines are concerned plus on top of all that its got a nice selection of parts including some lovely new ones and the inlaid box is interesting well worth getting i think	positive
another fantastic review hinckley i really like this set i wasnt to keen on it when i first saw the pictures bit having seen the review i am starting to like it it seems quite sturdy and it makes a change from the usual 2 legged mechs as well as that purple is welcome anywhere i have such a shortage of that colour i like the rusty orange colour of the robots and their backjet packs are quite cool and the mini robot looks sweet	positive
hinckley on nov 27 2007 0747 pm said thanks everyone im glad you are enjoying the review im working on the 8118 right now and will have comics up for both starting tonight the instructions do not have a comic but i always write one for my reviews featuring my sigfig or other fabuland creatures interacting with the new set translation interactingwhacking fabuland creatures sinner copmike and yoda usually xd 	neutral

sinner on nov 28 2007 1253 am said how well do the tracks work the last tank was too light and it didnt roll well at all  its similar in weight but i didnt have to press down so hard to get the treads to move barely at all really i think the mobile defense tank although a better overall design suffered from the odd angle of the treads and that was mostly why the treads didnt turn well plus what was with those weird exhaust pipes anyway they are both cool tanks although i like the mobile defense tank better 	neutral
hinckley on nov 28 2007 0648 am said cool but my reviews are not meant to sway anyone they should just inform people further as if they want to buy it or not i am not necessarily for encouraging anyone to buy every set i review d but im glad you liked it thank you oh i know but without the info i definately wouldnt buy it now im considering it hinckley on nov 28 2007 0648 am said and actually i did feel the same way you did about the flying module until i put sinner in it and started to play heres a sneak peek of the comic and a cool feature of ryos shipit can be configured in a lot of different ways xo  sinner fits in there well im sold xd	positive

here is my review of the set 6265 sabre island overview sabre island was release in 1990 an it contained 92 pieces and its retail price was 1550 it comes with 3 imperial blue coats and a nice outpost for them the pictures  full review anyway you can see here a picture of the box the model shown on the box differs from the actual model slightly and the back of the box which shows some nice alternative models from the pieces provided a close up of two or three of the alternative models and now for the minifigs i prefer the red coats over the blue coats but these minifigs are nice and for the number of pieces one gets a fair amount of them the set itself makes a nice small outpost it comes complete with a palm tree a cannon with ammo on a turntable a small tower a nice large imperial flag and a little red row boat here is a shot from ground level showing the cannon and blue coat patrolling the out post the rowing boat was a nice touch and it comes with a small flag too no pirates will avoid the wrath of myself and my mighty island the top of the tower is rather plain and simple which in some ways is good as it keeps the whole set detailed yet not crowded but i feel a little something should of been added to the top though the back is lacking any type of walls so one can play with the minifigs inside yet their are also no stairs or any other ways for the blue coats to climb up their tower either the rag tag pirates attack sabre island but never fear the lord of pies is here me throwing a pie at captain ironhook from another angle overall i think this is a very good if somewhat simple set and makes a great cheap imperial set comments thoughts and opinions are welcome and sorry about the darkness in some photos i have not had time to take photographs when it is till light recently for when i return home it is dark   edit fixed thank you edited by phred 12 april 2015  0514 am	positive
nice review hmmi gave it a 4why very good bits 3 epaulettes for 3 gurads patterned wall parts cannon bad bits no pirates to fight title is rather grand for an outpost top needs battlements not very low lattices needs a more substantial base  the wall goes right into the sea  surely the whole thing would sink palm tree is too short and the rest is good p you might want to fix the vote option for 5  it appears to be the title you cant vote for it pirate king skelly killer edit ok boney but i gave it a 4 edited by slyowl 06 december 2007  0732 pm	positive
its not a bad thing to vote sabre island 1 if someone feels that its genuinely worth 1 but twould be interesting to know why	positive
i gave this one a 5 its one of the little pirate sets i had during my youth and i loved it for several reasons first of all it contains 2 of my favorite minifigs it can be used as a small independent base or in combination with one of the bigger sets eldorado or trading posts as a lookup or outer defense besides all that this set just looks beautiful i love the colors blue baseplate and the whiteyellow tower one of the best littlemedium sized sets ever made by lego	positive
i give it a 4 only because there are no pirates i aways loved this set nice little fortifaction lots of details i only wish i could have worked it in aberbrick	positive

lord of pies on dec 6 2007 0724 pm said the top of the tower is rather plain and simple which in some ways is good as it keeps the whole set detailed yet not crowded but i feel a little something should of been added to the top though perhaps a catapult steve	neutral
did i hear right a catapult in the 16th17th18th and 19th centuries wacko perhaps its an appeal for lord of pies to have his own personal catapult to pelt the pirates with whipped cream pastries should they try to sail past but this begs the question why waste perfectly good pie on those scurvy mangy muttfaced villians	neutral

lol those star wars heiroglyphics are awesome were those in the movie or is this just a joke by the lego designers that would be the first time tlc showed any kind of reference humor the rest of the set is great too even the skeleton and the stickers yes thats right i actually like those things i like the new skellies because of their posability im a big supporter  user of stopmotion and i think theres nothing wrong with stickers i mean seriously why does everybody hate stickers so much  sure they are a pain in the megablocks to put on and sure they come off after a while and are never usable again but hey you dont have to put them on even better you can save them like i do and use them for your mocs could somebody tell me please im just curious however as i said nice set i might even get one gotta love that marion with the carot torch xd and that arc is neat too by the way are all parts on it golden some more pics on it would be nice as soon as your camera is recharged  thanks peace out	positive

this set is so cool and another must buy  im in trouble next year it seems the figs are great wub i think the plane is only ok perhaps they should have made that in a separate set as it needed to be a certain size to fit the figs but that meant that the tail is way too short here is a picture of the actual plane so you can see what i mean notice the pilot is fishing   the temple is another story i think lego have done an incredible job with this fitting in the key parts of this sequence without making an absurdly large model addtionally there are many parts in this set that i havent got so it shouldnt be too hard to justify xd thanks for another great review sweet i love the photo of indy running with the idol and the boulder close behind p naith on dec 16 2007 1020 pm said lol is it just me or in the earlier concepts of this set we saw a native on the box i wonder why they removed it  wacko i recall that too  edit yes there was one big pete on dec 16 2007 1128 pm said we dont normally have this many inconsistencies do we  quite annoying ones too i think the plane looks better with those being white	neutral
because of exams and other obligations i havent posted this sooner seeing that noone else has reviewed this set i thought i might as well do it myself the set in its entire glory minus the slammer instructions and the obviously massive sticker sheet the four cars included in this set a muscle car a sports car a roadster and the police offroader because the police obviously have no clue that an offroader is useless for catching streetracers no less a batmobileish sports car it will always trail behind but the police have a trick up their sleeve  the drawbridge gotcha and the mechanism that makes it all tick the motor is nothing more than a slow pullback motor push down the bridge the latch will hook on to the gear and keep it in place until the latch is released and theres the new gas station staying within theme this gasstation is like the tanker in 8147 from the company fuel 4 speed theres a notable presence of detail here such as the sodadispenser water coolant bottles and other accesories two fuel pumps and bumperlevel railings to prevent cars from crashing into them theres no interior however and as demonstrated here by a loyal octanemployee and a pursuing officer the gas station is built to minifigscale my impressions of this set as a collector of tiny turbos and yet to miss a set i got this one regardless of what it included the gas station is indeed very nice and the minifigscale accesories were unexpected the lack of interior is no big issue and the both the station and bridge can with ease be implemented into a minifig town the bridge also solidly built and includes the ramps in its design so it can be lifted with ramps attached without breaking apart the slammer included in the set is identical apart from the white color with those in 8147 the cars are also very nice altough i am yet to get used to the yellow batmobile as ive grown accustomed to calling it i also love the offroaders chunky tires they make perfect wheels for the newer minifigscale cars i never consider priceparts ratio and here it would for me be irrelevant because it will never be demolished for parts the play value is what i would consider pretty good and while the bridge wont rise with a car on it its still strong enough to stay open with a car tipping over the edge hmm every nerve in my body is saying that this sets is worth roughly 810 so verdict 810 edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0701 pm indexed	positive

heres all the parts in assorted baggies and the horribly messed up instructions four astronauts and four aliens with an extra gold visor yay not bad the base of the horribly unstable alien craft the wings move up and down aswell as back and forth the purpose i know not next we build the nerf section of the base basically technic and the rest of the tube connectors heres the farthest i got the little missle to go its fairly dissapointing good thing i didnt expect much from this portion of the set heres the start of the command base more of the main structure will be adding lots of things to all the little beams heres a storage container and the surprisingly not flimsy radar on this side we see the alien elevator it uses a horribly long technic rod i have not seen one of this proportion its like a foot and a half long more of the inner base where all the little tubes shall go all the connected tubes and such i also encountered a problem in the instructions it says for the end of the elevator prong to be touching the tube connector where it is shown here but mine has a 1x space inbetween no matter heres the completed base  my knee again onto the spaceship the bulk of it is just technic supporting beams with some large slope peices covering it all up more on that later the white coverup the middle section lifts up to store the overly large jetpack as you see the storage containers take up most the bulk in the back and you can see the jetpack on the ground aswell as the trigger hand hold thing that allows you to swoosh it look in the back lego greebles despite the large cockpit it only holds one person laying down the wings are really the saving grace  double layered with a nice two toned effect kitty nudged me this picture so its abit blurry my apologies  extra peices and or peices i have no idea where the hell they go p overall the set is quite fun i must admit full price i probably would not go for it but i got it for just under 70 dollars for that price i can confidently say its quite worth it many useful peices nice figures other than the aliens and the tube things are quite fun to boot even though i liked the life on mars system more which i also have none the less its very fun to make them shoot around alright so its not much of a command base either and it looks abit bare but its still fun even if you ignore the nerf section overall i give it a hardy 35 out of 5 the openness and epic fail of a missile launcher are hard to get by but overall its a dandy set d merry christmas wub	positive

thanks for the review brickmaster this set looks nice i really like the orange wub and white colour scheme although the purple of the lom base was very cool too i only have the lom base if you have it built could you show a comparison on an unrelated note by the time i realised the red and blue hangers on the lom base were for the red and blue mechs the mechs were no longer in stores  i was a bit slow huh p anywho this is one set i wont be buying although if the rocket was sold separately id get that d thanks again y peace	neutral
i quite like it but i feel that my lego city is getting overrun with helicopters and planes also i have got the helicopter from the 7237 police station set but it is not as good as this plus iam sooooo dissapointed that the x stickers x are blue instead of black and green as they will not fit with the sets i have already got d nice review thanks edited by caseyref 26 december 2007  0204 am	positive

thank everybody sinner on dec 26 2007 0609 am said thanks for the review pspguy i think this is a very nice little chopper but the biggest reason why i will probably get this is for the handcuffs d are the side windows flush like the old ones or recessed like the new ones are supposed to me the look recessed to me   yes youre right  what if your asking how they are but together you snap the window piece into the holder edit scrypt on dec 26 2007 0336 am said if you look at the police picture from the instruction booklet it looks to me that the 3 sets in the bottom left corner are the bike 7235 patrolcar 7236 and prisoner transport 7245 from 2005 but with new blue stickers hey thats copyrighted mister p edited by pspguy 26 december 2007  0521 pm	positive

i enjoyed seeing this review nice to get some different angles on the components sorry to disagree with anyone however but this was not a great review i appreciate the effort sandra made but a great review would include more details such as what are stickers and what are printed pieces a great review points out flaws or limitations as well as what works or is really neat a great review would have analyzed the price per piece and compared that to other setsthemes one might look at the recent reviews of the indy sets or the new spongebob sets as examples of really good reviews the pictures are good but a great review above all should provide the reader with some new information perhaps even answer questions posed in the prerelease discussion thread i learned nothing new about the set from this review that said it was a good review for someone who had not seen the prerelease discussion and she did a good job of showing said person what they could expect in the set	positive

thanks for the review i really want this set because 1 it looks fantastic 2 has harder to find colors 3 is a 50th anniversary commemorative 4 some of the models are based on the 50s sets i love the old stuff the tanker truck is a perfect recreation of the old ho 187 scale esso tanker truck i have one and you can look at it for comparison if you would like lego ho vehicles id like to modify the truck from this new set to look even more like the old esso truck getting rid of the green and adding some decals	positive

i was fortunate enough to get one along with the hobby train they are the first trains i have ever owned mainly by virtue of them having been half price its a fantastic selection of parts with the holiday train as well as it really looking the part as a set im happy not to get a motor as i think the 9v setup would prove expensive and the ir control system for the rc setup seems a bit poor i got some dead track for with it to have just as a push train for now	positive

great review yoda thanks for sharing i wasnt real fond of the postal truck at first its so different than those in the us but after seeing your closeup images esp the back of the tuck it looks really neat i also like the mail box a lot it looks good in red too bad for the stickers but its still nice the plane reminds me a lot of the design used in the jurassic park set as youve said its similar to 80s designs i really like the brickbuilt design too its just real lego  thats about all i can say very nice sets that are a must together thanks for the review	positive

thanks for a nice review and few comments to sets nice airplane finally some reminiscence for lego city golden era for me years 19821992 everything is nice but two things are freezing a smile on my face first of all the ugly new hinge used for plane roof i have already 4032 and those new hinges are looking really terrible when compared fe with 6368 second one is new minifig i dont know what i expected but this torso design looks too simple and too cheap concerning new car  i appreciate fact that tlc makes after long long years again postal sets but i dont like those newstyle cars matchbox wheels and bad rate between drivers cockpit and cargo space are damping me from buying 6651 mail truck or 105 canada post truck were much better edited by kanalk1 06 january 2008  0733 pm	positive
while the plane does look nice i dont particularly care for the van but the van does have some good parts which is the only reason i would by one yellow mud guards the new windshield and the small door on the rear	neutral
well first off thanks yoda for the great review  hmmm well i have to say im not at all impressed with any of these sets i mean there nice and all but the van just seems way to small it would have been nice if you could fit more than one package in it i guessim one of those that are more of the fan of the 6 wide trucks and the plane hm this has a cute factor and all but i mean comon you have to open a hatch on the roof to get your packages in and what about getting them out you have to flip the plane upside down  weak they should have had a hinged rear end or a hatch on the side	negative

5150 lego on jan 6 2008 1108 pm said well first off thanks yoda for the great review  hmmm well i have to say im not at all impressed with any of these sets i mean there nice and all but the van just seems way to small it would have been nice if you could fit more than one package in it i guessim one of those that are more of the fan of the 6 wide trucks i see your point that more cargo capacity would have been better nevertheless my personal preference is for smaller classic scale city sets the mail van is nice and small and should fit well with my road plates and 1990s cars from the 4561 train on a side note did anyone notice the message on the back of both sets boxes designed for easy building and instant play it surprised me a little since these sets seem no less complex than any other city set of late they look like quick builds sure but not as though the designers went out of their way to simplify them	positive
thanks for the great reviews yoda the car looks great y and the plane is very cool too and much more suited to a lego town than the large planes on xd peace	positive
hey everyone my first 2008 set is this one 5613 i thought id share a review of it sweet id like to say sorry about my photos they were taken quickly first we have the box it is the smallest lego box ive ever seen and actually looks cute wub it will be heavy competition with playmobils specials back of the box showing an action pose the contents of the little box with a very tiny instruction manual wub the manual unfolded notice that every part has its part number beside it  the back of the manual showing some fire sets and the other impulse sets the parts 30 in total the small set built the firefighter has a small fire to extinquish armed with an axe chainsaw other saw and foam psssh thing xd  five extra parts in a 30 part set we get an extra black hatchet yellow bar tap light bley 11 plate red 11 plate modified with fingers and 22 dark bley radar dish besides the plate ive never seen these as reserve parts but im not complaining xd here is a small alternate model i created with it a small bbq what hes hungry and he needs to put something on the bbq  xd overall you cant go wrong with these impulse sets i paid 289 euros for this little set so thats a great value sadly the only impulse avaible were these 3 city sets no police and the alien mars mission looking forward to the knight and magician as well as those indy sets tt	positive
thanks for that really nice review dunamis now it is even more harder for me to wait for this set i hope my legostore will get it tomorrow it is really nice im a really big fan of the creator houses but that one is now the best one for me i love the colour of it and of course the windows at the roof wub creator house on greetings sandra	positive

thanks for the review dunamis this is a great little set im also very impressed with takuto20s mods ive been trying a few of my own i liked the tower block design but a lot of stuff needed fixing firstly i added a 4th wall and made it so the storeys could be lifted off like in the other models i also added flowers on the windowsills and doorways out on to the balconies still to be added is an extra door for the top floor which im going to get from the new doors and windows pack i added a chimney that goes all the way up the back of the house and has a fireplace on every level each floor is fully furnished with a fireplace wash basin and bed on the upper levels and a corner sofa and coffee table plus an extra large fireplace on the ground floor finally here is my idea of what to do with two copies of this set all the parts pictured are from 2x 4996 except 5 extra fence panels and the minifigs the house on the left has its garden at the rear	positive

a troll driven by a turkey leg what a wonderful little detail d d thanks for the review vader very clever using a flag to hide that crazy firing device i find it rather odd they used blue pins for this black or gray wouldve been alot more discrete about the big trolls i think using different colours is good i dont think a troll force would be very organized so different colours would make the effect complete y  as for your troops looks quite fearsome definitely compared to my pathetic number of soldiers  a nice set but i would rather get the attack on tower though no matter about the price difference	negative

lego city truck  forklift set  7733 pieces 343 price 2499 usd store of purchase toys rus release date january 2008 after discussion of the mysterious yellow cargo contained in this new city transport set and a visit to my local tru i purchased this set i was immediately pleased with the pricepiece which i think is pretty reasonable 343 pieces for 25 starting with the box great city artwork boasting special edition tha backside of the box no alternate models comes as no surprise the dreaded decals i was looking for the skull and bones for radioactive but no such luck my favorite part of the set a very clever forklift side view and the backside what i like about the forklift is the bars across the top giving the vehicle a reallife design the double wheels in the front with two pieces that can hold the wheels also adds to a clever design i like the figs although not much new  perhaps ill make the driver into a werewolf later the set includes three cargo pallets the first some sort of fuel with gauge the 2nd two indy containers and a square 2x4 brick i have not put the decals on yet and the mysterious yellow cargo your guess is as good as mine   on to the truck the front section the front grill another angle the back i like the opening mechanism that is very simple but works well also is the large plate tile piece inside i like this because the entire interior has no studs and the trailer section of the truck orange and yellow tail lights and the rear trailer open the complete set summary this is a neat set that reminds me a bit of classic lego city but larger it is very playable and has a lot of accessories adding to the value the build was very simple and enjoyable took me about an hour it is a great addition to a number of city sets including the cargo ship container stacker the world city cargo train and the new cargo plane as i mentioned previously i have not yet put on the decals that im sure will really add to the overall look of the set the forklift is awesome and i like the cargo containers the truck could have benefited from a few additional details chrome smokers and an undercarriage box that really opens considering everything i would buy this set again hope you enjoy and perhaps this mysterious cargo will make its way into a brickster mystery y	positive

greetings and welcome to another redman review im your host redman and today i adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the impulse set simply titled the knight no wait thats the old script xd i mean the good wizard sweet the other castle impulse set the first being the knight this is a wonderful and in my case unexpected addition to the castle line i did not expect to get a nice good wizard but rather another plain white skellie for the impulse and was pleasantly surprised when i saw the first picture of this set the impulse sets give you pieces you wouldnt expect to see in such small sets for example the knight came with the armour and this comes with an owl a gem and a crystal ball piece it comes with 11 pieces including the wand owl and gem and no spares which doesnt really matter as it doesnt need any the box sports the set number age range which i blissfully ignore xd awesome castle logo and the assembled set with the usual 11 scale picture of a minifig the back of the box shows pictures of the boxed skeleton tower and kings castle siege sets note the price is in new zealand dollars and is really the same prica as any other impulse set next are the instructions which are separated into 3 parts 1 for the minifigure 1 for the table and one for the bird stand very simple also worth mentioning is the parts numbers are next to their respective parts for replacement parts etc on the back we see on the top half pictures of skeleton prison carriage skeleton tower and kings castle siege this time not of the boxed sets but the sets themselves on the lower half we have 8 pictures each of the different impulse sets the wizards torso is plain sand blue with no patterns or anything but it doesnt really matter is his beards in the way  the head is that same old white fade to grey beard head but the white beard covers up most of the grey my favourite part is the pants i love that were getting printed belts and legs again his belt has 4 gold crosses as seen in if you look closely the new crownies torso and the crownie archers torso and a belt buckle and the legs have a bottle a coin and a small bag nice little wizardey items the er items no accessories no models the stuff in the set include a little stand for the owl and a table utilising the new 4x4 round piece in light bley with the crystal ball in the middle encasing the yellow gem held on by a 2x2 circle piece in blue why blue im not sure maybe its because the crystal is yellow and the crownies colours are blue and gold so the blue piece with the yellow crystal symbolise the crownies colours or maybe tlc just felt the need to include an odd colour p in conclusion this is a wonderful set with some neat accessories and it doesnt really need to be bought in the masses after all you needs an army of owls and wizards  p so it works fine as a single set and adds a more fantasy feel to your crownie army thats all for today folks sweet redman thanks for reading another of my redman interviews any suggestions on how towhat to do to improve it is greatly appreciated as are all comments and criticisms except those blatant thoughtless criticisms that dont help at all p peace edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0131 pm	positive
tinypiesrus on jan 20 2008 0605 am said the wizard is pretty good and comes with some good parts it would be nicer if he had a torso with printing on it i agree in fact its a point ive already made on this board simonwillems on jan 20 2008 0259 pm said the only thing that could have been better in my opinion is the wand i always liked this one again a point i agree with and already made on this board im not blaming you guys  the op in this thread should at the very least have linked to the existing thread about this set on this board  edited by amperzand 20 january 2008  0501 pm	negative
amperzand on jan 21 2008 0356 am said im not blaming you guys  the op in this thread should at the very least have linked to the existing thread about this set on this board  why its his review and a very good one at that i dont see why he needed to link anything be glad that he was kind enough to take the time to write up this review now we have two different opinions on a set which is great there is no need for him to give credit to you its his review  batbrick is back 	positive
blueandwhite on jan 21 2008 1015 am said not bad i could see picking up a couple of these guys along with a few of the new knights i actually prefer the wizard as these impulse items are simply too expensive for army building imo later same thats why ill probly only get the wizard because they are quite expensive if you compare them to the 2 ones i used to get back around 2000 and you got about the same peices aswell 	negative
iamded on jan 21 2008 0303 pm said thanks everyone for your feedback sorry i knew you had done a review but i didnt think you had to post a link to all other reviews already done on that set  its just expressing my opinions and sharing my thoughts about the set as well as giving people a bit of info the way i see it i dont really have to post a link in the first post but you can feel free to post a link to your review if you want to give people your thoughts and opinions besides nz never gets sets first and most of the ones i pick up have already been reviewed  peace so your saying you did the reveiw i thought it was redman xd 	neutral
iamded on jan 20 2008 0629 pm said the stuff in the set include a little stand for the owl and a table utilising the new 4x4 round piece in frown with the crystal ball in the middle encasing the yellow gem held on by a 2x2 circle piece in blue why blue im not sure wait isnt it light bley not frown  p although i would much rather have a brown table  more ontopic i love the wizards legs even better than the evil wizards ones the hip piece looks very nice on dark blue legs y	positive

lt veers on feb 4 2008 1142 pm said i do admit the amount of cargo is rediculously small but it still looks good say how much can the plane hold thanks for the review sweet thats all the space you get now it might be possible to rip out that rear bulkhead at the back of the wing and fill the middle area with tiles so cargo pallets could slide up the fuselage but that would definitely prevent the undercarriage folding internally if thats what you wanted to do as well dr s	neutral
thanks for the review and pics dr s i am still considering this set what is the instruction manual number	neutral
sinner on feb 4 2008 1151 pm said thanks for the review and pics dr s i am still considering this set what is the instruction manual number there are two  hopefully these are the numbers you need 4525919 4525920  dr s	neutral
i loved the pics in the catalogues but was a bit disappointed by the build and end result my own thoughts cons  as noted the cargo space is really small considering the size of the plane although i can see this is restricted due to playability  without the barrier in the middle the cargo would slide all over the place while the plane was being swooshed  the cargo lift im not sure how else to describe it is very weak and snaps off although it is a clever design i think its badly implemented  there is nothing to hold the cargo pallet to the cargo lift truck so it tends to slide off all over the place as soon as the truck moves  colour issues  i had at least 3 shades of green with the larger plane pieces and noticeable variances even with identical cargo hatch pieces at least one of them also came quite scratched which was a little disappointing  at 7995 aud its 10 more than the passenger plane was with less pieces and figs and no printed pieces whatsoever more  for less methinks pros  lots of nice cargo crate pieces and even the stickers for these are pretty good  landing gear piece adjusts very well to height differentials so the plane doesnt lose its gear as often as the earlier passenger planes  the hinging mechanism works very well to open the cargo holds  opens very smoothly and is not noticeable  id definitely like to see more of this technique  the little vehicles work well chained together and are all good small designs overall  i really like the large planes since 06 but i dont think theyve still quite hit the nail on the head whereas the earlier planes were a little flimsy this one is sturdier but has its own issues the look of the cargo plane is nice and the new landing piece and cargo hatch pieces are really great but some design weaknesses and colour issues detract from the overall product its a shame as with a bit of tweaking this could have been a musthave set	negative
wow thats a great review of a great set dr s y as you yourself have already noted this has the potential to be a fantastic military moc with a bit of modification you can get the engines to be rounder or perhaps do away with them completely and replace them with jet engines sweet though i cant think of a system to retract the undercarriage at the top of my head it seems like theres indeeed more than enough potential to do so it reminds me rather of an ilyushin il76 one of my favourite cargo planes 	positive
thanks for the review i like the looks of the set but im not sure about it still is it work 35 would you recomend buying it	neutral
thanks for the review that seems to be a nice set but as far im concerned i dont think its worth eur 4999 there arent so many parts though those new curved slope will add some more building possibilities y what lacks   a 2 x 4 cut out in the lower part of the nose to retract the landing gear  a 4 x 6 cut out in the lower part of the tail to allow passagers to get off through the back like in a dc10  some real plates and tiles instead of these crappy wings this part is the useless one that tlc ever produced n	negative

hello and welcome to another oh wait first batbrick and iamded review today us two sworn enemies will be reviewing the creator cargo chopper here is the front of the box and while pushing iamded to his doom here is the back haha ouch oh dearhere are the parts anyway here is the instruction of the first model the cargo chopper i love creator sets for the different models they always excite me just ignore me finishing off my nemesis in the background something very interesting that i liked in the instructions was this step where you must add those three 2x2 yellow rounded pieces under the chopper this is for support while you build which is handy and later you take it off and even later use it as the cargo i found that to be rather innovative and clever as well as  hey what are you hitting me for both instruction booklets have the same back now heres the chopper itself i love the design of it it isnt quite minifig scale but its great all the same this is my first nonxpod or house creator set and it sure is fun here me and iamded go for a dizzy ride i love the nose of the copter and the landing gear is fantastic a shot from the other side oh dear it seems weve been a bit sick from that ride and were vomiting transgreen 1x1s the cargo itself is nicely made though i forgot to put on two tiles here   it fits in real well with the chopper to and the line is great for giving iamded the wedgie he deserves this is my first power function set so i was pretty excited the motor is intergrated really well into this set and is activated by pushing that little 3x2 plate with the 1x1 slopes on it forward until it hits the motor button that orange knob another point of interest is the use of bley barrels on each side i like this as i dont have those pieces in that colour a shot of the motor its really simple all you do is pull the hook out to any length that allows then press the orange button and it will wind it back up this makes the chopper pull the cargo up into its bay and iamded pull me here reluctantly to a whacking a top view is that my head a view of the chopper without the cargo in it i love the lowered cockpit the leftover pieces from building note iamdeds head does not count as set piece and a final shot of the set with me and iamded oh it appear were dead oh dear hope you enjoyed this review soon i will post the two alternate models i loved this chopper its great to play with and has nice construction it also has some handy pieces too the motor function sounds like a gimmick but is well intergrated into this model well worth the price so far this is another win for creator i say so far i recommend this model but later well see if the alt models are up to scratch also since this is my first review comments and criticism welcome on everything batbrick away  edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0637 pm indexed	positive

wow i remember this set from when i was a kid i got it for my birthday and opened the package first sadly i had to go to school so i had to leave it at home and not build it or play with it until i got home needless to say that was one of the longest days of school ever good review great set	positive
i bought one of these new from bricklink a few months ago as part of my pirate splurge i went on i really enjoyed this set because of the amount of figs in such a small set though pirates were always pretty good about their fig count also the neat little hut is nicely done for its purpose great review btw	positive

so here it is finally my first ever review of a lego setoh wait its actually 2 sets so i dont really know how to do it right but ill try the best sorry if some pictures are a litte bit dark but im not really into photography and i got bad light here lets start with the dwarfs mine defender theme castle 2008 set name dwarfs mine defender number 7040 pieces 86 price 999 eur first as always the box the back a few instructions on how the defender works for those how dont know   and the instructions we continue with the minifigs sorry i forgot to make a closeup of the dwarf and finally the mine defender itself i personally think it isnt as bad as maybe some people think the chain for the catapult is great i think i kinda love those controls the mechanism with the rubbe rband actually works pretty well but only on a notglossy underground thats pretty much all of it its small but i like it a lot so lets go on to the tower raid now which would be my absolute favorite of those new sets  theme castle 2008 set name tower raid number 7037 pieces 364 price 2999 eur again first the box  instructions we got 2 sets of instructios here one for the tower and one for the siege tower the minifigs we got one archer and one soldier here both with the torsos of the 2007 sets now thw orc side starting with the great leader with the new armor and the golden helmet i love those pieces closeup of the armor  helmet then we got another orcknight and the prisoner with handcuffs the crownie tower looks great overall though there is something i dont really like about it but later on that now the back and that is what really bothers me there areno walls on the first floor except the one with the wallpiece and the door and theprison also is open at the back the orc easily could jump out there not sure what these are all about they really dont add much to the set enough rant now lets go on with a pretty sweet detail the golden crystal on the little table the wall piece on the first floor you can ram in and finally the very best thing of this set the amazing orc siege tower from the front the great working ram you can pull it back very far and it got pretty much power here we got another sweet detail the siege platform that moves out by pulling a cord in the back of the tower finally a picture of a bit siege action if you ram in the lower wallpiece the brown shelfs of the prisonfloor collapse and the prisoned orc is finally free summary likes as i mentioned before i really think thats the best ever produced siege tower its got so mich details and works extremely well also the overall look of it is magnificant the destroymechanism of the tower is pretty cool too the brown door is a fine detail too nothing much to say about the mine defender i like this little set and theres nothing really to bother about it dislikes the back of the tower thats really the only thing thats a bit bad imo they could have put there 2 more walls on the first floor and something to lock the prison easily final thought the tower raid for me personally is the best of the 2008 sets so far its got great playability and looks simply good my opinion buy it	positive
great review pictures and all thanks for showing all the mechanisms of the tower i didnt notice them from either the pics we had or the instructionsit didnt hit me that when you knock down the wall the second floor breaks that is a genius idea this looks like a superb set unfortunately my priority right now is the troll warship still if that really is us 80 i might skip it and go for this instead which is only 20 us one note though i think there might not be a back cage on the second floor of the tower so that the mechanism can work did you try to see if the second floor ground still falls if you add it a fourth cage wall also you could just pretend that the tower is built against a mountainside it would fit perfectly and add more defense to the knights great review  vk	positive
tks for those so much  y nice reviews i love that tower raid and the defender and will buy them both quote really dont add much to the set oh but they do more pieces higher price 	neutral
thank you for these fine reviews metalandi y therere really some nice playable features in the tower raid set and all these great orc torsos just sweet and it even looks like that black orcarmors a new piece lovely 	positive
thanks metalandi these are 2 great sets im definately looking forward to seeing these in new zealand stores the collapsing floorprisoner freeing mechanism on the tower is wonderful a great touch some slight modifications like some walls will make this perfect and the dwarfs mine defender is a sweet little set with some neat minifigs thanks for the reviews y peace	positive
thanks for the review i personally think the siege tower is probably the best one which lego has ever produced	positive
well i dont think orcs are that sturdy seeing that theyd have to jump from the second level of the tower i dont see survival as his chief objective p awesome review im loving these sets more and more the tower raid is definitely the best and the cheapest set there  oh and pirhana its not really a king its more like an officer remember the wizard rules these goblins edited by trooperdavinfelth 22 february 2008  0249 pm	positive

xwingyoda on mar 1 2008 0632 am said its still looks good but the crappy rubber band system is really not well thought off yoda i totally agreed with your comments the rubber system is not effective at all i bought 2 defenders recently and i found out that when the wheels move the rubber just stuck there without rotating the blades at the front  i have not really found a solution for mine yet so far i only took out the rubber band placing the blades on the ground removing of the red technic part on the left side in this way when the defender is moving on smooth ground the blades will move too 	negative

thanks for reviewing all these old sets will you be doing any more	positive
nice pictures i also sort out the pieces the same way if im rebuilding a model y this set packs a lot of functionality into a fairly small size but was rather expensive for its size 70 when it was still available compared to other sets of that time you can also rig up the technic flag sticker that it comes with to the main model ive done that on mine you may want to reinforce it with tape if youre going to leave the model on display though as it will break up over time due to uv exposure like many stickers do i had to do that with mine after it started to crack although it still looks pretty good	positive
the only original stickers are the front headlightpatterns on the 2 red 1x2 bricks the others have been destroyed  must have been the bad decaying sticker quality that breaks when youll remove it  so i printed them i didnt print the flag for only the alternate model needs it although its a neat idea and lordgalewind clickey i keep that in mind one of my 8880 is already dusty enough	negative
thanks for reviewing this classic set i got it when it first came out and still love it the suspension steering and robust look of the model havent been done that well ever since this set puzzled me though back in the days the rear suspending part containing the differential and some gears was shown different on the box from the instructions in the instructions it showed that the grey part of the suspension in the back had to be made using a 1x2 smooth tile and 4 cornerplates 2x2 in grey the box however showed a much sturdier solution using a 1x8 tile and a 1x8 plate it is also visible on the cover of the instructions the pieces i mean are in this picture bernddasbrot on mar 9 2008 0705 pm said otherwise great set	positive
thanks youve just motivated me to go on a senselesspreliminarydesignerrorshunt a few things ive discovered left side alternate model the steering link can only be put in place with a little violence the handlebar  is turned far more than its actually possible although the wheels are straight right side the 1x8 tile simonwillems pointed out the half bush right next to it is cantfindthewords wrong could be that the technic triangle is missing the windscreen 1x6 technic plates are mounted with 12 pins instead of axle pins with half bushes who can find more xd	neutral
natelite on mar 10 2008 0557 pm said hmm seems like the wheels are recycled into the harley truck in the 2008 batman set nope the harleytruckwheels are thinner and somewhat more modern i do believe theyre the same like in 8274 aaaaaaaand for a long time in my life these wheels have been the best and coolest looking ive ever had so wheres your deference d recycled  xd	positive
wow that first picture is great you must have a very wide angle lens with the capability to focus very close macro the perspective makes the model look huge nice work i think the suspension on this set is my favorite of all technic it has such large travel and is so what word should i use bouncy hey why do you only review sets which are red d eric	positive
bernddasbrot on mar 10 2008 0141 pm said at my school leaving examination i made a model in blender3d and explained to the board of examiners how to build a car and how to animate it it needed a color so i took red because all beautiful and fast cars are red my physics teacher contradicted  did you use ferrari to prove your point any physics teacher would have to admit that a really fast car approaching the speed of light will always look red as it drives away due to red shift xd on the other hand 8880 looks pretty fast and it is black although i have seen pictures of one that someone built in red yellow might be good too some cars even look fast in green eric	neutral
i can remember that ive seen a few color variations on brickshelf and on ebay they sold well its new and familiar at the same time that makes it more interesting	positive
reread your review today great pictures this is a fabulous model got this model a few months ago for just € 25 it is small and has great working parts i love the way the frontsuspension is made epic i only had the lightstickers replaced with transclear bricks btw the gear rack has been used in this years 8048 buggy	positive

hello my dear friends heres something new i am actually making a review with pictures yes i got a new camera for christmas now i was testing to see how the camera would reflect so some of the pics are a bit blurry i have based this review from dunamiss reviews he is my inspirationso without further ado i bring you the review set  7693 name etx alien strike price 1999 1299 pieces 246 box okay so as you can see below the box is pretty simple as always european versions wont have the piece count name etc just the number i believe mine having the american version has the info on it as you can see it has the classic mm logo and the red planet as well as the set in a pose itself very nice i linked it because the pic wasnt resizing httpwwwbrickshelkedscn0017jpg below is the back of the box it shows the other sets and some features of this set contents next we have the contents this set includes a medium sized dss xwingyoda a bag labeled one and huge bag labeled two the 1 bag contains a smaller bag and the two bag includes two smaller bags 5 bags in all also pictured are the instructions i have linked it due to the nonresize httpwwwbrickshelkedscn0019jpg figs included in this set are three figs two jellies and 1 astro the jeelies are fine but i pefer the lom ones but they glow those new alien commanders for summer look promising though the astro is nice and includes an extra gold visor moc on astro miner in all mm sets there is a human and alien set the astro par of this set is a miniminer here is a pic of construction and that wonderful space logo sticker not much of a cockpit  finished minerthe set number too overall i like the miner and it is nicely designed i feel the cockpit is lacking though aliens the alien vehical is the main part of the set this pic shows the beginning steps solid and sturdy but those four axlespin partsblue are pointless no support and they dont get used at all nice tlc  now we get cooking this pic shows the tail added on and the more bulk being built we get a little repetitive and build the craft up in this pic and this pic from the instructions shows how the alien craft transforms for battle the completed set and extra bits parts 810 figs 810 price per piece ration 910 playability 910 overall 85 the alien craft is great the attack feature is nice and there are a ton of trans green parts the alien falls out of the cockpit when turned upside down i love this set and its perfect for mm fans or beginnersit has nice parts and read the above part for more details gallery when moderated keep an eye out for future reviews please comment 	positive
a nice review well done y the set itself doesnt look quite interesting to me compared with some of the newer ones like 7647 or 7648 the way the driver fits into the cockpit looks not very clever and pretty uncomfortable as well xd	negative
thanx for the review i have one question do these aliens have moving arms as far as the set goes i think lego did a bad job on the alien ship i dont think any of the alien ships look good in mars mission the human fanction got a lot better this year and i would have bought this buggy if it came by its self	negative
cool review makes me want to get the set y	positive
well as bad a concept aliensvshumans is for a theme i really do like this set the human rover has nice parts for reuse especially those oldschool space wheels and despite those wobbly wings i really like the alien ship goes from a flying saucerish shape to a spread winged almost raven shape very ominous and cool looking now that alien commander is terrible if i dont buy bionicle minifigs already why would i be interested in that thing kinda wish theyd take the drones from the retiring exoforce theme and do them in green theyd make nice alien robot things	positive
a great review for a great set sweet i too own it and its still in one piece  kliq on mar 13 2008 0520 am said the only negative for me is the cockpit of the mining unit not really because it isnt detailed but because mine is top heavy and keeps falling forward its kinda funny if you think about him driving along and then falling forwardbut not funny at all when youre playing  may i suggest this mod httpwwwbrickshelycgii2848762	positive

i dont own the 8296 but what i can see from the pictures i would say that 8296 is very similar to 8829 the only things that are different ist that 8296 is studless and features a steering wheel for the seat but 8829 has got bigger wheels  it also would have been nice if the wheels from 8296 could have the same tread	neutral
toaofjustice on mar 21 2008 0810 am said that looks like a very nice set  in your opinion how does it compare to the current dune buggy toa of justice imho 8829 is much better than 8296 first 8829 is a lot bigger i really like the huge rear balloon tires they both have rack and pinion steering and they both have trailing arm rear suspension with a v2 engine i think the body on 8829 is a little more well done for 8296 i think the alternate tractor model is much better for more comparisons see technicopedia eric	positive
blakbird on mar 22 2008 0949 pm said one thing i noticed is that a bunch of your pictures are missing the beam that goes over the left hand wheel as a fender oh no i forgot to put it back i wanted to make a photo with this beam alone 8 blakbird said what kind of camera do you use the pictures have very good depth of field meaning that both the foreground and the background are in good focus this is usually hard to do without a very small aperture the camera belongs to my dad its a panasonic lumix dmcfz30eg blakbird said one of them works well mated with an 8 tooth on parallel axles and the other one doesnt the difference is only supposed to be longer teeth so it really should not matter but it does if your set works bad try switching the crown gear to one of the other variety worked for me wow youre right never thought of that thanks i made a scan  of those two gears you can notice the longer teeth first pic edited by bernddasbrot 23 march 2008  0303 pm	neutral

hi this is my forth preoldschool review as promised a yellowset  my 8862 arrived today survived the washing machine coaster and actually was real fun to build 1 information this set contains 664 parts only i thought i’d be far more and was released in 1989 in the technic theme be sure to visit technopediaif you want to know more 2 building instructions wow these instructions are used im not used to this after all this sets with unread instruction booklets the pneumatics page the last step for the alternate model 3 the parts wow look at all those technic beams gears pins a few parts are missing in this photo 3 building the left worm gear is for the outriggers the right one for turning the “rear boom” the three 12l axles left one outriggers middle one steering right one erm… rearboomrotation the two worm gears in the front part left one lifting the bucket right one dumping the bucket the turningmechanism for the “rearboom” is finished once again a toothed 10l axle the boat weight 2x6x2 is hidden underneath the radiator grill okay… many hoses and a nice comfy seat have been added now you can recognize the backhoes real shape only with a little violence it’s possible to lift the bonnet  through the pneumatic pump yeah outriggers same technique that the 8854 uses the finished “boom  jib  scoop thing” bjst  xd the finished loader bucket and to end the building process the same picture from the introduction offtopic “it is all part of the miracle of nature  the circle of life” 4 functionality this time i tried something new i hope you can spot something  if not technopedia okay here we go 5 random shots i’ve got way too many pictures this time so i refer to my brickshelf folder until it’s moderated you can follow the multilingual links eins deux three quattro fem zes sédem osiem 6 final thoughts definitely worth buying as a child i thought it looks hideous  but today i’ve found out it’s totally fun to build and freaking functional three things i want to mention though the bjst can only be slewed a new word if the outriggers are deployed it is also possible that the bjst will reach the ground danger of grinding or sticking even if the outriggers are deployed the two mechanisms for the loader bucket can actually interlock and the 14 tooth gears might break  disentangle from the axle thanks for viewing the pictures i hope you enjoyed it please comment if you want to	neutral

a great review for a great set it even had the old technic tpieces and bevels which i actually prefer to their modern counterparts cp5670 on mar 24 2008 0814 am said the turntable on the back doesnt turn very well though as the weight is all distributed on one side the screw axle prevents it from popping off but there is still a lot of friction in it i got mine for £20 in a second hand shop it said complete but one of the screw knuts was missing xo so its practically impossible to keep the back arm on with only one  and theyre rather rare on bl too 	positive

blakbird on mar 25 2008 0642 pm said wow thats a long exposure i would think you would get way too much light and overexpose the image the aperture must have been tiny for the aperture i dont know what ive used but my room was already very darkend as i tool the photos it was actually serendipity  blakbird said cool i am also planning to write about the combine on technicopedia i will but ill need some time i really shoud do a few things for university thats also the reason why i succeded in so many other things   blakbird said you dont own 8480 that is unacceptable it is imperative that you put a mortgage on your house immediately to get it not again sing just kidding my parents will xd  blakbird said while the assembly you have drawn would work as a linear actuator i would not recommend it the torsional stiffness and strength of an axle are proportional to the polar moment of inertia a section property most of the stiffness comes from the outside of the cross shaped axle but in the threaded axle you lose all the stiffness of the outer area because it is not continuous this means you only get stiffness and strength from the small core i think the threaded axle would bend and break very easily if subjected to much torque the toothed 10l axle doesnt look very robust youre right on brickshelf i once saw another version using a worm gear and a halfbush being moved along another axle edited by bernddasbrot 28 march 2008  0512 pm	neutral

thanks for the review mate i may get this as well so i can get racer x axctually i see what tlcs done here splitting up the two more wellknown characters speed and racer x so you have to get both sets matn on mar 25 2008 0809 am said lego should have used this for their helmets you can put a protectingglassesdont know the name in front of it visor id have to agree with you with regards the helmet i wouldve preferred this especially for speed interestingly my pocket knife is the same as that one i didnt count its appearances though	neutral
speaking of pocket knives i just got speed racer and snake oiler at kmart and might mod the helmet so it actually looks like the cartoon the problem is  i dont want to shell out two bucks for a clear visor  by the way i know transclear visors are nonproduction but where did they come from a pickabrick if so what store well at least if i do go through getting the elusive clear visor its not as bad as the insane 25 red vader helmet this set is great i would have gotten this along with the one i purchased but i didnt have enough dough with me to get both	positive

enchanted island 6278 pictorial review original price 66 pieces 412 figures 7 this 1994 set marked the beginning of a new era for lego pirates  it became a theme more centralised around playability and not so much grand ol ships 6278 enchanted island was the flagship set of the islanders subtheme heavily based around polynesian and native american concepts in fact tlc was successfully sued by a number of tribes for using bastardised maori names such as kahuka it was released as a legend set in 2001 but due to poor sales was discontinued again the largest of the islander sets enchanted island is a portion of an island with a river running through the left hand side features some sturdy buildings built into a treelike structure on a rocky outcrop whilst the left hand side features a tower built out of wooden posts and a large tribal statue the box cover shows all the details it does however differ from the instructions finished product in that it has been more aesthetically arranged  bushes etc have been moved to fill in gaps and to not obscure other things the sides of the box show nothing particularly special although in one scene it depicts the islander canoe chasing the pirate boat with the treasure just one way to play with the set the back of the box however is superb featuring a large number of alternative models a toothy statue a pirate tree think wolfpack with an islander base kahukas throne a firebreathing statue and a soupedup boat for the pirates these and many more can be easily made because of the large diversity of pieces the set has a huge number of minifigures for its size the third highest number in the pirate range the ses and the bsb being first and second respectively  a whopping 7 5 islanders including the alltoocommon king kahuka the elusive islander babe and 3 standard warriors  this set alone will never leave you short of enemies 2 pirates ironhook in his standard attire with a scurvy dog at his side attack the island although they are only moderately armed  2 cutlasses and a pistol between them a musket wouldve been nice the islanders on the other hand have 4 shields a bow and quiver and 6 spears not to mention the big pokey thing with horns on top weapon idol staff a monkey parrot and crocodile provide the obvious creature features with a fair amount of gold to finish off in the instructions the goblet does not have the lid although it does on the box its a nice touch anyway  adding a little more diversity to the monotonous treasure stashes the pirates boat is a nice 2 sail vessel with oars for when the wind stops and a treasure map the sails are similar to those in lagoon lockup but with an extra front sail its an awesome little boat better for raids than a rowing boat but not too big that it cant sail up rivers it can comfortably fit 2 men and at a squeeze 5 the sails are expensive if you buy them seperately normally this wont be a problem but they can cost aroun 5 each the islanders boat is a canoe with a sail and an outrigger to stabilise it the sail is beautifully done with 2 spars taughtening it there is a clip for the rower to leave his weapon when at se and the mast can turn to get as much wind as possible its quite a topheavy boat but it doesnt look hideous and without the mastsail it looks great 3 islanders can fit in it and more if they sit on the outrigger the markings on the canoe are stickers but they look fine and are probably more robust than markings for their job furthermore theyre waterproof sing kahukas throne can be carried by 2 loyal subjects or strapped to his pet crocodile the clips on the side can be used to rest his weaponry or hold spears for battle the throne looks nice although im not too sure about the blue against the red  id have prefered white as it would clash less an overview of the island it is built in 2 halves  left then right and then joined together loosley so it can be seperated for transporting around the back to the left and right there are large open spaces that are great for battles  this set isnt so much about a large solid build but creating a village  smaller structures linked by bridges and the back to the far left is a platform built onto the rock with access from the river via a ladder theres the standard islander drum with the lovely zebraskin part where did they get that ive never understood the white flag  i was under the impression it was used for surrender further along the rocky bank there are some hinged palm leaves that swing upwards to reveal the treasure its an ok hiding place not the best place to hide it right where the pirates sail past but it feels fabulous it fits right in above it on the rocky bank is the main structure it looks very disjointed when you build it bricks all over the place but once its done it looks nice and rural with leaves everywhere and the balcony where kahuka is standing you get a nice roof made from 2 large palm leaves tilting down around the back theres a slight shelter a table for picnics and a ladder to access the upstairs i was rather annoyed that it is so open but the set is designed from just one perspective to the left is the bridge to the other building a nice one piece bridge made of the softer plastic used for muskets and the post1991 cutlasses it looks good but be warned it tilts when you pull a pin sending the pirates flying this contraption is a good idea but it is very stiff and so doesnt swing even when burdened by a minifigure  youll want to modify this bit if you get it the other building looks like it is made out of posts and beams they are all red brown would have been better but it would have added too many colours to the range just like the use of black for trees in some forestmen sets there are 3 clips for spare weapons only 2 of these will ever be used when all the islanders are armed but it gives the pirates scope once theyve been disarmedtheres another nice palm tree roof on top 2 ladders give accesstheres a total of 4 in this set  worth getting eh although theyre 5p on bricklink for a kabob theyre like gold at the top theres another hidey hole the palm leaves lift up on hinges to show the treasure or hiding islander it can be seen from behind but this set is designed from one perspective only nice cattlehorns tooalongside the slats you can see in the floor  5 years later and it wouldve been a solid plate the big statue is one of the main selling point of this set alongside the tilting bridge  theyre the action features shown in every catalogue at the time but it is not really special just original the statue fits in with the theme perfectly  kahukas mask his shield and this statue all depict the same deity which is a nice collectible idea the back is rather plain except the angled 1x1 bricks  a good touch im not sure why theres a black brick in the back of the head but this is easily remedied it could even be done with a brick from this same set just swapping the two over aside from the head turning the back can open to store sacred objects or in my opinion prisoners hence the gaps for breathing either way its a lovely piece of architecture and deservedly a flagship element of the set theres your standard cooking pot floating around although a 1x1 yellow stud as human flesh remember minifigs are yellow no matter what the licensed themes say is a superb finish this set is a stunning set for both kids and afols who are just getting back into legopirates  it is a great army builder and due to its release as a legend is extremely cheap on ebay  you should be able to pick one up for £18 or £15 if youre lucky for that you get a lifetimes supply of islanders 4 ladders some wall panels 2 baseplates one raised and both with rivers and printed vegetation around the edge a ton of weapons a fair quantity of standard bricks but most of all a heap of vegetation this is an easy to buy set with normally around 5 on ebay at any time and is well worth it for the parts the play and the nostalgia it can be easily modified when used in conjunction with any other outpost a much larger fortress can be made especially if more rope bridges are used if you pick 2 of this fine set off ebay itll still be less than the original price a huge complex can be constructed giving you an instantaneous village for around £35 other information lugnet rating

its a great set and one i have yet to add to my collection despite my large number of islander extras enchanted island aside from having so alluring a name was good value for money in that you only needed this one set and you had a good representation of the islanders both in the size of the set and the number of minifigs the flipping rope bridge and the river give it a great rainforest retreat sort of feeling and one is inclined to think of this set as more inland than directly coastal for me whilst the islanders were never seen in the same light or popularity as pirates and imperials they were an obvious and colourful addition that to me added a whole new depth to the pirate system and one was now able to play a 3 or 4 way war adding a greater political element to the sets enchanted island is probably the 3rd most appealing of the large land bases for me after port royal and eldorado fortress good review and glad to see the set recognised	positive
everytime i saw this at a toy store i always cried to my parents for one but never got it i got the smaller islander sets but the more i see this now i dont want it i could buy it but naahh i am hoping lego does an updated version of the islanders with this new pirates line one can hope right xd	neutral
hello eldiano although the review is fine and you have memories related to that set please have in mind that the post you were replying to was in fact some 7 years old this is what we call bumping of old topics and it shouldnt be done you might want to take a look at our faq posting tips and etiquette edited by phred 06 april 2015  0347 am by phred read next post please	neutral
i realized that building the chess set from the new pirates theme they are two grey heads that reminded me of the king kahuna throne which goes to say that i am hoping they bring back new sets i just wish they were bigger i would love to build the old ones but i would side more towards the newer model if they ever released them	negative

casewindu on mar 30 2008 0817 am said judging from your pictures there seems to be many interesting torsos and new fleshy heads but i dont think this set is for me fueling my dismissal of this set is that i saw the trailer for this film at the cinema today and it looked pretty terrible x thanks for taking your time to review this set though ricecracker  they are still good sets even though the movie might be crap  geez its not like we buy swl because the movie is good xd anyway thanks for myour time rice cracker	negative
sorry to bump such an old thread but i´ve just discovered this set is on sale at amazonde  for a mere 25 euros i am tempted not because i like the set or the models but because of the parts as most of you might know i´m especially into exoforce so would you recommend to get this set just for the parts are they a good choice to combine with efsets would anyone of you be interested in obtaining the fleshieparts of the minifigs from me as i totally don´t need those	neutral
i picked up this set a few weeks ago along with the smaller sets that come with the mach 5 and racer xs car and i was pleasantly surprised the commentators stand is nothing to write home about but the assortment of figs is great numerous new face prints in flesh i believe and in spite of the large amount of stickers the three cars are each unique and very welldesigned my only gripe about them is that cannonball taylors car the black and yellow one was a missed opportunity as in the movie its yellow and purple i know tlc is dropping purple for the future and had a bunch of problems with it in the past but it would have made for a great looking car imo	positive
such on 07 july 2011  0850 am said an opportunity has come up to buy this set for 100 aud just wondering whether people think its worth buying ive heard very little about the speed racer legos this comment does not seem a good reason for reviving a 2 and a half years old topic to me please avoid doing so in the future	negative
somehow i competely missed your review when you first made it i saw your pics on brickshelf and wondered about the review you have managed to review my all time favourite technic set it was the first large technic set i was given by my parents when it first came out in 1995 i played for hours with this set making minifig seats in it it was so huge there was room for four minifigs to sit next to eachother in front i made various applications for it a bungeejump system with a large rubber band and lots of containers to be lifted the first changes i made included the inverting of the wheels and the disabling of one of the flashlightsteering wheels because they obstructed eachother by the way the nob for your winch is yellow instead of black i know this set by heart so watch out p  i always liked those nobs i do own the 8421 and i can tell you this 8460 is much much stronger it can carry more weight because the boom is lighter then the 8421 they are powered by the same two pistons you know when you made it right when the crane is in upright position fully extended and you release the brake from the winch does the hook lower without having to pull it if it does you succeeded in constructing the set right the alternate model was great fun too the pump is cleverly hidden and the crane folds up great between the cab and the loading platform you could easily mod it with a pneumatic claw on the crane a motor to turn it and a compressor the only flaw was the loading platform which had no floor only some axles thanks so much for reviving my memorie concerning this great set y	positive
im in the same situation as you i have this set but missed out on the newer 8421 this was a great set for its time but the 8421 definitely looks better to me ive been trying to find a good deal on it on ebay but its pretty expensive considering that it only went out of production last year quote inlay i wonder why tlg doesn’t make inlays anymore… they’re noisy and brake easily but are great for pre sorting the box designs in general are crappier these days than they used to be 10 years ago you dont see the old featured parts trays anymore and the boxes dont have the different sections either these also acted as internal supports for larger boxes so they were less prone to being crushed the cardboard material is also quite a bit thinner i think its a result of tlcs overall costcutting moves since then most people toss the boxes and probably dont care but i keep all of them there was actually a time when the boxes used to be even stronger i have an old 8859 set and the outer box is made of a hard styrofoam material although they probably stopped using that for environmental reasons edited by cp5670 06 april 2008  1013 pm	neutral
front on apr 6 2008 0519 pm said btw boxes are expensive so at a given price point its a choise between more bricks or nicer boxes i have no doubt what most people would chose yeah its certainly understandable why they did it but bad for box hoarders like me p	positive

the rancor on apr 15 2008 1011 pm said im pretty sure those ants are actually spiders i thought they were spiders before but when i saw them mentioned as ants i realised that they are definately ants being a big ant fan i recognise that they are not spiders  they look like ants too and they could be lifesize to some larger species yay ants and new hairpieces and accessories	positive

erdbeereis1 on apr 15 2008 1125 pm said actually they are ants spiders have 8 legs while ants have only 6 like these the two thing that look like legs in the front are the antennae back on topic i think this set looks great and i cant wait until i can get my hands on it and the other new ij sets they must be ants but im pretty convinced that what you think are the antennae are the ants mandibles a neat little set front	positive

set ref 7625 name river chase number of minifigs 4 number of pieces unknown price 2290€ a general view of the set we’ve got an amphibious vehicle a small boat an observation post and a dark green croco so beautiful  for the figs we’ve got indy of course marion and two russian soldiers nothing special here in the back of the tree there is a box to put some things the amphibious vehicle is very nice the proportions are really great not too big not too small and there are a lot of details everywhere like the propeller a back view an inside view the small boat is a dark grey zodiac but the details are nice too giving it a retro look in the same way of all the indy vehicles the outpost has a net to permit to the bad guys to capture some nice guys and girls… but it seems that the girl marion is scared of the nice croco so indy comes and help her pushing the technic axle with this round inversed tiles which push out the net and capture the croco now marion feels happier and she takes a can of oil and whacks the poor croco without defences who has said marion is a nice girl so i’ve bought this set like an add on to my city in fact the elements of this set can easily be integrated in a town layout i plan to use the outpost for my forest section and the amphibious vehicle is always a nice touch of originality in a layout yes you can use all those military things without creating an army in a layout just put the violent parts out and you’ve got nice things like a biologist car in the case of the amphibious vehicle	positive

set ref 7626 name jungle cutter number of minifigs 4 number of pieces unknown price 3999€ a general view of the set we’ve got 5 giant ants two russian soldiers a general indy of course 3 trees a small entrance of a cave and the debroussaillor vehicle i don’t know the english name of it… you can’t enter into the cave because there is a spider web with its spider…unless… unless you know how the mechanism works and the spider web go up… and reveals a case with diamonds and accessories a closer view on the mechanism which is simple but works well and you can also see the difference or maybe the same size of a spider and a giant ant and i’ve always thought that those spiders were very big compared to the minifigs so those ants are really giant poor small frog the three trees with the entrance make a nice jungle layout don’t speak too loud you will wake up the soldier… don’t worry for him he will be waken up by the vehicle before being eaten by those giant ants a front view making the vehicle really menacing a back view push the red part from the back and there are two parts that fall down from the vehicle i don’t know why… the movie will clarify this i think… and here you can see how the two big circular blades turn when you push the vehicle… simple but effective run indy run this set is really nice the playability of the different elements is great the colour scheme is nice too i like those dark green tree parts the vehicle is really impressive without being too big and its very well details in general the designers of the indy sets have made a really nice works with a lot of efforts in all those details everywhere i’ve got some project for this set to integrate it in my city i’m a city mocer and not an indy fan so i don’t have bought the temple the bigger set of the series because it has nothing special for me in term of part selections or in the design in relation with the town theme and because my supermarket doesn’t have it yet so we are waiting for a member to review it and make the part 4…	positive

ah the wonderful dragon knight or was it dragon masters sets i personally preferred the black knights but these guys still had some awesome sets thanks for this review this looks like a neat little set although those modern stairs look a little out of place that tree design is indeed a neat one i remember having that in one dark forestmen set i got the interior sure is roomy may i suggest for future review you photograph the set on a cleared table that way you wont get distracted by the clutter in the background and can focus on the main part of the image the set peace	neutral
i own this set and i think its a great for a smaller fortress building there is a good selection of mini figs the burps do detract somewhat from the set but they do make it feel as if its in a large cave the cloth flags that are included are really nice and mine have lasted a long time	positive
i saw this set at my tru for only 2000 now i might go get it thanks sinner for another nice review quote hoped to find a figure the right size for it but none of mine would fit well just sit your booty down and ride it wourself  okay well maybe if you have a bionicle lying around or a halo figure	neutral
a very good review thanks sinner that´s really a pretty cool model very detailed with useful parts too hmm perhaps that one´s gonna get the first technic set i´ll buy beside that 4481 hailfire droid um thank you sinner	positive
how did i manage to miss this review i must have overlooked it somehow thanks for making this one sinner its always nice to see reviews of technic sets im not so sure whether i like this set i am not that much into motorbikes but lego did a good job on this one it looks a lot like an upgraded version of one of the first bikes lego made namely the 8838 shock cycle i also believe the back gearwheel is somewhat oversized it looks better with the smaller one you attached it is good to see that lego is back to making the technic sets the way they were except for the green that is 	neutral

set 7627  indiana jones  temple of the crystal skull pieces 929 price aud14999 out of all the indy 4 sets this one seems to cop the most flak  which may account for the fact that the other 3 were reviewed weeks ago and this one has sat unloved and alone waiting for someone to turn their eye upon it or yknow buy it luckily im a sucker for spooky old temples filled with devilish traps and hidden treasures hissing fountains and overgrown foliage creepy skeletons and crumbling stonework so here it is indiana jones 7627 temple of the crystal skull part 1 the figs first off the figs  6 humans and 4 skellies or should that be skullies  indy mutt irina and that sneery russian guy thats in the 2 smaller sets nothing new here aha what have we here  two natives i wonder if hair is a sign of power in this culture since one guy is completely bald and the other one has the most extraordinarily luxurious black mullet somehow i doubt the movie will answer this question back view  as you can see the scalp tattoos are also popular in this tribe fashion conscious note in the background the paws of the fearsome black jungle panther ie my cat curious as to see what the tribe was up to also dont ask me why these guys are carrying axes rather than say spears and what everyones been waiting for the skullies  three of em and a conquistador skellie  very cute note the backs of the crystal head have a plumesized hole  or maybe thats just where they injected the blue brainplastic spooky i love these skulls i wasnt sold from the initial pics but they have a very creepy smile and the head shape is just weird with the large eyes its kind of homer simpsonesque and here we have the token vehicle in the set  a weird little tank thing with treads kind of looks like a cross between the amphibious boat and a minitank im sure theres a military expert around here who can tell us exactly what it is supposed to be the treads are nice but the rest of it is a bit thrown together you can tell they wanted to keep the dark green colour scheme but the budget only allowed them 5 parts to do so  all in all a mixed bag with the figs 4 repeats from the cheaper sets which means we have one new native figure and the crystal skullies there are heaps of the oldskool skele heads scattered around the sets so those that prefer can replace the skullies with ordinary skellies bizarrely the top of the box which has the line of 11 figs pic you know what i mean doesnt have names for any of the characters whereas all the smaller sets do part 2 box parts front of box back of box two instruction books parts this set has come under criticism for being overpriced  myself included  but the official piece count is 900 plus which is pretty good considering it also contains the baseplate 6 big bags and 2 of those 12x12 bricks in dark tan note set does not contain live black jungle panther™ the dss helpfully comes prescrunched thanks to tlc even in a aud150 set they cant get that right sigh the dark tan baseplate say what you like im in love i know some people dont like these but they were such a staple of castle pirates for so many years that i dont consider them a juniorised piece at all this one recycled from the 05 police hq and 06 hospital is much better in design than the king leos castle one as the different heights and asymmetry make it look much more like a natural piece of ground perfect for mocs and its dark tan  how could anyone not love such a huge slab of dark tan note this love doesnt extend to applying the stonework stickers which are frankly crap random instructions page part 3 temple of doom  or just a doomed temple the complete set front view isometricish view back view top view first impressions its very dark tan isnt it and green and bright green and dark green and dark red and normal tan and dark bley and pearl gold in fact its a bit of a mishmash of colours im of two minds about this i kind of prefer the palette to be a bit subtler but i can see that a playset designed for kids isnt going to sell bucketloads all tastefully done in shades of tan with lashings of darkgreen foliage theres a huge amount of dark red in this set which is always a welcome colour but im not convinced it quite works with the 2 shades of tan on offer here on the plus side theres also a huge amount of dark tan in ordinary 2x2 bricks tiles plates and 1x1 and 1x2x3 slopes which is great for anyone wanting to stock up lets take a closer look ill do this roughly in order of the build itself a the big scary face this is a simple fun build and very effective at projecting menace at the temple entrance it actually detaches very easily from the temple as pictured on the box art to allow easier access to the inside the eyes are flickfire missiles with scary faces hair conveniently providing ammo refills should you run out all in all from me b the back spin the skelly head and stone steps appear  we havent seen this feature in a while nice to get these pieces in dark bley a conquistador hides under the stairs  this is a bit useless as the stairs cant fully extend while hes there  moving right a trapdoor  what could possibly be behind it answer not much really a little red stair i really like these 2 stickers though  very intricate the staircase leads to what i like to think of as the crystal skull transmogrification chamber now i know nothing about the movie except that its supposed to be have a kind of 50s bmovie plot rumoured to feature look away spoilerhaters aliens these weird creepy gold chairs look made from the bones of aliens if you ask me with their strange vertebrae and silver claws it wouldnt surprise me if bringing these aliens back to life was part of the plot of the movie hence the crystal skull i guess well find out may 22 in any case transforming aliens clearly like a disco whirl as when you pull the handle the whole of this assembly spins giddily around a very clever and simple trick  its basically just a wheel under the platform but the effect is great also under here is a bottomless pit stickered i would very much expect a villian to be thrown down it at some point so do you come here often i dont know who designed this club these chairs are really uncomfortable nb i am really really over those pearl gold 1x2 roof corner slopes which started popping up in the 2006 castle range infected exoforce and have now spread here can we please have these in a different colour or a different pearl gold piece pretty please  c left tower looking from the front a small tower with a trans clear gem d right tower waterfall with booby trap i like the sticker its very cartoony which fits with the set somehow when you turn the wheel flick fire missiles spray out and hit whoever is on the stairs both towers have a trap where if you move the skull another one pops out from the dragon mouth e central turret thing this thing is kind of annoying and doesnt really sit or work well its kind of like a laser beam sending messages to space i guess as the central dome rises the two plates peel away i find it is a little bit tight to work smoothly and the two plates doesnt really sit well together at the top maybe i just need to rebuild it im sure this will also be explained in the movie f final trap  the stair that isnt there the final trap is at the front  as indy goes down the staircase you can push the red heads and all the 1x8 bley bricks come tumbling down simple and works well g alternate view heres how it looks as pictured on the box with the head removed as you can see this allows better access to the centre of the temple as you can see sadly there is nothing actually interesting there except a staircase to the turret and 2 dark tan slopes which are just stuck there and look a little out of place i mean come on everything else has a splash of dark red and gold your destination nowhere part 4 in conclusion so after all those endless pics what about the set itself consas a playset 7627 doesnt quite make sense admittedly the traps that are there are welldesigned and unobtrusive on the other hand theres a great big whopping entrance at the front  but i wasnt sure if the figs are supposed to sneak in through the backdoor and go up the spiral staircase and past the waterfall as shown in the box art or if they were meant to end up in the golden skull room the middle area doesnt really connect with anything nor does the giant space turret it may be that some of these questions are answered in the film but whereas with 7624 7625 and 7626 i could at least picture a story myself eg with river chase is fairly obvious whats happening  a chase down a river with a croc and a communist staking them out the temple set is a little all over the place the design feels a little off to me  not really bad but not really great either pros on the plus side the natives and crystal skulls themselves are great at 900 pieces this is also a great parts pack for dark tan dark red plant pieces gold oddments etc i especially love the baseplate in that shade i like the overall shape of the temple  a big staircase with secret nooks and crannies the build is reasonably interesting and there are some clever tricks with the traps but upon reflection i shouldnt have to sell this set  it should be able to sell itself as i said before im a huge fan of dark mysterious old temples so for that i have to give it some love it reminds me of the big old adventurers sets and the whiff of nostalgia is itself a powerful intoxicant however for the price lego is selling it in australia europe canada i couldnt recommend it as a mustbuy for full price when the smaller sets in this series are themselves so good review done  woo edited by imperialshadows 01 june 2008  1159 am	positive
the figs look great the natives and the skeleton conquistador are my favorite figures in the set the set itself is very good the interior sort of reminds me of an older style lego set for some reason it could be just me but it has a classic feel this will a great set to add to my list great review so far anyway i only saw the back of the box edited by general zen 01 may 2008  0217 am	positive

thanks for this review you have reviewed my most favourite town set of all times i am so happy to own this one i actually is a story to go along with it in the summer of 1998 i went on holiday with my parents to the country of luxembourg in the city of wiltz we encountered a small toystore which still had this set for sale 9 years after the release i did not had the sufficient amount of money to buy the set and had to leave it at the store i was practically in tears four years later we passed through luxembourg and i remembered the city and the store we made a detour and stopped by the same store every other old set was sold the only one remaining was this one i bought it immediately and treasured it ever since i use the baseplates a lot in my cities they serve well as roads with parking spaces next to them this was the first set i owned which had the huge 6x24 plates in them i remember my surprise when seeing plates of such enourmous lenght i recently made an entire racetrack together with this set and to promote myself i will place a link here	positive
metalandi thanks for this wonderful lovely review i enjoyed myself very much when i am looking through at the lovely pictures i must admit this is what i called a real classic race prix i miss those cute sweet little race cars which is able to contain a minifig furthermore this set offers 4 race cars and 13 minifigures in addition if town collectors remember the car number tiles are printed instead of using stickers this is the other set i owned which holds the similarity above 6381 motor speedway overall great review simonwillems on may 9 2008 0220 am said i recently made an entire racetrack together with this set and to promote myself i will place a link here i saw your entire racetrack it looks real exciting and i love your layout real nice edited by whitefang 15 may 2008  0956 am	neutral

hello all i dont believe there has been a review of this set yet so i wanted to take this opportunity up for review today is 8160 cruncher block and racer x as part of batbrick and iamded reviews here is the box i have to say i love the art on it its very colourful and makes the truck look a lot less crap than it does on the box plus you have to love the missile launching action bit right am i right why are you all staring at me and here is the back pretty generic but shows some nice details and so forth oh dear in turning around the box have i killed myself and iamded okey dokey up first is the best part of the entire set the minifigs racer x is wonderful though coming with a boring bruce wayne face but it is cruncher block his lady driver taejo that really shine look at those awesome suits the cool faces taejo has a ripped shirt now up is the first building part of the set with me and iamded looking rather slick in xs car while im not a big fan of yellow it is very nice and slopes in an underused colour is better than no slopes at all front view the new windshields are fantastic while a very cool car it is rather silly of tlc to give us the exact same one we got in the smaller set i didnt get the smaller set with this car so im still happy but it is a bad marketing move sorry iamded i know its your birthday butvroom now for the second part of the build and my favourite the front of the truck annoyingly enough this part opens up to shoot a pointless rubber projectile to do this you open the roof a nice detail btw and pull back the mechanism here thus blowing the front part open and launching itwell not far really the wheels and covers are pretty cool and the front is nicely designed the red looks good and the rear vision mirrors are a great touch and now for the most disappointing part  step three the trailer note  clicky joint piece not part of set just used to hold it up thats right almost the entire thing is open even the filled in side has holes id certainly be cared to be back there one bumpy hill and back you go i didnt put the lame computer stickers on and the control area is pretty lame in general not to mention taejo who is depicted on the boxart as standing at the desk would most likely just be sucked out the back at those speeds there are some pluses too though like the ridiculously awesome minifig paintings ill be using for wayne manor also note the control on crunchers desk that when turned turns the gun at the bottom its an alright feature here is an example ive shot iamded on his birthday what its a love ray havent you seen the care bears and though im not a massive fan of stickers this is just too cool the little aquarium is very simple but very clever using a printed piece between two clear windows to create the illusion of a tank it looks much better in real life trust me and here is a side view to better explain now to connect the two is a good thing i like the way a simple technic piece assumes the job oh and behold my hand the completed truck which while a mixed bag still doesnt look too bad i guess now the completed set which despite its unbelievable large flaws still looks cool warning the kickass iamded and batbrick figures do not come with this set more pics here httpwwwbrickshelycgii3147324 all in all minifigs 55  racer x is beautiful cruncher block and the driver too and taejo has a ripped shirt damn design 25  pretty poor considering the best part is available in a cheaper set and only the front part of the truck looks cool but still not truly awful build 35  despite having a bad trailer it was a fun build and sometimes you need something that doesnt take ages to make price 25  overpriced easily but rogue shadow is worse fun 35  the mere concept of such an open truck kept me playing with this baby for hours total 1525 not as bad as it would seem overall im really glad i bought it as the minifigs are fantastic and the paintings and fish tank are cool its fun stupid and downright ridiculous but while not a great set by any means certainly isnt as bad in the brick as it looks in photos until next time batbrick away edited by batbrick 13 june 2008  1220 pm	negative
ill be passing on this set thanks for the review anyway is everyone supposed to be bald in the film it looks weird	negative
thanks for the review my wife wanted me to buy this for the fishtank and i came close untimately this set didnt offer many good part to me so i bought the smaller set with the same car the trailer is just too insubstantial	negative
i bought this set a few days ago and agree with what you have said about it the trailer is fun to play with but just so plain overall great review	positive
i really like this set my favorite parts are the minifigs and xs car vrooom	positive
nice reviewim surprised these are out already ill probably end up passing on this one even with the surprise 	neutral
good review a must have for my batman collection are these sets already out in germany	positive
that is a very nice and quick review thanks for giving us a quick summary not much comments on this set as i do not really go into batman theme yet however the ice cream truck in the set interest me apart from that nothing much yet who knows maybe i will change my mind in the future	neutral
mustget	positive
great review as always although i know you dont take many pictures in your reviewsimho  but can we see a little more about the tumbler is that little windshield down near the bottom front a third seat what is in the framework of the back behind the cockpit i know theres a blunt shooter and flick fire missiles but is it all framework	neutral
brickbitz on may 16 2008 1141 pm said ill get some set up tomorrow in better light to be honest there isnt a lot to see most of it is just basic technic blocks underneath with all the slopes built up on top some more pics of the tumbler	neutral
thanks so much dunamis for your awesome review  yeah i think tlc miss the cape it would be cool to own one but when we were talking of the 2008 sets around july of last year i can remember someone said it would come with cape finally is a little dissapoint tlc miss it  edited by darkrebellion 16 may 2008  0720 pm	negative
excellent review dunamis this set looks great the designers really though the kit out it seems the internal organs have got to be my favorite part but everything is good now all we need is a ucs obiwan with a laser pistol to finish off grievous in a totally anticlimatic way	positive
i do a easy answer to you dunamis and just double post cm´s answer i was there as well copmike on may 17 2008 1242 am said nice review dunamis  i built it two weeks ago on the legoworld speedbuild in oslo and didn´t have time to get the feel during that crazy race i agree with you that the base is nice  sturdy makes it stand real still  i´m looking forward on your next score four eyes arms on copmike sturdy on ras	neutral
thanks for this very detailed review dunamis didnt think that gg were that big he looks pretty good to me but ill save the 90€ for the upcoming cw sets	positive
quote since there were links posted to the pdf files of the instructions online i’m sure you can all get an idea of the manual and the parts inventory however for those of you without access to the internet here are photos of the parts inventory pages luckily for me i have access to the internet to read this review in the first place seriously though nice review my girlfriend has told me that i cant have this one after we just got through a 3day build of the 10030 star destroyer but im sure i can turn her around eventually 	positive
this is a very nice i never gotten to chance to own or buy one of the sw big sets im definitely getting these one	positive
legoscum on may 17 2008 0403 pm said you forgot to add the stickers to the chest plates too jeremy yeah i know i mentioned it in the review that i completely blew past the other two stickers if you look closely you can see that the big grievous nameplate sticker is offcenter as well me and stickers dont get along	neutral
the walker reminds me of the old kenner cap2 captivator which is good	positive
thanks for that interesting review brickbitz the alien fighter looks pretty nice nothing special but streamlined and fast nevertheless that transforming feature´s a nice addition for sure and these new flicker missile with its launch apparatus hmm i hope i won´t spend quite some time in search of that little rocket piece however there´s still something i miss with these alien crafts i don´t know i like some more organic looking design and they even come in some nice and different shapes but still perhaps a real space fighter just needs a solid cockpit cool windscreens and controls to satisfy my odd likings that exo suit looks really good and i wonder why it´s a little underrepresented on the box art the jet packspace scooter´s a really good idea and the only thing i hate´re those darned studless technic beams it could look so much better with a studded version of these parts but of course that´s only due to my personal preferences	positive
lol your sig is awesome the little power suit is well done i would like to see articulation some how jammed into the little legs though and we all now exoforce 4 finger hands would look great on his arms edited by rayskull 18 may 2008  0451 pm	positive
excellent review as usual brickbitz i really love this set the moonwalker is amazing and the alien craft is really nice too i might get this someday	positive
the rancor on may 18 2008 0638 am said damn i was just about to post a review on this heres the infiltrator with the nice shiny holographic stickers marsmistortinyjpg theres nothing stopping you from posting a review as well	neutral
thats a great review for your first one i think the jet pack if far to bulky it could do with some minimising but that’s life i assume that you can’t fit a standard hand in the chainsaw arms are the hole would be to large but would you be so good as to confirm this for me overall i quite like the jet ski and the ability to lower the arms to much doesn’t both me how much was it just so i can get an idea of the price finally thanks for posting this review so quickly	neutral
nice first review oky wan  i´d say this is better than we first thought the minifigs looks cool and the overall look is ok and the excaustpipe is a new peace also i think agents on copmike	positive
good review thanks oky wan hmm although i really like the villain not just the new arm i think the color is very villanous as all bondvillains with class have minions in uniforms its even possible to fill out their numbers with exoforce grunts of the same color im not that hot for the agent himself his uniform nah it doesnt even look like clothes just give the man a suit or some nifty leather i think ill try to grab some sets from the agents line just for the new parts to begin with mocs may follow who knows when they are available in stores here in sweden havent seen them yet though indiana jones just got here so there might be some further waiting for me now i want to see reviews of the other sets 	negative
thanks for a very good review agent line seems better all the time looking forward in seeing review on mission 2 gold chase and new pictures of the jet really soon	neutral
hmm interesting set great review i might pick this one up for the wonderful parts vbbn	neutral
they are already on the shelfs thats kinda weird since there arent even the instructions online yet	neutral
thanks for the great review oky wan at first i didnt think i liked the agents sets but the more i see them the better i think they look i will definitely pick up 1 or 2 of the sets i really like the jet pack and the figs look great that double face is very nice tlg should make more figs with these faces in my opinion	neutral
great reviewthank youvery much i think this line is much more promising than most orginally thought it would be im onmy way to see ifican find the big rig right now	neutral
thank you for the nice review it has some big pieces i dont like but the minifigs are good	positive
looks good and ill bet that jaw and wire could be used for lots of mocs is this the only agents set that contains the wire while im here i got the third mission would anyone like a review of that faramir	positive
mmm this set looks amazing lovely pieces and i actually like the minifig faces that jaw helmet is cool aswel  are those stickers on the crocodile heads or is it printed	positive
nice set im definately gonna pick it up when i see it i like the design of the base and it comes with lots of usefull an neat pieces	positive
great looking set i’m determined to get all the agent sets this summer comments swamp towerthe barbed wire is cool but it seems like it’s only for looks bikecool looking but doesn’t seem to have any controls cybercrocswow haven’t seen any of these pieces for a while and in dark green awesome agent chargesweet head definitely cool break jawhe looks like the result of some animal testing on humans gone horribly wrong i hope they come out near me soon	positive
very useful pieces that new agent head i think its new could be used for a gordon freeman minifigure and break jaws head for otis the security guard when you take his donuts away from him	positive
great review and a good confirmation of exactly what i suspected this is a parts line for me much like exoforce before it this will be the theme i pick up when im out of other things or its on sale plus those dark green alligators bring tears of joy to an old pirate alice on may 22 2008 1243 am said i always joked that our house would have a moat around it with mechanical alligators you were joking what about the monkeys and the miniature golf course dont ruin my dreams 	positive
why do all of the reviews that we have for agents sets have the agents getting hurt is this a new trend plus unibrow man doesnt have a unibrow his eyebrows are really close together and bushy	neutral
agentrick57 on may 23 2008 0917 am said why do all of the reviews that we have for agents sets have the agents getting hurt is this a new trend no its an old trend and its because villains are cooler actually it could be longsimmering resentment towards the nothighlyregarded alpha team dino attack sets bubbling forth see dr luckys hilarious post here for an example of what i mean im sure the new agents will learn to fight back soon	negative
ive copied another thing because i dont know how i must do a review and i cant do long reviews set ref 7884 name the buggy the escape of mr freeze number of minifigs 2 number of pieces 76 price 1395€ front of the box back of the box the comic very close whats in the box without the set the set with the box the time wow this is a funny set but its a little expensive and a little to small but i like some pieces like the fire and the mr freeze gun and the best of all here it comes no stickers thats one of the greatest things but i understand why lego has made this set some people want batman lego and they are most of the time expensive and the mr freeze set is also expensive but this set not if you want more pics you msut ask for exaple for the minifigs or the mr freeze and the blaster ask it and this is my first review and sorry for the great and blurry pics the final verdict 7510 figures 810 playability 610 build 710 pieces 7510	positive
very nice review riddler	neutral
nice review thanks i really like those little gokart thingies theyve got a fantastic mario kart look to them	positive
thanks for the review ill probably get one copy of this set mr freeze and his cart look neat i dont like the huge wing on the back of batmans buggy so ill probably mod that out	neutral
thanks for the review for such a high price that we need to fork out compared to a total pieces of 76 its is very expensive to pay for such poor design but then i will still considered to get them as what sinner had said this is a very good way to get mr freeze without getting the batcave and it so happened that i do not have the batcave too i believed that is the cheapest set among the four so for the minifigs only this set is recommended other than that i am sorry	neutral
like many others ill buy this just for mr f quickly recycle the parts and pretend this set never existed the flame detail is indeed terrible the bat is back  and hes flatulent this third batwave isnt really doing anything for me ill get the penguin set as well for pretty much the same reason  although the sub on that is pretty cool  but skip the others maybe batbrick can make us all nice altmocs to improve these sets thanks for the review though	negative
thanks for the review theriddler this is a neat little set a bit overpriced in my opinion but for a new suited batman and a mr freeze fig in a set other than one of the most expensive batsets released its worth my money peace	positive
thanks for the reveiw the figs are bloody great but those cars are a bit well ill put it blantly retarded although they shall be good after some modding and whats with that grapple hook does it even have a rope so i guess batman will hokk it to mr freeze so his ride looks more ugle anyway can you pleese take some pics of the figs	neutral

yay cant wait for your review i plan to get this and the giant truck the brick rat on may 23 2008 0731 pm said 2this set contains the best lego sound brick ever its just begging to be incorporated into my arkham asylum what is a sound brick	neutral
mr mandalorian on may 24 2008 1158 am said what is a sound brick ditto maybe its like the exoforce lightup brick only with sound instead of light that would kick innapropriate word deleted	neutral
the brick rat on may 23 2008 1031 pm said 1my set came with defective instructions in 2 places pages are missing and duplicates of other pages repeated for instance the car instructions are missing steps 1621 fortunately i was able to make out what pieces went where in the missing steps by studying the illustration in step 22 i hope you have better luck with your instructions everything was just fine with my directions sounds like you just ran into some bad luck there my friend quote 2this set contains the best lego sound brick ever its just begging to be incorporated into my arkham asylum i agree 100 and i didnt even see it had a sound brick until i read this last night usually lego promotes stuff like that pretty loudly on the packaging not here though	neutral
wow thanks deino for this great review i cant wait to get this myself but right now i gotta save for the cw sets the car is with no doubt one of the most mind blowing things tlg has come up with and we can only hope that there will be more models made out of almost only metalic colors the spider cyborg while not as innovative as some of the other cyborgs is a very nice fig and his head will be very usefull for splinter cell mocs and those intake pieces are only relatively new btw they are in almost all of the current 10 racers sets any chance of you taking a pic of a lineup of all the silver parts in this set edited by oky wan kenobi 24 may 2008  1132 pm	positive

hello all eurobricks members i will present to you a very short review on the recent castle battlepacks this time i will be reviewing skeleton battlepack and i hope everyone of you do enjoy viewing it this was a request that put up by hollisbrick in the castle thread initally i thought it was a very simple set to do a review however for the love of castle i decided to whip this up for every castle fan out there this is an image of how the skeleton battlepacks look like i have bought 12 last packs of these in total so far but none of the crown battlepacks yet there were snapped much faster that i imagined do pardon me for the poor lightning today is a bad weather its hard to get natural light the skeleton gang for a single battlepack like this with an attractive reasonable price you obtained a series of 5 skeleton minifigs with tons and tons of useful castle accessories to me its a very very great buy and its a must to stock up for my army building some addons however i was not very satisfied with my skeleton armies standards therefore i decided to make some slight modifications with some additional castle accessories that is stocked in my castle warehouse after the makeover ok this is what i called a real skeleton army this is mainly my opnion and it have to be aligned with my standards i felt this improved battlepack gives a punch to the exisitng battlepack the two soliders on the right is able to align with the rest of my castle chess sets armies while the one on the left it gives me a great archer back up with the quiver and helmet attached to him the ones on the center especially the armored guard which equipped with the black nose cone helmet is my fave it is able to illustrate the elite among the rest of the guards with its armor and helmet which was featured in my castle deep forest expansion moc promotion on in addition the one which was hastly done with a modify mace it looks rather simple in time to come i will change it and gives a better equipment and look these are the remains i can use the axe for my dwarf in my dwarf mine defender in that set there is no weapon for my dwarf and i have to get it from other sets the rest of the accessories makes a very good stock up for future upgrading overall 910 this is not a playset it is mainly bought for its abilty to mass recurit any armies and is a main love for all castle army builders such as me this set mainly have no major faults and i love it so much although i have done some slight modifciations but this set is a must for me to buy more and more meanwhile i will need to wait for the next shipment hope everyone have enjoying viewing this simple review of mine edited by whitefang 25 may 2008  1252 pm	positive
dragonator on may 25 2008 0821 pm said thanks for the review whitefang i love these sets and i wish they were available in nz so far it seems they may never come here but i can sit and hope i like the look of them after your makeover a real skeleton army there did you say youve bought 12 thts lots of skelies are you planning a big moc or something no problem i had bought it last month i thought it was so simple to do a review for this was looking through the thread then i realised there is a request for it it was an unexpected shipment that send to singapore it came in very limited quantity most of the battlepacks were snapped within a day or two when it arrived well i am thinking of building something big in the future its just a plan that i have not decided yet for me i always love to see the beauty of a big army with different battalions forming a kingdom thats why i always buy many many sets that have figures that attracts me and for this battlepack it served a very good purpose for it	neutral
whitefang on may 25 2008 0614 am said for a single battlepack like this with an attractive reasonable price you obtained a series of 5 skeleton minifigs with tons and tons of useful castle accessories to me its a very very great buy and its a must to stock up for my army building i wish these battlepacks had a reasonable price click here to see the canadian price of these battlepacks 18 dollars thats 6 dollars more than the starwars battlepack yet you get the same amount of lego or less then a starwars battlepack how the megablok does lego price its items  im gonna have to skip this set and a few others that i wanted because of this bloody outrageous back on topic thanks for the detailed review whitefang i also like your little changes to the set they really make this set look better	negative
thanks for sharing these closeup images of this battlepack whitefang i actually had this set in my hand at legoland cal and could not decide if i wanted it im currently out of castlemode with my large indy jungle set up on the table and creating ghost train mocs that are starting to line up on the bookshelves once i buy the troll ship ill want to start collecting these great fig sets thanks again for sharing	neutral

vhtf very hard to find to answer some earlier replies no there are no stickers in this set while some adventurers sets of the era had stickers the 5956 zeppelin had tons all of the interesting mesoamerican designs from this set are printed also simonwillems was correct my mechanic is missing his hat which should be a black kepi theyre extremely expensive on bl though proving once again that this set has some awesome parts so i ordered a replacement from lego its in the mail and should come soon	positive
the printed pieces are the real gems of this set beyond them there isnt much to this set though the boat hull is nice the model itself isnt all that great the new akator temple is definately a superior model at least in piece count but those printed pieces are hard to resist steve	negative
i got this as a birthday gift when i turned 7 years old or so i can still remember the big box with the brown bridge in its display so many hours of fun one of the most amazing sets i own a lot of play value a true classic	positive

great review this does look like an excellent set great chopper	positive
great review 5150 although you might want to resize your pictures before posting them so they dont take forever to load quote wow i was skeptical of this coast guard line i was actually the complete opposite ever since i saw the first pictures i fell in love with the whole line the helicopter looks to be one of the two best in the line right up with the 4wd and jetski great job tlc and i do hope you have something equally as great planned for next year	neutral

great looking set loved the review pictures were good sometimes blury but i think i will pick this up after i get the rest of the kotcs sets riddler a tip i learned in photoclass is to take a breath in and hold it while pushing the shutter so you dont accidentally move while breathing i thought it was silly but it does work again great review looking forward to more	positive
oke thanks for the tips but you see that not blurry pics ive taken them later so now it will be totaly great pics who wants the second riddle	neutral
the stickers ruin the tumbler but the truck is very good if it was cheaper id get it	negative
i am gonna have to pick this up what a grand representation of the tumbler and it would be my first joker minifigure my lego batlife is looking up tnr	neutral
orion123 on aug 29 2009 1217 am said please dont reply to year old topics it will get the admins annoyed and thats not good i see that your new though so welcome to eurobricks but i recommend not doing it again reviving old topic is fine if the member has something valid or constructive to add into the discussion that has not expired in any forms in this case he is commenting on the review and adding his views into it such actions doesnt really get the staff annoyed on the other hand please take a look at this topic for better explaination thanks whitefang	neutral
sinner on may 28 2008 0235 pm said care to explain why the mcm has a pure weight of parts that i find hard to quantify but love it is just so dense when you build it full of nice surprises no technique required and a wonderful stearing mechanism that i rank as more important than the suspension of the mars version this thing was meant to crush anyway who needs suspension i also like the way you never felt that the mtrons deserved a base after building this it was that good the colour scheme was perfect its space and i like it enough said great review btw god bless nathan naturally youre entitled to your inferior opinion	positive
norro on may 29 2008 0130 am said its space and i like it enough said indeed norro standing up for a space set	neutral
i love the design of the front canopy of this set but i always felt that they could have done more with the rest of the model this set is good candidate for customization though there is quite a bit on unused space inside especially in the middle section i want to try putting a technicstyle engine into mine at some point along with the necessary gearing i got my mcm brand new off ebay some years ago for a pretty good price but the box was very worn out and the big transneon panel which floats freely inside the box was a bit damaged as for the hosejetpack things i always assumed that they were either welding torches or flamethrowers take your pick quote kinda sad to think that with tlcs recent ban on magnets in their products first time ive heard of that what are they going to do for the train couplings	neutral
cp5670 on may 28 2008 0852 pm said first time ive heard of that what are they going to do for the train couplings new couplings are going to be available soon there is a thread with pictures of the new couplings here	neutral

it looks like youre right about the old magnets i got a few off pab two months ago but they no longer have them i guess i should grab some while theyre still widely available on bricklink as they can be useful in a number of situations on a side note one interesting thing about this set is that it seemingly had two uscanada names mega core magnetizer and multi core magnetizer brickset lugnet and all the other sites ive seen call it mega but i have some north american catalogs from that time period that call it multi and the box also says multi on it i actually didnt know the mega name at all until many years after the mtron line	neutral
inertia on may 29 2008 0844 am said i just thought that the mt101 was very skeletal and couldnt really steer that well although i do like it also the mcm has a better design in my view as the wheels are closer together making it look a lot more tankish than the mt101 also space in the rear isnt wasted on having a shuttle thanks for an answer ill shut up now so we can focus on your review	neutral

thanks for that fine review of a really classic and impressive mtron set inertia tohst on may 28 2008 0455 pm said the mm armored drilling unit has a more technic base giving it a less solid appearance  yeah it´s pretty sad some of these new sets just look very cool at the outside but appear to be hollow and blank at the inside especially with the annoying use of studless technic beams to mod these sets often means to change the whole inner frame leaving us with a bunch of imho not really very useful parts it´s not a very honorable marketing strategy to produce set designs that´re aimed to look impressive and cool on the box art but´re pretty useless in their inner structures of course i don´t want to offend some technic lovers and although i always was more the system kind of guy why can´t they just use some technic beams with studs at least i grew up with just imagine with pictures of alternative models on the box and i don´t think it´s that easy especially for younger kids to mod some of these terrific blownup sets like it once was with sets like this one here implosion off	positive
sinner on may 30 2008 0138 am said thats because of cost  ive never heard an official word perhaps i should raise a topic but i think that they dont show them any more because it became a support nightmare what do i mean i bet tlg was tired of letters and calls saying timmy cant make this model shown on the box can you send instructions and the extra parts of course it´s a money issue my question was more rhetorical but i still don´t like how they sacrifice inherent set design on the altar of cost saving efforts to be even more correct i don´t understand why they try to make extraordinary cool looking sets with a pretty weak inner life yeah they want to sell sets with something that looks exciting on the box art but lego was and fortunately is with many recent sets too always more than just an impressive spaceship or sf tank vehicle it´s the sum of the set itself and its parts and what you can do with it that makes out the full fun of it the best thing you can do with a new set beside some ucs sets perhaps is to mod the set according to your own likings this is where just imagine begins and how kids start to learn how to moc at least it was like that to me individualizing official sets and looking on some cool alternative models gave me my first ideas and helped my imagination and skills to grow back in these days when i was a wee child books movies and tv series as a source of inspiration just came a little later i can see many people complaining about how to make the alternative models yes but just stop using them on the box art´s a very poor solution and a dangerous one too at least in long terms of course i know that you know all these things too sinner i just think it´s a shame and a risk too because tlc´s perhaps sacrificing more than they might know by yet building with bricks is the main attraction of lego not just some cool crafts to play around with others can do this too and maybe better than tlc if the kids of today ever forget about the fascination of being imaginative tlc´ll only lose in the end	neutral

this super set contains many of the city sets you can get for your mini city hospital the smallest set is the 7902 car with a doctor i thought it looked a bit too slow here is a car you can build with the same bricks the instruction manual for the ambulance does contain a picture of an alternate model but it is actually quite hard to build something significantly different this sets lacks some snotbricks so i had to be a little more creative and came up with this ambulance it is more a hearse than an ambulance the helicopter has a lot of slopes so i built a speed boat for those special emergencies unlike the first two sets i used far from all the bricks in this this set does really have some great parts the brickshelf gallery with some more pictures is anyone up to the challenge and build some alternate models of the last set in the super pack  the hospital	positive

grevious on may 30 2008 0503 am said gasp are you kidding me honestly i hate this set the batbike looks far too blocky and that hammer truck looks super shoddy and thrown together the only real reason id get it at all would be for the harely quinn figure  but id probably just get her separately on bricklink besides the tumbler and robins jetski sets look far better to me they actually seem to have great vehicle designs no new villian figures i know but still some great old ones er wait a minute oh yeah hope your review gives the real scoop on this kit deino the batbike may look blocky but the hammer truck is by no means thrown together read the instructions it actually has a great assembly add into the fact it has harley great wheels a modable batbike awesome stickers and awesome pieces and id say this was a win the penguin is a bit of a repeat and the tumbler is too big for me either way its a great set batman 08 wasnt nearly as bad as i thought it would be which is great batbrick away	positive

hi all so i was at the walmart yesterday and had the munchies and was looking for something to eat somewhere along the line i stopped caring about food and decided to browse the toy department to see what they had legowise usually they have jack squat but on this particular day they had a lot of new sets i impulsively picked this set up along with harley quinns hammer truck and the new little campsite from the indy 4 line i must say when i first saw images of this set i wasnt exactly thrilled or anything i mean i didnt really see anything particularly special about it but after purchasing it i must admit that i would consider it a must buy for any lego fan but enough babbling about myself onward with the review my first of an official set in this picture you can see everything you get with the set i thought the boxart was pretty nice looking the manual on the other hand took somewhat of a beating within the box a common problem with most more recent sets i do have to say that i wish they would at least make some effort in fixing this they could just make a little thin cardboard folder to minimize bending and tears for batman minifig collectors the highlight of this set are the robin and penguin figs previously you could only get them in the pricey batcave set but this set provides a much cheaper alternative one thing you will notice however is that robins hairpiece is a new mold as it is actually a black version of mutts hair from the indy 4 line personally i think it actually looks better than the hairpiece used on the older version of robin as the batcave had before it this set comes with some bricks to make two cute but deadly penguins they help add more charm to an already charming set when youre finished building youll end up with a nice little assortment of extra parts 1 black cheese slope 3 1x1 tile black yellow and white a revolver a technic pin and a 1x1 red round plate heres robins scuba jet its nice and sleek looking notable parts of interest would probably be the green turbine engines my only complaint on this one would have to be the use of decals on the 2x2 round yellow tiles for that type of a part printing seems as though it would have been the best way to go now for in my opinion the best part of the setthe penguins sub this set has more decals than robins scuba jet but they seem more necessary in this case i actually wanted to put the decals on the sub as i think the it looks great with them obviously it looks like a penguin but wow does it ever do it with style it has a lot of interactive features the first of which i will mention being the periscope which raises up and down and for the collectors of parts in new colors it has a few parts in medium orange such as 2x2 tile heres a shot of the bottom of the sub another nifty little feature is how you can lift the top off and fit the penguin inside and there is enough room inside so that you can firmly place top on again and without interference to the movement of the periscope another little feature is the rear springloaded missile you just tilt the small lever toward the front of the sub and it fires and the last small feature are the flickmissiles on each side overall this is a great set with a lot to offer for a decent price a lot of fans might view the only drawback to it as being the use of decals but if you plan on keeping the kit together they make it look really fantastic buy it if you can matt edited by imperialshadows 01 june 2008  1142 am	positive
awesome i am totally getting this set good review	positive
great review though you really seem to like this set and it probably is a great one im not a fan of the penguin sub or at least im not from what i see	negative
thanks for the review i love this set i didnt think it was much at first either but i really love it another cheaper robin and penguin is great and those nifty mini penguins are awesome the spare pieces are even nice i love robins little scuba jet those green engines are very nice and i love it compactness penguins sub is even better at first i was annoyed at getting two subs but now i realise it means i can have a fleet of them ill be sure to mod over those cannons though but the details are very slick thanks again batbrick away	positive
thanks  why isnt this set on sh who wants the second riddle	neutral
thanks for the great review brickadier general the sub looks very nice and i like the idea of a raising periscope did the batcave sub have that feature and the details on the sub look very nice the inclusion of the penguin robin and two of those great brickbuilt penguins really confirms that ill be getting this considering that i didnt purchase the batcave however i am rather dissapointed that this set is so similar to the vehicles of penguin and robinin repectively in the batcave set i feel that it only really caters to those who havnt bought the set and i wouldve much appreciated different vehicles overall a very nice set perhaps the best of the 2008 wave despite its lack of originality thank you very much for the review bg	positive
i was never considering getting this set as i dont really like batman but if i found this set and had some money with me i would buy it ii would use it for indiana jones or something and the revolevers and top hats the only problem i see with the boxart is that the penguin is drowning	positive
man i was hoping to be the first to review ordered from tru 2 days ago oh well this set looks sweet cant wait for your review	positive
man tohse mini vehicles and minifigs are sexy as all heck i love drinferno and the female pattern for agent trace is it just me or she almost busting out  i love the dr inferno hair and the reappearance of spyclops and gold tooth is simply gold yes yes pun intended i have to say this is shaping up to be one of my favourite sets well ever batbrick away	positive

wow like others have said i was unsure about these when i first heard about them but then looked at the first leaked pics and thought they actually look pretty neat now i have seen all the reviews i have to have all these sets at first i was thinking they would be great as parts packs but the more reviews i see the less i want to use them as part packs and just keep them as built or buy 2 so i can do both  cant wait till they hit the shelves in the uk thanks for the review	positive
sveltecorps a fanastic review of this biggest agents set at first i was not very keen to have this set however after reading your review you have make me swing up and down its simply fabulous thanks for your hard work i am sure its not easy to do this review i love that female minifig she looks awfully sweet especially with her new hair great job	positive
great review thanks thats one hell of a set i think lego has reached a certain kind of peak with the design cleverness and fun of this one im so relieved that agents seems to be shaping up to be even better then i thought it was going to beand i thought it was going to be cool to begin with agent charge not only does he look like dash justice but he has the name of one of dashs alpha team squadmates i call shenanigans	positive

i first i thought the whole agents line would not be very good but boy have i changed my mind this set looks amazing as do all of the other sets in the line i really like how the small vehicles all fit into the truck i dont like it when sets come with smaller vehicles and dont have anywhere to store them so they just float on the side that light projector is fantastic i cant believe they are actually printed this is definitly on my tobuy list thanks for the amazing review	positive
great review i just got 7644 mx81 hypersonic operations aircraft its a great ship i started to review it but then it started to rain i was outside so the review is coming tommorow technicolor stickers very pretty	positive
another great review im looking forward to getting this set sometime soon i wasnt aware of the power function aspect similar i suppose to the old technic sets which had an additional instructions for those with the relevant motors i knew those dinos i got at clearance would come in useful nice to see the recent bulldozer treads appearing in black grey seemed a slightly unusual colour choice	positive
isnt it a lovely set i too have one modded of course 	positive

i appreciate your review mr mandalorian but why the negativity id try to find more positives about the set instead of kinda criticizing it after each picture i personally think it looks freakin awesome the size is very impresive and i nearly fell of my chair when i saw the first pics earlier this year its quite unlike anything ive ever seen from lego edited by radiant7 04 june 2008  0827 am	positive
thanks for the review i really like all the mars mission sets this year the usage of the big wing is a bit annoying but you cant blame lego for reusing the mold ive been considering doing the same with mine mr mandalorian on jun 4 2008 0219 pm said so thats all folks shall i include one last bar joke i wouldnt have a bar of it	neutral
thanks for the review mr mandalorian this is an er interesting set lots of frontal firepower very big too and i like the idea of those two little craft that attach on the sides sort of like little escape pod things anywho not one of the things on my to buy list but i do like that radioactive sticker that could come in use looking forward to seeing your modifications too peace	positive
thanks for the great and very detailed review i love the new holostickers im still not sold on this set though im not sure why i think its the big wing piece and the tootechnicy build from looking at the instructions the platform seems kind of out of place and for the size of the set the functionality doesnt seem as good as it could be it reminds me of 7699 armored drilling unit  looks impressive but doesnt seem to do that much i do think mars mission has improved this year though bar none this is the weakest of the new mm sets i think	negative
thanks for the review mr mandalorian the alien craft is a bit small in my opinion could have done with being just a little bit larger the main craft however despite its few minor flaws looks very good while space isn’t my normal theme i’m certainly being tempted this year	positive
two more questions 1  how stable is the entire craft when balanced on the platform is there a chance that it will just collapse 2  what are the total wingspan height and depth measurements of the model	neutral
hm needs more firepower	negative
iron moose on jun 4 2008 0215 pm said do tell im being curious not confrontational  well first and foremost like many other people im no fan of those dreaded unprinted minifig torsos and stickers but also the cost to piece ratio of the set it just seems too expensive for everything that you get such as too many small parts and a lighter than usual piece count for the price though if it had included printed minifigs and other elements i maybe would of been able to swallow its 100 usd cost a little easier but star justice is still lego space in the most classic sense thats available today and i will probably pony it up just because anyway i hope were not breaking forum protocol by not discussing the 7644 review of the original poster or that particular set in general	neutral
hey thanks guys so you tolerated the bar jokes and faded lighting radiant7 on jun 3 2008 0901 pm said i appreciate your review mr mandalorian but why the negativity id try to find more positives about the set instead of kinda criticizing it after each picture i personally think it looks freakin awesome the size is very impresive and i nearly fell of my chair when i saw the first pics earlier this year its quite unlike anything ive ever seen from lego algernon on jun 4 2008 0634 am said i dont understand why theres so much negativity this is actually my favorite of the new mm sets the finished look is very sleek and not very gappy at all the deployable landing pad is great and itll make it easy to put on a shelf without taking too much room lots of greebles although i will concede that its just begging to be modded still though im definitely buying this one  it has a really great look to it spacefan on jun 4 2008 1038 am said i dont understand the negativity either one mans treasure is another mans trash i suppose that said having grown up with lego during the 80s this set has a certain nostalgia factor in its overall look and feel that harkens back to that earlier period in my life which i fondly remember aside from the factory star justice set elements of which i loathe i expect the 7644 to be the closest thing to a classic space revival that well ever see again from the lego group but i hope to be pleasantly suprised someday though im not living in the past and do appreciate everything lego is doing now and will do and has done since and like you im one whos definitely buying this set no matter how few of us there may be im sorry you guys thought i was being negative i actually love the set it brings a real feel of classic space to mm no im not talking in the third person  however it does have its own small issues which are nothing really i said that theres not much of a lab but thats the beauty of lego theres a lot of room in the ship so it should be a piece of cake to mod to a bigger lab too many bars ill take them off i really like the set i just want to change it to suit my tastes it looks beautiful it will find a home among my other mm sets as a favorite iron moose good question its about 17 inches wide 11 inches tall with ramp down and 16 inches wide as for the platform its pretty stable it tilts back a small degree so it doesnt collapse when tapped on the nose but i wouldnt leave it on the edge of a table while in that position	neutral

a very nice little review of a pretty nice little set that i wish id bought between 1 and 10 of just for the griffin oh well your review has shown me that its useful for more than just that so maybe ill try to pick one up someday cant have too many black capes books or printed things speaking of which whitefang on jun 9 2008 0941 am said interesting parts it comes with a wizard book owl 2 printed tiles with a spider and stone prints on it the far right seriously i dont find any good use for it can any eb members enlighten me on that gray thing on the right the gray thing is technically a plume like any castle plume except in this case its a feather presumably from the griffin and made from the mold to the old indian feathers in the wild west sets its a case of an old part coming back for a slightly new use in a new colour beyond that the stone print tile is a bundle or rolled up blanket or package depending on where its used i dont think its ever meant to be a stone it was used as a rolled up pack on the back of the star wars speederbikes for example nice pics plenty of useful information id give this review an a thanks for doing it	neutral

hello eb yes im cranking out the reviews the other day i picked up this gem for an okay sales price at devonport tas while searching for the new batsets i informed iamded of this as he is a spideysuckup   and he informed me this was the only set he didnt have of the wave 2 of this theme so i ask you great eb members to please remind him of this when commenting here we go with the review of doctopus lair anyway unlike other reviews this stars more people the batbrickiamdeddragonatordaisy review daisy is the mouse that came in the set first up re the figs and i must say they are great i love fleshies and these are excellent to expand my batman world plus having a spiderman to beat up is good too doctopus is great though his tentacles are annoying to keep in order peter parker is a nice addition i love that torso eve though harry osborn was totally absent from this scene i welcome him as he is a good fig also best of all is mary jane fleshie females are hard to come by and i love that hair my very first one oh and even better is bley daisy on the far right another fantastic thing is that by mixing mj with doctopus you get a far more deadly and real villain than anyone couldve forseen  the hippy oh cmon tell me that aint cool anyhoo here is a pic of doctopus showing his might random fact did you know i influence both dragonator and iamded in their sigfigs dragonator adapts his from my ia series while iamded added mutt hair when i had him like that in a pic i posted now onto the box sorry about the lighting the art is good and the cartoon spidey in the corner may have beenthe inspiration for a similar style in the new batsets back of the box again sorry about the lighting and blur it was gtting late and these were the last pics finally we get to the first part of the set the catapult is that movie accurate or what i love the part in sm2 when he uses his homemade genetic spider powered catapult to launch himself to the scene oh well it does comes with a cool spider web an trans blue spider so it gets some points and it is really fun i launched spidey several metres once i dont think he ever recovered infact he almost certainly webbed himself slightly cooler extras are these two this awesome little boat is great for city as is the simple but nice bouy daisy approves naturally dragonator ruins everything when he found out the dragon that would be riding with him was our nickname for daisy now finally the main attraction  coctopus dock iamded and i threw dragonator in the water to see if he could swim he er couldnt one sweeney todd later we continue the overall construction of the building is very good i know a lot of people hated stickers and i hated applying these but they do look spectacular and perfect for any city setting like a bank a gotham bank as iamded has already noted below me the black lifesavers a very cool as are the web piece and log pieces the inside contains the neutron copperplate triple bypass humdrum holy hum 5000 which does does see movie anyhoo it is very cool and includes a little control thingy on the yellow brick next to it unfortunately the inside is plain but for that the other side has no wall too which is a bit of a letdown really but atleast it allows daisy easy access one gripe is those yellow 1x1 bricks they serve no purpose and break up the colour scheme better shot of the thingy thing i quite like it the use of technic parts actually works and the whole set is worth it for those purple flames and dishes alone it closes up pretty well too unable to hit the dish which is a nice feature me and iamded liked it so much we threw a revived dragonator into it unfortunately it disagreed with him but it was fun another shot of the dock i like how they have gaps in the jetty i know the movie version was pretty wack and although the set isnt very faithful to it looks more like a seaside library to be frank it still is very nice this is my first large blue baseplate too which is wonderful though funny how the set only uses about half of it the roof is a well designed and fun feature it uses some technic connections to render it flexible of any degree as you can see here by my opening of it better shot of the roof design it can lie flat or at any angle i might use the design myself in the future as much as i love the building this feature bugs me for in order for it to work this wall has to stick out which not only looks ugly but makes you be able to see through the corners still easily modded and log pieces are fantastic for mocing it also means that there are 7 windows all up for a good sizeable building by pulling out the piece in the center the walls both collapss sideways outwards which is actually pretty fun and works everytime overall view of the set including characters now for the story that makes no senseat all spiderman is dead after falling down the wall mechanism see above only daisy can save the day for dragonator is being held by the evil doctopus and iamded and dragonator are too busy not caring and brainbox is too busy complaining that this goes against all marvel continuity unfortunately daisy is on a lunchbreak so tough luck dragonator and daisy goes on a search for fortune and glory okay this is what i think of the set build 35  fun but those stickers ruin the experience somewhat and if you dont apply them the instructions are a bit hard to follow playability 45  great little gizmos and bits not the kind that keep you going like with the 2007 aquabase but good fun still design 45  not very movie faithful no but still a great little building and a smart design for certain aspects minifigs 55  great figs with all different faces and very useful bits price 25 far far overpriced even on sale sadly total 1825  a good set that couldve been better with a few minor changes nothing wrong with it but it doesnt really cross the line to greatness that said it has a lot going for it and definitely worth buying or atleast a look

thanks for the review even if it is a number of years late i picked this up whn it came out and thought it was a rather cool set besides the catapult plenty of cool pieces and the baseplate has found a use in the batcave although i think my dad managed to spill some beer on it at one point that was awful to clean off batbrick on jun 13 2008 1044 am said and brainbox is too busy complaining that this goes against all marvel continuity i wasnt expecting that there i was casually scrolling down when i stumbled onto a picture of me	positive

great set but i scrapped it since im not big on space nice set though and a good review jifel	positive
i picked up this set mainly because of the many 5spare glow in the dark parts and the promise of 2 racers and one helicopter for the price of a little more than two racers 90kr vs 2x40kr the box the back of the box shows the two alternate models you can build if the polybags rip there are 3 cheese slopes and two 1x2 tiles that glow in the dark where the tiles are exclusive for this set the total parts count is high at 142 but there are no really big pieces among them inside the box you will find the building instructions a sheet with some odd sticky labels thrown away and 3 polybags marked by the bag building difficulty the models the lime colored car doesnt bring out anything new we have seen racers built like that before but it does contain some nice bricks for the collection the police cruiser surprises with an interesting design along the sides as seen here it is harder to build because of the greater level of details the helicopter is without doubt the hardest vehicle to build in a bag i cant finish it because its larger than the bag you cant put on the top blades nor the tail of the thing so it beats the forklift from 7733 where the top bar is the new kind that doesnt completely fit there is also instructions for the alternate models but it requires the bags to be opened the vehicles are pretty standard for the racers theme with the police car being the highlight of the set conclusion i like the difficulty curve between bag 1 and 2 but the last bag should be labeled 1000000 instead of 3 it requires some inhuman skills to build that helicopter in the bag  lime colored car 3  we have seen it before but it has some nice pieces and lime police cruiser 9  it has a massive diffusers rare parts and a high level of details it is a shame lego relies so much on stickers helicopter 6  if you see it as a set for one fourth of the price of the cars it is quite amazing but you cant bag build it and i would personally prefer some more detail instead of the big size overall it is a nice little set but the police car is the main attraction i wouldnt get the other vehicles if they were sold separately brickshelf gallery edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0703 pm indexed	negative
yknow you can open the bag	neutral
why didnt you open the bags	neutral
now now dont judge people who do this there have been bigger sets that were done in the bag to each his own 	neutral
adiksalego on jun 17 2008 1002 am said now now dont judge people who do this there have been bigger sets that were done in the bag to each his own  you make it sound like i did something deeply socially deviating like being an adult playing with lego but back on topic open the bags if they were meant to be opened why did lego close them in the first place bag building is not for everybody some might become very frustrated with it and let their anger out on the set by lining it up on a mini golf course	neutral
great review indexing it as i write this how come you think the ctt is the atats predecessor do you mean the motorized atat or atats in general i think this is a great set and i am very fond of mine its one of the few sw sets of mine that is on parade at all times most are packed away in the attic kimt btw its not alone the older version of the atat is keeping it company	positive
nice review i echo the sentiment that more snowies would have been better	negative
vadersson on jun 19 2008 0157 pm said as far as i know the atat was a invention by general veers himself benny i doubt that the atat was used in the clone wars	neutral
even though i never liked ucs i absolutley hate this one sure its great on display but the build looks extremley boring to me just stacking plate after plate and as you said its going to break a little if you touch it the only intersting part for me is the firing laser although i do have to say the proce isnt too bad i still wouldt buy it and no minifigs so thanks for the review but ill pass on this one the new minifig scale ds looks awesome though and this might have hyped some up who are buying the new ds	negative
great review kimt  i like this set even if i don´t own it because it looks simple fantastic to display i just have one question the mini executor can be moved around the death star ii or its attached to that place thanks for the review 	positive
good job kimt it´s a really nice set it will be interesting to see the size of ds2 ucs compared with the new death star playset keep up the great regulator job you are doing morten	positive
i think its a very weird and boring ucs set but what a lot of grey plates you could build something much better out of them but it would be fairly flat it looks very fragile though  my ucs atst is edited by shoc 25 june 2008  1028 am	negative
wow what a letdown i recently picked up this set and i looked up this review to see what i was getting into not good news the silver lining is that it was a damaged box deal at brickworld so it only cost me 100 half off the already lowered price so it was definatley worth it as a parts pack if nothing else its the last unopenedunbuilt large kit in my collection so even if it is repetetive i am going to build it anyway it is likely however that i may substitute pieces to do away with the colored interior ive already determined that after it sits on display for a while i want to do a zepplin as an alternate build looking at the parts list it looks like its the perfect set for such an undertaking	negative
kimt on jun 24 2008 0322 pm said 4 zero swooshability i think its very swooshable assuming you swoosh it at the same speed it moves in the movie d while i would never do something like this i bet if you packed this sucker with a bunch of m80 firecrackers it would make for a fantastic end to a stop motion movie with it being as delicate as you say it is i bet you wouldnt destroy any parts edited by gotoandlego 03 april 2010  0257 pm	positive
7656 general greivouss starfighter release 2007 number of pieces 232 minifigs 1 brickset welcome this is my first review so contstructive critisism is very much appreciated on to the review first we start out with the box the box art is the same as always since 2006 nothing special then we start the build the build is fairly easy and will take the seasoned builder about 1520 min to complete here is the finished model and birds eye view as you can see this ship is very sleek the fins or wings each have an outer slope and an inner one with the guns in between there are also cones on the front of the fins which give the ship an even more sleek look in the middle of the wings there is the main body with a big slope and stripes decorating it this set has a very good playability factor as im about to show you now the guns on the ship are pretty cool looking to begin with a bley slope attaching a lightsaber hilt and a transneon green stud to the fin on each side but theres more than what meets the eye yes the guns flip up and they can flip all the way back to hide them for whatever case they need hiding lets have a look at the back there is a tail fin used as landing gear and some lightspeed boosters but wait the tail fin can flip up for flight thanks to a hinge attached to the back of the cockpit heres another playability factor the cockpit can slide open very smoothly and easily heres how this is possible a clever system under the hood allows the cockpit to open see those two bley pieces on the black ones those bley ones attach to the tan plates under the hood and the hood and windsheild attach to the black peices the black and bley pieces work together as a sliding system so the cockpit opens viola and then the cockpit snaps in place thanks to the red hook and clip its a very accurate system and works very well youll want to open and close it over and over again now finnaly to the fig the general himself a very impressive fig with a new head and torso mold in this set which is one of only two with greivous in it he comes with 2 green and two blue lightsabers all with bley hilts   i was hoping for chrome hilts but its a minor fault grievous also comes with a new mold pistol blaster not pictured heres the general in the cockpit sadly a weak cockpit no details he just half lays down on a small slope in this set he doesnt come with a cape beacuse with it on the cockpit doesnt close thats about it heres the final verdict build 710 fairly easy but fun a little bit weak playability 810 many playability factors but some are boring or pointless swooshability 810 very fun to fly around sometimes pieces break off minifigs 1010 one amazing fig with 4 lightsabers and a new blaster what more could you ask for design 910 very sleek but hardly any real texture i like it but others might want greebling price 1010 overall score 910 a very cool ship with a very cool minifig and accessories one of the best sw sets i have ever seen for its small price i highly recommend it to any kind of sw lego or sw lego fan hope you enjoyed my review please leave feedback edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0301 am	positive

very nice review jim i havent bought this set yet but am planning to just to get a gg fig as i dont have one already bought an imperial landing craft instead this week as it was on sale but after this review ggs fighter is sure to follow soon benny	neutral
jameseh on jun 28 2008 0824 pm said does the sliding cockpit come off easily my friends brothers breaks everytime you touch it but he may have built it wrong it put me off the set im very sad to say that sometimes it does but thats only if you hold it from the top and bottom with your fingers and thumb respectivly but if you hold it in your palm or from the sides it wont break emphasis on sometimes but dont try to mess around with it by removing its pieces or adding new one or modding it in any way because the sliding mechanism wont agree with the mods and break but this hardly takes away from anyone liking this set because imo its perfect just how it is	negative
yeah general grievous starfighter will land in my house greate set i love decals  brown and sandy pattern ingenious btw when you show sith infiltrator review i wait 	positive
hello all eurobricks members i will be doing the second wave of the 2008 impulse set series which had released recently i bought this set earlier ago and will like to share this comprehensive review with everyone of you name troll warrior theme lego system  castle year 2008 pieces 19 minifigs 1 an image of a 5618 troll warrior let the march begin the mighty brave troll warrior carrying a dangerous cart equipped with a flick fire missile marching into the lands of the crown kingdom crown knights must be ready for this new troll addition from what i see this set has a very minimum piece count since its an impulse set there is no unique parts found in this set however this set has a couple of useful accessories such as 2 spears and 2 wooden wheels and a grey mouse running around this set is another alternative for castle army builders to buy multiple sets to build a massive troll armies in addition the flick missile really works use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it the missile will fly well it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature base of the cart different angles there is one thing i dislike about this set the wooden wheels are too big and it is the same as the ones in the crossbow attack i prefer the smaller wheels that exist in old castle sets that produced smaller cart since this cart size is similar to the old cart size the old wizards cart is a very good example of the proposed wheel bits and pieces closeup on the warrior and the mouse summary review playability 5510 the playability feature is not fanastic design 6510 design is adequate if the wheels is much smaller and the flicking thing disappear the score will be much higher price 810 an inexpensive set to get a troll warrior and a mouse overall 610 to conclude this set is good only for army builders a new range of millitary vehicle to be added thats all hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0129 pm	positive
its all good buti know you expected a but  its a rat	positive
guys thanks for your kind comments i am glad to know that you have enjoyed viewing this review trooperdavinfelth on jul 2 2008 1115 pm said its a rat i thought by calling it as a mouse it will be a little much friendly unlike calling it a rat brainbox on jul 2 2008 1120 pm said thanks for the review bearing in mind that the whole point of this set is to get a cheap troll warrior i actually quite like it the cart isnt brilliant but for 13 pieces its not that bad the troll fig is great as always and i guess the rats are always nice to get not so much in real life though the sets that contain the trolls have a fairly solid number each i mean tower raid has three but nevertheless i think i may have to pick up a few of these norro on jul 3 2008 0610 am said a more affordable troll warrior for those of us avoiding the large sets me is always nice thanks for the review i must agreed with the both of you that this is a much easier way to acquire these troll warriors at a much affordable price i am glad these trolls are available in impulse sets now will there will be a dwarf impulse set in the future i supposed that will be much interesting glman on jul 3 2008 1215 am said its a good review but you forgot another thing the troll needs a shiled like they used to in the 2007 castle line the sets always had shields for the minifigs and it could be better if it was 300 instead of 350 but yes it is a good impulse great army builder if this impulse set includes a troll shield my rating will defintely go higher this is a troll army builder set with minimum feature and limited weapons range if the troll comes with an armor or a shield i will think this set is worth it troll armor is hard to get by as it appeared only in troll warship and tower raid edited by whitefang 03 july 2008  0306 am	positive

whitefang on jul 4 2008 0543 pm said well mouse sounded more friendly because it can associate with tom and jerry but calling it a rat equal calling it a pest its just a matter of putting it in different terms thats all the thing i dont get is how jerry is friendly	neutral

hello all eurobricks members i will be doing a continuation of my impulse set reviews i was pretty excited when i laid my hands on these new impulse sets yesterday hope to give most of you a good insight for this set name street cleaner theme lego system  town  city year 2008 pieces 22 minifigs 1 an image of a 5620 street cleaner let the cleaning begin the street cleaner has a job to do it is to clean the rubbish on the streets after a new year countdown it seemed the cleaning agency have a new equipment to use its not as big as the previous street sweeper machine the cleaner will need to operate the equipment manually by pushing it look at the mess after sorting out look at the pieces offered its not a very complicated set since its an impulse set there are some pretty useful parts lying around such as the broom spade however i was quite surprised when i could not find the lid of the rubbish bin i cant used this rubbish bin to place it around my town without a lid on top of it i believed it is not a norm by not including the lid look at that bin well that rubbish bin seem to be containing his equipment in it instead of the rubbish the cleaners face looks pretty sad i think he wants to have a change of job front view i love that blue brush very much quite fun to play with especially pushing the rubbish aside thats why a spade is there to help him to dig out the litter and the broom to brush it away ok now i know why his face looks so sad where is that street sweeper machine summary review playability 6510 not bad to play with design 7510 the design is relatively interesting with the use of the technic part to be its foundation price 810 an inexpensive set to get another cleaner and some neat accessories overall 710 not a bad set after all pretty average but still quite good to buy if your towns required more cleaners hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelfwhen moderated edited by whitefang 04 july 2008  0344 pm	positive

hello all eurobricks members this will be my last impulse set review for the second wave hope everyone of you will find my reviews useful and helpful in your purchase name crystal hawk theme lego system  mars mission year 2008 pieces 26 minifigs 1 an image of a 5619 crystal hawk alpha 3 in sector 5 reporting to base alpha 3 crystal hawk reporting for duty sir may i present mars mission latest scout craft code named crystal hawk this spacecraft looks very sleek and cool with its usual white and orange color combination i am not a fan of mars mission but these white minifigs simply attracted me for it in fact i only owned its impulse sets and none of its main sets nevertheless this set has the swoosh factor i was swooshing around in my home last night well i am not swooshing it like kimt though am i seeing double haha the answer is no it has double sided face i combined the pictures to illustrate the two facial expressions bits and pieces different angles love the way how the wings bend upwards and downwards the only thing i find it a little bit wierd for spacecraft normally i thought joystick is the typical navigation controls for a spacecraft instead of a steering wheel i am not complaining about a steering wheel in a spacecraft to me its quite an uncommon sight anyway the white steering wheel is an useful part for making vehicles mocs summary review playability 810 fun to play with when you bend the wings up and down design 8510 design is simple but creates a sleek and cool look price 810 an inexpensive set to get more scout craft and mars mission minifigs overall 8510 a very good set to have for any mars mission fans and for collectors like me whom cant afford all mars mission sets this set is a very great alternative hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated	positive
one of the better impulse sets imo	positive
thanks for pics the hawk it seems to me lacks a cockpit theres not even a seat to keep the pilot from falling off perhaps it theyd redesigned it to be a backpack jetpack sort of unit using similar pieces itd at least make some sense based on the other mm impluses can we assume this goes for 35usd at that price it seems to me that the astro fighter at 5usd was already a superior impluse set guess id buy one on clearance for the minifig	neutral
thanks for the great review now i just have to have that set	positive
thanks for another great review i definitely like this set sure the interior might be a bit bare but i think that the outside of the base with all of the great lava and rocks more than makes up for it it is a bit weird that on the one side there is nothing on the inside but thats easy to fix anyone know when this will be out in the us thanks again for the fantastic review	positive
droool must buy to sveltecorps how on this wonderful planet did you get that i thought it was coming in september	positive

trudop561 on jul 11 2008 0630 am said i got this set last year and i think you made a mistake when you have remove a piece to access the probe droids and equipment you just have to slide the entire main part and i have a question is this equipped with the new flickfire missiles that dont fall off yes i realized the first part  as for the flickfire missiles the do fall off very easily	neutral
thank you for the nice review i like the design although i didnt want to buy it the new little speeder is very nice but maybe a little to small darth mauls eyes are looking a bit more dangerous now	neutral
a very neatly designed sith infiltrator though i think it lacks the size of the older version a fine ship but not what i would call a sith infiltrator it should be bigger thanks for another fine sw review kimt	negative
great review rezourceman your pics really show off the sub well and its good to see the build in progress i also have this set but i didnt apply stickers to the sub as i was planning to reuse the nice dark blue pieces however as shown in your review they do brighten it up a fair bit i cant say this is my favourite agents set the boat is a little oddly proportioned and the sub although retro looking has practically no interior and would be difficult to customise to put more in unlike say the clever job batbrick did with the penguin sub in his review the sub kind of looks like some jules verneish sea creature  i would have liked it if theyd gone all the way and made it some kind of giant robot jellyfish or squid i do agree with you about slime face  he has a fantastic torso with all the slime dripping down which is a bit obscured by the air tank its really encouraging that in the last 2 missions weve had great extra villains added in the only thing i would add about the octopus is that the glow in the dark plastic is mixed in unevenly with the aqua blue so it doesnt glow in the dark evenly  its kind of like the mars mission jellies in that respect though much cooler thanks again for the great review	negative
sveltecorps on jul 11 2008 0914 am said i would have liked it if theyd gone all the way and made it some kind of giant robot jellyfish or squid coughalphateamcough anyway i was about to reply earlier and say  great review svelte then i realised it was not you nice reveiw anyway the only reason i would get this set would be if i got all the other agents sets  all the sw cw sets  all the pieces i need on bl  all the new city ect setsthen i would think about geting it	neutral

dovchenko on jul 10 2008 0824 pm said no more of your great reviews why a good review right here got into the thick of the set without becoming boring with an absence of pictures or not having enough text ive exhausted my collection of classic space sets id love to keep them going but just one more set you can check out this index for a complete listing and links to each of the reviews thanks for the feedbback mutex on jul 10 2008 0937 pm said this is one of my favorite space sets of all time i even had 2 of them back in the days my only complain about this set was that i found that the wheels where too small  i had some trouble passing the rover over the little cratersmountains of the space plates it is a gem in the classic space collection the playability is great i agree with you as i never thought this was much of an allterrain vehicle with the wheel construction the bottom of the vehicle would always touch the bottom of nonsmooth surfaces the wheels do need to be bigger but i still like them cp5670 on jul 10 2008 1043 pm said i got this set off ebay a while ago and one of them was broken in shipping even though the set was otherwise in display model condition and the other one broke off while i was building the set i replaced them with the newer variety great buy on this one what did it cost you hewman on jul 10 2008 1111 pm said not in attempt to hijack your thread but to add to it heres a pic of my blacktron 1 version of this beautiful set thats excellent i love the alternate color scheme great job here whitefang on jul 11 2008 1211 am said however there is one thing i dont understand about this design why is the driver seat has a wide back with no cover behind and the command center has no door at the back i understand that these space guys are always carrying their helmet around for oxygen supply i wonder if there is a better answer to it yes the extra space was probably for the oxygen tanks on the figs it makes taking them off a lot easier as for the labcontrol center i never had an issue with it being open i think this was just for playability one could always pretend that some sort of invisible force ray closed the side when activated great comments i love hearing what others think of these classics	positive
awesome review brickster i didnt you are also a space fan oh how i love classic space the all time perfect lego space related theme everytime i see one i want to buy them more and more when compared to modern fang dangled sets with detailed figs and cool new accessories they have nothing on classic space simple beauty maybe its the bluegreytrans yellow color scheme classic space forever edited by piranha 30 august 2009  0751 am	positive

i ordered the set via sh and it cost 3499€ in germany 3799€ in belgium and 50 in australia it looks like it´s a exclusive set but without the 2limited edition sticker on the package in the usa it´s not aviable now i think it costs as much as the rocket ride 30  mrs pegleg he has the same short pants like in the other sets	neutral

the fish doctor is supposed to have a new torso	negative
thanks navy trooper fenson for the review  good one  i really like that sb is printed i will need to get this one when i go to the us in two weeks copmike	positive
my fish doctor has the torso from 7902 doctors car which is unfortunate because the other torso is more stylized and cartoonish i think however i did have that mad scientist lab set so a bit of digging through my old collection will hopefully yield the better torso	neutral
i was sort of hoping for a flickfire baby still this looks decent for what it is i guess obviously it really is all about the accessories and its got em but not enough to make me spend that kind of cash and i dont even mind having a pile of pink parts around if you throw in a complete turkey or some birthday cakes its a slam dunk but as it is eh thanks for the review though its very nicely presented and leaves no doubt in my mind as to just how easy this set would be to misuse for other purposes	neutral

sinner on jul 25 2008 0947 pm said im still undecided on if it was a smart buy she played with it a lot this week but last week she ignored it and i had to fix it twice my daughter is 12 and she still plays with all her belville stuff mostly the fairy princess castle sets if your daughter is anything like mine you will definitely get your moneys worth out of it however  as soon as my daughter says shes done with it i plan on raiding the sets for all those great food and accessory bits patience  great review by the way the belville sets are indeed overpriced but theyre probably legos best attempt at wooing the girl audience i still hate the fact that tlc thinks they need separate boy themes and girl themes but whatever theyre a very nice alternative to barbie  you get posable figures with realistic body proportions plus some creativity and building aspects thrown in	positive
i bought this today mainly because it was 25 off but id been eyeing it for a long time the accessories truly are brilliant theres so much here to be pillaged for other uses as people have said i picked up heaps of new parts ive never had or rare ones in even rarer colours to be honest i was surprised and impressed by the range and versatility of the regular bricks as well when you look at the box art what jumps out at you are the giant pink walls and curved pieces but theres a nice amount of white arches and lime green bricks not to mention all the windows and the trans blue 1x2x5 bricks and plants its a good thing the target audience likes stickers though theres more here than ive seen on any set except the 7709 sentai fortress i think they were aiming for one sticker per page of instructions i hope belville returns in 2010 thanks for the review sieggy did your daughter ever go back to it	positive

you just bring memorys back i never had one of the space port sets but i know that as a little boy i visited my toy store and kept on looking to the boxes on bl those sets cost too much for what ist worth today really tlc should bring this theme back space port on	positive
my sister got this from our grandparents once when she was interested with space but it fell into my hands later i had a lot of fun with that by the way the name for the test thing is called a centrifuge it tests a persons ability to withstand high gforces edited by filefolders 15 july 2008  0355 pm	positive

the copter this is one bigass copter the photos really dont do the size justice lower cockpit with cool computer too bad its a sticker although ill definitely leave this one on upper cockpit with cool computer see above awesome gatling gun yes even the technic beams have stickers im actually really fond of that little canister thing i can see using it elsewhere yes  thats a sticker the rope and hook i forgot to mention it before this set comes with two accessories besides the machine gun  binocs and one of those little things to slide down the rope also the thing that extends the rope turns the other side because theyre slightly asymmetrical one of my favorite stickers the door says survival equipment its on both sides definitely a keeper	positive
as unexpected as it was this was very helpful  three questions though 1 is the front green rubber missle a traditional launchable missle or does it have another firing mechanism 2 concerning the guns on the side are they fixed in one postition or does it have any functions 3 why did you decide to buy this set just curious	neutral

i think it looks good on the real set i thought the darker glass might be good on the ground level so the rescued guy has it nice and dark in there	positive
nice review this is just the crown jewel for the coast guard theme i love the layout of its platform it looks real neat to have it placed it in the midst of the deep blue sea awaiting of any emergency rescue sometimes i feel that this set can used it to merge with my aqua raiders sets i thought of using it as a land base for the raiders to dock in their stuff before submerge into the ocean ok its just a wierd idea of mine just feel that aqua raiders and coast guard can work hand in hand since they are naval expertise it seemed i cant view all the pictures somehow nevertheless i can still view some of it quite well i love the command center the amount of computer printed pieces simply make me smile with the monitor keyboard radar screen and etc the helicopter is cute too however i pity the victim that is loaded at the back it seemed a little bit too dangerous in addition this set seemed to have quite alot of stickers which can be quite discouraging i do hope to see this set soon so far i quite like the current coast guard sets	positive
i agree with both of you first i have to add that a few of the stickers were a bit annoying as it comes to put them on espacially the ones on the helicopter where you have to put them on round parts but i didnt really see this at a bad point i really can live with it second it was a very hard decision believe it or not on which new set to buy cause i got a huge 2008 setwantlist i guess itll take some time before i can get most of the other sets i want	neutral

thats a great review of a great city set thank you very much metalandi first of all i wanted to buy the 7999 cg petrol boat  tower but now i surely will buy this amazing platform instead of the 7999 if my local toy seller sells the 4210 reason 4210 is something very unusual set i think we wont get a set similar to that in the next 20 years and because of i dont like the petrol boat inside no backwalls  nearly no interior  klausdieter	positive
paramedic unit set  6364 year released 1980 piece count 140 minifigs 2 list price unknown well let me first say that the english name paramedic unit is not really a good name for this set the function of a paramedic is to take a patient from an emergent situation and deliver them to a hospital for treatment generally an emergency room this is a rather small clinic that i would imagine is more for family care than an emergency room in addition the car looks more like a doctornurses car rather than an ambulance or emergency response vehicle i would call this a clinic rather than a paramedic unit in any case its a great set esp for table towns that need medical services what i like is that this set is small enough to place anywhere in your lego city or town starting with the instructions like all the classic town sets alternate models are pictured although i never tried building one i like the little medical busvan the set includes two minifigs that include a female doctore or nurse and what i presume is a patient based on the torsos i really like the vehicle its a 4stud wide two seater the colors work well and i like the use of the white bar between the seats and the 1x1 blue plates for lights unfortunately the emblems are stickers heres a shot of the neat little clinic i like the use of the blinds for the exam room it shows that lego considered patient privacy when making this set the interior includes an exam room desk and two blue swivel chairs and a neat little eye chart although the letters l e g o would have made a nice touch lastly a picture of the complete set i must admit that i remember buying this set back in the 80s and i regreted it after taking it home im not sure what i didnt like about it perhaps the girl back then but now i really think its a neat set well theres a line of patients waiting to have their eyes checked comments welcome	neutral
thanks i own this set it was a good time as tlg released a lot of little buildings just look through the 63xxsetnumbers	neutral
paramedic unit does not seem to suit well for this sets name it should be named as clinic outpatient treatment family doctor and etc from what i understand parmedic unit is a standalone unit that is on standby 247 ready for any emergency rescue in lego town ambulance with a group of paramedics will be ideal for this kind of situation i love female doctors especially with that lovely hairpiece the cruiser is a neat 4studs wide design just love these small car designs back then i wonder what can be used at the back of its boot the clinic is neat maybe we can send holodoc for some medical audit to make sure that this clinic is up to standard what surprised me the most is the neat little eye chart you dont see such details in any regular lego set the red and white color combination for the building works well for me most of the hospital buildings and vehicles always revolved in red and white i gave this a 4 thanks you so much brickster	positive
gave it a 4 its not exactly town plan but its above average	positive
thank you for all these reviews thebrickster and the idea with the polls is a very nice and interesting idea it will only take a while until i will have commented on all  so please give me some time  i gave this set a four the vehicle the minfigs and the design of the house are excellent  only the interior could be a bit spiced up telephone some other equipment klausdieter	positive
i like this set like most i view it more as a clinic it sits nicely in my town plan these old sets are all very cool	positive
wow old thread just for the record so long as it is here paramedics are advanced ambulance technicians unlike standard emts they are trained for advanced cardiac life support they can push drugs defibrillate place a breathing tube etc in the 1980s when the set was made it was quite common for paramedics to respond to calls in fly cars or special response units they would join up with ambulances at the scenes that required their skills if you ever watched the old american tv show emergency johnny gage and squad 51 were one of these response units they were mostly phased out in the 90s in favor of simply putting the paramedics and als gear in the ambulances	neutral
hello all eurobricks members and town lovers today i will be doing up a review on hook  haul wrecker this name is quite wierd to me i will prefer to call it the regular tow truck this is one of the service and repair vehicle that are always ready 247 on standby for any emergency towing in our towns name hook  haul wrecker theme lego system  town year 1989 pieces 44 minifigs 1 price usd600 an image of a 6660 hook  haul wrecker let the towing begins hook  haul wrecker is the typical 4studs wide vehicle that takes care of broken vehicles that is left stranded on the roads this tow truck is pretty useful as you can see current city sets hardly have any tow trucks available to tow new cars design this tow truck is catered for 4studs vehicles for classic town can you imagine yourself this truck towing a speed racer car i think it looks really out of proportion in addition the minifig which is included in this set has the regular truck print on its torso i am very sure they must be a fan club for trucks otherwise they should really need a change of clothes nevertheless in my honest opnion i really love this torso very much somehow it makes them look tough even though their face looks very friendly side view this vehicle has a combination of two primary colors which is white and red this color combination looks very good you cannot mistook it for an ambulance since they made use of this two colors too in most emergency vehicles this is my guess i supposed the designer will have tow truck concept as a form of emergency and considered red and white as its combinations this vehicle setup has the typical sunscreen on the top of the vehicle frame however this baby has more unique features installed in it these are the source of its brutal strength allterrain vehicle this tow truck equipped with the best wheels in fact these wheels offer suspension on the roads even when its travelling uphill the truck will move accordingly with its tyres when you act pressure on the top of the vehicle it will either be shifted leftwards or rightwards closeup of these unique tyres take a careful look these wheels have springs installed in it that is the magic of these vehicle and is defintely suited to run on any rough roads with least problems if any eb members know which other vehicles has this unique features please highlight it to me because if i remembered correctly i only remember seeing this pair of tyres in this great set he is ready for some serious towing the driver had finished hook up the pizza van on its back its pretty simple you just have to lift the back of the vehicle and placed it onto the hook presto the van is ready to go this vehicle provides so much fun you can really tow any 4studs vehicle in your town and here we go to the service station poor pizza guy summary review playability 1010 superb fun you will love to use this truck and tow any vehicles design 9510 excellent design especially with the use of the suspension tyres price 910 an inexpensive set based on the 1989 pricing this set is made up of less than 100 pieces overall 9510 every town must need a tow truck if a vehicle breaks down whom will be ready to tow i gave it a 5 based on my review score card what about yours hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelfwhen moderated	neutral

skipper 24 on jul 19 2008 0820 am said nice its like an alternative to the shell petrol company sets we had over here in the uk or did you have them to we have shell as well snefroe on jul 19 2008 0823 am said once again i just dont know how you were able to keep stickers and prints in such a great condition i am sooooo jealous thanks but these stickers are in pretty bad shape esp those on the fuel pumps the tires were hard to remove in regard to the cowboy hat i think my avatar is still wearing it welcomestranger on jul 19 2008 0824 am said i much prefer the shell version of that station which had the full awning over the roadway and the special road plate with the extra lane to pull into to fill er up i have another gas station but i think its an octan	negative
i love this set its nice and simple maybe its because i build this set by myself by ordering all parts and buildinginstruction and i made one extra tanktransporter 	positive
thanks for the fantastic review of the esso petrol  station i like this set a nice contrast to the shell ones it adds a bit of variety to a lego town the cowboy hat is a nice addition too	positive
brickster once again this is another excellent gas station awaiting to be in the limelight i dont understand why i always loved these classic gas station such as shell exxon and octan they just look so lovely no city or town could ever survive without these important key installations around to pump gaspetroleum for all vehicles that depend it for fuel consumption as always all gas station will always inculde a road plate and i am glad i am still seeing roads included in such sets such as the recent 7993 service station however town plans gas station did not include a baseplate though nevertheless let me continue with this review 3 lovely minifigs included in this set its not common to see exxon torsos these days i just love that lady staff very much especially with its classic hairdo 4studs car just simply rocks with such fabulous simple design furthermore it gave you 2 cars instead of one what more can you ask you dont see tlg giving more cars in recent sets these days what surprise me about this cars is the ability of opening the front engine column i remembered vividly that only trucks or massive vehicles does have this playing feature nevertheless its an excellent addition for a 1980 gas station set this is a perfect set even when its going to fit into my current town buildings i am sure it wont have a hard time to match with the rest of the facade i can use this gas station and stationed it near the country side this set is so hard to resist with such elegant design of its fuel pump there are a total of 4 pumping stations the vehicles wont be fighting against each other for slots then the reparing area is very nice it will be even better if it include a shelter on top of it the office is simple and nice i had never expect an office to exist in gas station most of the time there are groceries stores for the consumers to get off buy off some stores and load it in the car no major complains from me i am not trying to be selection bias i had demostrated key points which is good enough to justify my score and i gave it a 5 outstanding classic gas station set	positive
okay guys i have built the set so lets review set name 7649 mt201 ultra drill walker price 6999 pieces 759 bought from tor r us in michigan us the box first we have the front it shows the set its functuns and the limited edition sign the box is huge about the size of the dino attack chopper set or the mars mission base nowadays most set that are 5000 or more have a flap displaying the sets functions opening theflap on this box reveals a gigantic picture of the set and the back the bags numbered next the manuals they have piece call outs page numbers etc there are 2 manuals with this set sticker sheets they actually arent all that bad random manual image build first we open bag 1 this will build the alien craft and the minifigures now here we have some interesting parts a green spine from exoforce and a black rim for the set container stacker next we start the build on the alien craft it is pretty sturbdy but has no cockpit for the alien the alien stickers are really cool they are rainbowish and has a silver back next come the build on the wings and the finished craft it is pretty good and has a nice sleek design however i think i will use the large ship for the commander out this year to fight the driller instead next is bag 2 which builds the rover and astro ship first is the ship it starts off with doctor infernos colors it builds up very nice and the detail is absolutley amazing next the roof is built it has some speed racer slopes the hinge piee now has a hole through it sorry for the blurry pic more is added then comes the bottom piece the detail is very nice and the hinge piece has a use later on then you build the crates each one holds two crystals added to the ship also a pic of the finished ship here we start the rover it sports anice detail the orange studs get coveded by the grill to look more like an engine the detail in this thing is pretty good it has a gun and shovel here is how it fits into the ship it slides in and is secured thanks to the hinge okay so next we open the number 3 bag which builds the body here are some interesting pieces then we start the build it begins nice and study i just love these stickers with the bulldogs on them more of the build with the stickers added next we add in the front part the detail is again outstanding with the turntable added it can move down as well the next step is to build the water tank it utilizes the bionicle boostersbig white things and added to the walker then we build that drill it uses a lot of rims and such with the gears added the front part uses a lot of those new droideka 3prong things and bionicle eyes the drill can spin thanks to the gears and added to the vehical next is the cockpit it has a nice space for the astros bckpack added the final stage is the legs thank god they arent like striking venoms they are all the same however see those two rubber parts those keep it in place when on surfaces like glass next come the large part of the legs these are similar to the assault tigers legs the final result is very sturdy thanks too notice the amazing classic space sticker so we finally come down to this the final result is amazing it is sturdy and has great detail it is very realistic and when the ship is removed the drill goes down and the turret is aimed up hope you all enjoyed the review	positive

wonderful review id die if i had to upload that many pictures man this is it the pinacle of mars missions second and final year man this baby is flawless there are so many indications that the designers took care in designing this kit  like the space for the pilots backpack the compartment for the mini flier the sturdy leg design  etc etc etc kudos to tlc for making mars mission go out with a bang i have high hopes that whereever the space theme goes next year tlc will make it worth the wait edited by grevious 20 july 2008  0543 pm	positive

looks like a great set i may consider making this the first mars mission set i buy nice review also but quote lol thanks i just wanted to claim my place for the review personally i dont think you had a place to claim somebody else could have also gotten this set and had a proper review ready before yours but felt it was wrong to post because you had posted a placeholder  clubninja in this case i think placeholders should be banned and if you are not ready to post a full review you should not post anything simple really either that or what is the policy on here regarding more than one review of a set being posted  then you could have both posted reviews and it wont really matter i guess just my 2 cents worth thanks for the review though	positive
today im gonna review the bigger of the 2 castles from the fright knigh theme i got this one last week at a pretty fair prive at ebay new and still sealed i love opening boxes that had been lying arounf for years and being the first to build an old set since i know this castle theme is not liked so much by the general public ill try here and change their minds cause i really think this is a great set this time i have to say my pictures turned out pretty amazing even if i am still using just my cellphone cam but im really pleased now with the quality here we go set nr 6097 name night lords castle number of minifigs 7 number of pieces 598 release year 1997 lets start with a few box  instructions pictures the inside od the box with a few alternate models the back with another possibility how to assemble the 3 main parts instructions next the 6 minifigs starting with the witch on her black dragon all 5 figures of the fright section and the poor royal knight we go on with the set itself first a general overview its really high on the first floor theres a trap with which you can drop stones or other things down on unliked guests the pot comes originally from fabuland i think i love this thing in the same floor there is a second trap if you pull the bar the door opens we move on to the tower itself did i mention its really high on the ground level theres the place for the witch to do her spells the wall is a secret door which reveals a skeleton when turned over on the next level there is this little thingy first it only seems like a barrel but when you pull the two 1x4 tiles on the back a skull is being revealed scary huh  i dont really understand what this is for but i assume its a telescope to watch and observate the dragons i do find that a bit senseless since there havent been telescopes in medieval times or have there been the back of the tower with the prison and the room for the treasure chest the prison opened its secured with a chain which i like very much cause you really can lock it with that treasure chest from the highest peak we now go down to the very ground level at the back of the castle there is another secret walldoor flanked by two shields at the back half of the inside there is the throne hall for the bat lord with a nice warm fireplace in the back this is where the secret door is placed the second half is pretty empty except for these two baskets i dont know exactly what they are for but i ike the idea for using them as water places for the horses one thing that might be a bit stupid is that 2 of the 4 side entrances do not have doors so they are open and a guard would have to stand there the whole day you can see it in his face he isnt very happy with that  that was my last review of the sets i got the last weeks but im looking forward to make much more in the future overall this is a pretty good set i dont know any other one with so much details and playability the minus point is as already said that it is too open on the sides but that can be solved easily with a bit of modding also i must say this set isnt that much juniorized as many might have thought though the design is a bit unconventional but exactly thats what i like most about it all in all it gets a 910 for me hope you enjoyed the reading and the pictures cant wait to see your response edit oops i forgot to put one figure of the fright knight faction on the photo but its the one in the last picture edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0128 pm	positive

my first post in this topic looks foolish now that i bought this set from ebay i just really wanted the minifigs although i already had the batlord and the black dragon and the parts they will help me greatly in building the impenetrable fortress of the dragonwarriors for my princess quest comic by the end of this week this set will be in my clutches	positive
metalandi on aug 6 2008 0140 pm said well that the bricks look new comes from that they are new i got this set new and unopened i know pretty good deal	positive
i got a couple of the small sets from this line when it came out recently i acquired several more from bricklink because i just really love the way they look this theme really had good intentions but the execution was flawed i hope one day lego returns to a darker tone but maybe next time it could be more castlevania inspired that would really turn some heads plus vampires and gothic aesthetics are really popular now it will probably have run its course by the time lego would be able to develop a theme around them though	negative
a 55 the set is beautiful both the remake and the original a classic and a beautiful thing like dos edited by maiq the liar 20 july 2008  0945 pm	positive
i am a proud owner of this set this is one of the best fire stations ever what amazes me is what the designers made with only 368 pieces you get a very nice looking building in good size a good baseplate 2 cars 4 minifigs accessories and great alternative ideas in the back of the box like the fire boat or helicopter this is a great example of lego design	positive
i must agree great fire station i love the fact that in the classic sets you were given a base plate and some other great ideas i do miss the addition of base plates and alternate building ideas the only newer set i have seen with any alternate build photos is the 7239 fire engine i miss back when	positive

what an awesome little set i really like this engine but dont remember seeing it during the late 80s it must have been out during my dark ages i love the basketsection for the firemen equally nice is the fire hose which extends a good length the color combination of red with white and the trans blue windshield looks goos as well this is a great engine and one that would look perfect in a classic tabletown  and its 4studs wide very nice review whitefang i look forward to seeing more of your classic town reviews	positive
quote i am not against with the newer sets it just that part of the reasons which reflected in the review had fufill the basic key factors of a typical fire engine in addition it was my alltime favourite under the firefighting theme yes i agree this set is wonderful even today and is one of the best fire kits ever release and actually realistic scale is not really a necessity in lego  its just my personal taste for example ive never liked the tiny planes in the old airports that much but i can see why a lot of people like them better than the new ones edited by grevious 28 july 2008  0317 pm	neutral
one of my all time favourite i still love it even after all these years though it did always seem a bit out of place as when i was a child i’d never seen a similar looking fire appliance in the uk	positive

navy trooper fenson on jul 21 2008 0725 pm said nice pictures but three questions 1 how many pages do the instruction books have 2 what are the spare parts or does this laaty come with two clonecommanderequipment sets and four assaij ventress lightsaberhilts 3 where did you get it 4 how much did it cost i can answer one he comes from norway	neutral
so basically you cited as faults what everybody had been complaining about since the first information of the set arrived skeletal interior and lack of clones although i didnt realize it didnt have numbered backs that really is just ridiculous lego finally comes up with a very intelligent solution to the frustration seen when building large sets but then they neglect to implement it wtf lame still this may be the only clone wars set i buy besides the exclusives the exterior which imo is the only part that matters looks so fantastic i dont care about clones i have enough of those already and at 90 its still a better buy than the rgs the torrent is cool but not as cool as the fighter tank or dgs imo awesome inconstruction pics	positive
funny minifig actions there i do love the atte a definite buy for walker fans	positive
thank you that was what i guessed  but i didnt see any detailed pictures of 10195 do we have the instructins or something now is that how dropship lifts the walker 	neutral
yeah when i built it i wondered for a long time i considered many possiblities temporarily like either tlc had gone crazy or i had missed a page in the instructions	neutral
jimbutcher on jul 28 2008 1220 am said hey everyone i just got the rgs yesterday at tru after i came home from camp i saw all of the topics that i missed and noticed a minireview and a review with one pic so i thought id make a huge shiny new review that has lots of pictures and all of the requirements of kimts index im about halfway through building it so expect the full review tomorrow hoope you guys will like it mabye you shouldnt reserve threads and actually wait till your done the threads wont run off i assure you	neutral
okay if this were the first review of the set id understand your want to reserve a thread for your review but seriously there are already reviews out there couldnt you have just waited at least until you had actually built the thing or even better until the review was actually done sorry if im being to harsh but im quite sick of these blablabla set review  will be up soon its getting quite annoying peace	neutral
thank you oky wan and apologies to the rest of you guys i guess i was rushing a bit and didnt think this through it was wrong of me to reserve a review if someone does an indepth review before me someone please close this topic otherwise i guess i will do it again many apologies for opening this topic before i actually had a review bad example from me very sorry	neutral

i got this set in the spring during my buy every new castle set availableseason granted i couldnt afford all of them but i do have most of them now anyway i love the action elements to this set and the siege tower really does look wicked id like to attach the crownie tower to the kings castle to see how it fits but i unfortunately dont own that set yet i also love the turning head of the soldier and ive used it in my princess questcomic as well along with the turning head of the princess the troll leader brings good variety to the army of trolls but they still could use another face type and more torso options its a nice review in any case although the set pretty much speaks for itself	positive
hey good review and good photos i also got this set just recently and i wasnt very enthusiastic about it at the beginning but after i built it i could appreciate it the siege engine is very nice but my complaint has do with the proportions of the knights tower in respect to the trolls machine  its a bit smaller and less bulkier that complaint has to go with some other sets too for example the troll warship is really humongous  it feels like it can load the evil wizards tower and sail off other than that  a good set i like it 45 from me	positive
excellent review and your pictures are very good i look forward to seeing more review i really like this set i got it some time ago and keep meaning to post some pictures of it going up against some of the older castles	positive
i scream clone on jul 29 2008 0639 pm said i dont suppose you have seen the troll impulse in aus yet nah got it in singapore when i was on a business trip got like 10 of the things now theyre 650 sing	neutral
great review this is an awesome set besides knocking down the wall at the side can the battering ram do any other damage to the tower ex reducing it to rubble bricks and why cant the orc just jump out of the hole in the back do they need to do that much unnecessary damage to the tower	neutral
when i first saw this topic i thought oh great another review of this set however im glad you posted it now your pics are great and well it was just a generally good review im looking forward to seeing more peace	positive
whitefang on jul 30 2008 1256 am said pedro for your first review you have amaze me with your photo session and the strucutre of your review i am very impressed by your high quality pictures you have done an excellent job i completely agree this is an amazing review  bits of humor great photography and detailed descriptionsphotos based upon this review ive placed an order for this set along with some convincing from amazons 20 sale  the only drawbacks in this set that i can see concerns the tower with it being 1 small compared to the seige tower and 2 missing a few walls however this is also the joy of lego as one can simply purchase a few bricks and build their own walls andor expand the towers size or even attach it to a castle of course this increases the price of the set but considering how cheap bricks are on bricklink tower raid is still a very good value i hope you continue doing reviews pedro	positive
nice short review although a little hard to read i agree that this set is a really great one	positive
jimbutcher on jul 29 2008 0102 am said nice short review although a little hard to read i agree that this set is a really great one how is it hard to read but thanks for the review great little set but i do agree that it could have used a russian or two maybe oxley too darthperson	positive

time for my first review 7673 magnaguard starfighter peices 431  of figs 2 price 4499 usd the box pretty decent size box for the price magnaguards the normal box stuff front of the ship back open cockpit back of the box contents dss dreaded sticker sheet first manual page because its super important not to build on carpet  fig build the magna guard head imo its beautiful  the purple cone cape box the capes just one the magnaguard back the parts nicely sorted the new windshield piece beautiful the first step seccond step more steps of the main body the wing assembly sorry for the blur attached opposite wing both attached rear engine build the staffs i have mine set up differently than in the instructions i put one cone over the hump on one end of the staff and the other in the original spot then to load them onto the fighter all you do is push the original placed cone down and put it right in this way the staff looks better and it works the same see it slides right in skeletal parts of sides attached close up bottom both wings attached hidden missle launcher raised up another shot staffs attached complete side panel side pods complete swooshable finished time to complete 2hrs okay overall rating time price 910 could have been 4000 usd but due to new molds this is understandable parts 910 could have hade more dark red but thats imo plus i love dark red build time 810 i took my time on this and enjoyed the techniques the designers intricated also taking pics added to the time quite a bit playability 710 the main playability functions are the missle launchers in the back and the sliding cockpit my only gripe with these is they dont set right with the other slopes on the top also the inside of the cockpit is easily modded for regular size minifigs just pop a handlebar piece in the already provided arm in the cockpit and bam your favorite figs can have a ride it also helps keep the magnaguards in place if they hold it minifigs 1010 imo the new molds are great the only downfall is the right arm on both is less moveable due to the hard plastic turbanthing connected to the head swooshability 910 the starfighter is pretty sleek and very swooshable design 910 the most important aspect and this ones a winner its only a nine because it needs to have smoother edges in a few spots but they are easily modable overall score 87 i think its an awesome set very satisfying 2008 sw on dsr dsr edited by kimt 04 august 2008  1149 am indexed	positive

that was an intresting race and i was split between the two until i saw whitefangs reply and the fact you can use the sprinter as a militery thingwhich you could do for both but sprinter just pulls it off better and i like the radar on the back of it so ill have to go with the street sprinter thanks for the nice topic brickster	positive
i like the coast guard one but dinos eat coast guard people so dinos ftw and i think the dino bike would fit in with my collection pretty well	positive
i like the dino thingy because of the pieces and the dino is a lot of fun on its own i know thats akward	positive
dino attack for me you just cant say no to a huge bazooka though the tan and dark red works for me too	positive
the rancor on aug 2 2008 0939 am said i wish i had that but ill have to make do with the much less violent european version dino 2010 not attack heres a comaprison european version usa etc version theres a subtle difference but i prefer the us one i did not know that europe had a different quad or at least one without the bazooka interesting that the gun was removed from the european sets or added to the us sets i sort of like the chain i also notice a big difference in the boxart destroyed city to prehistoric volcano i wonder if the story was different as well thanks for sharing a good picture  well it does look like the dino quad has the upper hand almost double the votes	positive
ooooooh this is a very hard choicei like this new coast guard theme but i loved dino attackthe dino attack set has a weird looking gunbut imo the coast guard set lookscleaner if you get what i meanthe little dinolizard thing is practically worthless thats why i have a bin full of those little guysi want to keep liking dino attack i just cantso i know your like just get to the point already so i guess i have to go with coast guard thebrickster on aug 3 2008 0941 am said i did not know that europe had a different quad or at least one without the bazooka interesting that the gun was removed from the european sets or added to the us sets i sort of like the chain i also notice a big difference in the boxart destroyed city to prehistoric volcano i wonder if the story was different as well thanks for sharing a good picture  well it does look like the dino quad has the upper hand almost double the votes wow i would have so much wanted the european one more than the us one i mean that bazooka or as they called it a sonic screamer looks very silly	positive
price 569 kr minifigs 2 pieces 592 stickers 9 my sticker sheet wasn’t curled up overview before i start i will apologize for the bad quality of the pictures it is getting dark here right now so some of the pictures are a bit dark 1 minifigs the set comes with two of the new clone wars clone troopers which in my opinion are pretty cool it also comes with two short blasters and a bag of clone accessories figs with helmets figs without helmets 2 the tank this thing is huge 25cm long and 22cm wide and far oversized in my opinion but looks great nonetheless i very much like the white and dark red color scheme mixed with a bit of lime green even though there is no lime green bricks   left side right side back side both of the wings contain a hidden compartment to store the blasters and a part that rotates to reveal three flickfire missiles the front opens up as well to reveal the engine the side guns and the gun on the top rotate inside the cockpit is space for two figs one seated in front of two computer screens and one placed in a moveable seat which moves up and down allowing the fig to pop up the top hatch and staying hidden while the hatch is closed this function is triggered by opening the backdoor hidden compartment and missiles engine top hatch openclosed interior 3 rating build 910 not much to say here minifigs 710 an extra fig or two would have been great eventually a jedi or a commando design 810 this only looses a couple of points for being oversized but it’s a great looking model parts 1010 at 592 parts this is one of the cw sets with the best partsprice ratio price 810 sure this thing is great but i think its overpriced at 569 kr approx 120 when build it feels more like a 450 kr set final verdict 910 despite some flaws this thing is definitely recommended and it looks great on your shelf too 	positive
dovchenko on aug 1 2008 0747 pm said finally a review of this thanks 120 bucks this tank looks tiny and though its amazingly detailed it should have been smaller and only 4050 bucks at most it just doesnt play that big a part man good pieces and mechanisms but no ones going to both buying a 120 buck tank no offence not unless it its the atte 120 is the price here in denmark it will most likely be the same price as the v19 torrent everywhere else so you dont have to worry about that	neutral
one question do the top panels on the rotating rocket assembly mounted in the skids pop off regularly when you flip them back and forth the ones on the version i built from the instructions posted online seem to eject with the slightest provocation	neutral
thanks for the review christian i was hoping for one soon  this set really looks good but as you said rather big the figs are good and i agree that kiadi mundi should be included i like the hidden compartments for the blasters and missiles and the cockpit is really cool considering it seats two i thought only one i will surely pick this up sometime	positive

nice review thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts looks like a really nice set and ill be picking it up eventually when it makes it to the us	positive
do you have any pics of the wheels i wanna see what those are like	neutral
this is my favorite set in the clone wars wave and ill be picking it up without a doubt that is whenever the folks at lego decide that its okay for us to buy their sets in us	positive
thank you for the first ever review of the fighter tank i like this set and every features it offers but i think that the engine could have a better look than just four green cylinders in a grey piece	negative
great review i really like the look of this set and having played a lot of battlefront i am quite keen to pick one up in australia when it comes out after the ds is paid off looks like some nice greebling and cool colour scheme too	positive
i am 100 going to get this set it should be about 55 and if it is ill get it without a doubt i just hope that this set is 5060 if it isnt then we have a problem	positive
this set costs a s100 in singaporei went to hng kong too see lego and the shops there are more expensive by a few dollarshoweveri went to australia before and everything there is the same price but when there is a sale it becomes very cheapanyway thanks for the reviewi was wondering about the details of this setthe clones faces look a lot like anakins facewhy is that soi thought it is supposed to look like jangos	neutral
christian thanks for this outstanding review i have been waiting for this moment for someone to do up an excellent review like this republic fighter tank is my 2nd favourite set in my clone wars list the 2 clone troopers could be easily add up to your rgs since it offer only more trooper however i felt that this set is quite overpriced in fact all clone war sets are very expensive the fighter tank has a very great color combination of red and white to represent the republic the wheels below is the most impressive feature which enable the hovering feel the hatch is a neat feature as well however i noticed there is a rubber band within the control panel may i know what is it for i really enjoy viewing this review you had given the insight which will eventually determined whether to get it any sooner or later pr0visorak on aug 2 2008 0535 pm said this set costs a s100 in singaporei went to hng kong too see lego and the shops there are more expensive by a few dollarshoweveri went to australia before and everything there is the same price but when there is a sale it becomes very cheap hello pr0visorak you are from singapore as well welcome to eurobricks i hope you will do an introduction to the rest of the members in this forum in singapore it cost sgd10000 in fact that was the promotional price therefore there is no further discount for it	positive
i personally think this is a great set but a little pricey i wish it was available in the us though	positive
good review i would get this set but sadly they dont have it anymore i wish they did to get those sweet figs the battle droid colors are sweet the only set with geonosians	neutral
i am fairly confident that something involoving geonosis will be released in 2010 but any way i had this set  one of my first ones but i droped the ship and it blew up i found all the pieces but in never rebuilt the ship although i still have the figs ant the canon overall this set was above average in my opinion great review	positive
great review really shows off the main aspects of the set wish i had picked up a tie when they were around dsr	positive
and now for something completely different tiny turbos belonging to the racers line when i saw 8147 bullet run on sh for half the price i couldn´t resist buying it we had a lot of fun celebrating a bagbuild at our event using the 8150 zx turbo of that theme so i knew what would expect me with this extended set price normal 4999€ now 2499€ well i paid 3499€ in a lego store but that´s another story bricks 796 minifigs  hey this is tiny turbos stupid stickers don´t ask or read further the open box reveals seven polybags some with more smaller polybags inside the instruction booklet 2 ramps and the sticker sheet of course i put all of the bags on the table and not on the floor hey tlc didn´t print this on the first page of the building instructions and you won´t see any piece callouts as well on the other hand this is not adifficult build so why show them still there is an inventory list of all bricks at the end of the instructions note the giant sticker sheet we all now the dss but that is a new kind of extra super large sticker sheet it holds 82 stickers more to that later on the build is quite basic the only nonconventional parts of the build were the two slammers and the most annoying part was fiddling the rubber band of the holder without destroying it bag 1 easy beginning building the lime car the limo and the two slammers nothing exciting about the lime car but the limo was neat it´s an 18 studs long car the normal racers are abot 10 studs long nice way to put the horns on the back the slammers mmmmh nice invention if they would actually do something they are supposed to give the tubros a kick in the butt to speed them up but the result is a 80 cm long run and that´s it i had expected more acceleration from the slammers but it´s also fun to play with the cars without slamming them bag 2 convoy time the tow truck and the fuel truck the tow truck is a great idea and a good addition to the set the cars are supposed to crash  how do they get back home well here´s the answer quite american layout of the truck and it´s very well done horns 5 flashing lights and a right color choice you can move the arm up and down and pull out the hook note the metallic silver antennae the fuel tank has got a secret function it may break on the middle of the trailer therefore it has a hinge build in the bottom city fire mayhem and there´s no fire engine bag 3 long longer how long can a tiny truck be the pipe truck an unexpected buggy and the red racer 36 studs long the pipe truck breaks every convention the cabin is almost the same like the tow truck and the fuel truck and that is the good part of it the trailer has to carry pipes and is functional as well as it can commute sidewarts it looks quite unrealistic as well and you cannot drive this beast on tiny roads good for another crash but there are more cars in this bag now this was a surprise a buggy this is the only 6wide car but just because the wheels are large monster truck madness i don´t care for those cars personally a disappointment i would have preferred another racer  for variety though did i say another racer here we are the red devil great looking a real fast shape and red the best racer in this set vrooommm this is the most played with car of the set not only from me  as you may have noticed i didn´t put any stickers so far i don´t like stickers especially when placed over two or more bricks and here you are supposed to do it several times of course the cars look better with stickers on but they are also great without stickers only the fuel truck looks boring without my sons didn´t know there were supposed to be stickers and they didn´t ask for them so everything is allright here´s a closeup of the sticker sheet did i already mention it was 82 stickers  the only exception i made using sticker was for bag 4 bag 4 you go here you pay the highway toll booth the only immobile part of the set but great to brake though the barriers that is fun i only put on stickers on 2x2 plates where i had the idea to use those plates further on on different other mocs this looks a bit boring without the other stickers i admit but still no cut off to the playability there are also two ramps belonging to the set these only make sense if you are able to speed up the racers with the slammers and hit the ramps correctly i had problems with that so they are on the shelves now could be a lot fun making a contest though like this picture of the inventories frontpage all cars put together the usual leftovers all in all this is a great set to call ones own i did not regret buying it especially when it was 50 off even normal price would not have been too much build great for smaller children boring to afols 510 special brickscolors none all basics 310 design i love the tiny turbos´ size and design 910 playability 1 because of the slammers another 1 because no minifigscale but that is not the intention of the set still 910 pricepiece ratio dang it´s not on sale any more but if you hurry you could still grab one in the lego stores 1010 all in all 8510 and a clear recommendation it was and still is a set to play with your children the size fits perfectly to matchbox cars and that was exactly what my younger son did can you find all of the cars included in the set ps after buying this set i won an ebay auction with another tiny turbos set  8135 bridge chase this is even more fun i will soon care for a review with some never seen phototricks as well stay tuned edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0702 pm indexed	neutral
thanks for the review ill definately get this set sooner or later imo the tiny turbos are awesome i actually bought nearly every set so far built the models added the stickers and packed them away in ziplock bags in the attic sadly i dont have display room for them yet a fine set carwise dump the slammers and buildings into the spare bag and keep the cars kimt tiny turbos on	positive

great review i bought this set when it came out but sold it a couple years later for some extra cash i have no regrets selling this one as i was never really impressed with it different story for the 4483 atat  oh how i wish i still had that one the snowspeeder was alright just didnt have any sort of wow factor to it the best part of the set is probably the rebel trooper looking at the last photo in your review looks like youre about to have a major battle in your hallway apart from the snowspeeder  motorized atat i see the arc170 fighter grievouss starfighter and is that a podracer i see  and what is the set with the treads its not star wars but looks like a pretty cool set maybe a mission mars vehicle	positive
skipper 24 on aug 4 2008 1252 pm said podracer not sure where you got that from i didnt have them out i noticed the minifig between the grievous starfighter  the moddino2010 vehicle and it looked like a little person sitting in the pod of his podracer guess my eyes are playing tricks on me  my eyesight is shot  my wife keeps pushing me to go visit the optometrist	neutral

7153 jango fetts slave 1 review parts 358 figs 2 price £2000 i got it on offer i think the rrp was £40 the only set to include jango fett and young boba also the decals on jango are from fine clonier im trying to say they dont came with the set 1 manual worn manual random page another random page looking at this page you can that this set has numbered bags back cover look how old yodas computer looks  2 general set and minifigs the sets contents jango with his hair on jango with helmet on with front view of face twist jangos head to initiate super bounty hunter mode jangos doubled sided head boba nothing to special although i think the torso and head are exclusive to the set 3 the ship not really scaled up right as you can see the guns can rotate the central sections interior not sure what this is is it a hyperdrive or a bomb or something there are these side panels on both sides behind the panels a secret compartment trans orange minifig heads in the compartment i think theyre supposed to be saturnic charges side storage compartment the back of the ship how those trans orange minifig heads fallout there is a magnet on the inside of the ship but for what the secret prison which also has a magnet on the top so it can stay on but easily come out the doors on it can lift up to put prisoners inside 1 of 2 identical wing things they can fold for flight mode the controls bottom jet thing let me out of here the prison is great for capturing small children 4 overall build 710 impossible to build without a hard stable surface minifigs 1010 2 exclusive figs design 710 nowhere near to scale but has some nice features parts 810 good parts like that big cockpit canopy price 910 for the price i got it was pretty good especially with the figs it comes with playability 710 lots of features but it would be better if it came with a jsf overall 910 lots of features and comes with exclusive minifigs edited by kimt 04 august 2008  1144 am indexed	positive
i have all three of the slave i ships and i agree with kimtalthough it is a very small compact ship the first slave i boba fett is still the sturdiest the newest slave i boba fett is not bad and is of much better construction than this slave i from jango fett even though i like the size and scale of the jango slave i and the newest boba fett slave iwhen you pick that very first one up it had the feeling ofyou can throw me against the wall drop me off the roof of your house or let 4 two year olds play with meim not gonna break at least thatss my opinion good review	positive

i remember having this set actually i even still have it at least the pars are somewhere  when i was a child and i used it for making races as it is there for all these many reviews let me think again at that i also planned to make some reviews for the town section i got your message thebrickster dont worry i got a lot to do at the moment but i should find some time this upcoming week	neutral
this little set really makes my point small playable inspiration to build the set into a few other models great set i wish i had it my town is going to need more vehicles i really miss main model instructions with alternate build ideas	neutral
i got the original version of this set with the luls mace windu figure when tlc released the nonluls version i managed to swap  they sent me the new version and a clone trooper iirc and i mailed them back the old version this was a great set the suspension worked great and it rolled magnificently nice review with good photos but again your price is a little off £6999 is the rrp unless the price you paid was £80 tk	positive
good set but its flimsy as sin but that may have been my rush job building it mine got shoved off a bed oh and i lost my light up mace  propably somewhere within the blue bin o doom™ aka the brick bucket™ or blocknull™  edited by maiq the liar 04 august 2008  1015 pm	neutral
nice review again skipper i passed on this one because of the price but its a nice set good for you for getting the newer version with nonlul mace and an extra clone that purple blade sure is a beauty the tank itself is alright just an atat on wheels in my opinion the turret is great though and so is the speeder bike i didnt realize that the jet pack had two nailguns harpoon guns on it i thought that the nailgun was a new piece but the jetpack is very cool	positive
6701 space minifigures review set 6701 set name space minifigures released 1983 pieces 36 including minifigs minifigs 6 brickshelf gallery peeroncom bricklink bricksetcom introcomment as i reignited my love for classic space a few years ago i decided to start hunting sets i didnt have this small one fell into my lap very cheap with box and minifigs in great condition so now ive resized the pics and done the review and no i am not envious of this forumreallyim not the box the box is pretty neat it has a very comfortable size compared to modern boxes and the back of it shows what you get i like the way they tlg split the minifigs and arranged everything neatly front rear sadly the box has seen better days but its age taken into consideration i think its just fine the figs a fine collection of red white and yellow space figs some great accesories to go as well not much more to say except this was a great armybuilderset a true must have for most classic space fans the verdict its kinda hard rating this set since its a minifig supplemental set no design or colourscheme to comment on it has a lot of playability since figs will always come in handy when buildingplaying with your space sets kimt	positive
thanks for the review kimt i gave this above average i believe i had this one but it was so long ago im still a bit freaked out by the yellow ones when i emerged from my dark ages i kept thinking gee i miss the people packs but now that i have over 500 minifigures i dont feel that way anymore even so i wish they would rerelease some of the classic old ones	neutral
i voted above average as well but back in 1983 i would have probably gone much lower sadly i wasnt as interested in minifigs at the time i appreciated the ones i had but i really just wanted ships or bases and would have gladly passed this by for something with one or two figures and a small moon rover i skipped all of the classic minifig sets space castle and town it was only upon coming out of my dark ages that i went minifig crazy for me this is above average because of the accessories without them its an average set with a small brick built droid or a rover it would be outstanding that said id buy at least 10 copies now though id rather have a 4 figure set with one of each colour including blue i never had blue back then i think castle lured me away thanks for an interesting review it gives me a chance to further explore why i changed from shipset to minifig fan and bore all of eb with it	neutral
pretty nice set but the newer minifig packs had greater variety in both the figures and equipment my favorite one among all of them is 6704 which is also the only instance of both blacktrons appearing in one set quote i wonder why this set had no blue or black astronauts whatever the case i always loved the small minifig sets that lego released as i could never get enough astronauts my favorite was the set of futuron astronauts i think the blue and black guys hadnt yet been released at the time of this set	positive
first thanks simonjedi for a great review im interested in what you think of the hydrolics i could spend hours just deploying and undeploying the wings and landing gear im a little worried the very first batch of the hydrolic piece for umm i think it was the offroad 4x4 technic set was very fragile and broke after a few uses these seem to be holding up but im anxious to see if they hold up after 100200 uses quote namewalter kovacs dateaug 4 2008 1147 am post337841 those black pieces used on the landing gear look very bioniclelike if they havent been used before id suspect they will be not that im a bionicle expert or anything quote right you are they are bionicle bohrok head pieces so pretty old in bionicle terms and fairly useless in my opinion but they do make interesting looking landing gear as i deploy and redeploy the wings and landing gear hopefully well get a pilot in the battle pack to help mitigate the fact we only get one here tohst	positive
the printed part isnt new it came with 10178 motorized atat walker also nice review i would get the set if it was a little cheaper or came with more than 1 fig whyhas it got 2 instruction books the set isnt particularly big	neutral
thanks for the review ive added it to the index and added a poll in which members can vote their opinion on this set i think this is a very good set i like the colours and the very playable feature that allows the wings to lock in attack formation now all i need is to buy this baby edit i gave it an above average rating since its well designed looks sturdy and fits the sw theme sets perfectly	positive
the v19 was my first tcw set i buyed it when i was visiting my father i just wanted to build it there and i do so but how do you will get sthbig like this with in the train so i had to destroy him when i was still home again i had to build it 3 times because the mechanic dont works i only can say that the v19 is one of the best tcw sets thanks to you for the review simonjedi  i just wanted to make one in german but now i neednt to make it	positive
the ability for it to fold in and out of attack position has wowed me this is my top priority now thanks for making up my mind	positive
hydraulic wings i am very impressed and am now considering getting this set purely because of this funciton i am just curious as to know why are there sand green parts on the bottom of the v19 is it visible when the model is completed i am also pleased to see tlc giving us a printed cockpit computer this time around	positive

cool review i actually have two of these i got one for christmas when it was rereleased in 2003 and another one in a charity shop a few months later for €5 i love the minifigs even if they all have smileys and having two sets of them can really fill up a town	positive
really nice train i always wished tlg would have made the passenger ir train longer and maybe used some of the nice features of this train i still love that faucet piece	positive
hairy ruben on aug 5 2008 1200 am said the interior of the two however is laid out a bit differently the space in the front carriage is occupied by a cockpit or whatever it is called in trains and some space to store your cable connecting the front lights with the engine i can imagine it must get quite cramped and dangerous for the minifig driver with all the cabling further back we have a quite random weird looking engine one part reminded me rather of a jet engine on a commercial airplane the engine is accessible by means of the two side cargo doors at the end of our first carriage we hit what looks like the trains restaurant two tables and no chairs there shouldnt be so much of the light cable in the front section or cockpit most of the cable should be in the central part of the train then it is not so crowded for the engine driver i have never had a problem with the cable and the space available for it the only problem i had was that the cable had a loose contact after some time when the train went into a curve cant remember if it was a left or right curve the light went off i have now got the same problem with the cable that i put into my santa fe super chief always when the engine turns into a right curve the light goes off my dad could repair the cable for the metroliner even though he is quite skilled at repairing electronic things he found it very difficult to repair since there were no screws to open the electronic plate it annoyed him a lot so ive been asking myself if i should really bother him with a second cable with the same problem the train set itself is outstanding and thats what i voted for i only have the legend 10001 but its 99 identical to 4558 i also have club car 4547 i dont have the legend club car 10002 the reason for this is i always had the choice between one big lego set or several small ones for christmas when i was a child i always went for several small ones metroliner 4558 would have been a big train set but i really wanted a passenger car so i bought 4547 with my savings without having the metroliner i was quite happy when the metroliner was rereleased i bought it with my own money then i could finally use the club car with the train it was created for edited by legotrainfan 15 august 2008  0755 pm	neutral
i dont like the set and i do like the set the reason why i like it it looks good the reason why i hate it this train was the first train for the new 9v system and it means to me the end of the beautiful 12v series for this last reason i own this set i voted average only strange they named it metroliner in holland when we speak of a metro i need to think at short distance trains only used in big cities like rotterdam and your minifigs at pic aint right according the instruction 	neutral
panda9001100 on aug 16 2008 0737 am said only strange they named it metroliner in holland when we speak of a metro i need to think at short distance trains only used in big cities like rotterdam it was only named metroliner in the us because of the color scheme is similar to the reallife metroliner i believe in eu it was called the euroexpress and probably just passenger train wherever that would be suitable the productnumber 4558 is universal though hairy ruben you dont have a review of the doubledeckerclub car on the way do you i myself never got it and i am seriously considering buying one from bricklink plus it is moreorless an requirement for this train one of very few doubledecker cars to actually stay within the general outer dimensions of the train	neutral
my favourite favourite favourite old set its too bad i was born 2 years after its release i would have had a major interest in classic town i might actually get this one on bricklink not that itll go for a good price ill only buy if it does you see an outstanding a highly useful and wellmade set that really just stands out from its counterparts edit nevermind edited by dovchenko 16 august 2008  1025 am	positive
well it makes the latest trains look crap	neutral
i never got this set i spent a long time after one christmas trying to get and failed miserably admittedly i was much younger then it has however remained one of my most sought after items but i’ve still never got around to getting one the set generally makes me rather nostalgic for a time when the trains were painted in simple liveries like that one anyway it seems an excellent set from what i’ve seen and the figure selection is amazing i hope lego produce something as good as this when the new trains are released next year	positive
i got my indy exclusive in the mail today packaging front back instructions minifigs this set comes with 1 minifig the standard indy with hat and whipno satchel the build i am really happy with the amount of frown headlight bricks that come with this set 12 in all the mudguards are cleverly built with 1 x 2 panels and 1 x 1 panel corners in dark green in the first 2 pages of the instructions there are a lot of great pieces this set would sell like mad if it were released for sale parts monkeys alone would go insane buying these up for the dark green and frown pieces the body of the car consists of black plates brackets and modified bricks with curved tops that allow the dark green mudguards to just peak out cool technique the grill looks cool using only six pieces i wish all small sets were this unique and cool heres the completed jeep it looks a little small for an actual jeep but for a brickmaster set its awesome imo some more detail shots of the set with indy in the drivers seat i hope they take brickmaster exclusives overseas because itd be awesome if everybody could get these my buddy copmike would probably love to be the first to review this set so ive dedicated my review comic to him my rating playability 810 you need to add some other sets and characters to really play with this set design 910 great techniques and inclusion of rare parts but loses a point for being an unrealistic size for a jeep price 1010 part of the brickmaster package it is a reasonable prize for an exclusive set and everything else that comes with the subscription overall 910 great but not perfect and definitely needs to be offered overseas lego would make a ton of money releasing this for sale imo as it really is a terrific small set	positive
outstanding set and review thanks for presenting it ive had this since it first came out but didnt think it would be that impressive so i didnt bother opening it now im tempted aside from the slight size issue i cant find anything here to gripe about except for the limited availability i want 5 i think that makes me a parts monkey eek eek youre exactly right about this selling like mad its another one of those missed opportunities for tlg sure its nice to get people to subscribe by offering it as part of brickmaster but in the long run put it in the stores for 6 and sell a million just give us indys manbag we need it for postal employees and such as is the running joke whenever i comment on one of your reviews id give this a solid 985 not out of anything just 985 or in clearer terms  12 though i voted 5	positive
nice review i would like to get this set unfortunately i dont get brickmaster mag and the prices on bl ebay will most likely be ridiculous i wonder why indy doesnt come with his murse man purse in this set thats the best part of the fig the jeep itself is very nice especially with the dark green by the way what is frown brownish something i guess oh yeah and funny comic	positive

this set easily is above average for me i had this as a little child and whenever any of my relatives came to visit us they brought me some lego usually it was either this set or 6844 the really nice thing about this set are the alternate builds for the low price you got a nice range of parts and cool ideas what to build with them you could build a fleet of rovers or the alternates and everytime it was huge fun 	positive

this is a very nice looking set it could do with a few more clones but hopefully that will be fixed next year with battle packs back to the set i think the colors on this are great i love dark blue and the design is pretty good too it seems to be pretty accurate compared to the real thing thanks for the review	positive

set 7680  the twilight theme star wars year released 2008 piece count 882 price aud14999 or 15999 if you buy at tru 9999 euro us9999 pity the twilight when rumours of the set name first circulated speculation was swift twilight  that suggests something sleek elegant and mysterious anticipation mounted fanfrenzy grew finally a pic leaked and the verdict was clunkadunk it appeared that in the jedi offseason anakin was running something that looked like an intergalactic garbage scow like roger wilco in the old sierra space quest pc games blocky and bley seemed to sum it up the set went from being one of the most anticipated to one of the least liked of 2008 pretty much instantly its a mark of that dislike that in the eb clone wars review feeding frenzy nobody has so far even bothered to post a few pics of this set even 2 weeks after its official release im here to redress that imbalance now and find out if 7680 is as horrendous as everyone originally thought part 1 box  parts front of the box its quite big same size as the 10144 sandcrawler annoyingly its the old style with the perforated corners that you have to tear to flip open the lid detail of the back showing set functions interior of the box  a lot of wasted space the set comes with 2 instruction manuals each 76 pages and no dss sheet polybags 13 of em like the other cw sets these are unnumbered parts ahoy you can tell at a glance that this set is comparable to the atte although there a large proportion of the 800 parts here are technic pins and bley plates part 2 minifigs and build the set comes with 4 figs or 35 depending on how you look at rotta  anakin ahsoka r2d2 and rotta very disappointing that theres nothing new here for such a highpriced exclusive although i guess it is maybe movie accurate anyway to paraphrase the wise patsy stone you can never have enough hats shoes or new anakin ahsoka hairpieces so its not too bad pics of the build in progress a quarter of the way through we can already see that this is one of those convoluted technic frames with some plates affixed type builds halfway and the smaller wing is added at the three quarter mark the giant single wing is added and voila done the final quarter is a race to attach all the exterior surfaces and details such as the engine and escape pod the build itself is a mixed blessing it is very technic oriented im not a technically minded person and dont really have much of a conceptual grasp of how everything functions until i see the final result so i find these type of builds a little uninteresting pins axles and beams give me bricks any day i really liked the 7676 gunship and the 7679 fighter tank although they do contain some technic framework they are largely brickbuilt ships especially the fighter tank which is solid largely brick built and full of neat functions the 7680 build is one of the most technicy builds ive ever undergone in a system set akin to the experience of building the 10178 motorised atat but whereas with that set you could understand the need for a technic framework the thing walks a lot of this seemed excessive yes the twilight does some have nice functions and it is so large and heavy it does need a strong skeleton but to me it just seemed too much and aesthetics have been sacrificed for in some cases limited functionality i will discuss in more detail what i mean as i look at different parts of the set on the upside this is the only nonsymmetric set in the cw range so at least every page and new step brings something different part 3 a closer view closeup of the main body of the ship fronton it is welldesigned how the figs appear in line of sight unlike the 6211 where jabba and leia were photoshopped in to the box art dont ask what rotta is doing out of the line of vision there some things are better left unsaid side view showing escape pod smaller cylinder and drive top view rear view showing back door the rear deck is huge indeed the whole ship is huge oddly so i dont know if this is moviescale or not but ive seen people complain the fighter tank is too big  and that set is nothing compared to this baby its wider than the gunship and in wingspan and length is almost bigger heres a few pics next to an mtt for comparison pretty big hey turning to the dark side must be good for business even if all you can buy is a rusty old beast like this at least you could comfortably squash pretty much every vehicle in the opposing fleet just by landing on it at least now you can see why it costs so much the official pics make it look smaller somehow by truncating the rear and wing the ship is in fact so big you cant really pose it with wings open  only hold it that way i was too lazy to build a giant transclear support strut so propped it up on a shoebox instead the wing opens very neatly  you push a technic lever and a pin holding the bottom wing pops out quite smoothly the little top turret can move up and down as well to get the full crossshaped effect part 4 features and functions the front cockpit folds down very neatly although i find the build here a little weak whee it goes all the way down to the floor the mechanism is cool but it takes up an awful lot of space basically the whole front is cockpit and all lego could manage for controls is 2 printed 1x2 tiles as well not pictured here but theyre attached to the part that folds up and down theres also no way for anyone to get in or out of the cockpit and an invisible windscreen technology has come a long way side view looking from wing r2d2 is here as well as some tools you can also glimpse here one of the main problems with the set despite being a huge boxy ship theres no interior none the twilight doesnt even have an internal floor all the room inside is taken up by the landing gear which folds up  again a clever function but it really gets in the way of the set as a whole kudos to the designer for coming up with stable working landing gear but too clever by half if it means that this giant ship ends up basically being one tiny cockpit and a rear door at the back that doesnt lead to any interior underside showing landing gear when open and closed  when the wing is folded down the gear is locked in place which is pretty neat spaceconsuming but neat the rear section the door when opened reveals an orange cupboard and a towline as ahsoka uses in the box art the door clicks into place when open and can be released by pressing the technic bit at the top again clever but pointless as you cant get inside ahsoka can indulge in a little recreational bungeejumping if she so wishes the rear deck is so large that it is wasted just being used so ahsoka can bungeejump i came up with a much better use for it outdoor garden despite having one roboticised hand anakin was still quite the green thumb and his lightsaber was very useful as a hedge trimmer so much so that he set up a side business between rottarescue missions heres a promotional postcard a few other bits and pieces the gun turret on the enormous megawing can only hold one flick fire missile at a time you do get two though  rear engine detail the escape pod sits neatly on the side and is basically built the same way as the gunship bacta tank the pod sits on these tehcnic pins and is held in place by the light bley parts part 5 in conclusion the twilight is a huge ship with a huge amount of great functions  folding wing folding cockpit rear door escape pod retractable landing gear but this functionality comes at a price  a very complex technic build and zip interior compared with the gunship for example which is stuffed with nooks and crannies the twilight suffers in this respect i also think it is just too large  it doesnt really fit with the other craft and vehicles released with the clone wars line i may be wrong and it is movieaccurate but when you have all the cw sets laid out it does stick out like a poor thumb part selection is ok with the only interesting things being a few dark orange plates the orange cupboard and the big transneon green radar dish dont get me wrong i dont think this is a bad set at all its just the other cw sets are so sweet i would say its an above average set in a field crammed with excellent ones if youre a completist buy it but if for example youd rather invest in another atte to upgrade your republic army then i couldnt really disagree with you either and to finish on a light note id like to remind you that you do get another ahsoka hairpiece which can be used for all sorts of things ugha warrior upgrade dr inferno hair transplant and finally attack of the deadly blueringed octopus native to australias beaches and oceans thanks for reading	neutral
really awesome review sveltecorps  you did a really complete and indepth review of this beast and with your nice pics is really enjoyable reading your review so congrats  i like this ship even if it looks so bulky but i need to buy first other sets so maybe this beast will be landing in my collection the next year or this one if i am lucky  i can just ask for something can you post a pic of all your clone wars sets together with this one all the sets in one pic not many pics with this an each set  please  edited by darkrebellion 12 august 2008  0220 am	positive
thanks for the review now i thinnk i will buy this set btw i really like what you did to the back i might do the same to mine	positive
oh no anakin has gone over to the green side of the force well i guess someone had to review the clunkadunk eventually and you did a good job at it svelte corps i liked the punchline with the ahsokahairpiece swapping the ugha warrior upgrade is an interesting way of creating male togrutas and ahsoka looks even hotter with infernos hair matteo kenobi on aug 11 2008 0930 pm said if i am really impressed with it in the film i suppose that would change things but i will have to see  i wouldnt count on it spoiler after its first flight the twilight will crash and burn wookieepedia says so and you can see it in one of the trailers so i guess the twilight will stay mostly unbought poor clunkadunk	positive
i will not be picking this one up the main thing is that it simply looks akward it is big and bulky and seems to have random pieces on it with not reall streamline feel to it i also agree that for an exclusive that it 100 it needs more than just 35 mini figures anikan and ashoka and rotta already come in the atte which is cheaper and has more figures r2d2 is a figure that i am sure everybody has at least 4 or 5 of for that kind of money i expect something with at least one unique figure and more than 4 i also want just a cleaner and better designed set this is probably the letdown of the collection so far every collection needs one	negative
seems like tlc has done a pretty accurate representation of the ship the real fault for the ships messy design has to go to lucasfilm not tlc my guess is lucasfilm is trying to recapture that what a piece of junk magic of the millennium falcon i guess well have to wait to see the movie to see if they succeeded or not the idea of a space mobile home reminds me of the winnebago from spaceballs great review informative entertaining and opinionated so many people shy away from stating an actual opinion in their review for fear of offending anyone whats the point of making a review if you dont state what you think about it	neutral
looks fine but still that designs quite a downer	neutral

good review there my daughter loves the backyard garden of the twilight my opinion of the ship has changed after reading this thanks	positive
quote part 3 a closer viewb closeup of the main body of the ship fronton it is welldesigned how the figs appear in line of sight unlike the 6211 where jabba and leia were photoshopped in to the box art dont ask what rotta is doing out of the line of vision there some things are better left unsaid quote rotta can i get on your knee to look outside anakin no rotta can i pull this lever anakin dont touch it rotta i want to drive anakin if your not quitting i will get you back to that mean white woman rotta i need a clean diaper anakin ashoka get of the toilet its my turn to get some rest ashoka i thought i would become a padawan not a babysitter quote the rear deck is so large that it is wasted just being used so ahsoka can bungeejump i came up with a much better use for it outdoor garden despite having one roboticised hand anakin was still quite the green thumb and his lightsaber was very useful as a hedge trimmer so much so that he set up a side business between rottarescue missions heres a promotional postcard and to finish on a light note id like to remind you that you do get another ahsoka hairpiece which can be used for all sorts of things ugha warrior upgrade dr inferno hair transplant and finally attack of the deadly blueringed octopus native to australias beaches and oceans thanks for reading quote lol the garden would be lovely to see in gardeners world never thought patrick star also liked gardening	neutral
i bought four of these sets i guess this was the best selling impulse set so far great idea to have weapons and helmet choice as for the price id say 7090 is surprisingly cheap	positive
argh what i was typing kept getting deleted by my stupid keyboard on topic this looks like a great little set i could use a few of these but i havent seen any at a local store too bad for me i suspose  great review and i like the green plate on the bottom never can have too many greens for my small but expanding swamp im building hope i can pick some of these up eventualy	positive
another small set my local target doesnt have they dont have the best castle selection they only really have dwarven mines and castle seiges ill buy this if i see it there though because it looks like a great little set i could use the awesome knight and a skeleton that has a regular body so he looks like he is in armor	positive
im not a huge fan of this set but it is a great way to nab a fully mounted knight complete with a very attractive barding given that in prior years it wasnt possible to get a barded horse in such a small set this set is actually a decent way to build a mounted cavalry for your kingdom looking at bricklink it would probably cost as much to buy the knight horse and weapons separately and that doesnt take into account the skeleton or the extra bricks despite my indifference to this set i actually have purchased four of them in the past year simply because there isnt a cheaper way to acquire a mounted knight a quick question about the poll are we voting on the quality of the set or the quality of the review later edited by blueandwhite 13 august 2008  0550 am	neutral
this set is a great little bundle the kitted out knight skellie knight weapons and the few bricks for the fence and weapon rack the castle 07 barding here is very nice indeed the colour scheme of the new castle guys is great imo the light blue and blue work nicely together and against the grey background i dont really like the pearl grey helmet  it would be nicer in metallic silver like the visor i think interesting comment re the skellie helmet  i guess black normal knights helmet with visor would be quite nice for him i got this set as part of the complete castle collection from sh however i have extras of all the smaller sets and skeleton tower except i dont have another one of this set its on my list of sets to buy unfortunately it wasnt on sh for ireland when i was making later orders  quite an odd omission also last year castle 07 was exclusive to argos uk catalogue retailer who only had three sets not the joust i should see if the local toy store has it now though as they did stock some 07 castle in addition to 08 at the start of the year i think small sets like this should be well stocked in shops for a year or two  it surely doesnt do their sales much good to be so sporadically available sorry turned into a bit of a ramble anyways the point is that this set is good enough id pick up another the cobra that sucks about customs i try to keep my orders to within the €23 dutyfree limit for here in ireland if your imports are waylaid you pay 20 import duty 21 sales tax and a postage fee for the diversion to customs nasty edited by brickzone 13 august 2008  1115 am	positive
dj2005 on aug 29 2008 1126 am said im a bit curious does the knights helm have a hole for plume i can answer on behalf for kimt if memories served me right yes there is a hole for placing the knights plume do correct me wrong if i had answered wrongly its been awhile since i last touched my castle sets thanks kimt for this fine review this is one of the castle sets which i had bought high volume mainly for its horses barding and the weapons a great army builder and accessories for your castle armies this is an instant 5	positive
first things first the knights helm does have a spot for a plume now i really like this set and it was the first one i dug into when i got my collection in the mail it has a great selection of equipment for good or evil figures and the barding for the horse is outstanding my only wish was for one of the long chrome swords for the knights i think the new knights with the tall shield and chrome sword look excellent on foot and on horseback it would definitely be neat to revisit this set with another human knight instead of the skeleton make that change and add a lady to joust for and itd be bang on	positive
shoc on aug 13 2008 1128 am said they didnt want to encourage the drinking of alcohol in america but were fine encouraging it in other places maybe thats why my country has such a big problem with binge drinking or maybe not i think this was an early sign of american parents being hypersensitive to things wont somebody think of the children guarded inn was another set only sold in the shopathome and not in stores for the same reason	neutral
great review and great set i just wanted to comment on the beauty of the car included in this set it gets no better than a fourwide car and hinged roof with sunroof	positive

cpt pegleg blockbeard on aug 14 2008 0329 pm said over all a nice set i am a little confused by the dynamite though perhaps an easy way to go fishing hilarious i bet she threw out the penicillin and flare gun to make room for the axe and dynamite in her survival kit who wouldnt maybe shes a lost escapee	neutral
i got this set as well as a resq hovercraft this set is cool because of all the accessories and it come with a x team guy your set is also in much better condition than mine you have made me decide to rebuild it another great review thebrickster keep up the good work	positive
this helicopter is so cool and i agreed with you that this is a high playablity set its not common to see such a big scale helicopter which has two cockpits back then the color scheme works well for me with so much features such as the lowering of the grappling hook storage box storing of the gurney and etc one thing which can be improved onto the helicopter is the rotors it could be extended a little longer as the size of the helicopter is too big it makes the rotors rather weak as it is not able to support the weight i am confused why there is an extreme team personnel there i thought he was supposed to be recovered from the resq team although there is so many questions in my head such as why include the black tricycle bike extreme team and etc but this is still one very good set to play with too bad i had never seen this before somehow through your review i like it very much the only big scale helicopter which i owned is the 7738 coast guard helicopter and lift raft neverthless i gave this a 4 thanks brickster	positive
the helicopter looks nice and the resq minifigs were nice the diver minifig had once been a personal favorite of mine	positive
i stopped collecting lego sets in the early 90s because of this kind of sets ive always been a classic town fan and i really didnt liked the futuristic design of tlcs newer sets	negative
this set was my first set ever from the resq series and i loved it entirely ofcourse i modded it slightly here and there after hours and hours of fun and excitement it has great play value even for a set in this size	positive
very nice review this is another set which i had never seen before when i am in my dark age quite an useful set especially with the accessories and the minifigs torsos the speedboat is able to hold the car and the rubber rescue boat how can the driver steer this boat with so many things blocking the way i cant seemed to find its control though thanks for doing this review	neutral
nice review i always wanted this set the speed boat makes the set thanks for sharing	neutral
nice review i agree with thok it’s quite similar to the more recent crossbow attack though this one has the added benefit of two shields this set would i fleet be more useful to army builders than most of the modern castle sets even though many people don’t like frightknights	neutral

originally shared in the history  adventure forum for its adventure attributes heres my favorite of the outback collection first let me say that this little set is one of my alltime favorites because it can be used to sumplement a number of different themes 1 the set makes a great little adventure airstrip for adventurers and more recent the indiana jones theme see also german headquarters and port adventure ive also used the set as an addition to my wild west town the tan baseplate and windmill works great just subtract the plane modern equipment and figs and lastly as the set was intended as an outbackdesert airstrip set description outback airstrip set  6444 pieces 157 minifigs 3 release date 1997 original price 20 usd starting with the box and the backside notice the alternate models i love the swamp boat the building is my favorite part of the set it is simple has a little detail two great roof pieces and a single green window great piece check out the great windmill piece its my only one and makes a great part for wild west and that farm you always wanted to build i used it for the barnhouse of barnabas higgens and spring valley ranch on the side of the building is a great radio and a clear glass unfortunately no furniture can be found within the building and now the airplane front view i love the twin propellors side view and the rear section the back has a small cargo hold for some boxesfreight or some gear needed in the outback the set includes three figs two with cool shades and some great equipment i love the boom box a shot of the whole set and another summary as i mentioned above this set is very versatile and can suplement a few different themes its my personal favorite of the outback collection and im really glad i was able to find the set in the late 90s i almost didnt buy sets like this are timeless and so much fun to build and display hope you enjoy the review edit additional reviews review by agentrick57 december 24 2007 outback airstrip review in history  adventure forum february 10 2008	positive
great review this set has cool features i just wish that lego would release this as a lego legend and release it to australia too since this is a set about australia i wouldve bought two if this were a lego legend that is how good it is i like the building with latticed window and windmill i also like the cargo airplane windsock and radios plus it looks like its got great minifigs	positive
whats wrong with another yoda and some nice light blue bricks i probably would destroy this set and keep the minifigs intack tough chrome lightsabers on	neutral
thanks for the review kimt oldies reviewsold sets  are always appreciated i feel this set isnt that great 1 yoda he is by far the best part of the set although is his weapon blue 2lord tyrannus pretty nice i feel the middle part of his torso is a bit bland but that isnt a problem i wish they would make a fleshie one too 3 speeder bike i always hated this design the back looks terrible to me way too bulky in my opinion it jusnt give me the image that its the same as the movie the lightsaber is amazing why is it only in this set 4yodalifter what that is terrible but at least it has some nicely colored parts a fine set but not the best imo	negative
nice review i realy like this set two nice minifigs in an affordable set and i do like the speeder but that lift thing is strange but now at least i know what it is thanks for letting me know	positive
thanks for the nice review kimt  i like this set especially by the fact that it is the only set containing the dooku minifig and the curved lightsaber  i also think that the minifig is cool but i also own the dagobah xwing and the wookiee catamaran sets so i have enought minifigs a clone wars version would be very cool  and the extrathingy is well just ok the bad part is that i dont buy the set when it is out and now is go for 40 on ebay and bricklink  edited by darkrebellion 18 august 2008  0951 pm	neutral
i think this is a pretty lame set it came with dooku who i think only came in this set plus a unique lightsaber still they could have made it much bigger added anikan and obiwan and added structures and made it more like the scene from the movie also the speeder doesnt seem very accurate	negative
i wonder how expensive this set would be on ebay shop victoriously	neutral
i got this set a long time ago the review pretty much says all there is to say about it never knew what the redbrown thing was anyway i used it as a canon isnt this also the only set up until now that had count dooku in it	neutral

thank you for that very interesting review metalandi a cool set with a lot of features and some nifty vehicles very playable and well designed indeed perhaps a bit too colorful for my likings but pretty impressive in its conception for sure i wish we could see some more landscaping coming along with todays vehicle sets as well	positive
this was the first rock raiders set i got i really like it and i think i got all of them except the huge cargo airlift thing i remember these sets coming out and getting the big base for christmas though they are all destroyed now sadly  nice review	positive
i have never seen this set before but the minifig head would be perfect for a solid snake from mgs 2	positive
rock raiders was the shit back in the day awesome theme i had this set as well as the tunnel transporter which was amazing	positive
i always thought that this set was underrated it contains a really interesting collection of parts a decent fig and introduces an odd theme in only one set very well designed for one of the not greats god bless nathan	positive
got this one as well not much surprises in such a small set but the fastfood pizza idea is pretty cool as far as i know only the small mcdonalds promo and this set are related to foodrestaurant thing until the cafe corner that is but since i have a classic lego city i cant miss this set	neutral
this set looks really cool especially for one this inexpensive the van is neat and the hidden storage compartment i back is the icing on the cake i like the back with hidden oven as well and the rare sink piece makes it all the better with five pizzas and three minifigs its and excellent set to behold	positive
excellent review white fang  and a great set to commemorate the establishment of classic townnet i almost ordered this set back when it was rereleased by lego but passed on it im so mad at myself this has all the terrific qualities that classic town sets exemplify i love the delivery truck and the pizza oven a great review from one of the master eb reviewers  outstanding	positive

this set is great and so is this review i really like seeing reviews of classic sets like this and hope to see more in the future the chef in this set is the base for my sigfig in fact the classic sets have a totally different feel to them than the newer sets they look more human great review	positive
i remember having this set when it was originally released a good few years back but i dont think i have it anymore i remember i thought it was really awesome though i thought the oven and pizza storage in the back of the car were the greatest parts the little sink on the inside was cool too didnt realise they had made a legends set out of it id love to own this set again but misb examples on bricklink go for an extortionate amount of money ah well se la vie	positive
i used to want this set so badly and i almost got it when it was rereleased i still wonder why i didnt because with a building van 5 pizzas and a then very rare female fig this set would have been perfect for someone with a smaller collection like i had then what surprised me the most is how well this set still holds up to others today off to bricklink	positive

right so heres my review finally the whole gallery of box parts minifigs and finished model is here over 2 pages so on with the show minifigs httpwwwbrickshelycgii1340864 in the set you get krakaroff i dunno how to spell it and victor krum the figs are exactly the same bar their heads these are two fantastic figures the expression on krakaroffs face is priceless judging by the design i think we might get a yellow krakaroff cropping up somewhere which would make me a happy bunny hed make a fantastic viking ideally id have liked more than 2 figures for my money three would have done it i think 2 is too few piece count httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344573 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344571 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344572 for a 40 set the piece count is quiet good i dont know the exact number but when building it i didnt feel short changed bar the exception of the hull now i dont hate the hull my problem is that is doesnt connect with bricks like the old pirate ships there are pros and cons to this on the plus side its more secure and your whole ship doesnt need to be taken up with support structure the negative side being you cant really make it bigger as theyve only released a megablocking 4 set with the right piece and its the wrong color i also like how its wide meaning you can fit loads of minifigs on the main deck overall though i liked the pieces of note are gold studs httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344510 5 in total you get one spare the return of the black falcon shields httpwwwbrickshelycgii1340835 and the new drumstrang shields the construction a simple fun build nothing too fiddly the finished model httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344474 big picture i really like this set theres no bones about it it seems lego with the latter half of 2005 have given people who loved their original pirate ships hope for the future with this and the fantastic viking longboat even with the two 4 pieces the hull and front of the ship i wasnt put off httpwwwbrickshelycgii1340841 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344461 the front of the ship is a nice piece and can be used for stuff like castles httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344490 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344491 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344492 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344494 and the hull isnt all bad what i really liked was the little cargo hold at the moment i have a treasure chest in there but there space for about eight of them i reckon playability wise it does make alot of sense and as you can see you can imprision minifigs below deck httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344484 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344488 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344506 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344500 the quarters are great as well you can comfortably fit about six minifigs in the main gally three by the steering wheel and a couple up above the top cabin you could fit more but itd look strange my only gripe is the design of the top cabin when you want to open it up you have to remove the mast i know its simple enough but i think that it wouldnt have taken much for tlc to design it better but saying that its easily done and i like how the cabin can be lifted with ease from the steering deck httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344540 the final play feature is the plank you can while away the hours murdering hapless minifigs whove displeased the cabin a really nice addition for pirate fans the final verdictb playability 9510  lots to do for all the kids piece count 910 a great selection loses one for the hull figures 810  just needs one more construction 910  nice and simple value 8510  let down a bit by lack of minifigs and the cons of the hull boverall 8810 overall this is a set worth getting especially if you miss proper pirates it wouldnt take much to turn this into an amazing pirate ship moc hope you liked my review matt	positive

today i shall be reviewing 8290 mini forklift which i recieved when i went to tru to get a technic set so enjoy set name mini forklift number 8290 theme technic parts 89 price 1099 1box the box for this set is suprisingly small its about the size of a 399 set it shows the main forklift and the set information the back of the box features the dragster a very cool model and the suspension works perfectly 2contents we have two instruction booklets one for the forklift and one for the dragster the bags here are a few interesting pieces the long double pin in blue a bionicle connecter joint and a yellow l joint 3build we start off build nice and solid with your average technic build the following steps build up the detail of the bottom part next comes the cab its pretty simple yet effective after that comes the forks they work very well but if you have the palatte on them and you let go it might topple off hint put the edge of the palatte on the small lip on the pieces that connect to the forks this will hold it on better the finished product and palatte extra pieceskeep them as they are used to build the alternate model here is something that i found how to put a minifigure into the cab first remove the side doors then set the fig into the cab with his arm sticking slightly out the gap and finaly seal off the cab a nice way to put system into technic for your towns  parts 910loving them all price per part ratio 810somewhat pleaseing playability 910 works in any system town and has a great dragster alternate model overall 2630 86 b overall i would definatly recommend this set to anyone whether you are a system or technic fan this is perfect it has great parts and is pretty cheap the alternate model is also very good i hope you all enjoyed my review i have made the pictures the requested size on my camera i look forward to hearing your comments edited by vbbn 27 august 2008  0702 pm	positive

pedro on aug 27 2008 0923 pm said great review the ywing is an awesome starfighter and the detail in this set is superb funnily enough i was just swooshing mine today you mean swooshing as in swooshing for real or just plain swooshing	positive
stauder on aug 27 2008 0845 pm said he doesnt know the story but those pics of you swooshing it naked sure are halarious the one in the park is extra good you should see peoples faces i mean they are jelaous of your ywing yoda has my email p hehe staudie haha i was making a joke and here comes stauder with his clearly insane lies for the truth go here now can we get back on topic or a you just dying to become sarlac food	negative
ive built the ywing and the imperial landing craft 7659 more or less at the same time and for about the same prices i think the imperial landing craft ilc is much superior to the ywing the ywing doesn’t have much functionality besides an awkward dropping bomb device and a moving cannon the missiles firing system is … your fingers the ilc has an awesome missiles firing system i wish i could get it individually for mocs a clever bomb dropping mechanism 5 minifigures with weapons the wings fold up together and the “cargo” can be detached as a play set i’ve built the ilc first so i got quite disappointed with the ywing	neutral

is it worth the money since the new ywing comes out next year	neutral
yodalikespie on 03 september 2011  0721 pm said is it worth the money since the new ywing comes out next year please check the date prior to asking questions in old topics three years ago in this case its rude to expect people to answer questions like that especially since its such a generic question besides how is he supposed to answer the question without knowing a lot more about the new ywing	neutral
etav8r on 19 september 2011  0316 am said is that a threat is it fair to ban someone on the forum because they revived an old thread and made inquiries thought this was a forum to discuss lego and that is what he was prompting i dont really care why he was banned but this isnt the only time ive seen this type of behavior and discourse here on eb not a threat at all  i was simply pointing out that yodalikespie made the mistake of inquiring about the new ywing before we had any information on it to my understanding its not so much the fact that he bumped the thread as the fact that he bumped it for no good reason im not certain where the moderators stand on this issue but i feel that yodalikespies question would have been better received had he posed it after a substantial amount of information had been gathered on 9495  as ive said there simply isnt much one can go off of at this point to determine its value relative to 7658	negative
maybe the thread should be locked or taken down since the pics consist of broken links kind of a pointless review without the pics and for the record there are other websites with preliminary images of some the new 2012 sets that are not on the eurobrick star wars 2012 rumors thread perhaps that banned fellow was hoping some of the lego insiders had some knowledge about it i guess well never know now edited by sharky 22 september 2011  0922 pm	negative
and lo it came from the east denmark the set which had been foretold the cheap army builder and there was much rejoicing amongst the castle fans the cardinal then asked was all the rejoicing justified… set name the knight set number 5615 number of pieces 21 figures1 released 2008 list price £200 lets us begin with the box the front shows us are knight and his rack of arms the back shows us two sets from the castle range moving inside the box now the contents of the box it doesn’t look like much the instructions to help you through the build now the reason you probably bought the set well at least why i did the knight this features the new torso for 2008 and is the height of fashion this brings the number of printed torsos from the crown knights to three which allows for a greater variety in building your armies a new fashion sensation and all the must have accessories for this season with a more heavily armoured look he’s ready for anything the rest of the set is a weapons rack i assume that once you’ve got a few of these set you’ll probably like me give up building them and part them out but anyway here are some pictures of what the rest of the elements are spent on a long and complex build begins after 360 hour finally it’s finished sadly five minfigs were hurt in the construction of this rack now the money shot where we can see it all come together it looks great even the rack doesn’t look to bad sadly are hero wasn’t ready for other themes just yet in total we have a good army builder which castle fans have wanted however there remains a question in my mind as to if this set is good enough on it’s own without any other castle sets i can’t see it being to much fun so it’s not a good present the rating system figures 910 great new fashion for this season  parts 810 shield sword spear helmet and armour what more could i want well two shields fun fun fun 310 sadly it’s rather dull on it’s own i can’t think or to much else to do design 710 yes it’s the army builder i’ve wanted design well apart from that pirate one price 910 at £200 what more can i say grand total 3650 let down by being to small to stand alone conclusion so let’s answer the question is it the army all castle fans have wanted well yes and no is the answer while it is a great set and at the now reduced uk price of £200 amazing value i still think it’s inferior compared with the army building capability of cross bow attack i much prefer army building both factions at once	positive
do we really need more construction works legoland is just one huge building site theme city set name mini digger set number 7246 number of pieces 36 figures1 released 2005 list price 350 usd 7426 peeroncom 7246 bricklink catalog diving right in let get some photos of the box the digger at work the back just has more of the same not to inspiring once we open the box we find two poly bags and some instructions the total contents of the box well minus the air instruction booklet short and simple now the single minfig of the set nothing new of special that i can see …got a job working construction for the johnstown company moving onto the digger itself it’s one of those builds where all you really need is a quick glance at the instructions and off you go side view of the finished product alternative view it doesn’t look to bad now lets add our construction worker looks rather good though the lifting action isn’t smooth it’s nothing special it’s not the greatest construction set that lego have ever produced but i think it is worth the money the arm action really does bug me though the rating system figures 510 just another construction peon parts 410 nothing novel and i dislike the new digger arm system fun fun fun 710 i think the playability is high and you can get a good load of bricks in the bucket design 610 not the best designed digger but not the worst price 710 a reasonable price for what you get grand total 2950 still halfway decent but nothing to write home about conclusion this set is yet another in a long line of lego digger and to be honest it’s not the best in my opinion i still hold nostalgic memories for 6504 which i still think is a great digger from my point of view the set sits to high off the ground and make me wonder how the worker gets in i really don’t like the digging arm action it will never be smooth and while it poses better i just think it’s inferior despite this i still think it’s not a bad set i’d just like it to be so much more	negative
cardinal brick on aug 27 2008 1002 pm said …got a job working construction for the johnstown company one of the greatest songs ever written but now onto the review i really like your pictures the quality and lighting is amazing i never gave this set much attention but now it looks pretty good to me also cant wait for your next review i have never seen this bus before	positive
finaly we get a new mech for takeshi and yes its yellow it brings back some flashbacks of supernova good times anyways i recieved this set at christmas last year with 3 other ef sets set name assault tiger number 8113 pieces 163 theme exoforce year released 2008 price 1500 usd 1895 eur 1box the boxes this year are much different than those from previous years it has some gaps in it and has a cardboard backround inside of it the box itself shows assault tiger and the set information the back shows a combiner the cardboard backdrop a very nice jungle look to it it has lots of fog as well creating a pale effect 2contents the instructions the instructions are clear and straightforward also included is a lego blooper the remains of the sticker sheet the stickers arent too bad i didnt apply the saw sticker as i wanted it to be left plain the buzzsaw a very cool piece mocists will love this 3build the figures the figures included are takeshi who features a nice new torso also included is the mini robot his is a very neat little guy but sadly he doesnt really become a weapon more of a block of red and black bricks the torso now the torso design for assault tiger is very different from the past years it now uses a castlelike piece as the main structure also of note is that he has a mini throne no controls sadly and with the orange cockpit piece its impossible to see takeshi when looking at the at close on see the third pic the legs the legs are slightly similar to the mt201 ultra drill walkers but have been modified to fit the at they are quite large and suit their purpose the arms the arms follow a new design but the only problem is they have no elbow or hand articulation nice weapons though the finished product  parts 1010 lots of useful pieces great colors and some very cool new pieces minifigs 810 a robot would have been nice and a better weapon mode for the minirobot would have been good price per part 710 a stretch playability 810 the lack of elbow and wrist articulation isnt the greatest overall 3340 825 b assault tiger is a nice set but some of those small little things can truly take a toll on the final rating i think that i would only recommend this set to anyone who wants the yellow and hardcore exoforce fans sh link peeron link i hope you enjoyed the review and if you have any pic requests or questions please ask edited by sinner 01 september 2008  0152 am	positive
thanks for the review vbbn i have to say ef has never really caught my attention but this set seems alright to be honest when i saw the topic title i was expecting a tiger looking mech the mech itself is cool except for the huge leg pieces i think the minifigs are great in ef sets with the dark colored outfits like dark red or dark green	positive

this here was a set that i new i had to get a beautiful minfig amazing minfigs what more could you want so was this set worth it i guess you will just have to read the review to find out set name the batcycle harley quinns hammer truck number 7886 pieces 267 theme batman year 2008 price 3500 usd 4496 euro 1box the new box art for batman is pretty stunning its clean and really sells the set for this set harley quinns truck is pictured attacking batman with the set information the back of the box shows a nice little comic the other sets as well as the set functions 2contents the instructions the instructions for the set are as always clear and straightforward they display the colors well and have what we expect in an instruction book 3build minifigs the stars of the set batman is back with a new torso much more metalic than before harley had all new printed torso legs a new head and that sweet new hat batcycle the bottom part is very sturdy thanks to a small bit of technic the red throws it off a bit but it isnt seen once the top part is put on it has a nice use of the smoke stacks and looks very nice in the end the top part is simple but suits the purpose well it has handle bars and a nice motor the blue is a little strange though hammer truck the hammer truck begins with a very sturdy base it has lots of detail and really looks cool rims added lego did a very nice job at giving it a checker board appearence the only problem here is that you stick a sticker over two bricks multiple times jewels inside of the crate are these shining jewels look how they illuminate the darkness in gotham more added then we add on a spoiler and the crate looking very nice now the detail is again outstanding and it has a good amount of smoothness to it the infamous hammer okay i havent said this yet but the square pieces need to stop first on those sw backta tanks now on the hammer it creates a sloppy look for the hammer still this is the ultimate wacking weapon added to the truck on the truck it works pretty well but the handle is to short and its near impossible to smash batman the finished truck the finished truck is really nice the big wheels give it the monster truck feel and the way that lego alternated the colors works well the cockpit is a little palin but thats not a major issue the i love joker sticker is one of the best stickers ive seen its simply a classic the finished set  parts 910 lots of good mocing pieces and red and black are always usefull minifigs 1010 awesome playability 910 the hammer is a little short priceperpart 810 its a liscensed theme so meh set 7886 is a very nice set and has some great details in it the minifigs are very cool as well however their are some flaws first the hammer is two short and is kind of square the batcycle has a few awkward colors in it which throws it off a bit this set is definatly worth the money batman fans will love it and also wacking fans will like it for that hammer and if you would like to buy this set here are a few useful links sh link peeron link please let me know your comments and pic requests and questions are welcome	positive

i discovered this review a month ago and since that point in time i could not get the image of the sparkling golden chest out of my mind i finally just purchased the chest for myself i suppose this is a testament to how well honed your picture taking skills are this set is definitely a nice one im not a lego indy collector but i was tempted to purchase this set several times the vehicles are very nicely detailed and have some cool building techniques such as the wheel guards	positive
this set is nice it looks like a dhl van	positive
legoman132 on aug 29 2008 0635 am said this set is nice it looks like a dhl van makes you wonder if there was some kind of promo or hookup in the pipeline that never happened i have this set and i really like it it works well with either the new city sets or with my older 1980s1990s sets i actually like the use of the old style car base and mourned the day that these became exitinct the first time round c1990 thanks for the review cheers rog	positive
its an ok set i just dont really like the look of the van much too rounded for my liking what happened to the box like cars	negative
i do like the set also ive bought 2 of them one to build it up and one to keep it misb i dunno for how long  only poor things is that the wheels are too wide car is 5nops wide instead of 4 afterall a good design i wonder if theres a post office coming soon by the way great review	positive
rriggs on aug 31 2008 0255 am said i actually like the use of the old style car base and mourned the day that these became exitinct the first time round c1990 i dont hate the piece but i did object to the way this set fills in the middle recessed area with a 2 x 2 plate that is nearly impossible to get out again without doing some damage to it whats more if you fill in the recessed area youve eliminated the only rationale for using the car base in the first place	negative

technic rotation joint disc set list its used in 10 different sets so far not exactly a new piece a nice review with many good comments i really like this set its one of the walkers with really good design and a lot of playability its the usual issue of using too many technic pieces to make a moveable feature versus minifigscaled design the same issue concerns for example the atat the twilight and the atte plus more sets what annoys me in this set is the use of the 2 tan 4x8 plates they stick out and it would have been better if they the designers had used dark grey or light grey plates also ill add this to the inventory  now	positive
i like this set but i dont like the pure white legs for the shock troopers it looked better with the black leg joint piece i also think the set looks like half an atte	negative

alakazam the good wizard is the wisest minifig in all of legoland he is a master of the wand and can see the future with these abilities he helps the knights predict where the trolls will strike next because this set is not in stores in the us i was luckily able to buy this set on my vacation to germany it is interesting that it is a euro exclusive 5614 the good wizard set info set name 5614 the good wizard theme castle released 2008 price eur 295gbp 199 pieces 16 minifigs 1 the review unfortunately i dont have the box because in got smushed in my suitcase on the plane so needless to say it was not in top condition the manual the manual is an extremely small foldout but the image on the front is nice on the back of the manual there is a picture of some of the 2008 impulse sets this is a nice feature the parts for an impulse set this has a pretty good selection a very nice owl and an interesting clear ball piece all built this set took me forever to build i had to take numerous breaks as it was the toughest longest build i have ever faced for an impulse set this actually looks pretty good the owl perch is nice also the crystal ball table the wizard is a very nice fig with great printing on the legs and hat and i love his beard brickshelf gallery the ratings price 810 not bad but i feel that impulse sets are slightly overpriced parts 710 impulse sets are focused around the minifig but the parts in this set are pretty good design 710 the crystal ball is a good idea and the owl perch is simple but nice playability 610 there is not much to play with here build 810 as i said before it took forever really it took all of 1 minute minifig 1010 the wizard is fantastic overall 4660 bricklink lego sh brickset abracadabra blades of four you are now a dinosaur summary for an impulse set this is very nice the wizard is an excellent fig and getting an animal in a cheap set is always great i would definitely recommend this set thanks and happy building	neutral
good review for a simple set while it does come with the basics for an impulse set i just feel that it lacks something though i am not sure what perhaps a printed magic scroll i am still not a fan of the printed cap especially the stars but i do like the printed pants displaying his various goodies hanging from his belt the plain torso is to be expected from a wizard minifig i suppose overall its not a bad set but it certainly feels to be lacking something imo	neutral
worst set of the year worst set of all time the pictures say it all no ratings necessary a waste of paper for box and instructions and waste of plastic for bag and jelly alien the little alien ship that comes with the switch fighter beats this one hands down as well as any other lego spaceship i have ever seen and i have seen many thankfully this set isnt available in my country which is something i never thought i would say anyway i hope tlg makes these awful jelly aliens disappear forever after this year	negative
to be honest i am going to give this set a 1 that is my lowest rating i will ever give to a set in eurobricks in fact this is the only impulse set which i do not have it at all after looking at your wonderful review i am going to give it a 2 and actually consider it to buy at least one to complete the entire impulse set series i dont really like the design and the alien at all in fact i prefer the mars mission astronaunt more than the aliens i dont really like the set but i like your review	negative
impluse sets are made good by using parts well and minifigs this has either i give a low score i really dislike the alien figs worst lego fig ever	negative
sets we miss include minfig sets like this one€ theme space set name space minifigs set number 6703 number of pieces 30 figures 6 released 1988 list price  unknown 6703 peeroncom 6703 bricklink catalog lets begin by admiring the outside of the box wow 6 figs and all equipped i was four more of these we don€™t get instructions so the back show how to put the figs together now for the men themselves the complete line up of all six figs it seems strange half are in black a closer look at our four futrons a look at the blacktrons looking like nice guys with their visors raised time for a closer look at the range of tool these good men received from the lego company yep one accessory per person the question is what could you do with this set i mean it€™s just spacemen in a line do you see the man who mugged you ma€™am a good set from an age when we could look forward to every few years a new set of minfigs and just a box of them the rating system figures 1010 an excellent selection for the time parts 410 good accessories but nothing else fun fun fun 710 i can see lots of opportunity for fun with this set design 810 well it€™s not really designed much but it€™s a great idea price 10 unknown at this time though mine was from woolworths grand total 2940 a good mark for a great set conclusion until the castle battle packs came out this year we€™ve been suffering from a lack of minfig based sets and from this review i think you can see why for many of us and i include myself here lego minifig are one of the best parts of the hobby and sets like these allowed you to build up a much larger number of figs lego did well with this set a nice range of figure and also a good selection of accessor	positive
you you got it mint in sealed box it indeed is a nice set i am not into space but nevertheless this set is a good addition if you need to get your space environment a little bit more crowded lego however is planning to release a minifig set again next year city and of course the advent calendars are also quite nice to get some figs with accessories	positive
nice set lucky you the only reason i buy the mm impulse sets is lack of good space minifig packs like this nowadays 	positive
jimbutcher on aug 30 2008 1025 pm said oh yes i will add the other prices and i was going to make a poll for it i made one for the homing spider review but you beat me to it thanks thats my job im a moderator	negative
thanks for the review is a great one this set is not really a good set but i like the spider droid the hailfire droid scale is not right i think it is suppose to be even bigger anyway this is the first set that rerelease the commander droid so i grab it	negative
7681 homing spider droid limited edition number of pieces 206 number of minifigs 5 price 3499 usd 2999 eur 1999 gbp theme star wars episode ii year released 2008 brickset folder bricklink catalog welcome to my sixth review on these boards of the mighty homing spider droid at first glance this ball on legs may not seem like much but hopefully this review will change your mind the box this box is the standard for all of the new clone wars sets sleek shiny and a rightoutofthefactory look the blueandwhite color scheme is fantastic and portrays that the sets are based off of a cartoon well this box has a limited edition in spanish too  seal slapped on the front although you wont have trouble finding this in your local toys r us because of the big clone wars display in the front of the store that you cant miss overview in this picture you can see the contents of the whole set minus the instruction booklet built you can spot five minifigures which ill get to later and a very tall cis weapon known as the homing spider droid this weapon of destruction is a musthave for your cis army although the color scheme mostly dark bley and light bley is a change up from the regular colors brown or blue of the cis this may have something to do with the blended armies of the trade federation and corporate alliance but i dont know for sure the instruction manual is very thin only about twenty pages homing spider droid this is the main part of the set four huge legs two mounted guns and a red sensor eye are the highlights of this artillery unit theres not many playability factors to this one but sometimes its just fun to squash the little clones a changeup of the contrary it also looks good next to all of the other cis sets but you might want to clear some room in your display area the legs take up a lot of room this thing is also massively tall about the same height as the republic cruiser main body this is the main body of the spider which has no cockpit and is remote controlled this spherical body not in that sort of way is a very quick build and features a big red eye connected by a red stud and hinge top gun here is the top gun not with tom cruise which is connected to the body using a clever technic system pun not intended as you can see from this picture you can see that it can rotate a full 360 degrees but only if you remove the eye also the gun can be pulled back and if you let go it will snap back like the a gun does when fired due to the force of the shot im not sure this was intended by tlg because it wasnt showed anywhere on the box or in the manual lower gun here is the gun attached to the under body of the main part it is attached using a hinge which allows it to move up and down i also like the cord that presumably transfers power included on both guns hips here is one of the hips attaching the legs to the body there is one on each side with two legs each the are attached to the body and legs with technic pieces legs you can see the tall legs in this pic they are basically just technic poles and connectors feet this is one of the feet the essential to balancing the whole vehicle these and the legs are repetitive so i suggest doing them all at the same time to avoid flipping back in the manual and repeating the process three more times the picture speaks for itself for the design of the feet all are connected to the legs using a doubleholed technic piece one massive son of a gun this thing is so tall it frightens the skin off of even the toughest most experienced soldiers run for your lives look at how much havoc and fear it causes family photo enough of the battle scenes here is a shot of this spider with its smaller cousin the dwarf spider droid minifigs finally here are the minifigs that come with this set there are five in all which include battle droid nothing special but still an addition to your army commander battle droid i love that yellow torso super battle droid again nothing special clone trooper im glad they gave us one in this set i can add it to to my other phase 1 clones commander fox i love it everything from the dark red markings to the accessories are fantastic the head is just the regular anime style clone wars face this set comes with two flashlights two antennae one visor one pauldron and one kama closeup of fox here is a closeup of fox so you can see the detailed insignia of the republic guard that wraps it up for the review here is the final verdict build 810 very easy and straightforward a little repetitive with the legs should take the seosoned builder around 20 minutes playability 610 not many play factors but its fun to just squash puny clones with this giant arachnid swooshability na minifigs 1010 you really cant ask for more in this sort of set design 810 not very sturdy but it is altogether clever price 510 yes it is limited edition but pumping up the price fifteen dollars more than it should be is a little ridiculous overall score 8510 an excellent set for display although not very sturdy minifigs are superb but the price could be better in the end i would highly recommend this to any prequel trilogy fan looking to build up his her army well thats about it for this review please feel free to leave your opinions edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0309 am	positive

thank you very much for this review thebrickster i voted both times for outstanding because i really the arctic theme i only bought the ice sailor but otherwise no sets because of money and place reasons and because i already collect four themes city older castle western and star wars old triology but a comeback of the arctic theme  perhaps as addition to a winter sports and winter rescue theme would be very welcome i really all sets  the little and the big ones in my opinion they all were very well designed not too big vehicles not too little and not minimalitic great minifigs and very nice and lovely details and accessory klausdieter	positive
thanks very much for this great review thebrickster i love the arctic subtheme but unfortunately i never got my hands on any of the sets since this theme had its time during my dark ages this one is a really neat little set with a great amount of accesoires especially these snow shoes and the backpack which i love	positive
great review i hope tlc does another i rember reading a book once based on the theme which stated the scorpions and thespiders and such were aliens 	positive

thank you very much for this review skipper 24 i voted for outstanding since this set is a little but very lovely set i really it although i dont own it yet  since its very similar to todays impulse sets a minifig and some nice additional stuff and i like the black cat which gives the set a more gloomy atmosphere hopefully tlg will include a black cat and a chimney like in this set in the new advent calendar too klausdieter	positive
you already know how i feel about the review as for the set im not entirely sure its a fine witch but youve already gotten her in the witchs windship and a few other sets i vote average on this a good minifig though one does not have the need for more than one witch and some fine additional parts	neutral

very good review i enjoyed reading this i want to buy these battlepacks until now my country has not restocked these battlepacks i wonder will they ever arrived again i want to build massive armies with this outstanding battlepack set hope it will arrived soon	positive
i love this battlepack i bought two last time i went to legoland california and it certainly gave the knights a good variety of new troops however i have one complaint and that is the guy with the lance i am wondering why he has a lance while fighting on foot if tlg really wanted to give him a lance they should have given him a horse	positive
imperialshadows on sep 2 2008 0846 am said  with that lovely new barding nobody would complain about the price then even if it was 15 i sure wouldnt especially if it was the silver chainmail barding	neutral
the cobra on sep 2 2008 1133 am said  why are the figures already built are todays kids so dumb lets go back to those old minifig packs probably to reduce the sizecomplexity of the package thus saving tlc money i dont see it being a big deal as customization is always an option concerning the set not much to say other than it does what its suppose to do build up ones army of knights the variance of faces and accessories are great i especially love the chrome sword the price isnt bad either since the package comes with five nice figs and some great equipment edited by dj2005 03 september 2008  0646 am	neutral
i was going to get this but when i rang up sh apparently theyd sold out already price is a little on the steep side as well and i can only see it going up on sites such as amazon as the number of people wanting them goes up which it will it its anything based on the star wars battle packs	neutral
after reading your review i might buy me one of these at first i thought it was quite useless but i must admit that your review kinda changes my mind on this bp ive added it to the index	neutral
dear all i found this to be a very usefull army building set at 2 euro per minifig it is relatively cheap in my book so i bought 4 battle packs recently although it could be difficult to integrate all of them in your army personally i reshuffled some of the weapons as to integrate them better but that is a personal preference ofcourse kind regards teddy	neutral

i really love these impulse sets at a low price point for lots of minifigs this police one doesnt appeal too much to me at the moment but who knows with your reference i may need it with a future project hmm its actually a good way of getting those dogs cheaply	positive
i also love the impulse sets but we have already too many policemen although i actually bought this one our bobby isnt looking very nice is he we normally but policemen in a pool or sea with sharks at events like legoworld so maybe thats because of me edited by jopiek 02 september 2008  1100 pm	neutral
i bought this set for 214€ yesterday and i have to admit that for that price im veerryy satisfied  i bought it especially for the dog my first one and for the road sign during the construction short of the set i was wondering something does the speed limit has a signification in every country or some variant exists in my country france the speed limit in town is 50 kmh so i understand the road sign in this set but in other country and especially the country were the speed limit is not in kmh does this set had another road sign	positive
nice review  i still thing sets like this are the reason castle has done so well it allows you to collect a large number of minfig for not very much cash which i certainly indulged in my only complaint is that you end up with the evil skeletons out numbered however heard of the good guys winning with the numbers in their favour	neutral

nice review it seems that you really covered all aspects of this fantastic set my favorite part about it is probably the fact that you can give almost every included minifig a mount except for one poor knight  however another part i like is that the horse includes a plain saddle which is a nice relief after the overabundance of the goldplate barding which is nice but overused in the early sets also the sw jokes are hilarious i particularly the running gag with the walker but i like this one too reason for edit i made a mistake due to a loss of internet and an accidental post edited by francis marion 03 september 2008  0332 am	positive
well indeed looks like a very nice set especially the scared knights are very nice 	positive
one of the best sets from the new castle theme we havent seen a carriage in a long long time and it looks so spooky and sceary lots of minifigs new skeleton horses 3 this was the first set i got from the new castle theme outstanding	positive
that’s a nice review though i do feel the price was a little high but as you said you get so much in it last year argos in the uk reduced it to £799 which was a true bargain and sent me all over london looking for a store with more in stock again as with all the lego castle sets i think what makes it work so well is that lego are now providing a much larger number of minfigs and that’s often what makes a set	neutral
this was my first set from the new line so im rather partial to it im glad to see it get such high praise its quite the lovely little halloweeny set i wonder if thebrickster could modify this for his ww grave stone mocs hint hint hintedy hint hint  edited by pirates forever 13 june 2009  0202 am	neutral

thanks for the great review this is one of my favorite city kits from 2007 i think its a lot better than the cement mixer from the classic town theme  and it has some cool pieces too	positive

7040 dwarves mine defender theme castle released 2008 price 10 usd pieces 73 3 minifigures introduction here i am with one of the newest castle sets realeased in early 2008 its a small battle wagon with blades on the front probably to demolish rocks in mines but in this case our hero dwarf has to use his machine against the evil trolls who want to destroy his happy kingdom there is only one small booklet for instructions no alternate model parts come in two bags one for small pieces and one for bigger ones apart from the lovely figures the brown parts will be quite useful for any castle builder extra parts are not even worth mentioning there are no stickers figures are detailed enough dwarf is lovely with his beard but his legs wont move because he is short figures are the main attraction for adult players we havent seen castle army builder sets for a long while and this is closest weve got in recent years the dwarf is a little taller than it should have been but its not possible to do so without creating a completely new mould for figures and that would be expensive its beard is oversized as well but that gives him a legoish look which i like a lot the trolls  thats what everybody calls them but i say they are orcs  are obviously evil but they are friendly enough not to scare our munchkins but i wish they had different torsos or at least different faces like crownies there are not enough weapons to arm everyone but the flag pole is really nice unlike the star wars army builders this set has very little weaponry only one sword and one pike creates scarcity for 3 figures  star wars sets had 4 figures for same price so i hope our middle age warriors dont come across any stormtroopers  building in progress when you pull the chain the catapult fires a round brick the set has quite good playability moving blades and firing catapult should be fun for little children i wouldnt expect more functions for such a small sized model it hardly covers my hand the blades move with the front wheel on the right there is only one little downside there is too much friction for the wheel and blades wont move synchronized you may come over this problem by adjusting the blade height and lining them with the wheels mow the little buggers you can adjust the blade height there isnt enough room for the dwarf folder when public httpwwwbrickshelrycgif338578 rating figures 810 dwarf is amazing trolls are great too but i wish they had different faces parts 710 brown slopes are new rest is ok too price 710 acceptable but we have seen sets with more figures for less design 610 it looks kind of steampunkish but could be better with a little detail building 610 not repeating itself still nothing exciting total 3450 castle fans will definetely order this one but average lego player may not be interested conclusion overall its a nice set and id recommend it if you like the castle theme youll find some good use for the figures and this is the cheapest figure set of the year  at 333 usd each it could have more armory and weaponry but otherwise its quite alright skip lunch today and order this little set links brickset reviews bricklink entry peeron inventory	positive
lovely review really but the sad fact is weve seen it before twice httpwwweurobrickshowtopic20293	positive
nice review i just recently purchased it for our future son and had to break into to it to get a first hand account of the merchandise i am not that big into the castle themebeing a citytown person myself but i must say that this set is awsome	positive
this set pulled me out of my dark ages thanks lego	positive
indexed going through the boards i was amazed to find out that no one ever attempted to review one of the best lego classics the 6399 airport shuttle while i was studying for exams a few weeks back i decided to take a break built the monorail and take some pictures of it resulting in the present review along with this i made my first ever poll here we go first some data setnumber 6399 setname airport shuttle released in 1990 in holland though bricklink says 1991 number of parts 731 number of figs 9 price unknown prices on bricklink vary from 261 up to 2300  but this was an expensive set even in the nineties the box mine is a bit battered by the owner before me but theres still plenty to see this is one of the largest boxes i have look at the minifig in the downright corner for the comparision and it is a really neat storing facility for many sets the box shows the set and in the background the silhouet of the set that is to accompany this one the airport from 1990 i like the angle of the box showing the two stations track and train in one picture the back of the box shows some really nice ideas for other setups why oh why has lego abandonned this kind of showing whats possible with one set inside flap of the box showing details of the set and the functions detail on the front of the box displaying the dimensions it really is a huge track layout for one set the instructions there is a nice little booklet showing the same picture as the box art with the figures lined up underneath the last page nicely folds out to show the entire setup of the tracks the figures a brilliant selection of minifigs including airport people and a cook all figures that are supposed to go on the shuttle carry a ticket and there are also some suitcases tickets fit inside of course station  1 the set includes two stations here is the first depicting the airport there are lots of details a phonebooth two seats some flowers a map luggagelockers and of course the streetlights a detailed shot of the station showing the luggagelockers and ticketvalidating machine part of the beauty of this set is the fact that it is so extremely detailed just look at the signs to show where to go next stickers and the scenery opposite the street the station has the same shape as the airport shuttle logo how sweet is that the station pictured as part of the layout the stations ends are made with airplane wings to smoothen the arrival of the shuttle station  2 here is the second station my personal favorite an elevated stop with a little snackbar underneath and stairs leading to the platform some chairs and streetlights here as well plus two old fashioned trees the part of the set that can be used in any layout the snackbar with hamburger sign sticker yes those hamburgers look tasty indeed also notice the lights hanging from the platform overhead and the ticketvalidating machine at the bottom of the stairs here we have the platform with information panels and seats also notice the two trafficlights for the train heres how it works the train will travel in the direction the arrow is pointing when turning the knob the two grey blocks will move towards or away from the trackcenter activating a button on the centerpiece of the train the motor which makes the train start its journey around the track there is only one speed and the train can only be put to a stop or change direction at stations the station as part of the layout the shuttle now on with the train there are two carrriages connected to a centered motor the power is provided by means of a batterybox containing a 9v battery the batterybox is in one of the carriages and displays airport shuttle a total of five passengers can be seated inside leaving room for their luggage and two drivers the front carriage with the button for the batterybox showing the underside showing the gearwheel metal that brings the power from the motor onto the geared track the black pointy things alongside the gearwheel react with the direction knobs at stations this is how the shuttle negociates with height differences everything hinges and rotates making the shuttle capable of performing steep climbs the motor is powerful enough to not slow down at such a climb detailed shot showing the first set of covered wheels in hinged position the shuttle on the layout the full layout this layout is quite huge involving lots of track pieces ramps ten large stanchionpoles and the two stations to show the movement of the shuttle i have made a 20 second movie which can be seen in my brickshelf gallery of this set conclusion well to conclude the review some final thoughts this truly is one of the more detailed sets around at least from the nineties and one of the largest in dimensions the monorail system is cleverly thought out and works excellent track extensions are hard to get however and very expensive nowdays especially the switchpoints and long straight track pieces the tracks included with this set will provide you with hours of fun though because there are a lot of them it can be quite hard to incorporate the monorail in your town without having a clearlybasedonthemonorailalone town i tried to incorporate it some years ago link here posing a real challenge the ratings price 810 this is an expensive set if you can get it for under 200 get it this set is rare in any condition parts 1010 lots of rare pieces cool minifigs 9v system roadplates lots of minifigseats en red trainwindows originality 1010 there are very few monorails released this one being the only town set compatibility 810 can be a bit hard to incorporate in a town but hey you got the monorail so no complaining here total 3640 i can only reccommend this set to anyone it is my personal favorite set upto this present time if there are any questions ask them all comments are welcome of course	positive
best set ever i got my copy years ago from a guy on the old rectoyslego newsgroup anybody here still remember that newsgroup i traded him a guarded inn a black falcons fortress and a couple other small castle sets for it no regrets on that trade it is hard to incorporate a monorail into a town especially if you have a bunch of trains too i ended up making my entire monorail system elevated theres just no easy way to make a monorail  road crossing i also gave up on having it run in a loop instead it runs back and forth between two endpoints	positive
yes this is one of the best town sets ever	positive
this remains the definitive city set in my eyes i never managed to get one but from the instructions it seems to be perfect in just about every way i got the two space monorails a while ago but the much higher prices on this one have kept it out my reach this set is a lot bigger than either of those though i always liked the monorail system a bit better than the trains because you could easily incorporate height into the tracks and spread them out in all three dimensions quote edit and bricklink is wrong giving 1991 as the release date youre right it was 1990 it was apparently released in 1990 in europe and 1991 in north america going by some us and german catalogs i have from that time period edited by cp5670 06 september 2008  0606 am	positive
what an amazing set and a truly wonderful review thanks simonwillems for the work you spend on this	positive
good review who voted this below average i own one and managed to pick it up off ebay a few years ago now with the track expansion pack for £150 in very good condition so glad i did an all time classic	positive
judging from videos ive seen it seems that the monorail does very well on slopes i wonder why there havent been more or at least an updated set i also wonder why the trains cant incorporate some slopes like the monorail	negative
this truck is simply beautiful its on my brickset wanted list i love the colour scheme red and yellow are the right choice for this vehicle the back part of the truck can be opened so it can discharge the rubbish like real garbage trucks youve also mentioned that in your review and i find it a wonderful detail thanks for the review jopiek	positive
yeah its very nice along with all the older sets ive got the cement mixer that was released around about the same time as this	positive
6206 tie interceptor number of pieces 212 number of minifigs 1 price 1999 usd 1799 eur theme star wars episode vi year released 2006 brickset folder bricklink catalog welcome to my ninth review the boards todays review is the long awaited tie interceptor but does it live up to expectations well lets find out i believe this is the first and only time tlg made this set so lets begin the review the box the box is standard for its time with silver font the background on the front has some planets and the death star ii clarifying that this set is from episode vi overview this set comes with the interceptor model and one fig the interceptor has a very sleek futuristic design with four wings and a ballshaped cockpit the tie interceptor is a stealthy speedy vehicle in the imperial fleet it is used for scouting missions and not meant for attacking due to its weak structure and low arsenal front this version of the tie group is very attractive and coollooking it has an aerodynamic shape giving it looks and speed while not accurate to the movies grey and black colored ties the blue in place of the grey is just fine and does not alter the coolness of the design thankfully there are no stickers in this set cockpit here you can see the ballshaped cockpit be very very careful when opening it its very flimsy and breaks off almost every time fortunately both the windshield and the dish on top are printed and not stickers please dont mind the dust cockpit interior this is the inside of the cockpit it is very roomy airtight and one of the few cockpits in sw sets that are this good it makes up for lack of detail by giving the pilot plenty of room so you should have no trouble there it is also very smooth in the back and where the windshield folds down this is by far the best sw cockpit i have ever seen done by tlg good job the only bad thing is the two tan bricks that clash with the rest of the color wing attachment this is how the wings are attached to the cockpit on each side unfortunately the design on this part is not so good and sometimes the wings break off plus this part is very blocky and there is a big juniorized piece on the base of the wings wings here is what each wing looks like there are three parts on each wing a middle and two fins the wings are very aerodynamic with a diamondlike design note the imperial insignias and the blue tiles lining the wings wing attachments contd here again you see how the middle wing part is attached to the base juniorized piece and the fins attached to the base by hinges the hinges allow the fins to fold in and out a bit but again this is very fragile and the fins often break off gun placements this is an example of four guns on the ship one on the tip of each fin the guns consist of a tile with a tenic tunnel hole on the bottom attached to a technic pin which is attached to a black bar a good design altogether back here you see the rear of the cockpit you can see why the opening mechanism is so flimsy the whole top and front is connected to the body only by a weak hinge system as seen in the picture also note the small transblue dish and the four transred studs minifigure finally here is the single figure that comes in this set a tie pilot it is an all black figure with a life support system decal on the front and a helmet with silver imperial insignias an overall good minifig with a different helmet mold than the stormtrooper or shadowtrooper well i suppose thats about all lets get to the final verdict build 610 a little difficult due the flimsiness of the ship but should only take the average builder no more than 30 minutes playability 710 its fun to fly around   but has no real functions swooshability 710 you can swoosh it around fairly well just be careful not to accidentally break it minifigs 810 a good fig although having only one leaves something more to be desired design 410 very very flimsy with the wings windshield and fins but good for display price 710 i think it was actually 30 usd when i got it but im not sure overall score 65 an average set very delicate so much that you can hardly pick it up but good for display the minifig is okay and having no stickers is good i would recommend this to a hardcore ot fan that wraps it all up please vote your opinion on this set in the poll and ill see you next review edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0310 am	neutral
the interceptor is my favorite tie ship so i wish i picked it up thanks for the review i agree about the helmet needs some silver printing on the mouth piece and the ends	positive

information name fire control center set no 4953  peeroncom theme lego legoland year 1991 pieces 516 minifigs 4 price usd 8500  gbp unknown  eur unknown bricklink search results brickset lugnet introduction this week i got the flu so since i have to stay home and get better i might as well make a review its one of the most amazing older city sets thus making it a really valuable review this is the story about four handsome firemen living in one of the most amazing city structures out there the 6389 fire control center the box i actually didnt remember the box to be that small borrowed from peeron the four hunky firemen oh jeah what women doesnt like a man in a uniform the manual even the manual is aging but then again its 17 years old review as you all know a city must have some standard civil services like a hospital and a police station a fire house also is a must for any lego city this particular fire house is one of the most amazing sets ever to be released in this cool set you get 4 minifigs all fire fighters two verhicles and a helicopter firefighters have to move around the futuristic fire truck is definately my favourite chiefs car the smallest verhicle of the set its a small allterrain jeep for the fire chief pretty much a standard car in those days a real simple layout and a trunk which holds a small fire hose its lucky to be in this set because it complements the whole thing the car luckily its red and it has de cool signs on the side helicopter another great addition to the whole set is the helicopter again in a basic setup for that kind of verhicle at the time this one has the nice addition of two hoses to put out the fires raging in lego city the chopper no it doesnt really fly really cool fire truck thingy this fire truck is definately the best of the verhicles in this set its actually a futuristic model of fire trucks i havent seen any other fire truck like this i saw a police truck like it though but were talking fire fighters right actually the whole thing han open up to reveal a number of fire fighting appliances such as a hose a computer and a oxygen tank the fire truck click for bigger version the main building actually looks kinda empty when the trucks and chopper are gone however this still is realistic compared to a real fire house also the front has those amazing sliding doors which make this thing really look cool and clean off to fight a fire main structure with the slinding doors pulled down actually those sliding doors are also the hard part of the model since all the bricks must be perfectly aligned or else the doors will stutter but if youre a little familiar with lego then you dont need to worry from the back enough room to play with im going to give my perspectives on each of the sides on the left we have the garage for the bigger fire truck the only real flaw about this set is that this garage isnt long enough for the fire truck this could have been solved by making it two or three studs longer notice the cool sunroof in the middle we have the chiefs office complete with coffee machine a diversity of computers and a tape recorder most likely to tape any incoming calls a lot of details are crammed up in there just like in the rest of the set to the right is the helicopter platform i really like the greyblueyellow of the platform because it doesnt look so red anymore dont get me wrong red is a cool color but not too much red and the helicopter actually fits and stays in place during playtime the baseplate filled up this picture says it all again the four lego hunks are greeting all the ladies the minifigs are from a classic series this happens with more of my lego sets bottom line is that this set is one of the best fire houses lego created verdict the build is pretty easy but takes a while to really see where you are with your building its nice to have a hospital from the same era this create a more uniform look to your city once you completed the model your baseplate is pretty filled up but still has a lot of opportunities playability 1010 cool trucks a chopper and sliding doors nuff said design 910 insanely good design price 1010 couldnt get better than this overall 9610 with a score like that one can only say get one now time to go home the trucks and chopper back on their rightful spots	positive
big supie on sep 7 2008 0846 pm said i think the 6382 fire station is the better one from the 80ies i have 6382 and agree that it is a great set it doesnt have a chopper like this set and the fire engine is not as flash it does have a downstairs in the building though at least a door and a front wall anyway its nice to see a review of this set as its one that i often looked at in the catalogue and thought of getting but never did its great to see the details that i otherwise would not have seen i dont like the firemen with hair though they should have helmets or caps imho thanks for the review cheers rog	positive
this looks like a great set i like the futuristic fire truck that might be what i do with my imperial shuttles glass cockpit	positive
nice classic set are those hoses around the engine pneumatic tubes that technic catalog looks interesting too i have the catalogs for the next several years but not that one quote this is the model at step five the piston is already attached imagine this state on step 5 in modern sets back then lego had challenging instructions not the step madness like today the most extreme example of this was the engine step in the 8865 set which uses over 120 pieces by itself	neutral
a very nice review jopiek you know i was wondering how lego could justify having two 12vpowered passenger trains at the same time but after reading the review and seeing the lack of figures and accessories i guess i understand why plus the train is rather compact oh and i cant help but think that the chairs in the middle carriage are somewhat oddly placed because those placed next to the door are unusable because the door takes up room needed for figs arms also it appears that your set also has the newer couplers ie theres no hooks for the decoupling rail to grab hold of with the light assembly it really wont matter playwise or if you dont have any decouplers but its still a bit of a bummer	positive
giorgio on sep 8 2008 1123 am said the 7745 was realsed in 1985  lego had 2 12v passengers trains between 1981 and 1984 the 7740  7725 during the 80s the avergae life of a train was about 5 years freddie yups now i see what you mean i checked the instructions and indeed the chairs are in the wrong place whoops you are totally right i meant 7740 instead of 7745 fixed it edited by jopiek 08 september 2008  0500 pm	neutral
nice review i got this set not long after my ending of the dark ages it was even then already on slae for just 5 euro i like the figs and the vehicles it were some of my first orange pieces the hippie guy is called  snap lockit and the pizza guy is called  pepper roni i think the legodesigners had a cosy evening with much beer when they thought about the names i think this line was the only line which was made first as computergame and after that as a real line instead of the other computergames based on already existing lines	neutral
her name was sky lane its quite sad though to actually play the gamethe xtreme tower is the only set that made it into the game itself and it was a really watered down version of the information center from the first two games but the island was in the game filled with incredible buildings that would have made really cool sets	negative
thanks for the nice review whitefang i quite like this set the front looks a bit bare but for a small set like this it doesnt really matter this set gets a 4 from me as well	positive
nice review white fang this really reminds me of an allamerican set with its red white and blue colors and the white stars although i really like the fig with its scruffy bearded face i find the green torso a bit odd for this set i suppose i would expect some sort of redblue racer fig with a whiteblue racing helmet swamp sharks  too funny  you always add a nice addition of humor to your reviews now im going to check out some wonder woman clips on youtube	positive
one of my favourite sets me and couple of buddies got this set back then the fig was so cool sun glasses fast boat	positive
yeah the name on this set is strange i think all the boxes say garbage truck i guess its up to each builder to decide whether 1x1 round plates are recyclable material or not its a great model in any case i love these highly detailed city trucks weve been getting during the last year or two i used to have a preference for the late 80searly 90s city line but some of these new sets have really surpassed them in detail and functionality	positive
erdbeereis1 on sep 10 2008 0538 pm said actually it does the back part of the truck with the panel hinges up so that when you want the truck to dump it doesnt get in the way i should have taken a better look at the one my brother has  it still is a nice truck much better than all the strange sets that were release those dark ages before	positive
what a great set and a very nice review erdbeereis i think the only improvement to this set would have been the use of chrome exhaust pipes and front grill i bought this set with a lot of excitement but unfortunately have not put it together yet what are your thoughts on these larger 6stud wide detailed vehicles as opposed to 4stud wide classics heres an image of 6668 recycle truck released in 1992 ps i like the use of taking out sponge bob in your review	positive
this looks like a great set and im happy you were dumping spongebob he deserves that this set looks very nice and if i see it i will probably pick it up	positive
thanks for the review this is one of the few city sets that i own despite loving the theme so much most of my town is either custom or classic and its about as beautiful as a big garbage truck can ever be quote nice truck indeed but the yellow one is better i think at least if you put them on a roadplate it seems to me that those road plates are too small for that also it will not empty completely because of that panel well for the rest it is a nice set and a fine review well the truck barely fits onto the old roadplates not on curves though so if you put it in a display it probably wont look bad i think from what i see this and all the other 6 wide vehicles will fit much better on the newer roadplates which are four studs wider than the old ones	positive
hi i bought this set a while ago and have since remodeled it into a larger 8 wide truck now it can hold a driver and passenger its kind of boxy i may redesign it in the future	neutral
thats a really nice mod badsneaker the added bulk serves it well	positive
it would be cool if someone made a moc in which hippies steal the truck and cover it with flowers and bright colors and stuff	neutral
