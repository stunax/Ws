0 first, what i liked sooooo much was the cover of these plates, with this large picture of a classic space scene. i still have a '306' misb just to keep that nice feeling of taking it out of a plastic box, and look at it... there were different versions of the cover though. second, the markings of the landing platform changed at some point. i'd have to check it later when i'm at home, think it had something to do with the interupted yellow lines...

4 these plates are great in setting up your space base and giving your ships a place to land. my favorite, though, is the lunar crater plate, which i use to death in my comic. :)

0 why pay $350 dollars, just download the instructions on buy the pieces off bricklink. this is was i did when i wanted to create the blacktron ii in the futuron colour scheme. also i tend to like both sets of base plates, i bought the black ones myself and they were of great use but there more for creating the idea of a city or space station, something more completely man made. the gray ones give a better look of the roads being laid over bare rock especially when you introduce the plates with the craters. i would love to see a 48*48 baseplate with roads through them which would allow more building space on the side and maybe some craters. also 48*48 baseplates with craters but a few different kinds to create more or a realistic look and less of a repeating pattern. and with all those rocks you have to put everything up on supports, much better looking bases then.

2 quote oh how i love these plates. afew years ago i found a local retail store with about 6-7 sets of these in their basement warehouse i was given special access to (along with many other old space goodies.. hehe..) i love the things, i have loads, and i've used them for multiple space bases and battles. along with afew grey crater plates and the large grey plates (1.5x the size of a normal baseplate) you can get quite a monorail layout going. *sigh* i should really clean up and get one set up again, so i can take some pictures! wow, nice. you probably have enough to make that scene on the box picture. i got one pack off ebay a while ago and have another octagon plate from the blacktron 6988 base. i'm building my carrier moc around one but don't have anything planned for the others. these baseplates are still relatively common on ebay for their age. i see misb packs on there every few weeks and they tend to sell for around $20. the older kind (in the op) are much harder to come by. edited by cp5670, 09 july 2008 - 10:18 pm.

2 i also love these plates! i build a lot with them (e.g. this ). unfortunately they are not available in bley ...

2 lokix, on jul 11 2008, 03:00 pm, said: by looking at the pictures used to display this set i've a sneaky suspicion it did not come with instructions but meant for the pictures to be ideas. the whole set was suppose to teach children to use their imagination, giving them instructions would somewhat defeat this while trying to figure how to build things from looking at pictures would be a much better educational experience. but i don't wanna use my imagination!

2 thebrickster, on jun 22 2008, 01:41 am, said: it looks like your boat is in really good shape considering it's >30 years old. excellent review! i know; i got it for a song on ebay. most 1970s sets don't seem to be in much demand...

4 this set showed what potential variations on the standard brick had back then. i think that tlg was still finding its legs back then and learning new things so this is a solid set for the year it was released. nice review sinner.

4 snefroe, on aug 7 2008, 07:53 am, said: my parents always needed to keep my quiet during the 3-day trip, and the best way to do that was to buy me a lego set... this still works nowadays. quote i often saw large quantities of lego sets in those gas stations though... i remember seeing yellow castle and... the galaxy explorer, standing on a shelf. these were the times... although i donÂ´t recall lego sets in fuel stations in the past i would appreciate to see lego "on the go" now. itÂ´s holiday time and i have two sons, you know.

4 great review. i never had this set, but it looks nice. i really like the checker pattern near the big window.

2 way before my time, too--in fact, this set came out twenty years before i was born! the baseplate doesn't actually have dots--i'm not sure if they were there once, and then rubbed off (a possibility, as the studs are rather smoother than i imagine they once were), or if this particular one didn't have the dots. this set also shows that the difficulty lego has in doing vehicle scale isn't new. the house is the perfect size for microfigures from the lego games; however, the car is massive--over twice as tall as a microfig!

4 great review mariko! this set is way before my time too. i like how lego used to create simple one story houses instead of the really tall house that we see in today's town theme, such as 8403 city house. one story houses such as 345 just look more realistic to my eyes. the simplistic, minimalism vibe that i get with this set is something that is hard to find in today's much more detailed sets (although, trust me, i love love love today's detailed sets). - the brick is epic

4 image link from brickset i thought i would do a pic review of the 1st lego castle, the yellow castle, #375- released in 1978. first, let me say that this set was truly "ahead of it's time". it introduced new building concepts (such as the hinge and new figs (most were still the armless, faceless mini-figs during this time). this set introduced me to castle which was my first real favorite theme. i enjoyed breaking it out from the garage and building it again. the majority of the pieces are 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 1x4, 1x6, and 1x8 standard yellow bricks. the set also includes yellow 1x4, 1x6x2, and 1x8x2 arches, yellow 2x2, 2x3, and 2x4 bricks, various grey plates, 1x2 black inverted slopes, red drawbridge pieces, two classic red castle doors, 8 hinges (2 for each corner), and a few other nifty pieces including six red 1x1 windows. a complete inventory is available at peeron: 375 inventory. a view from the front. the drawbridge is 6x8. the front tower stands 12 1/3 bricks high (plenty of room for horses). the drawbridge does work. the string (originally black) is attached to the opposite side between a plate and the arches. the right side of the castle (identical to the left). i've always loved the 2x2x3 sloped bricks (and corner pieces): the back. i love these red doors. a 1x4 brick attached to the other side of the baseplate keeps intruders out. that banner was the original sticker piece. notice the wear. the rear tower, largest of the towers: and backside: two hinges at each of the corners allow the corners to open for playability: before opening: open: lots of arches add to the detail of the inner walls: inner front: this set included 14 figs (how about that for quantity). unfortunately, i peeled off worn stickers from the shields and the breast plates years ago. the blue castle guards and knights are the keepers of the castle. i still think that these helmets are the best lego ever made. they just look good. the black and white knights: and the red knights: i've always prefered to use the black and red guards and flags from the knight's joust set(s): conclusion the yellow castle is truly a classic set and i'm so glad i kept the pieces to this together after all these years. if you have a chance to buy one or even obtain the set instructions, it's worth building and wouldn't be difficult to substitute grey or other colors. i hope you enjoyed this review and feel free to share your comments.

2 there's two alternates on the back of the instructions and as i recall, some sort of bridge on the inner fold or back of box. i threw away the box to this set years ago- just lucky to still have all the pieces. with standard pieces, you can build all these alternates and many more. that's why i don't particularly care for the new castles (like vladek's). they make building so difficult and duplicate pieces are so limited. here's an old shot of the castle in the city that it use to guard. we played for hours back in these days,

2 question for you guys, what's the best way to clean lego? i was noticing that the baseplates and gray plates to this set are very dusty and could use a good cleaning. mild soap water soak? is there a better way?

4 toothbrush and mild soap - and lots of time gently scrubbing a cleaning. and great review - i love that set *wub* *wub* i'm sorry that you seem to miss the stickers - if you find somewhere to download printable copies of them please let me know *satis* kimt

2 the original knights displaying their bright colored shields and breast plates (and a good wash helped to brighten them up).

2 quote i'm also impressed by the colors of the shields! even a good cleaning wouldn't do that with my old shields... have you ever tried replacing the heads by modern heads, just to see how that would look? remember never try to clean stickers! :'( kimt

2 here's a shot of a custom forestman. these really work well: i'm using just regular sticker paper. how do you stick transparent plastic on top?

2 i guess it's easiest to put the entire shield on a transparent sticker and cut the edges. i would also do that with the white stickers, because now you can still see the gray edges of the shield. perhaps you can make a bigger black, or brown in the other case, outline. you also wouldn't be able to see if the sticker is exactly in the middle...

4 great job on this review of a unique and rare set luxorv! considering the year it was released, this must have been a cool set back then. even up to now with all the specialized pieces and advanced building techniques, i could still appreciate the beauty of this brickbuilt harley-davidson police motorbike. the various elements are instantly recognizable and it even has the unusual 'partly-stacked' plates technique for the motor. overall, i'd say this is an above average set that is a must-have for any hardcore lego collector.

4 thanks 'luxorv' for this review of such a classic old lego set and i do remember seeing these in a catalogue years ago. excellent brick-built police cycle, i think it's time lego did another one eh ? brick on ride on everyone !

4 nice review! great nostalgic set, like you said, it has nice design-simple yet effective! i like construction vehicles, so this set has even bigger impact on me!

4 i voted 'outstanding.' regarding this set, i found mine at a consignment store. it was inside of a larger set from the same time period.

2 woah. 25 cents for a mint condition set! that's amazing.

2 great review, it's good to see some of the old sets reviewed. i think i learned something about the history of lego from this one.

4 i really like the design, it has an aesthetic value lacking from most official lego planes and follows closely to the real thing (minus the colours), something that can't really be claimed for more recent sets.

2 thebrickster, on jul 4 2008, 04:14 am, said: a close-up of the alpha-1 rocket. the white bricks never stayed together well often times coming apart within your hands: huh, did they not think of putting a technic axle down the center of the rocket? come to think of it, when were technic axles invented.... its a neat little set, makes me think i oughta make some similar kinda layout in ldd, very elegant for playability.

2 i always thought that that grey thing on top of the rocket was some kind of satelite... xenologer, on jul 4 2008, 05:25 am, said: huh, did they not think of putting a technic axle down the center of the rocket? come to think of it, when were technic axles invented.... i had this set as a kid and i don't think there was a technic axle inside that rocket, but if i remember correctly some of the later cs rockets did.

4 oh did i drool over this set as a kid! since i never got it i didn't know how bad the rocket really was... great review. xenologer, on jul 4 2008, 12:25 pm, said: come to think of it, when were technic axles invented.... the white ones were.

4 hey eb'ers, i got my market street on monday and finished building it last night. i know it?s not such a nice review like *yoda* did the last times, but i hope you enjoy some of the pics. first a pic of the complete building: the 3 minifigs: and i pic of the stairs (one of my highlights at this set): more pics you can find here my opinion about the set: i like this set very much, it was really fun to build it. i?m happy that that i got some more cherries and a croissant now *sweet* , a funny idea is the salad in the one box at the front. i think normally it?s a hairpiece of an exoforce fig. i also like the colours of the house, the dark blue is sooooo nice. i think i have to take more of this soon. the lighter blue is also nice. this set has really nice details like the stairs, or the owl at the entry of the market, or the balcony. i paid 89,99 eur, a fair price for a really nice set!! greetings sandra

4 thanks for the review, my favourite detail is the salad! :-d btw, could you exchange the modules and make pics of that? i'd like to see how the building looks with the flat roof instead of the dutch style one. i'm not sure though if the vents on the flat roof makes sense as long as it's only used as a garage top... :-/ maybe they should be removable as the balconies and such things to make the modularity leading not to weird results... other than this: in combination with a lot of money and the cafe corner set this really could get me into city! ;-)

0 thanks for the pics legocastlegirl! one thing that i find strange is that tlc doesn't use a female mf head for those two females mf in this set, but a female mf head is available in ldd and pab *wacko*

4 i also missed your review, but now that i found it i really happy i just ordered the set :) thanks for the pics! peter

4 legocastlegirl, on jun 20 2007, 05:20 pm, said: i also think that this is a replacement for some windows and i like this idea, because i often see houses with that kind of "windows" there was once "windowtaxes" in the netherlands. when rich people became poor, they placed bricks in their window, so they paid less taxes. some older houses still has walls were once were windows. historic information on :-d :-p

4 hi all! i just got my first gentle giant sw maquette and i?m in love *wub* *wub*! it looks so coooool ...... *y*! here?s some facts: height: 13.8 cm color: black 8-? helmet: non removable #?s made: 500 pieces sold at: blister event tokyo june 16, 2007 and now some pictures: i will crush you with my left bigtoe x-d! on the catwalk x-d! now i just have to wait for my boba fett, luke skywalker and get the stormtrooper & darth vader ..... >:-)! on my shelf on copmike

4 you?re a lucky man.... *y* thanks for those cool pics. :'-)

4 very nice *wub* how'd you get a hold of it?

4 starwars4j, on jun 27 2007, 04:48 am, said: very nice *wub* how'd you get a hold of it? evilbay can be your friend >:-)! here?s the text from the back of the box: quote for much of the galactic civil war, a mysterious agent of palpatine code-named blackhole carefully sifted through countless streams of data, distilling it into useful information for imperial intelligence. blackhole had an impressive amount of resourses available to him, including a entire star destroyer and its complement of troops and fighters. per his orders, the stormtroopers under his command had their armor cast in black to match his own particular eccentricities. the armor modification had practical benefits as well. the stygian-triprismatic polymer afforded the stormtroopers increased sensor-stealth. *wub* - pure poetry x-d! blackhole on copmike

2 so, were you serious about any of the boba fett, luke skywalker, stormtrooper & darth vader ones? because i'd love to see a boba fett and vader one. :-d

2 i have #70 (and #8 :-$ ). boba soon on copmike

4 wow thats so cool mutley. my favourites are darth vader and luke skywalker because the others seem to have funny looking heads. not so much boba fett but the storm trooper and the blackhole stormtrooper do. it must be their helmets. edited by roncanator, 02 december 2009 - 08:29 am.

4 wow! that was both an entertaining time, and a learning experience! it was entertaining because the comic made me laugh! it was a learning experience because, well, i dunno. just wanted to say it. anyways, great review, grievous! edited by trooperdavinfelth, 01 july 2007 - 09:46 pm.

4 nice review and a great story also grevious, this is a great set and a nice little army builder one at that. the only thing that saddens me about the line itself is the new arms on the skelies, they just look far to big when placed next to a normal fig. for me the old versions of the skelies were far better, why tlc changed to this is beyond me. still i shall be buying alot of these sets just to increase my army.

2 thanks for all the comments, guys, and thank you, joem16 and iamded for pointing out the reason for the skeleton horse leg positioning. ;-) well, i'll be gone on vacation until the 16, but i may pick up a set or two while down in tenessee, so if i do, expect a review and another story when i get back! ;-)

4 great review *y* small set with great figs and pieces=must buy the story was hilarious :-) any chance you are going to review another set? i'm still waiting for a certain member *cough*hinckley*cough* to review skeleton tower :-d piranha

2 grevious, on jul 1 2007, 10:28 am, said: for being a 5 dollar set (well, seven in my case. darn your above average prices, tru!) none of the castle sets have leaked into my area. i'd gladly pay seven dollars for this set. consider yourself lucky.

4 amazing little set. it seems this year that there are no crappy castle sets. good review.

2 i have not seen any either.... :-/

4 here is a review of the new monster dino creator set with power functions first lets start with the box which is much larger than it needs to be!! it is one of the new style re-closeable boxes rather than the rip the sides style. this set is typical of creator and comes with three sets of instructions. the monster dino a kind of spider and a crocodile the set comes with two of the new motors one small and one large, a sound module plus the new ir controler and receiver. there is a mix of techniques in this set the core is mainly studless technic, there are some studded technic parts and most of the details are standard creator style. there are two mechanisms one to control the legs and one to control the head and arms. the leg drive is from the large motor and the arm and head are operated from the small motor the completed mechanism will stand on its own without any detail added the detail is added to the base unit to complete the model. the operation of the dino is very good the design for the motors and drives is very compact and well thought out. the walking motion works well although there is no steering and it will fall over it it encounters obstacles. the sound module is built into the head so when the mouth opens the dino roars (sort of) glyman made the comment that this set is ugly as sin and i tend to agree i think there are too many colour variations with different shades of grey, black and that lime green :-p which confuses the look of the finished model but i guess it might apeal more to younger kids. i also do not like the spikes along the back, which glow in the dark, because the are loose and keep falling off. this set is not cheap at ?70 but i guess this is because of the motors and ir controller. while on this i was surprised how good the range was on the new controller it would still operate ever when not in direct line of sight. i would give this set a 10/10 for playabilityit has kept the kid amused for hours i would give it 6/10 for value for money it is a bit pricey overall 8/10 it took approx 3 hours to build and has been well played with i have posted some more images and some videos of the finished models on my brickshelf page here if you have any questions please ask pete edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 06:28 pm. indexed

4 thanks for your review ickelpete! *y* nice little movie you made (what?s on tv in the background?) ;-) :-d after reading, i wonder more than before what this dino has to do with creator? *wacko* the complete mechanism is technic, only the "design"-pieces on top are classic-style. i agree with your comment on the colour-selection. :-x is that turquise next to lime? looks like - well, i?m not telling you what i think of right now... ;-) pretty lego set, but not for me. i?m waiting for the first pics of the ferris wheel. or even better, the 8275 technic-bulldozer :'-) *wub* new motors on!

4 thanks very much for that review. i downloaded the instructions last week and i was largely impressed with what was in it. however, like holodoc, i am waiting for the bulldozer. i might have to settle with the dino though if lego charge australian some absurd price... edit: i just watched the videos. thanks! they are great. the dino is better than i thought... edited by sinner, 10 july 2007 - 02:29 am.

2 thank you very much for that interesting review, ickelpete. *y* well, the color scheme?s pretty bad and the design of that dino?s a bit to blocky for my liking, but the two alternative models you?ve built?re quiet nice. at least there?re a lot of possibilities coming with that set.... :-)

2 tks a lot for your review ickelpete ;-) i saw that set at tru a couple of weeks ago but was really not interested due to the design - i am not a fan of those motorized lego sets |-/ i guess the lime colour is to please kids, as well as the general design, far from a real dino ;-) i am sure that its going to sell well to a younger croud. let me quote you here: quote the walking motion works well although there is no steering and it will fall over it it encounters obstacles. hum, i really hope it works welll because i will have to buy that motorized at-at and i dont want it to crash :-p *yoda*

4 i bought this set last night and it is great. my biggest surprise was the wheels that were included; i didn't even know they existed and there aren't even that new. back to the set, he is such a cute dinosaur. :-d since he is so tubby i think he looks like a baby! i suspect my wife wanted him more than me.... my biggest interest in the set was to have more motors and ir parts so i could make an ir car. overall, i highly recomend this set, but as others have said, be warned that the box is very oversized. i wish lego would give up on this whole 1:1 picture thing. *wacko*

4 great review, i must admit i didn't like mm at first site, but seeing this review and looking at the mm boxes at stores appeal to me rather greatly, i may get a couple of these sets, great job! *y* :-)

2 i've got it also, but i think i'll replace the ball joint pieces with the kind of pieces that give the wings their angle.

4 the dropships looks neat, and your review is good. it isn't my theme, but it clearly is a fantastic set for the space lovers under us. mars mission is really a good step in the right direction for tlc.

4 ickelpete, on jul 13 2007, 11:06 pm, said: great review dunamis i hope you have as much fun with this as i have. one point yes they are new axles they have appeared in a few sets this year. yes, the kids seem to love it (as you pointed out) and the wife still thinks i am crazy so it's all good. i read your review after i posted mine. seems like we shared the same thoughts on a majority of it. i always think it is good to have multiple opinions on sets as it gives the community more data points to evaluate a given set.

0 looks really nice. one complaint is the back it is a pitty that lego didn't use any plates greebling there.

2 thanks for the review! i have two questions: - what is the driver standing on, when the hatch is open and he is looking out? - could you show the face of kallus without helmet, please? my only complaint is that the colours of both, kallus's and the drivers's uniforms are wrong. kallus's uniform is way too dark and should be more dark olive than black, and the drivers's uniforms are too bright and should be more greyish compared to what we saw in the series.

4 whitswj, on 24 december 2014 - 02:53 pm, said: here are the pics of kallus- his head would be good for a steam-punk character. thanks! indeed his face printing is really nice, they captured his looks and spirit well.

2 namioik, on 25 december 2014 - 08:53 am, said: i mean, it fits the 10 cents per piece count and has 4 figures so for a licensed theme you can't beat that. but i guess lego can never satisfy everyone this is true. i just had that price in mind when i saw the first images of it. it did not appear to be this big or complex, but new sets are getting so much more advanced than what they used to be.

2 i built this set and i think the two rubber pieces holding the both sides of the face is a bit stretched out therefore making the set somewhat tight for entire top hatch to open and close. does anyone have the same situation? is this right? -------------- never mind i got it! i built the back a stud too long! edited by namioik, 29 december 2014 - 03:04 am.

4 knightsword, on 01 january 2015 - 02:27 am, said: i meant the mold opposed to the paint job. the mold wouldn't really work. the way they did it is actually very accurate.

2 hi, i need some help...when i atach the pod to the place where the legs are placed, the small piece that unites the pod to the legs is loos from the bottom, so the top of the walker just moves around freely, wich is different from every video review that i have seen (where they can rotate the pod but its not loose) the small piece that serves as the axis isnt staying locked on the bottom piece and i have reassembled it all and still its the same :\ help! edit: sorry, i found out what went wrong...didnt push hard enough :d edited by mrpinache, 05 july 2015 - 12:10 am.

4 super outstanding review! i am outside at this moment and this review is certainly great to read while you are on the move. i am looking forward to get this upcoming new modular. it is definitely fun to play and real awesome indeed. thanks oky for this very fine review.

4 i want more of the story you made! also, ace review.

4 firstly, great review ++++++ i was really on the fence on this one. this review has greatly changed my view on this modular. a definite buy for me. love the interiors and the whole concept. the more i see it the more i see the little features which put this set apart or at least slightly different from the others. of course great playability for the younger lot and i think a nice building to give any lego city more character and colour...

4 great review oky! i managed to pick this set up a few days ago and i must say, it might be my favorite modular yet for the feel alone. the pool hall, barbershop, and the detective's office itself are all wonderfully designed!

2 can you please take some pictures/explain how the water tower is built? i understand that there are some tank treads bot how exactly? and it is "there can be only one"! edited by yooha, 01 january 2015 - 07:14 pm.

4 looking forward to picking up this set on saturday :-) nice review, love the tiny details and the printed parts.

2 nice review, thanks a lot. managed to improve my opinion of the set a bit, but i'm still getting two to build larger buirldings as soon as we get the next 2x vip points special

2 snaplock, on 01 january 2015 - 07:40 pm, said: totally agree with you, the height does seem rather small. also 2x buildings on a 32x32 base-plate with a lots of spare studs behind the buildings are these buildings 12 studs in width?. it still looks great style wise, however this might be a set i buy and look at it after i have built it & regret the amount of $$$ i have spent on it. $239 for us aussie's . both are are 14 deep on the upper floors. do is 3 studs deeper on the ground floor, buit that's pretty much it. can't believe how cramped the upper floors of the barber shop look. we've come a long way from the wide and empty halls of cc and gg.

4 thanks for the review! i'm a fan of the set but will be modding quite a bit. have to get a small bar into the highlander and then turn the second/third story above the barber shop into a proper apartment. the detective's office is great and will stay as is!

4 thank you for the amazing and really well-readable review! makes me want to get the set even more!

4 lego's affiliation with six wheelers go back a long way. i think the first one was released in 1981, more than 25 years ago. this year, lego added another one to the family, mars mission's "rhino 1", as its title sounds... it's been a while since i've bought and opened a large box, so maybe this isn't a surprise to most of you, but the box does not open at the front, as with many larger sw boxes, but at the side. the two printed seals(or whatever people call them) have gone as well, being replaced by one larger print in the middle of side... the box also isn't as thick as a large sw box, like the sandcrawler... the general size is, however, still quite large. pict0001.jpg 281.91k 102 downloads the back side shows the mars mission theme sets... eccept the rhino! i guess it shows this set will be released as a tru exclusive or something, only to show up in legoland shops and maybe lego shops... it's a shame really, because this is by far the best set of the theme. pict0002.jpg 285.42k 89 downloads when you open the front cover, you see a larger picture picture of the rhino. obviously, it seems to be some sort of multifunctional truck. i think the basic function is to drive around and explore. for that it has a drilling device and six giant wheels. pict0003.jpg 273.7k 82 downloads the set comes with two instruction books. i'm afraid to say they did not resolve the gray/black colors issue. colorwise, the real thing does not look like the instruction book because of it... pict0004.jpg 302.63k 75 downloads the rhino looks really big because of the six giant wheels. i guess it's more or less the same size as m-tron's magnetiser with the big difference between the two being that the wheels have been turned around, creating a unique wheel design for a lego model pict0285.jpg 290.59k 83 downloads pict0277.jpg 286.26k 80 downloads the wheels look very cool, even though the first couple of wheels stand a bit closer to each other. don't know why that is. hm... |-/ and they could have used a bit more body, but the design is pretty good. i know, "armagheddon" isn't far away... |-/ pict0292.jpg 216.75k 70 downloads the suspension of the wheels is a bit flimsy. sure, it allows the truck to move around in a more realistic way than the old sets, but it's not as flexible as some older sets, like sw's ctt. nor do the wheels have much body. the black bars you see on top of the wheels are more "window dressing" then functional... pict0293.jpg 244.78k 88 downloads the over all shape of the rhino is kinda "bulky", it looks more like a beatle than a rhino, if you're asking me. it has three major sections, but i wouldn't call it a modular building though... the cockpit is the first section. it's spacious and detailed. pict0290.jpg 262.77k 0 downloads pict0291.jpg 299.75k 87 downloads the cockpit hangs down from a weird angle. it's attached to a large vertical technic brick that is part of the rhino's main structure, so it's not a seperate spaceship, which is a shame... oh well... you can't have it all, i guess... pict0301.jpg 291.13k 78 downloads ah yes... stickers all over the place, but they're cool. the mid section of the rhino dominates the basic shape of the model. it's as if those two large white parts form a strong and thick shield, protecting whatever is inside from whatever is outsde. pict0007.jpg 213.22k 67 downloads unfortunately, there is nothing inside. it's extra space needed to house the spaceship. that's really a shame; a command center of some kind could have given the rhino a bit more "panache". pict0286.jpg 251.35k 87 downloads however, what's really great, is the way in which they fit together: one side has an orange 1x2 plate that fits in between two white 1x3 plates of the other side, creating yet another unique shape for a lego model. but again, it's a shame they didn't do more with this section... x-o pict0283.jpg 287.75k 82 downloads the third and last section is a platform for a space ship. pict0299.jpg 289.5k 77 downloads pict0287.jpg 199.78k 75 downloads the platform itself isn't really special. no details, no stickers,... it's just a skeleton to carry the spaceship, nothing more nothing less. no, your space ship doesn't fall off, even if you rotate the platform into a launch position, pushing the weight of the ship backwards. in fact, the position of the ship onto the platform is so solid, it's kinda difficult to imagine how this ship flies off. |-/ the ship on the other hand, is pretty cool. it's all sorts of things at the same time it seems. it transports two aliens, but also a small car that reminds me of the small sets of spacepolice 2, blacktron 2,... pict0295.jpg 307.4k 85 downloads pict0298.jpg 268.13k 75 downloads pict0294.jpg 276.84k 76 downloads the shuttle reminds me of a star trek shuttle and i think it needs some modding, but i do think it looks pretty nice. sure, the cockpit is a bit too low, a pilot needs to lay down instead of sitting down and the dropping mechnism, if there is one at all isn't all that brilliant either... the main structure is a bit too technical for me. i prefer actual parts with studs, not these lego technic bars and pins. pict0006.jpg 224.43k 74 downloads the crew: pict0276.jpg 239.43k 70 downloads ah yes, there's also this green plastic residu. think they are supposed to be the aliens... and there's also this weird alien craft, but i didn't bother to build that... *sad* good: *wub* great, innovative design, lots of potential, i even like the colors *sweet* lots of playability it's a big, attractive model; i don't see any weak spots in the design that could compromise stability or structural integrity. not so good: |-/ too many technic parts, some sections on the model, like the gun and the drilling device are a bit to flimsy i'd say 7.5-8.5/10 price: 750 danish crowns, about 105euro

2 this is a great review and so is the set *y* i thought i would buy it, but when i saw the price... i changed my mind x-d i always liked flying things better though... like the dropship... although that is a bit pricey too, i guess x-d

4 two of my daughters are building this as we speak. i agree the design is a lot smaller than i would have liked, but they're loving it. no question the figures are the real draw here. and at 6 and almost five years old they're doimg a good job building so far. at least for the 4-6 range in my house, this set is a home run. thanks for the great review, mostlytechnic!

4 very nice review, mostlytechinc! once i saw this set i was interested in it for the colours and pieces...thanks for this review to shed more light onto it!

0 isn't getting parts in new colors a good thing? it is a shame there is only this one set, i think tlg could make a whole subtheme out of frozen. i do agree that they overuse lavender and magenta, i don't see why every girl set has to have these sort of colors instead of what would be accurate to the source material .

0 when i first saw the pictures, i didn't realize that this set had so much color barf going on in it. also, there is a bunch of stuff that does not fit in with the movie, and it is pricey. the minifigures are nice, but no kristoff or sven. i thought about getting this, but this review is pushing me towards no.

0 yep, my family all thinks they should have made a bigger set, added figs, and just been printing money. this feels massively rushed into production. which is weird, the other princess sets that just came out look worlds better.

4 i wish elsa had more of a white hairpiece rather than blonde. but it could be worse. not a bad set overall, although olaf doesn't look right without the twigs on his head. anna is a really nice and accurate fig.

2 mostlytechnic, on 10 january 2015 - 02:02 am, said: i think the trans-glitter blue panels can be icy or snowy just fine. i'm sure that's why they used them for this set. now, if you're looking for realism (like the photos in your sig seem to be), it might be tougher. but i've been thinking about using those big glittery panels to make a waterfall-type scene. the guys over in the historic forum will kill me if my mocs start to glitter i'll take a closer look when i see the set in a shop (and, as i understand, i can sell the minifigs for the price of the set...).

4 great review! i definitely agree, the minidolls are too awesome and are definitely a must-have. i love all the extra pieces from any set, some of them go on my phone case.

4 i love how the front/hood looks like a lion.

0 good and helpful review again, whitefang. i probably have no use for a lionish creature with goofy looks...

2 what's up pups? i have written a review for 7786 batcopter: the chase for scarecrow on my website: brickzone.net as usual it involves fabuland figures involved in a crazy story. enjoy and feel free to let me know what you think. thanks! x-d click on the picture to read the review...

4 starwars4j, on jul 18 2007, 03:22 am, said: that new pumpkin is fantastic, i can't wait to get it in the set...how many come with the set? i hope more than two :'-( um...two. :-/ sorry. i made that face to see which emoticon matched. that's how i feel. sorry, it sucks but they are very cool. i also am very happy with this purchase. both vehicles are awesome. i may even keep them together for a few days! :-d :-d :-d

4 very nice hinckley! the payton and fenix thing was great *y* "carnavore!" :-d

4 sinner, on jul 18 2007, 05:19 am, said: that was a great review with loads of excellent pictures. the set is better than i thought. i want to buy one of the new sets as i would love a blue batman, but they are so expensive for australians. i love the new pumpkin heads. the story involved more mini-fig cruelty; excellent! i also liked the scarecrow/crow joke. :-d (one request; please don't say lines like "to the batcopter" next time. that is the old tv series and i hated that. >:-) feel free to tell me to stick my request up my m#g@bl*cks.) sinner, thanks brother! and yes please take your request and stick it...back in your heart where it came from! :-x i know you mean well, but i love the camp!! i purposely put "to the batcopter" and my favorite "the jig is up!" in there because it's so ridiculous. and don't you know requesting me not to do it will only encourage me to do it more? i annoy because i love... *wub* the crow is my favorite part. :-$ i'm happy to be swaying you over to the side of mini-fig suffering >:-) it sucks that your pricing is so different over there. perhaps if you're a good sinner (?) santa will bring you some evil pumpkin heads for christmas. or whoever brings you presents over there...a magical wallabee flying a didjeridoo, i presume... :-p piranha! always my biggest fan. thanks brother. i'm glad i can amuse you. book of the ancients is serious but fabuland housewives will overlap for those who prefer the comedy. i hope book of the ancients is good. i'm re-tooling it right now because i was identifying a lot of cliches, so i threw a lot of plots out the window and re-visited my whole concept. anyway, there will always be quick wacky reviews that will hopefully amuse you. norrington-thanks as always, my buddy. *sweet*

2 nice review. the batcopter is pretty neat, but i prefer scarecrow's bi-plane. quote batsy: we needed to wrap this review up so i used my baterang. bianca: is that really what it's called? batsy: beats me... nooo... it's batarang.

0 great review! funny as allways! the comic was just a hell lot of fun. it really had me laughing. i would love to have this set but the price is just to high here, far worse than i had expected. i'll be better off buying the battank, which is much better priced. actually there is almost no price difference between the batcopter and the battank here *wacko*

4 thanks for the review. i'm definitely getting this, mainly becasue it's batman. i love the blue bats, the scarecrow is good as ever, and those new pumpkins are just *wub* . there's a few things i'll mod, but nothing really major. i'll have to wait till i get this to decide properly though.

2 what a fine review and what a funny story, thanks! *y* dark tan and new technic hub.... very interesting. scare the crow on! :-d

2 very nice review *y* :-p :-d

2 sinner, on jul 19 2007, 04:15 am, said: sorry, due to my convoluted sentance structure you mis-interpretted me. i meant that joel shumaker's movies fall well within the category of being against the idea that batman is as big a loon as the guys that he hauls in. just to be sure, i hate :-x the joel schumaker batman movies. thank you for clarifying. we can still be friends now. people are entitled to their opinions but the opinion that the joel schumacher batman films are any good is just wrong and stupid. :-p sinner, on jul 19 2007, 04:15 am, said: i'll get back to you at christmas. it is possible i made a mistake. yes. i also wrote to lego about it and i posted their reply. thanks for the link! i was too lazy to search...

2 sinner, on jul 19 2007, 04:08 pm, said: incidentally, i love your new avatar copmike. fabuland has a certain charm... thanks :'-) ! fab on copmike

4 out of nowhere this set appeared at my local tru. hadn't been expecting this one for a while, so a nice surprise. *sweet* firstly the box. nice pic on the front. good selection of minifigs. the officer and pilot look cool with their dark blue trousers. a new r2 unit as well. don't remeber this in the film, but great to have one in a new colour. *wub* back of the box shows some of the ship's nifty features. first thing you notice when you open the box, is the awesome selection of bricks. this makes a for a great parts pack. loads of unusual red and dark red pieces. it's so refreshing to see a star wars set that isn't predominantly grey. there are also two instruction booklets. as soon as you open the first booklet you hit an error. why would i want two obi-wans? :-| it's also at this point that you come across a big disappointment. on the box you get a flesh qui-gon. what is actually in the box is an epiii obi-wan. come on lego - why change it? |-/ all the figures look impressive in the flesh despite the big mistake. once i started the build it progressed rapidly. red pieces seem to be a lot easier to find. lots of clever techniques. quite a few technic elements get used at the start. it reminded me of building a technic set from the 80s at times. here is the main body half way through the build. the landing mechanism is a nice touch. its not fully retractable, but still folds away nicely. you find the ship keeps tipping over as you build it despite the feet, as it's only at the end thay it all becomes evenly balanced at both ends. here the feet are extended. you can also see the yellow knob that rotates the radar on top of the ship. landing gear up viewed from the front. here are the radar. a great collection of dishes. they spin easily with little friction. here is the ship at the half way point. the front works well with the top flipping up to squeeze in the pilot. more to come... :-)

2 you're second post on this forum and already you bring us this great review. thanks for making this !!

2 thanks for this great review *y* :-) and welcome to eurobricks *n* whats with the obi wan head??? darn tlc........ piranha

4 7665 review part 2 the second half of the build goes quicker than the first. once you start to add the engines, the ship really begins to take shape. the main body of the ship has a few surprises hidden away under a removable cover. inside you get some retracting guns, a storage box, a little shuttle and space for a droid and figure. here is everything you can fit inside. the guns are concealed behind the side vents. pushing them forward causes the vents to open. closed: and open: the final feature is the passenger area/escape pod. inside is plenty of space for two figures. the pod cleverly attaches by pushing the front section of the ship forward, sliding the pod in, then returning the front. everything locks together and is held securely in place by an elastic band. :-) here's a couple of pictures of the final model. it's not the most beautiful creation ever, but it is an excellent representation of the ship from the film. the angular shape actually suits a lego build well. there's one more useful feature. the whole ship can be safely and comfortably picked up by two ball ended technic pins towards the back end. it balances well at this point and does allow you to swoosh the ship around much more easily. this was the most enjoyable star wars build i've had in a long time. everything progresses nicely with almost no repetitive bits. the ship looks good and is also huge! *sweet* compare it to the 6211 isd and you'll see it's only fractionally smaller. when i first saw pictures of this on the internet i thought it looked ok. once you see it for real it is much more impressive. for ?69.99 in the uk i'm not complaining. it's the best value star wars set of the year so far. to conclude: pieces: 9/10 minifigures: 7/10 (would be a 9 apart from the stupid qui-gon/obi-wan head error) playability: 8/10 originality: 9/10 set design: 8/10 overall: 8.2/10 the box says this is a limited edition set (whatever that means). so if you're planning to get it i'd suggest you grab it at the first opportunity. i'm glad i did! x-d edited by kernow, 22 july 2007 - 10:56 pm.

4 thanks for the review! i'm glad to see lego including details of everyday life, like the food (though a plate would have been nice). steve

4 nice review, i like the building/port the most mmm,dark blue plates *wub* pity it is a toys'r'us exclusive, in the netherlands there are only toys'r'usses in the greater cities.

2 @ mr tiber: they have them at the toys'r'us in eindhoven. in the new shoppingcentrum west of the bijenkorf. and the bijenkorf is west of the central station.

4 thanks for the review brickster! it's great to be able to see more views of this set.

4 ok here is the set alot of us star wars fans have been waiting for! the 7666 hoth rebel base! *wub* first the box now the great minifigs! that stunning k-3po fig! now the snowspeeder! aaaaggghhhhh these parts are all stickers! now for the turret! the 2 cones on the side press in to fire out 2 blue lights saber blades :-d now for the small crane thingy. yes the part under the engine on the snowspeeder is another sticker 8-| echo base!! (well the front door anyway :-d ) the main control room? :-d again these are stickers on a tinted clear panel and on the slope |-/ i have no idea what this is meant to be! :-d finally 2 shots of the full set! *wub* well over all i really like this set and think it is great value for money. the minifigs alone would set you back more than the cost of this set. the build time was a good 2 hours or so and was good fun! the snowspeeder is not as good as the second snowspeeder and no where near as good as the first in my opinion, but i did love that first one. the k-3po fig is perfect and it is good to be getting more droids that aren't r2-d2 and c-3po. it is a shame about the stickers but that is the price of keeping the cost down i suppose (the only printed part in the whole set is the snowspeeder/x-wing windscreen). i will definately be getting atleast another 3 of this great set. 9/10

4 thanks for the review! mutley777, on aug 2 2007, 02:37 pm, said: i have no idea what this is meant to be! :-d that's to put the snowspeeder on (there should be a 2x4 plate underneath the snowspeeder that fits in that gap).

2 sam89, on aug 2 2007, 10:59 pm, said: that's to put the snowspeeder on oh. :-$

4 a very good review, thanks mutley777! *y* hmm, that shattered base looks better than i thought.... a very playable set, really nice. for the snowspeeder, i prefer the main gun design of its predecessor, but the grappling hook gun is a good improvement. if the door would just be large enough for it.... :-p

2 mutley , did you bought it @ tru? - are there any other sets? exept of hoth base , and is there the republic cruiser?

4 aayla-secura, on aug 2 2007, 03:22 pm, said: mutley , did you bought it @ tru? - are there any other sets? exept of hoth base , and is there the republic cruiser? i really had to restrain myself this morning! they had all the new star wars summer sets and republic cruiser too!!! there was a girl unpacking sets and saying to me, oh this ones just come in and this one :-d (showing me the republic cruiser, mtt, jedi with hyperdrive ring, naboo star fighter and the hoth base) i had to leave, or that would have ended up one very expensive morning :-d

4 wow!! why didnt you bought 3 of them :-d?

4 wow, i didn't think we'd get a review so fast 8-? really nice review, the pictures explain it all *y* :-) i really hope to get this set as it is really great... i guess :-d

4 the snowspeeder is love.

4 excellent set. the snowtroopers are just amazing (most lego imperial troops are really good). however, it's sad that except from luke, all the rebels have the same face which is what is more the most unexpressive that you can find. for the rest, the quality looks excellent. the snowspeeder is far better than the first they realized (but only one thing: it looks a bit too white to me. i think i remember they were grey and orange rather than white in the film) and the echo base door is really cool. really nice set. edited by lord beckett, 02 august 2007 - 04:14 pm.

4 great review. i see now why the b model is so popular. i wonder though, on the car, if instead of the panels for the rear spolier (or wing) if they could have used studded panels and maybe layer them to give the appearance of, ie: a three element rear wing. i won't mention the front lights. if i had the money i would buy it for the b model. h

4 i think this set will be my next purchase. i love the color scheme and indeed it looks like a nice set. also 1200 parts for eur 100 is not a bad deal. and yes, the looks of the car have really grown on my since the first official pictures appeared. i'm curious how the bright green will work combined with other colors than white. i really hope more sets in the future will use the color (so that more different parts will be available over time). i think i'm the only person on eurobricks who doesn't like the looks of the b model, but i appreciate the extra functionality it offers. besides the set itself, i think this is one of the best reviews i have read in a while. great job on the superb photographs (which i think are essential to a review) and the extensiveness of it all. you really touched every subject, which is great :d

4 fantastic review jim, from the quality of the review alone it is easy to see how much hard work you have put into it. i'm with you on the instruction manual, i much prefer one quality bound book over umpteen stapled booklets. already have 2 of these sitting in the build queue, one for display model as i'm a fan of this one and one to build the b model then dissemble for parts, so i'm already sold on his set but still very much enjoyed taking the time it deserves to read through the review and ogle at your pro photography.

4 i was very skeptical of this set because i really thought the redesign degraded the looks of the a-model a lot, but after building it i must say this is an excellent set. good job tlg!

4 great review jim.. i have been sitting on the fence about if i will get this set for a while but i saw one built for the first time at a local brick show on the weekend. it definitely looks better in real life than any pics. i have decided to buy one

2 wonderful review, but i am still not sold on the set. if we get more sets with the bright green i might be tempted to get it, but until then it is too few parts in bright green (too few different types, not the number of pieces) to be able to use that colour effectively in making moc's.

4 excellent review, thanks! what is the cost in us? not released in my area. the shovel is obviously my favorite area, it looks detailed and strong. i love the treads, because i need them to move the 4 x 4 barrels on my super-scaled turbolaser turret. very good pics too. what color are the treads? i never had them. they are plastic or rubber? edited by grand moff viceroy, 03 august 2007 - 12:34 am.

4 thanks for the review! this looks like a great set, and with four motors, two receivers and a remote control i wouldn't say it is overpriced. it is still a lot of money though..... if my scholarship permits it i will seriously consider buying this set.

4 ickel, thanks for that awesome review. it makes me want to buy this set. i think it'd go just swell with the mobile crane. the fact that it has all the motors and such is awesome, i can foresee using those for a lot of other functions for mocs. and, well i'm a fan of treads. you can never have enough treads :-d hm, would you be able to tell us, perhaps after a test or two what kind of weight this beast can push around? thank you!

4 thank you ickelpete for that great review. i give you two *y* up. i am not a technic fan, but this set definitly looks *sweet* . i see great potential using this set as a model for a smaller dozer for my town/train layout. i really *wub* the crawler tracks they used. i have been thinking about buying the snowmobile for the tracks. but if possible, i just might buy this set instead. i could definitly use the other parts for moc's. model on!!

2 lham, on aug 9 2007, 12:00 pm, said: could you please please post the instruction boolets' number codes (located on the back in tiny print)? so that we can download them from lego.com and have a look for ourselves. when i read this i first though you meant set number but this model can't be found there yet and now i realize that you mean something completly different. what is this code you're after?

4 the new small technic sets have incredible functionality for their size, and this one is no exception. with only 106 parts this crane can roll, extend, rotate, lift (and hold in any position) and has working stabilisers! the boom extends the same as the other sets with this boom; simply pull it. it works surprisingly well and due to circular ridges inside the boom the extension (which is just a standard beam) will hold in place. the gear at the back controls the height of the boom. as you can see the boom is only half extended. boom fully extended, half down. the cable is kept in place via two gears and a blue pin, same as the 7905 crane. even under decent weights this works well. the stabilisers however cannot handle much weight once the load is moved off axis. the stablilsers are a very simple but effective design. another shot of the stablilsers. this also shows how far the boom will decend. the boom height mechanism works well also. i love the cab design. overall this is a remarkable achievement for the low price. i bought it for the boom piece as i want to improve the crane that came with 7998 7898 ( :-$ ). i highly recommend it.

0 very nice review sinner! *y* *wub* so we are getting more and more reviews with figs in it, that?s great! :'-) i actually wanted to skip this technic set, but your review made me think again. i haven?t seen you posting a price, so i will do that for you :-p : it?s (just) 9,99? in germany.

4 a very nice review of a very good little set, thanks sinner! *y*

4 cute. do mine eyes deceive me, or is it actually minifig scale?

4 can you post a pic of it next to the simpsons house? just curious about size comparisons...

4 great review!! thanks for paying a little extra to get it now and review it for us!!! you must be a youngin'...those phone booths thingys are called "pay phones" :) j/j they're tough to find nowadays.

0 i have sooo mixed feeling about that... i loved the simpsons house (save for the terrible wall in the homer and marge's room), but this so far is inferior in almost every aspect. the walls made of panels is a bummer. i expect a d2c set to be better that this. 60+ stickers? the same thing. same price for less bricks and smaller build then the house. strange coloured bricks on the outside wall (some ugly mix of yellow + tan) panels again with their fronts facing towards the inside of the shop so we and up with those squares all around. the walls are yellow, this was so nice, lost opportunity to make it in some other less common colour. then again the set overall looks is good. the roof is a nice detail. the shop looks actually like a real one, not just an approximation of one. the roof tiles are in dark orange - we got new/rare colour here the car looks interesting to build (just like the pink one from the house) lots of nice references to the show it's the simpsons! definitely a must buy... but for a discounted price. i'll try to find one with maybe damaged box or after-display copy. edited by mestari, 14 april 2015 - 01:15 pm.

4 looks great. how does it compare to the house

4 great review just2good, honestly i love this set lots of great details and references.

4 nice review, i'm building it (need to finish it, but i'm at work right now) with the printed piece, you forgot to show the chocolat milk 1x1 brick, which is exclusive to this set yet (it isn't referenced on bricklink yet, only the blue one) the set is really fun to build, with a lot of little pieces for the fridges. i haven't put the stickers yet, will see the final product to put the essentials ones

4 nice review sinner! *y* my favorite part of this set is the parrot in the front window! *wub*

4 awesome set! i really like the robots, and that tiny tank could be quite useful! all the fancy machinery in there really make it more like a lab than a restaurant! :-d the thing i found most funny was the positioning of the middle finger on the hand. :-d :-d definitely gave me quite a laugh. x-d

4 great review of a great set! *wub* i look forward to more!

4 morten_sonne, on aug 15 2007, 01:53 pm, said: great review. very funny with "little you" helping with the building. i got the wagon myself, i really like it. what more did you get? morten loved the review does anyone know if "my own train" sets still available in shops in the uk or just from ebay, bl, etc?

4 nice review about a nice set (i like this wagon, but don't buy it, because of the size, compared to my other wagons...). poor minifig who had to build an entire set! :-d

4 *wub* *wub* *wub* *wub* *wub* holodoc, i seriously have some love for your review!! you're in it and using a fabuland wrench!!! such a clever review with a great sense of humor! i really liked this train set and it adds so much to a train layout, especially when you buy multiples. tlc is throwing away a potential gold mine by discontinuing this line. :'-( it is also nice to see those beautiful consistent slopes in that picture. it really is sad that tlc is letting quality slip. they don't seem to be responding to the issue they way they did the bley/frown fiasco. perhaps we afol need to make more of a stink! to the embassy!!! >:-( again great job holodoc and thanks for sharing *sweet* *y* what an excellent and fun review!!

4 great review. i hope you mini-self is ok after all of that lego burying him :-d this is one of the great sets that lego has produced, since forever. i think more sets like this should be manufactured *wub* - poomie

4 excellent review doc - i?m glad you can get out of the holodec *y*! i could see this done with other colors than blue also *sweet*!! 9v on copmike

2 photoshop?s your friend... *skull*

4 that?s really a great and overall nice playset with a very cool mrs. puff and a fine new spongebob! *sweet* the boating school?s indeed very nice with a beautiful color scheme, and so is the lighthouse.... i?m really tempted to buy a second set just to "complete" these buildings.... although it?s a little too expensive for doing so, and it wouldn?t even fit with the style of the other sb sets. x-d wet highway to the poor puffer fish? privat hell on! :-d

4 i like this one better than the other one for parts and such, plus i'm generally a sucker for any different minifig, but yeah, that price is steep. great review though!

4 one more sb face - yeah *wub*! being a lighthouse freak i really like it, the trans clear blue ones rocks *y*! i?m getting it - period! sb on copmike

4 thank you *yoda* for strike 2! it?s sb again. |-/ sticker alarm! :-x but this set is better than chum bucket. there are far more interesting parts if you don?t like sb. especially the light house and the little hut with the wooden pontoon. *y* and yet again another set with smooth slopes and rough ones... too bad, too bad. >:-( >:-( >:-( if i just knew the person who is responsible for that... >:-)

4 maybe mrs puff has a nice toy inside x-d i like this review. the lighthouse part and the school are nice enough for other towns. and the figs are nice, even mrs puffs 2 pieces you can't use for other things. :-) pity that it's 50 dollars/+/- 60 euro. for half price i would think about it.

2 it looks like a good set but i would rather get the neighborhood one.

4 a very fine review of a very fine set, thanks sinner. *y* the variety of cool colors in that set?s just formidable. one more beautiful creator set indeed! roaarrrr on! :'-)

4 sinner, on aug 16 2007, 04:01 pm, said: i just love playing with the new princess! you will be seeing her shocked and dismayed for a while to come... shocked and dismayed? when you give her flowers last week she was also shocked and dismayed. i think she's just allergic for both flowers and animals. i hope she's not allergic for skeletons too. :-p :-d by the way: great review, you made a nice warm, soft place to sleep for hinckley. x-d

2 i'm pleased to see that this is available for purchase, at least in some parts of the world, rather than only being available with the jw game. nice review, i'll going to scope out whether toys r us in sweden is carrying them, although i've never seen polybags in there before.

2 thank you, guys. i'm glad you liked this review. it's a nice little set.

2 great review man, really well written and structured. hoping to go on a hunt and see if this is available in uk stores soon.

2 nice i had to buy the jw lego game to get mine.

4 lego 31036 creator toy and grocery shop thanks to eurobricks for making this review possible! for years, lego has offered a house of some sort in the creator line each year - with the standard creator 3-in-1 instructions, that's given us a very wide variety of housing. in 2014, they added a business option with their 31026 bike shop and cafe set. this continues into this year's toy and grocery shop set. these shops are smaller than the very detailed modular buildings, but that should help them fit in better with the other city sets, and this also lets them get into more kids' cities with their lower pricetag. name: toy and grocery shop set number: 31036 pieces: 466 price: $39.99 minifigs: 2 theme: creator year of release: 2015 links: bricklink peeron brickset the box the front of the box shows the "a" version model out of the three, plus insets of the b and c versions. i like the sorta-european looking backdrop; it goes well with the styling of the buildings. interestingly, the main model is shown opened up for play, while the two insets show those versions folded. the box top on the top of the box, lego helpfully shows that with 3 of these sets, you can make a whole street. the box back on the back, you get to again see all three versions together, but this time, folded. it's a little creepy though with those clones running around :) the manuals yep, three actual, printed manuals. there's nothing indicating them as being a, b, and c models, but it's pretty obvious looking at the designs which is the "main" model and which are the alternates. the contents bags of parts and two plates. nothing terribly exciting to see here.... the minifigs nothing new here, but two nice figs none-the-less. well, bricklink does say that both figs are unique to this set, but there's not any new parts to them. the closest thing to rare is the female head - it's only in this set, 2013's dragon mountain castle set, a uk store grand opening set, and one of the 2014 holiday freebie sets. the faces aren't that unique, but i guess this exact combo of two faces on the head is. i love the kid torso with the spaceman on it. the minifig backs no back printing on anything here except for an alternate female face. sorry. i do like that her two faces are so different though. that's much better than when a head has a "scared" and a "more scared" face. the "c" build enough with the basics; let's build. i'm going to review them in the same order i built them, backwards. since you can tell immediately looking at the 3 designs that they're going to use different numbers of pieces and so forth, i figured i'd build the smallest first lest it seem like a letdown. all three have some basic similarities - the two plates are hinged to give a building that opens for play. they also do have interiors, which you can see starting to form here. the "c" build, front it's a pretty quick build, so it's done already. here's the front of the building with it opened up. like this, it appears to be two separate stores, a newsstand and some sort of shop you can enter. all the printed tiles help give the newsstand a detailed appearance, but i'm not sure why they've got a $100 bill lying on the ledge... the "c" build, rear from the back side, the interiors are pretty plain. the shop half has a plant in a jar and a weird chair, and the newsstand just has a register. the "c" build, sides here's the two sides of the folded building. on the hinge side, there's a bunch of windows in a disjointed wall with random colors. on the other, why did they put in a huge window when the set does include a trans-clear door that could have gone there? and you get a small patch of plants, like so many sets seem to have these days. the "c" build, extras that's a lot of leftovers there. and not just little stuff - multiple doors, stairs, etc. and unused sand green is always a little sad.... the "b" build, 1 a pretty similar start, with the hinge and little garden and some tiles along the ground. the "b" build, 2 now we see a big windowed wall, some details like lights, and how it has the usual alternate model "weird part usage" - like a 1x4 brick with side studs being used over the doorway, even though those side studs will not get used. the "b" build, front the finished building gives us a nice little post office, with a letter-carrying bird on the roof. hope that's not their normal method of delivery! something about the colors just doesn't work for me though. the combo of white / light grey / dark grey / black / sand green plus tan is just too much. the tan window and door frames i don't like. the "b" build, inside on the inside, things are weird. the counter on the left is ok, but the light above the door (with a yellow clip? ugly!) is too big, and everything else over there by the door doesn't make much sense either. the "b" build, sides i like the front side here, except the colors are still too much. the bench, greenery, mailbox on the corner, and streetlight are all nice. the boy is a little creepy though - binoculars in hand plus a telescope on the roof of the post office? why? the hinge side shows more of the weird colors you get in the wall, but that's going to be hidden when the set is open. plus we even see that on big modulars at times, so it's not so terrible. the "b" build, leftovers again, a lot of leftover parts. it's obvious this was another alternate, but it'd be nice to see more of them used to make a bigger building. but let's move on to the model that does use them all... the "a" build, 1 the first half starts like this. maybe it's just my bias, but it already feels like a more detailed build. bottles on the wall, the yellow and red awning over the window, etc. the "a" build, 2 the other half starts off with detailed work too. i think that's a red vending machine. the stairs are also very solidly built. i also appreciate the effort to get that diagonal base where a door will be - it's such a nice touch to have sections of a building that aren't right angles. the "a" build, 3 not too much has been added, but i wanted to showcase the tiny toys before they get hidden by a wall. that robot and train are just fantastic little micro builds. the "a" build, 4 things are coming together quickly. the walls, windows, and doors get the first floor nearly done. i'm still not big on the sand green and tan combo, but i do really like the red and yellow awnings. the "a" build, 5 it appears the shop owner lives upstairs, since we've got a bedroom forming here. the bed is a little plain, but the table and lamp on the other half are great. and my big fingers did not like putting all those railings on the balcony, with the telescope posts and tile tops. knocked quite a few off before i got them all done. the "a" build, front and it's done. all the details make this set really feel like a mini-modular. the roofline has great greebling, and the shop contents, and on and on. it's not perfect though. the tiny car above the toy store door isn't nearly as good as the toys inside. and the kid's yellow scooter? the wheels aren't even on the ground, much less able to roll. the scooter looks decent though, so that counts for something. well, at least as long as you are at this angle, since the boy's only got 1 foot on the 1 stud wide scooter. the "a" build, inside most of the interior has been seen already. the roof though does a nice job of being interesting for a roof. a skylight, the edge rails, etc. and you can see there's not much "wrong color" in the walls. the "a" model, sides an interesting building when folded up. very tall and skinny. you can tell it's not really meant to be displayed this way - it's meant to be open. the good - lots! i like the awning, the diagonal door, the flowerbox under the upper window, the folding gate on the balcony that lets it be used in open or closed mode, and the green / white / blue colors. the bad - well, the stairs end short of the upper door, i still don't really like the tan doorframes (i think black would have been better), and why don't the upper floors match up in size? the "a" model, leftovers ah, that's more like it. just a few small pieces left as spares. the errors you might have to click through to the full-size versions, but i did catch a few weird errors in the manuals. first, in the photo of the newsstand, the map in the front corner is on there sideways. the map does have a clear north arrow printed on it. on the second image, the boy's feet are hanging off the edge. just unusual to see an alignment error in the manual like that. the comparison here are this set and the modular detective office side by side. there's a huge difference - as you'd expect. but is the difference more than you'd expect? this set is 466 parts, $40. the do is 2262 pieces and $160. 5 times the parts, 4 times the price. looking at them side by side, i'd expect a bigger difference in both. the conclusion so, what's my conclusion on this model? i love the main model, but the alternates are meh. it's a nice set for someone looking for a town building other than police and fire stations, but who isn't ready to move to the modular line. compared to the modulars though, it seems overpriced. part of that is because the huge modulars are actually a great deal compared to other lego sets. i'm also a little surprised that it's so small, when you compare it to the city sets like a police station. those are generally designed with much more open space, letting them be more of a playset. this one is small and cramped, so it'd be tougher to play in. it's not really a city set though. the ratings value: 7/10 - it's under the 10 cents a part mark, but that's largely due to having a ton of tiny parts. all those flowers and decorative 1x1 round studs add up quickly! design: 7/10 - good and bad on the colors, and there's a big difference between the quality of the main vs alternate models. having so many leftover pieces is one thing when the creator set makes 3 very different models (ie a boat, plane, and truck). when it's 3 buildings, it seems wasteful to have so many parts leftover. minifigs: 6/10 - i'm not sure they both fit the set. i suppose the boy is going to the toy store and the woman is going to the grocery? but there's no storekeeper in either. the woman doesn't look like a storekeeper to me, so that's why i assume she's another shopper. i love the boy, but the woman is just so-so - except that i do appreciate the head having two very different expressions. but again, that doesn't fit the set. i can't see her scared face being used. playability: 6/10 - the shops are detailed with registers and so forth, but it's all so tiny it'd be hard to play with the figs in it. parts: 9/10 - tons of windows and doors, plus nice sand green bricks. but some things (the large blue curves used on the roof for example) are weirdly specialized and would be hard to use in another building design. overall: 7/10 - i'd recommend doing what i did - build the alternates first, then the main since that's how you'll want to leave it. i'd really like to see the price a little lower compared to other sets (again, the part count is inflated due to so many tiny parts) and the finished building is tiny, but it's loaded with neat details.

2 great review! very thorough. it's not a set which makes me run to tye store, but it definitely has some fun elements. i do like your new grey background. your pictures look great!

0 lightningtiger, on 04 may 2015 - 12:55 pm, said: thanks 'mostlytechnic' for this review, i only brought this set to continue the shop series from creator. in my opinion it's only half as good as the bike shop/cafe one. plus it doesn't fit the same as that pair of shops, oh well maybe next year lego creator will have a better one. brick on review on 'mostlytechnic' ! well, it is only half the price of the bike/cafe one too :) but i agree, it seems odd that they've made a couple "shop" creator sets that don't fit together in style like this. i guess they've done that for years with the creator houses though - none of those really work together. david thomsen, on 04 may 2015 - 01:33 pm, said: reviews for this set really should picture them next to the bike shop & cafe, which it's intended to be compatible with right down to the size of the baseplates and grey tiles around the edge. it doesn't look that great on its own, but if you add the two sets together you get something that begins to look like a street scene. interesting to get two comments right in a row with opposite opinions :) i don't have the bike/cafe set, but to me, they don't looks like they'd really go together. they're the same concept (two buildings that fold in half) but the sidewalk is different size and they just feel differently styled to me.

4 informative review, thanks! *y* as usual, it makes a fairly good parts pack. wish i could pick up a few on deep discount, but at full price one is fine. i do like the 'stewards' and some of the workmen. overall, i think i'm looking more forward to the belville calendar, just for it's assortment of unusual parts. ugh. belville. still, parts are parts, and it's got some. phoinix summed up one of the most common complaints i hear about all of the lines in 3 simple words ... "no girls....again!" good job, now get lego to listen. ;-)

2 andy_0306uk, on sep 13 2007, 02:23 pm, said: thanks are not needed but if anyone wants to show me gratitude by sending me all their orange and/or pink bricks .......... ;-) pink bricks? mine would fit in a matchbox :-/ : 3 and 1 . ... but i won?t send them anyway! :-p :-d

2 i've never been fond of these sets, but still buy them every year because my daughters like them. i am, however, looking forward to the belville advent calendar, which likely will have some parts that usually are quite hard to get in it. my girls will love it, and i love all the belville parts. http://shop.lego.com/product/?p=7600 if anyone has pics of what is contained in this set i would love to see them.

4 xwingyoda, on sep 13 2007, 06:57 pm, said: ohh tks for the news 8-? it really looks interesting, belville always have great parts in cool colours !! excellent indeed !! *yoda* wow, interesting! lego is really expanding with this advent calendar thing! watch, next year they'll have ones for specific themes, boy o boy, think about it, star wars advent calendar, indy advent claendar. of course, this is only speculation, but it would be cool! x-d i'll probably buy both of these (even though i'm a boy ;-) ) so i get 2 surprises every day instead of one! :-p ;-)

2 9.30 euro is msrp here in denmark. 7 euro would have resulted in a nicer reception from my part, but the strong marked position of lego in its homeland together with the general high prices (because some of us are supposedly rich...) makes the prices less bearable. it is funny you should mention germany. i thought the prices for lego were even higher there! i'm sure i paid more than msrp last time i bought lego from from your country. on the other hand. the last thing i bought was the 5521 model team sea jet from 1993!

0 i was going to buy one of these but decided not to. i am glad now seeing the rather annoying construction. the minifig is good though, thanks for the review! :-) batbrick away! >:-) edited by batbrick, 17 september 2007 - 07:29 am.

4 i have 2 of these guys. :-d it's awesome, only cost me 13 bucks nz, for a comparison, the castle crossbow attack set costs $10 nz. for the win! did i read this wrong? you paid about the same price as the republic cruiser??! the republic cruiser costs $200 nz, and the cyclone defencer costs $13. i must have read that wrong... *wacko*

4 i couldn't find a review of this wonderful set in here, so here it goes! i got the set for msrp (180kr = 24 euro) which is a fair price here in denmark. as all other creator sets there are instructions for several models (3 in this case). the box the box is a little larger than city sets in the same price range. the primary model is shown on the front while you see the secondary ones on the back. what you get 312 pieces in 5 polybags and two building instructions: one for the primary model and the other for the rest. the built it was impossible for me to speed build this model because of the nifty functional details from the retractable landing gear to the wings that can turn by means of the handle in the back of the model. it took me a full hour to build it because i had to "test" how it all works together. the finished model the landing gear isn't fully enclosed when retracted and the models are sub-minifig scale, but i still love the design of the models. the doors for the rear wheels open as you pull the wheels down and the final piece of functionality comes from the wings that can either tilt (the horizontal stabilizers) or have elevators. wing in, wings out, wings in, wings out... ratings as a whole i actually like this set even more than the big rig. the models are just as diverse but the added functionality makes the plane more fun to play with than the rig. price: 7/10 - a good price, but not a bargain as the big rig design: 9/10 - there could have been a sligtly higher level of details in the main model, but all models are really good looking and i especially like the design of the hovercraft. functionality: 10/10 - i guess you could ask for working rudders, opening cockpit and so on, but the plane is really filled with movable parts and the turning of the wings works really well. secondary models: 7/10 - a hovercraft! how awesome is that!? if only the last model was just as inventive instead of a standard helicopter... modifiability: 8/10 - the bricks are in ordinary colours and there is a good variety of them giving you plenty of possibilities for moc'ing. you can easily make the main model into something that looks more like an f-14. 9/10 probably as good as it gets for a creator set in this price range. it is entertaining to both build and play with, looks good and the secondary models are worth building as well! (brickshelf gallery)

4 thanks! i was planning on doing this review but i have been a bit swamped lately. :-$ great review of a great set. it isn't too hard to convert the plane to mini-fig size either. (sorry i forgot to take photos...) i might add some photos to your review....

4 nice review and a nice set. thanks for taking the time. i'll want to pick this guy up.

4 hovercraft alternate model. uses around 4/5th of the parts. it is cool but a bit fragile.

4 great review lasse d. a definite two *y* up. i bought this set for the swing-wing concept. i was very curious what tlc's design was like. i have been working on modifying it just a little to look more like the f-14. so far i have completed the back section, but i need to finish the cockpit. overall this is a great set. i *wub* tlc's swing-wing concept. model on!!

2 sinner, on sep 21 2007, 09:19 am, said: i agree. errr... sorry if i have annoyed you by posting the pictures. looking at your brickshelf folder you had taken photos of the hovercraft as well and i seem to have stepped on your toes. (i prefer bigger pictures as i get tired of clicking, waiting, clicking, waiting. if the pictures are all there all you have to do is click then wait! :-p ) you didn't step on my toes because i took the pictures after you posted them :-p i just wanted to add them for completeness. i can see the loading issue when you click a lot of pictures (i normally hold ctrl down so that they open in their own tabs... but they still have to load). any other opinions?

4 ?34.99 is not too shabby. the big guy itself is nice, but the gem of the set is the mech. really nice mech i must say! great for posing. the mini figs suprisingly nice little build/vehicle. never seen this element before....its probably nothing new though, lol. no articulation of the legs? nooooooo! phew! the front two legs do articulate. would of been bad if they didnt. overall, i give the set 7.8/10. not the best, but its actually quite nice, and the yellow mech is awesome. if it was him on his own, then 9.4/10! cheers

0 thanks for the review! i really dislike this set but i thought much worse of it when we saw the first pic. i think it was a good idea (mech transporter) pursued in a horribly wrong way! :-x thanks again! :-) batbrick away! >:-)

4 nice! *y* doesn't look that bad at all, but what's with the first pic? the one of skeleton tower? *wacko* is it so we can see the corner of the intructions? :-p edited by iamded, 30 september 2007 - 09:29 pm.

0 consider the first pic a freeby pic, to whet your appetite. :-$ 8-? :'-)

4 nice! i really want this now. the yellow mech was the thing i disliked on it, but now its my favourite part of it. -zots

4 that yellow mech would make a killer $10 set! i would buy it on its own... *wub*

2 does anyone have a box pic of this set? dp8

4 hahah, entertaining and informative, a great read- thanks for the review! on a side note i thought fant-four-stic was....ok. on the poorer side of ok. the exposition felt like it was from a 3 hour film because it was so long and towards the middle it started to drag. the ending was terrible. edited by mutant orc, 12 september 2015 - 09:53 pm.

4 this is my favourite set! should be making more spidey sets like this imo. *cough* oscorp tower *cough*

4 yeah. i'm really hoping the concept art/doom minifig joke is just that! i picked this set up on whim, mostly because a needed a building to add to a moc, as a parts pack it's not a bad set at all.

2 aegis2000, on 13 september 2015 - 02:32 am, said: this set is from 2013, doctor doom is completely based off the comic version/ tv show version, not the movie in any way. anyways, nice review. i personally own this set, and it's a nice set, but could have been better. he's just joking about doom.

2 i'm glad you were joking about doom. i'm not that big of a fanboy, but i had the need to correct you for some reason. with that said, i bought this set for the minifigures a few years ago. looking back, i don't really care about the figures today like i did in 2013. the building is decent for the size of the set though. thanks for the review.

2 overall, i wish marvel in particular would have more playsets in its theme (batman has several great ones in the dc theme). but then again, if this is the best playset to date for marvel, maybe it's better just to leave well enough alone. i would definitely like to see them attempt something in the $100+ (us) price range because i think it could be good; marvel needs an equivalent to the arkham asylum set. regarding this set, i saved myself some money and bought the 4 minifigs i needed (all but spidey) on bricklink for less than half the set price. edited by dmarvin, 17 september 2015 - 06:25 pm.

4 super-cool! any text on the boxes of these ones? the stormie's left arm seems really long and slightly odd, but that's just because i'm jealous you've got one. :-d shorter than i was expecting though. dr. s.

4 thanks copmike! dr. s.

2 the arms of the stormtrooper are a litle long i think.

4 great reviews mike these are great i cant wait until you review the next! around how much were these and where did you get them? bobskink, on sep 23 2007, 08:02 pm, said: the arms of the stormtrooper are a litle long i think. your right bob yet if they were not then the poor stormie would only be able to hold his blaster in one hand and not both. ;-)

4 good idea to make this review while you build the set. i'll be monitoring your progress and feedback. the box so huge! impressive!

4 excellent beginning. our numbers are very close, but i haven't the luxury of space to build it, so i'll be enjoying it by proxy through you. enjoy! *y*

2 wow that box is big but i somehow thought it would be even bigger, still it looks like for once lego are actully using all the space inside and not just a fraction like with other sets. cant wait to see more dunamis.....you lucky megablok ;-)

4 what a wonderful idea, and how nice from you.... *sweet* and.... go, killer, go!!

2 very expecting indeed. waiting for your kind photo ... :-)

2 xwingyoda, on sep 28 2007, 07:34 am, said: tks for that comparison pic dunamis ;-) ok the box is big !! i pictured it a tad smaller though !! *yoda* i don't have the ucs isd but from the pic i can see that it is about the same thickness, slightly shorter but much wider than the mf. so this leads me to believe that dimension-wise the ucs mf is more compact. also, notice how in the content, the parts fit in just nice without additional spare space for anything else. strange isn't it that when tlc is responsible for the shipping, we see optimum usage of box spaces. x-d imagine if all boxes were this efficient. $4.99 sets would be no bigger than a match box! x-d x-d the mtt would be reduced to 1/4 its current size! x-d x-d x-d

4 good review. *y* me, i can't build it before saturday. :'-(

4 great review so far! i am looking forward to additional posts! as for the number of pins - from the peeron inventory for the set, there are over 400 technic pins of various lengths! (insert the "my fingers hurt from building" emoticon) keep the pictures coming!

4 i have been taking photos for this review for a few months and i finally took the rest of the photos last night. all the parts. if you want tan, this is the set to get! main model. the garage is a great addition... ...but the car only just fits! the main house is very nice looking. the windows extend to the sides... ...but not the back. the chimney and drainage work very well, and i love the "basement". i think the front works very well. when i was making this i was multitasking doing weight training; do a set, do a step, do a set... and i ended up missing one of the row paths. i discovered this after i finished the basement. :-| the removable roof reveals byo floors. probably why this is called a model house! the roof was quite interesting to build. this is my first large house set so it all was very new to me. i love the garage door. more nice pipework. this photo i mis-focused but there isn't much to see anyway! the door is a nice touch. the grill to the right on both sides is not just decoration as it hides the hinges for the door. i also made one of the sub-models. i was considering keeping this but i decided against it. once again the sides have windows... but the back doesn't. the truck is there to make the photo more worthwhile! the roof to this one doesn't come off easily as all the tiles are used for the front. just to clarify; these houses aren't attached so you can arrange them however you want. the fronts are quite elaborate and it seems that lego were trying to make this almost like a simpler market street. the truck is too small for a minifig... ...but it probably was my favourite car. thoughts i highly recommend this set. in most countries it is good value for money, including australia. the design is excellent and three instructions are included. (the third is a school. if anyone has made it and wants to post photos feel free! at least one person at eb has made it.) i love how each house has its own car. due to the way the primary model is made it is a bit weak at the corner, but that was a design choice. my only real complaint about this set is how lego is going though a mould transition and thus some roof slopes are rough, others are smooth. i can accept either, and lego has been moving to smooth slopes for years now, but to have a set with about 50/50 is annoying. (the mtt was the same.) but that is my only gripe with this excellent set. *wub*

2 i found the use of parts well done by the designers. i made a car and then tried to make a house from a different instruction book. i could not as several pieces were already used in the car. nice to see them using all the parts like that rather than having a lot of "extra" bits. moral of the story: one instruction book at a time. *sweet*

2 lasse d, on sep 28 2007, 08:03 am, said: it sure is a great value compared to what you get in the building bonanzas (no cars and less detail). i was all for the white house until i saw this set. i still wouldn't mind it though. :-d lasse d, on sep 28 2007, 08:03 am, said: would it be hard to modify the cars to fit minifigs better? the problem with the blue truck is a lack of headroom. however the truck is quite low and i can't see it being too hard to change and still have it looking good. asuka, on sep 28 2007, 08:30 am, said: great for every city builder for sure. i guess we waited for sets like that. we dreamed about them. i?m glad we got them now. :'-) i think lego were really listening with this years creator sets. *wub* with the exception of the ferris wheel. they are all sets that you could buy 10 of and not have too many hard to use parts. asuka, on sep 28 2007, 08:30 am, said: edit: congrats! it seems you?ve got your bucket back.... :-p well, in this reality anyway! x-d who knows what goes on in the "wacker and walrus" world but i do seem to be a tormented soul. :'-(

4 thank you very much for the review sinner. i definitly *wub* this set. this will make a great addition for us "townies". i thought the size was too small. i plan to make my house fit practically the whole baseplate. plus i will definitly add floors, that looked :-d . i can't believe tlc skimped on the floors.

2 thanks for the thanks guys! *sweet* hinckley39, on sep 28 2007, 11:08 am, said: great job, now sort that out and start building for our competition! x-d i started building today! *sweet* matthewusa, on sep 28 2007, 03:56 pm, said: i can't believe tlc skimped on the floors. it didn't bother me as i downloaded the instructions prior to buying the set. i think it was a deliberate choice to make the house flashy looking but not very functional. due to the cool looking corners it isn't very strong either; while breaking it i was reminded of a zip! :-p simonwillems, on sep 28 2007, 06:53 pm, said: the only thing i dislike about this set is the way the windows are attached in train windows (so they turn inwards a little) instead of the usual frames with shutter-attachment-ability. these were my first windows like that and it surprised me. i wouldn't be surprised if lego are trying to phase out the old windows. holodoc, on sep 28 2007, 07:58 pm, said: thanks for the review sinner! *y* ... although we had a not very detailed one already... :-p i notice that, but since didn't show what the original set looked like i saw that more of a moc. 8-| holodoc, on sep 28 2007, 07:58 pm, said: you get tons of useful parts to build other buildings as well. [shameless self-promotion /off] ;-) i was actually considering adding a link to your moc anyway. thanks! :-p paul_delahaye, on sep 29 2007, 07:38 am, said: i too have bought this set and the only thing i notice which is a bit odd, with the exception of there being no floors in the house is the lack of a steering wheel in the car! once again, i think this is just a sign of all style, no substance! :-d paulc, on sep 29 2007, 05:19 pm, said: the mixed rough and smooth roof bricks would annoy me on a model like the mtt, but here it looks as is if the roof is quite old with some parts being worn and pitted and some parts being replaced with new roof tiles. i quite like the effect. fair point. what confuses me though is the (cg) cover has the rough ones shown... :-|

4 sinner. you have convinced me. i bought this set yesterday when it was on sale at international lego weekend in sk?rb?k.

2 hi, you've done well on the pictures! but i agree with freekysch; a little more text would be great. ever thought about joining the reviewer's academy?

4 i actually bought this set last monday as it was reduced to 14.99.....it actually not a bad little set considering the size and part count, has a decent array of functions. its a nice little set....the b model looks just as good so i might buy a second set, as you get the bucket left over and i need that bucket for another set. edited by richard dower, 19 october 2015 - 04:42 pm.

4 wow thanks for the review! 8-? i already have the other two set (theyre fantastic *wub* ) and i know ill be getting this one soon! dp8

4 that was a fun review, i picked up a couple of these on holiday in france and it was one of the main reasons i went all-out and bought the rest of the castle range! dr. s.

4 that's a superb review if i ever saw one, and another great story! *y* it's a good review even though i got the set 4 months ago. :-p this just reinforces my like for it. :-p

4 thanks for the review, the comic was great! :-d your alternate model is great as well, i would never have thought of building a ship out of a catapult! :-p

4 thanks everyone for all the comments! ;-) my next review is most likely going to be the toa mahri i bought a long time ago; i also typed up a review for her but haven't bothered posting it! ah well, i'll get it up eventually.... x-d edit: gah! i just realized how many posts i had! better post something else on the boards quickly.... :-p edited by grevious, 11 october 2007 - 08:45 pm.

4 ah yes, the good ol' catapult attack. nice review, and what a great comic, i loved it. *y* :-d you've inspired me, all i need now is a camera! :-p great job, keep up the good work, and i'm looking forward to more reviews! *y* ~peace edited by iamded, 12 october 2007 - 10:30 am.

4 it's that time of year again when the days get shorter, the nights get colder, and children all around the world stare longingly into warmly lit toy shops and prepare their wishlist to send to santa. this is also the time when the lego group releases their latest winter village set which has been an annual tradition for the past seven years. these sets have been very popular, especially among afols, and are always highly anticipated. however, while some entries in this series have been more popular than others, none has been as controversial as this year's set, the winter toy shop, which is a re-release of the first winter village set, 10199 winter toy shop from 2009. it seems that many think that this set didn't need to be remade and would have preferred a new set instead, or that it is not different enough from the original and will be redundant in a completionist's collection. does it deserve all the hate? let's find out. disclaimer: i don't own the 2009 version, so i can't compare them visually, but i will do my best to let you know what is different in this version. if you do need a visual reference, you can refer to svelte's excellent review of the original. set number: 10249 name: winter toy shop theme: creator year of release: 2015 pieces: 898 minifigs: 8 price: £59.99 / $79.99 / 69.99€ s@h description: quote welcome to the winter toy shop! the holiday season has arrived and the toymaker is busy finishing off his latest creations! outside, children ski and snowboard, and a freshly built snowman sparkles in the light that shines from the toyshop tower. help decorate the huge tree that stands at the center of the square, play with the curious kitten on the cozy wooden bench or join in with the carolers beneath the ornate streetlamp. this charming set also features a ladder, trees in various sizes, jack-in-the-box, a toy biplane, helicopter, rocket, train, race car, truck, robot, tugboat, teddy bear and a wrapped gift. have fun building this enchanting winter wonderland! includes a snowman and 8 minifigures with assorted accessories: a male caroler, female caroler, a woman, 2 men, 2 boys and a girl. s@h bricklink brickset the box the box art of this set is similar to that of the original, but there are some notable differences. the christmas tree is on the right side of the image this time while the park bench is on the left and of course it features this year's design for creator boxes with the dark blue stripe along the right side and the "expert" logo in the top right corner. there's also a small picture of the back of the toy shop and the background looks less cartoony than on the original. the back is also very similar, showing a different angle of the toy shop along with some close-ups, although this time there is no minifig lineup. instead, the minifig lineup is on the right side of the box. it also includes the accessories that each minifig comes with and some of the toys. on the left side of the box there is a thumbnail of the box art and the set name in six different languages. they also want to make sure that you know that there are batteries included by saying it in dozens of languages. the top of the box features the inventory and a 1:1 scale reference with the female caroler. on the bottom there is a picture that reminds you that there is a light brick included in this set, in case that wasn't clear from the front of the box, and it confirms that yes, it is a bad idea to put it in water, in case you were planning to go swimming with your winter toy shop. the contents inside the box there are two instruction booklets and two groups of bags, one for each instruction booklet. while two groups of bags is not as many as there usually are in other sets of this size, it's still better than the first version of this set where the bags weren't numbered at all, so this makes the build a bit easier. the large bag in group 1 and the two large bags in group 2 have a white stripe going down the middle of the bag and only have one group number printed on it along with some other number and some kind of scan code. i have no idea why they made this distinction for these bags or what that code is for, so if any of you know the purpose of this, please let me know in the comments below. here is a random instructions page. as you can see, the building steps can get quite challenging as they sometimes include many different pieces in one step, especially when it uses a lot of brown pieces which are very dark and hard to see in the instructions, living up to the set's status as an expert-level set. most of the time, though, the instructions are pretty clear and easy enough to follow. there are some parts in new colors in this set that weren't in the first version or any other set until now, such as that large, flat technic arch in dark green, the jester hat in orange and blue, one of those new 2z2 round jumper tiles in brown, a golden frog(!), and a snowboard in dark blue. there are also some rare friends parts that make their creator debut here such as the skis in azure and that new clear 1x1 round tile with a tiny tube coming out of it which is usually used as a stand for friends accessories and is a very useful piece, especially for snot techniques (and no, i'm not talking about the type of snot that many people usually have stuck in their nose around this time of year). there are some printed parts as well, such as the clock tile, the letter tile, and the register slope like in the first version of the set. we also get a new face print for the white cat which is more in line with other modern cat designs. but the best part is the shop sign which is printed this time around. it features a lovely wood pattern, the words "toy shop", and a toy soldier on both sides of the sign. which is ironic since the shop doesn't seem to sell any toy soldiers like this, but it looks so good on the sign that i won't sue them for false advertising. the minifigs let's start with the most unique figures in this set, the carolers. these two were also the highlight in the first version of the set, but in the original they both had the same head (this one -> ) which featured a very questionable facial expression that could easily be taken out of context. in this version, they have unique faces which look much better and help distinguish their gender. the male caroler uses lord vampyre's torso which looks quite snazzy on him. maybe this is lord vampyre before he became a vampire? the female caroler is easily the best minifig in the set, though, because in addition to her exclusive head, she also gets an exclusive torso and skirt print! a huge improvement over the generic unprinted one in the original. she also gets the queen hair in dark brown and aragorn's lined cape instead of two combined regular capes. this set truly is the return of the queen! the snowman is technically not a minifig, but as you can see here, he is exactly as tall as one and he is the first thing you build after the minifigs, so i included him here. he has mostly the same design as before, except this time he has robot claws for arms instead of levers. which is good since they allow him to hold accessories such as his broom. his carrot nose is included separately again. the carolers both have back printing while the snowman looks no different from the back than he does from the front. here you can see the black side of the female's cape. this lined cape is so much nicer than the solution they used in the original. next up we have what i assume is a married couple who are likely the parents of at least one of the kids, as well as the toymaker who i will call geppetto. the man in the pinstripe suit was not included in the first version of the set, so he's a bonus minifig! these guys are fairly generic, but they have some detailed torso prints, so they look pretty nice. geppetto seems to have gotten younger since the release of the original set since his gray hair has now turned dark tan and he doesn't seem to need glasses anymore. the men both have back printing, but the woman is the only one in this set who doesn't get a back print. why you gotta be so discriminating against women, lego?! last but not least, there are the kids. one of the boys wears dark blue pants, a green jacket, and a wool cap. he looks a bit like a lumberjack, so let's call him lumberjack boy, or jack for short. the little girl wears an outfit that wouldn't look out of place in the friends theme with a lavender scarf and pants. i'll call her lavender. the second boy is wearing an octan jacket and a sports helmet which makes it ironic that he is the one not doing any winter sports on the box art. i'll call him president business junior, or pbj for short. all of the kids have fairly detailed back printing which makes up for the fact that much like the adults, they are made out of mostly common parts. pbj's helmet and scarf cover up the back of his head nicely which is important as you will see in the next picture. what's also great about these figs is that half of them have a double-sided head. here you can see pbj doing his best macaulay culkin impression. i also removed his scarf so you can see the printing on his torso better. but he's not the only one who seems to be easily scared. the mother also has a very alarmed expression. maybe she got surprised by the jack-in-the-box or maybe she just realized how expensive toys are nowadays. you can see the female caroler's back printing here. her alternate expression is a non-singing face which is very nice to have and i wish the male caroler could have one too. she looks quite cute with those rosy cheeks. but the most adorable out of all of them has to be the little girl. she comes with a pouting sad face that will melt your heart. please, don't cry! i'll buy you any toy you want, just stop looking at me like that! the build the first half of the build is dedicated to the surroundings of the toy shop. it includes the christmas tree, the park bench, the snowman, the toys, the carolers, jack and lavender. the large bag contains two smaller bags with small pieces, a white box that contains the caroler's cape, and the jester hat in its own little bag. the first thing you build after the minifigs and the snowman is the toys. this version of the set has a lot more toys than the original which is good because i always felt that the first toy shop was a bit light on toys. also, the ones that were in the original have been updated. for example, instead of the two pairs of skis, you now get one pair of skis that use the new ski mold and a snowboard. the jack-in-the-box is mostly the same, except it now has an orange and blue color scheme instead of the red and blue from the original. this change was probably not necessary, but hey, at least we get a new jester hat out of it. and instead of the brick-built teddy bear you get the new teddy bear mold. i have mixed feelings about this change because i actually kinda liked the brick-built teddy design and using a specialized mold seems to be going against the spirit of creator sets, but on the other hand i can't deny that the molded teddy looks better than the blocky old one. meh. the new toys include a tugboat which has some rounded technic pieces as its hull, a biplane, a rocket, a helicopter, and a truck that cleverly uses roller skates for its wheels. these are all quite brilliant designs that feel like micro versions of lego city sets and make a great addition to the set. here is a back view of some of the more complex models. as you can see, the friends accessory stand has been cleverly used to hold the biplane's fin in place and to provide a stand for the helicopter. the jack-in-the-box has a hinged lid. the only thing that bugs me a bit is the t-piece on top of the helicopter that holds the rotor in place, but i can't think of any better way they could have done it. next is the ladder that is used to decorate the tree which is exactly the same as the first version. the supports are on a click-hinge, so they can be adjusted or folded away. then, you build the tree itself. you begins, of course, with the stand which is mostly the same design as before, but this time the plates at the bottom are brown instead of white and have golden studs as feet. next, you build the first layer of branches. the main difference in this version of the tree is that this one actually has a brown stem rather than just a technic axle on which you stack the layers of branches one by one. you wont be able to see the stem in the final result, but i like this change as it makes the tree more realistic. then you add the second layer of branches. this one doesn't have lights/candles and attaches to the lower layer at an angle using the four trans-yellow studs close to the stem. the third layer is added. this one has lights again. each layer is similar in that they are all made out of green plates that are built around a 4x4 ring plate, but they get smaller each time and are constructed differently enough for the build not to feel repetitive. with the addition of the fourth layer, we get close to finishing the tree. lastly, you add one more layer and the tip of the tree. now it's time to decorate the tree! however, it's not as fun as it sounds since that requires you to add lights to the two chains/ropes first which can get a bit repetitive. the clips holding the lights to the chain were white, but this time they're pearl gold which looks much nicer in my opinion. the next part of the build is the park bench with the streetlamp and the little tree. this is a fairly quick build with not much to it. the fishbowl helmet parts are a useful piece that you don't see too often, so it's nice to get them again in this remake. the design is pretty much the same as in the original set except for the wreaths on the streetlamp which use a green life preserver instead of a round 2x2 plate. this is another instance where they use a specialized piece instead of a brick-built solution, but i'm okay with that because unlike with the teddy bear, this part was not originally intended to be a wreath, so it's still nice part usage. the second half of the build is dedicated to the toy shop itself and includes the couple, geppetto, and pbj. please note that there is a fourth 6x10 plate burried under the parts. you begin by tiling the floor, setting up the walls, and adding the interior items such as the fireplace, the cash register, and the toy displays. next, you add the walls, windows, and the door and the ground floor of the shop is finished. so far, the build is the same as the old toy shop, except this time they decided to have the white stripes on the marquees be the longer ones instead of the dark red ones for some reason. i don't know why they did this and kinda would have preverred to get dark red 1x1 plates instead of white, but it doesn't detract from the look of the shop, so i don't really care. now we begin with the upper floor. this is where things start to look a little different. can you tell the difference? the difference is that this time they attach the roof using clip-hinges instead of bulky technic constructions which gives you more space on this floor and allows it to look more like an actual attic. they even tile the floor next to the frog clock. aftter adding the roof, the build is finished. the main roof feels a bit loose since it's only attached to the building by one side. i'm not sure if this was an issue in the old toy shop, but it's not a big deal. i just wouldn't pick the set up by the roof. what i do like is that they used double cheese slopes on the awning on the outer wall of the tower instead of singles which makes it a bit easier to build. i like how the supports under the tower roof now match those of the main roof. the wreaths have also been updated like the ones on the streetlamp. and those technic arches under the roof look a lot more like garlands now. on the original, they were dark gray, so i didn't even know they were supposed to be garlands and assumed they were part of the architecture. the shop sign looks a lot better now that it is printed. the old one just looked like a white flag. i also like how the small plates under the marquee give it a wavy look and they included two trees in different sizes on the right side of the shop. the back is nice and open and allows you to see the rest of the toys, the robot, train, and race car, all of which have just as much of a simple and clever design as the other toys. the clock looks much nicer with the new golden frog. because golden frogs make everything better. spare parts there are quite a few small parts left over, including a roller skate and one of those friends accessory stands which will come in handy. the complete set here you can see the full set together. it looks quite nice and festive with all the little details and there are many scenes that you can play out with it: you can have the minifigs decorate the tree, have the kids play in the snow, have the carolers sing by the bench, have the toymaker build some toys in his workshop, or have the parents buy presents for their kids. it's a festive, toy-filled winter wonderland! the fireplace looks cozy and i like the brick pattern going up the chimney. the entrance of the shop looks a bit empty aside from the cash register. i feel like they could have displayed some more toys here, but oh well. being a set targeted at teens and adults, there aren't really any play features aside from the light brick which is attached to a hinge, so you can either activate it by pressing the button with your finger or tilting the brick upward so that the button is pressed against the roof. however, since the roof is not connected in the middle and only attached on the sides, it tends to split open a bit when you do that, so i'm not sure if attaching the roof this way here was such a good idea. nevertheless, it looks quite nice when the light is lit. ratings design: 5/5 - this set is as gorgeous as it was back in 2009! the small updates that they made are mostly good ones, although the absence of a brick-built teddy is a bit disappointing and the new way the roof is attached, while not as bulky as before, makes the roof slightly unstable, but those are just nitpicks. build: 5/5 - there are some interesting building techniques here, such as those on the tree, the roof, and the toys. the fact that the parts are only split into two groups and the part callouts can get fairly complex makes it a challenging, enjoyable build. minifigs: 5/5 - they did a great job updating the figs in this set. while only 3 of the torsos in the original had any printing, all of the torsos have printing front and back in this set, even the skirt and cape of the female caroler. you get two exclusive heads and half of the heads are double-sided, plus you get 8 instead of 7 minifigs. you really can't ask for more in a creator set. playability: 4/5 - this set is more meant to be displayed than to be played with, but there are plenty of things to play with if you want. all the different minifigs, accessories, and set pieces make for endless possibilities for play. it's especially fun to swoosh the micro vehicles around. parts: 3/5 - there are lots of good parts here. most of them are fairly common, but there are some rare parts and some even in exclusive colors. price: 4/5 - this set costs $20 more than the original, but considering that this set has nearly 900 pieces, including some rare and exclusive ones, as well as more minifigs with much better printing, i think $80 is still a fair price. overall: 5/5 - so what's my opinion of this set? for a remake, i think it's great. they managed to make a good set even better. are the changes minor? yes. are they an improvement? mostly, yes. were they necessary? perhaps not, but it's good that they made them instead of just re-releasing the exact same set. so if you didn't get the first winter toy shop, i can highly recommend getting this one. if you do already have the old version, this one might still be worth picking up for the hugely improved minifigs and rare parts alone. as for the controversy over re-releasing the winter toy shop, i can see where the haters are coming from, but i find their complaints to be quite petty. i can understand if you're disappointed because you already have the first winter toy shop and were looking forward to a new set this year, but there's always next year. if you're a completist and feel like tlg is forcing you to buy a set you don't need, you're wrong. nobody is forcing you to buy anything but yourself. if you decide to buy every set in a theme no matter what it is, that's your problem, not lego's. so put down your torches and pitchforks and just be glad that they improved the set design and gave us another chance to buy this classic set. there are far worse things that can happen in this world than lego re-releasing one of their most popular sets. sorry for that little rant. so what is your opinion on re-releases like this? please cast your vote in the poll above. i hope you enjoyed this special eurobricks reviewers academy review and would like to thank the lego group for the opportunity to review this set. happy holidays everyone!

4 thanks for a great review first of all. i do like the upgrades and changes made from the original 2009 set, more colours and parts are offcourse available today than back in 2009. it does look like a great set and i would really realy have loved to get it myself if i had the funds. however their are so many other sets thats first priority for me this december and next year, so sadly i might have to pass on this if its not that i can get it redicioulusly cheap at some point. and yeah, we should appreciate that lego does keep sets coming, even if its just upgrades from earlier releases. town is known for a new police and fire station every year, cant see why a new toyshop is so upsetting. once again thanks for a great review. and happy holidays to you as well.

4 nice to see they finally updated that generic screaming face from the 2007 castle line. awesome review, oky. i have the old set so i won't be picking this up.

2 hobbythom, on 29 november 2015 - 04:07 pm, said: great review. you almost make me want to buy one. i don't know what it is with these sets. on the one hand they are so nicely designed and cute on the other side i never seriously consider buying one. i can't explain what it is that holds me back. a lack of money, maybe? that's the thing that usually holds me back. anyway, i have the older version, so i am not interested in this set.

2 great review, thanks oky! imo, the only significant improvements over the 2009 version are the figures, toys, and printed shop sign. as i already have the older one i'll have to give this one a pass.

0 thanks for the excellent review! unfortunately it only highlights how minimal the upgrades are (though they are nice). definitively a pass for me. let's hope lego does continue to make the more realistic winter village sets (versus santa). i'm not opposed to a rehash, the post office could use some improvements for example, but this one is just a wee bit minimal.

2 thanks for the review. they definitely improved upon the original, but since i already own the original, i can't justify this set also, unfortunately. it seems to be the trend. but i'm sure there are a lot of first timers out there too that will snatch this up since it is a really lovely building. and the updates make it better for sure.

2 thanks oky for this fine review. i agreed with your sentiments on the unnecessary rants. i also owned the 2009 version and even though there are minor improvements. there must be a logical reason for its release again but is not entirely the same. i felt is an excellent opportunity for others to acquire this design especially after six years ago. as for myself, i will probably buy this if my spare funds allow me to own this set.

2 oky, on 02 december 2015 - 12:49 am, said: i'm not mocking anyone. i just think that some people need to calm down a bit and that tlg is getting more hate than they deserve for this set, but that's just my opinion and you're welcome to disagree with it. everyone is entitled to their own opinion, including you and me. and yes, i would love to hear your thoughts on this matter because i would like to have a friendly discussion on this subject. that's cool, and i appreciate that. but, i would recommend avoiding the use of the word "hater" then. that's a perjorative term that's loaded with negative connotation, as i'm sure you're well aware. it's the flipside to me calling you a "mindless fanboy" or a "corporate shill." those aren't terms that invite friendly discussion. they shut down discussion by belitting the other person's opinion, and implying that they lack the maturity or intelligence to think critically. i don't actually care all that much about this set. you just hit on a pet peeve of mine, is all. and it's one that i see spreading throughout eurobricks, which is a shame. the use of terms like "hater," "whiner," or "fanboy" are becoming much too prevalent around here.

4 nice review, even with the missing demonstration video of the a-model! looks like this is an excellent panel pack for the price, and those soft axles will go down a treat. will this set be the dark horse of 1h 2016...?

4 my favourite of the 2016 sets i've built so far. i'd go so far as to say this is the best "budget" set in years. i would have loved this when i was a kid ... great "swoosh ability" ??

4 thats a cool little mod, two small nigles though, 1, your navigation lights are flipped on the main wings, 2, the panels on the tail i *think* were supposed to be the intakes for the jet engine, by using them to close up the tail you've turned it into a glider cant wait untill i find one of these on shelves!

4 i almost purchased this today because i like the wheel / disc combo so much.

2 jim, on 01 december 2015 - 09:34 am, said: you are right. i came to the same conclusion when writing the review. i tell you it doesn't look that good without stickers, but i don't have a picture to prove it. to be honest; i compared it to the model posted in the 2016 topic a few days ago. i applied the stickers before building the model, so i wasn't able to make a proper comparison. i will keep it in mind for future reviews. thanks for the suggestion. you're welcome! i'm not a huge fan of stickers, for 2 reasons: i do re-use all the parts normally...and also i believe a model should look great even without stickers, then obviously they can be a plus, but only afterwords! anyway i'm enjoying the reviews as usual, and those pics thanks for making them jim!!

2 jim, on 01 december 2015 - 04:10 pm, said: that's the best compliment a reviewer can get i thought that was the best compliment a salesman can get . seriously though, even though i am not quite sold on the helicopter your reviews are very well done. you put a positive light on it whilst still being completely honest.

4 lego 42049 mine loader thanks to lego and eurobricks for making this review possible! this was supposed to be a preview-review, before the dec 1 release date for the set, but it got stuck in customs or something and didn't arrive in time. well, i'd rather do a good, late review than a rushed review, so here it is. name: mine loader set number: 42049 pieces: 476 (i think) price: $39.99 (i think) minifigs: 0 theme: technic year of release: 2016 links: bricklink brickset the box another standard technic box, not that there's anything wrong with that. it is a littler weird that the mine loader is shown outside the mine, but whatever. the back of the box again, very standard. it's oddly technical, showing the exact angle of the machine when turning, but that's the sort of nerdy detail that technic people like. the alternate mine cutting machine model looks interesting and unusual as well. the 1:1 part the 1:1 part on the top of the box is especially helpful with this set. these mining machines are very oddly proportioned, since they need to fit in mine tunnels, so it's hard to judge the model size based on the wheels or seat like you can an ordinary set. the contents you get manuals for both models (a single book for the b and two books for the main), a medium size sticker sheet, 4 bags, and 4 loose tires. the special parts this set has 4 of the new mudguard panels in yellow, two cylinder halves in red (a new color), some of the new color red and yellow axles, a couple of the new-ish technic spacers, some of the axle-pin combination pieces, and a couple swords! i'm pretty sure that's "an antenna" and a spare. the start of the b-model since i like the main model better, i'm building the alternate first, so that's how i'll write the review. there's "power" for something (probably the engine) being taken off the one axle here. overall, a pretty standard technic frame beginning with some structural beams, a frame, and using liftarms to support axles out to the sides. more of the frame the far end of the model has some obvious steering mechanism being formed, as well as a pivoting arm right in the center that's probably the connection from the hand of god knob. the steering yup. called it. oddly, there is a different turning radius between right and left right now. i wonder if that'll get fixed... more mechanisms that's looking more technic now. sad to see a u-joint being used just as a fixed straight connection like that, but it is the alternate model... the engine block because all engines should be enclosed in a red cylindrical housing, am i right? the chassis it's definitely coming together now. and yes, the b-model instructions tell you to put the stickers on. it doesn't matter whether you build the main or alternate first, you'll get the stickers on (almost - there were a couple leftover that didn't get used in the b-model). almost done with the rest of the body done and the wheels on, you really get the scale of this machine. that blue seat is tiny compared to the rest of it! and yes, the uneven steering lock got fixed. after putting the wheels on, you add a couple of "pin with ball" pieces to the underside to restrict the steering. they didn't do that at first so that you could turn the axles sharper while putting the wheels on, which made it easier to do. the grinder keeping in mind the scale of the machine, this thing looks terrifying! the tan gear at the back drives the spinning blade up front. the red bushes near the turntable let you adjust the angle. all done the arm quickly attaches to the body and it's done. sadly, that tan gear doesn't connect to anything - it's just a knob so you can spin the blade by hand. raise your hand, if you're sure... (i think i'm dating myself with that title...) this thing has massive reach. i'm imagining this inside a mine, grinding away the rock overhead. pretty viciously effective machine! the crank on this side of the model is used to raise and lower the arm. works well, and the grey spacer makes it nice to use since it spins freely. the leftovers not much left for a b-model. nice usage! starting the main model the main model starts similarly to the alternate, with a frame, some axles, and a drive connection from one axle to something later. getting complicated already we're only a few pieces in and we already have three separate gear trains going on. there's the axle driving the tan beveled gears inside the frame at the bottom. there's more tan gears in the middle, and there's also a black gear sticking up as a knob that turns the grey connector in the center. the body is done i skipped ahead quite a bit, but it was a bunch of standard technic building. you've got a fake engine with fan at the back, driven by one of the rear wheels, a knob sticking up for steering, and an axle coming forward to open and close the claw. the claw! i like that they used a link system to open and close the claw instead of just gearing it. the axle comes forward from the chassis (it's the red axle) with a couple u-joints for flexibility and drives a worm gear. that rotates a gear below with a 2 stud liftarm on each side. those arms have pin with towball in them and then a link going from that short liftarm to the claw. it's a small rotation of the liftarm, but makes the claw open widely and works very well. raising the claw a few black liftarms join the claw to the body of the loader and allow it to move up and down. it's a simple mechanism there - one yellow beam goes back and connects to a lever that lets you raise and lower the claw. when raised (as shown), the lever locks in place by going just slightly past the centerline. and it's done add some wheels, a cab, and some wheel arches and we're done. it's a great looking machine, pretty unique, and looks like the real thing. the main difference from reality is these usually have a scoop for moving loose rock. since we've had so many scooping vehicles in the past (tracked loaders, the volvo l350f, excavators, etc) the claw here is a fun change and adds to the playability for kids. like the real thing, the body stays very low so the cab only has to stick up a little bit for the driver to see all around, because mines are cramped and busy areas. from the rear this angle is great. i love the use of the new mudguard panels to make a nice curve to the back of the loader. the antenna is a little weird, but perhaps they had a big pile of flat silver fencing swords to use up. the black gear just to the left of the antenna is the claw control. rotating that gear opens and closes it. the back end is a little lighter than a real machine would be, but lego wanted to leave the engine exposed so you can see the cylinders moving. the conclusion so, what's my conclusion on this model? i like it a lot. it's simpler than a big set would be, but it's got lots of design and playability crammed in a mid-sized set. it's a unique vehicle. however, it does have a few flaws. the steering on the main model needs some drag added. as is, you basically have to drive by holding the steering knob since it'll bend if you push it from behind. i don't like the use of pin with pin hole as mounting points for the orange and red trans plates for lights, since they can turn slightly and be at weird angles. the antenna is unnecessary and in the way. but none of these flaws are dealbreakers or even big deals. they're minor. the ratings value: 10/10 - less than 10 cents a piece, lots of useful liftarms and such, nothing too weird or single-use. design: 9/10 - looks very realistic for the size of the set, good functionality, not too dependent on stickers minifigs: n/a - n/a playability: 9/10 - controls aren't perfect (loose steering, small knob for claw control) but very functional and cleverly done. parts: 9/10 - nice selection, although heavy on the standard yellow and black. almost zero studded parts. overall: 9.5/10 - it's a great intro to technic set - a unique vehicle, good functionality, nice part selection, and decently priced. i like it a lot and plan to keep it around as a finished set.

0 i was waiting especially for review of this set. let me add few things about this... thing. it all will be complainging of person who works with these type of machines, so if you just want a unusual machine in your collection, ignore my complaining :) i see underground loaders almost every day, and believe me, this model would now work in the underground mine. first of all, its cab should stick out more from the frame. each loader has cab placed out of the chassis, to provide better view for the driver. in this class of machine it would help a bit, but in low loader ones it is extremely important: this is the view from the cab of a low profile loader (looking at front - and yes, front of the machine is where engine is placed, because at least at kghm all machines drive engine forward): another thing about that cab is that seat and steering wheel/joysticks are placed perpendicularly to the machine chassis, to provide same view for driving forward and backwards. so another weak spot of the set. the model lacks of trans clear lights on the engine part, because all machines that work underground have same lamps on front and back. another thing that comes to my mind is that warning light and antena would not live too long in the mine, becuase it could be torn apart by ramming into tunnels roofs. it does resemble shape of underground machine, but not a loader. only machine that comes to my mind is something that are used for moving/placing hydraulic support jacks in tunnels. sorry for poor quality, i didn't find better picture of it: it does have claw, four wheels and articulated chassis, but have much greater range of movement of the arm. anyway, i'd give it at least 3/5 for overall look. model itself, as a set, looks unfinished (or cut down on pieces after visit of an accountant...) for me it looks like engine part was built differently, with knobs for steering/claw operating sticking out from back. claw needs almost seven full turns of the worm gear to close from opened position, and is rather annoing to use it in way it is built in this model. bracket that holds bevel gears responsible for steering is rather loose, being hold in place by single 3/4 pin. on the other hand, the steering works very well. it seems that lack of differential will be more common in lego sets, becuase it is another model that have fake engine driven by single wheel (like in old russian rc cars...). i am ok with that, but it is a pitty that this model has only r2 engine. thing that i do not like the most in this model is how the claw arm works. first of all, it barelly lifts the claw of the ground, the movement could be much better. and it has major design flaw - universal joints are not placed in line with articulation points, and this is main reason of 5l axle not being suported on both sides under the turntable. while rainsing the arm, it bends a little! i really would like to see this model built differently, with normal bucket and better range of movement. edited by m_longer, 05 december 2015 - 11:08 pm.

4 excellent review! worth waiting for. the set itself is very interesting. looks like it may have one interesting build techniques. thanks for the review, andy ad

2 great review, thank you. the set to me is kinda blah, interested more in the new panels than the rest of it.

0 great review and great pictures ! many thanks for talking the time to review this set . i am a fan of lego technic construction stuff, but this set is not so appealing to me. but, then again i am sure some people will love it.

2 great review indeed!

2 looks like its using the z60 turntable that's on the mercedes and the crawler crane 42042

0 cool mod by effe. but the original model out of the box is one of the poorest models tlg ever released. looks from front to rear as a cheaped out set with really lazy design effort. a shame for the responsible lego designer parts assortment seems to be ok but this should not be the most important criteria sry jim, i really appreciate your always very well done reviews and offen i agree with the overall judgements/verdicts and of course tastes are different but especially that review sounds like gushing praise in my ears.... just my 2 ct edit: ooops just saw the review isn't done by jim...<blush>... so sry jim... now my final comment belongs to mostlytechnic edited by kumbbl, 27 december 2015 - 07:33 am.

4 again, great review with superb pictures. the white and blue certainly works very well with your dark backdrop. thorough review for such a small model. small in size but great as a set. tell me, why did i let you review this one?!

0 thanks for a great review! too bad there is only one blue curved panel in this set. my opinion on the frictionless axlepins is that the flex axle might be easier to stick in them than in regular/blue axlepins... didn't actually try it though :-) edited by majklspajkl, 05 december 2015 - 11:46 pm.

4 here is a video review via jang to add to the review: i like both a and b so will buy both.

4 i was supposed to publish it together with the 42039 - 24 hours racer, but it somehow got backlogged. after completing the reviews for the 2016 sets, i felt i needed to finish it (was already 90% done). that c-model looks cool!

4 great review. i bought this model several weeks ago and the box has sat on my shelf, so i think after this i will be digging it out for christmas and i expect my son will have a lot of fun with it when it's built. ps. these tumbler tyres look amazing on this model, and indeed amazing in their own right!

2 i could be wrong but i am 100% sure that i've seen this review before.

4 another great review i like this set very much, both models look good to me and it's a great part pack for me, the long list in the "high light parts" session tells everything. as for the real world counter part of the a model, how about this: try googling sno-cat and there a lots of such things.

2 lets not forget the c-model made by buster haus. pretty sweet c model..... http://www.eurobrick...opic=106969&hl=

2 nequmodiva, on 14 december 2015 - 09:48 pm, said: you switched the sides for the panel with the unsymmetrical sticker. otherwise you would see that the cut off part is where there's a beam in front of the panel. that's probably done because the beam could possibly damage the sticker, either while building or while placed against it for a long time. or it's simply omitted because it wouldn't be (completely) visible this is probably the only reason (for tlg choosing to provide an asymmetrical sticker), but looking at the sticker sheet, i also believe they simply didn't have the space on the sheet for a symmetrical solution. a symmetrically stickered panel could have more (re)uses for the moc'ers. on lego's own b-model, they handily camouflage it with the exhausts

4 you wrote a very accurate review of this set, jim. it's a pretty good model (with some obvious problems) but it's an even better parts pack. your pictures with the tumbler tires are great. what is the material of the gray background? nerdsforprez, on 15 december 2015 - 01:26 pm, said: lets not forget the c-model made by buster haus. pretty sweet c model..... thank you for the mention.

2 sad, i miss this set.

4 looks like you are late 2 years) nice set that you can play on your working place while small pauses this set is very cool, especially when you can: 42001 chassis + imagination = http://www.bricksafe...es/rm8/tlc_fj40 edited by rm8, 14 december 2015 - 11:17 am.

2 mister phes, on oct 20 2007, 12:38 am, said: you've done a good job of this review mr imperialscouts! but two things. 1) background far too bright and the set is far too dark, easily rectified with brightness & contrast adjustment. 2) no poll to rate the set out of 5. nonetheless this should be frontpaged on classic-pirates.com! alas, i cannot make polls in the pirate forum, so a generous moderator/admin would be so kind to add one. nonetheless, the picture was fixed, and appears to be alright. but i'm glad that the review is enjoyed!

2 huzzah! ...and title change as well...the best conquistador out there! :-$

2 the poll doesn't allow you to select 2 from 1-5. it instead says 1, 3, 3, 4, 5. but besides that, your review i give it a 5 because 1) shows the set in all angles 2) shows the characters 3) comment on the little creature comforts of the set 4) added a comic (playability) 5) showed true enthusiasm *y* *wub*

4 great review, cool comic. *wub* i give the set a four, and i will go and buy it now as i am missing many of those parts.... oh it's not for sale? off to bricklink then! :-d

0 well i only know the european price: 89.99 euros i think that's quiet expensive against the 2005 police station (7237): 74.99 euros - rupeeclock

4 klaus-dieter, on nov 23 2007, 11:34 pm, said: thank you very much for the review, the-force! the new police station looks great! i really like its lovely interior - amazing! by the way: i have a question: are there any beds, tables or/and seats for the prisoners in their cells? i just saw a toilet bowl in the prison cell from one of the box pics. well, from the last police station.. there should be a bed inside the cell. there are graffiti on the walls inside the cell too.. haha.. cute. :-$

4 it's mine *wub*! just got my luke today from tru in in merrilville, in... ;-)! so here's some pictures and thoughts: still in the packing with the box pieces out in the fresh air put together, ready for some serious vader vacking >:-)! if you this close you're so dead!! it's yet another lovely maquette *wub*! the only downside is that the lego sw sign doesn't even resemble (ok, i've exagurating a bit :'-)) the ones from the other maquettes! check out this one from the blackhole trooper compared with the luke one: the luke one is has a massproduced look over it with just a printing |-/ , the other has depth & a painting on it. now i'm waiting for the long overdue boba one! here's the other maquettes reviewed: darth vader & stormie blackhole stormie maquettes on copmike

2 excellent review copmike! i feel as if i've actually seen the maquette up close in real life. x-d i swear i've even touched it. tack for sharing min kompis! *sweet*

4 beautiful...i'm really trying to resist these. any word on who's next after boba fett? a c-3po/r2-d2 pair would probably push me over the edge.

4 finally, the highly anticipated luke skywalker maquette! i'm still looking forward to that boba!

4 thanks to this information. it's interesting for me. :-)

0 wow i went to my local toysrus and apparently they had some there dont really like them but there neat:)

2 is there also a boba fett maquette?? if y please a pic??!!? thanks!

2 if you have other heads and other lightsaber blades, yes :)

4 that head might have been from rock raiders. lovely set, and a good review. jifel

2 hmm, not actually a bad set. not high on my 'to buy' list, there're other things up there first, but definitely a possibility somewhere down the line. thanks for the review.

0 great review, but am i the only one who thinks this is a pretty homely looking vehicle? the small exploration robot is cool, but the large windscreen on the main vehicle reminds me about jack stone! i also think the bases of the vehicle parts are very basic and look almost unfinished with the holes and such. i think i will pass this one, even though the alien has a jet pack and there is the nice mini vehicle.

0 ah, thanks so much again, mr. m! this set looks great! i probably won't get this though. i hat mm as far as it goes. i agree with xwingyoda on this one. does the minibots wheels move? edited by ~vbbn~, 26 november 2007 - 10:34 pm.

0 xwingyoda, on nov 26 2007, 09:25 pm, said: i see it as a really cheap excuse to try and please classic space fan with that horrendous mm graphics and what amazes me is that you guys loke that :-d *yoda* i guess you?re right but i just can?t help by looking at these pics there?s still a very satisfying smile of nostalgia on my face.... x-d

0 excuse me?! a mass of technic parts? wow, you better lock your doors tonight....

4 mr. mandalorian, on nov 26 2007, 05:20 pm, said: come on, you have to admit that a jelly with a jetpack is funny. pathetically so, any way. i might make a vig of this, involving a brick wall and plenty of trans-green peices. x-d :-d hilarious actually.......however its imapled to it, so i guess its a suicide mission :-d piranha

4 cool review. i'm actually liking that new missile part as it seems to combine a bar with a pin. but it's a real eyesore if you ask me.

4 very cool review, mr. mandalorian! this isn't a bad set, the alien craft is very sleek (if only they'd gone with the old alien body in trans-green...) and the transforming is alright. the tank mode looks sweet. *sweet* ~peace

2 after seeing this set review it change my mind about this set. by the way thanks for the great review.

4 thanks for a very thorough review. i might think about getting this. i really like the mini alien fighter, and the transformation idea is always a welcome one. both modes look pretty good, despite the some of the odd coloured bricks (which i'd mod out). you know what it reminds me of? some of the futuristic designs in the gerry anderson series.

4 wow. this is actually quite a neat set! it is definitively my favorite in the line after the big drilling unit! \begin{geek} i'm not sure it would nose dive when transforming from tank mode. i guess it would pick up speed and transform quickly since it doesn't seem to have any downwards pointing thrusters. \end{geek}

2 lasse d, on nov 26 2007, 04:54 pm, said: i'm not sure it would nose dive when transforming from tank mode. i guess it would pick up speed and transform quickly since it doesn't seem to have any downwards pointing thrusters. the one thing you'd have to make sure of, though, is that it was fairly light and the wheel base had a fairly large surface area (actually, that's two things), so as to make sure it didn't dig into the soil. if that happened, transformation would be harder as the wheels would dig into the ground and drag through the soil. then it'd nose dive.

4 great review, mr. m! *y* i *wub* those green flames, and the design of the ship is pretty good. thanks for the review, and great pictures! they are clear. big, and describe the set just the way they should.

2 mr. mandalorian, on nov 26 2007, 01:29 pm, said: i see you know imperialshadows. :'-( ;-) maybe x-d ;-)

0 mr. mandalorian, on nov 26 2007, 05:45 am, said: the wing. for some reason, the body of the "mechanism" has a blue brick. *wacko* i think blue must be a cheaper color for lego... steve

4 konas2002, on nov 26 2007, 05:21 pm, said: i really like the transforming aspect of this! the one thing i wish mm sets would include would be baseplates. i liked that about the classic space stuff because it really helped create the environment. some "red rock orange" mars baseplates would be great! that?s a really fine idea and would for sure be very cool.... *y*

2 so hinckley, can you give us a hint on what our walrus friend will do with the dark panther? i can't wait to see. 8-|

4 thanks for that very neat review, hinckley! *y* this set looks indeed very interesting, with a very cool antlike look and a simple but essential overall design. the cockpit seems better protected than many other ef ones, that spine?s lovely and the way these iron drones?re attached is simple but effective. :-) and hey, did i miss something or?re there really no crappy shooting devices...? :-p thanks to the minirobots and their inventor i guess.... :'-)

2 great review! *y* i am sure to get this set for parts now. his legs dont look very poseable... :-/ thanks hinck! ~vbbn~

2 thanks everyone! i'm glad you are enjoying the review. i'm working on the 8118 right now and will have comics up for both starting tonight. hayatoson, on nov 27 2007, 04:02 am, said: awesome reveiw thanks for the pics!! did the instructions come with a comic? the instructions do not have a comic, but i always write one for my reviews featuring my sig-fig or other fabuland creatures interacting with the new set...

2 kmoi, on nov 27 2007, 11:12 pm, said: don't forget bianca and gavin, o' lordship of pies! :-d truly another excellent review! the pictures are absolutely splendid, as usual! i'm really glad those air-vent pieces were done so well. while i remain skeptical about the new giant spikes, you've sold me on this set! i can't wait to see the fabuland comic and your final verdict, hink! me too!!! ;-)

2 i too got an error message when clicking on the images, but the text links work correctly 8-| i wonder which way gavin will meet his death this time :-d luxorv

4 another great review, hink! looks like a great set. quote the cockpit isn't sealed and is actually aggravatingly unrealistic as it leaves the drivers chest vulnerable to enemy fire. actually the cockpit lacks any controls as seen here where it looks like keiken is simply pounding a counter demanding food. :-d "gimme food! or else my friend up there willl shoot your punk- @$$ into mars!" well, i guess that explains why there are no robot snipers in ef. if there were, well.... wouldn't be much of a story, would there? x-d

4 thank you for the glimps at the new set hinckley *y* . i saw this set today at my local tru store. the new slope 1x2 pieces look very *sweet* . i definitly see great potential for these pieces on locomotives. i hope these are going to be bountiful in the 2008 lines. model on!!

4 hinckley, on nov 28 2007, 06:48 am, said: cool! but my reviews are not meant to sway anyone. they should just inform people further as if they want to buy it or not. i am not necessarily for encouraging anyone to buy every set i review. :-d but i'm glad you liked it. thank you. oh i know but without the info i definately wouldnt buy it, now i'm considering it. hinckley, on nov 28 2007, 06:48 am, said: and actually i did feel the same way you did about the flying module, until i put sinner in it and started to play. here's a sneak peek of the comic and a cool feature of ryo's ship-it can be configured in a lot of different ways: x-o ........................................ sinner fits in there. well, i'm sold. x-d

4 crap! >:-( now i have to spend all my money on this! *wub* *wub* and whats the code? oh well, awesome set, and judt curios, didnt the reviewers used to be bianca and gavin? jifel

4 thanks for that neat review of a very nice set. the color scheme?s great and that minirobot looks very comical and funny indeed, sweet! *sweet*

4 hinkley, you are the man! your reviews just keep on getting better and better! although all of the sets this year are great and i love them all to bits, i can't say there was one that i absolutely felt like something i'd buy except for the storm lasher. but with this review, i think this will be the first purchase of 2008 for me! i totally agree with you on how the spider looks better without mini-robot. but from looking at where the cockpit is placed and how the skull on the cockpit is lodged underneath the walker, maybe the mini-robot would look better mounted underneath the head? that way it looks more even and even gives the thing a nasty set of teeth! i gotta try it out once i get it. can't wait for the fabuland comics! keep it up, hink!

2 hinckley, on dec 6 2007, 04:56 am, said: honckly? wow, dude. :-/ well, at least you got the c and the k. of course, the e is missing. it's all right though. eight letter words can be challenging :-p that's always the case for me. although, i have the assault tiger and will start on it next. on the box it looks like it is wearing huge bell bottoms. :-d i want to get the chameleon hunter, i really like the look of it and forgot to pick it up. guess i'll have to go back to tru! :-$ cross your fingers that i find more indy sets! x-d i'll just stick to calling you hink *y* (less letters :-d )

0 exo-builder59, on dec 6 2007, 01:30 am, said: are you talking about the dwarves mine? *sweet* yes, when in 2008 do these sets come to germany? :-/

4 oh, i just *wub* theat mini-bot. creepy, but strangely cute... nice piece selection, and the idea of something with rotors that double up as cutters storming (no pun intended) through the jungle ripping it apart is just fantastic (to me, anyway). i'm liking the new swords as rotors blades, that's pretty innovative, and the exhaust pipe pieces are intriguing.

4 thanks for the review, hinckley! i like the set it looks good, and all those ork swords..... *wub*

4 thanks for that nice review, it?s a 5 for me.... just a great little blue coats set, perfect for army and fortress building. *sweet*

4 i remember buying this set and thinking what an amazing job lego had done. it was my first pirate set and i still have it built. *sweet*

4 thank you for the comments! *sweet* i wonder who voted "1", surely such a nice set doesn't deserve such a low score!? *wacko*

4 it's not a bad thing to vote sabre island 1 if someone feels that it's genuinely worth 1 but t'would be interesting to know why.

4 i gave this one a 5. it's one of the little pirate sets i had during my youth and i loved it for several reasons. first of all, it contains 2 of my favorite minifigs! it can be used as a small independent base or in combination with one of the bigger sets (eldorado or trading posts) as a lookup or outer defense. besides all that, this set just looks beautiful. i love the colors (blue baseplate and the white/yellow tower). one of the best little/medium sized sets ever made by lego!

2 remind us what aberbrick is mr radar... or better still give us a link and give your moc plug x-d

2 bonaparte, on dec 8 2007, 09:40 pm, said: i gave this one a 5. *snip* it can be used as a small independent base or in combination with one of the bigger sets (eldorado or trading posts) as a lookup or outer defense.*snip* i hope that when i got eldorado fortress for christmas (the one i got for ?25) i can somehow combine the two to make a single larger base. i will post pics of the results one day if all goes to plan.

2 lord of pies, on dec 6 2007, 07:24 pm, said: the top of the tower is rather plain and simple which in some ways is good, as it keeps the whole set detailed yet not crowded, but i feel a little something should of been added to the top though. perhaps a catapult? steve

2 col. whipstick, on jan 3 2008, 12:37 am, said: did i hear right? a catapult in the 16th/17th/18th and 19th centuries? *wacko* perhaps it's an appeal for lord of pies to have his own personal catapult to pelt the pirates with whipped cream pastries should they try to sail past. but this begs the question... why waste perfectly good pie on those scurvy, mangy, mutt-faced villians! what a wonderful idea.... :-p a pie catapult! although it is a waste of a pie....we have ourselves a dilemma!

4 i liked the set, but it could have done more, plus the strange price of 15.50 just seems odd. must be the modern pricing systems *wacko* another rowboat with a pirate would have been good *y* *y* *y* out of *y* *y* *y* *y* *y*

4 legobear, on dec 8 2007, 11:32 pm, said: ... does that mean you didn't have the set but you used your own pieces to rebuild the thing? ... thanx legobear. it means that i have the complete set and have kept it complete until yesterday x-d since i like the set so much, i wanted to keep the general look of it :-) p edited by phred, 09 december 2007 - 06:27 am.

4 that?s a be-au-ti-ful station! it looks perfect from head to toe ;) you managed to keep the original feeling, yet enhanced it to match the spirit of todays city sets. congratulations! and i love your milkman truck! :d

4 that's a beautiful upgrade of a classic set! the new interior is great. *wub* do you still have the tow truck?

4 a wonderful work and a neat idea with that propane tank refilling station. *y* very detailed and very charming indeed! :'-)

4 thank you big pete *wub* this set looks very good, it looks well built and the statues are nice. the ark looks great and the star wars hieroglyphic is classic :-d just a two things: is marion's face double sided? it looks like a calm face on the back of the box. where do the snakes come out? and about the stickers, have you tried putting them on the long bricks above the breakable walls? once again, thanks very much *wub* *y*

4 thanks for the review! it looks awesome, and 10 snakes! is that box the ark though? thanks again! ~peace

2 marion's other face!

4 thank you for the great review! looks like a very nice set, so many snakes!!

2 this is great, thanks for the review...but they're using a new skellie? i thought those were just for the reanimated dead...not just skeletons. unless that skeleton is supposed to be reanimated? either way it makes me sad :'-( that marion is beautiful *wub* worth it for the set alone! and that sw reference is great x-d

4 thanks for that cool review, big pete! *y* a very interesting set with a great playability and that sw sticker?s just hilarious! snake shower on! :-d

2 hollisbrick, on dec 15 2007, 11:30 pm, said: could you take a photo of the ark? thanks oh and the inside too pleese *sweet* the ark doesn't have an inside. it's just one brick built box.

2 is the efigy a totally new peice, or is it made of smaller peices with some gold hair attatched? sorry if i missed this :-$ nice review, just wish we had some more pics of the built set :-d

4 awesome looking playset. will probably not get due to price, and the fact i don't really need it. good to see how everything works, but those damn stickers!

2 indy565, on dec 16 2007, 04:05 am, said: yes, but i don't live in the uk. any idea how much it might cost in the us? $59.99 is the us price. already up for pre-sale on amazon.

2 tinypiesrus, on dec 16 2007, 04:41 am, said: oh, i watched this scene a few weeks ago, and the pilot is fishing while waiting for indy to escape. the enigma that is badger, on dec 16 2007, 05:57 am, said: this is correct, and in pure serial film fashion, the pilot is has just hooked a big one just as jones starts yelling for him to get ready to leave ;-) ahhh ... thanks ... now i want to go out and buy the trilogy on dvd! it's cheap too ... under ?20 for all three at the moment.

2 this set is so cool... and another must buy! :-$ i'm in trouble next year it seems... the figs are great! *wub* i think the plane is only ok; perhaps they should have made that in a separate set as it needed to be a certain size to fit the figs, but that meant that the tail is way too short. here is a picture of the actual plane so you can see what i mean. (notice the pilot is fishing... ;-) ) the temple is another story; i think lego have done an incredible job with this, fitting in the key parts of this sequence without making an absurdly large model. addtionally, there are many parts in this set that i haven't got so it shouldn't be too hard to justify. x-d thanks for another great review. *sweet* i love the photo of indy running with the idol and the boulder close behind. :-p naith, on dec 16 2007, 10:20 pm, said: lol is it just me or in the earlier concepts of this set we saw a native on the box? i wonder why they removed it :-( *wacko* i recall that too. :-/ edit: yes there was one... big pete, on dec 16 2007, 11:28 pm, said: we don't normally have this many inconsistencies do we ? quite annoying ones too. i think the plane looks better with those being white.

4 it looks like a nice set but i'm not interested in the minis, it's got a nice drawbridge though! thanks! *sweet*

2 i want this set but its $60 aud which is a ripp off! i like the yellow car! *wub* :'-) *y* by the way good review! *y*

4 great review and nice touch putting the minifig in the mixer *y* and i think you are the first to review this set so all in all good work. steel...

2 thanks for the review. does anyone know if these mini sets are sold at tru?

4 heres all the parts in assorted baggies, and the horribly messed up instructions. four astronauts and four aliens, with an extra gold visor (yay!) not bad. the base of the horribly unstable alien craft. the wings move up and down, aswell as back and forth, the purpose i know not. next we build the nerf section of the base. basically technic. and the rest of the tube connectors. heres the farthest i got the little missle to go. its fairly dissapointing. good thing i didnt expect much from this portion of the set. heres the start of the command base. more of the main structure, will be adding lots of things to all the little beams. heres a storage container and the surprisingly not flimsy radar. on this side we see the alien elevator. it uses a horribly long technic rod, i have not seen one of this proportion, its like, a foot and a half long. more of the inner base where all the little tubes shall go. all the connected tubes and such. i also encountered a problem. in the instructions it says for the end of the elevator prong to be touching the tube connector where it is shown here, but mine has a 1x space inbetween. no matter. heres the completed base. + my knee. again. onto the spaceship. the bulk of it is just technic supporting beams, with some large slope peices covering it all up. more on that later. the white coverup. the middle section lifts up to store the overly large jetpack. as you see, the storage containers take up most the bulk in the back, and you can see the jetpack on the ground. aswell as the trigger hand hold thing that allows you to swoosh it. look, in the back! lego greebles! despite the large cockpit, it only holds one person, laying down. the wings are really the saving grace - double layered with a nice two toned effect. kitty nudged me this picture so its abit blurry, my apologies :-| extra peices and or peices i have no idea where the hell they go. :-p overall, the set is quite fun i must admit. full price, i probably would not go for it, but i got it for just under 70 dollars. for that price i can confidently say its quite worth it, many useful peices, nice figures (other than the aliens) and the tube things are quite fun to boot, even though i liked the life on mars system more, which i also have. none the less, its very fun to make them shoot around. alright, so its not much of a command base either, and it looks abit bare. but it's still fun, even if you ignore the nerf section. overall i give it a hardy 3.5 out of 5, the openness and epic fail of a missile launcher are hard to get by, but overall, its a dandy set :-d merry christmas *wub*

0 thanks for the review brickmaster! i wanted this set at first but i realized i don't want it as much anymore, seems like a waste of 90$. :-(

2 i agree, it does seem very scarce, but ive taken apart the nerf launcher, made a new module with the tube the launcher used, and beefed up the base with some computers and other things. for 90 dollars i would pass, i agree. on sale it is lovely, though. and none the less ive been entertained for ages with them flyin through the tubes :-d

4 i quite like it, but i feel that my lego city is getting over-run with helicopters and planes. also i have got the helicopter from the 7237 police station set, but it is not as good as this plus i'am sooooo dissapointed that the :-x stickers :-x are blue instead of black and green as they will not fit with the sets i have already got :-d nice review thanks edited by caseyref, 26 december 2007 - 02:04 am.

2 the binoculers. :-) you must have a small moniter.

4 so here it is, the long expected ;-) review of the town plan: i bought it at the legostore riem arcaden last saturday. i paid 149,99 eur for 1981 pieces. this set is separated in 4 parts. 1: the service/gasstation 2: the cars. the petrol pump and the fountain 3: the cinema 4: the town hall the service station has a lot of really nice details, like tools for the car repair, or the table with the cashpoint and the foodstation (there?s a croissant, a banana and a apple in this set). one of my favourit parts is the trolley with some tools, you can see it at brickshelf. at the second part are only a few pieces and i needed not much time to built the 2 cars, the fountain and the petrol pump. there?s something at the truck i don?t understand.. maybe i did something wrong.. but.. the truck has no backlights.. *wacko* i like the petrol pump, that?s why i post a pic of it: the cinema is the highlight for me. it has also really nice details, like the popcorn table or the gumball or candy machine. the colours sheme is really nice, the front of the building with the big displays is a cool idea. overall a really nice building. the town hall has also a really nice colour sheme, i love that dark green mixed with the white stairs. a lot of plants around and in the town hall. as you can see some figs who married there. not more to say about this building. see the pics and enjoy it: overall this set is a must have!! it was really fun to built it. this set reminds me of the back to the future movie with michael j. fox. the whole gallery is at brickshelf, there you can find a few more pics. i hope you enjoyed this review. regards sandra

4 legocastlegirl, on dec 28 2007, 02:12 pm, said: there?s no necessity to take pics of all the film posters. there are only 3 different film posters at the set. always one poster twice.. and you can see every different poster at the brickshelf gallery. if you need more details, then you should maybe buy it :-) regards sandra ouch ;-)

4 very good review, thanks!!!!!!!! axle, on dec 28 2007, 02:07 pm, said: can you take a picture(s) of all the film posters? sticker sheet pic with 1 megapixel film posters

4 thanks for the review legocastlegirl - excellent work *y*! i agree with you, the best part seems to be the movietheater!! that?s perfect because i just love to watch movies in the theater, so far this year i?ve seen 46 pictures (and had some pop-corn to ;-)). this is a must-get-set!! town on copmike

4 really cool review: i have got so much to do that i even did not know that set is already available. the cinema is great. aredhel

4 nice review - thx for all the pics. they certainly made me consider getting this set. kimt btw: which set would you recommend: market streeet, town plan or cafe corner? just curious. they're pretty expensive and i might only afford one of them.

4 kimt, on jan 4 2008, 10:25 am, said: btw: which set would you recommend: market streeet, town plan or cafe corner? just curious. they're pretty expensive and i might only afford one of them. definitely the coffee corner. it?s a hard desicion between coffee corner and town plan, because they are both really great sets. the market street is no "must have" in my opinion. but the other two. maybe you should start with the coffee corner, it?s the older set. the town plan is newer and will be available longer then the coffee corner. i hope it helped you a litte bit :-$ regards sandra edited by legocastlegirl, 04 january 2008 - 10:43 am.

4 this is a great set, lots of detail and that service station and gaspumps do it for me! *sweet* thanks for the review legocastlegirl! *y*

4 happy new year, everyone! i went to my local wal-mart looking for an exclusive bionicle set yesterday, but was amazed to find everything there- sw, bionicle, ef, indie, the works. i nabbed the jsf and the rogue shadow and scampered home to take pics with my new camera. *wub* the box: the same as the other '07 boxes. nothing new. the back shows the various features, with "pop out r2." :-| luckily, the intruction booklet and the dss were intact- not folded like the last mm set i got. |-/ the dss: not too bad, but printed parts would have been great. the figs. anakin is amazing, imo. *wub* fits the cw anie great. i noticed on the s@h reviews the kiddies were saying how ugly he looked. |-/ they need to see the cw cartoon. for the sake of my health, i should probably stop reading those. :-d the build. i won't go too in-depth on the build, since *vader* posted a very in-depth review here. the start of the build: the body of the fighter starts out long and skinny. the jsf's landing gear allows it to sit comfortably without getting in the way while swooshing. r2-d2's launching device. r2 in position. when launched... ...he often gets stuck if you don't press the button hard enough. :-/ looks like r2 needs to lay off... whatever it is robots eat. so far: the flag stickered. it's a big sucker sticker. completed. i forgot to add the nose stickers before i took the pic. warning- the nose cone sticker is actually two stickers. i thought it was one, peeled of one of the stickers, and put it on the middle of the two 1x8 plates, and didn't notice the other sticker. *wacko* various completed shots: i think this was a beautiful little set. r2's launching unit and the flick missiles are annoying, but easily fixed. i plan to add proper cannons in place of the flick missiles. anakin is a great minifig, but he doesn't look so well standing next to my other figs. the brickshelf gallery (when public) will

4 thanks will! this really is a nice set! your new camera and the backround looks great, the pic quality is very good! thanks!! *y*

4 thanks, guys! i have the rogue shadow in the review pipes, should be up soon. legolover100, on jan 1 2008, 07:36 pm, said: this is a brilliant review of a brilliant set! *sweet* thanks a lot! i know this may be a bit much to ask but could take some pics of the whole instruction booklet? please!!! if you can thanks a bunch. but if not do know of a place where i could find the instructions? take pics of each page? that is a lot. i don't know of anywhere that might have it. :-/ if you check *vader* 's review, he has a lot of pics of the build, that might work just as well. will

2 no i need it! i lost my rabbit in the great void known as the large old brown box of doom(l.o.b.b.o.d for short)!!!!! *sing* *sing*

4 thanks for the good review, i wish i had bought one when it was going for only ?24.99 on lsah instead of the usual price of ?50!

4 okie guys and gals, here s time for some droid exploration with my review of set 7670. as a general statement i have to say its really a neat set that is not that expensive for what it holds. 1) box art like always i will start with pics of the box art. btw, notice anything guys ? no bloody crappy dss. yes, finally a set without stickers and that feels great :-d 2) the mfs nothing really spectacular there. the only novelty lies within the inclusion of the new commander (yellow torso) bd. apart from that, there are 2 bds and unfortunately yet another sbd (i like those but i have a huge amount of them, and i would rather had something different). you have 3 short blasters and a couple of extra parts. 3) the spider droid i think it?s a pretty cool little buggar. it?s a rather simple yet classic construction i think. it has sweet parts such as the bd body in dark bley. it really has a spider feel unlike the previous ep3 one. 4) the hailfire droid this baby represents the ?pi?ce de resistance? of this set. i truly love it !! sure it?s a bit under scale but i don?t really mind that. its conception is superb even if i totally dislike assembling those technic treads (especially 80 of those small things). the ellipse of the treads is well balanced and that trans disc is a brilliant idea. the great thing is those new flick fire missiles: they don?t fall unlike the other ones and they do look good on this baby. also you can put the wheels together and the missiles to gain some shelf space (easy storage on :-d ) in conclusion those druids re really sweet and are perfect target practice for the upcoming rgs hehe !! i hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any ;-) *yoda*

2 sorry yoda. i think it might of been my problem. :-$ either way i edited my first post. dp8

2 they released the battle droid commander in 2000 :-|

4 yeah finally *yoda* got his sw :-d i got 2 of them after x mas - they are really cool - especially the spider droid! 2 of them on! & happy *yoda* on :-p edited by aayla-secura, 05 january 2008 - 10:38 pm.

2 you thought the bat tank was bad, the tie crawler has 81 for each of the sides *sing*. and don't get me started on the sand crawler! :-x

2 nice review! and you finally got an 08 set! i haven't gotten any, i blame wal-mart for putting products out late |-/ :-d instead of a sbd, tlc should have included a droideka(new version) *y* the scale is a bit off, so this is a dwarf hailfire droid :-p p

2 thanks for the reveiw, i've got one of these and an at-ap in the mail hopefully arriveing tomorrow :-) edited by legoman, 06 january 2008 - 12:15 am.

2 great review mate as usual, for me the highlight of this set has to be the new spider droid. even though it's made up of some strange parts it really appeals to me, i would love a few of those babys. the hellfire droid is also well put together even if it is a little small, but hey it looks fun. i really like the look of this set but the price tag really puts me off, why oh why did lego price it so high.... :'-(

2 my hailfire droid is gonna be coming in the mail soon, as well as the battlepacks.

4 i haven't spotted these in the us yet. i'm looking forward to finding them. overall, the 2008 line-up is a excellent and it's going to be difficult for me to decide which themes/sets to pursue. there's a lot to choose from.

4 nice review yoda i dont think i have ever read one with as much cursing of stickers! :-d i love these two little sets, the colour scheme the little different wheels on the post van and of course the new postmen uniforms! would have been nice if they had included little satchels like in the new indiana jones sets, oh well! ;-) postman yoda on! *yoda*

4 very nice, cheers yoda! i'll definitely be getting the post van, not sure about the plane though. both are awesome, but i think i have enough planes... can you tell me though, the wheels on the van, are they rubber or plastic? they look a bit tacky...

4 thanks for the review :-) i was actually considering getting these, but i saw they were overpriced for my tastes - too bad, theyre nifty lil things *wub*

4 loool : spielberg goes on a career change :-d these are some nice sets. i really love that car. looks sleek

4 thanks for a nice review and few comments to sets: nice airplane, finally some reminiscence for lego city golden era (for me years 1982-1992). everything is nice, but two things are freezing a smile on my face. first of all the ugly new hinge used for plane roof. i have already 4032 and those new hinges are looking really terrible when compared f.e. with 6368. second one is new minifig, i don?t know what i expected, but this torso design looks too simple and too cheap.. concerning new car - i appreciate fact, that tlc makes after long long years again postal sets, but i don?t like those new-style cars. matchbox wheels and bad rate between drivers cockpit and cargo space are damping me from buying. 6651 mail truck or 105 canada post truck were much better... edited by kanal-k1, 06 january 2008 - 07:33 pm.

2 i'm glad to see the mail van has the doors that used to be on the older cargo containers. i had given up on those older ones, but now that they're still out there, i may invest in the older cargo system instead of the new 6-wide ones. both sets are good enough, i'll get both. i'm hoping for a postal building too, even though i have the smaller of the old post offices. a nice big modern one would be great. i'm not too hung up about the design of the plane; i've got the neat old cargo plane with the tail that swings open (one of the best plane sets) for big packages. the truck is goofy looking, but if i get sick of looking at it i can rebuild it into a classic looking one. great review by the way, the pictures are some of the better one i've seen in a review recently.

4 5150 lego, on jan 6 2008, 11:08 pm, said: well first off, thanks yoda for the great review. :-) hmmm... well, i have to say, i'm not at all impressed with any of these sets. i mean, there nice and all, but the van just seems way to small. it would have been nice if you could fit more than one package in it. i guessi'm one of those that are more of the fan of the 6 wide trucks. i see your point that more cargo capacity would have been better. nevertheless, my personal preference is for smaller "classic" scale city sets. the mail van is nice and small, and should fit well with my road plates and 1990s cars from the 4561 train. on a side note, did anyone notice the message on the back of both sets' boxes, "designed for easy building and instant play"? it surprised me a little, since these sets seem no less complex than any other city set of late. they look like quick builds, sure, but not as though the designers went out of their way to simplify them.

2 thanks *yoda* for the great reviews. i love the airplane, it's really cute. the van needed to grow on me though but you did the trick. i don't like the wheels of the van. they will need replacing. and wouldn't everything have been better if they were completely red? dr. brick

4 beach house reviewed by dunamis set 4996 522 pieces $29.95 from target build time 90 minutes yet another interesting creator theme house. this one comes fresh of the 2008 line of sets and promises 3 different models. packing 522 pieces (albeit a lot of 1x1 plates) for only $29.95 it was hard to pass this one by as i was foraging for the new 2008 star wars sets at the local target. plus, i was itching to do another review since i had finally fully recovered from my marathon ucs falcon review which took the better part a month to complete. the box: the box is pretty standard creator type box which shows off the three models (beach house, caf? and ?towering? apartment building.) the back of the box shows some of the features of the three models. interesting features of the three models prominently displayed on the back include: - food counter complete with coffee (espresso) maker and food warmer (with chicken leg!) - home office complete with laptop (and the ubiquitous coffee cup.) - flip up roof granting access inside of beach house. note the satellite tv dish and even rain gutters along the roofline! opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals. we?re back to the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets. note the parts inventory is on the side of the box as well. this is a nice feature. once inside the box, we are greeted by eight sealed bags plus two yellow 16x2 plates and a green 32x16 baseplate. thank goodness there is no dss (dreaded sticker sheet) but alas there are no minifigs. in addition, there are the three manuals (one for each model) and they were stuffed into my box with the care of kid trying to put 10 gallons (or liters if you prefer) of candy in a 5 gallon bucket. but hey, we?re not collecting manuals here so who cares if the manuals are all bent and warped? the manuals: the three manuals are 74, 72 and 48 pages in length. they are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - piece call outs for each step - parts inventory at the end of the primary model build - page numbers color separation in these manuals were fine for me. plus, we get the usual verbose lego instructions on not dumping all your pieces outside in the grass and not to dump all your pieces into a single pile. thanks for the tip, tlg! parts list the pieces: pretty standard stuff here and as i mentioned, lots of 1x1 plates and tiles (at least 100.) however, we do get quite a few windows and a couple of doors. a majority of the color is black and yellow. i did see a few pieces that i was not familiar with so i?m going to show them below. keep in mind i?m not a parts jockey so bear with me if i think a part is brand new for 2008 and it was actually released with the classic space line. 2x2 window (fixed) and 4x3 window that opens: the follow photo shows the window glass (same as in corner caf?), door glass and new black parts. turns out these black parts are used as wheels. i showed the window glass because it still contains the molding circle just like they did before. it is hard to see from the photo, but it is there. the door glass i think might be new: i don?t recall seeing these 2x2 round plates with clips before and i thought i would show the mail only because it is printed and not a sticker: i know these are common, but didn?t they have four studs on top? these only have two: how about this sloped 4x3 window that opens: overall a nice assortment of parts with nothing juniorized. the build: the build was fun and was fairly straightforward. once you figure out which of the three models to build, it goes pretty quick. here are a few shots: see how the inside is made: look at the detail with the flowers and even the outside water faucet! outdoor seating area: upstairs being built: upstairs with opening roof (notice the satellite tv dish): check out the patio on the upstairs complete with outdoor light and rain gutters! here?s my favorite, the bbq grill. at least we know where those new parts go: finally, check out the tree. no juniorization here! here is what is left over: so far, i have only built the primary model. the others look interesting, especially the caf?. the design: the design was well done. very rich in detail. i love how there are no juniorized parts. the house is accessible by taking off the top floor (like caf? corner and market street). there is an internal staircase as well. there is no interior to speak of in the beach house, but there is in the other two models. the only real negative is that it is kind of small when you get it done. it would be nice if it was about 50% bigger. here are a few views of the beach house with a few minifigs thrown in: check out the close-up of the caf? which i think looks great: also, here is a photo of the interior of the apartment building where you can see the office and computer: overall thoughts: it is a really nice set. a tad on the small side but it has some great detail and lots of features. quick enough to build all three models and would fit real nice into an existing town plan. is minifig scale, but does not come with any. lots of window parts and black slopes. is a nice diversion from the onslaught of clone wars ships that we can?t remember seeing from the movies. final rating: 84% build 9/10 (pretty quick and fun.) functionality 9/10 (it is a creator set so you have multiple varied builds. diverse enough to keep the kids entertained.) design 10/10 (excellent and well thought out. outstanding detail for such a small model.) parts 6/10 (fair, nothing earth-shattering but lots of slopes and windows.) price 8/10 (price ratio is good but you get a lot of little parts. would be better with minifigs.) edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 06:38 pm. indexed

4 nice set and review. what i really like is that this set gives you a lot of ideas for your own houses (mocs)? kimt

4 love this set now more than ever. *wub* i knew i wanted it from the first leaked boxshots, especially with my love of yellow buildings (just ask hinckley ;-) ). great review, especially nice to see the closeup parts shots. those new 2x2 white windows are very much like replacements for the classic 2x2 windows tlg stopped regularly making a while back, so it's great to see them. the wheels are trolley wheels, common in sets including stretchers and handcarts. the holder for them is a fairly recent part i think. i remember a couple coming in a little single minifig jet engine repair set i picked up in a s@h order within the last year. oh honey, be sure to wrench that chicken before it burns! *wacko* thanks for another excellent review of a set i'm even more excited about than before! *y*

2 i got this set on tuesday on the sunshine coast (i was on a holiday) and since kmart were having a 15% off lego it was only $40 *y* . im modifying my summer house (its pretty small) .so far i've put a small kitchen,toilet,fridge & freezer downstairs and up stairs i will try to fit a bed and computer also im going to attach a small garage for my minifigs car. 8-?

4 my sister bought this last week. i'm so proud! :'-) this is a great set. not too big, and it looks really nice... will

2 i finally got around to finding this at my local tru. probably going to do an interior soon.

4 i had this set, and it's really a very nice and excellent house! thanks for the great review! hehe, enjoy it very much. my fave part was the bbq pit :-$

4 very nice! i have been debating on whether or not to buy it-it would appear you made up my mind for me! *y*

0 i think this is one to leave on the shelf with the giant dump truck of 2006 and the hovercraft of 2007!

0 thanks for the review, but its an utter pass for me on this one - i already have a huge juniorized plane from the airport set - one is enough for me! :-$

2 am i the only that one that thinks it is not so bad???????????????????????what i am trying to say is wouldn't planes be this big in real life???i know it has a lot of big pieces but how would they make them any smaller,or how would they the big pieces into a bunch of tiny pieces?well any way i do think in some cases that if there is any "juniorized" involved it should be with duplo. complaning off

0 thanks for the review, unfortunately the pictures did not load for me! i have to say having seen other images, i do agree with your comments, the plane is far to big, and not enough details. that sums it up for me!

0 i have to agree with almost all of the replies here that this set is the most ugliest looking lego set i have ever seen. if i have never seen this set, and ppl showed it to me, i would have thought it would be some little kid's moc or something (no offence!) huge juniorized pieces, bad color theme (i would say it would look better if the wing is white), no interior and huge dss! i will avoid this set like the plague. i own the entire city line (except for the airport) and planning to get all the city stuff that lego releases. but, this set will ruin my plans coz i will avoid it... unless someone gives it to me for free. haha *wacko* boo lego boo! :-x

0 this still looks like a cool set but the price not so much. do all lego police set come with the polizei option or just ones from europe i have not bought a police set in years. edited by legoman132, 11 september 2008 - 05:30 pm.

4 hello and welcome to another redman set review! well, actually, the first redman set review! i'm your host, redman, and today i adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the impulse set simply titled "the knight". this is a great set, with 14 pieces, 2 of which are spare, and a minifig with 2 weapons, 2 helmets, and some shiny armour. all this is packaged in a tiny box, just short of 10 cm? (or 3? inches?), with a neat little instruction manual that folds up to the size of the weapons rack included in the set. as you can see, this set only costs a measly 7 nzd. (disclaimer: redman not included.) here we see the box, clearly showing what the box holds. on the top we see a 1:1 scale picture of a minifig, for those new to lego, or who have forgotten how big a minifig is i guess. :-/ x-d the instruction manual, showing the nice and easy built, with me for size comparison. :-d (*sorry about the dark image, i had to lean over the light to get a birds eye pic. ;-)*) here we see the 2 different soldiers you can make with the set; a knight, and a guard or standard troop or soldier or whatever you want to call him... (note, each set comes with only 1 minifigure, and additional accessories.) of course you know i'm in the picture just for the sake of it, i'm not really one of the soldiers. x-d the neat little weapons rack, or rather equipment rack, as it holds not only a weapon but a shield (except the ovoid ones), helmet, and armour. nice and easy storage, so your equipment won't get dirty lying around on the ground. :-d one of the spare parts is another of those robot hands, so you can stick that in place of the shield and allow the rack to hold 2 weapons. just thought you'd like to know that. :-$ and here we see the nifty little structure of the thing. it can even support a whole minifig! note the grey stud on the bottom bar is a spare part, i just find it better used there to hold the armour. :-) huh? i don't remember this picture... 8-| it appears i drifted off, and these guys don't look too happy i overtook their weapons equipment rack. :-$ i should go... x-d so, in conclusion this is a great set for army building, at a reasonable price, with nice equipment, and it can be picked up as a little extra with your normal shopping. x-d that's all for today folks! *sweet* [/redman] so, what do you think? should i continue with these redman reviews ? (:-p), or just stop now? x-d comments and criticism welcome! :-$ ~peace

4 nice review, iamded. i'd better go and check toyworld tommorrow *sweet* shame about the price though, only 3 more dollars to get crossbow attack :-( iamded, on jan 19 2008, 12:44 am, said: and here we see the nifty little structure of the thing. it can even support a whole minifig! :-d batbrick, on jan 19 2008, 01:36 am, said: edit: btw, is it just me, or does my new avatar make me seem a bit creepy? 8-| batbrick, you've always been a bit creepy :-p x-d

4 thanks everyone for your positive feedback, it's really appreciated! :-d you'd be surprised how long that 'redman presents' thing up the top took me to make! x-d so, it appears people do like redman, expect him to be reviewing the good wizard and battle arachnoid in near future! (i know those have already been reviewed, but new zealand never gets sets first, so i'll just be reviewing the sets i get. x-d) thefrisian, on jan 19 2008, 04:44 am, said: nice review, very detailed. *y* as for the spare parts, mine didn't come with any. both dark grey 1x1 round plates are used on the weapons rack (one for the armour, one for the helmet) and i only got one robot hand for holding weapons. that's strange, maybe i'm just lucky. x-d i also got 2 spare orange viking horn pieces in my battle arachnoid. :-d ~peace

2 seems like a good set should i get it? btw how did you get you hands on this?

4 nice review. *sweet* this is a must buy for me since i *wub* the new sand green giant troll! now i just have to wait until it's available in the us :'-( general tarful

4 thanks for the review *vader*! the first picture of the troll is great, the gold armour really shines! x-d a fantastic set, i'll definitely get a couple of these! *wub* as for the ogres/'giant trolls', the dark tan one fits in the mine setting well, but for above ground, settings, i prefer the sand green one. *y* ~peace edited by iamded, 19 january 2008 - 10:21 am.

4 some people say they like the shadow knight helmet better, but this one is way better!

0 great review, vader :-) as i've said before, this is a nice set, but doesn't really come with anything that doesn't come with the other sets of the line. for this reason, it will be somewhere at the bottom of my list for 2008. also, i like torso and helmet of the dwarf mining orcs much better. the colours make the torso look rather dull and boring, while the other, more brown one, looks much clearer and more exciting. i think i like the *knight* helmet better too, looks more covering and threatening than this one, although i'll save my judgement until i have one in my hands. thanks again vader ;-) edit: forgot to mention, hilarious pic in your sig, vader :-d edited by tinypiesrus, 19 january 2008 - 08:28 am.

4 vader, on jan 19 2008, 12:45 am, said: here's a few quick shots of the 2 larger trolls we have so far, i prefer the sand green one. nice comparison shot, judging from these pics, i think i have to agree with you that green suits the troll better. especially since the orcs are sand green as well, indicating some relation between the two races (if they are indeed separate races). great review, very detailed and with lots of pictures. i was already interested in this set, but after reading your review i want this set for sure! *y*

2 xwingyoda, on jan 22 2008, 04:26 pm, said: tks for the review mate ;-) now i have to bloody wait long because lego france has this line available in freaking march >:-( pissed *yoda* on !! :-d i love the "new" goblin :-p that helmet is really cool. why on earth tlc didn't include that one in the dwarf mine ? such another idiotic move |-/ anyone keeping track of tlc's stupidity lately ? that would be interesting !! i clearly want a huge goblin army now hehe !! and i totally agree with you mate, the troll lokks better in sand green. the cart itself is pretty lame imo - just a sordid excuse to include yet another annoying shooting crappy device. but for a 21? set its okie i say ;-) need my bad guys on !! *yoda* i believe there is a topic around here somewhere based on bad lego ideas. after getting this new helmet i really wish lego had included it with the mining set, it's bloody annoying having to buy yet more of them from bl :'-( the shooting bit is better than some sets that have had one, at least this one is smartly done and of course it can also be hidden.

2 thanks for the review of a set i would otherwise probably have passed on. out of curiosity how did you 'know it was for you'? you seem to be building quite a collection. why castle now? was the fantasy element all it took? just curious. thanks again and god bless, nathan

2 general kannon, on jan 19 2008, 05:10 am, said: im guessing the main difference is the fact that the box says special edition. it's either that or it's a toysrus exclusive set, as my armoured drilling unit box also had special edition on it.

2 brickmaster, on jan 19 2008, 12:27 am, said: it's either that or it's a toysrus exclusive set, as my armoured drilling unit box also had special edition on it. special edition mean that it's a store exclusive set. the cargo theme is a tru exclusive, and another example is thr tie crawler is exclusive to target. also, can th doors be opened on either side?

2 i'm curious, for those of you who are not into city sets and want this set for the forklift, what would you use it for?

2 ,

2 mr tiber, on jan 19 2008, 10:26 am, said: hmmm, put it in my pirate port and use it to carry rum! perhaps that's the mysterious cargo. mr. tiber replaced the petro with rum... :-d

0 thank you very much for your nice review, the brickster! *y* although i really like this set i?m sooo disappointed about the big "on the cabin" brick :-x , that i probably won?t buy it. tlc could easiliy have done so much better with bricks already in use, like these: or or no, that juniorized part is a thorn in my side. >:-( but i have use for those new canisters. *wub*

2 holodoc, on jan 19 2008, 11:10 am, said: although i really like this set i?m sooo disappointed about the big "on the cabin" brick :-x , that i probably won?t buy it. it's really not bad. it is big, but not a show stopper for me.

2 mr tiber, on jan 19 2008, 02:46 pm, said: hmm, that's a thought, but why would they pick this particular set? i would expect they'd do that with a slightly bigger set, like the heavy hauler perhaps. why do you think they'de pick this one? good question. maybe it's merely a gimick to help push the city sets with all the other competing themes. the cement mixer is a special edition as well.

4 this set looks pretty good to me, it is six wide isn't it? that is nice for a truck like this

2 5150 lego, on jan 20 2008, 11:50 am, said: great review! my only grip with this set is you can only fit one pallet in the truck. it should have been the same size as the trailer so you can at least fit 2 pallets. seems like alotof wasted space. if i'm going to transport cargo, i want to use the maximum amount of space aviable!! x-d that's a fair gripe. someone else mentioned it above as well. i thought the same thing when i went to load it.

4 i got this set last week and just to add a few of my own points cons: - the forklift spring feels a bit flimsy - i don't know how long it will last or how much stress it would take - and the end coil isn't really heavily secured to the lift mechanism. time will tell on that one. - 30 stickers! it's the exo-force of city sets! the truck set does look less plain with them on though. i would reccomend lining them up with the green brick in the second container rather than applying the first lot without a guide or they may end up uneven - it's very hard to put the minifig in the forklift without dismantling (or breaking open) the set slightly - the cargo box attached to the main cabin of the truck doesn't hold very strongly - minifigs are dull - that dark blue torso with pattern is way overused - green stickers are a different green to the bricks themselves pros: - lots of nice pieces including the large white panels and cargo pieces, and i like the green/ white colour scheme - the cargo doors open well and the hingeing mechanism doesn't stand out to the detriment of the rest of the set (as some people have complained about the mail airplane) - studless floor in cargo containers makes it easy to move pallets in and out - fits in better than the heavy hauler to a minifig sized city - new 1x1x4 slope! (at least i hadn't seen it before) overall - nice set with some good pictures, although a bit flimsy, and way too many stickers - the same issues i have with the cargo plane as well (although that had more colour issues).

2 ricecracker, on jan 21 2008, 05:28 pm, said: hey, thanks for the review the brickster! i was just wondering if you could possibly upload a picture of the instructions for the forklift, and, if possible, tell me the piece # of the 1x4 slope bricks (to bricklink them). thanks! i don't have a scanner for the instructions, but the 1x4 slope is listed as piece #4515362 in the instructions.

4 good reveiw, i quite like this set and ill buy it as soon as it actually gets in my country |-/ :-| (600th post) edit: $7!!!!! geez i thought $6 was bad :-x edit: who typed megablocks in my post..i didnt,??? edited by hollisbrick, 20 january 2008 - 05:41 am.

4 iamded, on jan 20 2008, 05:29 am, said: his belt has 4 gold crosses (as seen in, if you look closely, the new crownie's torso and the crownie archer's torso) and a belt buckle, and the legs have a bottle, a coin, and a small bag. nice little wizard-ey items. i think the "coin" is actually some kind of amulet or locket. nice review, keep them coming! *sweet*

4 thanks for the review of this nice little set. for it's price (3 euros here in holland) it contains quite a lot of useful parts. the only thing that could have been better in my opinion is the wand, i always liked this one:

2 not bad. i could see picking up a couple of these guys along with a few of the new knights. i actually prefer the wizard as these impulse items are simply too expensive for army building (imo). later.

4 iamded, on jan 21 2008, 05:03 am, said: sorry, i knew you had done a review, but i didn't think you had to post a link to all other reviews already done on that set. :-/ it's just expressing my opinions and sharing my thoughts about the set, as well as giving people a bit of info. the way i see it, i don't really have to post a link in the first post, but you can feel free to post a link to your review if you want, to give people your thoughts and opinions. on most message boards, one doesn't duplicate the topic of an active or recent thread. there's a good reason for that: the boards would soon become a mess if that practice became widespread. i assumed that keeping posts on the same topic together was also the rule here and therefore expected any posts like your opening one to be a contribution to my existing thread on this topic. it appears though that i was mistaken; on these boards, one is free to start a new thread on an existing topic. in future, i may well do that. thank you for drawing my attention to that. back on topic: i thought your review was pretty good as were the pics. *y* edited by amperzand, 21 january 2008 - 12:20 pm.

2 mister phes, on jan 21 2008, 10:34 pm, said: nz$7 is worth au$6... so it's the same price... thats not the point :-d

4 thanks dr.s for this great review, this is your what, second one? anyway, this aint half bad, i actually kind of like the bigger planes despite the annoying big pieces, and this one looks to be the best yet. batbrick away! >:-)

4 doctor sinister, on feb 5 2008, 09:53 am, said: there are two - hopefully these are the numbers you need: 4525919 4525920 ? dr. s. they are perfect! *wub* thanks very much. *sweet* it's built very oddly. *wacko*

2 the amount of cargo that huge plane carries! 8-? green peace would have a field day! x-d nice review dr s but this set is just too big for my town scale! ;-) edited by casewindu, 05 february 2008 - 09:54 pm.

4 dr. s: i was not planning on buying this set after my disappointment with the other large airplane, but after looking at this image review, i just might buy. the green color is really the aspect that makes this airplane stand out. i think it looks great! thanks for the review.

0 thank for the review doc! the only thing i like in this set is the small car. so i will not buy this set just for it! i really dislike those new planes, toooo bbiiiigggg! with this size, this cargo plane can carry just fiew things! what a shame! i think that the way tlc has made the wings is not very good... like the rest of those big pieces... just my thought. the positif point of this it's that it makes me saved some money :-d

2 at my local wal*mart there was most of the 2008 sets including the indiana jones ones :'-) i picked up this one and the motorcycle chase! name: 7621 lost tomb price: $20.00 parts: 277 figs: 3 *box art first off we have the great indiana jones box art!! i must say the designers did an excellent job on it! i love the little temple design with skulls! as well as including indy in the right hand corner. the back of the box is just as cool showing all the neat play features of the set as well as an advertisement for the indiana jones game *figs first off we have our hero, indian............. what the hell? why is there a freaking cw anakin head on indy!! there was a production slip up as instead of indy's head i get anakin's! :-| |-/ i open the box up and there staring me in the face is his ugly face!! tlc is defiantly doing to here a gnarly complaint from me!! >:-( ok now here we have the " real" indy fig that is supposed to come with the set :-d i just noticed that his fedora hat goes down in the back! bonus picture time, here is a jacketless indy with his sleeve torn off, like he looks in the temple of doom *sweet* the next figure up is our lovely marion *wub* *wub* *wub* plus her head is reversible with a scared face x-d love the new hairpiece in black!! finally we have our undead skellie with second style head and poseable arms *the well of souls the set itself is a nice model and playset! the anubis statues are very cool and i love all the hieroglyphs on the walls 8-? here is the sw link with artoo and 3p0 x-d the ark in its resting place the ark removed, its very cool indeed, but tlc should have made the whole thing in chrome gold |-/ not metallic gold with brown and yellow!! the closeup of the anubis statue, yes the eye is a sticker but at leasts a gold color! *playability first off you can pull the pin on the anubis statues which send them falling and taking out the walls. behind the wall a skellie swings out! there is a lever in the back of the model where you push down and the snakes shower down upon the figs hehe with the snakes all around, marion is both modeling with the new carrot torch and fending off viscous cobras :-d in the meantime indy uses his whip to scale the wall and avoid all the snakes which he is afriad of. in the meantime leaving marion behind to fight them off. :-p the whip is bendable but it will always snap back into a coil, its some type of bendy hard plastic *scoring figs- 9/10 model- 8/10 playability- 8.5/10 overall satisfaction- 4/10 (would be 9/10 if it wasn't for the stupid anakin head error!) in the end this is a charming set and could easily fit in with the adventurers! it has the cool anubis statues as well as the ark. plus indy, marion and a skellie, great selection of figs but sallah would have been better since he actually removes the ark with indy however i am still wondering the point of the anubis statues, this set does seem pretty silly :-p p

0 wow what a screw up from lego! that one is even more out there than the extra obi wan in the rc. x-d

2 i have noticed that at my local tlc store (orlando) they have this set in a glass case on display...with the cw anakin head on indy. i did not realize this was such i widespread problem.

2 yeah in mine i did not have any problems. well except on one of my dark blue round pieces it was a bit damaged but it still worked fine and i got a replacement from lego.

4 welcome to: my sigfig sgt. joey sh. will lead trough this review of the new city 7743 police surveilance truck. first of all the box: front back the minifigs: 3 police officers and a bad guy now the vehicles: the cute little atv *wub* the main part of the set: the surveilance truck a shot of the interior the trailer back of the trailer the truck back side the little building: front the interior and last but not least: spare parts and not needed stickers that?s it! hope to see you again at the next episode of sgt. joey?s reviews.

2 great review stealth hunter, a bit blurry in places but overall nice shots of the truck. it is much, much better than i expected, but i still won't get it, i have no need for more police. thanks for the great review! batbrick away! >:-)

2 thanks for the review, that truck is actually better than i first thought! i am still tossing up getting it, as i am getting the police station, and where would it park?! :-p i quite like the little building though, but still... i am so confused *wacko*

4 hello and welcome to another, oh wait, first batbrick and iamded review! today us two sworn enemies will be reviewing the creator cargo chopper, here is the front of the box: and while pushing iamded to his doom, here is the back: haha! ouch! oh dear...here are the parts anyway... here is the instruction of the first model, the cargo chopper. i love creator sets for the different models, they always excite me. just ignore me finishing off my nemesis in the background. something very interesting that i liked in the instructions was this step where you must add those three 2x2 yellow rounded pieces under the chopper. this is for support while you build, which is handy, and later you take it off: and even later use it as the cargo. i found that to be rather innovative and clever, as well as - hey! what are you hitting me for? both instruction booklets have the same back: now heres the chopper itself. i love the design of it, it isn't quite minifig scale but its great all the same. this is my first non-xpod or house creator set, and it sure is fun. here me and iamded go for a dizzy ride. i love the nose of the copter, and the landing gear is fantastic. a shot from the other side. oh dear, it seems we've been a bit sick from that ride, and were vomiting transgreen 1x1s. the cargo itself is nicely made, though i forgot to put on two tiles here :-$ . it fits in real well with the chopper to, and the line is great for giving iamded the wedgie he deserves: this is my first power function set, so i was pretty excited. the motor is intergrated really well into this set, and is activated by pushing that little 3x2 plate with the 1x1 slopes on it forward, until it hits the motor button, that orange knob. another point of interest is the use of bley barrels on each side. i like this as i don't have those pieces in that colour. a shot of the motor. its really simple, all you do is pull the hook out to any length that allows, then press the orange button and it will wind it back up. this makes the chopper pull the cargo up into its bay, and iamded pull me here reluctantly to a whacking: a top view, is that my head? a view of the chopper without the cargo in it. i love the lowered cockpit: the leftover pieces from building: (note: iamded's head does not count as set piece) and a final shot of the set with me and iamded. oh, it appear we're dead, oh dear... hope you enjoyed this review, soon i will post the two alternate models. i loved this chopper, its great to play with and has nice construction. it also has some handy pieces too. the motor function sounds like a gimmick but is well intergrated into this model. well worth the price, so far this is another win for creator i say! so far i recommend this model, but later we'll see if the alt models are up to scratch. also, since this is my first review, comments and criticism welcome on everything. batbrick away! >:-) edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 06:37 pm. indexed

4 great review! keep them coming! i might get this set now. i must have those grey barrels... oh dear... :-d x-d :-p x-d this was a hilaruos review, too. edited by ~vbbn~, 10 february 2008 - 11:21 pm.

4 congrats to that nice review.... i like the batcave set, you should also been able to find it at discount....

4 thanks for that nice review. i still don't think i will get this set though. the penguin, on feb 18 2008, 05:04 pm, said: thank you for your wonderful review! ) i was done very well.... ) i suggest that you will find "two-face's escape" set a very interesting one to build.... it also provides great playability and is not very expensive for what you will get. ) good day to you. ) yes, two-face escape is definitly a good buy. i suggest you get it.

4 hi! asuka, on feb 18 2008, 09:25 pm, said: congrats to that nice review.... i like the batcave set, you should also been able to find it at discount.... try epay. i found it there for 38 euro (and picked up two of them). nice price for loads of nifty material.

4 great small set that can help you add to you minifig count. the little boats are always cool, and the den isn't that bad either.

2 a nice review and a nice little set for anyone's pirate collection. a 5/5 for the review.

4 imo this is a very simple and small set good to add some part to forbidden island. good

2 laurinator- i don't mind an occassional old review coming back to life for discussion, but it seems you've replied to many old reviews that have been stagnant for years. please try to refrain from "bumping" a lot of old topics as it pushes down new content that should really be the focus of discussion now.

4 hi guys. i picked these up the other day, but it's taken me this long to get round to posting the reviews. so, here we go: tub comparison with a minfig (thanks brainbox): the lighting changes a bit throughout the photographs, as it was going dark outside, so i only really had my desk light, and i kept getting in the way. 4837 mini trains now the box i really like. it's no different to those of last year's sets, but the colour here is simply fantastic, and really seems appropriate for the theme. so this is what you get inside. all the pieces are still inside the bag, the optical illusion was accidental :-d . no pieces of particular outstanding interest, but the dark green cheese slopes are rather nice. look out for those later. 1 2 3 this is the main model, and uses all the pieces in the set (bar these two, which according to the inventory are spares, but as with all my other creator sets, i'm cheating and leaving them in). this is far and away the best model of the three, and evokes the iconic version of a steam train. the green looks superb, but i'm not sure whether that's due to the model itself or the actual colour. moving on, we get to the second model: 1 leftovers (yes, i admit, i was using a piece of paper) this isn't actually a bad model. i don't think it's quite as nice as the previous one, but it's not bad. it's different from the first model as well, which is good. too muich of the same can be a bad thing. finally, we come to the third model: leftovers now... i'll be honest. i don't really know what this is. it's not that good a model compared to the other two. that's all i can say, really. and of course, all the pieces fit into the tub. overall: i have to say, i do like this set, despite the weak third model. the strength of the primary and secondary models make up for any weaknesses in the third, and i can imagine the pieces being fully usuable in building other trains. while the basic idea of these tubs isn't quite as good as the x-pods with regards portability and general 'niceness' they aren't bad. and for a fairly cheap price (?3-4) as well. 4838 mini vehicles this is one of those set boxes that you see because of the ridiculously loud colours. sound marketing scheme if you ask me. i've managed it again. there are pieces outside the bag. or are there? now these i like *y* . 1 2 (i don't know what the clip is for, there isn't one on the other side) 3 4 5 this is the main model of the set, and again all the pieces are used bar these three, the spares. it's quite a nice model, although the car's a bit odd. still, i like the ramps, and the colour scheme reminds me just a little of g1 ultra magnus. hmm, i think that boom arm could do with refixing... 1 2 leftovers this is actually quite nice as well. it's that classic breakdown truck, and the boom arm itself is quite nice, with quite a bit of movement. another solid model. 1 leftovers i'm surprised by the amount of detail here actually. not only have tlc included a spare wheel at the back, but also what looks like a trailer hitch, which all adds to the 'realism.' another nice model to round out a nice set. and in the tub. overall: i'm not sure which of the two i like better. when i bought them, and on the way home, i much preferred the train set. but after building this set, i'm not sure. this is another good set from the year when tlc seems to be giving us so many. there are some good pieces in here too, and while there's nothing unique, they're still good. so, thanks for reading, hope it helped someone, and if there are any requests, i'll see what i can do. that's requests for pics, not songs ;-) . edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 06:56 pm. indexed

2 ricecracker, on feb 19 2008, 06:39 pm, said: why not? they are all very nice (i have all six of them), especially the helicopter, my least anticipated, but one of the most detailed!! thanks for the review brainbox!! well, i shall wait until it goes for $1.25 on my s@h, than buy it with a load of other sets. plural, on feb 19 2008, 07:25 pm, said: thanks for the review brainbox. *sweet* these look really nifty* i might pick up a couple of these as for the parts, i'm sure they could come in handy for something. and so cheap as well. i still miss x-pods though. :'-( *do the kids still say nifty these days? *wacko* eurobrickers do, that's for sure!

2 mmmmh, i *wub* love the train... great review. it looks like each model can be connected to the other to make a complete train. *y* *y* it makes me want to get 3 of them (or more) to make a long one. :-d

4 cheers for the reviews. they're both nice sets, and i think i just may have to buy both. or maybe i'll get two of the dwarf set? the figs in each are really cool as well. the dwarf, well, they're just cool anyway, but the troll with the golden helmet and armour, that's just *wub*

4 thanks for the double review, i like the dwarf catapult but the real deal is the tower raid set. i love that siege tower and love that new armour, can't wait to get it. thanks for the review! batbrick away! >:-)

4 thanks metalandi! these are 2 great sets, i'm definately looking forward to seeing these in new zealand stores! the collapsing floor/prisoner freeing mechanism on the tower is wonderful, a great touch. some slight modifications, like, some walls, will make this perfect. and the dwarf's mine defender is a sweet little set, with some neat minifigs. thanks for the reviews! *y* ~peace

4 *sweet* wow!! another excellent review! haha, that tower does reminds me of kk ii of mistland tower =x well, overall, i love these 2 sets very very much *sweet*

0 i got myself today 3 dwarf's mine defender and i have to say that sets does suck big time: the plastic rubber band doesn't do squat, and 3 wheels i really not enough. i only built 2 of those and changed the front of it with 4 wheels and no plastic rubber band and i changed the 2x2 dark bley plate. its still looks good but the crappy rubber band system is really not well thought off. anyhow my orc army is growing >:-) *yoda*

2 well you didn't say anything wrong yet undead army officer i perfer using the batle wheel to knock down the tower's walls, not the seige tower

4 now that this topic has been brought up again, i just want to say that the rubber band on my dwarf mine defender actually works

4 they're so beautiful... 4 more months.

4 green grocer reviewed by dunamis set 10185 2,352 pieces $149.95 from the lego store (glendale, ca) build time 6.5 hours holy guacamole! almost exactly one year after caf? corner was released we get the third installment in the increasingly popular lego exclusive town series. combined with the famous 10182 caf? corner and its trusty companion 10190 market street this trio makes the foundation for an amazing city block of lego goodness. for those new to this series of sets, check out my reviews of the two previous sets in this line: cafe corner market street i would not necessarily recommend reading too many of my reviews in one setting as you might experience loss of brain cells and/or drowsiness. you have been warned. so, how does green grocer stack up to the two previous sets you ask? well, follow along kind reader and i shall attempt to unravel this question. the box: the gigantic box is pretty standard and looks amazingly similar to the caf? corner box. the back of the box shows some of the features of the green grocer as well as a lot of the cool interior that was absent from the previous sets. in addition, we are shown an image of the three sets together and a small insert image showing how they connect together (as if we could not master that difficult maneuver?) opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals. as it seems to be the norm now, we have the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets. however, upon opening the tabs we are pleasantly surprised to find a cardboard tray! have not seen one of those in a while. as you can see in the photo, we have two 32x16 green base plates, three instruction manuals and a bunch of bags that are broken into four groups: group 1 has 12 bags and goes with the first manual and builds the first floor. group 2 has 9 bags and goes with the second manual to build the second floor. group 3 has 14 bags and goes with the third manual for the top floor and roof. and one bag that is not numbered and hence you can open it whenever you feel like it. there are no stickers ? yay! moving right along, we get to the three instruction manuals. the manuals: the three manuals are 55, 47 and 47 pages in length. they are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - piece call outs for each step - parts inventory at the end of the second manual - page numbers color separation in these manuals was fine for me except dark bley and black. we get a nice photo of all three sets together: plus, we get a nice tip showing how to split up the bags and what goes where. those additional pieces you see in the photo just below the numbered bags are the pieces that come from the single un-numbered bag (along with the base plates). parts list random manual shot the pieces: upon opening the first set of bags, one thing is clear; there are a ton of little tiny pieces! the minifigs are included in this first section as well. interesting to note that there are a handful of printed pieces and as i mentioned previously, no stickers. we also get a host of new and exciting pieces to add to our collection. keep in mind my scope of lego sets is generally centered around star wars, technic, creator and the occasional racer set so what is new to me might have been around 15 years. at any rate, here are some of the more interesting pieces: again, note the printed tiles. this time around, lego has decided to include 33% more minifigs than the caf? corner and market street sets. yes, we get four minifigs instead of three! here are the cast of characters: pictured (left to right) is sir top hat, miss jenny blue overalls, patti o? furniture and little timmy cub scout. i?ll leave it up to the minifig aficionados to decipher which torsos are new and to tell us all about the hairpieces. i can say with reasonable certainty that the four yellow smiley heads are not new (somebody check that?) don?t forget the lovable little cat named ?tom?. he is the arch-rival of the mouse ?jerry? that lives downstairs: overall, there are a lot of pieces, large variety and wide range of colors. the build: if you have either of the two previous sets, you will feel right at home here. just like in the previous builds, it seems like the first ten build steps are consumed with laying a bunch of 1x1, 1x2 and 2x2 tiles everywhere. almost feels like 30% of the pieces are used up right away (see below). there are several sections where you build various parts of the interior. take a look at the cash register/counter below: and the beverage cooler: and the produce stand and everything that goes in it: looks like someone has mail: looks like someone just had a baby: this set is incredibly well done and gives inspiration to go back and add similar items to caf? corner and market street. as before, the average builder is introduced to some new building techniques like using the hinge plates to make the angles on the front of the building as shown below: also the top of the roof shows some interesting ideas: overall, it is a really fun build that kept me entertained the whole way. the design: this is a great set with lots of little details. i especially like the little mouse hole in the wall leading to the jerry the mouse?s area. they even included a little slice of cheese! it seems the designers can?t get away from the ?usual? staircase which i always feel is way too big. maybe future designs can incorporate a spiral staircase to save room for other things in the model. one welcome addition is the fire escape as seen below: i?m going to show a bunch of examples of various items in the set so you can get the feel of the amazing detail in this design. take a look at the lamps (torches?) just outside the door: and the streetlight with fire hydrant: brickwork and archway: awning: here is the back side of the building. note the trashcans and yard tools: here is a close-up of the railings on the second story balcony and the second photo is the finished product with curtains in the window. nice use of cups to make the banister on the second floor: here is the fireplace on the second floor: second floor staircase with tom?s hiding spot: check out the radiator on the third floor: more third floor: nice grandfather clock and rug (third floor) check out the deck that is up on the roof. complete with two chairs, table, umbrella, flower pots and grill: interesting use of minifig hammers on the roof: finally, here is what is left over when we?re done: a couple of shots of the front: a shot of the back: and here are all three together: overall thoughts: this is an incredible set and the best of the three in my opinion. it is hard to top caf? corner but i believe green grocer just did. i absolutely love all the details and building techniques that went into making this set. there is a ton of different parts and wide color selection. as usual, we get a bunch of tiles and small plates, but that goes with the series. also, we get four minifigs and lots of minifig accessories. i?m giving this set a score of 100%! i thought about it and i really don?t know how they could have made it any better. in short, run don?t walk to go pick this set up! final rating: 100% build 10/10 (excellent - lots of nice interiors, details and accessories to build.) functionality 10/10 (outstanding. raises the bar with interior and detail. think caf? corner on steroids.) design 10/10 (excellent ? can?t say enough good things about it.) parts 10/10 (great selection and diverse colors. great minifigs.) price 10/10 (price ratio is excellent but lots and lots of little parts. well worth the price.) as alway, feel free to comment, complain and question what you see here. i'd like to hear your feedback on this amazing set.

4 wow! that's a great review i'm glad you took so many pictures, this set is far better than i ever expected it to be, the detail inside is great. is it the first set you'e given 100% to?

4 a great reveiw dunamis *y* . you have only backed up what i thought when the pictures first appeared, if you are a lego fan there is no excuse not to buy this set. it is a must have! i love the mouse hole and the mouse and his cheese *wub* .

4 damn you to hell dunamis >:-( now tks to you i really want the 3 sets put together x-d wow that is what i call a sweet review 8-? tks for taking the time to make once again such a fantastic one ;-) the overall look of the building is brilliant and i love the nice additions they did: the cheese and mouse (jerry :-d ) is hilarious !! i didn't know green grocer had a rodent infestation !! and the use of the new built furniture and detils like the radiator is freaking awsome !! also that set has a definite plus for me: its the back details !! i love the stairs, the deck with table !! wowx that is what i call sweet backdoor details !! now its clear that i will need to buy the 3 sets asap !! tks once again dunamis ;-) *yoda*

4 *runs to lego store in bluewater...* m.

4 what a beautiful set, tlc give the designer a pay rise immedietly. i was lucky to order one of these while they were on sale to us aussies ;-) but dont worry lego the $100 you saved me will be spent on more sets like this. carn't wait to watch my kids rescue residents in distress from those upper level windows with the fire fighters.

4 truly an awesome review. thanks dunamis. i ordered my two copies (one to build, one to store in the "vault") last week. can't wait to get this one! the attention to detail here is what makes the set great. there's nothing to criticize about this set. it's really the closest thing to perfection that i have seen from tlc. the difference between this set and cc is the interior detail, and because of that, gg now become (in my opinion) the best set ever released by tlc. do the cc/gg/ms sets fit well with the 50th anniv. town plan? my impression is that out of the box, at least, they don't. which is too bad. however, i don't think it would be hard to mod the town plan so it looks like it belongs in the same town as cc/gg/ms. these sets, to me, are what i have always wanted from tlc as an adult. i hope they keep up the line, and add more elements to this excellent lineup.

4 wow,, thanks for the nice review! i have the other 2 sets and waiting for this to come to our shores. stupendous design and details! i really like the "hammer-rails" on the roof. cant wait!!! *wub*

4 o. m. g. i must have that set!! :'-) *y* *wub* i remember you telling me that you were going to do a review of this set, and i was so anxious! i love these reviews! thanks so much! great pictures. *wub* *y* *y* this will dent my wallet. 8-| i am so envious!

4 a very informative review, indeed. thank you so much for doing so. now i know that the price is worth every penny leaving my pocket. ;-) what do you guys think is tlc putting up as the next modular set? is it asking too much of tlc to produce 1 modular set each quarter (4 times a year)?

4 a million thanks for this review. this is greater than i thought. i especially like that clock. i'm going to get this set as soon as possible.

4 thanks for another fun review! this set is high on my list of things to buy, i love cranes, built many and bought many including the classic 8460 from 1995 and the more recent 8421. that threaded axle never stopped intriguing me... it was use in so few sets (i believe 8851 contained one as well?) and i still don't know why it's better than any other axle. congratulations with a near mint copy of this set! :-)

2 blakbird, on mar 10 2008, 09:45 pm, said: i wrote about it here: http://www.ericalbre...1984.html#parts eric thanks for that information, it opened my eyes as to the function of the threaded axle! :-)

2 this was my first pneumatic set

2 hi! this is my third (old-school) technic set review! i don?t want to talk much, please enjoy just the pictures! #1 the parts: #2 building: the two axles, you can see in the middle, are not connected and don?t belong to each other. the axle on the left side is for the steering, on the right side for the engine. the dark-gray ?technic gear 16 tooth with clutch? allows the connection from the differential gear to the engine, trough the axle for the steering. the v6-engine: the winch: that?s a part you don?t see everyday: a 1x2 rack. it only reappears in 2 sets from 2001 and 2004. (the rebel wrecker has been released in 1994.) the ?front double wishbone with anti-sway bar?-suspension (yeah, i got it from technopedia! x-d ) the finished model: #3 random shots: i really like this picture! authoritative, isn?t it? 8-? :-d thanks for viewing the pictures! please comment if you want to!

4 thanks for reviewing this classic set. i got it when it first came out and still love it: the suspension, steering and robust look of the model haven't been done that well ever since. this set puzzled me though, back in the days. the rear suspending part containing the differential and some gears was shown different on the box from the instructions. in the instructions it showed that the (grey part of the suspension) in the back had to be made using a 1x2 smooth tile and 4 cornerplates (2x2) in grey. the box however showed a much sturdier solution using a 1x8 tile and a 1x8 plate. it is also visible on the cover of the instructions. the pieces i mean are in this picture: bernddasbrot, on mar 9 2008, 07:05 pm, said: otherwise, great set!

2 thanks! you've just motivated me to go on a "senseless-preliminary-design-errors-hunt"...! a few things i've discovered: left side (alternate model): the steering link can only be put in place with a little violence... the handlebar (?) is turned (far more than it's actually possible) although the wheels are straight. right side: the 1x8 tile simonwillems pointed out the half bush right next to it is... *can't_find_the_words* ..."wrong". could be that the technic triangle is missing. the "windscreen"- 1x6 technic plates are mounted with 1/2 pins instead of axle pins with half bushes. who can find more...? x-d

2 bernddasbrot, on mar 10 2008, 01:41 pm, said: at my school leaving examination i made a model in blender3d and explained to the board of examiners how to build a car and how to animate it. it needed a color, so i took red "because all beautiful and fast cars are red..." my physics teacher contradicted. :-) did you use ferrari to prove your point? any physics teacher would have to admit that a really fast car, approaching the speed of light, will always look red as it drives away due to red shift!! x-d on the other hand, 8880 looks pretty fast and it is black, although i have seen pictures of one that someone built in red. yellow might be good too. some cars even look fast in green. eric

4 reread your review today! great pictures! this is a fabulous model. got this model a few months ago for just € 25! it is small and has great working parts. i love the way the front-suspension is made! epic! i only had the light-stickers replaced with trans-clear bricks. btw: the gear rack has been used in this years 8048 buggy!

4 i read blackbirds technopedia page on this truck the other week, went onto ebay and picked up a misb copy for £25 gbp bargin, great to get old sets unopened, peeling the plastic off of the specialist parts was always cool! love the front suspension

4 somehow i also managed to get this set in very good condition (including box, instructions and all stickers) for a mere €22 a few months ago. this is indeed a very special set, and was a pleasure to build. the only flaw i noticed was weak support of the rear drivetrain, which was easily corrected with a few extra plates.

2 junkstylegio, on mar 23 2010, 11:17 pm, said: huh? like where? don't have that much problems with that rear train. (at least if i you don't trow the model down the stairs or something like that...) maybe it's unusual, but this section of the drive train didn't hold that well on my model: this is how it looks now: the parts made redundant were left in the built model, that's why there's that useless 8-tooth gear there :p

4 thanks for the great review vbbn! *y* i already own 2 of these x-d on your camera there should be a little flower sign, switch to that to go to micro mode ;-) it's a really good first review *y* *sweet*

2 thank you for your nice review, vbbn! *y* but it only confirms: this theme is not my cup of tea. weird aliens, strange colors, parts stuck together with no idea. :-| i always hated this big wheels - it?s even worse in orange. :-x saving money for different sets on! (and that doesn?t mean it was a bad review ;-) )

4 thanks for the review! i do like this set, though i am not a fan of the jelly aliens, though the alien ship looks good with the curved parts and flip open and close design!

2 pictures of my restored set 8829 (i was almost 96% complete, and for missing parts i add of my own) the seat is black and not blue (as one was missing in my 8858) the spoiler is different, steering wheel added (not connected to wheels) and some additional items to make it look better) this is how i change the tire orientation the "new" rear spoiler: i still need to "clean" front rims edited by aow, 26 november 2015 - 12:32 pm.

4 nice review the set doesnt seem as good as the crystal hawk and there colouring mistake with gun is just well bad and not the kind of thing i expect tlc to do something that stupid edited by pencoin, 03 june 2008 - 04:51 pm.

2 as i mentioned elsewhere, i couldn't see a review for this and though it's only small, let's strive for completion! here's the box: the contents: the parts: leftover bits: and the set: not much to it i know, and not much of a review, but there you go...quite a lot of stuff with the copper though. dr. s.

4 big or small we all love our legos, and for that i thank you for the review. i would have had liked to see your opinions though, about the price, the playability, or anything else you'd care to share about it and perhaps how it fits with your collection. i've always been hesitant about getting this set because to me i feel like i have it all already, but i'm missing that dog, radar gun and, 50 mph sign :-/

4 a very neat and useful little set, thank you for the nice review. *sweet*

2 hi! this is my forth pre-old-school review. as promised: a yellow-set ! my 8862 arrived today, survived the washing machine coaster and actually was real fun to build! #1: information: this set contains 664 parts (only! i thought i’d be far more!) and was released in 1989 in the technic theme. be sure to visit technopediaif you want to know more! #2: building instructions: wow these instructions are used! i'm not used to this after all this sets with unread instruction booklets... the pneumatics page: the last step for the alternate model: #3: the parts: wow! look at all those technic beams, gears, pins...! (a few parts are missing in this photo!) #3: building: the left worm gear is for the outriggers, the right one for turning the “rear boom” the three 12l axles: left one: outriggers, middle one: steering, right one: erm… rear-boom-rotation. the two worm gears in the front part: left one: lifting the bucket, right one: dumping the bucket. the turning-mechanism for the “rear-boom” is finished. once again a toothed 10l axle. the boat weight 2x6x2 is hidden underneath the radiator grill. okay… many hoses and a nice, comfy seat have been added. now you can recognize the backhoes real shape. only with a little violence it’s possible to lift the bonnet (?) through the pneumatic pump. yeah, outriggers. same technique that the 8854 uses. the finished “boom / jib / scoop thing” (=bjst) :-| x-d the finished loader bucket. and to end the building process: the same picture from the introduction. (off-topic: “it is all part of the miracle of nature! - the circle of life!” #4: functionality: this time, i tried something new! i hope you can spot something - if not: technopedia! okay, here we go. #5: random shots: i’ve got way too many pictures this time, so i refer to my brickshelf folder. until it’s moderated you can follow the multilingual links! eins deux three quattro fem zes sédem osiem #6: final thoughts: definitely worth buying! as a child i thought it looks hideous - but today i’ve found out it’s totally fun to build and freaking functional. three things i want to mention though: the bjst can only be slewed (a new word!) if the outriggers are deployed. it is also possible that the bjst will reach the ground (danger of grinding or sticking) even if the outriggers are deployed. the two mechanisms for the loader bucket can actually interlock, and the 14 tooth gears might break / disentangle from the axle. thanks for viewing the pictures, i hope you enjoyed it! please comment if you want to!

4 a great review for a great set! it even had the old technic t-pieces and bevels, which i actually prefer to their modern counterparts. cp5670, on mar 24 2008, 08:14 am, said: the turntable on the back doesn't turn very well though, as the weight is all distributed on one side. the screw axle prevents it from popping off but there is still a lot of friction in it. i got mine for £20 in a second hand shop; it said complete, but one of the screw knuts was missing! x-o so it's practically impossible to keep the back arm on with only one |-/ and they're rather rare on bl too |-/

2 yeah, i meant they're rare. ;-) but i can imagine that a normal axle with the old half bushes will help. sometimes these are really strong; if you put 2-3 in a row? edit: i just tried it: a normal 10l axle with 2 interlocking old half bushes type 1 on each end. (i chose those who only can be moved very hardly along an axle.) i slewed the bjst / back arm a few times tried the pneumatics parallel to it and it didn't loose. edited by bernddasbrot, 24 march 2008 - 06:06 pm.

4 by the way, don't forget to build the alternate model of 8862. it is a combine (farm equipment) which is just as good as 8274. i liked it so much that i bought two copies of this set so i could display both. my favorite alternate model (not counting universal sets) is the 8480 submarine. maybe it is time for a white set review? *skull* white is pretty rare. for your blue set, i recommend you review 8462. there are only a couple of green sets, and 8479 is the best. and then of course, 8458 is silver!! i think we all know what the best black set is. and according to your photography, you have lots of them! but don't forget 8868. eric

2 quote how long of a shutter speed did you use? 15 seconds. quote by the way, don't forget to build the alternate model of 8862. i will review it too and post it in this topic! quote "slewed"? i think that's a word. how about "slewn" or "slain" or "slewifacated"? i think "rotated" is best. actually i took it from your site! x-d quote white is pretty rare. unfortunately i don't own 8480 but i think 8824 is also a very good (though small) white set! 8462 rocks as a blue set. i just got it a few weeks ago. let's see... 8462 also is one of the last technic sets i would call old-school. 8479... okay too, but 8458 is imho not. 8868 and the totally mysteriously black set will follow...! quote i was thinking you could somehow attach a 16-tooth dark gray gear (the one that spins freely around axles) to the nut, which would make the axle move in and out when the gear turned and convert the gear's rotary motion to linear motion in a fairly compact package. did you had something like this in mind? if the toothed 10l axle rotates the axle nuts want to rotate too but they can't because of that 2x4 technic plate. so they'll decide to move along the axle. the 1x6 bricks on each end make sure that the axle won't move in or out. thanks for your feedback!

2 bernddasbrot, on mar 25 2008, 03:46 am, said: 15 seconds. wow, that's a long exposure. i would think you would get way too much light and overexpose the image. the aperture must have been tiny. quote i will review it too and post it in this topic! cool. i am also planning to write about the combine on technicopedia. combine quote actually i took it from your site! x-d i thought that word sounded familiar! quote unfortunately i don't own 8480 but i think 8824 is also a very good (though small) white set! 8462 rocks as a blue set. i just got it a few weeks ago. let's see... 8462 also is one of the last technic sets i would call old-school. 8479... okay too, but 8458 is imho not. 8868 and the totally mysteriously black set will follow...! you don't own 8480? that is unacceptable. it is imperative that you put a mortgage on your house immediately to get it! *sweet* yes, 8824 is a good white set. i also see from your room photos that you have the 8839 supply ship which has lots of white. this is a really nice set. 8462 is hard to call old school, but at least it uses regular beams. the air tanks are the best part of the set. i wish lego had used them more often, especially on the highly pneumatic sets. the tank makes all the difference on 8459. you are right, 8458 is certainly not old school, but it is a great set with wonderful suspension. it is of the same era as the super street sensation with all of the panels for body contouring. 8868 is technic at its best. there is nothing else like it, especially with the compressor. quote did you had something like this in mind if the toothed 10l axle rotates the axle nuts want to rotate too but they can't because of that 2x4 technic plate. so they'll decide to move along the axle. the 1x6 bricks on each end make sure that the axle won't move in or out. thanks for your feedback! while the assembly you have drawn would work as a linear actuator, i would not recommend it. the torsional stiffness and strength of an axle are proportional to the polar moment of inertia, a section property. most of the stiffness comes from the outside of the cross shaped axle. but in the threaded axle, you lose all the stiffness of the outer area because it is not continuous. this means you only get stiffness and strength from the small core. i think the threaded axle would bend and break very easily if subjected to much torque. eric

2 i'm very sorry for that doublepost... i made a picture for you, sinner, but forgot to upload it: your dad, patrick parrot, driving a giant backhoe. sadly his second job as photojournalist and the fact that bianca lamb was strolling by, distracted him. as a consequence he spoiled the whole construction site bringing death and doom with a technic backhoe to fabuland. and a little walrus baby. *y* :-p

4 a great review. i only have new sets, so looking at old ones like this is great. i would suggest multiple pictures blended together afterwards, instead of the long exposure pictures. bernddasbrot, on mar 23 2008, 11:32 pm, said: now you can recognize the backhoes real shape. only with a little violence it’s possible to lift the bonnet (?) through the pneumatic pump. aren't you supposed to fit the bonnet over the pump, and then attach it to the main frame ? front

4 29 times! great review, these are some sweet lookin' rides. :-d very similar to the other set, but still great. *y* thanks! ~peace

4 those are some beautiful cars, thanks so much for the review! *sweet* of the two, i like taejo's one best, as red is my colour. >:-) a perfect car for you and the bird to roll round in. :-d i like the windscreen pieces, they're new right?

4 a very good review, thanks generaltarful. *y* that´s an interesting set for sure, and especially the red car looks really fine. air intakes, very nice.... :'-)

2 speed racer go! >:-)

4 nice! it is probably the only speed racers set i will buy - and i will buy multiples! those cars look awesome.

4 speaking of pocket knives, i just got speed racer and snake oiler at k-mart and might mod the helmet so it actually looks like the cartoon. the problem is - i don't want to shell out two bucks for a clear visor! >:-( by the way, i know trans-clear visors are non-production, but where did they come from? a pick-a-brick? if so, what store? well at least if i do go through getting the elusive clear visor, it's not as bad as the insane $25+ red vader helmet! this set is great. i would have gotten this along with the one i purchased, but i didn't have enough dough with me to get both.

4 thanks for this review, it's a nice set with some cool pieces and nice techniques, i like the way the roof pieces are used to make the spiders back, for instance lasse d, on mar 26 2008, 09:48 pm, said: alternate models: 3 it is hard to come up with alternate models with so many small pieces and plates that are only 1 stud wide. the colors might make you want to build a spyrius space ship. ouch! that's not a good thing, let's refrain from that.... ;-)

4 enchanted island 6278 pictorial review original price: $66 pieces: 412 figures: 7 this 1994 set marked the beginning of a new era for lego pirates - it became a theme more centralised around playability and not so much grand ol' ships. 6278 enchanted island was the flagship set of the islanders subtheme, heavily based around polynesian and native american concepts (in fact, tlc was successfully sued by a number of tribes for using bastardised maori names, such as kahuka). it was released as a legend set in 2001, but due to poor sales was discontinued again. the largest of the islander sets, enchanted island is a portion of an island with a river running through. the left hand side features some sturdy buildings built into a tree-like structure on a rocky outcrop, whilst the left hand side features a tower built out of "wooden" posts and a large tribal statue. the box cover shows all the details; it does, however, differ from the instructions' finished product in that it has been more aesthetically arranged - bushes e.t.c. have been moved to fill in gaps and to not obscure other things. the sides of the box show nothing particularly special, although in one scene it depicts the islander canoe chasing the pirate boat with the treasure; just one way to play with the set. the back of the box, however, is superb, featuring a large number of alternative models: a toothy statue, a pirate tree (think wolfpack) with an islander base, kahuka's throne, a fire-breathing statue and a souped-up boat for the pirates. these, and many more, can be easily made because of the large diversity of pieces. the set has a huge number of minifigures for its size, the third highest number in the pirate range (the ses and the bsb being first and second, respectively) - a whopping 7! 5 islanders, including the all-too-common king kahuka, the elusive islander babe and 3 standard warriors - this set alone will never leave you short of enemies! 2 pirates, ironhook in his standard attire with a scurvy dog at his side attack the island, although they are only moderately armed - 2 cutlasses and a pistol between them; a musket would've been nice. the islanders, on the other hand, have 4 shields, a bow and quiver and 6 spears, not to mention the big pokey thing with horns on top (weapon? idol? staff?). a monkey, parrot and crocodile provide the obvious creature features, with a fair amount of gold to finish off. in the instructions, the goblet does not have the lid, although it does on the box; it's a nice touch anyway - adding a little more diversity to the monotonous treasure stashes. the pirates' boat is a nice 2 sail vessel, with oars for when the wind stops and a treasure map. the sails are similar to those in lagoon lockup, but with an extra front sail. it's an awesome little boat, better for raids than a rowing boat, but not too big that it can't sail up rivers. it can comfortably fit 2 men and, at a squeeze, 5. the sails are expensive if you buy them seperately; normally this won't be a problem, but they can cost aroun $5 each. the islanders' boat is a canoe with a sail and an outrigger to stabilise it. the sail is beautifully done, with 2 spars taughtening it. there is a clip for the rower to leave his weapon when at se and the mast can turn to get as much wind as possible. it's quite a top-heavy boat, but it doesn't look hideous and without the mast/sail it looks great. 3 islanders can fit in it, and more if they sit on the outrigger. the markings on the canoe are stickers, but they look fine and are probably more robust than markings for their job. furthermore, they're waterproof! *sing* kahuka's throne can be carried by 2 loyal subjects... ...or strapped to his pet crocodile! the clips on the side can be used to rest his weaponry, or hold spears for battle. the throne looks nice, although i'm not too sure about the blue against the red - i'd have prefered white as it would clash less... an overview of the island; it is built in 2 halves - left then right and then joined together loosley, so it can be seperated for transporting. around the back to the left and right, there are large open spaces that are great for battles - this set isn't so much about a large solid build, but creating a "village" - smaller structures linked by bridges. and the back... to the far left is a platform built onto the rock, with access from the river via a ladder. there's the standard islander drum with the lovely zebra-skin part (where did they get that?!). i've never understood the white flag - i was under the impression it was used for surrender... further along the rocky bank, there are some hinged palm leaves that swing upwards to reveal... ...the treasure! it's an ok hiding place; not the best place to hide it, right where the pirates sail past, but it feels fabulous; it fits right in. above it on the rocky bank is the main structure. it looks very disjointed when you build it (bricks all over the place), but once it's done it looks nice and rural, with leaves everywhere and the "balcony" where kahuka is standing. you get a nice roof made from 2 large palm leaves tilting down. around the back there's a slight shelter, a table for picnics and a ladder to access the upstairs. i was rather annoyed that it is so open, but the set is designed from just one perspective... to the left is the bridge to the other building... a nice, one piece bridge made of the softer plastic used for muskets and the post-1991 cutlasses. it looks good, but be warned! it tilts when you pull a pin, sending the pirates flying! this contraption is a good idea, but it is very stiff and so doesn't swing, even when burdened by a minifigure - you'll want to modify this bit if you get it. the other building looks like it is made out of posts and beams. they are all red; brown would have been better, but it would have added too many colours to the range, just like the use of black for trees in some forestmen sets. there are 3 clips for spare weapons; only 2 of these will ever be used when all the islanders are armed, but it gives the pirates scope once they've been disarmed...there's another nice palm tree roof on top. 2 ladders give access...there's a total of 4 in this set - worth getting, eh? although they're 5p on bricklink, for a kabob, they're like gold! at the top there's another hidey hole; the palm leaves lift up on hinges to show the treasure or hiding islander. it can be seen from behind, but this set is designed from one perspective only. nice cattlehorns too...alongside the slats you can see in the floor - 5 years later and it would've been a solid plate... the big statue is one of the main selling point of this set, alongside the tilting bridge - they're the action features shown in every catalogue at the time, but it is not really special, just original. the statue fits in with the theme perfectly - kahuka's mask, his shield and this statue all depict the same deity, which is a nice "collectible" idea. the back is rather plain, except the angled 1x1 bricks - a good touch. i'm not sure why there's a black brick in the back of the head, but this is easily remedied; it could even be done with a brick from this same set, just swapping the two over... aside from the head turning, the back can open to store sacred objects, or, in my opinion, prisoners, hence the gaps for breathing. either way, it's a lovely piece of architecture and deservedly a flagship element of the set. there's your standard cooking pot floating around, although a 1x1 yellow stud as human flesh (remember, minifigs are yellow, no matter what the licensed themes say!) is a superb finish. this set is a stunning set for both kids and afols who are just getting back into lego/pirates - it is a great army builder and, due to its release as a legend, is extremely cheap on ebay - you should be able to pick one up for £18, or £15 if you're lucky. for that you get a lifetime's supply of islanders, 4 ladders, some wall panels, 2 baseplates (one raised and both with rivers and printed vegetation around the edge), a ton of weapons, a fair quantity of standard bricks, but most of all, a heap of vegetation: this is an easy to buy set, with normally around 5 on ebay at any time, and is well worth it, for the parts, the play and the nostalgia! it can be easily modified; when used in conjunction with any other outpost, a much larger fortress can be made, especially if more rope bridges are used. if you pick 2 of this fine set off ebay (it'll still be less than the original price!), a huge complex can be constructed, giving you an instantaneous village for around £35. other information lugnet rating: 79/100 brickset rating: 4.3/5 bricklink price: new - $100 used - $54 edited by phred, 05 april 2015 - 08:04 pm.

4 excellent review! i really like this set and so i gave it a 5/5. this set is on my list to get. i especially like the speedy pirate boat, and the also very fast outrigger canoe with a sail. i don't think a small number of these cannibals will make much of an impact on gaming though, even if they get a bonus with spears. duke

4 slyowl, you're a legend! thank you for taking the time to do such a comprehensive review. you've captured enchanted island in impeccable detail and anyone who doesn't own this set should know it inside-out by now. i shall write my thoughts on the set itself, directly.

4 wow, that is one great review you made sly! i gave it a four, only thing i don't like is the raised baseplate. it does get you a lot of figs, two ships and some nice assecories, great set!

4 great review! i recently got this set for only 150 sek, around $17, and it´s really good!

2 here is a preview of my review of speed racer: grand prix race i will try to get a full review up later today pics (when public) sorry about the blur, i am not a great photographer. also if, there are any pictures you would like (that i haven't included), just ask

0 judging from your pictures there seems to be many interesting torsos and new fleshy heads but i don't think this set is for me. fueling my dismissal of this set is that i saw the trailer for this film at the cinema today and it looked pretty terrible! :-x thanks for taking your time to review this set though ricecracker! ;-) edited by casewindu, 29 march 2008 - 10:18 pm.

0 joey lock, on mar 29 2008, 07:13 pm, said: how comes the monkey stays yellow but not the people... :'-( it's a liscensed theme, so they are tan. where are these sets coming from? none appeal to me though. oh, and nice review! edited by ~vbbn~, 29 march 2008 - 11:43 pm.

4 thank you for the pics *y* i want a trixie impulse set *wub* and otherwise that little boy with his monkey. i like the print on his t shirt.

2 well...... thanks for your posting, but i couldn´t care less about fleshie minifigs or movie-accurate cars - or the cars at all. this set would really only go into my parts bin. therefore i need to know what parts are in there and if they are "cool" enough to go into an exo-force collectors parts bin.

4 speed racer is the action film.and he has formula 1 car but he is intersted in art of the race.

4 a great review, thank you. i do not know these old sets like this one, but it is very cool to see how they were made. i have an un-opened 8421, maybe i should do a small review of that when i get to build it. btw. boxes are expensive, so at a given price point, it's a choise between more bricks or nicer boxes. i have no doubt what most people would chose. front edited by front, 06 april 2008 - 10:21 pm.

4 great review! while i admit i wasn't into technic at the time this came out (i was a mere child, give me a break! :-d), i can see now why it was featured so much. from the booklets to display stands at toy stores and at my local lego center (when it was still around), this thing was everywhere! with your review, i can now truly appreciate all the details of the set. i got to admit, i can see the appeal now! that comparison shot you took is amazing. i love not only just how it included the little details such as the stabilizers, but also looks incredibly fun to play around with. great set and an even greater review!

2 thanks guys! @ sinner: i hope you refered to 8285 so my answer will match: 8285 is interesting: main model: american styled truck, alternate model: european styled truck. i don't think tlg produced many european styled truck. edit: i just found a wonderful moc-alternate on brickshelf: 8436 by industrialdesigner. if i got him right, he designed a few offical technic sets for tlg. @ all: promises, promises, promises... hm. and again it's ebay that's blocking me. i want to foreshadow my next review (although it'll take some time to make it): i know, you know. but please act inconspicuous until you'll can act very astonished...! edited by bernddasbrot, 09 april 2008 - 03:25 pm.

4 anger the woman in charge and thou shall have no dinner. great review, the sets looks good, and the retunr of the tent is something to be very happy about. and also, those giant camp-attacking ants look really great, they can be use as bugs in a tod spike and bug room diorama.

0 the new man hair looks like a wig!

4 i love this set! thanks for the reveiw!!! probably the only indy 4 set i'll get..

4 mhm...i really need this set! there are various things i’m interested in: the minifigs (hey, i still have no indiana jones figs!), the new hairpieces, a gold katana, a dark bley pirate cutlass (is this the first one?), a dark bley knife (could be useful..), those giant ants, yet another silver broad sword (you never have enough of those).....great parts pack indeed. shakar

4 great review; i will definitely get this, if not only for the hair but the ants, melee weapons, and new faces and torsos!

4 nice review indeed thanks for review all these new indianna sets just wondering did your set have a crate as im sure the prims has a crat with a banana in.

4 i simply that tent! i guess i´ll have to buy three of these just to make a proper expedition moc somewhen.... a great little set indeed, with marvelous new mf torsos and that new black feminine hairpiece´s also great and very useable for creating some characters related to the sixties and seventies. and finally a pan that´s not black and a knife in grey. that´s very handy indeed, the chrome one always looked a bit too shiny to me.... thanks for that sweet review, alex!

4 great set, i'll definitely get it. is there any sign of flesh on the soldiers, like at the collars?

4 nice little review here alex, i like your idea to make the aquatic car into one for a geologist! i really like the little details in this set such as the little petrol can and the propeller at the back of the car, a must buy in my view! thanks again!

4 must.....have......

4 sweet review again, alex! great pictures, i loved the little comic with the croc. you're quite right here too: alex54, on apr 16 2008, 09:17 am, said: yes you can use all those military things without creating an army in a layout: just put the violent parts out, and you’ve got nice things, like a biologist car in the case of the amphibious vehicle! without the gun, that vehicle is a nice little amphibious car with a tent (i assume) strapped to it, some tools, a spare tire... the little tree hut is quite cool, and a nice touch with the box in behind there. i love the design for those gasoline cans too. thanks again, alex! you're lucky to be getting these sets! ~peace

4 good

4 just like 7626 this is a must buy in my opinion. i just the amphibious vehicle,very nice for army building.

2 i cant wait for these!

4 excellent review alex. thanks for sharing. i can't wait to buy this set once available. i really like the dark green leaf pieces. i like the cave/temple which will look great in my jungle diorama. blending the dark green and light green works well for the vehicle. overall, a neat little set.

4 this is a great set!!!!!! it is probably my favourite indy so so far! great reveiw! although the set is great the price is greater have to get it on sale..

4 great review, thanks a lot for all the pics. i agree that this is probably the nicest set of the indy 4 wave. so much dark green and i love all the plant pieces. it's been ages since we've had enough pieces in a regular release to build nice forests so it's great to see 11 of the dark green leaves in one set and all the vines! the design of the cutter looks very solid and brick built as well. giant ants are great looking too.

4 thanks for the review alex i agree that this is the best set of kotcs sets (although the airplane comes quite close..). although i'm not too fond of the trees, the cave is good, and the jungle cutter is brilliant. plenty of great features, and very detailed, with much of the engine showing and a decent cockpit (if that's the right word..). the general and the two soviets are great too (could we have a close-up pic of them please? ), good to see that neither torso has exposed fleshy skin like the nazis. as said though, it is quite a pricy set, i was expecting it to be just over the price of race for the stolen treasure. great set, thanks again, alex!

2 here some close-up pics of the russian soldiers and the general : and i know that you have seen that i don't have put the stickers on...

4 ahhhhh now this swamp vehicle looks great to me, when i first heard lego were making it i was worried that it would be a poor version. however im pleased to see that it's not, even though i'm not a great fan of those treads. the trees don't really add anything to the set which is a shame, still the parts are welcome at least. the entrance is good though it could do with being bigger, but i guess we can moc that. i really like the commie general, he looks like a real bad megablocks

2 xwingyoda, on apr 16 2008, 08:42 am, said: whats that funky name lol! just making sure your yoda-ee awesomeness is known. yep indeed and i have that set if i remember correctly the first line to use it as vegetation is aqua raiders tiger shark attack (7773) a-ha; it was in aquaraiders! it was also the squid's intestines, or whatever lays inside his baggy head. why, its just a flick fire missile in a wrench i'll use my brickarms rgp which is way better oh yeah, i forgot that. ok so i just finished reviewing the instructions and look at the parts you need to just change the horrendous colours !! damn its really getting worse and worse ahh, thanks! i'm definitely changing them; they may be bearers of the red star but they don't need red lining inside their vehicles.

2 the thing and the set is called jungle cutter and the reason the front pops off is because indy blows it up with a bazooka incase you wanted to know. thanks for the nice review

4 here's a review of the second largest set in the dragon masters subtheme for castle month, dark dragon's den! figs: the set comes with 3 dragon knights, two of which have the dragon wings on their helmets(sad thing is, one of my knights was missing the left wing on the helmet). there are also the definitive dragon, wiz the wizard (or majisto if you prefer)two horses, and a hawk( try to find him in each picture!) the set: there's a large spot under the mountain for the dragon to guard the treasure chest. the chest has 2 red and green 1x1 circles in it. another gate in the back, along with a door for knights. the right side of the mountain has a ladder and a removable rock face. the left side has some stairs leading up to the top. i love this tree design. simple yet effective. a shot of the top- hey, what are you doing?!? no!! throw him in the dungeon! overall: this set when first released in 1993 was priced at $43usd, although that might just be because of the juniorised pieces (6 burps!). it's a fun set that provides excellent playability. if you can find it at a $20-$30 price point, pick it up. overall grade: 8/10 edited by kimt, 10 august 2008 - 01:33 pm.

4 this is around the time that many consider the decline of castle, in which point i somewhat agree, but admittedly it still looks like a very playable set, and the tree is very well done. thank you for the review!

4 yay, go dragon masters! i have to agree with iamded, i do like the black knights sets better for their design ( betrayal! ), however, the dragon knights are just awesome, 'cause they have dragons! this is a nice set, with some awesome minifigs and a nice overall design. i wish i had it... go masters!

4 great classic dragon den! i love the old green dragons very much! there were my fave. i love these theme very much after the black knights era. this is a very very good set! i wished i can have this too.

4 this was the last castle set i got before my dark age.. really liked it although the big rock parts looked really bad ( i am kind of used to them now) unfortunately i lost the little wand.. and i never understood who is "good" and who is "bad" does the wizard own the dragon? well they dont seem to be enemies but isnt the dragon supposed to be evil??

2 i saw this set at my tru for only $20.00. now i might go get it! thanks sinner for another nice review! quote hoped to find a figure the right size for it, but none of mine would fit. well, just sit your booty down and ride it wourself... ... okay, well, maybe if you have a bionicle lying around or a halo figure.

2 how did i manage to miss this review? i must have overlooked it somehow... thanks for making this one sinner, it's always nice to see reviews of technic sets. i'm not so sure whether i like this set, i am not that much into motorbikes, but lego did a good job on this one. it looks a lot like an upgraded version of one of the first bikes lego made, namely the 8838 shock cycle. i also believe the back gearwheel is somewhat oversized, it looks better with the smaller one you attached. it is good to see that lego is back to making the technic sets the way they were (except for the green, that is )

2 sinner, on may 18 2008, 05:18 am, said: you must have been ignoring me! it's been in my signature for weeks! this is when shame kicks in...

4 i wasn't very interested in this set at first. it seemed to be just a nice looking truck with a small motor... but when i found out it had a transmission i changed my mind! here is the transmission. it allows the single motor to be used for two functions. this system has been around for a while, and lego seem to be using it more and more. the transmission driving ring alone (the red circle) goes for $5-15 usd on bricklink, and you also need the catch and clutch gear so i have been buying sets that have them instead. i now have enough parts to make a supercar gearbox. (i bet a new supercar comes out next year now...) this is the gear that rotates the arm. note the colour of the 24 tooth gear; it seems to be a new gear trend. a lot of work has been put into this truck looking real. personally i think they went too far as the truck seems to have been designed for a tilting cab, but it's disabled to prevent breaking the front. bottom of the transmission. the bottom shaft lifts the arm. note that there are more dark grey gears. the motor fits in very well also. the bottom of the arm. i was surprised by the usage of a 12 tooth bevel to link with the 36 tooth double bevel as i had never seen that done before. as you can see there is no room for any drive train. standard steering for a recent technic truck. there is a hand-of-god at the cab top that links via two knob wheels. it looks good from the back. you can also see the white clutch that connects the transmission to the motor to avoid burnouts. it goes decently high, and can go a bit higher if you use the crane arm. compared to last years fire truck. (if i didn't buy the fire truck for half price i would have been annoyed that lego brought out what is almost a motorised version of the same set.) functions: cherry picker arm: motorised rotate and lift that links to a motor via a transmission and anti-burnout clutch. steering: rack and pinion controlled via a hand-of-god linked by knob wheels doors: open and close. good functionality that works well, but i wish they made the cab lift and i'm a bit sick of the lame fairing door trick. 7/10 parts: motor, battery box, transmission, clutch, practical wheels, only two fairings, compact turntable... this is a great parts set. 10/10 price: at $99.99 aud for 726 parts it's ok value when you consider what you are getting. the us price is $60.00 which is better, but still not great. i bought mine for $80 aud which was good however, and i suspect that the price is designed for easy sale...8/10 looks: i'd buy this for the looks alone! 9/10 fudge: the functions work well and i llked it more than i thought i would. oddly mine seemed to be missing a axle pin with friction, but since it includes extra parts for the alternate model i didn't mind using one of my spares. on the subject of the alternate model, it is a dump truck which is made out to be a total re-build, but it isn't. it could have easily been done like super street sensation was, but lego have probably determined that instructions like that confuse people. 8/10 overall: recommended. 8/10

4 thank you for that fine review of a pretty cool and nice set with a very good amount of functionality and, um, playability, for sure.

2 thanks for the review! i think i am going to get this set for it's many technic pieces. i could really use those for a rig i'm going to build.

2 wow, it's a smarty set with drive shafts (we are everybody!) and technical junk. the specs and stuff kind of lose me but the walrus looks really cute in the cherry picker! i imagine he's saving a kitten. but really, this is a great review and has a wealth of detail and knowlege for techni-philes! thanks for providing such a cool resource for eb! i really did enjoy delving in to the world of technic for a few moments. the walrus rides it ... oh, he's so smart.

4 svelte_corps, on apr 30 2008, 10:44 pm, said: and what everyone's been waiting for, the skullies - three of 'em and a conquistador skellie - very cute. note the backs of the crystal head have a plume-sized hole - or maybe that's just where they injected the blue brain-plastic. spooky! i love these skulls, i wasn't sold from the initial pics but they have a very creepy smile and the head shape is just... weird. with the large eyes, it's kind of homer simpson-esque. they reminded me more of the movie "coneheads", but i think your description is more accurate. looking forward to the rest of the review!

4 the figs look great! the natives and the skeleton conquistador are my favorite figures in the set. the set itself is very good. the interior sort of reminds me of an older style lego set for some reason. it could be just me, but it has a classic feel. this will a great set to add to my list! great review! (so far, anyway. i only saw the back of the box!) edited by general zen, 01 may 2008 - 02:17 am.

4 thanks svelte_corps for the great review, if it's out in aussie then it should hopefully be reaching nz soon. i can't wait! this looks like a great set, for me at least. i too am a great fan of spooky old temples, they are such fun. i love the look of the base plate, but the stickers don't look all that great. i wish they printed it like they always used too. i have to get this set. and the other ones too. thanks again, you have brightened this sad day.

4 outstanding review! your efforts have totally convinced me to get this set no matter what! it really looks very great and funz reading that review. i will be looking forward to the new addition of those mini-figs. just love the layout of this temple. a great addition indeed

2 thanks for the reveiw it was a enjoyable and good one! i really like this set!!! too bad it's beyond my price range, i guess i'll just get the smaler set. what suprised me is that there is no giant ants i'm guessing you live in aus.? where did you get this set from???

2 great in-depth review!!! svelte, i love your cat! :) :)

4 i was going to review this on monday but my camera ran out of batteries! anyways, great review! as i have the set built, it's a really fantastic set. the waterfall is a reall cool sticker, and the flick fire missiles are quite interesting. another point of interest: there are seven of the new flick fire missiles overall, if anyone cares.

4 nice big set ! thanks for the review. the skellies seem to me as the only really big plus of the whole lot. i agree on the homer simpsons' paternity to them...

2 wout, on may 1 2008, 10:28 am, said: thank you for the nice review. off-topic: i heard something on lowlug that tlc cancelled 2624 (little set with indy, mutt, irina and tent). have anybody heard something about that? that would be not so nice. absolute hogwash. i wouldn't trust anyone on a forum i've never heard of. i don't believe they'd cancel it. it's still on s@h, right?

2 i brought this set a few days ago and agree with everything you say. i would have never noticed that the boat sticker is the set number unless you pointed it out. glad to see that one set of fuel can stickers was extra, i spent ages looking for a place to put them. cool review btw

2 nice review! although you need to use the macro setting(a.k.a. the flower setting) for better pics. are you using a digital camera? you really need macro... the idea is, turn it on and hold down on the 'take picture' button halfway until the pic focuses. then press it down all the way to take the pic. i'm glad this one also comes with the new uzi; i wanted an extra...

4 thank you for the nice, in-depth review! i have to say, lego did a good job on the amphibious vehicle. p.s.- if you need photo taking help, pm me and i can give you some handy tips.

4 an extremely thorough review - you definitely do this set justice. looks like a fairly interesting set, and that comes from someone who isn't particularly a fan of lego indiana jones. tom

4 while i truely fell in love one more time with the older lego city sets, i thought, why not make a review of one of the, in my opinion greatest city sets of all time. let's not talk too much, here we go! set nr.: 6395 name: victory lap racetrack number of minifigs: 13 (!!) number of pieces: unknown release year: 1988 starting with the beautiful old legoland box: front: back, with some cool alternative models: inside: we continue with the great minifigs, which are not less than 13! i don't think there is any city set with more figures, is there? civilians: race crew & assistant personnel: drivers: all: here's a overview of the whole set: the "rescue rig" (don't exactly know how to call it) with trailer: the score board & traffic lights, which would be one of the details i love the most about this set: the next sweet detail, the camera + cameraman! of course we have a doc, if there is some kind of accident: the pit stop boxes, i love the small tool-holder with the axle and wheel behind it: the control room high above the racetrack: ready to go?!! that was it all in all,all i can say is, if you see this set anywhere on ebay ore somewhere else, get it!

4 thanks for this review! you have reviewed my most favourite town set of all times, i am so happy to own this one. i actually is a story to go along with it: in the summer of 1998 i went on holiday with my parents to the country of luxembourg, in the city of wiltz we encountered a small toystore which still had this set for sale, (9 years after the release!). i did not had the sufficient amount of money to buy the set and had to leave it at the store, i was practically in tears... four years later we passed through luxembourg and i remembered the city and the store. we made a detour and stopped by the same store. every other old set was sold, the only one remaining was this one! i bought it immediately and treasured it ever since. i use the baseplates a lot in my cities, they serve well as roads with parking spaces next to them. this was the first set i owned which had the huge 6x24 plates in them, i remember my surprise when seeing plates of such enourmous lenght... i recently made an entire racetrack together with this set and to promote myself i will place a link here

2 wow simon you got two? yummy!

2 thank you for the nice review metalandi, and thank you for the nice story and selfpromotion simon willems. the racewaytracks were always nice dioramas in the catalogues of the eighties.

4 i can remember when i saw this set in lego catalogues, looking at it, dreamin to have it.... like so many other sets... and this one is still a dream... i really like the design of this set, it looks really complete, with some nice details. there are no lost place. the strairs withe the foot bridge add a lot to it imo. looking at the pics, i've got a question : is the "rescue rig" trailer one piece or is it brick build?

2 adik_sa_lego, on may 15 2008, 08:29 pm, said: wow simon you got two? yummy! i'd be happy if i had two... no, it's just one, but extended with the baseplate of 6381 (mentioned above) and some more plates and small fences. alex54, on may 15 2008, 10:20 pm, said: looking at the pics, i've got a question : is the "rescue rig" trailer one piece or is it brick build? it is one piece, not even the wheels come off... this trailer is always ready to go and was only used in a slecect number of sets.

2 thank you very much for that fine review of a really classic and wonderful racing set! and i really wish that tlc would continue with showing some great alternative models on the back of the boxes.... just imagine on!

2 warning! this reply may contain several minor movie spoilers. if you haven't yet seen the movie and want it to be a complete surprise, do not read. batbrick, on may 10 2008, 06:05 am, said: but it is cruncher block, his lady driver taejo that really shine. look at those awesome suits! the cool faces! taejo has a ripped shirt! i was originally skepitcal about the driver figure—i like the head, but i was trying to figure out why they put in a female minifig with no hairpiece. after having seen the movie, i now understand why; cruncher's driver is a fairly manly looking woman, and most of the lego hairpeices would make the minifig look too girly for the character. :) now that i know why taejo's shirt is ripped up i don't mind the bits of fleshie color that are printed on it, but i do wish they would make some of the new torsos a little more head-colour agnostic...there's no real reason why cruncher and his driver couldn't have had ties that came all the way up to their necks instead of having those little wedges of flesh showing through loose collars. yeah, they are low-level mafioso type scum, but they aren't complete slobs. batbrick, on may 10 2008, 06:05 am, said: front view, the new windshields are fantastic: they are indeed very nice, it's the main reason i started looking at the speed racer sets in the first place. batbrick, on may 10 2008, 06:05 am, said: while a very cool car, it is rather silly of tlc to give us the exact same one we got in the smaller set. i didn't get the smaller set with this car, so i'm still happy, but it is a bad marketing move: i think the error they made was in the smaller set though. in the movie, the only time we see cruncher's semi is when he's being chased by racer x. racer x and taejo do end up on the same team for a cross country rally race (along with speed of course), so i guess that's where they were going by putting those two together in the smaller set, but it would have been much more interesting for them to have made up a set with taejo and one of the cars from the very goofy, comic book-gimmicky teams they are racing against. especially since one of the teams (that is chasing taejo specifically) is a bunch of army-wannabee loonies—i'm sure more people would have loved some sort of dark/sand green racer with one of the ij soviets at the wheel than another racer x. to summarize: two racer x's is bad, but it is the smaller set that should have been changed (imho). batbrick, on may 10 2008, 06:05 am, said: annoyingly enough, this part opens up to shoot a pointless rubber projectile: thus blowing the front part open and launching it.....well, not far really as much as i normally don't like the stupid techic launcher thing, and would rather not see it in a set ever again (although one of these days i will make a giant multi-launcer rig out of them just for fun), at least there is a reason for it to be in this set, as cruncher's semi has a missile launcher in the front end of it in the movie. i think you're supposed to lift the panel that hides the missile before launching it, similar to the way that panels slide out of the way on the semi cab to allow for firing in the movie. batbrick, on may 10 2008, 06:05 am, said: and now for the most disappointing part - step three, the trailer: that's right, almost the entire thing is open, even the "filled in" side has holes! i'd certainly be cared to be back there, one bumpy hill and back you go i'm gonna chock this up to the standard lego philosophy of "playset" rather than "model" design for a lot of things. the semi rig and raver x's car are the models, the trailer is the playset. seeing as how the trailer is cruncher's mobile office (rather finely appointed with lots of paintings and his pirahna "babies" in their tank behind his desk), and the intent seems more or less to have a playest bit in order for kids to re-enact the scene from the movie, i'm not going to give them too much grief over this. they tried to capture the basic bits of the movie set (which we see mostly from the inside during the movie) and translate it into a playset type environment. that being said, i do wish the back walls were more solid, as i see no reason for there to be gaps in the back wall when the front wall (or the "fourth wall" as the case may be here) is already conspicously absent. batbrick, on may 10 2008, 06:05 am, said: there are some pluses too though, like the ridiculously awesome minifig paintings i'll be using for wayne manor. also note the "control" on cruncher's desk that when turned, turns the gun at the bottom. it's an alright feature: could have been a little better, but it's such a minor bit of this scene in the movie that i can see why they didn't spend too much time and effort on it. it would have been nice to have more paintings though, had the back wall been more complete (and i like your idea of how to use them :) ). batbrick, on may 10 2008, 06:05 am, said: and though i'm not a massive fan of stickers, this is just too cool. the little aquarium is very simple but very clever, using a printed piece between two clear windows to create the illusion of a tank: definately a feature which is not showcased nearly well enough on the box art. since it is one of the major features of this set in the movie, it's nice to see it translate rather well into brick. batbrick, on may 10 2008, 06:05 am, said: design: 2/5 - pretty poor considering the best part is available in a cheaper set, and only the front part of the truck looks cool, but still not truly awful. that may be a bit harsh (but not much) given what i've said further up this post, but it probably only deserves a 3 at best, so i'm not realy going to quibble the point. :) i still think that racer x should be exclusive to this set and a different car should be in the smaller set with taejo, which would have improved the cachet for this set overall. batbrick, on may 10 2008, 06:05 am, said: price: 2/5 - overpriced easily, but rogue shadow is worse! true...this should have ideally been about a $30 set (especially given the general awesomeness of the ij race for the stolen treasure set), unless they made the trailer a bit more detailed (better back wall, perhaps some drop down gun ports like in the movie) or at put least one (or more) of cruncher's goons in the set, then maybe i could agree more with the msrp. on that note: if i remember correctly from my visit to my local tru yesterday in search of the new ij sets (since local targets seem determined not to get them in stock yet), they had this set on sale for around $35 along with an offer for a coupon good for $7.50 towards the purchase of a ticket to the movie with any speed racer toy purchase over $25. i may be wrong on the sale price, but i know the ticket offer was there. so, if you haven't seen the movie yet, and are interested in this set, tru may be the place to go right now to get both at a slightly cheaper price. batbrick, on may 10 2008, 06:05 am, said: fun: 4/5 - the mere concept of such an open truck kept me playing with this baby for hours! so you did enjoy the playest aspect of the trailer, even though you didn't care for the design...looks like they didn't do too badly then on what they wanted out of that bit. :) batbrick, on may 10 2008, 06:05 am, said: overall i'm really glad i bought it as the minifigs are fantastic and the paintings and fish tank are cool. it's fun, stupid and downright ridiculous, but while not a great set by any means, certainly isn't as bad in the brick as it looks in photos. i was actually thinking about going and getting this set now that i've seen the movie and i understand what the heck is going on here more. your review has definately added an additional impetus to that notion. my pocketbook (does not) thank you!

2 thanks for that fine review, batbrick. the most interesting part of the set, for me, are the neat mfs.... the trailer looks really pretty skeletal. however.... it´s a nice little play set and´ll fit its purpose i guess.

2 nice review. good pictures, thanks. i think i may get a couple of the smaller sets, as i think these will become collectors sets in years too come, not sure this range will be that popular? love the minifigs though.

2 thank you for the nice review

4 i bought this set a few days ago and agree with what you have said about it. the trailer is fun to play with but just so plain. overall great review.

4 i really like this set: my favorite parts are the minifigs and x's car. vrooom!

2 nice review--i'm surprised these are out already. i'll probably end up passing on this one. even with the surprise. :)

4 good review. a must have for my batman collection. are these sets already out in germany?

4 it's on the way! and also the buggy!

2 ronan nissen, on may 16 2008, 10:05 pm, said: oh wait, is that torso dark grey or light grey? it's definitely dark grey.

2 great review, as always! although i know you don't take many pictures in your reviews(imho, ) but can we see a little more about the tumbler? is that little windshield down near the bottom front a third seat? what is in the framework of the back, behind the cockpit? i know there's a blunt shooter and flick fire missiles, but is it all framework?

4 a nice review of an interesting set, thanks brickbitz. a great new batman, a funny ice cream truck and a pretty detailed tumbler. and although i wish that vehicle would be just a bit smaller i almost wonder that it´s not even bigger, compared to tlc´s other batvehicles.... and well, the interior could be better too....

0 thanks so much dunamis for your awesome review . yeah i think tlc miss the cape, it would be cool to own one but when we were talking of the 2008 sets around july of last year i can remember someone said it would come with cape. finally is a little dissapoint tlc miss it . edited by darkrebellion, 16 may 2008 - 07:20 pm.

2 hey dunamis, think you can get a straight-on shot of the face? the red pieces inside the eye sockets are topped with trans-greenish-yellow studs which make his face look eerily alive and very close to his screen appearance. it's a nice little detail that seems to not show through on pictures i've seen of the set. the legs are a little wobbly. i'm scared that he'll be leaning too far forward in about 5 years

4 cool! i like the idea of using the hood as an organ! dunamis reviews on!

4 thanks for this very detailed review dunamis! didn't think that gg were that big he looks pretty good to me, but i'll save the 90€ for the upcoming cw sets

2 dunamis, on may 17 2008, 04:58 am, said: any, silly me, in my first set of photos above, i never folded in his ribcage (you guys gotta call me out on these things). you forgot to add the stickers to the chest plates too. jeremy

2 legoscum, on may 17 2008, 04:03 pm, said: you forgot to add the stickers to the chest plates too. jeremy yeah, i know. i mentioned it in the review that i completely blew past the other two stickers. if you look closely, you can see that the big grievous nameplate sticker is off-center as well. me and stickers don't get along...

4 hi all again. another one of todays special deliveries. i think personally this set is great. mars mission is really finding it's feet. 7646 etx alien infiltrator

4 thanks very much for the review brickbitz! i love this year's mars mission line, and though this is the weakest set, it is still a major improvement. the mech is very cool and well made, and the commander is one of my favourite alien figs ever. the alien ship is pretty good, better than last years ones but not extremely good either, but i still like the set. batbrick away!

4 thanks for the sweet review, brickbitz! that really is a neat little set, that walker is fantastic, most likely the best part of the set. though the alien craft does also look neat, and it's cool how it can fold down into aa walker. or rather, a sentry turret, seeing as it can't really move while in that mode. still, it's nice. my favourite part is the mini mining robot though. so cute! ~peace

4 thanks for that interesting review, brickbitz. the alien fighter looks pretty nice, nothing special but streamlined and fast nevertheless. that transforming feature´s a nice addition for sure, and these new flicker missile with its launch apparatus.... hmm, i hope i won´t spend quite some time in search of that little 'rocket' piece.... however, there´s still something i miss with these alien crafts.... i don´t know.... i like some more organic looking design, and they even come in some nice and different shapes, but still.... perhaps a real space fighter just needs a solid cockpit, cool windscreens and controls to satisfy my odd likings. that 'exo suit' looks really good and i wonder why it´s a little underrepresented on the box art. the jet pack/space scooter´s a really good idea, and the only thing i hate´re those darned studless technic beams.... it could look so much better with a studded version of these parts. but of course that´s only due to my personal preferences.

2 damn!!! i was just about to post a review on this here's the infiltrator with the nice shiny holographic stickers! [attachment=2232:mars_mis...tor_tiny.jpg] edited by the rancor, 18 may 2008 - 12:59 pm.

2 my first impression upon seeing this set was "no thanks", but now i'm warming up to it. still, i'll skip it if it interferes with my hypersonic operations aircraft fund. :p

4 hi y'all! guess what happened today? when walked into my toys 'r' us in fullerton, ca, just to buy a simple tiny turbo racer, what do i see? all the agents sets sitting on the shelf, ready for the taking! i didn't have too much money with me, so i just got 2 of 8631 mission 1: jetpack pursuit! it's a really cool little set, so i thought i'd review this puppy for you! i shall proceed in the order of the instructions. so, let's get started! the minifigs let's begin with the minifigs, saw fist and agent chase! they are really cool, some of the coolest minifigs i have seen in a while! i took off saw fist's wig & chainsaw so you can see his head and cybernetic arm better! here is a back view of saw fist, and - surprise! agent chase has a double sided head! one side with his cool "mission face" with sunglasses and headset, and one with his casual bruce wayne type face (note, though, that it is not really the bruce wayne face). his wig, btw, is mutt's hairpiece in black! very neat! poor saw fist seems to be forced to always drag his chainsaw around for it is way too long to just hang down from his shoulder like a normal arm. the snowmobile next up, we have the snowmobile, a sleek little vehicle with only minor design flaws! the container with the jewel is attached to the vehicle by a single stud, so it doesn't fall off, but is easy to pick up! in the pic below you can see the only two tiny design flaws: thanks to the exhaust pipes, the laser cannon (or whatever it's supposed to be) can't be lowered any further than this. also, the corners of that slope-ish piece that the handle bar rests on are sticking out a little at the sides. other than that, it's pretty well done! the jetpack finally, there is the jetpack! imo, a name like autogyro-pack or something would make more sense, but whatever. although a little bulky, the jetpack is very well designed! the rotor can be tilted back, and at the lower back of the jetpack, there is hook with which you can grab the container with the jewel from the snowmobile. what i like best about the jetpack is that although it is attached to the minifig in kinda the same way as that of the riddler, this one doesn't rotate around. so, the agent is being held in place steadily! "see ya later, chainsaw-cyborg-dude!" stickers this set comes with a surprisingly large sticker sheet. the reason is that half of it are extra stickers! there are two large agents logos and one inferno logo - perfect for agents mocs! there are also a star and a small, round sticker portraying the number of the mission. the star seems to be part of some kind of game where you collect the stars from all sets on an agents id that you get from the mission 5 set. i don't know, though, if you get any gain from this except for becoming a full-status lego agent! below, you can find the list of parts from this set! click here for a better quality pic! that's pretty much it! i hope you liked this review and will run straight to your next toy store to get one or more of this set! this was my very first set review! so any questions, comments, or requests? any more pics you want me to take? would you like me to exchange the chainsaw with something else, or do you want me to try the agent's new hairpiece out on another fig? if so, just tell me! see ya! edited by oky wan kenobi, 25 june 2009 - 08:21 pm.

4 thanks for the excellent review oky! judging by this set, the line is going to be promising. i really like the figs and i'm glad to see that robot arm is actually a new arm mold. awesome!! can a minifig hand fit in the end or just the chainsaw attachment? could it fit an exo-force robot claw? there's a lot of detail in the torsos and i like that the agent's suit is like a moto-cross uniform. i love that the snowmobile has a working tread. copmike, ras and i tried to build a snowmobile with working treads, but we ended up using chainsaw blades in the end. great work oky!

2 that's a great review for your first one. i think the jet pack if far to bulky it could do with some minimising but that’s life. i assume that you can’t fit a standard hand in the chainsaw arms are the hole would be to large but would you be so good as to confirm this for me? overall i quite like the jet ski and the ability to lower the arms to much doesn’t both me. how much was it just so i can get an idea of the price? finally thanks for posting this review so quickly.

4 this is much much much more promising than the 2008 batman set for $10.00. the vehicle looks like someone took time to design it, but the batman one looks like . lego dear lego, where is the quality for batman??!?! i really like the new cyborg arm, and the propellers on that thing : ), it is a really promising line although i would get rid of all those bionicle pieces.

2 this set looks wicked! thanks very much for the sweet review oky wan! the pics are perfect, great quality and the perfect size, well done! this sets got everything, a new hairpiece, tank treads, a gem, well, i could go on but you can all see everything from the great pics. thanks again oky! this is one set i'll definately be getting! ~peace

4 what a lovely set, thanks for that fine review, oky wan kenobi! the mfs´re wonderful, that helipack looks solid and well done and i especially like the slightly asymmetrical design of the neat snowmobile. a very playable little set for sure, and the most interesting part´s for sure that new cool mf arm....

2 they are already on the shelfs? that's kinda weird, since there aren't even the instructions online yet

2 yay, oky wan! wow, the agents line is looking good so far. the jetpack is pretty nice, and the minifigs... my dad was in portland just yesterday, and if i'd have called an hour sooner, he might have been able to get to the tru...

2 thank you.

2 thanks for the review! do i see a little indy hint on that map? oh and btw., the map looks like it actually is printed am i right?

4 not many words this time, but as they say: a picture is worth a thousand words - and your pictures are lovely! once again, agents is turning out to be a cooler and cooler theme with each new review. this set looks like an awesome parts pack, and i love the bike! btw, anyone else notice the possibly accidental reference to alpha team? agent charge is back, it looks! edited by grevious, 21 may 2008 - 09:05 pm.

4 a really cool playset, thanks for these great pics, sirnadroj! a silver jaw helm, cycrocs, some cool faces and a very swooshable bike.... see you later, alligator! the only thing i don´t get entirely´re these neat barbwire circles. what´s the purpose with these.... life rings for masochists? well.... that makes me look at that tower in a completely new way too.... baddie´s baywatch on! but where´re the girls?

4 wow, thanks for the great review, sirnadroj! the overall set is what attracted me in the first place, that elevated hut and swampy setting just sucked me right in! it all looks really nice to me, a definite buy. that agents head would make a great indy, for those opposed to fleshies. and that monobrow, i mean, villain guy looks very... er... well, the monobrow is unique, thought i noticed the suit looks a bit skin tight in the crotchal area. don't look at me like that, you saw it too! anyway, the helmet's the best part about the villain, great for warhammer 40,000 orks. ~peace

4 very useful pieces, that new agent head (i think it's new) could be used for a gordon freeman minifigure, and break jaw's head for otis the security guard when you take his donuts away from him.

4 thanks for the review. i the bike and the bad guy's helmet.

0 agentrick57, on may 23 2008, 09:17 am, said: why do all of the reviews that we have for agents sets have the agents getting hurt? is this a new trend? no, it's an old trend. and it's because villains are cooler. actually, it could be long-simmering resentment towards the not-highly-regarded alpha team/ dino attack sets bubbling forth. see dr lucky's hilarious post here for an example of what i mean... i'm sure the new agents will learn to fight back soon

2 does anyone know if the turbo car chase is out yet?

4 i've copied another thing because i don't know how i must do a review. and i can't do long reviews! set ref: 7884 name: the buggy: the escape of mr freeze number of minifigs: 2 number of pieces: 76 price: 13,95€ front of the box: back of the box: the comic: very close: what's in the box: without: the set: the set with the box: the time: wow, this is a funny set, but it's a little expensive, and a little to small, but i like some pieces like the fire, and the mr freeze gun. and the best of all, here it comes, no stickers! that's one of the greatest things. but i understand why lego has made this set, some people want batman lego, and they are most of the time expensive, and the mr freeze set is also expensive, but this set not. if you want more pics, you msut ask! for exaple for the minifigs, or the mr freeze and the blaster. ask it, and this is my first review and sorry for the great and blurry pics! the final verdict: 7.5/10 figures: 8/10 playability: 6/10 build: 7/10 pieces: 7.5/10

2 thanks for an interesting review, ???theriddler???. the set´s cheap and very useful to get two fantastic mfs, a great mr. freeze and a very cool new batman. but i have to say that these two small vehicles just look plain ugly imho, without any inspiration nor orginality.... sorry, tlc, but you can for sure do better than that, and even with less pieces....

4 grevious, on may 23 2008, 09:54 am, said: indead. the only reason to get this set is if you couldn't afford the batcave back in 2006 and want a mr. freeze fig for a cheap price. and anyone who did get that kit really have no reason whatsoever to get this. i'll get it, i admit the vehicles are extremely poorly designed, i mean really poorly designed, but the mr.freeze fig is fantastic, and i would buy two of this set just for him, as his head and gear are very useful for mocing. it also comes with some nice pieces, like the grappling hook, little wheels, exhaust pieces and such. still, a pretty bad set build wise, but it has atleast inspired me to make my own batbuggy thanks for the review theriddler, appreciated. batbrick away!

2 as others have said, this really is a set for those that didn't buy the batcave. thus i want it! the cars are pretty horrid though... thanks for the review ???theriddler???!

4 neat little set. i do like the parts a number of hard to find bits all in one pack, depending on how much it costs in usd i'll have to consider it. and while the buggy designs kinda suck, i'm a little happy to see them, its been years since tlc made any small go kart style vehicles. i guess tiny turbos have been overshadowing that market?

2 thank you, the riddler! ) for this highly informative review. despite the fact that i still consider it to be one of the weakest sets in all batman line, i guess that now i may even get more than one of these for the same reasons as batbrick. ) good day, gentlemen! )

4 looks cool, one of the best in this line. cant wait for review!

2 the brick rat, on may 23 2008, 10:31 pm, said: 1)my set came with defective instructions. in 2 places pages are missing and duplicates of other pages repeated. for instance, the car instructions are missing steps 16-21. fortunately, i was able to make out what pieces went where in the missing steps by studying the illustration in step 22. i hope you have better luck with your instructions. everything was just fine with my directions. sounds like you just ran into some bad luck there, my friend. quote 2)this set contains the best lego sound brick ever (it's just begging to be incorporated into my arkham asylum). i agree 100%. and i didn't even see it had a sound brick until i read this last night. usually lego promotes stuff like that pretty loudly on the packaging. not here though.

4 great review, deino! man, that car is just so beautiful, and the helicopter is nice too. unfortunately, this seems pretty pricy, and i hardly think i'll be getting it any time soon, what with my limited budget and all. still, it's great to see how well agents is shaping up.

4 i love it ! fun, playable, cool looking, and killer minifigs! sweet!

4 wow, thanks for the great review deino this set is really a must have for me. the sound brick seems great, the helicopter looks very nice and the car is superb! all of the james bond features are really cool, though i'm very interested in how the ejector seat works (or doesn't work..). the car itself is very sleek and full of beautiful silver, and the inclusion of the new rims and windshield mean that i won't have to buy many speed racer sets. as for the minifigs, they all look great, especially spyclops. though it looks rather easy for him to fall off of his spider legs. can you confirm this? a great review of a great set, thanks deinonychus

4 thanks for the awesome review, deinonychus! this really is a sweet set, a bit expensive a set for me, as i only get the cheaper non-castle sets, which is a shame because i love that head! it would be great for some more cyborg troops. the car is awesome, i didn't expect it to have that many silver parts, that's fantastic! heaps of play features too, that ejector seat mechanism sounds interesting. thanks again for the sweet review! ~peace

4 great review deinonychus i really like it! can someone record the sound os the sound brick(maybe on youtube?) i really want to hear it. this sets are really cool deino can you post a picture of the agent card it comes with?

4 great review and fantastic pics, deinonychus. and a big thank you to whoever pointed out that you could use the sound brick for arkham asylum, my addled brain didn't make the connection. the car is just beautiful, and with a good use for the most expensive part of the gate, this is on my wish list for sure, just have to see how much cash is left over after buying the new death star in a month or two. agents has to be the biggest surprise from lego for ages, without any pics it sounded so-so, but they've done a brilliant job with it, love those metallic coloured pieces!

4 great review thanks for sharing

2 dragonator, on may 25 2008, 08:21 pm, said: thanks for the review whitefang. i love these sets, and i wish they were available in nz. so far, it seems they may never come here... but i can sit and hope. i like the look of them after your make-over, a real skeleton army there! did you say you've bought 12! tht's lots of skelies. are you planning a big moc or something? no problem! i had bought it last month. i thought it was so simple to do a review for this. was looking through the thread, then i realised there is a request for it. it was an unexpected shipment that send to singapore. it came in very limited quantity. most of the battlepacks were snapped within a day or two when it arrived. well, i am thinking of building something big in the future. it's just a plan that i have not decided yet. for me, i always love to see the beauty of a big army with different battalions, forming a kingdom. that's why, i always buy many many sets that have figures that attracts me. and for this battlepack, it served a very good purpose for it!

4 thanks for the review!!! it wasn't "really" a request but more of an imply to do it anyway great review! can't wait til these come to aus. probably when the rest of the castle comes out in september though

4 thanks whitefang! i love this battlepack, but can only really hope to get one. still, great accesories and a spider! that's great! batbrick away!

0 no offence- make this 7.99 can. too expensive to be coming with only a few figures. 20$ earns you the same amount of figs, plus a catapult, barricade, two horses and a jousting divider.

2 sorry to be going a little off topic here but personally i have just bought 40 crowny battle packs for the only reason that i am running out of space to store the left over blocks. about 500 of my crownies came from sets (mentioned above) on sale which would have been cheaper than the battle packs. thanks for the review whitefang but i dont think i will be buy any skeleton battle packs, that army is large enough.

4 great review for a great set! man i loved the adventurers although the new indy sets are good they will never match up to johnny thunder! most of all no stickers great review!

4 thanks for this great review, voltio! i never knew of this set 'till now, and it really looks great! i never paid much attention to those aztec/incan style sets, which i now regret. i love the bright colours used here, and all the great traps, there's so many of them, which is exactly what we can expect from an old incan temple like this one. i'm surprised there's no catapult. anyway, the minifigs included are also great, and am i right in guessing those bricks are printed? that would be fantastic, as they look amazing. that boat hull is new to me too, although i guess the fact that it's mainly in belville sets explains that pretty well. thanks again for the sweet review, do you have any other jungle adventurers sets you plan to review? ~peace

4 i'm gonna start searching ebay!

4 i've always wanted this set, ever since it came out in '99. i have never seen it close up (unless you count driving over it in lego racers 2), so thanks for the pictures and the great review. voltio, on may 26 2008, 04:43 am, said: el conde: "you are too beautiful a woman to be wandering alone in the jungle, miss storm. please, allow me to accompany you." gail storm: "i'm with johnny, and i have a cutlass." el conde: "i'll be on my way." hehe.

4 thanks for reviewing this rare set! since it came out in 1999 i have only seen this set in a toystore one single time, one single copy as well... it was in the summer of 1999 in belgium (arlon) in a store called 'maxi toys' (belgiums tru, i think). they had the three biggest junglesets for sale there: these ancient ruins, the set with the beautiful black boat and the zeppelin. being into adventurers at that time i had never seen the entire jungle theme (not even in a leaflet or catalog) and surprised as i was i bought all three sets. that was one happy dutch boy in belgium! surprisingly the two smallest sets made it in very small quantities to my local stores in holland (except for the pontoon plane and small raft which was my very first shop at home order). the spider's secret i bought off bl, which makes me the proud owner of the entire jungle serie. back to the set: this was the first time in a long history of collecting lego that i had a deformed piece: an 2x8 red plate was twisted, i twisted it back and it still serves it's purpose... i loved the whole steam-idea in this jungle serie: the two boats both (including the one in this set) had nice steamengines and a very cool mechanic (yours has the wrong hat/hair btw) to come along with them. the skeleton falling down on the end of a chain was the most intriguing part of this set for me, it worked really well and when you were done scaring minifigures you could winch it up again ready for the next go. the only thing i did not really like about this set was the difference in wheelsize on the car, front small, back large and the way the palmtree consisted out of just three parts... all in all a great set that is becoming more rare and expensive as we speak/post. get it! edited by simonwillems, 26 may 2008 - 07:59 pm.

4 vhtf= very hard to find. to answer some earlier replies... no, there are no stickers in this set. while some adventurers sets of the era had stickers (the 5956 zeppelin had tons), all of the interesting mesoamerican designs from this set are printed. also, simonwillems was correct; my mechanic is missing his hat, which should be a black kepi. they're extremely expensive on bl, though (proving once again that this set has some awesome parts), so i ordered a replacement from lego. it's in the mail and should come soon.

0 athos, on may 28 2008, 07:47 pm, said: the printed pieces are the real gems of this set. beyond them, there isn't much to this set, though the boat hull is nice. the model itself, isn't all that great. the new akator temple is definately a superior model (at least in piece count), but those printed pieces are hard to resist. steve i have to agree. too few pieces for such a high price- but amazing figs too, and a nice baseplate! despite a 4+ palm tree, you get more palm tree leaves for moc's. plus, i think a monkey? and that sweet achu figure.

4 wow, good review! i used to love this old sets, as i was greatly fascinated by inca and aztec cultures, and the mayans technological marvels astounded me. i was thrilled to death when lego released little aztec figures, so of course i jsut had to buy some your narration with the sig fig was hilarious, and the review was all around wonderful, keep up the good work mate!

4 i got this as a birthday gift when i turned 7 years old or so. i can still remember the big box with the brown bridge in its display! so many hours of fun. one of the most amazing sets i own. a lot of play value. a true classic!

4 thank you very much for the review, cardinal brick! that's indeed a very nice little set! klaus-dieter

4 donneyboy, on nov 27 2008, 08:40 pm, said: i might buy a second one of that set, and build it in the bag. i just wanna prove that it is possible. i bought 4 myself! its like having a little beach fleet!

2 so i just piced up a new digital camera and i thought what better way to try it than doing a review of my newest set. the new 7738 coast guard helicopter! itsmy first review, so go easy on me! lets start off with the small stuff. first the mini figs. you get 4 figs total. two helicopter pilots, a diver and a civilan to rescue. the torso's are nothing new on the pilot and diver. same ones as in the last coast guard line. but i like the colors alot better in this coast guard line than the previous generation. the yellow and blue really work well together and the coloring on the badge looks great! the civilian looks to be just a dock worker with an overall torso and a beenie. the diver has nice vented helmet and a pair of flippers that suits his duty perfect! next we have an absolute work of lego art. the rescue raft! the orange flaps can be moved back for easy entry to the raft, as well as the white "support" beams with the caution tape. i put support in perenthaces cause they really don't support anything. just there to fill in the gaps. at the top of the raft is a red locator beacon, ccommunications antenna, and a cargo loop for lifting the raft. lets move on to the interior of the raft. not much here. but you can see the techinc beam that attaches to the top loop,and to the floor of the raft. so far this has proven to be very sturdy and has supported the full weight of the raft quite well. you can also see the white box that holds the equipment of the raft. here you can see the life saver tube. here's a shot with our dock worker peaking out the side. the raft says max ocupants 4, but with the storage box, that might be a tight fit. now lets move on to the helicopter! in my opinion this is one of the best helicopters tlc has come out with to date. i really felt they captured the look and proportions of a real coast guard helicopter. it uses a lower hull and tail section of the new airliner, and cargo airplane. it really seems to work well with this application. the engines have good detail using new "cheese graders" as vents, as well as the new engine stacks that come in the new speed racer sets. the rotors also appear to be new as well. lets move on to the cockpit. we have two seats for our pilots with a sticker sheet for intruments on a flat 4 wide plate. there's also an antena being used as a flight stick. another shot with our pilots at the helm. now lets moveon to the high lihgt of this heavy lifting machine. the med bay, and lifting winch. http://www.brickshel...icopter_020.jpg here you can see the winch arm at rest, along with the medical strechter. the bad part is that the med. strechter doesn't include the ussually included fold away wheels. here's a shot with the winch arm extened ready for rescue! in the second shot you can see the drum that the wire coils up in. it coils up via a recently new power functions "pull" back motor. to operate, just pull out the winch cable, hook on your load, and presse this orange button on the side... the bad part of the new power functions winch is that although its very smooth in its operation, its not very strong. it will only lift the raft a couple inches before it runs out of torque. it also has a tendency to want to pull the crane arm backin while its lifting. it doesn't matter if its a light load, or heavy load. the bay doors open on both sides for easy postioning of the figures and accses to the strechter. here we have our diver looking over his rescue-e. nice and roomy if you don't mind a crane arm being in your way!! at $39.99 and a peice count of 445, i felt this set was a great good considering what your getting. the raft construction is very creative and is probbly the highlight of the set by itself. the helicopter is probbly one of the best, if not the best helicopter tlc has ever came out with if you can get over its size. in a scale of one to five.... price- peice count- playability- design- overall- .5 i would have given it a full 5 out of five, but since the winch can't pull the raft all the way, it didn't fell it right. even with this minor flaw, i still highly recomend this set!

4 nice review. a must have for my city collection.

4 very nice job on the review 5150!! i definitly like this set much better now that i have seen good pics of it. i am definitly picking this up as soon as i can. again, great review . model on!!

4 great review! i will get this, but i will wait for a sale. edited by ~vbbn~, 28 may 2008 - 10:54 pm.

4 nice review! the helicopter reminds a sikorsky chopper,isn't it?

0 all stickers i'm afraid. though i'mnot a fan of stickers myself. some sets (like ferrari for example) take longer to put on than building the actual set. this one is not as sticker heavy as it seams though, and the ones that areon there really give the set that extra touch. printed would have been preffered of course, but in this case i didn't mind it.

2 that's a very nice set. i'm having my doubts about getting it though still. the overall shape and size of the helicopter remind me of the real-life ch-53 military cargo helicopter. a very nice review. you've got the photography down very well i feel. perhaps a bit of nitpicking but at the end where you assign a rating, if you do a rating with faces (which is fine by me) you may want to seperate the faces by a line. otherwise it may become too crowded to the eye.

4 this is a very good review, thank you! but i have some questions about the grey new parts in the life raft. are they 1x1 like their counterparts with the clips or 1x2? and can they be held by a minifig by the handle? if so, these could be very useful for brick-build weapons & tools! also, i'm looking forward to some orange eta 2 jedi interceptor mocs now! who wants to be the first to make one? btw, which jedi has an orange eta 2?

4 thanks for the nice review, ???theriddler???. a neat and funny ice cream truck and a pretty detailed yet perhaps a little big tumbler. an overall cool set for sure!

2 thanks for the review riddler. your pics are a bit blurry though, if you want them a bit better you should sit your camera on a hard surface so you don't wobble it as much i love the tumbler, though it is quite massive, but either way i'll be glad to get it. the figs in my opinion are really bad, joker should atleast have a different suit. oh well, it's worth it for that awesome van, and instance where the stickers are totally worth it. thanks again! batbrick away!

2 thanks all, but so little replies , but my hq is sent now, i'll hope and think the set wil be arived tomorow! who want's the second riddle?

4 i love batman

2 looks like a nice set, thanks for the review! i can't get over how enormous the tumbler is, they should have made it smaller (the price too )i fthey did that and threw in a dark knight joker and henchman i would totally buy it. enjoy your new set! darthperson

4 thanks for the review, ??theriddler??! i am going to see if this set is at meijer, and i will buy it if it is. and i am reviewing the harley truck right now, and i will post a review later.

4 nice review m8. shame that most of the pictures are blurry but nonetheless. just wanted to say that out of all my lego sets, this one, 7888 is the best. the tumbler is so cool once it is put together! those four huge wheels at the back make it quite unique! if you do not have this set i highly recomend it. edited by 4olic, 30 august 2009 - 02:59 pm.

4 thank you for clearing that up i felt that it was ok to review an old topic, as stated, rather than just go ahead and start a new one. a shame that this set, as all other batman sets, have gone up so highly in value but still all things considering (general after market lego price hikes) it is still a wonderfull set even with its market value today (that is if you can ignore the mrsp).

4 i bought this off ebay, while not having been collecting space as a child, it was mainly wild west and city... i have decided, upon reading kdog's m:tron bar brawl mania strip in his space comic, to buy as many m:tron sets and figures i could find.. except i got distracted and bought some different sets as well... to start off with, here's a picture of the box: here's a general shot showing the entire set: a front view: the buggy: another shot of the buggy without the minifig: the flyer: the flyer without the minifig: m:tron crate with some equipment and hoses, i don't know the use of the hoses though : the cockpit open: the cockpit closed with the crew: the magnetic crane: another shot of the crane: rear view with hatch open: one of the side slots that can carry either the buggy or the flyer: top view of this excellent vehicle: excellent for getting spyrius or blacktron out of your way : final shot: excellent set, one of the biggest space ground vehicles and one of the best sets made by lego. undoubtably better than it's newer counterpart the mt-101 armored drilling unit.... a great addition to any collection and has a lot of cool neat features that make it have a lot of playability. simply excellent! five out of five!

2 great find and thanks for the review. inertia, on may 28 2008, 11:08 pm, said: undoubtably better than it's newer counterpart the mt-101 armored drilling unit.... care to explain why? personally i think that aside from the colour scheme the new one is far better. why? suspension, more enclosed cockpits, bug-like appearence.... i suppose it's a matter of personal opinion though.

4 great review of a great set. i always figured the hoses were welding torches (attached to jetpacks, yeah!) as the whole thing had the vibe of a mobile repair center. much like many of my favorite sets, this one has a base of simple bricks and plates and then from that solid foundation the rest is built out to be decorative or have the action features. this gives sets a very solid feel as demonstrated in this set, the first snowspeeder, and galaxy explorer. the mm armored drilling unit has a more technic base giving it a less solid appearance and though i like the set, that jet that luanches from the back is horrible, partially because of the useless orange containment things. the mega core has a nifty crane instead of a big useless jet. -tohst

4 sinner, on may 28 2008, 02:35 pm, said: care to explain why? the mcm has a pure weight of parts that i find hard to quantify but love... it is just so dense when you build it, full of nice surprises, no technique required, and a wonderful stearing mechanism that i rank as more important than the suspension of the mars version. this thing was meant to crush anyway, who needs suspension? i also like the way you never felt that the m-trons deserved a base after building this, it was that good... the colour scheme was perfect... it's space and i like it... enough said great review btw god bless, nathan naturally you're entitled to your inferior opinion...

2 inertia, on may 29 2008, 06:11 pm, said: it's okay, i have a question kind of not related to the review.. is there still a space review/moc index now that docking bay has closed? no, but we (especially imperialshadows) are working on new indexes. supposedly the space one was my job...

2 sinner, on may 29 2008, 05:20 pm, said: no, but we (especially imperialshadows) are working on new indexes. supposedly the space one was my job... okay, just don't forget this when it goes up, i like self promotion. i have about 10 old space sets coming in from ebay and gonna review them soon as well. so that should be some good additions to the index when it goes up! thanks!

4 i really enjoyed the nostalgia review of the m-tron mega core magnetizer. this was the first wave of space lego i didnt get when i was a kid, though i remember looking at this set in the shops. i stopped with blacktron1 and space police. i look forward to more reviews once your ebay stuff arrives cheers isc

4 asuka, on may 30 2008, 01:17 am, said: thanks for that fine review of a really classic and impressive m:tron set, inertia! i was in debt to the set, it's so good i just had to make a review, it got here, i built it then took pictures maybe i should buy another... sinner, on may 30 2008, 08:38 am, said: i've never heard an official word (...perhaps i should raise a topic...) but i think that they don't show them any more because it became a support nightmare. what do i mean? i bet tlg was tired of letters and calls saying "timmy can't make this model shown on the box. can you send instructions and the extra parts..." i know that for some recent models they were designed but not published. how do i know this? the creator said so! hmm... i think my parents probably contributed to that when i was younger . anyway, now because of the glorius creation of the internet we can share the instructions... or make them. iron moose, on may 30 2008, 10:00 am, said: i've heard that the alien moon stalker was called the thunderfoot launcher somewhere. ah, yes. here. http://news.lugnet.c...n=51449&t=i&v=a ah, that's interesting, i wonder why they do that?

4 this super set contains many of the city sets you can get for your mini city hospital. the smallest set is the 7902 car with a doctor. i thought it looked a bit too slow. here is a car you can build with the same bricks. the instruction manual for the ambulance does contain a picture of an alternate model, but it is actually quite hard to build something significantly different. this sets lacks some snot-bricks, so i had to be a little more creative and came up with this ambulance. it is more a hearse than an ambulance. the helicopter has a lot of slopes, so i built a speed boat for those special emergencies. unlike the first two sets, i used far from all the bricks in this. this set does really have some great parts. the brickshelf gallery with some more pictures. is anyone up to the challenge and build some alternate models of the last set in the super pack - the hospital?

4 a great and very creative work, i especially like the speed boat and the smaller car, just splendid!

4 these are great! i especially love the speed boat and your ambulance reminds me of ecto -1! (i would take you up on your challenge but i don't own the hospital. it seemed overpriced to me...)

4 brilliant, a huge amount of creativity there. to do what you did with such limited piece counts is exceptional. they're at least as good as most of the alternate models lego show on sets.

2 i look forward to seeing the review. novelty sized hammer on!

2 monday my review, i hope you like that one also! but i can't wait for your review. who want's the second riddle?

4 i bought this set too, didn't get a chance to put it together yet. but the harley fig is awesome! anyway, looking forward to your review.

0 quote looking forward to the review, this looks to be the best of the new batsets. *gasp* are you kidding me? honestly, i hate this set. the batbike looks far too blocky, and that hammer truck looks super shoddy and thrown together. the only real reason i'd get it at all would be for the harely quinn figure - but i'd probably just get her separately on bricklink. besides, the tumbler and robin's jetski sets look far better to me. they actually seem to have great vehicle designs. no new villian figures, i know, but still some great old ones. er, wait a minute... oh yeah, hope your review gives the real scoop on this kit, deino.

4 a very nice review, thanks deinonychus. that batcycle looks pretty neat.... like a hells bats angels version of that tumbler, a really nifty idea. the truck looks simply sweet, a smooth design and, this time, tlc´s new habit of vehicle oversizing just works very fine. a wonderful and very comical vehicle indeed! and harley.... oh my, this bill i´ll have to pay for myself.... clonecommando007, on may 30 2008, 02:22 pm, said: truck: flick fire missiles!!?!?? lego have you no sanity! sure they're great but you're putting them on every single action set!! yeah.... this starts to become a little annoying. these things simply don´t work in a that much satisfying way.... when i was a child all i needed to play with my mfs were some old fashioned classic space blasters.... zoom zoom, zzzaaap.... honestly, do they really think that this tiny rockets deliver that much fun?? just imagine on!

4 thanks for the review deinonychus! this is an awesome set, it may just be my first batman set

4 hi all, so i was at "the wal-mart" yesterday and had the munchies and was looking for something to eat. somewhere along the line, i stopped caring about food and decided to browse the toy department to see what they had lego-wise. usually, they have jack squat, but on this particular day they had a lot of new sets. i impulsively picked this set up, along with harley quinn's hammer truck and the new little campsite from the indy 4 line. i must say, when i first saw images of this set i wasn't exactly thrilled or anything. i mean, i didn't really see anything particularly special about it, but after purchasing it, i must admit that i would consider it a must buy for any lego fan. but enough babbling about myself. onward with the review (my first of an official set)! in this picture, you can see everything you get with the set. i thought the box-art was pretty nice looking. the manual, on the other hand, took somewhat of a beating within the box, a common problem with most more recent sets. i do have to say that i wish they would at least make some effort in fixing this. they could just make a little thin cardboard "folder" to minimize bending and tears. for batman minifig collector's, the highlight of this set are the robin and penguin figs. previously, you could only get them in the pricey bat-cave set, but this set provides a much cheaper alternative. one thing you will notice, however, is that robin's hairpiece is a new mold, as it is actually a black version of mutt's hair (from the indy 4 line). personally, i think it actually looks better than the hairpiece used on the older version of robin. as the batcave had before it, this set comes with some bricks to make two cute (but deadly) penguins. they help add more charm to an already charming set. when you're finished building, you'll end up with a nice little assortment of extra parts; 1 black "cheese slope," 3 1x1 tile (black, yellow and white), a revolver, a technic pin, and a 1x1 red round plate. here's robin's scuba jet. it's nice and sleek looking. notable parts of interest would probably be the green turbine engines. my only complaint on this one would have to be the use of decals on the 2x2 round yellow tiles. for that type of a part, printing seems as though it would have been the best way to go. now for, in my opinion, the best part of the set...the penguin's sub. this set has more decals than robin's scuba jet, but they seem more necessary in this case. i actually wanted to put the decal's on the sub, as i think the it looks great with them. obviously, it looks like a penguin, but wow, does it ever do it with style! it has a lot of interactive features, the first of which i will mention, being the periscope which raises up and down. and for the collectors of parts in new colors, it has a few parts in medium orange?, such as 2x2 tile. here's a shot of the bottom of the sub. another nifty little feature is how you can lift the top off and fit the penguin inside. and there is enough room inside, so that you can firmly place top on again, and without interference to the movement of the periscope. another little feature is the rear spring-loaded missile. you just tilt the small lever toward the front of the sub, and it fires. and the last small feature are the flick-missiles on each side. overall, this is a great set with a lot to offer for a decent price. a lot of fans might view the only drawback to it as being the use of decals, but if you plan on keeping the kit together they make it look really fantastic. buy it if you can. matt edited by imperialshadows, 01 june 2008 - 11:42 am.

4 awesome! i am totally getting this set. good review!

0 great review! though you really seem to like this set, and it probably is a great one, i'm not a fan of the penguin sub, or at least i'm not from what i see.

4 thanks a lot! ) i've already ordered it but now i'll be waiting for it even more! ) thanks! )

4 yay, another technic shooter!! whew, i need a spare one in case the 14,348 other ones that i have all happen to break. seriously, do lego set designers get some sort of bonus for incorporating catapults, technic shooters, and / or flick-fire missiles??? anyway, thanks for the review. looks like a cute set.

4 thanks for the review! i love this set, i didn't think it was much at first either, but i really love it. another cheaper robin and penguin is great, and those nifty mini penguins are awesome. the spare pieces are even nice! i love robin's little scuba jet, those green engines are very nice and i love it compactness. penguin's sub is even better, at first i was annoyed at getting two subs but now i realise it means i can have a fleet of them i'll be sure to mod over those cannons though, but the details are very slick. thanks again. batbrick away!

4 i was never considering getting this set as i don't really like batman, but if i found this set and had some money with me, i would buy it! ii would use it for indiana jones or something, and the revolevers and top hats! the only problem i see with the box-art is that the penguin is drowning!

2 axle, on may 30 2008, 03:30 pm, said: the only problem i see with the box-art is that the penguin is drowning! is not! he just received underwater breathing super-powers and.... and.... oh, well! ) speaking seriously, great review, btw! ) thanks! ) one question: the teeth are printed on the sticker, aren't they? ) and are not on the box? ) good day, gentlemen! )

4 set: 8635 - agents - mobile command center pieces: 1154 price: $us89.99 those dedicated agents. they've fought chainsaw-armed villains, battled radio-controlled cyborg crocs, chased pallets of badly-stored golden loot and wrestled killer sharks with vicious, toothy grins. finally they've caught the notorious dr inferno and imprisoned him in their cavernous mobile command center. but dr inferno won't go down without a fight! can the agents stop the evil dr 'disco' inferno fleeing? will spy clops laser gun burn through the door in time, or will dr inferno simply use the lovely agent trace's enormous ponytail as an escape ladder to freedom? more importantly, will there be a riot in the streets of lego city as afols go apopletic at the thought of a 12 wide truck roaring through their ordered town layouts? stay tuned! part 1: the box, instructions, parts as the largest of the agents sets (so far), the box is easily the biggest. trainee agents, examine the following three pics and see if you notice anything odd. box front: box back: box middle: spot it? that's right. the printed cardboard which has supposed to be the bottom half of the fold out middle section is on the back, slicing the ultra-large set image which would form the foldout in half . the way the cardboard is printed as one piece before it's folded i think this would be very hard to do 'accidentally' so suspect a major stuff-up somewhere along the production line. i bought this set off bricklink so would be very interested if anyone in the states who has seen these boxes actually on the shelves can tell me if this is common or rare. basically i want to know if i should be annoyed that the bricklink seller didn't list this in the set description, or are they all like this? the instructions come in 4 booklets. the parts list comes in at 5 pages, which is a lot even at half-size pages ! large images of the parts inventory are in this folderwhen moderated for anyone interested. here's also some cute agents-type artwork at the end of one of the books. instructions show piece call-outs and are divided into sections according to numbered bags. as you'd expect for a set with 1100+ parts, this baby comes with a lot of bags. it's a treasure trove of dark blue. as well as the obvious large slopes and wall panels which make up the body and the roof, there is a wealth of smaller navy blue pieces as well - small 1x1 bricks, 2x2 bricks, 1x1 plates, 2x2 tiles, heaps of 2x plates, some slopes, 22x cheese pieces... basically anyone wanting a lot of dark blue should think about this set. the roof panels alone, for example, could provide a dark blue sea for a modernised pirate moc. 2 dsss (dreaded sticker sheets). quelle surprise - stickers! the grey parts of the stickers here are metallic silver ink, which is a nice touch. actually, as sticker sheets go, they're not too bad. fairly subtle for the most part and the navy blue actually matches the bricks themselves. however, after looking at the sticker sheets i thought i was missing something. what about the pieces used for the projection screens showing dr inferno and the sharks - why weren't they on the sticker sheets? there must be another one! frantically i checked and rechecked the box and flipped through all the instruction manuals to find the elusive 3rd sheet. where was it? ten minutes later i noticed something which had honestly never occured to me - there were actual printed pieces in this set! so obvious and yet so unthinkable. it's horrifying how years and years of exoforce and speed racer set releases can mentally condition people's thought processes. tut tut, lego. what have you reduced us to? here they are, folks - actual printed pieces. (yes, i do believe this news deserves the caps.) i also noticed this nifty modification of the usual 2x3 cupboard - you can now fit drawers in it! very clever. this may have been around in belville sets for years for all i know, but it's new to me. the drawers slide in and out very well and the top one sits on slight indentations in the middle of the cupboard. part 2: the figs! our trusty agents - charge, chase, trace and fuse. (high powered agents don't have time for names of more than one syllable - that's why the bad guys always lose ). chase and fuse have the mutt hair in black and dark orange. the lovely agent trace has an exquisite new hairpiece in dark brown, perfect for 'rapunzel' themed mocs. as you can see, her ponytail is loooong. makes it hard to sit down, the poor girl. i feel sorry for all these female figs with such intricate hairstyles that they can never relax in an ordinary lego chair. however, at least she has two breasts unlike the recent harley quinn fig. compensation indeed. seriously though, it's great that there's a separate torso print for the female character and this attention to detail is typical of the set as a whole. three of the agents have reversable heads - nice touch with the headsets and i like the id cards on their pants. obviously the agents security system is based on some kind of crotch measuring device. this would make sense considering the conspicuous bulges in the pants of dr inferno's men (see the other agents set reviews.) the villains - spy clops, dr inferno, gold tooth. dr inferno's hair in all it's glory. this is a great piece, although the orange colouring is a little rough on the front. it's so 3d, it deserves a back and side view (and indeed eb thread) all of its own. as mentioned elsewhere, this is different plastic to the normal minifig hair, but it doesn't quite feel as soft as the exo-force hair. it doesn't fall off as much, anyway. the figs get 10/10 from me. awesome hairpieces in great colours for the agents and a sleek navy blue/ neon green uniform. the villains' faces are great and they are all very distinctive. the attention to detail is outstanding and it's great to see a lego in-house theme with characters as memorable and cool as figs from the licensed themes . part 3: the build the build is divided into three stages - the small vehicles, the front of the truck, and the massive command center section. (a) small vehicles first up, all the small vehicles. we have a small flyer, 2 buggies, jet ski, and a speed boat - all in glorious navy blue with little bits of silver detailing. top view. these vehicles are all simple, small and well-designed. probably the weakest is the flyer, only because the cockpit looks a little large. in fact, the small flyer is probably the weakest element of 8365 overall, which tells you how good the set itself is! in various threads here, this set has been heavily criticised for being way out of proportion. there's a reason for that, as we shall come to. however, the existence of these small sets should appease some people. with the new coast guard sets, for example, all of these save the flyer wouldn't look out of place on a city beach with a little modding. here's an example - agents beach party! (spongebob couldn't help but crash.) the villains only have one small vehicle, but they've been well-served in the smaller sets, and this one is a unique and clever design. i love the triangular shape and the simple but clever technique of making the arch slopes meet up around the propellers. it's sort of insectile in black and orange, and looks very different from the usual assortment of helicopters etc. (b) truck front this thing is a beast! seriously, look at it. it's chunky and mean looking. you don't want to mess with this baby. the build is really nice. like a lot of star wars vehicles, it's all based on technic beams pinned together. unlike a lot of mars mission sets, underneath isn't all technic beams with some plates slapped on like a facade. the majority is a lot of plates and bricks which all fit together solidly. you can see from the detailing of 'cheese grater' slopes and silver pieces on the front how effort has been made to give this vehicle a distinct feel different to other lego sets. sure, the silver slope mirrors might be a bit too much for some, but this baby is all about attitude. you can imagine it roaring down the road en route to dr inferno's diabolical lair! after all, these sets are 'agents' sets - nobody said they were *secret* agents (c ) command center - whole assembly here's a view of the whole thing assembled - inside and cool details to follow at the end. it's kind of hard to show here as it is extreeeeemely long. this is indeed a big set. the build for the trailer part of the command center is fun and very satisfying. yes, there are large pieces but there is also a huge amount of detail. it is also solid as a rock. i remember being annoyed building the big ferrari truck a few years ago - everytime you looked at it, an 8 x 16 plate fell off. the mobile command center is solid - even with the hinged roof and special features, it is not delicate at all. kudos to the designers, again as it is mainly a brick build rather than a technic one. i also like how the command center part connects to the cabin - it's not a special piece at all, just a technic axle going through two circle plates, but it works and it's solid. (please note i've been selective about which stickers i've applied during the build.) top view: the rear: here's an example of why i like the build: (a) the designers have enough sense to put a ladder so a minifig can climb up to the interior when the command center is open (b) notice that although the ladder clips at the top, there is an *extra* clip there in the middle purely to hold it in place so it doesn't flap around and holds firm. i don't know if most designers would even think to put a ladder there let alone go the extra mile and put a mechanism to hold it in place. pure class. oh, and notice the greebly detail stuff to the right there too. the other side. this is probably the other weak part of the build - the bricky gaps at the top where the hinge to open the roof sits. it's a little gappy but the set is so big you don't really notice. (d) and now for the fun stuff - inside and neat details! ok, so we've built the thing. it's big. it's blue. the top of the trailer itself would make a good warehouse moc for a harbour layout. but what about inside? is it any good? what about all those small vehicles from the start of the review? where do they go? well, i'm glad you asked. because the solution is superb. the small flyer folds slightly and slides into place here: lift off the roof and you're away! the large buggy and the speedboat go under here: the jetski slides out of the rear here, attached to its own little platform: and the small buggy goes inside the main cabin. there's even a crane so you can lift it down. so now we know why this set is so large! to fit everything in! it's amazing that this functionality doesn't affect the aesthetics of the set as a whole. but we still haven't finished on the details. the front section has a very easy-to-swing-open roof section and missiles: there's also a command section underneath the bit where the flyer lifts out: and now for the interior. i have to say i really like this space. not only is it packed with great stuff, there's also enough room for minifigs to move around. i hate bases where the figs only have about 2 studs to actually stand and walk. aquabase invasion is a nice set, for example, but the actual functional space inside the base is teensy. claustrophobia! you know within a week they'd be fighting to toss each other out of the airlock. no such problems for these suave agents, who have plenty of legroom *and* the ability to launch missiles from their ceiling. the whole of the interior: zooming in: moving from left to right. first off, the medicine cabinet. looks like someone's been leaving secret mission dossiers lying around. the projector area for mission briefings. dr inferno recently changed his hair colour from purple to orange, it seems. why are all these minifigs so obsessed with their hair? the projector folds down when the trailer is open. push the button and the light glows on. now dr inferno's hair is orange again! this is one of my favourite parts of the set. it works a charm. the batteries for these lightbricks can also be replaced - instructions are in the manual. agent charge considers shark-fin soup for dinner. did i mention these projection panels are printed? the detail is very fine too. the tool section. laptops sit in the middle compartment. you get some flippers, yellow scuba tank and various implements. i'm so impressed that the helmet is pearl silver with a different coloured visor too - there's so much variation in the parts in this set, you don't get the sense the designers are using the same thing over and over to save money. it all feels luxe and top-of-the-line, just like the command center itself. two laptops - yay! the aforementioned rooftop missiles: the dr inferno cage. nasty electric shocks! bzzt! (you can see my reviewing skills are burning out now - sentences.... truncated...) another example of detail - nowhere else in the set is a 1x1 transgreen tile used - they could have used a 1x1 trans green cheese wedge piece as there are others in the set, but they didn't. how does dr i get out? flick that lever on the right hand exterior and the door pops open. spy clops the loyal minion awaits his master on the other side. and there we have it. take a bow, guys! there's a lot of spare parts. a suspicious amount of dark blue small slopes but i checked the instructions and didn't see anything missing. i have to say, i do like the new policy (since speed racer i think) of including these small slopes as extras. part 4: overall rating if you've made it this far, you've got more stamina than dr inferno's army of cyborg animals themselves! as i said earlier, this set has drawn criticism for the size of the truck. however, large vehicles do exist - i grew up in a wheat farming area and as a kid the size of the lorries that thundered past carrying grain was probably intimidating to me as this monstrous espionage machine is to the good citizens of lego city! on top of that, it *does* contain a plethora of 4-wide vehicles inside ! criticism of this set on the basis of size to me also seems misguided as this is basically a playset - and it is a very good one to boot. as you can probably tell, i love it to pieces and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone, whether for parts or for play value. check out the parts list in this folderwhen moderated and you can see just how many excellent pieces it contains. a light-up brick, a flood of navy blue, metallic silver bricks - we're spoiled. 8635 is also an enjoyable build, with fantastic figs and top-of-the-line detailing. in a year when i've found city a bit disappointing after the run of great sets in 2006-2007, the agents line has been one of the surprise hits for me and i can't wait to see what the designers come up with next. edited by svelte_corps, 02 june 2008 - 12:46 am.

4 i see you've also learnt to call dibs. looking forward to seeing your review!! edit: oh, i see! i just arrived early. a truely fantastic review, you make me not want to pass this set up, even though i can't possibly afford it without leaving my beloved castle collecting. it really looks like a fun set, so many neat vehicles, and two laptops, i can't wait to see what other sets we'll see them in. thanks again, great job! ~peace edited by iamded, 31 may 2008 - 09:56 am.

4 yay! i was waiting for this to be reviewed! can't wait to see how it is, i love the look of this set edit: wow! fast going on the review there svelte-corps, i love the look of the instructions. batbrick away! edited by batbrick, 31 may 2008 - 06:10 am.

4 man, tohse mini vehicles and minifigs are sexy as all heck! i love dr.inferno and the female pattern for agent trace (is it just me or she almost "busting out"? ). i love the dr. inferno hair, and the reappearance of spy-clops and gold tooth is simply gold (yes yes, pun intended!) i have to say this is shaping up to be one of my favourite sets, well, ever! batbrick away!

4 svelte_corps, a fanastic review of this biggest agents' set. at first, i was not very keen to have this set. however, after reading your review, you have make me swing up and down. its simply fabulous! thanks for your hard work. i am sure it's not easy to do this review. i love that female mini-fig. she looks awfully sweet especially with her new hair. great job!

4 omg! thank you, thank you, thank you! you made my day! so that means dr. inferno's hair isnt rubber! but one question, is it like that weird funny soft plastic like the ants from indy 4? please answer

4 great review, thanks! that's one hell of a set. i think lego has reached a certain kind of peak with the design, cleverness, and fun of this one. i'm so relieved that agents seems to be shaping up to be even better then i thought it was going to be...and i thought it was going to be cool to begin with. agent "charge"? not only does he look like dash justice, but he has the name of one of dash's alpha team squadmates? i call shenanigans!

4 wow, excellent review, thanks. that set sure looks fantastic. it's incredible how much features they've managed to pack in while keeping it roomy. i'm really impressed by the quality of the design. tlc is sure getting back on track with great design. ow... 2008 is going to be expensive...

4 excellent review by an excellent reviewer on and excellent set. this theme really does seem to be one of tlc's best. edited by plural, 31 may 2008 - 03:24 pm.

4 wow...i can't believe i thought this line was false...oh crap...sweet! i need to get this!

4 you really are an awesome set reviewer, svelte_corps!! thanks very much for this sweet review, so in-depth and detailed, that is one sweet vehicle! it's got three of my favourite things, treads, orange, and big slicey blades! thanks again! ~peace

4 these new sets are just totally off-the-wall radical :d. it's the little details like the scoops on the blades and the alternate alien energy source (lego didn't even have to include those, but they did!) that show lego are really getting back into their groove this year. the ability to add power functions is just so cool as well, i'm going to pick-up the creator monster dino set for the electronics when the sales hit as svelte has suggested. a very entertaining review, just like the agents mobile command center one :d

2 nice review the power functions is a nice idea and i ownder if it will appear in any other new sets? regarless if i get this (i decided to just to get what ever looks good in the shops from now on ) im defianltey picking up some of the white visors off bricklink

4 i was going to buy this set anyway, but now i'm even more excited. :d my favorite part of this set is the bay that holds the little cart vehicles.

2 iron moose, on jun 4 2008, 11:28 am, said: so, is there some way to get all those motor bits at once, or do you have to buy them on their own? i don't think i've ever seen them in a store here... only from s@h so far, or if you buy sets which they come in. all the ones you need (apart from one additional small motor) are available in the 4958 monster dino set (which i got half price). i ordered the extra from s@h at the same time i bought the set - but only because i had already looked at the instructions and knew what i needed. (if people have the ferris wheel set as well i think the small motor comes in that.)

2 this should be reported to the news .

4 really nice review! i love those sweet looking power functions on it, if only the orange bits could be replaced, then you could have a futuristic and motorized jungle cutter anyway, the alien bit was disturbing, but the overly-tall new commanders look very, very cool! all in all, a great set, but i won't be able to buy it, because, in a few days, s@h will become 600$ richer and my wallet will writhe around in pain on the floor.

4 i appreciate your review mr. mandalorian, but why the negativity?. i'd try to find more positives about the set instead of kinda criticizing it after each picture. i personally think it looks freakin' awesome!. the size is very impresive and i nearly fell of my chair when i saw the first pics earlier this year. it's quite unlike anything i've ever seen from lego. edited by radiant7, 04 june 2008 - 08:27 am.

2 thanks for the review. i really like all the mars mission sets this year. the usage of the big wing is a bit annoying, but you can't blame lego for re-using the mold. i've been considering doing the same with mine! mr. mandalorian, on jun 4 2008, 02:19 pm, said: so, that's all folks. shall i include one last "bar" joke? i wouldn't have a bar of it...

4 thanks for the review, mr. mandalorian! this is an, er, interesting set. lots of frontal fire-power. very big too, and i like the idea of those two little craft that attach on the sides. sort of like little escape pod things. anywho, not one of the things on my to buy list, but i do like that radio-active sticker, that could come in use. looking forward to seeing your modifications, too! ~peace

4 thanks for the review mr. mandalorian. the alien craft is a bit small in my opinion could have done with being just a little bit larger. the main craft however despite its few minor flaws looks very good. while space isn’t my normal theme i’m certainly being tempted this year.

2 thanks for the review. i have to concede this does appear to be the weakest set of the summer mm lineup. i've noticed a trend that the larger sets have plenty of parts potential but when assembled the model is not more than the sum of the parts... eagle base certainly didn't seem worth the asking price, at least this is one large model. on a positive note the lame aero tubes, darts and martian carrier pods have disappeared. don't get me wrong, i love mm and most of the lineup is great, this one just seems to fall a little short of the bar.

4 i don't understand why there's so much negativity... this is actually my favorite of the new mm sets. the finished look is very sleek and not very gappy at all. the deployable landing pad is great, and it'll make it easy to put on a shelf without taking too much room. lots of greebles... although i will concede that it's just begging to be modded. still, though, i'm definitely buying this one. :) it has a really great look to it!

2 spacefan, on jun 4 2008, 02:38 pm, said: aside from the factory star justice set (elements of which i loathe do tell. (i'm being curious, not confrontational. )

4 great review, mr. boba fett. i really like this set a lot. some of the features may not be as good as i hoped they would, but overall this looks to be a really nice set. i'm so happy that the giant spacecrafts are finally back. quote i've noticed a trend that the larger sets have plenty of parts potential but when assembled the model is not more than the sum of the parts... eagle base certainly didn't seem worth the asking price, at least this is one large model. on a positive note the lame aero tubes, darts and martian carrier pods have disappeared. hm, actually, i don't see the comparison. eagle base looked terible to me right from the start, so it was no suprise when it ended up being the weakest kit in the first year. this big ship, on the other hand, looked great as soon as i saw it, and still looks good.

2 wow! i'll definately have to check this one out. i always tried making a big mining deployment ship, but it always turned out crappy. edited by maiq the liar, 04 june 2008 - 10:52 pm.

4 nice review. just one little point. since there is no sound transmission through space, but there is an atmosphere on mars through which this this thing supposedly flies, hypersonic airplane makes far more sense than hypersonic spacecraft ;)

0 i didn't see this one coming... probably because that huge white beard got in the way! was this "shadows impersonates aluvar" week or something? ok, this wasn't the worst thing i've ever seen. we can try a real one in the future. the not too near, but maybe not too far future. i guess. where is that a map of, anyway?

2 ah ha ha! a wonderful review, stauder, very funny indeed! the cheese bit made me laugh. stupid aliens. very good once again. i hope to see more reviews in future! quick, go buy the other impulse sets, i could do with another review of them... ~peace

2 hello all eurobricks members, i will be presenting my first review on one of the harry potter's set. firstly, i must emphasize that i am not a very big harry potter fan or owned many harry potter sets. for this review, i will be highlighting what is the beauty of this small little set, and the reasons to own multiple sets of it. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. this set is featured in the harry potter movie, prisoner of azkaban. this set is orignally released in 2004, align with the harry potter's movie. this was actually one of the movie scene where buckbeak the griffin is appeared in the movie. the group of students are supposed to be having up close and personal with him. however, draco decided to disturb our lovely buckbeak. enough of this movie synopsis, i am sure fans of harry potter will know this better. box art featured mini-fig/creature background scene the scene is a simple garden, which had a very good mixture of spare parts for your mocs building. on its own, there is nothing outstanding about this set, except for the griffin. you can buy multiple sets for the griffin alone and for draco mini-fig. well, you don't need lots of draco. but for castle lovers, black cap are exceptionally useful, at least from my view. now, i will point out the following why this sets is so great for other reasons. hidden cover note that, this is the only mechanism which you can find in this set. it looks rather simple but quite useful. there are some little things hide in it too. greens, foilage and brown parts needless to say much, it offer 3 foilage, a green plant, 3 brown slopes, 2 ideal bricks and 1x1 brown brick for building a tree. great for jungle building, forest building and etc. i am sure there are many builders will look out for these. interesting parts it comes with a wizard book, owl, 2 printed tiles with a spider and stone prints on it. the far right, seriously i don't find any good use for it. can any eb members enlighten me on that gray thing on the right? grey parts it comes with a good 10 x 4 green plate. useful for adding as a platform. some more grey slopes for your mocs. there you have it, draco encounter with buckbeak comparing with deep forest ambush as you may remembered recently, there was an impulse set competition. one of my entries, which is under the history theme. the deep forest ambush was firstly inspired by this set, and made an improvement out of it. look at the improved tree compared with the orignal. summary review playability: 4/10 (not much to play with, except swooshing around the griffin) design: 5/10 (too simple and its defintely not related with the movie scene) parts: 10/10 (great for parts, explained by the review. a great deal of green and brown parts) price: 9/10 (an inexpensive set based on the 2004 pricing) overall: 7/10 (a must have for all harry potter fans and collectors whom needs a great use of green and brown parts) hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. more pictures can be found in my brickshelf (when moderated) let the potter magic begans! edited by whitefang, 09 june 2008 - 02:45 pm.

4 i own about 6 copies of this set!

4 thanks for the nice review - it was one of the first ones i got when emerging from my dark ages . i bought two of these, just for buckbeack - i thought he would make a good statue in a persian temple type moc. i also liked the minifig head pumpkin and plant part in bright green - both new pieces to me at the time. all in all, it was a good castle or forest building set with a nice selection of pieces for rocks, grass, plants and trees. the dark bley plume piece also now appears in the 10185 green grocer set as detailing on the roof of the turret.

4 guys, thanks for your kind comments! i am glad that you have enjoyed this review. for this set, i think i bought about 7 to 8 sets, all for the griffins. it's used for my griffin riders in my castle collection. now, the green and brown parts come in very handy for castle mocs too. imperialshadows, on jun 9 2008, 11:13 pm, said: a very nice little review of a pretty nice little set that i wish i'd bought between 1 and 10 of. just for the griffin. oh well. your review has shown me that it's useful for more than just that, so maybe i'll try to pick one up someday. can't have too many black capes, books, or printed things. speaking of which: the gray thing is technically a plume, like any castle plume, except in this case it's a feather (presumably from the griffin), and made from the mold to the old indian feathers in the wild west sets. it's a case of an old part coming back for a slightly new use, in a new colour. beyond that, the "stone print" tile is a bundle or rolled up blanket or package, depending on where it's used. i don't think it's ever meant to be a stone. it was used as a rolled up pack on the back of the star wars speederbikes, for example. nice pics, plenty of useful information. i'd give this review an a+ thanks for doing it! i am very happy that you enjoyed and find my review useful. thanks for enlighten me. now, i know where is the origin of that gray plume. i wonder if i can use it to match with my castle knights as its plume. in addition, i mistook the rolled up pack as the stone print tile. why didn't i think of it? i must have overlook it, and used it as a stone tile instead. nevertheless, i am glad you have give me some good insights on the parts that i am not familar with. svelte_corps, on jun 10 2008, 10:49 am, said: thanks for the nice review - it was one of the first ones i got when emerging from my dark ages . i bought two of these, just for buckbeack - i thought he would make a good statue in a persian temple type moc. i also liked the minifig head pumpkin and plant part in bright green - both new pieces to me at the time. all in all, it was a good castle or forest building set with a nice selection of pieces for rocks, grass, plants and trees. the dark bley plume piece also now appears in the 10185 green grocer set as detailing on the roof of the turret. i never thought of using buckbeak as a statue for worship. i find this concept very interesting. yes, i agreed that this set offers new parts at that time. personally, i pretty like the green plant. good for any kind of terrain settings. i did not realise that the dark bley plume piece appear in the green grocer. thanks for pointing out. edited by whitefang, 10 june 2008 - 03:39 am.

4 guys, thanks for your comments! glad you find this review useful! and be sure to watch out for more old sets reviews. mr spielbrick, on jun 12 2008, 12:28 am, said: this draco is the best tlc has made, if you ask me. the new one (also doubling for belloq and "guards" in the indy line) doesn't look quite as hautain as this one. buckbeak looks cool. looks like his neck/head can be moved, right? rather similar to lego horses. well designed. mr spielbrick, thanks for pointing out some important highlights for the review. i have overlooked it earlier. i strongly agreed with you, that this draco is the best tlc made. i pretty like the face compared to others. furthermore, i used my multiple dracos, for my castle armor guards instead. one could not have too many dracos. buckbeak design is well made. the head can be moved upwards and downwards. the mechanism is similar to the horse design. in addition, buckbeak wings can be removed. similar to the typical green or black dragon wings that we used to see in the past. well, the main reason for me to buy this set was in fact buckbeak. you don't often find a griffin lying around except in harry potter sets. mr spielbrick, on jun 12 2008, 12:28 am, said: the orange brick doesn't have a pumpkin face on it, right? unlike the one from philosopher's stone in the set with the troll. sorry to said, there is no print on that pumpkin face. it's pure orange.

2 nice review. i like the treemaking pieces the most of this not very expensive set. the buckbeak fig is very nice and can bow his head like the horses. i was annoyed to get another draco without some other not made figs (pansy parkinson for example). about the dark bley feathers; in the second version of hogwarts there were several of these feathers put in little 1x1 cones like it was a feather to write with it. i bought 2 sets of these and when they were for sale i just bought +/- 6 more of it. only annoying that i had then even a bigger army of draco's.

4 yay! the monster book of monsters! now i want this! i also love the buckbeak figure! it looks very realistic for a lego version of something, usually they are much worse (look at the goblins, for example)

4 hello eb! yes, i'm cranking out the reviews! the other day i picked up this gem for an okay sales price at devonport, tas, while searching for the new batsets. i informed iamded of this as he is a spidey-suckup ( ) and he informed me this was the only set he didn't have of the wave 2 of this theme. so i ask you great eb members to please remind him of this when commenting! here we go with the review of doctopus' lair: anyway, unlike other reviews, this stars more people, the batbrick-iamded-dragonator-daisy review! (daisy is the mouse that came in the set) first up re the figs, and i must say they are great. i love fleshies and these are excellent to expand my batman world, plus having a spiderman to beat up is good too doctopus is great, though his tentacles are annoying to keep in order. peter parker is a nice addition, i love that torso. eve though harry osborn was totally absent from this scene, i welcome him as he is a good fig also. best of all is mary jane, fleshie females are hard to come by and i love that hair, my very first one! oh, and even better is bley daisy on the far right: another fantastic thing is that by mixing mj with doctopus you get a far more deadly and real villain than anyone could've forseen - the hippy! oh c'mon, tell me that ain't cool? anyhoo, here is a pic of doctopus showing his might: random fact: did you know i influence both dragonator and iamded in their sigfigs? dragonator adapts his from my ia series while iamded added mutt hair when i had him like that in a pic i posted. now onto the box, sorry about the lighting. the art is good and the cartoon spidey in the corner may have beenthe inspiration for a similar style in the new batsets: back of the box. again, sorry about the lighting and blur, it was gtting late and these were the last pics: finally we get to the first part of the set: the catapult. is that movie accurate or what? i love the part in sm2 when he uses his homemade genetic spider powered catapult to launch himself to the scene! oh well, it does comes with a cool spider web an trans blue spider, so it gets some points: and it is really fun! i launched spidey several metres once, i don't think he ever recovered. infact, he almost certainly webbed himself slightly cooler extras are these two. this awesome little boat is great for city, as is the simple but nice bouy, daisy approves: naturally dragonator ruins everything when he found out the "dragon" that would be riding with him was our nickname for daisy now finally, the main attraction - coctopus' dock. iamded and i threw dragonator in the water to see if he could swim. he er, couldn't one sweeney todd later, we continue! the overall construction of the building is very good. i know a lot of people hated stickers and i hated applying these, but they do look spectacular and perfect for any city setting, like a bank, a gotham bank as iamded has already noted below me the black lifesavers a very cool as are the web piece and log pieces: the inside contains the neutron copperplate triple bypass humdrum holy hum 5000, which does does, see movie. anyhoo, it is very cool, and includes a little control thingy on the yellow brick next to it. unfortunately, the inside is plain but for that: the other side has no wall too which is a bit of a letdown really, but atleast it allows daisy easy access. one gripe is those yellow 1x1 bricks, they serve no purpose and break up the colour scheme: better shot of the thingy thing. i quite like it, the use of technic parts actually works, and the whole set is worth it for those purple flames and dishes alone it closes up pretty well too, unable to hit the dish which is a nice feature: me and iamded liked it so much we threw a revived dragonator into it. unfortunately it disagreed with him, but it was fun: another shot of the dock. i like how they have gaps in the jetty, i know the movie version was pretty wack, and although the set isn't very faithful to it (looks more like a seaside library to be frank) it still is very nice. this is my first large blue baseplate too which is wonderful, though funny how the set only uses about half of it: the roof is a well designed and fun feature, it uses some technic connections to render it flexible of any degree, as you can see here by my opening of it: better shot of the roof design, it can lie flat or at any angle. i might use the design myself in the future: as much as i love the building this feature bugs me, for in order for it to work this wall has to stick out, which not only looks ugly but makes you be able to see through the corners. still, easily modded, and log pieces are fantastic for mocing. it also means that there are 7 windows all up for a good, sizeable building: by pulling out the piece in the center the walls both collapss sideways outwards, which is actually pretty fun and works everytime: overall view of the set including characters: now for the story that makes no sense....at all: spiderman is dead after falling down the wall mechanism (see above): only daisy can save the day! for dragonator is being held by the evil doctopus! and iamded and dragonator are too busy not caring! and brainbox is too busy complaining that this goes against all marvel continuity! unfortunately daisy is on a lunchbreak so tough luck dragonator: and daisy goes on a search for fortune and glory: okay, this is what i think of the set: build: 3/5 - fun, but those stickers ruin the experience somewhat, and if you don't apply them the instructions are a bit hard to follow. playability: 4/5 - great little gizmos and bits, not the kind that keep you going like with the 2007 aquabase, but good fun still. design: 4/5 - not very movie faithful no, but still a great little building and a smart design for certain aspects. minifigs: 5/5 - great figs with all different faces and very useful bits. price: 2/5 far, far overpriced even on sale sadly total: 18/25 - a good set that could've been better with a few minor changes. nothing wrong with it, but it doesn't really cross the line to greatness. that said, it has a lot going for it and definitely worth buying or atleast a look! thanks for reading batbrick away! edited by batbrick, 13 june 2008 - 12:21 pm.

2 batbrick, on jun 13 2008, 09:44 pm, said: for dragonator is being held by the evil doctopus! and iamded and dragonator are too busy not caring! wait... dragonator's not caring that he's being held by doc ock? what are you doing? a very nice finish to the interview, now i really want this set! the story at the end was neat (except for spidey dieing! ) but my favourite part was the exploding dragonator. nothing personal mate, it just looks cool when people are thrown into fusion reactors! ~peace

4 very good review! i always wanted this set, shame i didn't get it.

2 great review! i wish i'd bought this set when it came out. oh well...

4 hi everyone, please note that this review was done back in 2006, so do forgive me if you happened to notice any dated comments. product: 6205 v-wing theme: star wars no of pieces: 118 release date: feburary 2006 rrp: sgd29.90/usd9.90 availability: lego shop@home, target, toys 'r' us (us & europe), bricksworld (sg). lego.com said: rule the spaceways! the sleek v-wing fighter can adapt to any situation! position the wings and flaps in attack mode to protect palpatine's shuttle from enemies. or position the wings in flight mode to survey the area for intruders! either way, the v-wing is ready to strike for the republic. includes clone pilot and r4 droid. position wings in attack or flight mode! sorry to all for the delay, since this was supposed to be done 3 days ago. anyway, to get on with it... quite a minimal amount of baggies for this set, as noticed. and the best thing is... no sticker sheet. yippee!! :bounce: the completed v-wing. though not really a complaint, it would be nice if the entire astromech body was provided instead of only the head dome. :p of course, then it wouldn't be movie-accurate, since the q7 series astro-mech is integrated with the starfighter. :lol: he's definitely well-painted for a simple mini-fig. since even the back is painted too. i have to assumed this is the same mini-fig provided for 7259 arc-170 starfighter too, since i don't have that set. anyway, this mini-fig is much more accurate for this v-wing since his suit is rated against vacuum, while those in the arc-170 aren't . :p one thing that's lacking is the instruments panel in the cockpit... it's totally non-existent here. i wonder what went wrong during the design stage. personally... this is the second most anticipated set for 2006, the first being the tie interceptor, for me. one thing is that there's no known release of the v-wing starfighter by hasbro, nor the other well-known brands. the other thing is that being a star wars vehicle collector, i would really loved to see a replica toy of the v-wing. and the v-wing by the lego group does not disappoint... it's nearly movie-accurate, except for the cockpit transparisteel cover which could used some paint like the x-wing's. also, there's a permanent landing gear that quite neat, since it allows you to land the craft on uniform surfaces. the s-foils on the other hand can be quite a pain to pose into flight position. very difficult for the s-foils to remain symmetrical during play. the "swoosh-able" or play factor of this product is quite good... just check out the pics for yourself... :d *crackle* general skywalker, we have incoming! to conclude, the v-wing starfighter would make a much better companion to the eta-2 actis interceptor (jedi starfighter), than the arc-170. coz the arc-170 seems more like a long-range bomber to me, than a snub-fighter. :p and a final pic to show it at rest... comments (for 2008) just an updated pic to show my latest display on the clone wars hmm... off the record, i do understand that sometimes, reviews by most tend to a certain set of guidelines like naming the set, and showing the boxed, and out of boxed pics, and of course, the grading portion. regarding my review, i prefer not to grade any of the lego sets at all as far as possible, because to each, his/her own. my reasons to put up a review is not to belittle the efforts of tlg in coming out with these products nor to help them market them, but to show my appreciation and enjoyment of these products. i hope noone is offended by this, and would like to apologise for any misunderstanding that this may caused. for those who do not understand the above paragraph, care not for it and play on! like me

2 great review! and what are the stands that you used? they look much better than the white bricks that i use.

4 nice review! thanks valentin and a cool collection of prequel fighter you have there 'want'

2 commanderbly42, on jun 16 2008, 11:11 pm, said: great review! and what are the stands that you used? they look much better than the white bricks that i use. oh, those stands were once cd-r spindles. it's from the container that can hold 100 cd-rs. hi whitefang, can't deny that they were once my fav. hunts for lego, and yes, that price tag is a tad hard to remove. well, while am delighted at the v-wing, i still kinda wish it had come with a printed brick for its instruments panel.

4 thanks for the review; i've always liked that one but haven't had a chance to get it. now i'm sold- or the set will be sold- to me !

2 oops. sorry, valentin!

2 there's something called opening the bag do you do this with everything lego set there's something called opening the bag do you do this with everything lego set

0 seeming as there were no reviews of this set in the index i have uploaded mine from jabbas hutt . here is my review for lego set 10178 motorized walking at-at because i live in the uk i got this set with 6 free duracell batteries which was great! (it's just twice as expensive as the us) heres the basic set that is from the instructions. this is the cockpit but please note after i took this photo i realised it was slightly built wrong. heres one of the feet in proportion to a minifig to give you a general size. this is luke skywalker swinging on a wire trying to destroy the at-at i really wish lego didn't make so many luke's because i want differnt minifigs. it would also be nice for a thermal detonator piece. underneath the at-at you can see the shaft that moves the back legs, the motor and squeezed in on the righ t the massive battery box. a load of cogs that move the legs. these are the included figures snowtrooper, general maximilian veers, at-at driver/pilot or whatever you want to call him and luke all whithout there wepons. please note veers should have a dark stone snowtroooper torso with 4 red and blue badge things not 3. these are the figures with weapons i gave them and the included ones snowtrooper has new style blaster, veers has standard light grey pistol like the ones from the old adventure sets, at-at driver has old style blaster which i call heavy blaster and luke has shiny handle blue light sabre . the shiny blue light sabre was included with the set which is a bonus because i really dont like the grey ones. http://www.brickshel...sc00521.jpg.jpg this is the switch which is attached to the battery box on either side of the at-at underneath the lift up side panels. you push the forward to walk forward and backward to walk backwards simple eh . a front veiw with the the panels open. here are the drivers controls which are simply a cotrol panel and 2 exo-force robot hands which are joystick things seen in the film if you look closley. the almost useless carry handle. this is the weird back piece. looking down the at-at from the back where you can see the the battery box and switch. troops decending from ropes and cables and vader leading the assult for this i hadnt got any more imp's so i used clones pilots. (i now have a whole load more snowtroopers) solo and chewie sabotaging. more troops to squash rebel scum huzahh! a very bad picture of everyone packed up inside. the size incomparison to its predecessor overall i would give this set 9/10 because it should come with more snowtroopers or it could be and endor version with loads of strormies and scout troopers. aswell as this you can really sit any one down because of the battery box but i stilll find space to put all the shown figures on this review in the interior as you can see on the above image the chains and ropes are hanging down a bit. tjis set is now limited to 5 per customer in the uk and now no longer comes with free batteries. the walking on this is a bit wonky and dosen't really walk like they do in the film as it moves two legs at a time. i am currently attaching a motor to the head to make it move independently.

0 nice review, i have the original at-at and i like it a lot. considered buying this one but it being motorized made me not. also, i think a set this size could really come with some more snowies! benny

4 great review indexing it, as i write this. how come you think the ctt is the at-ats predecessor? do you mean the motorized at-at or at-at's in general? i think this is a great set and i am very fond of mine. it's one of the few sw sets of mine that is on "parade" at all times. most are packed away in the attic. kimt [btw it's not alone, the older version of the at-at is keeping it company]

2 i mean by the clone turbo tank turned into the at-at i think in the films. when they changed all there technology and vehicles when they became the empire.

2 smith_boy, on jun 20 2008, 06:01 pm, said: i doubt that. the atat was used in the clone wars. well you never know, maby veers was around then, just because it was used in the clone wars dosent mean that veers didn't design it. to wookiepedia!

0 i never got the set. it looked way to skinny. i came close to buying it for the figs but then decided not to. if you compared this one to the later one there is a big difference. this one just didnt seem proporshined with the legs and its body.

0 hmmm, ive still got this set and i must say, i think you did a good job of reviewing it. but... overall, i hate the set, probably the worst ucs set so far (apart from the naboo fighter but that hardly even counts as ucs) from my experience. unless you really really want it and have nothing better to spent your $$$ on, in that case go for it. but in my case, it was a very repetitive build and final model was quite... well, bland, not must variety to it, if you know what i mean.for the price, i would really reccomend the ucs star destroyer, because thats a much better story..

4 good job kimt, it´s a really nice set. it will be interesting to see the size of ds2 ucs compared with the new death star playset. keep up the great regulator job you are doing. morten

4 morten_sonne, on jun 25 2008, 03:36 am, said: it will be interesting to see the size of ds2 ucs compared with the new death star playset. i was thinking about the same!!! as for the review - thanks!!

0 thanks for the review kimt! honestly, like the others have said, i don't find any appeal in ucs sets, especially this one. it's just a big, incomplete, grey ball.

0 the build was a bit boring and i suppose a big grey ball isn't all that interesting, but since the death star ii in the movie is a big grey ball too, i don't see the problem. i didn't think it was particularly fragile. i don't care about minifigs or playability either. a few plusses: in my opinion it looked pretty damn impressive sitting in my lego room and the construction is really clever. all in all, i actually liked this one, but perhaps i have a different expectation of sets than most of you. sets are mainly parts packs and would you look at the quantity of grey plate in this thing! (it's new grey btw). i paid half price for it at shop@home uk, which is still a _lot_ more than half price from the us, and i didn't regret it for a second. cheers, ralph

2 i'd love to get my hands on one of these, but you'd need about three jobs to justify the prices of this guy on ebay. fantastic review kimt!

4 kimt, on jun 24 2008, 03:22 pm, said: 4: zero swooshability i think its very swooshable, assuming you swoosh it at the same speed it moves in the movie. :d while i would never do something like this, i bet if you packed this sucker with a bunch of m80 firecrackers it would make for a fantastic end to a stop motion movie. with it being as delicate as you say it is i bet you wouldn't destroy any parts. edited by gotoandlego, 03 april 2010 - 02:57 pm.

2 hey, thanks for all the feedback, guys! ill try to do the sith infiltrator this weekend.

4 yeah! general grievous starfighter will land in my house! greate set, i love decals - brown and sandy pattern... ingenious! btw. when you show sith infiltrator review? i wait... :)

2 nice review, i bought a couple of these for parts, the only thing i dont like about the ship itself (not the lego version, it does fine) is why is the grand droid general flying around in in a small fighter like this, i prefer the battlefront interpretation witch uses it as a bomber. anyway, great review! -york

2 thanks again, you guys. dont worry, the sith infiltrator review will be up this week. my computer has viruses, but now i got firefox (complete with spell check!), so i should be able to go on the internet ok from now on.

4 it's all good... but!(i know, you expected a but ) it's a rat.

4 its a good review but you forgot another thing. the troll needs a shiled like they used to in the 2007 castle line the sets always had shields for the minifigs and it could be better if it was 3.00 instead of 3.50 but yes it is a good impulse great army builder.

4 very good, nice to see how its all played out. nice review!

2 whitefang, on jul 3 2008, 04:06 am, said: i thought by calling it as a "mouse", it will be a little much friendly unlike calling it a rat. why is mouse friendlier than rat?

4 this is a nice way of building up orc armies, but i do wish it was designed like the knight impulse set. there you have a minifig, enough weapons and armor for two figs and a weapons rack made out of basic pieces. add a generic fig from your collection and you have two knights and the pieces from the rack can be easily used in mocs. the pieces that make up the siege weapon in the orc impulse are not as easy to use in other creations. i'd rather have seen a "orcish" weapons rack (different from the knights rack, but like it, using basic elements) with a second helmet, another weapon, the orc armor and a shield to put on it. still, although not as good as the knight impulse, it's a nice little set. whitefang, on jul 4 2008, 03:43 am, said: tom and jerry is reflected as a cartoon. children associate jerry as a mouse, since its supposed to be heart-warming and make us laugh. in real life, there are many different pets we raised. one of the possible pets we considered is a mouse. mouse are supposed to be shy and friendly creatures that live in harmony. while rats lived in packs, hunt food in the dark and is widely regarded as a "pest". where i come from people keep both as pets. however, if either are found in the house uninvited, they are considered pests. and if you look at the chinese zodiac, rats are very well thought of and are symbols of prosperity. the brick mouse rat

4 thank you for the review. the set is nice, i didn't need the flickfire missiles and would have rather a orc/trol shield instead, but i think i will pick one up.

4 looking at this is making me want to build one of the favourite sets of my childhood, 6649 street sweeper (might do that today actually). cheap. good pieces (despite the lack of a bin lid... that's just inviting disaster isn't it?), nice fig, and one of those blue brushes, which i've always loved but never managed to use. thanks whitefang.

4 hello all eurobricks members, this will be my last impulse set review for the second wave. hope everyone of you will find my reviews useful and helpful in your purchase. name: crystal hawk theme: lego system / mars mission year: 2008 pieces: 26 minifigs: 1 an image of a 5619, crystal hawk alpha 3 in sector 5, reporting to base alpha 3, crystal hawk, reporting for duty, sir! may i present mars mission, latest scout craft, code named "crystal hawk". this spacecraft looks very sleek and cool with its usual white and orange color combination. i am not a fan of mars mission, but these white mini-figs simply attracted me for it. in fact, i only owned its impulse sets, and none of its main sets. nevertheless, this set has the "swoosh" factor. i was swooshing around in my home last night. well, i am not swooshing it like kimt though. am i seeing double? haha, the answer is "no". it has double sided face. i combined the pictures, to illustrate the two facial expressions. bits and pieces different angles love the way how the wings bend upwards and downwards. the only thing i find it a little bit wierd for spacecraft. normally, i thought joystick is the typical navigation controls for a spacecraft instead of a steering wheel? i am not complaining about a steering wheel in a spacecraft. to me, it's quite an uncommon sight. anyway, the white steering wheel is an useful part for making vehicles mocs. summary review playability: 8/10 (fun to play with when you bend the wings up and down.) design: 8.5/10 (design is simple, but creates a sleek and cool look.) price: 8/10 (an inexpensive set to get more scout craft and mars mission mini-figs) overall: 8.5/10 (a very good set to have for any mars mission fans, and for collectors like me whom can't afford all mars mission sets, this set is a very great alternative.) hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my brickshelf (when moderated)

2 glad you enjoyed viewing the review. xenologer, on jul 3 2008, 01:12 pm, said: the hawk, it seems to me, lacks a cockpit, theres not even a seat to keep the pilot from falling off. perhaps it they'd redesigned it to be a backpack jetpack sort of unit using similar pieces, it'd at least make some sense? these are some of the improvements which we can do it ourselves to mod it better. i think these are great suggestions. otherwise, we can add in a white air tank to be included onto the mini-fig. xenologer, on jul 3 2008, 01:12 pm, said: based on the other mm impluses, can we assume this goes for 3.5$usd? at that price it seems to me, that the astro fighter at 5$usd was already a superior impluse set. guess i'd buy one on clearance, for the minifig. in s@h, crystal hawk is priced at usd $3.50. i bought mine at a much expensive price, when you compared it with usd. i never bought the astro fighter. i am supposed that it comes with a little bit more parts and an additional alien fig with it.

4 nice review good little set probable one of the only impusle sets i will be geting untill/if they make agents theme impulse sets and i like the neat double-sided face edited by darth_legois_619, 03 july 2008 - 10:35 am.

4 thanks for your comments, guys! i really appericate it. brainbox, on jul 3 2008, 06:11 pm, said: this is quite a nice set actually. it evokes some of the design elements of the mx-11, while looking different enough to justify me buying it. the head on the astronaut is one i like, so even better. i hadn't realised it was that one actually. does 26 pieces make it one of the bigger impulses sets? i think i may have to get one, if not two... imo, impulse set total piece count should be 30 or less. it will be ideal and more ways to construct a much better impulse sets such as past impulse sets that we came across. i may be wrong, on the 30 piece count thing. but, this is how i view impulse sets. brainbox, on jul 3 2008, 06:11 pm, said: plus it's called 'crystal hawk'. how can that not be considered cool? do you know i bought this set, mainly because it have such a cool name attached with it. "crystal hawk", i simply fell in love with that name.

4 i like this one aswell, it has a couple of parts i need for an moc train locomotive and i don't have any of those space guys yet. and a double faced guy is always a winner in my book

4 once again, another outstanding review by svelte_corps! i am not a very big fan of agents, but this theme defintely offer plenty of useful parts. this volcano base is simply fanastic for parts usage, especially in doing up landscaping, with mountains, by making use of the brown burps. i must admit that the exterior looks real cool, but the interior looks rather empty. these orange slopes certainly make a great illustration of the larva, which gives the agents a hard time to infiltrate within its compound to save his comrade. i am quite sure, this set will defintely attracts lots of kids to coax their parents to buy it, since the bright colors will defintely caught their attention. with all those hi-tech, sleek weaponary, i am sure this is the next big thing for kids out there. well, i am not sure if this theme works for me as well. but this set defintely works well for landscaping project.

2 silent-sigfig, on jul 8 2008, 01:35 pm, said: anyway, the review was great. can we have a close-up of fire-arm's face? that's the best pic i have at the moment, apologies re blurriness. snake, it is released in oz in sept, this baby came from s@h edited by svelte_corps, 08 july 2008 - 04:03 am.

2 awsome review dude im proably getting this though the main downfall is there is hardly an inside

4 thanks for the step-by-step!! set looks great! mmmmm, clawdette....

2 great review!!! realy thank you svelte_corps! maybey you can put al the agents villains round dr. disco like a sort of dicussionroom or something...just an idea undersigned mowo

2 unfortunately i dont have any other sets yet, i think i got one of the bigger vehicles back in the time, but i don't have any sets from this time anymore. but i certainly plan to get the loader dozer and/or the chrome crusher soon. i found an ebay auction where somebody is selling the sets 4940, 4950 and 4970 new & sealed hopefully i have luck with that. it's only at 4 euros right now, but it's still running 6 days... http://cgi.ebay.de/w...t...a:it&ih=005

2 7663 sith infiltrator year: 2007 number of pieces: 310 number of minifigs: 1 price: 29.99 usd brickset hello everyone, and welcome to my second review on eurobricks, the sith infiltrator! lets start with a pic of the box, shall we? as you can see, its a limited edition set, meaning the fig and set could be worth a lot in the future. this set takes about 20 minuets for the seasoned builder. an overview of the infiltrator (also know as the scimitar): as seen in the picture, this ship is very sleek, with very few studs on top (snot= studs not on top). basically, its the cockpit with two wings (with two "fins" on each wing), attached to the hull. heres a side view of the scimitar: very cool- looking! it lands on two "feet" in the front while the cockpit rests on the ground. rear view: the back. the outer cockpit is beautiful, a printed piece on the back (no dreaded sticker sheet! (dss)) and a large printed disc on top: heres a look at the middle: there is a flick-fire missile (trans-red cone attach to technic pin) on the inner wing, a trans-red lightsaber blade in the back of the hull, and a trans-red lightsaber blade in between the fins on either side. all of those lightsaber blades may come in handy... hey, look: the fins open from the wings!: the fins open due to double hinges on each fin. unfortunately, you have to hold the ship up in order for the bottom fins to open. now, lets have a look inside the cockpit: to open, you lift the back printed part, which is attached to the printed disc on top, which is attached to a hinge. it opens pretty smoothly, but is somewhat loose, so sometimes it closes on its own. also, the disc isnt secured well enough to the door, and often breaks off, even with the smallest movement to it. inside, there is an elevated control panel and two sliding pieces near the floor. this ship also comes with a small speeder bike: its very cleverly built, and is a really neat addition. see that clear disc on the bottom? it fits perfectly into the sliding pieces in the cockpit: hmm... whats this?: a hidden compartment! now this was a very cool idea by tlg, a secret compartment found by taking off the top slope of the hull contains darth maul's weapons and tools which include: a (chrome!) lightsaber hilt, a pair of electrobinouculars, and three probe droids. a closeup of a probe droid: just a plain, black minifig head with a black lever on top. finally, the fig: darth maul in the flesh plastic. a good fig altogether, with a black hood and lightsaber blades taken from the ship. he did come with a crisp, new black cape (packaged in a small, white cardboard box), but i am currently using it for another fig. note that this is a limited edition fig, so stock up. a comparison pic of the two mauls: the 2007 version is on the left, and the 1999 version on the right. note a few key differences between the two: the new one has smaller red tattoos and a smoother torso. also, the new one has bigger eyes and a more cartoony look. maul on the speeder bike: of course, he fits perfectly in the cockpit wile sitting on the bike, and he can reach the controls: well, thats about it, here is the... final verdict: build: 8/10, easy and fun, breaks every once in a while. playability: 7/10, this set has many features, but is very fragile between the cockpit and hull and between the two cockpit pieces. swooshability: 1/10, too fragile to fly around, plus the flick fire missiles fall out. minifigs: 9/10, a great fig with a chrome hilt and a double sided blade. a little cartoony. design: 7/10, very clever techniques, very sleek, but very fragile. price: 8/10, fair enough, could be a few dollars cheaper. overall score: 6.5/10, a very sleek ship with clever building and play techniques, but very, very fragile, and shouldnt be picked up off of the shelf too often. and with that, my review is over, but all of yours are not: comments and thoughts very welcome!! edited by jimbutcher, 15 september 2008 - 02:59 am. indexed

2 this set looks like a dandy. is the darth maul fig any different in respect to the torso or head design to the original?

2 trudop561, on jul 11 2008, 06:30 am, said: i got this set last year. and i think you made a mistake when you have remove a piece to access the probe droids and equipment, you just have to slide the entire main part. and i have a question, is this equipped with the new flick-fire missiles that don't fall off? yes, i realized the first part . as for the flick-fire missiles, the do fall off very easily.

0 a very neatly designed sith infiltrator, though i think it lacks the size of the older version. a fine ship, but not what i would call a sith infiltrator. it should be bigger. thanks for another fine sw review kimt

4 hey all! so i purchased the remaining three agents sets i needed, and saw that there was no review up yet for this set! heres the first batch of parts, and the first instruction bits. the mini figures. the first small vehicles. heres a mistake that i found in the instruction booklet. there is no difference between steps 2 and 3. the team inferno boat. this is a nice chunky boat, that looks fairly heavy duty and evily. its nice to see the smooth disks on the bottom, that lego seemingly havnt done in recent boat/plane sets. and the agents submarine! this is a nice build aswell. nice and long, with a few hidden compartments. one for missiles. a place to put the treasure! some final shots of the completed set! the spare bits! another special mention has to go out to slime face. i think he is my favourite ever lego character. the detail on his unique torso is brilliant! his head is fantastic! and his costume just looks great, with the black and green (plus green is my favourite colour!) check out the back of his torso, with the slime pouring down! deep sea quest was £34.99 price ; 9/10 - this is a pretty reasonable price for a fairly substantial set. parts ; 8/10 - a lot of nice bits, few nice boats bits, and a lot of smooth disk things. minifigures ; 10/10 as i said slime face is my favourite lego character, and the details brilliant! vehicles ; 8/10 both very good, with some interesting features. build ; 8/10 a pretty fun build. overall ; 9/10 its gotta be, if just for slime face alone, but this really is a great set!

4 he does look a bit different though...although it hasnt come out well on the photos, there is some green printed slimey bits on his head aswell. he honestly is amazing.

2 nice review rezourceman, i wanted to see one of this set. it seem's there isn't much to it other than what it looks like in the official pictures, but i may well get it. i like slime face!

2 svelte_corps, on jul 11 2008, 09:14 am, said: i would have liked it if they'd gone all the way and made it some kind of giant robot jellyfish or squid *cough*alphateam*cough* anyway i was about to reply earlier and say : great review svelte then i realised it was not you nice reveiw anyway! the only reason i would get this set would be if i got all the other agents sets + all the sw cw sets + all the pieces i need on bl + all the new city ect.. sets....then i would think about geting it

2 i can't see the pics over the glare from my awesomeness!! thanks for the review rez!! i'm jealous you got to snag this right away...

2 it was £34.99 so usd its likely to be $45-$55 i would imagine.

2 great review!! really thanks i slime face, even slimey as my slime sense nice that break jaw is also in it! undersigned mowo

4 i forgot to comment on this review! great job rezourceman, like svelte-corps said your pics really show off the set and what there is to it. i just ordered this and the volcano base off s@h and i can't wait for them to come, so i'll comment on these reviews i forgot about i love the inferno boat, as you say in your review it looks very heavy duty and ready to take on the agents. the sub i quite like from the look of it, though there is the problem of too little space i will try and correct that. the dark blue is especially good. and i love slime face, his torso is very cool. svelte_corps, on jul 11 2008, 09:14 am, said: i can't say this is my favourite agents set; the boat is a little oddly proportioned and the sub, although retro looking, has practically no interior and would be difficult to customise to put more in (unlike, say, the clever job batbrick did with the penguin sub in his review). wow, thanks for that little mention is it impossible or just very hard to mod? svelte_corps, on jul 11 2008, 09:14 am, said: i do agree with you about slime face - he has a fantastic torso with all the slime dripping down which is a bit obscured by the air tank. it's really encouraging that in the last 2 missions we've had great extra villains added in. the only thing i would add about the octopus is that the glow in the dark plastic is mixed in unevenly with the aqua blue, so it doesn't glow in the dark evenly - it's kind of like the mars mission jellies in that respect though much cooler! the octopus sounds great, thanks for that, is he meant to be on any side? i'm guessing he's a mutant inferno creature. about slime face, is his head much different to the joker bombs? i know he has slime marks on his head, are they very apparent? thanks again for the review! batbrick away!

4 great looking set. and that glowy blue octopus is really cute, i might just get it for that. be great in a space moc.. wondering, from the pdf instructions i saw, it wasnt clear what the agent in the sub is sitting on, hows his seat work? and it looks like theres a compartment below him...

4 thanks for the review. this is one of my favorite space sets of all time. i even had 2 of them back in the days. my only complain about this set was that i found that the wheels where too small , i had some trouble passing the rover over the little "craters-mountains" of the space plates

4 this is a great little set. i like how it combines two very different color schemes for different parts of the model. i have made some slight modifications to mine, adding a roof on the vehicle and a back wall on the outpost. also, those white 1x1 headlight plates at the front are thinner than the modern kind and seem to be quite weak. i got this set off ebay a while ago and one of them was broken in shipping, even though the set was otherwise in display model condition, and the other one broke off while i was building the set. i replaced them with the newer variety. mutex, on jul 10 2008, 11:37 pm, said: my only complain about this set was that i found that the wheels where too small , i had some trouble passing the rover over the little "craters-mountains" of the space plates the only bad thing about this set is the name. it can't even roll over a single plate's height. not very "all terrain" at all. edited by cp5670, 11 july 2008 - 07:43 am.

4 thanks for another informative review of the best lego theme ever, and not in attempt to hijack your thread but to add to it, here's a pic of my blacktron 1 version of this beautiful set. the 6927 has to rate as one of the best 5 classic space sets ever along with 918, 6970 and 928.

4 dovchenko, on jul 10 2008, 08:24 pm, said: no more of your great reviews? why? a good review right here, got into the thick of the set without becoming boring with an absence of pictures or not having enough text. i've exhausted my collection of classic space sets. i'd love to keep them going, but just one more set. you can check out this index for a complete listing and links to each of the reviews. thanks for the feedbback. mutex, on jul 10 2008, 09:37 pm, said: this is one of my favorite space sets of all time. i even had 2 of them back in the days. my only complain about this set was that i found that the wheels where too small , i had some trouble passing the rover over the little "craters-mountains" of the space plates it is a gem in the classic space collection. the playability is great! i agree with you as i never thought this was much of an all-terrain vehicle with the wheel construction. the bottom of the vehicle would always touch the bottom of non-smooth surfaces. the wheels do need to be bigger (but i still like them). cp5670, on jul 10 2008, 10:43 pm, said: i got this set off ebay a while ago and one of them was broken in shipping, even though the set was otherwise in display model condition, and the other one broke off while i was building the set. i replaced them with the newer variety. great buy on this one. what did it cost you? hewman, on jul 10 2008, 11:11 pm, said: not in attempt to hijack your thread but to add to it, here's a pic of my blacktron 1 version of this beautiful set. that's excellent. i love the alternate color scheme. great job here! whitefang, on jul 11 2008, 12:11 am, said: however, there is one thing i don't understand about this design. why is the driver seat has a wide back with no cover behind? and, the command center has no door at the back? i understand that these space guys are always carrying their helmet around, for oxygen supply. i wonder if there is a better answer to it. yes. the extra space was probably for the oxygen tanks on the figs. it makes taking them off a lot easier. as for the lab/control center, i never had an issue with it being open. i think this was just for playability. one could always "pretend" that some sort of invisible force ray closed the side when activated. great comments! i love hearing what others think of these classics.

2 quote great buy on this one. what did it cost you? it was $30, which was a pretty good price given the condition. it had no box or instructions though. this set is actually fairly common on ebay though, considering how old it is. i see them pretty frequently on there. quote it's a real nice set. however, there is one thing i don't understand about this design. why is the driver seat has a wide back with no cover behind? and, the command center has no door at the back? i understand that these space guys are always carrying their helmet around, for oxygen supply. i wonder if there is a better answer to it. i just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed: edited by cp5670, 11 july 2008 - 06:39 pm.

4 this set never got me as a kid. i suspect it was because of the wheels; i had mostly basic sets so it would have been more of the same. looking at it now i can see i have misjudged it, and i love the lab-lift method. i'm going to have to build this to see it in action! thanks for another great review.

2 great review! all-terrain vehicle was one of my two favorite lego sets ever. i have to include a shot of the back of the box, because i love the ideas lego provided for this set: hewman, on jul 11 2008, 01:11 am, said: very nice blacktron-themed 6927! cp5670, on jul 11 2008, 01:39 pm, said: i just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed: i love your modified 6927 with the enclosed front. 2 weeks ago i modified my all-terrain vehicle as well, in a similar way, but just *slightly* more modified from the original. i call it: 6927-c 'all-terrain vehicle improved class' a few clues for anyone to easily build this themselves: also, a much more extensive modification/moc that i call 6927-w "all-terrain warrior" quote 6927-w 'all-terrain warrior' i wanted to make a combat variant of 6927, so i used the 6927-c improved class as the starting point and went from there. i added a completely new forward-cab, close to the ground, for a ground--observer to monitor the terrain. i added even larger wheels, allowing this variant to truly be "all terrain", ...besides, what good is it having a combat vehicle if it gets stuck in the middle of a firefight? the 6927-w has a five man crew: a driver, a gunner who also serves as overall-commander, a terrain observer in the very front. in the lab are the weapons systems officer and computer/tech specialist. the all-terrain warrior vehicle portion is armed with lasers and blaster cannons, with options for other weapons. there are short-range nuclear rockets on the lab, guided by the rader control. the lab now has blast-proof shutters on the windows protecting the crew from rocket blast. additional protection can be added to the lab, if-need-be, such as more extensive blast-shielding. all-in-all, the all-terrain warrior is a beast of a machine. two 6927s can protect an entire convoy of standard 6927 or 6927-c. these are my very first attempts at modification and doing a moc of classic space lego! edited by parallaxscroll, 29 august 2009 - 03:03 am.

4 i love the sponge bob sets, i have all of them! nice review.

4 thanks for the review! the interior looks nice, better than i expected, lots of great parts but, as you say, so many of them are stickered. after rocket ride, the stickers in the sb sets seem to have gone crazy - the early sets weren't slathered in them. 2 new figs though is most welcome.

2 great review. as much as i hate spongebob lego, i just might get this set. it has a good number of useful parts, like the computer and keyboard, and all of the brown pieces. how much does this set cost in usd?

4 how much euro did you pay for it? it looks a great set, great interior, nice figures and funny posters. :) it's also nice: the newest spongebob sets are now also available in our stores and they are the coolest (belgium)!

2 cpt. pegleg blockbeard, on jul 12 2008, 04:23 pm, said: is sponge bob sets available in auzzi land? i have not seen them in shops... regards cpt. pb generally not, although as a special sale promotion target has 3830 bikini bottom express and 3831 rocket ride available now (although the sale starts 24 july for 20% off) and k-mart briefly had the krusty krab set last year.

4 nice review, the set looks promising.

2 i never have buy a sponge bob set but this looks so cool so maybe... (just maybe) i will buy it . i am curious of why tlc haven´t done the flying dutchman ship, it was in the first rumor list of sponge bob sets, that surely will be a must .

4 awesome, light blue train doors. yummy! it is quite strange that spongbob has become the best source for train parts: the baby blue doors, the orange round windows ,...

4 the official name for this lego set is "the emergency room". i have all the other spongebob sets, including three krusty krabs, two bikini bottoms, as well as one of everything else , now all i need to do is wait until next month to buy this set if i find it at my local toys "r" us. that spongebob minifig looks cute.

0 i recently bought this set for my daughters birthday. it's the first belville set that i've bought for her so it's a bit of an experiment. the house is 5 rooms and it's made up of mostly large pieces. there still is a decent amount of normal lego in it though. the doorways in the house align when it is opened out. starting with the bathroom, included is a shower, toilet, sink with vanity and a baby potty. the mirror sticker is one of the few that i put on. the open plan lounge/kitchen/dining room is well appointed as well and it has a nice glass table and coffee machine. the kitchen chairs are fabuland parts... and don't work really well. it seems they are having jellyfish for dinner! the clock is the only printed part in the set. upstairs is a baby room and the master bedroom. the radio and the tv (not shown) were stickers to my disappointment. up top is an extra room suitable for reading. (those antenna things were made from spare parts by my daughter. i have no idea what they are supposed to be... ) there are some stickers that go on the back, but i didn't put them on. as it is the set looks ok this way, but since it is a dolls house it doesn't really matter. i do think though that the fireplace should have been given a back. the bbq is made from normal parts and is quite effective. i think it uses the same light brick that's in the 4998 stegosaurus set. my kids were using it as a torch before my grumbling ruined their fun... like all belville sets, the highlight is arguably the accessories. i'll be borrowing a few of these from time to time... here is the controversial baby catapult. as you can see, it works ok, but lego probably should have tried a bit harder. we also bought for her 7583 playful puppy. it also comes with some nice accessories, but not enough to justify buying unless you want the rest of the parts. poor puppy; where does he sleep? here is my daughter assembling it. she made me make the house though as she wanted to play a game we bought her. (note the lego drink bottles! ) i didn't take any photos of the figures as they don't seem to be anything new, but i can if people want me to. at the time i was in bit of a hurry as i took these before bed so i wouldn't be stressed if the kids broke it the next day. overall, these sets seem overpriced to me, and hard to justify unless you actually want a buildable doll's house. (which we did.) it's still too early to tell if my daughter likes it or not... but at this stage it seems she lost interest in a few days. she does tend to go back to toys though. edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 07:03 pm. indexed

2 mommy and daddy are naughty!

2 great review sinner, i haven't seen a bellville set review before! i just realised what you meant by 'fore' in the topic subtitle, too. imperialshadows, on jul 12 2008, 09:31 am, said: obviously, it really is all about the accessories, and it's got 'em, but not enough to make me spend that kind of cash, and i don't even mind having a pile of pink parts around. i agree, a lot of the pieces are good but i don't think i would get it. however, i do think i will get the set with the dogs, so my minifigs can have giant mutant hounds! jimbutcher, on jul 12 2008, 06:45 pm, said: and look what you found... a bucket! a bucket, in disguise as a watering can...

2 hinckley, on jul 13 2008, 01:55 am, said: this reminds me of that popular tv game show in the states: identify the bucket vs. the watering pale. no one's won the million yet... i was on that, came close to winning too, but the one i picked was too well tanned. wah-wah-waaaaaah.

4 sinner!!! you know, i had never seen a belville set in any review with such great pictures before! i just can't take my eyes off, in the master bedroom. the scene is quite, a little hot. enough of me, peeping up there. let's take a look at the interior. i am very surprised by its construction of the house. it's quite big and is nice of you to buy a great sweet gift for your daughter. i am very sure, she will enjoyed playing with it. somehow, it reminded me of barbie doll products. maybe, its too pinkish for me. the accessories is the "plus factor" in any belville sets. it offered quite a handful of great accessories to add into any types of mocs construction to add in the plus factor in it. sinner, you are a very nice dad! i like how parents, buy educational toys for their children to expand their imaginations instead of sitting in a couch playing video games and etc.

2 i'm confused... the finale of big brother australia was last week. so why only now are we seeing pictures of housemates brigette and ben performing a striptease? and where is rory in his signature g-string? very odd.

4 i bought this today, mainly because it was 25% off, but i'd been eyeing it for a long time. the accessories truly are brilliant! there's so much here to be pillaged for other uses, as people have said. i picked up heaps of new parts i've never had, or rare ones in even rarer colours. to be honest, i was surprised and impressed by the range and versatility of the regular bricks as well. when you look at the box art, what jumps out at you are the giant pink walls and curved pieces, but there's a nice amount of white arches and lime green bricks, not to mention all the windows and the trans blue 1x2x5 bricks. and plants! it's a good thing the target audience likes stickers though, there's more here than i've seen on any set except the 7709 sentai fortress! i think they were aiming for one sticker per page of instructions i hope belville returns in 2010 thanks for the review, sieggy! did your daughter ever go back to it?

2 paanjang16, on jun 17 2009, 11:25 pm, said: belville looks horrible to me too barbie-ish and does not look lego at all. i think that is the idea! so that means you wouldn't think much of scala then?

4 nice review! i got over the gun problem with the shockie since the rebel in the y-wing doesn't need one. i wish i could have gotten more of these but i'll know for next time.

4 when i saw this topic i was like : "oh my god this set is out since 2007. this guy is so late!" but i read your review and this idea got out of my mind! thank you jim! i have 2 of these and i even have twice more droids than clones! i should have buy more but it's sold out now

4 nice review jimbutcher , this set is for many reasons awesome but unfortunately i just buy one. now i am planning on buying one more in my wal-mart there are like three in stock but with a high price of $19.99 each so maybe just one and will keep it misb .

2 thanks for the review very much jim! sooner or later i'll have six sets of this.

4 7654: droids battle pack. year: 2007 number of pieces: 102 number of minifigs: 7 price: 9.99 usd brickset hi everybody, and welcome to my fourth review on eurobricks. today, i will review the droid bttle pack set. note: this set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid, but i replaced them (along with the crooked arms) with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms. a picture of the box: as it is on the shelves of major-retail stores. a small box, as expected for inexpensive sets like these. note the "build your army" button on the front: tlg obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples, and with good reason, which will be explained later in this review. an overview of the set's content: you can see a droid carrying vehicle, a stap, and some battle/ super battle droids. a look at the carrier: a light tank. note the guns on the front: the guns and cockpit can turn a little bit left and right from the main body. also, the guns can move up and down, free from the cockpit: and check out the cockpit: two 2x1 center studded plates side by side for the pilot to stand on. now, moving on to the stap: a small, very useful vehicle in the sw universe. these are seen frequently in both the movies and games (as well as other multimedia). the design is very clever, using vertical building and a clear stand. rear view: the guns/ handlebars can go this far back: and finally, the figs: the figs are very good, but very common. we havent seen sbds in a while, and now instead of metallic blue, they are metallic dark grey. the worst part of this set is that the battle droids have the old arms and guns, while the droids in the mtt and clone pack (both of the same year as this) have the new ones. i wonder why tlg decided to do that... again, this set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid, but i replaced them (along with the crooked arms) with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms. so thats about it, heres the... final verdict: build: 8/10, very easy, should take the seasoned builder about 5-10 minutes. playability: 6/10, has a few play feature, but nothing exciting. is good for mocs and army building. swooshability: 8/10, i suppose you could fly around the stap... minifigs: 7/10, the battle droids are good, but very common, and the dont come with new arms or guns. the sbds are very nice, and in a new color. all figs are great for army building. design: 8/10, the stap was clever, but the carrier was a little bulky. price: 10/10, as fair as it gets. overall: 7.5/10, the figs are great to have and make mocs and armies, and the vehicles are pretty cool (the carrier is a little lame). the main problem with this set is that the bds dont get the new guns or arms, so they dont fit in with all the new sets. also, droids arent as cool as clones. but the price is very fair. and now, my review has ended. unfortunately, i believe this will be my last review for a long time for two reasons: one, the remaining sets that arent done (according to kimt's index) i either don't have or are broken or have missing pieces. and two, my budget is low right now, and i wont be able to get the clone wars sets right when they are released, so someone will probably beat me to reviewing them. too bad, because i would love to do an rgs review... well, as always, comments very welcome!

2 thanks for the review... ...unfortunately the droid battle pack is discontinued for the uk s@h ...also the clone battle pack is discontinued for the usa s@h ( for the americans)

2 whitefang, on jul 13 2008, 11:25 am, said: the wheels are pretty different. i don't remember seeing these wheels in many other vehicles, maybe some members can help me on this. first of all, another great review! thanks for doing these! as for the wheels, these were primarily technic wheels but did find their way into some other models. in white, i can only find a handful of minifig sets that they are included with. there's half a dozen space sets but, apart from the 4-wheelin truck, the only other town set appears to be the 6524 blizzard blazer (tractor with snow plough). the wheels were also in a train set called 4549 road & rail hauler where they were the wheels on a big forklift. cheers rog

4 love this set! nice review also.. i had the set in my hands a few times but never bought it, though i drooled at it, i remember. i guess i didn't get pocket money at that time, it was not that common around europe in the 80s i guess. so better to say that no one bought it for me.. a few years later i got the safari truck, which is also really sweet. i like the colors of this model and the detail of it. the minifig is really classic, made only for this set (appears in some later train sets as well) and shows the exact image of the truck on the shirt, including the motor piece. one of the most detailed and loveliest little sets from a sweet era of legoland city! ps voted "o" for outstanding. edited by zzz, 14 july 2008 - 09:50 am.

4 dear afol friends, due to leakage of production plant in our country one member of our lego club had bought a new promo set. until now he placed only photo of the box, later on promissed to make a review. heavenly god, i wanna one at all costs! most were found here... edited by sinner, 17 july 2008 - 12:47 am. put photos in

4 i want it...i want at least five!! where will it be availible?

4 wow, it does look really cool. i love that...oops! it's gone. can't post pics of that yet, sorry. it was requested that we remove those pics. sorry everyone. have a nice day.

4 oh my..that looks a-ma-zing! seems my prayers for more civilian sets have been heard! hopefully we will get more such stuff in the city future1

2 i wish i had seen it.... judging by the reactions it is a pretty good set!

2 awww i wanna see it please? edit: omg its all over the interwebs, if you know where it looks amzaing its a giant windmill with a house at bottom edited by pencoin, 14 july 2008 - 05:24 pm.

4 i had saw the earlier image just now. it looks very nice. just to share some information with you guys. vestas, an global company which is an expert in "wind energy" this is a tie-up with lego. i feel its an illustration on how our world will benefit by applying and believing its technology to make use of re-useable natural resources. hinckley, is it ok for me to share a picture or two on the vestas exhibition that happened few months ago in singapore? don't worry, it's not anything related "directly" to the vestas promo, wind power plant.

4 wow! i searched on brickshelf and saw pictures that is just amazing! i can only imagine the cost though. will it be on s@h? or will it be sold elsewhere? cant wait! -darthperson edit: heh, see those cool little chairs on the patio made of the city mudguards? edited by darthperson, 14 july 2008 - 05:58 pm.

2 that sounds amazing! a wind power plant as a lego set is absolutely awesome and helps the lego city to get environmental energy. regrettably i missed the pics. when browsing through bs i didn't find them, too . can someone please post a link or sent me the link/picture via pm ? thanks. klaus-dieter

2 in the catalog images i thougt that the base was on a 16'16 baseplate... i have some sets of space-port and like them, but i would want real town sets in 1999... edited by lord santos, 15 july 2008 - 10:58 am.

4 the spinning machine is a centerfuge. (not sure of the spelling ) i remember wanting this set because my friend had the larger station with full rocket. seeing this makes me want it again.....

2 i had never seen this set or this theme before. it was released during my dark age, and i had missed it. it's nice to see such sets, surface once again, to educate members like me that there are some good sets we had missed during the dark age. and, i must admit that this is a very good set. it's comes with 3 mini-figs and staudie with it. geez, i never thought he was an astronaunt back then. the testing facility is great, and i love to see it spin, by putting staudie in it for a "test-run". the buggy is cute as well, but somehow, i don't really like the white frame at the back. it looked a little odd to me. the tools, are simply wonderful to have. furthermore, these are grey tools. the last time, we had so many tools are the aeroplane mechanic. the shuttle is nice, but does the shuttle supposed to come with a cover as well? i guess, since this is a simulator, they must have cut down the budget for it. the control room is good, and it will be even better with chairs included. metalandi, thanks for the wonderful review!

2 wow!!!! i'm just surprised...i thought these were all street dated for the 26th of july. at least that's what i read according to lucas information. oh well, gratz on getin one of the new sets. i'm looking forward to seeing the droid gunship and the twilight real, real, real soon!

2 do the manga guards heads fit on a regular minifig torso?

0 well tlc blew this one i was hoping the magna guards would be what they looked like in lsw 1 !!!!! ohwell one more set i dont have to get.

0 update: i will be merging reviews as they go idle, this is now the dino attack review thread "what, jay's not doing viking reviews!?" nope, i think christopher110 took care of those just fine. instead, i have brought you what is most possibly the highest-anticipated set of the year (;) :d) - the t1 typhoon. and i gotta say - dinos apart, it's actually really cool. the dinos let's get the worst over with. yes. those are all the parts in that 'dino'.

4 great review jay !!!!! tks a lot ;) i am not that of the big fan of the copter due to its proportions - but i admit its really asome looking, better as i expected :od the best are those mfs !!!!!! they are truly awsome !!!!!!! i wiil but some of the smaller sets just for the figs hehe (too bad that my favorite - your second best - don't come in the smallers sets :'( ). are you going to review the other sets as well ??? that could be cool !!!!!

4 that looks like a really great set, although i don't think i'd have anywhere to put it. i don't think i'll ever be able to get the set anyway, since it doesn't come out over here.

2 sam89, on jul 25 2005, 01:11 pm, said: that looks like a really great set, although i don't think i'd have anywhere to put it. i don't think i'll ever be able to get the set anyway, since it doesn't come out over here. sam, missing your point. the set _should_ come to europe, as 7298, but without guns (large crate instead).

2 no, there aren't any pictures yet.

4 that's interesting news about the european release. i'd definitely be interested to see how they modify the set - chains, ropes, and crates are definitely useful pieces. can't wait for pictures. to everyone looking for just the figures - don't skip out and get the smaller set and the tank. spend the extra $20 and get the t1. it's well worth it. i might pick up the steel sprinter and the fire hammer myself, still trying to decide. if i do, i'll review them.

2 thanks bloody jay! any chance you could be reviewing the other dino attack sets?

2 mr. lego_bildur, on jul 25 2005, 10:11 pm, said: thanks bloody jay! any chance you could be reviewing the other dino attack sets? possibly the steel sprinter and urban avenger, but i can say with finality that i will not buy the tank until i find it available for $30 or less. on that note, if anybody does find it for $30 or less, shoot me a pm. ;)

2 sorry for the double post, but i just had another question in mind: how long/high/wide is this "badass" copter? (including rotors). i have heard of as long as 25 inches for the length, but is this true or is it just an exaggeration?

4 wow, i think this is the first time i'm the first to have a new set (at least here) and review it. got it 2 days ago, thanks to a fast shipping from s@h this time, and i found time now to review it now. enough of the babbling, let's let the facts and pictures speak, which actually turned out pretty well this time. set nr.: 4210 name: coast guard platform number of minifigs: 4 number of pieces: 469 release year: 2008 a few shots of the box first: 2 books of instructions we got here, first one for the helicopter second one for the rest and the platform itself: a general overview of the platform from above: the 4 minifigs, 3 rescue guys and one oil rig worker (?). the pilot seems not very happy that he has to work in the middle of nowhere at sea right beside the entry of the tower we have the diving equipment holder: next, the guy can jump in this little speedboat... ...and another guy brings it down to water with the crane: if somebody is rescued from the air, he arrives here and is brought to the tower with the little moving platform than runs on "rails": down under we got a buoy and several life belts and extinguishers: with the lift somebody who is rescued by the boat can be brought up. i think it would been better if they would have made a mechanism there to bring it up, but it's okay: a few floors higher the sea is being observated and watched: on the ground level we have the medical station/warm-up room: the helicopter as stand-alone: all in all for me this is besides the police station the city set of this year. it's got great features, and looks fantastic and also has many useful pieces. you can't do anything wrong with buying it, 10/10 for me! that's all for now, hope you liked my review. edit: oh damn, i forgot to write "review" in the topic title, can a mod please add this? thanks!

4 thanks for the awesome review, metalandi! your pics are very clear and you go into detail about all the functions of the set. i agree, this is a great set - one of the best of the cg line for sure, way better than the boat set with the tower on the bionicle baseplate, and cheaper too. i even like the helicopter better than the oversized version. lots of great parts and a really nice build by the looks of it too. i can't wait for this to be released in oz!

4 great set and great parts pack as well! i guess i´m gonna buy this when it´s on sale, just for the orange parts. excellent for exo force

0 the worker looks like he soiled his pants um oh yeah... nice reveiw! very cool set... im not sure about the bottom floor glass being dark grey and the top floor glass being light blue.

4 i think it looks good on the real set. i thought, the darker glass might be good on the ground level so the rescued guy has it nice and dark in there

2 i agree with both of you. first, i have to add, that a few of the stickers were a bit annoying as it comes to put them on espacially the ones on the helicopter, where you have to put them on round parts. but i didn't really see this at a bad point, i really can live with it. second, it was a very hard decision, believe it or not, on which new set to buy, cause i got a huge 2008 set-wantlist. i guess it'll take some time before i can get most of the other sets i want

2 tenorikuma, on jul 19 2008, 07:49 pm, said: do they sell this set in brick-and-mortar stores in australia? i have no idea what a brick & motar store is...

4 that's a great review of a great city set! thank you very much, metalandi! first of all i wanted to buy the 7999 cg petrol boat & tower. but now i surely will buy this amazing platform instead of the 7999 if my local toy seller sells the 4210. reason: 4210 is something very unusual set (i think we won't get a set similar to that in the next 20 years) and because of i don't like the petrol boat inside (no backwalls , nearly no interior ). klaus-dieter

2 thanks! i own this set...! it was a good time as tlg released a lot of little buildings. (just look through the 63xx-setnumbers)

4 paramedic unit, does not seem to suit well for this set's name. it should be named as clinic, outpatient treatment, family doctor and etc. from what i understand, parmedic unit, is a stand-alone unit, that is on standby, 24/7, ready for any emergency rescue in lego town. ambulance, with a group of paramedics will be ideal for this kind of situation. i love female doctors, especially with that lovely hairpiece! the cruiser, is a neat 4-studs wide design. just love these small car designs back then. i wonder what can be used at the back of its boot. the clinic is neat. maybe, we can send holodoc for some medical audit, to make sure that this clinic is up to standard. what surprised me the most, is the neat little eye chart. you don't see such details in any regular lego set. the red and white color combination for the building, works well for me. most of the hospital buildings and vehicles, always revolved in red and white. i gave this a "4" thanks you so much, brickster!

2 thebrickster, on jul 19 2008, 02:30 am, said: i just can't believe someone would rate this set a 1. it appears to be a trend among these classic reviews, never with a comment of why. maybe a tfol... it is our "destiny" to show them that lego existed before 1997 and was -imho- way better than today. we need more classic reviews. i hope i can continue with technic sets.

2 whitefang, on jul 18 2008, 09:11 pm, said: paramedic unit, does not seem to suit well for this set's name. it should be named as clinic, outpatient treatment, family doctor and etc. the definition of a paramedic is "...someone who assists physicians in providing medical care..." i think in more modern times a paramedic is generally thought of as a more qualified and experienced ambulance technician but the dictionary definition would seem to fit with the lego model quite well. cheers rog

2 hello all eurobricks members and town lovers, today, i will be doing up a review on hook & haul wrecker. this name is quite wierd to me. i will prefer to call it the regular tow truck. this is one of the service and repair vehicle that are always ready 24/7 on stand-by for any emergency towing in our towns. name: hook & haul wrecker theme: lego system / town year: 1989 pieces: 44 minifigs: 1 price: usd$6.00 an image of a 6660, hook & haul wrecker let the towing begins hook & haul wrecker is the typical 4-studs wide vehicle that takes care of broken vehicles that is left stranded on the roads. this tow truck is pretty useful. as you can see, current city sets hardly have any tow trucks available to tow new cars design. this tow truck is catered for 4-studs vehicles for classic town. can you imagine yourself this truck towing a speed racer car? i think it looks really out of proportion. in addition, the mini-fig which is included in this set has the regular truck print on its torso. i am very sure they must be a fan club for "trucks". otherwise, they should really need a change of clothes. nevertheless, in my honest opnion. i really love this torso very much. somehow, it makes them look tough even though their face looks very friendly. side view this vehicle has a combination of two primary colors which is white and red. this color combination looks very good. you cannot mistook it for an ambulance since they made use of this two colors too, in most emergency vehicles. this is my guess, i supposed the designer will have tow truck concept as a form of emergency and considered red and white as its combinations. this vehicle set-up has the typical sun-screen on the top of the vehicle frame. however, this baby has more unique features installed in it. these are the source of its brutal strength all-terrain vehicle??? this tow truck equipped with the best wheels. in fact, these wheels offer suspension on the roads. even when its travelling uphill, the truck will move accordingly with its tyres. when you act pressure on the top of the vehicle, it will either be shifted leftwards or rightwards. close-up of these unique tyres take a careful look. these wheels have springs installed in it. that is the magic of these vehicle and is defintely suited to run on any rough roads with least problems. if any eb members know which other vehicles has this unique features, please highlight it to me. because, if i remembered correctly. i only remember seeing this pair of tyres in this great set. he is ready for some serious towing. the driver had finished hook up the pizza van on its back. it's pretty simple. you just have to lift the back of the vehicle and placed it onto the hook. presto, the van is ready to go. this vehicle provides so much fun. you can really tow any 4-studs vehicle in your town. and, here we go! to the service station. poor pizza guy. summary review playability: 10/10 (superb fun. you will love to use this truck and tow any vehicles) design: 9.5/10 (excellent design. especially with the use of the suspension tyres) price: 9/10 (an inexpensive set based on the 1989 pricing. this set is made up of less than 100 pieces) overall: 9.5/10 (every town must need a tow truck. if a vehicle breaks down, whom will be ready to tow?) i gave it a "5" based on my review score card. what about yours? hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my brickshelf(when moderated)

4 4 stars. the suspension wheel holder totally rocks. yeah. though the slope brick 45 2x3 x 1 1/3 double disappoints me a little. btw: the 6350 pizza to go van looks soooo cute! thanks for the review! (and keeeeep them coming...!)

4 another great review, whitefang. this is a wonderful 80's vehicle - and i think it might be one of the first - if not the first - that had the spring suspension system. i know of at least one other set that had that: the biggest extreme team set from 1998 had a vehicle with those pieces. quote this tow truck is pretty useful. as you can see, current city sets hardly have any tow trucks available to tow new cars design. this tow truck is catered for 4-studs vehicles for classic town. can you imagine yourself this truck towing a speed racer car? i think it looks really out of proportion. firstly, speed racer cars are out of scale even with city vehicles. also, i have hope that in the next few years we will get more octan sets to go with the wonderful gas station - and i suspect that a 6-wide tow truck will be at the top of the list. it wouldn't be a hard set to make, and i bet it would sell well. edited by grevious, 19 july 2008 - 05:31 pm.

2 indeed they have; they've appeared in 15 different sets, in total. they also have an identical width with the wide 2x2 wheels holder which is used on cars today. they are still excellent today, since retrofitting these suspension parts onto today's off-roader trucks won't give them weird proportions or any problems, and it looks perfect. plus they are useful if you're lazy and don't feel like constructing the pin-suspension used in the early 90's for truck-trailers, altough stability probably will suffer.

4 4/5. i've had this set since i was young. never understood why a tow truck needed to be an off-roader; maybe it was used to tow the other off-road vehicles. the suspension made the truck too tall to tow some cars, so i often took the hook out and use the truck as just an great off-road truck like 6672 (which also had the suspension wheels). other tow truck sets better filled their roles better, but that doesn't diminish this set at all. whitefang, on jul 18 2008, 09:19 am, said: i think it looks really out of proportion. no, for 25-odd years this vehicle was perfectly proportioned with all others in the town/city line. it's all these new 6 and 8 and 20 wide vehicles that are ignoring convention and making it look out of proportion. granted speed racer sets are more of their own line, but 6660 is smaller than most of the cars produced in the last few years.

2 three cheers to classic town trucks! it felt nostalgic to see this appearing at the surface after seven years. time really flies and may classic town continue to be close in fellow townies' hearts.

4 skipper 24, on jul 19 2008, 07:25 am, said: cool set i really loved the classic town sets. this set has lots of detail, great reveiw. do you know what is exxon? thanks skipper. exxon is a big fuel company here in the us. there's a lot of exxon gas stations throughout the country.

4 excellent review, it's nice to see review of old sets that i don't own i hope to see many more. was this released under the esso name int the uk?

4 thanks for the fantastic review of the esso petrol( ) station! i like this set, a nice contrast to the shell ones, it adds a bit of variety to a lego town. the cowboy hat is a nice addition too.

4 brickster you need your own sticky review section, i love looking at all of these old sets, as i have said before you take me back to a much simpler time. thank you and on to the set. i love this gas station lego really needs to look to it's past on some of these sets for the time the level of detail is great. i wish i still had this one in one piece as well.

4 brickster, once again, this is another excellent gas station, awaiting to be in the limelight! i don't understand why i always loved these classic gas station such as shell, exxon and octan. they just look so lovely. no city or town could ever survive without these important key installations around, to pump gas/petroleum for all vehicles, that depend it for fuel consumption. as always, all gas station will always inculde a road plate, and i am glad i am still seeing roads included in such sets, such as the recent 7993, service station. however, town plan's gas station, did not include a baseplate though. nevertheless, let me continue with this review. 3 lovely mini-figs, included in this set. it's not common to see exxon torsos these days. i just love that lady staff very much, especially with its classic hairdo. 4-studs car just simply rocks, with such fabulous simple design. furthermore, it gave you 2 cars instead of one. what more can you ask? you don't see tlg giving more cars in recent sets these days. what surprise me about this cars, is the ability of opening the front engine column. i remembered vividly that only trucks or massive vehicles, does have this playing feature. nevertheless, it's an excellent addition. for a 1980 gas station set, this is a perfect set, even when it's going to fit into my current town buildings. i am sure, it won't have a hard time to match with the rest of the facade. i can use this gas station and stationed it near the country side. this set is so hard to resist, with such elegant design of its fuel pump. there are a total of 4 pumping stations. the vehicles won't be fighting against each other, for slots then. the reparing area is very nice, it will be even better if it include a shelter on top of it. the office is simple and nice. i had never expect an office to exist in gas station. most of the time, there are groceries stores, for the consumers to get off, buy off some stores and load it in the car. no major complains from me. i am not trying to be selection bias. i had demostrated key points which is good enough to justify my score. and, i gave it a "5". outstanding classic gas station set.

4 skipper 24, on jul 20 2008, 04:21 am, said: i don't know why but i think it looks a bit like the star wars at-te. could it be that it's really big (mini-fig scaled) and walks on 4 legs? anyway, i don't normally like it when people make a topic to say they'll review a set soon, but i'll let you off since this is one of the few mars mission sets i really like, and i'm glad to know somebody has the set and will be reviewing it. ~peace

4 excellent i can’t wait to see the review, this set looks very interesting.

4 is it seriously? this set was a must-buy for me in the first place, but now that i see it in so much detail, it's just perfect... even the alien ship is better than usual. i love the scooter that flies out of the escape pod, the backpacks, bulldog stickers, and water tank. :d i'll be getting this one! space fans unite!

4 ok, minus ten for the placeholder, but plus about ten million for the review. this set is just amazing. it's really earned it's colors, and i'm sure no classic space fan can complain, even snefroe . i didn't know it had the tilting function for the drill- s@h is so pathetic with its pictures, and they really missed this amazing function. the detachable ship is so cute, it's almost classic space in it's design. major thumbs up to tlc. hell, make it a hug, even.

4 today i'm gonna review the bigger of the 2 castles from the fright knigh theme. i got this one last week at a pretty fair prive at ebay, new and still sealed. i love opening boxes that had been lying arounf for years and being the first to build an old set. since i know this castle theme is not liked so much by the general public, i'll try here and change their minds, cause i really think this is a great set. this time i have to say my pictures turned out pretty amazing, even if i am still using just my cellphone cam, but i'm really pleased now with the quality. here we go! set nr.: 6097 name: night lord's castle number of minifigs: 7 number of pieces: 598 release year: 1997 let's start with a few box & instructions pictures: the inside od the box, with a few alternate models: the back, with another possibility how to assemble the 3 main parts: instructions: next, the 6 minifigs, starting with the witch on her black dragon: all 5 figures of the fright section: and the poor royal knight: we go on with the set itself, first a general overview (it's really high!): on the "first floor" there's a trap with which you can drop stones or other things down on unliked guests, the pot comes originally from fabuland i think, i love this thing: in the same floor there is a second trap, if you pull the bar, the door opens: we move on to the tower itself (did i mention it's really high?), on the ground level there's the place for the witch to do her spells: the wall is a secret door, which reveals a skeleton when turned over: on the next level there is this little thingy, first it only seems like a barrel.... ...but when you pull the two 1x4 tiles on the back, a skull is being revealed, scary, huh : i don't really understand what this is for but i assume it's a telescope to watch and observate the dragons, i do find that a bit senseless since there haven't been telescopes in medieval times (or have there been): the back of the tower with the prison and the room for the treasure chest: the prison opened. it's secured with a chain, which i like very much cause you really can lock it with that: treasure chest: from the highest peak we now go down to the very ground level, at the back of the castle there is another secret wall-door, flanked by two shields: at the back half of the inside there is the throne hall for the bat lord, with a nice warm fireplace in the back (this is, where the secret door is placed): the second half is pretty empty, except for these two baskets. i don't know exactly what they are for, but i ike the idea for using them as water places for the horses: one thing that might be a bit stupid is that 2 of the 4 side entrances do not have doors, so they are open and a guard would have to stand there the whole day. you can see it in his face he isn't very happy with that : that was my last review of the sets i got the last weeks, but i'm looking forward to make much more in the future. overall this is a pretty good set, i don't know any other one with so much details and playability. the minus point is, as already said, that it is too open on the sides, but that can be solved easily with a bit of modding. also i must say, this set isn't that much juniorized as many might have thought, though the design is a bit unconventional, but exactly that's what i like most about it. all in all it gets a 9/10 for me hope you enjoyed the reading and the pictures, can't wait to see your response. edit: oops, i forgot to put one figure of the fright knight faction on the photo, but it's the one in the last picture. edited by kimt, 10 august 2008 - 01:28 pm.

4 i thoroughly enjoyed your review metalandi, thank you especially for taking photos of all the contraptions and detailing exactly how they work. as a member of classic-castle, the census always seemed to be that fright knights were a class 4/10 or 6/10 but as sandy stated above, it is one of the closest you can get to an evil faction. by today's standards, the contraptions seen here are much much more sophisticated and well thought out and are definitely missing in 2007's king's castle siege. i enjoy the design of this castle much more even if the towers are taller simply because the design in the king's castle siege left builders with an empty space right in the courtyard without even a base plate! and it's nearly impossible to get your hands in and play in the enclosed space (why would anyone unless you're simply posing figs, and even that was difficult). this castle instead, had a variety of trap doors and surprises, so despite the varied colors used here, it's not that hard to realize that the designers for this castle really took time to think things out and tried to make the castle enjoyable for the children that will play with it whereas our 2007 castle was strictly built to give kids the impression of an enormous magnificant castle with little to nothing inside. it's like comparing beauty (2007) to brains (this castle). edited by legobear, 20 july 2008 - 01:32 am.

2 metalandi, on jul 20 2008, 12:23 pm, said: i actually got one set left i would like to review, but i'm off tomorrow to italy until thursday, so i won't be able to do it until then. you won't be off 'till tomorrow. that's still a day away! there's still time! no, but still, i'll be looking forward to the review when you get back! ~peace

4 very nice of a very nice set. the revolving fireplace - i wonder what movie that could possibly be from?

4 i read this review not long after you posted it, but i'm not sure why i didn't comment... if dragonator is the one to post everytime he sees a dragon related topic, i would be the one to post if i see a fright knights topic. fright knights is one of my favourite lego themes, and this review is really good! i got both of the castles in the theme and loved them, and your review presents basil the batlord's castle well. i too thought it was a bit weird that there is a green base when it could be grey, but i guess it's a useful piece to use in other things. fright knights on!

4 ah this brings back memories, i have this set and i loved the playabilaty factor opposing to older castle sets i have! in medieval times there actually were primitive telescopes, you can read about it here. thanks for this review, great storie, great pics!

4 wow, what a cool castle and set in general! i had no idea that this set existed (long dark ages) thanks to you metalandi for such a great review! the figures look really nice and the set is full of lots of little trinkets , details, traps etc! i have already had a look on ebay for this set. looks like a great set for parts too. i give the review 4.5/5 evil witches. cheers isc

4 my first post in this topic looks foolish now that i bought this set from ebay. i just really wanted the minifigs (although i already had the batlord and the black dragon) and the parts. they will help me greatly in building the impenetrable fortress of the dragonwarriors for my princess quest comic. by the end of this week, this set will be in my clutches!

2 well, that the bricks look new comes from that they are new. i got this set new and unopened

4 good review - the photo from above shows off the scale of the castle much better than the box photo. i was one of those who always thought this set looked lame, ever since first seeing it in the catalogue. a couple of my siblings had smaller bat lord/fright knight sets and enjoyed the accessories and style of the minifigs etc. so last year having not only ended my dark ages, but done so for some of the rest of my family, i got this set off ebay for my sister for christmas. i of course had to build it to make sure all parts were there before leaving ebay feedback and ending the transaction. first impressions were of how much brick there was to the set, as well as really useful large structural elements. and to be honest, while perhaps a bit childish, there's no doubt the style of the minifigs is kinda cute and useful for customs. it was really enjoyable building this set, and the scale is impressive when built, empty spaces notwithstanding (but hey, lego has always had buildings with no back, etc. - just use your imagination and enjoy the access to playspace offered). the traps etc. are neat and more like the kind of "action features" modern sets come with (i for one am in favour of these, for kids they are fun and i think for builders they give ideas cause they are often done with minimal parts or impact on the set design). anyways, needless to say my sister loved the set. indeed she's currently rebuilding it for the second time. if i see it as cheap again, i will pick up one for myself. i got the first one at €30 incl postage i believe.

4 ahh... i remember how badly i wanted that set when it was new... oh well... definitely one of the most original castles, if not the most. i actually liked how the 1st floor was made into a throne room. the tower looks pretty impressive, too. of course, the castle has a flagrant flaw -- the walls on the sides are open. i also think it lacks in the minifig count, though that is understandable for a castle with a dragon. quote the fright knights are probably the closest you can get for an evil human castle faction. totally agreed.

4 great review again it's nice to see old sets reviewed. i love the control stickers there's a great level of detail this is really the second best fire station in my opinion.

4 a 5/5. the set is beautiful, both the remake and the original. a classic and a beautiful thing, like dos. edited by maiq the liar, 20 july 2008 - 09:45 pm.

4 i´m glad you are reviewing 4-digit sets now, brickster! thebrickster, on jul 20 2008, 07:14 pm, said: this set is one of my favorite fire stations that offers a great amount of playability. this pretty sums it up! the firestation was one of the few sets in my childhood i owned and was not classic space! i especially liked the roller doors, this was one of the first sets they came with. in the late 80´s i sold it to my nephew. darn, i really regret it. when i asked him a couple of years ago if he still owned it (and i could buy it back) he also had made cash out of it. i gave it a "4". there is always room for improvement, like the helipad mentioned. so it can´t be a "5" in my opinion. take off you rose coloured glasses.

4 no question. this is a "5" one of the best and most influencial town sets ever, imo

2 i honestly glad i got the latest fire station [cant remember set number] its waayyy better i voted 3 its realy not that great but its ok.....

4 good, but i like the heli of set 6571 better: another "4" from me.

0 a nice little model with some neat features for it's age plus the all-yime classic fireman as a bonus. however, this design of chopper (the police station around the same time was the same design) i think dated very quickly. while is was good to use the hinged car roof - which was relatively new at the time - together with the inverted screen it was superceded very quickly by designs that stood the test of time far better (for example 6657). also, i don't think i could everbuy a lego fire helicopter because it is not something we have in the uk/eire. police, coast guard, ambulance, military, etc, etc but no fire helicopters. not something i would therefore want in my lego town. great review though. many thanks again for doing these. cheers rog

2 well its ok but its not great voted 3 seems the classic town hater has voted a 1 again!!!! will the madness ever stop!?!

4 i vote outstanding because it makes excellent use of the pieces that were available at the time. that cockpit makes excellent use of an inverted windshield.

2 a great review, i like this set it captures the classic town feeling well, and the ladder is cool! i can't help but feel thought that these reviews are being churned out to quickly, you should leave a gap, i am being flooded with all these great reviews!

4 what an awesome little set! i really like this engine but don't remember seeing it during the late 80s. it must have been out during my dark ages. i love the basket/section for the firemen. equally nice is the fire hose which extends a good length. the color combination of red with white and the trans. blue windshield looks goos as well. this is a great engine and one that would look perfect in a classic tabletown - and it's 4-studs wide! very nice review whitefang. i look forward to seeing more of your classic town reviews.

2 nice reveiw it looks like a great set i think i know what i will do tonight- rebuild my lego fire department it has- [fire pickup truck, fire truck [from 2005 sorry cant remember set number] and the most recent fire station if i can find all the pieces......

4 that's a great review/poll, whitefang! i gave this set a 5: it's simply ! the only thing which i miss are the respirators for the firemen since they already own air tanks. but otherwise this set is brilliant! i like it much more than the new one from 2007 since it's not that big and juniorized. klaus-dieter

4 great set. i found only one major fail - this - the hands of robot arms gets easly broken.

4 thanks for the review. this set was outstanding for its time with all the features and detail. the extending basket is just wonderful. however, i honestly wouldn't consider it the best firetruck ever. i actually like the one from 2005 even better - becasue like most of the city vehicles, it adds the needed bulk big engines like fire trucks need. many of the older kits, while awesome, were honestly a little too skinny imo.

4 guys, thanks for all your great comments! nikola bathory, on jul 22 2008, 06:57 pm, said: it offers very good playability and this ladder is so long! you can have so much fun with it. yes, the "extended length" of the ladder provides great playability! klaus-dieter, on jul 25 2008, 03:01 am, said: i like it much more than the new one from 2007 since it's not that big and juniorized. thanks k.d. i owned the 2007 fire engine as well, as this set was not restored back then, and i needed a fire engine very badly. i managed to restored it somehow, and i compared it with the 2007. the older design is still the best. osakana, on jul 25 2008, 04:03 am, said: great set. i found only one major fail - this - the hands of robot arms gets easly broken. yes, this is an interesting finding. i remembered when i was a child. that robot arms always come out of its own, when i fiddle with it. i was so annoyed by it and i just kept it there whenever i deployed it for rescue missions. grevious, on jul 26 2008, 02:00 am, said: however, i honestly wouldn't consider it the best firetruck ever. i actually like the one from 2005 even better - becasue like most of the city vehicles, it adds the needed bulk big engines like fire trucks need. many of the older kits, while awesome, were honestly a little too skinny imo. grevious, i appericate your honest comments, and given me your insight towards this set, and state a comparison as well. i agreed with you, that fire engines need to be big and sturdy. on the other hand, it can be nice to have the fire engine to look slim as well, to cut through the traffic easily. i am not against with the newer sets. it just that, part of the reasons which reflected in the review had fufill the basic key factors of a typical fire engine. in addition, it was my all-time favourite under the "fire-fighting" theme.

2 quote i am not against with the newer sets. it just that, part of the reasons which reflected in the review had fufill the basic key factors of a typical fire engine. in addition, it was my all-time favourite under the "fire-fighting" theme. yes, i agree! this set is wonderful even today, and is one of the best fire kits ever release. and actually, realistic scale is not really a necessity in lego - it's just my personal taste. for example, i've never liked the tiny planes in the old airports that much, but i can see why a lot of people like them better than the new ones. edited by grevious, 28 july 2008 - 03:17 pm.

2 use your birthday money wisely young padawan... i'm going out now to get this!

2 navy trooper fenson, on jul 21 2008, 07:25 pm, said: nice pictures, but three questions: 1. how many pages do the instruction books have? 2. what are the spare parts? or: does this laaty come with two clone-commander-equipment sets and four assaij ventress lightsaberhilts? 3. where did you get it? 4. how much did it cost? i can answer one! he comes from norway

0 i just got this set sunday, and it's so huge that i can't put it anywhere. it is pretty sturdy and heavy, that's where the handle comes in. i'm pissed that you only get 2 clones. rex has to fight on the ground while you need more clones to man the guns/cockpit. the legs were the most annoying and time consuming part of the build. and yea i agree, that if tlg had made numbered bags, it would have taken only 2 hours rather than 4. edited by ih master 13uilder17, 14 october 2008 - 11:38 pm.

4 i bought this a few weeks ago and absolutely loved making it. it's amazing how the paneling comes together to make such a tight fit, but can easily open up. the legs could have been a bit more poseable, and the guns don't launch easily unless you push hard and fast. i'd like the firing mechanism to launch more smoothly. but it looks absolutely amazing. about price, it was ¥13,000 where i am, but i'm used to lego being expensive in japan, so it was good value.

2 kinganon, on nov 5 2008, 04:36 am, said: probably my most wanted set(rgs is too much), but this seems a 'lil overpriced, i mean $90 for a skeleton? ii'll wait fr it to go on sale(which i doubt it will) i think it is currently on sale at $60? check the sales thread.

2 cagri, on mar 10 2009, 06:10 pm, said: sorry for reanimating this topic. there is a technic brick in the mid section of this set. does anyone know the function of that ?? yup. this is the one, right?

2 jimbutcher, on jul 28 2008, 12:20 am, said: hey everyone, i just got the rgs yesterday at tru after i came home from camp. i saw all of the topics that i missed, and noticed a mini-review and a review with one pic, so i thought i'd make a huge, shiny new review that has lots of pictures and all of the requirements of kimt's index. i'm about halfway through building it, so expect the full review tomorrow. hoope you guys will like it! mabye you shouldnt reserve threads and actually wait till your done. the threads wont run off i assure you!

2 i wonder if the only way to have a "functioning" open/close cockpit is with super-glue

4 very good review! i just checked my ep. ii vehicle encyclopedia (yes, i'm a total sw geek) and tlg got it pretty accurately with the rgs.

4 swman, on jul 29 2008, 10:33 pm, said: i really like the new gunship. different enough from the old one to be better, but similar enough that they don't look totally weird together. really like the new minifigs. didn't think i would like the new clone troopers at all. the accessories are fine. i would never use them on the regular clones, but to each their own. everything is perfect except the rear of troop cabin .... seems so flimsy with only 2 2x1 white brick holding everything together ....

2 courleciel, on jul 29 2008, 11:16 pm, said: what's this thing on the clone at right ?? thats the flashlight .... watch the clone wars trailer and ull know .... theres a scene where the clones enter a dark cave with a metal door like jabba's palace in the movies

2 ah yeah, sorry ! of course ! i see. thanks.

4 thanks for the review jimbutcher . i really like this new gunship but i can´t own one until like two or three months and this is with all the clone wars sets .

4 jimbutcher, finally i had seen something that is worth reading and viewing. imho, this is your best star wars review i had ever read. most importantly, it is a complete review which has substance. you have my thanks! keep up the good job back to the rgs, this is the next star wars set i will be getting. i can't wait to lay my hands on this set, and start building. basically, how bad this set can be, it can't be worse. republic gunship is one of the all-time favourites, in star wars prequel and ot. i can't find any faults, except being too expensive due to the licence cost. in addition, the mini-figs are the next big thing. seriously, i am quite impressed with it. on the down side, my rating will go up if there is an additional clone trooper instead of one. nevertheless, this is a "must get" set, no matter what!

2 thanks for the review. i havent seen any other clone flashligh pics, so thanks for that one "starting tonight, people will die... i'm a man of my word." jifel

4 hey everyone, my wife took me to legoland for my birthday just last week. we had a fantastic time and it gave me the chance to pick up some of the new castle sets and battlepacks i was really impressed by the sets i bought and decided to do my first review... let battle commence! set name: tower raid set number: 7037 price gbp: £19.99 pieces: 364 the models here's a shot of the complete set: the set is made up of two models, the crown knight's tower and the orc's siege tower. let's start with the crown knight's tower: a knight readies himself for battle! my favourite model from the set, the wicked orc's siege tower: please note that for the purposes of display i mounted the orc's banner onto a small cone set on the top platform of the siege tower. this doesn't come with the set but saves any orcs having to hold onto it all he time! there are other areas it can be placed without using extra parts. features both models look great and have excellent features. the set as a whole has great playability and seems to have been concieved with a storyline: the crown knight's have a captured orc within the walls of their tower so the orc army has been sent out to recover him... or are they merely after the gold the knights keep horded away?! the orc's siege tower has a powerful ram - spring-loaded by the simple arrangement of an elastic band - so pulling it back sends it flying out the front, knocking down the wall on the side of the knight's tower... ...and releasing the captive orc! the floor panels inside the prison are laid over a lip on the inside of the collapsible wall, so fall in when they're not supported. there's a string at the rear for extending the boarding ramp... ...and letting a fearsome orc warrior charge across! flick-fire action! the battle heats up as the orcs close in! the minifigures the crown knights: i really like the crown knights. they're metallic helmets look great and they come with nice accessories. the archer has a double printed head with a frightened look on the other side too! i'm not surprised, i'd be frightened when staring over the ramparts at these... the orcs: these guys really do look the part, worthy advesaries to the crown knights! the details are superb: the printed elements, weapons and helmets, all set the orcs aside on the battlefield. the set comes with a great new molded armour neckpiece too. the mighty orc leader looks wicked in his full battlegear! overview there's so much to this set it's hard not to be impressed. the orc's siege engine is a thing of beauty (or terror!) and would look great on any battlefield. the crown knight's tower although basic, looks good and has great playability. i'm a big fan of the new castle knights and fantasy minifigures and the inclusion of five of them is just enough for this set and as a booster to any army. at £19.99 in the uk this set is well worth the money for content and quality. i'd highly recommmend this set as a must-have purchase for anyone a final shot of the siege tower with a host of orcs ready for battle: i hope you enjoyed my review, i'll be posting my next one for 7040 dwarves mine defender soon!

4 i got this set in the spring during my "buy every new castle set available"-season. granted, i couldn't afford all of them, but i do have most of them now. anyway, i love the action elements to this set, and the siege tower really does look wicked. i'd like to attach the crownie tower to the king's castle to see how it fits, but i unfortunately don't own that set (yet). i also love the turning head of the soldier, and i've used it in my princess quest-comic as well, along with the turning head of the princess. the troll leader brings good variety to the army of trolls, but they still could use another face type and more torso options. it's a nice review, in any case, although the set pretty much speaks for itself.

4 hey, good review and good photos. i also got this set just recently, and i wasn't very enthusiastic about it at the beginning, but after i built it i could appreciate it. the siege engine is very nice, but my complaint has do with the proportions of the knight's tower in respect to the trolls' machine - it's a bit smaller, and less bulkier. that complaint has to go with some other sets too. for example the troll warship is really humongous - it feels like it can load the evil wizard's tower and sail off. other than that - a good set, i like it, 4/5 from me.

4 excellent review and your pictures are very good, i look forward to seeing more review. i really like this set i got it some time ago and keep meaning to post some pictures of it going up against some of the older castles.

2 great review! this is an awesome set. besides knocking down the wall at the side, can the battering ram do any other damage to the tower (ex, reducing it to rubble bricks)? and why can't the orc just jump out of the hole in the back? do they need to do that much unnecessary damage to the tower?

4 pedro, for your first review, you have amaze me with your photo session and the strucutre of your review. i am very impressed by your high quality pictures. you have done an excellent job! i love the tower raid very much, as it offers high playability. with the wall and flooring, falling down, when the ram hits the wall, it's quite interesting to play with. the mechanism of the ram is very fun to play with as well. i will try and pull back and released it, to knock a row of soldiers. this is one of my favourite sets in castle 2008. well done.

4 th set was fantastic becuase it was cheap and supplied a very good amount of pecies and had rather good minifigures.

4 jimbutcher, on jul 29 2008, 01:02 am, said: nice short review, although a little hard to read. i agree that this set is a really great one. how is it hard to read? but thanks for the review! great little set, but i do agree that it could have used a russian or two. maybe oxley too. darthperson

4 the only indy set i considered worth purchasing so far. great source of various parts - plus you gotta love spalko's hair! edited by dreamweb, 01 august 2008 - 09:55 pm.

4 fleshies sometimes come in handy. great review and good set, but as said by other: another russian soldier (or two) would be fine, tlc is being a bit too much of a cheapskate regarding minifigs lately.

4 good review. this is my second ij kit that i got and i think it is a great deal. only 10$ and get 3 figs and great parts to use. i may pick up 2 more so i have penty of ants and other goodies that this comes with.

2 ha, you posted as i finished the last update! also, can you take the quote of my update out of your post? it's making the topic obscenely long! dsr edited by dark sword ragnarok, 29 july 2008 - 12:27 pm.

0 too many pictures .... we dont need to see every step

2 krabs., on jul 29 2008, 03:20 am, said: too many pictures .... we dont need to see every step but that's the whole point of an in-depth review, to see all the steps of the build! here's an example:click! see what i mean? it's meant to have a lot of pics, its the whole point of an in depth review. it's in depth.

4 jifel, on jul 29 2008, 06:15 pm, said: nice review! i probably wont get it, since i dont like ships much, but maybe ill order a magn guard from somewhere. i don't really like any of the starships either (harder to battle) so the closest i get are the 2 gunships! this review is certainly 'in-depth' but unfortunately £39.99 =

4 the coast guard quad, because i live in the netherlands, and we don't have the 'dino attack theme', we have dino 2010, which have a diffrent quad. so i would like to chose the dino attack one, but as i don't one him, goast guard. though. but i also don't have the coast guard one, but i like him, but i also don't have the coast quard one as well. greets the-force! edited by the-force, 01 august 2008 - 11:18 pm.

4 that was an intresting race and i was split between the two until i saw whitefang`s reply and the fact you can use the sprinter as a militery thing(which you could do for both but sprinter just pulls it off better) and i like the radar on the back of it so i`ll have to go with the street sprinter. thanks for the nice topic brickster

4 i've got to go with the town one, since you have to stand on the dino one. steve

4 i like the dino thingy because of the pieces and the dino is a lot of fun on its own (i know, thats akward)...

4 ooooooh! this is a very hard choice,i like this new coast guard theme but i loved! dino attack.the dino attack set has a weird looking gun,but imo the coast guard set looks.........cleaner if you get what i mean.the little dino/lizard thing is practically worthless (thats why i have a bin full of those little guys).i want to keep liking dino attack i just can't.so i know your like "just get to the point already!" so i guess i have to go with coast guard. thebrickster, on aug 3 2008, 09:41 am, said: i did not know that europe had a different quad (or at least one without the bazooka). interesting that the gun was removed from the european sets, or added to the us sets. i sort of like the chain. i also notice a big difference in the boxart. destroyed city to prehistoric volcano. i wonder if the story was different as well? thanks for sharing a good picture. ----------------------------------------- well, it does look like the dino quad has the upper hand; almost double the votes. wow i would have so much wanted the european one more than the us one, i mean that bazooka or as they called it a "sonic screamer" looks very silly

0 i know it would really go well with the rgs but it is not enough for £50. ill wait for the sales at christmas.

0 nice review , for portugal it costs 60€. i also consider it oversized, it shold be the third of that size... portugal and spain may have good prices but 90€ for the v-19 must be a tippo.

4 thanks for the review! i think this is my favourite clone wars set, behind the republic gunship.

2 you lucky turd. seriously, good job with the review.

4 nice review, thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts. looks like a really nice set and i'll be picking it up eventually when it makes it to the us.

2 do you have any pics of the wheels? i wanna see what those are like.

4 i am 100% going to get this set! it should be about $55 and if it is, i'll get it without a doubt! i just hope that this set is $50-$60. if it isn't, then we have a problem...

4 this and the at-te and the spider tank and maybe the droid gunship are the few clone wars sets i'll buy. i loved playing as this tank in the clone wars video game( even better with cheat codes for extra missile spam ), so this is a must get.

2 this set costs a s$100 in singapore.i went to hng kong too see lego and the shops there are more expensive by a few dollars.however,i went to australia before and everything there is the same price but when there is a sale it becomes very cheap!anyway, thanks for the review!i was wondering about the details of this set.the clone's faces look a lot like anakin's face.why is that so?i thought it is supposed to look like jango's?

4 christian, thanks for this outstanding review! i have been waiting for this moment for someone to do up an excellent review like this. republic fighter tank is my 2nd favourite set, in my clone wars list. the 2 clone troopers could be easily add up to your rgs, since it offer only more trooper. however, i felt that this set is quite overpriced. in fact, all clone war sets are very expensive. the fighter tank, has a very great color combination of red and white to represent the republic. the wheels below is the most impressive feature, which enable the hovering feel. the hatch is a neat feature as well. however, i noticed there is a rubber band within the control panel. may i know what is it for? i really enjoy viewing this review. you had given the insight which will eventually determined whether to get it any sooner or later. pr0visorak, on aug 2 2008, 05:35 pm, said: this set costs a s$100 in singapore.i went to hng kong too see lego and the shops there are more expensive by a few dollars.however,i went to australia before and everything there is the same price but when there is a sale it becomes very cheap! hello pr0visorak. you are from singapore as well. welcome to eurobricks! i hope you will do an introduction to the rest of the members in this forum. in singapore, it cost sgd$100.00 in fact, that was the promotional price. therefore, there is no further discount for it.

4 im definatly gonna get the atte. im thinking about getting the spider droid and fighter tank. i alredy own the older version of the republic gunship (but i still want it) agentrick57, on aug 1 2008, 08:44 pm, said: i loved playing as this tank in the clone wars video game( even better with cheat codes for extra missile spam ) sorry to get off topic... but i own that game! i liked playing as the republic gunship the best!

4 i always thought this looked liek a cool set, with lots of nice (and sadly unique) pieces. unfortunately the only attack of the clones sets i got were the jedi starfighter and yoda vs dooku. amazing sets, but i would love to have owned them all. i'd never really looked into this set very much, so thanks for the review!

4 this is actually one of my favorite star wars sets. awesome rare pieces, and excellent construction. geo figs are a plus too. best of all, it's nice and cheap.

4 good review! i really liked the detailed geonosians, and i hope theyre in a later set so i can get more. knowing lego they'll release a huge arena playset with a few geos and sand red droids so people will buy the set just for them. jifel

0 7263 tie fighter review parts: 159 figs: 2 price £20.00 (not sure) my 2nd review today! this set came out about the same time as the rots sets and included the first minifig to have a lul. 1. box & manual this is the front of the box, it has a try me slot for the lul vader. a close up of the try me slot. luckily i got mine form argos so no little kids have been playing around with it. the manual cover. i'm not quite sure why it has a pic of the figs on the front but it doesn't deface it so i don't mind. random manual shot. rots set preview at the back of the manual. 2. general set and figs the contents of the set. # the minifigs. a normal tie pilot and the first ever lul fig dv. (also my only lul fig) no helmets. tie pilot torso. the lul is made of 3 parts. lighted up. the led for the blade. 3. the tie fighter just a pic of it. cockpit with controls. tie pilot sitting in the cockpit. by the way the hinge brick is the wrong color it is supposed to be grey. the cockpit shut. i wonder why tlc never printed those cockpit glass things correctly. jet out the back. top plate has some nice printing. 5. overall build: 5/10 very repetitive...well the ships symmetrical! minifigs: 4/10 1 tie pilot which is okay but a lul vader he can't even fit in the ship. design: 6/10 strong but the wings are all wobbly if that makes sense. i don't like the blue either. parts: 6/10 lots of blue grills thingy's not much else but it got 6 because of the wings plates. price: 5/10 could have been more expensive. at least it had 2 figs. playability: 1/10 can't do much as a stand alone set. overall: 4/10 there just isn't enough here. it could at least have a better color scheme and instead of dv it could come with a stormie like the old one did.

4 great review! really shows off the main aspects of the set. wish i had picked up a tie when they were around... dsr

4 this set was on my wanted list for a long time and the sales at s@h came just in time i also loved the set, and like you only put the stickers on the toll both (it looks great on a town layout with almost no modifications). the racers are great. the trucks and the limo are the best in my oppinion. the sticker sheet is huge, but i've seen bigger. stickers over multiple pieces are the worst the slammers are ok, but not great. i played with my 4 years old son and we tryed to do what shows in the box (the cars passing the toll, jumping the ramps and crashing the trucks) but it is very difficult to get it right. but the crashes are very fun.

4 thanks for the review. i'll definately get this set sooner or later. imo the tiny turbos are awesome. i actually bought nearly every set so far, built the models, added the stickers and packed them away in zip-lock bags in the attic. sadly i don't have display room for them (yet). a fine set, carwise.. dump the slammers and buildings into the spare bag and keep the cars. kimt tiny turbos on!

4 looks like a pretty good set with a some nice colors. the spider is probably the best model in my opinion, but i mean look at the wasp kinda weak it you ask me. nice review .

4 thanks for the review, kim! kimt, on aug 3 2008, 01:01 pm, said: i crossed the german border and bought me this one mainly for the parts. what parts were you looking for? or just for all of the parts? i like the story with your wife. the spider is really cool. nice photo shots on the grass, kim! too bad the other alternative builds are kinda odd. always creators on!

2 4500 rebel snow speeder review parts: 214 figs: 3 price: £20.00 edit: new box pics added sorry they're a bit blurry because of the light i took them in. this is the original trilogy edition version of this set but there aren't any differences to the normal one. 1. manual & box the front of the ote box the minifgs on the box top. the back of the box with some alternate models and overview of some of the functions. the manual cover. you can see it is the ote version of the set. random shot. 1 of 2 posters in the instructions. the second poster. 2. general set and minifigs the built set contents. the three figs with the included weapons. how i like to customize the pilots helmets. luke from 4500 and luke from 10178 motorized at-at. the three helmets included with the set. 3. turret here's the turret with the rebel gunner standing next to it. the controls for the turret . the turret can rotate and tilt two fire at those pesky at-at walkers. i put a spider web sort of radar dish thing on like on the original 7130 to make it look more like the one from tesb. 4. the speeder a front view of the speeder. the pilot controls with a at-at print. the seats for the pilot and rear gunner. the rear gunner's tow cable. a detailed printed plate next to the engines. printed plates under the air-brake things. more printed parts, there is no dss with this set. got tie up those walkers. we might need some more tow cable . 5. overall build: 7/10 pretty symmetrical build but it's fun. minifigs: 8/10 3 figs in a £20 set is pretty good i think. design: 9/10 very strong and close to minifig scale. the turret could have some work though. parts: 8/10 lot's of variety and includes some interesting ones such as the cockpit and rear air vent. price: 7/10 3 figs and 214 parts not to bad i guess. playability: 6/10 could be better if it came with a snow trooper. overall: 8/10 the set comes with 3 figs that only come with more expensive sets, also it has a variety of different parts as well as the build being enjoyable. edited by skipper 24, 04 august 2008 - 03:10 pm. indexed

4 skipper, thanks for doing up all these sw reviews. it certainly had given me some valuable insights on these sets especially on the snowspeeder. it kind of making me regret to pass off this set. however, i had bought the hoth base instead but had never built it. i am just wondering if the snowspeeder had any difference? keep up the good work and always strive your best to make each upcoming review a better one.

2 there isn't much difference apart form it has stickers on and is grey. also the guns and tow cable gun are different as well as the engines. but if you look at pictures of the hoth base speeder not to much is noticeable.

4 great review! i bought this set when it came out but sold it a couple years later for some extra cash. i have no regrets selling this one, as i was never really impressed with it (different story for the 4483 at-at - oh how i wish i still had that one). the snowspeeder was alright, just didn't have any sort of "wow" factor to it. the best part of the set is probably the rebel trooper. looking at the last photo in your review, looks like you're about to have a major battle in your hallway. apart from the snowspeeder & motorized at-at, i see the arc-170 fighter, grievous's starfighter, and is that a podracer i see -- and what is the set with the treads? it's not star wars, but looks like a pretty cool set (maybe a mission mars vehicle).

2 nope there is a guy sitting there. he's there because on dine 2010 there were no guns like on dino attack, so so i made a big gun like on the dino attack set. i can see where you got the pod racer idea from now.

2 skipper 24, on aug 3 2008, 11:09 pm, said: the minifgs on the box top. they spelt dack's name wrong good set though.

4 i find myself so stupid i didn't bought this set. it was 30 euro and i thought that it would be for sale after a half year. (it was with earlier sw sets also). nice review.

4 you have to love the originals, well i didn't like the very first snowspeeder so this is the original to me. i like it more then the new one that comes with the echo base, beter color scheme and more realistic i think. i got this set in stores and still love it to this day =]

4 this is one of my favorite sw sets. it is a good size to the hoth base and the at_at.

2 7255 general greivous wheel bike chase review parts: 111 figs: 2 price: £10.00 the first set to include gg. 1. general set and minifigs (not manual because i don't have it) the contents of the box after being built. both minifigs. the set includes 5 lightsabers! my own design gg. gg's cape on the outside. gg's cape on the inside. 2. the wheel bike front view standing on legs. side view. gg can't hold the controls because of his arms. roller mode. the legs are a bit to chunky so to roll it has to be tilted forward. 3. boga the lizard. grey tip to the tail. the front back and saddle split in to three sections. 4. overall build: 4/10 there isn't really much to build. minifigs: 9/10 it comes with gg with the special cape and obi-wan in rots gear which is hard to find i think. design: 5/10 not really to scale but otherwise okay apart from boga which just looks like any old dinosaur. also the controls on the wheel bike aren't really right. parts: 6/10 comes with some dark green bricks and lots of rods ( the guns on the wheel bike) the boga feet are also nice. price: 8/10 £10 for 2 figs isn't bad it could have a few more parts though. playability: 10/10 you can easily recreate the movie scenes with this set. overall 7/10 it would be better if the bike and boga were more to scale and more accurate as well as the set having more parts.

2 i had this set (£15 rrp actually ;-)) and agree mostly with your review, although on the wheel bike itself two legs can be placed at the front end and two at the back to enable it to 'roll' properly. boga is very juniorised, and the set itself is very simple and contains many large pieces. the minifigures are good though (i traded my gg however ). just to offer my personal thoughts; build: 5/10 minifigs: 10/10 parts: 3/10 price: 7/10 playability: 10/10 overall 7/10 -- (not an average) tk

4 7153 jango fett's slave 1 review parts: 358 figs: 2 price: £20.00 (i got it on offer i think the rrp was £40) the only set to include jango fett and young boba. also the decals on jango are from fine clonier. (i'm trying to say they don't came with the set) 1. manual worn manual. random page. another random page. looking at this page you can that this set has numbered bags. back cover. look how old yodas computer looks . 2. general set and minifigs the sets contents. jango with his hair on. jango with helmet on with front view of face. twist jango's head to initiate super bounty hunter mode. jango's doubled sided head. boba. nothing to special although i think the torso and head are exclusive to the set. 3. the ship not really scaled up right as you can see. the guns can rotate. the central sections interior. not sure what this is. is it a hyperdrive or a bomb or something? there are these side panels on both sides. behind the panels. a secret compartment. trans orange minifig heads in the compartment. i think they're supposed to be saturnic charges. side storage compartment. the back of the ship. how those trans orange minifig heads fallout. there is a magnet on the inside of the ship. but for what... the secret prison which also has a magnet on the top so it can stay on but easily come out. the doors on it can lift up to put prisoners inside. 1 of 2 identical wing things. they can fold for flight mode. the controls. bottom jet thing. let me out of here! the prison is great for capturing small children. 4. overall build: 7/10 impossible to build without a hard stable surface. minifigs: 10/10 2 exclusive figs. design: 7/10 nowhere near to scale but has some nice features. parts: 8/10 good parts like that big cockpit canopy. price: 9/10 for the price i got it was pretty good especially with the figs it comes with. playability: 7/10 lots of features but it would be better if it came with a jsf. overall: 9/10 lots of features and comes with exclusive minifigs. edited by kimt, 04 august 2008 - 11:44 am. indexed

4 i have all three of the slave i ships, and i agree with kimt...although it is a very small, compact ship, the first slave i (boba fett) is still the sturdiest. the newest slave i (boba fett) is not bad, and is of much better construction than this slave i from jango fett. even though i like the size and scale of the jango slave i and the newest boba fett slave i...when you pick that very first one up, it had the feeling of....."you can throw me against the wall, drop me off the roof of your house, or let 4 two year olds play with me...i'm not gonna break!" at least thats's my opinion. good review

2 i never got the original boba fett's slave 1. i wish they would make one to scale with the minifigures. i would be so cool. i am also putting up a review of the clone turbo tank probably tomorrow. it is a different variation to the one in the index. edited by skipper 24, 03 august 2008 - 07:12 pm.

0 personally, i hated that set. i fell apart way to easily and was just not built well.

2 nice review! i will say i like the latest slave i the best as it is longer than jango's. i haven't seen the first one so i cant really comment.

2 you added some decals to the jango figure, right ? they seem to be suffering a little. i remember buying this set from the discount tent after my first visit to legoland windsor. i wasn't sure whether to buy it, even in their sale ... but i was glad i did once i'd built it :)

2 i really want one of these, if only it wasn't expensive. i probably won't buy it because it'd be scraped for parts too quick. great review though.

4 this set looks liek a good buy for $4. wish it was still around, but like you said, it needs accessories.

2 i remember having this set (actually i even still have it, at least the pars are somewhere ) when i was a child, and i used it for making races, as it is there for. all these many reviews let me think again at that i also planned to make some reviews for the town section. i got your message thebrickster, don't worry! i got a lot to do at the moment, but i should find some time this upcoming week.

2 i hate how the original release had the light-up windu, which was really lame, and one less clone trooper. i bought it when it first came out, so missed out on a good windu and another clone trooper.

2 did your version without the lul mace have trans blue grill things (like the ones on the back of the speeder) ? or was my set a one off.

4 i got the original version of this set with the luls mace windu figure. when tlc released the non-luls version i managed to swap - they sent me the new version (and a clone trooper iirc) and i mailed them back the old version. this was a great set; the suspension worked great and it rolled magnificently. nice review with good photos, but again your price is a little off: £69.99 is the rrp (unless the price you paid was £80). tk

2 good set, but it's flimsy as sin (but that may have been my rush job building it). mine got shoved off a bed oh, and i lost my light up mace >.> propably somewhere within the blue bin 'o' doom™ (aka the brick bucket™, or block/null™ ) edited by maiq the liar, 04 august 2008 - 10:15 pm.

2 thanks for the review kimt. i gave this "above average". i believe i had this one, but it was so long ago... i'm still a bit freaked out by the yellow ones! when i emerged from my dark ages i kept thinking "gee, i miss the people packs", but now that i have over 500 mini-figures i don't feel that way anymore. even so, i wish they would re-release some of the classic old ones.

2 i voted "above average" as well, but back in 1983, i would have probably gone much lower. sadly, i wasn't as interested in minifigs at the time. i appreciated the ones i had, but i really just wanted ships or bases, and would have gladly passed this by for something with one or two figures and a small moon rover. i skipped all of the classic minifig sets, space, castle and town. it was only upon coming out of my dark ages that i went minifig crazy. for me, this is above average because of the accessories. without them, it's an average set. with a small brick built droid or a rover, it would be outstanding. that said, i'd buy at least 10 copies now, though i'd rather have a 4 figure set with one of each colour including blue. i never had blue back then. i think castle lured me away. thanks for an interesting review! it gives me a chance to further explore why i changed from ship/set to minifig fan and bore all of eb with it.

2 i wonder why this set had no blue or black astronauts? whatever the case, i always loved the small minifig sets that lego released, as i could never get enough astronauts. my favorite was the set of futuron astronauts. why would the yellow astronauts freak you out, sinner? is it because they look nekkid? ;-)

2 lol, i don't know what's going on there!

0 wearing a cape, hat and bandanna and nothing else makes it creepier! zero1312, on aug 6 2008, 03:24 pm, said: i voted below average since i'm not a very big fan of classic space. *gasp*

4 thanks for the review, simonjedi. this just re-affirms that the v-19 is my highest priority this fall. behind the rgs, of course. is that new printed piece a 2 x 2 tile? it looks like an excellent detail part for mocing. those black pieces used on the landing gear look very bionicle-like. if they haven't been used before, i'd suspect they will be. not that i'm a bionicle expert or anything. it is a shame that this set only includes one clone. that seems to be the only drawback to the set. everything else looks spot on.

0 great review simonjedi -- i really like that you included lots of photos of your build. i put together my v19 torrent last night, and i was surprised by how heavy the completed ship is. it has some real heft. once it's finished, wow! it is a really cool ship. i was disappointed that the central wing doesn't really lock into place once it flips down. it just kind of droops there, so i attached a technic pin to the locking arm so it could plug into the 2x4 brick that's on the underside of the starfighter (this brick can be seen in your photo of the bottom of the ship). overall, the build is one of the more confusing that i've seen (i had to dismantle and re-build the first engine after i realized i'd left out a piece) and i kept thinking of the poor 7-year-old that gets this set as his/her very first lego set ever.

4 daxflame680, on nov 30 2008, 02:03 am, said: i built mine today. as soon as i tried to put it in attack position, the thingy rotates the wrong way and it falls apart. what a waste of $55 no not a waste. this is one of the best (if not the best) 2008 star wars set. all you need to do is build it correctly

4 i voted outstanding, this is simply an amazingly good looking train and comes with indeed 11 minifigs! i sold this one because i need a budget to build my ship, but i kept one because i love it! not bad for a first review ruben!

4 oh ruben you lucky so and so this set is one of the most beautful i have ever seen! splendid looking build and 11 figures, all the same faces like but still you get that old woman pig-tail head piece which is just great! i thought you meant the monorail set when you told me about this but guess i was wrong (don't laugh i've been away from lego for quite some time) and for 80 euros it was a real bargain from a great friend! really nice review hope this sets brings you years of joy!

4 i also voted "outstanding", for the simple reason that i've owned this set for a long time, but for most of the time it's been an anonymous heap of bricks mixed with all the other bricks i have. so about a year ago i started rebuilding it, and it now sits proudly next to (also rebuilt) 2150 on my shelf. imo; it's an excellent set, best of the 9v passenger trains, no doubt. and it combines the best of the 80's trains with that of the 90's - it's not some futuristic panorama-glassed low-slung train, but an honest, realistic-looking train that captures many of the features that passenger trains used to (and in some cases; still) have.

2 calvin, on aug 16 2008, 12:59 pm, said: well it makes the latest trains look crap. good point .

4 outstanding set and review, thanks for presenting it! i've had this since it first came out, but didn't think it would be that impressive, so i didn't bother opening it. now, i'm tempted. aside from the slight size issue, i can't find anything here to gripe about, except for the limited availability. i want 5. i think that makes me a parts monkey. eek eek. you're exactly right about this selling like mad. it's another one of those missed opportunities for tlg. sure, it's nice to get people to subscribe by offering it as part of brickmaster, but in the long run, put it in the stores for $6 and sell a million. just give us indy's manbag, we need it for postal employees and such. as is the running joke whenever i comment on one of your reviews, i'd give this a solid 985. not out of anything, just 985. or, in clearer terms: + 1/2 (though i voted 5)

4 thanks for the cool review, hinckley. when i saw the picture originally i thought it looked good, but not that good. but seeing the pictures in your review, i love this, i voted it as outstanding because it has great parts, and a brilliant construction, ingenious perhaps! sirnadroj, on aug 5 2008, 02:30 am, said: simply put, i'd have to admit this is one of the best indy sets. i agree. it's so sad we europeans can't get it...

4 thanks for the good review ! i can´t wait for mine to arrive! and just think how close paulc was in his reverse building of this which turned into a event exclusive in billund ! he was just wrong on the color of the headlight bricks (black instead of frown) and the rear bumper stuff which couldn´t be seen on the bag picture! kudos paulc! as for my badass patrol car and the sop (standard operation procedure) of cavity searches there´s more to see here over at brickzone - here´s a teaser: copmike

4 this set easily is above average for me. i had this as a little child, and whenever any of my relatives came to visit us, they brought me some lego. usually it was either this set or 6844 the really nice thing about this set are the alternate builds. for the low price you got a nice range of parts and cool ideas what to build with them. you could build a fleet of rovers, or the alternates, and everytime it was huge fun :)

2 i voted average. it's a cute set, and one which i built from parts many times as a kid. (i didn't own the set though.) thanks for the review!

4 this is by far my favourite outback series set! i loved the fact that you can bend the bridge in different directions so that the suspension of the car really worked to keep the car levelled, like you placed it in your last picture. i had lots of fun with this when it came out eleven years ago in 1997, the bridge scene could also be used in the adventurers serie of 1998. classic, highest rating, buy it if you don't already have it!

2 thebrickster, on aug 7 2008, 04:06 pm, said: at leat you were able to pick up two of the sets. do you still have them and/or the pieces? yes, i have the parts, the manuals, and even one of the boxes. unforutunaltey, the parts are mixed in a big pile of parts, as i never had any time to sort out my parts. you can see i used the yellow doors here, decals applied. the great thing about the copter was it had 2 suitcases, which as far as i can tell ain't a common part, not rare, but still nice to have. and it had the guy with the green jacket. the winch wasn't bad either, the only flaw was it was a "standard" lego copter, meaning similar ones where avalible in quite a few sets. do you plan to review it? staudie.

4 nice review of an interesting set. but i have a query... anyone know why it is actually called amazon crossing when it's meant to be in australia? also, the amazon runs through a jungle anyway. edited by shoc, 10 august 2008 - 03:44 pm.

4 nice review. this set looked very nice for it's time.

4 tks for the review once more jay ;) i totally agree with you jay !!! this set has very nice details suche as the mini gun, movable ladder, green barrels and great figs !!!! however, it is very expensive for what it is and i don't think there are that many very usefall parts in there !!!! (well, i could use those treads !!!). if i ever buy this set, its really not for the design, which i totally dislike...

4 thanks for the reviews once again. it looks like qite a nice set to me, although the european version will lose the big gun. i like some of the stickers (although i wish they were printed), and i actually quite like the dinosaur. i probably won't get it though, the set i'm most likely to get is the fire hammer.

4 here we are, my first clone wars set, and my first star wars review. here we have the wonderful droid gunship, one of the cheaper of the clone wars sets. this set is exclusive to wal-mart, and its one of the better exclusives out there (i'm looking at you, twilight ). first off we have a shot of the entire set with the box. a random page shot, along with pics of the parts list. the build is split up into three sections: the back, the cockpit, and the missles. the back has a lot of nice dark blue plates, and is the only part of the set which uses stickers. the bottoms shows various technic systems, which i'll get to later the cockpit has many details (mostly guns), and the rotating guns are a nice touch. the cockpit can fit a battle droid, but not a minifig. i'm not sure why a droid would want leather though the last part is loading this baby with the missles there are four black(small) and two dark bley (large) missles which are loaded in groups of three as sls. the middle mechanism is for the missiles, and the back part with the bionicle teeth are used ad landing gear the knob on top turns... to release the missiles on the clones ... leftover bits and the used ss(not so d this time around) the gunship versus a time traveling agent charge . overall build: 8/10 a basic build, but at some points repetitive. minifigs: 10/10 just your basic droids, you can't go wrong. design: 7/10 a basic design, with some interesting techniques. pieces: 9/10 a mix of old and new pieces, along with the return of this lovely piece which hasn't been seen for almost 10 years price: 8/10 $30 for a gunship? i'll take it! final verdict: 8/10 a great price for a small set like this, and it has a great bit of swooshability

4 nice review agentrick.$30 is a good price, but tlc think thats €40 so i'll have to pass. btw i thought this ship was supposed to hold many droids like in sw battlefront. oh well, its good for show. edited by skinny boy, 09 august 2008 - 09:31 pm.

2 what? my st came up as the first post....

4 this is a very nice looking set. it could do with a few more clones, but hopefully that will be fixed next year with battle packs. back to the set, i think the colors on this are great (i love dark blue) and the design is pretty good too. it seems to be pretty accurate compared to the real thing. thanks for the review!

0 this is a great set it's too pricey though if it was $10 or so cheaper i'd get it!

4 emergency evac set #: 6445 theme: town res-q year released: 1998 piece count: 97 minifigs: 1 list price: $8 (usd) in 1998, lego introduced a new theme called res-q. the theme was really a quasi-coast guard sub-theme of classic town. the theme included boats, helicopters, emergency vehicles, and even a water hovercraft. most notable was the black and yellow color combination that predominated the sets. i only picked up a couple of sets from the theme including this emergency evacuation vehicle that i consider a van. i never got into the theme, but looking back at these sets, i have gained a better appreciation for their value in classic town. let's take a look at 6445 in greater detail. starting with the box: the back of the box providing a few alternate models: and similar imagery on the instructions: the set includes one small sheet of decals for the van: 6445 has one res-q minifig that i find pretty nice. i like the neon orange reflectors: he has a nice printed backside with the word res-q prominently displayed: this little set includes an abundance of tools: a black walkie-talkie is not pictured here's the emergency van: i like the back section that has a nice winch with turning wheel and a few hooks for tools: here's the minifig pulling the grappling hook for some res-q action. this is my favorite part of this set: the van isn't too fancy but has some neat features: while i like the blue windshield piece for maybe space sets, i'm not really fond of its use for the van: the van has no steering wheel, but rather two levers for steering: on the top of the vehicle are two emergency alarms and some extra lights: the back of the van has a large opening piece that allows wide access to the back section: it comfortably fits a long gurney/stretcher: here's the driver resting on the gurney: he should never have tried to pick up the gurney without a 2nd res-q minifig. and a shot of the back section without the gurney: lastly, a picture of the complete set: final thoughts res-q is really a neat theme that has great play value for kids. while it's not one of my more favorite town sub-themes, it does offer some nice pieces and an abundance of black and yellow pieces. i think a few of the res-q sets go nicely with the divers theme released one year earlier in 1997. i had a chance to purchase the largest set of the theme, 6479 emergency response center, at half the price, but passed back in the late 90s. i'd be interested in finding out what other eb members think of this set and the res-q theme.

4 wow, and people complain that a military type line would be to violent. here we have half dead soilders and a space shuttle bombing people with severed skeleton heads! i have to say this is the first time i've heard of this theme. i like the colors as most have pointed out. the base plate is preety cool two. could use it to moc up some garages.

4 that's it! thanks for the review but now you make me want to build my own one! thanks a lot! on a more serious note, i really like this set and have always wished to aquire it. i have two broken tie interceptors, so this should be a easy build. and as someone in the pirate forum, i think, said, it would be a great baseplate for building cave to hide the booty! thanks pmg and welcome!

2 thanks for the review pmj . i like the play value in this set even if i don´t own it . the way the orbs are put into the rocket is awesome and i really like it, but at the end the set have some lack of detail .

2 set: 7680 - the twilight theme: star wars year released: 2008 piece count: 882 price: $aud149.99 (or $159.99 if you buy at tru!), 99.99 euro, $us99.99 pity the twilight. when rumours of the set name first circulated, speculation was swift: 'twilight - that suggests something sleek, elegant and mysterious.' anticipation mounted! fan-frenzy grew! finally a pic leaked! and the verdict was... 'clunk-a-dunk' it appeared that in the jedi off-season, anakin was running something that looked like an intergalactic garbage scow, like roger wilco in the old sierra space quest pc games. blocky and bley seemed to sum it up. the set went from being one of the most anticipated to one of the least liked of 2008 pretty much instantly. it's a mark of that dislike that in the eb clone wars review feeding frenzy nobody has so far even bothered to post a few pics of this set even 2 weeks after it's official release! i'm here to redress that imbalance now and find out if 7680 is as horrendous as everyone originally thought part 1: box & parts front of the box. it's quite big, same size as the 10144 sandcrawler. annoyingly, it's the old style with the perforated corners that you have to tear to flip open the lid. detail of the back, showing set functions: interior of the box - a lot of wasted space. the set comes with 2 instruction manuals, each 76 pages. and no dss sheet! polybags! 13 of 'em. like the other cw sets, these are unnumbered. parts ahoy! you can tell at a glance that this set is comparable to the at-te, although there a large proportion of the 800+ parts here are technic pins and bley plates. part 2: minifigs and build the set comes with 4 figs (or 3.5, depending on how you look at rotta ): anakin, ahsoka, r2-d2 and rotta. very disappointing that there's nothing new here for such a high-priced exclusive, although i guess it is maybe movie accurate. anyway, to paraphrase the wise patsy stone, you can never have enough hats, shoes or new anakin/ ahsoka hairpieces so it's not too bad. pics of the build in progress. a quarter of the way through we can already see that this is one of those 'convoluted technic frames with some plates affixed' type builds: half-way and the smaller wing is added: at the three quarter mark the giant single wing is added: and voila! done! the final quarter is a race to attach all the exterior surfaces and details such as the engine and escape pod. the build itself is a mixed blessing. it is very technic oriented. i'm not a technic-ally minded person and don't really have much of a conceptual grasp of how everything functions until i see the final result, so i find these type of builds a little uninteresting. pins, axles and beams? give me bricks any day! i really liked the 7676 gunship and the 7679 fighter tank although they do contain some technic framework, they are largely brick-built ships, especially the fighter tank which is solid, largely brick built and full of neat functions. the 7680 build is one of the most technicy builds i've ever undergone in a system set, akin to the experience of building the 10178 motorised at-at. but whereas with that set you could understand the need for a technic framework (the thing walks!) a lot of this seemed excessive. yes, the twilight does some have nice functions, and it is so large and heavy it does need a strong skeleton, but to me it just seemed too much and aesthetics have been sacrificed for (in some cases limited) functionality. i will discuss in more detail what i mean as i look at different parts of the set. on the upside, this is the only non-symmetric set in the cw range, so at least every page and new step brings something different! part 3: a closer view close-up of the main body of the ship: front-on. it is well-designed how the figs appear in line of sight (unlike the 6211 where jabba and leia were photoshopped in to the box art). don't ask what rotta is doing out of the line of vision there. some things are better left unsaid. side view, showing escape pod (smaller cylinder) and drive: top view: rear view, showing back door. the rear deck is huge. indeed, the whole ship is huge. oddly so. i don't know if this is movie-scale or not, but i've seen people complain the fighter tank is too big (!) and that set is nothing compared to this baby! it's wider than the gunship and in wingspan and length is almost bigger. here's a few pics next to an mtt for comparison. pretty big, hey? turning to the dark side must be good for business. even if all you can buy is a rusty old beast like this, at least you could comfortably squash pretty much every vehicle in the opposing fleet just by landing on it. at least now you can see why it costs so much. the official pics make it look smaller, somehow, by truncating the rear and wing. the ship is in fact so big you can't really pose it with wings open - only hold it that way. i was too lazy to build a giant trans-clear support strut so propped it up on a shoebox instead. the wing opens very neatly - you push a technic lever and a pin holding the bottom wing pops out quite smoothly. the little top turret can move up and down as well to get the full cross-shaped effect. part 4: features and functions the front cockpit folds down very neatly, although i find the build here a little weak. whee! it goes all the way down to the floor. the mechanism is cool, but it takes up an awful lot of space. basically the whole front is cockpit and all lego could manage for controls is 2 printed 1x2 tiles as well (not pictured here, but they're attached to the part that folds up and down). there's also no way for anyone to get in or out of the cockpit. and an invisible windscreen! technology has come a long way. side view, looking from wing. r2d2 is here as well as some tools. you can also glimpse here one of the main problems with the set. despite being a huge boxy ship, there's no interior! none! the twilight doesn't even have an internal floor. all the room inside is taken up by the landing gear which folds up - again, a clever function but it really gets in the way of the set as a whole. kudos to the designer for coming up with stable, working landing gear, but too clever by half if it means that this giant ship ends up basically being one tiny cockpit and a rear door at the back that doesn't lead to any interior! underside showing landing gear when open: and closed - when the wing is folded down, the gear is locked in place, which is pretty neat. space-consuming, but neat. the rear section. the door, when opened, reveals an orange cupboard and a tow-line, as ahsoka uses in the box art. the door clicks into place when open and can be released by pressing the technic bit at the top. again, clever, but pointless as you can't get inside! ahsoka can indulge in a little recreational bungee-jumping if she so wishes: the rear deck is so large that it is wasted just being used so ahsoka can bungee-jump. i came up with a much better use for it. outdoor garden! despite having one roboticised hand, anakin was still quite the green thumb. and his light-saber was very useful as a hedge trimmer. so much so that he set up a side business between rotta-rescue missions. here's a promotional postcard: a few other bits and pieces. the gun turret on the enormous mega-wing can only hold one flick fire missile at a time (you do get two, though ) rear engine detail: the escape pod sits neatly on the side and is basically built the same way as the gunship bacta tank: the pod sits on these tehcnic pins and is held in place by the light bley parts: part 5: in conclusion the twilight is a huge ship, with a huge amount of great functions - folding wing, folding cockpit, rear door, escape pod, retractable landing gear! but this functionality comes at a price - a very complex technic build and zip interior. compared with the gunship, for example, which is stuffed with nooks and crannies, the twilight suffers in this respect. i also think it is just too large - it doesn't really fit with the other craft and vehicles released with the clone wars line. i may be wrong and it is movie-accurate, but when you have all the cw sets laid out it does stick out like a poor thumb. part selection is ok, with the only interesting things being a few dark orange plates, the orange cupboard and the big trans-neon green radar dish. don't get me wrong, i don't think this is a bad set at all. it's just the other cw sets are so sweet! i would say it's an above average set in a field crammed with excellent ones. if you're a completist, buy it, but if for example you'd rather invest in another at-te to upgrade your republic army, then i couldn't really disagree with you either and to finish on a light note, i'd like to remind you that you do get another ahsoka hairpiece, which can be used for all sorts of things. ugha warrior upgrade: dr inferno hair transplant: and finally, attack of the deadly blue-ringed octopus, native to australia's beaches and oceans! thanks for reading!

2 darkrebellion, on aug 12 2008, 12:17 pm, said: i like this ship even if it looks so bulky but i need to buy first other sets, so maybe this beast will be landing in my collection the next year (or this one if i am lucky ). i can just ask for something, can you post a pic of all your clone wars sets together with this one (all the sets in one pic, not many pics with this an each set ) please . i think a lot of people feel the same way - there was so much good stuff to get in the first wave that this is probably a backburner set for a lot of people, and some are probably waiting to see the movie to see how prominently it features. i will try and take a pic with some other cw sets, i don't have all of them though and some need to be reassembled as i built them on holiday and then had to pack them away i do think this line of sets has been the best sw lego wave released though. all of the recent releases have been amazing in their own way.

4 thanks a lot for a very nice and entertaining review! your photos were really nice and there have been some reviews lately that have such blurry pics... cough.. cough... it was a pleasure to see you can 1. put lego bricks together 2. write a review 3. handle your camera! i think this ship is underrated, it is really nice! i love the playing features like landing gear and back door, perhaps just cause i had to get along with so called landing gears in the past, that did not work at all (7140 for example..). and i simply love that there is space inside. you said there is not really some cause of the landing gear mechanism, but it seems it should be easily fixed. do you think there is enough space to put some plates over the landing gear and add some beds, kitchen und tv? i think this set is so perfect to mod it into a clone wars mobile home, your back garden ist just perfect for this. i prefer this over the at-te and over a 2nd gunship! thanks a lot for the review!

0 i will not be picking this one up. the main thing is that it simply looks akward. it is big and bulky, and seems to have random pieces on it with not reall streamline feel to it. i also agree that for an exclusive that it $100, it needs more than just 3.5 mini figures. anikan and ashoka and rotta already come in the at-te, which is cheaper and has more figures. r2-d2 is a figure that i am sure everybody has at least 4 or 5 of. for that kind of money, i expect something with at least one unique figure, and more than 4. i also want just a cleaner and better designed set. this is probably the letdown of the collection so far. every collection needs one.

0 thanks for the review. i for one will get this set. i collect and therefore i need it. i vision something like this: a: i buy the set b: i built the set c: pics for my bs account d: set taken apart. sad, but true. it's not much, but super for parts. i agree (from what your review showed me) that this set is a little too much technic. a thing that's been invading our beloved brick built sets in the past years. i really have no need for a retractable front or functioning landing gear. what i need is a kick-ass ship with neat design and cool interior. the twilight does not offer that. "look at the size of that thing"

4 i bought four of these sets. i guess this was the best selling impulse set so far. great idea to have weapons and helmet choice. as for the price, i'd say 7090 is surprisingly cheap!

4 very good set. indeed the possibility to alter the knight's appearance hugely boosts the value! very smart thinking of tlc. got one of these so far, but if i ever do a castle-related comic or animation, this will be the set i buy tons of.

4 argh! what i was typing kept getting deleted by my stupid keyboard!!!!! on topic: this looks like a great little set, i could use a few of these, but i haven't seen any at a local store. too bad for me i suspose . great review, and i like the green plate on the bottom, never can have too many greens for my small but expanding swamp i'm building. hope i can pick some of these up eventualy.

4 this little bugger brought me back from my dark ages! as a movie fan, i just couldn't resist the thought of making an animation with living lego skeletons (i'm referring to ray harryhausen's work on the classic jason and the argonauts here). buying the indy sets stopped me from getting a lot more castle sets. though in time i added the final joust, the wizard and the impulse knight to my collection, as well as buying more unique figs (king, princess) from expensive castle sets off bricklink. so yeah. great little set. two crownies, a skeleton and a skeletal horse, you just cannot resist that! even if you hadn't been buying lego for 5 years. as far as i'm concerned, this set is one for the ages! i love it!

4 lovely set. nice collection of weapons. cool horse-accesoires for the white knight, cool black skeletal horse on the dark knight's side. loving the printed armours of both knights! and, as opposed to kimt apparently, i really dig the black helmet. i feel there's a lord of the rings-flavour to it with those curves. well designed!

4 another small set my local target doesn't have. they don't have the best castle selection, they only really have dwarven mines and castle seiges. i'll buy this if i see it there though, because it looks like a great little set. i could use the awesome knight, and a skeleton that has a regular body so he looks like he is in armor!!!!!

2 i'm not a huge fan of this set but it is a great way to nab a fully mounted knight complete with a very attractive barding. given that in prior years it wasn't possible to get a barded horse in such a small set, this set is actually a decent way to build a mounted cavalry for your kingdom. looking at bricklink, it would probably cost as much to buy the knight, horse and weapons separately, and that doesn't take into account the skeleton or the extra bricks. despite my indifference to this set, i actually have purchased four of them in the past year simply because there isn't a cheaper way to acquire a mounted knight. (a quick question about the poll: are we voting on the quality of the set, or the quality of the review?) later. edited by blueandwhite, 13 august 2008 - 05:50 am.

4 this looks like a really great set! i wasn't around in '88 to get it but i like it! it actually has things inside the interior! thanks for the review. hinckley, on aug 13 2008, 06:11 pm, said: there were quite a few sets in the 1980's that weren't sold in the us. hooray! (sort of) in england we don't get, in normal shops, batman and spongebob sets, and not at all - avatar sets, and brickmaster, but america gets all of these. maybe it's revenge for america's lego neglect in the 80's. hinckley, on aug 13 2008, 06:11 pm, said: i remember reading once that it was because they contained wine glasses and tlg felt they wouldn't be able to market a toy that encourage the drinking of alcohol. this set was one of them. they didn't want to encourage the drinking of alcohol in america but were fine encouraging it in other places? maybe that's why my country has such a big problem with binge drinking... or maybe not.

4 that's a great review of a great set, hinckley! i voted for outstanding : this set is simply amazing! i regrettably don't own this set since it's very hard to find on ebay and/or the stickers are missing. but nevertheless i hope that i one day will be able to get this awesome set - or even better - see tlg releasing a new city villa in a style similar to that brilliant set . klaus-dieter edited by klaus-dieter, 13 august 2008 - 06:30 pm.

4 nice set what a great find, this is one thing i think the tlg has forgotten about, the creator houses are nice but they are not really geared toward a town them (no mini figs, cars etc) these sets were and that adds so much to a town layout it can't be overlooked. i really like this i may have to start my ebay searching..... thanks hinckley

4 lots of rare parts and a good baseplate, sounds great. how much did this cost you and where did you get it from?

0 it's a nice house but perhaps a little sparsh on detail. just a few more pieces for additional furniture would have been nice. like the car though.

4 thanks for the wonderful review. this is really a beautiful set - i love the old lego houses from the 80's and 90's - they were always very quaint and well designed. actually, i like the old car designs too, but only for their nostalgic value (in reality, they are very unrealistic and look more like go carts). that said, not all four wide cars are silly looking - the 4-wide cars in these city sets are awesome and fit in with the modern city style great.

4 this is an awesome set, man... and a great review. just too bad it is so rare! i voted 5. by the way, does anyone know if there is a review for this? or other sets that come with a camper, perhaps? also, i was wondering if the creator houses are in scale and could be used with minifigs and such.

4 good set, i laughed at the dynamite, but not as much as that axe... not many trees on the rapids. looks like she's got more than dynamite to cause havoc in the harbour...

4 aerial recovery set #: 6462 theme: town res-q year released: 1998 piece count: 201 minifigs: 3 list price: $25 (usd) my personal favorite of the res-q theme released in 1998 was this helicopter, 6462 aerial recovery. the set offered a pretty modern helicopter, raft, three-wheeler, rescue gurney and net, and three figs including a diver. the set is action-packed and offers a high degree of play value. starting with the box, front side and back: front back i always liked the rough ocean/sea water pictured in the boxart. the same image from the front of the box appears on the cover of the instructions: but the back of the instructions picture a plain view of the copter: one sticker sheet with a few "res-q" stickers is included, mainly for the tail section of the helicopter: interestingly, the set includes three figures, one being a diver. what i always found strange is the inclusion of an "x-treme team" diver who has the logo on his torso (although it's a very nice fig): back shot: i think this was my first set with a lego three-wheeler. i always liked it a lot: the set includes a yellow raft (also found in the divers sets) and some scuba gear: note: the raft has a black piece in it's center for lifting up by the helicopter for sea and emergent rescue, a gurney can also be lifted by the helicopter: the set also includes a net with hook to lift the three-wheeler and other items. an extra string pulls the net closed: here's a shot of the helicopter: the front section has a large trans. blue piece enclosing the cockpit: inside is a printed radar slope: a smaller trans. blue piece appears a bit higher for access to the middle section of the helicopter and/or a small storage area: in the middle section is an place for the gurney and a box for storing some of the adventure gear: here's a picture showing the gurney: on the side is a pulley mechanism that swings to the right when not in use: on the opposite side is the winch to raise and lower the grappling hook: here's a picture of an open storage box: i like the tail section with propeller: decal is not shown here's another shot of the copter from a different angle: and the final image, the entire set: final thoughts personally, i think this is pretty nice set. i like the thought of using the helicopter to rescue people at sea using the working winch. extras like the trike/three-wheeler and the rescue net make the set even more fun. hope you enjoy this res-q review.

2 metalandi, on aug 15 2008, 07:16 am, said: do you have any other res-q sets left to review? it would be an honour for me to also do a review of one or more sets which are left thanks metalandi. this and the emergency evac set are the only re-q sets i have. i would encourage you to share a review as you have done some very nice reviews.

4 looks like a nice helicoptor, i love the 2 cockpits. i love the diver's head, i really need one of those.

4 this helicopter is so cool and i agreed with you that this is a high playablity set. it's not common to see such a big scale helicopter which has two cockpits back then. the color scheme works well for me. with so much features such as the lowering of the grappling hook, storage box, storing of the gurney and etc. one thing which can be improved onto the helicopter is the rotors. it could be extended a little longer as the size of the helicopter is too big. it makes the rotors rather weak as it is not able to support the weight. i am confused why there is an extreme team personnel there. i thought he was supposed to be recovered from the res-q team? although there is so many questions in my head such as why include the black tri-cycle bike, extreme team, and etc but this is still one very good set to play with. too bad, i had never seen this before. somehow, through your review, i like it very much. the only big scale helicopter which i owned is the 7738 coast guard helicopter and lift raft. neverthless, i gave this a "4". thanks brickster.

2 thanks for the review brickster, i do own this set in it's original form, the only drawback that i have noted previously is the lack of rotor's and the cobraesq of the copter body i wish it had a larger fuselage but i still have it and i still like it despite my criticism....which i am sure is in my eyes only. thanks again brickster. i wish i had bought some of the other res q sets but of course i only bought three.

4 this set was my first set ever from the resq series, and i loved it entirely! ofcourse i modded it slightly here and there after hours and hours of fun and excitement, it has great play value, even for a set in this size

2 very nice review. this is another set which i had never seen before when i am in my dark age. quite an useful set, especially with the accessories and the minifigs' torsos. the speedboat is able to hold the car and the rubber rescue boat. how can the driver steer this boat with so many things blocking the way? i can't seemed to find its control though. thanks for doing this review.

4 well i for one really like this set it has to be one of the nicer ribbies that tlg has made tons of playability and nice options for redesign, great set overall. thanks for the review.

4 6004 crossbow cart review because i may start collecting castle here is a review of one of my few castle sets. please note i hurriedly put his together meaning some parts are the wrong color, look out for them! this review will also be done in my star wars review style. the lighting is also particularly bad in the pics. on with the review... parts: 20 figs: 1 price: ????? 1.overview and fig the whole set. the fright knight's knight. the disemboweled knight. the head printing is just longer then the helmet visor. 2. the cart the cart has 3 crossbows and 2 norman type shields. the cart's advanced defense and weapons systems. all the parts from the cart. (forgot to add the fig in) 3.extras & overall here are all my castle figs. remember i don't collect castle. (yet ) oh yeah i forgot to put one of the old skellies and a ghost on there. could a castle fan tell me if any of these minifigs are rare. i have no idea because i don't collect castle. build: 6/10 pretty standard for a impulse. minifigs: 7/10 nice minifig with lots of accessories. design: 8/10 this set made way for some of the new castle carts of similar size. parts: 10/10 3 crossbows, 2 shields, arrow quiver, and spear as well as cool minifg in a 20 piece set! price: 10/10 well i don't know but lego was cheaper in '97 so it gets 10. playability: 5/5 pretty much standard for a impulse set. overall 8/10 good parts and price as well as minifig scores this set an 8. thanks for reading.

2 about the rarest one up there is that black ninja. i only have one ninja and he is dark grey. i also have five samurai. the witch may be fairly rare but i am not sure. i didn't really collect much in the fright knight era.

4 originally shared in the history & adventure forum for its adventure attributes, here's my favorite of the outback collection: first, let me say that this little set is one of my all-time favorites because it can be used to sumplement a number of different themes. 1) the set makes a great little adventure airstrip for adventurers and more recent, the indiana jones theme (see also german headquarters and port adventure). i've also used the set as an addition to my wild west town. the tan baseplate and windmill works great, just subtract the plane, modern equipment, and figs. and lastly, as the set was intended, as an outback/desert airstrip. set description: outback airstrip set # 6444 pieces: 157 minifigs: 3 release date: 1997 original price: $20 (usd) starting with the box: and the backside. notice the alternate models. i love the swamp boat: the building is my favorite part of the set. it is simple, has a little detail, two great roof pieces, and a single green window (great piece!): check out the great windmill piece. it's my only one and makes a great part for wild west and that farm you always wanted to build. i used it for the barnhouse of barnabas higgens and spring valley ranch on the side of the building is a great radio and a clear glass: unfortunately, no furniture can be found within the building: and now the airplane: front view; i love the twin propellors: side view: and the rear section: the back has a small cargo hold for some boxes/freight or some gear needed in the outback: the set includes three figs, two with cool shades: and some great equipment. i love the boom box: a shot of the whole set: and another: summary: as i mentioned above, this set is very versatile and can suplement a few different themes. it's my personal favorite of the outback collection and i'm really glad i was able to find the set in the late 90s (i almost didn't buy). sets like this are timeless and so much fun to build and display. hope you enjoy the review. edit: additional reviews: review by agentrick57 (december 24, 2007) outback airstrip review in history & adventure forum (february 10, 2008)

4 the building is great and detailed, with a few mods it could be added to my castle town. i don't really like the plane though, seems kind of abstract, not really good in my opinion, but i bet it would be easy to mod to look better.

4 set#: 7103 theme: star wars set name: jedi duel pieces: 74 release: 2002 price: 10 usd minifigs: 2 (count dooku and yoda) links: 7103 brickshelf folder bricklink reference catalog peeron.com introcomment: i remember getting this set solely because i collect star wars. as i rebuild it and took pics of it, i found that i actually like this set for different reasons. dooku's speeder is pretty cool and the lightsabre rocks. the dooku minifig is also great. what's not so great is the flythingy and getting another yoda. though that's kinda hard not to get in a set focused on their duel "you can't see the wires, because they digitally removed them." "be careful or i'll digidally remove your head" - steven seagal [i hope i quoted that one right ] so to get the review on the move, i'll impress you all with a box picture: neat, huh? one of the smaller boxes, but still kinda big when consider that you only get 74 pieces and 2 minifigs. the instruction isn't that big as i said, the dooku minifigs is awesome i love the print on his torso that combines the brown cape with the torso and also the head is neatly designed. not a fleshie, though. this was before the flesh-license-facelift a sideview of the light blue speeder. mmmm that crome light sabre hilt is nice the design of the speeder is also ok, and without the usual off-colour-scheme bricks. no tan or yellow sticking out there yeah, i'd panic too if this came right at me...who wouldn't when noone's driving? and a rear shot. i think the design is a little off. the shields makes it all a little too open in my opinion. the printed bricks are a kick and thus evens the score here. this hideous design is meant to flip yoda around the air. put him in this funfair from hell thing and give him a twister he and dooku will never forget. my guess is that it's there to add some playability, but it's just odd and quite useless. much like the playability soccer thingies in the ultimate light sabre duel the verdict: ups and downs. this set offers both. i rate it as "average" since the size and price of the set make it acceptable to have odd things. confused? good so am i making a small set isn't that easy and remeber this set is from 2002 and a lot has happended since then, designwise that is. what do you think?

2 oky wan kenobi, on aug 18 2008, 02:41 pm, said: wasn't this the only [yoda] that was ever released except for the one in the dagobah/x-wing set? sure, he is not the best fig with the unmovable legs and all, but still: it's yoda! edit: i'm pretty sure we got a yoda in the wookiee catamaran set from revenge of the sith ...runs to check brickset... yep, there's a yoda in that set, as well. but the jedi duel is the only reasonably priced set with the green force-guru. nevermind, looks like a couple of other members already covered yoda's availability in other sets. back on topic: great review, and a real blast from the past. i never did get this set, just didn't care for the speederbike or the weird piece of equipment. thanks for explaining that it's supposed to be used to "force-jump & spin" yoda all over the place. i never knew that's what it was for. anyway, wish i had known yoda and dooku were going to be impossible to get later; i may've picked this set up just for the minifigs. edited by bamaker, 18 august 2008 - 10:39 pm.

2 i wonder how expensive this set would be on ebay. (shop victoriously)

4 i missed this set.but i reallly like the yoda and count dooku.i especially like count dooku's lightsaber.one thing though,is it me oris yoda's lightsaber blue in the picture? edited by pr0visorak, 20 august 2008 - 12:21 pm.

4 great review, kimt! at that time, it was still in my dark age and i hated myself not to get this set earlier. this is quite inexpensive and you are able to get two greatest characters especially count dooku. the minifigs are excellent, especially the unique design of count dooku's lightsaber. i have no problem with the speedbike, as it looks quite alright to me. as for the elevation of yoda's jump adds some playabilty, but that does not work well for me. nevertheless, the main attractive factor is count dooku and i have to rate it a "5". i never own a yoda, except for the magnet version.

2 i know we have another review of this set, but since i just got it, i thought i would share my comments on it. set name: droid gunship platform number: 7678 pieces: 329 price: $29.99 before we begin i will say that i like having a droid gunship, but i still hope we get a maf: hmp droid gunship: maf droid gunship: on to the review. here we have the box. it is really shiny, and smooth, and fits the set's size okay. it has a clean, bright look, and is truley outstanding. the back of the box, which has the features of the set, as well as the other three cw sets. the contents the siticker sheet. no to bad, and the stickers have clear backs, which is always nice. instructions here we have the figs(two new droids and one older armed droid for the cockpit), and the extra parts. the build starts with the flat base. pretty simple. the bottom. the side lasers. next is the head: it starts pretty soild. the side buble laser turrets. loveing the detail. on the ship: the "lid" and eyes. the finished cockpit. cozy interior... would have had more room if it were the maf though. the front landing gear. simple and effective. the back landing gear. the rockets. the clips are annoying. but it make the rockets work so, i guess it was nessecary. mounted on the bottom. not very secure, but that's why they are meant to be dropped on the clones.... the finished ship. --------------------------------------------- let me say that the droid gunship is a nice set indeed. final rating: 86% hope you enjoyed the review! please, if you have a ny questions, pic requests, etc, then by all means, ask! best regards, vbbn

4 very nice review. one thing you have to consider: when lego sees pics of the star wars universe, they have to decide which would be the easiest set to make with the most playibility. therefore, they chose the hmp. quote thanks for the review. it's always good to have a 2nd opinion on a set. i've added the usual poll and i'll index it tomorrow (must sleep). super pics and great to have "in-build" pics default_thumbup.gif a fine set which i'll surely buy when i find it. default_hmpfbad.gif where? edited by lt. col. thok, 18 august 2008 - 10:07 pm.

4 ~vbbn~, on aug 18 2008, 05:54 pm, said: final rating: 86% how'd you figure that? but seriously, this looks like a great set, and am planning on making it my next lego purchase. how did you ge tis for $25? i almost bought it the other day, the box makes it look so cool. something about the new clone wars packaging makes you want to buy all the sets on the shelf! thanks for the review, darthperson edited by darthperson, 18 august 2008 - 11:09 pm.

4 darkrebellion, on aug 18 2008, 05:29 pm, said: thanks for the cool review vbbn . i think this set is really cool and very neat detailed to be a small set , also thanks for the clear pics . you're welcome. jifel, on aug 18 2008, 05:48 pm, said: nice review! thanks for the clear pics. also, if you place a brick so the axles on the bomb mechanisms tips are touching the brick, the bombs should stay on. jifel i do that, but smetimes my hand will slip and knock one loose.

2 and it's now a part of the index. i've added it as "review 2" since we've already got one. thanks for the review and it's always nice to have nmore than one view/opinion on a given set

4 i don't know what it is about this set but i love it. i can't get enough of it. it looks amazing. nice review.

4 metalandi, thanks for doing up this review! this is a chance for me to gain some insight for extreme team theme. this is a very interesting set that can be used for so many purposes. 3 different vehicles, wide range of accessories and nice minifigs. what i love the most, is the mountain, bridge and tent. it provided so much playability. i am very impressed with it. thanks for sharing.

4 this was the first rock raiders set i got. i really like it, and i think i got all of them except the huge cargo airlift thing. i remember these sets coming out and getting the big base for christmas, though they are all destroyed now... sadly... . nice review.

2 when i first saw this review title, i thought it said "rapid river review" thinking it was an indian set (6766). nice review though. i never got into rock raiders. i would have loved the large drill bit piece for set #s 4970 and 4940. this set looks like a little boulder hawler, and a nice set to introduce someone unfamilar with the theme. i esp. like the fig and the little 2x2 drill bit tile. the overall set looks like it has some very useful mining-type pieces. nice review and thanks for sharing.

4 easily one of the best town sets ever (and pretty expensive for its size too, is/was it that rare?). i hope i still have all the pieces from mine, unfortunately, my stickers are in pretty bad shape (took them off because i needed the bricks, stupid stickers covering multiple parts , only downside to this set). the design is simple, yet so detailed, and the pizza van looks great. 5/5

2 jopiek, on aug 24 2008, 10:48 pm, said: a very good set indeed, we have at least 3 of them, but we like them all. what do you mean by "we"? you own three sets of the orignal 1994 series or the 2002 legend series?

2 got this one as well, not much surprises in such a small set, but the fast-food pizza idea is pretty cool. as far as i know only the small mcdonalds promo and this set are related to food/restaurant thing (until the cafe corner that is) but since i have a classic lego city i can't miss this set.

4 great review! i really like this set and plan on getting it on bricklink. it would certainly add something to my collection!

4 thanks for all of your kind words and great support for this once famous legend set, which got a second chance to be re-released again for people whom had missed it before. indeed, this is the kind of lego sets which is great addition for any lego town or city. thebrickster, on aug 26 2008, 02:26 pm, said: excellent review white fang! - and a great set to commemorate the establishment of classic town.net. i almost ordered this set back when it was re-released by lego, but passed on it. i'm so mad at myself! this has all the terrific qualities that classic town sets exemplify. i love the delivery truck and the pizza oven. a great review from one of the "master eb reviewers" - outstanding! hope you managed to find a good deal in the internet. that last comment of yours certainly makes my day bright. thanks brickster. you are one of them as well. lockt, on aug 26 2008, 03:52 pm, said: one of my greatest lacks in my town...i can remember going to the store to buy this one, and ending up with another set (pirates) at home :p thank you for the review, it might put me on track in finding this set on the web and purchasing it to correct my childish change of mind, so long ago ;-) what pirate set did you actually buy instead of the pizza to go? hope you are able to find a good buy on the internet. imperialshadows, on aug 26 2008, 04:53 pm, said: surprise? free? i'm not even close to free, i'm rather expensive, but i do have a surprise for everyone! i think you'll be interested in the companion article to this fine review, my first set restoration project. geez, you twisted my words "free" indeed, you are "dear". lastly, thanks for that lovely surprise. i really enjoyed viewing that sweet decals of yours. looks tasty too. imperialshadows, on aug 26 2008, 04:53 pm, said: again, great job whitefang, excellent review, and tlg, this is a star amongst your sets. think about that when you're designing new ones. seriously. actually, this is one of my surviving stars among my sets. well, i will need to find better sets for the new ones. section8, on aug 27 2008, 10:07 pm, said: i got the original version as a surprise one christmas. my parents liked the design so much they got it for me. this is one of the best town sets. if it didn't have the delivery van it would have been on par with 6683 hamburger stand, a great set in its own right. the van, and they way the back holds the pizzas, is ingenious and bumps this set up to the highest levels. i agreed with you. in fact, recently there was a hot topic created by k.d on what is your favourite takeaway. look at here for more discussions and views.

4 i used to want this set so badly and i almost got it when it was rereleased. i still wonder why i didn't because with a building, van, 5 pizzas, and a then very rare female fig. this set would have been perfect for someone with a smaller collection like i had then. what surprised me the most is how well this set still holds up to others today. off to bricklink!

2 thanks for the nice review of this great set, whitefang! i always want to grab one, but the price to buy it now is too forbidding... i also always think the girl minifig is supposed to be a customer... lego is really up to everyone's own imagination... edited by alywin, 15 may 2009 - 06:27 pm.

4 indexed allright, hi everybody again! today, i'm gonna review the biggest set of the res-q subtheme, 6479 emergency response center. with this one i think, the reviews of all the res-q sets are complete now, and while i'm in a reviewing mode right now i thought i'd bring that up. this set hast got many nice aspects and also some very rare pieces, and comes with a wonderful amount of vehicles, including a speedboat, a tow truck, a helicopter, and a trike which can pull a little boat. so sit down, get your popcorn and beer, we're off to stormy weather at the coast! sub-theme: res-q set nr.: 6479 name: emergency response center number of minifigs: 5 number of pieces: 420 release year: 1998 unfortunately i don't have many of the boxes of my res-q sets anymore, so i'll start right off with the instructions this time: on the backside there is no alternate model as usual this time, but only a different shot of the whole set: next, a general overview, sorry about the slightly bad picture quality on some pics this time: originally this set has 5 minfigs (which all are really nice!), but the guy who drives the tow truck has been lost in the flood here's a picture of the missing fig: let's move on to the vehicles, we have something for the water, the ground and the air in this set, first the great tow truck: i love the mechanism with the hooks in the back: next on, da speedboat! at the rear, it's got a stretcher and a wench, which adds a lot of playability: if there's a a little accident near the coast, the trike comes to appearance: for more complicated stuff, we have a little helicopter (i broke the rotating piece at the top yesterday, ouch! : ) no space for a victim you say? well, not really, but the helicopter also got a wench with a hook in the back: now it comes to the station itself, at the docks a neat life belt sign is mounted (remember, at this time there weren't real ones as today): a little more right an equipment holder is placed, with various tools on the front... ...and fire fighter equip at the back: at the very front a little lighttower secures the shelter: i haven't quite found out what this thing is supposed to be, maybe somebody knows another equipment holder, this time with all the stuff you need for diving: more equipment... ...and even more! we come to the hear piece of the station, the control room with lots of buttons and scrrens: last but not least, a quick shot of all the accesoires and tools that you get, which really is an a-ma-zing amount! this set might have a few junioriced pieces, as the big window in the front or the "briedge" on the roof, but that doesn't matter, because there is nearly one other set in which you get so much rare pieces and such an overwhelming amount of accesoires, so i can recommend that for everybody who is a pieces-fanatic. not to forget the playability, the great figs and the, in my opinion very good color scheme. once again thanks for taking the time reading and looking at my review, i hope you liked it. edited by thebrickster, 31 december 2009 - 09:19 pm.

2 thanks for that very elaborate review nice to have several pics from different angels. amazingly well done if this is your first i've added a poll and will index this review within this week (along with all the other topics i am to index )

2 wow, this is one great review! fantastic pictures, this looks like one cool set with heaps of neat functions. a shame it doesn't include exclusive figures (like ahsoka and captain rex in the at-te or plo koon and asajj ventress in the gunship), but you can't have everything. so again, thanks for this sweet review! ~peace

2 nice review i hope i can get this set [as well as agents, city & other sw stuff...] and nice pics, i didnt think they were bad, i thought they were pretty good

4 splendid photos and well written review! i love it. i've owned and built mine and must say it's a good set and the tank don't disappointment in terms of design and playability. i got mine stickered, well been a perfectionist i am :p thanks again for the review that it should deserved :d

4 baby, i will like to take a moment to said "outstanding piece of review for your first attempt!" you have done well with the pictures and its flow. i have to admit that i love this fighter tank very much. the downside of it which is overpriced, and two clone troopers do not really justify the purchase. well, if i have the spare cash, i will defintely get one of this. keep it up.

4 thanks for the really cool review baby . i think this is an awesome first attemp for your first review: it flows well, really good pics and many pics . in the set, i think this is a good purchase i will buy it when it comes out in the us and i think it is cool looking and the fuctions look neat . edited by darkrebellion, 26 august 2008 - 11:12 pm.

0 it's a shame it only comes with two figs. it would be great for my ancient middle-east project.

0 mattzitron, you have done well to display images of the dung stain hull... its a darn shame that it can't be extended. however, i see no reason why lego couldn't produce a special middle hull piece that is compatible. although the way they've made the hull is a bit stupid. the old system was a lot more flexible. better still why can't lego design a hull that can be extended in length and width... then they could be as made as long or wide as desired and that would be great!

4 joebot, on aug 27 2008, 03:15 pm, said: very nice review of a set that i've been dying to get, but my friendly neighborhood lego store never seems to have in stock. the yellow seat is most definitely not a new piece. i had two of those in my old beta-1 command base, almost 30 years ago!! it is interesting however.

4 thanksfor this review, i also got this set recently, and i'm very happy about it. i live the design of these new trucks, and the forklift is also great. not to forget the good amount of cargo. btw., i think the "mysterious cargo" only are normal fuel barrels

4 a very fine set indeed and something at least a little different to the more usual city sets. sweet! and it could even be a little sweeter to me with car doors... well, nevermind. thanks for that very nice review, ~vbbn~!

2 great review! i dig this set. it could have only been better if it had been a 6-wide version of the old 6367 semi-truck. still i ask: what's so special about the special edition?

2 the cobra, on aug 27 2008, 09:58 pm, said: still i ask: what's so special about the special edition? hmm...good question. let's hope our reviewer can help us out here.

4 nice review, vbbn! i stumbled upon your yellow seat as well. didn´t you have one already or what made you think it´s new? the big letdown on this set is the big canopy. i would have preferred single bricks for that. and for this truck there is no real need for a hollow canopy - it could as well have been made of solid bricks. maybe we get another set with different use of the canopy. this is one of the reasons i didn´t buy it so far. and i´m especially not interested in another forklift, i have plenty of those... i agree it´s the best one we have seen so far though.

4 metalandi, on aug 27 2008, 07:50 pm, said: that explains why it isn't in our local stores. i also got it from s@h, but my box hasn't got the "special edition printing" on it, surprisingly. just like dwarve's mine is exclusive to target. holodoc, on aug 28 2008, 04:16 am, said: nice review, vbbn! i stumbled upon your yellow seat as well. didn´t you have one already or what made you think it´s new? the big letdown on this set is the big canopy. i would have preferred single bricks for that. and for this truck there is no real need for a hollow canopy - it could as well have been made of solid bricks. maybe we get another set with different use of the canopy. this is one of the reasons i didn´t buy it so far. and i´m especially not interested in another forklift, i have plenty of those... i agree it´s the best one we have seen so far though. thanks! i have a yellow seat, but i just thought it was interesting. as for the canopy, it really looks good on the finished truck; i like it. and that forklift could be the official one, and the rest could become parts...

2 nice review. the figure fitting inside is great. i think the price might be a little high but you did get it from tru so what else is to be expected.

4 great review! the y-wing is an awesome starfighter and the detail in this set is superb. funnily enough i was just swooshing mine today! edited by pedro, 27 august 2008 - 08:25 pm.

4 pedro, on aug 27 2008, 09:23 pm, said: great review! the y-wing is an awesome starfighter and the detail in this set is superb. funnily enough i was just swooshing mine today! you mean swooshing as in swooshing for real or just plain swooshing?

2 i've built the y-wing and the imperial landing craft (7659) more or less at the same time and, for about the same prices, i think the imperial landing craft (ilc) is much superior to the y-wing. the y-wing doesn’t have much functionality besides an awkward dropping bomb device and a moving cannon. the missiles firing system is … your fingers. the ilc has an awesome missiles firing system (i wish i could get it individually for mocs), a clever bomb dropping mechanism, 5 minifigures with weapons, the wings fold up together and the “cargo” can be detached as a play set. i’ve built the ilc first so i got quite disappointed with the y-wing.

2 kimt, on aug 28 2008, 09:08 pm, said: you've got to be kidding? the ilc is bulky and doesn't even come close to the design superiority of the y-wing. it's smooth, it's beautiful and it's awesomely designed by the designers at lego. "it's got greebles, man!" i was not talking about the looks, of course the rebels have got to have nicer looking ships

2 yodalikespie, on 03 september 2011 - 07:21 pm, said: is it worth the money since the new y-wing comes out next year? please, check the date prior to asking questions in old topics. three years ago in this case. it's rude to expect people to answer questions like that, especially since it's such a generic question. besides, how is he supposed to answer the question without knowing a lot more about the new y-wing...

0 fallenangel309, on 19 september 2011 - 02:01 am, said: again, we know next to nothing about the new y-wing. it wouldn't be possible to say whether 7658 is worth the money relative to the new one until we know what the new one looks like, what its minifigures look like, how much it will cost, etc. also, note that yodalikespie has been banned. is that a threat? is it fair to ban someone on the forum because they revived an old thread and made inquiries? thought this was a forum to discuss lego and that is what he was prompting. i don't really care why he was banned but this isn't the only time i've seen this type of behavior and discourse here on eb.

4 thanks for sharing this review with us. i'll add it to the index. one of my favourite impulse sets along with the troll warrior (or is that orc warrior)

4 nice review and i especially enjoyed the ending. i personally think it is quite a good set for the price considering it comes with a fully armed minifig along with enough stuff to suit up another. i just wish amazon carried this set.

0 do we really need more construction works? legoland is just one huge building site. theme: city set name: mini digger set number: 7246 number of pieces: 36 figures:1 released: 2005 list price: $3.50 (usd) 7426 peeron.com 7246 bricklink catalog diving right in let get some photos of the box the digger at work. the back just has more of the same not to inspiring. once we open the box we find two poly bags and some instructions the total contents of the box, well minus the air instruction booklet short and simple. now the single minfig of the set, nothing new of special that i can see. …got a job working construction for the johnstown company. moving onto the digger itself, it’s one of those builds where all you really need is a quick glance at the instructions and off you go. side view of the finished product. alternative view, it doesn’t look to bad. now lets add our construction worker. looks rather good, though the lifting action isn’t smooth. it’s nothing special, it’s not the greatest construction set that lego have ever produced but i think it is worth the money. the arm action really does bug me though. the rating system figures: 5/10 (just another construction peon.) parts 4/10 (nothing novel and i dislike the new digger arm system.) fun fun fun 7/10 (i think the playability is high and you can get a good load of bricks in the bucket.) design 6/10 (not the best designed digger but not the worst.) price 7/10 (a reasonable price for what you get) grand total 29/50 still halfway decent but nothing to write home about conclusion. this set is yet another in a long line of lego digger and to be honest it’s not the best in my opinion. i still hold nostalgic memories for 6504 which i still think is a great digger. from my point of view the set sits to high off the ground and make me wonder how the worker gets in. i really don’t like the digging arm action it will never be smooth and while it poses better i just think it’s inferior. despite this i still think it’s not a bad set, i’d just like it to be so much more.

4 thanks for the review, ~vbbn~. i have to say, ef has never really caught my attention, but this set seems alright. to be honest, when i saw the topic title, i was expecting a tiger- looking mech. the mech itself is cool, except for the huge leg pieces. i think the minifigs are great in ef sets, with the dark colored outfits, like dark red or dark green.

4 this was my first exo force set and i was quite skeptical towards the mecha theme, so i got it because it seemed to have nice parts. it turned out however that the mechas are quite nice :) i really like the poseability of it and since then i got another ef set.

4 the assult tiger is pretty cool

4 since my last post i've had the chance to build the tiger, and i was surprised in a good way. a much better set than i actually thougth. front

4 i just bought 2 of them since they were 5$ each from lego. i really wish they did not cancel this series.

4 best impulse set so far. thanks for sharing your thoughts and yes, someone should look into that rodent issue. i'll add this to the index within long

4 good review. i got 2 of those. wheels are very useful, especially if you don't have any :) as for shields - i don't imagine trolls use them too much. i think that they fight berserk style - all out assault. one complaint is the piece that the wheels are attached to - its a single piece, with smaller than the standard pin connection. so you cant change the width of the cart for your mocs using the wheels. i don't know if a piece with such a connection only on one side exists though ....

4 nice review, makes me want 3 honestly. and comgratz on becoming a teacher in the reviewer's academy.

2 nikola bathory, on aug 28 2008, 11:47 pm, said: wait a second, a "troll"?? isn't that an orc? i thought that this is a troll: those are giant trolls. the regular sized green guys (such as is included with this set) are trolls. yes, they look like orcs but lego calls them trolls.

4 nice review! i never new trolls had fireworks, at least that's what it looks like to me. maybe i shall build a trollish fireworks company! fireworks on!

2 that’s the problem i couldn’t quite tell what, it’s a bit of a problem in a reviewer. maybe a hose to clip to the fire hydrant i don’t know.

4 brick built robot, surely we?€™re getting near classic space now? theme: space, mission mars set name: mini-robot set number: 5616 number of pieces: 24 figures:1 released: 2008 list price: £2.50 (gbp) $3.50 (usd) 2.99 (euro) 5616 peeron.com 5616 bricklink catalog 5616 shop at home let look at the box first. space man approaching the robot from behind. i?€™m not sure you can still buy the base easily anymore. the contents of the box. the contents of the box, it?€™s rather white. fairly standard mission mars spaceman, he?€™s got printing front and back but sadly no air tank! how does he breath? *as has been pointed out he does have a printed tank but i'd rather a physical one* note the megaphone is in flashlight mode not weapon mode, that?€™s important.. the robot itself feels a bit clumsy the metal detector is never going to touch the ground and it feel a bit wide. i don?€™t like the look of him something in the eyes. the reason why so we can have a box to put crystals in. both together and ready to explore new worlds etc. sadly the robot was homicidal, remember in space no one can hear you scream. it?€™s not a bad impulse set and if it marks the return of brick built robots to space then it?€™s a good thing. i just feel the robot could have been better built. the rating system figures: 6/10 (not to bad but nothing wonderful) parts 6/10 (lots of white and not much orange, but where?€™s the air tank!) fun fun fun 6/10 (probably the best impulse set as a stand alon toy lots to do with a robot and his human boss) design 5/10 (the robot feels clumsily put together i think it needs work) price 8/10 (can?€™t fault the impulse price.) grand total 31/50 (not well designed but does have more play value than other impulse sets.) conclusion. i was surprised that mission mars got impulse sets as it didn?€™t seem to sell as well as other lines last year. however i think this is a fairly good set, it has more playability than other sets and does come with a metal detector been a while since i?€™ve seen one (though i could be wrong) sadly the robot isn?€™t as good as it could be. edited by sinner, 01 september 2008 - 01:30 am.

4 this here was a set that i new i had to get. a beautiful minfig, amazing minfigs, what more could you want? so was this set worth it? i guess you will just have to read the review to find out! set name: the batcycle: harley quinn's hammer truck number: 7886 pieces: 267 theme: batman year: 2008 price: 35.00 usd, 44.96 euro 1/box the new box art for batman is pretty stunning. it's clean, and really sells the set. for this set, harley quinn's truck is pictured attacking batman, with the set information. the back of the box shows a nice little comic, the other sets, as well as the set functions. 2/contents the instructions: the instructions for the set are, as always, clear and straightforward. they display the colors well, and have what we expect in an instruction book. 3/build minifigs: the stars of the set! batman is back with a new torso, much more metalic than before. harley had all new printed torso, legs, a new head, and that sweet new hat. batcycle: the bottom part is very sturdy thanks to a small bit of technic. the red throws it off a bit, but it isn't seen once the top part is put on. it has a nice use of the smoke stacks, and looks very nice in the end. the top part is simple, but suits the purpose well. it has handle bars, and a nice motor. the blue is a little strange though. hammer truck: the hammer truck begins with a very sturdy base. it has lots of detail, and really looks cool. rims added: lego did a very nice job at giving it a checker board appearence. the only problem here is that you stick a sticker over two bricks, multiple times. jewels: inside of the crate are these shining jewels. look how they illuminate the darkness in gotham... more added: then, we add on a spoiler and the crate. looking very nice now. the detail is again, outstanding, and it has a good amount of smoothness to it. the infamous hammer! okay, i haven't said this yet, but the square pieces need to stop. first on those sw backta tanks, now on the hammer? it creates a sloppy look for the hammer. still, this is the ultimate wacking weapon. added to the truck: on the truck it works pretty well. but the handle is to short, and it's near impossible to smash batman. the finished truck: the finished truck is really nice. the big wheels give it the monster truck feel, and the way that lego alternated the colors works well. the cockpit is a little palin, but that's not a major issue. the "i love joker" sticker is one of the best stickers i've seen. it's simply a classic. the finished set: ---------------------------- parts: 9/10 (lot's of good mocing pieces, and red and black are always usefull.) minifigs: 10/10 (awesome!) playability: 9/10 (the hammer is a little short) price-per-part: 8/10 (it's a liscensed theme, so meh.) set 7886 is a very nice set, and has some great details in it. the minifigs are very cool as well. however, their are some flaws. first, the hammer is two short, and is kind of square. the batcycle has a few awkward colors in it, which throws it off a bit. this set is definatly worth the money. batman fans will love it. and also wacking fans will like it, for that hammer... and if you would like to buy this set, here are a few useful links: s@h link peeron link please let me know your comments. and pic requests and questions are welcome!

4 cool! i also like the sticker on the back of joker's ice cream truck that says "i love gotham"!

0 nice review. i really want this set, but i think the €35 here is too much (more like €25 would suit) and haven't found it cheap enough on ebay yet incl. shipping.

4 legoman132, on aug 29 2008, 03:35 pm, said: this set is nice it looks like a dhl van funny, thats what i thought when i first saw the pics good review btw oh and i keep meaning to get this set but keep forgeting..

4 it's a good set, but i think the first sticker shouldn't say "7731"

4 nice review. i like this little set. some how it reminds me now of "postman pat" in dutch "pieter post", an english childrens tv series about a postman in a little village somewhere in yorkshire. aah, sweet memories i would rather have seen a postoffice released (with some women minifigs) instead of the green post bigplane. but maybe in a couple of years.

4 welcome to another sunny day in lego city! the sun is shining, the birds are singing, minifigs are drowning.... wait? what?! the coast guard rushes to the scene and deploys the coast guard 4wd & jet scooter to save the poor minifig from drowning. let's take a look at the coast guard's buggy! 7737 coast guard 4wd & jet scooter set info set name: 7737 coast guard 4wd & jet scooter theme: city-coast guard released: 2008 price: 9.99 usd-9.95 eur-7.99 gbp pieces: 130 minifigs: 1 price per piece: about 8 cents now, the review! the box here is the front. it shows a nice image of the buggy on the beach with the ocean in the background. the back the back shows some of the features in the set, such as the extra equipment. manual the picture on the manual is the same as on the box as usual. the parts the set has great colors. i love how the orange, blue and white look together. the part selection is quite good, but unfortunately uses the large car base. coast guard minifig this is a great fig. the torso print is very nice and matches the buggy's colors well. new tire mold here are the new tires. they look very good. in-manual shot color separation is not a problem here, and since it is a small set, the piece call out is not a necessity. extra parts it is always nice to get extra cheese slopes. the finished set! the design of the trailer and jetski is great. the jetski is very smooth looking and the color scheme is fantastic. the sticker on the roof is nice, but it's actually too big for the piece. the corners of the sticker flap where the piece curves. jetski close-up here you can see how it attaches to the trailer. i didn't add the sticker that goes on the front which is a little sign that says bb-03 or something. attaching the trailer this is where the trailer connects to the main car. it attaches simply with a ball joint. car front view the license plate is a nice sticker, and the top lights look nice. say cheese driver! the back the back is very similar to the front, it has the same sticker. the equipment rack a very welcome addition to the set. it adds quite a bit of playability. the orange fins are great. all decked out he looks pretty spiffy in his diving suit doesn't he? brickshelf folder the ratings! price: 10/10 (you can't get much more in here for $10) parts: 9/10 (nice selection and great colors. the big car base is a bit annoying) design: 9/10 (the jetski is a prime example of something with a small amount of pieces that still looks amazing) playability: 9/10 (you can drive the car, go diving, and jetski across the bay) minifig: 7/10 (the one it comes with is great, but it could have come with one more. perhaps a citizen of some sort) build: 8/10 (simple, but looks great) overall: 42/50 lego s@h brickset peeron bricklink even in the face of danger, this member of the coast guard always has a smile on his face... summary simply put, for $10 you have to buy this set. it is one of the better sets in this price range you can buy, and one of the best small city sets. the colors are great, the design is great, and the fig is great. i don't normally think small sets are worth heavy praise, but this one definitely deserves it. thanks, and happy building!

4 i am not a fan of city/town/train-stuff. but this is a very good review, that almost makes me wish i had the time (read: money) to purchase some of the coast-guard sets.

4 thanks for this review. i was thinking of getting this set and having read your review went out today and got it. what a great little set. what i particularly like: very sturdy build. feels very solid as you build the pickup (compared to the fire pickup & trailer i also have) the orange pieces (my first pieces in this colour!) the tyres which give the smoothest ride of any lego town/city vehicle i've ever built the raised suspension and side runners the coast guard dude (again a first for me) and his mega-cool flippers and aqualung the jetski controls - the handlebars actually move left to right which is a great detail little details that lego didn't have to do (the grey handle by the ball joint; moving handlebars; the new tyres) as you can probably guess, i have voted outstanding for this set! erdbeereis1, on aug 29 2008, 06:02 am, said: color separation is not a problem here, and since it is a small set, the piece call out is not a necessity. you do get a piece call out with this set (i did anyway). it's on the back of the small poster that is included in the set! thanks again cheers rog edited by rriggs, 02 september 2008 - 02:53 pm.

4 rriggs, on sep 2 2008, 08:50 am, said: you do get a piece call out with this set (i did anyway). it's on the back of the small poster that is included in the set! i meant the piece call outs during the build that show which pieces you need for that step. and cardinal brick, i'm not quite sure what you mean, but i cetainly think that this jetski is wonderful.

4 i agree that this is a very good looking set. i just finished building mine yesterday, and i love it. but here is one suggestion. trim the large sticker that goes on the roof of the vehicle by cutting along the angles at the front of the sticker. if you use it as it is, it will extend beyond the "flat" surface of the roof and will overlap the lower sections. past experience with stickers has suggested that this sticker will "lift" at the front corners. lego stickers are probably the best that there are, but sometimes modifications must be made. now i want that large coast guard helicopter, #7738!!!

4 nice set, nice review, i already have one coastguard set (that truck) but i like the idea very much. however, the rigid inflatables could be much improved (see the real ones at www.rnli.co.uk or www.knrm.nl)

2 erdbeereis1, i've had a quick look your review and i must say it's quite superb! i'm dead tired so i'm going to take a nap but i'll be back later to read it more thoroughly.

4 what a great review of an excellent set. i love the islanders and that drum (outstanding!). i think these islander sets never got the credit they dserved. i really like this set and it's a great addition to the pirate collection.

2 $17 for an old set is good. i may hunt for it on ebay. :)

4 well, for some weird reason i missed this before, so i tell you now: very good review (as we are used of you, erdbeereis1). i like all the islander sets, and own quite a few myself! for people that don't own any of the islander sets yet, the 6262 king kahuka's throne is a great way to start! lots of minifigs and accessories!

2 well, this is a not so old set and i bet most of you already have it. so here is another review from me. as usual, let us start off with the box art. box art: i like the box art. they put a nice background for the at-ap. at the side we have the minifigs scale and at the back there is the function shown and advertisement for other set. the content: the content is consist of 6 packets of bricks and a instruction book. yeap, no sticker sheet. instruction book: the instruction books not only show us the steps but also show us all a clear pictures of the january release sets and some sets show with their function. well, this includes the at-ap functions as well. besides, there are bricks checklist as well and the how do you start off before assemble your sets and a little poster where the clones with their at-ap battling the droids. here's a random page. new pieces (to me): i never see both of this piece before so i assume it is a new pieces. anyone have any idea is there any other sets that contains this piece? the blasters: we are given a 2 long blasters which is great. which i it is more accurate as most of the clone troopers use a long blaster. the minifigs: the minifigs is 2 shock trooper but is different with #7655 clone troopers battle packs's shock trooper. the leg is different in colour, we are given white hip while the one in the battle pack are given a black hip. furthermore, we get a new printed headgear, which i think they have improve it, check out the mouth printing, the colour is brighter. so here is the headgear: the headgear limit itself from turning to the side this is because the front part it is too low until it block by the torso. the shock troopers: without helmet on: we are given a black stud, no face printed. how i wish that i have extra. with helmet on: comparison with shock troopers from battle pack: the at-ap: here's the at-ap. it looks ugly at a certain angle and looks great in a certain angle. anyway i still like the set. i like the walker vehicle. below are the pictures taken randomly: top view: side view: without stabilizer leg: with stabilizer leg: rear view: the functions: well, the functions are not so impressive. just something turning around, open here and there. the only function that is say as special is the retractable stabilizer leg. the cockpit: the cockpit can fit two clone troopers but too bad we are only given two and is not enough as there is no gunner on top. inside it there is a guns holders, which can hold two guns but fall off easily when you are trying to remove the guns. well the other side have some speedometre thing and a controller. to reveal the cockpit, you have to open the top hatch. look below: so you can see what's inside: oops, the side hatch and back hatch as well: open and close: i think this pieces is use not to let you open the hatch but to make some design, i mean make it able to move inside. with clones: beneath: so this is the pieces that hold the stabilizer leg when is not in use. this is how the stabilizer leg move: at last~ and of course the revealing cockpit from below and at the back. guess the droids have alternative way to take this things down faster. the leg: there are pieces blocking the leg to go to the front i mean overhead and lose balance. the base in not movable the side armor: the side armor has door and this is how it is attach. it is very flimsy, when you want to adjust it to be a little steep to creat the shape, they might just fall off. so it is connected to the body with just a technic pin. and to hold it properly, here is the support: the side hatch: it open and close easily, very loose, nothing to hold it tight. here's some view when the side hatch is open. the cannon: the cannon on top is movable and adjustable. the big cannon can move up and down while the smaller one can cove sideways. but the smaller one tend to lose balance when it is without minifigs, means the one on top and below will not b align. this is the pieces that only enable it to move up and down. to prevent it from moving freely, lego put two pieces to block it. completion: i try to make the sets looks great. i think this angle is right. spare parts: it is so few compare with #7673 magna guard starfighter and it is more expensive. overall: this set is not really a good set. the hatch is quite flimsy, top and the side since there is nothing to hold them tight. besides, it is lack of one clone. but to complete your walker collection, you must have it. pros: -no sticker needed -new improved headgear -long balsters cons: -lack of clone -flimsy -expensive as few pieces are given] hope you guys like it. edited by kimt, 30 august 2008 - 12:01 pm.

0 i do not like the fact that the clones have pure white legs. it looks weird to me. it was also weird that they included shock troopers, but it was probably a way to get people to buy it. this set also seems like one of those that was kind of thrown in with a mix of other sets like the tie crawler. i never picked it up, and with the new clone wars sets out, i won't.

0 i agree, the pure white legs are odd, as is the inclusion of shocks instead of pilots or regulars. or maybe even kashykk troopers; that might have been better.

4 technic rotation joint disc set list. it's used in 10 different sets so far, not exactly a new piece a nice review with many good comments. i really like this set. it's one of the walkers with really good design and a lot of playability. it's the usual issue of using too many technic pieces to make a moveable feature versus minifig-scaled design. the same issue concerns for example the at-at, the twilight and the at-te (plus more sets). what annoys me in this set is the use of the 2 tan 4x8 plates. they "stick out" and it would have been better if they (the designers) had used dark grey or light grey plates. also i'll add this to the inventory - now!

2 did anyone encounter the problem with the main turret? apparently, the very tip of the piece (cone shape) can't be put onto the "pole" piece. i check the instructions 2 times and still can't find what i'm doing wrong. is it just me or did anyone else got this problem as well?

0 i could have gotten this set if i wanted to but it seemed like a waste of money to me. i don't like the shock troopers helmets that much. i feel they should have printed visors instead of cut out ones like they have in my opinion it would make it look a lot better. the at ap itself sounds like it has a lot of holes in its cockpit which drags the set down and make it seem like they haven't exactly put a lot of effort into it. great review!

4 product: 7681 separatist spider droid™ (ssd) theme: star wars: the clone wars no of pieces: 206 release date: 26 july 2008 rrp: sgd59.90/usd29.90 availability: lego shop@home, target, toys 'r' us (worldwide). quote conquer the galaxy, one planet at a time! unleash the power of the separatist spider droid™! this towering engine of mechanical destruction from the clone wars strides across hostile terrain on four independently positionable stilt legs, then uses its movable laser cannons to blast republic forces. includes commander fox™, clone trooper™, battle droid™, super battle droid™ and battle droid commander™ minifigures! rotate the laser cannon on top! laser cannon underneath bends to change direction! measures 6" (15cm) tall and 10½" (27cm) wide! also known as the homing spider droid, this is what i would usually reckon as a mini-fig set if not for the high price point. since there's a total of 5 mini-figs to be had, and at least 3 of them are going to be high sought after.(commander fox™, clone trooper™, battle droid commander™). at first glance, it looked like there's only 3 packets. actually, it's a total of 4 packets, 1 of the packet is inside the biggest packet. it's not a very complex build. took me around 25min since i was playing around with the mini-figs more than i was building up the spider droid. though finally, here's the completed build-up. usually for lego products, what excites me are the vehicles, yet this set is the other way round. yes, the mini-figs are definitely the crowd-pleaser this time. on with the review. here's the close-ups of the droids in the following order, battle droid commander™, battle droid™, & super battle droid™. there's not much to comment on the droids, except that the battle droids come with the new arm that's able to hold the blaster properly upright. the sbd is the same dude that can be found easily in the previous droid battlepack. and now the good part... clone troopers. and that's commander fox, and his trooper. i was quite mystified by the amount of accessories given to the clone troopers as per the instruction booklet, as there wasn't any indication of what they were... (commlink, grenades, sensor scope, range finder?!?) then it hit me... real hard. notice anything yet? yup, it's a night scope, and a range finder. that, plus the visor that's available to fox too. now, this is really a good time to start troop building for the clone wars. :twisted: here's the weaponary. of course, let not forget the main dude... fore: port: aft: starboard: the ssd looks very similar to the actual screenshots from aotc, though am still wondering what's that little translucent red piece for... a re-enactment. and a comparison. this set is really either a miss or a hit. for me, it's a hit, due to the mini-fig count, and the wide array of accessories. it's going to probably be a hit depending on the movie that's coming out this month, since we have commander fox here(i heard that c.fox hasbro figure is a target exclusive, meaning it's gonna be another highly sought after). this set is also stated to be a limited edition, and seeing as how it's only available so far in only 1 toys r us in sg, this just might not be available anymore after the movie starts. :d comments: this review was done immediately after the launch of the clone wars toys at the midnight launch on 26 july on a local starwars fan forum. and after having caught the movie only yesterday, i now only have this to say, "it's not part of the movie!?!". oh well, cmdr. fox probably will fair better once the tv series starts proper. then again, that less-than-one-minute cameo of him, i do find it unforgivable. this being the 2nd review available, i sincerely hope you guys enjoy it.

4 i did enjoy it thanks for sharing your thoughts in this set and reviewing it. i'll add it to the index. maybe you should consider joining the reviewers academy and rule the galaxy (or something )

2 doctor sinister, on aug 30 2008, 08:22 pm, said: i assumed it was the droid's eye. great review btw. now i know what all the little bits are! i have this set as well, i quite like the droid. dr. s. dr. s. yup, only notice it after re-watching aotc. it's the sensor for visual data. tlc gave the better effect than hasbro, since they made it glow like in the movie. kimt, not at the moment, since i have slowed down quite abit due to my day job. though, i still definitely enjoy the company here to contribute more reviews when available(meaning after i find a better way to co-exist both my hasbro and lego stuff spending). millacol88, yup, those accessories definitely makes me want to start lego clone troop building.

2 alakazam! the good wizard is the wisest minifig in all of legoland. he is a master of the wand and can see the future. with these abilities, he helps the knights predict where the trolls will strike next. because this set is not in stores in the u.s., i was luckily able to buy this set on my vacation to germany. it is interesting that it is a euro exclusive. 5614 the good wizard set info set name: 5614 the good wizard theme: castle released: 2008 price: eur 2.95-gbp 1.99 pieces: 16 minifigs: 1 the review unfortunately i don't have the box, because in got smushed in my suitcase on the plane, so needless to say, it was not in top condition... the manual the manual is an extremely small fold-out. but the image on the front is nice. on the back of the manual, there is a picture of some of the 2008 impulse sets. this is a nice feature. the parts for an impulse set this has a pretty good selection. a very nice owl, and an interesting clear ball piece. all built this set took me forever to build. i had to take numerous breaks as it was the toughest, longest build i have ever faced! for an impulse set, this actually looks pretty good. the owl perch is nice, also the crystal ball table. the wizard is a very nice fig, with great printing on the legs and hat, and i love his beard. brickshelf gallery the ratings price: 8/10 (not bad, but i feel that impulse sets are slightly overpriced) parts: 7/10 (impulse sets are focused around the minifig, but the parts in this set are pretty good) design: 7/10 (the crystal ball is a good idea, and the owl perch is simple but nice) playability: 6/10 (there is not much to play with here) build: 8/10 (as i said before, it took forever. really it took all of 1 minute) minifig: 10/10 (the wizard is fantastic) overall: 46/60 bricklink lego s@h brickset abracadabra, blades of four... you are now a dinosaur! summary for an impulse set, this is very nice. the wizard is an excellent fig, and getting an animal in a cheap set is always great. i would definitely recommend this set. thanks, and happy building!

2 good review for a simple set. while it does come with the basics for an impulse set, i just feel that it lacks something though i am not sure what. perhaps a printed magic scroll? i am still not a fan of the printed cap (especially the stars), but i do like the printed pants displaying his various goodies hanging from his belt. the plain torso is to be expected from a wizard minifig i suppose. overall, it's not a bad set but it certainly feels to be lacking something, imo.

0 the next in my attempt to review every impulse set single handed theme: space, mission mars set name: alien jet set number: 5617 number of pieces: 21 figures:1 released: 2008 list price: £1.99 (gbp) $3.50 (usd) 2.99 (euro) 5617 peeron.com 5617 bricklink catalog 5617 shop at home as always we begin outside of the box it looks rather exciting at first glance. set that cost a lot more than this one. now for what?€™s inside. the contents of the box, the impulse sets never look that inspiring. now for the alien, i have to say i?€™m not impressed. i?€™m not a big space fan and i only bought this due to my impulse review challenge, but as the main point of the impulse sets is the alien is a little hard to build a good set round something with one point or articulation. it lacks what make lego minfigs so great their articulation. now for the space vehicle, as always with impulse a short and easy build ensues. took maybe 2 mins at the most. time to mount the alien in his craft. the craft looks a little wide for him. slightly better from this angle but still not winning any awards. i?€™m disappointed of the impulse sets i?€™ve reviewed so far this is clearly the weakest of them, but what really disappointing is the other seem so good and useful. the rating system figures: 3/10 (the alien is not a good minfig) parts 6/10 (some interesting parts but nothing that special.) fun fun fun 2/10 (i can?€™t think of anything to do with this set to be honest.) design 4/10 (poorly designed the box makes it look much better.) price 6/10 (despite the impulse price tag i?€™m still unhappy about the price.) grand total 21/50 (less than half marks the lowest i?€™ve given so far.) conclusion. in many ways i?€™m annoyed, from the outside of the box this set looks quite interesting and certainly appears to be well designed. the idea of a small alien fighter/flying craft is in my opinion a good one, but sadly when you?€™ve got the finished product in your hand it looks nothing like the box art. while i think mission mars had some interesting sets and i might still get some of them this one will not be a repeat purchase for me.

0 well now we at least know that we can avoid that set ;) johan

0 thanks for this review. as for the set? well, i am not to crazy about this set, but i want some sort of small alien fleet vehicals, and this would work well. but i would rather ave my money to buy classic town. edited by ~vbbn~, 01 september 2008 - 02:48 am.

4 i rated this poor due to the fact the set is unimaginative (looks like a bunch of plates where thrown together) and it just isn't worth the money lego is asking for it, imo. i've never been a fan of the non-articulated "jellies" so i'll leave my disgust for them out of this post. however, unlike the set, the review is a fine work of art that clearly depicts the goods and provides valuable insight/opinions about the set's playability, usefulness, and overall value.

0 impluse sets are made good by using parts well and minifigs. this has either. i give a low score. i really dislike the alien figs. worst lego fig ever.

4 cardinal brick, on aug 30 2008, 06:23 pm, said: the question is what could you do with this set, i mean it’s just spacemen in a line? what could you do? the possibilities are endless!! 1. you can stand them in a line 2. stand them in a circle 3. stand them in a square 4. sit them all down 5. sit some of them down and leave some standing up (adult supervision may be necessary for tfols attempting this one) 6. take them all apart and scatter the pieces like some kind of huge space mine has gone off 7. yeah, ok. that's probably enough for now seriously, i love all the sets of minifigs from all the different themes and this is a great one. i always wanted them when i was a kid but never did. my focus always was on town sets (petrol stations and police sets please stand up) and there was never enough pocket money left over for space. sigh! you are so lucky to have this great set! thanks for sharing cheers rog

4 thanks for the review! the latter space mini-fig sets were great as they gave a nice variety of men. i'd love this one...

0 jimbutcher, on aug 30 2008, 10:25 pm, said: oh yes, i will add the other prices, and i was going to make a poll for it (i made one for the homing spider review), but you beat me to it. thanks! that's my job, i'm a moderator

0 thanks for the review. is a great one. this set is not really a good set but i like the spider droid. the hailfire droid scale is not right, i think it is suppose to be even bigger. anyway, this is the first set that re-release the commander droid. so i grab it.

2 this is a must have set for aotc fans and i really love the hailfire droid but it costs like $80 or more now that its discontinued.

4 7681: homing spider droid (limited edition) number of pieces: 206 number of minifigs: 5 price: 34.99 usd/ 29.99 eur/ 19.99 gbp theme: star wars: episode ii year released: 2008 brickset folder bricklink catalog welcome to my sixth review on these boards, of the mighty homing spider droid. at first glance, this ball on legs may not seem like much, but hopefully this review will change your mind. the box. this box is the standard for all of the new clone wars sets: sleek, shiny, and a right-out-of-the-factory look. the blue-and-white color scheme is fantastic, and portrays that the sets are based off of a cartoon well. this box has a "limited edition" (in spanish, too! ) seal slapped on the front, although you won't have trouble finding this in your local toys "r" us, because of the big clone wars display in the front of the store that you can't miss. overview in this picture, you can see the contents of the whole set (minus the instruction booklet) built. you can spot five minifigures (which i'll get to later), and a very tall cis weapon, known as the homing spider droid. this weapon of destruction is a must-have for your cis army, although the color scheme (mostly dark bley and light bley) is a change up from the regular colors (brown or blue) of the cis. this may have something to do with the blended armies of the trade federation and corporate alliance, but i don't know for sure. the instruction manual is very thin, only about twenty pages. homing spider droid this is the main part of the set. four huge legs, two mounted guns, and a red sensor eye are the highlights of this artillery unit. there's not many playability factors to this one, but sometimes its just fun to squash the little clones, a change-up of the contrary. it also looks good next to all of the other cis sets, but you might want to clear some room in your display area; the legs take up a lot of room! this thing is also massively tall, about the same height as the republic cruiser. main body this is the main body of the spider, which has no cockpit and is remote controlled. this spherical body (not in that sort of way...) is a very quick build, and features a big, red eye connected by a red stud and hinge. top gun here is the top gun (not with tom cruise), which is connected to the body using a clever technic system (pun not intended). as you can see from this picture, you can see that it can rotate a full 360 degrees, but only if you remove the eye. also, the gun can be pulled back, and if you let go, it will snap back, like the a gun does when fired, due to the force of the shot. i'm not sure this was intended by tlg, because it wasn't showed anywhere on the box or in the manual. lower gun here is the gun attached to the under body of the main part. it is attached using a hinge, which allows it to move up and down. i also like the cord (that presumably transfers power) included on both guns. hips here is one of the hips attaching the legs to the body. there is one on each side, with two legs each. the are attached to the body and legs with technic pieces. legs you can see the tall legs in this pic. they are basically just technic poles and connectors. feet this is one of the feet, the essential to balancing the whole vehicle. these and the legs are repetitive, so i suggest doing them all at the same time to avoid flipping back in the manual and repeating the process three more times. the picture speaks for itself for the design of the feet. all are connected to the legs using a double-holed technic piece. one massive son of a gun this thing is so tall! it frightens the skin off of even the toughest, most experienced soldiers. run for your lives!! look at how much havoc and fear it causes! family photo enough of the battle scenes, here is a shot of this spider with it's smaller cousin: the dwarf spider droid. minifigs finally, here are the minifigs that come with this set. there are five in all, which include: battle droid: nothing special, but still an addition to your army commander battle droid: i love that yellow torso! super battle droid: again, nothing special clone trooper: i'm glad they gave us one in this set, i can add it to to my other phase 1 clones. commander fox: i love it! everything from the dark red markings to the accessories are fantastic! the head is just the regular anime style clone wars face. this set comes with two flashlights, two antennae, one visor, one pauldron, and one kama. close-up of fox here is a close-up of fox, so you can see the detailed insignia of the republic guard. that wraps it up for the review, here is the final verdict: build: 8/10, very easy and straightforward, a little repetitive with the legs. should take the seosoned builder around 20 minutes. playability: 6/10, not many play factors, but it's fun to just squash puny clones with this giant arachnid. swooshability: n/a minifigs: 10/10, you really can't ask for more in this sort of set! design: 8/10, not very sturdy, but it is altogether clever. price: 5/10, yes, it is limited edition, but pumping up the price fifteen dollars more than it should be is a little ridiculous. overall score: 8.5/10, an excellent set for display, although not very sturdy. minifigs are superb, but the price could be better. in the end, i would highly recommend this to any prequel trilogy fan looking to build up his/ her army. well, that's about it for this review, please feel free to leave your opinions!

0 i just bought this set the other day and i must admit that it gets a "below average" from me. the price is not corresponding with what you get. which would be implied, had jim added the eur or gbp price in the info[hint hint ] the spider droid is flimsy at best. making it stand or even move without tumbling over is hard. also why the brown cylinders on the legs? keep the colourscheme clean, please. the figs are fine, except that i dislike the clone headgear and the fact that the helmets now have holes in the sides, allowing the flesh head to show within = goofy looking. i am soo replacing the clone heads with black ones. great review of an acceptable set

4 thanks for the great review jimbutcher! this looks like a pretty decent set, i might get this if i find it on discount.

4 i love the look of this set it's the closest to getting a walking eye from the venture bros. as well as the droids and troopers :)

2 mass-manufactured and designed to withstand extreme amounts of punishment... it's an iron drone, and it's marching on its sentry! set data 7711: sentry year: 2006 theme: exo-force subtheme: robots pieces: 74 (+4 extra) <- both counting hinge control stick and its base as two separate pieces price: euro 7 circa, misb, including s/h, on ebay; rrp was euro 5 circa / 5 usd. probably 5 ukp. building time: 20/25 minutes (10 minutes building, the rest of the time placing stickers!) more info: brickset - peeron being 2006 my last dark year, i wasn't a big exoforce fan but they were ok. i tought 2007 models were better, and still think 2008 models are the best. that basically means 1) it's a shame that there will be no more of this line and 2) this is my first 2006 model, yet i bought in in july 2008. ok, let's do this one. box front: box was battered due to italian post; they'll do their best to give lego boxes a "war" outlook. close-up: the japanese katakana read "tokushu butai" -> special (military) force(s) box back: amazing alternate model; some like it more than the original design. box content: a small but capable sticker sheet, two bags and instructions. sticker sheet: and they're numbered! random instructions page: connecting legs to the body instructions page - sticker detail: that's why they're numbered. instructions page - parts inventory: does anybody check if they're all there before building? surely not me. loose pieces: nothing rare, i think; small techinc parts come in different colours, as usual (you often don't see them when the model is complete, but sometimes you do) the iron drone: "strong and durable" (and much better looking than those crappy mm jelly aliens) building starts. the open cockpit - front and rear view left leg - front and rear view; right leg is built of the same pieces. left arm - with laser cannon the cannon - great use of the hollow studs with the "plant tree palm top" right arm - with twin missiles complete model - front view complete model - side view and rear view rating and review. parts and building: nothing new, but both models are o.k. instead of waiting the last page of the manual, you'd better put the stickers in place while building. looking at the box you'd tell stickers background is (trans) purple. it actually is trans clear (excpet for the yellow and black stripes - warning: hazard!). try not to put your fingerprints on the sticky side! consider using tweezers. posability: both legs and both arms feature three joints; and that's good, so that the weight doesn't have the sentry falling down. final model: smaller compared to 2007 claw crusher and 2008 batlle arachnoid, but cheaper and surely worth the money. the "minifig" is just another iron drone, not much to say. final rating: 3,5/5 edited by sinner, 01 september 2008 - 02:22 am.

2 thanks for the review. this is one of the few first wave sets that i didn't get. i'm not really sure why as it wasn't too expensive.

4 i like the theme very much, but sadly, i don't own any sets of it. it brings such a great feeling, it's fresh and has great parts and sets. and it brought the polar bear! your review is very good and informative, thanks! (i voted wrong, i meant above average, but i clicked below average )

0 a nice set review. as for the theme itself, i though it was a very interesting theme. sadly i don’t think lego put enough effort into it, i was personally upset not to se a second year even if i didn’t buy any of the sets. it reminds me of the artic theme playmobil did at one point in the distant past to be honest. i think a number of good artic scenes were missed, when it came out a really wanted to get a ski plane but it never came, i built it myself in the end but i don’t know how lego missed that one. on a slightly random note i do know that at least one lego minifig did make it all the way to the real artic with a research team, sadly i don’t have any pictures to offer you.

4 thank you very much for this review, thebrickster! i voted both times for outstanding because: i really the arctic theme. i only bought the ice sailor but otherwise no sets because of money and place reasons and because i already collect four themes (city, older castle, western and star wars old triology). but a comeback of the arctic theme - perhaps as addition to a winter sports and winter rescue theme would be very welcome! i really all sets - the little and the big ones. in my opinion they all were very well designed (not too big vehicles, not too little and not minimalitic, great minifigs and very nice and lovely details and accessory). klaus-dieter

2 imperialshadows, on sep 1 2008, 06:57 pm, said: it's amazing! it's stupendous! it's almost like whitefang is a reviewer with previous experience! it's almost like i wrote all of shadow's lines! it's almost like staudie is being as annoying as ever. oh wait, that's all true! great review of a neat little set. i used mine as the air conditioning unit on the roof of my chinese restaurant. then some dork told me it didn't look believable or something. i liked it. um... so. great review! thanks for presenting it! i give you a that amazing x factor is supposed to be the magical touch of eb news team! glad to see it falling in place! oh, i want to take a look on how you have make use of a jet turbine engine turning it into an air conditioner unit. imperialshadows, on sep 1 2008, 06:57 pm, said: and, let's just take a moment to get sentimental. a year ago, today, staudie had a lame idea: interview the members of eb. he flailed around with it for a few interviews, including the infamous one where hinck attention whored sinner into a corner and sinner were featured, reprising their roles from the whacker and the walrus. it was quite memorable, but then, a short time later, someone new joined the team, bringing it to a new level of polish and bad jokes. still, this tribute isn't dedicated to that genius of the written word, nay, it's dedicated to the whole staff, including the new guy who is still a secret so don't bother asking, i'm not telling! ha! i salute you, eb news, it's been a damn fine year! that is some fine history from the eb news. i wonder how staudie can keep up with his sanity, asking questions around. i am so happy to be part of the team. happy eb news 1 year anniversary! imperialshadows, on sep 1 2008, 06:57 pm, said: i hope i can survive another. minus away the earlier mishaps, i am sure you are able to survive another year. iamded, on sep 1 2008, 07:13 pm, said: great review, whitefang and co.! a thoroughly enjoyable one, i'm glad we have a series of reviews that you can expect to be packed with humour and craziness. looking forward to the next! be sure to watch out for the next one. well, i have not planned for the next one though. adam, on sep 2 2008, 06:08 am, said: it can never be a happy ending for stuadie! so why did you give him one? nice review give staudie a break! he deserved to have some good treatment at times! you had spelt staudie's name wrongly. geez, i am sure he will be driving the quad bike ramming towards you.

2 thanks for the review skipper. i've added it to the review index

4 for some strange reason, this is my favorite lego castle set.

4 kimt, on sep 30 2008, 12:55 am, said: you're damn right, that is strange why is this your favourite? please explain, i'd love to find that out haha! i wish i could. well, i like small sets, and this is, aside from the fright knight's flying machine, comes in the smallest lego box i have seen. i just like the look and story feel of the set. i wish lego put out more sets like this and the 3075 ninja master's boat.

2 indexed. keep up the good work

2 skipper 24, on sep 1 2008, 12:21 pm, said: this is the back of the hailfire droid. there is a plate with a hole in, i have found only one purpose for this. the hailfire droid is the commander droids war chariot! what do you use the plate for? the plate with the hole in it is for an easy grip when you push it around, i think. nice review by the way. i think the telephone piece is great, if a little bit over-sized.

4 nice review! keep up the good-reviewness work!

4 6205: v-wing fighter number of pieces: 118 number of minifigs: 1 price: 9.99 usd/ 13.99 eur/ 8.99 gbp theme: star wars/ episode iii year released: 2006 brickset folder bricklink catalog welcome to this review of the v-wing fighter. this will be my eighth review on the boards. strangely enough, there was another set called the v-wing fighter that came out in 1997 for the space theme. note that i am missing several small pieces to this set, but they are mostly insignificant to the overall look. the box this is the standard box type for all 2005-2006 star wars sets. i can't say that i like it as much as the 2007 or 2008 box types, but it'll do. it features a profile view of darth vader and silver text. overview this is the whole set. this ship is meant to protect the chancellor at all costs. they are usually found in groups of three or four. front this ship is very sleek, and you'll notice that it's colors are dark red, light bley, and dark bley with a touch of black. it starts at the nose very narrow, but as the body progresses to the back, it gets wider, like a "v" (hence the name). back here is a view of the rear. note the trans-neon green discs used to represent the boosters. also notice the dark red r4 astro droid and the hinges used as aromor. flight all four wings (two on each side) can open up for flight/ attack mode. they can open even farther then the pic shows, but it's not an intended function. the wings a great, but it's a real pain to position them correctly, and the bottom wings close when you set the ship down. tail fins this is what the tail fins look like on each side, with two flaps attached to the top and bottom. if you look closely, the tail fins and wings look a little bit like a mini ship themselves, maybe controlled by remote. no, this is not an intended function, either. guns, side the guns are very simple but very clever, using a double technic hole piece, two black bars, and two technic pins. also note the landing gear. minifig finally, here is the minifig: a clone pilot. it has light blue arms and legs, white hands, a helmet with black markings and republic insignia on it, and a double-sided torso. the front of the torso is great, featuring shoulder straps, armor plating, and a life support system. while this minifig is not altogether accurate to the movie, it has still been one of my favorite star wars figs. back the back of the fig that can double as the front of clone marines. this side features shoulder straps and armor plating. cockpit lastly, here is the pilot seated in the cockpit. he fits perfectly, although it is not air-tight. we wouldn't want the poor guy to suffocate, now would we? that wraps up the review, here is the final verdict: build: 8/10, a nice, easy, build, and the last of the small sw ships ($10 or less). playability: 6/10, pretty fun to swoosh around, but that's about it. could use a vulture droid, but that would take away the 'small' factor. swooshability: 10/10, very fun and easy to swoosh around endlessly, without fear of it breaking. minifigs: 9/10, there really is no need to have more, although a palpy fig would be outstanding. the pilot is a great figure though. design: 9/10, extremely accurate to the movie, but the cockpit is not airtight. price: 10/10, you couldn't ask for a better deal! overall score: 8.6, an excellent set. unfortunately, this is the last of the small sw ships currently. the fig is great, and the sleek design is accurate. that just about sums it all up, feel free to leave your comments! edited by jimbutcher, 15 september 2008 - 03:11 am.

2 swman, on sep 1 2008, 05:08 pm, said: this was a great set for the price. ten dollars for a cool minifigure and a decent sized ship is great. indeed, it is. kimt, on sep 3 2008, 01:11 pm, said: yeah this was an ok set. i remember getting a few of these at tru. the boxes were smashed up and i got some 30 percent off. (still not as cheap as regular us price ) some ok bricks and a great minifig. thanks for sharing your thoughts and opinions on this set i'll rate this set as average. oh, yeah i've added the review to the index. thanks for the index, kimt. by the way, a certain someone recommended that i should change the fig pics, so i did that. edited by jimbutcher, 05 september 2008 - 01:35 am.

0 thanks for the review. this set never got me, so i didn't get it! i also don't like the droid-head-only thing and i haven't bought any set like that. i planned to buy this on sale... but it never happend.

4 very good review! i enjoyed reading this. i want to buy these battlepacks. until now, my country has not re-stocked these battlepacks. i wonder will they ever arrived again. i want to build massive armies with this outstanding battlepack set. hope it will arrived soon.

2 imperialshadows, on sep 2 2008, 08:46 am, said: ... with that lovely new barding. nobody would complain about the price then, even if it was $15. i sure wouldn't... especially if it was the silver chainmail barding.

2 the cobra, on sep 2 2008, 11:33 am, said: - why are the figures already built? are today's kids so dumb? let's go back to those old minifig packs! probably to reduce the size/complexity of the package, thus, saving tlc money. i don't see it being a big deal as customization is always an option. concerning the set: not much to say other than it does what it's suppose to do: build up one's army of knights. the variance of faces and accessories are great. i especially love the chrome sword. the price isn't bad either since the package comes with five nice figs and some great equipment. edited by dj2005, 03 september 2008 - 06:46 am.

2 after reading your review i might buy me one of these. at first i thought it was quite useless, but i must admit that your review kinda changes my mind on this bp. i've added it to the index

0 yeah i have to admit, you expect it to be wayyy cheaper since: a. no packaging to pay for(baggies and such) b. no liscensing fees(like sw) so why isn't this set a better deal than sw battlepack? don't look at me, look at tlc(he he it rhymed)

4 i bought this set for 2,14€ yesterday and i have to admit that for that price i'm veerryy satisfied ! i bought it especially for the dog (my first one) and for the road sign. during the construction (short!) of the set, i was wondering something... does the speed limit has a signification in every country or some variant exists? in my country (france), the speed limit in town is 50 km/h so i understand the road sign in this set. but in other country, and especially the country were the speed limit is not in km/h, does this set had another road sign?

2 not a bad set altough the radar is a little weird looking.

2 tanks for the review erdbeereis1 but i don't really need to buy this set since they're are always loads of police sets and it's not as if i need anymore cops, although stud makes it tempting...

2 set name: the knight set number: 5615 theme: castle pieces: 21 minifigs: 1 released: 2008 price: 1.99 eur, 3.49 usd, 3.49 cdn legoshop.com description: a knightly hero!villains beware, because here comes the knight! with his shining armor and weapons, he's ready to defend the castle against any foe. includes knight minifigure with armor, shield and weapons! peeron inventory bricklink inventory brickshelf gallery now to the review! the box the box is fairly standard and illustrates the set well. the back the back of the box is just an advertisement. the instructions the instructions are simplistic, basic, and short. the back of the instructions the back of the instructions show the other impulse sets, as well as a few others. the weapon rack this nifty little weapon rack holds the sword, the shield, as well as a different style helmet and armour plate. the minifigure the minifigure is of the standard castle variety, with the basic torso and helmet, and a slight scowl on his face. accessories/weapons the set comes with a shield, a spear, and a sword.i particularly like the pattern on the shield different configurations with the extra pieces of equipment i mentioned earlier, itis possible to turn your figure into something totally different... the entire set this picture shows the weapon rack and the knight, ready to ward off skeleton invaders! overall build: 9/10 the build is simplistic and suitable for all ages. design: 7/10 there really isnt much to judge in this category... playability: 8/10 with another minifig, plenty of exciting battles can be made! minifigs: 9/10 with plenty of customisation options, you can turn this one minifig into almost anything. price: 10/10 this set is well worth the price tag. overall:43/50 conclusion i really enjoy these impulse sets. for a casual lego-builder who doesn`t want to invest top dollar in lego, they are perfect, and for the hardcore fan, you could easily buy 5 or 6 of these to boost your army. this is the best impulse set of the first wave and i highly reccomend that you pick this set up soon, before they are all gone edited by kimt, 08 september 2008 - 08:03 pm.

4 thanks for this fine and elaborate review on the 2nd best impulse set there is. (yes the troll warrior wins by a zillion miles) i've added it to the index

2 i agree that this set is worth the price considering the amount of minifigs and even a skeletal horse. it also comes with a lot of blue 1x1 slopes that are always useful and quite rare to obtain. another weapon for the soldier operating the catapult (or a shield for the other soldier) would have been great, but that is pushing it. the crossbow itself is quite nice and is better than what most $6 sets come with, imo. overall, a good set indeed. thank you for the review and the other review concerning the knight, of which i hope to buy in the near future as it looks like it comes with a great deal of goodies. the weapon rack is useful, too.

2 nice review . i still thing sets like this are the reason castle has done so well, it allows you to collect a large number of minfig for not very much cash, which i certainly indulged in. my only complaint is that you end up with the evil skeletons out numbered, however heard of the good guys winning with the numbers in their favour.

4 nice review, it seems that you really covered all aspects of this fantastic set. my favorite part about it is probably the fact that you can give almost every included minifig a mount, except for one poor knight . however, another part i like is that the horse includes a plain saddle, which is a nice relief after the overabundance of the gold-plate barding, which is nice, but overused in the early sets. also, the sw jokes are hilarious! i particularly the running gag with the walker, but i like this one too. reason for edit: i made a mistake due to a loss of internet and an accidental post. edited by francis marion, 03 september 2008 - 03:32 am.

2 i really like this set, and it's probably my next purchase from a store (if i can still find it). there's alot of great pieces (i especially like the spiked thingy on the front), and it makes a great addition for any skeletal army. above all, i just love the spine-chilling feeling of it. if i were a minifig in a legoland, i'd be scared out of my pants-piece if i saw a carriage like that rolling towards me in a dark night.

4 yaaaay! this set is outstanding! it was first set i have bought for pieces! seriously! if you like skellies its mustbuy for you!

4 great review! this is my 2nd favorite lego castle set (tied with skeleton tower) that i own. my first favorite is drawbridge deffense.

4 great review, erdbeereis1 this really is a fantasic set. let's hope lego makes more sets like these (with 5 minifigs+4 horses at a price of $19.99? ) actually, it's about rm200 here. and it's not even price-to-piece count. anyways, amazing review, ad if i could get more castle sets this year, i might even join the reviewer's academy

4 great review erdbeereis this is a cool set! pics are great! love that shot of the lightsabers! well done! commanderfox

2 7990 cement mixer theme: town released: 2007 price: 15 usd pieces: 209 (1 minifigure) introduction: need a skyscraper built? a mother-in-law buried? a treasure kept? no problem, here i come ! only one booklet for instructions without any alternative model: it's divided into two sections for two seperate baggies which the parts come in. parts come in two big bags: a few big pieces and the stickers are loose in the box. extra parts and sticker sheet: dark bluish gray 1x1 round plates are meant to be used as cement. sticker sheet is neat. a standard worker with helmet: he comes with a shovel. colour scheme makes it easy to understand the instructions: it's easy for younger lego enthusiasts to build the model. building in progress: chassis of the truck is really sturdy. drivers seat is on the left: i wish we had a real seat instead of a modified tile. working drum mechanism: you can turn the cement drum from a handle on the front right. nice details on the front: rearview mirrors are great. i love the snot front panel too. control panel on the left: cement hose hardly fits its place and the hose is too thick. don't forget the shovel: snot technique is used on the back panel as well. long & wide truck with 8 wheels: i love the 6-stud-wide design of new town series. cement drum actually works: if you place a couple of 1x1 plates in the drum and turn the handle it pours out the little cement parts! man at work: all this hard work gave me wrinkles on my face :( folder when public: brickshelf rating: -figures: 6/10 nothing special with the figure but what did i expect? at least we have a face expression. -parts: 6/10 standart parts for a truck but the big blue drum is new. -price: 8/10 very nice and detailed truck for 15 usd. -design: 9/10 it really does look great, doesn't it? -building: 8/10 easy to build and it's fun with a little use of snot. -total: 37/50 it's a must for every town. but other players should find it attractive as well. conclusion: i occasionally order town sets but i felt a great urge to build this when i first saw it on brickshelf. when it was released i ordered it right away. ten days later i was amazed looking at this beauty by my table. we didn't have a cement mixer for ages and i'm sure every town builder will have this set. and i have no doubt non-town enthusiasts, like me, will consider getting this. links: brickset reviews bricklink entry peeron inventory

4 thanks for the great review! this is one of my favorite city kits from 2007. i think it's a lot better than the cement mixer from the classic town theme - and it has some cool pieces too.

4 i voted outstanding, because i think this is the best cement mixer tlg ever made, also love the 6-stud wide based vehicles, as you mentioned. i both bought and sold it again this year, and i already regret it, but i had to sell some stuff because of a loss of space

4 a great review of a very good set, i must echo kimt though (i seem to be doing it an awful lot) it would be improved by the addition of one more fig to the set, as it’s the same price band as last years catapult.

4 this is an outstanding review which deserved to be featured here! after seeing this set, it prompts me to own this set, and match with my 10159 legend city airport. it's very nice to see such outstanding set being reviewed and presented to our very screens. everything about this set is simply outstanding. i can't imagine that such incredible set actually released before. why don't they ever continue with this anymore? sigh, it's nice to see so much detailed from its shuttle, snack bar, stairs, waiting platform, validating machine and etc. this is an instant "5" set! if given a chance to own a misb set, i will defintely seriously consider about it.

4 best. set. ever. i got my copy years ago from a guy on the old rec.toys.lego newsgroup (anybody here still remember that newsgroup??). i traded him a guarded inn, a black falcon's fortress, and a couple other small castle sets for it. no regrets on that trade. it is hard to incorporate a monorail into a town, especially if you have a bunch of trains too! i ended up making my entire monorail system elevated. there's just no easy way to make a monorail / road crossing. i also gave up on having it run in a loop. instead, it runs back and forth between two endpoints.

4 great review of a greater set.

2 thanks for all the nice comments! holodoc, on sep 5 2008, 11:05 am, said: i had to laugh when reading your comment on the minifig seats. don?t you own many of those? i don?t know where to put mine... well, of course i do have quite some seats (a drawer full actually), but this was my first set that had them in black... when i was young however (long time ago, you know ) i always had a short supply of seats, so that's why i noticed and mentioned it.... whitefang, on sep 5 2008, 02:18 pm, said: this is an outstanding review which deserved to be featured here! thank you for drawing attention to this review through classictown.net, i have not been a frequent user of the boards lately and the release has mostly passed me by but i must say that it looks like a great site! whitefang, on sep 6 2008, 06:45 am, said: are the both of you doing grading out of the academy, when he is not a student there? indeed i am no student of the academy, i have another academy (university) to attend to, leaving little time to venture around eurobricks latlely, a shame, i know... i hope my review is in accepted here despite my lack of grades concerning the art form

2 thanks for the in depth review of a set miles out of my price range! it was great to see more of this legend than the miniature square in my magazine... god bless, nathan

2 norro, on sep 6 2008, 09:34 am, said: thanks for the in depth review of a set miles out of my price range! i thought it was out of my price range too. then i realized that i had probably spent enough since coming out of my dark ages to buy a misb 6399. so i bought it, and i am going to cut back on buying other sets for the next year or so to offset the one big purchase. those glimpses of the 2009 sets haven't made me regret the cutback. edited by section8, 06 september 2008 - 09:07 pm.

2 it would be cool to see a review comparing this set with the newer orange garbage truck.

4 thanks so much for the great review, i love that truck! i hadn't realized there was a real 4-wide recycle truck out there. i must get it one day to replace this abomination currently doing garbage duty in my town: i think that truck has seven pieces total in it. i do like the blue color though ...

4 tenorikuma, on sep 7 2008, 08:30 am, said: it would be cool to see a review comparing this set with the newer orange garbage truck. true, woold be good for the people that have few new city sets like me, and your review is good btw! i own this set however, because it was really cool those days, nowadays all trucks nd cars can do neat things, but that wasnt so back then.

4 great to find this review of a classic set and it's far better than any yuk set from 1997 omg what were they thinking ! i prefer the six wide for trucks, but for the 80's it was perfect and even today still holds it's own !

4 a nice set, my brother used to have this. i wish the pilot's helmet had a little printing on it, looks messed up to me.

4 the interceptor is my favorite tie ship so i wish i picked it up. thanks for the review, i agree about the helmet, needs some silver printing on the mouth piece and the ends

4 thanks for sharing your thoughts and opinion about this set with us. i've added it to the index. this is one of my favourite ties and i think tlg did a good job at designing it.

2 i owned it and loved it when i was young ^^ i really miss it.

2 a very robust set. the fact that it seats two figs plus has l&s makes it a unique set. i definitely liked the big airport subtheme tlg created in the early 1990s.

4 whitefang, on sep 7 2008, 05:09 pm, said: jopiek, i enjoyed this review very much! your first picture, certainly capture the essence of this lovely set. in reality, i am in the aviation line, especially aviation safety. therefore, you re-entact the scene very well. to be honest, i have never seen this set before. this aes (airport emergency service) fire truck is certainly unbelievable. i love it very much. it's a pity i never owned this. this is a set which give me a "5". thanks of course for the flattery but, do you then from your profession understand what the purpose is of the front 'spouts' that even can be hide, since that puzzles me. it can be that the lego designers thought it was a nice touch and didn't bothered about the realistic value of such a feature but i don't suppose that that is the case here.

2 i have this set the doors really dont much

4 mhh maybe put the pizza horizontally ^^ and gimme some! it was a nice set, it's a nice little crane !

2 i have this one. the newer 6571 station is better in some ways, but i always liked the big airport-style fire engine in this and the windows covering the garages. one mod project i have in mind is to expand the base, adding a second room in the area beneath the control center. interestingly, this set had two different box pictures. there was the original 1989 yellow legoland box and a 1991 blue system box, and the blue box has the vehicles in different places. quote price: usd $85.00 / gbp unknown / eur unknown if this is referring to the original price, it wasn't that much. $50 is more like it.

2 i think the 6382 fire station is the better one from the 80ies.

4 big supie, on sep 7 2008, 08:46 pm, said: i think the 6382 fire station is the better one from the 80ies. i have 6382 and agree that it is a great set. it doesn't have a chopper like this set and the fire engine is not as flash. it does have a downstairs in the building though (at least a door and a front wall anyway!). it's nice to see a review of this set as it's one that i often looked at in the catalogue and thought of getting but never did. it's great to see the details that i otherwise would not have seen. i don't like the firemen with hair though! they should have helmets or caps imho! thanks for the review! cheers rog

4 a nice old classic, the driver has a nice hat and torso, and the train is well designed, except for that thing on the roof.

2 giorgio, on sep 8 2008, 11:23 am, said: the 7745 was realsed in 1985 ;) lego had 2 12v passengers trains between 1981 and 1984 (the 7740 & 7725) during the 80s the avergae life of a train was about 5 years. @freddie: yups now i see what you mean! i checked the instructions and indeed the chairs are in the wrong place... whoops, you are totally right, i meant 7740 instead of 7745 (fixed it)! edited by jopiek, 08 september 2008 - 05:00 pm.

4 a great review for a great set. thanks for sharing it with us. a like the older lego trains. btw i think you need to fix this: quote name: jetport fire squad (light and sound series)

4 a set from the "golden age of lego". it brings back a lot childhood memories seeing this review. i was 5 and just starting to play with lego around that time. i could look for hours the lego catalogs dreaming of sets like this one. thanks for this wonderful review!

2 are you going to review the other 12v sets if you have the time?

2 zeldatheswordsman, on 30 december 2013 - 01:32 am, said: the images aren't working. it's from 5 years ago, bro.

2 beach cruisers set #: 6445 theme: island xtreme stunts year released: 2002 piece count: 97 minifigs: 2 list price: $7 (usd) during a trip to legoland california in 2002, their big store had a neat little display of some new sets and themes including island xtreme stunts. the new theme offered great colors including orange, tan, and light blue; which immediately caught my eye. the theme focussed on island fun with some adventure, and included some great figs like the brickster. i had to buy at least one set choosing truck & stunts trike (review coming soon) at the time. the theme was short lived and many of the sets were on sale at discount toy stores not too long after their initial release. i picked up this set, 6445 beach cruisers for $3.33 (usd), which will be my first of three island xtreme stunt reviews. starting with the box, a race between the street surfer and skate boarder: the back shows some alternate models including a sail boat and jet ski: same image on the instructions as the box: but the backside shows the island xtreme stunts video game for different platforms: the set includes a small decal sheet for the skateboard: i love the two figs included within this set. one is a "hippie-type" with shades and leafed muscle short, and the other "pizza boy" skateboarder. check out the "pizza boy" on his skateboard: two green brackets are included for attaching each fig to the long grey bar. using this piece, one can make the skateboarder do tricks and flips. the "street surfer" vehicle is pretty nice to: the sail is placed on a black bar and lance, then attached to the vehicle: here's a picture of the vehicle. to me, it has that old "soap box derby" look to it - like something kids would create to race down a hill: the vehicle doesn't have a steering wheel, but rather two levers which i think work well in the cockpit: here's the underside: the set has three neon orange wheels that attach to technic axle pins to attach to the vehicle: lastly, the entire set with a few extra pieces: final thoughts while island xtreme stunts is not the best city/town sub-theme, esp. for the traditional lego classic town fan, it does have some fun sets like this little beach cruiser. good figs, a skateboard, and a very "rollable" (fun word equivalent to "swooshable" but for vehicles with wheels), vehicle. you can even blow on the sail to get it to roll across the floor. this set is a lot of fun!

2 lego12, on sep 7 2008, 08:05 pm, said: i have one question only: how can you be reviewing at this time at night!?! thanks for your comments lego12. i did this review a few weeks ago and just now posted it. remember also that we are on different time zones.

4 like whitefang i too only remember this line in computer game form. i used to love that game! i actually have never seen a review for an xtreme stunts set, so this was nice to see. as for the set, i think it looks pretty good. i really like the hippie guy. the windboard thing is nice as well, but looks a bit strange somehow. i give this set a solid 3 out of 5. thanks for the nice review! edited by erdbeereis1, 08 september 2008 - 04:05 am.

2 nice review. i got this set not long after my ending of the dark ages. it was even then already on slae for just 5 euro. i like the figs and the vehicles. it were some of my first orange pieces. the hippie guy is called " snap lockit" and the pizza guy is called " pepper roni". i think the legodesigners had a cosy evening with much beer when they thought about the names. i think this line was the only line which was made first as computergame and after that as a real line instead of the other computergames based on already existing lines.

2 air chase woosh! the brickster's seaplane flies over the beach quickly. hippie dude is in close pursuit on his hang glider. fuel is running out for the brickster's plane. can hippie dude catch him before he either gets away or crash lands in the water... you decide, with island xtreme stunts air chase. set #: 6735 theme: island xtreme stunts year released: 2002 piece count: 83 minifigs: 2 list price: $10 (usd) a nice addition to the island xtreme stunts theme, air chase includes two air vehicles; a seaplane and hang glider. the set has nice island colors inclusing white, light blue, and orange. also includes in the set are some great chrome pieces for the brickster's airplane wings. starting with the box. you can see hippie dude in close pursuit: the back of the box depicts some nice alternate jet skis: same front box picture on the instructions: and on the backside, pictures of the video game: air chase includes two nicely detailed figs, hippie dude (for lack of his official name), and the brickster: here's a picture of the orange hang-glider: and the underside: unfortunately, the hang-glider is too heavy to be held up by a minigig. while i like the brick-built glider for the extra pieces, the plastic wing pieces from the ninja theme would have worked effectively and be a lot lighter. i think the seaplane is the best part of the set: here's a shot of the front end. i like the skeletal shark/fish design. what's great is none of the pieces use stickers. they are all printed: including the tail end: although the cockpit has no steering wheel or lever piece, it does have a very nice printed 1x2 tile: the wings of the airplane have hinges to allow them to fold inward slightly: also notice the nice chrome/silver pieces. here's a shot of the underside of the seaplane: and lastly, the complete set: final thoughts: air chase is another one of those "fun" island sets. two figs with two vehicles make a perfect combination for creating some dog-fights in the air. at the same time, the brickster's plane can land in the water to explore other adventure play opportunities. this set is also a nice addition to the island xtreme stunts truck & stunt trikes (6739). the seaplane can be hauled by the large semi-truck included within 6739. hope you enjoy this review.

2 hippie dude? thats snap lockitt, island xtreme is one of the best themes ever, im trying to get the sets off bricklink, thanks fo the review i need this now.

4 this is a really nice small set i think. it fascinates me that those are actual printed parts. that's something we don't see too often anymore. the figures are very good, although i must say i like the name hippie dude better than snap lockitt. does anyone know why the brickster has one blue hand? thanks for the great review! edited by erdbeereis1, 09 september 2008 - 06:45 pm.

0 it is not very often that i rate a legoset 'poor' (it's the first time actually), but in this case i had no other option. the idea of this set is good, and i like the mostly yellow minifig, but the design of both the airplane (weird 'window'-piece, a propellor that is way too small, minimal skies underneath and a strange colourscheme) and the hangglider (two handlebars on the wings, too many colours) makes the set mark the essence of lego's downfall during those years. i really appreciate the fact that you made a review of this set, brickster, it made me look into the details of 6735, but i am just as sure today as i was back then: i will never buy this. anyway, thanks for the review, the quality of the set may be a disapointment your review certainly is not

2 i knew this set looked familiar... thank you, brickster for bringing one of my first lego sets ever back to my memory. unfortunately, i don't have many of the pieces left... but thank you!

4 hello all eurobricks members and town lovers, today, i will be doing up a review on glade runner set. this is a very small set which is slightly bigger than the current impulse set. it's part of the race theme which involved in land and sea racers back in the early 1990s. i just love these orignal race themes which is produced back then. name: glade runner theme: lego system / town / race year: 1993 pieces: 29 minifigs: 1 price: usd$3.25 an image of a 6513, glade runner swamp race shall begins this glade runner is pretty nice looking with its sleek sports look. well, for a glade runner in the water, it certainly looks much impressive. somehow, i felt that the 6513 is aligned with the 6514 trail ranger. i always had that perception that both vehicles are brothers and was released under the same year. in fact, glade runner was released in 1993 based on peeron information. i always felt that this set is used for investigators or police to used for tracking or search purposes in the swamp areas instead of using it for a race. i will place this set in the jungle, somewhere like brickster's jungle settings. although it looks too bright for such serious agenda, but i think it's pretty useful to use it this way. they can rent it from the nearby shop and used it to search. it kind of reminded me of the movie, us marshals which acted by tommy lee jones and wesley snipes. meet the ace please pardon his trousers. i did not bleach it earlier. (it was caused overtime without adequate caring to the minfig. look at this great article on how to protect your lego!) the driver wears a green vest with patch pockets on both sides. this is my favourite design during that period. it comes with a yellow lifevest too. as for the 1x4 printed tile with 3 stars shining in front of the runner, it's a very nice printed tile that can be used for other racing purposes in other sets as well. overall design the built is very simple and yet so realistic. making use of the aeroplane tailhead to add as the holder for the rotor is smart. the white bricks acting as a platform for both sides to hold the driver to sit onto the centre with the steering wheel at the front. i am very happy with this design. place the glade runner in front of the fan with a reasonable fan speed. you will see the rotor runs like a charm. different angles of the vehicle close encounter with the "swamp sharks" coined by brickster! see you later to conclude, this is a very nice little set that can provide much fun. i don't really used it to race in the waters. instead, i leave it to my imagination and used it for police investigation purposes such as air crash excerise, search and rescue operations and etc. i think it can provides quite a fun loving experience. although, the set might not be very appealing to some people, but i find it very fun to play around and is one of my favourite sets in the 1990s where i placed it with my 6514 trail ranger together. summary review playability: 8.5/10 (i leave it to your imagnination.) design: 9/10 (very simple yet realistic design.) price: 10/10 (a very inexpensive set. great way to buy such small sets at a low price.) overall: 8.5/10 (glade runner is not common in town and city theme. it's not a must to have it, but if you ever come across it. do get it) i gave it a "4" based on my review score card. what about yours? hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my brickshelf (when moderated)

4 thanks for the nice review whitefang! i quite like this set. the front looks a bit bare, but for a small set like this, it doesn't really matter. this set gets a 4 from me as well.

4 i love the classic sets of that era and a great review helps show off the simplicity of some older sets.

4 what would we do without the trucks of legoland to clean up our town? well, i didn't want to find out, so i bought this set straight away! 7991 recycle truck set info set name: 7991 recycle truck released: 2007 theme: city price: usd 14.99-gbp 12.99-eur 14.95 pieces: 206 minifigs: 1 review time! leading off, the box the front shows the recycle man loading up... the trash can? one thing here is really bizarre. on lego s@h and everywhere else, it says that this set is called recycle truck. which makes sense as it has a recycle logo on the truck. however, on my box, it says the set is called garbage truck has this happened to anyone else? or is it just me... here is the back of the box which shows some of the things you can do with this set. the bags with this set you get 3 bags which are numbered. and do you see what i see? yes, that's right, the dss is in a bag so it doesn't get bent! why tlg doesn't do this more often is beyond me... bag #1 the set comes with a very nice selection of pieces. a large number of these are orange. manual silly me, i forgot to take a picture of the front of the manual. the picture is the same as on the front of the box. the back shows some of the 2007 city sets in a nice little scene. and inside. minifig here is the friendly garbage/recycle man. he looks nice but with the same head as so many other city figs before him. come on tlg! give us some new heads! the sticker sheet the stickers actually are pretty decent as far as stickers go. i like the recycle sign. after bag #1 this is where we stand after the first bag is built. bag # 2 the parts contained in the second bag. more nice orange pieces here. extra parts some nice 1x1 slopes and 1x1 round plates. everything built now that everything is built, let's check it out! the design of the set is very nice and the color scheme looks great. when you see it, you immediately know what it is. the back has a droid arm that acts as a handle to dump the trash/recycling in the truck. it's simple, but works well. here you can see the dumping mechanism. it works by a sliding technic beam with a stopper on top of the truck you can store the worker's cart. this works really well. i think though that the top of the truck overall looks a bit jumbled up with a few too many different colors. the bottom. trash dumping time! this is a good feature of the set. a very well built snot front section. this looks fantastic with the grills and number plate sticker. someone has left a big mess on the street... brickshelf folder ratings! price: 10/10 (for $15 this is a very good deal at 206 pieces) parts: 9/10 (lots of orange) design 9/10 (a very well designed set. especially the front) playability 9/10 (the trash dumper is fun and the added broom and cart make for good play value) build: 8/10 (simple, but stayed interesting) overall:45/50 brickset lego s@h bricklink peeron taking out the trash... summary this is a great small set for the price with fun features, nice colors and good design. i would certainly recommend this set, no matter what it's really called thanks, and happy building!

4 this is one of those sets that make me really want to start building up a city. it's a great value, has a lot of useful pieces, and is just plain fun to play with. i do miss vehicles having doors though. great review. i was a bit curious as to how the dumping mechanism worked. as well as the sticker count.

4 i own this set and i think it's a really nice truck, but there is two little details that i didn't like : 1/ a recycle truck really needs 2 minifig, one to drive, one to put the garbage on the back. 2/ the big hole behind the driver seat, it was easy to fill it like this : with hole pouf ! no more little hole! but this is really a great set anyway. 4/5 for me ( above average )

4 trop beau

4 erdbeereis1, on sep 10 2008, 05:38 pm, said: actually, it does. the back part of the truck with the panel hinges up, so that when you want the truck to dump, it doesn't get in the way. i should have taken a better look at the one my brother has ;) it still is a nice truck, much better than all the strange sets that were release those 'dark ages' before.

4 a good set, with a nice color scheme. i still prefer the last one that had a removable bin.

4 this looks like a great set, and i'm happy you were dumping spongebob, he deserves that. this set looks very nice, and if i see it i will probably pick it up.

4 thanks for the review! this is one of the few city sets that i own (despite loving the theme so much, most of my town is either custom or classic), and it's about as beautiful as a big garbage truck can ever be. quote nice truck indeed, but the yellow one is better i think, at least if you put them on a roadplate it seems to me that those road plates are too small for that. also it will not empty completely because of that panel. well, for the rest it is a nice set and a fine review! well, the truck barely fits onto the old roadplates (not on curves though), so if you put it in a display it probably won't look bad. i think from what i see, this and all the other 6 wide vehicles will fit much better on the newer roadplates, which are four studs wider than the old ones.
