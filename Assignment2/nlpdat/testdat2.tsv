306 lunar landing plates year released: 1979 piece count: 2 minifigs: 0 list price: unknown as part of the classic space collection, lego offered two sets of moon plates. one was a set of two crater plates, and the other, this very useful landing plate set. not much to review, but worth sharing a few images: the landing plate: and t-plate: the two plates connect to form this very nice classic space landing platform: set 497, galaxy explorer included the landing platform, but the one that i had was lighter in color than the one contained in this set (at least the yellow circle). future lego space sets could benefit by having similar road plates. share your thoughts.

first, what i liked sooooo much was the cover of these plates, with this large picture of a classic space scene. i still have a '306' misb just to keep that nice feeling of taking it out of a plastic box, and look at it... there were different versions of the cover though. second, the markings of the landing platform changed at some point. i'd have to check it later when i'm at home, think it had something to do with the interupted yellow lines...
whitefang, on jul 7 2008, 11:42 pm, said: actually, with only 2 plates, i could not do much serious expansion with it. instead, i merged it with my old city baseplates, and used it as a docking station for scientific purposes or restricted facilities that is guarded by the police. you make a very good point there. i've used these plates to represent restricted areas, and even as simple airport runways, beyond their space uses. i never liked the black plates (they were during my dark ages anyway, so i've never really seen one up close), but i have seen them used in a death star display as suggested and it turned out fairly well.
these plates are great in setting up your space base and giving your ships a place to land. my favorite, though, is the lunar crater plate, which i use to death in my comic. :)
lokix, on jul 8 2008, 03:09 pm, said: why pay $350 dollars, just download the instructions on buy the pieces off bricklink. that's the problem; the instructions aren't anywhere to be found, not that i've seen. the set does seem to have some rare parts, but i doubt $350 worth.
quote oh how i love these plates. afew years ago i found a local retail store with about 6-7 sets of these in their basement warehouse i was given special access to (along with many other old space goodies.. hehe..) i love the things, i have loads, and i've used them for multiple space bases and battles. along with afew grey crater plates and the large grey plates (1.5x the size of a normal baseplate) you can get quite a monorail layout going. *sigh* i should really clean up and get one set up again, so i can take some pictures! wow, nice. you probably have enough to make that scene on the box picture. i got one pack off ebay a while ago and have another octagon plate from the blacktron 6988 base. i'm building my carrier moc around one but don't have anything planned for the others. these baseplates are still relatively common on ebay for their age. i see misb packs on there every few weeks and they tend to sell for around $20. the older kind (in the op) are much harder to come by. edited by cp5670, 09 july 2008 - 10:18 pm.
great review sinner. i own the later version, 709 released in 1977. mine no longer has decals though. the variations were minimal. it looks like your boat is in really good shape considering it's >30 years old. excellent review!
nice review sinner! the old sets... i donÂ´t know - every old set, especially equipped with the old non-moveable arms minifigs look very odd nowadays. i agree with you with the hull shape and its possibility to be extended, but every other aspect, the lack of detail, the keel itself (you canÂ´t float it in shallow water) keeps me from rating it higher than 3/10. in my opninion the best police boat so far is 4021 *click to enlarge*
i love those minifigs, they'd go for alot on ebay i bet. great boat as well, i love the old hull design.

snefroe, on aug 7 2008, 07:53 am, said: my parents always needed to keep my quiet during the 3-day trip, and the best way to do that was to buy me a lego set... this still works nowadays. quote i often saw large quantities of lego sets in those gas stations though... i remember seeing yellow castle and... the galaxy explorer, standing on a shelf. these were the times... although i donÂ´t recall lego sets in fuel stations in the past i would appreciate to see lego "on the go" now. itÂ´s holiday time and i have two sons, you know.
as you may have seen in my topic in general lego discussion, i received a bunch of old lego from my step-grandmother-in-law. among the bricks were instructions and pieces for an almost complete set 345 from 1969. i was very excited to find this out, so i put it together. i recently took it apart and re-assembled it, taking photographs along the way for the sake of eurobricks. so, without further ado, set 345: house with car. first off is the car. this was still constructed in the bucket of bricks i received, so i never took it apart: next i'll show you the instructions. lots of added bricks per step, which was fun. however, the angle of the instructions sometimes made it difficult to find where things were supposed to go. the in-build shots. finally, an all-around view of the finished set. sadly, i don't have much time to post more pictures or thoughts. however, i'll try to come back and update the review later this week. until then, enjoy!
way before my time, too--in fact, this set came out twenty years before i was born! the baseplate doesn't actually have dots--i'm not sure if they were there once, and then rubbed off (a possibility, as the studs are rather smoother than i imagine they once were), or if this particular one didn't have the dots. this set also shows that the difficulty lego has in doing vehicle scale isn't new. the house is the perfect size for microfigures from the lego games; however, the car is massive--over twice as tall as a microfig!
great review. it is nice to see an in-depth photo review of this set. i especially love the last picture of your old city! it certainly does bring back memories...

theme: hobby sets set name: harley-davidson 1000cc set number: 394 price (new): 260-280 $, 185-200 euro price (used): 14-175 $, 10-125 euro pieces: 143 year of release: 1976 links: peeron, bricklink and brickset looking at the release date of this set makes me remember the good old times when lego sets stayed in production and could be found in stores for long years. yes, i hear you younger fols say this meant we had less variety at the time, but at least we did not have to go on a frenzy to get them all in just 1 or 2 years before they disappeared (to re-appear on the secondary market at crazy prices). anyway, i also realise this set is older than me by 5 years (at least the first boxes of this set). i think my parents bought it when i was something like 1/2 year old, or even before, as my father really liked the hobby set line and took any chance to get one, you know, for the kids, when theyâ€™ll be old enough to play with themâ€¦ i am really happy my father did it, too. as a matter of fact, this has always been one of my favourite non-minifigure scale sets. i know younger eyes will look on it and wonder how we could love and enjoy a model like this, so blocky and rough. just remember this was the best tlg designers could do with the bricks available at the time. enough about memories; letâ€™s start with the review! the box front the front of the box (here cut and folded to save space) shows the harley davidson 1000cc in all its glory upon a nice town landscape. i really appreciate how tlg box designers used a real life photo of the model in a real life environment to give this hobby set a better background. moreover, the landscape does not distract the eye, even with its lights, since the focus is strongly set on the motorbike itself. back (and sides) the back of the box shows the model on a more neutral background and from another angle. we can see the stickers in place (take a good look at them here, because i did not apply them). the right side we also see a pic of the set from the front, and one with a child playing with it. in this latter shot, the model rests upon a nice black box with a harley davidson sign on it. i frankly do not remember if this was some sort of tray or smaller box within the lego one or if it is meant for publicity only. another thing we can notice on the right-most side of the box is a white band, right below the lego logo, sporting the sign â€˜designed for experienced lego buildersâ€™ in various languages. all in all, a really well done and professional job. contents inside this set includes a number of parts in mainly black, white and light grey. some blue and yellow add nice touches of colour to the total. the partsâ€™ selection is not mind-blowing, as most of the pieces had been in production, in these same colours for years. anyway, iâ€™d like to focus on a couple of details: the milky white technic axles as well as the red technic bush old 2 are among my favourite parts. the bushes, in particular, are quite useful to build more sturdy looking tubes than what can be achieved with the newer and slimmer ones. it would seem that the tile pieces appeared in the â€˜without groveâ€™ version as a standard and in the â€˜with groveâ€™ version as alternates (see bricklink inventory). notice, though that the box (above) and instructionsâ€™ (below) pictures all show the â€˜with groveâ€™ variety. as said, there are no re-coloured parts in this set. new pieces the few new molds used in this set are: black and white slope, inverted 45 2 x 2 old type with round bottom tube, black technic, brick 1 x 2 with hole type ii and red hinge plate 2 x 4 with articulated joint â€“ male and female. the most interesting piece from this lot, as many of you will have noticed is the technic, brick 1 x 2 with hole type ii. this kind of technic brick was use during 1976 and 1977 only. it would seem tlg tried a new design variant, which did not meet success and was later replaced with the standard bricks again. nonetheless, iâ€™m sure that people who own these bricks like them for the unusual design and the possibilities they offer into adding details to their creations. instructions cover â€“ as usual, the instructions are not organised in the form of a booklet, but they consist of a folded double printed sheet. the â€˜coverâ€™ shows again the same shot as the front of the box, with bigger lego logo and set number and without the other additional information. â€˜back coverâ€™ â€“ here we see the full name of the set: harley-davidson flh 1200. this makes me wonder: why is this set known as 394 harley davidson 1000cc when it is indeed a 1200cc? anyway, what really makes me love this page is the list of stats below the photo, and in particular these two lines: h.p. (?)/(not given). this calls for just one question: why did harley-davidson not release this info? my opinion is that since this is a motorbike built for the police, they did not have permission to share the specifications on the motor, which was probably customised either by harley-davidson upon request or by the police themselves. â€˜random pageâ€™ â€“ as expected, no call-outs here, but the build is pretty straight forward and does not need them (apart for one passage weâ€™ll see later). the colours are easy to tell apart (in the end there is no dark grey in this set that could be confused with black). again, notice how the instructions include the â€˜with groveâ€™ tiles and not the older ones. maybe this was changed during the long time this set stayed in production? the â€˜last pageâ€™ shows other four models included in the hobby set line. unfortunately, i own only one of them: the 396 thatcher perkins locomotive. indeed, i would have liked to have them all! building start the handle bars look a bit too squared to me, but itâ€™s just a minor feature, and the overall shape is still good in my opinion. notice the red hinge plate, which will be almost totally hidden in the finished model (see below), and the blue tiles which work as indicators. the first steps, used to build the front wheel and windshield are really easy, until you get to the wheel. in facts, the instructions do not show clearly all the pieces needed for it, and i found myself with a â€˜floatingâ€™ wheel for the absence of one of the red technic bush old 2 on one side (the one not visible on the instructions, of course). not a big deal, but something that could have been done better. motor and seat the second part of the build includes the motor, seat and â€˜saddle bagsâ€™. the technique used for the motor, or better the radiator, is very clever. to get the ridged feel, tlg designers used 4 light grey plates stuck one on the other but not completely in contact. this way, the studs, while keeping the plates in position, keep them raised from one another at the same time. the yellow round bricks add some details and colour touches to this predominantly light grey parts of the vehicle. the use of the engine, smooth small, 1 x 2 side plates for the exhaust pipes, while quite clever, still looks a bit strange to me. iâ€™m mostly used to see them in airplanes, helicopters and spaceships. â€˜saddle-bagsâ€™, a simple build for one of the iconic parts of this motorcycle. here you see them in place, as well as get a look at the finished seat. i like how lego designers managed to make its shape with just a few quite big bricks. the â€˜saddle bagsâ€™ are a really nice touch, and they work perfectly when compared to the original. this is the rear wheel. as said before, only when you get to this passage in the instruction you get a real understanding of how the front wheel is supposed to be mounted as well. careful readers will notice how this is not one of the original wheels in this set. the original ones were mounted using the technic, gear expert builder 9 tooth. unfortunately, i could only find one of them in my collection, an itâ€™s used as the front wheel. by adding the rear wheel (which is shown from a better angle in the instructions), we complete the model. notice how the two technic bricks supporting the wheel are held in position by two 2x1 plates. i think this was a bad case of â€˜building by compartmentsâ€™ mentality: if tlg designers had considered this a bit more, they would have used 2 4x1 plates instead of 4 2x1. on the other hand, this is not the worst case i have seen in a lego set, and they keep up the tradition nowadays too. finished set front and here it is our fancy police harley-davidson! indeed, the front looks blocky and quite horrible to our eyes, but again, it was almost the best that could be done at the time. i only wish they had made it a little less bulky, even though this build is clearly thought to give better stability to the wheel. the blue tiles work nicely to emphasise the indicators, the slightly unsightly red plate is normally covered by the plate sticker and the windshield, albeit being hard to see through, is nicely shaped. back the back side is less detailed than the front, but shows the red light and antenna which are typical of the police motorbikes from this period. how many times have we seen this angle in the chase scenes from tv shows like â€œchipsâ€? side all in all, this model looks pretty sturdy (apart for the antenna, which falls off all too easily) and detailed, especially considering the limited variety of parts available and used at the time. they even got so far to put a 2x2 tile as kick-stand to display it without fear of it falling on the sides! bonus images size comparison? what i never understood about this set is what scale it is meant to be. i mean, it is clearly not minifig-scale, and it could not be technic-fig-scale (those came later). but it is not even miniland scale! moreover, the only other model with the same scale is the other hobby set motorbike, as the cars have a scale of their own and the thatcher uses still another one! final comments overall, this is a great set for collectors of old models and motorbike fans, or both. it does not sport a huge variety of bricks, but was a good choice at the time, and even if the result is matter-of-fact blocky when compared to the original, it implements some good solutions to minimise the lego brick appearance and maximise the similarity as much as possible. design & colour scheme â€“ 9/10 (the design is as accurate as possible, apart for the front mudguard maybe, and the colours are completely in line for a police vehicle. the solutions and details included in this set justify the â€˜expert buildersâ€™ label and add to the appearance, and, why not, playability of the model.) parts - 8/10 (not a huge selection, and very few new molds. nonetheless, a good source of black and white standard parts for mocs and one of the few sources for the extra rare technic, brick 1 x 2 with hole type ii pieces.) playability - 9/10 (a sturdy model which can take some serious play and swoosh-ing without falling apart. the easily detachable antenna and the lack of an appropriate scale interaction with most other models make it lose one point, though.) build - 7/10 (pretty straight forward, with few nice solutions and an already mentioned slightly obscure passage in the instructions.) price - 5/10 (like most older models, especially the hobby set and model team ones, this set can be found at reasonable prices only rarely. most of the times, people are asked shameful prices for such a smallish set.) overall: 8/10 very good. as always, questions, comments, and pic requests welcome! edited by whitefang, 17 april 2011 - 06:19 pm. indexed
luxorv this is an awesome review. the classic-ness of this set is just lovely. it's so easy to just fall in love with this set. you're review is outstanding as well, the pictures are so clear and the review is just solid. you've really polished your reviewing skills
thanks for the feedback guys! indeed this is a great set, and i'm very attached to it. as far as i remember, i got it for say my 2nd birthday, i think but it is not my first lego set. you'll learn more on this in my next planned review
thanks 'luxorv' for this review of such a classic old lego set and i do remember seeing these in a catalogue years ago. excellent brick-built police cycle, i think it's time lego did another one eh ? brick on ride on everyone !
great review for a classic model. i love it.
rare classic sets are always a priceless part of any lego collection, and it's a good thing you still have this first set of yours luxor (or did you purchase a new one?). excellent review btw, it's always a pleasure getting a closer look at these classic sets which i wouldn't have known to exist had i not seen this review. overall i think it's a really good set at that time, of course judging this one by modern standards won't be fair but at the time i'm pretty sure it was a 'cool' set to have (though less cooler than having the harley davidson set).
thanks for the review 'luxorv', an interesting old set, though i find it hard to imagine a square smoke stack instead of roundish. it truly has that classic lego simplistic build with all studs showing and making do with standard partsm except the few you havepointed out 'luxorv'. a nice flashback 35 years ago....now thats old school anyway brick on everyone !
thanks, luxor, for bringing us this excellent tour round an old classic! for its time, this is truly a remarkably detailed and beautiful set, and i think it's amazing how it's still in such good condition after all this time. do you have any more from this era (excepting the harley, of course )? i've created a whole new index to put them in
thank you very much for this wonderful review! this is the oldest lego set in my collection. i received this model from my grand parents many years ago - i'm not exactly sure who in my family it used to belong to, but it has a home with me now. it's a very simple but attractive looking vehicle, and functions pretty well too. overall, very nice.
nice review! great nostalgic set, like you said, it has nice design-simple yet effective! i like construction vehicles, so this set has even bigger impact on me!
ah, the good old days........thanks for the review 'yoshi648' - cute and cool at the same time. it's interesting to see that the same front end parts had been used from the early 70's up in to the late 90's ! nice again to step back in time and keep on bricking everyone !
woah. 25 cents for a mint condition set! that's amazing.
it's simply amazing how far lego has come in 30 years.
this classic space shuttle is simply superb! i love the layout of this shuttle. in fact, it reminded me as one of the space fighter jet, that roam around in space, defending the boundaries from intruders. i just love these old grey bricks very much and the printed computer brick is just lovely. it's such a pity, that i did not grow up with classic space in my childhood. these are actually great stuff, and formed the base of the space theme in lego. brickster, thanks again for another outstanding classic review.
very brave to give an impression about one of the oldest sets ever reviewed! a lot members here are younger than the set itself. i think you will have to have grown up with it to like it. nowadays we have seen quite a few better airplanes than that one, for example this years 7643 . but thanks for letting us know. btw., the 1x1 round brick with the solid stud is no. 3062a instead of 3062b (with the hollow stud).
great review, it's good to see some of the old sets reviewed. i think i learned something about the history of lego from this one.
i always thought that that grey thing on top of the rocket was some kind of satelite... xenologer, on jul 4 2008, 05:25 am, said: huh, did they not think of putting a technic axle down the center of the rocket? come to think of it, when were technic axles invented.... i had this set as a kid and i don't think there was a technic axle inside that rocket, but if i remember correctly some of the later cs rockets did.
i'm loving that trans-yellow plate on top of the roof. great review!
wooow! what a set!! not all that large, most defenitely not as sophisticated as the message intercept base from 10 years later, but in those, this was all a kid need to have hours of fun. soooo many great parts on this one.... technic hoses, computers, rocket parts, trans yellow parts... the perfect outpst really... it was actually my sister who got this one, but it only took an hour before i claimed it... edited by snefroe, 14 july 2008 - 12:36 pm.
ahh, the good old days. thanks for the review.
thanks for the review, my favourite detail is the salad! :-d btw, could you exchange the modules and make pics of that? i'd like to see how the building looks with the flat roof instead of the dutch style one. i'm not sure though if the vents on the flat roof makes sense as long as it's only used as a garage top... :-/ maybe they should be removable as the balconies and such things to make the modularity leading not to weird results... other than this: in combination with a lot of money and the cafe corner set this really could get me into city! ;-)
thanks for the great review! *sweet* now that i've seen the set, i'm afraid i'm a bit disappointed 8-| 1) the color combination doesn't really do it for me. blue, dark blue, grey, black, tan, white, they're all mixed together without any over all design... 2) is there any interior? it doesn't look like it, and in any case, you can only reach it if you remove the modules... hm... |-/ now it looks too much of a box... 3) there are most certainly some nice ideas in this model and some great parts. the best part of the model is the staircase 4) i don't think he spent much time in thinking about the design. as apo said, the chimneys on top of a garage is kinda weird, there's also a gate, next to another gate which is weird as well... also, if this is supposed to ba a grocery, then the owner has done a lot to hide it. the croissant is nice, but next to the brown box with vegies, there's nothing that suggests this is a shop... 5) the white lamp and the the yellow cylinder are at the same level of the tiles. imo it should be above the level of the tiles... 6), imo not worth the 90 euro edited by snefroe1, 20 june 2007 - 09:03 am.
thank you legocastlegirls for your quick review! *y* it?s the first time i realize the back of the market street. the tan bricks are a replacement for some windows i?d guess? i do love that building, especially the top floor with the neat balcony. *wub* of course you are (again) left alone filling the interior. but i just had some food parts ordered at bricklink... x-d one thing i?d like to know: this is an online-exclusive, right? can i order it at a lego-store (k?ln / oberhausen) and get the sum rewarded on my voucher booklet? *sweet* i heard it here, but i?m not sure. 8-| if anyone is looking for how to fill it with interior: go read the latest brickjournal #8! there?s a whole chapter written about designing the rooms. interior on!
hi thanks for posting those great pictures. i got the cc some time ago and i really looking forward to get my hands on the market street. i think the colour scheme of this set is great, maybe because blue is my favourite colour (just check my wardrobe)? i really like the design of the roof and the staircase. i ?am not so sure if i like the gateways but i believe they will grow on me when i get the set myself snefroe1, on jun 20 2007, 09:02 am, said: 5) the white lamp and the the yellow cylinder are at the same level of the tiles. imo it should be above the level of the tiles... i? am totally agree with snefreo1, the yellow cylinder and the lamppost should be on a level above the tiles. actually i have put a 2x2 plat under the lamppost on my cc, looks much better if you ask me. unfortunately shop at home does not send to norway???, so i have to purchase this set in billund (yes, i ?am going to legoland this summer) or on ebay.
thank you very much for that nice review and those lovely pictures, legocastlegirl! *y* a very interesting set with a great color scheme and some "sunny side" feeling indeed. *sweet*
legocastlegirl, on jun 20 2007, 07:42 am, said: i know it?s not such a nice review like *yoda* did the last times, but i hope you enjoy some of the pics. nonsense sandra !! tks for sharing these cool pics ;-) its also a nice hommage to erik brok. i really like this set, i think its really well designed with great ideas such as the dual stairs, the balconies, the croissant insignia, the market entrance design with the horns, whip and owl 8-? i like the color combination, and the mosaic design just in front of the entrance. the only terrible flaw is that yellow cinlinder !! that is just awful for a flower pot :-x i don't mind at all having that lamp post at the same level since it would be normal to have the base of the lamp at the level of the tile but i agree that is just pickering about an insignificant detail :-p legocastlegirl, on jun 20 2007, 07:42 am, said: a funny idea is the salad in the one box at the front. i think normally it?s a hairpiece of an exoforce fig. yeay that is just brilliant all the way 8-? this is a great set indeed and a must have for town fans !! *yoda*
you?re a lucky man.... *y* thanks for those cool pics. :'-)
impressive, really impressive mike 8-? many tks for sharing these great pics ;-) i really love it !! thats a really sweet way to make us want legions of blackies :-d darn you !! i really like the fact he still has a megaphone - classic all the way ;-) now i want to sing some metallica :-p quote blackened is the end, winter it will send throwing all you see, into obscurity death of mother earth, never a rebirth evolutions end, never will it mend never fire to begin whipping dance of the dead blackened is the end to begin whipping dance of the dead color our world blackened >:-)

wow, if the tru 6212 is to be believed, the luke marque costs $50. but that looks so cool. definitely a keeper.
hi, you are right, this is such a fantastic maquette. i really hope that i will get the chance to own the other 4, too. it is carefully packed in styropor. the painting is nice, looks really evil. i think it is a wonderful addition (with the 4 other) to any collector shelf..(-; mine is number 276. greetings hendrik
i have #70 (and #8 :-$ ). boba soon on copmike
mutley777, on dec 1 2009, 07:29 pm, said: well it has taken me over 2 years but i have finally bought this maquette! it's a real beauty! just don't ask what it cost! my set of maquettes is finally complete. you're not surprised, i'm jealous, right? but i have to ask: what did it cost? joke, don't tell it. because otherwise, burglars would be on their way.... great review! maybe one day i get one of these, too.

thanks for all the comments, guys, and thank you, joem16 and iamded for pointing out the reason for the skeleton horse leg positioning. ;-) well, i'll be gone on vacation until the 16, but i may pick up a set or two while down in tenessee, so if i do, expect a review and another story when i get back! ;-)
this is the only one of the new castle sets i've been able to get hold of so far. i know others have done it before, but as soon as i'd got it, there was something i just had to try: heh, cool! *skull*
great review *y* small set with great figs and pieces=must buy the story was hilarious :-) any chance you are going to review another set? i'm still waiting for a certain member *cough*hinckley*cough* to review skeleton tower :-d piranha
grevious, on jul 1 2007, 10:28 am, said: for being a 5 dollar set (well, seven in my case. darn your above average prices, tru!) none of the castle sets have leaked into my area. i'd gladly pay seven dollars for this set. consider yourself lucky.
an excellent little review! a must get! angler the precise... an accurate fisherman! :-d excellent story! edited by mr. mandalorian, 24 july 2007 - 02:11 am.
amazing little set. it seems this year that there are no crappy castle sets. good review.
i have not seen any either.... :-/
it seems the catapult defence has been taken off s@h for nz, so i assume it's out of stock for us. it's been off for a while. you guys might want to check your countries too. ~peace
that was a great review!!! very entertaining! :-d love the comics!
here is a review of the new monster dino creator set with power functions first lets start with the box which is much larger than it needs to be!! it is one of the new style re-closeable boxes rather than the rip the sides style. this set is typical of creator and comes with three sets of instructions. the monster dino a kind of spider and a crocodile the set comes with two of the new motors one small and one large, a sound module plus the new ir controler and receiver. there is a mix of techniques in this set the core is mainly studless technic, there are some studded technic parts and most of the details are standard creator style. there are two mechanisms one to control the legs and one to control the head and arms. the leg drive is from the large motor and the arm and head are operated from the small motor the completed mechanism will stand on its own without any detail added the detail is added to the base unit to complete the model. the operation of the dino is very good the design for the motors and drives is very compact and well thought out. the walking motion works well although there is no steering and it will fall over it it encounters obstacles. the sound module is built into the head so when the mouth opens the dino roars (sort of) glyman made the comment that this set is ugly as sin and i tend to agree i think there are too many colour variations with different shades of grey, black and that lime green :-p which confuses the look of the finished model but i guess it might apeal more to younger kids. i also do not like the spikes along the back, which glow in the dark, because the are loose and keep falling off. this set is not cheap at ?70 but i guess this is because of the motors and ir controller. while on this i was surprised how good the range was on the new controller it would still operate ever when not in direct line of sight. i would give this set a 10/10 for playabilityit has kept the kid amused for hours i would give it 6/10 for value for money it is a bit pricey overall 8/10 it took approx 3 hours to build and has been well played with i have posted some more images and some videos of the finished models on my brickshelf page here if you have any questions please ask pete edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 06:28 pm. indexed
:'-) such a beauty, the functions are great, cool video! i want to get this set so badly... great review! *y*
thanks for the nice review. it's butt ugly to me but the motors + ir control seem pretty neat ! even at that high price, it looks like a good parts pack ! *sweet*
great review, i must admit i didn't like mm at first site, but seeing this review and looking at the mm boxes at stores appeal to me rather greatly, i may get a couple of these sets, great job! *y* :-)
i've got it also, but i think i'll replace the ball joint pieces with the kind of pieces that give the wings their angle.
the dropships looks neat, and your review is good. it isn't my theme, but it clearly is a fantastic set for the space lovers under us. mars mission is really a good step in the right direction for tlc.
impressive review! really clear photos too! thanks. dr. s.
thanks for the bonus review. i am still on the fence with this one so every opinion is good! dunamis, on jul 14 2007, 07:41 am, said: but what about the at-at??? in case you don't know, the at-at in the dark side development kit had a single motor and a moving head. it worked by the head simply swinging from side to side due to balence shifts. i suspect the at-at will be same. i also think that there will be no remote for it either. edited by sinner, 14 july 2007 - 11:31 am.
tks once again dunamis for a great in-depth review ;-) i really look forward to your supped up and moded at-at :-p i am really not found of the design but i think its still a nice parts pack, especially with all these nice "power function" elements ;-) *yoda*
oh, is he ugly or what? i've never seen a dino that needed to go on a diet more then him. :-d but i'd get him for the pieces; all those lime-green pieces. *drools* but, meh, i'm not really in to mindstorms, so i don't think i'd get this. but anyway, nice review, i now know exactly what he's like. kml
i kind of like the design of this, but more importantly i really want to get my hands on the power functions motors and ir control system. i'd prefer the 8275 technic bulldozer, but there's no way i can stretch to the ?100 price tag, so i was thinking i would have to see if i could get a 4958 monster dino cheap in the january sales. then two things happened today. firstly i saw the dino in tescos reduced from ?70 to ?55. then my wife said she'd buy it for me for christmas. wow! that's never happened to me before. i love my wife! *wub* can't wait till christmas now!
i ended up buying a misb set recently from a lego collector who is clearing up his collection. excellent set to get the ir remote and ir receiver and other motors without paying insane amounts for the bulldozer now. there is a quite a number of parts in power miner lime green and 1x1 white teeth plate for the mouth and claws. the dino alone has 20 teeth in its mouth the glow in the dark "antennas" on the backbone of the dino is a nice touch as you can let him walk in the dark somewhat. i do agree with the reviewer, the box is insanely huge!!! i don't think lego wanted to show a 1:1 scale dino, they just wanted to promote the power function stuff as large as possible. also, the remote is smaller than shown in the picture as the hand holding it i think is smaller.
this is both my first set review and post about a star wars set- (even though i have been collecting them since '99). i got this one early this year so i thought i would post a review on it. please bare with me- i am not a great photographer. so with that in mind, here goes! front of the box: 75083 at-dp box-front by whitesidewjw, on flickr back of the box: 75083 at-dp box- back by whitesidewjw, on flickr shot of the bags: 75083 at-dp bags by whitesidewjw, on flickr the sticker sheet (i normally don't apply them, but for this i am going ahead and putting them on): 75083 at-dp sticker sheet by whitesidewjw, on flickr minifigs- i really like the two at-dp pilots, but the best agent kallus really does shine. of course we get an extra stormtrooper: 75083 at-dp minifigs by whitesidewjw, on flickr no new molds in this as far as i can tell, however these printed 4x4 domes are really great. i can see lots of uses for these in space mocs. 75083 at-dp new printed elements by whitesidewjw, on flickr bag#1 complete- nothing earth shattering here- an easy build: 75083 at-dp bag #1 complete by whitesidewjw, on flickr bag #2 complete: 75083 at-dp bag #2 complete cockpit seats by whitesidewjw, on flickr cockpit assembly: 75083 at-dp cockpit assembly by whitesidewjw, on flickr bag #2 complete 75083 at-dp bag#3 complete by whitesidewjw, on flickr "foot" assembly"- i like how they positioned the slopes 75083 at-dp "foot" assembly by whitesidewjw, on flickr complete at-dp 75083 at-dp complete by whitesidewjw, on flickr complete at-dp-side view 75083 at-dp side view (complete) by whitesidewjw, on flickr complete at-dp- over view 75083 at-dp complete- overview by whitesidewjw, on flickr complete at-dp rear view 75083 at-dp rear view by whitesidewjw, on flickr extra pieces 75083 at-dp extra pieces by whitesidewjw, on flickr the verdict: minifigs- 5/5- we get a total of four figs. i like the two at-dp pilots and agent kallus is a well done minifig. i can complain about another storm trooper either parts- 3/5- other than the dome pieces i commented on before, there is really not any new parts in this. if you build space, star wars, or machinery, this will still be a welcome assortment. experience of build 4/5- this really was a fun build. it came together fast but was challenging enough for its target age group. playability 5/5- this thing is much more sturdy than it looks. the legs take a little bit of effort due to the double locking hinges but hold together very well.this is a very minor complaint. value 4/5- typical- $49.99 for 500 pieces- i must admit i paid a little more than msrp due to shipping but i can't complain about the value. overall: 21/25- i really believe this is one of the best walkers that lego has designed. the only changes i would make would be adding real control panels in the cockpit and it would be nice if lego made a real widow to fit in with these types of builds rather than a transparent tile over another plate. all in all, i would recommend this set and i hope the rest of the 2015 star wars sets are on par with this.
looks really nice. one complaint is the back it is a pitty that lego didn't use any plates greebling there.
great review! thanks for doing it. i'm a big fan of this set, the minifigures are good, as is the parts selection. i like the piece used in the cockpit to secure the minifigure in place. i would've liked to see some panels in the cockpit though rather than translucent red pieces, that said however they are useful pieces.
pretty good first review! this looks pretty great, i probably won't be getting it due to budget constraints. (bionicle) but still, very nice set. to me it kinda looks like the missing link between when the at-st evolved into the at-at. also, i know the rebels stormtroopers get a lot of hate, but i really like them. thanks for the review!
thanks for the review! i have two questions: - what is the driver standing on, when the hatch is open and he is looking out? - could you show the face of kallus without helmet, please? my only complaint is that the colours of both, kallus's and the drivers's uniforms are wrong. kallus's uniform is way too dark and should be more dark olive than black, and the drivers's uniforms are too bright and should be more greyish compared to what we saw in the series.
great first review! as a huge walker fan its great to get one thats not a redesign, or one of those tiny battlepack vechicles.
the legs are about 2" shorter than the at-at; its cockpit is a little larger than the at-at's "head;" it doesn't look out of place as an escort-type walker or heavy walker, especially as both are built in the same style, although if scale differences really bother you the most recent at-st is probably a better bet for you. edited by hjmediastudios, 29 december 2014 - 04:32 pm.
great reveiw, shame on lego for forgetting that they already made a at-dp pilot helmet (ezra's from the phantom set) that didn't resort to needing a printed head.

super outstanding review! i am outside at this moment and this review is certainly great to read while you are on the move. i am looking forward to get this upcoming new modular. it is definitely fun to play and real awesome indeed. thanks oky for this very fine review.
fantastic review, could easily be the year's best, and it's only january 1st! you've got a duplicated picture in the bit where the candy is being moved from the outside and through the barber shop.. ...and i was expecting a final b&w picture or two where the detective makes his report to the woman in red, and gets his reward (candy, of course) or she in turn reports back to her real boyfriend, the candy smuggler. edited by rollermonkey, 01 january 2015 - 04:08 pm.
how was the pool table legs made?
looking forward to picking up this set on saturday :-) nice review, love the tiny details and the printed parts.
nice review, thanks a lot. managed to improve my opinion of the set a bit, but i'm still getting two to build larger buirldings as soon as we get the next 2x vip points special
this modular building will be my next set! thanks for the review!
snaplock, on 01 january 2015 - 07:40 pm, said: totally agree with you, the height does seem rather small. also 2x buildings on a 32x32 base-plate with a lots of spare studs behind the buildings are these buildings 12 studs in width?. it still looks great style wise, however this might be a set i buy and look at it after i have built it & regret the amount of $$$ i have spent on it. $239 for us aussie's . both are are 14 deep on the upper floors. do is 3 studs deeper on the ground floor, buit that's pretty much it. can't believe how cramped the upper floors of the barber shop look. we've come a long way from the wide and empty halls of cc and gg.
lego's affiliation with six wheelers go back a long way. i think the first one was released in 1981, more than 25 years ago. this year, lego added another one to the family, mars mission's "rhino 1", as its title sounds... it's been a while since i've bought and opened a large box, so maybe this isn't a surprise to most of you, but the box does not open at the front, as with many larger sw boxes, but at the side. the two printed seals(or whatever people call them) have gone as well, being replaced by one larger print in the middle of side... the box also isn't as thick as a large sw box, like the sandcrawler... the general size is, however, still quite large. pict0001.jpg 281.91k 102 downloads the back side shows the mars mission theme sets... eccept the rhino! i guess it shows this set will be released as a tru exclusive or something, only to show up in legoland shops and maybe lego shops... it's a shame really, because this is by far the best set of the theme. pict0002.jpg 285.42k 89 downloads when you open the front cover, you see a larger picture picture of the rhino. obviously, it seems to be some sort of multifunctional truck. i think the basic function is to drive around and explore. for that it has a drilling device and six giant wheels. pict0003.jpg 273.7k 82 downloads the set comes with two instruction books. i'm afraid to say they did not resolve the gray/black colors issue. colorwise, the real thing does not look like the instruction book because of it... pict0004.jpg 302.63k 75 downloads the rhino looks really big because of the six giant wheels. i guess it's more or less the same size as m-tron's magnetiser with the big difference between the two being that the wheels have been turned around, creating a unique wheel design for a lego model pict0285.jpg 290.59k 83 downloads pict0277.jpg 286.26k 80 downloads the wheels look very cool, even though the first couple of wheels stand a bit closer to each other. don't know why that is. hm... |-/ and they could have used a bit more body, but the design is pretty good. i know, "armagheddon" isn't far away... |-/ pict0292.jpg 216.75k 70 downloads the suspension of the wheels is a bit flimsy. sure, it allows the truck to move around in a more realistic way than the old sets, but it's not as flexible as some older sets, like sw's ctt. nor do the wheels have much body. the black bars you see on top of the wheels are more "window dressing" then functional... pict0293.jpg 244.78k 88 downloads the over all shape of the rhino is kinda "bulky", it looks more like a beatle than a rhino, if you're asking me. it has three major sections, but i wouldn't call it a modular building though... the cockpit is the first section. it's spacious and detailed. pict0290.jpg 262.77k 0 downloads pict0291.jpg 299.75k 87 downloads the cockpit hangs down from a weird angle. it's attached to a large vertical technic brick that is part of the rhino's main structure, so it's not a seperate spaceship, which is a shame... oh well... you can't have it all, i guess... pict0301.jpg 291.13k 78 downloads ah yes... stickers all over the place, but they're cool. the mid section of the rhino dominates the basic shape of the model. it's as if those two large white parts form a strong and thick shield, protecting whatever is inside from whatever is outsde. pict0007.jpg 213.22k 67 downloads unfortunately, there is nothing inside. it's extra space needed to house the spaceship. that's really a shame; a command center of some kind could have given the rhino a bit more "panache". pict0286.jpg 251.35k 87 downloads however, what's really great, is the way in which they fit together: one side has an orange 1x2 plate that fits in between two white 1x3 plates of the other side, creating yet another unique shape for a lego model. but again, it's a shame they didn't do more with this section... x-o pict0283.jpg 287.75k 82 downloads the third and last section is a platform for a space ship. pict0299.jpg 289.5k 77 downloads pict0287.jpg 199.78k 75 downloads the platform itself isn't really special. no details, no stickers,... it's just a skeleton to carry the spaceship, nothing more nothing less. no, your space ship doesn't fall off, even if you rotate the platform into a launch position, pushing the weight of the ship backwards. in fact, the position of the ship onto the platform is so solid, it's kinda difficult to imagine how this ship flies off. |-/ the ship on the other hand, is pretty cool. it's all sorts of things at the same time it seems. it transports two aliens, but also a small car that reminds me of the small sets of spacepolice 2, blacktron 2,... pict0295.jpg 307.4k 85 downloads pict0298.jpg 268.13k 75 downloads pict0294.jpg 276.84k 76 downloads the shuttle reminds me of a star trek shuttle and i think it needs some modding, but i do think it looks pretty nice. sure, the cockpit is a bit too low, a pilot needs to lay down instead of sitting down and the dropping mechnism, if there is one at all isn't all that brilliant either... the main structure is a bit too technical for me. i prefer actual parts with studs, not these lego technic bars and pins. pict0006.jpg 224.43k 74 downloads the crew: pict0276.jpg 239.43k 70 downloads ah yes, there's also this green plastic residu. think they are supposed to be the aliens... and there's also this weird alien craft, but i didn't bother to build that... *sad* good: *wub* great, innovative design, lots of potential, i even like the colors *sweet* lots of playability it's a big, attractive model; i don't see any weak spots in the design that could compromise stability or structural integrity. not so good: |-/ too many technic parts, some sections on the model, like the gun and the drilling device are a bit to flimsy i'd say 7.5-8.5/10 price: 750 danish crowns, about 105euro
thanks dude. this is a great set. can you please take more pictures? thanks
wow. this year, my wallet size has been bugging me. *sigh* still, it's a good-looking set and i will get it. too many big sets...
this is a great review and so is the set *y* i thought i would buy it, but when i saw the price... i changed my mind x-d i always liked flying things better though... like the dropship... although that is a bit pricey too, i guess x-d
this set is truely incredible, a must have. but this set is also incredibly overpriced *n* ! com' on it's only a big vehicle , nothing really special to justify the near 100? price tag. this set is clearly worth something like 65? at max. look at the incredible dropship for 34?, that's a good value for money! *y* edited by mutex, 15 july 2007 - 04:57 pm.
snefroe1, on jul 16 2007, 07:19 am, said: ok then... i'll do that later on... but i will not touch that plastic residu! x-d you touched them to put them in their holders in the ship. so in theory, you will not review them. anyways, nice review. i don't think i'll get this though. i'm trying to decide between this, moble devastator, or anothe 90$ set. i need to get something large before my b-day... regards, ~vbbn~
i think the life on mars series was great. although i didn't click until the line was gone that the red hangar on the alien base was for the red mech, and same with the blue one. man, i was gutted when i realised that, i want those mechs! however, the base was great, with the small mech and the flying crafts. could the lom mechs have been the spark of life for exo-force? 8-? edited by iamded, 31 august 2007 - 05:15 am.
very nice review, mostlytechinc! once i saw this set i was interested in it for the colours and pieces...thanks for this review to shed more light onto it!
isn't getting parts in new colors a good thing? it is a shame there is only this one set, i think tlg could make a whole subtheme out of frozen. i do agree that they overuse lavender and magenta, i don't see why every girl set has to have these sort of colors instead of what would be accurate to the source material .
thanks for the review mostlytechnic. i too wish they had done a real castle for this set, it certainly deserved it. my sons and i figure they could have used the old rock monster mold from rock raiders in white for the missing snow beast. i will pick it up though for the figs and unique pieces.
thanks for the review! i have the same opinion about the design, looks like belville. i bought it on legostore orlando december 30th. it was impressive. my wife saw them putting on shelf, 8 or 10 boxes. she ran and grabbed the last one! the girls faces around it was indescribable, mix of ecstasy and afraid to loose it. it happened in less than 2 minutes. my 7 yo girl didn't want it. she likes the dresses but hates the movie. prefers lego movie. but my 2 yo girl who never saw the movie grabbed it for good, and we bought it. lego will sell it like water, but i do not understand why a set so small. it is the worst set design since the introduction of lego friends. my 7 yo has more than 50 lego friends minifigures, all the lego fiends stores and concluded that the castle had a terrible design. she is 7!! let's be honest, lego should have released this sets months before this christmas and is loosing a perfect opportunity to sell a decent set, with much more pieces. i am wondering if they are going to make another set with the same characters. at the end,. it is just for the minifigures.
the review is very well done. thanks! i don't know the movie. my key question is whether the bricks in the set will allow to build my own snow/ice creations. now, with "trans-glitter" being part of the design approach i am not so sure. can those who have already bought it tell me: can trans-glitter be used as "transparent with snow particles" or is it just terrible? i cannot really tell from the review pic above.
thanks for the review. this will end up being a must buy for my daughter.
bennemans, on 13 january 2015 - 06:08 pm, said: there is a very simple reason for the flowers and green-leaved trees; you should remember from the movie it was actually summer when elsa set of the eternal winter… true, but all around her ice castle it is all winter. so why are there non-winter bits in this set? doesn't make sense. the picnic is because they wanted a mini-vignette for olaf to fit into, but the rest of the green and flowers don't make sense. tenorikuma, on 13 january 2015 - 09:58 am, said: i'm pretty sure i've gotten other sets recently with three pieces of tape on them. cool, good to know. was wondering but haven't remembered to look when i'm at a store recently. whitefang, on 13 january 2015 - 09:12 am, said: very nice review indeed and i also can't wait for the release of this set. it will be a superb wonderful addition to the lego disney princess theme. thanks for the fp, but "a lovely sweet review?" i thought i bashed this set pretty hard
this seems to be one of those sets that lego really should have released a month before christmas, it likely then would have been toy of the year 2014,
i'm trusting there is something else going on behind the scenes because this should have been a huge set and released in november of 2014 at the latest. maybe we will see more and better frozen sets when the post-christmas consumer spending wave hits. edited by m0dulo, 13 january 2015 - 10:03 pm.
what's up pups? i have written a review for 7786 batcopter: the chase for scarecrow on my website: brickzone.net as usual it involves fabuland figures involved in a crazy story. enjoy and feel free to let me know what you think. thanks! x-d click on the picture to read the review...
great review *y* :-) your reviews are so funny they are so much fun to read especially the end part with the comic spoiler alert!!!! :-d gavin always dies though but it is still hilarious i can't wait till your next review or till your "book of the ancients tale" quick question,are you making it serious or funny? i prefer funny ;-) piranha
great review! funny as allways! the comic was just a hell lot of fun. it really had me laughing. i would love to have this set but the price is just to high here, far worse than i had expected. i'll be better off buying the battank, which is much better priced. actually there is almost no price difference between the batcopter and the battank here *wacko*

what about the cartoon??? batman: the animated series will always be the definitive batman to me. the two tim burton movies were okay (they haven't aged well though), and i really dig what christopher nolan is doing with the new movies. christian bale did a fine job in "batman begins" ... but when i watch the movie, i hear kevin conroy's voice in my head. the cartoon rocked. and as much as i enjoyed the justice league unlimited cartoon, my biggest complaint was always: more batman please!!

you're second post on this forum and already you bring us this great review. thanks for making this !!
thanks for this great review *y* :-) and welcome to eurobricks *n* whats with the obi wan head??? darn tlc........ piranha
kernow, on jul 22 2007, 10:48 pm, said: a new r2 unit as well. don't remeber this in the film, but great to have one in a new colour. *wub* it's also at this point that you come across a big disappointment. on the box you get a flesh qui-gon. what is actually in the box is an epiii obi-wan. more to come... :-) nice review and i can?t wait to see part ii :'-)! the "qui-gon" incident is just plain stupid >:-(! nice to have a new droid *y*! part ii wait on copmike
what's up kernow!!?? nice review. thanks for sharing. welcome to eurobricks, i hope you have fun here! :-d x-d that qui-gonn thing is weird. come on lego! someone is just asleep at the wheel over there with quality control. missing pieces, injections molds, slipping quality, ice cube trays...imo, that's a huge thing to miss. the mini-fig on the box doesn't come in the set=false claims. anyway, the ship looks beautiful and i wanted this set when i first saw it and your review confirms that it is very cool. thanks again! x-d x-d
kernow, on jul 22 2007, 11:36 pm, said: 7665 review part 2 there's one more useful feature. the whole ship can be safely and comfortably picked up by two ball ended technic pins towards the back end. it balances well at this point and does allow you to swoosh the ship around much more easily. yeah, nude swoosh on x-d! excellent review! this looks like a very nice piece of lego-enginereing *y*! like you i think it looks like the original. i did think though that it was supposed to be a un-armed ship but i can defenitly live with that x-d! the escape shuttle looks roamy enough, a bit dull though but it could have a ps iii stached away somewhere, but the other shuttle :-| - come on! is it for mini-me when he needs to go and get some burgers & fries? getting at least two on copmike
brick miner, on jul 31 2007, 07:46 pm, said: as for the set, the thing that jumps out at me most is the use of dark blue for water... im so used to seeing the classic blue for water, that the dark blue seems weird. i don't like it. - bm indeed, i only noticed this when i saw the s@h images. i guees that they're on dark waters. you can always put some trans blue and trans clear 1x1 round plates, no? i tried that technique to make the lava (using trans red and trans orange plates), it looks neat. regarding the human soldier thing yoda mentioned, it's quite weird. like him, i'm going to swap the legs, so they're coherent with the soldiers from the other sets. third note: is it just me or did you attach the two black gate pieces too high? shakar
nice review, i like the building/port the most mmm,dark blue plates *wub* pity it is a toys'r'us exclusive, in the netherlands there are only toys'r'usses in the greater cities.
yes, very nice review mr brickster! i think i , for a change, like the castle part better. the ship doesn't look quite right to me. if they're gonna make a pirate theme with ships like this i wouldn't be very happy... but i think the ship brings some nice accesories. like the anchor, a black mid piece(!), steering wheel etc. i think i'll buy it eventually. wout, on aug 1 2007, 08:19 pm, said: nice review, i like the building/port the most mmm,dark blue plates *wub* pity it is a toys'r'us exclusive, in the netherlands there are only toys'r'usses in the greater cities. ah, that's good to know, now i won't be searching in other toystores as well! thanks! mr tiber

ok here is the set alot of us star wars fans have been waiting for! the 7666 hoth rebel base! *wub* first the box now the great minifigs! that stunning k-3po fig! now the snowspeeder! aaaaggghhhhh these parts are all stickers! now for the turret! the 2 cones on the side press in to fire out 2 blue lights saber blades :-d now for the small crane thingy. yes the part under the engine on the snowspeeder is another sticker 8-| echo base!! (well the front door anyway :-d ) the main control room? :-d again these are stickers on a tinted clear panel and on the slope |-/ i have no idea what this is meant to be! :-d finally 2 shots of the full set! *wub* well over all i really like this set and think it is great value for money. the minifigs alone would set you back more than the cost of this set. the build time was a good 2 hours or so and was good fun! the snowspeeder is not as good as the second snowspeeder and no where near as good as the first in my opinion, but i did love that first one. the k-3po fig is perfect and it is good to be getting more droids that aren't r2-d2 and c-3po. it is a shame about the stickers but that is the price of keeping the cost down i suppose (the only printed part in the whole set is the snowspeeder/x-wing windscreen). i will definately be getting atleast another 3 of this great set. 9/10
i love it.... depending on the australian price! (if it comes down here that is.) incidently, i have no idea what that other yellow thing is either! thanks for the review.
thanks for the review! mutley777, on aug 2 2007, 02:37 pm, said: i have no idea what this is meant to be! :-d that's to put the snowspeeder on (there should be a 2x4 plate underneath the snowspeeder that fits in that gap).
wow you are so lucky to have that sett ! , men ! tlc dont let me wait! , ?hh i mean tru
a very good review, thanks mutley777! *y* hmm, that shattered base looks better than i thought.... a very playable set, really nice. for the snowspeeder, i prefer the main gun design of its predecessor, but the grappling hook gun is a good improvement. if the door would just be large enough for it.... :-p
don't worry guys, the snowspeeder fits through the door easily :-)
wow!! why didnt you bought 3 of them :-d?

thanks for a great review. i've got a pile of tru and lego credit i wanna spend and was thinking about getting this (since i got a sneak peak of your review in the academy) but it's not here in the us yet. too bad. wonder when it'll hit? i do disagree about the manuals though. i find the thinner, stapled manuals easier to use than single large square-bound ones since they lay flatter when open. have any links to the prelim photos of the front end? i don't remember seeing that and was curious how different it looked.
really thorough review, jim. i am super jealous that you have 2 of these and i have none, with no opportunity to get one any time soon.
great review jim and stunning pictures
i think i read somewhere that the us will not get this set or the motorcycle until august 2015. that means the flagship most likely won't be in august but even later in the year... nothing bricklink can't solve though.
great review with fantastic pictures. as for the model, i'm glad that they chose to make it less pretty - real le mans prototypes are rarely a sight to behold. it is function and aerodynamics over form. i would, however, have preferred more realism for the sake of learning: - the front shouldn't open like that - instead it should be easy to remove the whole front cover, leaving the suspension easy to work on. - the aero seems to be realistic, except for the rear end where there's no indication of a venturi channel. this should have been easy to include. - there is no fuel tank, nor fixed fuel connector right behind the cabin. - there are no air jacks! seriously!? this is one of the most unique features of a race car like this... and lego forgot about them. instead they automated two functions which are manual on a real race car. - the top cars at le mans are hybrids with ingenious systems. i would have loved to see the front wheels connected to some kind of spinning apparatus indicating a kinetic energy recovery system. if i get this set... i'm going to make some modifications.
awesome review jim! i love the pictures. i don't like how lego did this model though. too many compromises edited by omikron, 13 march 2015 - 07:24 am.
a great review jim. just finished building this set. a couple of steps required abit of lego stressing to get together when there was an easier way. just made it into rc ( almost finished it in ldd) which was easy to do as it has so much room for nearly any configuration of motors and not have them showing. a great set. edited by jono.rocky, 13 march 2015 - 10:53 am.
thank you vey much for this review. i do have some questions; 1. what are the white clutches geared into? 2. is the engine geared to one or both drive motors? 3. how well does it go on carpet? 4. can it doze without breaking the blade?

excellent review, thanks! what is the cost in us? not released in my area. the shovel is obviously my favorite area, it looks detailed and strong. i love the treads, because i need them to move the 4 x 4 barrels on my super-scaled turbolaser turret. very good pics too. what color are the treads? i never had them. they are plastic or rubber? edited by grand moff viceroy, 03 august 2007 - 12:34 am.

lordgalewind, on aug 3 2007, 03:17 am, said: ah man...i wanted to review it with mine. oh well. here in the u.s. it cost $150 and has 1355 pieces total. the pins and axles did seem a bit difficult in putting them into place. a problem i have been having is the batterys are done after about 4 hours of play, which i really wish they would last longer :-( . overall it is a stupendous set and it is really nice to see our old friend the studs make a return! you found it in the u.s.???? where?? i'm really liking this set! its looking better now that i'm seeing more of it at differnt angles. i'mvery curious how wellit pulls, and and can push/doze before the clutches start slipping.
thanks for the review, it really looks cool. too bad it's soo expensive. :-/ i must admit that i prefer the 8421 mobile crane for more or less the same price, the design is more "sexy". *wub*
nice review, ickelpete. thank you.
ickel, thanks for that awesome review. it makes me want to buy this set. i think it'd go just swell with the mobile crane. the fact that it has all the motors and such is awesome, i can foresee using those for a lot of other functions for mocs. and, well i'm a fan of treads. you can never have enough treads :-d hm, would you be able to tell us, perhaps after a test or two what kind of weight this beast can push around? thank you!
eyesonly, on aug 6 2007, 09:11 pm, said: what i really want is for philo or someone to test it's power and such. *sweet* edit the power of the motors that is. its getting late. *sing* i just noticed that he has done that in brick journal 8. check out page 56-61 for great info and a comparison to the gear motors. to bad it didn't include the nxt-motors since they are very similar.
the new small technic sets have incredible functionality for their size, and this one is no exception. with only 106 parts this crane can roll, extend, rotate, lift (and hold in any position) and has working stabilisers! the boom extends the same as the other sets with this boom; simply pull it. it works surprisingly well and due to circular ridges inside the boom the extension (which is just a standard beam) will hold in place. the gear at the back controls the height of the boom. as you can see the boom is only half extended. boom fully extended, half down. the cable is kept in place via two gears and a blue pin, same as the 7905 crane. even under decent weights this works well. the stabilisers however cannot handle much weight once the load is moved off axis. the stablilsers are a very simple but effective design. another shot of the stablilsers. this also shows how far the boom will decend. the boom height mechanism works well also. i love the cab design. overall this is a remarkable achievement for the low price. i bought it for the boom piece as i want to improve the crane that came with 7998 7898 ( :-$ ). i highly recommend it.
very nice review sinner! *y* *wub* so we are getting more and more reviews with figs in it, that?s great! :'-) i actually wanted to skip this technic set, but your review made me think again. i haven?t seen you posting a price, so i will do that for you :-p : it?s (just) 9,99? in germany.
really awesome review! i didn't think this set could be that great, but it looks very nice and seems quite cheap. *wub*
a very nice review of a very good little set, thanks sinner! *y*
cute. do mine eyes deceive me, or is it actually minifig scale?
holodoc, on aug 5 2007, 05:10 pm, said: oh no! look at the small yellow "cabin" - no minifig would ever fit in that! :-) other scale on! my bad. i must have been drinking cough syrup. i thought this was some kind of mini-crane they might use to lift very small bits of steel. *smack of the head against wall*
5150 lego, on aug 9 2007, 01:59 am, said: but one question. what crane are you refering to that came with 7998? that is the new heavy loader, and it didn't come with an any crane> 8-? sorry. my mistake. i meant 7898. :-$
thanks for all the feedback you guys! robert8, on 12 april 2015 - 11:25 pm, said: i can't help but think the minifigures are the weak part of the set. snake and apu are great but the rest.... i don't know. they kinda redundant now. they could at least give us new torso printing, like homer wearing his jacket or bart wearing his blue t-shirt or marge wearing her coat. or, as i said in the discussion thread, i'd have included jasper in cmf series 2 and a frozen version here. overall, the set looks kinda smaller than what i thought. i agree, but so many people were complaining about how the simpsons house should have included the most common versions (mostly because the eyes or whatever), so i think lego played it safe and just included the normal versions. it makes sense, since series 1 is gone forever, and the common versions were in there, and this set is bound to be in stock for a very long time like the death star. i never really agreed when people were complaining about the alternate eye prints personally, but i guess this is a good business choice based on previous feedback. edited by just2good, 13 april 2015 - 12:06 am.
can you post a pic of it next to the simpsons house? just curious about size comparisons...
that's actually not bad sizing, imo. sure, it looks like you get a lot more with the house, but the kwik-e-mart has a lot more of those little references that make it simpsons. i agree with some of the complaining; a real jasper behind a trans-blue panel would have been cool. you could always bulk up the roof with more foliage... i think it has a great foundation as a set, but could do with a few mods to make it better. thanks for the pictures; i greatly appreciate being able to see reviews like this before dropping $200 on a lego set.
great review.
tks sinner for that cool review ;-) this set is not one of my favs (never was really a big fan of those raised baseplates) but had fantastic parts and mfs !! it has great playability with really cool "80's miami" feel *wub* that pink was actually pretty cool and went well with that lime green (i think its lime but i'm not 100% positive). once again this pisses me off so much that i was in my dark ages when this theme was out !! i loved it, especially all the beach/water themes *wub* i really wish tlc decided to bring that water paradisia back !! who knows !! after all they need to make some girlie sets !! girls are a part of their market totally neglected !! how many women we have on the boards ?? really a tiny few unfortunatly !! so tlc, please bring paradisia back in may 08 :-p , please !! *yoda*
due to a larger bl order in the u.s. i couldn?t resist to add two hopper waggons to my train layout. here?s a review of this fantastic set. the box. well, there?s nothing really special about it. the open box with three polybags. note, that there are only three different colors used in that set (actually there are 4, but you can?t see the dark grey ones). great color composition by the way. *wub* and - no stickers !!! - :-d oooops - i opened the bags too fast. help me, i?m drowning! *sing* not following the instructions, i built the wheels first to get the larger pieces out of the way. keep on rolling. this is the load of the hopper waggon. 11 round bricks altogether. when i opened the set, i was curious if it was a new colored set or an old one. luckily enough it was an old one, with old dark grey. i don?t know if tlc ever produced this set with bley. from the following pic you can clearly see, that the set is an old one. look at these slope bricks. see what i mean? all bricks are looking exactly the same! buy a set today means get at least three different textures on the slopes and maybe even more shades of tan. :-x >:-( i have said that in many other threads here and i?m saying it again: back to the roots, lego! you were able to produce good quality. show us you can still do it! *sad* but now to the building. it?s a 6 x 24 train base plate you?re building on. did i say i liked the colors? :-d this is the mechanism to unload the waggon. built in the waggon with open gates... ... and with closed ones. almost done. this is the first time, i realized that minifigs actually can step on those ladders. :-$ a short lift and the wheels are fixed. this darn mechanism! wait, i?m coming with my monkey wrench! >:-) who opened that door again? do i have to do it all on my own? :'-( finally the work is done. now have a brake. one shot from the front/back. you can see the car is really huge! 8-? i put it behind the red car of the 4512. that sure looked very strange. *wacko* the set fits a lot better to the other cars of the "my own train" theme than to the older ones. the score: brick selection: 10/10 excellent color and brick selection (these were the days...) playability: 9/10 great unloading mechanism price/piece count ratio: 8/10 at peeron it says 20$, i got it for 39,95$ -> 30?/228 bricks. not really cheap, but worth every cent! :-) overall rating: 9/10 and a definity "must buy" for rolling stock lovers. sad enough it?s not available on s@h any more. but there are still sets on bl and ebay. that?s for now folks, thank you for reading. i have some job to do...
wow, you?re pretty strong, especially for a hologram. :-d thanks for that neat and funny review of a very fine set, doc! *y*

great review! i loved the pic of your sigfig buried under legos :-d it's too bad lego did not continue to make more of this style of set.
yes my spongebob fans, its time for another review !! lets look at our bikini bottom map and head strait to meet miss puff at her boating school. she is waiting for us to give us a guided tour of her establishment ;-) another bit of sb history: this set comes from the following episode: boating school: spongebob fails his boating test for the 38th time (what a freaking retard lool). he's so determined to get his license that patrick decides to help him. he implants a walkie-talkie inside sb?s head in order to cheat and tell him what to do. you will say that i am biais but i really enjoy building this set and i really like the sb theme !! lets hope 2008 brings more of that cool spongieness !! but i digress... here are general pics of the instruction booklet and the dss (g there are loads of crappy stickers in that one also !!). as you can see the set is divided in 3 polybags. shamelessly (but nonetheless wilfully hehe), i will disregard the third one which is that playability crap course !! i would have reviewed it but since it involves stickers, i didn?t want to ruin the parts and without stickers it would look dull, plain and ugly (it does look crappy with so imagine without), so that review will not be 100% complete and i do apologise in advance. but how many of you would have build that and keep it hehe off :-p 1/ mfs and extras i will start with the really cool miss puff *wub* (the fig mind you !!). she looks a bit stressed !! no wonder, that sponge menace will bring her to the hospital once again hehe. as you can see, that mf comprises 3 parts: the small blue 1x1 round and the 2 major parts. yeay another great stupid looking sb. i love those idiotic faces !! 3 different sb figs and 3 idiotic faces hehe. you never can get enough of them !! here is just a regular patrick. too bad patrick doesn?t have different expressions ! the pull back boat car: nothing really to report (except the fact that i left it sticker free !!) the only thing i built from the third polybag is that pretty cool ancker holding tower thingie !! looks great in a lighthouse set hehe. yes the roud tile bouey is printed !! its the same as in sb's bed in the bikini bottom set ;-) ok, its time for those two great buildings: the lighthouse and the school + pontoon !! before reviewing them individually, here is a general pic. 2/ the lighthouse one of the main reason to own that great set !! sure it suffers from accute stickeretite (sad but :-d ). t worst is that door), but nonetheless a great and simple building !! great white/red colour scheme, and a really fantastic 2 turning lights !! i really like the yellow top of the lighthouse, it adds to the comic atmosphere of that theme instead of having a more plain red/white only. the rear has nothing really fancy, except tools to fix it in case of problems hehe. the only thing i modified since i didn?t build the third polybag is that i got rid of the trechnic parts on the right of the lighthoue to replace them with regular ?logs? all hail the tower king !! :-d 3/ the school and pontoon i really like that little building and its great to see that once again tlc uses the amazing dark blue color !! its really a simple design but looks fantastic and can be used for many things in a town hehe i also really like the combination with those dark bluish grey slopes !! the rear reveals the desk, stickers on the wall (d?oh !!) and two clams serving as chairs (really like on the show). its really great to see that tlc stays really as close to the show as possible. the pontoon again is simple yet really cool and effective. and its really nice to have 2 lifesaving boueys. the only thing i modified since i didn?t build the third polybag is that i got rid of the trechnic parts in front of the pontoon to replace them with regular ?logs? on the overall, i think its really a great set !! apart from the crap stickers, i think tlc should have ditched (or simplified) the third playability polybag to lower the cost !! oh well, parts are always usefull (except those one part shitty palm trees !!). so until my next review, i bid you farewell my spongebob fans !! and i really hope to see next year hehe will sb get his driver?s license one day ? for the sake of bikini bottom, lets hope not !! no license ever on !! *yoda*
that?s really a great and overall nice playset with a very cool mrs. puff and a fine new spongebob! *sweet* the boating school?s indeed very nice with a beautiful color scheme, and so is the lighthouse.... i?m really tempted to buy a second set just to "complete" these buildings.... although it?s a little too expensive for doing so, and it wouldn?t even fit with the style of the other sb sets. x-d wet highway to the poor puffer fish? privat hell on! :-d
you've done it again. *yoda* ! great reveiw. i really like this set, but in my opinon, $50 is steep considering i won't actually 'play' with it. i mean, half of it is a track for peat sake! ill eventually get it for the mrs. puff figure, though. *y*
nice review !! i'm not a big fan of those spongebob figs. however this set has some very useful pieces. this is actually the first time i took a decent look at a spongebob set.

mr. mandalorian, on sep 1 2007, 12:27 pm, said: so, uh, are you willing to sell that vulture? *sweet* i was going to buy the set so i could moc an eagle out of that vulture, but i never bought it. pleeaase? x-d sorry, but i actually wanted almost every part in this set. it's one of those sets i could buy 100 of and still want all of the pieces. *wub* in particular, the vulture has several hinges, black wings, and the dark red pieces that i want loads of. sorry. :-$
yesterday i went to toys 'r us and bought the dilophosaur ambush. beside that the shop had a display of the jw polybags. for €3,49 i picked up two of them. now here is my little review of this pretty nice set. first some data: line: jurassic world year: 2015 pieces: 29 price: €3,49 packaging: polybag ok, lets start with the polybag itself. it is a standard size and had plenty of room for all the parts. the front depicts the whole set with a little hexagon on the right with a seperate picture of the dinosaur and its name. in this case the celophysis is called gallimimus. weird choice next is the instruction sheet. it is a doublesided paper with every building step in clear sight. the part selection is nice. there are only a few but all of them are pretty usefull for all kind of builds. there are two parts which stood-out. both are printed tiles. the first one is the yellow/black warning tile in 1x4. you can't have enough of that. the second one is a 2x2 tile with the jurassic world logo on it. that's pure awesome. the bigger sets seem to have only sticker for that, so this little set is a perfect way to get hold of this nice tile. the leftovers. nothing special. here is the complete trap. it is a basic build and functions pretty well. in the end the parts are more interesting as the build so it will definitely end up as a parts-pack. now on to the star of this bag. the celophysis/gallimimus. i don't know why lego decided to call this dinosaur mold any different, but i think it has to do with movie-connection and the will to not produce a new mold. nevermind, this figure is great and the colour is very bright and totally stood out. pretty beastie. a comparison between the 2015 gallimimus and the 2012 celophysis. the final set in all its glory. final verdict: it is a great little set. the parts used a nice and usefull. the printed tiles are the secret stars of this set and the dinosaur is fun two. with a few packs of these you could easily build a celophysis pack with lots of jurassic world signs on their way. highly recommended.
nice review! i really hope its avaliable for sale in the us.
thank you, guys. i'm glad you liked this review. it's a nice little set.
nice i had to buy the jw lego game to get mine.
lego 31036 creator toy and grocery shop thanks to eurobricks for making this review possible! for years, lego has offered a house of some sort in the creator line each year - with the standard creator 3-in-1 instructions, that's given us a very wide variety of housing. in 2014, they added a business option with their 31026 bike shop and cafe set. this continues into this year's toy and grocery shop set. these shops are smaller than the very detailed modular buildings, but that should help them fit in better with the other city sets, and this also lets them get into more kids' cities with their lower pricetag. name: toy and grocery shop set number: 31036 pieces: 466 price: $39.99 minifigs: 2 theme: creator year of release: 2015 links: bricklink peeron brickset the box the front of the box shows the "a" version model out of the three, plus insets of the b and c versions. i like the sorta-european looking backdrop; it goes well with the styling of the buildings. interestingly, the main model is shown opened up for play, while the two insets show those versions folded. the box top on the top of the box, lego helpfully shows that with 3 of these sets, you can make a whole street. the box back on the back, you get to again see all three versions together, but this time, folded. it's a little creepy though with those clones running around :) the manuals yep, three actual, printed manuals. there's nothing indicating them as being a, b, and c models, but it's pretty obvious looking at the designs which is the "main" model and which are the alternates. the contents bags of parts and two plates. nothing terribly exciting to see here.... the minifigs nothing new here, but two nice figs none-the-less. well, bricklink does say that both figs are unique to this set, but there's not any new parts to them. the closest thing to rare is the female head - it's only in this set, 2013's dragon mountain castle set, a uk store grand opening set, and one of the 2014 holiday freebie sets. the faces aren't that unique, but i guess this exact combo of two faces on the head is. i love the kid torso with the spaceman on it. the minifig backs no back printing on anything here except for an alternate female face. sorry. i do like that her two faces are so different though. that's much better than when a head has a "scared" and a "more scared" face. the "c" build enough with the basics; let's build. i'm going to review them in the same order i built them, backwards. since you can tell immediately looking at the 3 designs that they're going to use different numbers of pieces and so forth, i figured i'd build the smallest first lest it seem like a letdown. all three have some basic similarities - the two plates are hinged to give a building that opens for play. they also do have interiors, which you can see starting to form here. the "c" build, front it's a pretty quick build, so it's done already. here's the front of the building with it opened up. like this, it appears to be two separate stores, a newsstand and some sort of shop you can enter. all the printed tiles help give the newsstand a detailed appearance, but i'm not sure why they've got a $100 bill lying on the ledge... the "c" build, rear from the back side, the interiors are pretty plain. the shop half has a plant in a jar and a weird chair, and the newsstand just has a register. the "c" build, sides here's the two sides of the folded building. on the hinge side, there's a bunch of windows in a disjointed wall with random colors. on the other, why did they put in a huge window when the set does include a trans-clear door that could have gone there? and you get a small patch of plants, like so many sets seem to have these days. the "c" build, extras that's a lot of leftovers there. and not just little stuff - multiple doors, stairs, etc. and unused sand green is always a little sad.... the "b" build, 1 a pretty similar start, with the hinge and little garden and some tiles along the ground. the "b" build, 2 now we see a big windowed wall, some details like lights, and how it has the usual alternate model "weird part usage" - like a 1x4 brick with side studs being used over the doorway, even though those side studs will not get used. the "b" build, front the finished building gives us a nice little post office, with a letter-carrying bird on the roof. hope that's not their normal method of delivery! something about the colors just doesn't work for me though. the combo of white / light grey / dark grey / black / sand green plus tan is just too much. the tan window and door frames i don't like. the "b" build, inside on the inside, things are weird. the counter on the left is ok, but the light above the door (with a yellow clip? ugly!) is too big, and everything else over there by the door doesn't make much sense either. the "b" build, sides i like the front side here, except the colors are still too much. the bench, greenery, mailbox on the corner, and streetlight are all nice. the boy is a little creepy though - binoculars in hand plus a telescope on the roof of the post office? why? the hinge side shows more of the weird colors you get in the wall, but that's going to be hidden when the set is open. plus we even see that on big modulars at times, so it's not so terrible. the "b" build, leftovers again, a lot of leftover parts. it's obvious this was another alternate, but it'd be nice to see more of them used to make a bigger building. but let's move on to the model that does use them all... the "a" build, 1 the first half starts like this. maybe it's just my bias, but it already feels like a more detailed build. bottles on the wall, the yellow and red awning over the window, etc. the "a" build, 2 the other half starts off with detailed work too. i think that's a red vending machine. the stairs are also very solidly built. i also appreciate the effort to get that diagonal base where a door will be - it's such a nice touch to have sections of a building that aren't right angles. the "a" build, 3 not too much has been added, but i wanted to showcase the tiny toys before they get hidden by a wall. that robot and train are just fantastic little micro builds. the "a" build, 4 things are coming together quickly. the walls, windows, and doors get the first floor nearly done. i'm still not big on the sand green and tan combo, but i do really like the red and yellow awnings. the "a" build, 5 it appears the shop owner lives upstairs, since we've got a bedroom forming here. the bed is a little plain, but the table and lamp on the other half are great. and my big fingers did not like putting all those railings on the balcony, with the telescope posts and tile tops. knocked quite a few off before i got them all done. the "a" build, front and it's done. all the details make this set really feel like a mini-modular. the roofline has great greebling, and the shop contents, and on and on. it's not perfect though. the tiny car above the toy store door isn't nearly as good as the toys inside. and the kid's yellow scooter? the wheels aren't even on the ground, much less able to roll. the scooter looks decent though, so that counts for something. well, at least as long as you are at this angle, since the boy's only got 1 foot on the 1 stud wide scooter. the "a" build, inside most of the interior has been seen already. the roof though does a nice job of being interesting for a roof. a skylight, the edge rails, etc. and you can see there's not much "wrong color" in the walls. the "a" model, sides an interesting building when folded up. very tall and skinny. you can tell it's not really meant to be displayed this way - it's meant to be open. the good - lots! i like the awning, the diagonal door, the flowerbox under the upper window, the folding gate on the balcony that lets it be used in open or closed mode, and the green / white / blue colors. the bad - well, the stairs end short of the upper door, i still don't really like the tan doorframes (i think black would have been better), and why don't the upper floors match up in size? the "a" model, leftovers ah, that's more like it. just a few small pieces left as spares. the errors you might have to click through to the full-size versions, but i did catch a few weird errors in the manuals. first, in the photo of the newsstand, the map in the front corner is on there sideways. the map does have a clear north arrow printed on it. on the second image, the boy's feet are hanging off the edge. just unusual to see an alignment error in the manual like that. the comparison here are this set and the modular detective office side by side. there's a huge difference - as you'd expect. but is the difference more than you'd expect? this set is 466 parts, $40. the do is 2262 pieces and $160. 5 times the parts, 4 times the price. looking at them side by side, i'd expect a bigger difference in both. the conclusion so, what's my conclusion on this model? i love the main model, but the alternates are meh. it's a nice set for someone looking for a town building other than police and fire stations, but who isn't ready to move to the modular line. compared to the modulars though, it seems overpriced. part of that is because the huge modulars are actually a great deal compared to other lego sets. i'm also a little surprised that it's so small, when you compare it to the city sets like a police station. those are generally designed with much more open space, letting them be more of a playset. this one is small and cramped, so it'd be tougher to play in. it's not really a city set though. the ratings value: 7/10 - it's under the 10 cents a part mark, but that's largely due to having a ton of tiny parts. all those flowers and decorative 1x1 round studs add up quickly! design: 7/10 - good and bad on the colors, and there's a big difference between the quality of the main vs alternate models. having so many leftover pieces is one thing when the creator set makes 3 very different models (ie a boat, plane, and truck). when it's 3 buildings, it seems wasteful to have so many parts leftover. minifigs: 6/10 - i'm not sure they both fit the set. i suppose the boy is going to the toy store and the woman is going to the grocery? but there's no storekeeper in either. the woman doesn't look like a storekeeper to me, so that's why i assume she's another shopper. i love the boy, but the woman is just so-so - except that i do appreciate the head having two very different expressions. but again, that doesn't fit the set. i can't see her scared face being used. playability: 6/10 - the shops are detailed with registers and so forth, but it's all so tiny it'd be hard to play with the figs in it. parts: 9/10 - tons of windows and doors, plus nice sand green bricks. but some things (the large blue curves used on the roof for example) are weirdly specialized and would be hard to use in another building design. overall: 7/10 - i'd recommend doing what i did - build the alternates first, then the main since that's how you'll want to leave it. i'd really like to see the price a little lower compared to other sets (again, the part count is inflated due to so many tiny parts) and the finished building is tiny, but it's loaded with neat details.
nice review mostlytechnic. i particularly like the use of grey background surface for the pictures. it somehow makes the building stand out more. good job!
stevkir, on 04 may 2015 - 08:06 am, said: any chance you have a picture of the news stand next to the detectives office building as i would love to see the scaling for that? sorry, i do not - but it'd be tiny and not look like the same scale. johnny6666, on 04 may 2015 - 09:59 am, said: it feels like a mishmash of bricks with no clear design aesthetic and as such blatantly underdeveloped (i.e. designed to hit a price/brick count point rather than provide a solid set in the creator town tradition). compared to other creator sets at this price point (31025 - mountain hut, for example) it feels utterly uninspired and ugly. well, i felt like the main model almost got to good looking :) i'd replace some of the tan with black, but otherwise i'm ok with that one.
thanks 'mostlytechnic' for this review, i only brought this set to continue the shop series from creator. in my opinion it's only half as good as the bike shop/cafe one. plus it doesn't fit the same as that pair of shops, oh well maybe next year lego creator will have a better one. brick on review on 'mostlytechnic' !
reviews for this set really should picture them next to the bike shop & cafe, which it's intended to be compatible with right down to the size of the baseplates and grey tiles around the edge. it doesn't look that great on its own, but if you add the two sets together you get something that begins to look like a street scene.

i've never been fond of these sets, but still buy them every year because my daughters like them. i am, however, looking forward to the belville advent calendar, which likely will have some parts that usually are quite hard to get in it. my girls will love it, and i love all the belville parts. http://shop.lego.com/product/?p=7600 if anyone has pics of what is contained in this set i would love to see them.
thanks andy for the review! i prefer the city advent calendar 2006 a lot! those mini sets are nor good for me! the "road subtheme" sets are nice, but the others, not so good! the 05 version waf ok, the 06 version was better, with bigger sets, and more building ones! and the 07 is poor! it's just 2-3 pieces to put together on 2x4 plates... where are the gardening accessories? where are some nice small constructions that you can put in your layout like a mailbox or an orodator? and the chrismas tree looks :-x imo! and no santa... *y* for andy *n* for this calendar
xwingyoda, on sep 13 2007, 06:57 pm, said: ohh tks for the news 8-? it really looks interesting, belville always have great parts in cool colours !! excellent indeed !! *yoda* wow, interesting! lego is really expanding with this advent calendar thing! watch, next year they'll have ones for specific themes, boy o boy, think about it, star wars advent calendar, indy advent claendar. of course, this is only speculation, but it would be cool! x-d i'll probably buy both of these (even though i'm a boy ;-) ) so i get 2 surprises every day instead of one! :-p ;-)
i'm a big fan of anime and have watched some mechas like full metal panic, neon evangelion: genesis (it is a mecha!) and chobits (well... she is a robot...), so i was curious to see what this new exo force line was all about. the colorful sets and manga-like characters didn't persuade me right away, but the urgent need for a couple of white 3x3 wing plates made me purchase this little thing. it cost me 70 dkr as you can see on the box. this is 9.30 euro, or about the same an american has to pay for the new republic cruiser. pretty expensive for so few pieces (90 + a spare technic pin) the box an action-packed box with one of the sides being oddly empty except from the lego-logo. what's inside there is a small building instruction, two polybags (no bag building here) and a sticker sheet with alarmingly many stickers. the build it takes so little time to build this set that i didn't get to take any pictures of the process. every step was accompanied by an element description although i doubt most of you will need that with so few pieces to keep track on. most of the dark green bricks have a sticker - even the slopes where the rough surface makes stickers fall off easily! there should also have been a sticker on the windshield, but i wanted to keep that piece clean for better usage later. (i'm one of those who keeps stickers on the bricks) the model you want to see this model from the front, as the back is pretty much neglected there isn't much for the pilot to grab a hold on either. he is pretty much a sitting duck up there with the screen giving him only partial cover. there is a huge wrench next to him which kind of symbolizes the crudeness of the mech. the set isn't called "cyclone defender" for nothing. the right arm might hold an ordinary light assault riffle, but the other has a spinning disc with samurai swords which you can turn with the yellow knob on the backside. those of you who have seen robot wars might remember the incredible power of this melee weapon from a robot named hypnodisc. it would have been nice had there been a pull-back motor to power the disc (i'm sure lego has a lot of these in stock), but the simple mechanism still works reasonably well. the riffle comes off and a pin makes it easy to hold with the hand, but the disc is fixed to the arm. it is also a problem that the swords get misaligned quickly during play. the minifig i really like this minifig because of the neat idea with an expression on each side that lego has made a standard for exo force. posability most mech-moc'ers show off their creations using gundam-like poses. with two joints per leg (one being the ankles) and one for an arm i thought of some less serious poses: crawling (silent like a ninja!): belly gliding: kick off!; upside down: final rating i have to disappoint you here. this is my first set in this line and i have absolutely no idea of how good it is. the last robot i bought was the awesome 6889 spyrius recon robot for the same price, but it is in a completely different genre. the set had what i expected (two white wings) and is as such a no-nonsense set. i guess it would be of more use if you have some more exo force, which i don't. 6/10 ups: has great minifig, weapons and is easy to build. downs: crude design and a bit too expensive for what you get. (brickshelf gallery)
nice review :) but... you paid how much? this set is priced around 7 euros here in germany, which is a very fair price for what you get in my oppinion. it?s a little disappointing though, that i couldn?t think of any alternate builds for this set, and there are no inspirations on the box or the ef website.
i was going to buy one of these but decided not to. i am glad now seeing the rather annoying construction. the minifig is good though, thanks for the review! :-) batbrick away! >:-) edited by batbrick, 17 september 2007 - 07:29 am.
i have 2 of these guys. :-d it's awesome, only cost me 13 bucks nz, for a comparison, the castle crossbow attack set costs $10 nz. for the win! did i read this wrong? you paid about the same price as the republic cruiser??! the republic cruiser costs $200 nz, and the cyclone defencer costs $13. i must have read that wrong... *wacko*
thanks! i was planning on doing this review but i have been a bit swamped lately. :-$ great review of a great set. it isn't too hard to convert the plane to mini-fig size either. (sorry i forgot to take photos...) i might add some photos to your review....
nice review and a nice set. thanks for taking the time. i'll want to pick this guy up.
hovercraft alternate model. uses around 4/5th of the parts. it is cool but a bit fragile.

?34.99 is not too shabby. the big guy itself is nice, but the gem of the set is the mech. really nice mech i must say! great for posing. the mini figs suprisingly nice little build/vehicle. never seen this element before....its probably nothing new though, lol. no articulation of the legs? nooooooo! phew! the front two legs do articulate. would of been bad if they didnt. overall, i give the set 7.8/10. not the best, but its actually quite nice, and the yellow mech is awesome. if it was him on his own, then 9.4/10! cheers
thanks for the review! i really dislike this set but i thought much worse of it when we saw the first pic. i think it was a good idea (mech transporter) pursued in a horribly wrong way! :-x thanks again! :-) batbrick away! >:-)

consider the first pic a freeby pic, to whet your appetite. :-$ 8-? :'-)
that yellow mech would make a killer $10 set! i would buy it on its own... *wub*
i got a set of this but i planning to sell away to earn money to buy another set since im almost broke right now. :-d i got a set of this but i planning to sell away to earn money to buy another set since im almost broke right now. :-d

it is no secret that marvel is one of the most successful companies right now. from the avengers to the x-men and down to even the most obscure characters like ant-man, every one of their movies has been a big hit until now. the latest marvel movie, fant4stic, was released last month and while i have not seen it yet, i'm sure it's just as great as their other movies. i mean, it has the word "fantastic" in the title after all! and being the smart business that they are, the lego company decided to get in on the hype early and capitalize on this movie's undoubtful success two years in advance by making a set featuring fant4stic's main villain, dr. doom. now that's what i call forward thinking! but did they do a good job with it or were they being overhasty? let's find out! set number: 76005 name: spider-man: daily bugle showdown theme: marvel super heroes subtheme: ultimate spider-man year of release: 2013 pieces: 476 minifigs: 5 price: $49.99 usd s@h description: quote swing into the daily bugle and stop dr. doom™! dr. doom™ and his henchman beetle™ are attacking the daily bugle in their speedy jet to steal spider-man's™ secret identity. it's up to spider-man™ and nova™ to swing in and stop them! trigger the daily bugle's explosion functions to cause destruction as the jet fires missiles! stop dr. doom™ from hitching the jet's anchor hook to the safe with spider-man's secret inside! knock beetle™ off the building with the swinging web attack and drop dr. doom™ inside with the rooftop trapdoor! then fly nova™ in through the broken window with the dumpster catapult function and send those villains back to where they came from. includes spider-man™, nova™, dr. doom™, beetle™ and j. jonah jameson™ with accessories and weapons. the first thing that comes to mind after reading this description is: wow, that's a lot of tms! anyway, here are some resource links for this set: brickset bricklink rebrickable the box since this set is based on the ultimate spider-man cartoon, the box has the usual usm design with the red marvel super heroes background, an illustration of spidey in the upper right corner, and the usm logo in the lower right. as usual, there is a minifig line up in the lower left, and since this was before the terrible redesign, you can see the full body of the minifigs. i really miss this type of line up. there is quite a lot going on here: doctor doom attacking the daily bugle in his jet while simultaneously reaching for j. jonah jameson below with his jet's claw, spider-man (reluctantly) swings in to save him, while nova fights off the beetle. it's a pretty cool scene, even though it's not very accurate to the show. in "beetle mania", the episode that this set is based on, the beetle was indeed out to kill jjj, but it was in order to stop him from exposing his identity, not spider-man's (although spidey was next on jjj's list). and while he is a recurring villain on the show, doctor doom had nothing to do with this plot and didn't even appear in the episode aside from a brief cameo. it's awesome that they included him anyway, though, so i'm not gonna complain. note that the tower is so tall that it wraps around the top of the box. there, you can also see a scale reference with the spider-man minifig. on the back of the box, you can see the interior of the bugle and all of its play features which there are quite a few of since this is a playset. it's all illustrated pretty well, although lego's choice of sound effects is still a mystery to me. i don't get why they don't go for spider-man's signature "fwip!" instead of "fazzing!" and i didn't know that a breaking window made the sound "btoom!" but i digress. contents inside the box you will find three instruction booklets (one smaller than the others), a comic book, a fairly large sticker sheet, five numbered bags, and two loose pieces: a white string piece and a gray 16x8 plate. there aren't really any notable pieces and nobody cares about the comic bock (no offense to the artist), so lets get right to the instructions. they are pretty straight forward and easy to follow. some of the pages have a ghostly image of spidey, nova, and dr. doom in the top right corner which is fitting since these are all minifigs that appear in this set (which is strangely not something that can be said for many other super heroes instructions with this type of artwork). minifigures as with most super heroes sets, most people will get this set mainly for the minifigs, so without further ado, let's talk about them. spider-man is the same old bootless one you get in almost every usm set. not much to say about him. some might complain that we don't get spidey's alter ego peter parker in this set, but in the usm cartoon, mj is actually the one who works at the daily bugle, not peter. curse the creators of this cartoon for ruining our chances of getting a new peter parker minifig by trying to mix things up. next we get j. jonah jameson. he appeared in a spider-man 2 set before, but this is a complete redesign. he now has a blue suit with a red tie, a unique face print, and that combed-back hair in dark gray. this new hairpiece doesn't suit him at all and the old flat top hair was perfect for him in my opinion, so i don't know why they changed it. the good thing about this change, however, is the fact that this piece is exclusive to this set in that color. nova on the other hand is spot-on. he comes with a new helmet mold and some nice torso printing. however, he, too, is missing his boots. tlc should have started making dual-colored legs a long time ago. here are some reference images to compare them to. okay, so jjj's hair may not be completely black in the show, but i still think they should have given his minifig a black hairpiece. his suit is also not quite the right color. he rarely appears in person in the show (including the episode this set is based on) and is usually seen on screens around new york, so this is the best picture of him i could find. i guess i should be happy they included a minifig of him at all. in the episode, it was actually mary jane who was at the bugle during beetle's attack, so it would have made more sense to include her, but we got her in the spider-copter set one year later, so that's ok. all three of them have back printing. in jjj's case i'm using that term loosely since it is only comprised of two lines, but it's nice that they went through the trouble of adding them. both jjj and nova come with angry alternate faces. it almost looks like they're trying to out-angry each other. who do you think looks angrier? let me know in the comments section below. now let's talk about the bad guys. even though he would be better off in a fantastic four set, it's great to finally get victor van doom, one of the greatest marvel villains ever and in comics in general. he comes with a dark green hood which was new and exclusive in that color at the time, and he is the only minifig in this set that has leg printing. beetle is a regular minifig with wings. the metallic printing on his face and torso is pretty nice, but i wish it would have continued onto his legs as well. the beetle looks quite accurate to his on-screen counterpart. the only thing that could have improved him is a new helmet mold with pointy eyebrows/antennae. doctor doom, however, looks nothing like he does in the movie. i just don't understand how lego could have messed him up so badly. maybe they were working off of early concept art or something. here is a back view of doom and beetle. beetle would be a pretty boring minifig if it wasn't for his wings which are awesome with their holographic texture. they are so mesmerizing, i could look at those things all day. this piece also appeared in trans. light green in the galaxy squad sets which came out at the same time. here they are without their gear. as you can see, they both have back printing as well. and no, doctor doom does not come with an alternate facial expression, which is fine since you can't see much of his expressions due to his mask anyway. here's a look at dr. doom and nova without their headgear. some say that doom's face looks too cartoony, but i think it looks fine. nova is wearing stylish goggles as a way of explaining his white eyes. it's a far better explanation than the bat-sweatband. they did the same thing with the masked wolverine later. here are all the figs with their accessories. jjj comes with a camera so that he can take "more pictures of spider-man!" beetle comes with one of those overused adu guns which is a very poor representation of his wrist-mounted blasters. i hate to say it, but even those bulky new stud shooters would have been a better representation of his weapons. spidey comes with his usual string of webbing and nova comes with some iron man style translucent studs. the weird thing is that they are red while his powers have a blue glow in the show. doctor doom sadly doesn't get any accessories, but who needs weapons when you have a jet with a claw and flick-fire missiles. the build the first bag contains spider-man, a brick separator, and the parts to build the ground floor of the dbc building. after a quick and straight-forward build, you get this. the dumpster and street lamp are separate from the building and since the lamp post is not built onto any baseplate and is quite top-heavy, it gets knocked over pretty easily. maybe it's meant to be that way, but i would have preferred it if you could stick it onto the baseplate of the building on which there is unfortunately not enough space to do so. as you would expect, the second bag has the parts for the first floor of the building. this is also the bag that contains beetle. after another fairly simple build, you'll find yourself with a two story building with a spiderweb one side and a fire escape on the other. however, you have to apply three stickers during this section of the build which is never fun. can you guess what's in bag number 3? yup, the second floor of the building. you don't need superpowers to predict that one. also, this bag contains nova and jameson. the build of this section is a bit repetitive since the second floor is mostly the same as the first and it takes slightly longer to build since you have to build the rooftop as well. also, in addition to the two window stickers you have to apply ten 2x2 tile stickers! trying to do this without having any of them being crooked is a real pain in the megablocks. the next bag contains doctor doom and the cockpit of his jet. doom's cape is in the usual square white box and the string for the claw is folded up in a piece of tape. here's what you get at the end of this section. looks more like an escape pod than a jet at this point. the final bag is the smallest as it only includes the few parts needed to finish the doom jet. once you build the wings and tail, you stick them onto the cockpit via technic pins and you're done. spare parts these are the parts that are left over after the build. there is the brick separator of course, an extra antenna, and the usual little bits and bops. what's really awesome, though, is that they give you an extra pair of beetle's wings! considering what a neat piece this is and that this is the only set in which it comes in trans-black make this a very welcome spare that you can use in your customs. the finished set here is the complete set. the dbc building looks quite tall, especially when you count the antenna. comparing it to a screenshot from the episode, the general look of the building is there, although there are some inaccuracies. aside from the fact that it is obviously way down-scaled, the screens that show jjj ranting about spider-man should have been hexagonal, not square, and should have wrapped around the building. however, considering how many stickers you would have had to apply if they would have made it accurate, i'm actually glad they kept the screen mercifully small. much like doctor doom himself, the doom jet didn't actually appear in the beetle mania episode. however, it did appear in a later episode titled "not a toy" in which spider-man plays around with captain america's shield, accidentally drops it in doctor doom's latvarian embassy and has to try to retrieve it. and yes, that episode was as godawful as it sounds. here's a screenshot of the jet from that episode. like with the dbc, they managed to capture the general shape of the vehicle, although it doesn't look quite as good as in the show. the color scheme is too dark and it looks kind of blockier. let's take a closer look at the jet. there is no real way to reel the claw in unfortunately. however, there is a stud on the back of the jet that you can stick it onto. needless to say, this is not the ideal way of storing it. i would have much preferred it if they would have attached it onto winch instead. the engines on the wings can be turned, even though they don't turn in the show, and there is a flick-fire missile on each side. even if it's not much to look at, at least it's a very swooshable vehicle. on top of each wing there is a tile with the emblem of latvaria. there was no such emplems on the jet in the cartoon, but they are useful pieces that make it clear whose jet it is, so i'm glad they included them. there is nothing inside the cockpit except for a seat and unless you want to ruin dr. doom's nice dark green cape, i wouldn't put him inside of it. they could have at least printed a control panel onto that empty 2x2 tile. play features since this is a playset, let's look at all the play features it has to offer. like all playsets, the building is open in the back so you can play inside. on the ground floor, there is a potted plant and... nothing else. seriously? is this all they could come up with for this floor? they could have included a security desk, a lounge, a second plant, or anything else! as it is, it's just a boring empty lobby. the first floor is a bit more interesting. there is a safe, a swiveling chair, and a pin board with various pictures of spider-man. there is one tile that reads: "the true identity of spider-man" which is supposedly what the villains are after. i wonder how jameson got this information in the first place. speaking of jameson, the second floor is devoted to his office where he can sit and yell at his non-present employees, demanding "more pictures of spider-man!" it also has a swiveling chair as well as a desk with a lamp and a computer. there is a technic beam connecting his desk with the ceiling of the first floor which you can remove in order to take off the upper half of the building, but it's difficult to do, so i don't recommend it. as you may have noticed in the picture above, there are a few red pegs sticking out of the building. these are for triggering the play features. most of them are on the roof. there is one on what looks like an air conditioning unit. if you place spider-man holding is web-string on the jumper plate in front of it and push the peg, spidey goes bungee-jumping off the building. wee! there is also one that sticks out of the side of the building which when pulled triggers a trap door. the third red peg on the roof can be used to pop off the dbc sign. why is it called the dbc, you ask? it stands for daily bugle communications since in this version of spider-man, the daily bugle is not only a newspaper, but a news tv station as well, one that promotes its own highly biased views. so basically the fox news of the marvel universe. i guess if you're an old school spider-man fan, you could just leave off the "c" and have it just stand for daily bugle. the sign above the main entrance wont be so easily modified however. there is also a peg between the first and second floor which when pushed pops out one of the windows on the first floor. the safe is only attached to a couple of jumper plates and has some jumper plates on top of it as well, so you can easily attach the doom jet's claw to it and rip it out of the building as seen on the back of the box. there are also some snot bricks on the corners of the building that you can attach spiderwebs or spidey himself onto for some wall-crawling and webslinging action. this is not so much a play feature as it is just a feature, but as i mentioned earlier, there is a fire escape on the left side of the building. this was a neat idea as it helps it feel like a building in new york city, but it is executed very poorly. there is no hole big enough for the minifigs to climb down through, so they would have to climb down the ladders from the outside which makes no sense. no wonder spider-man always needs to rescue people from burning buildings. there is one more play feature in the form of the dumpster. you can open the lid, put a minifig inside, and make them jump by hitting a tab in the back. remember, this is before the introduction of super jumpers, but nevertheless it's a pretty strange place to launch minifigs out of. i guess even super heroes like to do some dumpster diving. you don't think this was funny? no? well, me neither, but that's the type of humor that this show loves to use. sigh. anyway, let's get on to the ratings. ratings design: 2/5 - the set looks ok. despite many inaccuracies, the dbc building and the jet somewhat resemble their on-screen counterparts and don't look too bad, but they definitely could be better. build: 1/5 - a mostly unchallenging and repetitive build with an attrocious amount of stickers. minifigs: 4/5 - definitely the strongest point of the set. some of the figs could be better, but four out of five of them are exclusive to this set. doctor doom is easily the best and probably the most desirable one - unless the fant4stic movie portraits him so badly that nobody will be interested in him, but that's impossible. playability: 4/5 - as you would expect from a playset, the playability is quite high, although i still feel like there could have been more. parts: 3/5 - not many rare parts. if you're looking for parts for building your own skyscraper with tan walls and lots of doors and windows though, this set is for you. price: 3/5 - at 476 parts for $50, this set is a bit pricey, but it is somewhat justified by all the large window and wall pieces. overall: 3/5 - this set is mediocre at best. playsets are always a good choice for spider-man sets since they give spidey something to swing from, but unfortunately they are rarely pulled off well. the jet is blocky, the building is bare-bones, and the price feels too high. the only reason to get this set are the four exclusive minifigs. this set was discontinued early this year, but if you still see it on clearance somewhere, go ahead and get one for the minifigs and parts, or buy multiples and use the parts to build a better dbc building. i hope you enjoyed this review. it is part of the reviewers academy's 7th anniversary. we're not doing a big celebration this year due to other commitments, but look out for more reviews with the 7th anniversary banner soon. now, if you'll excuse me, i am off to see fant4stic. i hope it's as fantastic as it promises to be! (2 hours later) i was wrong! i was horribly, horribly wrong!
hahah, entertaining and informative, a great read- thanks for the review! on a side note i thought fant-four-stic was....ok. on the poorer side of ok. the exposition felt like it was from a 3 hour film because it was so long and towards the middle it started to drag. the ending was terrible. edited by mutant orc, 12 september 2015 - 09:53 pm.
this is my favourite set! should be making more spidey sets like this imo. *cough* oscorp tower *cough*
thanks for the review, i've had that set for quite a while, and it's among my favorite marvel superheroes sets actually. compared to the other stuff we usually get to accompany the minifigs... all those "laboratorys", the most recent construction site, and the "hydra fortress" .. yeah... you're being a little harsh here maybe you're still suffering from ptsd after watching fant-four-stic!

thanks for the review.i'm not a big fan of spider man sets, but this set really impressed me. this must because of the design of this set and the minifigures that included in this set.
i think i'm the only person in the world who likes fant4stic... was it the best superhero movie? not even close, but i didn't think it deserved the hate it got. it was just incredibly and clumsily mishandled. anyways, great review. i might pick this one up if only for the beetle fig.
thanks copmike! dr. s.
beautiful indeedily, and these magnets?ll allow at least a quick change of heads and probably some nice poseability.... *wub*
got some info about my boba maquette yesterday >:-(: quote dear mikael , due to an unexpected delay by the vendor, the scheduled shipping date of the following pre-order item(s) has changed, the new ship date is as follows: swlfllmbf exclusive lego star wars boba fett maquette ships jan 2008 well, i only ordered it ........... - feb 17 2007 |-/!!! sucks bigtime on copmike
good idea to make this review while you build the set. i'll be monitoring your progress and feedback. the box so huge! impressive!
nice review. i'll be watching and waiting for the rest.
tks for that comparison pic dunamis ;-) ok the box is big !! i pictured it a tad smaller though !! i know what i don't like, its the fact that it has the regular lego star wars logo on top with vader. ucs sets should have a different iconography like they did in the past. sure its a trivial detail but it adds to the fact of owning something special !! after all its the most expensive set ever as of now ;-) happy building !! and we'll wait patiently for some cool pics later on :-p *yoda*
wow i never thought i'd be impressed by a box but i certainly am now. any chance of seeing all 5000 bricks in a big pile? vader, on sep 28 2007, 10:14 am, said: my gawd that manuel is huge!!!!! that's enough to put a sane man off of buying this set.......thank gawd none of us are sane thats all i can say x-d too true, never had i imagined thinking about buying a ?350 lego set before....christmas is soo close yet soo far.
good review. *y* me, i can't build it before saturday. :'-(
great review so far! i am looking forward to additional posts! as for the number of pins - from the peeron inventory for the set, there are over 400 technic pins of various lengths! (insert the "my fingers hurt from building" emoticon) keep the pictures coming!
the minifigs: as you can see, the minifigs are really nice. they even throw in an extra fleshie head! no doubt these will fetch quite a bit on the bricklink and ebay markets. i?m keeping mine. continuing the build this photo shows how well this model is put together. notice that they use four of the three-hole beams per side to hold this together. i remember reading that you can hang this model from the ceiling. i don?t doubt it. these right angle technic pieces are used to reinforce the structure of the model. you can see them used here: i was shocked at how many light gray plates are in this set. i have two tubs full of these: the infrastructure is now complete: i got hung up for about an hour looking for one of these: turns out, lego gave me an extra left wedge and shorted me a right wedge. so frustrating! i had to stead one off my 6211 star destroyer. it is not a very common piece by the way?
thanks for this review sinner! i love this house, with the nicely made tiled corners, the colorscheme and the garage. the only thing i dislike about this set is the way the windows are attached in train windows (so they turn inwards a little) instead of the usual frames with shutter-attachment-ability. but that is something that can be fixed in the blink of an eye. i will certainly buy this house some day when i find it at reasonable price.
thanks for the thanks guys! *sweet* hinckley39, on sep 28 2007, 11:08 am, said: great job, now sort that out and start building for our competition! x-d i started building today! *sweet* matthewusa, on sep 28 2007, 03:56 pm, said: i can't believe tlc skimped on the floors. it didn't bother me as i downloaded the instructions prior to buying the set. i think it was a deliberate choice to make the house flashy looking but not very functional. due to the cool looking corners it isn't very strong either; while breaking it i was reminded of a zip! :-p simonwillems, on sep 28 2007, 06:53 pm, said: the only thing i dislike about this set is the way the windows are attached in train windows (so they turn inwards a little) instead of the usual frames with shutter-attachment-ability. these were my first windows like that and it surprised me. i wouldn't be surprised if lego are trying to phase out the old windows. holodoc, on sep 28 2007, 07:58 pm, said: thanks for the review sinner! *y* ... although we had a not very detailed one already... :-p i notice that, but since didn't show what the original set looked like i saw that more of a moc. 8-| holodoc, on sep 28 2007, 07:58 pm, said: you get tons of useful parts to build other buildings as well. [shameless self-promotion /off] ;-) i was actually considering adding a link to your moc anyway. thanks! :-p paul_delahaye, on sep 29 2007, 07:38 am, said: i too have bought this set and the only thing i notice which is a bit odd, with the exception of there being no floors in the house is the lack of a steering wheel in the car! once again, i think this is just a sign of all style, no substance! :-d paulc, on sep 29 2007, 05:19 pm, said: the mixed rough and smooth roof bricks would annoy me on a model like the mtt, but here it looks as is if the roof is quite old with some parts being worn and pitted and some parts being replaced with new roof tiles. i quite like the effect. fair point. what confuses me though is the (cg) cover has the rough ones shown... :-|
writing a decent review will indeed take some time. but you don't need to do it in a single session. if "each time" is 4/5 hours, you can write a review in 2 x "each time"
wow thanks for the review! 8-? i already have the other two set (theyre fantastic *wub* ) and i know ill be getting this one soon! dp8
a very nice review with good, although perhaps a little too big, pictures.... *y* now i realized that this catapult?s able to swivel, that?s neat, thank you! x-d
that was a fun review, i picked up a couple of these on holiday in france and it was one of the main reasons i went all-out and bought the rest of the castle range! dr. s.
so far of this line i have 7009 and 7090 you have now convinced me to get this one also nice review btw i think the name for it is mace
great review grevious!! *sweet* *y* nice job, thanks for sharing. great comic and i especially love that you gave us an alternative model, something lego neglects to do anymore... |-/ thanks again! *wub*
thanks for the review, the comic was great! :-d your alternate model is great as well, i would never have thought of building a ship out of a catapult! :-p
thanks everyone for all the comments! ;-) my next review is most likely going to be the toa mahri i bought a long time ago; i also typed up a review for her but haven't bothered posting it! ah well, i'll get it up eventually.... x-d edit: gah! i just realized how many posts i had! better post something else on the boards quickly.... :-p edited by grevious, 11 october 2007 - 08:45 pm.
lol what a review!!! i love the story ^_^
sinner, on oct 13 2007, 02:48 am, said: great review! *sweet* i wasn't aware that the catapult rotated either... this set isn't on my buy list though as it is all more of the same for me. thanks for the cool moc! :-d i always plan to add a moc to my reviews but i always run out of time.... :'-( true, there are too many catapults already, and in my opinion some with a better design as well. but my lack of interest in this particular set doesn't reflect at all on my opinion of this review, which i enjoyed very much! please continue making great reviews like this one grevious. *y*
it's that time of year again when the days get shorter, the nights get colder, and children all around the world stare longingly into warmly lit toy shops and prepare their wishlist to send to santa. this is also the time when the lego group releases their latest winter village set which has been an annual tradition for the past seven years. these sets have been very popular, especially among afols, and are always highly anticipated. however, while some entries in this series have been more popular than others, none has been as controversial as this year's set, the winter toy shop, which is a re-release of the first winter village set, 10199 winter toy shop from 2009. it seems that many think that this set didn't need to be remade and would have preferred a new set instead, or that it is not different enough from the original and will be redundant in a completionist's collection. does it deserve all the hate? let's find out. disclaimer: i don't own the 2009 version, so i can't compare them visually, but i will do my best to let you know what is different in this version. if you do need a visual reference, you can refer to svelte's excellent review of the original. set number: 10249 name: winter toy shop theme: creator year of release: 2015 pieces: 898 minifigs: 8 price: £59.99 / $79.99 / 69.99€ s@h description: quote welcome to the winter toy shop! the holiday season has arrived and the toymaker is busy finishing off his latest creations! outside, children ski and snowboard, and a freshly built snowman sparkles in the light that shines from the toyshop tower. help decorate the huge tree that stands at the center of the square, play with the curious kitten on the cozy wooden bench or join in with the carolers beneath the ornate streetlamp. this charming set also features a ladder, trees in various sizes, jack-in-the-box, a toy biplane, helicopter, rocket, train, race car, truck, robot, tugboat, teddy bear and a wrapped gift. have fun building this enchanting winter wonderland! includes a snowman and 8 minifigures with assorted accessories: a male caroler, female caroler, a woman, 2 men, 2 boys and a girl. s@h bricklink brickset the box the box art of this set is similar to that of the original, but there are some notable differences. the christmas tree is on the right side of the image this time while the park bench is on the left and of course it features this year's design for creator boxes with the dark blue stripe along the right side and the "expert" logo in the top right corner. there's also a small picture of the back of the toy shop and the background looks less cartoony than on the original. the back is also very similar, showing a different angle of the toy shop along with some close-ups, although this time there is no minifig lineup. instead, the minifig lineup is on the right side of the box. it also includes the accessories that each minifig comes with and some of the toys. on the left side of the box there is a thumbnail of the box art and the set name in six different languages. they also want to make sure that you know that there are batteries included by saying it in dozens of languages. the top of the box features the inventory and a 1:1 scale reference with the female caroler. on the bottom there is a picture that reminds you that there is a light brick included in this set, in case that wasn't clear from the front of the box, and it confirms that yes, it is a bad idea to put it in water, in case you were planning to go swimming with your winter toy shop. the contents inside the box there are two instruction booklets and two groups of bags, one for each instruction booklet. while two groups of bags is not as many as there usually are in other sets of this size, it's still better than the first version of this set where the bags weren't numbered at all, so this makes the build a bit easier. the large bag in group 1 and the two large bags in group 2 have a white stripe going down the middle of the bag and only have one group number printed on it along with some other number and some kind of scan code. i have no idea why they made this distinction for these bags or what that code is for, so if any of you know the purpose of this, please let me know in the comments below. here is a random instructions page. as you can see, the building steps can get quite challenging as they sometimes include many different pieces in one step, especially when it uses a lot of brown pieces which are very dark and hard to see in the instructions, living up to the set's status as an expert-level set. most of the time, though, the instructions are pretty clear and easy enough to follow. there are some parts in new colors in this set that weren't in the first version or any other set until now, such as that large, flat technic arch in dark green, the jester hat in orange and blue, one of those new 2z2 round jumper tiles in brown, a golden frog(!), and a snowboard in dark blue. there are also some rare friends parts that make their creator debut here such as the skis in azure and that new clear 1x1 round tile with a tiny tube coming out of it which is usually used as a stand for friends accessories and is a very useful piece, especially for snot techniques (and no, i'm not talking about the type of snot that many people usually have stuck in their nose around this time of year). there are some printed parts as well, such as the clock tile, the letter tile, and the register slope like in the first version of the set. we also get a new face print for the white cat which is more in line with other modern cat designs. but the best part is the shop sign which is printed this time around. it features a lovely wood pattern, the words "toy shop", and a toy soldier on both sides of the sign. which is ironic since the shop doesn't seem to sell any toy soldiers like this, but it looks so good on the sign that i won't sue them for false advertising. the minifigs let's start with the most unique figures in this set, the carolers. these two were also the highlight in the first version of the set, but in the original they both had the same head (this one -> ) which featured a very questionable facial expression that could easily be taken out of context. in this version, they have unique faces which look much better and help distinguish their gender. the male caroler uses lord vampyre's torso which looks quite snazzy on him. maybe this is lord vampyre before he became a vampire? the female caroler is easily the best minifig in the set, though, because in addition to her exclusive head, she also gets an exclusive torso and skirt print! a huge improvement over the generic unprinted one in the original. she also gets the queen hair in dark brown and aragorn's lined cape instead of two combined regular capes. this set truly is the return of the queen! the snowman is technically not a minifig, but as you can see here, he is exactly as tall as one and he is the first thing you build after the minifigs, so i included him here. he has mostly the same design as before, except this time he has robot claws for arms instead of levers. which is good since they allow him to hold accessories such as his broom. his carrot nose is included separately again. the carolers both have back printing while the snowman looks no different from the back than he does from the front. here you can see the black side of the female's cape. this lined cape is so much nicer than the solution they used in the original. next up we have what i assume is a married couple who are likely the parents of at least one of the kids, as well as the toymaker who i will call geppetto. the man in the pinstripe suit was not included in the first version of the set, so he's a bonus minifig! these guys are fairly generic, but they have some detailed torso prints, so they look pretty nice. geppetto seems to have gotten younger since the release of the original set since his gray hair has now turned dark tan and he doesn't seem to need glasses anymore. the men both have back printing, but the woman is the only one in this set who doesn't get a back print. why you gotta be so discriminating against women, lego?! last but not least, there are the kids. one of the boys wears dark blue pants, a green jacket, and a wool cap. he looks a bit like a lumberjack, so let's call him lumberjack boy, or jack for short. the little girl wears an outfit that wouldn't look out of place in the friends theme with a lavender scarf and pants. i'll call her lavender. the second boy is wearing an octan jacket and a sports helmet which makes it ironic that he is the one not doing any winter sports on the box art. i'll call him president business junior, or pbj for short. all of the kids have fairly detailed back printing which makes up for the fact that much like the adults, they are made out of mostly common parts. pbj's helmet and scarf cover up the back of his head nicely which is important as you will see in the next picture. what's also great about these figs is that half of them have a double-sided head. here you can see pbj doing his best macaulay culkin impression. i also removed his scarf so you can see the printing on his torso better. but he's not the only one who seems to be easily scared. the mother also has a very alarmed expression. maybe she got surprised by the jack-in-the-box or maybe she just realized how expensive toys are nowadays. you can see the female caroler's back printing here. her alternate expression is a non-singing face which is very nice to have and i wish the male caroler could have one too. she looks quite cute with those rosy cheeks. but the most adorable out of all of them has to be the little girl. she comes with a pouting sad face that will melt your heart. please, don't cry! i'll buy you any toy you want, just stop looking at me like that! the build the first half of the build is dedicated to the surroundings of the toy shop. it includes the christmas tree, the park bench, the snowman, the toys, the carolers, jack and lavender. the large bag contains two smaller bags with small pieces, a white box that contains the caroler's cape, and the jester hat in its own little bag. the first thing you build after the minifigs and the snowman is the toys. this version of the set has a lot more toys than the original which is good because i always felt that the first toy shop was a bit light on toys. also, the ones that were in the original have been updated. for example, instead of the two pairs of skis, you now get one pair of skis that use the new ski mold and a snowboard. the jack-in-the-box is mostly the same, except it now has an orange and blue color scheme instead of the red and blue from the original. this change was probably not necessary, but hey, at least we get a new jester hat out of it. and instead of the brick-built teddy bear you get the new teddy bear mold. i have mixed feelings about this change because i actually kinda liked the brick-built teddy design and using a specialized mold seems to be going against the spirit of creator sets, but on the other hand i can't deny that the molded teddy looks better than the blocky old one. meh. the new toys include a tugboat which has some rounded technic pieces as its hull, a biplane, a rocket, a helicopter, and a truck that cleverly uses roller skates for its wheels. these are all quite brilliant designs that feel like micro versions of lego city sets and make a great addition to the set. here is a back view of some of the more complex models. as you can see, the friends accessory stand has been cleverly used to hold the biplane's fin in place and to provide a stand for the helicopter. the jack-in-the-box has a hinged lid. the only thing that bugs me a bit is the t-piece on top of the helicopter that holds the rotor in place, but i can't think of any better way they could have done it. next is the ladder that is used to decorate the tree which is exactly the same as the first version. the supports are on a click-hinge, so they can be adjusted or folded away. then, you build the tree itself. you begins, of course, with the stand which is mostly the same design as before, but this time the plates at the bottom are brown instead of white and have golden studs as feet. next, you build the first layer of branches. the main difference in this version of the tree is that this one actually has a brown stem rather than just a technic axle on which you stack the layers of branches one by one. you wont be able to see the stem in the final result, but i like this change as it makes the tree more realistic. then you add the second layer of branches. this one doesn't have lights/candles and attaches to the lower layer at an angle using the four trans-yellow studs close to the stem. the third layer is added. this one has lights again. each layer is similar in that they are all made out of green plates that are built around a 4x4 ring plate, but they get smaller each time and are constructed differently enough for the build not to feel repetitive. with the addition of the fourth layer, we get close to finishing the tree. lastly, you add one more layer and the tip of the tree. now it's time to decorate the tree! however, it's not as fun as it sounds since that requires you to add lights to the two chains/ropes first which can get a bit repetitive. the clips holding the lights to the chain were white, but this time they're pearl gold which looks much nicer in my opinion. the next part of the build is the park bench with the streetlamp and the little tree. this is a fairly quick build with not much to it. the fishbowl helmet parts are a useful piece that you don't see too often, so it's nice to get them again in this remake. the design is pretty much the same as in the original set except for the wreaths on the streetlamp which use a green life preserver instead of a round 2x2 plate. this is another instance where they use a specialized piece instead of a brick-built solution, but i'm okay with that because unlike with the teddy bear, this part was not originally intended to be a wreath, so it's still nice part usage. the second half of the build is dedicated to the toy shop itself and includes the couple, geppetto, and pbj. please note that there is a fourth 6x10 plate burried under the parts. you begin by tiling the floor, setting up the walls, and adding the interior items such as the fireplace, the cash register, and the toy displays. next, you add the walls, windows, and the door and the ground floor of the shop is finished. so far, the build is the same as the old toy shop, except this time they decided to have the white stripes on the marquees be the longer ones instead of the dark red ones for some reason. i don't know why they did this and kinda would have preverred to get dark red 1x1 plates instead of white, but it doesn't detract from the look of the shop, so i don't really care. now we begin with the upper floor. this is where things start to look a little different. can you tell the difference? the difference is that this time they attach the roof using clip-hinges instead of bulky technic constructions which gives you more space on this floor and allows it to look more like an actual attic. they even tile the floor next to the frog clock. aftter adding the roof, the build is finished. the main roof feels a bit loose since it's only attached to the building by one side. i'm not sure if this was an issue in the old toy shop, but it's not a big deal. i just wouldn't pick the set up by the roof. what i do like is that they used double cheese slopes on the awning on the outer wall of the tower instead of singles which makes it a bit easier to build. i like how the supports under the tower roof now match those of the main roof. the wreaths have also been updated like the ones on the streetlamp. and those technic arches under the roof look a lot more like garlands now. on the original, they were dark gray, so i didn't even know they were supposed to be garlands and assumed they were part of the architecture. the shop sign looks a lot better now that it is printed. the old one just looked like a white flag. i also like how the small plates under the marquee give it a wavy look and they included two trees in different sizes on the right side of the shop. the back is nice and open and allows you to see the rest of the toys, the robot, train, and race car, all of which have just as much of a simple and clever design as the other toys. the clock looks much nicer with the new golden frog. because golden frogs make everything better. spare parts there are quite a few small parts left over, including a roller skate and one of those friends accessory stands which will come in handy. the complete set here you can see the full set together. it looks quite nice and festive with all the little details and there are many scenes that you can play out with it: you can have the minifigs decorate the tree, have the kids play in the snow, have the carolers sing by the bench, have the toymaker build some toys in his workshop, or have the parents buy presents for their kids. it's a festive, toy-filled winter wonderland! the fireplace looks cozy and i like the brick pattern going up the chimney. the entrance of the shop looks a bit empty aside from the cash register. i feel like they could have displayed some more toys here, but oh well. being a set targeted at teens and adults, there aren't really any play features aside from the light brick which is attached to a hinge, so you can either activate it by pressing the button with your finger or tilting the brick upward so that the button is pressed against the roof. however, since the roof is not connected in the middle and only attached on the sides, it tends to split open a bit when you do that, so i'm not sure if attaching the roof this way here was such a good idea. nevertheless, it looks quite nice when the light is lit. ratings design: 5/5 - this set is as gorgeous as it was back in 2009! the small updates that they made are mostly good ones, although the absence of a brick-built teddy is a bit disappointing and the new way the roof is attached, while not as bulky as before, makes the roof slightly unstable, but those are just nitpicks. build: 5/5 - there are some interesting building techniques here, such as those on the tree, the roof, and the toys. the fact that the parts are only split into two groups and the part callouts can get fairly complex makes it a challenging, enjoyable build. minifigs: 5/5 - they did a great job updating the figs in this set. while only 3 of the torsos in the original had any printing, all of the torsos have printing front and back in this set, even the skirt and cape of the female caroler. you get two exclusive heads and half of the heads are double-sided, plus you get 8 instead of 7 minifigs. you really can't ask for more in a creator set. playability: 4/5 - this set is more meant to be displayed than to be played with, but there are plenty of things to play with if you want. all the different minifigs, accessories, and set pieces make for endless possibilities for play. it's especially fun to swoosh the micro vehicles around. parts: 3/5 - there are lots of good parts here. most of them are fairly common, but there are some rare parts and some even in exclusive colors. price: 4/5 - this set costs $20 more than the original, but considering that this set has nearly 900 pieces, including some rare and exclusive ones, as well as more minifigs with much better printing, i think $80 is still a fair price. overall: 5/5 - so what's my opinion of this set? for a remake, i think it's great. they managed to make a good set even better. are the changes minor? yes. are they an improvement? mostly, yes. were they necessary? perhaps not, but it's good that they made them instead of just re-releasing the exact same set. so if you didn't get the first winter toy shop, i can highly recommend getting this one. if you do already have the old version, this one might still be worth picking up for the hugely improved minifigs and rare parts alone. as for the controversy over re-releasing the winter toy shop, i can see where the haters are coming from, but i find their complaints to be quite petty. i can understand if you're disappointed because you already have the first winter toy shop and were looking forward to a new set this year, but there's always next year. if you're a completist and feel like tlg is forcing you to buy a set you don't need, you're wrong. nobody is forcing you to buy anything but yourself. if you decide to buy every set in a theme no matter what it is, that's your problem, not lego's. so put down your torches and pitchforks and just be glad that they improved the set design and gave us another chance to buy this classic set. there are far worse things that can happen in this world than lego re-releasing one of their most popular sets. sorry for that little rant. so what is your opinion on re-releases like this? please cast your vote in the poll above. i hope you enjoyed this special eurobricks reviewers academy review and would like to thank the lego group for the opportunity to review this set. happy holidays everyone!

nice to see they finally updated that generic screaming face from the 2007 castle line. awesome review, oky. i have the old set so i won't be picking this up.
thanks for the excellent review! unfortunately it only highlights how minimal the upgrades are (though they are nice). definitively a pass for me. let's hope lego does continue to make the more realistic winter village sets (versus santa). i'm not opposed to a rehash, the post office could use some improvements for example, but this one is just a wee bit minimal.
thanks for a nice review. i am building it as we speak, and i like it so far. since i didn't have the old one, i can't complain.
thanks for the kind comments everyone! i like hearing your opinions on this set. withacee, on 01 december 2015 - 09:37 am, said: pity the poll has no option "yes, but only in addition to new sets, not in stead of new sets". i don't think that would be a realistic option as that would mean that they would have to spend twice the resources on this theme which i don't think they are ready to do, but if more people would like this option, i can add it to the poll. joebot, on 01 december 2015 - 08:33 pm, said: after mocking people for holding a particular opinion, you then turn around and ask people to express their opinion?? no thanks. i guess i'll keep my opinions to myself. i certainly don't want to be labeled a "hater." i'm not mocking anyone. i just think that some people need to calm down a bit and that tlg is getting more hate than they deserve for this set, but that's just my opinion and you're welcome to disagree with it. everyone is entitled to their own opinion, including you and me. and yes, i would love to hear your thoughts on this matter because i would like to have a friendly discussion on this subject.
thanks for the nice review! the landing mechanism looks quite cute. aren't the yellow axles 5l, not 4l? (very strange that they would release such a part).
hi there, nice model, great review! i almost reverse engineered this model, but used wrong parts for landing wheels, didn't know how to fix the nose proper, and so on. so i was very interested in this model and i like playing with it. i love the reviews, but i think i have to mention, that the yellow axle must be a 5l! the picture shows a 5l, and a 5l would fit the size of the model. the cart has also a 5l in yellow. what sitze is the yellow axle in this seit. really 4l as written in the text? greetings, robert

nice review, even with the missing demonstration video of the a-model! looks like this is an excellent panel pack for the price, and those soft axles will go down a treat. will this set be the dark horse of 1h 2016...?
i am definitely getting set for the panels!
i just built the a model, and i rather like it. it is much bigger than it looks from the box - about 30 studs long. there is only one function - the landing gear - but it works very nicely. apart from that, it's a very solid build, and achieves an elegant shape with an absolute minimum of parts. i don't usually get excited about small sets, but this one appeals to me. i like the feeling that every single piece has a purpose.
i almost purchased this today because i like the wheel / disc combo so much.
one hero will now have just enough of that pullback motor to create one ultimate machine, thanks to this.
jim great reviews but can i suggest you one thing? take some pics before you apply the stickers....and some with the stickers on! it helps to have a comparison!
cool! glad you like 'em. and thanks for the kind words.
are parts #62462 in flat or metallic silver?
what a nice, tight an clean design! usually not too keen on the pull-back models, but this one is great.
the instructions for the extreme police interceptor combo model is now online....will someone do a review of this b model? https://wwwsecure.us...tselector=true#

thanks for the review. i wonder if the design inspiration came from the russian ka-32 helicopter.

lego 42049 mine loader thanks to lego and eurobricks for making this review possible! this was supposed to be a preview-review, before the dec 1 release date for the set, but it got stuck in customs or something and didn't arrive in time. well, i'd rather do a good, late review than a rushed review, so here it is. name: mine loader set number: 42049 pieces: 476 (i think) price: $39.99 (i think) minifigs: 0 theme: technic year of release: 2016 links: bricklink brickset the box another standard technic box, not that there's anything wrong with that. it is a littler weird that the mine loader is shown outside the mine, but whatever. the back of the box again, very standard. it's oddly technical, showing the exact angle of the machine when turning, but that's the sort of nerdy detail that technic people like. the alternate mine cutting machine model looks interesting and unusual as well. the 1:1 part the 1:1 part on the top of the box is especially helpful with this set. these mining machines are very oddly proportioned, since they need to fit in mine tunnels, so it's hard to judge the model size based on the wheels or seat like you can an ordinary set. the contents you get manuals for both models (a single book for the b and two books for the main), a medium size sticker sheet, 4 bags, and 4 loose tires. the special parts this set has 4 of the new mudguard panels in yellow, two cylinder halves in red (a new color), some of the new color red and yellow axles, a couple of the new-ish technic spacers, some of the axle-pin combination pieces, and a couple swords! i'm pretty sure that's "an antenna" and a spare. the start of the b-model since i like the main model better, i'm building the alternate first, so that's how i'll write the review. there's "power" for something (probably the engine) being taken off the one axle here. overall, a pretty standard technic frame beginning with some structural beams, a frame, and using liftarms to support axles out to the sides. more of the frame the far end of the model has some obvious steering mechanism being formed, as well as a pivoting arm right in the center that's probably the connection from the hand of god knob. the steering yup. called it. oddly, there is a different turning radius between right and left right now. i wonder if that'll get fixed... more mechanisms that's looking more technic now. sad to see a u-joint being used just as a fixed straight connection like that, but it is the alternate model... the engine block because all engines should be enclosed in a red cylindrical housing, am i right? the chassis it's definitely coming together now. and yes, the b-model instructions tell you to put the stickers on. it doesn't matter whether you build the main or alternate first, you'll get the stickers on (almost - there were a couple leftover that didn't get used in the b-model). almost done with the rest of the body done and the wheels on, you really get the scale of this machine. that blue seat is tiny compared to the rest of it! and yes, the uneven steering lock got fixed. after putting the wheels on, you add a couple of "pin with ball" pieces to the underside to restrict the steering. they didn't do that at first so that you could turn the axles sharper while putting the wheels on, which made it easier to do. the grinder keeping in mind the scale of the machine, this thing looks terrifying! the tan gear at the back drives the spinning blade up front. the red bushes near the turntable let you adjust the angle. all done the arm quickly attaches to the body and it's done. sadly, that tan gear doesn't connect to anything - it's just a knob so you can spin the blade by hand. raise your hand, if you're sure... (i think i'm dating myself with that title...) this thing has massive reach. i'm imagining this inside a mine, grinding away the rock overhead. pretty viciously effective machine! the crank on this side of the model is used to raise and lower the arm. works well, and the grey spacer makes it nice to use since it spins freely. the leftovers not much left for a b-model. nice usage! starting the main model the main model starts similarly to the alternate, with a frame, some axles, and a drive connection from one axle to something later. getting complicated already we're only a few pieces in and we already have three separate gear trains going on. there's the axle driving the tan beveled gears inside the frame at the bottom. there's more tan gears in the middle, and there's also a black gear sticking up as a knob that turns the grey connector in the center. the body is done i skipped ahead quite a bit, but it was a bunch of standard technic building. you've got a fake engine with fan at the back, driven by one of the rear wheels, a knob sticking up for steering, and an axle coming forward to open and close the claw. the claw! i like that they used a link system to open and close the claw instead of just gearing it. the axle comes forward from the chassis (it's the red axle) with a couple u-joints for flexibility and drives a worm gear. that rotates a gear below with a 2 stud liftarm on each side. those arms have pin with towball in them and then a link going from that short liftarm to the claw. it's a small rotation of the liftarm, but makes the claw open widely and works very well. raising the claw a few black liftarms join the claw to the body of the loader and allow it to move up and down. it's a simple mechanism there - one yellow beam goes back and connects to a lever that lets you raise and lower the claw. when raised (as shown), the lever locks in place by going just slightly past the centerline. and it's done add some wheels, a cab, and some wheel arches and we're done. it's a great looking machine, pretty unique, and looks like the real thing. the main difference from reality is these usually have a scoop for moving loose rock. since we've had so many scooping vehicles in the past (tracked loaders, the volvo l350f, excavators, etc) the claw here is a fun change and adds to the playability for kids. like the real thing, the body stays very low so the cab only has to stick up a little bit for the driver to see all around, because mines are cramped and busy areas. from the rear this angle is great. i love the use of the new mudguard panels to make a nice curve to the back of the loader. the antenna is a little weird, but perhaps they had a big pile of flat silver fencing swords to use up. the black gear just to the left of the antenna is the claw control. rotating that gear opens and closes it. the back end is a little lighter than a real machine would be, but lego wanted to leave the engine exposed so you can see the cylinders moving. the conclusion so, what's my conclusion on this model? i like it a lot. it's simpler than a big set would be, but it's got lots of design and playability crammed in a mid-sized set. it's a unique vehicle. however, it does have a few flaws. the steering on the main model needs some drag added. as is, you basically have to drive by holding the steering knob since it'll bend if you push it from behind. i don't like the use of pin with pin hole as mounting points for the orange and red trans plates for lights, since they can turn slightly and be at weird angles. the antenna is unnecessary and in the way. but none of these flaws are dealbreakers or even big deals. they're minor. the ratings value: 10/10 - less than 10 cents a piece, lots of useful liftarms and such, nothing too weird or single-use. design: 9/10 - looks very realistic for the size of the set, good functionality, not too dependent on stickers minifigs: n/a - n/a playability: 9/10 - controls aren't perfect (loose steering, small knob for claw control) but very functional and cleverly done. parts: 9/10 - nice selection, although heavy on the standard yellow and black. almost zero studded parts. overall: 9.5/10 - it's a great intro to technic set - a unique vehicle, good functionality, nice part selection, and decently priced. i like it a lot and plan to keep it around as a finished set.
great review with high quality pictures, well done!! i'm glad you took the time to do it properly. cool that you have built both models. i agree with the mudguards. they sure look good on this model.
i was waiting especially for review of this set. let me add few things about this... thing. it all will be complainging of person who works with these type of machines, so if you just want a unusual machine in your collection, ignore my complaining :) i see underground loaders almost every day, and believe me, this model would now work in the underground mine. first of all, its cab should stick out more from the frame. each loader has cab placed out of the chassis, to provide better view for the driver. in this class of machine it would help a bit, but in low loader ones it is extremely important: this is the view from the cab of a low profile loader (looking at front - and yes, front of the machine is where engine is placed, because at least at kghm all machines drive engine forward): another thing about that cab is that seat and steering wheel/joysticks are placed perpendicularly to the machine chassis, to provide same view for driving forward and backwards. so another weak spot of the set. the model lacks of trans clear lights on the engine part, because all machines that work underground have same lamps on front and back. another thing that comes to my mind is that warning light and antena would not live too long in the mine, becuase it could be torn apart by ramming into tunnels roofs. it does resemble shape of underground machine, but not a loader. only machine that comes to my mind is something that are used for moving/placing hydraulic support jacks in tunnels. sorry for poor quality, i didn't find better picture of it: it does have claw, four wheels and articulated chassis, but have much greater range of movement of the arm. anyway, i'd give it at least 3/5 for overall look. model itself, as a set, looks unfinished (or cut down on pieces after visit of an accountant...) for me it looks like engine part was built differently, with knobs for steering/claw operating sticking out from back. claw needs almost seven full turns of the worm gear to close from opened position, and is rather annoing to use it in way it is built in this model. bracket that holds bevel gears responsible for steering is rather loose, being hold in place by single 3/4 pin. on the other hand, the steering works very well. it seems that lack of differential will be more common in lego sets, becuase it is another model that have fake engine driven by single wheel (like in old russian rc cars...). i am ok with that, but it is a pitty that this model has only r2 engine. thing that i do not like the most in this model is how the claw arm works. first of all, it barelly lifts the claw of the ground, the movement could be much better. and it has major design flaw - universal joints are not placed in line with articulation points, and this is main reason of 5l axle not being suported on both sides under the turntable. while rainsing the arm, it bends a little! i really would like to see this model built differently, with normal bucket and better range of movement. edited by m_longer, 05 december 2015 - 11:08 pm.
thanks for the thorough comments! i agree that the set has some limitations, both in construction and realism, but i think they're acceptable given the pricepoint and size. the antenna is definitely ludicrous - i really do suspect they had a surplus of the swords to use up! and yes, the way the steering knob is mounted is loose. i also noticed that the u-joints to the claw are not in the right spot like you mentioned, but didn't include it since it still works fine. that axle coming forward to the claw has a very long unsupported section that does bend a bit when you raise and lower the claw. it works, but is a bit of a cheat that i'm kinda surprised they let through. i just checked and the bucket from 8043 is a couple studs too wide for this set. i'm betting that was seriously considered, but it'd have meant scaling the whole thing up and that would have put it into a higher price point. or they could have pulled the mold for the 8x14 bucket back out and remade it for this set... i really like the model you built! and that's interesting about the cabs being basically flush with the top but sticking out the side. in image searching as part of my research, i found both that style and ones like this, with the cab sticking up more (like the photo of the caterpillar one in my review). i wonder if that's a us/european difference, or different types of mining, or what, because both styles definitely exist in the real world.
excellent review! worth waiting for. the set itself is very interesting. looks like it may have one interesting build techniques. thanks for the review, andy ad
freekysch, on 06 december 2015 - 12:00 pm, said: great review and great pictures ! many thanks for talking the time to review this set . i am a fan of lego technic construction stuff, but this set is not so appealing to me. but, then again i am sure some people will love it. indeed very good review! and also good points pointed out by m_longer ;) this set doesnt appealing to me neither, but before i knew what it was i was thinking it was interesting but now... its so simple, a set close to 500 pieces with only 1 real function, and the entire rear section looks unfinished.
nice mod there, effe, might inspire me when i get one and start modding it
i have made a ldd file of a improved version
^^efferman : would there be an instruction list for this mod ?
a forum member on doktor brick has said he will make an instruction
great review! im a bit undecided on the set though, it has some nice parts (4 cil engine in such a small set!) and it looks good, but also a bit small and simple, not sure if it stands up to the standards of the small tracked loader or similar for sets of this size, and as a parts pack (for panels/flaxles) the display team jet is infinitely better. ill probably pick one up, but right now i really want another tracked loader... (last one was sacrificed to the mod gods)
the set is a looker, you've got to admit it, but what it gives in looks does not make up for what it lacks in functions. i really wanted this set, badly even, when i restarted my adventure with technic about a month ago. than i learned more and more about what a good model can do, mostly thanks to this forum and yt. right now i'm a bit disappointed with the arctic truck - smaller sets offer more functions and teach you much more. jim it was a great review nevertheless edited by pgplay, 14 december 2015 - 11:22 am.
i think this model is more or less supposed to be a version of this thing. a pretty obscure topic, but also very interesting.
you switched the sides for the panel with the unsymmetrical sticker. otherwise you would see that the cut off part is where there's a beam in front of the panel. that's probably done because the beam could possibly damage the sticker, either while building or while placed against it for a long time. or it's simply omitted because it wouldn't be (completely) visible
another great review i like this set very much, both models look good to me and it's a great part pack for me, the long list in the "high light parts" session tells everything. as for the real world counter part of the a model, how about this: try googling sno-cat and there a lots of such things.

sad, i miss this set.
looks like you are late 2 years) nice set that you can play on your working place while small pauses this set is very cool, especially when you can: 42001 chassis + imagination = http://www.bricksafe...es/rm8/tlc_fj40 edited by rm8, 14 december 2015 - 11:17 am.

i don't like appearance of this off-roader at all but i've got it as gift so it's in my technic collection now. when i built it i was very surprised how cool suspension it has and how much playability it features. i've also tried to build some alternative model out of it but without success. anyway thank you jim for great review! edited by tomik, 14 december 2015 - 05:45 pm.
mister phes, on oct 20 2007, 12:38 am, said: you've done a good job of this review mr imperialscouts! but two things. 1) background far too bright and the set is far too dark, easily rectified with brightness & contrast adjustment. 2) no poll to rate the set out of 5. nonetheless this should be frontpaged on classic-pirates.com! alas, i cannot make polls in the pirate forum, so a generous moderator/admin would be so kind to add one. nonetheless, the picture was fixed, and appears to be alright. but i'm glad that the review is enjoyed!
i'm not generous but i'll do it anyway x-d now i need to write an artistic statement and then i can write my own review for broadside's brig!
the poll is for the set, not the review :-d . but thank you anyway! and it appears mister phes made the mistake :-p !
for the price it really looks like a nice set. because of the lack of a cannon, i give it a 4. cool comic is! *y* captain roger, on oct 20 2007, 10:59 am, said: i'd give a 2, but you put 3 two times. thanks for the pointer! changed, and i added your vote.
nice review, funny little story, and a 4 from me. a useful little set indeed. *sweet*
great review, cool comic. *wub* i give the set a four, and i will go and buy it now as i am missing many of those parts.... oh it's not for sale? off to bricklink then! :-d
how much was it again? for the price it looks really solid. if u add the prison to the back it looks real good.
hello, well as this is my first review i hope you like it. the 7744 police station is simply fanstastic. the many minifigs and the vehicles makes it really nice. the great playabillaty and and great space makes it great for children i think. but latest but not least the pics! general overview: the front of the box: the back of the box: inside the box: top of the box: instructions: the minifigs: the cars: patrol car: dog car: the dog: the motor: well now the police station : the mailbox: the crime report room: the handcuffs holder: handcuff: suspect who wears handcuffs: jails: satelite: little things: water machiene: and if you don?t like water, we have coffee to!: well and as last: the interrogation room: well this was the review. i hope you liked it! bye
hooray assuming from the picture on the box we will also be getting the old police car and bike in blue aswell! i really like this set it seems the best police station we've had in a long time and what a great amount of figures! thanks for this great insight the-force! ;-)
finally, the highly anticipated luke skywalker maquette! i'm still looking forward to that boba!
thanks for the cool picture! how big are those maquettes? could you make a picture with a minifig next to the maquette please?
is there also a boba fett maquette?? if y please a pic??!!? thanks!
cool review, thanks!! :-d i personally think the minirobot is awesome, and (dare i say) cute! this was described on amazon to be a mobile lab, i'm not seeing that. i do however see a crystal hauling vehicle. *sweet* pretty cool, not as bad as previous sets. ~peace
thanks for the review, it's a neat little set. i hope it comes to australia sooner rather than later. that minifig head was also used in 7699 mt-101 so that may be why it seems familiar.
hmm, not actually a bad set. not high on my 'to buy' list, there're other things up there first, but definitely a possibility somewhere down the line. thanks for the review.

excuse me?! a mass of technic parts? wow, you better lock your doors tonight....

during the annual thanksgiving road trip to the relatives, i stopped by the tru in portland, or. lo and behold, the new mars mission sets! predictably, i bought them. i present to you: the mx-41 switch fighter! man, what a long name. the box: standard mm. on the front, it shows the fighter in flight mode, and a yellow note telling you that it transforms. the back shows three pictures showing it happen. the parts: once i open the box, the first thing that comes out is a bent and rolled up instruction booklet, and i was forced to put it under a stack of beer books for an hour. then, there's the dss. yes, two of the stickers do feature a cobra. i wonder why, because this set's decal should be a beatle. x-d decent parts, nothing too special. then, i noticed this little part. it's used for the flick-missiles, but i have no idea what else it would be used for. :-/ the build: the alien ship: when i looked at the box art for this set, i was releived to see that the aliens don't have another curved-forward wing ship. instead, they have this little beauty, which appears to be the alien mini cooper- small and hot. *wub* anyway, partially completed. even if you don't like the set, it has some nice green flame peices, which work nicely for space laser swords. fully completed. the only annoying bit about it is that the crystal-holding thing in front wobbles all over the place. the alien fits into it by way of impalement. it must hurt getting in and out. switch fighter (cockpit): the set makes good use of the alpha team cockpit. for controls, it has a meagre handlebar that the astronaught can't even reach. the rear "shell" of the fighter starts out around the alien containment chamber. it's a bit odd that the containment chamber has an alien sticker, because the instruction booklet lists it as holding crystals. the crystal canister is held back by a technic pin. this is, without a doubt, the ugliest color arrangment ever. warning: mass stickers. :-x the cockpit fits into grooves in the "shell". then it clicks into place in a 1x1 brick with a horizontal clip. the wing "mechanism": the wing. for some reason, the body of the "mechanism" has a blue brick. *wacko* the wing and "mechanism" connect to prevent the fighter doing a nosedive while in tank mode. the wing "mechanism" completed: the underside: the body and wing connect by way of a miscolored red brick. i have no idea why it's red- black would bave been much, much better. completed. tank mode: all in all, this looks pretty neat. the wheel base is pretty short, but it's not bad. transform! the set transforms neatly, if ungainly. without "anti-grav" support, it would fall forward on it's nose each time it transformed. jet mode. it's all right, but it could be a bit better. the "shell" keeps slipping back forward to the "tank mode" because there's nothing to stop it sliding. spare parts: overall: i thought this set was great. it could do with some fixing, such as the mismatched colors, but it should be a definate buy for mm fans. brickshelf gallery (when available)
after seeing this set review it change my mind about this set. by the way thanks for the great review.
thanks for that very good review, mr. mandalorian! *y* i think that this is a plain beautiful set, oh how i wish that tlc would?ve taken that direction from the beginning.... :'-) the design is much more practicable, with fewer non-system parts and technic beams with(!) studs.... this makes everything much more easier to mod and a lot more useful, at least imo. *y* so it?s for sure not very hard to make the (wonderful enclosed) cockpit one brick higher, and even that little alien ship looks decent and nice.... x-o and the fighter looks sleek and elegant too, in both modes! that?s just very cool, compliments, tlc. now all we need?re aliens with moving arms and here we go, classic space on forever! x-d
wow. this is actually quite a neat set! it is definitively my favorite in the line after the big drilling unit! \begin{geek} i'm not sure it would nose dive when transforming from tank mode. i guess it would pick up speed and transform quickly since it doesn't seem to have any downwards pointing thrusters. \end{geek}
friggin sweet, thank you mr mandy for the reveiw of this sweet ship! *y* *wub*
hmmm, i doubt i'll be getting this set. good review though.
i really like the transforming aspect of this! the one thing i wish mm sets would include would be baseplates. i liked that about the classic space stuff because it really helped create the environment. some "red rock orange" mars baseplates would be great!

great review mr mandalorian! *y* i'm not a fan of mm and don't like this set much, but it has some neat features. but the only way i can see it transforming is by racing off a cliff and swinging its wings out *wacko* to the brickmobile! >:-)
and another tks and congrats mm on that review !! like the o?her post i think that this set is a wastre of time and money and shelfspace. its such a ripp off from that ugly alfa team crapjet. i do not like the design of the jet itself: the small flags as front is so lame !! and i don't like those orange wheels as engines !! furthermore i don't like the "rover" mode either !! the only cool thing about it is the special martian jet which they should ahve sold separatly :-p at least some interesting parts but that far from saving that set imo |-/ money saved on once again :-p *yoda*

yes, finally!!!! hinckley youre the best!! is there a chance i can ever be in one of your ever so loved comics? i just read it and so far so good in the 08 ef line. looking forward to the rest of the review! edited by exo-builder59, 27 november 2007 - 04:04 am.
so hinckley, can you give us a hint on what our walrus friend will do with the dark panther? i can't wait to see. 8-|
great review hinckley! i know you've been busy, so thank you so much for getting this up! :-d the spine construction is clever, the minirobot's cool, this is a fantastic set! ~peace
thanks hinckley! it's always nice to see your reviews, and i can't wait to see the story mode (from the pic, i guess it will include sinner and hinckley, instead of bianca and gavin, right? 8-| ) luxorv
thanks for this fantastic review hinckley, i can't wait to see the comic! :'-) i really love this mech as i am a fan of non-bipedal mechs (though i am terrible at making them), the purple is great and i can't wait to see what mocers will use those awesome new spike peices for! 3 robots in one mech is a really good deal too, and that spider droid just adds so much more to the set. and thanks for taking the time to do this! *sweet* not to sound like a smartypants though, but the grill peice in purple is not the first time this has happened, two were included in the 06 joker helicopter ;-) thanks again! to the brickmobile! >:-)
great review as always, hinckley. frankly i'm in love with this thing. so much so, in fact, that i've been calling it 'shadow panther' for weeks, but never mind... anyway, why do i like it? well, purple is such a fantastic lego colour- it's sparingly used, which makes it interesting, and it simply looks great. those jetpack/backpack things the robots are wearing, and if they are jetpacks, as the back of the box suggests, then the use of chaisaws is quite nifty and innovative. the minibot is cool, and certainly an interesting gimmick. sure, they don't look quite as good in some of the other sets, but here it looks great. the overall structure and design are cool too. it's always nice to see an 'irregular' mech, and this is no exception. it's especially cool whee the spines are concerned. plus, on top of all that, it's got a nice selection of parts, including some lovely new ones, and the inlaid box is interesting. well worth getting, i think.
thanks everyone! i'm glad you are enjoying the review. i'm working on the 8118 right now and will have comics up for both starting tonight. hayatoson, on nov 27 2007, 04:02 am, said: awesome reveiw thanks for the pics!! did the instructions come with a comic? the instructions do not have a comic, but i always write one for my reviews featuring my sig-fig or other fabuland creatures interacting with the new set...
kmoi, on nov 27 2007, 11:12 pm, said: don't forget bianca and gavin, o' lordship of pies! :-d truly another excellent review! the pictures are absolutely splendid, as usual! i'm really glad those air-vent pieces were done so well. while i remain skeptical about the new giant spikes, you've sold me on this set! i can't wait to see the fabuland comic and your final verdict, hink! me too!!! ;-)
that's a very interesting set... and with all that purple a must buy. i decided recently that i am going to resist buying lego unless it's on sale next year, but i have so little purple.... 8-| i love the little robot! :-p thanks for the photos hinckley and i look forward to the comic! *sweet* (as sir dillon said, some of the links appear dead but i suspect it is a server error... :-/ )
thanks for pointing that out guys. it should work now... :-$
8118 hybrid rescue tank review enjoy guys! i am working on more. maybe we'll have the 8112 battle arachnoid next. the comics will be around eventually. sorry for all the delays and the teasing. i appreciate your patience!!
from the lego store in chicago, if i recall his post properly! my goodness hink, you're going to pull an all-nighter for reviews at this rate! oh well, it's kinda worth it, right? :-p
this designers were on a roll with this one until it came to the flying unit. it looks like a shambles, epecially the guns looking rather simplistic. although they used something similar to the light and sound globe peice, which is kind of neat. i dont think i'll be buying this but your review almost talked me into it.
fantastic! great review, thanks a bunch for all the pics, they've shown me how (in my opinion) bad this set is. :-p i just expected it to be more bricky rather than technicy. oh well, i wasn't planning on buying it anyway. x-d i noticed you spelt mini-figs mini-fgis in the first paragraph, in case you wanted to know. x-d so again, thanks, and i'm looking forward to seeing the rest of them, and the comics! ~peace
hinckley, on nov 28 2007, 06:48 am, said: cool! but my reviews are not meant to sway anyone. they should just inform people further as if they want to buy it or not. i am not necessarily for encouraging anyone to buy every set i review. :-d but i'm glad you liked it. thank you. oh i know but without the info i definately wouldnt buy it, now i'm considering it. hinckley, on nov 28 2007, 06:48 am, said: and actually i did feel the same way you did about the flying module, until i put sinner in it and started to play. here's a sneak peek of the comic and a cool feature of ryo's ship-it can be configured in a lot of different ways: x-o ........................................ sinner fits in there. well, i'm sold. x-d
thanks for this great review hinckley! :'-) i know you're loving this attention! x-d :-p i actually like this set, and like it a lot more now that i've seen this review. i'll most likely get, mostly for the figs and parts. i reckon it would look a lot better alongside the rest of the 2008 ef mechs. anyway, thanks for the review! to the brickmobile! >:-)
asuka, on nov 28 2007, 02:41 pm, said: for the design, i love that asymmetrical look of the front part and the sleek guns of the flyer. the asymmetry reminds me of the wookie vehicles in starwars battlegrounds... *y* and i see they changed back to the first color schemes for minifig suits, which i think where better than the dark suits of 2007 (except for hikaru's *wub* ) luxorv
thank you for the review hinckley :-) already waiting for the comic x-d
jifel, on dec 2 2007, 08:37 am, said: crap! >:-( now i have to spend all my money on this! *wub* *wub* and whats the code? oh well, awesome set, and judt curios, didnt the reviewers used to be bianca and gavin? jifel yes they did! *sweet* i like using me and sinner better, though. i have put fabuland housewives on the back burner for a while, but plan to revive it for the first season conclusion in january. it's nice to see that there are people who really follow it out there. thanks! :-$
thanks for that neat review of a very nice set. the color scheme?s great and that minirobot looks very comical and funny indeed, sweet! *sweet*
zero1312, on dec 5 2007, 05:27 pm, said: wow, nice review. *y* but i have a question: where can i find these "ork sets" everyone is refering to because of these swords in the rotors. :-/ are you talking about the dwarves mine? *sweet*
cool! another *y* *y* *y* *y* *y* *y* out of *y* *y* *y* *y* *y* and could you post a pic of all the minirobots and planes
i gave it a 5, it has some nice pieces at a reasonable price. thanks for this review, and the pictures are great! *sweet*

col. whipstick, on jan 3 2008, 12:37 am, said: did i hear right? a catapult in the 16th/17th/18th and 19th centuries? *wacko* perhaps it's an appeal for lord of pies to have his own personal catapult to pelt the pirates with whipped cream pastries should they try to sail past. but this begs the question... why waste perfectly good pie on those scurvy, mangy, mutt-faced villians! what a wonderful idea.... :-p a pie catapult! although it is a waste of a pie....we have ourselves a dilemma!
i liked the set, but it could have done more, plus the strange price of 15.50 just seems odd. must be the modern pricing systems *wacko* another rowboat with a pirate would have been good *y* *y* *y* out of *y* *y* *y* *y* *y*
its a nice set. i would not mind owning one, just for the minifigs and cannon. the base plate is pretty cool as well. nice review, i gave it a 4 out of 5.
indexed i'm going to have to start dodging cannon balls soon if i don't start making some pirate mocs. *pirate* anywayz, i've had my shell service station set # 6378 built exactly by "the book" and sitting around for the longest time. with the recent twinning of my "town" with dr. sinister, i needed a gas station that could handle a lot more traffic (especially military traffic and these new 6-wide vehicles x-d ). here be a thumblink to the original station at bl: i love this station so much, but it really needed some modernization. the reopening of this station received a lot of attention, even the local police stopped right over. one big upgrade to this station is the selling of propane tanks, which is generally a rare commodity from the lego towns i've seen. x-d also at this service station is a propane tank refilling station. the milkman is our first propane customer. the interior has also had an addition and many upgrades. for instance, this building now has florescent lighting, a big frig in the back, and more shelf space. *y* oh look! there's the officer purchasing a mountain dew. now that there's more shelf space, we can sell more than just 1x1 round yellow bricks and levers. we now have available 1x1 round plates and 1x1 round cones available in multiple colors! :-d with this upgraded gas station, hopefully this town will bring in more business and customers into my small town. x-d p
legobear, on dec 8 2007, 11:32 pm, said: ... does that mean you didn't have the set but you used your own pieces to rebuild the thing? ... thanx legobear. it means that i have the complete set and have kept it complete until yesterday x-d since i like the set so much, i wanted to keep the general look of it :-) p edited by phred, 09 december 2007 - 06:27 am.
great moc! it seems you did the math when doing this one and hit the nail on the head (which pierced a megablock causing it to self destruct) ! stauder
that?s a be-au-ti-ful station! it looks perfect from head to toe ;) you managed to keep the original feeling, yet enhanced it to match the spirit of todays city sets. congratulations! and i love your milkman truck! :d
a wonderful work and a neat idea with that propane tank refilling station. *y* very detailed and very charming indeed! :'-)
nice station phred, love those fluorescent lights! *wub* but...start dodging cannonballs now, boom, harr! :-p

indy565, on dec 16 2007, 10:31 am, said: nooo! :'-( patients my young indy loving friend *sweet* anyway thanks for the reveiw i wasnt going to get this set but i just might, it's a coin toss between the truck chase and this one, which one do you guys think i should get?
this is great, thanks for the review...but they're using a new skellie? i thought those were just for the reanimated dead...not just skeletons. unless that skeleton is supposed to be reanimated? either way it makes me sad :'-( that marion is beautiful *wub* worth it for the set alone! and that sw reference is great x-d
could you take a photo of the ark? thanks oh and the inside too pleese *sweet*
lol! those star wars heiroglyphics are awesome! were those in the movie? or is this just a joke by the lego designers? that would be the first time tlc showed any kind of reference humor! the rest of the set is great too, even the skeleton and the stickers. yes, that's right, i actually like those things. i like the new skellies because of their posability (i'm a big supporter & user of stop-motion) and i think there's nothing wrong with stickers. i mean seriously, why does everybody hate stickers so much??? :-| sure, they are a pain in the megablocks to put on and, sure, they come off after a while and are never usable again, but hey, you don't have to put them on, even better, you can save them (like i do) and use them for your mocs! could somebody tell me, please? i'm just curious. however, as i said, nice set! i might even get one. gotta love that marion with the carot torch x-d and that arc is neat too! by the way, are all parts on it golden? some more pics on it would be nice as soon as your camera is recharged! ;-) thanks. peace out!

this and motorcycle chase were the two sets i've wanted from the start. i like how you get lots of snakes, and i'll add my snakes in too, for a brickfilm. sometimes i like the stickers, but all my world city ones got hard and fell off :'-( i like the r2-d2. could you take a pic of any hieroglyphics in this set(not the ones on the sticker sheet.) thanks. i want to decode them.
thanks for the review! this is certainly bigger than i expected! can't wait to see your other pics! *y*
is the efigy a totally new peice, or is it made of smaller peices with some gold hair attatched? sorry if i missed this :-$ nice review, just wish we had some more pics of the built set :-d
thanks for the pics cant wait to see more, oh btw when the camera charges could you pleese take a photo of everything falling apart when indy takes the idol? cheers! reveiw on *y*
cool. found it bit disappointed though |-/ ... (not disappointed about the review but the set)
awesome looking playset. will probably not get due to price, and the fact i don't really need it. good to see how everything works, but those damn stickers!
big pete, on dec 15 2007, 06:04 pm, said: ?44.99, as it says in the first line of the review ;-) yes, but i don't live in the uk. any idea how much it might cost in the us?
thanks for that fine review, big pete! *y* a really adventurous set with a good playability and neat traps! that mayaesque sticker?s also very decent. i think that the box art of these indy sets is pretty cool too with all these 'action scene' pics, nicely done, tlc. overall, a very lovely set indeed.... tomb raiding on! :'-)
no hovitos? no! ah well, if i get more pirate sets next year i'd use the islanders as hovitos. in the video game they have the same torsos. i'd really like to get this, maybe in june i'll have luck. :'-)
this set is pretty nice i love the idol id probably buy the set just for that :-d lol is it just me or in the earlier concepts of this set we saw a native on the box? i wonder why they removed it :-( *wacko*
it looks like a nice set but i'm not interested in the minis, it's got a nice drawbridge though! thanks! *sweet*
picked up from the lego shop in bluewater yesterday front of box back of box price ?2.50 gbp contents, a very small instruction manual instructions (front) intsructions (back) 25 pieces (23 used in the model) regular construction mini fig start of the assembly roll in the drum just attach the drum a little tap with the hammer! (hammer not included!) wheel it into position time to start mixing, also time for a well earned tea break, the cement is all ready now. and the 2 left over bits. extra cement is always useful and not really wasted. overall, a nice little set and i am pleased to see little sets appearing again at long last. the only negative is with the drum of the mixer, although the angle can be adjusted you cannot tip the contents out of the mixer. all in all i would say 8/10 for a good little set? comments...? ? ? edit by hobbes: replaced pictures with clickable thumbs and corrected set number.
aww man! i hate that face. it doesn't match any of my other lego heads! in my opinion, it's not even lego-ey.
omg i absolutely love how you reviewed this set, i think you are the only person i've ever seen on eurobrick with such a thorough review. i read eurobricks daily and this really raises the bar in terms of how a person does a review. please do not resize your pics, they are perfect, crisp, large, thorough, and clear; it gives anyone who really wants info on the set just about everything they need to know about it. i had no idea they used that lil "thing" to have the cement mixer spin, cool idea ;-) . nice set, but perfect perfect review. thanks much! x-d
thanks for the review, this looks like a nice set to have multiple copies of... i think that you may have mistyped the setnumber, as i was expecting this cute car when i read the title (i wondered how you could see a cementmixer in this set...) :-p
thanks for this review. lots of minifigs is a plus, although half of them are junk jellies, but dang the base just doesn't seem impressive. it looks so cheap, like a skeleton. the tubes are just ridiculous. but hey, at least it comes with two cool spacecraft, that's nice.
i agree, it does seem very scarce, but ive taken apart the nerf launcher, made a new module with the tube the launcher used, and beefed up the base with some computers and other things. for 90 dollars i would pass, i agree. on sale it is lovely, though. and none the less ive been entertained for ages with them flyin through the tubes :-d
thanks for the photos and review brickmaster. i'm hoping to find this on sale as well... no luck so far. i love the white ship, and i think the base would be amusing, but ultimately hard to re-use. incidentally, that long axel is common in recent technic sets, but i think it was orignally made for the hockey sets. :-d
i quite like it, but i feel that my lego city is getting over-run with helicopters and planes. also i have got the helicopter from the 7237 police station set, but it is not as good as this plus i'am sooooo dissapointed that the :-x stickers :-x are blue instead of black and green as they will not fit with the sets i have already got :-d nice review thanks edited by caseyref, 26 december 2007 - 02:04 am.

can you take a picture(s) of all the film posters?
axle, on dec 28 2007, 02:07 pm, said: can you take a picture(s) of all the film posters? there?s no necessity to take pics of all the film posters. there are only 3 different film posters at the set. always one poster twice.. and you can see every different poster at the brickshelf gallery. if you need more details, then you should maybe buy it :-) regards sandra
awesome!! i love the intierior of the theater! really good reveiw!
thank you for the review
nice review - thx for all the pics. they certainly made me consider getting this set. kimt btw: which set would you recommend: market streeet, town plan or cafe corner? just curious. they're pretty expensive and i might only afford one of them.
kimt, on jan 4 2008, 10:25 am, said: btw: which set would you recommend: market streeet, town plan or cafe corner? just curious. they're pretty expensive and i might only afford one of them. definitely the coffee corner. it?s a hard desicion between coffee corner and town plan, because they are both really great sets. the market street is no "must have" in my opinion. but the other two. maybe you should start with the coffee corner, it?s the older set. the town plan is newer and will be available longer then the coffee corner. i hope it helped you a litte bit :-$ regards sandra edited by legocastlegirl, 04 january 2008 - 10:43 am.
xwingyoda, on dec 29 2007, 01:25 pm, said: ps: @ tedbeard - do tone it down youg man !! if you're not happy with sandra's work, do provide one yourself instead of bitching on how you view a review and on how sandra's post is veryt far from one (according to you !!) wow, i have not been called a "youg man" (by which i assume you mean "young") for a while. as a forty year old with three kids that's unusual. *sweet* i tried very hard to remain positive in my critique and complimented her on those things she had done well. i felt that given the somewhat juvenile "omg, best...review...ever" tone that was creeping in amongst the replys, that it needed to be tempered with some thoughtful suggestions as to how a good review could be made great. your ad hominem approach is offensive and far more negative than i was and to suggest i should do my own review is ridiculous. i live in canada and we do not even have the set available here yet thus i am interested in seeing reviews of this set. if i already had the set i would not be so interested. and next time you propose to critique a critique perhaps you should actually read what i wrote. i said she wrote a good review for a specific audience. i did not say it was awful or whatever you seem to have assumed i meant. saying something is good but could be improved can hardly be characterized as "bitching". :-|
thanks for the review. i really want this set because: 1. it looks fantastic 2. has harder to find colors 3. is a 50th anniversary commemorative 4. some of the models are based on the 50s sets (i love the old stuff) the tanker truck is a perfect recreation of the old ho 1:87 scale esso tanker truck. i have one, and you can look at it for comparison if you would like. lego ho vehicles i'd like to modify the truck from this new set to look even more like the old esso truck, getting rid of the green and adding some decals.
tks will for your great review !! g after reading *vader* 's reviews (of that set and the rs) and yours i really can't wait to get that set and all of the sw sets :-p really nice photography there which is sweet !! *yoda*
thanks will! this really is a nice set! your new camera and the backround looks great, the pic quality is very good! thanks!! *y*
great review!! i still don't like that cartoon anakin though :-/ excuse me for a sec *runs to local wal-mart to check" :-d buying 08 sets on! p
thanks, guys! i have the rogue shadow in the review pipes, should be up soon. legolover100, on jan 1 2008, 07:36 pm, said: this is a brilliant review of a brilliant set! *sweet* thanks a lot! i know this may be a bit much to ask but could take some pics of the whole instruction booklet? please!!! if you can thanks a bunch. but if not do know of a place where i could find the instructions? take pics of each page? that is a lot. i don't know of anywhere that might have it. :-/ if you check *vader* 's review, he has a lot of pics of the build, that might work just as well. will
than kyou for the review. i don't know if i buy this set now i know there's also a anakin in the at-te with a new jedi, but who knows.
darn! if i would have known noone has reviewed this i would have! thanks! *sweet* *y*
thanks for the review agentrick57. it is a beautiful set, and quite cheap for me; $50 aud for 965 parts! 8-? not sure what i will do with the rabbit though; it is huge! :-d (i was considering doing this review myself but sinnerton is a mess... :-/ )
no i need it! i lost my rabbit in the great void known as the large old brown box of doom(l.o.b.b.o.d for short)!!!!! *sing* *sing*
dang it, i meant to try to get one of these after christmas ... i knew they were half-off at s@h and i just forgot. now they're sold out. darn! thanks for the review!

nice review, thanks. it still seems overpriced to me though. also, the box shows the droid torsos that are used for "feet" on the spider droid as being light bley, yet they are clearly dark bley. *wacko* tk
my hailfire droid is gonna be coming in the mail soon, as well as the battlepacks.
great review yoda. thanks for sharing. i wasn't real fond of the postal truck at first. it's so different than those in the us. but after seeing your close-up images (esp. the back of the tuck), it looks really neat. i also like the mail box a lot. it looks good in red. too bad for the stickers, but it's still nice. the plane reminds me a lot of the design used in the jurassic park set. as you've said, it's similar to 80s designs. i really like the brick-built design too. it's just real lego - that's about all i can say. very nice sets that are a must together. thanks for the review.
thanks for the great review *yoda* . i'm definitely going to get that plane, i've sadly only owned one of the many lego planes there is. :'-( thebrickster, on jan 5 2008, 11:23 am, said: i haven't spotted these in the us yet. i'm looking forward to finding them. overall, the 2008 line-up is a excellent and it's going to be difficult for me to decide which themes/sets to pursue. there's a lot to choose from. really? where do you live?
nice review yoda i dont think i have ever read one with as much cursing of stickers! :-d i love these two little sets, the colour scheme the little different wheels on the post van and of course the new postmen uniforms! would have been nice if they had included little satchels like in the new indiana jones sets, oh well! ;-) postman yoda on! *yoda*
very nice, cheers yoda! i'll definitely be getting the post van, not sure about the plane though. both are awesome, but i think i have enough planes... can you tell me though, the wheels on the van, are they rubber or plastic? they look a bit tacky...
loool : spielberg goes on a career change :-d these are some nice sets. i really love that car. looks sleek
thanks for a nice review and few comments to sets: nice airplane, finally some reminiscence for lego city golden era (for me years 1982-1992). everything is nice, but two things are freezing a smile on my face. first of all the ugly new hinge used for plane roof. i have already 4032 and those new hinges are looking really terrible when compared f.e. with 6368. second one is new minifig, i don?t know what i expected, but this torso design looks too simple and too cheap.. concerning new car - i appreciate fact, that tlc makes after long long years again postal sets, but i don?t like those new-style cars. matchbox wheels and bad rate between drivers cockpit and cargo space are damping me from buying. 6651 mail truck or 105 canada post truck were much better... edited by kanal-k1, 06 january 2008 - 07:33 pm.
5150 lego, on jan 7 2008, 06:08 am, said: and the plane.... hm. this has a "cute" factor and all, but i mean com'on... you have to open a hatch on the roof to get your packages in?? and what about getting them out? you have to flip the plane upside down? :-| weak. they should have had a hinged rear end or a hatch on the side. yes, this is the lego charming! no stairs in buildings, cars with just one minifig, all those things that make lego what it is... thanks yoda for your review! those posts sets will be mine, but i will wait to find them in my supermarket, even if i have to wait 2 or 3 months, i know that i will save some money, so i will buy more lego :-d there are simple designed sets, but we don't need more: two nice litle sets that are not oversized and too expensive.
thebrickster, on jan 5 2008, 10:12 am, said: i wasn't real fond of the postal truck at first. it's so different than those in the us. good point b... this design is just too foreign to my eyes for me to enjoy... i don't like either of these sets, very disapointing - the postal theme has so much potential. i don't really like the torsos either - too plain/cheap as kanal suggested. and i will agree that the wheels on the van look cheap. i was sooooo impressed with city 2007, this is a real let down. though, i am happy to see a small set with a postal box. so, even though, all that aside, i'll probably buy 6 of the van - just for the yellow mudgards, postal box and stickers to populate my city. and i think this set will provide some excellent piece to moc a yellow civillian convertable with *sweet* - bm
hey everyone, my first 2008 set is this one, 5613. i thought i'd share a review of it. *sweet* i'd like to say sorry about my photos, they were taken quickly. first, we have the box: it is the smallest lego box i've ever seen, and actually looks cute *wub* it will be heavy competition with playmobil's specials... back of the box, showing an action pose: the contents of the little box, with a very tiny instruction manual *wub* the manual unfolded. notice that every part has its part number beside it :-) the back of the manual, showing some fire sets and the other impulse sets the parts, 30 in total: the small set built. the firefighter has a small fire to extinquish, armed with an axe, chainsaw, other saw and foam... psssh thing x-d . five extra parts in a 30 part set! we get an extra black hatchet, yellow bar tap, light bley 1*1 plate, red 1*1 plate modified with fingers and 2*2 dark bley radar dish. besides the plate, i've never seen these as reserve parts... but i'm not complaining x-d here is a small "alternate" model i created with it: a small bbq... what? he's hungry and he needs to put something on the bbq >:-) x-d overall, you can't go wrong with these impulse sets. i paid 2.89 euros for this little set, so thats a great value! sadly the only impulse avaible were these 3 city sets (no police) and the alien mars mission... looking forward to the knight and magician as well as those indy sets! tt
darthperson8, on jan 5 2008, 11:02 pm, said: cool! finally its an entire line i can actually afford to own every set! :-d i can't wait to get my hands on them! if its possible, could you give us the demensions of the box? it would be apprectiated. *y* dp8 9.3 cm by 9.3 cm by 4.5 cm x-d tt
beach house reviewed by dunamis set 4996 522 pieces $29.95 from target build time 90 minutes yet another interesting creator theme house. this one comes fresh of the 2008 line of sets and promises 3 different models. packing 522 pieces (albeit a lot of 1x1 plates) for only $29.95 it was hard to pass this one by as i was foraging for the new 2008 star wars sets at the local target. plus, i was itching to do another review since i had finally fully recovered from my marathon ucs falcon review which took the better part a month to complete. the box: the box is pretty standard creator type box which shows off the three models (beach house, caf? and ?towering? apartment building.) the back of the box shows some of the features of the three models. interesting features of the three models prominently displayed on the back include: - food counter complete with coffee (espresso) maker and food warmer (with chicken leg!) - home office complete with laptop (and the ubiquitous coffee cup.) - flip up roof granting access inside of beach house. note the satellite tv dish and even rain gutters along the roofline! opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals. we?re back to the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets. note the parts inventory is on the side of the box as well. this is a nice feature. once inside the box, we are greeted by eight sealed bags plus two yellow 16x2 plates and a green 32x16 baseplate. thank goodness there is no dss (dreaded sticker sheet) but alas there are no minifigs. in addition, there are the three manuals (one for each model) and they were stuffed into my box with the care of kid trying to put 10 gallons (or liters if you prefer) of candy in a 5 gallon bucket. but hey, we?re not collecting manuals here so who cares if the manuals are all bent and warped? the manuals: the three manuals are 74, 72 and 48 pages in length. they are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - piece call outs for each step - parts inventory at the end of the primary model build - page numbers color separation in these manuals were fine for me. plus, we get the usual verbose lego instructions on not dumping all your pieces outside in the grass and not to dump all your pieces into a single pile. thanks for the tip, tlg! parts list the pieces: pretty standard stuff here and as i mentioned, lots of 1x1 plates and tiles (at least 100.) however, we do get quite a few windows and a couple of doors. a majority of the color is black and yellow. i did see a few pieces that i was not familiar with so i?m going to show them below. keep in mind i?m not a parts jockey so bear with me if i think a part is brand new for 2008 and it was actually released with the classic space line. 2x2 window (fixed) and 4x3 window that opens: the follow photo shows the window glass (same as in corner caf?), door glass and new black parts. turns out these black parts are used as wheels. i showed the window glass because it still contains the molding circle just like they did before. it is hard to see from the photo, but it is there. the door glass i think might be new: i don?t recall seeing these 2x2 round plates with clips before and i thought i would show the mail only because it is printed and not a sticker: i know these are common, but didn?t they have four studs on top? these only have two: how about this sloped 4x3 window that opens: overall a nice assortment of parts with nothing juniorized. the build: the build was fun and was fairly straightforward. once you figure out which of the three models to build, it goes pretty quick. here are a few shots: see how the inside is made: look at the detail with the flowers and even the outside water faucet! outdoor seating area: upstairs being built: upstairs with opening roof (notice the satellite tv dish): check out the patio on the upstairs complete with outdoor light and rain gutters! here?s my favorite, the bbq grill. at least we know where those new parts go: finally, check out the tree. no juniorization here! here is what is left over: so far, i have only built the primary model. the others look interesting, especially the caf?. the design: the design was well done. very rich in detail. i love how there are no juniorized parts. the house is accessible by taking off the top floor (like caf? corner and market street). there is an internal staircase as well. there is no interior to speak of in the beach house, but there is in the other two models. the only real negative is that it is kind of small when you get it done. it would be nice if it was about 50% bigger. here are a few views of the beach house with a few minifigs thrown in: check out the close-up of the caf? which i think looks great: also, here is a photo of the interior of the apartment building where you can see the office and computer: overall thoughts: it is a really nice set. a tad on the small side but it has some great detail and lots of features. quick enough to build all three models and would fit real nice into an existing town plan. is minifig scale, but does not come with any. lots of window parts and black slopes. is a nice diversion from the onslaught of clone wars ships that we can?t remember seeing from the movies. final rating: 84% build 9/10 (pretty quick and fun.) functionality 9/10 (it is a creator set so you have multiple varied builds. diverse enough to keep the kids entertained.) design 10/10 (excellent and well thought out. outstanding detail for such a small model.) parts 6/10 (fair, nothing earth-shattering but lots of slopes and windows.) price 8/10 (price ratio is good but you get a lot of little parts. would be better with minifigs.) edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 06:38 pm. indexed
love this set now more than ever. *wub* i knew i wanted it from the first leaked boxshots, especially with my love of yellow buildings (just ask hinckley ;-) ). great review, especially nice to see the closeup parts shots. those new 2x2 white windows are very much like replacements for the classic 2x2 windows tlg stopped regularly making a while back, so it's great to see them. the wheels are trolley wheels, common in sets including stretchers and handcarts. the holder for them is a fairly recent part i think. i remember a couple coming in a little single minifig jet engine repair set i picked up in a s@h order within the last year. oh honey, be sure to wrench that chicken before it burns! *wacko* thanks for another excellent review of a set i'm even more excited about than before! *y*
thanks for the review! i definitely plan on getting this one. thanks again! *sweet*

very nice! i have been debating on whether or not to buy it-it would appear you made up my mind for me! *y*
takuto20, on mar 22 2008, 04:54 am, said: hey, yesterday i got around to mod my beachhouse too! i bought two boxes so i could have enough material for an extra floor and then i also added a kitchen, a vine in the backyard, storage for the upper floor... try to spot the humongous flatscreen tv! http://www.brickshel...96/cimg2656.jpg very nice... i guess i should buy a second one too.... *y*
thanks for the review dunamis, this is a great little set! i'm also very impressed with takuto20's mods. i've been trying a few of my own. i liked the tower block design, but a lot of stuff needed fixing. firstly i added a 4th wall, and made it so the storeys could be lifted off like in the other models. i also added flowers on the windowsills and doorways out on to the balconies. still to be added is an extra door for the top floor which i'm going to get from the new doors and windows pack. i added a chimney that goes all the way up the back of the house, and has a fireplace on every level. each floor is fully furnished with a fireplace, wash basin and bed on the upper levels... ...and a corner sofa and coffee table, plus an extra large fireplace on the ground floor. finally here is my idea of what to do with two copies of this set! all the parts pictured are from 2x 4996, except 5 extra fence panels and the minifigs. the house on the left has it's garden at the rear.
1. before buying even if i am city fan, those new sized planes are really not mine cup of tea, my love to lego is firmly frozen somewhere between years 1980-1995. main reason to buy was, that i wanted to write a review at czech afol web kostky.org. i bought it three days ago via web advertising, price was +- 35 usd. 2. after opening the box as presumed, some very big parts and three bags, and as an additional bonus lot of danish air free of charge. first sight told me, that this will be really short and easy building.. 3. impressions during building ...and it was really true. 30 minutes of lazy building. bag 1 - plane. bag 2 - plane gondols with supports. bag 3 - wings and propellers. when i saw the way, how is this plane made, i was strongly thinking to play money for nothing from dire straits as a music accordant with whole set. 4. impressions after building - lookout juniorized creeps. this is my first plane in this scale and for 99% the last one. lack of details, lot of ugly big parts, from whole set you can see the main development target - to keep rrp at some certain low level. inner space of airplane absolutely undone, no details, no luggage, no computers, nothing at all!! just a lot, lot of air! the very only details in whole plane are the stickered pilots desk and some kind of seat constuction. 5. impressions after building - playability but, what is playability at this set? hydroplane, which cannot float (as seen on enclosed photos) ? if tlc will make some new kind of big parts used for gondolas, to make the plane floating, they will for sure make no other damage. juniorization couldn?t be higher. you even cannot drive across the carpet with the plane. so, how to play? open the doors, open the cabin part, and turn with propellers? weak, weak, weak! 6. resumed impressions sadly i must say, that at limited release sets tlc? boat seems to sailing to the worst part of the coast. after quite good 7344, perfect 7899 and 7900, strange, but acceptable 7998, juniorization came back with 7906, followed with this ugly playmobilized 7732. 7. final word in fact, even 15 usd seems to be too much for this kind of set. 35 usd, expected rrp in our country, is really overpriced to hell. neither set, nor minifig is not interesting. tlc maybe knows about juniorization as well, as nowhere on the box the number of pieces isn?t written. if you my afol friends want to spent your bucks, better give half of the price to african orphans. you will save your money, and you will have a good feeling! all the photos you can see below, as i cannot upload onto this topic due to some limit.. http://www.kostky.or...c=15954.new#new edited by kanal-k1, 16 january 2008 - 10:32 pm.
review gets *y* *y* , ugly plane gets :-x. thanks for the review!
thanks for the review, but its an utter pass for me on this one - i already have a huge juniorized plane from the airport set - one is enough for me! :-$
am i the only that one that thinks it is not so bad???????????????????????what i am trying to say is wouldn't planes be this big in real life???i know it has a lot of big pieces but how would they make them any smaller,or how would they the big pieces into a bunch of tiny pieces?well any way i do think in some cases that if there is any "juniorized" involved it should be with duplo. complaning off
thks for this caustic review :-d i'll wait for the parts on bricklink. i think you're a bit unfair with this small oversized submarine - oups sorry, i mean plane. here are some advantages i tried to imagine : 1. that's the first submarine with a plane nose, 2. that's the first unprinted nose, 3. that's the first shark that make me laugh, and which has a plain white fin 4. and at last, you should have notice that that the first submarine with a wing made of several plates it is said that this set has more than 200 parts... hide and seek ! x-d you may have lost several bags i'm eager that people buy this set a lot : i'd like to buy a lot of these new white 4x4x2 curved slope for my mocs. can you take a picture of the plane crashing in the sink ? is it fire proof ? i think that will be too easy this year to decide what is the crap of year ...
sinner, on jan 17 2008, 04:48 pm, said: this picture sums it all up and is quite symbolic.... going down to davy-jones' locker for good. just pull the plug out of your bathtub. but wait... it won't fit through the drain because it's too big :-( come on, they could have at least put one tiny little seat inside that horrible fuselage! :-x :-x
thanks for the review, unfortunately the pictures did not load for me! i have to say having seen other images, i do agree with your comments, the plane is far to big, and not enough details. that sums it up for me!
i'll probably get the nice green cargo plane. but not this. how can the same hull pieces be used for full size jets and what's supposed to be a small seaplane.
legoman132, on sep 11 2008, 06:26 pm, said: this still looks like a cool set but the price not so much. the price is now €20 in ireland on s@h, which is reasonable considering the large fuselage pieces. has anyone modded this set to make a reasonable looking plane? i am thinking of buy it to do so, but i don't want to take a risk and end up with lots of useless pieces. aswell as -€20.
an excellent first time (?) review iamded! *y* well, atleast a first time redman review anyway. i really enjoy redman, i hope to see him pop up more often. your pics are great now that you ditched the phone :-p , and you've shown the set from many different angles and perspectives. thanks for this brilliant review, you have certainly convinced me to get a few of these, and then some x-d redman on! edit: btw, is it just me, or does my new avatar make me seem a bit creepy? 8-| batbrick is back! >:-) edited by batbrick, 18 january 2008 - 12:39 pm.
great review iamded! lots of pics, all the details. wish i could find some of these sets locally, but so far no luck. :'-( i fully intend to steal your use of a character to do the reviewing, should i ever do one like this. x-d oh, and if eb news presents ever needs someone to do a commercial, we'll be sure to get in touch with you. *y* batbrick, on jan 18 2008, 07:36 am, said: btw, is it just me, or does my new avatar make me seem a bit creepy? 8-| are you sure it's the avatar doing it? 8-| :-d ;-)

you should continue with these redman reviews there great!!!
thanks everyone for your positive feedback, it's really appreciated! :-d you'd be surprised how long that 'redman presents' thing up the top took me to make! x-d so, it appears people do like redman, expect him to be reviewing the good wizard and battle arachnoid in near future! (i know those have already been reviewed, but new zealand never gets sets first, so i'll just be reviewing the sets i get. x-d) thefrisian, on jan 19 2008, 04:44 am, said: nice review, very detailed. *y* as for the spare parts, mine didn't come with any. both dark grey 1x1 round plates are used on the weapons rack (one for the armour, one for the helmet) and i only got one robot hand for holding weapons. that's strange, maybe i'm just lucky. x-d i also got 2 spare orange viking horn pieces in my battle arachnoid. :-d ~peace
i would have purchased a few of these except for the fact that i do not like the new torso that they use.
thanks for the review *vader*! the first picture of the troll is great, the gold armour really shines! x-d a fantastic set, i'll definitely get a couple of these! *wub* as for the ogres/'giant trolls', the dark tan one fits in the mine setting well, but for above ground, settings, i prefer the sand green one. *y* ~peace edited by iamded, 19 january 2008 - 10:21 am.
batbrick, on jan 19 2008, 01:19 am, said: one pic request, if you have time vader, could you please post a few pics of the new helmet on its own, and on a human soldier please? batbrick is back! >:-) here you go: front: side: back: *vader*
thanks for that vader, i love this helmet *wub* it will certainly work great as an asian dynasty war helm i reckon. thanks again. batbrick is back! >:-)
great review, vader :-) as i've said before, this is a nice set, but doesn't really come with anything that doesn't come with the other sets of the line. for this reason, it will be somewhere at the bottom of my list for 2008. also, i like torso and helmet of the dwarf mining orcs much better. the colours make the torso look rather dull and boring, while the other, more brown one, looks much clearer and more exciting. i think i like the *knight* helmet better too, looks more covering and threatening than this one, although i'll save my judgement until i have one in my hands. thanks again vader ;-) edit: forgot to mention, hilarious pic in your sig, vader :-d edited by tinypiesrus, 19 january 2008 - 08:28 am.
thanks for the review! i love this set! it's a cheap way to get green trolls, and i love the new helmet, it looks great and i think it will be very usefull for other factions as well. *sweet* dnl
tks for the review mate ;-) now i have to bloody wait long because lego france has this line available in freaking march >:-( pissed *yoda* on !! :-d i love the "new" goblin :-p that helmet is really cool. why on earth tlc didn't include that one in the dwarf mine ? such another idiotic move |-/ anyone keeping track of tlc's stupidity lately ? that would be interesting !! i clearly want a huge goblin army now hehe !! and i totally agree with you mate, the troll lokks better in sand green. the cart itself is pretty lame imo - just a sordid excuse to include yet another annoying shooting crappy device. but for a 21? set its okie i say ;-) need my bad guys on !! *yoda*

ricecracker, on jan 21 2008, 05:28 pm, said: hey, thanks for the review the brickster! i was just wondering if you could possibly upload a picture of the instructions for the forklift, and, if possible, tell me the piece # of the 1x4 slope bricks (to bricklink them). thanks! i don't have a scanner for the instructions, but the 1x4 slope is listed as piece #4515362 in the instructions.

well, since no-one seems to have done one for this set, here we go.... here's the complete set in all its glory. yes, i really like it, but then, tabletown has the capacity to support it and my green army have their eyes on it as a potential military transport as well. :-) i'll start out with the little airport ground car thingy - very neat and functional, here are views front and back: next up, the steps which allow the plane crew to embark and disembark: and to round off this little trio, the cargo loading platform, here in its lowered position. note the prong thingy sticking out from the rear: and here raised. the prong thingy is now hinged up to support the back of the platform and keep it level: here's a slightly different angle so you can see the pieces under there: the all-important cargo itself! hmmm...not much for a plane this size... the cargo pallet slots neatly onto the loading platform: here's the complete set of ground equipment - all attached: and so onto the plane itself. note that unlike the other large planes, the main wing sits at the top of the row of bricks making up the side of the fuselage: i took it apart a little so you can see the internal construction of the fuselage. note that the cargo area is really small, right at the back. what else is this thing carrying? illegal immigrants? :-) a picture of the rear of the fuselage, just because i like the sticker: front landing gear. way better than on the other large planes. i don't know if this is a new piece or what but i've had no problems with it at all, and my kids have been playing with it as well: the rather sexy rear undercarriage - this area reminds me of one of those giant russian transport planes - wicked: those angled grey slopes atop each side of the rear undercarriage annoy the heck out of me as they keep coming off whenever i pick the plane up. i think a 1x4 plate on top to bind them together might solve that. a slightly blurry view (sorry) from underneath. the gear looks like it might be capable of retracting internally, but alas, no. this is a shame as there's certainly enough room in there and it's a wasted opportunity imo. might have to modify that... a view of one of the four engines, i personally think they look too small and should have something under the wing as well to make them rounder: cockpit: crew door, open. i love the smooth action of these doors and the way they seal flush against the fuselage when closed: cargo door, open: crew door with docked ladder: cargo door with docked loading platform: cargo slots inside and locks into place the same way it sits on the loader, neat: the minifigs, sorry this one is a bit blurry: and that concludes this week's "show and tell". dr. s.
lt. veers, on feb 4 2008, 11:42 pm, said: i do admit the amount of cargo is rediculously small, but it still looks good. say, how much can the plane hold? thanks for the review! *sweet* that's all the space you get. now, it might be possible to rip out that rear bulkhead at the back of the wing and fill the middle area with tiles so cargo pallets could slide up the fuselage. but that would definitely prevent the undercarriage folding internally if that's what you wanted to do as well. dr. s.

thanks for the review, i like the looks of the set but i'm not sure about it still. is it work ?35? would you recomend buying it?
if i do end up geting this set it will be for my slowly growing army. btw nice review *y*
supremecommmandergrievous, on feb 9 2008, 11:32 am, said: i have noticed that at my local tlc store (orlando) they have this set in a glass case on display...with the cw anakin head on indy. i did not realize this was such i widespread problem. i saw this review on s@h.... quote "in lego world we're all detail conscious, right? our set(really my 8-yr-old son's) came with the wrong head for indiana jones! thin eyebrows, no five o'clock shadow, lots of red scars...really hard for him to get into the character. everything else is great - especially the falling wall and snake trap!" i might get this set today. i hope i dont have this problem! 8-| dp8
i got mine today! x-d i too got an anakin clone wars head, although i'm not really complaining since i already have an indy head from the motorcycle chase set. it is really odd that they would pack in such a different looking head though. also, for those that think the head has no use, try placing it under one of the braided new brown dwarf beards. it looks pretty nice, i think! *y* on the set, it's wonderful! the hieroglyphic stickers are wonderful, marion (especially her head and hair) is wonderful, and the anubis statues are nice too. there's also lots of nice tan parts, such as 20 round 2x2s, and 8 1x8 bricks. all in all, it's a great set for the price, and i can't wait to get race for the stolen treasure and temple escape now! *sweet*
hello and welcome to another, oh wait, first batbrick and iamded review! today us two sworn enemies will be reviewing the creator cargo chopper, here is the front of the box: and while pushing iamded to his doom, here is the back: haha! ouch! oh dear...here are the parts anyway... here is the instruction of the first model, the cargo chopper. i love creator sets for the different models, they always excite me. just ignore me finishing off my nemesis in the background. something very interesting that i liked in the instructions was this step where you must add those three 2x2 yellow rounded pieces under the chopper. this is for support while you build, which is handy, and later you take it off: and even later use it as the cargo. i found that to be rather innovative and clever, as well as - hey! what are you hitting me for? both instruction booklets have the same back: now heres the chopper itself. i love the design of it, it isn't quite minifig scale but its great all the same. this is my first non-xpod or house creator set, and it sure is fun. here me and iamded go for a dizzy ride. i love the nose of the copter, and the landing gear is fantastic. a shot from the other side. oh dear, it seems we've been a bit sick from that ride, and were vomiting transgreen 1x1s. the cargo itself is nicely made, though i forgot to put on two tiles here :-$ . it fits in real well with the chopper to, and the line is great for giving iamded the wedgie he deserves: this is my first power function set, so i was pretty excited. the motor is intergrated really well into this set, and is activated by pushing that little 3x2 plate with the 1x1 slopes on it forward, until it hits the motor button, that orange knob. another point of interest is the use of bley barrels on each side. i like this as i don't have those pieces in that colour. a shot of the motor. its really simple, all you do is pull the hook out to any length that allows, then press the orange button and it will wind it back up. this makes the chopper pull the cargo up into its bay, and iamded pull me here reluctantly to a whacking: a top view, is that my head? a view of the chopper without the cargo in it. i love the lowered cockpit: the leftover pieces from building: (note: iamded's head does not count as set piece) and a final shot of the set with me and iamded. oh, it appear we're dead, oh dear... hope you enjoyed this review, soon i will post the two alternate models. i loved this chopper, its great to play with and has nice construction. it also has some handy pieces too. the motor function sounds like a gimmick but is well intergrated into this model. well worth the price, so far this is another win for creator i say! so far i recommend this model, but later we'll see if the alt models are up to scratch. also, since this is my first review, comments and criticism welcome on everything. batbrick away! >:-) edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 06:37 pm. indexed
great review, batbrick! iamded got what he deserved. x-d
thank you very much for a fine review, batbrick. *y* what the.... i never realized these cool grey barrels till now.... that?s pretty interesting. :-) the whole chopper looks very good, with a well fitting power function. it?s for sure a rewardable work to change that baby into a real mf version with accessible cockpit. :'-)
i am definitely getting this set. thanks for the nice review!
congrats to that nice review.... i like the batcave set, you should also been able to find it at discount....
thanks for the review aayla, i love this set and its great to see another person interested in batman. now all you have to do is start watching the movies, then the cartoon series, then the comics, then the......... x-d i really recommend two-face's escape as well, a great set for a great price. and btw, the green dude as you call him is named killer croc, he is a killer with a freakish skin condition. batbrick away! >:-)
6258 smuggler's shanty overview smuggler's shanty was released in 1992, it consisted of 69 pieces, 3 minifigs (two pirates, one imperial) and it cost $9.25 (usd). the set itself is a small but rather sturdy den for the pirates! review: the minifigs consist of two pirates and one imperial. the minifigs are not all that rare, which is disappointing, i would of liked a rarer fig! but still it is a good cheap source of pirate and imperial figures. here is an overall shot of the set, which includes the three figs, the shanty which is made using palm leaves pieces, and a nice grey shark nibbling at the soldier's oar. a close up of the soldier rowing hard in his boat. i would have preferred to have a normal soldier with shako hat, as i have more officers than normal soldiers now!: and a close up snap of the main structure. note the wine glass, which was a nice touch! funnily enough, only 4 pieces of treasure were included in this set, compared to the usual 8 gold coins in other sets. a view from the back, which also gives a good view of the pieces used to construct the shanty mainly simple black 1 by 1 bricks: the shanty looks good from most angles but their are a few where the roof construction looks rather odd, but that is just a minor nitpick! yet another view from the front,, this time at a slightly different angle. the yellow base plate looks rather nice too, i prefer it over the tan pieces we trend to get nowadays: "attack!!" the stupid drunk pirate in the background does not even notice! overall i think this is a rather good set, despite some shortcomings, such as the lack of treasure and odd roof from some angles. the shark, imperial soldier and useful parts make up for it, and of course the price is cheap on most auction sites, i got mine for a mere ?5 ($10), with the cheapest price on bricklink being $8. rate the set then leave your comments, thoughts and opinions!!!
great little set! i bought this set only a few years ago misb and i am still very happy about it. the hut is simple but very effective as a castaway building on some deserted island, the palmleaves are a good addition to any lego collection. this set had a nice amount of weapons, two for each pirate and two of those weapons are flintlock muskets as opposed to just pistols. nice poll as well, but you made sure nobody can give this set a 1 which is very nice (but probably a little mistake :-d ). i gave it the top-rating. *y*
great small set that can help you add to you minifig count. the little boats are always cool, and the den isn't that bad either.
another first-rate review! it's a nice little set with a big number of minifigs. and 2 flintlock guns is also a nice bonus.
first of all excellent review! 5/5 for me. i have yet to attain one of these sets. it has a nice trio of men including a redcoat, and a nice assortment of weapons. the rest, such as the leaves, is great for mocing. imperialshadows, on feb 19 2008, 08:41 pm, said: i gave it a 4 out of 5, just because i'd buy 4 out of 5 sitting on the shelves today, were it possible. if i saw 5 of these sitting on a shelf i would certainly buy all 5, then i would ask to speak with a manager to see if there is any way i can attain more pirate lego stuff. simonwillems, on feb 19 2008, 08:47 pm, said: nice poll as well, but you made sure nobody can give this set a 1 which is very nice (but probably a little mistake :-d ). i gave it the top-rating. one should not step into the pirates domain and give a mere 1 to any non4+ pirate set. duke
a nice review and a nice little set for anyone's pirate collection. a 5/5 for the review.
tks for that nice review, brainbox! i recieved the construction diggers set like this last year. gee what a nice parts pack. i like that orange lidded set, the truck. so nice. i won't get it though.
ricecracker, on feb 19 2008, 06:39 pm, said: why not? they are all very nice (i have all six of them), especially the helicopter, my least anticipated, but one of the most detailed!! thanks for the review brainbox!! well, i shall wait until it goes for $1.25 on my s@h, than buy it with a load of other sets. plural, on feb 19 2008, 07:25 pm, said: thanks for the review brainbox. *sweet* these look really nifty* i might pick up a couple of these as for the parts, i'm sure they could come in handy for something. and so cheap as well. i still miss x-pods though. :'-( *do the kids still say nifty these days? *wacko* eurobrickers do, that's for sure!
thanks for that very fine review, brainbox! *y* lovely little creator goodies, with very neat alternative models as well. :'-)
brainbox, on feb 20 2008, 02:55 pm, said: you're welcome guys. :-d sorry, that just made me laugh. i did some research and re-read tyour review. i will pick this up this weekend. quote yeah, so do i. they really were a neat idea. i had all the x-pods. they were awesome. i haven' collected all of these though.
great review, pictures and all! thanks for showing all the mechanisms of the tower, i didn't notice them from either the pics we had or the instructions--it didn't hit me that when you knock down the wall the second floor breaks. that is a genius idea. this looks like a superb set, unfortunately my priority right now is the troll warship. still, if that really is u.s. $80, i might skip it and go for this instead, which is only $20 us. one note, though. i think there might not be a back cage on the second floor of the tower so that the mechanism can work. did you try to see if the second floor ground still falls if you add it a fourth cage wall? also, you could just pretend that the tower is built against a mountainside. it would fit perfectly and add more defense to the knights. great review! :-) vk
tks for those so much!! :'-) *y* nice reviews! i love that tower raid, and the defender, and will buy them both. quote really don't add much to the set: oh, but they do. more pieces= higher price. ;-)
thanks for these fantastic review. it's the first time i take a good look at these sets. there is a good chance i'll buy the dwarf's mine defender, especially for that price.
thank you for these fine reviews, metalandi. *y* there?re really some nice playable features in the tower raid set, and all these great orc torsos, just sweet! and it even looks like that black orc-armor?s a new piece, lovely.... :'-)
cheers for the reviews. they're both nice sets, and i think i just may have to buy both. or maybe i'll get two of the dwarf set? the figs in each are really cool as well. the dwarf, well, they're just cool anyway, but the troll with the golden helmet and armour, that's just *wub*
thanks metalandi! these are 2 great sets, i'm definately looking forward to seeing these in new zealand stores! the collapsing floor/prisoner freeing mechanism on the tower is wonderful, a great touch. some slight modifications, like, some walls, will make this perfect. and the dwarf's mine defender is a sweet little set, with some neat minifigs. thanks for the reviews! *y* ~peace
thanks for the review, i personally think the siege tower is probably the best one which lego has ever produced.
well you didn't say anything wrong yet undead army officer i perfer using the batle wheel to knock down the tower's walls, not the seige tower
yeah, the open towers are kinda funny, although they were also typical of (for instance) 90s pirate sets. the trolls' vehicles are cool though. they look evil. i can't wait to start collecting '08 castle sets...(i didn't buy any castle in '07, i only got one set for xmas, so i'm catching up on the '07 stuff first before it's all sold out)
they're so beautiful... 4 more months.
wow! that's a great review i'm glad you took so many pictures, this set is far better than i ever expected it to be, the detail inside is great. is it the first set you'e given 100% to?
this is a nice review, thanks for all the great pictures!
truly an awesome review. thanks dunamis. i ordered my two copies (one to build, one to store in the "vault") last week. can't wait to get this one! the attention to detail here is what makes the set great. there's nothing to criticize about this set. it's really the closest thing to perfection that i have seen from tlc. the difference between this set and cc is the interior detail, and because of that, gg now become (in my opinion) the best set ever released by tlc. do the cc/gg/ms sets fit well with the 50th anniv. town plan? my impression is that out of the box, at least, they don't. which is too bad. however, i don't think it would be hard to mod the town plan so it looks like it belongs in the same town as cc/gg/ms. these sets, to me, are what i have always wanted from tlc as an adult. i hope they keep up the line, and add more elements to this excellent lineup.
thanks for all the feedback. as you can tell, i really enjoyed building it. cardinal brick, on mar 8 2008, 09:26 am, said: is it the first set you'e given 100% to? yes, it is. i gave cafe corner a 96% and i felt this was a better set and improved on the things that i dinged cafe corner on (lack of minifigs was one thing.) that's why i enjoy reading the comments so i can see if my ratings are in line with what everyone else thinks and to see if i missed anything. i can't wait for some of you to build it and share your thoughts as well.
a very fine review with great and informative pictures, thanks dunamis! *y* and what a wonderful set, a masterpiece and far beyond everything i would?ve expected just one year ago.... the amount of details is exceptional, from the different railings to the mousehole and the radiator.... sheer brilliant. :'-) and two female mfs (or hippies, you never know....) and a child.... only one adult male character who nearly looks like.... well, anyways. it?s simply a milestone, and a very creative and inspiring beauty. *wub* easter parade on! and, sweet gg.... will you marry me? :-$
thank you sooo much for this amazing review dunamis! i absolutly adore this set and you've review has prompted me to certainetly start saving! (i have a bit left over form christmas that will come in handy! :-d ) i love the little fridge downstairs, the fire escape and the mouse hole, alot more good ideas that we can all use in creating our own buildings! this line is by far my favorite lego line ever! (yes even beats starwars, but only just ;-) ) hooray for dunamis! x-d
thanks for another fun review! this set is high on my list of things to buy, i love cranes, built many and bought many including the classic 8460 from 1995 and the more recent 8421. that threaded axle never stopped intriguing me... it was use in so few sets (i believe 8851 contained one as well?) and i still don't know why it's better than any other axle. congratulations with a near mint copy of this set! :-)
simonwillems, on mar 10 2008, 01:32 pm, said: that threaded axle never stopped intriguing me... it was use in so few sets (i believe 8851 contained one as well?) and i still don't know why it's better than any other axle. the purpose of the threaded axle is to carry tension. regular axles are used primarily for carrying torsion (for gears), sometimes for compression (8855 landing gear, helicopter skids), and sometimes just for looks (roll cages, canopies). but used in tension, connectors will usually just pop off. with the threads and the corresponding nuts, this part can be used to squeeze parts together (like the pen in the plotter of 8094), or to hold heavy assemblies onto turntables (like 8862 and 8851). with the power crane (8854) reviewed here, that is the complete list of sets which used this part. i wrote about it here: http://www.ericalbre...1984.html#parts eric

thank you very much for that review!
i bought it some years ago for the b-model, and like it so much :d
this was my first pneumatic set
yeah. if i rebuild and wash a model i will record it. glad to see you liked it!
thanks! you've just motivated me to go on a "senseless-preliminary-design-errors-hunt"...! a few things i've discovered: left side (alternate model): the steering link can only be put in place with a little violence... the handlebar (?) is turned (far more than it's actually possible) although the wheels are straight. right side: the 1x8 tile simonwillems pointed out the half bush right next to it is... *can't_find_the_words* ..."wrong". could be that the technic triangle is missing. the "windscreen"- 1x6 technic plates are mounted with 1/2 pins instead of axle pins with half bushes. who can find more...? x-d
natelite, on mar 10 2008, 05:57 pm, said: hmm, seems like the wheels are recycled into the harley truck in the 2008 batman set! nope. the harley-truck-wheels are thinner and somewhat more modern. i do believe they're the same like in 8274. aaaaaaaand: for a long time in my life these wheels have been the best and coolest looking i've ever had! so where's your deference? :-d recycled... |-/ x-d
wow, that first picture is great! you must have a very wide angle lens with the capability to focus very close (macro). the perspective makes the model look huge. nice work. i think the suspension on this set is my favorite of all technic. it has such large travel and is so.... what word should i use..... "bouncy". hey, why do you only review sets which are red? :-d eric
blakbird, on mar 10 2008, 09:35 pm, said: hey, why do you only review sets which are red? :-d i exactly thought that today as i made the pics for my signature...! x-d at my school leaving examination i made a model in blender3d and explained to the board of examiners how to build a car and how to animate it. it needed a color, so i took red "because all beautiful and fast cars are red..." my physics teacher contradicted. :-)

i also happened to receive this set this weekend, virtually misb (the seals on the side of the box were loose, however everything inside was untouched). this little beast a joy to build and even more so to play with! as indicated by eric on the technicopedia page, it's crammed with functions for a medium-sized set. i think i love it even more than my son does
that price is exceptional. it's less than what i paid for mine 9 years ago, and is even less than the original price of the set. note that the stickers in this set are the bad variety that will crack and peel over time. if you want to preserve them (the technic flag in particular), you will need to tape over it.
my friend has this set and the alien ship's wings are wobbly and overall :-x he may have built it wrong, i'm not sure, i didn't see the build. anyways, nice review! *y*
sweet first pic review! *y* i got this set for a birthday present last year, and it is pretty fun overall. the alien ship in this set is actually one of my favorites. it just looks cool, and the way you can fold it out is really clever. the only negative for me is the cockpit of the mining unit. not really because it isn't detailed, but because mine is top heavy, and keeps falling forward. it's kinda funny if you think about him driving along and then falling forward...but not funny at all when you're playing. |-/
thank you for your nice review, vbbn! *y* but it only confirms: this theme is not my cup of tea. weird aliens, strange colors, parts stuck together with no idea. :-| i always hated this big wheels - it?s even worse in orange. :-x saving money for different sets on! (and that doesn?t mean it was a bad review ;-) )
thanks for the review! i do like this set, though i am not a fan of the jelly aliens, though the alien ship looks good with the curved parts and flip open and close design!
great review! thanks for taking the time. i'm glad to see another reviewer out there as there are a lot of sets to cover. nicely done.
a very good review with fine and informative pictures, and a really nice set, thanks, bernddasbrot. *sweet* hmm, i really wish that tlc would make some steerable cars within the system line too....
hello all apologize for digging out a such old post. recently i got a bag of lego technic parts where there have been mixed three sets: 8858, 8829 and 8235 the resurrection of 8858 has been described by me in a separate post. going back to the dune buggy – when i saw it for the first time back in 1994 i did not like it, as i was always big fan of 8840 (which i consider to the day the best looking buggy) and set 8829 looked to me ugly. so there were those all parts in the bag… then i though why not build it ? and i started to do it. when i finished i was very surprised how the final look of this set is! really taking my words back. unfortunately in the bag there were missing some parts and i could not rebuild the back spoiler. so i made some changes to it and make it from spare parts that i have and it came out acceptable. i also added some additional parts such as “fake” steering wheel, “rally” logo, antennas. i have also reverse mounting of the rear tires – why lego did them like that i never know – as i think they look better this way. set: well the review has been already made by owner of this post so i will only add few things into it. engine – v2 (aired cooled?) is driven by 4 gears -> from the single wheel (no differential as in 8840) using two old school z14 tooth bevel , then by z24 tooth crown and z8 tooth type 1. actually the (as in most old sets) the pistons are moving very fast (not as in current sets) and smooths – i needed to extra clean all engine parts as there was a lot friction. suspension – set has “engine bay” working using two old gray shock absorbers 6,5l – the movement is not big but works very nice, better then in 8840 in my opinion. steering – this is a bit odd as there is no direct connection to hog as in most old sets, but first the gear rack is moved by z8 then two z14 tooth where reverse movement is taking place. later connection of two old school z14 tooth bevel goes to hog details – this is the most that i like in this set, specially how the use of axle pin connector perpendicular and 1x10 bricks with 3x3 cut corners and plate 1x5 toothed ends 2 studs with center axle hole are making the body shape – is just wonder. tires – the balloon rear are pretty nice the front is a new version of those that were in 8840. what i do not like: 1. missing of technic figure (8840 had it.) 2. no steering wheel in the original set 3. no differential – but having in mind that lego has introduce 24-12 teeth would be difficult to build the transmission in such small space where the engine is. i will shortly upload new pictures and post them here later on . over all – i think it is worth buying it as it is very payable ! actually very payable and runs smoothly , the steering, suspension – perfect thank you and regards
can't wait to get me one of those!!

i'm sorry, but your review has only served to further enlighten me that these sets are a pile of cack! absolutely lazy design and the only reason i'd get one is for the windscreen so i can build a proper landspeeder from star wars... m.

matn, on mar 23 2008, 06:39 am, said: thanks for the review, i think i'll certainly get these sets. they look very nice and have nice minfigs (i love racing, as long as minifigs could sit in them). the fact that there are so much stickers make me think this is an model building theme, like when you build plastic cars (with all those tiny pieces and a load of stickers). but that 's'-shaped thingy does already exist, doesn't it? you're welcome matn! sinner, on mar 23 2008, 06:55 am, said: the more i see these sets the more i want them... but i fear a $40 aud pricetag... :-/ oh my computer is fast enough, but even fast internet in australia is slow. :-| thanks very much for going to the huge effort of re-uploading the pictures. *sweet* yes, i have a few of them. great pieces too! *wub* you're welcome sinner, it wasn't that time consuming. ;-) it's times like these that i'm glad i live in the u.s. of a! x-d oh sure, blame it on where you live. :-p i didn't know the s-shaped pieces already exsisted. :-$ they're new to me. brainbox, on mar 23 2008, 09:28 am, said: i don't think i've seen them in a set for years though. it's good to see them back. but... 32 stickers? that's more than any of the first wave of ef ever had! still, the set itself is very nice, with some nifty new pieces, and the minifigs are pretty cool too. i may not be familiar with speed racer, but i still may get this. i'll go and see the film as well, to fill in the background (of the set). i agree, there are way too many stickers! i'm not that familiar either with speed racer. :-$ exobuilder, on mar 23 2008, 09:31 am, said: yay, finally! thanks for the great review. it confirmed that i am most definately getting these *wub* the orange racer is absolutley beautiful! once again, awesome review! *sweet* you're welcome exobuilder! i *wub* the orange-yness of so's racer too. on another note, the review of set 8159: racer x vs taejo will be up shortly... so stay tuned... general tarful edited by generaltarful, 24 march 2008 - 01:43 am.

i don't even see why you reviewed this set... it didn't tell us anything that isn't perceivable from the box, being so simple. though i do appreciate the effort.
big or small we all love our legos, and for that i thank you for the review. i would have had liked to see your opinions though, about the price, the playability, or anything else you'd care to share about it and perhaps how it fits with your collection. i've always been hesitant about getting this set because to me i feel like i have it all already, but i'm missing that dog, radar gun and, 50 mph sign :-/

when i went to blue water they have dogs in the pick a brick wall so i have plenty! ;-) yes i think i have everything here thats why i havent baught this, the fireman, or the construction worker, they need to bring out something unique.
a very neat and useful little set, thank you for the nice review. *sweet*
thanks for the review. it looks beautiful. my father was a backhoe driver, so understandably i used to drool over this set in the catalogs. i never did get it though as lego was so expensive in australia then; i had around 2000 pieces and i thought i had loads! :-d anyway, last year i bought 8455, which i love; it works great with a compressor i made too! *sweet* i wish mine had a real cab though... :'-( do you have 8455 as well? i'd love to see how they compare side by side... it looks bigger than 8455 but i don't own any of the big old chuncky tires so i find it so hard to tell. by the way, i have been reading all of your reviews but i have been a bit busy of late so i haven't had time to comment. i hope you have more planned; any chance of a supercar one?
another nice review. the slow shutter speed pictures are great. i think that was the only set with 8 distinct functions for a very long time and was only displaced by the 8455 backhoe in that respect. the turntable on the back doesn't turn very well though, as the weight is all distributed on one side. the screw axle prevents it from popping off but there is still a lot of friction in it. i don't have mine built anymore but it might be worth trying to put a weight brick or something on it. quote do you have 8455 as well? i'd love to see how they compare side by side... it looks bigger than 8455 but i don't own any of the big old chuncky tires so i find it so hard to tell. yeah, it's quite a bit bigger. when everything is fully extended, it becomes something like 26" long. although the 8455 actually has more/better functionality. edited by cp5670, 24 march 2008 - 08:15 am.
bernddasbrot, on mar 24 2008, 05:08 pm, said: there are ~324 axle nuts on bricklink with an avg price of $0.89. but i wants it cheap! *sing* and i would still call 324 quite rare. and i also want to just tack it onto another order. *sad*
yeah, i meant they're rare. ;-) but i can imagine that a normal axle with the old half bushes will help. sometimes these are really strong; if you put 2-3 in a row? edit: i just tried it: a normal 10l axle with 2 interlocking old half bushes type 1 on each end. (i chose those who only can be moved very hardly along an axle.) i slewed the bjst / back arm a few times tried the pneumatics parallel to it and it didn't loose. edited by bernddasbrot, 24 march 2008 - 06:06 pm.
thanks! *sweet*
quote how long of a shutter speed did you use? 15 seconds. quote by the way, don't forget to build the alternate model of 8862. i will review it too and post it in this topic! quote "slewed"? i think that's a word. how about "slewn" or "slain" or "slewifacated"? i think "rotated" is best. actually i took it from your site! x-d quote white is pretty rare. unfortunately i don't own 8480 but i think 8824 is also a very good (though small) white set! 8462 rocks as a blue set. i just got it a few weeks ago. let's see... 8462 also is one of the last technic sets i would call old-school. 8479... okay too, but 8458 is imho not. 8868 and the totally mysteriously black set will follow...! quote i was thinking you could somehow attach a 16-tooth dark gray gear (the one that spins freely around axles) to the nut, which would make the axle move in and out when the gear turned and convert the gear's rotary motion to linear motion in a fairly compact package. did you had something like this in mind? if the toothed 10l axle rotates the axle nuts want to rotate too but they can't because of that 2x4 technic plate. so they'll decide to move along the axle. the 1x6 bricks on each end make sure that the axle won't move in or out. thanks for your feedback!
blakbird, on mar 25 2008, 06:42 pm, said: wow, that's a long exposure. i would think you would get way too much light and overexpose the image. the aperture must have been tiny. for the aperture i don't know what i've used, but my room was already very darkend as i tool the photos. it was actually serendipity. ;-) blakbird said: cool. i am also planning to write about the combine on technicopedia. i will but i'll need some time. i really shoud do a few things for university (that's also the reason why i succeded in so many other things... :-| ) blakbird said: you don't own 8480? that is unacceptable. it is imperative that you put a mortgage on your house immediately to get it! not again!!! *sing* (just kidding. my parents will. x-d ) blakbird said: while the assembly you have drawn would work as a linear actuator, i would not recommend it. the torsional stiffness and strength of an axle are proportional to the polar moment of inertia, a section property. most of the stiffness comes from the outside of the cross shaped axle. but in the threaded axle, you lose all the stiffness of the outer area because it is not continuous. this means you only get stiffness and strength from the small core. i think the threaded axle would bend and break very easily if subjected to much torque. the toothed 10l axle doesn't look very robust, you're right. on brickshelf i once saw another version using a worm gear and a halfbush being moved along another axle. edited by bernddasbrot, 28 march 2008 - 05:12 pm.
i'm very sorry for that doublepost... i made a picture for you, sinner, but forgot to upload it: your dad, patrick parrot, driving a giant backhoe. sadly his second job as photojournalist and the fact that bianca lamb was strolling by, distracted him. as a consequence he spoiled the whole construction site bringing death and doom with a technic backhoe to fabuland. and a little walrus baby. *y* :-p
thanks for another classic review! man, i wish i had this set. the shovels should have been black though.
this is a review of speed racer set 8159 raxer x vs taejo. this is my second review and the first review of this paticular set and the only one on eurobricks... at the moment x-d so without further ado i present to you my review... (i like that saying so much i decided to use it again in this review, it's originally from my review of 8158, which can be seen here.) note: sorry that this review got delayed, but there was a hostile takeover of the computer, x-o don't worry everythings fine now. x-d set: 8159 racer x vs taejo theme: speed racer price: $19.99us pieces: 237 minifigs: 2 note 2: i did not take photos of just the new pieces this time because they're the same "new" pieces as in 8158, just in diff. colors. if you want to see a picture of them click here. first off pictures of the box, instructions, dss, and minifigs: not quite as many stickers as set 8158, but there still are quite a few. can you guess which ones which? :-d yes, taejo's hair really is red and black, for racer x's head tlg just reused the baddie's head from 7620. |-/ now onto the build: first racer x's x racer :-d (thats not it's official name.. i think.) :-$ back end of the car. the cockpit, and yeah there are no seats for racer x's hiny, just a flat 2x2 dark bley plate. the cockpit and rearend of the car connect using an s-shaped connector piece. the front part of the car. the fornt and the cockpit are also connected using an s-shaped connector piece. adding some details including yellow fenders. the underside of the car, so far. adding some more detail. newly added motor vents and smooth details. adding a front bumper, amongst other things. side view of the car, so far. "no backseat driving, wait a minute, there's no backseat!" the underside with newly added axles. demonstrating how hubcap piece is put on the car. now onto taejo's grr (glorious red racer) :-p front part of the car. cockpit, regular seats... check. cocpit and rearend of the car connected using s-shaped connector piece. adding some detail. the front part of the car. front and cockpit connected also using the s-shaped connector piece. adding some fenders to the car. underside of the car, so far. adding some smooth details. taejos is the only car with an actual hood. side view of the car, so far. underside of the car with axels. now some finished shots of both cars: first racer x's fine black and yellow racer reminds me of an older ferrari from this angle. up close and personal. i'm guessing the 3 holes are exhaust outlets. racer x rollin'. now it's time for taejo's red racer "i could've sworn i ordered some hubcaps!" -guess who... taejo racer x admiring taejo's fine red automobile. up close with 'big red'. rearend shot of the car. "i challenge you racer x!" -taejo racer x bein' a complete badass and smokin' taejo. >:-) now for some comparison shots: (the silver pocket knife is just to hold up taejo's car.) now a shot of the extra pieces: now if you combine 8158 with 8159, you get this: "go, go, go!" now it's time for the summary: this set is an excellent buy at $20 dollars, it's well designed and has lot's of details, it also has very unique minifigs. (which are always good in a set.) it's only downfalls are the lack of acessories for the minifigs and that there are no cool contraptions on the cars, and by "cool" i mean lethal to the other racer(s). now to the scoring of the set: price:10/10 pieces: 8/10 too many stickers for such a small set. minifigs: 10/10 unique and creative. playability: 9/10 would have been perfect except for the lack of acessories and cool contraptions on the cars. (but both are easily modified/fixed hence the nine.) overall: 37/40 a great set! bonus: try and count how many times my silver pocket knife appears and win... the knowledge of knowing how many times the silver pocket knife appears. :-p :-d this concludes the review, more pictures of either set 8158 or 8159 or both available through request, via pm-ing me. ;-) see ya' next time folks... of course i don't mean that literally x-d ... general tarful edited by imperialshadows, 01 june 2008 - 12:05 pm.

as promised, and with only a single day of delay is my review of the 2008 set: 4994 creator fierce creatures. this small set is the same size and price range as last year's 4939 cool cars reviewed by prateek and dillthepill. the box general info you get 193 pieces (vs 206 for cool cars) which is quite a lot, but most of them are small. there are a lot of hinges and some good slopes and wings. the building instructions contains three models, but no further ideas for inspiration. primary model: spider the first model is a big spider which shares some similarities to the secondary model of 4895 power in the design. the legs each have 3 joints, where the ones in the middle have "stud joints" to be moved sideways while the rest use hinges for all joints. there are 8 of them and it does get a little tedious with all the repetitive building in this relatively small model. i like the design of the face with a lot of eyes and a big and ugly mouth, but the real gem is the x-pattern on the opisthosoma made using double/inverted slopes. it is poseable and i think it looks more "fierce" when inverted. secondary model: snake the face of the snake is nicely detailed with a splitting tongue and a mouth than can move a little. there is a problem with the construction. it uses stacked hinges for some of the joints, which are hard to pull apart without stressing the pieces. tertiary model: fly i'm not completely sure what this insect is. i will say it's a fly, although the tail and head are too pointy. this is a neat little thing. conclusion primary model: 8 it is a good design, but lacks some sturdiness in the legs. they fall off a little too easily. secondary models: 6 they are pretty good when you look at the bricks that are available, but they don't wow you in any way and they suffer from the same issues as the primary model regarding sturdiness. alternate models: 3 it is hard to come up with alternate models with so many small pieces and plates that are only 1 stud wide. the colors might make you want to build a spyrius space ship. playability: 8 the models have many movable joints and you can put quite a scare into your minifigs when their town gets attacked by these creatures... unless some en forces are there to protect them. price: 6 creator sets are known for their great price to bricks ratio, but this set doesn't quite measure up to sets like cool cars. pieces: 7 the pieces aren't great by themselves, but who doesn't need a fist full of hinges, slopes and basic plates in standard colors? i don't think this is a must-have set like the big rig was last year. the pieces are great and it has a nice primary model, but the set lacks a bit when it comes to the usual strong creator qualities like alternate models and price.

thanks for this review, it's a nice set with some cool pieces and nice techniques, i like the way the roof pieces are used to make the spiders back, for instance lasse d, on mar 26 2008, 09:48 pm, said: alternate models: 3 it is hard to come up with alternate models with so many small pieces and plates that are only 1 stud wide. the colors might make you want to build a spyrius space ship. ouch! that's not a good thing, let's refrain from that.... ;-)
thank you for your detailed review, lasse d! *y* the only problem about this set is, that most of the people here will regard this as a pure parts pack. x-d oooh - i just found out about the red "teeth" - cool. i want that! *wub*
enchanted island 6278 pictorial review original price: $66 pieces: 412 figures: 7 this 1994 set marked the beginning of a new era for lego pirates - it became a theme more centralised around playability and not so much grand ol' ships. 6278 enchanted island was the flagship set of the islanders subtheme, heavily based around polynesian and native american concepts (in fact, tlc was successfully sued by a number of tribes for using bastardised maori names, such as kahuka). it was released as a legend set in 2001, but due to poor sales was discontinued again. the largest of the islander sets, enchanted island is a portion of an island with a river running through. the left hand side features some sturdy buildings built into a tree-like structure on a rocky outcrop, whilst the left hand side features a tower built out of "wooden" posts and a large tribal statue. the box cover shows all the details; it does, however, differ from the instructions' finished product in that it has been more aesthetically arranged - bushes e.t.c. have been moved to fill in gaps and to not obscure other things. the sides of the box show nothing particularly special, although in one scene it depicts the islander canoe chasing the pirate boat with the treasure; just one way to play with the set. the back of the box, however, is superb, featuring a large number of alternative models: a toothy statue, a pirate tree (think wolfpack) with an islander base, kahuka's throne, a fire-breathing statue and a souped-up boat for the pirates. these, and many more, can be easily made because of the large diversity of pieces. the set has a huge number of minifigures for its size, the third highest number in the pirate range (the ses and the bsb being first and second, respectively) - a whopping 7! 5 islanders, including the all-too-common king kahuka, the elusive islander babe and 3 standard warriors - this set alone will never leave you short of enemies! 2 pirates, ironhook in his standard attire with a scurvy dog at his side attack the island, although they are only moderately armed - 2 cutlasses and a pistol between them; a musket would've been nice. the islanders, on the other hand, have 4 shields, a bow and quiver and 6 spears, not to mention the big pokey thing with horns on top (weapon? idol? staff?). a monkey, parrot and crocodile provide the obvious creature features, with a fair amount of gold to finish off. in the instructions, the goblet does not have the lid, although it does on the box; it's a nice touch anyway - adding a little more diversity to the monotonous treasure stashes. the pirates' boat is a nice 2 sail vessel, with oars for when the wind stops and a treasure map. the sails are similar to those in lagoon lockup, but with an extra front sail. it's an awesome little boat, better for raids than a rowing boat, but not too big that it can't sail up rivers. it can comfortably fit 2 men and, at a squeeze, 5. the sails are expensive if you buy them seperately; normally this won't be a problem, but they can cost aroun $5 each. the islanders' boat is a canoe with a sail and an outrigger to stabilise it. the sail is beautifully done, with 2 spars taughtening it. there is a clip for the rower to leave his weapon when at se and the mast can turn to get as much wind as possible. it's quite a top-heavy boat, but it doesn't look hideous and without the mast/sail it looks great. 3 islanders can fit in it, and more if they sit on the outrigger. the markings on the canoe are stickers, but they look fine and are probably more robust than markings for their job. furthermore, they're waterproof! *sing* kahuka's throne can be carried by 2 loyal subjects... ...or strapped to his pet crocodile! the clips on the side can be used to rest his weaponry, or hold spears for battle. the throne looks nice, although i'm not too sure about the blue against the red - i'd have prefered white as it would clash less... an overview of the island; it is built in 2 halves - left then right and then joined together loosley, so it can be seperated for transporting. around the back to the left and right, there are large open spaces that are great for battles - this set isn't so much about a large solid build, but creating a "village" - smaller structures linked by bridges. and the back... to the far left is a platform built onto the rock, with access from the river via a ladder. there's the standard islander drum with the lovely zebra-skin part (where did they get that?!). i've never understood the white flag - i was under the impression it was used for surrender... further along the rocky bank, there are some hinged palm leaves that swing upwards to reveal... ...the treasure! it's an ok hiding place; not the best place to hide it, right where the pirates sail past, but it feels fabulous; it fits right in. above it on the rocky bank is the main structure. it looks very disjointed when you build it (bricks all over the place), but once it's done it looks nice and rural, with leaves everywhere and the "balcony" where kahuka is standing. you get a nice roof made from 2 large palm leaves tilting down. around the back there's a slight shelter, a table for picnics and a ladder to access the upstairs. i was rather annoyed that it is so open, but the set is designed from just one perspective... to the left is the bridge to the other building... a nice, one piece bridge made of the softer plastic used for muskets and the post-1991 cutlasses. it looks good, but be warned! it tilts when you pull a pin, sending the pirates flying! this contraption is a good idea, but it is very stiff and so doesn't swing, even when burdened by a minifigure - you'll want to modify this bit if you get it. the other building looks like it is made out of posts and beams. they are all red; brown would have been better, but it would have added too many colours to the range, just like the use of black for trees in some forestmen sets. there are 3 clips for spare weapons; only 2 of these will ever be used when all the islanders are armed, but it gives the pirates scope once they've been disarmed...there's another nice palm tree roof on top. 2 ladders give access...there's a total of 4 in this set - worth getting, eh? although they're 5p on bricklink, for a kabob, they're like gold! at the top there's another hidey hole; the palm leaves lift up on hinges to show the treasure or hiding islander. it can be seen from behind, but this set is designed from one perspective only. nice cattlehorns too...alongside the slats you can see in the floor - 5 years later and it would've been a solid plate... the big statue is one of the main selling point of this set, alongside the tilting bridge - they're the action features shown in every catalogue at the time, but it is not really special, just original. the statue fits in with the theme perfectly - kahuka's mask, his shield and this statue all depict the same deity, which is a nice "collectible" idea. the back is rather plain, except the angled 1x1 bricks - a good touch. i'm not sure why there's a black brick in the back of the head, but this is easily remedied; it could even be done with a brick from this same set, just swapping the two over... aside from the head turning, the back can open to store sacred objects, or, in my opinion, prisoners, hence the gaps for breathing. either way, it's a lovely piece of architecture and deservedly a flagship element of the set. there's your standard cooking pot floating around, although a 1x1 yellow stud as human flesh (remember, minifigs are yellow, no matter what the licensed themes say!) is a superb finish. this set is a stunning set for both kids and afols who are just getting back into lego/pirates - it is a great army builder and, due to its release as a legend, is extremely cheap on ebay - you should be able to pick one up for £18, or £15 if you're lucky. for that you get a lifetime's supply of islanders, 4 ladders, some wall panels, 2 baseplates (one raised and both with rivers and printed vegetation around the edge), a ton of weapons, a fair quantity of standard bricks, but most of all, a heap of vegetation: this is an easy to buy set, with normally around 5 on ebay at any time, and is well worth it, for the parts, the play and the nostalgia! it can be easily modified; when used in conjunction with any other outpost, a much larger fortress can be made, especially if more rope bridges are used. if you pick 2 of this fine set off ebay (it'll still be less than the original price!), a huge complex can be constructed, giving you an instantaneous village for around £35. other information lugnet rating: 79/100 brickset rating: 4.3/5 bricklink price: new - $100 used - $54 edited by phred, 05 april 2015 - 08:04 pm.
thank you for review very good army builder i see
excellent review! i really like this set and so i gave it a 5/5. this set is on my list to get. i especially like the speedy pirate boat, and the also very fast outrigger canoe with a sail. i don't think a small number of these cannibals will make much of an impact on gaming though, even if they get a bonus with spears. duke
yay! pictures! thank you for the review. you made me actually consider looking it up on ebay, but i already have so so many things to get on my want list. drat my easy ability to get sold on something lego!
slyowl, you're a legend! thank you for taking the time to do such a comprehensive review. you've captured enchanted island in impeccable detail and anyone who doesn't own this set should know it inside-out by now. i shall write my thoughts on the set itself, directly.
for some reason i never considered buying this set. but your review changed that. i'll try to get it on ebay. thanks for your efforts to make this wonderful review for us. it's now added to our index.
wow, that is one great review you made sly! i gave it a four, only thing i don't like is the raised baseplate. it does get you a lot of figs, two ships and some nice assecories, great set!
thanks for the review! i am getting very interested in the classic pirates sets, and i wat some now. this seems like it would be a great starter.
i was just going into my dark ages when lego began the islander themes, so i've never really cared for them. but this review actually made me want this set real bad. i guess this is what reviews are for then - good job on the review
great review! i recently got this set for only 150 sek, around $17, and it´s really good!
hello eldiano. although the review is fine and you have memories related to that set please have in mind that the post you were replying to was in fact some 7 years old. this is what we call "bumping of old topics" and it shouldn't be done. you might want to take a look at our faq: posting tips and etiquette edited by phred, 06 april 2015 - 03:47 am. by phred: read next post please.
i realized that building the chess set from the new pirates theme, they are two grey heads that reminded me of the king kahuna throne, which goes to say that i am hoping they bring back new sets, i just wish they were bigger. i would love to build the old ones, but i would side more towards the newer model if they ever released them.
no problem casewindu! i actually like this set for the pieces and torsos (especially sprittle's)
doubt ill get this, i used to like the anime but the the film looks cheesy as a cheese sandwhich
sorry to bump such an old thread, but i´ve just discovered this set is on sale at amazon.de - for a mere 25 euros. i am tempted. not because i like the set or the models, but because of the parts. as most of you might know, i´m especially into exo-force. so would you recommend to get this set just for the parts? are they a good choice to combine with ef-sets? would anyone of you be interested in obtaining the fleshie-parts of the minifigs from me, as i totally don´t need those?
speed racer is the action film.and he has formula 1 car but he is intersted in art of the race.
somehow i competely missed your review when you first made it, i saw your pics on brickshelf and wondered about the review... you have managed to review my all time favourite technic set! it was the first large technic set i was given by my parents, when it first came out in 1995. i played for hours with this set, making minifig seats in it (it was so huge there was room for four minifigs to sit next to eachother in front....) i made various applications for it, a bungee-jump system with a large rubber band, and lots of containers to be lifted. the first changes i made included the inverting of the wheels and the disabling of one of the flashlight-steering wheels because they obstructed eachother. by the way, the nob for your winch is yellow instead of black (i know this set by heart, so watch out :-p ). i always liked those nobs. i do own the 8421 and i can tell you: this 8460 is much, much stronger, it can carry more weight because the boom is lighter then the 8421: they are powered by the same two pistons... you know when you made it right: when the crane is in upright position, fully extended and you release the brake from the winch. does the hook lower without having to pull it? if it does, you succeeded in constructing the set right. the alternate model was great fun too, the pump is cleverly hidden and the crane folds up great between the cab and the loading platform. you could easily mod it with a pneumatic claw on the crane, a motor to turn it and a compressor. the only flaw was the loading platform which had no floor (only some axles). thanks so much for reviving my memorie concerning this great set! *y*
i'm in the same situation as you; i have this set but missed out on the newer 8421. this was a great set for its time but the 8421 definitely looks better to me. i've been trying to find a good deal on it on ebay but it's pretty expensive, considering that it only went out of production last year. quote inlay: i wonder why tlg doesn’t make inlays anymore… they’re noisy and brake easily but are great for (pre-) sorting. the box designs in general are crappier these days than they used to be 10 years ago. you don't see the old "featured parts" trays anymore and the boxes don't have the different sections either (these also acted as internal supports for larger boxes, so they were less prone to being crushed). the cardboard material is also quite a bit thinner. i think it's a result of tlc's overall cost-cutting moves since then. most people toss the boxes and probably don't care, but i keep all of them. there was actually a time when the boxes used to be even stronger. i have an old 8859 set and the outer box is made of a hard, styrofoam material, although they probably stopped using that for environmental reasons. edited by cp5670, 06 april 2008 - 10:13 pm.
a great review, thank you. i do not know these old sets like this one, but it is very cool to see how they were made. i have an un-opened 8421, maybe i should do a small review of that when i get to build it. btw. boxes are expensive, so at a given price point, it's a choise between more bricks or nicer boxes. i have no doubt what most people would chose. front edited by front, 06 april 2008 - 10:21 pm.
actually they are ants. spiders have 8 legs while ants have only 6 like these. the two thing that look like legs in the front are the antennae. back on topic, i think this set looks great and i can't wait until i can get my hands on it and the other new ij sets. edited by erdbeereis1, 15 april 2008 - 09:26 pm.
the new man hair looks like a wig!
can't wait to get this one (ants!!!) i don't have a tent either, so that'll be a great pickup. i'm surprised, though, that it includes the gold exo-force sword. i didn't expect this to come in any other sets besides the tower. <faramir-<
thanks for the review! must...make...ant...army...
another great review alex. is that the same tent/construction as the tent in 5978, sphinx secret surprise?
thanks for the excellent review alex! this is so far my favorite crystal skull set (released) the cargo plane is however the best i love the small accessories like turkey leg, banana, golden sword and giant ants! mutt's torso is very nice! i love the leather jacket print irina is just a another hottie, but i would like to see her smile oh and another indy...........
i was already thinking of buying this set, and you've totally convinced me. thanks for the review, alex btw, i think they are ants, having that shape; moreover, we already have spider molds, and they have already been used in theatre themes (see spiderman ). luxorv
ok! i think, it''s a no-brainer that this is a must-have for pretty much anyone who likes lego! it's cheap and a great minifigs & parts pack! i'll be getting at least 1 of these! here is what i like about it: 1. great minifigs with nice torsos, sweet faces, and awesome hair! (gotta ask 'em where they get it done! ) 2. golden katana! 3. chicken leg! yum! 4. nice campfire! and this is what i don't like about it: 1. dark bley knife! seriously, they could have at least made it silver like the sword, if not chrome! 2. rehashed tent. 3. spiders with 6 legs!!! i actually don't really care about the tent and the multi-legged creatures. those go straight into the sorting boxes. perhaps i might use the tent someday for a steampunk moc of some kind, or a stop-motion film, or maybe some kind of contest... anyway, what's up with that thing that holds the katana, the sword, and the saber? it's in the airplane set too! is it perhaps one of the treasures of the new movie or is it something indy takes with him everywhere in this film? 44however, nice pics, nice review! thanks, dude! edited by oky wan kenobi, 16 april 2008 - 09:38 am.
mhm...i really need this set! there are various things i’m interested in: the minifigs (hey, i still have no indiana jones figs!), the new hairpieces, a gold katana, a dark bley pirate cutlass (is this the first one?), a dark bley knife (could be useful..), those giant ants, yet another silver broad sword (you never have enough of those).....great parts pack indeed. shakar
great review
nice review indeed thanks for review all these new indianna sets just wondering did your set have a crate as im sure the prims has a crat with a banana in.
is that a laptop it's on? does it come with the set? seriously though, it looks liek it has some good pieces, particularily the soldier's clothing and the crocodile hehe. hooray for new indy sets, lets hope the film is as good (it will be).
nice review, i like what i'm seeing in this set. i liked the little comic, marion should be arrested though
must.....have......

my favorite part of this is prob the amphibious vehicle! looks really neat! nice to see another (different) torso for marion...
great review alex after seeing these pics i'm really looking forward to getting this set, i really like how lego has designed the gas tank that's just so good. finally a different shade of green for the croc, it's about time and more than welcome. the vehicle looks good and a fun build, though i'm not that fond of that commie tree
a very fine review of a really great set, thanks alex! this set has everything, a croc, very nice mfs, a neat tree trap, a cool zodiac and a marvelous and very detailed amphibious car in a beautiful color scheme. the only thing i´m not colpletely sure is the design of that jerrycan (thanks for the right word and the interesting link, kingboy ). although the use of the revolver´s pretty clever indeed and fits well too, it´s still clearly, well, a revolver.... very unusual and interesting for an official tlc design.
this set looks good. about the jerry cans, i like how they give me more pistols. this may be the only indy set i get from this batch. i'll just have to deal with the fleshie heads... (exchange them for yellow.) like stealth hunter said. this will be good for army building. silent help
i like the creatures in this very much, and it is good to see the vehicle from different angles. thank you i think i shall buy this.
excellent review alex. thanks for sharing. i can't wait to buy this set once available. i really like the dark green leaf pieces. i like the cave/temple which will look great in my jungle diorama. blending the dark green and light green works well for the vehicle. overall, a neat little set.
wow those trees look so weak compared to those enormous blades. anyway, a high-possibility-and-appeal-to-us-compulsive-lego-shoppers set, so, i'll try to get it, which means i'll obsesively look until i find. deforestation of puny trees, on!
thanks for this fantastic review, alex! those trees are a neat add on to any jungle, as is that sweet cave. but the main part of this set, the jungle cutter, man, that is wicked! packed with that awesome dark green and with those wonderful treads, not to mention the smoothly spinning buzz saws. however, this set's a tad overpriced in my opinion, and looking through the instructions they have that crazy colour syndrome again, using blue, yellow and red parts in the internal build. still, thanks for this sweet review with neat pics! *thumbup* ~peace
here some close-up pics of the russian soldiers and the general : and i know that you have seen that i don't have put the stickers on...
ahhhhh now this swamp vehicle looks great to me, when i first heard lego were making it i was worried that it would be a poor version. however im pleased to see that it's not, even though i'm not a great fan of those treads. the trees don't really add anything to the set which is a shame, still the parts are welcome at least. the entrance is good though it could do with being bigger, but i guess we can moc that. i really like the commie general, he looks like a real bad megablocks
great review again alex !! same question (in case you didn't se it in my reply to the other set): where did you get those new sets ?? i really love that set !! its called jungle cutter the trees are really cool and make a great adition to it imo. that temple entrance or monument is really cool !! those bionicle parts do make fantastic vegetation !! i totally forgot about that green frog !! thats cool , those are so cute !! 5 more ants is great !! the vehicle look really sharp (ah ah ah). 2 more commies yeay !! that officer is really freaky actually !! could have been a high rank under pol pot's regime in the s21... yeay looks more asian than russian imo now its time for my grips: * same bloody rant about indy !! * i haven't read the instructions before but once again there are so many parts in crap colours that need to be changed look at all the crap red and yellow in there !! i will need to look for those parts before buying the set like i always do !! mod while building on !! i am really soimpressed with that indy line !! i sincerely hope it will have a long and healthy life !!
xwingyoda, on apr 16 2008, 08:42 am, said: whats that funky name lol! just making sure your yoda-ee awesomeness is known. yep indeed and i have that set if i remember correctly the first line to use it as vegetation is aqua raiders tiger shark attack (7773) a-ha; it was in aquaraiders! it was also the squid's intestines, or whatever lays inside his baggy head. why, its just a flick fire missile in a wrench i'll use my brickarms rgp which is way better oh yeah, i forgot that. ok so i just finished reviewing the instructions and look at the parts you need to just change the horrendous colours !! damn its really getting worse and worse ahh, thanks! i'm definitely changing them; they may be bearers of the red star but they don't need red lining inside their vehicles.
this is the 3rd review, that i had read. it's very tempting to fly over and get those sets from there. because, i may need to wait for some months before it arrived. it seemed we will have a new small little creature to add into the ranks. these "red ants" is cute and of course looks nasty too. haha. i love those trees, foilage and plants very very much. it can be used for my moc and is good for any "green" project related expansion. i love it. about the vehicle, i find it abit wierd. it seemed too big in the set-up. hehe, but still i love this set. mainly, i will get it for the green parts
ah, the wonderful dragon knight (or was it dragon masters?) sets. i personally preferred the black knights, but these guys still had some awesome sets! thanks for this review, this looks like a neat little set, although those modern stairs look a little out of place. that tree design is indeed a neat one, i remember having that in one dark forestmen set i got. the interior sure is roomy. may i suggest for future review you photograph the set on a cleared table, that way you won't get distracted by the clutter in the background and can focus on the main part of the image, the set. ~peace
this is probably one of my favourite sets and/or one of the sets which i wish i owned..the 90's was probably my favourite castle era! tobad i was to young to buy this set when it came out man i wish i had one of those dragons, they were one of the best type i reckon although all the dragon's are good thanks for the reveiw edited by hollisbrick, 16 april 2008 - 07:41 am.
yay, go dragon masters! i have to agree with iamded, i do like the black knights sets better for their design ( betrayal! ), however, the dragon knights are just awesome, 'cause they have dragons! this is a nice set, with some awesome minifigs and a nice overall design. i wish i had it... go masters!
the 8291 dirt bike comes from a long line of technic bikes, and i think it's the best ever. it looks great, and it's fun to ride around in the house. i hoped to find a figure the right size for it, but none of mine would fit. unlike a lot of technic models, it looks good from all angles. considering the size of the model it has a complicated way of connecting the engine to the wheel. the rear shocks are just the right stiffness... ...and they have a good amount of travel. i thought these shocks were new. i need to get out more... functions: shocks: two front, one stiffer one in the rear. drivetrain: 2 piston engine linked to the rear wheel via gears and a chainlink. steering: yes it does... stand: retractable. for the price, size and subject, what else could be added? 10/10 parts: considering that it has three shocks and a 40 chainlinks it's a great set for parts. some hard to use large parts are included, but they are not overused. the usage of the green does limit part usage somewhat though, and i'll be struggling to find a use for those wheels for anything other than a motorbike. 8/10 price: at $39.99 aud for 248 parts it isn't the best value set. the us price is $25.00 which is somewhat better. it does have some more complicated parts however. 7/10 looks: lego seems to be moving away from the see-though look for technic sets and this is a good example of it. i'm not a big fan of fairings but i think they work great in this set as a fuel tank. 8/10 fudge: this set was great for me as i have never had a technic bike. however for those that want this for just parts or have other bikes it could be a hard sell. the alternate model (a chopper) is a complete rebuild (which i didn't make), and it's great that lego have been including these most of the time lately. 7/10 overall: recommended. 8/10
best review of a lime green technic dirt bike ever! really, it is. i just don't understand the allure of the bike very much. where does the fabuland fig go? anyway, very insightful review. thanks for taking the time and effort to review it for us. i'm not really interested in the set, but wanted to support my buddy since i know how much work you put into these. now i shall go read the cherry picker one. i look forward to it because there's a walrus in it. lasse d, on apr 22 2008, 04:55 pm, said: it must be cold in that room. nice shirt, but the vertical hold is broken...

how did i manage to miss this review? i must have overlooked it somehow... thanks for making this one sinner, it's always nice to see reviews of technic sets. i'm not so sure whether i like this set, i am not that much into motorbikes, but lego did a good job on this one. it looks a lot like an upgraded version of one of the first bikes lego made, namely the 8838 shock cycle. i also believe the back gearwheel is somewhat oversized, it looks better with the smaller one you attached. it is good to see that lego is back to making the technic sets the way they were (except for the green, that is )

thank you for that fine review of a pretty cool and nice set with a very good amount of functionality and, um, playability, for sure.
great review sinner i bought this set a few weeks ago personally i prefer the alternative model of the flatbed truck.
thanks for reading my review guys! ~vbbn~, on apr 20 2008, 10:58 pm, said: great review! i never have been interested in this set. i am saving my money for a grey technic set or thatt technic ferrari set... if you mean 8145 ferrari 599 gtb then i recomend it, but i think it is overpriced. mine was almost half price... and about to fall in the sorting bin! holodoc, on apr 21 2008, 04:23 am, said: i´m not that much into technic building because i´m lacking the inspiration to build something different with all those technic elements. so i´ll pass on this one and stay to classic bricks. i have enough now to be able to build something... and i really should soon or i'm going to find it hard to justify to my wife buying the other 2008 sets! imperialscouts, on apr 21 2008, 12:58 pm, said: thanks for the review! i think i am going to get this set for it's many technic pieces. i could really use those for a rig i'm going to build. i didn't know you liked technic. i look forward to seeing this rig. cp5670, on apr 22 2008, 02:35 am, said: the overall design is a bit too studless for my liking (i think the 8275 bulldozer has a much better balance of studded and studless pieces), and the wheels somehow look too small to me. i also have something of a backlog at the moment; i still need to pick up that bulldozer along with the 8421 mobile crane (on ebay). i'd buy the bulldozer or mobile crane over this set. as i own both already i bought this! i tend to agree with the wheels, but i think it doesn't detract from the model. hinckley, on apr 23 2008, 08:14 am, said: wow, it's a smarty set with drive shafts (we are everybody!) and technical junk. the specs and stuff kind of lose me but the walrus looks really cute in the cherry picker! i imagine he's saving a kitten. thanks for your foray into technic land. i tried to fit him in the cab as well but he kept falling over.
svelte_corps, on may 1 2008, 02:43 pm, said: hi tinypiesrus - i love that helmet too! if only we had plumes again... soon hopefully! the armour is pearl silver, not gold. oh sorry, my mistake. so is it pearl silver, as opposed to metallic silver? that sure is an odd little vehicle the engine looks nice enough and the rubber treads are always good to have, but other than that, it really just looks thrown together. thanks again, svelte! edited by tinypiesrus, 01 may 2008 - 02:58 am.
thanks for the reveiw it was a enjoyable and good one! i really like this set!!! too bad it's beyond my price range, i guess i'll just get the smaler set. what suprised me is that there is no giant ants i'm guessing you live in aus.? where did you get this set from???
great in-depth review!!! svelte, i love your cat! :) :)
wout, on may 1 2008, 10:28 am, said: thank you for the nice review. off-topic: i heard something on lowlug that tlc cancelled 2624 (little set with indy, mutt, irina and tent). have anybody heard something about that? that would be not so nice. absolute hogwash. i wouldn't trust anyone on a forum i've never heard of. i don't believe they'd cancel it. it's still on s@h, right?
i know that alex54 had already reviewed this set beforehand, but i wanted to give my 2 cents (it is really more like $1.50) on this set i bought from toys 'r' us on friday (guess what, the price had not been increased by a dollar like all other sets, ). this is my first review of a set ever, don't be too mean. 1) box it captures the potential (i don't know how the scene plays out... for now ) action of the scene nicely and is very pleasing, good job tlc . on the back it shows some of the play features of the set and a net little comic. indiana jones seems to be surprisingly calm considering that he is about to be captured under a net and attacked by a snake (the thing he fears most). 1a) comic not much to say on this... 1b) screw up at the top of the box, both "russian guards" have the same grining face, in the set one has the generic bad guy face from 7620. 2) contents the box opens up to reveal a quartet of bags, an un-crumpled manual (yay!), and a sticker sheet (boo!) 2a) dss yoda said every for of rambling imaginable about this accursed item, i have nothing to say. meh... 3) minifigs the only thing that has not really been discussed about the figs that you get in this set is that marion has a slightly new torso. 4) parts of interest when i opened up the baggies, these were the components that grabbed my attention. a dark green alligator, a net piece that i know has appeared in sets before hand ( i needed it for a moc i am working on), some raft part that is probably very old, a ladder with two pairs of hindges, and a dark brown version of this part. 4) build (amphibious vehicle) this i one of the more enjoyable builds of the new line. but that is just my opinion. you start of with some thing very simple... by the end of the next page, it starts to bulk up more detail... beginning to look like a car... 4a) build (rear attachment) bulk it up and add taillights... done... slap it on to the main vehicle... 4b) build (front attachment) i am running out of things to say... bulk it up... add some detail... add a gun and headlights... and attach to the rest to get the completed vehicle... add stickers... i honestly think that the amphibious vehicle looks much better with the stickers than without... 5) build (boat) this build goes by rather quickly and adds to the playability of the final set. base... apply clamps... add more to engine... build more detail and a gun base... finished boat... plus stickers... i love how lego slips in the product number into their stickers. 6) build (tree fort) this is the weakest part of the whole set. but i find my self liking it more and more for some odd and inexplicable reason. that tan 6x6 will most likely see use in a pirate themed vinigete soon (not mine ). install net-launcher... you spend the next two pages building this... and putting it on... a tree branch that is an ugly mix of brown, dark brown, and frown... (our commie friend seems to like coffee a lot) second branch... 3rd... (a wee bit to much on the coffee there, don't you think?) final step... the only redeeming value of this section is how well the net launcher works, fantastically. the rest is just utter fail. 7) spare parts very little in terms of what is left over... finished set... all in all, this set is a fine build and an excellent parts pack for dark green components. i recommend this set strongly, despite its few weaknesses.
nice review! got this set yesterday and u have to say, that amphibious vehicle rocks!!!
nice review! although you need to use the macro setting(a.k.a. the flower setting) for better pics. are you using a digital camera? you really need macro... the idea is, turn it on and hold down on the 'take picture' button halfway until the pic focuses. then press it down all the way to take the pic. i'm glad this one also comes with the new uzi; i wanted an extra...
thank you for the nice, in-depth review! i have to say, lego did a good job on the amphibious vehicle. p.s.- if you need photo taking help, pm me and i can give you some handy tips.
nice review wilhelm screamer! very thorough. the pictures are a little dark and blurry, though. i made a tutorial here for amateur photography tips. i also edited your first post to include a link to alex's review. great job!
what a fantastic set. i'm overwelmed with feelings of nostalgia by seeing this review. the playability factor of this set is as high as it can be. thanks for making and sharing this awesome review !
thanks for this review! you have reviewed my most favourite town set of all times, i am so happy to own this one. i actually is a story to go along with it: in the summer of 1998 i went on holiday with my parents to the country of luxembourg, in the city of wiltz we encountered a small toystore which still had this set for sale, (9 years after the release!). i did not had the sufficient amount of money to buy the set and had to leave it at the store, i was practically in tears... four years later we passed through luxembourg and i remembered the city and the store. we made a detour and stopped by the same store. every other old set was sold, the only one remaining was this one! i bought it immediately and treasured it ever since. i use the baseplates a lot in my cities, they serve well as roads with parking spaces next to them. this was the first set i owned which had the huge 6x24 plates in them, i remember my surprise when seeing plates of such enourmous lenght... i recently made an entire racetrack together with this set and to promote myself i will place a link here
nice reveiw i would fork out $100 aud for that set its just so bueatiful if only tlg re-released this
thank you very much for that fine review of a really classic and wonderful racing set! and i really wish that tlc would continue with showing some great alternative models on the back of the boxes.... just imagine on!
batbrick thanks for the sweet review. you give me great insights into this set. hehe, i agreed that racer x is nice, but i believe we can get it in the other set for a much lower price. for me, the trailer which does not have a cover is bugging me alot. that's why, i holding my reservations against this set. at most, i will consider the other 2 smaller sets for collection purpose. nevertheless, batbrick great job
thank you for the nice review
hi all newly arrived today, don't you just love shop at home. thought i'd give it a quick review. see more details over at my site. the tumbler: joker's ice cream suprise
nice review--i'm surprised these are out already. i'll probably end up passing on this one. even with the surprise. :)
ronan nissen, on may 16 2008, 10:05 pm, said: oh wait, is that torso dark grey or light grey? it's definitely dark grey.
great review, as always! although i know you don't take many pictures in your reviews(imho, ) but can we see a little more about the tumbler? is that little windshield down near the bottom front a third seat? what is in the framework of the back, behind the cockpit? i know there's a blunt shooter and flick fire missiles, but is it all framework?
brickbitz, on may 16 2008, 11:41 pm, said: i'll get some set up tomorrow in better light. to be honest there isn't a lot to see, most of it is just basic technic blocks underneath with all the slopes built up on top. some more pics of the tumbler.
the tumbler is massive! i'll struggle to fit it into the cave, but never mind. the figs are nice, the tumbler is pretty accurate (or at least, it will be after i've moded it), and joker's tainted ice cream van is so very joker. thanks for the review, btw.
general grievous reviewed by dunamis set 10186 1,085 pieces $89.95 from lego shop @ home build time 3.5 hours it is the start of summer here in california and along with the weekly deluge of new action films we start to see some of the next wave of star wars lego sets. the latest offering from our favorite building toy company is none other than the infamous general grievous! no doubt you all know the story of grievous; two parts technic and one part human and his hatred of the jedi. follow along as we get a close-up view of the mighty general. no doubt the observant will wonder why i purchased this set from shop @ home instead of my trusty lego store in glendale. well, it’s really as simple as two things: i’ve been traveling a lot and didn’t have time to drive to the store to get it and gas is now $4/gallon and i would likely spend more in gas than the $9 shipping cost to get it to me. so there you have it. the box: a gigantic box (much larger than expected) held the mighty general. we’re back to the perforated tabs on the side and two stickers on the front that let the box lift open: inside, we have 17 bags, two manuals and three stickers on a relatively small sticker sheet. the manuals: the manuals are not terribly thick in fact the second manual is noticeably thinner than the first. they come in at 75 and 31pages. interesting to note on the back we see the next (and more interesting) wave of sets later this summer. nothing new to report on the manuals as they provide the lego standard of high quality and features we expect. - piece callouts - models divided into sections - large images - page numbers since there were links posted to the .pdf files of the instructions online, i’m sure you can all get an idea of the manual and the parts inventory. however, for those of you without access to the internet here are photos of the parts inventory pages: random manual image: features page: the pieces: the short answer is you get lots and lots of little pieces in white, gray and black plus some big pieces in white, gray and black. mixed in the set is a fair amount of oddball pieces like minifig tools, jedi hood and trans yellow dome. fear not, despite the eclectic collection of parts, it all comes together in the end (not unlike a typical day at work for me…) it is probably worth noting again that there is a heavy amount of technic parts and pieces here. the build: the build starts off with a rather in-depth build of the stand in which general grievous stands on. once you think you are done, you keep adding on to this (rather solid) base. i bet there are 250 pieces just in the base alone! it is quite nice when you get done with it though and really adds to the display. i’m glad lego didn’t skimp on the base as it completes the model. once you get through all that, the rest of the build is a real thumb-bruiser. anyone who has built a decent size technic set knows the feeling of your thumbs being sore when you are done. you get the same effect here. it is actually a fun build and i really liked seeing how the designers used all the various pieces to recreate a fairly accurate model of grievous. the model is built from the ground up as seen in a few of the progress shots: here is what is left over: the design: the design is quite good and is very accurate. some might be disappointed that since this is a technic set we don’t have more articulation in the shoulders and have the ability to separate two arms into four as seen in the movie. however, it would seem the real intent is for display and not functionality. here is a shot of the torso and the detail involved: here are grievous’ organs: careful observers will note that my model is lacking two “arrow” stickers from the two white chest pieces. i failed to see these on the sticker sheet and only grabbed the large grievous sticker. so, note that there are actually three stickers and not one. chest protector and respirator: head and arms: i was a little disappointed that we got two yellow blades and no green blades on the lightsabers. note how all the lightsabers have different hilts which is a nice touch: here are some shots of the completed model with a few other sets shown for scale. he is actually pretty tall: you have the option to remove the top two arms and put in shoulder plates if you so desire: detail on the back: overall thoughts: i’ve been saying for a few years that we should have a technic grievous set and we finally got one. designed more as a model and not a fully functional swooshable figure, grievous is a tad flimsy. you won’t want him to veer too far off his massive and sturdy base. it would have been nice to have is cape with him (like the technic vader set). i do like the size of the model and it is impressive to look at. lego star wars system fans will likely want to think twice before purchasing but technic and ucs fans should be satisfied. final rating: 75% build 8/10 (very good – fun, relatively quick build. technic fans will be more pleased than others.) design 8/10 (very good – some nice snot and technic techniques. a bit flimsy but the base is kind of cool.) parts 7/10 (a mixed bag of stuff. probably can’t get too many diverse builds from this except for other robot type models.) price 7/10 (just ok – a bit stiff at $90 usd for a nice display model with limited functionality.) as always, let’s hear your thoughts and feedback.
thanks so much dunamis for your awesome review . yeah i think tlc miss the cape, it would be cool to own one but when we were talking of the 2008 sets around july of last year i can remember someone said it would come with cape. finally is a little dissapoint tlc miss it . edited by darkrebellion, 16 may 2008 - 07:20 pm.
excellent review, dunamis. this set looks great. the designers really though the kit out, it seems. the internal organs have got to be my favorite part, but everything is good. now all we need is a ucs obi-wan with a laser pistol to finish off grievous in a totally anti-climatic way!
i do a easy answer to you dunamis and just double post cm´s answer... i was there as well! copmike, on may 17 2008, 12:42 am, said: nice review dunamis ! i built it two weeks ago on the legoworld speedbuild in oslo and didn´t have time to get the "feel" during that crazy race. i agree with you that the base is nice & sturdy, makes it stand real still ! i´m looking forward on your next score! four eyes arms on copmike sturdy on!! -ras-
thanks for this very detailed review dunamis! didn't think that gg were that big he looks pretty good to me, but i'll save the 90€ for the upcoming cw sets
dunamis, on may 17 2008, 04:58 am, said: any, silly me, in my first set of photos above, i never folded in his ribcage (you guys gotta call me out on these things). you forgot to add the stickers to the chest plates too. jeremy
great review, very detailed indeed!
thanks very much for the review brickbitz! i love this year's mars mission line, and though this is the weakest set, it is still a major improvement. the mech is very cool and well made, and the commander is one of my favourite alien figs ever. the alien ship is pretty good, better than last years ones but not extremely good either, but i still like the set. batbrick away!
thanks for the review brickbitz i don't normally come into the space forum but this set it tempting me, on the basis of you review i think i might aquire one at some point.
damn!!! i was just about to post a review on this here's the infiltrator with the nice shiny holographic stickers! [attachment=2232:mars_mis...tor_tiny.jpg] edited by the rancor, 18 may 2008 - 12:59 pm.
excellent review as usual, brickbitz. i really love this set. the moonwalker is amazing, and the alien craft is really nice too. i might get this someday...
thanks for the great review oky wan the two vehicles look quite nice for a small set and the minifigs look great! the two sided head is nice, although it would've been nice if it was a new head rather than the standard frowning face. the cyborg looks good, nice and cartoony, i like the printing on his back. the belt on the hips should be useful, not to mention the robotic hand. i assume that anything that fits into a 1x1x1 cylinder can fit in it? i hope so thanks again oky. any chance you can get any more sets?
thanks for the review. i'm looking forward to some of the new parts and ideas in this line. the figures look great. the actual sets themselves don't really appeal though.
huhm .. i like the idea of the agent-id .. but offcourse all they want with that is that you buy all six sets .. but it can be a good idea for children, they wouldn't think of "hey they get all money only because i have a little card with stars" or something. well, not to rant, i think it's good. also, can you make that name yourself? maybe set 5 comes with a extra stickersheed with all letters, that would be nice "agent rupee" a very nice review oky wan kenobi. =rupee
thanks, guys! i really tried to make it a good first review! now to answer your questions: the robot arm can fit ef robot claws and anything that a minifig can hold in his hand or that would fit into a 1x1x1 cylinder, so normal minifig hands are too small to fit. tlg is using the robot claw idea for the main villain of the agents line! do you still want me to try it out and take pics? the price was 10.99 usd at the tru i bought it at. i bet it'ss be a dollar less on s@h! and i'm sorry, but i probably won't get any more sets any time soon. i have to save my money for all the other good set that are to come. but if i would get another set, it would just be the one with the helicopter and the all-silver car! if anyone gets this set, can he/she please review it? thanks! any other questions i can answer for you guys? edited by oky wan kenobi, 18 may 2008 - 08:59 am.
oky wan, thanks for this wonderful review! i really have mixed feelings towards agents set. haha, but i love the agent mini-figure. the double-sided face is great and i love the sunglass look. it's nice that they made use of mutt's hairpiece which is personally my fave hairpiece at the moment the jet-pack is neat. making use of the additional secure backing onto the mini-fig is really very smart.
i kind of like the set. as said it has a very cartoonish style to it so i'm guessing the kids are going to love it. and as a parent i'll love it if the construction isn't to fragile. ;) i'll probably be getting a few for myself but only as parts pack. copmike, on may 18 2008, 11:29 am, said: and the excaustpipe is a new peace also i think? yeah and it's all over this years releases. from what i've seen so far it's found in: racers, speed racers, mars mission and exo-force sets. i just wish that instead of a 2x1 plate with an exhaustpipe in each end they would have made it an 1x1 plate with a single exhaust. that would have been a lot more useful.
omg omg omg. im coming to the us in just under two weeks, really hope i see them somewhere! does anyone know what ny times square toys r us is like for new sets?
hmm, interesting set. great review! i might pick this one up for the wonderful parts. ~vbbn~
they are already on the shelfs? that's kinda weird, since there aren't even the instructions online yet
that would be great! i still wonder why the instructions aren't up yet, though..
have you made any other reviews? i want more. please? i'm not planning to get this set, but its pretty cute. the set itself is okay, but the figs are amazing. agent charge: i want that head. unibrow man! great villain! crocs...
great little set, nice to have a small building instead of all vehicles. plant pieces and dark green crocs always welcome. good parts selection for the price. thanks for the review! can't wait till we can get our hands on these!
can't..resist...the unibrow...must obey.
i always joked that our house would have a moat around it with mechanical alligators. now i can build the house in lego! thanks sirnadroj for the review and pictures. this is definitely my favorite agents set.
sirnadroj, on may 21 2008, 08:36 pm, said: agent charge: looks like indy with 'roid rage... sirnadroj, on may 21 2008, 08:36 pm, said: treasure: map! nice map. is it a sticker or printed? steve
why do all of the reviews that we have for agents sets have the agents getting hurt? is this a new trend? plus unibrow man doesn't have a unibrow. his eyebrows are really close together and bushy!
does anyone know if the turbo car chase is out yet?
very nice review riddler!
thanks for an interesting review, ???theriddler???. the set´s cheap and very useful to get two fantastic mfs, a great mr. freeze and a very cool new batman. but i have to say that these two small vehicles just look plain ugly imho, without any inspiration nor orginality.... sorry, tlc, but you can for sure do better than that, and even with less pieces....
thanks for the review... ill probably get one copy of this set. mr. freeze and his cart look neat. i dont like the huge wing on the back of batman's buggy so ill probably mod that out.
grevious, on may 23 2008, 09:54 am, said: indead. the only reason to get this set is if you couldn't afford the batcave back in 2006 and want a mr. freeze fig for a cheap price. and anyone who did get that kit really have no reason whatsoever to get this. i'll get it, i admit the vehicles are extremely poorly designed, i mean really poorly designed, but the mr.freeze fig is fantastic, and i would buy two of this set just for him, as his head and gear are very useful for mocing. it also comes with some nice pieces, like the grappling hook, little wheels, exhaust pieces and such. still, a pretty bad set build wise, but it has atleast inspired me to make my own batbuggy thanks for the review theriddler, appreciated. batbrick away!
thanks for the review! for such a high price that we need to fork out, compared to a total pieces of 76. it's is very expensive to pay for such poor design. but then, i will still considered to get them. as what sinner had said, this is a very good way to get mr freeze without getting the batcave. and it so happened that, i do not have the batcave too. i believed that is the cheapest set among the four. so, for the mini-figs only, this set is recommended. other than that, i am sorry.
neat little set. i do like the parts a number of hard to find bits all in one pack, depending on how much it costs in usd i'll have to consider it. and while the buggy designs kinda suck, i'm a little happy to see them, its been years since tlc made any small go kart style vehicles. i guess tiny turbos have been overshadowing that market?
thanks the penguin, and more pics on monday!
thanks for the review. this set was poorly design, when i first heard of it i think it was like a car with a much better design than this one. i think i will get it for the minifigs.
in actuality, i think that this may be my favorite batman set of all time. i know, i know - it's a small set with crappy tiny vehicles; so it probably sucks for the fan who likes to display sets; but look at the mocing side and you see this set has a ton of potential: -new batman fig. well, mainly the torso; but it looks nice, sleek, and armored! a definite plus whether you're a mocist or batfan. -mr. freeze. because nobody bought the batcave when they should have...and by nobody i mean me. plus, i love that head! -cheapest way to amass the lightning piece. the other sets that have it are lolhueg (well, not really, but i don't have $50 to toss around on a little skeleton tower...), and it's a great piece. -two little blue gems. i may be alone on this, but those are my favorite parts (the gems), and that's my favorite color for them! <3 <3 <3 -several other useful parts, including a +o piece in black, some light/medium blue bits from mr. freeze's kart, the oddly placed grappling hook, and some cheap wheels. now, i don't know about you guys, but this is as close to a batman battlepack as we're going to get, lol - i'm buying at least three, maybe more once i get my summer job ^.^ (oh, and the fact that the us price is only $10 helps a little, but this year you guys can't complain - you got practically every set first, especially the new castle! t.t) ~trexxen
looks cool, one of the best in this line. cant wait for review!
can't wait for the review the car is ly!!!
yay! can't wait for your review. i plan to get this and the giant truck. the brick rat, on may 23 2008, 07:31 pm, said: 2)this set contains the best lego sound brick ever (it's just begging to be incorporated into my arkham asylum). what is a sound brick?
wow! thanks, deino, for this great review! i can't wait to get this myself, but right now i gotta save for the cw sets! the car is with no doubt one of the most mind blowing things tlg has come up with and we can only hope that there will be more models made out of almost only metalic colors! the spider cyborg, while not as innovative as some of the other cyborgs, is a very nice fig, and his head will be very usefull for splinter cell mocs! and those intake pieces are only relatively new btw, they are in almost all of the current $10 racers sets. any chance of you taking a pic of a line-up of all the silver parts in this set? edited by oky wan kenobi, 24 may 2008 - 11:32 pm.
i love it ! fun, playable, cool looking, and killer minifigs! sweet!
thanks for the review deino! i love going back through the old "agents" thread just to see how wrong we were about these awesome sets! i actually really like the gate, those portcullis pieces people may know i always find nice uses for, and i really, really, really want that awesome sound brick. the figs are a bit disappointing in numbers, but agent chase is very cool, generic henchman are great, and spy clops is one of my favourite minifigs ever! the helicopter is wonderful too, i love that it is customised for spy clops to winch him down. the colours as usual for these sets are fantastic, the dark blue, orange and chrome silver! the car is the best though, i love all the functions. how does the ejector seat work though? batbrick away!
deinonychus, on may 23 2008, 09:12 pm, said: the rear has two cones sticking out. i'd like to think they're smoke nozzles or oil-slick sprayers. according to page 14 of my brickmaster magazine, the left cone is for smoke screen and the right cone is for oil slick.
wow great review thanks! this set looks absolutely great!!!! but i'm afraid of the price oh weel i'll just get the 2 smaller ones. i'm really liking this theme! well done tlg
thanks deinonychus for another great review. i must say i do look forward to people uploading reviews of new sets, it really helps me decide if i want it or not. if it's a good set (imo) then it adds to the excitement of picking up one myself! this, i must say, is one of those sets! the only concern for me, like alot of others, is the price. i will just have to wait and see and continue to look at these photo's deinonychus has provided for us!! so much for thinking the agent line was going to be weak! i wonder if the exoforce style code brick number plate is a hint from tlc as to what will replace exoforce at the end of this year? jb
thanks for your great review! it looks very nice indeed! the gate have very interesting mechanism. the car looks very slick and cool. it looks like those typical kind of james bond car. this review gives me very good insights.
thanks for the review whitefang. i love these sets, and i wish they were available in nz. so far, it seems they may never come here... but i can sit and hope. i like the look of them after your make-over, a real skeleton army there! did you say you've bought 12! tht's lots of skelies. are you planning a big moc or something?
sdpirate, on may 26 2008, 10:40 am, said: no offence- make this 7.99 can. too expensive to be coming with only a few figures. 20$ earns you the same amount of figs, plus a catapult, barricade, two horses and a jousting divider. are you refering to these following sets? both these sets adds up to $18.00 (cad) and the skeleton pack have the same price of $18.00 (cad) *prices quoted from s@h i understand that 7009 and 7090 offers more pieces, horses and same amount of mini-figs compared to a typical battlepack. imo, i feel that all 3 sets are all army building sets. 7009 offer small catapult, 3 mini-figs, a skeleton white horse. 7090 offer a joust divider, weapon rack (good accessories), 2 mini-figs, a horse with barding and a skeleton black horse. these sets have different purpose. for me, buying multiples of 7009 is to build its catapult, white skeleton calvaries. while 7090 is to build on crown calvaries and black skeleton calvaries. however, battlepacks have a different agenda. it offered some castle accessories that is not available commonly. for a castle army builder like myself, castle accessories are always in demand. the black robe, silver armor, silver short-axe are not very common castle accessories. it can be used as a good stock up too. i am not saying this battlepack is an one way solution to solve everything. that's why, different sets are released to target on different purposes.
whitefang, although i realize that the battle packs are great specifically for building armies, and castle accessories (which is why its such a shame that i won't be able to buy these things ), while sdpirate's sets are more for a catapult, calvary whatever. the fact to the matter is with the battle pack you get: 5 minifigs with lots of accessories. while with the sets that sdpirate showed us you get: 5 minifigs with an okay amount of accessories 3 horses (including two skeleton ones) a ballista a weapons rack, and a jousting barricade. you cannot say that the battle pack contains the same amount of stuff that the other two sets have and therefore should be priced the same. it just seems that lego is ripping off canadian army builders, to me if the battle pack contained a small catapult, or wall so that it contained about the same amount of stuff that the other sets had it would be fair. it seems stupid that you will only get minifigs from one set, while you can get about the same amount of minifigs plus a bunch of other stuff from two other equally priced sets. that’s why to me these battle packs are a rip off, because of what they contain, imho the battle packs seem to be only worth about 10 dollars.
thanks for the review whitefang! your additions look great, i like your mace much better than the use of a small technic cog, your looks much sturdier. and that helmet looks really great on skellie soldiers, i never thought to use that before. very cool indeed! ~peace

thanks for sharing these close-up images of this battlepack whitefang. i actually had this set in my hand at legoland cal. and could not decide if i wanted it. i'm currently out of "castle-mode" with my large indy jungle set up on the table, and creating ghost train mocs that are starting to line up on the bookshelves. once i buy the troll ship, i'll want to start collecting these great fig sets. thanks again for sharing.
thanks for the nice review whitefang! i got the knights bp just for the scared face.
sorry to be going a little off topic here but personally i have just bought 40 crowny battle packs for the only reason that i am running out of space to store the left over blocks. about 500 of my crownies came from sets (mentioned above) on sale which would have been cheaper than the battle packs. thanks for the review whitefang but i dont think i will be buy any skeleton battle packs, that army is large enough.
thebrickster, on may 28 2008, 01:21 pm, said: for those of you who buy so many of this and the other battle pack with crownies, what do you do with all of them? is this simply to create a large-scale army, or do you plan to build large castle scenes with all the figs. i'd love to see some pictures (on the "share your castle army" thread). i am a army builder and hope one day to make large scale castle battle scenes. time is a huge factor at the moment, i have to work so hard to pay for all this..lol. there is a queens birthday holiday coming up on the 9th of june here in australia, thats the deadline i have given myself. you will definately see my army in the "share your castle army thread". thats the beauty of the battle packs, the figures come armed.
i don't think these new skeletons do it for me, but thanks for a good review
i've always wanted to see this set close-up voltio. thanks for sharing the image review. this is the only jungle adventurers set i don't have and it's got some great unique pieces (esp. those leaf brick pieces). what's great is they're not stickers. this is a really a nice review of a neat set; with the extra little humor you shared. thanks again for taking the time to photograph and share over eb.
great review for a great set! man i loved the adventurers although the new indy sets are good they will never match up to johnny thunder! most of all no stickers great review!
i'm gonna start searching ebay!
great review! i just barly missed the jungle series, growing up with half a year of jungle and mainly orient expedition and dino island. i like egypt more, but this set (despite the 4x4 palm tree) is practically perfect. i love the detail and vibrant colours. gotta say, i've got a thing for pippin reed myself. by the way, what does "vhtf" mean? edited by sdpirate, 28 may 2008 - 01:06 am.
the printed pieces are the real gems of this set. beyond them, there isn't much to this set, though the boat hull is nice. the model itself, isn't all that great. the new akator temple is definately a superior model (at least in piece count), but those printed pieces are hard to resist. steve

this set is awesome .......... gr8
i just rebuilt this entire set today, and the nostalgia was totally worth taking bits and pieces from a few of my own mocs. only now did i realize how rare some of those pieces are, and i'm rather thankful that i have all of the printed pieces, and achu. the only pieces i am missing is a transparent orange headlight (3 out of 4), black minifigure hammer, light gray chain(replaced it with a dark gray chain), and one whole minifigure, which is the mechanic guy. i still have both the instructions and the box, and both are in appalling conditions. kudos to the pre-2000s lego sets like this one! love 'em
wow, good review! i used to love this old sets, as i was greatly fascinated by inca and aztec cultures, and the mayans technological marvels astounded me. i was thrilled to death when lego released little aztec figures, so of course i jsut had to buy some your narration with the sig fig was hilarious, and the review was all around wonderful, keep up the good work mate!
i had one of these! it was awesome, it went well with the zeppelin. i can't remember if the box was one of those fold up the lid ones though. can't tell from the picture. anyone want to jog my memory, i always thought the sets with the flap lids were the best, i kept those! edited by giantdinosaur, 26 september 2011 - 08:38 pm.
the images are obsolete, please fix it.
welcome to cardinal brick's review of 7736 it's a small set but as i bought it the other day i felt that it probably did merit a short review. the box is ofcourse far larger than necessary! there's plenty of air inside. the contence is one bag and the instruction booklet, you could proably build it inside the bag if the desire took you. we have one new coastguard with the slightly stubly head found in the castle range and a trans-clear visor. the build was challanging and arduious the final product is quite nice at one ?3.00 it's a good set only 50p more than an impulse set and with enough extra parts to justify the increase in the price. a good set for a little gift or so on, the buggy moves well. there's not that much to say really for i can't really think of additional models to build with the parts but then what do you expect for the price. edited by cardinal brick, 26 may 2008 - 06:47 pm.
i recommend this lil set, it's a nice small set, and the vehicle does roll well. i'm sure many young builders would love it
great review 5150 lego! the new camera was well worth it. you´ve got everything well done. i´m looking forward to your next review. meschepers, on may 27 2008, 06:22 am, said: wow. i was skeptical of this coast guard line. though getting to see some detailed pictures of this set i really want to get get it. same here. maybe in two days i can see it in real.
nice review. a must have for my city collection.
great review! this does look like an excellent set; great chopper!
great review! i will get this, but i will wait for a sale. edited by ~vbbn~, 28 may 2008 - 10:54 pm.
thank you for that fine review of a really excellent set, 5150 lego. i never saw a little 'juniorization' done that good before!
thanks everyone for the nice coments! its nice to finaly have a camera that can take some decent photos! makes doing reviews much more enjoyable! klaus-dieter, on may 28 2008, 09:17 pm, said: thank you very much for the nice review, 5150 lego! the helicopter is - apart from that it is very, very big and that it does not include any interior - a very nice set . the most i like the life raft becuase it is simply . nevertheless i don't know if i buy it (probably not) - but it's very nice! two questions : -where can you fasten the stretcher on to haul it up and down? -is the motor working with batteries? klaus-dieter there is no real way to lift up the stretcher. due to the crane arm being in the way there really isn't any room for any kind oflifting straps. the set does include a 1x2 plate with a hinge for the diver to stand on so at least he can hold on to someone, the crane lifts them up and then he can put them in the strechter. thats my guess at least. as far as the motor, i don't believe it uses bateries since you pull out the motor, and all the button does is recoil the winch line back in. i have to say it does a very good job of that, and is very smooth. (as long as you don't have anything to heavy) one detail i forgot to meation is the shark. its nothing new, just the basic shark lego has had around for nealy 2 decades, but it was a detail nothing less.

oky wan kenobi, on may 30 2008, 09:19 pm, said: but i have some questions about the grey new parts in the life raft. are they 1x1 like their counterparts with the clips or 1x2? and can they be held by a minifig by the handle? (...) btw, which jedi has an orange eta 2? i guess it should work with mfs.... hmm.... i think it´s count citrus....
i will certainly add this one to my collection, i already own every other rescue helicopter and i have a feeling this will be the best. just love how its completely enclosed, thanks for the review.

this looks like the best of the new bat sets. it was also in the movie; don't know why they didn't make it sooner.
oke thanks for the tips, but you see that not blurry pics, i've taken them later, so now it will be totaly great pics! who want's the second riddle?
i am gonna have to pick this up, what a grand representation of the tumbler and it would be my first joker minifigure. my lego bat-life is looking up! )tnr(
4olic, on aug 28 2009, 06:59 am, said: if you do not have this set i highly recomend it. if i could, i would. trust me. i haven't seen one with figs for under $200. looking at this review actually makes me sad.
thank you for clearing that up i felt that it was ok to review an old topic, as stated, rather than just go ahead and start a new one. a shame that this set, as all other batman sets, have gone up so highly in value but still all things considering (general after market lego price hikes) it is still a wonderfull set even with its market value today (that is if you can ignore the mrsp).
great review of a great set. i always figured the hoses were welding torches (attached to jetpacks, yeah!) as the whole thing had the vibe of a mobile repair center. much like many of my favorite sets, this one has a base of simple bricks and plates and then from that solid foundation the rest is built out to be decorative or have the action features. this gives sets a very solid feel as demonstrated in this set, the first snowspeeder, and galaxy explorer. the mm armored drilling unit has a more technic base giving it a less solid appearance and though i like the set, that jet that luanches from the back is horrible, partially because of the useless orange containment things. the mega core has a nifty crane instead of a big useless jet. -tohst
norro, on may 29 2008, 01:30 am, said: it's space and i like it... enough said indeed! norro standing up for a space set!
i love the design of the front canopy of this set, but i always felt that they could have done more with the rest of the model. this set is good candidate for customization though. there is quite a bit on unused space inside, especially in the middle section. i want to try putting a technic-style engine into mine at some point, along with the necessary gearing. i got my mcm brand new off ebay some years ago for a pretty good price, but the box was very worn out and the big trans-neon panel, which floats freely inside the box, was a bit damaged. as for the hose/jetpack things, i always assumed that they were either welding torches or flamethrowers. take your pick. quote kinda sad to think that with tlc's recent ban on magnets in their products first time i've heard of that. what are they going to do for the train couplings?
cp5670, on may 28 2008, 08:52 pm, said: first time i've heard of that. what are they going to do for the train couplings? new couplings are going to be available soon. there is a thread with pictures of the new couplings here.
thanks for the review, maybe i can pick one off ebay.
zero1312, on may 29 2008, 08:22 am, said: thanks for the review, maybe i can pick one off ebay. yeah, i got this for only like 19 pounds, pretty cheap. it's a great set! cp5670, on may 29 2008, 08:55 am, said: it looks like you're right about the old magnets. i got a few off pab two months ago but they no longer have them. i guess i should grab some while they're still widely available on bricklink, as they can be useful in a number of situations. on a side note, one interesting thing about this set is that it seemingly had two us/canada names, mega core magnetizer and multi core magnetizer. brickset, lugnet and all the other sites i've seen call it mega, but i have some north american catalogs from that time period that call it multi and the box also says multi on it. i actually didn't know the mega name at all until many years after the m:tron line. hmm... i've never seen it listed as multi, but now i guess it has three names, strange that m:tron is basically the only space theme that had different names depending on region... clonecommando007, on may 29 2008, 10:11 am, said: this does look alot better than the new mm drilling tank. great work! yeah, i should take a comparison, yet the boxart on the mt-101 was pretty cool. sinner, on may 29 2008, 12:29 pm, said: thanks for an answer. i'll shut up now so we can focus on your review... it's okay, i have a question kind of not related to the review.. is there still a space review/moc index now that docking bay has closed? thanks again!
asuka, on may 30 2008, 01:17 am, said: thanks for that fine review of a really classic and impressive m:tron set, inertia! i was in debt to the set, it's so good i just had to make a review, it got here, i built it then took pictures maybe i should buy another... sinner, on may 30 2008, 08:38 am, said: i've never heard an official word (...perhaps i should raise a topic...) but i think that they don't show them any more because it became a support nightmare. what do i mean? i bet tlg was tired of letters and calls saying "timmy can't make this model shown on the box. can you send instructions and the extra parts..." i know that for some recent models they were designed but not published. how do i know this? the creator said so! hmm... i think my parents probably contributed to that when i was younger . anyway, now because of the glorius creation of the internet we can share the instructions... or make them. iron moose, on may 30 2008, 10:00 am, said: i've heard that the alien moon stalker was called the thunderfoot launcher somewhere. ah, yes. here. http://news.lugnet.c...n=51449&t=i&v=a ah, that's interesting, i wonder why they do that?
this super set contains many of the city sets you can get for your mini city hospital. the smallest set is the 7902 car with a doctor. i thought it looked a bit too slow. here is a car you can build with the same bricks. the instruction manual for the ambulance does contain a picture of an alternate model, but it is actually quite hard to build something significantly different. this sets lacks some snot-bricks, so i had to be a little more creative and came up with this ambulance. it is more a hearse than an ambulance. the helicopter has a lot of slopes, so i built a speed boat for those special emergencies. unlike the first two sets, i used far from all the bricks in this. this set does really have some great parts. the brickshelf gallery with some more pictures. is anyone up to the challenge and build some alternate models of the last set in the super pack - the hospital?
a great and very creative work, i especially like the speed boat and the smaller car, just splendid!
these are great! i especially love the speed boat and your ambulance reminds me of ecto -1! (i would take you up on your challenge but i don't own the hospital. it seemed overpriced to me...)
brilliant, a huge amount of creativity there. to do what you did with such limited piece counts is exceptional. they're at least as good as most of the alternate models lego show on sets.
darn you! making us wait like this. meanie.
why!?
looking forward to the review, this looks to be the best of the new batsets. funnily enough, it took me a while to realise ms quinn whacking deino was not on the boxart batbrick away!
grevious, on may 30 2008, 05:03 am, said: *gasp* are you kidding me? honestly, i hate this set. the batbike looks far too blocky, and that hammer truck looks super shoddy and thrown together. the only real reason i'd get it at all would be for the harely quinn figure - but i'd probably just get her separately on bricklink. besides, the tumbler and robin's jetski sets look far better to me. they actually seem to have great vehicle designs. no new villian figures, i know, but still some great old ones. er, wait a minute... oh yeah, hope your review gives the real scoop on this kit, deino. the batbike may look blocky, but the hammer truck is by no means thrown together. read the instructions, it actually has a great assembly. add into the fact it has harley, great wheels, a modable batbike, awesome stickers and awesome pieces and i'd say this was a win. the penguin is a bit of a repeat and the tumbler is too big for me. either way, it's a great set, batman 08 wasn't nearly as bad as i thought it would be, which is great. batbrick away!
my set has arived! and i have build it, what a nice thing! anyone want a review for me? without blurry pics . who want's the second riddle?
thanks for that great and creative review! ) could you, plese make a picture of hq's back? ) goiod day, gentlemen! )
thanks for the review deinonychus! this is an awesome set, it may just be my first batman set
great review! though you really seem to like this set, and it probably is a great one, i'm not a fan of the penguin sub, or at least i'm not from what i see.
thanks a lot! ) i've already ordered it but now i'll be waiting for it even more! ) thanks! )
brickadier general, on may 29 2008, 07:27 pm, said: hi all, so i was at "the wal-mart" yesterday and had the munchies and was looking for something to eat. somewhere along the line, i stopped caring about food and decided to browse the toy department to see what they had lego-wise. thank you very much for that neat review, brickadier general .... i´m glad that you changed your mind, a review of a burger wouldn´t be half that interesting for sure. it´s just a mediocre set to me, but of course it´s always cool to get important mfs in less pricy sets. i like the penguin´s sub from the batcave more, just because they did a fine job on resembling a penguin without using a sticker.... robins craft looks fairly nice, but the most useful parts of the whole set, for me personally, would be those indeed very neat green engines.
thanks for the great review, brickadier general! the sub looks very nice, and i like the idea of a raising periscope (did the batcave sub have that feature?) and the details on the sub look very nice. the inclusion of the penguin, robin and two of those great brick-built penguins really confirms that i'll be getting this, considering that i didn't purchase the batcave. however, i am rather dissapointed that this set is so similar to the vehicles of penguin and robinin repectively in the batcave set. i feel that it only really caters to those who havn't bought the set, and i would've much appreciated different vehicles. overall, a very nice set, perhaps the best of the 2008 wave, despite it's lack of originality. thank you very much for the review bg
i was never considering getting this set as i don't really like batman, but if i found this set and had some money with me, i would buy it! ii would use it for indiana jones or something, and the revolevers and top hats! the only problem i see with the box-art is that the penguin is drowning!
man, tohse mini vehicles and minifigs are sexy as all heck! i love dr.inferno and the female pattern for agent trace (is it just me or she almost "busting out"? ). i love the dr. inferno hair, and the reappearance of spy-clops and gold tooth is simply gold (yes yes, pun intended!) i have to say this is shaping up to be one of my favourite sets, well, ever! batbrick away!
can't wait for the kick @$$ trailer review :d
me want this set
wow. like others have said i was unsure about these when i first heard about them but then looked at the first leaked pics and thought they actually look pretty neat. now i have seen all the reviews i have to have all these sets. at first i was thinking they would be great as parts packs but the more reviews i see the less i want to use them as part packs and just keep them as built (or buy 2 so i can do both !!) can't wait till they hit the shelves in the uk...... thanks for the review
that's an awesome review. and a great set, it seems. with all of this year's star wars (i still haven't got rogue shadow) i can't afford agents too, which is a shame looking at this.
woah, i got to have this set! i shall buy it asap! thanks for the review! expertly done.
splendid review! i love everything on this set. no question 'bout it. somehow i knew i should have saved up and buy that when come to tru...but the sight of turbocar chase and jetpack pursuit was to tempting to pass up.
excellent review by an excellent reviewer on and excellent set. this theme really does seem to be one of tlc's best. edited by plural, 31 may 2008 - 03:24 pm.
wow...i can't believe i thought this line was false...oh crap...sweet! i need to get this!
im not that into mars mission... but this set reminds me of the jungle cutter
you really are an awesome set reviewer, svelte_corps!! thanks very much for this sweet review, so in-depth and detailed, that is one sweet vehicle! it's got three of my favourite things, treads, orange, and big slicey blades! thanks again! ~peace
these new sets are just totally off-the-wall radical :d. it's the little details like the scoops on the blades and the alternate alien energy source (lego didn't even have to include those, but they did!) that show lego are really getting back into their groove this year. the ability to add power functions is just so cool as well, i'm going to pick-up the creator monster dino set for the electronics when the sales hit as svelte has suggested. a very entertaining review, just like the agents mobile command center one :d
this set looks 10 times sweeter with the power functions, too bad i'll have to buy some extra.
nice review the power functions is a nice idea and i ownder if it will appear in any other new sets? regarless if i get this (i decided to just to get what ever looks good in the shops from now on ) im defianltey picking up some of the white visors off bricklink
wow, this thing is very cool. definately no lack of details, and is quite cheap for the bang of the set that you get. for some reason i really love the bay in the back of the detachable ship. quite an improvement from last years line. thank you for the review.
i was going to buy this set anyway, but now i'm even more excited. :d my favorite part of this set is the bay that holds the little cart vehicles.
isn't it a lovely set? i too have one. (modded, of course )
thanks for the great review sveltecorps. i bought some of the mm last year and ended up selling them off for sw. this new set has got me interested in mm again, partly due to your cool review! one question though, did you get this set in aust shops or s@h, just wondering if i should be looking for it yet? edit: sorry just saw your other post saying it was ordered from s@h cheers isc edited by i scream clone, 04 june 2008 - 08:08 am.
really nice review! i love those sweet looking power functions on it, if only the orange bits could be replaced, then you could have a futuristic and motorized jungle cutter anyway, the alien bit was disturbing, but the overly-tall new commanders look very, very cool! all in all, a great set, but i won't be able to buy it, because, in a few days, s@h will become 600$ richer and my wallet will writhe around in pain on the floor.
algernon, on jun 5 2008, 02:03 pm, said: why is it that agents and star wars get their own news articles but this fantastic set is totally ignored? i think maybe there's a bit of star wars excitement on the front page which has probably got a few members frothing with excitement. not every review needs to be frontpaged anyway .
thanks for the review, mr. mandalorian! this is an, er, interesting set. lots of frontal fire-power. very big too, and i like the idea of those two little craft that attach on the sides. sort of like little escape pod things. anywho, not one of the things on my to buy list, but i do like that radio-active sticker, that could come in use. looking forward to seeing your modifications, too! ~peace

great review, mr. boba fett. i really like this set a lot. some of the features may not be as good as i hoped they would, but overall this looks to be a really nice set. i'm so happy that the giant spacecrafts are finally back. quote i've noticed a trend that the larger sets have plenty of parts potential but when assembled the model is not more than the sum of the parts... eagle base certainly didn't seem worth the asking price, at least this is one large model. on a positive note the lame aero tubes, darts and martian carrier pods have disappeared. hm, actually, i don't see the comparison. eagle base looked terible to me right from the start, so it was no suprise when it ended up being the weakest kit in the first year. this big ship, on the other hand, looked great as soon as i saw it, and still looks good.
iron moose, on jun 4 2008, 02:15 pm, said: do tell. (i'm being curious, not confrontational. ) well, first and foremost like many other people i'm no fan of those dreaded unprinted minifig torsos and stickers. but also the cost to piece ratio of the set, it just seems too expensive for everything that you get, such as too many small parts and a lighter than usual piece count for the price. though if it had included printed minifigs and other elements, i maybe would of been able to swallow its 100 usd cost a little easier. but star justice is still lego space in the most classic sense thats available today, and i will probably pony it up just because... anyway, i hope were not breaking forum protocol by not discussing the 7644 review of the original poster or that particular set in general.
sorry mr. mandalorian, i guess i was just getting a bit defensive because when this set first appeared here, there were literally 2 pages of people just bagging out the new mm sets (but then the thread took a turn and people started to warm to them, much like the agents). i do agree that it definitely needs some mocing, but with that work i think it has the potential to be a really amazing set in terms of what you could cram into it. the lab is a little disappointing, i've always wanted an enclosed cabin space in a vehicle this size because then all the little space guys can have a true meeting place! the drop-down landing ramp is my favourite part, it has lots of potential uses. maybe it's even possible to integrate pneumatics :d
i didn't see this one coming... probably because that huge white beard got in the way! was this "shadows impersonates aluvar" week or something? ok, this wasn't the worst thing i've ever seen. we can try a real one in the future. the not too near, but maybe not too far future. i guess. where is that a map of, anyway?

hello all eurobricks members, i will be presenting my first review on one of the harry potter's set. firstly, i must emphasize that i am not a very big harry potter fan or owned many harry potter sets. for this review, i will be highlighting what is the beauty of this small little set, and the reasons to own multiple sets of it. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. this set is featured in the harry potter movie, prisoner of azkaban. this set is orignally released in 2004, align with the harry potter's movie. this was actually one of the movie scene where buckbeak the griffin is appeared in the movie. the group of students are supposed to be having up close and personal with him. however, draco decided to disturb our lovely buckbeak. enough of this movie synopsis, i am sure fans of harry potter will know this better. box art featured mini-fig/creature background scene the scene is a simple garden, which had a very good mixture of spare parts for your mocs building. on its own, there is nothing outstanding about this set, except for the griffin. you can buy multiple sets for the griffin alone and for draco mini-fig. well, you don't need lots of draco. but for castle lovers, black cap are exceptionally useful, at least from my view. now, i will point out the following why this sets is so great for other reasons. hidden cover note that, this is the only mechanism which you can find in this set. it looks rather simple but quite useful. there are some little things hide in it too. greens, foilage and brown parts needless to say much, it offer 3 foilage, a green plant, 3 brown slopes, 2 ideal bricks and 1x1 brown brick for building a tree. great for jungle building, forest building and etc. i am sure there are many builders will look out for these. interesting parts it comes with a wizard book, owl, 2 printed tiles with a spider and stone prints on it. the far right, seriously i don't find any good use for it. can any eb members enlighten me on that gray thing on the right? grey parts it comes with a good 10 x 4 green plate. useful for adding as a platform. some more grey slopes for your mocs. there you have it, draco encounter with buckbeak comparing with deep forest ambush as you may remembered recently, there was an impulse set competition. one of my entries, which is under the history theme. the deep forest ambush was firstly inspired by this set, and made an improvement out of it. look at the improved tree compared with the orignal. summary review playability: 4/10 (not much to play with, except swooshing around the griffin) design: 5/10 (too simple and its defintely not related with the movie scene) parts: 10/10 (great for parts, explained by the review. a great deal of green and brown parts) price: 9/10 (an inexpensive set based on the 2004 pricing) overall: 7/10 (a must have for all harry potter fans and collectors whom needs a great use of green and brown parts) hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. more pictures can be found in my brickshelf (when moderated) let the potter magic begans! edited by whitefang, 09 june 2008 - 02:45 pm.
this is one of the few sets i've bought more than one (2!) of. it has a really good selection of pieces, and your review really does it justice, whitefang. multiple hippogriff/griffins on! edited by shoc, 11 june 2008 - 05:58 pm.
mr spielbrick, on jun 11 2008, 04:28 pm, said: ohhh great idea to review the "old" potter sets! especially the line from prisoner of azkaban... i was in my dark ages then. luckily i was able to catch up on the missed figs with one internet order. this draco is the best tlc has made, if you ask me. the new one (also doubling for belloq and "guards" in the indy line) doesn't look quite as hautain as this one. buckbeak looks cool. looks like his neck/head can be moved, right? rather similar to lego horses. well designed. the orange brick doesn't have a pumpkin face on it, right? unlike the one from philosopher's stone in the set with the troll. i'm looking forward to more reviews by you, sir whitefang! good work no printed face on the pumpkin since the event didn't happen on or near halloween, unlike the whole troll situation i also agree that this draco is the best one, the new one looks too much like a draco from the oldr films, when he smirked a lot more, but, since very character got a redesign...they had to "tune him up" even if it meant changigng him for the worse
guys, thanks for your comments! glad you find this review useful! and be sure to watch out for more old sets reviews. mr spielbrick, on jun 12 2008, 12:28 am, said: this draco is the best tlc has made, if you ask me. the new one (also doubling for belloq and "guards" in the indy line) doesn't look quite as hautain as this one. buckbeak looks cool. looks like his neck/head can be moved, right? rather similar to lego horses. well designed. mr spielbrick, thanks for pointing out some important highlights for the review. i have overlooked it earlier. i strongly agreed with you, that this draco is the best tlc made. i pretty like the face compared to others. furthermore, i used my multiple dracos, for my castle armor guards instead. one could not have too many dracos. buckbeak design is well made. the head can be moved upwards and downwards. the mechanism is similar to the horse design. in addition, buckbeak wings can be removed. similar to the typical green or black dragon wings that we used to see in the past. well, the main reason for me to buy this set was in fact buckbeak. you don't often find a griffin lying around except in harry potter sets. mr spielbrick, on jun 12 2008, 12:28 am, said: the orange brick doesn't have a pumpkin face on it, right? unlike the one from philosopher's stone in the set with the troll. sorry to said, there is no print on that pumpkin face. it's pure orange.
nice review. i like the treemaking pieces the most of this not very expensive set. the buckbeak fig is very nice and can bow his head like the horses. i was annoyed to get another draco without some other not made figs (pansy parkinson for example). about the dark bley feathers; in the second version of hogwarts there were several of these feathers put in little 1x1 cones like it was a feather to write with it. i bought 2 sets of these and when they were for sale i just bought +/- 6 more of it. only annoying that i had then even a bigger army of draco's.
i see a lot of good reviews on this site, but this one is superb! good job. tom
i'm looking forward to getting this set, as well. the hippogriff will become the valiant steed to my princess minifig for her comic adventures. i'm really annoyed that the harry potter sets were released during my "dark age". i so would've wanted all of them.
yay! the monster book of monsters! now i want this! i also love the buckbeak figure! it looks very realistic for a lego version of something, usually they are much worse (look at the goblins, for example)
hello eb! yes, i'm cranking out the reviews! the other day i picked up this gem for an okay sales price at devonport, tas, while searching for the new batsets. i informed iamded of this as he is a spidey-suckup ( ) and he informed me this was the only set he didn't have of the wave 2 of this theme. so i ask you great eb members to please remind him of this when commenting! here we go with the review of doctopus' lair: anyway, unlike other reviews, this stars more people, the batbrick-iamded-dragonator-daisy review! (daisy is the mouse that came in the set) first up re the figs, and i must say they are great. i love fleshies and these are excellent to expand my batman world, plus having a spiderman to beat up is good too doctopus is great, though his tentacles are annoying to keep in order. peter parker is a nice addition, i love that torso. eve though harry osborn was totally absent from this scene, i welcome him as he is a good fig also. best of all is mary jane, fleshie females are hard to come by and i love that hair, my very first one! oh, and even better is bley daisy on the far right: another fantastic thing is that by mixing mj with doctopus you get a far more deadly and real villain than anyone could've forseen - the hippy! oh c'mon, tell me that ain't cool? anyhoo, here is a pic of doctopus showing his might: random fact: did you know i influence both dragonator and iamded in their sigfigs? dragonator adapts his from my ia series while iamded added mutt hair when i had him like that in a pic i posted. now onto the box, sorry about the lighting. the art is good and the cartoon spidey in the corner may have beenthe inspiration for a similar style in the new batsets: back of the box. again, sorry about the lighting and blur, it was gtting late and these were the last pics: finally we get to the first part of the set: the catapult. is that movie accurate or what? i love the part in sm2 when he uses his homemade genetic spider powered catapult to launch himself to the scene! oh well, it does comes with a cool spider web an trans blue spider, so it gets some points: and it is really fun! i launched spidey several metres once, i don't think he ever recovered. infact, he almost certainly webbed himself slightly cooler extras are these two. this awesome little boat is great for city, as is the simple but nice bouy, daisy approves: naturally dragonator ruins everything when he found out the "dragon" that would be riding with him was our nickname for daisy now finally, the main attraction - coctopus' dock. iamded and i threw dragonator in the water to see if he could swim. he er, couldn't one sweeney todd later, we continue! the overall construction of the building is very good. i know a lot of people hated stickers and i hated applying these, but they do look spectacular and perfect for any city setting, like a bank, a gotham bank as iamded has already noted below me the black lifesavers a very cool as are the web piece and log pieces: the inside contains the neutron copperplate triple bypass humdrum holy hum 5000, which does does, see movie. anyhoo, it is very cool, and includes a little control thingy on the yellow brick next to it. unfortunately, the inside is plain but for that: the other side has no wall too which is a bit of a letdown really, but atleast it allows daisy easy access. one gripe is those yellow 1x1 bricks, they serve no purpose and break up the colour scheme: better shot of the thingy thing. i quite like it, the use of technic parts actually works, and the whole set is worth it for those purple flames and dishes alone it closes up pretty well too, unable to hit the dish which is a nice feature: me and iamded liked it so much we threw a revived dragonator into it. unfortunately it disagreed with him, but it was fun: another shot of the dock. i like how they have gaps in the jetty, i know the movie version was pretty wack, and although the set isn't very faithful to it (looks more like a seaside library to be frank) it still is very nice. this is my first large blue baseplate too which is wonderful, though funny how the set only uses about half of it: the roof is a well designed and fun feature, it uses some technic connections to render it flexible of any degree, as you can see here by my opening of it: better shot of the roof design, it can lie flat or at any angle. i might use the design myself in the future: as much as i love the building this feature bugs me, for in order for it to work this wall has to stick out, which not only looks ugly but makes you be able to see through the corners. still, easily modded, and log pieces are fantastic for mocing. it also means that there are 7 windows all up for a good, sizeable building: by pulling out the piece in the center the walls both collapss sideways outwards, which is actually pretty fun and works everytime: overall view of the set including characters: now for the story that makes no sense....at all: spiderman is dead after falling down the wall mechanism (see above): only daisy can save the day! for dragonator is being held by the evil doctopus! and iamded and dragonator are too busy not caring! and brainbox is too busy complaining that this goes against all marvel continuity! unfortunately daisy is on a lunchbreak so tough luck dragonator: and daisy goes on a search for fortune and glory: okay, this is what i think of the set: build: 3/5 - fun, but those stickers ruin the experience somewhat, and if you don't apply them the instructions are a bit hard to follow. playability: 4/5 - great little gizmos and bits, not the kind that keep you going like with the 2007 aquabase, but good fun still. design: 4/5 - not very movie faithful no, but still a great little building and a smart design for certain aspects. minifigs: 5/5 - great figs with all different faces and very useful bits. price: 2/5 far, far overpriced even on sale sadly total: 18/25 - a good set that could've been better with a few minor changes. nothing wrong with it, but it doesn't really cross the line to greatness. that said, it has a lot going for it and definitely worth buying or atleast a look! thanks for reading batbrick away! edited by batbrick, 13 june 2008 - 12:21 pm.
i got this set in 2006 in a 'byrnes world of wonder' toy shop. i dont remember how much, but it was a deal. the box was all battered but it had everything. good review batbrick.
thanks for the review, even if it is a number of years late. i picked this up whn it came out, and thought it was a rather cool set (besides the catapult). plenty of cool pieces, and the baseplate has found a use in the batcave. although i think my dad managed to spill some beer on it at one point. that was awful to clean off... batbrick, on jun 13 2008, 10:44 am, said: and brainbox is too busy complaining that this goes against all marvel continuity! i wasn't expecting that! there i was, casually scrolling down, when i stumbled onto a picture of me.
great review batbrick, i was curious as to what the interior of the building looked like, i still think that there should have been a few random chains or something lying around as they may add to the abandoned feeling that the ware house had. though i have to admit that i really like the roof dock and minifigs as some of them make good average civilians that are somewhat hard to come by in todays sets . great comic as well it seemed to add a lot to your review, hope you can review another spider man set soon . btw as adam mentioned i believe you owe me a bar of soap, for reading your review ... edited by mack, 14 june 2008 - 12:59 am.
great review. the hippy and the "story" at the end were hilarious. i think this was easily the best of the spiderman 2 sets. you're right though - it wasn't movie acurate, as the actual movie dock was far shabbier and more trashed than this. ah well, i guess tlc couldn't do everything.
batbrick, on jun 13 2008, 09:44 pm, said: for dragonator is being held by the evil doctopus! and iamded and dragonator are too busy not caring! wait... dragonator's not caring that he's being held by doc ock? what are you doing? a very nice finish to the interview, now i really want this set! the story at the end was neat (except for spidey dieing! ) but my favourite part was the exploding dragonator. nothing personal mate, it just looks cool when people are thrown into fusion reactors! ~peace
thanks for the detailed review valentin it had good picture quality and a nice little comic near the end. although this is a slightly older set it still was a good one, i remmeber that i bought two of them to build up a small airforce for the republic, and if i see another one i may buy it for use in the starwars comic game. keep up the good work .
thanks for another great review. i remember getting a few v-wings cheaper because the boxes had been crushed on their way to the store. not an "all-that" set, but still a fine parts pack with a decent design. kimt
nice review! i would have snapped this up back in 2006 if i was not in my dark ages!
valentin, great review! nice to see you here in eurobricks. this fighter looks real neat. by the way, bricksworld pricetag is still visible in your box-art.
thanks for the review; i've always liked that one but haven't had a chance to get it. now i'm sold- or the set will be sold- to me !

i picked up this set mainly because of the many (5+spare) glow in the dark parts and the promise of 2 racers and one helicopter for the price of a little more than two racers (90kr. vs. 2x40kr.) the box the back of the box shows the two alternate models you can build if the polybags rip. there are 3 cheese slopes and two 1x2 tiles that glow in the dark, where the tiles are exclusive for this set. the total parts count is high at 142, but there are no really big pieces among them. inside the box you will find the building instructions, a sheet with some odd sticky labels (thrown away) and 3 polybags marked by the bag building difficulty. the models the lime colored car doesn't bring out anything new. we have seen racers built like that before, but it does contain some nice bricks for the collection. the police cruiser surprises with an interesting design along the sides as seen here. it is harder to build because of the greater level of details: the helicopter is without doubt the hardest vehicle to build in a bag. i can't finish it because it's larger than the bag. you can't put on the top blades nor the tail of the thing, so it beats the forklift from 7733 where the top bar is the new kind that doesn't completely fit. there is also instructions for the alternate models, but it requires the bags to be opened... the vehicles are pretty standard for the racers theme with the police car being the highlight of the set conclusion i like the difficulty curve between bag 1 and 2, but the last bag should be labeled 1000000 instead of 3. it requires some inhuman skills to build that helicopter in the bag... ? lime colored car: 3 - we have seen it before, but it has some nice pieces... and lime. police cruiser: 9 - it has a massive diffusers, rare parts and a high level of details. it is a shame lego relies so much on stickers. helicopter: 6 - if you see it as a set for one fourth of the price of the cars, it is quite amazing, but you can't bag build it and i would personally prefer some more detail instead of the big size. overall it is a nice little set, but the police car is the main attraction. i wouldn't get the other vehicles if they were sold separately. brickshelf gallery edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 07:03 pm. indexed
adik_sa_lego, on jun 17 2008, 10:02 am, said: now now, don't judge people who do this. there have been bigger sets that were done in the bag. to each his own :) you make it sound like i did something deeply socially deviating... like being an adult playing with lego but back on topic. open the bags? if they were meant to be opened, why did lego close them in the first place? bag building is not for everybody. some might become very frustrated with it and let their anger out on the set by lining it up on a mini golf course.
i mean by the clone turbo tank turned into the at-at i think in the films. when they changed all there technology and vehicles when they became the empire.
smith_boy, on jun 20 2008, 06:01 pm, said: i doubt that. the atat was used in the clone wars. well you never know, maby veers was around then, just because it was used in the clone wars dosent mean that veers didn't design it. to wookiepedia!
thanks for the review kimt - it comes at a... confusing time you can take off the top disk and lift it like the millennium falcon from the top now. i actually don't like this set that much. it takes about 5 hours and 15 minutes to build if you do it in one go, but the repeating sections makes this built the most tedious i have experienced. it has way too many holes from which you can see the colorful skeleton and is overpriced compared to the older 10030 isd. i remember thinking it was too expensive when it was 50% off at s@h! even the snowspeeder was "kewler" to less than half the price:
thanks for the review. eh, honestly, i though this was awful ever since i first saw the pictures. to me, an incomplete grey ball doesn't really work as a special ucs kit, for the sole reason that it's boring. extremely so. now, the new death star playset is a whole different story. they should have done that in the first place. edited by grevious, 24 june 2008 - 09:12 pm.
even though i never liked ucs, i absolutley hate this one. sure, its great on display, but the build looks extremley boring to me, just stacking plate after plate. and as you said, its going to break a little if you touch it. the only intersting part for me is the firing laser. although i do have to say the proce isnt too bad, i still wouldt buy it. and no minifigs so thanks for the review, but ill pass on this one. the new minifig scale ds looks awesome though, and this might have hyped some up who are buying the new ds,

great concise review kimt, though its not for me, you held my interest all the way through! thanks isc
thanks for the review kimt! honestly, like the others have said, i don't find any appeal in ucs sets, especially this one. it's just a big, incomplete, grey ball.
lasse d, on jun 25 2008, 06:04 pm, said: here are some advantages that makes isd win for me: - a lot more fun to build with less repetitions - it is easier to build alternate models from it! (how many alternate models of the ds2 have you seen?) - the bricks are more varied. - you get magnets! - it is a larger set if you look at the size - it's more intresting to look at - it's got more variety of nooks and crannys
wow, what a letdown. i recently picked up this set, and i looked up this review to see what i was getting into. not good news. the silver lining is that it was a "damaged box" deal at brickworld, so it only cost me $100 (half off the already lowered price) so it was definatley worth it as a parts pack, if nothing else. it's the last unopened/unbuilt "large" kit in my collection, so even if it is repetetive, i am going to build it anyway. it is likely however that i may substitute pieces to do away with the colored interior. i've already determined that after it sits on display for a while, i want to do a zepplin as an alternate build. looking at the parts list it looks like its the perfect set for such an undertaking.
i'd love to get my hands on one of these, but you'd need about three jobs to justify the prices of this guy on ebay. fantastic review kimt!

i bricklinked it too back in the day. it was an interesting build - just thought building the "unfinished" hemisphere was kind of tedious.
you should have posted the entire review up! i am about to look at the gallery for the rest of the pics. edit: as soon as i post the images came thats weird. nice review, is there more it says i'll be back? good first review! edited by skipper 24, 26 june 2008 - 09:11 pm.
sorry about that skipper, i added the topic after the first pic was uploaded just to make sure the pics would be in the post. you probably posted while i was editing it. and i had to go to visit my grandparents, im at their house right now. sorry if you got freaked out!
very nice review jim! i haven't bought this set yet, but am planning to just to get a gg fig as i don't have one already. bought an imperial landing craft instead this week as it was on sale, but after this review, gg's fighter is sure to follow soon benny
does the sliding cockpit come off easily? my friends brothers breaks everytime you touch it, but he may have built it wrong. it put me off the set.
yeah! general grievous starfighter will land in my house! greate set, i love decals - brown and sandy pattern... ingenious! btw. when you show sith infiltrator review? i wait... :)
nice work jim for your first review. i must admit the set didn't really appeal to me at first, but your review has definitely shown off the cool functions built in to this ship, well done! cheers isc
nice review, i bought a couple of these for parts, the only thing i dont like about the ship itself (not the lego version, it does fine) is why is the grand droid general flying around in in a small fighter like this, i prefer the battlefront interpretation witch uses it as a bomber. anyway, great review! -york
thanks again, you guys. dont worry, the sith infiltrator review will be up this week. my computer has viruses, but now i got firefox (complete with spell check!), so i should be able to go on the internet ok from now on.
great review! i would get the set, but i'm saving for the clone wars sets.
its a good review but you forgot another thing. the troll needs a shiled like they used to in the 2007 castle line the sets always had shields for the minifigs and it could be better if it was 3.00 instead of 3.50 but yes it is a good impulse great army builder.
a more affordable troll warrior for those of us avoiding the large sets (me) is always nice! thanks for the review! god bless, nathan

nice review, i will definately need a few of these!
whitefang, on jul 3 2008, 04:06 am, said: i thought by calling it as a "mouse", it will be a little much friendly unlike calling it a rat. why is mouse friendlier than rat?
looking at this is making me want to build one of the favourite sets of my childhood, 6649 street sweeper (might do that today actually). cheap. good pieces (despite the lack of a bin lid... that's just inviting disaster isn't it?), nice fig, and one of those blue brushes, which i've always loved but never managed to use. thanks whitefang.
glad you guys like the review. brainbox, on jul 3 2008, 06:19 pm, said: looking at this is making me want to build one of the favourite sets of my childhood, 6649 street sweeper (might do that today actually). cheap. good pieces (despite the lack of a bin lid... that's just inviting disaster isn't it?), nice fig, and one of those blue brushes, which i've always loved but never managed to use. the 6649 looks lovely, and i hope you managed to restore it. indeed, a bin without a lid is inviting trouble.
thank you for the nice review. the set is nice, the pieces are nice. and the grey helmet is great for an additional star wars rebel technician.
hello all eurobricks members, this will be my last impulse set review for the second wave. hope everyone of you will find my reviews useful and helpful in your purchase. name: crystal hawk theme: lego system / mars mission year: 2008 pieces: 26 minifigs: 1 an image of a 5619, crystal hawk alpha 3 in sector 5, reporting to base alpha 3, crystal hawk, reporting for duty, sir! may i present mars mission, latest scout craft, code named "crystal hawk". this spacecraft looks very sleek and cool with its usual white and orange color combination. i am not a fan of mars mission, but these white mini-figs simply attracted me for it. in fact, i only owned its impulse sets, and none of its main sets. nevertheless, this set has the "swoosh" factor. i was swooshing around in my home last night. well, i am not swooshing it like kimt though. am i seeing double? haha, the answer is "no". it has double sided face. i combined the pictures, to illustrate the two facial expressions. bits and pieces different angles love the way how the wings bend upwards and downwards. the only thing i find it a little bit wierd for spacecraft. normally, i thought joystick is the typical navigation controls for a spacecraft instead of a steering wheel? i am not complaining about a steering wheel in a spacecraft. to me, it's quite an uncommon sight. anyway, the white steering wheel is an useful part for making vehicles mocs. summary review playability: 8/10 (fun to play with when you bend the wings up and down.) design: 8.5/10 (design is simple, but creates a sleek and cool look.) price: 8/10 (an inexpensive set to get more scout craft and mars mission mini-figs) overall: 8.5/10 (a very good set to have for any mars mission fans, and for collectors like me whom can't afford all mars mission sets, this set is a very great alternative.) hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my brickshelf (when moderated)
one of the better impulse sets imo.
glad you enjoyed viewing the review. xenologer, on jul 3 2008, 01:12 pm, said: the hawk, it seems to me, lacks a cockpit, theres not even a seat to keep the pilot from falling off. perhaps it they'd redesigned it to be a backpack jetpack sort of unit using similar pieces, it'd at least make some sense? these are some of the improvements which we can do it ourselves to mod it better. i think these are great suggestions. otherwise, we can add in a white air tank to be included onto the mini-fig. xenologer, on jul 3 2008, 01:12 pm, said: based on the other mm impluses, can we assume this goes for 3.5$usd? at that price it seems to me, that the astro fighter at 5$usd was already a superior impluse set. guess i'd buy one on clearance, for the minifig. in s@h, crystal hawk is priced at usd $3.50. i bought mine at a much expensive price, when you compared it with usd. i never bought the astro fighter. i am supposed that it comes with a little bit more parts and an additional alien fig with it.
thank you for the nice review. this set has a very classic space feeling, so i don't care about the lack of cockpit. a nice little set with a nice minifig.
nice set review i really liked the narrative for the review. i must have missed your custom base back in june, also well constructed and great story too!
i'm still keeping my money payments until july 26th ...so i won't be able to buy this set unless i get some money prize or something however, i appreciate the review, and hopefully i will get this set sometime in the near future. i just love these new cybernetic arms
omg iamded's torso! [ spoiler] oh my god!![ /spoiler]
woo! rock raiders! only the best theme ever! (that's right, possibly even better than castle `07!) cheers for the review metalandi, hopefully you can inspire others to see the greatness of rock raiders too! i love how everything was so simple, yet so effective. it was loads of fun to play with and build the alternate models when i was younger as well (and probably still is ). do you plan of doing any other reviews? or do you have any other sets? rapid rider is another great small one, adding a bit of diversity with a water-based vehicle, and you get the bandit minifig. or you could get the rock raiders set, and get all of our spelunking friends (don't make me name them all ). or, if you want a slightly bigger set, loader dozer could be the way to go, axle's a pretty cool minifig too, and you get a rock monster. sorry if the last comments were detracting from your review, don't think i didn't like it, becuase it was great! i really hope you can do more! oh, and yes, my torso does come from a female fig... ~peace
unfortunately i dont have any other sets yet, i think i got one of the bigger vehicles back in the time, but i don't have any sets from this time anymore. but i certainly plan to get the loader dozer and/or the chrome crusher soon. i found an ebay auction where somebody is selling the sets 4940, 4950 and 4970 new & sealed hopefully i have luck with that. it's only at 4 euros right now, but it's still running 6 days... http://cgi.ebay.de/w...t...a:it&ih=005
i got this set last year. and i think you made a mistake when you have remove a piece to access the probe droids and equipment, you just have to slide the entire main part. and i have a question, is this equipped with the new flick-fire missiles that don't fall off?

a very neatly designed sith infiltrator, though i think it lacks the size of the older version. a fine ship, but not what i would call a sith infiltrator. it should be bigger. thanks for another fine sw review kimt
i can't see the pics over the glare from my awesomeness!! thanks for the review rez!! i'm jealous you got to snag this right away...
it was £34.99 so usd its likely to be $45-$55 i would imagine.
great review. this set totally owns alpha team deep sea. the sub design actually looks like a sub, the figures are way better, the acessories are better - everything is better! agents may have my vote for the best theme of the year. quote i wonder if it will last longer than one year (unlike other recent one-and-done themes). oh don't worry - a second wave will be coming next year. this was confirmed by both legomilk and in an interview with an agents designer.
i forgot to comment on this review! great job rezourceman, like svelte-corps said your pics really show off the set and what there is to it. i just ordered this and the volcano base off s@h and i can't wait for them to come, so i'll comment on these reviews i forgot about i love the inferno boat, as you say in your review it looks very heavy duty and ready to take on the agents. the sub i quite like from the look of it, though there is the problem of too little space i will try and correct that. the dark blue is especially good. and i love slime face, his torso is very cool. svelte_corps, on jul 11 2008, 09:14 am, said: i can't say this is my favourite agents set; the boat is a little oddly proportioned and the sub, although retro looking, has practically no interior and would be difficult to customise to put more in (unlike, say, the clever job batbrick did with the penguin sub in his review). wow, thanks for that little mention is it impossible or just very hard to mod? svelte_corps, on jul 11 2008, 09:14 am, said: i do agree with you about slime face - he has a fantastic torso with all the slime dripping down which is a bit obscured by the air tank. it's really encouraging that in the last 2 missions we've had great extra villains added in. the only thing i would add about the octopus is that the glow in the dark plastic is mixed in unevenly with the aqua blue, so it doesn't glow in the dark evenly - it's kind of like the mars mission jellies in that respect though much cooler! the octopus sounds great, thanks for that, is he meant to be on any side? i'm guessing he's a mutant inferno creature. about slime face, is his head much different to the joker bombs? i know he has slime marks on his head, are they very apparent? thanks again for the review! batbrick away!
inertia, on jul 21 2008, 12:29 pm, said: wow, thanks for the review, that is one awesome set, i think we need some new agents, there's so many inferno minifigures now... maybe next year? there's only 2 infernos out of 8 sets which is pretty good. there's way more agent chases and break jaws. i agree though, next year hopefully we'll have some new figs.
this is a great little set. i like how it combines two very different color schemes for different parts of the model. i have made some slight modifications to mine, adding a roof on the vehicle and a back wall on the outpost. also, those white 1x1 headlight plates at the front are thinner than the modern kind and seem to be quite weak. i got this set off ebay a while ago and one of them was broken in shipping, even though the set was otherwise in display model condition, and the other one broke off while i was building the set. i replaced them with the newer variety. mutex, on jul 10 2008, 11:37 pm, said: my only complain about this set was that i found that the wheels where too small , i had some trouble passing the rover over the little "craters-mountains" of the space plates the only bad thing about this set is the name. it can't even roll over a single plate's height. not very "all terrain" at all. edited by cp5670, 11 july 2008 - 07:43 am.
give me an excuse to sneak into your house, and let me have a feel of these classic space sets. i never had a chance to have any experience with the classic space sets. through your recent reviews on these, it gave me a wider perspective of space. i loved to play space as a child such as the late classic and futuron sets. back to the review, this 6927 is a great mobile command center vehicle suitable for all kinds of harsh terrain in the unknown space. the 6 big wheels are real solid and firm back in those days. transparent blue windscreen at the front, is wonderful. i just love these parts, especially when it's in blue. 4 computer printed tiles. aren't lego so generous back in those days, when printed parts are more commonly available unlike now. it's a real nice set. however, there is one thing i don't understand about this design. why is the driver seat has a wide back with no cover behind? and, the command center has no door at the back? i understand that these space guys are always carrying their helmet around, for oxygen supply. i wonder if there is a better answer to it.
quote great buy on this one. what did it cost you? it was $30, which was a pretty good price given the condition. it had no box or instructions though. this set is actually fairly common on ebay though, considering how old it is. i see them pretty frequently on there. quote it's a real nice set. however, there is one thing i don't understand about this design. why is the driver seat has a wide back with no cover behind? and, the command center has no door at the back? i understand that these space guys are always carrying their helmet around, for oxygen supply. i wonder if there is a better answer to it. i just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed: edited by cp5670, 11 july 2008 - 06:39 pm.
i've always associated this set with 6929, the voyager. they're of the same timeframe and more or less the same style. 6927 is without any doubt my favourite ground vehicle of space. it was pretty simple, but it was such a creative set. the stories you could tell with this model... g... most defenitely in my top 5 of space sets...
wow! that brings back memories. i have that model too (in storage somewhere). the pictures are great. i will definitely be checking out more of your reviews.
thanks for the review, looks like a great set. i'm surprised that spongebob's bandage has a full body headprint so kudos to lego for that
oh so spongebob was the injured one. i thought this set depicted the episode wherein mr. krabs was the one rushed to the hospital.
thanks for the review! the interior looks nice, better than i expected, lots of great parts but, as you say, so many of them are stickered. after rocket ride, the stickers in the sb sets seem to have gone crazy - the early sets weren't slathered in them. 2 new figs though is most welcome.
how much euro did you pay for it? it looks a great set, great interior, nice figures and funny posters. :) it's also nice: the newest spongebob sets are now also available in our stores and they are the coolest (belgium)!
nice review, the set looks promising.
thanks navy trooper fenson for the review - good one ! i really like that sb is printed! i will need to get this one when i go to the us in two weeks. copmike

aw, sinners' playing with toys again! great review! the set is good for parts it appears. and that bedroom scene is...interesting.
svelte_corps, on jul 12 2008, 03:19 pm, said: 2 questions though. 1) was it a fun build? 2) are those large figs anatomically correct under their frou-frou finery? if not, what the hell are they doing in the second pic whilst baby sylvia explores the oven? it was sort of fun, but it really is just a lot of big pieces. the kitchen stove is smart though. as for the figs, yes i forgot to add pictures of the happy couple! here they are. hinckley, on jul 12 2008, 03:27 pm, said: when your daughter outgrows it, will you turn it into a belleville star wars moc please? thank you in advance it could be a while; ask me again in three years. wout, on jul 13 2008, 03:58 am, said: why haven't they not made a saussagesseller for city. maybe in the future. there are already more chickenlegs in minifigs sets. i agree. there's a good chance of me borrowing certain parts in the future. whitefang, on jul 13 2008, 07:07 pm, said: sinner, you are a very nice dad! i like how parents, buy educational toys for their children to expand their imaginations instead of sitting in a couch playing video games and etc. thanks, but i must confess she does play with our ps3 too... ~vbbn~, on jul 15 2008, 11:30 am, said: aw, sinners' playing with toys again! when did i stop? elishelrot, on jul 15 2008, 05:54 pm, said: thanks for your report and the pics, my sister wants this set, but she's already got the last house and she doesn't play very often with it, but the new one looks very good, too i'm still undecided on if it was a smart buy. she played with it a lot this week, but last week she ignored it... and i had to fix it twice!
sinner, on jul 25 2008, 09:47 pm, said: i'm still undecided on if it was a smart buy. she played with it a lot this week, but last week she ignored it... and i had to fix it twice! my daughter is 12, and she still plays with all her belville stuff (mostly the fairy princess castle sets). if your daughter is anything like mine, you will definitely get your money's worth out of it. however ... as soon as my daughter says she's done with it, i plan on raiding the sets for all those great food and accessory bits. patience .... great review, by the way. the belville sets are indeed overpriced, but they're probably lego's best attempt at wooing the girl audience (i still hate the fact that tlc thinks they need separate "boy" themes and "girl" themes, but whatever). they're a very nice alternative to barbie -- you get posable figures with realistic body proportions, plus some creativity and building aspects thrown in.
i recognize the clock! it came with my old airport set 6392 back in 85! in fact according to peeron it mostly came out in train stations link belville looks horrible to me too barbie-ish and does not look lego at all. would prefer they went with paradisa instead.
i got like 5 of theses hope we get the new clone battlepack, do you ever think we will? we will only get 5 clones if you buy all the new republic sets...
nice review jimbutcher , this set is for many reasons awesome but unfortunately i just buy one. now i am planning on buying one more in my wal-mart there are like three in stock but with a high price of $19.99 each so maybe just one and will keep it misb .
thanks for the review very much jim! sooner or later i'll have six sets of this.
thanks for the great review. nice and sharp pics, just the way i like them. keep it up a nice little battle pack, if one is in to those pesky battle droids kimt
hello all eurobricks members and town lovers, this is my first classic town review. for today, i will be featuring the 6641, 4-wheelin' truck which is produced in 1987. for some younger members in eb, you might not have encounter such a baby roaming down the streets, horning at others with its big massive truck. considering this is a 1987 set, such a vehicle size is considered big in those days. name: 4-wheelin' truck theme: lego system / town year: 1987 pieces: 80 minifigs: 1 price: usd$6.50 an image of a 6641, 4-wheelin' truck *hello everyone* why the name 4-wheelin' truck? it is because this truck is equipped with 4 heavy duty wheels which is considered "big" among other small vehicles in classic town. please take note, most of the vehicles that are produced in classic town era, are 4-studs wide. this truck is no exception. meet the driver and his truck! this truck has a very good combinations of different colors that are common for most town vehicles. it made used of blue, white and red as its primary combinations. i find that this combinations is quite soothing to its eyes especially the blue bricks. in addition, the mini-fig torso is superb. the driver must be a great fan of this vehicle. i realised most truck drivers in the classic town era wear this most of the time. i wonder if its some kind of an organization? front view there is 2 red doors coupled with the truck, to enable the driver to get in properly. this vehicle is considered big in the 1980s. however, if you compared it with the current city vehicles, this truck certainly will not outsize the current designs. please take note of the wheels. the wheels are pretty different. i don't remember seeing these wheels in many other vehicles, maybe some members can help me on this. most of the classic town vehicles have a window frame on top which is known as a "sun-roof". in this set, this feature is also included. furthermore, the vehicle frame has a simple mechanism which all town lovers love. it is to lift it up and place their driver in and out the seat. most importantly, you do not have to take off the entire window frame just to put in the driver. different angles of the 4-wheelin' truck snot technique? back 20 years ago, lego had been experimenting with snot technique. you can see that the back looks very neat without the studs. in addition, it can be quite useful to place a mini-fig on top of it, or throw some baggage for some quick getaway. summary review playability: 8/10 (great addition to your town collection.) design: 8.5/10 (very good design. i love 4-studs truck. at least, it is able to occupy one side of the lane) price: 9/10 (an inexpensive set based on the 1987 pricing) overall: 8.5/10 (a must have for all classic town lovers, we have been complaining for more wider range of vehicle) i gave it a "4" based on my review score card. what about yours? hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. pictures can be found in my brickshelf (when moderated) edited by whitefang, 13 july 2008 - 12:08 pm.

dear afol friends, due to leakage of production plant in our country one member of our lego club had bought a new promo set. until now he placed only photo of the box, later on promissed to make a review. heavenly god, i wanna one at all costs! most were found here... edited by sinner, 17 july 2008 - 12:47 am. put photos in
i want it...i want at least five!! where will it be availible?

awww i wanna see it please? edit: omg its all over the interwebs, if you know where it looks amzaing its a giant windmill with a house at bottom edited by pencoin, 14 july 2008 - 05:24 pm.
i had saw the earlier image just now. it looks very nice. just to share some information with you guys. vestas, an global company which is an expert in "wind energy" this is a tie-up with lego. i feel its an illustration on how our world will benefit by applying and believing its technology to make use of re-useable natural resources. hinckley, is it ok for me to share a picture or two on the vestas exhibition that happened few months ago in singapore? don't worry, it's not anything related "directly" to the vestas promo, wind power plant.
god save the save as-function
bagh i missed it all i know is that theres a cottage and van! time for brickshelf no doubt they've been taken down to. edit: awsome just found the brcikshelf pics. edited by skipper 24, 14 july 2008 - 06:05 pm.
that sounds amazing! a wind power plant as a lego set is absolutely awesome and helps the lego city to get environmental energy. regrettably i missed the pics. when browsing through bs i didn't find them, too . can someone please post a link or sent me the link/picture via pm ? thanks. klaus-dieter
i now found pics, too. that's absolutely ! after 10188 town plan this is the best city set ever! i really like the neat landscape with the little hill (there are a bench and some flowers on it, too ) and this brilliant cottage ! great idea with that power function that the wind mill turns and then enable the lights of the cottage ! concerning the city theme i must say: in the last time tlg comes up with one great surprise after the other. does anyone know where and when it'll be available (this year i think - otherwise there wouldn't be already pics, would they?) and how much it'll cost (i think about 70 euros, what do you think?)? i only hope that it'll be available in germany, too, otherwise i would be really if i am not able to get it since it is a must for every city and environment fan! klaus-dieter edited by klaus-dieter, 14 july 2008 - 06:49 pm.
you just bring memory's back i never had one of the space port sets, but i know that as a little boy i visited my toy store and kept on looking to the boxes. on bl those sets cost too much for what ist worth today. really, tlc should bring this theme back! space port on!
in the catalog images i thougt that the base was on a 16'16 baseplate... i have some sets of space-port and like them, but i would want real town sets in 1999... edited by lord santos, 15 july 2008 - 10:58 am.
the spinning machine is a centerfuge. (not sure of the spelling ) i remember wanting this set because my friend had the larger station with full rocket. seeing this makes me want it again.....
i had never seen this set or this theme before. it was released during my dark age, and i had missed it. it's nice to see such sets, surface once again, to educate members like me that there are some good sets we had missed during the dark age. and, i must admit that this is a very good set. it's comes with 3 mini-figs and staudie with it. geez, i never thought he was an astronaunt back then. the testing facility is great, and i love to see it spin, by putting staudie in it for a "test-run". the buggy is cute as well, but somehow, i don't really like the white frame at the back. it looked a little odd to me. the tools, are simply wonderful to have. furthermore, these are grey tools. the last time, we had so many tools are the aeroplane mechanic. the shuttle is nice, but does the shuttle supposed to come with a cover as well? i guess, since this is a simulator, they must have cut down the budget for it. the control room is good, and it will be even better with chairs included. metalandi, thanks for the wonderful review!
stop calling them "manga guards", people, that sounds silly! it's magna guards! sorry, but i just hate mangas. edited by oky wan kenobi, 20 july 2008 - 11:28 pm.

dfenz, on jul 17 2008, 11:42 pm, said: nice review with very clear pics!! i have pre-ordered this item at a local (belgian) store and will be getting it on july 29th, together with the 7676 gunship. wow 59,99eur is a lot of money!! what country do you live in??? here it costed me 46eur, so quite a price difference!!! imo the set's certainly not worth that much money! reki
the figs they're possibly the best part of the entire set, all in all. nice new head, although the glasses limit its usability. i am in love with the head on that fig. it's perfect for any number of figures - a good 'scarred hero' face has always been on my want list. i'm turning him into my viking warlord after i post this review. again, a new head. great stubbly beard thing going on. my second-favorite head of the lot. great for warriors, especially with helms. the torsos are fantastic for special forces figures, if anyone's planning to do something like that. not too fond of the lime green on there, but it's still extremely usable. this is actually a really cool machine gun. i like it. i think this would be a good point to note that all designs you see - outside the figures and dinos - are stickers. that means a crapload of stickers. if you can't stand stickers at all in a set, don't buy this.
as unexpected as it was, this was very helpful! ;) three questions, though: 1. is the front green rubber missle a traditional launchable missle, or does it have another firing mechanism? 2. concerning the guns on the side, are they fixed in one postition, or does it have any functions? 3. why did you decide to buy this set? (just curious!)
great review jay !!!!! tks a lot ;) i am not that of the big fan of the copter due to its proportions - but i admit its really asome looking, better as i expected :od the best are those mfs !!!!!! they are truly awsome !!!!!!! i wiil but some of the smaller sets just for the figs hehe (too bad that my favorite - your second best - don't come in the smallers sets :'( ). are you going to review the other sets as well ??? that could be cool !!!!!
does anyone have photos of the ones being released in europe? i'd like to compare the ones here in the u.s. to the ones in europe...
wow, great review, for a great set. thanks jay. i really like it, although to big for my city. :( i too really like the mfs. because of your review, i am definitely considering it. thanks again, legobmw.
that's interesting news about the european release. i'd definitely be interested to see how they modify the set - chains, ropes, and crates are definitely useful pieces. can't wait for pictures. to everyone looking for just the figures - don't skip out and get the smaller set and the tank. spend the extra $20 and get the t1. it's well worth it. i might pick up the steel sprinter and the fire hammer myself, still trying to decide. if i do, i'll review them.
yeah, i picked up another one. i really liked the chopper! let's cut straight to the chase. dinos: first the worst, of course. these things are so horrible, they don't deserve more than one photo. they're rubbery, one piece, and the only things that remotely indicate that they're made by lego are the holes on the bottom of their feet. they're unrealistic to an extreme unmatched by even the previously reviewed dinos, in that they are waaaaaaaay too thin, one is pink, and they're all grinning. fig: one interesting thing to note is that this one has the same torso as the iron-masked dude in the chopper, not his own bare-arms torso. pic for the sake of comparison. now, i don't consider this fig as good as the others because the other heads are useful for vikings and assorted castle-type people, but this has sunglasses. all in all, you'll probably find it useful, but i don't. still, great torso for special ops stuff. hummer: those headlights - while stickers (yes, all prints are again stickers, although there are much less than the chopper) - are great pieces. i can see using them as furnace covers or stove burners. the windshield/hood area. not much to say about this one. driver's side. my question? when this is brought to europe, will the steering wheel switch sides? ;) seriously though, i love that little steering wheel piece more than i love taffy. and i'm a man who enjoys his taffy. left side in its entirety. ... and the right side. view through the right side - no seat here. could've done with another fig to fill the nonexistant seat, as well.
the... weapon. whatever it's called. this uses the same mechanism as the longboat (for those that don't have either, you snap the little sports stand thing, which hits the 'missile', which fires, and since there's nothing holding the technic beam up to that height any more, it drops down so that the next missile drops into place. pretty cool, if unrealistic.). the two on the side do not fire, i think they're mainly there for 'extra ammo'. my biggest problem with this set. open bed. this could have easily been remedied with a few plates. interior opened. the fire hammer next to the t1. they look very cool together, don't they? you can also see my curio shelf. final score: 7.4/10 dinos: 1/10 fig: 8/10 (but that's just me) hummer: 8.5/10 parts: 9/10 i'm a harsh reviewer. i still think that if space/vehicles are your thing, you should buy this. however, if you're a bigger castle fan, or just like to get all sorts of lego, i would still suggest buying the viking catapult before this. however, i do think that these are some of the coolest sets of 2005. this is something you will eventually want to get. until next time, bloody jay
seeing the pictures in this review certainly reinforce my original thoughts on this set: here's an oil-rig mod waiting to happen...
excellent review metalandi. it's always great to see early pictures of new sets. this set really reminds me of an oil rig, and could probably be easily modified as one (if one wanted an alternate model). the two components that i like most are the boat crane and the control room, but other sections are pretty slick as well. are those printed pieces in the control room, or stickers? i'm really starting to gain an appreciation for these new coast guard sets. they've come a long way over the years: 575 coast guard station -released 1978. i picked up the control boat & tower (7739) a few weeks ago but haven't opened it yet). in any case, thanks for taking the time to review this set and share it over eb.
great set and great parts pack as well! i guess i´m gonna buy this when it´s on sale, just for the orange parts. excellent for exo force
metalandi, on jul 19 2008, 01:28 am, said: i don't know really. in which country do you live? i haven't been to my local stores for a while now, so i don't know if they have it there, but maybe i'll find some time tomorrow to check it out. heh, i live in japan (probably the only one here who does), so i don't have s@h at all. if s@h us or canada had it (which they don't), i could probably get it forwarded.
i agree with both of you. first, i have to add, that a few of the stickers were a bit annoying as it comes to put them on espacially the ones on the helicopter, where you have to put them on round parts. but i didn't really see this at a bad point, i really can live with it. second, it was a very hard decision, believe it or not, on which new set to buy, cause i got a huge 2008 set-wantlist. i guess it'll take some time before i can get most of the other sets i want
great review metalandi! thanks for posting it with a number of pictures, the only question is why lego decided to produce so many sets i want to buy in one year!
paramedic unit, does not seem to suit well for this set's name. it should be named as clinic, outpatient treatment, family doctor and etc. from what i understand, parmedic unit, is a stand-alone unit, that is on standby, 24/7, ready for any emergency rescue in lego town. ambulance, with a group of paramedics will be ideal for this kind of situation. i love female doctors, especially with that lovely hairpiece! the cruiser, is a neat 4-studs wide design. just love these small car designs back then. i wonder what can be used at the back of its boot. the clinic is neat. maybe, we can send holodoc for some medical audit, to make sure that this clinic is up to standard. what surprised me the most, is the neat little eye chart. you don't see such details in any regular lego set. the red and white color combination for the building, works well for me. most of the hospital buildings and vehicles, always revolved in red and white. i gave this a "4" thanks you so much, brickster!
thebrickster, on jul 19 2008, 02:30 am, said: i just can't believe someone would rate this set a 1. it appears to be a trend among these classic reviews, never with a comment of why. maybe a tfol... it is our "destiny" to show them that lego existed before 1997 and was -imho- way better than today. we need more classic reviews. i hope i can continue with technic sets.
people giving this "1"? g... i'd give it a "4". i'd give it a "3" but added a point out of nostalgia... i think it's a nice town set from the old days. the only problem i always had is the lack of an ambulance... and we got a female doctor! :-)
brickster strikes again with another awesome review! ah, one of the few hospital related kits lego made. wasn't this the first hospital with modern minifigs? (because i seem to remember seeing an even older hospital online that had the armless, faceless figs). regardless, this would be great as a little doctor's office in someone's town layout - although the vehicle is a little silly. and that eye chart sticker has to be the coolest decal ever. quote maybe a tfol... well, it sure isn't me. i personally love older kits, even though i'm only a teen. i like a lot of the newer sets a bit more than some of the classic stuff, but i have always agreed that the 70's and 80's were an extremely high point in lego's time (even though i don't really own any kits from the period) edited by grevious, 19 july 2008 - 05:05 pm.
gave it a 4. it's not exactly town plan, but it's above average.
thank you for all these reviews, thebrickster! and: the idea with the polls is a very nice and interesting idea. (it will only take a while until i will have commented on all - so please give me some time. ) i gave this set a four: the vehicle, the minfigs and the design of the house are excellent - only the interior could be a bit spiced up (telephone, some other equipment). klaus-dieter
wow! old thread. just for the record, so long as it is here. paramedic's are advanced ambulance technicians. unlike standard emt's they are trained for advanced cardiac life support. they can push drugs, defibrillate, place a breathing tube etc. in the 1980's when the set was made, it was quite common for paramedics to respond to calls in "fly cars" or special response units. they would join up with ambulances at the scenes that required their skills. if you ever watched the old american tv show "emergency", johnny gage and squad 51 were one of these response units. they were mostly phased out in the 90's in favor of simply putting the paramedics and als gear in the ambulances.
hello all eurobricks members and town lovers, today, i will be doing up a review on hook & haul wrecker. this name is quite wierd to me. i will prefer to call it the regular tow truck. this is one of the service and repair vehicle that are always ready 24/7 on stand-by for any emergency towing in our towns. name: hook & haul wrecker theme: lego system / town year: 1989 pieces: 44 minifigs: 1 price: usd$6.00 an image of a 6660, hook & haul wrecker let the towing begins hook & haul wrecker is the typical 4-studs wide vehicle that takes care of broken vehicles that is left stranded on the roads. this tow truck is pretty useful. as you can see, current city sets hardly have any tow trucks available to tow new cars design. this tow truck is catered for 4-studs vehicles for classic town. can you imagine yourself this truck towing a speed racer car? i think it looks really out of proportion. in addition, the mini-fig which is included in this set has the regular truck print on its torso. i am very sure they must be a fan club for "trucks". otherwise, they should really need a change of clothes. nevertheless, in my honest opnion. i really love this torso very much. somehow, it makes them look tough even though their face looks very friendly. side view this vehicle has a combination of two primary colors which is white and red. this color combination looks very good. you cannot mistook it for an ambulance since they made use of this two colors too, in most emergency vehicles. this is my guess, i supposed the designer will have tow truck concept as a form of emergency and considered red and white as its combinations. this vehicle set-up has the typical sun-screen on the top of the vehicle frame. however, this baby has more unique features installed in it. these are the source of its brutal strength all-terrain vehicle??? this tow truck equipped with the best wheels. in fact, these wheels offer suspension on the roads. even when its travelling uphill, the truck will move accordingly with its tyres. when you act pressure on the top of the vehicle, it will either be shifted leftwards or rightwards. close-up of these unique tyres take a careful look. these wheels have springs installed in it. that is the magic of these vehicle and is defintely suited to run on any rough roads with least problems. if any eb members know which other vehicles has this unique features, please highlight it to me. because, if i remembered correctly. i only remember seeing this pair of tyres in this great set. he is ready for some serious towing. the driver had finished hook up the pizza van on its back. it's pretty simple. you just have to lift the back of the vehicle and placed it onto the hook. presto, the van is ready to go. this vehicle provides so much fun. you can really tow any 4-studs vehicle in your town. and, here we go! to the service station. poor pizza guy. summary review playability: 10/10 (superb fun. you will love to use this truck and tow any vehicles) design: 9.5/10 (excellent design. especially with the use of the suspension tyres) price: 9/10 (an inexpensive set based on the 1989 pricing. this set is made up of less than 100 pieces) overall: 9.5/10 (every town must need a tow truck. if a vehicle breaks down, whom will be ready to tow?) i gave it a "5" based on my review score card. what about yours? hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my brickshelf(when moderated)
thanks for all of your encouraging comments! i am glad most of you love to view our classic reviews. do stay out for more upcoming exciting classic town reviews! i appericiate greatly by all of your words. there are many outstanding reviews from brickster as well, especially those classic vintage lego sets, that i had never seen before, except browsing it in brickset. therefore, i will encourage eb members, to take some time off to view these truly wonderful classic reviews. trust me, it shall be an eye opening experience for each and everyone of you, whom had never seen classic town, in such an up close personal experience before. lasse d, on jul 19 2008, 12:22 am, said: this is one of my favorite town vehicles from the old time, and for one specific reason: the truck is on the guys shirt! it didn't matter that the color was wrong, or the hook was missing. i thought it was awesome beyond imagination... for some reason the torso is just lovely! i felt the 6641, 4 wheelin truck is almost identical with the torso, except for the front color combination. click onto the picture for an instant review. bernddasbrot, on jul 19 2008, 02:47 am, said: btw: the 6350 pizza to go van looks soooo cute! yes, that cute pizza van appeared for a reason.
indeed they have; they've appeared in 15 different sets, in total. they also have an identical width with the wide 2x2 wheels holder which is used on cars today. they are still excellent today, since retrofitting these suspension parts onto today's off-roader trucks won't give them weird proportions or any problems, and it looks perfect. plus they are useful if you're lazy and don't feel like constructing the pin-suspension used in the early 90's for truck-trailers, altough stability probably will suffer.
4/5. i've had this set since i was young. never understood why a tow truck needed to be an off-roader; maybe it was used to tow the other off-road vehicles. the suspension made the truck too tall to tow some cars, so i often took the hook out and use the truck as just an great off-road truck like 6672 (which also had the suspension wheels). other tow truck sets better filled their roles better, but that doesn't diminish this set at all. whitefang, on jul 18 2008, 09:19 am, said: i think it looks really out of proportion. no, for 25-odd years this vehicle was perfectly proportioned with all others in the town/city line. it's all these new 6 and 8 and 20 wide vehicles that are ignoring convention and making it look out of proportion. granted speed racer sets are more of their own line, but 6660 is smaller than most of the cars produced in the last few years.
superb review of a great set!this is one of my favourite classic sets becouse of all these functions(engine,suspension)and it's great design with less than 100 pieces used( only 52 )!congratulations for the review!i think that it's an outstanding set and surely worth 5 stars
i think we only got shell stations in europe in the 80s... never got this one, but it looks like a typical lego gas station ... once again, i just don't know how you were able to keep stickers and prints in such a great condition! i am sooooo jealous! the tires of the cars are a problem though... it was difficult and painful to put them off the wheel and back on later... the black hat... g... i would have looooooved to have that when i was a boy...
panda9001100, on jul 19 2008, 10:19 am, said: i love this set, it's nice and simple. maybe it's because i build this set by myself by ordering all parts and buildinginstruction. and i made one extra tanktransporter : excellent tankers panda. these make great additions to the station.
okay guys, i have built the set! so let's review! set name: 7649 mt-201 ultra drill walker price: $69.99 pieces: 759 bought from: tor r us in michigan, us. the box: first we have the front. it shows the set, it's functuns, and the limited edition sign. the box is huge, about the size of the dino attack chopper set or the mars mission base. nowadays, most set that are $50.00 or more have a flap displaying the sets functions. opening theflap on this box reveals a gigantic picture of the set. and the back. the bags, numbered: next, the manuals. they have piece call outs, page numbers, etc. there are 2 manuals with this set. sticker sheets: they actually aren't all that bad. random manual image: build: first, we open bag 1. this will build the alien craft and the minifigures. now here we have some interesting parts. a green spine from exo-force, and a black rim for the set container stacker. next we start the build on the alien craft. it is pretty sturbdy, but has no cockpit for the alien. the alien stickers are really cool. they are rainbow-ish, and has a silver back. next come the build on the wings: and the finished craft. it is pretty good, and has a nice sleek design. however, i think i will use the large ship for the commander out this year to fight the driller instead. next is bag 2, which builds the rover and astro ship. first is the ship. it starts off with doctor inferno's colors. it builds up very nice, and the detail is absolutley amazing. next the roof is built. it has some speed racer slopes. the hinge piee now has a hole through it. sorry for the blurry pic: more is added: then comes the bottom piece. the detail is very nice, and the hinge piece has a use later on. then you build the crates. each one holds two crystals. added to the ship, also a pic of the finished ship. here we start the rover. it sports anice detail- the orange studs get coveded by the grill to look more like an engine. the detail in this thing is pretty good. it has a gun and shovel. here is how it fits into the ship: it slides in... and is secured thanks to the hinge. okay, so next we open the number 3 bag, which builds the body. here are some interesting pieces: then we start the build. it begins nice and study: i just love these stickers with the bulldogs on them: more of the build, with the stickers added: next we add in the front part. the detail is again, outstanding. with the turntable added. it can move down as well. the next step is to build the water tank. it utilizes the bionicle boosters(big white things) and added to the walker: then we build that drill. it uses a lot of rims and such. with the gears added: the front part uses a lot of those new droideka 3-prong things. and bionicle eyes. the drill can spin thanks to the gears. and added to the vehical: next is the cockpit. it has a nice space for the astro's bckpack. added: the final stage is the legs. thank god they aren't like striking venoms. they are all the same, however. see those two rubber parts? those keep it in place when on surfaces like glass. next come the large part of the legs. these are similar to the assault tiger's legs. the final result is very sturdy, thanks too... notice the amazing classic space sticker? so we finally come down to this: the final result is amazing. it is sturdy, and has great detail. it is very realistic. and, when the ship is removed, the drill goes down, and the turret is aimed up... hope you all enjoyed the review!
thanks guys! the review wonb't be until tommorow, but to hold you guys in suspense...
best mars mission set ever deserves a great review. :d
excellent i can’t wait to see the review, this set looks very interesting.
this review should be put on the front page!
nice review! i don't mind the set, but, at the same time, i'm not particularly fond of it.
i don't like mars mission sets but this one is just spectacular! it is beautiful! i must have this set, even if it means selling my kidney! i only have one mars mission set, the etx alien mothership assault, which is okay. but this set blows my mind! two thumbs up!
nice review, good close-ups and a good, unconventional choice of a set. as for the set itself, it has it's pros and cons in my eyes. i like all the minifigs, but especially the witch. the fright knights are probably the closest you can get for an evil human castle faction. as for the building itself, on the other hand i like the fact that it can be modified, but some of the design choices are just stupid. the holes in the wall, the one huge tower (as opposed to several smaller ones), the huge empty space in the center, and the excessive usage of bright yellow. i guess for a smaller kid the play value is great, it's easily accessible and it looks sturdy enough, but to an afol, it's not much else than a source for bricks and figs, in my opinion. oh, and they did have telescopes in the medieval times (the witch most probably uses it for astrology). and even if they didn't, we're talking about a castle with a dragon and a wicked witch in it, so it's not exactly a good example of accurate history.
sweet review, metalandi! this set always looked a bit too busy for my liking, i guess i just didn't expect to see a set so tall. after seeing your review though, it is growing on me. i like all the play features, and at the very least it's a great parts pack. two things i'm confused about though. in this pic, is that dragon being used as a swing set? and i don't get why the area where the witch casts her spells on the second floor is green. green in castle means grass (or forestmen... ), and having grass on the second floor of a building is just weird. i understand that it's modular and thus it would make sense if it were placed on the ground, but dark grey would make just as much sense, and would look much better than the green there imo. anyway, i'm just fussy. thanks again for the cool review, will we be seeing any more? ~peace
i love the reviews of older sets that i never had. also, tiny thing, but you said it has 7 minifigs, but the group shots only include 6. the last guy isn't shown until the very end.
@iamded: yes it seems the dragon is used as such in the picture of the alternate model, but i guess bad and evil knights also wanna have some fun sometimes you are right with the green plate on the second floor, it does look a bit disturbing. but that can
very nice of a very nice set. the revolving fireplace - i wonder what movie that could possibly be from?
ah this brings back memories, i have this set and i loved the playabilaty factor opposing to older castle sets i have! in medieval times there actually were primitive telescopes, you can read about it here. thanks for this review, great storie, great pics!
wow, what a cool castle and set in general! i had no idea that this set existed (long dark ages) thanks to you metalandi for such a great review! the figures look really nice and the set is full of lots of little trinkets , details, traps etc! i have already had a look on ebay for this set. looks like a great set for parts too. i give the review 4.5/5 evil witches. cheers isc
metalandi, on aug 6 2008, 01:40 pm, said: well, that the bricks look new comes from that they are new. i got this set new and unopened i know, pretty good deal!
good review - the photo from above shows off the scale of the castle much better than the box photo. i was one of those who always thought this set looked lame, ever since first seeing it in the catalogue. a couple of my siblings had smaller bat lord/fright knight sets and enjoyed the accessories and style of the minifigs etc. so last year having not only ended my dark ages, but done so for some of the rest of my family, i got this set off ebay for my sister for christmas. i of course had to build it to make sure all parts were there before leaving ebay feedback and ending the transaction. first impressions were of how much brick there was to the set, as well as really useful large structural elements. and to be honest, while perhaps a bit childish, there's no doubt the style of the minifigs is kinda cute and useful for customs. it was really enjoyable building this set, and the scale is impressive when built, empty spaces notwithstanding (but hey, lego has always had buildings with no back, etc. - just use your imagination and enjoy the access to playspace offered). the traps etc. are neat and more like the kind of "action features" modern sets come with (i for one am in favour of these, for kids they are fun and i think for builders they give ideas cause they are often done with minimal parts or impact on the set design). anyways, needless to say my sister loved the set. indeed she's currently rebuilding it for the second time. if i see it as cheap again, i will pick up one for myself. i got the first one at €30 incl postage i believe.
i got a couple of the small sets from this line when it came out. recently, i acquired several more from bricklink because i just really love the way they look. this theme really had good intentions, but the execution was flawed. i hope one day lego returns to a darker tone, but maybe next time it could be more castlevania inspired. that would really turn some heads! plus, vampires and gothic aesthetics are really popular now. it will probably have run its course by the time lego would be able to develop a theme around them, though.
great review again it's nice to see old sets reviewed. i love the control stickers there's a great level of detail this is really the second best fire station in my opinion.
lovely!! i can't stop making comparisons between this fire station and last year's, which is also very well detailed, with great features and awesome playability. the concept design of the second one it's very much like the one reviewed here. this is good as tlg is taking back those great values to make the new excellent sets we all are enjoying by now!
i must agree great fire station, i love the fact that in the classic sets you were given a base plate and some other great idea's. i do miss the addition of base plates and alternate building idea's. the only newer set i have seen with any alternate build photo's is the 7239 fire engine. i miss back when.......
i´m glad you are reviewing 4-digit sets now, brickster! thebrickster, on jul 20 2008, 07:14 pm, said: this set is one of my favorite fire stations that offers a great amount of playability. this pretty sums it up! the firestation was one of the few sets in my childhood i owned and was not classic space! i especially liked the roller doors, this was one of the first sets they came with. in the late 80´s i sold it to my nephew. darn, i really regret it. when i asked him a couple of years ago if he still owned it (and i could buy it back) he also had made cash out of it. i gave it a "4". there is always room for improvement, like the helipad mentioned. so it can´t be a "5" in my opinion. take off you rose coloured glasses.

fire copter 1 this is fc-1, over. i'm making my way to main street now. the smoke is coming from the legoland hotel, over. that's a roger. i'm going to shoot the 500 gallon now, over... fire in your tabletown? no problem. lego's set 6685 fire copter is sure to put it out - classic style. set #: 6685 year released: 1982 piece count: 99 minifigs: 1 list price: unknown here's a great fire-themed addition to your classic legoland display. starting with the instructions: the set includes one classic fireman with a nicely printed fireman torso: what a great little detailed helicopter. i love the use of the red and yellow colors: the front opens to allow your fireman to quickly climb in: in the back are two round yellow 2x2 bricks for the water supply and a hose connected on each side. unfortunately, i lost one of the hoses. and the entire set. isn't she a beauty? 6685 fire copter 1 is a great supplement to set 6382 fire station released one year earlier. after buying this great little set, i had fun puting out fires all over my tabletown. oops, i think i smell one now...
good, but i like the heli of set 6571 better: another "4" from me.
well its ok but its not great voted 3 seems the classic town hater has voted a 1 again!!!! will the madness ever stop!?!
i vote outstanding because it makes excellent use of the pieces that were available at the time. that cockpit makes excellent use of an inverted windshield.
i owned this set, and i loved it. great idea to have the reversed windshield.
thanks for the review. this set was outstanding for its time with all the features and detail. the extending basket is just wonderful. however, i honestly wouldn't consider it the best firetruck ever. i actually like the one from 2005 even better - becasue like most of the city vehicles, it adds the needed bulk big engines like fire trucks need. many of the older kits, while awesome, were honestly a little too skinny imo.

this should be front paged!! edited by yorkiejim, 21 july 2008 - 06:17 pm.
can i see a close-up from that bacta tank?
nice pictures, but three questions: 1. how many pages do the instruction books have? 2. what are the spare parts? or: does this laaty come with two clone-commander-equipment sets and four assaij ventress lightsaberhilts? 3. where did you get it? 4. how much did it cost?
just picked this set up, and just took a break from building to go to football practice. i have just finished building all of the legs, and so far it looks like it is going to be a great set. i would have like it if more clones were included, but whatever. i find it interesting how many clone accessories they give you. i don't like it only because i can't decide what i want to use. i find it interesting that at lease 2 people are missing pieces. i have had multiple times where i thought i was missing pieces, only to find that they were in the bag somewhere. other than the fact that there is a lack of minifigures, i love this set and can't wait to finish it later tonight. edited by swman, 04 august 2008 - 08:33 pm.

thank you that was what i guessed :) but i didn't see any detailed pictures of 10195, do we have the instructins or something now? is that how dropship lifts the walker ?

exactly kim, that's what i meant. i pondered and wondered that for a long time :) i decided to ask here when a friend wondered the same thing. i hope it fits with the new droship. it would be really cool. and it's also great that tlg knows what they'll be prodcuing a year later..

thank you oky wan, and apologies to the rest of you guys, i guess i was rushing a bit and didn't think this through, it was wrong of me to reserve a review, if someone does an in-depth review before me, someone please close this topic. otherwise, i guess i will do it. again, many apologies for opening this topic before i actually had a review, bad example from me, very sorry!

thanks for the review. i havent seen any other clone flashligh pics, so thanks for that one "starting tonight, people will die... i'm a man of my word." jifel
hey everyone, my wife took me to legoland for my birthday just last week. we had a fantastic time and it gave me the chance to pick up some of the new castle sets and battlepacks i was really impressed by the sets i bought and decided to do my first review... let battle commence! set name: tower raid set number: 7037 price gbp: £19.99 pieces: 364 the models here's a shot of the complete set: the set is made up of two models, the crown knight's tower and the orc's siege tower. let's start with the crown knight's tower: a knight readies himself for battle! my favourite model from the set, the wicked orc's siege tower: please note that for the purposes of display i mounted the orc's banner onto a small cone set on the top platform of the siege tower. this doesn't come with the set but saves any orcs having to hold onto it all he time! there are other areas it can be placed without using extra parts. features both models look great and have excellent features. the set as a whole has great playability and seems to have been concieved with a storyline: the crown knight's have a captured orc within the walls of their tower so the orc army has been sent out to recover him... or are they merely after the gold the knights keep horded away?! the orc's siege tower has a powerful ram - spring-loaded by the simple arrangement of an elastic band - so pulling it back sends it flying out the front, knocking down the wall on the side of the knight's tower... ...and releasing the captive orc! the floor panels inside the prison are laid over a lip on the inside of the collapsible wall, so fall in when they're not supported. there's a string at the rear for extending the boarding ramp... ...and letting a fearsome orc warrior charge across! flick-fire action! the battle heats up as the orcs close in! the minifigures the crown knights: i really like the crown knights. they're metallic helmets look great and they come with nice accessories. the archer has a double printed head with a frightened look on the other side too! i'm not surprised, i'd be frightened when staring over the ramparts at these... the orcs: these guys really do look the part, worthy advesaries to the crown knights! the details are superb: the printed elements, weapons and helmets, all set the orcs aside on the battlefield. the set comes with a great new molded armour neckpiece too. the mighty orc leader looks wicked in his full battlegear! overview there's so much to this set it's hard not to be impressed. the orc's siege engine is a thing of beauty (or terror!) and would look great on any battlefield. the crown knight's tower although basic, looks good and has great playability. i'm a big fan of the new castle knights and fantasy minifigures and the inclusion of five of them is just enough for this set and as a booster to any army. at £19.99 in the uk this set is well worth the money for content and quality. i'd highly recommmend this set as a must-have purchase for anyone a final shot of the siege tower with a host of orcs ready for battle: i hope you enjoyed my review, i'll be posting my next one for 7040 dwarves mine defender soon!
i got this set in the spring during my "buy every new castle set available"-season. granted, i couldn't afford all of them, but i do have most of them now. anyway, i love the action elements to this set, and the siege tower really does look wicked. i'd like to attach the crownie tower to the king's castle to see how it fits, but i unfortunately don't own that set (yet). i also love the turning head of the soldier, and i've used it in my princess quest-comic as well, along with the turning head of the princess. the troll leader brings good variety to the army of trolls, but they still could use another face type and more torso options. it's a nice review, in any case, although the set pretty much speaks for itself.
hey, good review and good photos. i also got this set just recently, and i wasn't very enthusiastic about it at the beginning, but after i built it i could appreciate it. the siege engine is very nice, but my complaint has do with the proportions of the knight's tower in respect to the trolls' machine - it's a bit smaller, and less bulkier. that complaint has to go with some other sets too. for example the troll warship is really humongous - it feels like it can load the evil wizard's tower and sail off. other than that - a good set, i like it, 4/5 from me.
excellent review and your pictures are very good, i look forward to seeing more review. i really like this set i got it some time ago and keep meaning to post some pictures of it going up against some of the older castles.
very nice review pedro! you beat me to it. there was a review done about january, but i wanted to have a go, just haven't opened the box yet..... great pics and well demonstrated action elements too. i rate this as one of the coolest castle sets just for its playability and 5 figures. this will def add to my orc army, and i may purchase more of this set if they dont release a orc bp. keep up the good work!
thanks for the positive comments everyone i’d noticed that although much discussed, no-one on eurobricks had written a comprehensive review for it. i thought this set more than deserved one! i’ve just posted my newest review of the dwarves' mine defender here: http://www.eurobrick...showtopic=19931

great review! this is an awesome set. besides knocking down the wall at the side, can the battering ram do any other damage to the tower (ex, reducing it to rubble bricks)? and why can't the orc just jump out of the hole in the back? do they need to do that much unnecessary damage to the tower?
thanks for the review! from this set, i prefer the crown knight's tower - it's a very good-looking structure!
i have one of these and must say that this is the best castle set in the theme, and the most useful parts pack for its size yet.
fleshies sometimes come in handy. great review and good set, but as said by other: another russian soldier (or two) would be fine, tlc is being a bit too much of a cheapskate regarding minifigs lately.
i was tempted to go buy this setbecause i havn't got a indiana jones . but when i went to get it and there was none .i still havn't got a indiana jones
time for my first review! 7673 magnaguard starfighter peices: 431 # of figs: 2 price: 44.99 usd the box: pretty decent size box for the price. magnaguards: the normal box stuff: front of the ship: back: open cockpit: back of the box: contents: dss (dreaded sticker sheet): first manual page (because it's super important not to build on carpet. ) fig build: the magna guard head: (imo it's beautiful! ) the purple cone! cape box: the capes!: just one: the magnaguard: back: the parts (nicely sorted!) the new windshield piece (beautiful!) the first step: seccond step: more steps of the main body: the wing assembly: (sorry for the blur) attached: opposite wing: both attached: rear engine build: the staffs. i have mine set up differently than in the instructions. i put one cone over the hump on one end of the staff, and the other in the original spot. then, to load them onto the fighter, all you do is push the original placed cone down and put it right in. this way, the staff looks better and it works the same! see? it slides right in: skeletal parts of sides attached: close up: bottom: both wings attached: hidden missle launcher: raised up: another shot: staffs attached: complete: side panel: side pods: complete: swooshable!: finished!: time to complete: >2hrs. okay, overall rating time! price: 9/10- could have been 40.00 usd, but due to new molds, this is understandable. parts: 9/10- could have hade more dark red, but thats imo. plus, i love dark red! build time: 8/10- i took my time on this and enjoyed the techniques the designers intricated. also, taking pics added to the time quite a bit. playability: 7/10- the main playability functions are the missle launchers in the back and the sliding cockpit. my only gripe with these is they don't set right with the other slopes on the top. also, the inside of the cockpit is easily modded for regular size minifigs. just pop a handlebar piece in the already provided arm in the cockpit and bam, your favorite figs can have a ride! it also helps keep the magnaguards in place if they hold it. minifigs: 10/10- imo, the new molds are great! the only downfall is the right arm on both is less moveable due to the hard plastic turban-thing connected to the head. swooshability: 9/10- the starfighter is pretty sleek, and very swooshable! design: 9/10- the most important aspect, and this one's a winner! it's only a nine because it needs to have smoother edges in a few spots, but they are easily modable. overall score: 8.7! i think it's an awesome set. very satisfying! 2008 sw on! dsr dsr edited by kimt, 04 august 2008 - 11:49 am. indexed

shoc, on jul 29 2008, 04:20 am, said: hello again! wow, this really is an in depth review! at first when i pictures of the set i thought... "yeah, kinda boring." but after reading your review, i think i might buy it (when it's cheaper). the pieces look very good, and i love the droids and their accesories! thanks for the review! also, awesomestar, i knwo it is a default thingy but it would be good if the quote was taken out of your post as it does clutter up the topic (or "yopic" as dsr calls it). your welcome! glad to help! also, "yopic" has been fixed, thanks for pointing it out! dsr

jifel, on jul 29 2008, 06:15 pm, said: nice review! i probably wont get it, since i dont like ships much, but maybe ill order a magn guard from somewhere. i don't really like any of the starships either (harder to battle) so the closest i get are the 2 gunships! this review is certainly 'in-depth' but unfortunately £39.99 =
, that was a weird race! anyway, i love the look of both sets, but i'll have to go for the dino attack quad for a couple of reasons: it is post-apoc, which i love, features tan and dark red colours which are far more useful than yellow, you get more "bang for your buck" with the dino set, you get a little dino (sure you can hate it but better than not having one right?), and the fig has much more useful pieces and a better face. thanks for the face off thebrickster! batbrick away!
it's definately the street sprinter for me! there are many reasons for that, most of which have been mentioned by others already: i hate yellow, it's the most useless color, but i love tan and dark red. it's bigger and more detailed than the coast guard one. plus, i think there is a hinge in the back of it, so there is apparently some more playability to it as well. i love the post-apoc style fig! it's detailed and simply looks cool! also, while the digger fig has quite an individual look to it, the coast guard driver has the generic hero head and coast guard uniform. it's an overal better deal, especially if you count the ludp which gives the set a whole lot more playability, no matter how u the ldp may be. tan & post-apoc figs on!
dino attack for me! you just cant say no to a huge bazooka! though the tan and dark red works for me too
the rancor, on aug 2 2008, 09:39 am, said: i wish i had that but i'll have to make do with the much less violent european version (dino '2010' not 'attack') here's a comaprison... european version: usa etc. version: there's a subtle difference, but i prefer the us one i did not know that europe had a different quad (or at least one without the bazooka). interesting that the gun was removed from the european sets, or added to the us sets. i sort of like the chain. i also notice a big difference in the boxart. destroyed city to prehistoric volcano. i wonder if the story was different as well? thanks for sharing a good picture. ----------------------------------------- well, it does look like the dino quad has the upper hand; almost double the votes.
price: 569 kr minifigs: 2 pieces: 592 stickers: 9 (my sticker sheet wasn’t curled up) overview: before i start i will apologize for the bad quality of the pictures. it is getting dark here right now, so some of the pictures are a bit dark. 1) minifigs: the set comes with two of the new clone wars clone troopers, which in my opinion are pretty cool. it also comes with two short blasters and a bag of clone accessories. figs with helmets: figs without helmets: 2) the tank: this thing is huge (25cm long and 22cm wide), and far oversized in my opinion, but looks great nonetheless. i very much like the white and dark red color scheme, mixed with a bit of lime green (even though there is no lime green bricks ;) ). left side: right side: back side: both of the wings contain a hidden compartment to store the blasters and a part that rotates to reveal three flickfire missiles. the front opens up as well to reveal the engine. the side guns and the gun on the top rotate. inside the cockpit is space for two figs; one seated in front of two computer screens and one placed in a moveable seat, which moves up and down, allowing the fig to pop up the top hatch and staying hidden while the hatch is closed. this function is triggered by opening the backdoor. hidden compartment and missiles: engine: top hatch (open/closed): interior: 3) rating: build: 9/10 not much to say here. minifigs: 7/10 an extra fig or two would have been great; eventually a jedi or a commando. design: 8/10 this only looses a couple of points for being oversized, but it’s a great looking model. parts: 10/10 at 592 parts, this is one of the cw sets with the best parts/price ratio. price: 8/10 sure this thing is great, but i think its overpriced at 569 kr. (approx. $120). when build it feels more like a 450 kr. set. final verdict: 9/10 despite some flaws this thing is definitely recommended, and it looks great on your shelf, too ;)
i know it would really go well with the rgs but it is not enough for £50. ill wait for the sales at christmas.
finally a review of this, thanks! 120 bucks? this tank looks tiny and though it's amazingly detailed it should have been smaller and only 40/50 bucks at most. it just doesn't play that big a part man. good pieces and mechanisms but no one's going to both buying a 120 buck tank, no offence, not unless it it's the at-te.

deinonychus, on aug 1 2008, 08:06 pm, said: one question... do the top panels on the rotating rocket assembly mounted in the skids pop off regularly when you flip them back and forth? the ones on the version i built from the instructions posted online seem to eject with the slightest provocation they do fall off from time to time, but not as easily as you describe. skipper 24, on aug 1 2008, 08:13 pm, said: i'll probably get this in hong kong where lego is cheap next time i go there to visit my relatives. also pretty nice review, a few more pics couldn't hurt. also are there just two of the same white control computers for the controls? that's what it looks like in the instructions. yes. its two identical white slopes decorated with computer screens.
this is my favorite set in the clone wars wave, and i'll be picking it up without a doubt... that is, whenever the folks at lego decide that it's okay for us to buy their sets in us.
great review! i really like the look of this set, and having played a lot of battlefront i am quite keen to pick one up in australia when it comes out (after the ds is paid off) looks like some nice greebling and cool colour scheme too.
must buy now!!!! totally sweet! not available in canada yet well designed and cheap (for clone wars!) i'm going to mod it so that it looks like the imperial version
i am 100% going to get this set! it should be about $55 and if it is, i'll get it without a doubt! i just hope that this set is $50-$60. if it isn't, then we have a problem...
thanks for posting the review, i’ve been wondering about this set. to me it does feel a bit fig light, for £50 i’d expect maybe one or two more clones. i’m not to sure about the oversized issue, it seems to me it’s better to have something a bit to large and have a better level or features than something smaller will less.
thanks for the review. i love these affordable little sets. not so affordable now because of the cool figs but i'm going to have a look on ebay and bricklink right now just in case! an army of tan red droids would look great. maybe we'll see some if geonosia appears in the new seires somehow unlikely since the confederacy was defeated at the battle of geonosis. i wish i could have bought this set when it came out but i'd just left university so i was super skint and had to miss all the ep.ii sets now they all cost loads even in used condition. at least now there has been a re-design of the gunship and at-te from the clone wars series that i can buy.
great review! man doi wish i had those red droids. i'm using the dell xps-1, and holy crap is it clear. those pics were beautiful!
~vbbn~ the pics were 12 mega pixles which is quite a lot i think, although i had to scale them down to 800x600. i used to dream that tlg would bring out these sets of the geonosis arena and you could join them together to make a massive arena but i doubt they would ever do that. also look out for my forth coming reviews of 4500 snow speeder, some tie fighter with a lul dv, and gg wheel bike chase. i have taken all the pics all i need to do is upload them. also i would review the jango fett's slave 1 but i have customized it so much i don't really want to revert it back to it's original state. edited by skipper 24, 02 august 2008 - 07:18 pm.
thanks for the review skipper. this is one of my favourite sets. i really like the colour scheme and the geonosians are awesome. keep up the good work kimt
good review! i really liked the detailed geonosians, and i hope theyre in a later set so i can get more. knowing lego they'll release a huge arena playset with a few geos and sand red droids so people will buy the set just for them. jifel
i am fairly confident that something involoving geonosis will be released in 2010 but any way i had this set ( one of my first ones) but i droped the ship and it blew up. i found all the pieces but in never rebuilt the ship. although i still have the figs ant the canon. overall this set was above average in my opinion. great review!!!
thanks for the review. i actually like the older tie better, since it had a stand for the tie. not really a fan of the lu figs either. no matter - a tie is a tie and this is a must have fighter for any lego sw fan out there. never can get enough ties, except the tie advanced or vader's tie...they don't rock... kimt
great review! really shows off the main aspects of the set. wish i had picked up a tie when they were around... dsr
and now for something completely different: tiny turbos belonging to the racers line! when i saw 8147 bullet run on s@h for half the price i couldn´t resist buying it. we had a lot of fun celebrating a bag-build at our event using the 8150 zx turbo of that theme so i knew what would expect me with this "extended" set. price: normal 49,99€ now 24,99€ (well i paid 34,99€ in a lego store but that´s another story...) bricks: 796 minifigs: - hey, this is tiny turbos, stupid! stickers: don´t ask (or read further) the open box reveals seven polybags, some with more smaller polybags inside, the instruction booklet, 2 ramps and the sticker sheet. of course i put all of the bags on the table and not on the floor hey, tlc didn´t print this on the first page of the building instructions! and you won´t see any piece callouts as well. on the other hand this is not adifficult build, so why show them? still there is an inventory list of all bricks at the end of the instructions. note the giant sticker sheet! we all now the dss, but that is a new kind of extra super large sticker sheet. it holds 82 stickers! more to that later on. the build is quite basic. the only non-conventional parts of the build were the two slammers. and the most annoying part was fiddling the rubber band of the holder without destroying it. bag 1: easy beginning: building the lime car, the limo and the two slammers. nothing exciting about the lime car, but the limo was neat. it´s an 18 studs long car! the normal racers are abot 10 studs long. nice way to put the horns on the back! the slammers. mmmmh. nice invention if they would actually do something. they are supposed to give the tubros a kick in the butt to speed them up, but the result is a 80 cm long "run" and that´s it. i had expected more acceleration from the slammers. but it´s also fun to play with the cars without slamming them. bag 2: convoy time: the tow truck and the fuel truck the tow truck is a great idea and a good addition to the set. the cars are supposed to crash - how do they get back home? well, here´s the answer. quite american layout of the truck and it´s very well done: horns, 5 flashing lights and a right color choice. you can move the arm up and down and pull out the hook. note the metallic silver antennae. the fuel tank has got a "secret" function. it may break on the middle of the trailer. therefore it has a hinge build in the bottom. city fire mayhem! and there´s no fire engine... bag 3: long, longer, how long can a "tiny" truck be? the pipe truck, an unexpected buggy and the red racer. 36+ studs long: the pipe truck breaks every convention. the cabin is almost the same like the tow truck and the fuel truck and that is the good part of it. the trailer has to carry pipes and is functional as well as it can commute sidewarts. it looks quite unrealistic as well and you cannot drive this beast on tiny roads. good for another crash. but there are more cars in this bag. now this was a surprise: a buggy? this is the only 6(+)-wide car, but just because the wheels are large. monster truck madness? i don´t care for those cars. personally a disappointment, i would have preferred another racer. + for variety though. did i say another racer? here we are: the red devil. great looking, a real fast shape and red. the best racer in this set. vrooommm! this is the most "played with" car of the set. (not only from me ). as you may have noticed i didn´t put any stickers so far. i don´t like stickers especially when placed over two or more bricks! and here you are supposed to do it several times. of course the cars look better with stickers on, but they are also great without stickers. only the fuel truck looks boring without. my sons didn´t know there were supposed to be stickers and they didn´t ask for them. so everything is allright! here´s a closeup of the sticker sheet (did i already mention it was 82 stickers? ): the only exception i made using sticker was for bag 4: bag 4: you go here? you pay! the highway toll booth. the only immobile part of the set, but great to brake though the barriers. that is fun! i only put on stickers on 2x2 plates where i had the idea to use those plates further on on different other mocs. this looks a bit boring without the other stickers i admit. but still no cut off to the playability! there are also two ramps belonging to the set. these only make sense if you are able to speed up the racers with the slammers and hit the ramps correctly. i had problems with that, so they are on the shelves now... could be a lot fun making a contest though. like this (picture of the inventories frontpage) all cars put together: the usual leftovers: all in all this is a great set to call ones own! i did not regret buying it, especially when it was 50% off! even normal price would not have been too much. build: great for smaller children, boring to afols: 5/10 special bricks/colors: none, all basics: 3/10 design: i love the tiny turbos´ size and design: 9/10 playability: -1 because of the slammers, another -1 because no minifig-scale. but that is not the intention of the set: still 9/10 price/piece ratio: dang! it´s not on sale any more. but if you hurry you could still grab one in the lego stores. 10/10 all in all: 8.5/10 and a clear recommendation! it was and still is a set to play with your children. the size fits perfectly to matchbox cars and that was exactly what my younger son did: can you find all of the cars included in the set? p.s.: after buying this set i won an ebay auction with another tiny turbos set - 8135 bridge chase. this is even more fun! i will soon care for a review with some never seen photo-tricks as well. stay tuned! edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 07:02 pm. indexed
tiny turbos are good for parts, but i'm not so keen on them as they have no minifig drivers. so, i wasn't sure about this set. but your review has made me like them more, i probably won't buy the set but i appreciate it more. thanks for the review!
as my summer holiday was kinda wet for 2 weeks, i decided to shop some sets. i crossed the german border and bought me this one mainly for the parts. to get time going, i built the models and made this small review for you to enjoy (or hate) high resolution pics can be found here when public. set# 4994 title: fierce creatures price: 9.99 euro / 12.99 usd pieces: 193 minifigs: 0 the box: the box looks awesome! it has some great animations of the 3 models in the instruction. the rear of the box shows some nice up-close-and-personal drawings of each model. i think it works better having the models drawn instead of a mere photo of them. somehow it allows the great colour-scheme to really show. the instructions: the instruction is easy to follow and shows which pieces are used in each building step. that makes it all a lot easier, especially with so many small pieces as in this set. the bricks are divided into 3 polybags and the instruction is a fine small book, which can be easily stored along the rest of your ever-growing amount of booklets and pamphlets printed by tlg. the models: model 1 is a spider and it’s nasty. the 2x2 modified brick with the hole would allow one to hang it from a string. this beast is sure to give you several nightmares, were it hanging from a string in your bedroom. – so i wouldn’t do that (plus the fact that my wife threw away the box and ordered me to take the spider apart when she saw it – she’s an arachnophobian and does not take spiders lightly). it looks real, in a brickish-non-real-way. model 2 is a snake. there’s not much to say other than the head is awesomely designed and the rest is bad. the body is poorly designed and does not live up to the coolness of the head. build the head, ignore the rest. model 3 is a flying scorpion or something. not as realistic as the spider, but still a great model with a cool head. the tail is a bit poorly designed, but it’ll do and it does offer some good ideas on how to use bricks. all in all verdicts: this is an ok creator set. it holds a lot of fine pieces and the models are an ok inspiration. given its size, it’s an ok set. but it’s nothing more than that. i’ll give it an average score. i enjoyed building the models and fumbling with the bricks in the shade during a “siesta” on my vacation. and that’s what it is, an enjoyable build and a little inspiration on a hot day with a erdinger dunkel weissbier in my other hand. kimt edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 06:29 pm. indexed
there isn't much difference apart form it has stickers on and is grey. also the guns and tow cable gun are different as well as the engines. but if you look at pictures of the hoth base speeder not to much is noticeable.
skipper 24, on aug 4 2008, 12:52 pm, said: podracer not sure where you got that from (i didn't have them out)? i noticed the minifig between the grievous starfighter & the mod-dino2010 vehicle and it looked like a little person sitting in the pod of his podracer. guess my eyes are playing tricks on me -- my eyesight is shot & my wife keeps pushing me to go visit the optometrist.
i find myself so stupid i didn't bought this set. it was 30 euro and i thought that it would be for sale after a half year. (it was with earlier sw sets also). nice review.
thanks for the rewiev! a nice set indeed, to bad i din´t buy it when it still was in the stores.
this is one of my favorite sw sets. it is a good size to the hoth base and the at_at.
my brother had this set, and i think it isn't the best set, but great minifigs. could use a star corps clone or 2 from the bp.
stash2sixx, on aug 3 2008, 05:19 pm, said: i have all three of the slave i ships, and i agree with kimt...although it is a very small, compact ship, the first slave i (boba fett) is still the sturdiest. the newest slave i (boba fett) is not bad, and is of much better construction than this slave i from jango fett. even though i like the size and scale of the jango slave i and the newest boba fett slave i...when you pick that very first one up, it had the feeling of....."you can throw me against the wall, drop me off the roof of your house, or let 4 two year olds play with me...i'm not gonna break!" at least thats's my opinion. good review that's the exact explaination i was looking for. the old one feels...well...it's just special. kimt
thanks for the review. it looks like an interesting set, even if not as good as boba's. skipper 24, on aug 3 2008, 08:11 pm, said: i never got the original boba fett's slave 1. i wish they would make one to scale with the minifigures. i would be so cool. you mean it would be so cool? i agree that it would be, if they made a large minifig scale version like with the ucs millenium falcon. i would probably try to buy that. edited by shoc, 03 august 2008 - 08:31 pm.
very good review! there's only one thing you did wrong: [quote name='skipper 24' post='337180' date='aug 3 2008, 08:46 am']the controls. i got this set for a very low price as well, and for that, it's a very nice parts pack with 2 neat, exclusive figs!
nice review! i will say i like the latest slave i the best as it is longer than jango's. i haven't seen the first one so i cant really comment.
i got the original jsf for christmas, which i might buy and review. wonderful set, the obi in this one is really awesome and it's really just a great ship, sticker free. probably my favourite, i'd fly it if any ship from star wars. maybe i should get it and the slave i from episode ii... after all, i like jango despite having a crap story.
you added some decals to the jango figure, right ? they seem to be suffering a little. i remember buying this set from the discount tent after my first visit to legoland windsor. i wasn't sure whether to buy it, even in their sale ... but i was glad i did once i'd built it :)
this set looks liek a good buy for $4. wish it was still around, but like you said, it needs accessories.
7261 clone turbo tank parts: 801 figs: 8 price: £70.00 (ouch! ) edit: new box pics added. my version of the set comes with a normal mace windu figure and an extra clone trooper. also the mace windu, barc trooper and jet trooper minifigs were exclusive to the set (well you could make the jet trooper yourself) . also my set came with 4 extra blasters (you'll see them later) and baby blue vent things instead of trans blue. 1.manual & box the front of the box. the box compared to the motorized at-at and the hailfire droid and dwarf spider droid. minifgs. the back which has pics of the sets functions and alternate models. inside the box it has a white cardboard divider probably for strength seeming as the box it so flimsy. pretty hefty manual. the tt manual compared to the one of the at-at ones. random shot. another random shot. poster at the back of the manual 2. general set and minifigs the whole set. i accidentally left one of the plates up when i took the pic. close up of the figs. two battle droids come with blasters and a mini turret. the republic. from l-r: jet trooper, mace windu (not lul), barc trooper, normal clone, the commander, look out. jet pack. mace's torso. barc trooper legs. barc trooper torso. he has got to be my favorite clone trooper by tlc. the mysterious commander. on lsw he was called cody (right) but he has star corps armour making him commander bly (left) . normal clone and the look out clone with electro binoculars. 3. speeder bike side view of the barc speeder. menacingish front view. (is menasingish a word?) printed back engine piece. one of my shield things came with a crumpled handle it is worse than it looks in the pic. 4. the turret the turret. it can rotate and point upwards. but what if you want to blast all those battle droids that are shorter than the height of the turret blasters... add another hinge in! that extra hinge in action. 5. the tank it's to big to get a decent side view pic johnny the cabin boy on the crows nest. front 2 seater cockpit. the 2 seats. better be careful you don't fall off your seat there are some pretty big gaps down the sides. back cockpit with dual missile launchers. the back seat. the engine. the large central storage. the turret controls fold down to lock into place so it doesn't fall out when driving. you can put 2 minifigs up top. mace and a clone driving. you can see those 4 extra blasters, 2 orange at the front of the pic and 2 between the chairs. the turret and jet trooper. barc trooper on the barc speeder. the commander on the lift chair in the back cockpit. another shot of that chair. 6. overall build: 8/10 quite enjoyable because it incorporates technic and system parts. minifigs: 9/10 on a set this size it has quite a lot including some exclusives such as the barc trooper but it could of had a droid or 2 more. design: 7/10 way out of scale but generally pretty strong due to the technic frame. parts: 7/10 lots of plates and nice minifig parts. price: 6/10 justifiable because of the amount of figs in the set. playability: 7/10 includes some cis units to fight the clones. overall:8/10 needs more droids and it could be bigger. i will also probably have a break form reviewing for now seeming as i have just put out a whole load of reviews. edited by kimt, 09 august 2008 - 08:51 pm. indexed as 7261 review 2
did your version without the lul mace have trans blue grill things (like the ones on the back of the speeder) ? or was my set a one off.
hanks for the price. i got the set a while ago and couldn't remember correctly i have now changed it.
skipper 24, on aug 4 2008, 04:04 pm, said: did your version without the lul mace have trans blue grill things (like the ones on the back of the speeder) ? or was my set a one off. i bought mine online, thinking it was the new version but i ended up with that very lame lul fig. i just hate that fig... it's completely useless, we can't use any part of it for anything (although, i only discovered yesterday that the lightsaber blade was a standard one and not glued, as i always believed, so all isn't completely lost) in the end i still was rather disappointed by the set. it's too full of holes ( hum; i think there's kind of a paradox in that sentence...)... but the barc speeder and green clone are indeed fantastic. oh, and yes, mine came with sand blue grill parts instead of the trans-yellow ones... didn't realise it at first, and i spent half an hour cursing, thinking they forgot to put them in the box. but in the end, i don't know if the replacements are any better , since they're supposed to represent some kind of thruster light or something... all in all, i think it's my worst set... not necessarily for the set itself which is ok, but psychologically, there's too many things that went wrong with it...
i wonder why this set had no blue or black astronauts? whatever the case, i always loved the small minifig sets that lego released, as i could never get enough astronauts. my favorite was the set of futuron astronauts. why would the yellow astronauts freak you out, sinner? is it because they look nekkid? ;-)
kdog, on aug 5 2008, 04:45 am, said: why would the yellow astronauts freak you out, sinner? is it because they look nekkid? ;-) you bet! but this set is still the most freaky...
he does have a cape, a cap and a bandana around his head. that's not the same as being bare as when born. edit: oh yeah, he's also got red gloves on as well btw what does this have to do with the 6701 space minifigures review?
i voted below average since i'm not a very big fan of classic space.
7674 v-19 torrent number of pieces: 471 number of minifigs: 1 price: £49.99 the v-19 torrent starfighter was an assault fighter with exceptional speed and maneuverability used by the galactic republic during the clone wars.it was a predecessor of the alpha-3 nimbus-class v-wing starfighter, in terms of purpose and usage. it first appeared in the genndy tartakovsky?€™s clone wars 2d series. basics box front: the box art shows the torrent flying above tatooine, with the new blue and white ?€œclone wars?€? style packaging, box back: the back shows some of the features of the set including the lifting mechanism and adverts for 7679 republic gunship, 7675 at-te and the 7673 magnaguard starfighter inside the box, there are 2 instruction books, a very small dss and 9 bags that are not numbered. bags: instruction books random manual shot parts list book one is mainly the construction of the body and one of the engines, book 2 is the other engine and the wings. for better pics of the manual look on lego's website. sticker sheet: a very small sticker sheet is included, which includes 2 republic insignias and a nose sticker. minifigure one minifigure is included, a clone pilot. the whole "omg only one minifigure in this set" and "its not movie accurate, i hate you tlc!!!11one2" has been beaten to death, so please don't make this review turn into that and to be honest i don't care because its an awesome figure. tlc have made the effort to print the life support device onto the chest plate so props to them. he has the "clone head" like the rest of the clones have in the cw releases, there are no extra clone bits apart from a long blaster, that's not included here. interesting/other pieces printed piece! rare/unusual pieces: there are 2 pistons included, as well as 2 weird looking technic pieces that serve as the landing gear during the build. which might explain why the set is quite expensive, it musn't have been cheap to manufacture them. the build it starts off relatively simple, the first 16 steps is getting the basic shape of the cockpit and the mechanism to make the middle wing move up and down. after that the next few steps are getting the landing gear/wing folding device done, it's actually the same thing so when the wings move into attack mode the landing gear retracts. this is then locked into place by the white beams that form the basic shape of the fuselage. up to step 46 is the fuselage, as well as fitting the hydraulics. this is what it looks like when the fuselage is complete. the cockpit is not "air tight", there's is quite a big gap top: bottom: the final few steps of book 1 is the construction of one of the engines, here it is attatched : the yellow bar is not permanent, its used to keep the white bit at the top from moving downwards. the steps are repeated in the second book so that both engines are now in on to the wings! first one attatched, the middle one is attached now: and finally the last one: it is now finished! the pieces that are left: so, you're probably wondering, how does it enter attack mode? well can you see this bar? push that bar to the center, and pick it up, the hydraulics move the central wing downwards as well as the side wings to enter attack mode: the outer wings have flickfire missiles on them, they obviously don't work, but it increases the playability of the set. the cockpit opens in a similar way to general grevious's starfighter released last year, using a sliding mechanism for other pics see here : http://s25.photobuck...eview/?start=20 and i'll be taking other requests for pics, maybe a video of it switching between modes. build: 7/10 very symmetrical build, the mechanism to move the wings might annoy some people. minifigs: 5/10 1 fig in a £50 set, however it is a starfighter design: 9/10 very accurate to the source material, lego have really made the effort to make the movement feature work. parts: 8/10 lots of technic, white and dark red pieces price: 7/10 could be slightly cheaper, playability: 6.5/10 need to buy some enemy sets to get the most of it, flick fires don't work. comments, requests, questions and criticisms welcome. edited by kimt, 04 august 2008 - 06:48 pm. indexed and poll added
first, thanks simonjedi for a great review. i'm interested in what you think of the hydrolics. i could spend hours just deploying and undeploying the wings and landing gear. i'm a little worried, the very first batch of the hydrolic piece for, umm, i think it was the off-road 4x4 technic set, was very fragile and broke after a few uses. these seem to be holding up but i'm anxious to see if they hold up after 100-200 uses. quote name='walter kovacs' date='aug 4 2008, 11:47 am' post='337841'] those black pieces used on the landing gear look very bionicle-like. if they haven't been used before, i'd suspect they will be. not that i'm a bionicle expert or anything. [/quote] right you are. they are bionicle bohrok head pieces. so pretty old in bionicle terms and fairly useless in my opinion but they do make interesting looking landing gear as i deploy and redeploy the wings and landing gear. hopefully, we'll get a pilot in the battle pack to help mitigate the fact we only get one here. -tohst
nice review simon jedi. the v-19 has been one of my favourite ships since the release of cwa and this is one of the sets i've been considering most about buying. it's great to see tlg's treatment of it. it looks like no expense was spared making it as aesthetically and functionally accurate as possible - though i think the cockpit windshield could maybe have been slightly bigger, but that's just me i'm sure. it looks pretty big compared to other starfighters too. did it take a long time to build?
thanks for this excellent review simonjedi . this looks like an awesome set and this is the set i am most looking foward just as well as the separatist spider droid (7681) .
the ability for it to fold in and out of attack position has wowed me. this is my top priority now. thanks for making up my mind.
rayman, on oct 4 2008, 11:11 pm, said: hydraulic wings! i am very impressed and am now considering getting this set purely because of this funciton. i am just curious as to know why are there sand green parts on the bottom of the v-19. is it visible when the model is completed? i am also pleased to see tlc giving us a printed cockpit computer this time around. while i do like the functions and they way it is built, i cannot get into this model. first the price is a bit steep. i know all the cw sets are expensive but this one just seems more so to me. i mean there is only 1 fig in here. second to me, there is no playability or display-ability. i gave below average.
in addition to my last comment am i correct in saying that the left over yellow technic part was merely to hold parts together while building? edited by skipper 24, 10 october 2008 - 09:10 pm.
daxflame680, on nov 30 2008, 01:03 am, said: i built mine today. as soon as i tried to put it in attack position, the thingy rotates the wrong way and it falls apart. what a waste of $55 i suggest you to check again if you put the technic gear in the correct way cause if not than maybe that the problem . also, i don?t think it is a waste in my opinion, the ship is very well designed and is actually pretty strong (or at least mine ) and the pilot minifig is fantastic even if there is just one of them. edited by darkrebellion, 30 november 2008 - 03:17 am.
oh ruben you lucky so and so this set is one of the most beautful i have ever seen! splendid looking build and 11 figures, all the same faces like but still you get that old woman pig-tail head piece which is just great! i thought you meant the monorail set when you told me about this but guess i was wrong (don't laugh i've been away from lego for quite some time) and for 80 euros it was a real bargain from a great friend! really nice review hope this sets brings you years of joy!
outstanding train set. the legend of the entire train series, is the metroliner. this is a "super 5" set. the color, design, minifigs is just so perfect and lovely. it resemble the trains which we see on our rails in our daily life. i can't find any flaws on this at all. the only flaw i noticed is my mistake of not able to buy this set at all. in fact, i had never seen this set in the shops before in my entire life. thebrickster, on aug 5 2008, 09:23 am, said: how cool is that? and 11 minifigs - when was the last time lego included 11 figs in a single set? there is another set fufil the criteria above, which is also a well known legend. it has 12 minifigs which is the 10159 city airport aka century skyway airport.
nice review i collect all metroliner i can, i have 3 metroliner and when i can, i buy a other . my aim : have the more big metroliner collect, in france ( in first time ) it's my favorite set
ahh, the good old train theme. how i wish tlg would make such great trains today, now that the quality of city sets has improved so much. that really brings back memories, even if i didn't have this one, but a cargo train that came out about the same time period, maybe plus a few years. i don't have any trains myself at the moment, mostly because i'm afraid i haven't got enough space to put in on display with all the rails and stuff.
i don't like the set and i do like the set. the reason why i like it: it looks good. the reason why i hate it: this train was the first train for the new 9v system and it means to me the end of the beautiful 12v series. for this last reason i own this set. i voted average. only strange they named it metroliner. in holland when we speak of a metro, i need to think at short distance trains only used in big cities like rotterdam. and your minifigs at pic ain't right according the instruction .
my favourite, favourite, favourite old set. it's too bad i was born 2 years after its release, i would have had a major interest in classic town. i might actually get this one on bricklink... not that it'll go for a good price (i'll only buy if it does you see). an "outstanding", a highly useful and well-made set that really just stands out from its counterparts. edit: nevermind. edited by dovchenko, 16 august 2008 - 10:25 am.
nice review hinckley. i just got mine as well by paying quite a high price for it since its exclusive to us. however, i had not opened it yet and i left it in my friend's car. i gave it for an above average for that cool little jeep. for an exclusive brickmaster set, this is certainly one of the best vehicles i had ever seen. i like its construction built. if this is ever released in the main stream, i am sure it will be a hit to get a small sized indiana jones set.
i really enjoyed getting this set in the mail. its such a great small set and a good example of how smaller vehicles can have great details on them too. the only drawback is that i didn't get another satchel for my various uses for them.

thanks for the good review ! i can´t wait for mine to arrive! and just think how close paulc was in his reverse building of this which turned into a event exclusive in billund ! he was just wrong on the color of the headlight bricks (black instead of frown) and the rear bumper stuff which couldn´t be seen on the bag picture! kudos paulc! as for my badass patrol car and the sop (standard operation procedure) of cavity searches there´s more to see here over at brickzone - here´s a teaser: copmike
this set easily is above average for me. i had this as a little child, and whenever any of my relatives came to visit us, they brought me some lego. usually it was either this set or 6844 the really nice thing about this set are the alternate builds. for the low price you got a nice range of parts and cool ideas what to build with them. you could build a fleet of rovers, or the alternates, and everytime it was huge fun :)
i voted average. it's a cute set, and one which i built from parts many times as a kid. (i didn't own the set though.) thanks for the review!
great review brickster why exactly did the outback, adventure etc. themes never quite catch on......just a thought. what a great set! i wish i had it, but in 1997 i was just back from my whirl wind trips around the world and had drifted away from lego i don't know why. but i will say this i love the actual suspension that came with this set and the trains sets i have been trying to buy up as much of it as i can, and now i see i need to add one more set to the "i need to get that"
metalandi, on aug 5 2008, 08:56 pm, said: if you'd only know what memories you brought back! i think i remember this set better than any other i had, when i was a child. some time after i got it, i decided to disassemble it and combine it with the jeep from 6552 rocky river retreat. it came out pretty good, though. as it became the main attraction point of my town (beeing the car of my favourite minifig back then, and, and, and... looong story ), i kept it assembled that way from this day on until earlier this year, when i finally disassembled it because i needed the parts. great story. i enjoy hearing people reminisce about the fun they had with certain sets. i always wanted rocky river retreat but never picked it up. that's a great adventure set as well. i had never thought about mixing the two sets, but they do have components that would compliment one another nicely. if you still have the pieces, you should try restoring the sets - it's a lot of fun. simonwillems, on aug 6 2008, 04:37 am, said: this is by far my favourite outback series set! i loved the fact that you can bend the bridge in different directions so that the suspension of the car really worked to keep the car levelled, like you placed it in your last picture. i had lots of fun with this when it came out eleven years ago in 1997, the bridge scene could also be used in the adventurers serie of 1998. i think i may like the outback airstrip a little better, but it's close. i agree with you about the bridge. the moving pieces are a nice feature, and makes it harder for the jeep to cross. the bridge does make a nice addition to adventurers. i added it to my jungle adventure diorama a few months ago: stauder, on aug 6 2008, 05:27 am, said: i am kind of dissapointed they they didint continue the theme, as i only managed to grab 6487 and 6550 at leat you were able to pick up two of the sets. do you still have them and/or the pieces? bullet8542, on aug 6 2008, 09:57 am, said: why exactly did the outback, adventure etc. themes never quite catch on......just a thought. you're right - i don't remember them being very popular, yet they were really nice sets. perhaps they drifted too far from the "normal" town/city theme with fire and police stations? this would be a good thought for a future city/town sub-theme.

ok, this is the big one. the controversial one. the one everyone either hates or defends... what do i think? read on. the figs: bandana man masked dude dude with shades good figures, i miss scarface. comes with his torso, though, which is my favorite (the one with the ammo strap across the chest). one figure short of the figure-to-price value, but we can deal with that. the dino: the dino. it's the one that comes with the chopper, in green. any questions? the tank: and so it begins. i think it looks a lot better in person than on the box. the left side. good time to mention that the treads run pretty easily, and this is a very playable set. right side. keep an eye on that flap in the center... ... and we have a folding ladder! the back. probably the weakest point of the set, apart from the dino. the turret, turned and tilted. the mechanism works extremely well, and the gun seems to work better than others for some reason (or maybe it just seems that way). the front of the cockpit. i'm at a loss trying to figure out how those tiny windshields defend them against 40-foot mutant tyrannosaurus rexes with radioactive breath, laser eyes, and what have you... anyway, another one of those neat steering wheels, some viking horns, and some stickered control panels (oh yeah, this set has a good amount of stickers. probably around 20-ish.). the back of the cockpit. i love the little gun, it turns 360 degrees and tilts up. oh yeah, and those green barrels they've been using are awesome, i can think of tons of uses for them. the verdict: 7.6/10 playability: 9.4/10 pieces: 7.5/10 figures: 8.8/10 dino: 3/10 value: 4/10 the main downfall of this set is the price. i would easily pay $30 for this, no questions asked. but $40 was a hard sell for me - i gave in merely to see what i would think of it, and also to help you guys find out the same. this is a great display set, and a great play set. the pieces are good - lots of nice blay beams used in the construction. but the price, people. that's the killer. pick this up only if you have everything else or you find it on clearance. and thus ends my dino attack review series. hope you enjoyed them! until next time, bloody jay
tks for the review once more jay ;) i totally agree with you jay !!! this set has very nice details suche as the mini gun, movable ladder, green barrels and great figs !!!! however, it is very expensive for what it is and i don't think there are that many very usefall parts in there !!!! (well, i could use those treads !!!). if i ever buy this set, its really not for the design, which i totally dislike...
sam89, on aug 5 2005, 01:33 pm, said: thanks for the reviews once again. it looks like qite a nice set to me, although the european version will lose the big gun. i like some of the stickers (although i wish they were printed), and i actually quite like the dinosaur. i probably won't get it though, the set i'm most likely to get is the fire hammer. yay!!! some one that agrees with me!!!!!!!!! >-|

nice review cobra. thanks for sharing. i think arctic was one of those neat themes that never really took off. i like these little poly-bag sets as they make great starters/introduction sets for themes (or) serve as a nice supplement or add/on to an existing collection. i've always liked the thick green hood piece used in the arctic theme and have thought about using it in a sw hoth scene. in any case, nice review! i've got an arctic set that i built recently and will share a review soon.
so it comes with an extra gun-holding arm? it looks like it, and that's great. that way you can make all of the droids gun-totting ones.
this is a very nice looking set. it could do with a few more clones, but hopefully that will be fixed next year with battle packs. back to the set, i think the colors on this are great (i love dark blue) and the design is pretty good too. it seems to be pretty accurate compared to the real thing. thanks for the review!

my one post was deleted, so i shall remake it: thanks for the review! i really want this set! and i will get it. as kim said, perhaps it could be taken in sunlight?
well, i haven't been keeping up on what was going around in lego starwars,but i think this review would be an average
hollisbrick, on dec 29 2008, 10:20 pm, said: this is a great set it's too pricey though if it was $10 or so cheaper i'd get it! actually its on sale now. or at least for americans.

hollisbrick, on dec 29 2008, 11:22 pm, said: damn americans jk nah i'm aussie mate oh that sucks. actually im 1/4 aussie. but i dont live there. i love this set. i dont see how people dont like this. this is exactly like in the movie and personally if you thought it was supposed to be different i think you should study your star wars a little bit more.
i got this yesterday on sale (only 5500 yen>>>$60 american) and was a little disappointed. i'd avoided it, but all the new sets are at least a month away here. it looks a little weird in photo, and the actual build is worse, just a flat little disc with a cockpit. only special points for the color, which will probably just look better with those 2009 sets.
emergency evac set #: 6445 theme: town res-q year released: 1998 piece count: 97 minifigs: 1 list price: $8 (usd) in 1998, lego introduced a new theme called res-q. the theme was really a quasi-coast guard sub-theme of classic town. the theme included boats, helicopters, emergency vehicles, and even a water hovercraft. most notable was the black and yellow color combination that predominated the sets. i only picked up a couple of sets from the theme including this emergency evacuation vehicle that i consider a van. i never got into the theme, but looking back at these sets, i have gained a better appreciation for their value in classic town. let's take a look at 6445 in greater detail. starting with the box: the back of the box providing a few alternate models: and similar imagery on the instructions: the set includes one small sheet of decals for the van: 6445 has one res-q minifig that i find pretty nice. i like the neon orange reflectors: he has a nice printed backside with the word res-q prominently displayed: this little set includes an abundance of tools: a black walkie-talkie is not pictured here's the emergency van: i like the back section that has a nice winch with turning wheel and a few hooks for tools: here's the minifig pulling the grappling hook for some res-q action. this is my favorite part of this set: the van isn't too fancy but has some neat features: while i like the blue windshield piece for maybe space sets, i'm not really fond of its use for the van: the van has no steering wheel, but rather two levers for steering: on the top of the vehicle are two emergency alarms and some extra lights: the back of the van has a large opening piece that allows wide access to the back section: it comfortably fits a long gurney/stretcher: here's the driver resting on the gurney: he should never have tried to pick up the gurney without a 2nd res-q minifig. and a shot of the back section without the gurney: lastly, a picture of the complete set: final thoughts res-q is really a neat theme that has great play value for kids. while it's not one of my more favorite town sub-themes, it does offer some nice pieces and an abundance of black and yellow pieces. i think a few of the res-q sets go nicely with the divers theme released one year earlier in 1997. i had a chance to purchase the largest set of the theme, 6479 emergency response center, at half the price, but passed back in the late 90s. i'd be interested in finding out what other eb members think of this set and the res-q theme.
i am a proud owner of this set. like others, i got it discounted and couldn't resit the parts pack. this is the type of lego sets that bothers me. when you look at it now, you'd be tempted to say "hey not bad", but at the same time, some years ago, it wasn't good enough to buy it full price. i was kinda disappointed because usually sets using that kinda baseplates are excellent (castle, paradisa), and this one is just "ok". one really minus point would be the lack of any opponent faction in the set
thanks for the welcome everyone! though i'm still wondering where the drone minion/commander idea came from.
set: 7680 - the twilight theme: star wars year released: 2008 piece count: 882 price: $aud149.99 (or $159.99 if you buy at tru!), 99.99 euro, $us99.99 pity the twilight. when rumours of the set name first circulated, speculation was swift: 'twilight - that suggests something sleek, elegant and mysterious.' anticipation mounted! fan-frenzy grew! finally a pic leaked! and the verdict was... 'clunk-a-dunk' it appeared that in the jedi off-season, anakin was running something that looked like an intergalactic garbage scow, like roger wilco in the old sierra space quest pc games. blocky and bley seemed to sum it up. the set went from being one of the most anticipated to one of the least liked of 2008 pretty much instantly. it's a mark of that dislike that in the eb clone wars review feeding frenzy nobody has so far even bothered to post a few pics of this set even 2 weeks after it's official release! i'm here to redress that imbalance now and find out if 7680 is as horrendous as everyone originally thought part 1: box & parts front of the box. it's quite big, same size as the 10144 sandcrawler. annoyingly, it's the old style with the perforated corners that you have to tear to flip open the lid. detail of the back, showing set functions: interior of the box - a lot of wasted space. the set comes with 2 instruction manuals, each 76 pages. and no dss sheet! polybags! 13 of 'em. like the other cw sets, these are unnumbered. parts ahoy! you can tell at a glance that this set is comparable to the at-te, although there a large proportion of the 800+ parts here are technic pins and bley plates. part 2: minifigs and build the set comes with 4 figs (or 3.5, depending on how you look at rotta ): anakin, ahsoka, r2-d2 and rotta. very disappointing that there's nothing new here for such a high-priced exclusive, although i guess it is maybe movie accurate. anyway, to paraphrase the wise patsy stone, you can never have enough hats, shoes or new anakin/ ahsoka hairpieces so it's not too bad. pics of the build in progress. a quarter of the way through we can already see that this is one of those 'convoluted technic frames with some plates affixed' type builds: half-way and the smaller wing is added: at the three quarter mark the giant single wing is added: and voila! done! the final quarter is a race to attach all the exterior surfaces and details such as the engine and escape pod. the build itself is a mixed blessing. it is very technic oriented. i'm not a technic-ally minded person and don't really have much of a conceptual grasp of how everything functions until i see the final result, so i find these type of builds a little uninteresting. pins, axles and beams? give me bricks any day! i really liked the 7676 gunship and the 7679 fighter tank although they do contain some technic framework, they are largely brick-built ships, especially the fighter tank which is solid, largely brick built and full of neat functions. the 7680 build is one of the most technicy builds i've ever undergone in a system set, akin to the experience of building the 10178 motorised at-at. but whereas with that set you could understand the need for a technic framework (the thing walks!) a lot of this seemed excessive. yes, the twilight does some have nice functions, and it is so large and heavy it does need a strong skeleton, but to me it just seemed too much and aesthetics have been sacrificed for (in some cases limited) functionality. i will discuss in more detail what i mean as i look at different parts of the set. on the upside, this is the only non-symmetric set in the cw range, so at least every page and new step brings something different! part 3: a closer view close-up of the main body of the ship: front-on. it is well-designed how the figs appear in line of sight (unlike the 6211 where jabba and leia were photoshopped in to the box art). don't ask what rotta is doing out of the line of vision there. some things are better left unsaid. side view, showing escape pod (smaller cylinder) and drive: top view: rear view, showing back door. the rear deck is huge. indeed, the whole ship is huge. oddly so. i don't know if this is movie-scale or not, but i've seen people complain the fighter tank is too big (!) and that set is nothing compared to this baby! it's wider than the gunship and in wingspan and length is almost bigger. here's a few pics next to an mtt for comparison. pretty big, hey? turning to the dark side must be good for business. even if all you can buy is a rusty old beast like this, at least you could comfortably squash pretty much every vehicle in the opposing fleet just by landing on it. at least now you can see why it costs so much. the official pics make it look smaller, somehow, by truncating the rear and wing. the ship is in fact so big you can't really pose it with wings open - only hold it that way. i was too lazy to build a giant trans-clear support strut so propped it up on a shoebox instead. the wing opens very neatly - you push a technic lever and a pin holding the bottom wing pops out quite smoothly. the little top turret can move up and down as well to get the full cross-shaped effect. part 4: features and functions the front cockpit folds down very neatly, although i find the build here a little weak. whee! it goes all the way down to the floor. the mechanism is cool, but it takes up an awful lot of space. basically the whole front is cockpit and all lego could manage for controls is 2 printed 1x2 tiles as well (not pictured here, but they're attached to the part that folds up and down). there's also no way for anyone to get in or out of the cockpit. and an invisible windscreen! technology has come a long way. side view, looking from wing. r2d2 is here as well as some tools. you can also glimpse here one of the main problems with the set. despite being a huge boxy ship, there's no interior! none! the twilight doesn't even have an internal floor. all the room inside is taken up by the landing gear which folds up - again, a clever function but it really gets in the way of the set as a whole. kudos to the designer for coming up with stable, working landing gear, but too clever by half if it means that this giant ship ends up basically being one tiny cockpit and a rear door at the back that doesn't lead to any interior! underside showing landing gear when open: and closed - when the wing is folded down, the gear is locked in place, which is pretty neat. space-consuming, but neat. the rear section. the door, when opened, reveals an orange cupboard and a tow-line, as ahsoka uses in the box art. the door clicks into place when open and can be released by pressing the technic bit at the top. again, clever, but pointless as you can't get inside! ahsoka can indulge in a little recreational bungee-jumping if she so wishes: the rear deck is so large that it is wasted just being used so ahsoka can bungee-jump. i came up with a much better use for it. outdoor garden! despite having one roboticised hand, anakin was still quite the green thumb. and his light-saber was very useful as a hedge trimmer. so much so that he set up a side business between rotta-rescue missions. here's a promotional postcard: a few other bits and pieces. the gun turret on the enormous mega-wing can only hold one flick fire missile at a time (you do get two, though ) rear engine detail: the escape pod sits neatly on the side and is basically built the same way as the gunship bacta tank: the pod sits on these tehcnic pins and is held in place by the light bley parts: part 5: in conclusion the twilight is a huge ship, with a huge amount of great functions - folding wing, folding cockpit, rear door, escape pod, retractable landing gear! but this functionality comes at a price - a very complex technic build and zip interior. compared with the gunship, for example, which is stuffed with nooks and crannies, the twilight suffers in this respect. i also think it is just too large - it doesn't really fit with the other craft and vehicles released with the clone wars line. i may be wrong and it is movie-accurate, but when you have all the cw sets laid out it does stick out like a poor thumb. part selection is ok, with the only interesting things being a few dark orange plates, the orange cupboard and the big trans-neon green radar dish. don't get me wrong, i don't think this is a bad set at all. it's just the other cw sets are so sweet! i would say it's an above average set in a field crammed with excellent ones. if you're a completist, buy it, but if for example you'd rather invest in another at-te to upgrade your republic army, then i couldn't really disagree with you either and to finish on a light note, i'd like to remind you that you do get another ahsoka hairpiece, which can be used for all sorts of things. ugha warrior upgrade: dr inferno hair transplant: and finally, attack of the deadly blue-ringed octopus, native to australia's beaches and oceans! thanks for reading!
another outstanding review by the "awesome set reviewer"! i enjoyed reading this review very much and i felt that you have redress twilight in an approriate manner. i have very mixed feeling about this set especially with its design. it seemed i will need to watch the clone wars movie in the theatre before i compared with it. most of the time, when this lego set is used in a movie, you will tend to compare it and what is the actual purpose for twilight, same as the rest of the sw vehicles and aircraft. for a high price like this, i can actually top up a little more and get the at-te, with the same batch of minifigs plus commander rex. if there is a special figure such as the v19 torrent (clone pliot), it will be a much ideal scenario. at the moment, i have not bring in any clone war sets into my collection, and i am quite sure twilight is not in my priority list especially when i am not a full-pledged star war collectors or i have strong intentions to complete the entire range in this recent release. therefore, i need to prioritise my purchase, and likely to get two rgs, since that is my favourite ship in clone war era. i am not comparing it with rgs. both sets defintely have their pros and cons. oh, i love that postcard you made. certainly looks very nice! svelte_corps, thanks for doing up this superb detailed review which had given "twilight" the neccessary attention it should have.
really awesome review svelte_corps . you did a really complete and in-depth review of this beast and with your nice pics is really enjoyable reading your review, so congrats . i like this ship even if it looks so bulky but i need to buy first other sets, so maybe this beast will be landing in my collection the next year (or this one if i am lucky ). i can just ask for something, can you post a pic of all your clone wars sets together with this one (all the sets in one pic, not many pics with this an each set ) please . edited by darkrebellion, 12 august 2008 - 02:20 am.

thanks for the review. now i thinnk i will buy this set. btw, i really like what you did to the back. i might do the same to mine....
wow certainly much bigger than i would have thought, thanks for the great review and pictures =] well for some reason i was drawn to this set, but with the lack of interior and quite a bit of technics, i think i'll pass, or at least get the at-te first! thanks again!
i read the visual guide recently and learned a bit more about the twilight. i won't get into spoilers but it seems that the ship becomes a sort of endearing family van for the characters which is neat. big bulky, uncool, but it gets you from one place to another. if it factors into more than just the 90 minute film, i may pick this up. it seems that there's room for a lot of personality in this ship once you see the film. it is a corellian freighter smuggling spice for the hutts. that's cool right?
zzz, on aug 12 2008, 09:00 pm, said: and i simply love that there is space inside. you said there is not really some cause of the landing gear mechanism, but it seems it should be easily fixed. do you think there is enough space to put some plates over the landing gear and add some beds, kitchen und tv? i think this set is so perfect to mod it into a clone wars mobile home, your back garden ist just perfect for this. it does have that homely feel! there is room inside with technic beams to lay plates etc on, the only issue is that it's kind of fiddly to access. you could do it from either the side door or rear door though, maybe move that tow line at the back. i have to say, it is a set that grows on you
i will not be picking this one up. the main thing is that it simply looks akward. it is big and bulky, and seems to have random pieces on it with not reall streamline feel to it. i also agree that for an exclusive that it $100, it needs more than just 3.5 mini figures. anikan and ashoka and rotta already come in the at-te, which is cheaper and has more figures. r2-d2 is a figure that i am sure everybody has at least 4 or 5 of. for that kind of money, i expect something with at least one unique figure, and more than 4. i also want just a cleaner and better designed set. this is probably the letdown of the collection so far. every collection needs one.
i think some people agree that this ship is better than when we first saw those pictures, at least i do. it looks like it has some nice accessories that come with the ship as well. my favorite of you custom things has got to be the octopus it's so funny and a great use for the headdress thing. great review. edited by skipper 24, 13 august 2008 - 11:24 am.

good review there! my daughter loves the backyard garden of the twilight my opinion of the ship has changed after reading this, thanks!
time for another of the great castle sets. and yes this one is a great army builder set as well :d set# 7090 set title: crossbow attack price: 5.29 euro / 5.99 usd pieces: 54 release: 2007 the box: and as the other two sets reviewd so far (7009 and 5615), this one has a fitting box that is too easily snatched from the shelf and put into your shopping cart. - not sure it's a great thing...too expensive in the end :d the crossbow attack cart: the cart is a neat little build that actually works. and for once we're not given that awful technic launcher, but a "build-it" launcher! it actually works just fine for it's purpose. the addition of two crossbows makes it worth buying. never can get enought weapons for the evergrowing crownie army. the figs: oddly i've not taken any pics of the figs and therefore i'll illustrate using the s@h pic. the figs are great. i love the silver helmets and in this set you get 2 crownies and a skeleton plus a white skeleton horse. that's a lot of figs for a set this size. a true army builder. thumbs up for that. the all in all verdict: another small, yet super set in the castle theme. i bought several of these to make a fine little army. it's cheap and often found on sale! i can hardly resist buying it when i see it kimt
hard to find (in italian shops); i had a friend buying one for meas soon as the set was available. i always wanted another one, so while in switzerland (see kimt's 7009 review for the full story), i bought two. for 5 €uros you get two knights, a skeleton and a skeleton horse, some hand weapons and a shooting device (please remember, don't aim at the eyes!) just great.
and another set enters the scene: set# 7009 set title: the final joust price: 8.29 euro / 7.99 usd pieces: 62 release: 2007 the box: and yet again tlg has put the bricks in a box, that somehow corresponds with the amount of bricks in it. the castle theme has got well designed boxes :) the whole set (build): 2 knights, jousting fence and weapon rack. the weapons rack: another great addition of weapons. flail, halberd and skeleton scimitar. super weapons for those close encounter melee battles fought when tipped off the horse : :grin:p the jousting fence: not much to say. it's a fence. simple, yet it serves it's purpose very well. the crown knight: gotta love that guy. he looks like nothing can hurt him. he even got a selfsufficient smile on his face. i'm sure he's convinced that no skeleton can defeat him. also the horse, it's barding and the headcover looks awesome. a great old school sword and the ever cool normannic shield. what could possibly go wrong for this knight? the helmet i really love. imo it's a lot better than the old knight helmets (see review of 5615 the knight for a pic of one of those). the skeleton knight: the black skeleton horse rocks! i love that design and in black it's even badder than than the white version. the shield reeks of dread and the knight is one bad skeleton on the rampage. i do find that the helmet is a little off! i'd rather have a black knights helmet instead. the kk helmet doesn't really do it for me. the all in all verdict: this is another great army builder set. it holds a lot of great weapons, some cool minifigs and great pieces. the only thing that puzzles me is; why would a crown knight joust a skeleton? doesn't really make sense. kimt
blueandwhite, on aug 13 2008, 05:49 am, said: (a quick question about the poll: are we voting on the quality of the set, or the quality of the review?) later. the quality of the set. feel free to comment on the review and/or set also.
you know what i think this set has? charm. lots of it. i'm not a big fan of castle, having very few sets, all of them spanning different nations/armies, but i couldn't resist this set. and while not obvious at first, it really is backwards compatible with every castle set with a horse in it. nonetheless, i think this set is great. it's simple, cheap and has charm. that's good enough for me. plus it has that fantastic grinning knight and the black skeleton horse. those just made it better.
brickzone, on aug 14 2008, 07:42 pm, said: perhaps he meant the pearl light grey lance, which is not that common. could be, it's not that uncommon. it's in several sets. now red is uncommon.
good review kimt. pictures are clear and show each of the pieces in great detail. i agree with your comments as well. i'm a bit curious, does the knight's helm have a hole for plume? i've been debating whether to purchase this set or not. i'm not a big fan of horses so i'll likely barely use them, but i do like the unique minifigs, weapon rack/weapons, and the fact that the divider has a few useful pieces that can be added to other sets. however, i just don't feel the set is worth $8 when compared to crossbow attack and the knight's catapult unless the buyer is really wanting some mounted minifigs. luckily, amazon just lowered their price of this set from $8 to $6 (along with another 20% if using bill me later... just in case anyone was also in the same situation i was in). at that price, it's damn well worth it.
dj2005, on aug 29 2008, 11:26 am, said: i'm a bit curious, does the knight's helm have a hole for plume? i can answer on behalf for kimt, if memories served me right. yes, there is a hole for placing the knight's plume. do correct me wrong, if i had answered wrongly. it's been awhile since i last touched my castle sets. thanks kimt for this fine review. this is one of the castle sets which i had bought high volume, mainly for its horses, barding and the weapons. a great army builder and accessories for your castle armies. this is an instant "5".

"won't somebody think of the children?" guarded inn was another set only sold in the shop-at-home and not in stores for the same reason.
great review! i'd give this set an 8 at the least. it's just a tad too simple for my liking but other than that it looks great! while i'm a 4 wide car man i actually think this car looks rather horrendous. the main body seems way too low in comparison with the windows. the rare parts however do make up for it. hinckley, on aug 13 2008, 11:23 pm, said: yes yes. in the states, horrifying and deplorable violence is fine, but drinking and swearing sends kids directly to hell. somehow, i feel like watching south park now ... that was such a good episode
this is my favourite house which i owned during my childhood. although it's in the crypt, but i hope to build it back one day. looking at your review makes me so envy of you to own a complete set. the baseplate is very unique especially for its stoned pattern. classic lego telephone is just so lovely especially when its printed. the entire house layout is simple and very nicely constructed. in fact, the simplicity just showed how much lego could do with such parts. there are many nice furnitures included in this set such as the little oven/stove, dining table, bed and car porch. the little black car is a classic example of a true 4-studs car. i love this house very much, and my verdict is a full "5". no doubt about it. thanks hinckley for this lovely review.
i've 2 of these sets. one is for sale .....
i just bought this! it's truly a wonderful set and i love the houses from that era as well. very charming. great review!
cpt. pegleg blockbeard, on aug 14 2008, 03:29 pm, said: over all a nice set, i am a little confused by the dynamite though... perhaps an easy way to go fishing hilarious! i bet she threw out the penicillin and flare gun to make room for the axe and dynamite in her survival kit. who wouldn't? maybe she's a lost escapee.
overall, an excellent set concerning the price range. nice review, whitefang!
again a great review, whitefang! i voted for average: the minifig and the accessoríes are excellent - but the raft itself is very poor. klaus-dieter
glad some of you like this set for the wide variety of good accessories. it seemed some are unfavour of the raft's design. well, i think for an impulse set. the raft's design is quite good. at least, it took care of the color scheme well. it's just a simple raft for the adventurer to move onto the river stream and throw some dynamitte to blow some obstacles away. cpt. pegleg blockbeard, on aug 14 2008, 03:29 pm, said: this would be great for any pirate fan, the extraback pack for the soldiers, some spare owes for the row boats, a female face for a wench, and a rather simple raft for that unlucky pirate lost at sea! your comments make me feel like i has just done a pirate review instead of an extreme team review.
cool, then i think i'll do a review of 6451 river response later today or tomorrow, stay tuned!
i got this set as well as a res-q hovercraft. this set is cool because of all the accessories and it come with a x team guy. your set is also in much better condition than mine. you have made me decide to rebuild it. another great review thebrickster. keep up the good work.
looks like a nice helicoptor, i love the 2 cockpits. i love the diver's head, i really need one of those.
i've always wanted this set and the hovercraft... too bad i never did. great set.
i think the set is too unrealistic, i like the new resq sets better (and i'm somewhat a lifeboat freak so i'm always following such a sets with interest). i would like to see some rigit inflatable boats some day ;) but about the chopper, i like the accessoiries.
wow. i loved this set, i still have it actually... in pieces though, i took it apart quite soon after i got it, then managed to lose the instruction manual
6004 crossbow cart review because i may start collecting castle here is a review of one of my few castle sets. please note i hurriedly put his together meaning some parts are the wrong color, look out for them! this review will also be done in my star wars review style. the lighting is also particularly bad in the pics. on with the review... parts: 20 figs: 1 price: ????? 1.overview and fig the whole set. the fright knight's knight. the disemboweled knight. the head printing is just longer then the helmet visor. 2. the cart the cart has 3 crossbows and 2 norman type shields. the cart's advanced defense and weapons systems. all the parts from the cart. (forgot to add the fig in) 3.extras & overall here are all my castle figs. remember i don't collect castle. (yet ) oh yeah i forgot to put one of the old skellies and a ghost on there. could a castle fan tell me if any of these minifigs are rare. i have no idea because i don't collect castle. build: 6/10 pretty standard for a impulse. minifigs: 7/10 nice minifig with lots of accessories. design: 8/10 this set made way for some of the new castle carts of similar size. parts: 10/10 3 crossbows, 2 shields, arrow quiver, and spear as well as cool minifg in a 20 piece set! price: 10/10 well i don't know but lego was cheaper in '97 so it gets 10. playability: 5/5 pretty much standard for a impulse set. overall 8/10 good parts and price as well as minifig scores this set an 8. thanks for reading.
nice review i collect castle too and the ghost isn't really rare (i have one too) but it's not really found anymore so it would be a good thing to keep it. anyway great review edited by mammymarf, 15 august 2008 - 08:48 pm.
quote even though many people don’t like frightknights. i don't really like fright knights either i just happened to have this set.
great review! this set has cool features. i just wish that lego would release this as a lego legend and release it to australia too, since this is a set about australia. i would've bought two if this were a lego legend. that is how good it is. i like the building with latticed window and windmill. i also like the cargo airplane, windsock, and radios. plus it looks like it's got great minifigs.
the building is great and detailed, with a few mods it could be added to my castle town. i don't really like the plane though, seems kind of abstract, not really good in my opinion, but i bet it would be easy to mod to look better.
one of the best in my humble opinion. as far as i know it was never released in the uk so the only reason i managed to get my hands on it was on a family holiday to the us, i think they’d only recently opened the lego store in disney. arguable the best feature is that it seems to fit into a wide selection of themes, is it a airstrip in the middle of nowhere, is it next to a only mining town that’s not deserted the possibilities are rather open and that’s truly great.
thanks for the nice review kimt . i like this set especially by the fact that it is the only set containing the dooku minifig and the curved lightsaber , i also think that the minifig is cool but i also own the dagobah x-wing and the wookiee catamaran sets so i have enought minifigs (a clone wars version would be very cool ) and the extra-thingy is well, just ok. the bad part is that i don?t buy the set when it is out and now is go for $40 on ebay and bricklink . edited by darkrebellion, 18 august 2008 - 09:51 pm.
i missed out on this set but it looks pretty good imo. thanks for clearing up what that thing was i thought it was something they flung at eachother in the movie i like the lightsaber also but why did they stop making chrome ones
i was very lucky to get this set and i love it, i dont have it built cause i bought it for parts but it was fun while it lasted. .
great review, kimt! at that time, it was still in my dark age and i hated myself not to get this set earlier. this is quite inexpensive and you are able to get two greatest characters especially count dooku. the minifigs are excellent, especially the unique design of count dooku's lightsaber. i have no problem with the speedbike, as it looks quite alright to me. as for the elevation of yoda's jump adds some playabilty, but that does not work well for me. nevertheless, the main attractive factor is count dooku and i have to rate it a "5". i never own a yoda, except for the magnet version.
nice review! thanks for the clear pics. also, if you place a brick so the axles on the bomb mechanisms tips are touching the brick, the bombs should stay on. jifel
thanks for the review. i have had second thoughts about purchasing this bad boy and i think you made it clear that it was a nice buy. however, i would have loved the maf too!
you're me want to buy this
i don't know what it is about this set but i love it. i can't get enough of it. it looks amazing. nice review.

it took a long time, but now here it is, the review of the x-treme team set 6584 extreme team challenge. thebrickster asked me a few weeks ago to do this, since he unfortunately never owned this great set, so here we go! first i have to say, that i really love this late 90's town theme, and i wish there would have been produced more sets. this is the only one i own, well, beside that i also still have 6572 wind runners, but the car is missing. anyway, let's face the facts and let the pictures speak for themselves! sub-theme: x-treme team set nr.: 6584 name: extreme team challenge number of minifigs: 4 number of pieces: 354 release year: 1998 let's start off with a few quick shots of the box & instructions: inside of the box: we got some ideas for alternative models on the backside (the same ones are also on the backside of the instructions): instructions: here's an overall view of this huge set: we get 4 minifigs, each with different heads and color patterns, which i really like: ...and also a good amount of equipment for them: let's move on with the cool vehicles, there are 3 (!) completely different ones in this set, first is the neat little trike: next, the not less neat "4-wheeled off-road-thing" (don't know what's it called really ): and finally the huge monster truck, i love the chrome sidepipes and the wench with the hook in the back, which adds a lot of playability: oh, i almost forgot our brave adventurers also have got a raft to ride the wild mountain waters: now let's focus on the many details of the mountain base. we got a bridge over troubled waters, but be aware, it's very unstable! love the wood patterns on the yellow 1x6 tiles: on a corner a camera is mounted to document the wild life: for the evenings we also got a little campfire: down by the river sits a grey falcon and watches the guys on their challenges: what's that? seems not very safe, to be honest..be aware when you pass by these rocks.... ....cause it will collapse! let's move up again where the tent is placed, inside is plenty of space to take a rest for the figs and to store their equipment: but i think they should have built the tent on another place cause the ground isn't very good there: when you pull the mechanism, a trap door opens: will the guys all come back home safe and not injured? you decide! all in all this is a really great set, ome may say it is a bit juniorized because of the baseplate, but it really isn't. it's got a lot of playability and some rare parts, the biggest beeing the baseplate which is only available in this set. i hope you liked my review, let me know your opinions! edited by metalandi, 23 august 2008 - 12:56 pm.
thanks for the review! rock raiders was one of the last new themes i knew as a kid before my dark ages came. unfortunately i never managed to get any sets from it, beside a few months ago the 4910 the hover scout, which i review a while ago. wish i can get some of the bigger sets in the future.
i rate it a full 5 too. and i wish lego would make a set like this in 2010. a town needs pizza! edit: don't always trust peeron. sometimes they miss some pieces, and sometimes they just can't count them! edited by the cobra, 24 august 2008 - 11:41 am.
jopiek, on aug 24 2008, 10:48 pm, said: a very good set indeed, we have at least 3 of them, but we like them all. what do you mean by "we"? you own three sets of the orignal 1994 series or the 2002 legend series?
got this one as well, not much surprises in such a small set, but the fast-food pizza idea is pretty cool. as far as i know only the small mcdonalds promo and this set are related to food/restaurant thing (until the cafe corner that is) but since i have a classic lego city i can't miss this set.
whitefang, on aug 24 2008, 04:12 pm, said: flyut, if you need decals for the stickers that are featured in this set. hang around here until imperialshadows drop by to give you a little surprise if he is free. imperialshadows, on aug 26 2008, 10:53 am, said: surprise? free? i'm not even close to free, i'm rather expensive, but i do have a surprise for everyone! i think you'll be interested in the companion article to this fine review, my first set restoration project. that's great, maybe i'll be restoring my 6350 - pizza to go in the near future, thanks . now to figure out how i can get my printer to do what i want (sometimes that thing has a will of its own ) great thread about restoring pizza to go
great review! i really like this set and plan on getting it on bricklink. it would certainly add something to my collection!
wow. great review!
it's defintely nice to see this past classic town review re-surface again. i tom bricks, on may 15 2009, 10:05 am, said: i used to want this set so badly and i almost got it when it was rereleased. i still wonder why i didn't because with a building, van, 5 pizzas, and a then very rare female fig. this set would have been perfect for someone with a smaller collection like i had then. what surprised me the most is how well this set still holds up to others today. off to bricklink! i agreed that this set is perfect for someone with a small collection. in fact, i feel that this set is one of the "must have" set that can allow you build your pizza franchise in your town. posades, on may 15 2009, 10:45 am, said: definitely one of my favorite sets from my childhood; i still remember my sister getting it for me for my birthday and me building it that same day. too bad i had it displayed all these years on my windowsill so the pizza delivery van and pizzeria have become yellowed. is it possible to restore it by getting those bricks or parts again? yellowed bricks is really very saddening. it reminds me of my breezeway cafe. those were the days where we are too young to know how to take good care of our toys. alywin, on may 15 2009, 10:59 pm, said: i also always think the girl minifig is supposed to be a customer... lego is really up to everyone's own imagination... you are right! the girl could have been a customer. i thought of her as a staff. misrepresentation could be so easy, but then again, the box nevr stated its role too.
nice review. i have this set, and i like it alot. its a master peice!
do you mean this one http://www.brickset....aspx?set=2962-1 ? i would also like to get that, alone for the fact that it's the only res-q set with a female fig
i have this set and it's pretty nice. i love the res-q theme in general. i think that tow truck is easily the highlight of this set and is probably the best such vehicle i've seen in any city set. the other vehicles are also great. the base itself is lacking though, as it basically consists of one room that doesn't even have side walls. it does include a cool 3x6 computer sticker and a vast array of minifig tools and equipment though. i have some plans to modify the building and make it larger but have never gotten around to doing it.
nice review i hope i can get this set [as well as agents, city & other sw stuff...] and nice pics, i didnt think they were bad, i thought they were pretty good
splendid photos and well written review! i love it. i've owned and built mine and must say it's a good set and the tank don't disappointment in terms of design and playability. i got mine stickered, well been a perfectionist i am :p thanks again for the review that it should deserved :d
baby, i will like to take a moment to said "outstanding piece of review for your first attempt!" you have done well with the pictures and its flow. i have to admit that i love this fighter tank very much. the downside of it which is overpriced, and two clone troopers do not really justify the purchase. well, if i have the spare cash, i will defintely get one of this. keep it up.
mattzitron, on aug 13 2005, 11:30 pm, said: the strange thing is, for the first time i can remember the minifigs came decapitated, and there's no neckwear. i recall jake saying something about it being new lego policy to supply the minifig heads and torsos separately. what with the expenses-trimming and all, it's apparently one of the many little quirky things they've discovered in the manufacturing and packaging process that people have done for years without thinking (in this case, putting the heads on the torsos) but that turns out to be a surprisingly significant expense (timewise, i suppose). think it was in one of his blog posts, but not sure. too tired (ie, lazy) to go hunting for it now, sorry >-|
it's a shame it only comes with two figs. it would be great for my ancient middle-east project.
mattzitron, you have done well to display images of the dung stain hull... its a darn shame that it can't be extended. however, i see no reason why lego couldn't produce a special middle hull piece that is compatible. although the way they've made the hull is a bit stupid. the old system was a lot more flexible. better still why can't lego design a hull that can be extended in length and width... then they could be as made as long or wide as desired and that would be great!
they have made a special middle piece in this 4+ set: http://www.brickset....aspx?set=7075-1 the only problem is that it's red.
good work samsta! no wonder i wasn't aware. 4+ pirates and all...

i received this set with a $25 gift card, so it was a great buy. it follow with a similar build to the 2007 trucks, but has a few improvements. of course, the name of the set could have been a bit more creative... and yes, this was an academy review. set name: truck and forklift number: 7733 pieces: 343 theme: city year released: 2008 price: $25.00 usd, ?19.99 gbp, 24.00 euro 1/box now the box follows a design similar to most other city sets. it has the set information and photo of the set on the front, (sorry for it getting cut off, i will remake it). now the back of the box shows what each bag builds. bag 1 is for the forklift, bag 2 is for the cab, and bags 3 and 4 are for the containers. it also has the set's features. 2/contents the instructions: there are 2 books included with the set: one for the forklift, and one for the truck. minifigure(1) the first minifig you build is a simple cargo worker. interesting/new parts: here we have some interesting and new parts. they include a yellow seat, a 1x2 plate with clips, and a 1x4 slope. 3/the build cargo1 the first cargo palette has a few crates on it. i really like the sticker on the small box. forklift: the forklift is a very fun extra to build, and it is probably the best forklift that we have had so far. it is very realistic and is very strong. cargo2 the next piece of cargo is some octan barrels on a meter. i am not sure what it is supposed to be, but it is still a nice addition to the set. minifgure(2) the second minifigure is a classic driver with sunglasses and a coffee mug. very nice. new piece! this is a very nice new piece that is included in the set, a hollow canopy. i believe it is also in white with the police mobile command station. truck: now anyone who has had one of the lego city harbor sets from last year, then you will probably find this build to be very similar. mostly in the cab part of the truck. the trucks build is very solid, and very realistic. i sense ths will bring the ratings up quite a bit. mystery cargo: for some time specualtion has been going around, what exactly is this? it seems like nuero poison.. i am very happy with those 2x2 cylinders in trans-yellow. in fact, you can join in and guess what it may be in this topic. containers: the first container is built to hold one palette. it fits onto the truck. it produces a very pleasing result, and has a better look to it than the containers from last year had. the second container has the ability to hold two palettes, and has a design similar to the first. then, you build on the wheels. the back ones have beautiful mudflaps! finshed set: ---------------------------------- parts: 10/10 (lots of useful pieces, great colors, and some very cool new pieces.) minifigs: 8/10 (i would have liked another but it was $25, so i guess its okay.) price per part: 10/10 (almost 350 pieces for $25. ) playability: 8/10 (forklifts are always fun, and there are lots of things to do with this set.) overall: 36/40 90% a- this is truley an outstanding set, and it will make a great addition to anyones collection. mocers would aslo like this, due to the fact that it has some really nice parts. it has a great build, and utilizes some awesome new techniques. it also has details, something you might look for in a set. highly recommended. hope everyone enjoyed the review! if you have any pic requests, questions, etc., please ask! i look forward to hearing your comments, and the judges comments as well. 7733 peeron.com 7733 bricklink catalog 7733 shop at home
joebot, on aug 27 2008, 03:15 pm, said: very nice review of a set that i've been dying to get, but my friendly neighborhood lego store never seems to have in stock. the yellow seat is most definitely not a new piece. i had two of those in my old beta-1 command base, almost 30 years ago!! it is interesting however.
metalandi, on aug 27 2008, 03:26 pm, said: thanksfor this review, i also got this set recently, and i'm very happy about it. i live the design of these new trucks, and the forklift is also great. not to forget the good amount of cargo. btw., i think the "mysterious cargo" only are normal fuel barrels thanks! normail fuel would be in those octan barrels...
great review! i dig this set. it could have only been better if it had been a 6-wide version of the old 6367 semi-truck. still i ask: what's so special about the special edition?
metalandi, on aug 27 2008, 07:50 pm, said: that explains why it isn't in our local stores. i also got it from s@h, but my box hasn't got the "special edition printing" on it, surprisingly. just like dwarve's mine is exclusive to target. holodoc, on aug 28 2008, 04:16 am, said: nice review, vbbn! i stumbled upon your yellow seat as well. didn´t you have one already or what made you think it´s new? the big letdown on this set is the big canopy. i would have preferred single bricks for that. and for this truck there is no real need for a hollow canopy - it could as well have been made of solid bricks. maybe we get another set with different use of the canopy. this is one of the reasons i didn´t buy it so far. and i´m especially not interested in another forklift, i have plenty of those... i agree it´s the best one we have seen so far though. thanks! i have a yellow seat, but i just thought it was interesting. as for the canopy, it really looks good on the finished truck; i like it. and that forklift could be the official one, and the rest could become parts...
nice work vbbn i'm not really into technic myself, but you've definately done a fine review on this set funny that it actually fits a minifig. perhaps we'll see fans design forklifts with technic and having it minifig sized
that´s really a sweet and charming little technic set, thanks for that fine review!
as i've told you before, this is a great set and now it has a great review. thanks for this
the y-wing is the work horse of the rebel alliance. it’s well armed and heavily armoured, but you’ll need it because you’ll be moving like a sleepy hut! – general rieekan set name: y-wing starfighter set number: 7658 number of pieces: 454 figures:2 released: 2007 list price: £39.99 lets us begin with the box. the front shows it in all it’s swooshing glory. http://tdy.org.uk/images/7658-02.jpg the back shows some of the many features of the set and also others you might like to buy in the star wars range. after opening the box we find a single instruction booklet now we come to an important aspect of any star wars set the figure, here we’re provided with an anomalous rebel pilot and his faithful r5 droid. the pilot comes with the fairly standard lego star wars non-hero helmet printing. what’s he going to do with the blaster taken on the entire empire? one of the more interesting parts is the assembly of the engine, which if like me you don’t pay enough attention to the instructions when building you can end up getting wrong. the key detail i got wrong. just before fitting the last engine. if we look carefully on the side we can see a missile launcher. i didn’t think torpedoes or concussion missiles were fired from there but i may be wrong. after fitting the engine the models looks like this. in all it’s glory. manning one of the alliance’s fighters. not so ready to take on the empire was he? so overall we have a well designed model, which is in my opinion far superior to the original we were offered with darth vader way back when lego star wars was new. this y-wing is sleek and looks great in my opinion, the firing missiles are also a great touch. the rating system figures: 5/10 (for the same price the last x-wing had far more figures) parts 6/10 swooshability 9.5/10 design 9/10 price 3/10 grand total 32.5/50 not to shabby. conclusion. so finally the answers to the questions you’ve no doubt want to know is the set worth the price. i’ll be frank £39.99 is too much for this set. despite this i currently have a squadron of three y-wings, the reasons is this set has been on sale a number of times at £30 it’s certainly worth the money. lego recently placed them online with a price of £20, this i think was a great price for the set and well work picking one or more up if you wanted to start your own rebellion.
thanks for the review. i'll add it to the index. the y-wing is one of my favourite rebel fighters and this set justifies the coolest fighter
a wonderful set and a really charming design, well detailed and pretty smooth at the same time. perhaps that small gap at the cockpit´s an a little weak point, but we can always mod a little. thanks for that very neat review, cardinal brick!
stauder, on aug 27 2008, 08:45 pm, said: he doesn't know the story. but those pics of you swooshing it naked sure are halarious... the one in the park is extra good... you should see people's faces i mean, they are jelaous, of your y-wing! (yoda has my email :p hehe) staudie. haha i was making a joke and here comes stauder with his clearly insane lies. for the truth go here. now can we get back on topic or a you just dying to become sarlac food?
i like the model, it is one of the best rebel sets out there. but i don't like it that there is no landing gear. when you set this one on the floor/ your rebel base it looks like it crashed or something and looses its look of superiority actually quite fast. it needs to be at least 2 studs high, if not more, from the ground. tlc is in these days afraid of flimsy landing gear, as they gave to us in the early sw time. now they want something sturdy for playability. but i think there should have been some details on the bottom, especially a landing gear that unfolds. i also don't like the mistake of tlc (that they changed this year with the release of indy hopefully) to give the pilot a usual smile face. the old yellow version of gold leader even had a headgear. i hope tlc realised this year that we want more detailed faces. well, the licenced sets we got proved that, but who knows. the upsides of this set are the amount of pieces and detail, especially the engines were fun to build and perhaps the most interesting construction i have seen in years. also it is big, bulky and looks sleek at the same time, just wonderful. and next to the 4502 x-wing it looks in the perfect size! i gave this the highest rating, even if the underside disappoints. but whatever, it is lego, you can add some landing gear on your own! thanks for the review, your pics were really really good, next time make more of them please!

yodalikespie, on 03 september 2011 - 07:21 pm, said: is it worth the money since the new y-wing comes out next year? please, check the date prior to asking questions in old topics. three years ago in this case. it's rude to expect people to answer questions like that, especially since it's such a generic question. besides, how is he supposed to answer the question without knowing a lot more about the new y-wing...

etav8r, on 19 september 2011 - 03:16 am, said: is that a threat? is it fair to ban someone on the forum because they revived an old thread and made inquiries? thought this was a forum to discuss lego and that is what he was prompting. i don't really care why he was banned but this isn't the only time i've seen this type of behavior and discourse here on eb. not a threat at all - i was simply pointing out that yodalikespie made the mistake of inquiring about the new y-wing before we had any information on it. to my understanding, it's not so much the fact that he bumped the thread as the fact that he bumped it for no good reason. i'm not certain where the moderators stand on this issue, but i feel that yodalikespie's question would have been better received had he posed it after a substantial amount of information had been gathered on 9495 - as i've said, there simply isn't much one can go off of at this point to determine its value relative to 7658.
maybe the thread should be locked or taken down since the pics consist of broken links. kind of a pointless review without the pics. and for the record, there are other websites with preliminary images of some the new 2012 sets that are not on the eurobrick star wars 2012 rumors thread. perhaps that banned fellow was hoping some of the lego insiders had some knowledge about it. i guess we'll never know now. edited by sharky, 22 september 2011 - 09:22 pm.
do we really need more construction works? legoland is just one huge building site. theme: city set name: mini digger set number: 7246 number of pieces: 36 figures:1 released: 2005 list price: $3.50 (usd) 7426 peeron.com 7246 bricklink catalog diving right in let get some photos of the box the digger at work. the back just has more of the same not to inspiring. once we open the box we find two poly bags and some instructions the total contents of the box, well minus the air instruction booklet short and simple. now the single minfig of the set, nothing new of special that i can see. …got a job working construction for the johnstown company. moving onto the digger itself, it’s one of those builds where all you really need is a quick glance at the instructions and off you go. side view of the finished product. alternative view, it doesn’t look to bad. now lets add our construction worker. looks rather good, though the lifting action isn’t smooth. it’s nothing special, it’s not the greatest construction set that lego have ever produced but i think it is worth the money. the arm action really does bug me though. the rating system figures: 5/10 (just another construction peon.) parts 4/10 (nothing novel and i dislike the new digger arm system.) fun fun fun 7/10 (i think the playability is high and you can get a good load of bricks in the bucket.) design 6/10 (not the best designed digger but not the worst.) price 7/10 (a reasonable price for what you get) grand total 29/50 still halfway decent but nothing to write home about conclusion. this set is yet another in a long line of lego digger and to be honest it’s not the best in my opinion. i still hold nostalgic memories for 6504 which i still think is a great digger. from my point of view the set sits to high off the ground and make me wonder how the worker gets in. i really don’t like the digging arm action it will never be smooth and while it poses better i just think it’s inferior. despite this i still think it’s not a bad set, i’d just like it to be so much more.

finaly we get a new mech for takeshi. and yes, it's yellow. it brings back some flashbacks of supernova. good times. anyways, i recieved this set at christmas last year, with 3 other ef sets. set name: assault tiger number: 8113 pieces: 163 theme: exo-force year released: 2008 price: 15.00 usd, 18.95 eur 1/box the boxes this year are much different than those from previous years. it has some gaps in it, and has a cardboard backround inside of it. the box itself shows assault tiger and the set information. the back shows a combiner. the cardboard backdrop: a very nice jungle look to it. it has lots of fog as well, creating a pale effect. 2/contents the instructions: the instructions are clear, and straight-forward. also included is a lego "blooper." the remains of the sticker sheet: the stickers aren't too bad. i didn't apply the saw sticker as i wanted it to be left plain. the buzzsaw: a very cool piece. mocists will love this. 3/build the figures: the figures included are takeshi, who features a nice new torso. also included is the mini robot. his is a very neat little guy, but sadly, he doesn't really become a weapon. more of a block of red and black bricks. the torso: now the torso design for assault tiger is very different from the past years. it now uses a castle-like piece as the main structure. also of note is that he has a mini throne. no controls, sadly. and with the orange cockpit piece, it's impossible to see takeshi when looking at the at close on. see the third pic. the legs: the legs are slightly similar to the mt-201 ultra drill walker's, but have been modified to fit the at. they are quite large, and suit their purpose. the arms: the arms follow a new design, but the only problem is, they have no elbow or hand articulation. nice weapons though. the finished product: ----------------------- parts: 10/10 (lots of useful pieces, great colors, and some very cool new pieces.) minifigs: 8/10 (a robot would have been nice, and a better weapon mode for the mini-robot would have been good.) price per part: 7/10 (a stretch...) playability: 8/10 (the lack of elbow and wrist articulation isn't the greatest. overall: 33/40 82.5% b- assault tiger is a nice set, but some of those small little things can truly take a toll on the final rating. i think that i would only recommend this set to anyone who wants the yellow, and hardcore exo-force fans. s@h link peeron link i hope you enjoyed the review, and if you have any pic requests or questions, please ask. edited by sinner, 01 september 2008 - 01:52 am.
thanks for that good review, ~vbbn~. that´s really a fine and pretty solid looking mecha. i think that the designers did a good job on this last wave of ef sets, and the inclusion of these mini robots was also a pretty smart idea!
this was my first exo force set and i was quite skeptical towards the mecha theme, so i got it because it seemed to have nice parts. it turned out however that the mechas are quite nice :) i really like the poseability of it and since then i got another ef set.
the assult tiger is pretty cool
since my last post i've had the chance to build the tiger, and i was surprised in a good way. a much better set than i actually thougth. front
thanks for the interview, i nearly forgot this set is out yet. maybe i'll grab one off my local store tomorrow.
wait a second, a "troll"?? isn't that an orc? i thought that this is a troll:
wow. i like this set. but have no money to get it. guess i need to be fast and get it before it was sold out.
nice review, makes me want 3 honestly. and comgratz on becoming a teacher in the reviewer's academy.
thank you for the nice review. the set is not that bad, but a shield would be a nice addition. i also don't like the flickfire missile. a camp site with a fire and a chickenleg would also be nice about the rat; isn't it just foodsupply for the troll? the only problem would than be that the food is running away.
more firefighter, there must be a pyromaniac in legoland somewhere! theme: city set name: firefighter set number: 5613 number of pieces: 25 figures:1 released: 2008 list price: £2.00 (gbp) $3.50 (usd) 2.99 (euro) 5613 peeron.com 5613 bricklink catalog 5613 shop at home starting as always with the box i didn’t know red cylinders were flammable. interestingly an action shot and not other sets you might like to buy. the contents of the box. looks much like every other impulse set. firefighter, not sure there’s much else to say apart from i wish they’d included breathing equipment. looking pretty pleased with himself if you ask me. the equipment rack is fairly standard and easy to build, it does however include a fire hydrant. inbuild shot, will i be able to finish this complex build.[/. unsurprisingly i did. i nice selection of kit is provided. all together, i think the fire is a bit odd but it does add playability. if you want to increase the number of your firefighter and their equipment this is a great way, though there is something missing in my mind. the rating system figures: 5/10 (fairly standard i already have a fair few) parts 6/10 (good selection of tools, but lacks the breathing apparatus i’d expect in a set like this) fun fun fun 5/10 (there’s clearly something to do even if you just own this set.) design 5/10 (not going to win any awards but it’s robust) price 8/10 (nothing to complain about, you get a lot of accessories for the price.) grand total 29/50 (reasonable design and good accessories a good set to improve any fire department.) conclusion. this isn’t a set i’d necessarily buy, but while i was at bluewater today i decided i should try to review every impulse set myself, so that why i bought it. still i think it has some good playability and a good set of accessories if you need more firefighting kit, i just can’t get passed the lack of breaking apparatus, that would have made it a better set in my view.
quote if you want to increase the number of your firefighter and their equipment this is a great way, though there is something missing in my mind. what's missing?
brick built robot, surely we?€™re getting near classic space now? theme: space, mission mars set name: mini-robot set number: 5616 number of pieces: 24 figures:1 released: 2008 list price: £2.50 (gbp) $3.50 (usd) 2.99 (euro) 5616 peeron.com 5616 bricklink catalog 5616 shop at home let look at the box first. space man approaching the robot from behind. i?€™m not sure you can still buy the base easily anymore. the contents of the box. the contents of the box, it?€™s rather white. fairly standard mission mars spaceman, he?€™s got printing front and back but sadly no air tank! how does he breath? *as has been pointed out he does have a printed tank but i'd rather a physical one* note the megaphone is in flashlight mode not weapon mode, that?€™s important.. the robot itself feels a bit clumsy the metal detector is never going to touch the ground and it feel a bit wide. i don?€™t like the look of him something in the eyes. the reason why so we can have a box to put crystals in. both together and ready to explore new worlds etc. sadly the robot was homicidal, remember in space no one can hear you scream. it?€™s not a bad impulse set and if it marks the return of brick built robots to space then it?€™s a good thing. i just feel the robot could have been better built. the rating system figures: 6/10 (not to bad but nothing wonderful) parts 6/10 (lots of white and not much orange, but where?€™s the air tank!) fun fun fun 6/10 (probably the best impulse set as a stand alon toy lots to do with a robot and his human boss) design 5/10 (the robot feels clumsily put together i think it needs work) price 8/10 (can?€™t fault the impulse price.) grand total 31/50 (not well designed but does have more play value than other impulse sets.) conclusion. i was surprised that mission mars got impulse sets as it didn?€™t seem to sell as well as other lines last year. however i think this is a fairly good set, it has more playability than other sets and does come with a metal detector been a while since i?€™ve seen one (though i could be wrong) sadly the robot isn?€™t as good as it could be. edited by sinner, 01 september 2008 - 01:30 am.
opps well that’ll teach me to do reviews without my glasses! thanks for pointing that out stauder.
this here was a set that i new i had to get. a beautiful minfig, amazing minfigs, what more could you want? so was this set worth it? i guess you will just have to read the review to find out! set name: the batcycle: harley quinn's hammer truck number: 7886 pieces: 267 theme: batman year: 2008 price: 35.00 usd, 44.96 euro 1/box the new box art for batman is pretty stunning. it's clean, and really sells the set. for this set, harley quinn's truck is pictured attacking batman, with the set information. the back of the box shows a nice little comic, the other sets, as well as the set functions. 2/contents the instructions: the instructions for the set are, as always, clear and straightforward. they display the colors well, and have what we expect in an instruction book. 3/build minifigs: the stars of the set! batman is back with a new torso, much more metalic than before. harley had all new printed torso, legs, a new head, and that sweet new hat. batcycle: the bottom part is very sturdy thanks to a small bit of technic. the red throws it off a bit, but it isn't seen once the top part is put on. it has a nice use of the smoke stacks, and looks very nice in the end. the top part is simple, but suits the purpose well. it has handle bars, and a nice motor. the blue is a little strange though. hammer truck: the hammer truck begins with a very sturdy base. it has lots of detail, and really looks cool. rims added: lego did a very nice job at giving it a checker board appearence. the only problem here is that you stick a sticker over two bricks, multiple times. jewels: inside of the crate are these shining jewels. look how they illuminate the darkness in gotham... more added: then, we add on a spoiler and the crate. looking very nice now. the detail is again, outstanding, and it has a good amount of smoothness to it. the infamous hammer! okay, i haven't said this yet, but the square pieces need to stop. first on those sw backta tanks, now on the hammer? it creates a sloppy look for the hammer. still, this is the ultimate wacking weapon. added to the truck: on the truck it works pretty well. but the handle is to short, and it's near impossible to smash batman. the finished truck: the finished truck is really nice. the big wheels give it the monster truck feel, and the way that lego alternated the colors works well. the cockpit is a little palin, but that's not a major issue. the "i love joker" sticker is one of the best stickers i've seen. it's simply a classic. the finished set: ---------------------------- parts: 9/10 (lot's of good mocing pieces, and red and black are always usefull.) minifigs: 10/10 (awesome!) playability: 9/10 (the hammer is a little short) price-per-part: 8/10 (it's a liscensed theme, so meh.) set 7886 is a very nice set, and has some great details in it. the minifigs are very cool as well. however, their are some flaws. first, the hammer is two short, and is kind of square. the batcycle has a few awkward colors in it, which throws it off a bit. this set is definatly worth the money. batman fans will love it. and also wacking fans will like it, for that hammer... and if you would like to buy this set, here are a few useful links: s@h link peeron link please let me know your comments. and pic requests and questions are welcome!
cool! i also like the sticker on the back of joker's ice cream truck that says "i love gotham"!
very good, informative review. i really want this set but i never got around to buying it. i thought all of your photos are great and of good quality. keep it up!
i keep looking at this set to buy. since i have 3 10$ cards now maybe i will go pick it up at the lego store next month. so many things i want.
welcome to another sunny day in legoville...today we will be joining the mailman on his daily route delivering the day's mail. when i first saw this set, i immiediately liked it.i think tlg should make more of these everyday life type sets such as delivering mail, going to the grocery store, things like that. anyway, enough blabbering, on to the review! 7731 mail van set name: 7731 mail van year: 2008 theme: city pieces: 66 price: $7.99 pounds 4.99 euros 5.95 price per piece: about 12 cents we'll start with the box shots. the box is an interesting shape that i have never seen before. very rectangular. the box art is pretty nice. the back shows the mailman delivering some mail. the picture on the front is the same as on the box. random manual shot. the manual does not have the piece call outs, but on a small set like this, i don't feel it's needed. parts list. decent selection of parts. i really like the mail pieces. image at the back of the manual showing all of the cargo sets together in a little scene. i like it when the manuals have images like these because it's nice to see all of the sets together. all of the parts spread out. the parts in this set are pretty good. unfortunatly the car base is one large piece, however, we do get 2 printed mail pieces which are always nice. our trusty mailman. this torso i think is very nice. the little envelope is a nice touch. extra parts. not much to say here... the finished set! i really like the design of the van. it looks very smooth and somehow looks very lego to me. the colors are my favorite part. the red and yellow look nice together a nice mailbox. however i wish the letter on the front was printed. the front of the van is nice i think. the textured brick on the front gives it a different look on the front which is nice. the back of the van. the doors open to store mail, although it doesn't have much room, i like that they included this feature. delivery! the mail bricks slide right into the hole at the front. this adds nice playability. the van's all loaded up! we are ready to deliver! ======================= parts: 7/10 (pretty good piece selection, but for $8, should have included a few more.) playability:8/10 (it's fun to deliver the mail to all of your town's residents.) design: 9/10 (the design is very nice, except i feel that some of the stickered parts could have been printed.) overall: 24/30 after a long, hard day of delivering mail, there's nothing like enjoying a nice pizza and letting your hair out. why do they make us wear those silly hats anyway... this is a nice set that i can definitely recommend and i think tlg should certainly release a post office to go with this and the air mail set. i really like these everyday life sets rather than always fighting crime or putting out fires. those guys have normal lives too! brickshelf folder: http://www.brickshel...ry.cgi?f=338718
thanks for that very nice review, erdbeereis1. it´s great to see some other city sets beside the usual hospital, police and firefighter mayhem, and this is a really nice little one. now give me some car doors and a kevin costner-like mf and i´m a happy camper indeed, tlc...
nice review. i like this little set. some how it reminds me now of "postman pat" in dutch "pieter post", an english childrens tv series about a postman in a little village somewhere in yorkshire. aah, sweet memories i would rather have seen a postoffice released (with some women minifigs) instead of the green post bigplane. but maybe in a couple of years.
i do like the set also. i've bought 2 of them. one to build it up and one to keep it misb (i dunno for how long ). only poor things is that the wheels are too wide. car is 5nops wide instead of 4. afterall a good design. i wonder if there's a post office coming soon. by the way, great review.
rriggs, on aug 31 2008, 02:55 am, said: i actually like the use of the old style car base and mourned the day that these became exitinct the first time round (c1990). i don't hate the piece, but i did object to the way this set fills in the middle recessed area with a 2 x 2 plate that is nearly impossible to get out again without doing some damage to it. what's more, if you fill in the recessed area, you've eliminated the only rationale for using the car base in the first place.
i am not a fan of city/town/train-stuff. but this is a very good review, that almost makes me wish i had the time (read: money) to purchase some of the coast-guard sets.
thanls for the review, i was looking at this set last time i went to the lego store, but in the end decided not to get it. now you’ve made me really doubt my decision. one question though do you think the jet ski is as good as previous ones?
rriggs, on sep 2 2008, 08:50 am, said: you do get a piece call out with this set (i did anyway). it's on the back of the small poster that is included in the set! i meant the piece call outs during the build that show which pieces you need for that step. and cardinal brick, i'm not quite sure what you mean, but i cetainly think that this jetski is wonderful.
great review of a great set! one question: how does the robot-arm-piece connect to the jetski?
the coast guard sets are very eye catching. the color scheme is making me want to pick up the entire line, although the off-shore platform hasn't been released state-side yet. i've had my eye on this particular set for a few weeks now and is near the top of my to buy list. with instructions provided on lego.com, i build a dr. infero version of the jet ski to replace the one used in mission 2: swamp raid. it's a very sturdy design, bulky enough to make it feel like a real vehicle. great review, too. thank-you for the closer look at the set.
erdbeereis1, on sep 3 2008, 04:36 pm, said: it gets placed on top of this piece. i thought so, so thanks for confirming!
arrgh me hearties! let's join the pirates as they try to steal the sacred treasure from the islanders' hands. it won't be easy, king kahuka and his loyal warriors closely guard the treasure 24 hours a day. will the pirates with their trusty pistols and cutlasses be able to defeat the islanders' spears, pet alligator and powerful leafy skirts? we will find out! 6262 king kahuka's throne set info set name: 6262 king kahuka's throne theme: pirates-islanders released: 1994 price: ??? (i don't know the original price. i got it from bricklink with no box for $17. unfortunately, i was not able to locate the euro or pounds price.) pieces: 123 minifigs: 5 off we go! unfortunately, i don't have the box because i didn't like the idea of spending over $50 for a set with under 200 pieces. so sorry, no box pics. instructions i think the image on the front is very good. it seems less setup somehow than the instructions these days. it looks more like someone snuck up on them while they were going about their duties and snapped away rather than something that was planned. the parts a nice selection here. there is a pretty good amount of printed pieces in this set which is always nice. for example, the zebra print tile, as well as the pirate flag nowadays would almost certainly be stickered. the set also comes with a nice dark grey burp and a red boat for the pirates. the minifigs the main buying point of this set for me were the minifigs. this set comes with 5 of them which is quite good for a small set like this, especially when compared to the sets of today. the set comes with 1 alligator, 2 pirates, 2 islander warriors and king kahuka himself. i really like the islanders' torso and leg prints. the leafy skirts are a nice touch and the make-up on the faces is superb. some parts i liked these shields have a nice design on them and i always like the treasure chests. a picture inside the manual this is a feature that i liked in the manual, it shows an overhead view of the baseplate so it's much easier to find where to put the piece. i certainly could have used this feature in last year's aquabase invasion set. a close-up of the king the face print is nice. i wonder who kahuka's make-up artist is.... the finished set! first, the pirates' boat the boat is really nice. the sail is made out of a nice cloth, and connects simply to the mast. and now, the main part of the set, the throne! this is a really nice model. i think the colors and the design make it really feel like a different part of the lego world. the rock sculpture looks fantastic as well. the throne, which is sort of a stretcher thing attaches here. it connects on a 1x2 tile with a stud in the middle for easy removal here is the treasure that the pirates seek the treasure rests on tiles inside of the rock. the zebra print tribal drum this is simple but nice. one thing that's great about this which i mentioned earlier, is that this and all of the other pieces with designs on them are printed. that's right, no stickers to be found here! i have used these zebra-print tiles many times for mocs, as they make a great exotic detail piece. the lovely rock head i think this is wonderful. it really adds a lot to the set. it is well built with grey slopes, curved pieces for the mouth and nose, headlight bricks for the eyes and feathers and horns for detail. the backside the complete set! overall, this looks great in my opinion with great landscaping and some fun parts. well, it looks like the pirates walked all over the islanders and stole their treasure... in fact, it looks like it was pretty brutal. brickshelf folder now, for the the ratings! price: 8/10 (for $17 not a great price per piece value. but when you add 5 figs in, it makes it a decent price. plus this set hasn't been in stores for 14 years so that adds some cost) parts: 9/10 (the set has some really nice printed parts, as well as a baseplate, which in my opinion, is great) design: 9/10: (no flaws that i can think of right away. the rock face is very well built) playability: 8/10 (not really anything to play with, although you can sail the ship and steal the treasure) build: 9/10 (rock face uses nice techniques and the rest of the set is simple but looks good) minifigs: 10/10 (the minifigs are just fantastic. great prints, and just overall fun. overall: 53/60 bricklink entry peeron brickset it looks like the pirates have picked up a new recruit from the island... summary the older lego sets have a really different look to them than the new sets, and i think it's nice to have a mix of new and old. this is definitely a great set with a nice build and great minifigs. add to this the great printed pieces and that old pirate charm, and you get a very nice set that i can certainly recommend. thanks, and happy building! edited by erdbeereis, 17 august 2009 - 02:39 am.
erdbeereis1, i've had a quick look your review and i must say it's quite superb! i'm dead tired so i'm going to take a nap but i'll be back later to read it more thoroughly.
i feel the same way about the islanders sets brickster. they are a nice change from the regular pirate versus soldiers that is the norm. i think it would be interesting to see some new islanders sets released in the new pirate line to see how tlc would make them.
what a wonderful review with smart (showing the right parts) and clear pictures. fantastic job erdbeereis1! this set is interesting for several reasons. first of all it contains a large amount of (very) useful minifigs. not many sets of this size contain so much figs. secondly, the throne itself can be easily combined with the other islander sets or even with other pirate and non-pirate sets. i'm going to see if i can get this one for a reasonable price on ebay.
excellent review! i want this set now!
another very nice review, and im glad to see it has some nice pieces as well as characters too. looks to me that no one on bl has it in australia for sale so i may pass on this beauty. though i did pick up king kahuka recently. he makes an appearance in my medium entry
an outstanding set, too bad that i couldn't get this set set when it came out ...
well, for some weird reason i missed this before, so i tell you now: very good review (as we are used of you, erdbeereis1). i like all the islander sets, and own quite a few myself! for people that don't own any of the islander sets yet, the 6262 king kahuka's throne is a great way to start! lots of minifigs and accessories!
swman, on aug 29 2008, 08:35 pm, said: i do not like the fact that the clones have pure white legs. it looks weird to me. it was also weird that they included shock troopers, but it was probably a way to get people to buy it. this set also seems like one of those that was kind of thrown in with a mix of other sets like the tie crawler. i never picked it up, and with the new clone wars sets out, i won't. me too. i don't like the the shock to have white legs because i am very fussy and i don't mix them. i also expect other clone to be in this set but it came with 2 shocks. i buy it because i like the walker vehicle.
stauder, on aug 29 2008, 08:45 am, said: has anyone noticed the boxart includes the 3rd leg both in the lowerd position as well as the raised one? stauder. i believe that's to show off the functions of the set. nice review, you carefully explained every detail and i think that i'll buy this set now. i'm glad lego decided to make two seat's in the interior and they did a very nice job on the third leg looking good both up and down. i think i will switch the hips of the shock troopers into black, like the other shock troopers.
technic rotation joint disc set list. it's used in 10 different sets so far, not exactly a new piece a nice review with many good comments. i really like this set. it's one of the walkers with really good design and a lot of playability. it's the usual issue of using too many technic pieces to make a moveable feature versus minifig-scaled design. the same issue concerns for example the at-at, the twilight and the at-te (plus more sets). what annoys me in this set is the use of the 2 tan 4x8 plates. they "stick out" and it would have been better if they (the designers) had used dark grey or light grey plates. also i'll add this to the inventory - now!
i could have gotten this set if i wanted to but it seemed like a waste of money to me. i don't like the shock troopers helmets that much. i feel they should have printed visors instead of cut out ones like they have in my opinion it would make it look a lot better. the at ap itself sounds like it has a lot of holes in its cockpit which drags the set down and make it seem like they haven't exactly put a lot of effort into it. great review!
valentin, on aug 30 2008, 02:31 am, said: the ssd looks very similar to the actual screenshots from aotc, though am still wondering what's that little translucent red piece for... i assumed it was the droid's eye. great review btw. now i know what all the little bits are! i have this set as well, i quite like the droid. dr. s.

there's plenty of reviews in the review index. (pinned topic)
thanks for the review. i love this impulse set, i bought two of them so i could make a wizard and his apprentice. i didn't have an owl either so an extra is pretty cool, and i like the trans globe piece. batbrick away!
i scream clone, on aug 31 2008, 02:27 am, said: kudos on a well presented and written review. i think the reason this set didn't release in us was because it didn't have any warnings about choking anywhere on the box, therefore no lawsuits in us for lego. cheers isc no that's not the reason. i'm sure you'll get this set eventually. as for the box, well, there's always been 2 box-designs - one for the us and one for eu (actually there's an asian one as well). the eu doesn't have the box count or the don't swallow (we know that). the us version has the brick count and don't swallow warning (typical us). thanks for a super review strawberry-ice-man. i like the wizard, i'm only sorry they put him in an impulse set. who'd want an army of medium blue wizards? so it's the worst army builder, but a cool wizard. does that make sense?
the next in my attempt to review every impulse set single handed theme: space, mission mars set name: alien jet set number: 5617 number of pieces: 21 figures:1 released: 2008 list price: £1.99 (gbp) $3.50 (usd) 2.99 (euro) 5617 peeron.com 5617 bricklink catalog 5617 shop at home as always we begin outside of the box it looks rather exciting at first glance. set that cost a lot more than this one. now for what?€™s inside. the contents of the box, the impulse sets never look that inspiring. now for the alien, i have to say i?€™m not impressed. i?€™m not a big space fan and i only bought this due to my impulse review challenge, but as the main point of the impulse sets is the alien is a little hard to build a good set round something with one point or articulation. it lacks what make lego minfigs so great their articulation. now for the space vehicle, as always with impulse a short and easy build ensues. took maybe 2 mins at the most. time to mount the alien in his craft. the craft looks a little wide for him. slightly better from this angle but still not winning any awards. i?€™m disappointed of the impulse sets i?€™ve reviewed so far this is clearly the weakest of them, but what really disappointing is the other seem so good and useful. the rating system figures: 3/10 (the alien is not a good minfig) parts 6/10 (some interesting parts but nothing that special.) fun fun fun 2/10 (i can?€™t think of anything to do with this set to be honest.) design 4/10 (poorly designed the box makes it look much better.) price 6/10 (despite the impulse price tag i?€™m still unhappy about the price.) grand total 21/50 (less than half marks the lowest i?€™ve given so far.) conclusion. in many ways i?€™m annoyed, from the outside of the box this set looks quite interesting and certainly appears to be well designed. the idea of a small alien fighter/flying craft is in my opinion a good one, but sadly when you?€™ve got the finished product in your hand it looks nothing like the box art. while i think mission mars had some interesting sets and i might still get some of them this one will not be a repeat purchase for me.
well set out review with alot of great content! gotta ask you though, how does the set look nothing like the box art? with so few pieces i'd have thought one could mentally put it together given the box front.
i’m not a great communicator but what i was trying to say was that on the box the sets looks quite exciting and well made and that the alien fits much more snugly than it does. so i was a bit disappointed that it seemed wider and less compact and certainly less exciting when i opened it,
well now we at least know that we can avoid that set ;) johan
i rated this poor due to the fact the set is unimaginative (looks like a bunch of plates where thrown together) and it just isn't worth the money lego is asking for it, imo. i've never been a fan of the non-articulated "jellies" so i'll leave my disgust for them out of this post. however, unlike the set, the review is a fine work of art that clearly depicts the goods and provides valuable insight/opinions about the set's playability, usefulness, and overall value.
thanks for the review! the latter space mini-fig sets were great as they gave a nice variety of men. i'd love this one...
fantastic review! this is one of the classic minifigs pack which is so great for gathering massive number of minifigs. i miss those days where they sell 5 minifigs together in a set. thanks for this lovely review.
nice set, lucky you! the only reason i buy the mm impulse sets is lack of good space minifig packs like this nowadays ...
7670: hailfire tank and spider droid number of pieces: 249 number of minifigs: 4 price: 19.99 usd/ 25.99 eur/ 19.99 gbp brickset hello everyone, today i will review the extremely underrated hailfire tank and spider droid set. i hope this review does it justice. so, let's start with the box: note: this picture is not mine. standard box for star wars in that time. the background on the box looks like it's from geonosis, indicating that this set is from episode ii, and not iii or the clone wars. the back of the box (not shown) shows the playability functions and some other sets that were released at the same time as this. overview here is an overview of the whole set. it comes with one construction manual and no sticker sheets ( ). this is a very simple set, but with not much to it, it is still a very important part of the cis army, especially if you are interested in army building. i like to call this set a "super battle pack", and you'll find out why soon. let's get right to it, and look at the feature of the set: the hailfire tank. front a front view of the very cool tank. here you can see two triangular shields on the hull. the main body is very simple, but altogether very effective and clever, and making it really look like a hailfire tank, although a little bit sized down from it's movie version. the trans-red stud used as the "eye" makes the tank look more menacing. side the side view. the wheels are very easy to make, but it's a real pain to connect all of those chain links together. i don't see what you could use the links for, except for another tank, but maybe someone creative will find something for these. the dark tan is nice though. the wheels are held on by technic poles, and the tank rolls on the wheels fairly well on carpet or a hard surface. back this is the back of the tank. here you can see eight flick-fire missiles (four on each side) of the new type, so they don't easily fall out. also note the modified 2x2 with extended hole piece sticking out of the back. this may be used to easily push around the tank. i just wish you could fit a droid in the body for the cockpit... now we move on to the spider droid, or what i like to call "the dwarf spider": the front. this one is also simple, but very cleverly built. the main body is two semi-spheres connected together for rotation, and an antenna, a cannon, four legs, and eyes made out of a useful telephone piece. the picture speaks for itself as far as how the gun and eyes are built. side a side view. you can now see the legs better, which are more sturdy then you would think. each one is made out of two pearl bronze exo-force robot arms, a useful bley handgun piece, and a dark bley battle droid body, all connected to the under body (a big knob-like piece). back the back. not much to say here. i like this spider droid because it is very sturdy, and the legs are easy to adjust. finally, we look at the minifigs: there are four minifigs in this set, which is quite generous for a set of this size. it comes with a yellow battle droid commander (i really like this one), two battle droids, and a super battle droid. all three battle droids have the new blaster pistols and one twisted arm. that's about it for the review, so here is the final verdict: build: 8/10, very fun and easy, besides the chain links. should take the seasoned builder less than 20 minutes. playability: 7/10, the flick-fire missiles are fun, as well as just zooming around the tank. could use some clones for a battle. swooshability: 8/10, you can roll around the hailfire fairly well. minifigs: 9/10, a generous amount of figs, and all are pretty good. design: 9.5/10, a really simple and clever set, although a little too small for the movie version. price: 10/10, a very fair price considering the price-per-parts ratio and the coolness of the set. overall score: 8.5/10, a very neat set to have, a great army builder, and great for display next to all of the other cis sets. the price is fair, the figs are good, and the build is very clever. that's all for now, folks. please feel free to give some feedback! edited by jimbutcher, 15 september 2008 - 03:08 am.
kimt, on aug 30 2008, 04:21 pm, said: thanks for sharing this review with us. i think this one of the sets. in europe this thing is waaaay overpriced and thus makes it a crappy set. we pay nearly double the us price. so i rated it poor. also because the figs included does not make it great. the hailfire is well designed and looks great, but that's just about all there is worthy of a positive mentioning. sorry. [on a side note: as a bronze-awarded student, where's the price in eur and gbp? and where's the poll?] [nevermind the poll, i've added that one for you ] oh yes, i will add the other prices, and i was going to make a poll for it (i made one for the homing spider review), but you beat me to it. thanks!
thanks for the review, jimbutcher. i really like that set. it combines interesting and good design with some awesome cool parts and a neat amount of charm.
great review. i agree that this set is underrated. the hailfire is supposed to be a little taller than two battle droids, so scale-wise it's nice. the dwarf spider droid is amazing in my opinion. i just wish it wasn't brown, it makes me feel like it's on geonosis. we never saw a grey varient of the hailfire, so it's fine with me that it's brown.
this is a great set, i have 2 of them now, and i plan to get more. it is much better than the droid battle pack. for 10 bucks more, you get better battle droid arms and some canon "vehicles", good enough for me.
thanks for the review. is a great one. this set is not really a good set but i like the spider droid. the hailfire droid scale is not right, i think it is suppose to be even bigger. anyway, this is the first set that re-release the commander droid. so i grab it.
thanks for the cool review jimbutcher . actually, i really like this set, it is small but very clever and even if the hailfire droid is undersized, what in the whole line is not under or oversized . the new spider droid is the best small build i have ever done in a set and the droid commander is pretty cool . i am happy with the set and i will get another with my comic-con exclusive .
i just bought this set the other day and i must admit that it gets a "below average" from me. the price is not corresponding with what you get. which would be implied, had jim added the eur or gbp price in the info[hint hint ] the spider droid is flimsy at best. making it stand or even move without tumbling over is hard. also why the brown cylinders on the legs? keep the colourscheme clean, please. the figs are fine, except that i dislike the clone headgear and the fact that the helmets now have holes in the sides, allowing the flesh head to show within = goofy looking. i am soo replacing the clone heads with black ones. great review of an acceptable set

thank you for that good review, jimbutcher. i think that this is really a pretty interesting and original looking set. maybe it´s not very stable, but it owns some special 'war of the worlds' charm for sure...

thanks for the review. i really do like the first year of ef. nowadays they mecha are perhaps more cleverly designed, and use ball joints for playability. but i really love the blocky bulky look of the first drone's machines. and somehow the older ones seem a better value of parts. i'm more inclined to buy duplicates of them than the newer models.
i like the theme very much, but sadly, i don't own any sets of it. it brings such a great feeling, it's fresh and has great parts and sets. and it brought the polar bear! your review is very good and informative, thanks! (i voted wrong, i meant above average, but i clicked below average )
thank you for that fine review, thebrickster! i really like how this two small sets create an intense and adventurous atmosphere against the backdrop of a pretty exotic region. the sets´re well designed and very nice with a fine amount of rather unique and well fitting gear. the whole theme offers a lot of playability in a set-up that´s a little different to tlc´s standard sceneries for sure. and... it always reminded me of 'who goes there?', too...
hi! great review on one of my favourite themes! i never realized how cool it was until just now, when you did your review. anyways, i remember my one set of the arctict expedition, the arctic expedition pack
a very nice review! i really miss the arctic theme. i didn't own any of the sets, but after looking at the pictures in this review and reading the instructions on brickleys words and brickfactory, i want them.
nice review brickster! the arctic theme is very nice. the minifigs have a great look to them especially with the hoods. the colors for the arctic sets i have always liked, and somehow the idea of minifigs exploring the arctic is fun to me.
thank you very much for this review, thebrickster! i voted both times for outstanding because: i really the arctic theme. i only bought the ice sailor but otherwise no sets because of money and place reasons and because i already collect four themes (city, older castle, western and star wars old triology). but a comeback of the arctic theme - perhaps as addition to a winter sports and winter rescue theme would be very welcome! i really all sets - the little and the big ones. in my opinion they all were very well designed (not too big vehicles, not too little and not minimalitic, great minifigs and very nice and lovely details and accessory). klaus-dieter
thanks very much for this great review thebrickster! i love the arctic sub-theme, but unfortunately i never got my hands on any of the sets, since this theme had its time during my dark ages. this one is a really neat little set with a great amount of accesoires, especially these snow shoes and the backpack which i love
on this, the first anniversary of the news organization that has become so near and dear to your hearts, eb news is pleased to present a very special feature that we've only added recently: the eb news review! this is really our third such extravaganza, but the first one to actually be done right, so it's my great honour to welcome all of you to this event. i'm your hostess with the mostest, er, host, imperialshadows, getting in the way and generally causing mayhem will be staudie, of course, and actually presenting the review will be cub reporter and senior reviewer, whitefang! yes, the ever popular whitefang of the reviewer's academy. you know him, you love him, let's hear some applause! *audience cheers wildly* oh, that's too kind, now how about some for whitefang? name: airplane mechanic theme: lego system / town / city year: 2006 pieces: 26 minifigs: 1 price: usd$3.50 the featured set will be a 7901 airplane mechanic. this is the smallest set ever released in the city sub theme, airport. we will be bringing you to on site experience in the hanger. today our special guest is a mechanic who is specially trained to handle with jet engine turbines. *camera rolls* aren't our pose look so cool? staudie, your clothes are still white. let's just all try to smile until this picture is done. look at our special guest. he can still smile in that weird position of his. quiet you! *interviewing process* i am the airplane mechanic, holding a grade 2 license. my specialisation is to maintain and repair jet turbines of 7893 and 7894 passenger planes. we have many mechanics, 24/7, across international airports, making sure that the planes are in safe condition. we are able to maintain from rolls royce, pratt & whitney and general electric engines as well. this is the trolley to push the turbine engine around. this model is used for passenger planes 7893 and 7894 series. look at the size of the turbine. it required actually 4 engine turbines like this, to power a 7893 passenger plane aircraft. i have all these nice essential tools, to work on that engine behind me. there is a wrench, hammer, oilcan, open end wrench, power drill and screwdriver. *whistles innocently* geez, he thought no one would notice him pushing the engine away? *testing process* as you can see, the crane is firm and sturdy. it is able to lift the engine at a certain height. hey get off there! for goodness sake, this is not a rodeo. yee-ha! whitefang must fixed his loose wires. i knew we shouldn't let him read those superman comics on break. give a man a cape, and he thinks he can fly. *the audience laughs* what's so funny? it's dangerous to stand at that position. staudie, are you done with your measuring yet? almost there. *clang bang clank* oof! get this thing off me! i'll push, you pull! let's get moving! *clang* i think i sprained my pride. no, wait, it's my back. i gave up my pride when i took over this news organization. *shadows flips the engine, crushing whitefang* get that hook off my head... guess, we are heading for a commerical break at the moment. wait up, let me pull the white curtain. that's all, everyone. with me, staudie bringing the end of the show. imperialshadows and whitefang are currently in the legoland hospital where whitefang is getting patched up and shadows is flirting with the nurses, mostly. i really hope you loved this interactive review brought to you by eb news reviews. overall, we felt that this was a very good impulse set with a wide range of mechanical tools and an extra turbine to play with. therefore, we recommend you to get it since it's very affordable. anyway, every airport need mechanics/engineers to maintain the aircrafts to make sure it's certified to fly. this is too formal. i hate reading it from whitefang's script. it's best to do it in staudie's style. yo yo yo, whazzup? er. no, that isn't it either. um... thanks for viewing! i hope to bring you another exciting and information review soon, here on eb news reviews! *camera fades*
2872 witch and fireplace review theme: fright knights parts: 18 figs: 1 price: unknown (bricklink $5.00+) year: 1997 brickset peeron brickshelf bricklink ever wanted to turn into a animal, wanted to curse your enemy or just wanted to be rich beyond your wildest dreams. you should go visit the witch and her fireplace. she can brew you up a potion for any occasion or purpose. so head down to see the witch right now. although this set is from the fright knights theme it can easily fit in with any other castle theme due to the lack of specialised fright knight parts and printings. the set comes with no astounding parts but looks like the source for our good magician impulse set from the current castle theme. i think i got this as a promo set. official pic. the box art for the set has the standard fright knight background and lego system logo followed by the set number. down the left hand side of the box a cat is attempting a head stand. also i think this box display the contents of the set in an attractive set up as usual. 1. the whole set minifigs and all here is the witch. on the torso there is a spider amulet which is a little hard to make out due to the low res of the image. the witches wand is the same as the bellville fairy wands except in trans red like a lightsaber blade although it is completely useful as a lightsaber. as you have probably noticed the witch has no legs instead she has a slope brick with the dress pattern printed on witch (get it witch-which) looks better than asajj ventress' from the new clone wars sets in my opinon. (for this anyway) the fairysaber (new word) duel. this is the old run down fireplace of the witch. at the base there are two smouldering coals instead of fire witch (it's not funny any more is it?) doesn't make that much sense seeming as it is a fireplace. the little triangular brick on top doesn't really do anything i also accidentally put the wrong one on while building, it should be a sloping brick. here are the coals. the old trans orange studs are less translucent than the new ones. i like how they have places them above the main baseplate on a 1x2 plate so they are in line with the rest of the fire place other wise it would look wrong. here is everything else i haven't covered yet, the crystal ball, the pets and the magical potion vial. the crystal ball is identical to the one included with the good wizard impulse form the current castle theme. i like the molds for the cat and the bat although if the cat had some yellow printing for the eyes like the white cat had black for the eyes it would be much better. i think the trans green tube things are a little uncommon but i'm not worried about that. 2. overall build: 6/10 extremely puzzling and difficult do not attempt alone . it's pretty simple but seeming as it has a load of stuff you can move around it is good. minifigs: 9/10 i really like the witch and it couldn't have really come with anyone else also it came with the wand which is really good too. design: 8/10 it should have come with some fire and maybe some more orange bricks to put at the base. parts: 8/10 the minifigure isn't bad nor are the animals or the trans green part. price: 10/10 i am guessing this was pretty good. seeming as i think i got this as a promo i gave it 10 because it was free. playability: 7/10 as wth all impulse sets there isn't much here but at least it comes with some animals to have a fight with or give the witch rabies. overall: 8/10 if it came with some more stuff for the fire place and the cat was more detailed it would have scored higher but because this set can easily be intergrated with other castle sets it got a mighty 8. 3. mini comic ! hocus pocus magic shocus turn my pets into dinosaurs (not to catchy is it?) *poof* oh know i think i might drink my magical potion glug glug glug oh! my
thank you very much for this review, skipper 24! i voted for outstanding since this set is a little but very lovely set. i really it (although i don't own it yet ) since it's very similar to today's impulse sets: a minifig and some nice additional stuff. and i like the black cat which gives the set a more gloomy atmosphere. hopefully tlg will include a black cat and a chimney like in this set in the new advent calendar, too. klaus-dieter
thanks for the cool review! as for the set: a witch, a bat and a black cat!!! that's more than enough for such a small set!
kimt, on sep 30 2008, 12:55 am, said: you're damn right, that is strange why is this your favourite? please explain, i'd love to find that out haha! i wish i could. well, i like small sets, and this is, aside from the fright knight's flying machine, comes in the smallest lego box i have seen. i just like the look and story feel of the set. i wish lego put out more sets like this and the 3075 ninja master's boat.
nice review. i can tell that you put some effort into it. the moc is a nice design. your reviews are getting better and better!
this was an exellent review keep them coming. -ras-
6205: v-wing fighter number of pieces: 118 number of minifigs: 1 price: 9.99 usd/ 13.99 eur/ 8.99 gbp theme: star wars/ episode iii year released: 2006 brickset folder bricklink catalog welcome to this review of the v-wing fighter. this will be my eighth review on the boards. strangely enough, there was another set called the v-wing fighter that came out in 1997 for the space theme. note that i am missing several small pieces to this set, but they are mostly insignificant to the overall look. the box this is the standard box type for all 2005-2006 star wars sets. i can't say that i like it as much as the 2007 or 2008 box types, but it'll do. it features a profile view of darth vader and silver text. overview this is the whole set. this ship is meant to protect the chancellor at all costs. they are usually found in groups of three or four. front this ship is very sleek, and you'll notice that it's colors are dark red, light bley, and dark bley with a touch of black. it starts at the nose very narrow, but as the body progresses to the back, it gets wider, like a "v" (hence the name). back here is a view of the rear. note the trans-neon green discs used to represent the boosters. also notice the dark red r4 astro droid and the hinges used as aromor. flight all four wings (two on each side) can open up for flight/ attack mode. they can open even farther then the pic shows, but it's not an intended function. the wings a great, but it's a real pain to position them correctly, and the bottom wings close when you set the ship down. tail fins this is what the tail fins look like on each side, with two flaps attached to the top and bottom. if you look closely, the tail fins and wings look a little bit like a mini ship themselves, maybe controlled by remote. no, this is not an intended function, either. guns, side the guns are very simple but very clever, using a double technic hole piece, two black bars, and two technic pins. also note the landing gear. minifig finally, here is the minifig: a clone pilot. it has light blue arms and legs, white hands, a helmet with black markings and republic insignia on it, and a double-sided torso. the front of the torso is great, featuring shoulder straps, armor plating, and a life support system. while this minifig is not altogether accurate to the movie, it has still been one of my favorite star wars figs. back the back of the fig that can double as the front of clone marines. this side features shoulder straps and armor plating. cockpit lastly, here is the pilot seated in the cockpit. he fits perfectly, although it is not air-tight. we wouldn't want the poor guy to suffocate, now would we? that wraps up the review, here is the final verdict: build: 8/10, a nice, easy, build, and the last of the small sw ships ($10 or less). playability: 6/10, pretty fun to swoosh around, but that's about it. could use a vulture droid, but that would take away the 'small' factor. swooshability: 10/10, very fun and easy to swoosh around endlessly, without fear of it breaking. minifigs: 9/10, there really is no need to have more, although a palpy fig would be outstanding. the pilot is a great figure though. design: 9/10, extremely accurate to the movie, but the cockpit is not airtight. price: 10/10, you couldn't ask for a better deal! overall score: 8.6, an excellent set. unfortunately, this is the last of the small sw ships currently. the fig is great, and the sleek design is accurate. that just about sums it all up, feel free to leave your comments! edited by jimbutcher, 15 september 2008 - 03:11 am.
this was a great set for the price. ten dollars for a cool minifigure and a decent sized ship is great.
thanks for the review. this set never got me, so i didn't get it! i also don't like the droid-head-only thing and i haven't bought any set like that. i planned to buy this on sale... but it never happend.
very good review! i enjoyed reading this. i want to buy these battlepacks. until now, my country has not re-stocked these battlepacks. i wonder will they ever arrived again. i want to build massive armies with this outstanding battlepack set. hope it will arrived soon.
nice review, which reminds me i must order some more of these battle packs at some point. are you going to also review the skelton battlepack? also i hope this is a start of a running joke about castle sets being stomped by sw sets
how were you able to get three small shields. i only got two in mine. i am going to check the trash just in case.
swman, on oct 6 2008, 07:27 am, said: how were you able to get three small shields. i only got two in mine. i am going to check the trash just in case. i think it only comes with two. the extra one probably slipped in from another set. sorry for any confusion!
and another great review from one of our academy teachers, i always look forward reading them ! i think the battlepacks for castle are a great initiative from tlc. i like this one, but also the one with the skellies, you get some different looking soldiers and a few weapons and shields, so that's cool. the low prices make it so that most people could build a large army/battle if they want to. a big for your review and another for tlc for making these. edited by zorro3999, 06 october 2008 - 05:40 pm.
it's way to expansive for what you get, besides you pay more for the package then its containts...
i really love these impulse sets at a low price point for lots of minifigs this police one doesn't appeal too much to me at the moment, but who knows, with your reference i may need it with a future project! hmm... it's actually a good way of getting those dogs cheaply
i agree that this set is worth the price considering the amount of minifigs and even a skeletal horse. it also comes with a lot of blue 1x1 slopes that are always useful and quite rare to obtain. another weapon for the soldier operating the catapult (or a shield for the other soldier) would have been great, but that is pushing it. the crossbow itself is quite nice and is better than what most $6 sets come with, imo. overall, a good set indeed. thank you for the review and the other review concerning the knight, of which i hope to buy in the near future as it looks like it comes with a great deal of goodies. the weapon rack is useful, too.
thanks for the input!
i like this set mostly because it has some very usable pieces, but also because of the amount of minifigures in the set, which is a whopping three and one large animal (skeleton horse). the one thing, however, that i don't like about it, is that one of the catapult operators isn't armed. in my opinion, this would have been a good time for tlg to release a suitable dagger piece (not the kitchen knife) for its castle line. great review, by the way, it captured the key elements of this fantastic small set.
nice review . i still thing sets like this are the reason castle has done so well, it allows you to collect a large number of minfig for not very much cash, which i certainly indulged in. my only complaint is that you end up with the evil skeletons out numbered, however heard of the good guys winning with the numbers in their favour.

dark times in lego castle land... the poor knight is being held prisoner in the skeletons' prison carriage. we must help the brave knight on horseback free him at once. let's ride! 7092 skeletons' prison carriage set info set name: 7092 skeletons' prison carriage theme: castle released: 2007 price: usd 19.99-gbp 14.99-eur 19.95 pieces: 193 minifigs: 5 animals: 4 price per piece: about 10 cents review time! box shots our first pic is the front of the box, which shows a dark image of the knight attemping to free the prisoner. and here is the back, showing some features. the manual the image on the manual is the same as on the box front. random manual shot no piece call-outs, but the color distinction is not a problem. the parts 193 pieces doesn't seem like a lot, but many of them are quite large. the selection is pretty good. lots of greys and black. minifigs with this set comes a whopping 5 minifigs which is amazing for a $20 set. the knights are very nice and one has a double-sided head. the horses adding to the already large minifig count are the 4 horses. 3 skeleton horses, and 1 great brown horse for the knight. extra parts now, the finished set! first, we have the brave knight on his brown stallion. the horse's head covering looks very nice. and the knight gets a nice long pointy stick. the main event, the prison carriage! the design of this is excellent. with the bionicle piece and the white horns, it looks very spooky. the tower this part is one of my favorites. it uses white horns to give it a great creepy look. one problem is that there is barely enough room for the 2 skeletons. the driver here you can see the driver and his whip. you can also see the bionicle spine. a side view when you look from the side, you can see the great design of the prison. it is placed on tiles for easy removal and looks great with the round white 1 x 1s on the corners. horses' harness this is another very well designed portion of the set. the harness attaches easily to the horses and to the carriage. the prison look at the poor imprisoned knight. let's try to free him! the back of the prison hinges down! the knight is freed! everything together all together, the set looks fantastic. the carriage has a great creepy skeleton feel, and getting 9 minifigs is amazing. brickshelf folder ratings price: 10/10 (193 pieces and 9 figs is fantastic for $20) parts: 9/10 (lots of good large pieces) design: 10/10 (captures the spooky skeleton look very well) playability: 8/10 (it's fun to try and free the prisoner and the carriage rolls well) build: 9/10 (easy but fun) minifigs: 10/10 (the sheer amount of figs is great and they look great) overall: 56/60 the future of lego castle... summary this is an amazing set for the price. a huge amout of minifigs, combined with a great design and good playabilty makes the set a winner. i would certainly recommend this set to anyone that remotely likes lego sets. thanks, and happy building!
well, indeed looks like a very nice set. especially the scared knights are very nice ;)
what an amazing review! i actually have this set and i decided to take it apart. it has a brown horse and a lot of useful pieces, so taking it apart was a good idea. now i have three lego horses! hoorah! the end of the review was the funniest... lego12
other than the minis, accessories and animals, this set is 'meh' at best.
great review, erdbeereis1 this really is a fantasic set. let's hope lego makes more sets like these (with 5 minifigs+4 horses at a price of $19.99? ) actually, it's about rm200 here. and it's not even price-to-piece count. anyways, amazing review, ad if i could get more castle sets this year, i might even join the reviewer's academy
great review erdbeereis this is a cool set! pics are great! love that shot of the lightsabers! well done! commanderfox
you say in the review it's great to get 9 minifig's, but there are only 2 minifigs and 3 skeletons??
sir dillon, on nov 20 2009, 10:07 am, said: he's probably counting the four horses as well. oh, since when are hores minifigs?
thanks for the great review! this is one of my favorite city kits from 2007. i think it's a lot better than the cement mixer from the classic town theme - and it has some cool pieces too.
this set pulled me out of my dark ages. thanks lego!
indexed going through the boards i was amazed to find out that no one ever attempted to review one of the best lego classics, the 6399 airport shuttle. while i was studying for exams a few weeks back i decided to take a break, built the monorail and take some pictures of it. resulting in the present review. along with this i made my first ever poll. here we go: first, some data: setnumber: 6399 setname: airport shuttle released in: 1990 in holland, though bricklink says 1991 number of parts: 731 number of figs: 9 price: unknown, prices on bricklink vary from $261 up to $2300 (!) but this was an expensive set even in the nineties the box: mine is a bit battered by the owner before me, but there's still plenty to see. this is one of the largest boxes i have (look at the minifig in the down-right corner for the comparision) and it is a really neat storing facility for many sets. the box shows the set, and in the background the silhouet of the set that is to accompany this one: the airport from 1990. i like the angle of the box, showing the two stations, track and train in one picture. the back of the box shows some really nice ideas for other setups, why oh why has lego abandonned this kind of showing what's possible with one set...? inside flap of the box, showing details of the set and the functions, detail on the front of the box, displaying the dimensions, it really is a huge track layout for one set! the instructions: there is a nice little booklet showing the same picture as the box art with the figures lined up underneath. the last page nicely folds out to show the entire setup of the tracks, the figures: a brilliant selection of minifigs including airport people and a cook. all figures that are supposed to go on the shuttle carry a ticket and there are also some suitcases (tickets fit inside, of course) station # 1: the set includes two stations. here is the first, depicting the airport. there are lots of details: a phonebooth, two seats, some flowers, a map, luggagelockers and of course the streetlights. a detailed shot of the station showing the luggagelockers and ticket-validating machine, part of the beauty of this set is the fact that it is so extremely detailed, just look at the signs to show where to go next (stickers), and the scenery opposite the street... the station has the same shape as the airport shuttle logo, how sweet is that? the station pictured as part of the layout. the stations ends are made with airplane wings to smoothen the arrival of the shuttle. station # 2: here is the second station, my personal favorite: an elevated stop with a little snackbar underneath and stairs leading to the platform. some chairs and streetlights here as well plus two old fashioned trees, the part of the set that can be used in any layout: the snackbar with hamburger sign (sticker). yes, those hamburgers look tasty indeed! also notice the lights hanging from the platform overhead and the ticket-validating machine at the bottom of the stairs. here we have the platform with information panels and seats. also notice the two trafficlights for the train. here's how it works: the train will travel in the direction the arrow is pointing. when turning the knob the two grey blocks will move towards or away from the track-center, activating a button on the centerpiece of the train (the motor) which makes the train start it's journey around the track. there is only one speed and the train can only be put to a stop or change direction at stations. the station as part of the layout. the shuttle: now on with the train: there are two carrriages connected to a centered motor. the power is provided by means of a batterybox containing a 9v battery. the batterybox is in one of the carriages and displays: airport shuttle. a total of five passengers can be seated inside leaving room for their luggage and two drivers. the front carriage with the button for the batterybox showing. the underside showing the gearwheel (metal) that brings the power from the motor onto the geared track. the black pointy things alongside the gear-wheel react with the direction knobs at stations. this is how the shuttle negociates with height differences, everything hinges and rotates, making the shuttle capable of performing steep climbs. the motor is powerful enough to not slow down at such a climb! detailed shot, showing the first set of covered wheels in hinged position. the shuttle on the layout. the full layout: this layout is quite huge, involving lots of track pieces, ramps, ten large stanchion-poles and the two stations. to show the movement of the shuttle i have made a 20 second movie, which can be seen in my brickshelf gallery of this set. conclusion: well, to conclude the review, some final thoughts: this truly is one of the more detailed sets around (at least from the nineties) and one of the largest in dimensions. the monorail system is cleverly thought out and works excellent. track extensions are hard to get however and very expensive nowdays (especially the switchpoints and long straight track pieces). the tracks included with this set will provide you with hours of fun though, because there are a lot of them. it can be quite hard to incorporate the monorail in your town without having a clearly-based-on-the-monorail-alone town. i tried to incorporate it some years ago (link here), posing a real challenge. the ratings: price: 8/10: this is an expensive set, if you can get it for under $200 get it!), this set is rare in any condition. parts: 10/10: lots of rare pieces, cool minifigs, 9v system, roadplates, lots of minifigseats en red trainwindows. originality: 10/10: there are very few monorails released, this one being the only town set. compatibility: 8/10: can be a bit hard to incorporate in a town, but hey: you got the monorail so no complaining here! total: 36/40: i can only reccommend this set to anyone, it is my personal favorite set upto this present time! if there are any questions, ask them, all comments are welcome of course!
you chose the perfect set for your first poll, simon! no question this set is one of the all-time-beauties. i rated outstanding of course. i never hat the chance to get a complete copy of this set, but i do own the engine and quite a bunch of monorail tracks. your very detailed review made me think of getting the whole set some day. thank you very much for this! i never realized there were so many details included to this set: the snackbar and the telephone cell and all the other nice things. really strange for a nineties set which often lacked details. the only thing that comes to my mind right now is that the engine looks quite blocky. if the set was released today, tlc would use more of those parts which make a better design imo. and it would fit better to the curved walls of the stations as well. [wishful thinking]how much would i love to see the monorail system back again! [/wishful thinking] i had to lough when reading your comment on the minifig seats. don?t you own many of those? i don?t know where to put mine...
an excellent review of one of the jewels in the crown of the lego town range, to answer one of your question i think the lack of people owning this set is one of the reasons that its yet to have a review. personally i’ve only seen this set in the flesh once in my life when i was a child just before it was withdrawn from sale. it is a lovely set, well made and well produced though i think there is a flaw and that’s when the passages get of the other end of their train ride what picks them up, a bus set for the airport would have been a good addition. apart from that i can’t really fault it and that fact it comes with three female minifigs is just stellar. as for incorporation, keeping it elevated seems the most sensible suggestion. i’ve always thought it i have it and wanted to integrate the set to a town to use it in the style of the dlr in london, but that’s just a thought.
thanks for that splendid review, simonwillems! i clicked on "outstanding," of course! i also like those little details, especially the ticket validating machines. you're very fortunate to own this wonderful set! i hope you have an airport to go with it. edit: and bricklink is wrong giving 1991 as the release date. you're right; it was 1990. edited by legotrainfan, 05 september 2008 - 06:57 pm.
thanks for all the nice comments! holodoc, on sep 5 2008, 11:05 am, said: i had to laugh when reading your comment on the minifig seats. don?t you own many of those? i don?t know where to put mine... well, of course i do have quite some seats (a drawer full actually), but this was my first set that had them in black... when i was young however (long time ago, you know ) i always had a short supply of seats, so that's why i noticed and mentioned it.... whitefang, on sep 5 2008, 02:18 pm, said: this is an outstanding review which deserved to be featured here! thank you for drawing attention to this review through classictown.net, i have not been a frequent user of the boards lately and the release has mostly passed me by but i must say that it looks like a great site! whitefang, on sep 6 2008, 06:45 am, said: are the both of you doing grading out of the academy, when he is not a student there? indeed i am no student of the academy, i have another academy (university) to attend to, leaving little time to venture around eurobricks latlely, a shame, i know... i hope my review is in accepted here despite my lack of grades concerning the art form
just funny that everyone likes this set outstanding. i love this set also and glad i own one. it looks fantastic with trains running underneath it. good review .
indexed name: refuse collection truck set no.: 6693 theme: lego system / town year: 1987 pieces: 103 minifigs: 2 price: unknown special parts: 4215ap08 (yellow panel 1 x 4 x 3 with recycling pattern), just occurs in this set (2x). 4598 (red bracket 2 x 3 - 2 x 2), occurs only in this set and only one other set. this truck was introduced in the same year that lego came up with the garbage bins that of course also appear in this set. have you ever wondered why most of the time the streets of lego city are so clean and neat? no litter, no garbage everywhere, no chewinggum on the streets. even with so many different inhabitants, it seems to always stay that way. however, the older afols amongst us, have experienced totally different situations: rubbish everywhere, smelly and dirty looking pavements, minifigs that were losing their standard grin. that is why lego came out with this magnificent truck back in 1987. before that, people needed to put there garbage in bags or maybe barrels. from that year on, every miniman and miniwoman is happily using a trash bin. the minifig civil servants never seem to become tired and the garbage truck comes every other day to collect the rubbish and keep the city clean. the secret behind the clean lego city and the always happy 'standard grin' of our minifolks are the anti-litter warriors that use their powerful machines and handy tools to just get the job done! so if you don't own a garbage truck, better try to get one, before your standard grins also fade and your streets become as dirty as naples (where the garbage collectors recently had a strike for quite some time). an overview of the set including instructions (actually one is included in the set). unfortunately i afraid we don't have any boxes of this set left. another image of the lego items in the set. it shows the truck, two civil servants to perform the waste collection duties, two garbage bins and a broom and shovel. the two chaps that always seem to smile, even when the litter that they collect really stinks. the accessories that accompany the set. a broom and a shovel to help cleaning up in case a dustbin tips over. a very nice feature of the set is that the elevator at the back can be lifted in more or less the same way that real garbage trucks do. as you can see here, the dustbin is emptied through a red 'train window'. (it seems to be that the hinges of my version will need some 'revision'.) panels inside the back of the truck maximize waste capacity for this 4 stud wide truck. it is nice that the designers added this simple red round brick on a clip. presumably it should depict cylinders to let the back compartment tip for emptying or otherwise it might be gastanks. again the complete set. it is very complete set but some additions could make it even more playable: - garbage (e.g. a green flower bottom or some round plates 1 x 1) - a place for the second worker to position himself on, when the trucks needs to drive to the dumpsite or an other street and also vertical bars for that second worker to hold himself by. this is what the truck will look like when dumping the litter at the recycle plant or dump site, the whole back nicely tilts, so that all the litter will fall out of the truck. a view on the back of the truck. quite a small but yet effective opening. the front of the truck. only one seat for just the driver, but i personally prefer that to a 6 wide truck that fills the total width of the streets and has problems with corners. of course set 7991 (the orange garbage truck of last year) is also nice, we also own some of those but we never put them in our lego town since they take too much room and the color scheme of 6693 is also more preferable to us. the two panels with the printed recycling pattern are a bit worn so we might recreate the recycle logo and put it on a sticker some day. playability: 8/10 (like i mentioned it is too bad that the set doesn't have any litter [however lego also saw that and has put litter in the 6693 set]) design: 9/10 (a really nice truck with two minifigs and very nice details) price: -/10 (i was not able to get any price information, at bricklink one can still obtain a 2nd hand one for about 25$.) overall: 8/10 (a set that should be entitled a 'classic' in the same list as the pizza restaurants, the 7750 and the blacksmith shop) that was all the pictures i was allowed to take since it seems that those brave man still have quite some trash cans to empty. thanks guys for doing the dirty work so our minifigs stay happy and our streets stay clean! peeron lugnet brickset: bricklink entries additional notes on the review: my brother has always been keen on garbage trucks. however when he became aware of this truck it wasn't available in the stores anymore. newer sets that had the 'recycling theme' we not that good. they didn't have the emptying mechanism. so after our dark ages, one of the first sets we bought, were some of those nice refuse collection trucks. although the new orange truck has the desired mechanisms and thankfully is a decent garbage truck, we more like 4 wide trucks than 6 studs wide trucks, so for the years to come our lego town inhabitants will still be seeing this great truck to control their waste problems.
thanks so much for the great review, i love that truck! i hadn't realized there was a real 4-wide recycle truck out there. i must get it one day to replace this abomination currently doing garbage duty in my town: i think that truck has seven pieces total in it. i do like the blue color though ...
greetings! just looking through the review index when i came across this one. i recently acquired this set through ebay which came with a practically perfect box and instructions. i would almost say that no one played with it much as all of the parts were brand new. anyway, i just wanted to say that this is a great set that was worth the $14.99!
great review, and i love the soft yellow effect to the pics imo, the most recent garbage truck should've used the same piece for lifting the cans into the big bin instead of the droid arms
i did not see this! nice review and beautiful truck. i like it!
a nice set, my brother used to have this. i wish the pilot's helmet had a little printing on it, looks messed up to me.
the interceptor is my favorite tie ship so i wish i picked it up. thanks for the review, i agree about the helmet, needs some silver printing on the mouth piece and the ends
thanks for sharing your thoughts and opinion about this set with us. i've added it to the index. this is one of my favourite ties and i think tlg did a good job at designing it.
i owned it and loved it when i was young ^^ i really miss it.
jopiek, i enjoyed this review very much! your first picture, certainly capture the essence of this lovely set. in reality, i am in the aviation line, especially aviation safety. therefore, you re-entact the scene very well. to be honest, i have never seen this set before. this aes (airport emergency service) fire truck is certainly unbelievable. i love it very much. it's a pity i never owned this. this is a set which give me a "5". great job jopiek. i enjoyed viewing your classic town reviews very much. keep up the good work!

i remember my cousins having this set. both are in their permanent dark ages now but are not willing to give their lego to me if you have one of those old airports, then this set is what you need to have even more fun since it makes a great addition to the airport. excellent review! 10/10.
nice review cobra. thanks for sharing. i esp. like the doctor's torso. i rate this little set a 4 based on the design of the vehicle and the classic doors. blogged! edit: i must have missed this review after it was posted back in sep. i went ahead and kept the blog, since it's always enjoyable to look at these reviews.
i think the 6382 fire station is the better one from the 80ies.
found this set on a flea market in munich, yesterday. just 25 years after its release. the instructions for a total of five models, two of them printed, the other 3 are just photo instructions in the book. it still has the box in good shape, despite some wear from the age. sadly five little pieces were missing, and 5 wrong pieces inside instead (2 complete wheels and a classic 80s-90s plane wing (dumped into my bricks). but i was able to replace the missing minifig torch and the 4 missing plates with identical pieces from my collection. the box and contents the set still has the original box. inside the pieces, plastic insert, instructions and a 1987 technic catalogue, imagine that set livespan today. four years and the 8841 is still in the catalogue. classic technic design from early 80s showing a function drawing of the steering and the main model a small set, but with a flap shoeing the contents. all pieces in the inner box and the papers included. 5th model: soapbox racer this is more or less a soapbox racer with working steering, but no engine. it's got a rather blocky design, but still looks sleek enough and is a simple build little over 100 pcs out of 180. the soapbox at step 2 just included the steering at step 6 completed and ready to race downhill. total: 7/10 simple, but effective 4th model: simple chassis very simple and boring alternate using just 1/3 of the 180 pieces in the set. it even hasn't got a seat construction. it's just a plain steering mechanism attached on wheels with a spartan chassis of just a few pieces. this is the whole model at step 5 just attach the steering mechanism and wheels and you're done total: the worst alternate model of the complete set. just a boring 4/10 3rd model: balance very original small model. it's a small model of a working classic balance. and it works with small parts laid on the scales, altough they've got just a 4x4 footprint. it's a fast build. just 15 minutes and you've done it. the model as it looks at step 3 finished. easy build with just 63pcs out of 180 total: very original model, it actually works with small weights, but a very simple build. still a 7/10 alternate model: tractor with equipment this is the second model. it's a simple but boxy design featuring a harrow and a plough. the tractor has a similar design to the very first tractor set, but much smaller. the plough is about 24-wide and the harrow is completely snotted even back in 1983. has two functions: working steering and the coupler for the equipment. uses almost all pieces of the set. the tractor at step 8, the steering isn't completely attached now this is the completed tractor the complete harrow finished alternate with the plough attached. total: nice, but quite ugly and boxy design for a tractor with 4 wheels of the same size. takes me to a 6/10 main model: desert racer this is the main model, with a nice (for early 80s) but boxy design. it has two functions. steering and a working 1-cylinder rear engine, which is of the old 2x2 piston type, since the small piston design wasn't invented back then. this is the only model of the set, which has piece callouts in the instructions. the printed alternate model has no callouts, they weren't invented on both models back in 1983. the three smaller photo instruction alternates have a piece callout at the beginning showing all needed pieces. the seat is a nice, but blocky design and use a primitive snot technique. this is the model at step five. the piston is already attached. imagine this state on step 5 in modern sets. back then lego had challenging instructions, not the step madness like today this is the engine just made of plates with a hole in the middle for the piston step 9. the piston engine is completed. on step 12 the roll bar and the seat are installed. only the steering isn't completed yet. front view of the finished model. just 15 steps needed back then. bird's eye view of the whole set displayed on the box model verdict: nice design, especially the colorful seat in snot technique, but quite boxy especially the engine, since there were only the huge pistons. still a 9/10 set verdict: design and models: 7/10, very boxy designs, due to the age. the chassis alternate sucks build: 9/10 classic 80s technic building. quite challenging but fun sturdyness: 7/10: rear section damaged after the table fall, but rather easily fixed fun: 9/10 blast from the past. overall: 8/10 mfg widdi edited by widdi, 07 september 2008 - 04:11 pm.
nice classic set. are those hoses around the engine pneumatic tubes? that technic catalog looks interesting too. i have the catalogs for the next several years but not that one. quote this is the model at step five. the piston is already attached. imagine this state on step 5 in modern sets. back then lego had challenging instructions, not the step madness like today the most extreme example of this was the engine step in the 8865 set, which uses over 120 pieces by itself.
name: electric passenger train set no.: 7725 theme: lego / system / trains / 12v / train set year: 1981 pieces: 485 minifigs: 1 price: usd 70.00$ (which equals about eur 50€ and gbp 40£) introduction: our most favorite theme is 12v trains. actually i got my first 77-series back in 1981 (5th of december, i was 2,5 years old) just a week before my brother was born. some years later i got the 7740. after our dark ages we (my brother, cousin and myself) got all 12v trains at least once. this 7725 was gathering dust in my brothers' room. the train in all its splendor. as you can see it doesn't occur at the back of the 12v era train instructions although its larger brother the 7740 does. some investigation learned that all the sets at the back of the instructions date from 1980 so the 7725 wasn't released yet. here you can see the front of the 7725 with the driver in the cockpit. the driver is in fact the only minifig that was included in the set. as you can see, our version of the train has a different front than the one in the instructions. apparently the former owner used 7861 (lighting set (12 v)) to upgrade the train with working back- and frontlights. i like the original lights but didn't notice that the train had those double lights until i did the review. maybe we will give the train again it's original signs and put custom leds in it or so so that the train can drive into two directions with accurately working lights. another thing about the lights that puzzle me are the backlights. while typing this i realise that the former owner might have added those, so let's have a look at the instructions then. as it turns out, the lights are there also in the instructions. i recently learned that only the last car or coach of a train has it's red lights on. so unless the train drives with only the front car it will never use those red backlights. here you can see the cockpit with the engineer. the cables don't look very pretty but well, the train at least has working light. here you can take a look at the inside of the engine car. while the 7745 has a nice 'fake engine' there, just the weight bricks and the ugly cables, apart from the engineer and his cockpit, no other nice features here. b.t.w. lego always used tiles in such a trains to make it easier for kids to take off the roof and have access to the minifig passengers etc. here the 'proof' that it is an electric train. the pantograph of the front car. it has the same kind of panthographs that the 7745 has. the middle car has 4 chairs. as you can see, some vandal must have nocked over this one. hope they leave the cables alone. this early morning train seems to have one passenger: a workman. i like the small 2x3 windows from this car very much! they give this care a nice look. also the door in the middle adds something special to the train. as far as i know, no other passenger train has the doors in the middle. here you see the side of the train, just after the train has left brickingham station where the worker, probably from set 6647 (highway repair) that was also released in 1980. a closeup of the last car with steering stand to allow the train to travel back and forth without having to 'make head', in other words: putting the engine in front again. the train, shunted to an end track so it can be cleaned (i think it is apparent that it definitely needs cleaning very badly). this set can be found on: peeron lugnet brickset bricklink entries playability: 5/10 (the train is fine, but with only one minifig not very playable without other sets; also no accessories at all!) design: 7/10 (nice train, the inside could have been a lot better, but i really like to original front lights!) price: 7/10 (the train came with motor so not a bad price, goes now for quite some money at ebay.) overall: 6.5/10 (nice set but the 7745 is a better train i'm sure) well that was it for today. i hope you have enjoyed this review and got tears in your eyes seeing how nice the 12v era was... it never comes back, but maybe lego rereleases some of this sets in the 2009+ train era (very likely that this is just wishful thinking). edited by jopiek, 12 september 2008 - 04:56 pm.
a very nice review, jopiek! you know, i was wondering how lego could justify having two 12v-powered passenger trains at the same time, but after reading the review, and seeing the lack of figures and accessories, i guess i understand why (plus the train is rather compact). oh, and i can't help but think that the chairs in the middle carriage are somewhat oddly placed, because those placed next to the door are unusable because the door takes up room needed for figs' arms. also, it appears that your set also has the newer couplers, i.e. there's no hooks for the decoupling rail to grab hold of. with the light assembly it really won't matter, play-wise, or if you don't have any decouplers, but it's still a bit of a bummer.
jopiek, on sep 7 2008, 11:20 pm, said: the chair was just loose so it should be placed on the 2x2 plate that is also visible in the picture of the middle car. that's not the one i was thinking of, it was the other two chairs towards the middle of the wagon that i was thinking of. if you try to seat a minifig in either of them, you'll quickly find that it's impossible, beacuse the door interferes with the figs' required personal space. if you move both of them one stud forward (so that the back of the seat lines up with the edge of the window), it'll solve the problem, and still leave space for a figs to be seated in the other chairs.
nice review. is that one minifig breaking out of prison? (just wondering about his clothing.) the worst thing is the name. anything with xtreme in the title almost deserves the lowest score possible on principle.
it is not very often that i rate a legoset 'poor' (it's the first time actually), but in this case i had no other option. the idea of this set is good, and i like the mostly yellow minifig, but the design of both the airplane (weird 'window'-piece, a propellor that is way too small, minimal skies underneath and a strange colourscheme) and the hangglider (two handlebars on the wings, too many colours) makes the set mark the essence of lego's downfall during those years. i really appreciate the fact that you made a review of this set, brickster, it made me look into the details of 6735, but i am just as sure today as i was back then: i will never buy this. anyway, thanks for the review, the quality of the set may be a disapointment your review certainly is not
thanks for the nice review whitefang! i quite like this set. the front looks a bit bare, but for a small set like this, it doesn't really matter. this set gets a 4 from me as well.
nice review white fang. this really reminds me of an "all-american" set with its red, white, and blue colors (and the white stars). although i really like the fig with its scruffy bearded face, i find the green torso a bit odd for this set. i suppose i would expect some sort of red/blue racer fig with a white/blue racing helmet. swamp sharks - too funny! . you always add a nice addition of humor to your reviews. now i'm going to check out some wonder woman clips on youtube.
what would we do without the trucks of legoland to clean up our town? well, i didn't want to find out, so i bought this set straight away! 7991 recycle truck set info set name: 7991 recycle truck released: 2007 theme: city price: usd 14.99-gbp 12.99-eur 14.95 pieces: 206 minifigs: 1 review time! leading off, the box the front shows the recycle man loading up... the trash can? one thing here is really bizarre. on lego s@h and everywhere else, it says that this set is called recycle truck. which makes sense as it has a recycle logo on the truck. however, on my box, it says the set is called garbage truck has this happened to anyone else? or is it just me... here is the back of the box which shows some of the things you can do with this set. the bags with this set you get 3 bags which are numbered. and do you see what i see? yes, that's right, the dss is in a bag so it doesn't get bent! why tlg doesn't do this more often is beyond me... bag #1 the set comes with a very nice selection of pieces. a large number of these are orange. manual silly me, i forgot to take a picture of the front of the manual. the picture is the same as on the front of the box. the back shows some of the 2007 city sets in a nice little scene. and inside. minifig here is the friendly garbage/recycle man. he looks nice but with the same head as so many other city figs before him. come on tlg! give us some new heads! the sticker sheet the stickers actually are pretty decent as far as stickers go. i like the recycle sign. after bag #1 this is where we stand after the first bag is built. bag # 2 the parts contained in the second bag. more nice orange pieces here. extra parts some nice 1x1 slopes and 1x1 round plates. everything built now that everything is built, let's check it out! the design of the set is very nice and the color scheme looks great. when you see it, you immediately know what it is. the back has a droid arm that acts as a handle to dump the trash/recycling in the truck. it's simple, but works well. here you can see the dumping mechanism. it works by a sliding technic beam with a stopper on top of the truck you can store the worker's cart. this works really well. i think though that the top of the truck overall looks a bit jumbled up with a few too many different colors. the bottom. trash dumping time! this is a good feature of the set. a very well built snot front section. this looks fantastic with the grills and number plate sticker. someone has left a big mess on the street... brickshelf folder ratings! price: 10/10 (for $15 this is a very good deal at 206 pieces) parts: 9/10 (lots of orange) design 9/10 (a very well designed set. especially the front) playability 9/10 (the trash dumper is fun and the added broom and cart make for good play value) build: 8/10 (simple, but stayed interesting) overall:45/50 brickset lego s@h bricklink peeron taking out the trash... summary this is a great small set for the price with fun features, nice colors and good design. i would certainly recommend this set, no matter what it's really called thanks, and happy building!
this is one of those sets that make me really want to start building up a city. it's a great value, has a lot of useful pieces, and is just plain fun to play with. i do miss vehicles having doors though. great review. i was a bit curious as to how the dumping mechanism worked. as well as the sticker count.
nice truck indeed, but the yellow one is better i think, at least if you put them on a roadplate it seems to me that those road plates are too small for that. also it will not empty completely because of that panel. well, for the rest it is a nice set and a fine review!
i own this set and i think it's a really nice truck, but there is two little details that i didn't like : 1/ a recycle truck really needs 2 minifig, one to drive, one to put the garbage on the back. 2/ the big hole behind the driver seat, it was easy to fill it like this : with hole pouf ! no more little hole! but this is really a great set anyway. 4/5 for me ( above average )

thebrickster, on sep 11 2008, 09:21 am, said: what a great set and a very nice review erdbeereis. i think the only improvement to this set would have been the use of chrome exhaust pipes and front grill. i bought this set with a lot of excitement, but unfortunately have not put it together yet. what are your thoughts on these larger 6-stud wide detailed vehicles as opposed to 4-stud wide classics? here's an image of 6668 recycle truck released in 1992: ps. i like the use of "taking out" sponge bob in your review. it's hard to say... i think if the older 4 wide cars and trucks were as well-designed as the new 6 wide ones, i might prefer those.
thanks for the review! this is one of the few city sets that i own (despite loving the theme so much, most of my town is either custom or classic), and it's about as beautiful as a big garbage truck can ever be. quote nice truck indeed, but the yellow one is better i think, at least if you put them on a roadplate it seems to me that those road plates are too small for that. also it will not empty completely because of that panel. well, for the rest it is a nice set and a fine review! well, the truck barely fits onto the old roadplates (not on curves though), so if you put it in a display it probably won't look bad. i think from what i see, this and all the other 6 wide vehicles will fit much better on the newer roadplates, which are four studs wider than the old ones.
hi, i bought this set a while ago, and have since remodeled it into a larger 8 wide truck. now it can hold a driver and passenger. its kind of boxy, i may redesign it in the future.
that looks like one of those big strange recycle trucks from new york city, i like it!

it would be cool if someone made a moc in which hippies steal the truck and cover it with flowers and bright colors and stuff
