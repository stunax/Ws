306 lunar landing plates year released 1979 piece count 2 minifigs 0 list price unknown as part of the classic space collection lego offered two sets of moon plates one was a set of two crater plates and the other this very useful landing plate set not much to review but worth sharing a few images the landing plate and tplate the two plates connect to form this very nice classic space landing platform set 497 galaxy explorer included the landing platform but the one that i had was lighter in color than the one contained in this set at least the yellow circle future lego space sets could benefit by having similar road plates share your thoughts	neutral
these are pretty good but i think they look too much like the standard town roads from that period i like the black space plates from the early 90s better 6710	negative
cp5670 on jul 7 2008 1004 pm said i like the black space plates from the early 90s better 6710 awesome i had not seen these before they would really make nice plates for a sw death star scene thanks for sharing	positive
first what i liked sooooo much was the cover of these plates with this large picture of a classic space scene i still have a 306 misb just to keep that nice feeling of taking it out of a plastic box and look at it there were different versions of the cover though second the markings of the landing platform changed at some point id have to check it later when im at home think it had something to do with the interupted yellow lines	negative
whitefang on jul 7 2008 1142 pm said actually with only 2 plates i could not do much serious expansion with it instead i merged it with my old city baseplates and used it as a docking station for scientific purposes or restricted facilities that is guarded by the police you make a very good point there ive used these plates to represent restricted areas and even as simple airport runways beyond their space uses i never liked the black plates they were during my dark ages anyway so ive never really seen one up close but i have seen them used in a death star display as suggested and it turned out fairly well	neutral
these plates are great in setting up your space base and giving your ships a place to land my favorite though is the lunar crater plate which i use to death in my comic 	positive
quote oh how i love these plates afew years ago i found a local retail store with about 67 sets of these in their basement warehouse i was given special access to along with many other old space goodies hehe i love the things i have loads and ive used them for multiple space bases and battles along with afew grey crater plates and the large grey plates 15x the size of a normal baseplate you can get quite a monorail layout going sigh i should really clean up and get one set up again so i can take some pictures wow nice you probably have enough to make that scene on the box picture i got one pack off ebay a while ago and have another octagon plate from the blacktron 6988 base im building my carrier moc around one but dont have anything planned for the others these baseplates are still relatively common on ebay for their age i see misb packs on there every few weeks and they tend to sell for around 20 the older kind in the op are much harder to come by edited by cp5670 09 july 2008  1018 pm	neutral
kdog on jul 8 2008 0948 pm said thats the problem the instructions arent anywhere to be found not that ive seen the set does seem to have some rare parts but i doubt 350 worth by looking at the pictures used to display this set ive a sneaky suspicion it did not come with instructions but meant for the pictures to be ideas the whole set was suppose to teach children to use their imagination giving them instructions would somewhat defeat this while trying to figure how to build things from looking at pictures would be a much better educational experience	negative
i also love these plates i build a lot with them eg this  unfortunately they are not available in bley 	neutral
year released 1976 piece count 53 minifigs 2 lego brought out floating boats quite early and in many ways the first were the best ill explain why later this set in particular is interesting as it came out in two versions one that includes the first minifigs and another that included the nonarmless type set 709 the police signs are stickers and are in surprisingly good condition considering the age of the set i am missing one sticker on the front though note the technic bush and axel they are the old type the position of the second figure is not a mistake i think hes supposed to be sitting down the first boats out by lego needed a weighted keel to prevent them keeling over i have tested this i suspect this is because of the density of the old hulls and the flat bottom but i could be wrong it cant be just because of the flat bottom as the new cargo ship doesnt need one the keel in detail the bottom extension is for a motor not included nor made by lego at the time the keel had longer studs even now it holds extra firmly this is why i prefer the old design you can extend or shorten the hulls as you please or even insert other lego in the middle you can easily add wheels or any other piece to the bottom of these hulls i wish they would go back to this idea the 4 hulls were of this concept but were too wide probably so the keel wasnt needed the old minifigs aside from having odd feet and no arms had a normal stud as the neck thus when you turn the head it tends to come off i love this set	negative
great review sinner i own the later version 709 released in 1977 mine no longer has decals though the variations were minimal it looks like your boat is in really good shape considering its 30 years old excellent review	positive
thebrickster on jun 22 2008 0141 am said it looks like your boat is in really good shape considering its 30 years old excellent review i know i got it for a song on ebay most 1970s sets dont seem to be in much demand	neutral

sinner on jul 31 2008 0743 pm said you give a guy a holiday he comes back a comedian its too obvious for my taste words hurt you know	negative
nice review sinner the old sets i donÂ´t know  every old set especially equipped with the old nonmoveable arms minifigs look very odd nowadays i agree with you with the hull shape and its possibility to be extended but every other aspect the lack of detail the keel itself you canÂ´t float it in shallow water keeps me from rating it higher than 310 in my opninion the best police boat so far is 4021 click to enlarge	negative
i love those minifigs theyd go for alot on ebay i bet great boat as well i love the old hull design	positive
this set showed what potential variations on the standard brick had back then i think that tlg was still finding its legs back then and learning new things so this is a solid set for the year it was released nice review sinner	positive
lol i cant help but smile everytime i see the quote on this thread dont worry these police are armless lol	negative
well what to say i got this boat late 70s when we were on our way to italy to spend the holidays there my parents always needed to keep my quiet during the 3day trip and the best way to do that was to buy me a lego set i got this one in a gas station in germany as far as i remember italy didnt have lego sets so a gas station close to the italian border but still in germany or austria was very often their last chance i often saw large quantities of lego sets in those gas stations though i remember seeing yellow castle and the galaxy explorer standing on a shelf it would be my birthday 13 weeks later so i always made sure they knew what to buy for me	positive

so youve been bitten by the classic bug too sinner great review but one would think arms would come in handy pun intended when you are a police officer right its a shame that many of the original figs must now be forced to stand looking like they have their hands in their pockets eh i have no idea where i was going with that last sentence	neutral
as you may have seen in my topic in general lego discussion i received a bunch of old lego from my stepgrandmotherinlaw among the bricks were instructions and pieces for an almost complete set 345 from 1969 i was very excited to find this out so i put it together i recently took it apart and reassembled it taking photographs along the way for the sake of eurobricks so without further ado set 345 house with car first off is the car this was still constructed in the bucket of bricks i received so i never took it apart next ill show you the instructions lots of added bricks per step which was fun however the angle of the instructions sometimes made it difficult to find where things were supposed to go the inbuild shots finally an allaround view of the finished set sadly i dont have much time to post more pictures or thoughts however ill try to come back and update the review later this week until then enjoy	positive
great review i never had this set but it looks nice i really like the checker pattern near the big window	positive
great review mariko this set is way before my time too i like how lego used to create simple one story houses instead of the really tall house that we see in todays town theme such as 8403 city house one story houses such as 345 just look more realistic to my eyes the simplistic minimalism vibe that i get with this set is something that is hard to find in todays much more detailed sets although trust me i love love love todays detailed sets  the brick is epic	positive
image link from brickset i thought i would do a pic review of the 1st lego castle the yellow castle 375 released in 1978 first let me say that this set was truly ahead of its time it introduced new building concepts such as the hinge and new figs most were still the armless faceless minifigs during this time this set introduced me to castle which was my first real favorite theme i enjoyed breaking it out from the garage and building it again the majority of the pieces are 1x1 1x2 1x3 1x4 1x6 and 1x8 standard yellow bricks the set also includes yellow 1x4 1x6x2 and 1x8x2 arches yellow 2x2 2x3 and 2x4 bricks various grey plates 1x2 black inverted slopes red drawbridge pieces two classic red castle doors 8 hinges 2 for each corner and a few other nifty pieces including six red 1x1 windows a complete inventory is available at peeron 375 inventory a view from the front the drawbridge is 6x8 the front tower stands 12 13 bricks high plenty of room for horses the drawbridge does work the string originally black is attached to the opposite side between a plate and the arches the right side of the castle identical to the left ive always loved the 2x2x3 sloped bricks and corner pieces the back i love these red doors a 1x4 brick attached to the other side of the baseplate keeps intruders out that banner was the original sticker piece notice the wear the rear tower largest of the towers and backside two hinges at each of the corners allow the corners to open for playability before opening open lots of arches add to the detail of the inner walls inner front this set included 14 figs how about that for quantity unfortunately i peeled off worn stickers from the shields and the breast plates years ago the blue castle guards and knights are the keepers of the castle i still think that these helmets are the best lego ever made they just look good the black and white knights and the red knights ive always prefered to use the black and red guards and flags from the knights joust sets conclusion the yellow castle is truly a classic set and im so glad i kept the pieces to this together after all these years if you have a chance to buy one or even obtain the set instructions its worth building and wouldnt be difficult to substitute grey or other colors i hope you enjoyed this review and feel free to share your comments	positive
theres two alternates on the back of the instructions and as i recall some sort of bridge on the inner fold or back of box i threw away the box to this set years ago just lucky to still have all the pieces with standard pieces you can build all these alternates and many more thats why i dont particularly care for the new castles like vladeks they make building so difficult and duplicate pieces are so limited heres an old shot of the castle in the city that it use to guard we played for hours back in these days	neutral
yup that is very very nicei wish i had been alive back then d well ill never have a chance to own something like this so this is as close ill get to it thanks for showing me the greatness	positive
snefroe1 on dec 28 2005 0844 am said nice review i havent built yellow castle for many years but i do remember the fun i had building it when i was young yellow castle just opened up an entire new world for me also i liked all the alternate models on the box od wish i still had that i found this pic of the inner box this evening in searching for sticker sheets with castles like this one could build a variety of mocs	neutral
kimt on dec 28 2005 0252 pm said toothbrush and mild soap  and lots of time gently scrubbing a cleaning and great review  i love that set wub wub im sorry that you seem to miss the stickers  if you find somewhere to download printable copies of them please let me know satis kimt thanks for the tip i tried it on a few pieces and they look much better unfortunately it does take a lot of time i need a lego cleaning machine with this many pieces	positive

imperialjohn on dec 29 2005 0511 pm said ive tried this once remember normal white sticker sheet in an ink jet and the transparent plastic on top  ps the one on the right is the homemade one so youre using two layers stickers doesnt that make it very thick	neutral
heres a shot of a custom forestman these really work well im using just regular sticker paper how do you stick transparent plastic on top	neutral
i guess its easiest to put the entire shield on a transparent sticker and cut the edges i would also do that with the white stickers because now you can still see the gray edges of the shield perhaps you can make a bigger black or brown in the other case outline you also wouldnt be able to see if the sticker is exactly in the middle	neutral

luxorv this is a well written presentation on this lego vintage review i never knew the existence of this set and even though the design is not part of the modern lego design concept but the overall appeal back in the 1970s certainly appeal to many i could not mind to own such vintage lego model and put them on display and potray as if it was a chart of evolution of lego motorbikes thanks for sharing and i cant wait to find out your next review	positive

theme hobby sets set name thatcher perkins locomotive set number 396 price new 369450  258314 euro price used 100355  45250 euro pieces 434 year of release 1976 links peeron bricklink and brickset my father assures me this is the very first lego set i ever got in facts he gave it to me as a present for my first half year of course that is to say he bought it for himself and used me as the official excuse when i grew up at first i found it to be quite boring no minifigures limited play features in the end it was just a locomotive it soon went to forgottenland then when i was about 10 years old i one day found again the instructionsâ€™ â€˜bookletâ€™ and saw this bright coloured big steam engine and i suddenly wanted to build it again it would seem i finally got to the right age at least for me to appreciate the design of this great set but enough about memories letâ€™s start with the review the box front the front of the box here cut and folded to save space shows the thatcher perkins locomotive in all its glory upon a nice countryside landscape i really appreciate how tlg box designers used a real life environment made of sand gravel and pebbles to give this hobby set a better background moreover the landscape does not distract the eye since the focus is strongly set on the locomotive itself the box measures about 395 x 245 x 55 centimetres or 1556 x 965 x 217 inches this is more or less the size of the 4840  the burrow or the advent calendars back and sides the back of the box shows the model on a more neutral background and from another angle we can see the stickers in place take a good look at them here because i did not apply them the right side we also see a pic of the set from the 34 back and one with a child playing with it in this latter shot the model rests upon a nice black box with a thatcher perkins sign on it unlike the harley davidson 1000cc set the thatcher perkins does not have the sign â€˜designed for experienced lego buildersâ€™ for some reason contents inside this set includes a large number of parts mainly black blue and red with some nice yellow to lighten it up more parts of interest the partsâ€™ selection is not exceptional but weâ€™ll see this set includes some unique pieces which have not been in lego sets for long years since the 1980s like the very nice black plate modified 1 x 2 with steam engine cylinder flat surfaces black train wheel spoked for motor and the red train steam drive rod holder  train steam drive rod group the wheel spoked large as beautiful as they were saw the light from the production line for the last time in 1976 the only new mold used in this set is the black and blue slope inverted 45 2 x 2 old type with round bottom tube as you can see in the above picture this locomotive was designed to work well be played with on all kind of surfaces so the wheels sport tyres in this picture you can see how they look without the tyres of course builders can use the thatcher perkins on their brickbuilt tracks another group of interesting parts are shown in this pic red wheel spoked 2 x 2 with stud and tyre black brick modified 2 x 4 with wheels holder old clear bottom and yellow minifig head plain  stud solid many newer fans will not be familiar with the last two parts they were standard fare in a number of sets between the 1960s and early 1990s but then unfortunately they were taken out of production to be fair the replacement of the black brick modified 2 x 4 with wheels holder old clear bottom with the standard technic parts was probably due to the fact that the metal pin used to connect the wheels to these bricks had a shameful tendency at getting off the wheel too bad it could not be fixed and these parts kept in production for those interested here is a picture of the dss courtesy of peeron instructions cover â€“ as usual the instructions are not organised in the form of a booklet but they consist of a folded double printed sheet the â€˜coverâ€™ shows again the same shot as the front of the box â€˜back coverâ€™ â€“ here we see the name of the set and some additional information like the year when the first thatcher perkins started working 1863 and the type 460 of this locomotive which as shown in the image is related to the number and position of the wheels on a side note the pencil signs on the sides of the sheet were made by my father while counting the parts in the set â€˜random pageâ€™ â€“ as expected no callouts here but the build is pretty straight forward and does not need them the colours are easy to tell apart full page â€“ as you may have noticed all the building steps are drawn on one side of the â€˜bookletâ€™ making it more properly an instructionsâ€™ sheet what really makes this â€˜instruction bookletâ€™ stand out in my eyes is the fact that it is indeed a poster the building steps are all on one side while the other is a bigger image of the completed set with the name thatcher perkins in yellow enclosed in an old styled red tag building start the build starts with the base of the locomotive putting the 10 wheels in place and strengthening the engine notice the use of this â€˜illegalâ€™ technique to build the bumpers lego as we all know can be a tricky medium to build with and some details need special solutions to be completed we then start building the boiler and cabin going up fast and steady in the penultimate step we build the chimney and cow catcher iâ€™d like to spend a few more words on the chimney and how it is attached to the main body as you can see in the left picture the 3x3 base of the chimney is asymmetrical with a 3x2 base on one side and a combination of a 1x2 and a 1x1 plates on the other in the right picture you see the top of the main body where the chimney will be attached it is made of a 1x2 base and 1 1x2 tile using another â€˜illegalâ€™ technique or at least one lego designers do not like much nowadays the holes of the 3x2 plate of the chimney will connect with the studs of the 1x2 plate on the main body giving a well centred and quite sturdy build finished set front the front of the model sports 3 big headlights a nice cow catcher and the nicely detailed engine front i can almost hear it whistle side and here it is our good old thatcher perkins locomotive indeed it looks like a classic and powerful engine form one of those spaghetti western films doesnâ€™t it what i found strange in the beginning is the choice of colours i was convinced steam engines were all black at the time then i checked some pictures of the original and i must admit the resemblance is almost perfect back the back side is less detailed than the front with cabin almost devoid of details i think lego could have done a better job on it 34 front and â€¦ just see how good it looks from this angle with all the tubing moving parts and the lovely 3 headlights â€¦ 34 back the back view is not as impressive but grants us a good look at the big posterior wheels and the bumpers bonus images size comparison as i stated elsewhere i never understood what scale these hobby sets are meant to be they are clearly not minifigscale and they are not technicfigscale either but they are not even miniland scale moreover they use different scales between locomotives cars and motorbikes amongst the hobby set line as i said before the set comes with tyres on the wheels to allow a wider playing experience not limiting this model to tracks nonetheless builders can assemble their own track maybe using the vintage blue 45v tracks and make the thatcher perkins run its proper environment final comments overall this is a great set for collectors of old models and steam engines fans or both it does not sport a huge variety of bricks but was a good choice at the time and even if the result is matteroffact a bit blocky when compared to the original it implements some good solutions to minimise the lego brick appearance and maximise the similarity as much as possible design  colour scheme â€“ 810 the design is as accurate as possible and the colours are completely in line for the thatcher perkins locomotive the solutions and details included in this set justify the â€˜expert buildersâ€™ label and add to the appearance and why not playability of the model though i still wish tlg had included more details in the cabin parts  1010 quite a big selection but only one new mould nonetheless a good source of black blue and red standard parts for mocs and one of the few sources for the extra rare black plate modified 1 x 2 with steam engine cylinder flat surfaces black train wheel spoked for motor red train steam drive rod holder  train steam drive rod group and wheel spoked large playability  910 a sturdy model which can take some serious play and swooshing without falling apart the somewhat easily detachable chimney and the lack of an appropriate scale interaction with most other models make it lose one point though build  710 pretty straight forward with few nice solutions price  510 like most older models especially the hobby set and model team ones this set can only rarely be found at reasonable prices most of the times people are asked shameful prices for such a smallish set overall 810 very good more pictures can be found in this brickshelf gallery as always questions comments and pic requests welcome edited by rufus 10 july 2011  0705 pm

indexed 410 â€“ payloader theme legolandvehicle piece count 28 year released 1973 msrp  links brickset lugnet peeron bricklink note this set was released under the number 604 outside of the us ah classic legoland a time before minifigs ever existed and cars and buildings could be made with just a few bricks the part selection was pretty basic bricks plates slopes windows and wheels were all you needed to construct an entire town heavy machinery could be modeled in 4wide and be just a few bricks tall for this review we will be taking a look at the 410 payloader one of legoâ€™s first sets of a bucket loader so grab a hard hat we are heading to the construction yard box image courtesy of bricklink box contents here we have our instructions which are obviously the older style of lego instructions the steps used much simpler imagery but they get the job done they show how to build the payloader in seven steps this small set has all of 28 parts in it the more interesting parts of note are the red digger arm the bucket the blue 1x2 brick with arm holes and the blue 2x2 brick with the classic lego logo printed on it construction in the first few steps we start building up the base then add the arms and start building the cab add the bucket the trailer socket and finish the cab throw on some wheels completed set and with that we are finished with our nice small model here is the back right side notice how the back of the cab was left with an empty spot here is the left side notice how on the top of the arm they made it so you could just push down on the tips it to make the arm lift instead of having to grab by the arm itself on the front we have the nice lego logo shown to remind the forgetful of what they were playing with you can also see how much space is in the bucket itself which cant hold more than a few small plates finally on the back we have the trailer socket this was a nice addition to make it able to tow trailers from other sets like 685 just donâ€™t try to bring it into your layout populated by minifigs they may have a problem trying to get in other thoughts considering this set is nearly 37 years old i myself am still surprised by how well the bricks have held up i purchased this set from a thrift store a year ago for a mere 25 cents normally when used lego is purchased you can expect to see scratches marks wearing discoloration etc but boy was i surprised to see how all these parts are in mint condition even the instructions still looked like they came from a new box and not all ripped up and tattered the pieces still connect to each other nice and tight and the metal pieces for the wheels havent rusted this just shows that with proper care these things can last a lifetime i really would like to get a small display case to show it off conclusion playability 810 in addition to the standard of having rolling wheels you also get a fully movable bucket assembly with it you can pick up smaller pieces and unload them into a dump truck design 710 like all other legoland vehicles it has a very basic design but you can still easily identify what it is simple yet effective parts 710 like most other older lego sets all you really get are a few basic bricks and plates however you do get a bucket assembly and the 2x2 brick with the classic lego logo on it is very cool it was also nice of lego to include the trailer socket so you could tow around your trailers price 810 bricklinks history shows them to sell for around 10 usd used while that is a bit much for a set this size it is pretty good considering this set is over 37 years old however if you are looking for a new boxed set be prepared to fork over about 50 usd overall 810 this small machine would make a nice addition to your collection as a reminder of legos past so what are your thoughts on this classic set edited by thebrickster 01 june 2010  0555 am	positive
thank you very much for this wonderful review this is the oldest lego set in my collection i received this model from my grand parents many years ago  im not exactly sure who in my family it used to belong to but it has a home with me now its a very simple but attractive looking vehicle and functions pretty well too overall very nice	positive
thanks for the great nostalgic review great pictures i love the shiny glow of 37 year old bricks sets were simpler back then but not less exciting in their own way i wasnt even born in 1973 but one of my first sets was the 1982 update of this 6630 bucket loader almost 10 years later but the very same bucket assembly only the colours have changed	positive
nice review great nostalgic set like you said it has nice designsimple yet effective i like construction vehicles so this set has even bigger impact on me	positive
ah the good old daysthanks for the review yoshi648  cute and cool at the same time its interesting to see that the same front end parts had been used from the early 70s up in to the late 90s  nice again to step back in time and keep on bricking everyone 	positive
i voted outstanding regarding this set i found mine at a consignment store it was inside of a larger set from the same time period	positive
woah 25 cents for a mint condition set thats amazing	neutral
well its not exactly a large shuttle but still a nice set 442 space shuttle year released 1979 piece count 79 minifigs 1 vehicles 0 list price unknown this little classic was my smallest classic space set believe it or not i still have the box heres the back the instructions are pretty tattered and missing a section i had to download some from the web but the ship is again intact missing only one grey 1x3 plate ive always liked this computer piece heres the under side this set included the small classic jet engines a closeup of the sloped printed space brick and the complete set with minifig this set was a great little space ship that made a nice addition to the blue space theme as small as it was it could hold twothree figs one standing up i dont even think the mars mission recon drop ship holds three figs in any case it was a musthave for blue space fans and probably only a few bucks back in the day swoosh	neutral
its simply amazing how far lego has come in 30 years	positive
and again those tears in my eyes with original box i really love those classic space stuff looks like i need to clean my stuff this summer	positive
this classic space shuttle is simply superb i love the layout of this shuttle in fact it reminded me as one of the space fighter jet that roam around in space defending the boundaries from intruders i just love these old grey bricks very much and the printed computer brick is just lovely its such a pity that i did not grow up with classic space in my childhood these are actually great stuff and formed the base of the space theme in lego brickster thanks again for another outstanding classic review	positive
this was my first space set ever 1979 1980 dont know anymore but i do remember i got this together with 897 for my birthday when we where camping with a little luck i may even have an old film from my dad opening the boxes well what to say it looked soooooo aggressive with those two engines but i never knew why you needed two steering wheels on it they probably just thought a symmetrical model was better  i cant blame them what a nice set it would even sell today no doubt looooots of swooshability	positive
the computer is my favorite part sadly i dont own any classic spaceexept for some space police and a blue classic space man	positive
nice 442 is the lowest set number i have seen for any classic space set so it must been released with the first wave in 1978 its remarkable that a lego spaceship this old and small can seat more figs than the much bigger mx71 recon dropship of today anyway i just want to grab it out of the screen and swoosh it all over the place lol tlg please make these classic space sets again i promise ill buy many	positive
indexed everyone remembers their first time for me it was in 19coughsomethingsomethingcough we were at her house and her mother was gone for at least an hour she slowly unzi uhhh sorry wrong story um yeahh anyway i do remember my first time it was 1977 in late summer our neighbor who worked for a department store called famousbahr said that the main store had a travelling lego display so my family filed into the car and drove into downtown st louis to see this display to tell you the truth i dont remember much about the display itself but i do remember that my parents bought me my first lego set set  456 the spirit of st louis set  456 also sold as set  661 name spirit of st louis theme legoland  large vehicle year 1977 pieces 49 minifigs 0 price 500 usd bricklink misb start  17500 usd used complete 3500 usd links peeron bricklink brickset packaging box front the original box that my set came in was most likely trashed 5 minutes after returning home this image was lovingly stolen off of the peeron page for this set i feel lucky that i even got this much similarly i have no pictures of the plastic baggies the set came in truth be told i cant be sure that there even were plastic baggies that the parts came in the set side view well there she is my first set ever  actually i seem to recall the real spirit of st louis was silver colored not black and yellow if you need a history lesson the spirit of st louis was charles lindberghs plane when he made the first transatlantic solo flight more details can be found on the wikipedia page the overall shape is pretty close at least the cockpit window could stand to be moved forward one stud but everything seems to be relatively close the tail piece isnt the right shape but it is likely the only tail piece lego produced at the time if you look closely you can see the various bite marks that my brother and i inflicted over the years i know some people would be aghast that there are bite marks but brick separators wouldnt come out for another 10 years besides we were young we didnt know any better i certainly had no idea that it would become my obsession there are some interesting part choices here everything is brick and plate built as you might expect the same set nowadays would have lots of slope wedges and wedge plates to round things out but lego was all about the brick in 77 so bricks are what we got the black inverted slopes worked pretty well asthetically as the wing struts the wings are simple 4 x 10 plates nice and square there were no minifigs in this set if i remember correctly 1977 was just about the time when minifigs made their first appearance i know i have one other set from 77 that does include a minifg at least i dont have a lot of comments for the following photos ill let the pictures speak for themselves 34 view back back 34 top front parts interesting pieces i have no idea if there were any extra pieces that came with this set i kind of doubt it instead i took a photo of some of the interesting parts to the model that translucent white piece didnt photograph so well but it is a technic axle 8 thats right sets from 1977 contained technic elements the two black parts are the forerunners to the 1 x 2 technic brick as well everytime i hear someone on the forums complain about technic elements in system sets i think back to this set the round brick is special as well here is a closer view of it complete with bite marks  round brick as you can see the stud is closed it is only one of two closed stud 1 x 1 round bricks that i own they stopped appearing in sets in 1981 for those that are interested the dss you thought you were going to escape this heading didnt you surprise yes even in 1977 lego sets had stickers the oldest printed elements i can remember were in the classic space sets that started in 1979 again when people in the forums complain about dss in sets i can only help think of this set and chuckle to myself maniacally the sticker has held up really well considering its been stuck on the brick for 32 years no discoloration very little curling i think if all stickers held up this well over time there would be less dss complaints the ratings playability 610  the set is quite swooshable and the propellor spins outside of that though minifigs na design 610  the overall shape is quite good especially given the era the color choice leaves a lot to be desired price 110  its been retired for 30 years its going to cost you to get your hands on it overall 1330  this set is for true collectors only i cant imagine anyone wanting one because they want to play with it it was a great set back in the day but the design feels really dated and if youre wondering mine is not for sale ever all the photos plus more can be found in the gallery	neutral
very brave to give an impression about one of the oldest sets ever reviewed a lot members here are younger than the set itself i think you will have to have grown up with it to like it nowadays we have seen quite a few better airplanes than that one for example this years 7643  but thanks for letting us know btw the 1x1 round brick with the solid stud is no 3062a instead of 3062b with the hollow stud	positive
great review its good to see some of the old sets reviewed i think i learned something about the history of lego from this one	neutral
in 1977 trans or yellow slopes existed already and using them would have made the plane more realistic a third rear wheel would have enhanced playability and design rather than this ugly black round brick its the reason why i voted below average even considering 1977s standards however this set is nice and simple offering good playability	negative
here is the spirit of st louis just go there washington and have a look of this legend  cavannus on jul 15 2009 0940 pm said in 1977 trans or yellow slopes existed already and using them would have made the plane more realistic i dont think so there is no 45Â° slope in the original plane design  and no front cockpit window quote a third rear wheel would have enhanced playability and design rather than this ugly black round brick except that it wouldnt have been the spirit of st louis this set is a great one and i wish id bought it in 77 it is the spirit of the 70ties 	positive
i really like the design it has an aesthetic value lacking from most official lego planes and follows closely to the real thing minus the colours something that cant really be claimed for more recent sets	positive
483 alpha1 rocket base year released 1979 piece count 170 minifigs 3 vehicles 1 two sections list price unknown despite the nuclear nonproliferation treaty of 1968 lego dared design a rocket base complete with a rocket system that may have had nuclear capability in 1979 luckily the rocket was defective having rather flimsy white bricks that did not stay together well during launch attempts lego scrapped its wmd program and the result was this classic blue era space set known as the alpha1 rocket base instructions on the backside of the instructions the set is featured with the space command center space cruiser and a few vehicle sets the set includes three figs and this great rocket fuel tanker heres the front section complete with computer and the rocket fuel section the set has some interesting features including the control section fuel control and launch pad on top of the control section is a nicely design radartracking system heres the open control room the launch pad and fuel control the fuel control includes two sink pieces and blue steering wheels and legos wmd weapon of mass destruction the alpha1 on the launch pad heres a shot of the launching mechanism unfortunately i have lost one of the blue sinkfaucet pieces as well as a black hose a closeup of the alpha1 rocket the white bricks never stayed together well often times coming apart within your hands the arming and guidance system was nicely designed a view of the complete set and another this is a great set the base fuel vehicle and launch platform offers a great amount of playability my only complaint is the rocket as mentioned above i dont think i ever played with it a sa kid because it always fell apart share your comments regarding this classic space set	positive
thebrickster on jul 4 2008 0414 am said a closeup of the alpha1 rocket the white bricks never stayed together well often times coming apart within your hands huh did they not think of putting a technic axle down the center of the rocket come to think of it when were technic axles invented its a neat little set makes me think i oughta make some similar kinda layout in ldd very elegant for playability	neutral
i always thought that that grey thing on top of the rocket was some kind of satelite xenologer on jul 4 2008 0525 am said huh did they not think of putting a technic axle down the center of the rocket come to think of it when were technic axles invented i had this set as a kid and i dont think there was a technic axle inside that rocket but if i remember correctly some of the later cs rockets did	neutral
wooow what a set not all that large most defenitely not as sophisticated as the message intercept base from 10 years later but in those this was all a kid need to have hours of fun soooo many great parts on this one technic hoses computers rocket parts trans yellow parts the perfect outpst really it was actually my sister who got this one but it only took an hour before i claimed it edited by snefroe 14 july 2008  1236 pm	positive
oh did i drool over this set as a kid since i never got it i didnt know how bad the rocket really was great review xenologer on jul 4 2008 1225 pm said come to think of it when were technic axles invented the white ones were	positive
ahh the good old days thanks for the review	positive
thanks for the great review sweet now that ive seen the set im afraid im a bit disappointed 8 1 the color combination doesnt really do it for me blue dark blue grey black tan white theyre all mixed together without any over all design 2 is there any interior it doesnt look like it and in any case you can only reach it if you remove the modules hm  now it looks too much of a box 3 there are most certainly some nice ideas in this model and some great parts the best part of the model is the staircase 4 i dont think he spent much time in thinking about the design as apo said the chimneys on top of a garage is kinda weird theres also a gate next to another gate which is weird as well also if this is supposed to ba a grocery then the owner has done a lot to hide it the croissant is nice but next to the brown box with vegies theres nothing that suggests this is a shop 5 the white lamp and the the yellow cylinder are at the same level of the tiles imo it should be above the level of the tiles 6 imo not worth the 90 euro edited by snefroe1 20 june 2007  0903 am	negative
thank you legocastlegirls for your quick review y its the first time i realize the back of the market street the tan bricks are a replacement for some windows id guess i do love that building especially the top floor with the neat balcony wub of course you are again left alone filling the interior but i just had some food parts ordered at bricklink xd one thing id like to know this is an onlineexclusive right can i order it at a legostore kln  oberhausen and get the sum rewarded on my voucher booklet sweet i heard it here but im not sure 8 if anyone is looking for how to fill it with interior go read the latest brickjournal 8 theres a whole chapter written about designing the rooms interior on	positive
thanks for the pics legocastlegirl one thing that i find strange is that tlc doesnt use a female mf head for those two females mf in this set but a female mf head is available in ldd and pab wacko	negative
thank you very much for that nice review and those lovely pictures legocastlegirl y a very interesting set with a great color scheme and some sunny side feeling indeed sweet	positive
legocastlegirl on jun 20 2007 0742 am said i know its not such a nice review like yoda did the last times but i hope you enjoy some of the pics nonsense sandra  tks for sharing these cool pics  its also a nice hommage to erik brok i really like this set i think its really well designed with great ideas such as the dual stairs the balconies the croissant insignia the market entrance design with the horns whip and owl 8 i like the color combination and the mosaic design just in front of the entrance the only terrible flaw is that yellow cinlinder  that is just awful for a flower pot x i dont mind at all having that lamp post at the same level since it would be normal to have the base of the lamp at the level of the tile but i agree that is just pickering about an insignificant detail p legocastlegirl on jun 20 2007 0742 am said a funny idea is the salad in the one box at the front i think normally its a hairpiece of an exoforce fig yeay that is just brilliant all the way 8 this is a great set indeed and a must have for town fans  yoda	positive

i also missed your review but now that i found it i really happy i just ordered the set  thanks for the pics peter	positive
legocastlegirl on jun 20 2007 0520 pm said i also think that this is a replacement for some windows and i like this idea because i often see houses with that kind of windows there was once windowtaxes in the netherlands when rich people became poor they placed bricks in their window so they paid less taxes some older houses still has walls were once were windows historic information on d p	positive

well now that i have some money a trip to toysrus was obviously in my future especially since my local tru has much of the summer 2007 lineup when i got there almost all the smaller castle sets had been sold out but there was one left the one i am now reviewing for both eurobricks and bzpower  the box well for starters the castle theme boxes are beautiful the blended clear and stormy skies give a great clash of the titans effect and the action poses help as well  the back is equally nice featuring a photo showing kids how to use the crossbow and the brave axe wielder taking a swipe at the skeleton foolish soldier that wont work on skellies see later on in the review to find out why and of course we have a small box with the link to the official lego website where tlc can advertise even more lego sets p the contents after opening the box a single bag of pieces with a couple loose ones the instruction manual and necessary catalog  p  and a new wider rubber band holder spilt out the instruction manual is clear as a bell no color trouble here folks also its worth mentioning the nice background with the mountain and kings castle silhouettes  sorry that theres no picture but ill take one if someone wants to see it  the pieces for being a 5 dollar set well seven in my case darn your above average prices tru crossbow attack features a lot of nice pieces as does the entire castle lineup notable elements include two large brown spoked wheels two brown modified 1x1s a pearl gold slope end and six dark blue modified 1x1x23 slopes the bulk of the pieces however are nothing special ill let the picture do the talking for this the accessories are by far the best parts in this kit two different helmets in a beautiful shiny silver are my favorite but i also really like the scythe looks good for mocing and the round shield  wub  which are both brand new parts and can anyone not love the classic axe and crossbows oh and theres a black lightsaber too but thats rather boring compared to the other parts p the minifigures can you say four figures including the horse that has to be a record for a regular 5 dollar set at least in the present age of limited figures per set well start out with the two crown militia a regular soldier and an archer both have old faces but they look spiffy with the shiny helmets and the superb torsos ill name the soldier bravo the stout and the archer angler the precise for future references now we come to the skellie although some people dislike the new skeleton design i personally prefer it to the old ones since the arms are now poseable and the face much meaner the only problem is that the arms hang too low but its not too noticeable when they have weapons in their hands and last but not least heres the elusive skeleton horse i for one am very happy that tlc took advantage of that awesome prototype piece and made it into an official massproduction mold however the horse is unfortunately one piece but since regular lego horses are as well i dont have a problem with it i do have a problem with the pose however the legs are in quite an odd position and i wonder why tlc didnt make the front and back leg poses symmetrical ah well the finished set i have only two pictures here since this set is so small first heres the completed crossbow i must say finally no more ridiculous horse mounted catapults or crazy fire wheel launchers now we have realistic siege weapons including the one included with 7090 plus it actually launches okay although not the best heres the other main attraction the completed skeleton rider and horse i think its rather dramatic with that pose and the dark background dont you think  playability okay so theres not much in this set but a bit of imagination brings plenty of possibilities to show you what you can do heres a little story made only with this set  overall rating presentation 910 pieces 810 minifigures 910 finished model 810 playability 810  final score 8410 crossbow attack is a fine introduction into castle so i recommend it to any lego fan whether they are a castle nut or just want a cheap change of pace tlc has a knack with making great small kits these days and i more than ever support them in their amazing rebound from their dark ages between 1997 and 2004  edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0133 pm	positive
thanks for this review and that great little comic about the skellies though xd you have to admit that besides their long arms making the skellie legs look out of proportion that theyre just made poorly theyre sticking straight out as opposed to every other fig which have a slight bend to make them look more natural also as im sure youve noticed the pegs are on angles that makes it impossible for them to hold their weapons straight and they cant even put their arms over their heads without stressing the plastic some i mean theyre dead well at least undead theyre not supposed to be stiff and personally i like the ragdoll look more it makes them seem more dead p	negative

thanks for the review that set is high up on my list how could it not be with a price like that i love the added story	positive
nice review and great little story d y look at the normal horses their legs are positioned like that too only the skellie horses legs are touching so as to strengthen the middle otherwise it could easily snap in half also i think the new skeletons are nice their head is awesome i just dont see why tlc couldnt make the bent droid arms with the hand facing vertically instead of making a new arm design completely straight	positive
nice review and a great story also grevious this is a great set and a nice little army builder one at that the only thing that saddens me about the line itself is the new arms on the skelies they just look far to big when placed next to a normal fig for me the old versions of the skelies were far better why tlc changed to this is beyond me still i shall be buying alot of these sets just to increase my army	positive
tks a lot grevious for this  regarding the set i just love it  i really oved your comic it was really well done and hilarious xd eb spirit on  vader on jul 2 2007 0828 am said still i shall be buying alot of these sets just to increase my army you dont say mate i bought like 10 or so so far xd medieval yoda	positive

got this baby via shophome a little early and i though it was time to post my view of this set  snefroe you need to get this one   sorry for the lack of pics but there are already many pics online of this baby so here it is  best space set since a way too long time this is my first new space themed set since more than 20 years and i must say that i’m not disappointed at all i have much to say about this little gem first let’s cut it straight about the martians minifigures they are absolutely rubbish i can’t imagine how lego could produce such atrocity this said let’s move on to the dropship a real piece of art reminiscent of the aliens movie dropship the cockpit is spacious and provides a great field of view too bad there is no hinges to open it you must remove the canopy completely to switch pilot the drilling unit can be attached under the ship with the clever use of a rubber piece it stays well in place once attached good point some people don’t like the inclusion of the 2 containment area for the martians and crystal on both side of the ship but i kind like it it makes the ship less empty the 2 wings are complete with air intake some armaments and 1 standard launcher on the right wing normally i don’t like launchers but this one is very discrete and well integrated on the tail section are 2 thrusters that can be rotated and provide thus some “realistic” movements to the ship one of the last highlight of this ship is the landing gears or i must say landing dishes 6 medium sized radar dishes provide and incredible stability to the set they are quite sturdy and can take a beating i’m not going to review the alien spaceship in detail since it’s quite uninteresting i consider it more like a bonus addition to the set than anything else the look is passable and there are some interesting building techniques in it that’s all to end the review a little proscons table we all love proscons table   pros  incredible design  at last a decent space set  modular functions  quite sturdy  beautiful  great value for money cons  martians are rubbish  no hinges for the canopy  the drilling unit could use some more details score 910 by the way  i added a nice cool feature on my site  you can download the stickers for some sets that i own before building i always scan the stickers we never know it could come handy check this out on my site you need to go in the lego lists on the left vtx classic games	positive
ive got it also but i think ill replace the ball joint pieces with the kind of pieces that give the wings their angle	neutral
i like the dropship kit and got this now that i built it i see so many things i can do to tweak it to make it a moc i think this is a set everyone mm fan should get	positive
nice review	positive
the dropships looks neat and your review is good it isnt my theme but it clearly is a fantastic set for the space lovers under us mars mission is really a good step in the right direction for tlc	positive
of course right before i post this i see that ickelpete reviewed this set earlier in the week sorry for being redundant but it is already written so here ya go monster dino reviewed by dunamis set 4958 792 pieces 8995 from lego online store build time 35 hours here we go with another offering from the creator line im kind of fond of these sets as they are pretty imaginative and usually have instructions for multiple models i like the reusability of all the pieces and the varied things you can build the box the box that lego shipped this thing in was absolutely huge when i first got this in the mail i thought i had won the lottery and they had shipped the ucs falcon early once i opened the shipping box i was surprised to see an unusually large creator set box the box itself is pretty standard creator type box but this one shows off the power functions prominently on the right side of the box the back of the box shows some of the motorized features as well opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals were back to the reusable cereal box type tab system for those of you who stay up a night wondering about legos next box design inside the box we have a bunch of sealed bags immediately the power brick remote and motors stand out as they are each in individual bags also there are three manuals the manuals the three manuals are 76 76 and 56 pages in length they are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings  piece call outs for each step  parts inventory at the end of the primary model build  page numbers color separation in these manuals were fine for me interestingly the instructions for the primary build took a full manual plus about a quarter of another manual random manual photos parts list ill explain a bit more below but it would have been nice to have some written documentation on all the functions of the motors remote and receiver such as motor load guidelines and specific explanations of all the remote control functions it is severely lacking in this area the pieces obviously the pieces were most interested in are these new motors and wireless remote control note that before you fire this bad boy up you had better byob since this is prominently a european community i had better clarify my acronyms over here across the pond byob usually means bring your own beer in this case it still means bring your own beer im on my second heineken right now but in addition to numerous bottles of beer you will need a total of nine batteries to get through this set i kid you not anyway there are two motors a small and a large each with its own very unique name according to the manual the smaller one is called motor and the larger one is called xl motor very creative indeed the battery box takes six aa batteries and there are two compartments to hold them here is the first that seems pretty normal however the back side of it holds the other three batteries and it seems to be very poorly designed note in the photo above where the bottom battery is placed compare it to the previous photo and you will see the difference i played around with trying to get that bottom battery out and you better pack a lunch or byob because it is no small task why couldnt they make this compartment just like the other side there is a single power cord connector and a three position switch the middle position turns the power off and the other two positions seem to provide the same functionality in either position as far as i can tell perhaps a little blurb in the manual would have been nice to clear things up a bit the remote takes three aaa batteries it is fairly small and lightweight even with the batteries installed it has two thumb controls which could be levers if you insert technic bars or even pins the two controls are color coded and match the plugs on the receiver to control two separate motors in addition there is a four position switch which i assume changes the channel finally there are two tiny levers that seem to have no function im not sure if they are a trim control or variable speed control i messed with them and didnt notice any difference in the motor speed again some documentation from the incredibly verbose lego manual would have helped as far as the rest of the parts its really a mixed bag there are a lot of varied parts in this set to the point that there is almost one of everything lots of technic gears pins studded beams studless beams axles wheels etc also lots of little 1x1 slopes in various colors teeth horns etc you cant really say it is a parts pack because there is not enough of one thing to make it a parts pack a couple of notes it seems the quality control issue on the axles has been fixed i initially reported this back when i reviewed the 8285 about a year ago all the axles worked fine for me the color quality control issue is still alive check out the different shade of red in these two parts also included is the sound brick this looks just like the other sound or lightup bricks we have been seeing lately it does have a load dinosaur roar sound embedded in it though so hide the younglings if they are a bit on the skittish side finally ive never seen one of these before although someone will no doubt rattle off a dozen sets where you can find this part in about 5 seconds no i am not referring to the studded beam i put that in the photo for scale the build the build was fun and was fairly straightforward as i mentioned there is a lot of technic parts so if you are not a fan of the technic line you should run not walk away from this one there were no gotchas to speak of but you need to pay careful attention to the placement of the wires that go from the motors to the receiver they kind of sneak them around a bit so watch closely otherwise it was fine here is what is left over so far i have only built the primary model as seen on the box there are instructions for two more models both of the other models seem less complex than the primary model and are likely quicker builds the dino took me about 35 hours which included some time to screw around with the motors im an old school technic fan from way back in the 80s so i had some familiarity with the old technic motors obviously 25 years has improved some things and these seem much more powerful the design if you have built the 4507 prehistoric creatures then some of the design will feel familiar especially the head and tail it is almost like they took the dinosaur from that set and figured out how to motorize it this is not necessarily a bad thing just a comment the set does a good job of showing off the features of the new motors and remote it is nice to see how one motor can perform multiple functions in this case the small motor makes both arms move and opens and closes the mouth of the dinosaur when the mouth is completely open it pushes the activation switch on the sound brick which emits the roar sound pretty cool the xl motor handles the walking feature of the dinosaur there is both forward and reverse forward works really well while the reverse just makes the dinosaur look like he is doing a michael jackson moon walk wow i never thought i would use michael jacksons name in a lego dinosaur set review it is almost like the dinosaur cant get traction going in reverse however as noted previously forward works really well this guy actually gets going at a pretty good clip as you might expect he kind of waddles like a duck since there is no articulation in the knees it is a bit awkward but it works the xl motor seems to kick out plenty of power overall the design seems to be a mixed bag the way the tail is attached seems to be an afterthought the arms look to be too small however the walking mechanism and legsfeet are pretty cool as well as the head and mouth i guess it is a reasonable effort to get people introduced to the parts and well see designs improve as time goes on here are a few views of our new friend but what about the atat of course the real reason you are reading this is that you hope i will have some epiphany on how all this relates to the new walking atat judging from the box on the atat it looks like we get one motor i dont see the remote which is a disappointment as i hope it is not controlled by a switch on the body and you either turn the atat on or off if that is the case the first thing i am doing is scavenging the receiver and remote from this set to add to the atat granted it could be that it comes with a remote but is just not seen on the box also the atat box looks like one of the images shows that the head turns i sure hope this is controlled separately as it would be really lame to not be able to control this independently from the walking feature im kind of skeptical on the walking feature of the atat i suspect it will be rather cumbersome but hopefully i will be pleasantly surprised needless to say this is all speculation but those are my initial thoughts based on this set overall thoughts its an ok set kind of pricy but i suspect a large part of that is due to the motors and remote i havent built the other two models they seem less interesting to me but at least it has some variability also you get a ton of different parts which can either be a good thing or bad thing depending on what you are looking for the dinosaur is average the color selection is marginal black and lime green and the tail section is just lame i appreciate it more for the mechanical functions and how the motorized parts work it does do a good job of waking up my dog who seems pretty irritated by it it is a nice set to show off to the neighbors or the endless caravan of my wifes friends that seem to materialize out of nowhere people are quickly impressed by it and then promptly move along once you start trying to explain how it all works im a bit disappointed that the manual did not explain more about the remote and motor functions i suspect that there is more than meets the eye and ill just have to play around with it to find out it would be nice if lego had a website that showed all the cool functions of the motors and remotes so we fully understand the capabilities final rating 72 build 910 pretty quick and fun the mechanical part is cool functionality 610 it is a creator set so you have multiple builds as far as it being a dinosaur its just ok motorized parts are cool though design 610 partly cloudy some things are cool others are lame parts 810 new motors and remote are cool lots of varied parts included but nothing to write home about price 710 it is kind of expensive edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0623 pm indexed	negative
impressive review really clear photos too thanks dr s	positive
a very nice review thanks dunamis y i really dont understand that color scheme but the new motorsre very interesting well that dino is just mediocre to me i think that the new technic bulldozer is much more interesting	neutral
great review dunamis i hope you have as much fun with this as i have one point yes they are new axles they have appeared in a few sets this year	positive
ickelpete on jul 13 2007 1106 pm said great review dunamis i hope you have as much fun with this as i have one point yes they are new axles they have appeared in a few sets this year yes the kids seem to love it as you pointed out and the wife still thinks i am crazy so its all good i read your review after i posted mine seems like we shared the same thoughts on a majority of it i always think it is good to have multiple opinions on sets as it gives the community more data points to evaluate a given set	positive
tks once again dunamis for a great indepth review  i really look forward to your supped up and moded atat p i am really not found of the design but i think its still a nice parts pack especially with all these nice power function elements  yoda	positive

awesome reveiw thanks i gotta get this one y wub	positive
i kind of like the design of this but more importantly i really want to get my hands on the power functions motors and ir control system id prefer the 8275 technic bulldozer but theres no way i can stretch to the 100 price tag so i was thinking i would have to see if i could get a 4958 monster dino cheap in the january sales then two things happened today firstly i saw the dino in tescos reduced from 70 to 55 then my wife said shed buy it for me for christmas wow thats never happened to me before i love my wife wub cant wait till christmas now	positive

i ended up buying both this and the dozer  i plan on using my dino for a ir car in a month or two	neutral
i ended up buying a misb set recently from a lego collector who is clearing up his collection excellent set to get the ir remote and ir receiver and other motors without paying insane amounts for the bulldozer now there is a quite a number of parts in power miner lime green and 1x1 white teeth plate for the mouth and claws the dino alone has 20 teeth in its mouth the glow in the dark antennas on the backbone of the dino is a nice touch as you can let him walk in the dark somewhat i do agree with the reviewer the box is insanely huge i dont think lego wanted to show a 11 scale dino they just wanted to promote the power function stuff as large as possible also the remote is smaller than shown in the picture as the hand holding it i think is smaller	positive
thanks for the early review i dont know much about the rebals show at all but i can say that the over all design of the walker really appeals to me and the minifigs look top notch i also like how the spring shooters are pretty much hidden in the frame nice job	positive
looks really nice one complaint is the back it is a pitty that lego didnt use any plates greebling there	negative
thanks for the review cannot wait for the 2015 sets	positive
thanks for the review i have two questions  what is the driver standing on when the hatch is open and he is looking out  could you show the face of kallus without helmet please my only complaint is that the colours of both kalluss and the driverss uniforms are wrong kalluss uniform is way too dark and should be more dark olive than black and the driverss uniforms are too bright and should be more greyish compared to what we saw in the series	neutral
whats behind the printed 4x4 dome is that 2x4 yellow plate im planning to replace that	neutral
great first review as a huge walker fan its great to get one thats not a redesign or one of those tiny battlepack vechicles	positive
awesome i am really looking forward to buy this but is it really 5000 us i was hoping more around 3000 also i was wondering how the hip section for the legs work does it have a stiff turning axis to it	positive
smitty500 on 25 december 2014  0721 am said awesome i am really looking forward to buy this but is it really 5000 us i was hoping more around 3000 i mean it fits the 10 cents per piece count and has 4 figures so for a licensed theme you cant beat that but i guess lego can never satisfy everyone	neutral
great set really impressed odd that lego didnt include stickers for the controls  cant think of a reason they wouldnt have and why do only 3 of the 4 figures have leg printing i just cant understand lego at times	neutral
namioik on 25 december 2014  0853 am said i mean it fits the 10 cents per piece count and has 4 figures so for a licensed theme you cant beat that but i guess lego can never satisfy everyone this is true i just had that price in mind when i saw the first images of it it did not appear to be this big or complex but new sets are getting so much more advanced than what they used to be	neutral
i built this set and i think the two rubber pieces holding the both sides of the face is a bit stretched out therefore making the set somewhat tight for entire top hatch to open and close does anyone have the same situation is this right  never mind i got it i built the back a stud too long edited by namioik 29 december 2014  0304 am	neutral
thanks for the early review how tall is this next to the most recent recreation of the atat im picturing the two of them standing next to each other looking silly due to the scale differences	neutral
the legs are about 2 shorter than the atat its cockpit is a little larger than the atats head it doesnt look out of place as an escorttype walker or heavy walker especially as both are built in the same style although if scale differences really bother you the most recent atst is probably a better bet for you edited by hjmediastudios 29 december 2014  0432 pm	neutral
great reveiw shame on lego for forgetting that they already made a atdp pilot helmet ezras from the phantom set that didnt resort to needing a printed head	negative
thanks for the review and pics this is a really nice looking walker one question  how snug are the atdp drivers sitting in their seats the cockpit looks good actually im not crazy about the atdp helmets on the show but i dig the minifigs good stuff awesome facial hair for kallus	neutral

super outstanding review i am outside at this moment and this review is certainly great to read while you are on the move i am looking forward to get this upcoming new modular it is definitely fun to play and real awesome indeed thanks oky for this very fine review	positive
a great review of an obviously fantastic set a musthave for 2015 thanks	positive
fantastic review could easily be the years best and its only january 1st youve got a duplicated picture in the bit where the candy is being moved from the outside and through the barber shop and i was expecting a final bw picture or two where the detective makes his report to the woman in red and gets his reward candy of course or she in turn reports back to her real boyfriend the candy smuggler edited by rollermonkey 01 january 2015  0408 pm	positive
firstly great review  i was really on the fence on this one this review has greatly changed my view on this modular a definite buy for me love the interiors and the whole concept the more i see it the more i see the little features which put this set apart or at least slightly different from the others of course great playability for the younger lot and i think a nice building to give any lego city more character and colour	positive
great review oky i really love your introduction text you put a lot of effort in this review with lots of nice touches well done for me the set gets 4 out of 5 its a great set but theres something preventing me of giving it 5 stars	positive
great review oky i managed to pick this set up a few days ago and i must say it might be my favorite modular yet for the feel alone the pool hall barbershop and the detectives office itself are all wonderfully designed	positive
can you please take some picturesexplain how the water tower is built i understand that there are some tank treads bot how exactly and it is there can be only one edited by yooha 01 january 2015  0714 pm	neutral

nice review thanks a lot managed to improve my opinion of the set a bit but im still getting two to build larger buirldings as soon as we get the next 2x vip points special	neutral
thelazychicken on 01 january 2015  0614 pm said great review the intro was great but im still not convinced on this one the height seems too small for comparison with the rest of the modulars the play features are ok but i wish it would have been taller totally agree with you the height does seem rather small also 2x buildings on a 32x32 baseplate with a lots of spare studs behind the buildings are these buildings 12 studs in width it still looks great style wise however this might be a set i buy and look at it after i have built it  regret the amount of  i have spent on it 239 for us aussies  edited by snaplock 01 january 2015  0742 pm	negative

thanks for the review im a fan of the set but will be modding quite a bit have to get a small bar into the highlander and then turn the secondthird story above the barber shop into a proper apartment the detectives office is great and will stay as is	positive

awesome review okythanks for the cool writing and excellent photographyyour last photo could of had a cry ofyoull never take our candy well he does look mel gibson like  this set is a serious contender for best set for 2015 so much detail must buy one need to brainwash wife into buying me one 	positive
legos affiliation with six wheelers go back a long way i think the first one was released in 1981 more than 25 years ago this year lego added another one to the family mars missions rhino 1 as its title sounds its been a while since ive bought and opened a large box so maybe this isnt a surprise to most of you but the box does not open at the front as with many larger sw boxes but at the side the two printed sealsor whatever people call them have gone as well being replaced by one larger print in the middle of side the box also isnt as thick as a large sw box like the sandcrawler the general size is however still quite large pict0001jpg 28191k 102 downloads the back side shows the mars mission theme sets eccept the rhino i guess it shows this set will be released as a tru exclusive or something only to show up in legoland shops and maybe lego shops its a shame really because this is by far the best set of the theme pict0002jpg 28542k 89 downloads when you open the front cover you see a larger picture picture of the rhino obviously it seems to be some sort of multifunctional truck i think the basic function is to drive around and explore for that it has a drilling device and six giant wheels pict0003jpg 2737k 82 downloads the set comes with two instruction books im afraid to say they did not resolve the grayblack colors issue colorwise the real thing does not look like the instruction book because of it pict0004jpg 30263k 75 downloads the rhino looks really big because of the six giant wheels i guess its more or less the same size as mtrons magnetiser with the big difference between the two being that the wheels have been turned around creating a unique wheel design for a lego model pict0285jpg 29059k 83 downloads pict0277jpg 28626k 80 downloads the wheels look very cool even though the first couple of wheels stand a bit closer to each other dont know why that is hm  and they could have used a bit more body but the design is pretty good i know armagheddon isnt far away  pict0292jpg 21675k 70 downloads the suspension of the wheels is a bit flimsy sure it allows the truck to move around in a more realistic way than the old sets but its not as flexible as some older sets like sws ctt nor do the wheels have much body the black bars you see on top of the wheels are more window dressing then functional pict0293jpg 24478k 88 downloads the over all shape of the rhino is kinda bulky it looks more like a beatle than a rhino if youre asking me it has three major sections but i wouldnt call it a modular building though the cockpit is the first section its spacious and detailed pict0290jpg 26277k 0 downloads pict0291jpg 29975k 87 downloads the cockpit hangs down from a weird angle its attached to a large vertical technic brick that is part of the rhinos main structure so its not a seperate spaceship which is a shame oh well you cant have it all i guess pict0301jpg 29113k 78 downloads ah yes stickers all over the place but theyre cool the mid section of the rhino dominates the basic shape of the model its as if those two large white parts form a strong and thick shield protecting whatever is inside from whatever is outsde pict0007jpg 21322k 67 downloads unfortunately there is nothing inside its extra space needed to house the spaceship thats really a shame a command center of some kind could have given the rhino a bit more panache pict0286jpg 25135k 87 downloads however whats really great is the way in which they fit together one side has an orange 1x2 plate that fits in between two white 1x3 plates of the other side creating yet another unique shape for a lego model but again its a shame they didnt do more with this section xo pict0283jpg 28775k 82 downloads the third and last section is a platform for a space ship pict0299jpg 2895k 77 downloads pict0287jpg 19978k 75 downloads the platform itself isnt really special no details no stickers its just a skeleton to carry the spaceship nothing more nothing less no your space ship doesnt fall off even if you rotate the platform into a launch position pushing the weight of the ship backwards in fact the position of the ship onto the platform is so solid its kinda difficult to imagine how this ship flies off  the ship on the other hand is pretty cool its all sorts of things at the same time it seems it transports two aliens but also a small car that reminds me of the small sets of spacepolice 2 blacktron 2 pict0295jpg 3074k 85 downloads pict0298jpg 26813k 75 downloads pict0294jpg 27684k 76 downloads the shuttle reminds me of a star trek shuttle and i think it needs some modding but i do think it looks pretty nice sure the cockpit is a bit too low a pilot needs to lay down instead of sitting down and the dropping mechnism if there is one at all isnt all that brilliant either the main structure is a bit too technical for me i prefer actual parts with studs not these lego technic bars and pins pict0006jpg 22443k 74 downloads the crew pict0276jpg 23943k 70 downloads ah yes theres also this green plastic residu think they are supposed to be the aliens and theres also this weird alien craft but i didnt bother to build that sad good wub great innovative design lots of potential i even like the colors sweet lots of playability its a big attractive model i dont see any weak spots in the design that could compromise stability or structural integrity not so good  too many technic parts some sections on the model like the gun and the drilling device are a bit to flimsy id say 758510 price 750 danish crowns about 105euro	positive
thanks dude this is a great set can you please take more pictures thanks	positive
natelite on jul 15 2007 1220 pm said seems like they infuse system sets with more technic bars must be that technic isnt selling too well and they want to educate ppl how cool technic can be p its quite apparent when even the small bike needed technic frame my guess its less expensive and complicated to produce theyre also using these parts in other themes so in the end theyre producing a smaller catalog of bricks but every part gets produced in larger quantities	neutral
wow this year my wallet size has been bugging me sigh still its a goodlooking set and i will get it too many big sets	positive
this is a great review and so is the set y i thought i would buy it but when i saw the price i changed my mind xd i always liked flying things better though like the dropship although that is a bit pricey too i guess xd	neutral
this set is truely incredible a must have but this set is also incredibly overpriced n  com on its only a big vehicle  nothing really special to justify the near 100 price tag this set is clearly worth something like 65 at max look at the incredible dropship for 34 thats a good value for money y edited by mutex 15 july 2007  0457 pm	neutral

nice review y i have quick question though do the crystals fit into the aliens hands try and stick one in therebecuase the new catalog shows an image of an alien holding a crystal lastly lego should have made the aliens with movable arms and no hole in the middle  i dont want to waste any money so i am only going to grab 1 or 2 of the smaller sets piranha editimo the aliens would win becuase they have superior technology and all they do is have to cut the airtank line and the humans die edited by piranha 20 july 2007  0140 am	positive
yes they can hold the crystals they cant move the hands    but they do have the clawlike hand of the droid arm edit could you post some general beauty pics of the rhino and the attached craft such as front side back etc all we have of the ship is one top pic edited by mr mandalorian 20 july 2007  0518 am	positive
say i was looking at your pics and then at the instructions and i just realised  havent you put the stikers on the shield thingies in the middle upside down i think you did d i dont know if i like those new sets though i mean they have great shapes and potential but at the same time they seem so holey theyre really huge and big but full of empty air and space as well well this one not as much and indeed it is the best looking set of the lot though but i dont think ill go into that line	neutral
snefroe1 on jul 16 2007 0719 am said ok then ill do that later on but i will not touch that plastic residu xd you touched them to put them in their holders in the ship so in theory you will not review them anyways nice review i dont think ill get this though im trying to decide between this moble devastator or anothe 90 set i need to get something large before my bday regards vbbn	positive
great review wonderfully detailed dont care for the ship at all its that technic under a hollow shell thing like the ctt if it wasnt for the figures i would have hated it and nothing about these figures excites me ill end up finding the least number of sets possible to provide at least one of each figure for the general population collection and skip the rest unless they do as i expect and flop here thus leading to huge discounts i like this set  at half off 	positive
lego 41062 elsas sparkling ice castle lego managed to get a frozen licensed set in the new wave of disney princess sets however im very surprised by the size its a 40 set and comes in a small friendsstyle box roughly 12x12 size  i almost didnt see it on the shelf when i was looking for it because its so small i mean i know its only 40 but its a friggin castle and why did lego only make this a smaller set if theyd made a 200 frozen castle they still would have sold every one they could produce they made big harry potter hogwarts sets and those sure sold and have you seen the toys in the frozen section of stores huge playsets for barbiesized dolls but i suppose im getting the cart before the horse here reviewing before ive even opened the box so name elsas sparkling ice castle set number 41062 pieces 292 price 3999 minifigs 3 theme disney princess year of release 2015 links bricklink peeron brickset the box the front of the box is standard lego fare other than the large anna and elsa in the bottom right corner oh and surprisingly nowhere on the box is the normal minifig lineup the only way to know what characters are included is to look at the set pictures the 11 this set uses one of the minidolls as the actual size sample thats probably not a bad choice since the minidolls are not nearly as well known as a minifig the back on the back the play features are shown in insets around a rear view of the castle like friends sets you also have an array of play accessories the seals is this standard on 2015 sets or is this specific to this set ive never seen 3 tape seals on a set even huge modulars or technic sets only have 2 so 3 on a set this small seems excessive perhaps lego expects people to try to steal the dolls if so why bother with extra tape a tiny pocketknife makes quick work of the tape so the third strip doesnt even slow you down the contents in the box are 2 instruction booklets bent a white plate a sticker sheet and 3 numbered bags of parts the stickers these are very hard to photograph since theyre shiny i mean polished chrome shiny those dark lines across the corners are not really there theyre reflections of my ceiling the manual backs the back of one booklet has a friends win girl the other has an ad for the lego disney princess website that site is so girly theres even sparkles following your mouse cursor around so i didnt stay too long or look too deeply the sample page the interior pages of the manuals are on lavender backgrounds its standard lego instructions with part callouts and insets when needed the build 1 the first thing you build is anna but im not showing that yet then you build this little picnic scene its tiny but effective and nice to have something not icy in the set since the movie has the in summer song for olaf im curious whats in that sandwich though  green and pink after the picnic is the olaf build but ill save him for later too the build 2 next is this small sleigh it has an amazing amount of style for something so small the curved front and decorative whips on the back make it look sleighlike instead of blocky but come on it already had pink accents are the pink flowers really necessary technically yes so the whips can mount to them but still its just overgirly for my taste the build 3 the sleigh needs a ramp to help it rocket along for a couple inches at least the ramp starts like this with a hidden lime green jumper plate that gets a cookie on it i couldnt remember anything in the movie like that so i asked my wife and she couldnt either a hidden cookie under a hill the build 4 after putting the tilting 2x8 onto the base and adding decorations this is the result a lime green bucket holding a pair of ice skates a flower in the snow really green and white round studs that i assume are supposed to be grass and snow the build 5 the sleigh looks huge sitting on top of the tiny hill but it actually works pretty well assuming youre on a smooth surface like a table you can give the sleigh a little nudge and itll shoot down the ramp and a few inches across the table the unevenness of the slopes vs the blue tiles holds the sleigh in line well and the bumps in the slopes dont seem to hamper anything the build 6 moving on to bag 2 man thats a lot of colors in this base already and im already starting to feel like theres transblue cheese thrown around randomly the build 7 continuing and rotating some steps and even more colors thrown in magenta in elsas ice palace i sure dont remember any of that the build 8 wait seriously an ice cream stand in the castle that is what the magenta is for i kinda actually like the looks of it but it doesnt fit the set the build 9 spinning back around now theres a light aqua spiral staircase added along with a roof this is where im really starting to wonder about legos thinking those light aqua stairs and the light aqua 1x4 tiles are exclusive to this set as far as i know its possible some other 2015 sets use them but nothing in bricklink yet seems expensive to produce to me when theres no huge reason to need them another blue for the tiles would have been fine and the spiral stairs really elsas castle is known for staircases but not spiral ones there should be a huge straight ice stairway out front or sweeping curved stairs inside but not a spiral the build 10 and now we finish the tree again why where is there a tree next to elsas castle and so weird with ice hanging from green branches that have both snow and flowers on them huh did lego watch a different movie the translight blue bits before looking at the upper level a brief pause to look at some other parts heres the 1x2x5 brick in translight blue and the 2x4x6 rock panel in glitter translight blue do those look like the same blue to you and again another unique part for this set why do those rock panels need to be glitter when lego made the same panel in trans light blue in 2013 and 2014 for superheroes friends and chima sets apparently disney really wanted glitter because there are a bunch of transglitter parts in the new princess sets theres transneon green cones for jasmine ariel jasmine and sleeping beauty all get glitter trans purple cones so theres a bunch of new glitter parts for 2015 the build 11 back to building  time to add the upper level we get a bedroom with a decent bed although stickered the build 12 the other side of the bedroom has some little accessories perfume and a crown i assume the build 13 time for walls and a roof i like the small white macaroni bricks for a wall but whats with the lavender fence piece in the center ill grant that it looks nice a common white fence would have been a little boring but its another unique piece to this set the build 14 the very top of the castle is built separately not a whole lot to say here other than why is there a torch in an ice castle the finished castle once the roof is put on the castle is done and that big purple star on top says everything to me about the styling it just doesnt look like modern lego to me it looks like this should be an old belville fairy tale set from around 1999 if i saw a photo of just the castle with no figs or picnic blanket id assume thats what it was the oops not actually done yet accessories at the end theres a few bits left to add there are these dark purple skis yup another unique part in the lower level let me tell you theyre a pain to get into that location at least with my big man hands more accessories the top level gets a stickered book the sticker has a nice castle image on it that is while not quite exactly the castle from disney world very disneylooking i actually had to google and see if thats the castle they use in their logo nope but its the same style the leftovers there are a lot of extra parts in this thats almost 10 of the part count in the set right there they are pretty useful overall though its great to have an extra carrot and brown branch for olaf since you know those will get lost as hes played with the figs finally the reason for the set lets face it the castle set is just an excuse to make these figures and theyre great i mean just fantastic the print on them is just such a good match to the real characters compare to the cartoon version from the front of the box elsas hair is a little darker than the cartoon but overall these are just dead on if i had to pick out a flaw its the spell elsa is holding its too bad she can only shoot it forward with her arm down like that itd be nice to have the end of the splash part bent 90 degrees so she can have her arm forward and the spell shooting forward too oh one other thing the minidoll heads dont press down tight to the body like minifig heads do theres still exposed neck it looks nice but it means elsas cape can swing around the fig backs elsas cape is glittery on the back and you can see the removable bow in her hair the full set one final issue when you put anna on the sleigh her cape doesnt have enough flexibility since its a wraparound kind and so it folds out funny thats why on the back of the box it shows her standing on the back of the sleigh with elsa in the seat edit how on earth did i forget to comment on those orange flowers to each side of the castle im pretty sure elsa did not have any flowers blooming outside her castle the conclusion hm i really wanted to like this set but i just cant quite bring myself to it feels like lego pulled a random castle design from the files then redid it into white and trans blue to look icy and allow a frozen tie in set the figs are great but the castle isnt i guess the real castle in the movie would be a boring set and this one has play features but it just is too different for my taste the ratings value 710  40 for less than 300 parts is high especially when so many of the parts are tiny but on the other hand theres a lot of rock panels and 1x2x5 trans blue panels but the figs help save it design 410  not one of legos best not as bad as the lows in the 90s but not a great set minifigs 1010  possibly even a 1210 they are the reason to buy the set  playability 810  there are a bunch of play features but they actually detract from the design so i had to knock off a couple points parts 710  a bunch of impractical unique parts how often do you need dark purple skis or a lavender fence piece but also a bunch of nice parts if you wanted to make your own icy scene overall 710  a great bunch of figs but id recommend not bothering with the manuals just use the parts to build your own castle thats better	neutral
two of my daughters are building this as we speak i agree the design is a lot smaller than i would have liked but theyre loving it no question the figures are the real draw here and at 6 and almost five years old theyre doimg a good job building so far at least for the 46 range in my house this set is a home run thanks for the great review mostlytechnic	positive
i managed to get two sets for my twin girls for christmas and would have to agree with your ratings the anna and elsa figs are indeed excellent	neutral
isnt getting parts in new colors a good thing it is a shame there is only this one set i think tlg could make a whole subtheme out of frozen i do agree that they overuse lavender and magenta i dont see why every girl set has to have these sort of colors instead of what would be accurate to the source material 	negative
thanks for the review i have the same opinion about the design looks like belville i bought it on legostore orlando december 30th it was impressive my wife saw them putting on shelf 8 or 10 boxes she ran and grabbed the last one the girls faces around it was indescribable mix of ecstasy and afraid to loose it it happened in less than 2 minutes my 7 yo girl didnt want it she likes the dresses but hates the movie prefers lego movie but my 2 yo girl who never saw the movie grabbed it for good and we bought it lego will sell it like water but i do not understand why a set so small it is the worst set design since the introduction of lego friends my 7 yo has more than 50 lego friends minifigures all the lego fiends stores and concluded that the castle had a terrible design she is 7 lets be honest lego should have released this sets months before this christmas and is loosing a perfect opportunity to sell a decent set with much more pieces i am wondering if they are going to make another set with the same characters at the end it is just for the minifigures	negative
when i first saw the pictures i didnt realize that this set had so much color barf going on in it also there is a bunch of stuff that does not fit in with the movie and it is pricey the minifigures are nice but no kristoff or sven i thought about getting this but this review is pushing me towards no	negative
i wish elsa had more of a white hairpiece rather than blonde but it could be worse not a bad set overall although olaf doesnt look right without the twigs on his head anna is a really nice and accurate fig	positive
the review is very well done thanks i dont know the movie my key question is whether the bricks in the set will allow to build my own snowice creations now with transglitter being part of the design approach i am not so sure can those who have already bought it tell me can transglitter be used as transparent with snow particles or is it just terrible i cannot really tell from the review pic above	neutral
im literally of the exact opposite opinion to op here i love the structure and the parts this is a fantastic little parts pack that ill be snagging more of when i find it againbut ive no use for the figures not a big disney princess fan its all about the parts this set is freaking amazing d	positive
well the good news for you is youre in luck whenever you find sets since the figs sell for a good bit of money  right now the bricklink value of the 3 figs is about 30	positive
mostlytechnic on 10 january 2015  0202 am said i think the transglitter blue panels can be icy or snowy just fine im sure thats why they used them for this set now if youre looking for realism like the photos in your sig seem to be it might be tougher but ive been thinking about using those big glittery panels to make a waterfalltype scene the guys over in the historic forum will kill me if my mocs start to glitter ill take a closer look when i see the set in a shop and as i understand i can sell the minifigs for the price of the set	neutral
very nice review indeed and i also cant wait for the release of this set it will be a superb wonderful addition to the lego disney princess theme	positive
im pretty sure ive gotten other sets recently with three pieces of tape on them	neutral
i see the cookie smugglers from the detectives office have already infiltrated other lego themes	neutral
there is a very simple reason for the flowers and greenleaved trees you should remember from the movie it was actually summer when elsa set of the eternal winter… the orange flowers do bother me from a design point of view i would have liked it better if they were a pinkpurplebluewhite color same goes for the leafy bits they could have used the pinkpurple ones they are gonna use in the elves sets it would have been fantastic if they had given us white leafy bits like snow covered branches im sure loads of us could use those in our mocs edited by bennemans 13 january 2015  0614 pm	neutral
great review i definitely agree the minidolls are too awesome and are definitely a musthave i love all the extra pieces from any set some of them go on my phone case	positive
this seems to be one of those sets that lego really should have released a month before christmas it likely then would have been toy of the year 2014	positive
im trusting there is something else going on behind the scenes because this should have been a huge set and released in november of 2014 at the latest maybe we will see more and better frozen sets when the postchristmas consumer spending wave hits edited by m0dulo 13 january 2015  1003 pm	neutral
hello everyone i am back to share with all of you another of my legends of chima polybags review it will be pretty comprehensive since the finished built will be quick and will be focusing more of what kind of fun that you can derive from there this polybag was bought in september 2013 when i visited legoland malaysia and i did not hesitate to put this in my shopping basket name 30253 leonidas jungle dragster theme lego system  legends of chima year 2013 pieces 30 minifigs 1 minifigure price usd na gbp na euro na sgd na resources brickset bricklink an original polybag image of the 30253 leonidas jungle dragster back view of the original polybag image of the 30253 leonidas jungle dragster the road scout of the lions tribe this polybag design is definitely plan to be the quickest and fastest dragster to recce enemy front by making a swift scout for the lions tribe i believe by the sound of the name jungle dragster it might just be suitable to use in jungle terrain well i dont quite agree that this is a dragster even though it has the kind of open view concept of rolling in fast but it does not have the length of a typical dragster similar to this town polybag design for example still it is nice to have smaller variants of their vehicular supremacy instruction manual front instruction manual back the lego building content with just 30 lego elements you can be pretty quick to be able to display these laid out content after the built is completed these are the remaining spare parts i am fond of the wheels which are some useful parts other than that there are nothing spectacular about it my name is leonidas and i belonged to the lions tribe do not be mistaken of his name leonidas to be the king of sparta who led the brave men of 300 spartans warriors to fight to the death against the persians instead this character is based on the bio resided in legocom you will realise that he is aligned with the lions tribe and is a proud lion footsoldier he may have that goofy idiotic look but he can be very serious in his commitment to discharging his duties you are able to observe his nice back view printing which reveal his black and blue sash leonidas has a dual facial feature to reveal his much serious appearance leonidas is one of the common characters available in the legends of chima universe it can be found in a total of five sets it is a great pity that there is no weapon being made for him in this polybag design which will certainly make a fine addition the completed built of the jungle dragster this is the main design of the jungle dragster which is very simple looking there is no distinct fighting capability from the vehicular design and it look just like a regular patrol vehicle one thing i like about this is the close distinct colour schema of the lions tribe other than that there is nothing special about it moving off with my jungle dragster to conclude this polybag is really meant for lego fans or collectors who appreciate legends of chima or wanting to sample the legends of chima theme it is a very simple built but yet could form a decent force size for recce purposes before sending in the big arsenals to whack their enemies either way i will only suggest you to buy it if you really love this theme at an inexpensive price otherwise it is perfectly alright to give this a miss summary review playability 410 you need to have more lions tribe vehicles in order to bring the best and fun out of it since this is more of a supporting vehicle design 410 simplistic built of the dragster and main focus is just acquiring the minifigure price 410 bought at about usd7 which is not an awesome price so get it if you can get it more than half of this price overall 410 if only you are a huge mega fan of the legends of chima then you need to get this i gave it a 2 based on my review score card what about yours i hope every one of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and criticisms are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my flickr	negative

when i first saw pics of the biplane i wasnt sure if i liked it or not but after seeing it in more detail i gotta say i love the thing wub its a great plane with so many good aspects its also the perfect counter vehicle for the new batplane for me though the best part of the set has got to be the new pumpkin heads those are just beautiful and i cant wait to get lots of them	positive

great review funny as allways the comic was just a hell lot of fun it really had me laughing i would love to have this set but the price is just to high here far worse than i had expected ill be better off buying the battank which is much better priced actually there is almost no price difference between the batcopter and the battank here wacko	negative

what about the cartoon batman the animated series will always be the definitive batman to me the two tim burton movies were okay they havent aged well though and i really dig what christopher nolan is doing with the new movies christian bale did a fine job in batman begins  but when i watch the movie i hear kevin conroys voice in my head the cartoon rocked and as much as i enjoyed the justice league unlimited cartoon my biggest complaint was always more batman please	neutral

out of nowhere this set appeared at my local tru hadnt been expecting this one for a while so a nice surprise sweet firstly the box nice pic on the front good selection of minifigs the officer and pilot look cool with their dark blue trousers a new r2 unit as well dont remeber this in the film but great to have one in a new colour wub back of the box shows some of the ships nifty features first thing you notice when you open the box is the awesome selection of bricks this makes a for a great parts pack loads of unusual red and dark red pieces its so refreshing to see a star wars set that isnt predominantly grey there are also two instruction booklets as soon as you open the first booklet you hit an error why would i want two obiwans  its also at this point that you come across a big disappointment on the box you get a flesh quigon what is actually in the box is an epiii obiwan come on lego  why change it  all the figures look impressive in the flesh despite the big mistake once i started the build it progressed rapidly red pieces seem to be a lot easier to find lots of clever techniques quite a few technic elements get used at the start it reminded me of building a technic set from the 80s at times here is the main body half way through the build the landing mechanism is a nice touch its not fully retractable but still folds away nicely you find the ship keeps tipping over as you build it despite the feet as its only at the end thay it all becomes evenly balanced at both ends here the feet are extended you can also see the yellow knob that rotates the radar on top of the ship landing gear up viewed from the front here are the radar a great collection of dishes they spin easily with little friction here is the ship at the half way point the front works well with the top flipping up to squeeze in the pilot more to come 	positive

kernow on jul 22 2007 1136 pm said 7665 review part 2 theres one more useful feature the whole ship can be safely and comfortably picked up by two ball ended technic pins towards the back end it balances well at this point and does allow you to swoosh the ship around much more easily yeah nude swoosh on xd excellent review this looks like a very nice piece of legoenginereing y like you i think it looks like the original i did think though that it was supposed to be a unarmed ship but i can defenitly live with that xd the escape shuttle looks roamy enough a bit dull though but it could have a ps iii stached away somewhere but the other shuttle   come on is it for minime when he needs to go and get some burgers  fries getting at least two on copmike	positive

brick miner on jul 31 2007 0746 pm said as for the set the thing that jumps out at me most is the use of dark blue for water im so used to seeing the classic blue for water that the dark blue seems weird i dont like it  bm indeed i only noticed this when i saw the sh images i guees that theyre on dark waters you can always put some trans blue and trans clear 1x1 round plates no i tried that technique to make the lava using trans red and trans orange plates it looks neat regarding the human soldier thing yoda mentioned its quite weird like him im going to swap the legs so theyre coherent with the soldiers from the other sets third note is it just me or did you attach the two black gate pieces too high shakar	neutral
shakar on aug 1 2007 0134 pm said third note is it just me or did you attach the two black gate pieces too high shakar no i think this is correct the upper plate with clip for the door is a little high on top of a dark gray 1x1 brick so if you want the door to operate well you have to place it like that i just put the clip under that brick a very easy fix so my door now is lower which looks better imho and no sneaky skelly can crawl along under it xd	neutral
not sure i like this one much i like many of the new parts but the boat isnt that great and i would rather get each seperately so i can avoid the whole skeleton army nice review though	positive
yes that was definately an optic illusion looking at it again the gap looks a lot shorter thanks  shakar	positive
yes very nice review mr brickster i think i  for a change like the castle part better the ship doesnt look quite right to me if theyre gonna make a pirate theme with ships like this i wouldnt be very happy but i think the ship brings some nice accesories like the anchor a black mid piece steering wheel etc i think ill buy it eventually wout on aug 1 2007 0819 pm said nice review i like the buildingport the most mmmdark blue plates wub pity it is a toysrus exclusive in the netherlands there are only toysrusses in the greater cities ah thats good to know now i wont be searching in other toystores as well thanks mr tiber	positive

a very good review thanks mutley777 y hmm that shattered base looks better than i thought a very playable set really nice for the snowspeeder i prefer the main gun design of its predecessor but the grappling hook gun is a good improvement if the door would just be large enough for it p	positive

mutley777 on aug 2 2007 0500 pm said yep very reasonable y not too bad  might have to pick that up soon then i will be in tru in southampton over the weekend  i think ill buy the bigger sets here and get the smaller ones in the usa later in the year the smaller the boxes the more chance i will have getting them in my suitcase  i have to say i am very glad we are now not getting a 11 ratio between the numbers used prices in usa vs uk eg it is not longer 4999  4999 	positive
nice review mutley y i agree with all your observations especially stickers versus printed parts  i get some of this and replace the snowspeeders with my v2s hoth on copmike	positive
mutley777 on aug 2 2007 0237 pm said ok here is the set alot of us star wars fans have been waiting for the 7666 hoth rebel base wub first the box now i really dont know what to get for christmas    the biwing baron or this and its quoted because it says limited edition i may never get this set now 	positive
man the stickers on everything are really starting to irritate me a lot im not sure i like the white 3p0 in a set that is primarily made up of whites doesnt stand out enough the snowspeeder looks a lot shorter than previous versions steve	negative
outstanding review jim congrats  love the pictures so clean and crisp  hope to see many more of your reviews as for the set after seeing this review i kind of like it if i will find it at a decent price i will get it for sure	positive
jgw3000 on 12 march 2015  0546 pm said jim great review as always you convinced me to get this one of these days although not a to priority any comments on which functions can be converted to pf and how well they work actually yes i am in the midst of making a pf version i will post a picture of the setup i have so far this setup is for driving the chassis and it works pretty fine	positive
thanks for a great review ive got a pile of tru and lego credit i wanna spend and was thinking about getting this since i got a sneak peak of your review in the academy but its not here in the us yet too bad wonder when itll hit i do disagree about the manuals though i find the thinner stapled manuals easier to use than single large squarebound ones since they lay flatter when open have any links to the prelim photos of the front end i dont remember seeing that and was curious how different it looked	positive
great review i see now why the b model is so popular i wonder though on the car if instead of the panels for the rear spolier or wing if they could have used studded panels and maybe layer them to give the appearance of ie a three element rear wing i wont mention the front lights if i had the money i would buy it for the b model h	positive
great review jim and stunning pictures	positive
i think this set will be my next purchase i love the color scheme and indeed it looks like a nice set also 1200 parts for eur 100 is not a bad deal and yes the looks of the car have really grown on my since the first official pictures appeared im curious how the bright green will work combined with other colors than white i really hope more sets in the future will use the color so that more different parts will be available over time i think im the only person on eurobricks who doesnt like the looks of the b model but i appreciate the extra functionality it offers besides the set itself i think this is one of the best reviews i have read in a while great job on the superb photographs which i think are essential to a review and the extensiveness of it all you really touched every subject which is great d	positive
great review with fantastic pictures as for the model im glad that they chose to make it less pretty  real le mans prototypes are rarely a sight to behold it is function and aerodynamics over form i would however have preferred more realism for the sake of learning  the front shouldnt open like that  instead it should be easy to remove the whole front cover leaving the suspension easy to work on  the aero seems to be realistic except for the rear end where theres no indication of a venturi channel this should have been easy to include  there is no fuel tank nor fixed fuel connector right behind the cabin  there are no air jacks seriously this is one of the most unique features of a race car like this and lego forgot about them instead they automated two functions which are manual on a real race car  the top cars at le mans are hybrids with ingenious systems i would have loved to see the front wheels connected to some kind of spinning apparatus indicating a kinetic energy recovery system if i get this set im going to make some modifications	positive
this is a mega review youve taken the right pictures and the video demonstrations of the mechanisms really help get the good points of the set across whats more amazing is that the review still feels very concise and to the point youve actually convinced me to put this set on my list and not just as a decent parts pack lasse d on 12 march 2015  0847 pm said  the front shouldnt open like that  instead it should be easy to remove the whole front cover leaving the suspension easy to work on  the aero seems to be realistic except for the rear end where theres no indication of a venturi channel this should have been easy to include  there is no fuel tank nor fixed fuel connector right behind the cabin  there are no air jacks seriously this is one of the most unique features of a race car like this and lego forgot about them instead they automated two functions which are manual on a real race car  the top cars at le mans are hybrids with ingenious systems i would have loved to see the front wheels connected to some kind of spinning apparatus indicating a kinetic energy recovery system im not sure air jacks are the feature that will have people fawning over this set and pneumatics are being covered rather well later in the year  but i agree with everything else most notably removable front and rear bodywork the removable engine cover on 8674 would be a good starting point here and the inclusion of some nod towards a hybrid system its also worth remembering the preliminary design did have the big honking fin bhf that is mandatory on all current prototypes so maybe when that was removed any trace of a tunnel or diffuser went with it on the subject of steering wheels all modern prototypes actually have left or right hand drive the regulations demand that both lmp1 and lmp2 cars are nominally capable of seating two people of course in practise the extra seat is taken up by the hybrid system in lmp1 and electronicsextra cockpit access in lmp2 however this doesnt change the fact that it would be easy to link the steering wheel to the hogfront axle edited by jay psi 12 march 2015  0955 pm	positive
i was very skeptical of this set because i really thought the redesign degraded the looks of the amodel a lot but after building it i must say this is an excellent set good job tlg	positive
im still not a huge fan of the model but this is one awesome review the effort and quality can be clearly seen and i hope you continue making reviews like this	positive
great review jim i have been sitting on the fence about if i will get this set for a while but i saw one built for the first time at a local brick show on the weekend it definitely looks better in real life than any pics i have decided to buy one	positive
a very professional review and really no stone unturned but im still not going to rush out and buy a copy	positive

a great review jim just finished building this set a couple of steps required abit of lego stressing to get together when there was an easier way just made it into rc  almost finished it in ldd which was easy to do as it has so much room for nearly any configuration of motors and not have them showing a great set edited by jonorocky 13 march 2015  1053 am	positive
wonderful review but i am still not sold on the set if we get more sets with the bright green i might be tempted to get it but until then it is too few parts in bright green too few different types not the number of pieces to be able to use that colour effectively in making mocs	neutral
true but i must say i like the new colour very fresh looking compared to the rather dullish regular green cant wait to build mocs with it	positive
ickelpete on aug 2 2007 0845 pm said the treads are dark grey i not too good with naming colours the treads are the same as in the snowmobile set released earlier in the year they are a hard plastic thanks you have proved yourself strong enough for the dark side	positive
lordgalewind on aug 3 2007 0317 am said ah mani wanted to review it with mine oh well here in the us it cost 150 and has 1355 pieces total the pins and axles did seem a bit difficult in putting them into place a problem i have been having is the batterys are done after about 4 hours of play which i really wish they would last longer   overall it is a stupendous set and it is really nice to see our old friend the studs make a return you found it in the us where im really liking this set its looking better now that im seeing more of it at differnt angles imvery curious how wellit pulls and and can pushdoze before the clutches start slipping	positive
thanks for the review this looks like a great set and with four motors two receivers and a remote control i wouldnt say it is overpriced it is still a lot of money though if my scholarship permits it i will seriously consider buying this set	positive
i cant wait to get my paws on this dozer  the new motors look very interesting and i it will be fun to see which possibilities they have in any future mocs	positive
5150 lego on aug 3 2007 0610 am said you found it in the us where im really liking this set its looking better now that im seeing more of it at differnt angles imvery curious how wellit pulls and and can pushdoze before the clutches start slipping the clutches are only for the shovel and claw on the front and back the tracks are driven directly from the xl motors and first impressions are good they seem quite powerful it will climb over a small cusion quite easily	positive
ickel thanks for that awesome review it makes me want to buy this set i think itd go just swell with the mobile crane the fact that it has all the motors and such is awesome i can foresee using those for a lot of other functions for mocs and well im a fan of treads you can never have enough treads d hm would you be able to tell us perhaps after a test or two what kind of weight this beast can push around thank you	positive
hi many thanks for this review photos and videos i cant wait to put the hands on mine since it is already ordered and should arrive before the end of the month  could you post a scan or photos from those last pages in the building instructions where the parts included are listed thanks edited by conchas 04 august 2007  0719 pm	positive

the new small technic sets have incredible functionality for their size and this one is no exception with only 106 parts this crane can roll extend rotate lift and hold in any position and has working stabilisers the boom extends the same as the other sets with this boom simply pull it it works surprisingly well and due to circular ridges inside the boom the extension which is just a standard beam will hold in place the gear at the back controls the height of the boom as you can see the boom is only half extended boom fully extended half down the cable is kept in place via two gears and a blue pin same as the 7905 crane even under decent weights this works well the stabilisers however cannot handle much weight once the load is moved off axis the stablilsers are a very simple but effective design another shot of the stablilsers this also shows how far the boom will decend the boom height mechanism works well also i love the cab design overall this is a remarkable achievement for the low price i bought it for the boom piece as i want to improve the crane that came with 7998 7898    i highly recommend it	positive
very nice review sinner y wub so we are getting more and more reviews with figs in it thats great  i actually wanted to skip this technic set but your review made me think again i havent seen you posting a price so i will do that for you p  its just 999 in germany	negative

alright so i usually do quick photo reviews when i get new sets thats what ill do here but theres quite a few photos so i thought i might as well make its own review thread so i got the kwikemart by paying just2much on an early ebay copy i think its worth it as this week im gonna be super busy so i was able to build it saturday and stuff heres my video review i think its one of my best well lets get onto this photo review the set is 200 usd with a little over 2100 pieces the official release is april 15th for vip members may 1st for everyone else at lego stores and if you want full size pictures check out my flickr by clicking here the minifigures included are great you get three exclusive minifigures one being a completely exclusive character the first time lego has ever put an exclusive mould in a direct to consumer set and you get three of the series most popular characters in their normal attire for those who missed out on the first simpsons minifigures series the kwikemarts exterior is loaded with lots of sticker details the only printed detail youll see in the exterior is the dial pad in the phone booth which has appeared in some other licensed themes since last year   right here is there the store can be opened a simple technic pin and receiver keeps it in place and allows for opening and closing the roof of the store includes the garden shown in the paul mccartney episode the roof can be slided outin once you open it with the hinge part heres a look at the store with the roof removed the floors are a nice sand blue color coming with 8x16 thin plates and for the interior from the view of the store opened with the hinges at the back that i mentioned earlier the left front corner which includes some arcade machines of bonestorm and great white hunter an amazingly done buzz cola soda machine juice machine the checkout counter ect the right front corner with food aisles freezers and a frozen jasper sticker the back left corner which includes some nice coffee kettle builds the donut tray hotdogs ect the right back corner which has a door leading to a very small hallway that only has a mouse and cheese in it the hallway leads to the employees only door in the back and its very hard to get in the door way not that theres anything to do inside there also included is clancys copcar which fits three figures heres a look at the piece list in the instructions click on each to be lead to an enlarged version of the pic also included are some awesome printed pieces and two unprinted coffee cups honestly i think this set is perfect the price is fantastic and has a great ppp ratio they really went above and beyond by including snake in this set i honestly think its better than the simpsons house in terms of accuracy and the value here so many cool pieces printed and in exclusive colors so thats my quick picture review hope you guys enjoyed and id love to hear your thoughts	positive
thanks for the review your video was very well done seeing those sticker sheets is daunting	positive
thanks for the review i cant help but think the minifigures are the weak part of the set snake and apu are great but the rest i dont know they kinda redundant now they could at least give us new torso printing like homer wearing his jacket or bart wearing his blue tshirt or marge wearing her coat or as i said in the discussion thread id have included jasper in cmf series 2 and a frozen version here overall the set looks kinda smaller than what i thought snakes bag needed a  symbol printed because it looks like he is stealing gargabe  pretty good review overall	positive
thanks for all the feedback you guys robert8 on 12 april 2015  1125 pm said i cant help but think the minifigures are the weak part of the set snake and apu are great but the rest i dont know they kinda redundant now they could at least give us new torso printing like homer wearing his jacket or bart wearing his blue tshirt or marge wearing her coat or as i said in the discussion thread id have included jasper in cmf series 2 and a frozen version here overall the set looks kinda smaller than what i thought i agree but so many people were complaining about how the simpsons house should have included the most common versions mostly because the eyes or whatever so i think lego played it safe and just included the normal versions it makes sense since series 1 is gone forever and the common versions were in there and this set is bound to be in stock for a very long time like the death star i never really agreed when people were complaining about the alternate eye prints personally but i guess this is a good business choice based on previous feedback edited by just2good 13 april 2015  1206 am	negative
hello everyone excellent review english is not my native language but i want to express my opinion simpsons house was the first of its kind and i can say without exaggeration that this is the most impressive set that im going my collection httpbricksetcomsetsownedbyceleb  i look at the video from the kwikemart and is difficult to say how good it is compared with the house the main disadvantages that i said to myself is this build the walls of the large panels next is access to the roof gray parts in front of the back door i think they represent the stairs is not on the level with doors on the roof and when you open them you can see the white block is openly trash my points of view boxes on the left of go to the store and powersauce box i want see make real and not just a cube fe such as in the unreleased star wars set about minifigures i fully agree with robert8 two more of the same homer marge and bart personally i put my set as a scene and all the replays minifigure are inside the house that was not identical characters next and also absolutely terrible barts accessory this set is made parking for bikes and it looks very cool but damn it is hoped to see the bart or lisas bike instead of useless balloons with paint the walls are made with convex inside panels why so can anyone know have not seen any pictures with such walls in tv show why did not they turn i personally really like how realized roof but my brother says that it is terrible  garden could do more in the series there were almost jungle i do not know how to be considered here maybe anyone can express any opinion or idea i look at the simpsons house and then look at the photo of this emart i can not understand in the house we have a garage two floors cool floor a lot of furniture all the rooms and walls collected from cubes many additional accessories and where is all this detail here it looks much smaller maybe even poorer if they still will release next year comic book store it will be even less of course it is difficult to estimate without seeing it live we have it will be sold only in may at first sight it does not look so impressive as the house can certainly the case in the limit on the amount of detail but why it was impossible to add  50 to the cost and make jasper the more detailed the roof the walls of the smaller elements that it was not convex sad thanks all for attention edited by celeb 13 april 2015  0510 am	positive

i have sooo mixed feeling about that i loved the simpsons house save for the terrible wall in the homer and marges room but this so far is inferior in almost every aspect the walls made of panels is a bummer i expect a d2c set to be better that this 60 stickers the same thing same price for less bricks and smaller build then the house strange coloured bricks on the outside wall some ugly mix of yellow  tan panels again with their fronts facing towards the inside of the shop so we and up with those squares all around the walls are yellow this was so nice lost opportunity to make it in some other less common colour then again the set overall looks is good the roof is a nice detail the shop looks actually like a real one not just an approximation of one the roof tiles are in dark orange  we got newrare colour here the car looks interesting to build just like the pink one from the house lots of nice references to the show its the simpsons definitely a must buy but for a discounted price ill try to find one with maybe damaged box or afterdisplay copy edited by mestari 14 april 2015  0115 pm	negative

thats actually not bad sizing imo sure it looks like you get a lot more with the house but the kwikemart has a lot more of those little references that make it simpsons i agree with some of the complaining a real jasper behind a transblue panel would have been cool you could always bulk up the roof with more foliage i think it has a great foundation as a set but could do with a few mods to make it better thanks for the pictures i greatly appreciate being able to see reviews like this before dropping 200 on a lego set	negative

did anyone else have a problem with the piano against the wall of the simpsons house it just kept coming off way too easily and i was getting really frustrated with it sticking out and not fully going on so i had to put the two tiles that hold them one place over away from the wall for it to sit properly without falling out i think i might put snowball ii behind it since cats love to hide underneath or behind things lol but just curious to know if anyone else was encountering this problem with the previous set	positive
nice review of a surprisingly interesting set y those windows are great and no doubt difficult to get classic coffee maker simple yet exactly right that baseplate was in a few other sets but never with that pattern would have made a great base for some of the classic 80s houses lego used to treat us to in tan was part of the adventurers egypt sets as recently as 2001 it was a base for ogel versatile plate that hopefully hasnt disappeared completely parapink is apparently light pink on brickshelf so i guess its just lighter than normal pink and stopped appearing in 1995 just so you know that monkey is drinking too much and likely to fall in the pool  	positive

due to a larger bl order in the us i couldnt resist to add two hopper waggons to my train layout heres a review of this fantastic set the box well theres nothing really special about it the open box with three polybags note that there are only three different colors used in that set actually there are 4 but you cant see the dark grey ones great color composition by the way wub and  no stickers   d oooops  i opened the bags too fast help me im drowning sing not following the instructions i built the wheels first to get the larger pieces out of the way keep on rolling this is the load of the hopper waggon 11 round bricks altogether when i opened the set i was curious if it was a new colored set or an old one luckily enough it was an old one with old dark grey i dont know if tlc ever produced this set with bley from the following pic you can clearly see that the set is an old one look at these slope bricks see what i mean all bricks are looking exactly the same buy a set today means get at least three different textures on the slopes and maybe even more shades of tan x  i have said that in many other threads here and im saying it again back to the roots lego you were able to produce good quality show us you can still do it sad but now to the building its a 6 x 24 train base plate youre building on did i say i liked the colors d this is the mechanism to unload the waggon built in the waggon with open gates  and with closed ones almost done this is the first time i realized that minifigs actually can step on those ladders  a short lift and the wheels are fixed this darn mechanism wait im coming with my monkey wrench  who opened that door again do i have to do it all on my own  finally the work is done now have a brake one shot from the frontback you can see the car is really huge 8 i put it behind the red car of the 4512 that sure looked very strange wacko the set fits a lot better to the other cars of the my own train theme than to the older ones the score brick selection 1010 excellent color and brick selection these were the days playability 910 great unloading mechanism pricepiece count ratio 810 at peeron it says 20 i got it for 3995  30228 bricks not really cheap but worth every cent  overall rating 910 and a definity must buy for rolling stock lovers sad enough its not available on sh any more but there are still sets on bl and ebay thats for now folks thank you for reading i have some job to do	positive

thank you guys for your nice reply  i have to add two pics of my freight train showing a bit more clearly what the size matter is about this is what it looks like when you put the hopper waggon right behind the red car of 4512 it looks a lot better without the red car i had a lot of fun with this review and i will add another one look at the 2nd pic   the next days stay tuned	neutral

yes my spongebob fans its time for another review  lets look at our bikini bottom map and head strait to meet miss puff at her boating school she is waiting for us to give us a guided tour of her establishment  another bit of sb history this set comes from the following episode boating school spongebob fails his boating test for the 38th time what a freaking retard lool hes so determined to get his license that patrick decides to help him he implants a walkietalkie inside sbs head in order to cheat and tell him what to do you will say that i am biais but i really enjoy building this set and i really like the sb theme  lets hope 2008 brings more of that cool spongieness  but i digress here are general pics of the instruction booklet and the dss g there are loads of crappy stickers in that one also  as you can see the set is divided in 3 polybags shamelessly but nonetheless wilfully hehe i will disregard the third one which is that playability crap course  i would have reviewed it but since it involves stickers i didnt want to ruin the parts and without stickers it would look dull plain and ugly it does look crappy with so imagine without so that review will not be 100 complete and i do apologise in advance but how many of you would have build that and keep it hehe off p 1 mfs and extras i will start with the really cool miss puff wub the fig mind you  she looks a bit stressed  no wonder that sponge menace will bring her to the hospital once again hehe as you can see that mf comprises 3 parts the small blue 1x1 round and the 2 major parts yeay another great stupid looking sb i love those idiotic faces  3 different sb figs and 3 idiotic faces hehe you never can get enough of them  here is just a regular patrick too bad patrick doesnt have different expressions  the pull back boat car nothing really to report except the fact that i left it sticker free  the only thing i built from the third polybag is that pretty cool ancker holding tower thingie  looks great in a lighthouse set hehe yes the roud tile bouey is printed  its the same as in sbs bed in the bikini bottom set  ok its time for those two great buildings the lighthouse and the school  pontoon  before reviewing them individually here is a general pic 2 the lighthouse one of the main reason to own that great set  sure it suffers from accute stickeretite sad but d  t worst is that door but nonetheless a great and simple building  great whitered colour scheme and a really fantastic 2 turning lights  i really like the yellow top of the lighthouse it adds to the comic atmosphere of that theme instead of having a more plain redwhite only the rear has nothing really fancy except tools to fix it in case of problems hehe the only thing i modified since i didnt build the third polybag is that i got rid of the trechnic parts on the right of the lighthoue to replace them with regular logs all hail the tower king  d 3 the school and pontoon i really like that little building and its great to see that once again tlc uses the amazing dark blue color  its really a simple design but looks fantastic and can be used for many things in a town hehe i also really like the combination with those dark bluish grey slopes  the rear reveals the desk stickers on the wall doh  and two clams serving as chairs really like on the show its really great to see that tlc stays really as close to the show as possible the pontoon again is simple yet really cool and effective and its really nice to have 2 lifesaving boueys the only thing i modified since i didnt build the third polybag is that i got rid of the trechnic parts in front of the pontoon to replace them with regular logs on the overall i think its really a great set  apart from the crap stickers i think tlc should have ditched or simplified the third playability polybag to lower the cost  oh well parts are always usefull except those one part shitty palm trees  so until my next review i bid you farewell my spongebob fans  and i really hope to see next year hehe will sb get his drivers license one day  for the sake of bikini bottom lets hope not  no license ever on  yoda	positive

man that spongebob head cracks me up hilaritythis is a cool set although i much prefer the chum bucket set i dont see whats wrong with the course then again i can see why afols wouldnt like it its just playability really i like the breakable wall though the building is cool a few modifications ie making it more realistic real chairs for a start and it would make a cool little wharf for your lego town and to sw4j mrs puffs legs are connected at the feet if you look closely so thanks for the great review yoda	positive
thank you yoda for strike 2 its sb again  sticker alarm x but this set is better than chum bucket there are far more interesting parts if you dont like sb especially the light house and the little hut with the wooden pontoon y and yet again another set with smooth slopes and rough ones too bad too bad    if i just knew the person who is responsible for that 	positive
nice review mate the set looks great and a real must for all those sb fans out there the whole set scream playability thats for sure which is great because lets be honest theirs gonna be alot of kids and yoda out their playing with it p xd   geezzzzz what is it with all those bloody stikers this set would be soooooo much better with printed pieces instead of those still once your over that at least the rest is ok am i the only one who thinks mrs puff kinda looks like a kinder egg toy theirs nothing wrong with that mind you yes i have a kinder problem xd  just seems strange to me	positive
maybe mrs puff has a nice toy inside xd i like this review the lighthouse part and the school are nice enough for other towns and the figs are nice even mrs puffs 2 pieces you cant use for other things  pity that its 50 dollars 60 euro for half price i would think about it	positive

the set and the other designer sets that came out with it especially 4888 are incredibly well designed sets i wish lego would go back to doing sets like these as i loved the multitude of instructions and ideas the last batch of creator sets had zero ideas even though i know several were made  anyway less whining more review the lion is the main model his mouth doesnt fully close but it does open more the head works well from most angles i love the dark orange bricks great for rust he is quite solid but the joints take the weight well the neck goes side to side and rotates but doesnt go up and down the body is built in two parts and pinned in the middle with what is left you can make what i think is a hyena a silly plant moc and what i believe is a vulture there are also instructions for a few other models including a bat boar and a snake which i quite like he can be built at the same time as this cute little lizard overall this is a great set with an excellent blend of colours and pieces i wanted it for steampunk potentials sweet i hope you liked the review till next time	positive
great review as always y lego is timeless so there is no such thing as an old set i never build brick monsterscreatures but this set had such a nice assortment of parts that i had to pick a couple up as they werent clearancing out on shop  home i absolutely love dark orange and tan so it was an automatic win i love the use of familiar characters in the review i can almost hear hinckley screaming my megabloks p you sort of look like youre planning some vulture stew though might have to start a new challenge to determine a winner there sinner and his big pot o doom vs giant vulture only thing is does everything horrify the mrs she seems perpetually shocked andor dismayed at the goings on here now that i think about it i can see why im occasionally shocked andor dismayed 8 brick built beasties on y	positive

lego 75915 pteranodon capture im glad to review this nice set 75915 pteranodon capture name pteranodon capture set number 75915 pieces 174 price 1999 minifigs 2 theme jurassic world year of release 2015 links box the front of the box has the jurassic world logo along with the set number piece count etc its a decent box size for a 20 set here it is compared to a minifigure heres the back of the box it shows all of the features from the set an ad for the video game the back also shows a small picture with a silhouette of the dinosaurs from the line along with their set numbers instruction booklet the booklet shows the same thing as the front of the box nothing more nothing less near the back of the booklet there is a picture with all of the characters from the sets the other page shows all the dinosaurs with a mini box that shows the size comparisons the minifigures the minifigures in this set are simon masrani and an acu both of them have excellent printing on the front and the back the gun is the same one from tlm that the ssp used simon masrani is the only one with a double sided face his second face shows a scaredworried expbbression he has a zipped up jacket or jumpsuit with a shirt underneath the acu trooper only has one face which is a scaredworried expbbression i would have a scared expbbression too if i was about to get eaten by a dinosaur he has great detail on his torso and legs lets take a look at the vest the vest is the same mold from the ssp in tlm i think it has the letters acu on the front too the back is nothing interesting pteranodon the pteranodon has great printing too the colors match the ones that the pteranodons from the movie have the wings mouth and head are a rubbery type of plastic and are easily bendable it uses the same mold from the pteranodon in the 2012 dino line heres a comparison between the two spare parts the spare parts arent many just a few extras the helicopter at first the helicopter was meh when i first saw it on the box now that ive built it ive got to say that i really like it its my favorite helicopter of all of the ones ive built its sturdy and sleek its not too bulky either the first play feature in this set is the net launcher it works pretty well not one of my favorite features but it does what its meant to do the other play feature is on the other side its a stud shooter which can be used by a minifigure you can put it on their hand or you can leave it there and let someone operate it the shooter can fold up inside the helicopter as well there are stickers on both sides of the helicopter and they also have the jurassic world logo with dino marks final verdict value 910  for 20 this set isnt that bad the parts count is a little low for a 20 set but the price is probably because of licensing other than that its a great deal i wouldve hoped for maybe some bait for the pteranodon but that can easily be fixed design 910  i really love the way this helicopter looks its sleekness and design is great the only flaw this has is the huge net launcher its too big in my opinion minifigs 1010b  the minifigures are extremely detailed and it even includes an exclusive minifigure playability 910  there are many things you can do with this set the swoosh factor is great and so are the play features parts 1010b  theyre useful parts and there isnt many huge specialized pieces in here either overall 910  this set is great for fans of jurassic world its also a nice parts pack theres one exclusive minifigure in here too which makes it even better having a little fun with the set hope you liked my first review here on eurobricks please leave any suggestions on what to improve thanks edited by thelazychicken 02 may 2015  1019 pm	positive
thanks for the review i really like this set i love the acu minifigures and the dinosaur is really nice i think the helicopter has great potential for a shield helicopter only suggestion is that some of your pictures are a little bit dark especially the box front one but really good for your first review thanks a lot	positive
i love the dinos in these sets but aside from that the builds imo kind of suck just like the last dino sets this just has a franchise connected to it and honestly i hope it does well enough to spark more dinojurassic parkworld interest because i want to see more dino minifigures maybe a brontosaurus or something i will most likely be buying many of the dinosaur minifigures here however i doubt ill buy the actual sets or the genetically altered dinosaur which can only work for jurassic world this set is imo average love the dinosaur	negative

yesterday i went to toys r us and bought the dilophosaur ambush beside that the shop had a display of the jw polybags for €349 i picked up two of them now here is my little review of this pretty nice set first some data line jurassic world year 2015 pieces 29 price €349 packaging polybag ok lets start with the polybag itself it is a standard size and had plenty of room for all the parts the front depicts the whole set with a little hexagon on the right with a seperate picture of the dinosaur and its name in this case the celophysis is called gallimimus weird choice next is the instruction sheet it is a doublesided paper with every building step in clear sight the part selection is nice there are only a few but all of them are pretty usefull for all kind of builds there are two parts which stoodout both are printed tiles the first one is the yellowblack warning tile in 1x4 you cant have enough of that the second one is a 2x2 tile with the jurassic world logo on it thats pure awesome the bigger sets seem to have only sticker for that so this little set is a perfect way to get hold of this nice tile the leftovers nothing special here is the complete trap it is a basic build and functions pretty well in the end the parts are more interesting as the build so it will definitely end up as a partspack now on to the star of this bag the celophysisgallimimus i dont know why lego decided to call this dinosaur mold any different but i think it has to do with movieconnection and the will to not produce a new mold nevermind this figure is great and the colour is very bright and totally stood out pretty beastie a comparison between the 2015 gallimimus and the 2012 celophysis the final set in all its glory final verdict it is a great little set the parts used a nice and usefull the printed tiles are the secret stars of this set and the dinosaur is fun two with a few packs of these you could easily build a celophysis pack with lots of jurassic world signs on their way highly recommended	positive

lego 31036 creator toy and grocery shop thanks to eurobricks for making this review possible for years lego has offered a house of some sort in the creator line each year  with the standard creator 3in1 instructions thats given us a very wide variety of housing in 2014 they added a business option with their 31026 bike shop and cafe set this continues into this years toy and grocery shop set these shops are smaller than the very detailed modular buildings but that should help them fit in better with the other city sets and this also lets them get into more kids cities with their lower pricetag name toy and grocery shop set number 31036 pieces 466 price 3999 minifigs 2 theme creator year of release 2015 links bricklink peeron brickset the box the front of the box shows the a version model out of the three plus insets of the b and c versions i like the sortaeuropean looking backdrop it goes well with the styling of the buildings interestingly the main model is shown opened up for play while the two insets show those versions folded the box top on the top of the box lego helpfully shows that with 3 of these sets you can make a whole street the box back on the back you get to again see all three versions together but this time folded its a little creepy though with those clones running around  the manuals yep three actual printed manuals theres nothing indicating them as being a b and c models but its pretty obvious looking at the designs which is the main model and which are the alternates the contents bags of parts and two plates nothing terribly exciting to see here the minifigs nothing new here but two nice figs nonetheless well bricklink does say that both figs are unique to this set but theres not any new parts to them the closest thing to rare is the female head  its only in this set 2013s dragon mountain castle set a uk store grand opening set and one of the 2014 holiday freebie sets the faces arent that unique but i guess this exact combo of two faces on the head is i love the kid torso with the spaceman on it the minifig backs no back printing on anything here except for an alternate female face sorry i do like that her two faces are so different though thats much better than when a head has a scared and a more scared face the c build enough with the basics lets build im going to review them in the same order i built them backwards since you can tell immediately looking at the 3 designs that theyre going to use different numbers of pieces and so forth i figured id build the smallest first lest it seem like a letdown all three have some basic similarities  the two plates are hinged to give a building that opens for play they also do have interiors which you can see starting to form here the c build front its a pretty quick build so its done already heres the front of the building with it opened up like this it appears to be two separate stores a newsstand and some sort of shop you can enter all the printed tiles help give the newsstand a detailed appearance but im not sure why theyve got a 100 bill lying on the ledge the c build rear from the back side the interiors are pretty plain the shop half has a plant in a jar and a weird chair and the newsstand just has a register the c build sides heres the two sides of the folded building on the hinge side theres a bunch of windows in a disjointed wall with random colors on the other why did they put in a huge window when the set does include a transclear door that could have gone there and you get a small patch of plants like so many sets seem to have these days the c build extras thats a lot of leftovers there and not just little stuff  multiple doors stairs etc and unused sand green is always a little sad the b build 1 a pretty similar start with the hinge and little garden and some tiles along the ground the b build 2 now we see a big windowed wall some details like lights and how it has the usual alternate model weird part usage  like a 1x4 brick with side studs being used over the doorway even though those side studs will not get used the b build front the finished building gives us a nice little post office with a lettercarrying bird on the roof hope thats not their normal method of delivery something about the colors just doesnt work for me though the combo of white  light grey  dark grey  black  sand green plus tan is just too much the tan window and door frames i dont like the b build inside on the inside things are weird the counter on the left is ok but the light above the door with a yellow clip ugly is too big and everything else over there by the door doesnt make much sense either the b build sides i like the front side here except the colors are still too much the bench greenery mailbox on the corner and streetlight are all nice the boy is a little creepy though  binoculars in hand plus a telescope on the roof of the post office why the hinge side shows more of the weird colors you get in the wall but thats going to be hidden when the set is open plus we even see that on big modulars at times so its not so terrible the b build leftovers again a lot of leftover parts its obvious this was another alternate but itd be nice to see more of them used to make a bigger building but lets move on to the model that does use them all the a build 1 the first half starts like this maybe its just my bias but it already feels like a more detailed build bottles on the wall the yellow and red awning over the window etc the a build 2 the other half starts off with detailed work too i think thats a red vending machine the stairs are also very solidly built i also appreciate the effort to get that diagonal base where a door will be  its such a nice touch to have sections of a building that arent right angles the a build 3 not too much has been added but i wanted to showcase the tiny toys before they get hidden by a wall that robot and train are just fantastic little micro builds the a build 4 things are coming together quickly the walls windows and doors get the first floor nearly done im still not big on the sand green and tan combo but i do really like the red and yellow awnings the a build 5 it appears the shop owner lives upstairs since weve got a bedroom forming here the bed is a little plain but the table and lamp on the other half are great and my big fingers did not like putting all those railings on the balcony with the telescope posts and tile tops knocked quite a few off before i got them all done the a build front and its done all the details make this set really feel like a minimodular the roofline has great greebling and the shop contents and on and on its not perfect though the tiny car above the toy store door isnt nearly as good as the toys inside and the kids yellow scooter the wheels arent even on the ground much less able to roll the scooter looks decent though so that counts for something well at least as long as you are at this angle since the boys only got 1 foot on the 1 stud wide scooter the a build inside most of the interior has been seen already the roof though does a nice job of being interesting for a roof a skylight the edge rails etc and you can see theres not much wrong color in the walls the a model sides an interesting building when folded up very tall and skinny you can tell its not really meant to be displayed this way  its meant to be open the good  lots i like the awning the diagonal door the flowerbox under the upper window the folding gate on the balcony that lets it be used in open or closed mode and the green  white  blue colors the bad  well the stairs end short of the upper door i still dont really like the tan doorframes i think black would have been better and why dont the upper floors match up in size the a model leftovers ah thats more like it just a few small pieces left as spares the errors you might have to click through to the fullsize versions but i did catch a few weird errors in the manuals first in the photo of the newsstand the map in the front corner is on there sideways the map does have a clear north arrow printed on it on the second image the boys feet are hanging off the edge just unusual to see an alignment error in the manual like that the comparison here are this set and the modular detective office side by side theres a huge difference  as youd expect but is the difference more than youd expect this set is 466 parts 40 the do is 2262 pieces and 160 5 times the parts 4 times the price looking at them side by side id expect a bigger difference in both the conclusion so whats my conclusion on this model i love the main model but the alternates are meh its a nice set for someone looking for a town building other than police and fire stations but who isnt ready to move to the modular line compared to the modulars though it seems overpriced part of that is because the huge modulars are actually a great deal compared to other lego sets im also a little surprised that its so small when you compare it to the city sets like a police station those are generally designed with much more open space letting them be more of a playset this one is small and cramped so itd be tougher to play in its not really a city set though the ratings value 710  its under the 10 cents a part mark but thats largely due to having a ton of tiny parts all those flowers and decorative 1x1 round studs add up quickly design 710  good and bad on the colors and theres a big difference between the quality of the main vs alternate models having so many leftover pieces is one thing when the creator set makes 3 very different models ie a boat plane and truck when its 3 buildings it seems wasteful to have so many parts leftover minifigs 610  im not sure they both fit the set i suppose the boy is going to the toy store and the woman is going to the grocery but theres no storekeeper in either the woman doesnt look like a storekeeper to me so thats why i assume shes another shopper i love the boy but the woman is just soso  except that i do appreciate the head having two very different expressions but again that doesnt fit the set i cant see her scared face being used playability 610  the shops are detailed with registers and so forth but its all so tiny itd be hard to play with the figs in it parts 910  tons of windows and doors plus nice sand green bricks but some things the large blue curves used on the roof for example are weirdly specialized and would be hard to use in another building design overall 710  id recommend doing what i did  build the alternates first then the main since thats how youll want to leave it id really like to see the price a little lower compared to other sets again the part count is inflated due to so many tiny parts and the finished building is tiny but its loaded with neat details	positive
any chance you have a picture of the news stand next to the detectives office building as i would love to see the scaling for that	neutral

stevkir on 04 may 2015  0806 am said any chance you have a picture of the news stand next to the detectives office building as i would love to see the scaling for that sorry i do not  but itd be tiny and not look like the same scale johnny6666 on 04 may 2015  0959 am said it feels like a mishmash of bricks with no clear design aesthetic and as such blatantly underdeveloped ie designed to hit a pricebrick count point rather than provide a solid set in the creator town tradition compared to other creator sets at this price point 31025  mountain hut for example it feels utterly uninspired and ugly well i felt like the main model almost got to good looking  id replace some of the tan with black but otherwise im ok with that one	neutral
cheers for putting in the time to create a wonderful review i am not a huge fan of this set i like the colour combinations but it all seems a bit alltoosimple it can and will be nicely modularised though	negative
lightningtiger on 04 may 2015  1255 pm said thanks mostlytechnic for this review i only brought this set to continue the shop series from creator in my opinion its only half as good as the bike shopcafe one plus it doesnt fit the same as that pair of shops oh well maybe next year lego creator will have a better one brick on review on mostlytechnic  well it is only half the price of the bikecafe one too  but i agree it seems odd that theyve made a couple shop creator sets that dont fit together in style like this i guess theyve done that for years with the creator houses though  none of those really work together david thomsen on 04 may 2015  0133 pm said reviews for this set really should picture them next to the bike shop  cafe which its intended to be compatible with right down to the size of the baseplates and grey tiles around the edge it doesnt look that great on its own but if you add the two sets together you get something that begins to look like a street scene interesting to get two comments right in a row with opposite opinions  i dont have the bikecafe set but to me they dont looks like theyd really go together theyre the same concept two buildings that fold in half but the sidewalk is different size and they just feel differently styled to me	negative
as a fan of creator houses i really want to like this set however i think that creator houses have long filled a niche thats neglected elsewhere residential houses we havent had a larger residential house since 2013 im not sure if these sets have anything to do with that but it seems like they may be the replacement for larger houses and id much rather have a larger house set than a set like this i also agree with many others here something about it just feels incomplete i think that the various city business buildings weve gotten in recent years including those in this years city squarewhich is much more expensive than this but also contains much more make for better buildings at this scale	positive
asuka on sep 13 2007 0115 pm said but although i loved the last years one i think they could do another theme or perhaps even two calendars because right now castles pretty hot imo really hope they do different themes next year but not sure how theyd managed 24 different minisets for castle can envisage 78 minifigs but what else	neutral

andy0306uk on sep 13 2007 0136 pm said really hope they do different themes next year but not sure how theyd managed 24 different minisets for castle can envisage 78 minifigs but what else yeah i guess this would need a little more out of the box thinking than tlcs doing usually for their castle line things that are similar to the city theme and more civil life based like some blacksmith equipment market place bakery farmer and so on but a wizard workshop a hidden treasure and some medieval furniture would also work fine and an evil santa with spiders and coal pieces as gifts and a sledge pulled by a dragon of course d	neutral

thanks andy for the review i prefer the city advent calendar 2006 a lot those mini sets are nor good for me the road subtheme sets are nice but the others not so good the 05 version waf ok the 06 version was better with bigger sets and more building ones and the 07 is poor its just 23 pieces to put together on 2x4 plates where are the gardening accessories where are some nice small constructions that you can put in your layout like a mailbox or an orodator and the chrismas tree looks x imo and no santa y for andy n for this calendar	negative

im a big fan of anime and have watched some mechas like full metal panic neon evangelion genesis it is a mecha and chobits well she is a robot so i was curious to see what this new exo force line was all about the colorful sets and mangalike characters didnt persuade me right away but the urgent need for a couple of white 3x3 wing plates made me purchase this little thing it cost me 70 dkr as you can see on the box this is 930 euro or about the same an american has to pay for the new republic cruiser pretty expensive for so few pieces 90  a spare technic pin the box an actionpacked box with one of the sides being oddly empty except from the legologo whats inside there is a small building instruction two polybags no bag building here and a sticker sheet with alarmingly many stickers the build it takes so little time to build this set that i didnt get to take any pictures of the process every step was accompanied by an element description although i doubt most of you will need that with so few pieces to keep track on most of the dark green bricks have a sticker  even the slopes where the rough surface makes stickers fall off easily there should also have been a sticker on the windshield but i wanted to keep that piece clean for better usage later im one of those who keeps stickers on the bricks the model you want to see this model from the front as the back is pretty much neglected there isnt much for the pilot to grab a hold on either he is pretty much a sitting duck up there with the screen giving him only partial cover there is a huge wrench next to him which kind of symbolizes the crudeness of the mech the set isnt called cyclone defender for nothing the right arm might hold an ordinary light assault riffle but the other has a spinning disc with samurai swords which you can turn with the yellow knob on the backside those of you who have seen robot wars might remember the incredible power of this melee weapon from a robot named hypnodisc it would have been nice had there been a pullback motor to power the disc im sure lego has a lot of these in stock but the simple mechanism still works reasonably well the riffle comes off and a pin makes it easy to hold with the hand but the disc is fixed to the arm it is also a problem that the swords get misaligned quickly during play the minifig i really like this minifig because of the neat idea with an expression on each side that lego has made a standard for exo force posability most mechmocers show off their creations using gundamlike poses with two joints per leg one being the ankles and one for an arm i thought of some less serious poses crawling silent like a ninja belly gliding kick off upside down final rating i have to disappoint you here this is my first set in this line and i have absolutely no idea of how good it is the last robot i bought was the awesome 6889 spyrius recon robot for the same price but it is in a completely different genre the set had what i expected two white wings and is as such a nononsense set i guess it would be of more use if you have some more exo force which i dont 610 ups has great minifig weapons and is easy to build downs crude design and a bit too expensive for what you get brickshelf gallery	neutral

930 euro is msrp here in denmark 7 euro would have resulted in a nicer reception from my part but the strong marked position of lego in its homeland together with the general high prices because some of us are supposedly rich makes the prices less bearable it is funny you should mention germany i thought the prices for lego were even higher there im sure i paid more than msrp last time i bought lego from from your country on the other hand the last thing i bought was the 5521 model team sea jet from 1993	neutral

a fine set a great review and good additional pictures thanks lasse d and sinner teamwork on y	positive
thank you sinner for bringing the pictures of the hovercraft i think it is a really cool model but the steering wheel doent work too well it doesnt turn easilly all the way around and when the craft turns it doesnt stay stable on the three wheels because the front wheel turns quite alot into the opposite side now to the third model this is quite a basic helicopter with the functionality of having the rotors turning it doesnt use that many of the bricks and doesnt even have a landing gear i have a question to all of you as you can see i prefer to show one or two large pictures and have the rest as clickable thumbnails most people use only the relatively big typically 640x480 pictures so that you dont have to follow links what do you prefer it is no problem for me to do it the other way but i would like to know if you have any preferences	neutral

3499 is not too shabby the big guy itself is nice but the gem of the set is the mech really nice mech i must say great for posing the mini figs suprisingly nice little buildvehicle never seen this element beforeits probably nothing new though lol no articulation of the legs nooooooo phew the front two legs do articulate would of been bad if they didnt overall i give the set 7810 not the best but its actually quite nice and the yellow mech is awesome if it was him on his own then 9410 cheers	positive

it is no secret that marvel is one of the most successful companies right now from the avengers to the xmen and down to even the most obscure characters like antman every one of their movies has been a big hit until now the latest marvel movie fant4stic was released last month and while i have not seen it yet im sure its just as great as their other movies i mean it has the word fantastic in the title after all and being the smart business that they are the lego company decided to get in on the hype early and capitalize on this movies undoubtful success two years in advance by making a set featuring fant4stics main villain dr doom now thats what i call forward thinking but did they do a good job with it or were they being overhasty lets find out set number 76005 name spiderman daily bugle showdown theme marvel super heroes subtheme ultimate spiderman year of release 2013 pieces 476 minifigs 5 price 4999 usd sh description quote swing into the daily bugle and stop dr doom™ dr doom™ and his henchman beetle™ are attacking the daily bugle in their speedy jet to steal spidermans™ secret identity its up to spiderman™ and nova™ to swing in and stop them trigger the daily bugles explosion functions to cause destruction as the jet fires missiles stop dr doom™ from hitching the jets anchor hook to the safe with spidermans secret inside knock beetle™ off the building with the swinging web attack and drop dr doom™ inside with the rooftop trapdoor then fly nova™ in through the broken window with the dumpster catapult function and send those villains back to where they came from includes spiderman™ nova™ dr doom™ beetle™ and j jonah jameson™ with accessories and weapons the first thing that comes to mind after reading this description is wow thats a lot of tms anyway here are some resource links for this set brickset bricklink rebrickable the box since this set is based on the ultimate spiderman cartoon the box has the usual usm design with the red marvel super heroes background an illustration of spidey in the upper right corner and the usm logo in the lower right as usual there is a minifig line up in the lower left and since this was before the terrible redesign you can see the full body of the minifigs i really miss this type of line up there is quite a lot going on here doctor doom attacking the daily bugle in his jet while simultaneously reaching for j jonah jameson below with his jets claw spiderman reluctantly swings in to save him while nova fights off the beetle its a pretty cool scene even though its not very accurate to the show in beetle mania the episode that this set is based on the beetle was indeed out to kill jjj but it was in order to stop him from exposing his identity not spidermans although spidey was next on jjjs list and while he is a recurring villain on the show doctor doom had nothing to do with this plot and didnt even appear in the episode aside from a brief cameo its awesome that they included him anyway though so im not gonna complain note that the tower is so tall that it wraps around the top of the box there you can also see a scale reference with the spiderman minifig on the back of the box you can see the interior of the bugle and all of its play features which there are quite a few of since this is a playset its all illustrated pretty well although legos choice of sound effects is still a mystery to me i dont get why they dont go for spidermans signature fwip instead of fazzing and i didnt know that a breaking window made the sound btoom but i digress contents inside the box you will find three instruction booklets one smaller than the others a comic book a fairly large sticker sheet five numbered bags and two loose pieces a white string piece and a gray 16x8 plate there arent really any notable pieces and nobody cares about the comic bock no offense to the artist so lets get right to the instructions they are pretty straight forward and easy to follow some of the pages have a ghostly image of spidey nova and dr doom in the top right corner which is fitting since these are all minifigs that appear in this set which is strangely not something that can be said for many other super heroes instructions with this type of artwork minifigures as with most super heroes sets most people will get this set mainly for the minifigs so without further ado lets talk about them spiderman is the same old bootless one you get in almost every usm set not much to say about him some might complain that we dont get spideys alter ego peter parker in this set but in the usm cartoon mj is actually the one who works at the daily bugle not peter curse the creators of this cartoon for ruining our chances of getting a new peter parker minifig by trying to mix things up next we get j jonah jameson he appeared in a spiderman 2 set before but this is a complete redesign he now has a blue suit with a red tie a unique face print and that combedback hair in dark gray this new hairpiece doesnt suit him at all and the old flat top hair was perfect for him in my opinion so i dont know why they changed it the good thing about this change however is the fact that this piece is exclusive to this set in that color nova on the other hand is spoton he comes with a new helmet mold and some nice torso printing however he too is missing his boots tlc should have started making dualcolored legs a long time ago here are some reference images to compare them to okay so jjjs hair may not be completely black in the show but i still think they should have given his minifig a black hairpiece his suit is also not quite the right color he rarely appears in person in the show including the episode this set is based on and is usually seen on screens around new york so this is the best picture of him i could find i guess i should be happy they included a minifig of him at all in the episode it was actually mary jane who was at the bugle during beetles attack so it would have made more sense to include her but we got her in the spidercopter set one year later so thats ok all three of them have back printing in jjjs case im using that term loosely since it is only comprised of two lines but its nice that they went through the trouble of adding them both jjj and nova come with angry alternate faces it almost looks like theyre trying to outangry each other who do you think looks angrier let me know in the comments section below now lets talk about the bad guys even though he would be better off in a fantastic four set its great to finally get victor van doom one of the greatest marvel villains ever and in comics in general he comes with a dark green hood which was new and exclusive in that color at the time and he is the only minifig in this set that has leg printing beetle is a regular minifig with wings the metallic printing on his face and torso is pretty nice but i wish it would have continued onto his legs as well the beetle looks quite accurate to his onscreen counterpart the only thing that could have improved him is a new helmet mold with pointy eyebrowsantennae doctor doom however looks nothing like he does in the movie i just dont understand how lego could have messed him up so badly maybe they were working off of early concept art or something here is a back view of doom and beetle beetle would be a pretty boring minifig if it wasnt for his wings which are awesome with their holographic texture they are so mesmerizing i could look at those things all day this piece also appeared in trans light green in the galaxy squad sets which came out at the same time here they are without their gear as you can see they both have back printing as well and no doctor doom does not come with an alternate facial expression which is fine since you cant see much of his expressions due to his mask anyway heres a look at dr doom and nova without their headgear some say that dooms face looks too cartoony but i think it looks fine nova is wearing stylish goggles as a way of explaining his white eyes its a far better explanation than the batsweatband they did the same thing with the masked wolverine later here are all the figs with their accessories jjj comes with a camera so that he can take more pictures of spiderman beetle comes with one of those overused adu guns which is a very poor representation of his wristmounted blasters i hate to say it but even those bulky new stud shooters would have been a better representation of his weapons spidey comes with his usual string of webbing and nova comes with some iron man style translucent studs the weird thing is that they are red while his powers have a blue glow in the show doctor doom sadly doesnt get any accessories but who needs weapons when you have a jet with a claw and flickfire missiles the build the first bag contains spiderman a brick separator and the parts to build the ground floor of the dbc building after a quick and straightforward build you get this the dumpster and street lamp are separate from the building and since the lamp post is not built onto any baseplate and is quite topheavy it gets knocked over pretty easily maybe its meant to be that way but i would have preferred it if you could stick it onto the baseplate of the building on which there is unfortunately not enough space to do so as you would expect the second bag has the parts for the first floor of the building this is also the bag that contains beetle after another fairly simple build youll find yourself with a two story building with a spiderweb one side and a fire escape on the other however you have to apply three stickers during this section of the build which is never fun can you guess whats in bag number 3 yup the second floor of the building you dont need superpowers to predict that one also this bag contains nova and jameson the build of this section is a bit repetitive since the second floor is mostly the same as the first and it takes slightly longer to build since you have to build the rooftop as well also in addition to the two window stickers you have to apply ten 2x2 tile stickers trying to do this without having any of them being crooked is a real pain in the megablocks the next bag contains doctor doom and the cockpit of his jet dooms cape is in the usual square white box and the string for the claw is folded up in a piece of tape heres what you get at the end of this section looks more like an escape pod than a jet at this point the final bag is the smallest as it only includes the few parts needed to finish the doom jet once you build the wings and tail you stick them onto the cockpit via technic pins and youre done spare parts these are the parts that are left over after the build there is the brick separator of course an extra antenna and the usual little bits and bops whats really awesome though is that they give you an extra pair of beetles wings considering what a neat piece this is and that this is the only set in which it comes in transblack make this a very welcome spare that you can use in your customs the finished set here is the complete set the dbc building looks quite tall especially when you count the antenna comparing it to a screenshot from the episode the general look of the building is there although there are some inaccuracies aside from the fact that it is obviously way downscaled the screens that show jjj ranting about spiderman should have been hexagonal not square and should have wrapped around the building however considering how many stickers you would have had to apply if they would have made it accurate im actually glad they kept the screen mercifully small much like doctor doom himself the doom jet didnt actually appear in the beetle mania episode however it did appear in a later episode titled not a toy in which spiderman plays around with captain americas shield accidentally drops it in doctor dooms latvarian embassy and has to try to retrieve it and yes that episode was as godawful as it sounds heres a screenshot of the jet from that episode like with the dbc they managed to capture the general shape of the vehicle although it doesnt look quite as good as in the show the color scheme is too dark and it looks kind of blockier lets take a closer look at the jet there is no real way to reel the claw in unfortunately however there is a stud on the back of the jet that you can stick it onto needless to say this is not the ideal way of storing it i would have much preferred it if they would have attached it onto winch instead the engines on the wings can be turned even though they dont turn in the show and there is a flickfire missile on each side even if its not much to look at at least its a very swooshable vehicle on top of each wing there is a tile with the emblem of latvaria there was no such emplems on the jet in the cartoon but they are useful pieces that make it clear whose jet it is so im glad they included them there is nothing inside the cockpit except for a seat and unless you want to ruin dr dooms nice dark green cape i wouldnt put him inside of it they could have at least printed a control panel onto that empty 2x2 tile play features since this is a playset lets look at all the play features it has to offer like all playsets the building is open in the back so you can play inside on the ground floor there is a potted plant and nothing else seriously is this all they could come up with for this floor they could have included a security desk a lounge a second plant or anything else as it is its just a boring empty lobby the first floor is a bit more interesting there is a safe a swiveling chair and a pin board with various pictures of spiderman there is one tile that reads the true identity of spiderman which is supposedly what the villains are after i wonder how jameson got this information in the first place speaking of jameson the second floor is devoted to his office where he can sit and yell at his nonpresent employees demanding more pictures of spiderman it also has a swiveling chair as well as a desk with a lamp and a computer there is a technic beam connecting his desk with the ceiling of the first floor which you can remove in order to take off the upper half of the building but its difficult to do so i dont recommend it as you may have noticed in the picture above there are a few red pegs sticking out of the building these are for triggering the play features most of them are on the roof there is one on what looks like an air conditioning unit if you place spiderman holding is webstring on the jumper plate in front of it and push the peg spidey goes bungeejumping off the building wee there is also one that sticks out of the side of the building which when pulled triggers a trap door the third red peg on the roof can be used to pop off the dbc sign why is it called the dbc you ask it stands for daily bugle communications since in this version of spiderman the daily bugle is not only a newspaper but a news tv station as well one that promotes its own highly biased views so basically the fox news of the marvel universe i guess if youre an old school spiderman fan you could just leave off the c and have it just stand for daily bugle the sign above the main entrance wont be so easily modified however there is also a peg between the first and second floor which when pushed pops out one of the windows on the first floor the safe is only attached to a couple of jumper plates and has some jumper plates on top of it as well so you can easily attach the doom jets claw to it and rip it out of the building as seen on the back of the box there are also some snot bricks on the corners of the building that you can attach spiderwebs or spidey himself onto for some wallcrawling and webslinging action this is not so much a play feature as it is just a feature but as i mentioned earlier there is a fire escape on the left side of the building this was a neat idea as it helps it feel like a building in new york city but it is executed very poorly there is no hole big enough for the minifigs to climb down through so they would have to climb down the ladders from the outside which makes no sense no wonder spiderman always needs to rescue people from burning buildings there is one more play feature in the form of the dumpster you can open the lid put a minifig inside and make them jump by hitting a tab in the back remember this is before the introduction of super jumpers but nevertheless its a pretty strange place to launch minifigs out of i guess even super heroes like to do some dumpster diving you dont think this was funny no well me neither but thats the type of humor that this show loves to use sigh anyway lets get on to the ratings ratings design 25  the set looks ok despite many inaccuracies the dbc building and the jet somewhat resemble their onscreen counterparts and dont look too bad but they definitely could be better build 15  a mostly unchallenging and repetitive build with an attrocious amount of stickers minifigs 45  definitely the strongest point of the set some of the figs could be better but four out of five of them are exclusive to this set doctor doom is easily the best and probably the most desirable one  unless the fant4stic movie portraits him so badly that nobody will be interested in him but thats impossible playability 45  as you would expect from a playset the playability is quite high although i still feel like there could have been more parts 35  not many rare parts if youre looking for parts for building your own skyscraper with tan walls and lots of doors and windows though this set is for you price 35  at 476 parts for 50 this set is a bit pricey but it is somewhat justified by all the large window and wall pieces overall 35  this set is mediocre at best playsets are always a good choice for spiderman sets since they give spidey something to swing from but unfortunately they are rarely pulled off well the jet is blocky the building is barebones and the price feels too high the only reason to get this set are the four exclusive minifigs this set was discontinued early this year but if you still see it on clearance somewhere go ahead and get one for the minifigs and parts or buy multiples and use the parts to build a better dbc building i hope you enjoyed this review it is part of the reviewers academys 7th anniversary were not doing a big celebration this year due to other commitments but look out for more reviews with the 7th anniversary banner soon now if youll excuse me i am off to see fant4stic i hope its as fantastic as it promises to be 2 hours later i was wrong i was horribly horribly wrong	positive
hahah entertaining and informative a great read thanks for the review on a side note i thought fantfourstic wasok on the poorer side of ok the exposition felt like it was from a 3 hour film because it was so long and towards the middle it started to drag the ending was terrible edited by mutant orc 12 september 2015  0953 pm	positive
this set is from 2013 doctor doom is completely based off the comic version tv show version not the movie in any way anyways nice review i personally own this set and its a nice set but could have been better edited by aegis2000 13 september 2015  0233 am	neutral
yeah im really hoping the concept artdoom minifig joke is just that i picked this set up on whim mostly because a needed a building to add to a moc as a parts pack its not a bad set at all	positive
i actually am surprised at the poor points this set has gotten as this is one of my favorite sets that marvel has put out i actually would like to hear what your thoughts are on the usm  lego dr doom comparison oky thanks for the review httpmarvelanimateordoomusmpng edited by zorglorfian 14 september 2015  0644 am	neutral
thanks everyone darthbrickus on 13 september 2015  0253 pm said thanks for the review ive had that set for quite a while and its among my favorite marvel superheroes sets actually compared to the other stuff we usually get to accompany the minifigs all those laboratorys the most recent construction site and the hydra fortress  yeah youre being a little harsh here perhaps youre right maybe i was a bit too harsh on this set dont get me wrong its not a bad set especially compared to some other sets we have gotten in this price range but somehow i was still expecting more darthbrickus on 13 september 2015  0253 pm said maybe youre still suffering from ptsd after watching fantfourstic i still have not seen it actually and i dont ever plan to so dont worry no okys were harmed in the making of this review im a brickmaster on 13 september 2015  0355 am said yeah im really hoping the concept artdoom minifig joke is just that yes the whole doctor doomfant4stic thing was obviously a joke everybody knows what doctor doom is supposed to look like except for the makers of fant4stic apparently zorglorfian on 14 september 2015  0644 am said i actually would like to hear what your thoughts are on the usm  lego dr doom comparison oky thanks for the review httpmarvelanimateordoomusmpng theres not much to say really doom in usm looks just like he does in the comics and lego recreated that look perfectly again hes definitely the best part of this set	neutral
im glad you were joking about doom im not that big of a fanboy but i had the need to correct you for some reason with that said i bought this set for the minifigures a few years ago looking back i dont really care about the figures today like i did in 2013 the building is decent for the size of the set though thanks for the review	neutral
for those of you who are old enough to remember system shock next on maury whos the father edited by darthbrickus 15 september 2015  0528 pm	neutral
overall i wish marvel in particular would have more playsets in its theme batman has several great ones in the dc theme but then again if this is the best playset to date for marvel maybe its better just to leave well enough alone i would definitely like to see them attempt something in the 100 us price range because i think it could be good marvel needs an equivalent to the arkham asylum set regarding this set i saved myself some money and bought the 4 minifigs i needed all but spidey on bricklink for less than half the set price edited by dmarvin 17 september 2015  0625 pm	neutral
personally i thought your review was spot on and i very much enjoyed your tone im not usually much of a minifig person but i will admit i bought this set mostly for dr doom and considered nova a bonus growing up i was a big fan of the fantastic four and an even bigger fan of dr doom i hope that someday the film rights will revert to marvel and well finally get a ff film that respects the original source material and features a dr doom worthy of the name as for the set itself i dont have much use for playsets not that theres anything wrong with them i think the marvel lego line could use more of them in fact and i didnt even realize it was linked to a specific show as ive fallen a bit out of touch with the franchise of late i bought it i built it it sat a shelf for a while i scrapped it for parts i think most of it wound up as a greenhouse for my winter village setup its not a bad set but i think you summed things up nicely when you called it mediocre thanks for the entertaining review	neutral
thanks for the reviewim not a big fan of spider man sets but this set really impressed me this must because of the design of this set and the minifigures that included in this set	positive
i think im the only person in the world who likes fant4stic was it the best superhero movie not even close but i didnt think it deserved the hate it got it was just incredibly and clumsily mishandled anyways great review i might pick this one up if only for the beetle fig	negative
this set seems to appeal more to the non superhero crowd it is one of the only marvel sets i bought mainly because i thought that the building was a nice return to the old style of city sets i would love to see this sort of backdrop for a more realistic agents theme i also liked that most of the figs in this set were easier to merge into other nonsuper uses thanks for the review god bless nathan	neutral
another great review oky i love this set	positive

hello everyone by now many excited lego star wars fans have started receiving their ucs falcon some of us here enjoy writing reviews and sharing our thoughts i mentioned to yoda that i was planning on doing a review of this set but it would likely take me a few weeks of 12 hours per night to finish building the set yoda suggested that i do the review as i go so everyone could see the progress of the set what a great idea so here is the first entry feel free to comment along the way i will try to post photos and updates every night on the build then wrap up the review when i complete the set if you have any specific questions or photo requests please be sure to ask ucs millennium falcon reviewed by dunamis set 10179 5195 pieces 49995 from lego shop at home the box obviously this is a box like no other first of all it comes in its own shipping carton inside of that there is a standard lego carton finally inside the lego carton we have the actual millennium falcon box and a nice little letter thanking you for buying the biggest lego set ever shipping box naboo set provided for scale lego carton and letter lego carton the millennium falcon box is really quite nice there are lots of photos and it does a good job of selling the set there are 8 individual pieces of tape that keep the lid on the box the limited first edition comes with a seal on the lower left corner millennium falcon box naboo set provided for scale lifting the lid straight up reveals one compartment of several bags on the right on the left we find a thin square box like a pizza box that contains the official certificate of authenticity two sticker sheets and one enormous manual under the pizza box we find two more compartments each filled with several typical lego bags the box weighs 24 pounds stickers pizza box pieces in compartments not quite sure what the little 30th anniversary sticker is for yet the certificate of authenticity is on heavy paper and is suitable for framing more to come tomorrow its late here	positive
good idea to make this review while you build the set ill be monitoring your progress and feedback the box so huge impressive	positive
nice review ill be watching and waiting for the rest	positive
many tks dunamis for doing that its really great and i cant wait monitoring your progress on the beast 8 like it was mentionned in another thread the box looks less gigantic than i thought  remember the isd box  that was a huge box  is the instruction book in the pizza box  how big is it  im sure its really big and i hope for our sake that the colours are clearly marked xd if you know what i mean d  tks againand im so looking forward to your next post  ras 74 on sep 27 2007 0851 am said you always seems to pull it of nicely in comparission with the exasperating yoda xd p what what what  have you stopped your medication once again xd yoda	positive

wow that box is big but i somehow thought it would be even bigger still it looks like for once lego are actully using all the space inside and not just a fraction like with other sets cant wait to see more dunamisyou lucky megablok 	neutral

tks for that comparison pic dunamis  ok the box is big  i pictured it a tad smaller though  i know what i dont like its the fact that it has the regular lego star wars logo on top with vader ucs sets should have a different iconography like they did in the past sure its a trivial detail but it adds to the fact of owning something special  after all its the most expensive set ever as of now  happy building  and well wait patiently for some cool pics later on p yoda	negative
very expecting indeed waiting for your kind photo  	neutral
wow i never thought id be impressed by a box but i certainly am now any chance of seeing all 5000 bricks in a big pile vader on sep 28 2007 1014 am said my gawd that manuel is huge thats enough to put a sane man off of buying this setthank gawd none of us are sane thats all i can say xd too true never had i imagined thinking about buying a 350 lego set beforechristmas is soo close yet soo far	positive
xwingyoda on sep 28 2007 0734 am said tks for that comparison pic dunamis  ok the box is big  i pictured it a tad smaller though  yoda i dont have the ucs isd but from the pic i can see that it is about the same thickness slightly shorter but much wider than the mf so this leads me to believe that dimensionwise the ucs mf is more compact also notice how in the content the parts fit in just nice without additional spare space for anything else strange isnt it that when tlc is responsible for the shipping we see optimum usage of box spaces xd imagine if all boxes were this efficient 499 sets would be no bigger than a match box xd xd the mtt would be reduced to 14 its current size xd xd xd	neutral
great review so far i am looking forward to additional posts as for the number of pins  from the peeron inventory for the set there are over 400 technic pins of various lengths insert the my fingers hurt from building emoticon keep the pictures coming	positive
the build the build is going quicker than i thought i am sorting as i open the bags that i need some bags are in multiples so it is easy to pick them out the build is a tad repetitive as the framework of the ship is somewhat symmetrical here are some progress shots note that two plates 1x4 and 1x8 are stacked in between technic beams then the part below is assembled to hold the structure together this took about an hour of sorting and building ill post another update tomorrow	positive
the minifigs as you can see the minifigs are really nice they even throw in an extra fleshie head no doubt these will fetch quite a bit on the bricklink and ebay markets im keeping mine continuing the build this photo shows how well this model is put together notice that they use four of the threehole beams per side to hold this together i remember reading that you can hang this model from the ceiling i dont doubt it these right angle technic pieces are used to reinforce the structure of the model you can see them used here i was shocked at how many light gray plates are in this set i have two tubs full of these the infrastructure is now complete i got hung up for about an hour looking for one of these turns out lego gave me an extra left wedge and shorted me a right wedge so frustrating i had to stead one off my 6211 star destroyer it is not a very common piece by the way	neutral
xwingyoda on sep 30 2007 1157 am said are these yellow parts new  i am not a technic fan and never saw these before you dont have the building crane 7905 either same color same shape there piece no 32555 four of them included i assume youre not a town fan p 	neutral
i have been taking photos for this review for a few months and i finally took the rest of the photos last night all the parts if you want tan this is the set to get main model the garage is a great addition but the car only just fits the main house is very nice looking the windows extend to the sides but not the back the chimney and drainage work very well and i love the basement i think the front works very well when i was making this i was multitasking doing weight training do a set do a step do a set and i ended up missing one of the row paths i discovered this after i finished the basement  the removable roof reveals byo floors probably why this is called a model house the roof was quite interesting to build this is my first large house set so it all was very new to me i love the garage door more nice pipework this photo i misfocused but there isnt much to see anyway the door is a nice touch the grill to the right on both sides is not just decoration as it hides the hinges for the door i also made one of the submodels i was considering keeping this but i decided against it once again the sides have windows but the back doesnt the truck is there to make the photo more worthwhile the roof to this one doesnt come off easily as all the tiles are used for the front just to clarify these houses arent attached so you can arrange them however you want the fronts are quite elaborate and it seems that lego were trying to make this almost like a simpler market street the truck is too small for a minifig but it probably was my favourite car thoughts i highly recommend this set in most countries it is good value for money including australia the design is excellent and three instructions are included the third is a school if anyone has made it and wants to post photos feel free at least one person at eb has made it i love how each house has its own car due to the way the primary model is made it is a bit weak at the corner but that was a design choice my only real complaint about this set is how lego is going though a mould transition and thus some roof slopes are rough others are smooth i can accept either and lego has been moving to smooth slopes for years now but to have a set with about 5050 is annoying the mtt was the same but that is my only gripe with this excellent set wub	positive
thanks for the review and tons of pics ive been wanting to pick this one up since i saw it i thought the 4956 creator house was nice but this model town house is in a completely different league i also like the alternate models that you can see in the catalogues	positive
thank you for the review sinner at first i wanted this set for the 4 blue 1x1 slope tiles but i can see there is much more into it than that it sure is a great value compared to what you get in the building bonanzas no cars and less detail it was funny to see the little side story in your pictures would it be hard to modify the cars to fit minifigs better	neutral
a beautiful and humorous review with very fine pics y a fantastic set full of neat details and in a wonderful color scheme great for every city builder for sure i guess we waited for sets like that we dreamed about them im glad we got them now  edit congrats it seems youve got your bucket back p	positive
i found the use of parts well done by the designers i made a car and then tried to make a house from a different instruction book i could not as several pieces were already used in the car nice to see them using all the parts like that rather than having a lot of extra bits moral of the story one instruction book at a time sweet	neutral
lasse d on sep 28 2007 0803 am said it sure is a great value compared to what you get in the building bonanzas no cars and less detail i was all for the white house until i saw this set i still wouldnt mind it though d lasse d on sep 28 2007 0803 am said would it be hard to modify the cars to fit minifigs better the problem with the blue truck is a lack of headroom however the truck is quite low and i cant see it being too hard to change and still have it looking good asuka on sep 28 2007 0830 am said great for every city builder for sure i guess we waited for sets like that we dreamed about them im glad we got them now  i think lego were really listening with this years creator sets wub with the exception of the ferris wheel they are all sets that you could buy 10 of and not have too many hard to use parts asuka on sep 28 2007 0830 am said edit congrats it seems youve got your bucket back p well in this reality anyway xd who knows what goes on in the wacker and walrus world but i do seem to be a tormented soul 	neutral
awesome review luckily you have two cute little friends and one beautiful lady to help you out p i likewise love wub this set and your review does it credit i laughed outloud a lot as i read it i especially love you trying to look through the windowless back d d d great job now sort that out and start building for our competition xd	positive
excellent review with great pics and cameo appearances by some of our eb favs y definitely a set that was on my to get list already and this only confirms that might make me want two just because i love tan so much and id like to see if something could be done to bulk up that car great job as always 	positive
thank you very much for the review sinner i definitly wub this set this will make a great addition for us townies i thought the size was too small i plan to make my house fit practically the whole baseplate plus i will definitly add floors that looked d  i cant believe tlc skimped on the floors	positive
thanks for this review sinner i love this house with the nicely made tiled corners the colorscheme and the garage the only thing i dislike about this set is the way the windows are attached in train windows so they turn inwards a little instead of the usual frames with shutterattachmentability but that is something that can be fixed in the blink of an eye i will certainly buy this house some day when i find it at reasonable price	positive
thanks for the review sinner y  although we had a not very detailed one already p i bought this set at tru with 20 off resulting in 54 xd definitely a must buy for every townie you get tons of useful parts to build other buildings as well shameless selfpromotion off  you have to love tan bricks though 8 moc on	positive
i too have bought this set and the only thing i notice which is a bit odd with the exception of there being no floors in the house is the lack of a steering wheel in the car	negative
thanks for the review sinner i definitely want this set now the mixed rough and smooth roof bricks would annoy me on a model like the mtt but here it looks as is if the roof is quite old with some parts being worn and pitted and some parts being replaced with new roof tiles i quite like the effect i agree on which is the best vehicle and if it doesnt fit minifigs just mod the heck out of it xd	positive
sweet looks like an awesome set i might get it i have to see looks like it has a lot of good parts zots	positive
thank you for the nice review i want this set too with al those tan bricks and black slopes and the cute blue car wub i like the old windows more i hope they dont stop producing them	positive

its that time of year again when the days get shorter the nights get colder and children all around the world stare longingly into warmly lit toy shops and prepare their wishlist to send to santa this is also the time when the lego group releases their latest winter village set which has been an annual tradition for the past seven years these sets have been very popular especially among afols and are always highly anticipated however while some entries in this series have been more popular than others none has been as controversial as this years set the winter toy shop which is a rerelease of the first winter village set 10199 winter toy shop from 2009 it seems that many think that this set didnt need to be remade and would have preferred a new set instead or that it is not different enough from the original and will be redundant in a completionists collection does it deserve all the hate lets find out disclaimer i dont own the 2009 version so i cant compare them visually but i will do my best to let you know what is different in this version if you do need a visual reference you can refer to sveltes excellent review of the original set number 10249 name winter toy shop theme creator year of release 2015 pieces 898 minifigs 8 price £5999  7999  6999€ sh description quote welcome to the winter toy shop the holiday season has arrived and the toymaker is busy finishing off his latest creations outside children ski and snowboard and a freshly built snowman sparkles in the light that shines from the toyshop tower help decorate the huge tree that stands at the center of the square play with the curious kitten on the cozy wooden bench or join in with the carolers beneath the ornate streetlamp this charming set also features a ladder trees in various sizes jackinthebox a toy biplane helicopter rocket train race car truck robot tugboat teddy bear and a wrapped gift have fun building this enchanting winter wonderland includes a snowman and 8 minifigures with assorted accessories a male caroler female caroler a woman 2 men 2 boys and a girl sh bricklink brickset the box the box art of this set is similar to that of the original but there are some notable differences the christmas tree is on the right side of the image this time while the park bench is on the left and of course it features this years design for creator boxes with the dark blue stripe along the right side and the expert logo in the top right corner theres also a small picture of the back of the toy shop and the background looks less cartoony than on the original the back is also very similar showing a different angle of the toy shop along with some closeups although this time there is no minifig lineup instead the minifig lineup is on the right side of the box it also includes the accessories that each minifig comes with and some of the toys on the left side of the box there is a thumbnail of the box art and the set name in six different languages they also want to make sure that you know that there are batteries included by saying it in dozens of languages the top of the box features the inventory and a 11 scale reference with the female caroler on the bottom there is a picture that reminds you that there is a light brick included in this set in case that wasnt clear from the front of the box and it confirms that yes it is a bad idea to put it in water in case you were planning to go swimming with your winter toy shop the contents inside the box there are two instruction booklets and two groups of bags one for each instruction booklet while two groups of bags is not as many as there usually are in other sets of this size its still better than the first version of this set where the bags werent numbered at all so this makes the build a bit easier the large bag in group 1 and the two large bags in group 2 have a white stripe going down the middle of the bag and only have one group number printed on it along with some other number and some kind of scan code i have no idea why they made this distinction for these bags or what that code is for so if any of you know the purpose of this please let me know in the comments below here is a random instructions page as you can see the building steps can get quite challenging as they sometimes include many different pieces in one step especially when it uses a lot of brown pieces which are very dark and hard to see in the instructions living up to the sets status as an expertlevel set most of the time though the instructions are pretty clear and easy enough to follow there are some parts in new colors in this set that werent in the first version or any other set until now such as that large flat technic arch in dark green the jester hat in orange and blue one of those new 2z2 round jumper tiles in brown a golden frog and a snowboard in dark blue there are also some rare friends parts that make their creator debut here such as the skis in azure and that new clear 1x1 round tile with a tiny tube coming out of it which is usually used as a stand for friends accessories and is a very useful piece especially for snot techniques and no im not talking about the type of snot that many people usually have stuck in their nose around this time of year there are some printed parts as well such as the clock tile the letter tile and the register slope like in the first version of the set we also get a new face print for the white cat which is more in line with other modern cat designs but the best part is the shop sign which is printed this time around it features a lovely wood pattern the words toy shop and a toy soldier on both sides of the sign which is ironic since the shop doesnt seem to sell any toy soldiers like this but it looks so good on the sign that i wont sue them for false advertising the minifigs lets start with the most unique figures in this set the carolers these two were also the highlight in the first version of the set but in the original they both had the same head this one   which featured a very questionable facial expression that could easily be taken out of context in this version they have unique faces which look much better and help distinguish their gender the male caroler uses lord vampyres torso which looks quite snazzy on him maybe this is lord vampyre before he became a vampire the female caroler is easily the best minifig in the set though because in addition to her exclusive head she also gets an exclusive torso and skirt print a huge improvement over the generic unprinted one in the original she also gets the queen hair in dark brown and aragorns lined cape instead of two combined regular capes this set truly is the return of the queen the snowman is technically not a minifig but as you can see here he is exactly as tall as one and he is the first thing you build after the minifigs so i included him here he has mostly the same design as before except this time he has robot claws for arms instead of levers which is good since they allow him to hold accessories such as his broom his carrot nose is included separately again the carolers both have back printing while the snowman looks no different from the back than he does from the front here you can see the black side of the females cape this lined cape is so much nicer than the solution they used in the original next up we have what i assume is a married couple who are likely the parents of at least one of the kids as well as the toymaker who i will call geppetto the man in the pinstripe suit was not included in the first version of the set so hes a bonus minifig these guys are fairly generic but they have some detailed torso prints so they look pretty nice geppetto seems to have gotten younger since the release of the original set since his gray hair has now turned dark tan and he doesnt seem to need glasses anymore the men both have back printing but the woman is the only one in this set who doesnt get a back print why you gotta be so discriminating against women lego last but not least there are the kids one of the boys wears dark blue pants a green jacket and a wool cap he looks a bit like a lumberjack so lets call him lumberjack boy or jack for short the little girl wears an outfit that wouldnt look out of place in the friends theme with a lavender scarf and pants ill call her lavender the second boy is wearing an octan jacket and a sports helmet which makes it ironic that he is the one not doing any winter sports on the box art ill call him president business junior or pbj for short all of the kids have fairly detailed back printing which makes up for the fact that much like the adults they are made out of mostly common parts pbjs helmet and scarf cover up the back of his head nicely which is important as you will see in the next picture whats also great about these figs is that half of them have a doublesided head here you can see pbj doing his best macaulay culkin impression i also removed his scarf so you can see the printing on his torso better but hes not the only one who seems to be easily scared the mother also has a very alarmed expression maybe she got surprised by the jackinthebox or maybe she just realized how expensive toys are nowadays you can see the female carolers back printing here her alternate expression is a nonsinging face which is very nice to have and i wish the male caroler could have one too she looks quite cute with those rosy cheeks but the most adorable out of all of them has to be the little girl she comes with a pouting sad face that will melt your heart please dont cry ill buy you any toy you want just stop looking at me like that the build the first half of the build is dedicated to the surroundings of the toy shop it includes the christmas tree the park bench the snowman the toys the carolers jack and lavender the large bag contains two smaller bags with small pieces a white box that contains the carolers cape and the jester hat in its own little bag the first thing you build after the minifigs and the snowman is the toys this version of the set has a lot more toys than the original which is good because i always felt that the first toy shop was a bit light on toys also the ones that were in the original have been updated for example instead of the two pairs of skis you now get one pair of skis that use the new ski mold and a snowboard the jackinthebox is mostly the same except it now has an orange and blue color scheme instead of the red and blue from the original this change was probably not necessary but hey at least we get a new jester hat out of it and instead of the brickbuilt teddy bear you get the new teddy bear mold i have mixed feelings about this change because i actually kinda liked the brickbuilt teddy design and using a specialized mold seems to be going against the spirit of creator sets but on the other hand i cant deny that the molded teddy looks better than the blocky old one meh the new toys include a tugboat which has some rounded technic pieces as its hull a biplane a rocket a helicopter and a truck that cleverly uses roller skates for its wheels these are all quite brilliant designs that feel like micro versions of lego city sets and make a great addition to the set here is a back view of some of the more complex models as you can see the friends accessory stand has been cleverly used to hold the biplanes fin in place and to provide a stand for the helicopter the jackinthebox has a hinged lid the only thing that bugs me a bit is the tpiece on top of the helicopter that holds the rotor in place but i cant think of any better way they could have done it next is the ladder that is used to decorate the tree which is exactly the same as the first version the supports are on a clickhinge so they can be adjusted or folded away then you build the tree itself you begins of course with the stand which is mostly the same design as before but this time the plates at the bottom are brown instead of white and have golden studs as feet next you build the first layer of branches the main difference in this version of the tree is that this one actually has a brown stem rather than just a technic axle on which you stack the layers of branches one by one you wont be able to see the stem in the final result but i like this change as it makes the tree more realistic then you add the second layer of branches this one doesnt have lightscandles and attaches to the lower layer at an angle using the four transyellow studs close to the stem the third layer is added this one has lights again each layer is similar in that they are all made out of green plates that are built around a 4x4 ring plate but they get smaller each time and are constructed differently enough for the build not to feel repetitive with the addition of the fourth layer we get close to finishing the tree lastly you add one more layer and the tip of the tree now its time to decorate the tree however its not as fun as it sounds since that requires you to add lights to the two chainsropes first which can get a bit repetitive the clips holding the lights to the chain were white but this time theyre pearl gold which looks much nicer in my opinion the next part of the build is the park bench with the streetlamp and the little tree this is a fairly quick build with not much to it the fishbowl helmet parts are a useful piece that you dont see too often so its nice to get them again in this remake the design is pretty much the same as in the original set except for the wreaths on the streetlamp which use a green life preserver instead of a round 2x2 plate this is another instance where they use a specialized piece instead of a brickbuilt solution but im okay with that because unlike with the teddy bear this part was not originally intended to be a wreath so its still nice part usage the second half of the build is dedicated to the toy shop itself and includes the couple geppetto and pbj please note that there is a fourth 6x10 plate burried under the parts you begin by tiling the floor setting up the walls and adding the interior items such as the fireplace the cash register and the toy displays next you add the walls windows and the door and the ground floor of the shop is finished so far the build is the same as the old toy shop except this time they decided to have the white stripes on the marquees be the longer ones instead of the dark red ones for some reason i dont know why they did this and kinda would have preverred to get dark red 1x1 plates instead of white but it doesnt detract from the look of the shop so i dont really care now we begin with the upper floor this is where things start to look a little different can you tell the difference the difference is that this time they attach the roof using cliphinges instead of bulky technic constructions which gives you more space on this floor and allows it to look more like an actual attic they even tile the floor next to the frog clock aftter adding the roof the build is finished the main roof feels a bit loose since its only attached to the building by one side im not sure if this was an issue in the old toy shop but its not a big deal i just wouldnt pick the set up by the roof what i do like is that they used double cheese slopes on the awning on the outer wall of the tower instead of singles which makes it a bit easier to build i like how the supports under the tower roof now match those of the main roof the wreaths have also been updated like the ones on the streetlamp and those technic arches under the roof look a lot more like garlands now on the original they were dark gray so i didnt even know they were supposed to be garlands and assumed they were part of the architecture the shop sign looks a lot better now that it is printed the old one just looked like a white flag i also like how the small plates under the marquee give it a wavy look and they included two trees in different sizes on the right side of the shop the back is nice and open and allows you to see the rest of the toys the robot train and race car all of which have just as much of a simple and clever design as the other toys the clock looks much nicer with the new golden frog because golden frogs make everything better spare parts there are quite a few small parts left over including a roller skate and one of those friends accessory stands which will come in handy the complete set here you can see the full set together it looks quite nice and festive with all the little details and there are many scenes that you can play out with it you can have the minifigs decorate the tree have the kids play in the snow have the carolers sing by the bench have the toymaker build some toys in his workshop or have the parents buy presents for their kids its a festive toyfilled winter wonderland the fireplace looks cozy and i like the brick pattern going up the chimney the entrance of the shop looks a bit empty aside from the cash register i feel like they could have displayed some more toys here but oh well being a set targeted at teens and adults there arent really any play features aside from the light brick which is attached to a hinge so you can either activate it by pressing the button with your finger or tilting the brick upward so that the button is pressed against the roof however since the roof is not connected in the middle and only attached on the sides it tends to split open a bit when you do that so im not sure if attaching the roof this way here was such a good idea nevertheless it looks quite nice when the light is lit ratings design 55  this set is as gorgeous as it was back in 2009 the small updates that they made are mostly good ones although the absence of a brickbuilt teddy is a bit disappointing and the new way the roof is attached while not as bulky as before makes the roof slightly unstable but those are just nitpicks build 55  there are some interesting building techniques here such as those on the tree the roof and the toys the fact that the parts are only split into two groups and the part callouts can get fairly complex makes it a challenging enjoyable build minifigs 55  they did a great job updating the figs in this set while only 3 of the torsos in the original had any printing all of the torsos have printing front and back in this set even the skirt and cape of the female caroler you get two exclusive heads and half of the heads are doublesided plus you get 8 instead of 7 minifigs you really cant ask for more in a creator set playability 45  this set is more meant to be displayed than to be played with but there are plenty of things to play with if you want all the different minifigs accessories and set pieces make for endless possibilities for play its especially fun to swoosh the micro vehicles around parts 35  there are lots of good parts here most of them are fairly common but there are some rare parts and some even in exclusive colors price 45  this set costs 20 more than the original but considering that this set has nearly 900 pieces including some rare and exclusive ones as well as more minifigs with much better printing i think 80 is still a fair price overall 55  so whats my opinion of this set for a remake i think its great they managed to make a good set even better are the changes minor yes are they an improvement mostly yes were they necessary perhaps not but its good that they made them instead of just rereleasing the exact same set so if you didnt get the first winter toy shop i can highly recommend getting this one if you do already have the old version this one might still be worth picking up for the hugely improved minifigs and rare parts alone as for the controversy over rereleasing the winter toy shop i can see where the haters are coming from but i find their complaints to be quite petty i can understand if youre disappointed because you already have the first winter toy shop and were looking forward to a new set this year but theres always next year if youre a completist and feel like tlg is forcing you to buy a set you dont need youre wrong nobody is forcing you to buy anything but yourself if you decide to buy every set in a theme no matter what it is thats your problem not legos so put down your torches and pitchforks and just be glad that they improved the set design and gave us another chance to buy this classic set there are far worse things that can happen in this world than lego rereleasing one of their most popular sets sorry for that little rant so what is your opinion on rereleases like this please cast your vote in the poll above i hope you enjoyed this special eurobricks reviewers academy review and would like to thank the lego group for the opportunity to review this set happy holidays everyone battoys by okay yaramanoglu on flickr	positive
thanks for a great review first of all i do like the upgrades and changes made from the original 2009 set more colours and parts are offcourse available today than back in 2009 it does look like a great set and i would really realy have loved to get it myself if i had the funds however their are so many other sets thats first priority for me this december and next year so sadly i might have to pass on this if its not that i can get it redicioulusly cheap at some point and yeah we should appreciate that lego does keep sets coming even if its just upgrades from earlier releases town is known for a new police and fire station every year cant see why a new toyshop is so upsetting once again thanks for a great review and happy holidays to you as well	positive
nice to see they finally updated that generic screaming face from the 2007 castle line awesome review oky i have the old set so i wont be picking this up	positive
great review you almost make me want to buy one i dont know what it is with these sets on the one hand they are so nicely designed and cute on the other side i never seriously consider buying one i cant explain what it is that holds me back	positive
great review i just built the original and this one has clear advantages over the original though i wish lego would stop putting torsos with defined breasts and curves on children i really like pretty much every change i wont be getting it and id be lying if i said im not a little disappointed for the first four years my motherinlaw got me the new winter village set for christmas after the last two which didnt really fit thematically in my display i had hoped for a new oneparticularly since my daughter is getting to be around the age where she can play with them i mention her specifically because ive seen lots of people dismiss those who are a bit disappointed as rabid adults who dont care about kids getting cool sets and i dont think thats fair i may have to see how much some of the parts go for on bricklink the rerelease is better than the original but not good enough that id want to spend 80 to get a set thats nearly identical to one i have edited by tea weevil 29 november 2015  0431 pm	neutral

regarding the reason for the different designs on the inner bags i think that the white stripe is the new version with the nonstripe version being old i suspect the reason some sets have both versions is simply that theyre still using up some of their supply of older bags good review i didnt realise there were quite as many changes as you highlighted tree roof etc	positive
thanks for the excellent review unfortunately it only highlights how minimal the upgrades are though they are nice definitively a pass for me lets hope lego does continue to make the more realistic winter village sets versus santa im not opposed to a rehash the post office could use some improvements for example but this one is just a wee bit minimal	negative
i missed out on the first one but i love the improvements made in this version like the tree having an actual brown trunk so it looks less like an artificial one and the carolers as well i may pick this up but im sorry to those of you who already have one	positive
i bought it and im very happy with it	positive

review  42044  display team jet introduction the smallest of the 2016 sets is the display team jet it doesnt seem to have lots of functionality but maybe the landing gear is retractable this set kind of reminds me to the 9394  jet plane although its obviously a lot smaller as you can read in my review of the 42052  heavy lift helicopter basically anything flying is 1 for me so lets find out if this set also fits the bill note all images can be clicked for hires versions set information number 42044 title display team jet theme technic released 2016 part count 113 box weight 193 gr box dimensions 154 cm x 138 cm x 59 cm set price msrp € 999 price per part € 0088 links brickset bricklink the box being a small set it obviously comes in a small box the display team jet is an aerobatics jet used in air shows on the box its flying rather high but at least its at a safe distance from the crowd front side shows the main model together with a small section indicating you can use digital building instructions to build this model back side the back side shows the bmodel a stunt plane and again a reference to the apps for digital building instructions more on the stunt plane later content of the box the box contains 2 instructions booklets a and bmodel 1 sticker sheet 3 technic liftarms 2 bags instruction booklets both the instructions for the a and bmodel are included in the box sticker sheet a lot of stickers for such a small set apparently no panel is left untouched liftarms three liftarms unsealed nothing out of the ordinary for a small set bags two bags containing the rest of the parts highlighted parts this section describes the new andor otherwise interesting parts yellow 5l axles the 5l axle in yellow has never been released before so its one of the new parts for this year black 7l flex axles for the layman this seems a common part but the 7l soft axle actually has never been released in black before combined with the rerelease of the 19l soft axle in black this will open up lots of possibilities for those of you thinking youve read this text before you are right the new drag racer contains these new 7l flex axles too white panels this small set comes with a whopping 10 panels great for the ones who like panels not so great if you think tlg is using too much panels lately rudder this part the small bionicle wing is the same as the one used in last years 42033  record breaker part list this set contains 113 parts all listed below the build this is the collection of parts used to build the jet it sure looks like we are getting a landing gear the build is fun but pretty straightforward there arent any special or cool techniques used in this set it almost took me more time to apply all the stickers than to build the actual model finished model the finished jet does look cool though the white and yellow color scheme combined with the stickers work really well i have seen people refer to the plane as being orange but its definitely yellow technic or lego in general tends to have some color variation when it comes to yellow i do concur this is the warmer variant of yellow but its not orange the back of the plane looks nice too although i am not a big fan of the rudder part it looks too detailed compared to the other panels its not a big deal though and maybe its just me parts left only three common parts left features and functions this set has a single feature and that is a retractable landing gear its operated by the black 12t double bevel gear near the cockpit in the following picture you can see the landing gear retracted this image shows the landing gear when the plane is ready for landing hopefully the pilot will roll the plane before landing but you probably know what i mean video heres s short video demonstrating the display team jet bmodel this set also includes the building instructions for the bmodel a stunt plane the building experience for the stunt plane is more or less the same as for the jet well what do you expect when both models are planes with a limited number of parts for an alternative model the stunt plane looks fine theres not a lot of functionality in this plane but its worth mentioning that the tail wheel allows the plane to roll on a flat surface the plane also has working propellors both functions are demonstrated in the video unfortunately the landing gear of the stunt plane is not retractable parts left a couple of extra leftover parts but its nice to see that most of the parts have been used in the bmodel as well actually theres probably an extra yellow technic smooth 12 bush left i just found it on my desk but it could belong to one of the other sets video heres a video demonstrating the stunt plane summary two nice planes for 13 bucks thats basically what you get both models look good and the set has some interesting new parts especially the 7l flex axle will be very popular it comes with a decent collection of white panel although they are very common nowadays both models have limited functionality but each of them has at least one function to give the model some playability for kids other than the swooshability that is okay it might lack some proper functions but i still think kids will love this set i can see kids running around with one of the planes in their hands all in all i think this set delivers what youd expect score lets see how this set flies remember that the grades are based on it being a small set obviously a set like this cannot be compared with a mercedes flagship 8 design for a small set the model looks very authentic 7 building experience no surprises 7 features just the retractable landing gear 8 playability it has swooshability so i see kids running around with this model 7 parts lots of panels if you are into that 8 value for money cant go wrong with these small sets 75 fun for kids more image can be found on my flickr page thank you for reading i hope you enjoyed it	positive
while i can see kids enjoying this im not sure i would buy the flex axles are nice and it is a decent number of white panels but i think i would get better return out of a larger parts set fantastic review though and your pictures show off this tiny model better than the box art does	negative
very nice little set and a lot of those new white small panels its a need	positive
thanks for the nice review the landing mechanism looks quite cute arent the yellow axles 5l not 4l very strange that they would release such a part	positive
it says 5l in the parts list	neutral
hi there nice model great review i almost reverse engineered this model but used wrong parts for landing wheels didnt know how to fix the nose proper and so on so i was very interested in this model and i like playing with it i love the reviews but i think i have to mention that the yellow axle must be a 5l the picture shows a 5l and a 5l would fit the size of the model the cart has also a 5l in yellow what sitze is the yellow axle in this seit really 4l as written in the text greetings robert	positive
i seem to have been messing up axle lengths in various reviews its indeed 5l my bad thanks for pointing it out	neutral
good review as always jim when i first saw this set i thought that it would make a great parts pack for me as that i have about 20 white pieces in my technic collection all from 42043 and this set has some really useful ones all for a cheap price those 7l flex axles will be extremely useful in my current build im doing	positive
nice review even with the missing demonstration video of the amodel looks like this is an excellent panel pack for the price and those soft axles will go down a treat will this set be the dark horse of 1h 2016	positive
i am definitely getting set for the panels	positive
jay psi on 02 december 2015  1210 am said nice review even with the missing demonstration video of the amodel hmmm strange let me fix that	neutral
set is only interesting for the panels thats all it is to me	neutral
my favourite of the 2016 sets ive built so far id go so far as to say this is the best budget set in years i would have loved this when i was a kid  great swoosh ability 	positive
i got this little set for xmas and i noticed all the gaps and decided to fix them so here it is img5344 by jj2sam on flickr first i added some beams to the wings and top to make it less hollow second i put some navigation lights on it i made the nose a bit wider and added a control panel and lastly i changed out the landing gear wheels to more appropriate ones img5349 by jj2sam on flickr more pictures are here	neutral
so this set showed up in stores yesterday and i immediately picked two up all in all it is a nice set but it is slightly different from what i was expecting the plane feels a bit flat pointy nose wide bottom etc and while the panels work very well as wings it feels a bit simplistic to just have singlepart wings the stickers really work for it though its a cracking set though nice parts pack and a nice model as well	positive
got this at the weekend mainly for the parts but built it first agreed with other comments  awesome swooshability	positive
review  42046  getaway racer introduction starting with the 42010  offroad racer and 42011  race car in 2013 tlg released two sets in the first half of each year using a pullback motor the pullback motor allows the model to be pulled back followed by forward motion usually theres no apparent relation between the two set other than the ability to combine them into an alternate build this year there seems to some sort of cops and robbers scene going on a getaway racer and a police interceptor that cant be a coincidence makes you wonder who will be victorious the good guys or the bad guys lets find out note all images can be clicked for hires versions set information number 42046 title getaway racer theme technic released 2016 part count 170 box weight 302 gr box dimensions 260 cm x 138 cm x 59 cm set price msrp € 1999 price per part € 0118 links brickset bricklink the box the box has the same dimensions as previous years pullback motor sets in the lower right corner theres a visual explanation of the pullback mechanism the dark model with its decals sure looks like a cool hot rod content of the box the box contains 1 instructions booklet 1 sticker sheet 2 technic liftarms 1 pullback motor 3 bags instruction booklet just a single booklet unfortunately no booklet for the alternate model sticker sheet the sticker sheet contains a lot of cool stickers with flames and skulls etc pullback motor and liftarms the pullback motor and two liftarms are found unbagged bags a total of three bags containing the majority of the parts highlighted parts this section describes the new andor otherwise interesting parts actually this set is the only set of 1h 2016 which doesnt use any new parts not even parts in a new color tires the getaway racer uses four low profile tires tire 37 x 22 zr rims the rims are wheel 304mm d x 20mm in pearl gold found in 12 other sets panels this set contains three 3 panelsand three 4 panels in black part list this set contains 171 parts all listed below the build this being a small model i wont show any building steps lets skip right to the finished model below you can see the end result in my opinion the model looks great its got that hot rod vibe going on and the stickers add darkness to the vibe slight problem with this set is that it really needs the stickers to finish the look otherwise its quite dull with black and dark grey liftarms and panels the rear view shows the pullback motor connected directly to the rear axle in this image you can also clearly see the exhaust pipes on the side which are very well executed the 3x3 technic discs with stickers used in the rim result in only seeing a part of the rim this works very well with the golden rims the bottom view shows the chassis of the car nothing really noteworthy as you would expect from a pullback set video the following video gives you an overview of the finished model parts left these six parts are left after building the model seems about right features and functions this being a pullback motor set it only has a single feature the video below demonstrates the acceleration of the vehicle my girlfriend was kind enough to catch the model before it fell to the ground or did it hit something before it fell to the ground video this video shows the pullback functionality bmodel the alternate model is a combined build with the police interceptor which you can see on the back of the box unfortunately the instructions for the combined bmodel are not included so i didnt get a chance to build it this would make for a fun challenge building the bmodel without the instructions summary pullback sets are not the most technically advanced models so you cant expect any other functionality than hitting the walls in your house however i think they are very appealing to kids the fact that this years pullback sets form a duo adds to the fun in my opinion tlg hit the nail on the head with the getaway racer and police interceptor the getaway racer looks very badass which is something you dont see every day in a technic set score how do i grade the bad guy in this years duo 8 design it looks so cool but it does need the stickers 7 building experience nothing out of the ordinary 7 features limited to the pullbackanddrive functionality 7 playability combined with the police interceptor kids will love it it does need its nemesys though 7 parts collection of common parts gold rims could be interesting 8 value for money pullback sets always deliver a certain value 73 hit it more image can be found on my flickr page thank you for reading i hope you enjoyed it	positive

i was waiting especially for review of this set let me add few things about this thing it all will be complainging of person who works with these type of machines so if you just want a unusual machine in your collection ignore my complaining  i see underground loaders almost every day and believe me this model would now work in the underground mine first of all its cab should stick out more from the frame each loader has cab placed out of the chassis to provide better view for the driver in this class of machine it would help a bit but in low loader ones it is extremely important this is the view from the cab of a low profile loader looking at front  and yes front of the machine is where engine is placed because at least at kghm all machines drive engine forward another thing about that cab is that seat and steering wheeljoysticks are placed perpendicularly to the machine chassis to provide same view for driving forward and backwards so another weak spot of the set the model lacks of trans clear lights on the engine part because all machines that work underground have same lamps on front and back another thing that comes to my mind is that warning light and antena would not live too long in the mine becuase it could be torn apart by ramming into tunnels roofs it does resemble shape of underground machine but not a loader only machine that comes to my mind is something that are used for movingplacing hydraulic support jacks in tunnels sorry for poor quality i didnt find better picture of it it does have claw four wheels and articulated chassis but have much greater range of movement of the arm anyway id give it at least 35 for overall look model itself as a set looks unfinished or cut down on pieces after visit of an accountant for me it looks like engine part was built differently with knobs for steeringclaw operating sticking out from back claw needs almost seven full turns of the worm gear to close from opened position and is rather annoing to use it in way it is built in this model bracket that holds bevel gears responsible for steering is rather loose being hold in place by single 34 pin on the other hand the steering works very well it seems that lack of differential will be more common in lego sets becuase it is another model that have fake engine driven by single wheel like in old russian rc cars i am ok with that but it is a pitty that this model has only r2 engine thing that i do not like the most in this model is how the claw arm works first of all it barelly lifts the claw of the ground the movement could be much better and it has major design flaw  universal joints are not placed in line with articulation points and this is main reason of 5l axle not being suported on both sides under the turntable while rainsing the arm it bends a little i really would like to see this model built differently with normal bucket and better range of movement edited by mlonger 05 december 2015  1108 pm	negative
thanks for the thorough comments i agree that the set has some limitations both in construction and realism but i think theyre acceptable given the pricepoint and size the antenna is definitely ludicrous  i really do suspect they had a surplus of the swords to use up and yes the way the steering knob is mounted is loose i also noticed that the ujoints to the claw are not in the right spot like you mentioned but didnt include it since it still works fine that axle coming forward to the claw has a very long unsupported section that does bend a bit when you raise and lower the claw it works but is a bit of a cheat that im kinda surprised they let through i just checked and the bucket from 8043 is a couple studs too wide for this set im betting that was seriously considered but itd have meant scaling the whole thing up and that would have put it into a higher price point or they could have pulled the mold for the 8x14 bucket back out and remade it for this set i really like the model you built and thats interesting about the cabs being basically flush with the top but sticking out the side in image searching as part of my research i found both that style and ones like this with the cab sticking up more like the photo of the caterpillar one in my review i wonder if thats a useuropean difference or different types of mining or what because both styles definitely exist in the real world	neutral
great review thank you the set to me is kinda blah interested more in the new panels than the rest of it	neutral
great review and great pictures  many thanks for talking the time to review this set  i am a fan of lego technic construction stuff but this set is not so appealing to me but then again i am sure some people will love it	negative

great review one thing reaaaaaally bothers me about this set both models have the engine connected to one wheel the other wheel on the powered axle is just left to rotate freely and that really bothers me as it did in 42022 on 42022 even more tbh since its main feature is being a frigging car looking at the pics it isnt even a space issue as it was in the hot rod where they needed to route the steering through so they just cheaped out and didnt bother fitting a diff in there or even a live axle link im not very interested in this set not into construction stuff but i think this is a worrying trend 	negative
definately a quirky set i think id have prefered a bucket on the front with a complex lift and tip mechanism but a grab is different as for the b model i may prefer its functions to the a model certainly something different we have not seen before	neutral
great review indeed	neutral
nice mod there effe might inspire me when i get one and start modding it	positive
cool mod by effe but the original model out of the box is one of the poorest models tlg ever released looks from front to rear as a cheaped out set with really lazy design effort a shame for the responsible lego designer parts assortment seems to be ok but this should not be the most important criteria sry jim i really appreciate your always very well done reviews and offen i agree with the overall judgementsverdicts and of course tastes are different but especially that review sounds like gushing praise in my ears just my 2 ct edit ooops just saw the review isnt done by jimblush so sry jim now my final comment belongs to mostlytechnic edited by kumbbl 27 december 2015  0733 am	negative
quote and the dumbingdown continues now they have to show people to compare axle lengths to the 11 prints on the page that have always been there but how does the 11 work on the app might have to look into that for the record i pulled out my phone and tried to find the app in the google store couldnt find it so then i went to the lego website shown on the page and it had a link to it turns out it wasnt showing up because its tablet only so google wasnt showing it to me on my phone ill try again later with a tablet funny thing is that they changed colour of 7l axle to yellow and on that picture it still is in lbg	neutral
thanks for a great review too bad there is only one blue curved panel in this set my opinion on the frictionless axlepins is that the flex axle might be easier to stick in them than in regularblue axlepins didnt actually try it though  edited by majklspajkl 05 december 2015  1146 pm	negative

majklspajkl on 05 december 2015  1145 pm said my opinion on the frictionless axlepins is that the flex axle might be easier to stick in them than in regularblue axlepins didnt actually try it though  frictionless pins have accurate round hole while blue friction pins have something squarish flex axle will fit in both but using tan pins doesnt require strength conncetion with tan pins is weaker too	neutral
great review im a bit undecided on the set though it has some nice parts 4 cil engine in such a small set and it looks good but also a bit small and simple not sure if it stands up to the standards of the small tracked loader or similar for sets of this size and as a parts pack for panelsflaxles the display team jet is infinitely better ill probably pick one up but right now i really want another tracked loader last one was sacrificed to the mod gods	neutral
nice review thanks nice little set i might buy me one	positive
very timely review jim my wife has just surprised me by giving me this set a few days ago and i have just built the a model two days ago and b model yesterday i agree with all that you wrote above i dont have tumbler tires but i have 9398 tires driving is smooth but steering  suspension will be bad as you said due to negative caster and tires hitting the chassis anyway tonight i will destroy the b model and rebuilt this httpwwwbusterhau8cmodelhtml	positive
the set is a looker youve got to admit it but what it gives in looks does not make up for what it lacks in functions i really wanted this set badly even when i restarted my adventure with technic about a month ago than i learned more and more about what a good model can do mostly thanks to this forum and yt right now im a bit disappointed with the arctic truck  smaller sets offer more functions and teach you much more jim it was a great review nevertheless edited by pgplay 14 december 2015  1122 am	negative

until i saw photos of this set i wasnt convinced i wanted it now after seeing all the combinations ab and tumbler tires i am definitely buying two copies i need orange parts and black treads anyway the only problem i have with this is that its going to encourage me to buy many copies of the drag racer just to get enough wheels to play with	positive

here is the reviewfor broadsides brig 6259 a set from 1991 with a handsome count of 64 pieces 3 figures and a sale price of 875 the buildingand parrot well start off with the front it looks like a good solid building to hold those scurvy dogs we yonder over to the left side and see a nice open back and yonder to the plain right side back to the left we find the corner with a nice area to rest your tired soldiers we see the platform in the corner a lovely place for soldiers to stand on its a bitskimpy so watch your step the middle is blocked by some stones assuring security but still open enough to stand in the jail is cramped and fits only two people but we only need one prisoner in this set   moving up is the watch tower a place for your soldier stand and stand watch or for silly parots to sit on heres the front middle part again those stones blocking the way figures and accesories we have a delightful number of a soldier a sailor and a scurvy pirate a lovely parot and a generous assortment of weapons that concludes our review overall its a fantastic little set and great for army and supplies and bricks gathering i cant find any faults with this set its just the neatest little thing youve seen in a port wub highly recomended y  and to end our review a comic	positive
a fine little set with 64 pieces and 3 figures for under 10 may have seemed a bit steep in 1991 but i wouldnt know id passed into my dark ages already so alas i havent a copy of this set looking at the parts list i could build one out of my current inventory though issued today for 10 id buy no less than 14 of them even though it does lack the obligatory rowboat for the pirate to make his escape in very nice review and comic thanks for doing them y edited by imperialshadows 20 october 2007  0610 am	positive

during the annual thanksgiving road trip to the relatives i stopped by the tru in portland or lo and behold the new mars mission sets obviously i bought them  the box not much to say standard box art for mm sets nothing new the parts some good parts here even if you dont like the set which i highly doubt after ive had my say p  its a decent parts pack i noticed that some old parts have been renewed i know the wheel has been used in the 07 sets but the cockpit and hitch i havent seen in a while the vldss very large dss grr new part at least i think it is someone slap me if it isnt wacko the figs i know ive seen that head before but i have no idea where does anyone know i was hoping that the aliens would have new arms at least i was sadly mistaken on the upside i finally discovered that they glow in the dark  the alien has a jetpack if thats not the silliest thing ive ever seen i dont know what is the build simple build a block so easy a caveman cou oh never mind geicos used that one enough then we have this jobber right here not sure what it is but it looks like some crystal scanning device its starting to look pretty nice it almost looks practical the cockpit is suffering from a bad dose of overstickering on the upside we have a new piece there to hold the cockpit on part 1 complete it has a nice little radio antenna which is ruined by the use of a random missile that looks like its going to shoot the antenna before it shoots the alien still i never say no to a good missile i can use for something else the trailer fairly simple but it works it features stabilizing arms a handheld saw and an extremely random minibot whos purpose escapes me the whole meal deal erm general pics overall i thought this was a good set in fact it reminds me of this	positive

a wonderful set and perhaps as close to classic space as possible y also theres a great amount of very useful and interesting parts too like these round stabilizer parts with clip  theres a complete different feeling with this new sets compared to the first mm ones 8 beside the a little more realistic aspects of it with the more enclosed cockpit nearly with some controls   its the overall more solid feeling i guess the other sets look pretty neat and fashionable at the surface but their internal structure is much more hollow and useless with some studless technic beams and such stuff very shining but hard and boring to mod just aimed for maximal cool looking box art and the rest went down for saving costs beside that already pretty good 7692 dropship that is the only thing i dont get with that is why the minirobots a onearmed one ach pirates on mars i suppose xd	positive

during the annual thanksgiving road trip to the relatives i stopped by the tru in portland or lo and behold the new mars mission sets predictably i bought them i present to you the mx41 switch fighter man what a long name the box standard mm on the front it shows the fighter in flight mode and a yellow note telling you that it transforms the back shows three pictures showing it happen the parts once i open the box the first thing that comes out is a bent and rolled up instruction booklet and i was forced to put it under a stack of beer books for an hour then theres the dss yes two of the stickers do feature a cobra i wonder why because this sets decal should be a beatle xd decent parts nothing too special then i noticed this little part its used for the flickmissiles but i have no idea what else it would be used for  the build the alien ship when i looked at the box art for this set i was releived to see that the aliens dont have another curvedforward wing ship instead they have this little beauty which appears to be the alien mini cooper small and hot wub anyway partially completed even if you dont like the set it has some nice green flame peices which work nicely for space laser swords fully completed the only annoying bit about it is that the crystalholding thing in front wobbles all over the place the alien fits into it by way of impalement it must hurt getting in and out switch fighter cockpit the set makes good use of the alpha team cockpit for controls it has a meagre handlebar that the astronaught cant even reach the rear shell of the fighter starts out around the alien containment chamber its a bit odd that the containment chamber has an alien sticker because the instruction booklet lists it as holding crystals the crystal canister is held back by a technic pin this is without a doubt the ugliest color arrangment ever warning mass stickers x the cockpit fits into grooves in the shell then it clicks into place in a 1x1 brick with a horizontal clip the wing mechanism the wing for some reason the body of the mechanism has a blue brick wacko the wing and mechanism connect to prevent the fighter doing a nosedive while in tank mode the wing mechanism completed the underside the body and wing connect by way of a miscolored red brick i have no idea why its red black would bave been much much better completed tank mode all in all this looks pretty neat the wheel base is pretty short but its not bad transform the set transforms neatly if ungainly without antigrav support it would fall forward on its nose each time it transformed jet mode its all right but it could be a bit better the shell keeps slipping back forward to the tank mode because theres nothing to stop it sliding spare parts overall i thought this set was great it could do with some fixing such as the mismatched colors but it should be a definate buy for mm fans brickshelf gallery when available	positive
cool review im actually liking that new missile part as it seems to combine a bar with a pin but its a real eyesore if you ask me	positive
wub thanks for another great review sweet i am also glad that it is a very different alien fighter design as i already have three varients of the old type the fighter transforms better than i thought it would i was expecting just the wings i should be buying this set as well mr mandalorian on nov 26 2007 0345 pm said without antigrav support it would fall forward on its nose each time it transformed well since antigrav doesnt exist and will never exist there has to be another option looking at it in tank mode it does have a vague aerofoil shape so i think it should be able to work as a lifting body all it needs to do then is move fast enough to start taking off and then it can extend the wings 8	neutral

after seeing this set review it change my mind about this set by the way thanks for the great review	neutral
thanks for that very good review mr mandalorian y i think that this is a plain beautiful set oh how i wish that tlc wouldve taken that direction from the beginning  the design is much more practicable with fewer nonsystem parts and technic beams with studs this makes everything much more easier to mod and a lot more useful at least imo y so its for sure not very hard to make the wonderful enclosed cockpit one brick higher and even that little alien ship looks decent and nice xo and the fighter looks sleek and elegant too in both modes thats just very cool compliments tlc now all we needre aliens with moving arms and here we go classic space on forever xd	positive
thanks for a very thorough review i might think about getting this i really like the mini alien fighter and the transformation idea is always a welcome one both modes look pretty good despite the some of the odd coloured bricks which id mod out you know what it reminds me of some of the futuristic designs in the gerry anderson series	positive
wow this is actually quite a neat set it is definitively my favorite in the line after the big drilling unit begingeek im not sure it would nose dive when transforming from tank mode i guess it would pick up speed and transform quickly since it doesnt seem to have any downwards pointing thrusters endgeek	positive

great review mr mandalorian y im not a fan of mm and dont like this set much but it has some neat features but the only way i can see it transforming is by racing off a cliff and swinging its wings out wacko to the brickmobile 	negative
and another tks and congrats mm on that review  like the oher post i think that this set is a wastre of time and money and shelfspace its such a ripp off from that ugly alfa team crapjet i do not like the design of the jet itself the small flags as front is so lame  and i dont like those orange wheels as engines  furthermore i dont like the rover mode either  the only cool thing about it is the special martian jet which they should ahve sold separatly p at least some interesting parts but that far from saving that set imo  money saved on once again p yoda	negative
john cleese on nov 25 2007 1056 pm said cool review im actually liking that new missile part as it seems to combine a bar with a pin but its a real eyesore if you ask me a needed solution to those blasted flick missles from falling out while swooshing sweet wonder if the range might have an issue seeing its held in there but who knows maybe they now pop out with a greater velocity than a mere finger flick i had resorted to technic 12 bushings smooth to lock in the missiles technic axle with stud	positive
great review mr m y i wub those green flames and the design of the ship is pretty good thanks for the review and great pictures they are clear big and describe the set just the way they should	positive
mr mandalorian on nov 26 2007 0929 pm said 1 thanks guys 2 i dont think that tank is very fast maybe if it drove off of a crater 1 there will always be kudos for a good review at eb  2 yeah it does look quite slow and tanklike it is a shame lego didnt make a more obvious way shoving what goes on brainbox on nov 26 2007 1015 pm said the one thing youd have to make sure of though is that it was fairly light and the wheel base had a fairly large surface area actually thats two things so as to make sure it didnt dig into the soil if that happened transformation would be harder as the wheels would dig into the ground and drag through the soil then itd nose dive you mean the ungainly way in which the wheels have to turn in order to change from tank mode i think you are right as well on the other hand if it has antigrav then it doesnt really make sense to have wheels as well i mean if the power goes then the wheels cant turn anyways	negative

konas2002 on nov 26 2007 0521 pm said i really like the transforming aspect of this the one thing i wish mm sets would include would be baseplates i liked that about the classic space stuff because it really helped create the environment some red rock orange mars baseplates would be great thats a really fine idea and would for sure be very cool y	positive

great review hinckley i know youve been busy so thank you so much for getting this up d the spine construction is clever the minirobots cool this is a fantastic set peace	positive
sweeeet wub its nice to finally see a set thats not bipedal or  tripedal quote exoforce is an anomaly in my lego interests i dont know why i like it so much or why i keep buying it but i do that would be a problem wouldnt it p quote the cockpit itself is constructed very well but the canopy seems like an afterthought closing on to the robots head and leaving his back and sides completely exposed i dunno at least it has a canopy unlike past sets	positive
thanks for this fantastic review hinckley i cant wait to see the comic  i really love this mech as i am a fan of nonbipedal mechs though i am terrible at making them the purple is great and i cant wait to see what mocers will use those awesome new spike peices for 3 robots in one mech is a really good deal too and that spider droid just adds so much more to the set and thanks for taking the time to do this sweet not to sound like a smartypants though but the grill peice in purple is not the first time this has happened two were included in the 06 joker helicopter  thanks again to the brickmobile 	positive
awesome reveiw thanks for the pics did the instructions come with a comic	positive
thanks for that very neat review hinckley y this set looks indeed very interesting with a very cool antlike look and a simple but essential overall design the cockpit seems better protected than many other ef ones that spines lovely and the way these iron dronesre attached is simple but effective  and hey did i miss something orre there really no crappy shooting devices p thanks to the minirobots and their inventor i guess 	positive

great almost finished review y thanks for doing these since you are probably busy however my favorite part is missing the comic d interesting set however i never liked exoforce but i like the parts wait on piranha	neutral
another great review hink looks like a great set quote the cockpit isnt sealed and is actually aggravatingly unrealistic as it leaves the drivers chest vulnerable to enemy fire actually the cockpit lacks any controls as seen here where it looks like keiken is simply pounding a counter demanding food d gimme food or else my friend up there willl shoot your punk  into mars well i guess that explains why there are no robot snipers in ef if there were well wouldnt be much of a story would there xd	positive
darnit hinckley  you always make us wait for the comic which is almost everyones favorite part   xd i just noticed ryos uniform had a camo pattern with all the orange he has its kinda pointless edited by lt veers 28 november 2007  0448 am	neutral
this designers were on a roll with this one until it came to the flying unit it looks like a shambles epecially the guns looking rather simplistic although they used something similar to the light and sound globe peice which is kind of neat i dont think ill be buying this but your review almost talked me into it	neutral

this one is much better than i thought i didnt expect the gun and the turret to be geared i agree that a lot of the details sux hollow inside lame cockpits but as an overall package it looks quite good the best part is no shooter is the nightmare finally over  the bonus robot is a much better idea the large amount of blue pieces make this a must buy for me as impartial needs more raw materials p how well do the tracks work the last tank was too light and it didnt roll well at all  thanks for these photos as well hinckley wub so far the 08 exoforce sets are looking good sweet hinckley on nov 28 2007 0448 pm said and actually i did feel the same way you did about the flying module until i put sinner in it and started to play p wow its big enough for my big walrus head wub	positive
thank you for the glimps at the new set hinckley y  i saw this set today at my local tru store the new slope 1x2 pieces look very sweet  i definitly see great potential for these pieces on locomotives i hope these are going to be bountiful in the 2008 lines model on	positive
fantastic great review thanks a bunch for all the pics theyve shown me how in my opinion bad this set is p i just expected it to be more bricky rather than technicy oh well i wasnt planning on buying it anyway xd i noticed you spelt minifigs minifgis in the first paragraph in case you wanted to know xd so again thanks and im looking forward to seeing the rest of them and the comics peace	negative

asuka on nov 28 2007 0241 pm said for the design i love that asymmetrical look of the front part and the sleek guns of the flyer the asymmetry reminds me of the wookie vehicles in starwars battlegrounds y and i see they changed back to the first color schemes for minifig suits which i think where better than the dark suits of 2007 except for hikarus wub  luxorv	neutral
some of you might know that im not a big fan of exoforce but this set is an exception this looks like a futurist tank my kids would love this if i should have any d as always very professional review hinckley	positive
i think this is probably my least favourite set of next years selection but i still might get it partly because of this review thanks btw i quite like the minirobot and while there are a few problems the front cockpit the exposed axles i relish the idea of moding them out and correcting them and the change back to the original figs is welcome i didnt really get any of this years sets only last years makes it easier from a mocing potential anyway	neutral

awesome thanks hinckley i was not planning to get this set but now it look as if i will have too i still cannot afford it anyway 	positive
i would agree the spider looks really cool too bad we cant see how the combo mech looks like instructions are not online yet  there should be another combo mech but youll need the storm lasher set p	positive
hinkley you are the man your reviews just keep on getting better and better although all of the sets this year are great and i love them all to bits i cant say there was one that i absolutely felt like something id buy except for the storm lasher but with this review i think this will be the first purchase of 2008 for me i totally agree with you on how the spider looks better without minirobot but from looking at where the cockpit is placed and how the skull on the cockpit is lodged underneath the walker maybe the minirobot would look better mounted underneath the head that way it looks more even and even gives the thing a nasty set of teeth i gotta try it out once i get it cant wait for the fabuland comics keep it up hink	positive

here is my review of the set 6265 sabre island overview sabre island was release in 1990 an it contained 92 pieces and its retail price was 1550 it comes with 3 imperial blue coats and a nice outpost for them the pictures  full review anyway you can see here a picture of the box the model shown on the box differs from the actual model slightly and the back of the box which shows some nice alternative models from the pieces provided a close up of two or three of the alternative models and now for the minifigs i prefer the red coats over the blue coats but these minifigs are nice and for the number of pieces one gets a fair amount of them the set itself makes a nice small outpost it comes complete with a palm tree a cannon with ammo on a turntable a small tower a nice large imperial flag and a little red row boat here is a shot from ground level showing the cannon and blue coat patrolling the out post the rowing boat was a nice touch and it comes with a small flag too no pirates will avoid the wrath of myself and my mighty island the top of the tower is rather plain and simple which in some ways is good as it keeps the whole set detailed yet not crowded but i feel a little something should of been added to the top though the back is lacking any type of walls so one can play with the minifigs inside yet their are also no stairs or any other ways for the blue coats to climb up their tower either the rag tag pirates attack sabre island but never fear the lord of pies is here me throwing a pie at captain ironhook from another angle overall i think this is a very good if somewhat simple set and makes a great cheap imperial set comments thoughts and opinions are welcome and sorry about the darkness in some photos i have not had time to take photographs when it is till light recently for when i return home it is dark   edit fixed thank you edited by phred 12 april 2015  0514 am	positive
fantastic review ill post my views on the set later when i have more time but ive already fixed the poll	positive
nice review hmmi gave it a 4why very good bits 3 epaulettes for 3 gurads patterned wall parts cannon bad bits no pirates to fight title is rather grand for an outpost top needs battlements not very low lattices needs a more substantial base  the wall goes right into the sea  surely the whole thing would sink palm tree is too short and the rest is good p you might want to fix the vote option for 5  it appears to be the title you cant vote for it pirate king skelly killer edit ok boney but i gave it a 4 edited by slyowl 06 december 2007  0732 pm	positive

i gave this one a 5 its one of the little pirate sets i had during my youth and i loved it for several reasons first of all it contains 2 of my favorite minifigs it can be used as a small independent base or in combination with one of the bigger sets eldorado or trading posts as a lookup or outer defense besides all that this set just looks beautiful i love the colors blue baseplate and the whiteyellow tower one of the best littlemedium sized sets ever made by lego	positive

lord of pies on dec 6 2007 0724 pm said the top of the tower is rather plain and simple which in some ways is good as it keeps the whole set detailed yet not crowded but i feel a little something should of been added to the top though perhaps a catapult steve	neutral
did i hear right a catapult in the 16th17th18th and 19th centuries wacko perhaps its an appeal for lord of pies to have his own personal catapult to pelt the pirates with whipped cream pastries should they try to sail past but this begs the question why waste perfectly good pie on those scurvy mangy muttfaced villians	neutral
i liked the set but it could have done more plus the strange price of 1550 just seems odd must be the modern pricing systems wacko another rowboat with a pirate would have been good y y y out of y y y y y	positive
lord of pies on jan 3 2008 0851 pm said what a wonderful idea p a pie catapult although it is a waste of a piewe have ourselves a dilemma theres plenty of stale moldy old maggot infested grog around eldorado fortress perhaps thats worth wasting on the scurvy seadogs afterall my men have taken to eating only coconuts brought by islander girls in their skimpy undies xd	neutral
its a fantastic set cant think of anything wrong with it to be honest even if the island is a bit small the plate itself is still useful and the rest of it is also very useful walls can go toward a bigger fort cannon can extend your ship soldiers extend your army boat extends err your boats and the island prin is just cool	positive
its a nice set i would not mind owning one just for the minifigs and cannon the base plate is pretty cool as well nice review i gave it a 4 out of 5	positive

this set is so cool and another must buy  im in trouble next year it seems the figs are great wub i think the plane is only ok perhaps they should have made that in a separate set as it needed to be a certain size to fit the figs but that meant that the tail is way too short here is a picture of the actual plane so you can see what i mean notice the pilot is fishing   the temple is another story i think lego have done an incredible job with this fitting in the key parts of this sequence without making an absurdly large model addtionally there are many parts in this set that i havent got so it shouldnt be too hard to justify xd thanks for another great review sweet i love the photo of indy running with the idol and the boulder close behind p naith on dec 16 2007 1020 pm said lol is it just me or in the earlier concepts of this set we saw a native on the box i wonder why they removed it  wacko i recall that too  edit yes there was one big pete on dec 16 2007 1128 pm said we dont normally have this many inconsistencies do we  quite annoying ones too i think the plane looks better with those being white	neutral
because of exams and other obligations i havent posted this sooner seeing that noone else has reviewed this set i thought i might as well do it myself the set in its entire glory minus the slammer instructions and the obviously massive sticker sheet the four cars included in this set a muscle car a sports car a roadster and the police offroader because the police obviously have no clue that an offroader is useless for catching streetracers no less a batmobileish sports car it will always trail behind but the police have a trick up their sleeve  the drawbridge gotcha and the mechanism that makes it all tick the motor is nothing more than a slow pullback motor push down the bridge the latch will hook on to the gear and keep it in place until the latch is released and theres the new gas station staying within theme this gasstation is like the tanker in 8147 from the company fuel 4 speed theres a notable presence of detail here such as the sodadispenser water coolant bottles and other accesories two fuel pumps and bumperlevel railings to prevent cars from crashing into them theres no interior however and as demonstrated here by a loyal octanemployee and a pursuing officer the gas station is built to minifigscale my impressions of this set as a collector of tiny turbos and yet to miss a set i got this one regardless of what it included the gas station is indeed very nice and the minifigscale accesories were unexpected the lack of interior is no big issue and the both the station and bridge can with ease be implemented into a minifig town the bridge also solidly built and includes the ramps in its design so it can be lifted with ramps attached without breaking apart the slammer included in the set is identical apart from the white color with those in 8147 the cars are also very nice altough i am yet to get used to the yellow batmobile as ive grown accustomed to calling it i also love the offroaders chunky tires they make perfect wheels for the newer minifigscale cars i never consider priceparts ratio and here it would for me be irrelevant because it will never be demolished for parts the play value is what i would consider pretty good and while the bridge wont rise with a car on it its still strong enough to stay open with a car tipping over the edge hmm every nerve in my body is saying that this sets is worth roughly 810 so verdict 810 edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0701 pm indexed	positive
looks like a nice set i like the tiny turbos and have most of the older individual cars but i am put off by the ever increasing price of the large sets with lots of extra parts that im not really interested in i wish these were available as individual vehicles as well	neutral

heres all the parts in assorted baggies and the horribly messed up instructions four astronauts and four aliens with an extra gold visor yay not bad the base of the horribly unstable alien craft the wings move up and down aswell as back and forth the purpose i know not next we build the nerf section of the base basically technic and the rest of the tube connectors heres the farthest i got the little missle to go its fairly dissapointing good thing i didnt expect much from this portion of the set heres the start of the command base more of the main structure will be adding lots of things to all the little beams heres a storage container and the surprisingly not flimsy radar on this side we see the alien elevator it uses a horribly long technic rod i have not seen one of this proportion its like a foot and a half long more of the inner base where all the little tubes shall go all the connected tubes and such i also encountered a problem in the instructions it says for the end of the elevator prong to be touching the tube connector where it is shown here but mine has a 1x space inbetween no matter heres the completed base  my knee again onto the spaceship the bulk of it is just technic supporting beams with some large slope peices covering it all up more on that later the white coverup the middle section lifts up to store the overly large jetpack as you see the storage containers take up most the bulk in the back and you can see the jetpack on the ground aswell as the trigger hand hold thing that allows you to swoosh it look in the back lego greebles despite the large cockpit it only holds one person laying down the wings are really the saving grace  double layered with a nice two toned effect kitty nudged me this picture so its abit blurry my apologies  extra peices and or peices i have no idea where the hell they go p overall the set is quite fun i must admit full price i probably would not go for it but i got it for just under 70 dollars for that price i can confidently say its quite worth it many useful peices nice figures other than the aliens and the tube things are quite fun to boot even though i liked the life on mars system more which i also have none the less its very fun to make them shoot around alright so its not much of a command base either and it looks abit bare but its still fun even if you ignore the nerf section overall i give it a hardy 35 out of 5 the openness and epic fail of a missile launcher are hard to get by but overall its a dandy set d merry christmas wub	positive
i just want the shipjust the ship	neutral
i dont recall mine having an alignment problem on the tubes could you perhaps take a closer picture of the area did yours also have two of the same sticker for the wings of the alien craft	neutral
i agree it does seem very scarce but ive taken apart the nerf launcher made a new module with the tube the launcher used and beefed up the base with some computers and other things for 90 dollars i would pass i agree on sale it is lovely though and none the less ive been entertained for ages with them flyin through the tubes d	neutral

sorry for answering so late but i was very busy thanks guys for your comments y tedbeard on dec 28 2007 0808 pm said sorry to disagree with anyone however but this was not a great review i appreciate the effort sandra made but a great review would include more details such as what are stickers and what are printed pieces a great review points out flaws or limitations as well as what works or is really neat a great review would have analyzed the price per piece and compared that to other setsthemes one might look at the recent reviews of the indy sets or the new spongebob sets as examples of really good reviews the pictures are good but a great review above all should provide the reader with some new information perhaps even answer questions posed in the prerelease discussion thread i learned nothing new about the set from this review that said it was a good review for someone who had not seen the prerelease discussion and she did a good job of showing said person what they could expect in the set its good that you told me your opinion about my review it was my third review i made and i have to say that i made this review not for analyses just only to show the eb members some nice pics and to tell them my opinion lego is fun for me i dont like to analyse the pieces bricks prices colours i just want to build something thats why im at eurobricks and not at an other big legocommunity in germany lego is fun fun fun and everybody knows that lego is a expensive hobbie so why should i write it again and again julencin2000 on dec 29 2007 1007 pm said very good review thanks sticker sheet pic with 1 megapixel film posters thanks for the link julencin  xwingyoda on dec 29 2007 1025 pm said ps  tedbeard  do tone it down youg man  if youre not happy with sandras work do provide one yourself instead of bitching on how you view a review and on how sandras post is veryt far from one according to you  yoda thanks yoda sweet copmike on dec 30 2007 0130 pm said thanks for the review legocastlegirl  excellent work y i agree with you the best part seems to be the movietheater thats perfect because i just love to watch movies in the theater so far this year ive seen 46 pictures and had some popcorn to  this is a mustgetset town on copmike thanks copmike  so it will be a good year 2008 for you therell be a lot of good movies at cinema next year i cant wait for national treasure book of secrets the second movie after national treasure with nicolas cage	positive

kimt on jan 4 2008 1025 am said btw which set would you recommend market streeet town plan or cafe corner just curious theyre pretty expensive and i might only afford one of them i guess it all depends on what you are after kim if you want a really great and detailed set i would opt for the cafe corner but if you want a set that can easilly be included in a city i would opt for town plan since i cant afford all of them i will just get town plan because i lve the feeling of thge set and that theater is superb  yoda	positive
kimt on jan 4 2008 1025 am said btw which set would you recommend market streeet town plan or cafe corner just curious theyre pretty expensive and i might only afford one of them definitely the coffee corner its a hard desicion between coffee corner and town plan because they are both really great sets the market street is no must have in my opinion but the other two maybe you should start with the coffee corner its the older set the town plan is newer and will be available longer then the coffee corner i hope it helped you a litte bit  regards sandra edited by legocastlegirl 04 january 2008  1043 am	positive

happy new year everyone i went to my local walmart looking for an exclusive bionicle set yesterday but was amazed to find everything there sw bionicle ef indie the works i nabbed the jsf and the rogue shadow and scampered home to take pics with my new camera wub the box the same as the other 07 boxes nothing new the back shows the various features with pop out r2  luckily the intruction booklet and the dss were intact not folded like the last mm set i got  the dss not too bad but printed parts would have been great the figs anakin is amazing imo wub fits the cw anie great i noticed on the sh reviews the kiddies were saying how ugly he looked  they need to see the cw cartoon for the sake of my health i should probably stop reading those d the build i wont go too indepth on the build since vader posted a very indepth review here the start of the build the body of the fighter starts out long and skinny the jsfs landing gear allows it to sit comfortably without getting in the way while swooshing r2d2s launching device r2 in position when launched he often gets stuck if you dont press the button hard enough  looks like r2 needs to lay off whatever it is robots eat so far the flag stickered its a big sucker sticker completed i forgot to add the nose stickers before i took the pic warning the nose cone sticker is actually two stickers i thought it was one peeled of one of the stickers and put it on the middle of the two 1x8 plates and didnt notice the other sticker wacko various completed shots i think this was a beautiful little set r2s launching unit and the flick missiles are annoying but easily fixed i plan to add proper cannons in place of the flick missiles anakin is a great minifig but he doesnt look so well standing next to my other figs the brickshelf gallery when public will	positive

okie guys and gals here s time for some droid exploration with my review of set 7670 as a general statement i have to say its really a neat set that is not that expensive for what it holds 1 box art like always i will start with pics of the box art btw notice anything guys  no bloody crappy dss yes finally a set without stickers and that feels great d 2 the mfs nothing really spectacular there the only novelty lies within the inclusion of the new commander yellow torso bd apart from that there are 2 bds and unfortunately yet another sbd i like those but i have a huge amount of them and i would rather had something different you have 3 short blasters and a couple of extra parts 3 the spider droid i think its a pretty cool little buggar its a rather simple yet classic construction i think it has sweet parts such as the bd body in dark bley it really has a spider feel unlike the previous ep3 one 4 the hailfire droid this baby represents the pice de resistance of this set i truly love it  sure its a bit under scale but i dont really mind that its conception is superb even if i totally dislike assembling those technic treads especially 80 of those small things the ellipse of the treads is well balanced and that trans disc is a brilliant idea the great thing is those new flick fire missiles they dont fall unlike the other ones and they do look good on this baby also you can put the wheels together and the missiles to gain some shelf space easy storage on d  in conclusion those druids re really sweet and are perfect target practice for the upcoming rgs hehe  i hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any  yoda	positive

great review as weve come to expect from yoda y nice to see that tlg is finding new and interesting ways to get around the no minifig only sets restrictions with hasbro clearly this is another army builder with a minimal vehicle as were becoming accustomed to heck even the diminutive hailfire is technically a droid as well thus making this all minifigs from a certain point of view only negative it is a bit overpriced ill have a better feel for that when i get one treadslinks always drive up a price so it might just be fair the spiderdroid is a winner even with the unusual parts assortment i like it when lego thinks of different ways to use things i think it promotes the same from us im not sure what i think of the new battledroid commanders but at least i can make extras easily if i need to as i bought a bunch of yellow droid bodies off bricklink once thinking i might want to make some kind of new droid out of them they were cheap at the time now i expect the price to go up just because of this potential use between those and the grey ones its good to see more becoming available hopefully well see black and a few other colours produced for some nice customizing possibilities all in all a nice little set with a great army building potential especially on a buyonegetonehalfoff or better type of sale until then ill grab one or two and be glad to have them	positive

i got this and a couple of other sets on mondayand to tell you the truth i was a bit dissapointedi like the set i like the parts but its definitly not worth its rrp of 45 nzd if you ask me i should be more like 35 nzd but hey i still like it i got it for 30 on ebay so im not complaining y y	negative
ah i finally got the 2 city sets i really wanted  i am so happy that lego went postal on us p  since they are rather small i shall do a mix review of these 2 sweet sweet sets 1 mail van 7731 like always ill start with shots of the box art and bloody dss now here are the extras of that set i really love the new torso of the postal worker my huge grip lies on the mail box that mail logo is a freaking sticker  for that part i was so expecting a printed part that is really really bad  apart from that the design is pretty cool the van is quite simple but i think its pretty cute i love the fact that the rear is a window 2 air mail 7732 like always ill start with shots of the box art and bloody dss the extras are ok another great postal worker you also have yet another red trolley with a package that is a bloody sticker yet again  g tlc should have more printed parts  that plane for me is a classic thing of beauty  really is consistent with the fantastic planes of the 80s thats the kind of lanes tlc should produce instead of those huge playmo planes actually i am happy that tlc released that one  for once its not a bloody airline exclusive promo set  here are general pics i love the engines of the plane simple yet superb also the top hatch opens to insert mail and packages the front control panel is a printed part  i love the classic double train windows and here is a poc of the undeneath of the set in conclusion i truly love these small sets they are the perfect size 4 wide car yeay  and the colour pattern is amazing as well i hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any  yoda	positive

nice review yoda i dont think i have ever read one with as much cursing of stickers d i love these two little sets the colour scheme the little different wheels on the post van and of course the new postmen uniforms would have been nice if they had included little satchels like in the new indiana jones sets oh well  postman yoda on yoda	positive
thanks for the takes on these two sets yoda stickers or not i still think these are charming sets with all the essence and nostalgia of the older sets back in the 8090s am i the first one to notice the new doors used in the back of the van not only is it using the popular new frame but the old container doors have been redesigned to fit with the new frame as well pity theyre not yellow though	positive
very nice cheers yoda ill definitely be getting the post van not sure about the plane though both are awesome but i think i have enough planes can you tell me though the wheels on the van are they rubber or plastic they look a bit tacky	positive
these little sets are really nice they cought my eye the minute i saw them it would have been so great if there was a post office to go with them there are so few buildings in lego city the design is very classic and i am ofcourse considering to get them but it seems that i have a lot of small cars and planes on my desk  recently i took a flight with cyprus airways from thessaloniki to cyprus and the two promo plane sets were there i was so tired though that i couldnt stay awake to buy them im taking a flight again on tuesday and i hope they are not out of stock thanks for a great review yoda a fine job as always cant wait for your next one	positive
thank you for the nice review pity of the stickers but the design is nice 80ies on	positive
great review yoda i find myself saying that line alot d  i love these two little sets wub tlc continues the great city line that started in 07 and continues into 08 its also nice to have other sub lines besides fire and police  p i hope there are many more postal sets like a post officethat would be sweet hope these are mainstream and not those damn exclusives  postal on p	positive
i need to do some catching up here p matn on jan 5 2008 0516 pm said could you tell me how much you payed for them i think im gonna buy them tomorrow if they have it already or if i dont see any cooler sets i paid a tad more than the sh price i paid 15 for the plane and 8 for the van sure its a tad more expensive but i didnt want to wait for tru to get them freddie on jan 5 2008 0610 pm said am i the first one to notice the new doors used in the back of the van not only is it using the popular new frame but the old container doors have been redesigned to fit with the new frame as well pity theyre not yellow though great remark there i guess i totally missed that one  and i agree that yellow doors would have been better but those dark bley do not look that bad  mr hobbles on jan 5 2008 0910 pm said can you tell me though the wheels on the van are they rubber or plastic they look a bit tacky rubber off course  they do look a tad tacky but its because they are the thin type like with the racers and i am not a fan of those  phoinix on jan 5 2008 0935 pm said cant wait for your next one tks  me neither though p marvinblue on jan 6 2008 0331 am said i reckon lego could enhance this subtheme by releasing a post motorbike with or without a sidecar and post office obviouly the office would be the hub of all the activity while the post bike would take care of the postal run this would free up the van to take or recieve bulk mail or parcels to or from the airport it could then also do the parcel deliveries around the city the office would also serve as the reciever for all the parcels the new goods truck might deliver so true 8 at one point i was thinking of a impulse set with a yellow bike postman post and letters that would rock  i hope tlc adds to this sub theme and keeps that retro feel wub a yellow dirtbike with sidecar would be a sweet 5 set  also a small town feel post office would be so cool like a 2030 set  we can be sure of one thing though this years advent calendar will have a postamn and small post office  post on  yoda	neutral
thanks for the review  i was actually considering getting these but i saw they were overpriced for my tastes  too bad theyre nifty lil things wub	positive
thanks for a nice review and few comments to sets nice airplane finally some reminiscence for lego city golden era for me years 19821992 everything is nice but two things are freezing a smile on my face first of all the ugly new hinge used for plane roof i have already 4032 and those new hinges are looking really terrible when compared fe with 6368 second one is new minifig i dont know what i expected but this torso design looks too simple and too cheap concerning new car  i appreciate fact that tlc makes after long long years again postal sets but i dont like those newstyle cars matchbox wheels and bad rate between drivers cockpit and cargo space are damping me from buying 6651 mail truck or 105 canada post truck were much better edited by kanalk1 06 january 2008  0733 pm	positive
well first off thanks yoda for the great review  hmmm well i have to say im not at all impressed with any of these sets i mean there nice and all but the van just seems way to small it would have been nice if you could fit more than one package in it i guessim one of those that are more of the fan of the 6 wide trucks and the plane hm this has a cute factor and all but i mean comon you have to open a hatch on the roof to get your packages in and what about getting them out you have to flip the plane upside down  weak they should have had a hinged rear end or a hatch on the side	negative
5150 lego on jan 7 2008 0608 am said and the plane hm this has a cute factor and all but i mean comon you have to open a hatch on the roof to get your packages in and what about getting them out you have to flip the plane upside down  weak they should have had a hinged rear end or a hatch on the side yes this is the lego charming no stairs in buildings cars with just one minifig all those things that make lego what it is thanks yoda for your review those posts sets will be mine but i will wait to find them in my supermarket even if i have to wait 2 or 3 months i know that i will save some money so i will buy more lego d there are simple designed sets but we dont need more two nice litle sets that are not oversized and too expensive	positive
im glad to see the mail van has the doors that used to be on the older cargo containers i had given up on those older ones but now that theyre still out there i may invest in the older cargo system instead of the new 6wide ones both sets are good enough ill get both im hoping for a postal building too even though i have the smaller of the old post offices a nice big modern one would be great im not too hung up about the design of the plane ive got the neat old cargo plane with the tail that swings open one of the best plane sets for big packages the truck is goofy looking but if i get sick of looking at it i can rebuild it into a classic looking one great review by the way the pictures are some of the better one ive seen in a review recently	neutral
5150 lego on jan 6 2008 1108 pm said well first off thanks yoda for the great review  hmmm well i have to say im not at all impressed with any of these sets i mean there nice and all but the van just seems way to small it would have been nice if you could fit more than one package in it i guessim one of those that are more of the fan of the 6 wide trucks i see your point that more cargo capacity would have been better nevertheless my personal preference is for smaller classic scale city sets the mail van is nice and small and should fit well with my road plates and 1990s cars from the 4561 train on a side note did anyone notice the message on the back of both sets boxes designed for easy building and instant play it surprised me a little since these sets seem no less complex than any other city set of late they look like quick builds sure but not as though the designers went out of their way to simplify them	positive
thanks for the great reviews yoda the car looks great y and the plane is very cool too and much more suited to a lego town than the large planes on xd peace	positive
hey everyone my first 2008 set is this one 5613 i thought id share a review of it sweet id like to say sorry about my photos they were taken quickly first we have the box it is the smallest lego box ive ever seen and actually looks cute wub it will be heavy competition with playmobils specials back of the box showing an action pose the contents of the little box with a very tiny instruction manual wub the manual unfolded notice that every part has its part number beside it  the back of the manual showing some fire sets and the other impulse sets the parts 30 in total the small set built the firefighter has a small fire to extinquish armed with an axe chainsaw other saw and foam psssh thing xd  five extra parts in a 30 part set we get an extra black hatchet yellow bar tap light bley 11 plate red 11 plate modified with fingers and 22 dark bley radar dish besides the plate ive never seen these as reserve parts but im not complaining xd here is a small alternate model i created with it a small bbq what hes hungry and he needs to put something on the bbq  xd overall you cant go wrong with these impulse sets i paid 289 euros for this little set so thats a great value sadly the only impulse avaible were these 3 city sets no police and the alien mars mission looking forward to the knight and magician as well as those indy sets tt	positive
cool finally its an entire line i can actually afford to own every set d i cant wait to get my hands on them if its possible could you give us the demensions of the box it would be apprectiated y dp8	positive
thanks for the review tanotrooper this is a nice little set with 2 axes wub  and some nice parts cool alternate model too xd tanotrooper on jan 6 2008 0907 am said 93 cm by 93 cm by 45 cm xd tt xo cute i cant wait to see these impulse sets in stores wub peace	positive
beach house reviewed by dunamis set 4996 522 pieces 2995 from target build time 90 minutes yet another interesting creator theme house this one comes fresh of the 2008 line of sets and promises 3 different models packing 522 pieces albeit a lot of 1x1 plates for only 2995 it was hard to pass this one by as i was foraging for the new 2008 star wars sets at the local target plus i was itching to do another review since i had finally fully recovered from my marathon ucs falcon review which took the better part a month to complete the box the box is pretty standard creator type box which shows off the three models beach house caf and towering apartment building the back of the box shows some of the features of the three models interesting features of the three models prominently displayed on the back include  food counter complete with coffee espresso maker and food warmer with chicken leg  home office complete with laptop and the ubiquitous coffee cup  flip up roof granting access inside of beach house note the satellite tv dish and even rain gutters along the roofline opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals were back to the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets note the parts inventory is on the side of the box as well this is a nice feature once inside the box we are greeted by eight sealed bags plus two yellow 16x2 plates and a green 32x16 baseplate thank goodness there is no dss dreaded sticker sheet but alas there are no minifigs in addition there are the three manuals one for each model and they were stuffed into my box with the care of kid trying to put 10 gallons or liters if you prefer of candy in a 5 gallon bucket but hey were not collecting manuals here so who cares if the manuals are all bent and warped the manuals the three manuals are 74 72 and 48 pages in length they are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings  piece call outs for each step  parts inventory at the end of the primary model build  page numbers color separation in these manuals were fine for me plus we get the usual verbose lego instructions on not dumping all your pieces outside in the grass and not to dump all your pieces into a single pile thanks for the tip tlg parts list the pieces pretty standard stuff here and as i mentioned lots of 1x1 plates and tiles at least 100 however we do get quite a few windows and a couple of doors a majority of the color is black and yellow i did see a few pieces that i was not familiar with so im going to show them below keep in mind im not a parts jockey so bear with me if i think a part is brand new for 2008 and it was actually released with the classic space line 2x2 window fixed and 4x3 window that opens the follow photo shows the window glass same as in corner caf door glass and new black parts turns out these black parts are used as wheels i showed the window glass because it still contains the molding circle just like they did before it is hard to see from the photo but it is there the door glass i think might be new i dont recall seeing these 2x2 round plates with clips before and i thought i would show the mail only because it is printed and not a sticker i know these are common but didnt they have four studs on top these only have two how about this sloped 4x3 window that opens overall a nice assortment of parts with nothing juniorized the build the build was fun and was fairly straightforward once you figure out which of the three models to build it goes pretty quick here are a few shots see how the inside is made look at the detail with the flowers and even the outside water faucet outdoor seating area upstairs being built upstairs with opening roof notice the satellite tv dish check out the patio on the upstairs complete with outdoor light and rain gutters heres my favorite the bbq grill at least we know where those new parts go finally check out the tree no juniorization here here is what is left over so far i have only built the primary model the others look interesting especially the caf the design the design was well done very rich in detail i love how there are no juniorized parts the house is accessible by taking off the top floor like caf corner and market street there is an internal staircase as well there is no interior to speak of in the beach house but there is in the other two models the only real negative is that it is kind of small when you get it done it would be nice if it was about 50 bigger here are a few views of the beach house with a few minifigs thrown in check out the closeup of the caf which i think looks great also here is a photo of the interior of the apartment building where you can see the office and computer overall thoughts it is a really nice set a tad on the small side but it has some great detail and lots of features quick enough to build all three models and would fit real nice into an existing town plan is minifig scale but does not come with any lots of window parts and black slopes is a nice diversion from the onslaught of clone wars ships that we cant remember seeing from the movies final rating 84 build 910 pretty quick and fun functionality 910 it is a creator set so you have multiple varied builds diverse enough to keep the kids entertained design 1010 excellent and well thought out outstanding detail for such a small model parts 610 fair nothing earthshattering but lots of slopes and windows price 810 price ratio is good but you get a lot of little parts would be better with minifigs edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0638 pm indexed	positive

thanks for that really nice review dunamis now it is even more harder for me to wait for this set i hope my legostore will get it tomorrow it is really nice im a really big fan of the creator houses but that one is now the best one for me i love the colour of it and of course the windows at the roof wub creator house on greetings sandra	positive
love this set now more than ever wub i knew i wanted it from the first leaked boxshots especially with my love of yellow buildings just ask hinckley   great review especially nice to see the closeup parts shots those new 2x2 white windows are very much like replacements for the classic 2x2 windows tlg stopped regularly making a while back so its great to see them the wheels are trolley wheels common in sets including stretchers and handcarts the holder for them is a fairly recent part i think i remember a couple coming in a little single minifig jet engine repair set i picked up in a sh order within the last year oh honey be sure to wrench that chicken before it burns wacko thanks for another excellent review of a set im even more excited about than before y	positive

i have the big passenger plane so ill be passing on this one one big juniorised plane is enough for me if i didnt have the passenger plane though id rather get the cargo plane theres enough police in my city as it is	negative
am i the only that one that thinks it is not so badwhat i am trying to say is wouldnt planes be this big in real lifei know it has a lot of big pieces but how would they make them any smalleror how would they the big pieces into a bunch of tiny pieceswell any way i do think in some cases that if there is any juniorized involved it should be with duplo complaning off	neutral
thanks for the review sweet i am stunned at the lack of an interior not that it makes much difference as i wasnt likely to want this set anyway as i own the passenger plane from last year sorry to steal your image but i just had to post this p	negative

i have to agree with almost all of the replies here that this set is the most ugliest looking lego set i have ever seen if i have never seen this set and ppl showed it to me i would have thought it would be some little kids moc or something no offence huge juniorized pieces bad color theme i would say it would look better if the wing is white no interior and huge dss i will avoid this set like the plague i own the entire city line except for the airport and planning to get all the city stuff that lego releases but this set will ruin my plans coz i will avoid it unless someone gives it to me for free haha wacko boo lego boo x	negative

legoman132 on sep 11 2008 0626 pm said this still looks like a cool set but the price not so much the price is now €20 in ireland on sh which is reasonable considering the large fuselage pieces has anyone modded this set to make a reasonable looking plane i am thinking of buy it to do so but i dont want to take a risk and end up with lots of useless pieces aswell as €20	positive
hello and welcome to another redman set review well actually the first redman set review im your host redman and today i adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the impulse set simply titled the knight this is a great set with 14 pieces 2 of which are spare and a minifig with 2 weapons 2 helmets and some shiny armour all this is packaged in a tiny box just short of 10 cm or 3 inches with a neat little instruction manual that folds up to the size of the weapons rack included in the set as you can see this set only costs a measly 7 nzd disclaimer redman not included here we see the box clearly showing what the box holds on the top we see a 11 scale picture of a minifig for those new to lego or who have forgotten how big a minifig is i guess  xd the instruction manual showing the nice and easy built with me for size comparison d sorry about the dark image i had to lean over the light to get a birds eye pic  here we see the 2 different soldiers you can make with the set a knight and a guard or standard troop or soldier or whatever you want to call him note each set comes with only 1 minifigure and additional accessories of course you know im in the picture just for the sake of it im not really one of the soldiers xd the neat little weapons rack or rather equipment rack as it holds not only a weapon but a shield except the ovoid ones helmet and armour nice and easy storage so your equipment wont get dirty lying around on the ground d one of the spare parts is another of those robot hands so you can stick that in place of the shield and allow the rack to hold 2 weapons just thought youd like to know that  and here we see the nifty little structure of the thing it can even support a whole minifig note the grey stud on the bottom bar is a spare part i just find it better used there to hold the armour  huh i dont remember this picture 8 it appears i drifted off and these guys dont look too happy i overtook their weapons equipment rack  i should go xd so in conclusion this is a great set for army building at a reasonable price with nice equipment and it can be picked up as a little extra with your normal shopping xd thats all for today folks sweet redman so what do you think should i continue with these redman reviews  p or just stop now xd comments and criticism welcome  peace	positive

looks like an ace set  i may get this just for the sand green troll even if im not a great castle fan i do want one of them things wub i also love the goblins new metal flaked helmet and the same style with the wheels they look very nice the chicken leg fishing pole is always fun too 	positive
thanks for this excellent review vader it seems you are succumbing to the castle side of the force i love the new helmet and the new orc torso is fantastic as well which is great to see that the troll faction has many ranks too the troll himself i love i agree with you in saying i prefer the sand green version the battle wagon is cool one of the better wagon designs and the flag is a great touch which improves it sadly the back is rather empty but a few modsll change that  and of course this set includes the infamous chicken pole one pic request if you have time vader could you please post a few pics of the new helmet on its own and on a human soldier please batbrick is back 	positive
thanks for the review vader the first picture of the troll is great the gold armour really shines xd a fantastic set ill definitely get a couple of these wub as for the ogresgiant trolls the dark tan one fits in the mine setting well but for above ground settings i prefer the sand green one y peace edited by iamded 19 january 2008  1021 am	positive

thank you for the review vader that set looks worth buying 8 i think you gave me a good reason to buy it 	positive
great review vader  as ive said before this is a nice set but doesnt really come with anything that doesnt come with the other sets of the line for this reason it will be somewhere at the bottom of my list for 2008 also i like torso and helmet of the dwarf mining orcs much better the colours make the torso look rather dull and boring while the other more brown one looks much clearer and more exciting i think i like the knight helmet better too looks more covering and threatening than this one although ill save my judgement until i have one in my hands thanks again vader  edit forgot to mention hilarious pic in your sig vader d edited by tinypiesrus 19 january 2008  0828 am	negative
thanks for the review i love this set its a cheap way to get green trolls and i love the new helmet it looks great and i think it will be very usefull for other factions as well sweet dnl	positive
a troll driven by a turkey leg what a wonderful little detail d d thanks for the review vader very clever using a flag to hide that crazy firing device i find it rather odd they used blue pins for this black or gray wouldve been alot more discrete about the big trolls i think using different colours is good i dont think a troll force would be very organized so different colours would make the effect complete y  as for your troops looks quite fearsome definitely compared to my pathetic number of soldiers  a nice set but i would rather get the attack on tower though no matter about the price difference	negative

lego city truck  forklift set  7733 pieces 343 price 2499 usd store of purchase toys rus release date january 2008 after discussion of the mysterious yellow cargo contained in this new city transport set and a visit to my local tru i purchased this set i was immediately pleased with the pricepiece which i think is pretty reasonable 343 pieces for 25 starting with the box great city artwork boasting special edition tha backside of the box no alternate models comes as no surprise the dreaded decals i was looking for the skull and bones for radioactive but no such luck my favorite part of the set a very clever forklift side view and the backside what i like about the forklift is the bars across the top giving the vehicle a reallife design the double wheels in the front with two pieces that can hold the wheels also adds to a clever design i like the figs although not much new  perhaps ill make the driver into a werewolf later the set includes three cargo pallets the first some sort of fuel with gauge the 2nd two indy containers and a square 2x4 brick i have not put the decals on yet and the mysterious yellow cargo your guess is as good as mine   on to the truck the front section the front grill another angle the back i like the opening mechanism that is very simple but works well also is the large plate tile piece inside i like this because the entire interior has no studs and the trailer section of the truck orange and yellow tail lights and the rear trailer open the complete set summary this is a neat set that reminds me a bit of classic lego city but larger it is very playable and has a lot of accessories adding to the value the build was very simple and enjoyable took me about an hour it is a great addition to a number of city sets including the cargo ship container stacker the world city cargo train and the new cargo plane as i mentioned previously i have not yet put on the decals that im sure will really add to the overall look of the set the forklift is awesome and i like the cargo containers the truck could have benefited from a few additional details chrome smokers and an undercarriage box that really opens considering everything i would buy this set again hope you enjoy and perhaps this mysterious cargo will make its way into a brickster mystery y	positive
the forklift is amazing and nice design of the opening side doors aswell thanks for the review i may actually pick this one up 	positive

some guy on jan 19 2008 1117 pm said i think the special edition is just for making people intrested and make them want to buy that set or something hmm thats a thought but why would they pick this particular set i would expect theyd do that with a slightly bigger set like the heavy hauler perhaps why do you think theyde pick this one	neutral

highlandcattle on jan 20 2008 0915 am said this set looks pretty good to me it is six wide isnt it that is nice for a truck like this yes 6wide the only problem with these big trucks is how they look on the city roadplates ive always thought too big compared to classic city trucks getting off topic id like to see lego make a car transport truck i dont think ive ever seen one in lego it would definately have to be 6wide or even larger	negative
5150 lego on jan 20 2008 1150 am said great review my only grip with this set is you can only fit one pallet in the truck it should have been the same size as the trailer so you can at least fit 2 pallets seems like alotof wasted space if im going to transport cargo i want to use the maximum amount of space aviable xd thats a fair gripe someone else mentioned it above as well i thought the same thing when i went to load it	neutral
i got this set last week and just to add a few of my own points cons  the forklift spring feels a bit flimsy  i dont know how long it will last or how much stress it would take  and the end coil isnt really heavily secured to the lift mechanism time will tell on that one  30 stickers its the exoforce of city sets the truck set does look less plain with them on though i would reccomend lining them up with the green brick in the second container rather than applying the first lot without a guide or they may end up uneven  its very hard to put the minifig in the forklift without dismantling or breaking open the set slightly  the cargo box attached to the main cabin of the truck doesnt hold very strongly  minifigs are dull  that dark blue torso with pattern is way overused  green stickers are a different green to the bricks themselves pros  lots of nice pieces including the large white panels and cargo pieces and i like the green white colour scheme  the cargo doors open well and the hingeing mechanism doesnt stand out to the detriment of the rest of the set as some people have complained about the mail airplane  studless floor in cargo containers makes it easy to move pallets in and out  fits in better than the heavy hauler to a minifig sized city  new 1x1x4 slope at least i hadnt seen it before overall  nice set with some good pictures although a bit flimsy and way too many stickers  the same issues i have with the cargo plane as well although that had more colour issues	positive

greetings and welcome to another redman review im your host redman and today i adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the impulse set simply titled the knight no wait thats the old script xd i mean the good wizard sweet the other castle impulse set the first being the knight this is a wonderful and in my case unexpected addition to the castle line i did not expect to get a nice good wizard but rather another plain white skellie for the impulse and was pleasantly surprised when i saw the first picture of this set the impulse sets give you pieces you wouldnt expect to see in such small sets for example the knight came with the armour and this comes with an owl a gem and a crystal ball piece it comes with 11 pieces including the wand owl and gem and no spares which doesnt really matter as it doesnt need any the box sports the set number age range which i blissfully ignore xd awesome castle logo and the assembled set with the usual 11 scale picture of a minifig the back of the box shows pictures of the boxed skeleton tower and kings castle siege sets note the price is in new zealand dollars and is really the same prica as any other impulse set next are the instructions which are separated into 3 parts 1 for the minifigure 1 for the table and one for the bird stand very simple also worth mentioning is the parts numbers are next to their respective parts for replacement parts etc on the back we see on the top half pictures of skeleton prison carriage skeleton tower and kings castle siege this time not of the boxed sets but the sets themselves on the lower half we have 8 pictures each of the different impulse sets the wizards torso is plain sand blue with no patterns or anything but it doesnt really matter is his beards in the way  the head is that same old white fade to grey beard head but the white beard covers up most of the grey my favourite part is the pants i love that were getting printed belts and legs again his belt has 4 gold crosses as seen in if you look closely the new crownies torso and the crownie archers torso and a belt buckle and the legs have a bottle a coin and a small bag nice little wizardey items the er items no accessories no models the stuff in the set include a little stand for the owl and a table utilising the new 4x4 round piece in light bley with the crystal ball in the middle encasing the yellow gem held on by a 2x2 circle piece in blue why blue im not sure maybe its because the crystal is yellow and the crownies colours are blue and gold so the blue piece with the yellow crystal symbolise the crownies colours or maybe tlc just felt the need to include an odd colour p in conclusion this is a wonderful set with some neat accessories and it doesnt really need to be bought in the masses after all you needs an army of owls and wizards  p so it works fine as a single set and adds a more fantasy feel to your crownie army thats all for today folks sweet redman thanks for reading another of my redman interviews any suggestions on how towhat to do to improve it is greatly appreciated as are all comments and criticisms except those blatant thoughtless criticisms that dont help at all p peace edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0131 pm	positive

wow thats a great review of a great set dr s y as you yourself have already noted this has the potential to be a fantastic military moc with a bit of modification you can get the engines to be rounder or perhaps do away with them completely and replace them with jet engines sweet though i cant think of a system to retract the undercarriage at the top of my head it seems like theres indeeed more than enough potential to do so it reminds me rather of an ilyushin il76 one of my favourite cargo planes 	positive

hello and welcome to another oh wait first batbrick and iamded review today us two sworn enemies will be reviewing the creator cargo chopper here is the front of the box and while pushing iamded to his doom here is the back haha ouch oh dearhere are the parts anyway here is the instruction of the first model the cargo chopper i love creator sets for the different models they always excite me just ignore me finishing off my nemesis in the background something very interesting that i liked in the instructions was this step where you must add those three 2x2 yellow rounded pieces under the chopper this is for support while you build which is handy and later you take it off and even later use it as the cargo i found that to be rather innovative and clever as well as  hey what are you hitting me for both instruction booklets have the same back now heres the chopper itself i love the design of it it isnt quite minifig scale but its great all the same this is my first nonxpod or house creator set and it sure is fun here me and iamded go for a dizzy ride i love the nose of the copter and the landing gear is fantastic a shot from the other side oh dear it seems weve been a bit sick from that ride and were vomiting transgreen 1x1s the cargo itself is nicely made though i forgot to put on two tiles here   it fits in real well with the chopper to and the line is great for giving iamded the wedgie he deserves this is my first power function set so i was pretty excited the motor is intergrated really well into this set and is activated by pushing that little 3x2 plate with the 1x1 slopes on it forward until it hits the motor button that orange knob another point of interest is the use of bley barrels on each side i like this as i dont have those pieces in that colour a shot of the motor its really simple all you do is pull the hook out to any length that allows then press the orange button and it will wind it back up this makes the chopper pull the cargo up into its bay and iamded pull me here reluctantly to a whacking a top view is that my head a view of the chopper without the cargo in it i love the lowered cockpit the leftover pieces from building note iamdeds head does not count as set piece and a final shot of the set with me and iamded oh it appear were dead oh dear hope you enjoyed this review soon i will post the two alternate models i loved this chopper its great to play with and has nice construction it also has some handy pieces too the motor function sounds like a gimmick but is well intergrated into this model well worth the price so far this is another win for creator i say so far i recommend this model but later well see if the alt models are up to scratch also since this is my first review comments and criticism welcome on everything batbrick away  edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0637 pm indexed	positive
great review batbrick iamded got what he deserved xd	positive
i am definitely getting this set thanks for the nice review	positive
i wish i could just get those grey barrels alone the rest of the set doesnt really intreigue me much  thanks for the review	negative
thanks everyone heres part 2 the second instruction booklet includes instructions for both alternate models which is good i hate having too many manuals here she is the plane its very nice and well proportioned but where did iamded get that laser overview the landing gear is very sturdy and nice and the wings are surprisingly good top view iamdeds head fell into the propellers i was trying to save him honest a view of how the motor on this one works by pushing the orange button you can make the prop spin it is well integrated like the chopper though the prop only spins for about 2 12 seconds still its a nice feature the tail is also well made simple but lovable oh and check out that tank the prop spinning agh is that my hand final view there seems to be some sort of explosion here 8 well i think i got iamded more than me atleast the second model is also great though not as good as the chopper the lack of space to fit something into the cockpit brings it down a bit but it is a very nice model overall i recommend it though unlike the chopper it will be hard to mod into minifig scale so far so good with 4995 here are the leftover pieces from the model enjoy batbrick away 	positive
haha your review are so funny and so lego cool	positive
lt veers on feb 11 2008 1155 am said great review batbrick iamded got what he deserved xd xo  p great review batbrick this looks like a wonderful set i love that plane it doesnt bother me that its not minifig scale as it looks more for display imo wub looking forward to seeing the final model y peace	positive
thanks guys heres the final part the instructions for the boat begin on page 46 the overall set its actually much nicer than i thought it would be the pictures on the box make it look ugly top view tommy guns do not actually come with set  side view the designers have done an excellent job with the hull considering the lack of many slopes pieces you can see it is pretty much minifig scale too here you can see that by pushing in the red technic axle the anchor on the front will be hauled back into the boat back view these outboard motors are pretty cool though i wish they could go own into the water more overall though the weakest model its still a lot of fun and has a clever way around the lack of a shapely hull i was impressed with it after the building it it even has two rounded snotty bottom pieces on the nose of the boat to give the impression it is speeding through the water with the front lifting up lots of leftover pieces for this one the pieces sorry about the poor photograph there it was getting late  overall the cargo chopper is another great set in the fantastic creator line loads of fun great play and some clever designs it challenges you to make your own things and even includes some nifty pieces bley barrels wub  i wont give it a rating but ill just say i certainly recommend it to fans of the theme and lego fans in general now finally iamded and i teamup in the face of a larger foe get that lord of pies batbrick away 	positive

thanks for that nice review i still dont think i will get this set though the penguin on feb 18 2008 0504 pm said thank you for your wonderful review  i was done very well  i suggest that you will find twofaces escape set a very interesting one to build it also provides great playability and is not very expensive for what you will get  good day to you  yes twoface escape is definitly a good buy i suggest you get it	positive
hi asuka on feb 18 2008 0925 pm said congrats to that nice review i like the batcave set you should also been able to find it at discount try epay i found it there for 38 euro and picked up two of them nice price for loads of nifty material	positive
very nice review lord of pies thanks for taking the time to put this together and especially for all the detailed pics y i very much regret that my dark ages occured when they did basically i missed out on all the cheap and easy troop building sets and this one is certainly no exception the big sets are nice but these are the ones that always make me wish just a little harder for a return of lego pirates  i gave it a 4 out of 5 just because id buy 4 out of 5 sitting on the shelves today were it possible	positive
great little set i bought this set only a few years ago misb and i am still very happy about it the hut is simple but very effective as a castaway building on some deserted island the palmleaves are a good addition to any lego collection this set had a nice amount of weapons two for each pirate and two of those weapons are flintlock muskets as opposed to just pistols nice poll as well but you made sure nobody can give this set a 1 which is very nice but probably a little mistake d  i gave it the toprating y	positive
simonwillems on feb 19 2008 0747 pm said nice poll as well but you made sure nobody can give this set a 1 which is very nice but probably a little mistake d  i gave it the toprating y so i have oops i never was very good at maths p	positive
wow i remember this set from when i was a kid i got it for my birthday and opened the package first sadly i had to go to school so i had to leave it at home and not build it or play with it until i got home needless to say that was one of the longest days of school ever good review great set	positive
great small set that can help you add to you minifig count the little boats are always cool and the den isnt that bad either	positive
another firstrate review its a nice little set with a big number of minifigs and 2 flintlock guns is also a nice bonus	positive
woow d this was my first lego set ever	neutral
this set shows the awesomeness of classic pirate sets i really have to get me some more xd great review on a great set	positive
id give the set a 3 12 out of 5 it needed 1 more imperial to get a 4 a bigger basplate would have been nice as it appears to hard to fit all the minifigs on the island thanks for this great review	neutral
imo this is a very simple and small set good to add some part to forbidden island good	positive
why not they are all very nice i have all six of them especially the helicopter my least anticipated but one of the most detailed thanks for the review brainbox	neutral

mmmmh i wub love the train great review it looks like each model can be connected to the other to make a complete train y y it makes me want to get 3 of them or more to make a long one d	neutral
so here it is finally my first ever review of a lego setoh wait its actually 2 sets so i dont really know how to do it right but ill try the best sorry if some pictures are a litte bit dark but im not really into photography and i got bad light here lets start with the dwarfs mine defender theme castle 2008 set name dwarfs mine defender number 7040 pieces 86 price 999 eur first as always the box the back a few instructions on how the defender works for those how dont know   and the instructions we continue with the minifigs sorry i forgot to make a closeup of the dwarf and finally the mine defender itself i personally think it isnt as bad as maybe some people think the chain for the catapult is great i think i kinda love those controls the mechanism with the rubbe rband actually works pretty well but only on a notglossy underground thats pretty much all of it its small but i like it a lot so lets go on to the tower raid now which would be my absolute favorite of those new sets  theme castle 2008 set name tower raid number 7037 pieces 364 price 2999 eur again first the box  instructions we got 2 sets of instructios here one for the tower and one for the siege tower the minifigs we got one archer and one soldier here both with the torsos of the 2007 sets now thw orc side starting with the great leader with the new armor and the golden helmet i love those pieces closeup of the armor  helmet then we got another orcknight and the prisoner with handcuffs the crownie tower looks great overall though there is something i dont really like about it but later on that now the back and that is what really bothers me there areno walls on the first floor except the one with the wallpiece and the door and theprison also is open at the back the orc easily could jump out there not sure what these are all about they really dont add much to the set enough rant now lets go on with a pretty sweet detail the golden crystal on the little table the wall piece on the first floor you can ram in and finally the very best thing of this set the amazing orc siege tower from the front the great working ram you can pull it back very far and it got pretty much power here we got another sweet detail the siege platform that moves out by pulling a cord in the back of the tower finally a picture of a bit siege action if you ram in the lower wallpiece the brown shelfs of the prisonfloor collapse and the prisoned orc is finally free summary likes as i mentioned before i really think thats the best ever produced siege tower its got so mich details and works extremely well also the overall look of it is magnificant the destroymechanism of the tower is pretty cool too the brown door is a fine detail too nothing much to say about the mine defender i like this little set and theres nothing really to bother about it dislikes the back of the tower thats really the only thing thats a bit bad imo they could have put there 2 more walls on the first floor and something to lock the prison easily final thought the tower raid for me personally is the best of the 2008 sets so far its got great playability and looks simply good my opinion buy it	positive
tks for these cool reviews metalandi  i love these orc sets  i am so going to get these  im happy to see that scared face again i love it really  and the use of that handculfs  that new armour looks really cool that tower is really nice and i wont mod it that much which os cool and the battle ram is freaking sweet  tks again for sharing  yoda	positive
great review pictures and all thanks for showing all the mechanisms of the tower i didnt notice them from either the pics we had or the instructionsit didnt hit me that when you knock down the wall the second floor breaks that is a genius idea this looks like a superb set unfortunately my priority right now is the troll warship still if that really is us 80 i might skip it and go for this instead which is only 20 us one note though i think there might not be a back cage on the second floor of the tower so that the mechanism can work did you try to see if the second floor ground still falls if you add it a fourth cage wall also you could just pretend that the tower is built against a mountainside it would fit perfectly and add more defense to the knights great review  vk	positive
tks for those so much  y nice reviews i love that tower raid and the defender and will buy them both quote really dont add much to the set oh but they do more pieces higher price 	neutral
thanks for these fantastic review its the first time i take a good look at these sets there is a good chance ill buy the dwarfs mine defender especially for that price	neutral
this set didnt come with the new jail door piece id have guessed it would have since there is an orc in prison nice review im looking forward to picking up these sets steve	neutral
thank you for these fine reviews metalandi y therere really some nice playable features in the tower raid set and all these great orc torsos just sweet and it even looks like that black orcarmors a new piece lovely 	positive
cheers for the reviews theyre both nice sets and i think i just may have to buy both or maybe ill get two of the dwarf set the figs in each are really cool as well the dwarf well theyre just cool anyway but the troll with the golden helmet and armour thats just wub	positive
thanks for the double review i like the dwarf catapult but the real deal is the tower raid set i love that siege tower and love that new armour cant wait to get it thanks for the review batbrick away 	positive
thanks metalandi these are 2 great sets im definately looking forward to seeing these in new zealand stores the collapsing floorprisoner freeing mechanism on the tower is wonderful a great touch some slight modifications like some walls will make this perfect and the dwarfs mine defender is a sweet little set with some neat minifigs thanks for the reviews y peace	positive
thanks for these great reviews sweet the dwarfs mine defender looks interesting the figs though are wub the only thing missing is a weapon for the dwarf and some shields the battering ram and tower are awesome 8 the troll king with new torso helmet and body armor is simply amazing i like how the troll is handcuffed d the tower shows nice detail except for the poor brig  i love that gold crystal the battering ram is a thing of beauty 30 for the tower and ram and 10 for the defender are very well priced i still want the battle wheel more though damn exclusives   p	positive
thanks for the review i personally think the siege tower is probably the best one which lego has ever produced	positive
well i dont think orcs are that sturdy seeing that theyd have to jump from the second level of the tower i dont see survival as his chief objective p awesome review im loving these sets more and more the tower raid is definitely the best and the cheapest set there  oh and pirhana its not really a king its more like an officer remember the wizard rules these goblins edited by trooperdavinfelth 22 february 2008  0249 pm	positive
sweet wow another excellent review haha that tower does reminds me of kk ii of mistland tower x well overall i love these 2 sets very very much sweet	positive
thank you for the nice review pity the tower is not designed better but i still want to buy these 2 sets if only there were 2 dwarves in the dmdefender	neutral
i got myself today 3 dwarfs mine defender and i have to say that sets does suck big time the plastic rubber band doesnt do squat and 3 wheels i really not enough i only built 2 of those and changed the front of it with 4 wheels and no plastic rubber band and i changed the 2x2 dark bley plate its still looks good but the crappy rubber band system is really not well thought off anyhow my orc army is growing  yoda	negative
xwingyoda on mar 1 2008 0632 am said its still looks good but the crappy rubber band system is really not well thought off yoda i totally agreed with your comments the rubber system is not effective at all i bought 2 defenders recently and i found out that when the wheels move the rubber just stuck there without rotating the blades at the front  i have not really found a solution for mine yet so far i only took out the rubber band placing the blades on the ground removing of the red technic part on the left side in this way when the defender is moving on smooth ground the blades will move too 	negative
thanks for the great review y the siege tower does look great ill have to look out for these sets edited by zouave 14 march 2008  0724 pm	positive
hello eurobricks my first post yesterday i will buy this two sets im waiting for the packs sorry but my english isnt good	positive
theyre so beautiful 4 more months	positive
wow thats a great review im glad you took so many pictures this set is far better than i ever expected it to be the detail inside is great is it the first set youe given 100 to	positive
a great reveiw dunamis y  you have only backed up what i thought when the pictures first appeared if you are a lego fan there is no excuse not to buy this set it is a must have i love the mouse hole and the mouse and his cheese wub 	positive
very nice very nice indeed lots of lovely little details even at the back this review hasnt changed my opinion one bit im still looking forward to when i can finally pick up mine at the post office im crossing my fingers that there will be more buildings following after this one im guessing that legos just testing the waters to see how far afols are willing to go regarding price vs details green grocer is still epic though	positive
for some silly and quite delusional reason i thought that i had a chance to review this first d but yours is at your house and mine is hopefully winging its way to me  thanks for the review it will help me survive until mine arrives i love this set wub hopefully there will be many more stunning sets like this to come sweet xwingyoda on mar 8 2008 0803 pm said i didnt know green grocer had a rodent infestation  neither did i and i have looked through the instructions at least three times 	positive
what a beautiful set tlc give the designer a pay rise immedietly i was lucky to order one of these while they were on sale to us aussies  but dont worry lego the 100 you saved me will be spent on more sets like this carnt wait to watch my kids rescue residents in distress from those upper level windows with the fire fighters	positive
man these sets are so awesome incredible work done by the designers there must have took a long time to get all this ogether if they werent too expensive i would go and buy them all 3 right away wub	positive
damn it  what a great great review  i definitly love this set  burn credit card burn  youre the must in there dunamis  many thanks 	positive
great review great set i cant mine until after easter weeps	positive
this is a nice review thanks for all the great pictures	positive
truly an awesome review thanks dunamis i ordered my two copies one to build one to store in the vault last week cant wait to get this one the attention to detail here is what makes the set great theres nothing to criticize about this set its really the closest thing to perfection that i have seen from tlc the difference between this set and cc is the interior detail and because of that gg now become in my opinion the best set ever released by tlc do the ccggms sets fit well with the 50th anniv town plan my impression is that out of the box at least they dont which is too bad however i dont think it would be hard to mod the town plan so it looks like it belongs in the same town as ccggms these sets to me are what i have always wanted from tlc as an adult i hope they keep up the line and add more elements to this excellent lineup	positive
thanks for all the feedback as you can tell i really enjoyed building it cardinal brick on mar 8 2008 0926 am said is it the first set youe given 100 to yes it is i gave cafe corner a 96 and i felt this was a better set and improved on the things that i dinged cafe corner on lack of minifigs was one thing thats why i enjoy reading the comments so i can see if my ratings are in line with what everyone else thinks and to see if i missed anything i cant wait for some of you to build it and share your thoughts as well	positive
a very fine review with great and informative pictures thanks dunamis y and what a wonderful set a masterpiece and far beyond everything i wouldve expected just one year ago the amount of details is exceptional from the different railings to the mousehole and the radiator sheer brilliant  and two female mfs or hippies you never know and a child only one adult male character who nearly looks like well anyways its simply a milestone and a very creative and inspiring beauty wub easter parade on and sweet gg will you marry me 	positive
o m g i must have that set  y wub i remember you telling me that you were going to do a review of this set and i was so anxious i love these reviews thanks so much great pictures wub y y this will dent my wallet 8 i am so envious	positive
a very informative review indeed thank you so much for doing so now i know that the price is worth every penny leaving my pocket  what do you guys think is tlc putting up as the next modular set is it asking too much of tlc to produce 1 modular set each quarter 4 times a year	positive
a million thanks for this review this is greater than i thought i especially like that clock im going to get this set as soon as possible	positive
afol sf on mar 8 2008 0629 pm said a very informative review indeed thank you so much for doing so now i know that the price is worth every penny leaving my pocket  what do you guys think is tlc putting up as the next modular set is it asking too much of tlc to produce 1 modular set each quarter 4 times a year i would vote for a bank next	neutral
really cool set this has convinced me that i really want it	positive
looks like you have the original 1989 version with the yellow top cylinders  i got one too several years ago although i probably paid too much for it p on a side note if that pneumatic tubing feels harder and stiffer than the modern type i highly recommend that you dont use it and buy some of the newer stuff off bricklink instead tlc originally used a different material for the tubes and this stuff degrades the nozzles on pistons switches and so on over time the old tubes also grip the nozzles much more firmly and if you arent careful when removing them its actually possible to rip off the nozzles completely xo i had this happen a few years ago although tlc replaced my broken pistons for free i got rid of that stuff for good after that although the pistons on my power crane still have slightly discolored nozzles edited by cp5670 10 march 2008  0457 am	neutral
cp5670 on mar 10 2008 0553 am said the old tubes also grip the nozzles much more firmly and if you arent careful when removing them its actually possible to rip off the nozzles completely xo i actually noticed that while taking it apart but didnt really pay any attention i just thought thats because its an old part well thanks for the information	neutral
simonwillems on mar 10 2008 0132 pm said that threaded axle never stopped intriguing me it was use in so few sets i believe 8851 contained one as well and i still dont know why its better than any other axle the purpose of the threaded axle is to carry tension regular axles are used primarily for carrying torsion for gears sometimes for compression 8855 landing gear helicopter skids and sometimes just for looks roll cages canopies but used in tension connectors will usually just pop off with the threads and the corresponding nuts this part can be used to squeeze parts together like the pen in the plotter of 8094 or to hold heavy assemblies onto turntables like 8862 and 8851 with the power crane 8854 reviewed here that is the complete list of sets which used this part i wrote about it here httpwwwericalbre1984htmlparts eric	neutral
as i bought it i didnt even know i would also get a box it just said all parts with building instructions after opening the parcel i was like woah woooaaahhh and so on  i love legoboxes because as a child i stood in the toy stores starring at the boxes only seeing the front and the back nothing more this brings back some memories 	positive
thank you very much for that review	positive
i bought it some years ago for the bmodel and like it so much d	positive
this was my first pneumatic set	neutral
hi this is my third oldschool technic set review i dont want to talk much please enjoy just the pictures 1 the parts 2 building the two axles you can see in the middle are not connected and dont belong to each other the axle on the left side is for the steering on the right side for the engine the darkgray technic gear 16 tooth with clutch allows the connection from the differential gear to the engine trough the axle for the steering the v6engine the winch thats a part you dont see everyday a 1x2 rack it only reappears in 2 sets from 2001 and 2004 the rebel wrecker has been released in 1994 the front double wishbone with antisway barsuspension yeah i got it from technopedia xd  the finished model 3 random shots i really like this picture authoritative isnt it 8 d thanks for viewing the pictures please comment if you want to	neutral
yeah if i rebuild and wash a model i will record it glad to see you liked it	positive
this set is really cool i might actually get it	positive
ah a good old retro review those old school days had some pretty impressive sets with alot more complexity than modern sets if you have it may i recommend 8880	positive
the only original stickers are the front headlightpatterns on the 2 red 1x2 bricks the others have been destroyed  must have been the bad decaying sticker quality that breaks when youll remove it  so i printed them i didnt print the flag for only the alternate model needs it although its a neat idea and lordgalewind clickey i keep that in mind one of my 8880 is already dusty enough	negative
thanks youve just motivated me to go on a senselesspreliminarydesignerrorshunt a few things ive discovered left side alternate model the steering link can only be put in place with a little violence the handlebar  is turned far more than its actually possible although the wheels are straight right side the 1x8 tile simonwillems pointed out the half bush right next to it is cantfindthewords wrong could be that the technic triangle is missing the windscreen 1x6 technic plates are mounted with 12 pins instead of axle pins with half bushes who can find more xd	neutral
hmm seems like the wheels are recycled into the harley truck in the 2008 batman set	neutral
natelite on mar 10 2008 0557 pm said hmm seems like the wheels are recycled into the harley truck in the 2008 batman set nope the harleytruckwheels are thinner and somewhat more modern i do believe theyre the same like in 8274 aaaaaaaand for a long time in my life these wheels have been the best and coolest looking ive ever had so wheres your deference d recycled  xd	positive
ive seen a few cases like this where the box pictures are slightly different from the actual model the airtech claw rig compressor is another one that comes to mind the changes sometimes seem pointless and make you wonder why they bothered p quote the only original stickers are the front headlightpatterns on the 2 red 1x2 bricks the others have been destroyed  must have been the bad decaying sticker quality that breaks when youll remove it  so i printed them i didnt print the flag for only the alternate model needs it although its a neat idea the other stickers on mine have held up pretty well although i didnt try to remove them after i put them on the flag started to break after a year or so and just fell off its axle at one point i taped over it and its holding up well now although its a little frayed along one edge this is actually the earliest set ive seen that uses this crappy sticker material which is unfortunately very common today even other technic sets had good stickers for many years after that	negative
bernddasbrot on mar 10 2008 0556 pm said youve just motivated me to go on a senselesspreliminarydesignerrorshunt man this set is a disaster what were they thinking d p i just remembered one other fun aspect of this set the crane hook can be attached to the underside of the rear bumper to hold it in position while driving along but when things are like this and you try and wind up the cable the winch is strong enough to break the original provided lego rope it worked with my copy d so this set is capable of demolishing itself but still one of the best technicsets i have with all stickers intact im not so sure about that flag though must check on that	positive
a neat review of a cool set with very informative pictures thanks bernddasbrot y	positive
i can remember that ive seen a few color variations on brickshelf and on ebay they sold well its new and familiar at the same time that makes it more interesting	positive
reread your review today great pictures this is a fabulous model got this model a few months ago for just € 25 it is small and has great working parts i love the way the frontsuspension is made epic i only had the lightstickers replaced with transclear bricks btw the gear rack has been used in this years 8048 buggy	positive
i also happened to receive this set this weekend virtually misb the seals on the side of the box were loose however everything inside was untouched this little beast a joy to build and even more so to play with as indicated by eric on the technicopedia page its crammed with functions for a mediumsized set i think i love it even more than my son does	positive
i read blackbirds technopedia page on this truck the other week went onto ebay and picked up a misb copy for £25 gbp bargin great to get old sets unopened peeling the plastic off of the specialist parts was always cool love the front suspension	positive
that price is exceptional its less than what i paid for mine 9 years ago and is even less than the original price of the set note that the stickers in this set are the bad variety that will crack and peel over time if you want to preserve them the technic flag in particular you will need to tape over it	neutral
somehow i also managed to get this set in very good condition including box instructions and all stickers for a mere €22 a few months ago this is indeed a very special set and was a pleasure to build the only flaw i noticed was weak support of the rear drivetrain which was easily corrected with a few extra plates	positive
junkstylegio on mar 23 2010 1117 pm said huh like where dont have that much problems with that rear train at least if i you dont trow the model down the stairs or something like that maybe its unusual but this section of the drive train didnt hold that well on my model this is how it looks now the parts made redundant were left in the built model thats why theres that useless 8tooth gear there p	neutral
hello my dear friends heres something new i am actually making a review with pictures yes i got a new camera for christmas now i was testing to see how the camera would reflect so some of the pics are a bit blurry i have based this review from dunamiss reviews he is my inspirationso without further ado i bring you the review set  7693 name etx alien strike price 1999 1299 pieces 246 box okay so as you can see below the box is pretty simple as always european versions wont have the piece count name etc just the number i believe mine having the american version has the info on it as you can see it has the classic mm logo and the red planet as well as the set in a pose itself very nice i linked it because the pic wasnt resizing httpwwwbrickshelkedscn0017jpg below is the back of the box it shows the other sets and some features of this set contents next we have the contents this set includes a medium sized dss xwingyoda a bag labeled one and huge bag labeled two the 1 bag contains a smaller bag and the two bag includes two smaller bags 5 bags in all also pictured are the instructions i have linked it due to the nonresize httpwwwbrickshelkedscn0019jpg figs included in this set are three figs two jellies and 1 astro the jeelies are fine but i pefer the lom ones but they glow those new alien commanders for summer look promising though the astro is nice and includes an extra gold visor moc on astro miner in all mm sets there is a human and alien set the astro par of this set is a miniminer here is a pic of construction and that wonderful space logo sticker not much of a cockpit  finished minerthe set number too overall i like the miner and it is nicely designed i feel the cockpit is lacking though aliens the alien vehical is the main part of the set this pic shows the beginning steps solid and sturdy but those four axlespin partsblue are pointless no support and they dont get used at all nice tlc  now we get cooking this pic shows the tail added on and the more bulk being built we get a little repetitive and build the craft up in this pic and this pic from the instructions shows how the alien craft transforms for battle the completed set and extra bits parts 810 figs 810 price per piece ration 910 playability 910 overall 85 the alien craft is great the attack feature is nice and there are a ton of trans green parts the alien falls out of the cockpit when turned upside down i love this set and its perfect for mm fans or beginnersit has nice parts and read the above part for more details gallery when moderated keep an eye out for future reviews please comment 	positive
thanks for the great review vbbn y i already own 2 of these xd on your camera there should be a little flower sign switch to that to go to micro mode  its a really good first review y sweet	positive
a nice review well done y the set itself doesnt look quite interesting to me compared with some of the newer ones like 7647 or 7648 the way the driver fits into the cockpit looks not very clever and pretty uncomfortable as well xd	negative
thanx for the review i have one question do these aliens have moving arms as far as the set goes i think lego did a bad job on the alien ship i dont think any of the alien ships look good in mars mission the human fanction got a lot better this year and i would have bought this buggy if it came by its self	negative
sweet first pic review y i got this set for a birthday present last year and it is pretty fun overall the alien ship in this set is actually one of my favorites it just looks cool and the way you can fold it out is really clever the only negative for me is the cockpit of the mining unit not really because it isnt detailed but because mine is top heavy and keeps falling forward its kinda funny if you think about him driving along and then falling forwardbut not funny at all when youre playing 	positive
cool review makes me want to get the set y	positive

thanks for the review i do like this set though i am not a fan of the jelly aliens though the alien ship looks good with the curved parts and flip open and close design	positive
well as bad a concept aliensvshumans is for a theme i really do like this set the human rover has nice parts for reuse especially those oldschool space wheels and despite those wobbly wings i really like the alien ship goes from a flying saucerish shape to a spread winged almost raven shape very ominous and cool looking now that alien commander is terrible if i dont buy bionicle minifigs already why would i be interested in that thing kinda wish theyd take the drones from the retiring exoforce theme and do them in green theyd make nice alien robot things	positive

hi this is my forth oldschool technic set review since blakbird pointed out that all my technic reviews are red i chose a yellow dune blaster for today just kidding this set is red as it should be dont worry my next reviews will be yellow and black uhhh forshadowing   i will start with some facts 277 elements and released in 1994 thats enough 1 the box 2 the parts 3 building instructions and catalogues wow no folds no wear marks  simply wub was lesen coole kids  klick das super magazin fuer coole kids how obvious 4 building no differential i really love the way the 1x8 technic bricks on the sides will be positioned later fun fact the engine contains no 2ltechnic axle and finished a real quick build 5 spare parts for the alternate model the yellow technic handle should be from 8412 maybe a bonus feature from the seller 6 random shots 7 final thoughts this is my second 8829 and i also noticed that the engine turns very hard the alternate model is really sorry to all those of you who like it crappy i mean a nice idea but not with this wheels  anyway a really beautiful technicset reminiscing this word exists does it thanks for viewing the pictures i hope you enjoyed it please comment if you want to edited by bernddasbrot 21 march 2008  0209 pm	positive
that looks like a very nice set  in your opinion how does it compare to the current dune buggy toa of justice	positive
i dont own the 8296 but what i can see from the pictures i would say that 8296 is very similar to 8829 the only things that are different ist that 8296 is studless and features a steering wheel for the seat but 8829 has got bigger wheels  it also would have been nice if the wheels from 8296 could have the same tread	neutral
toaofjustice on mar 21 2008 0810 am said that looks like a very nice set  in your opinion how does it compare to the current dune buggy toa of justice imho 8829 is much better than 8296 first 8829 is a lot bigger i really like the huge rear balloon tires they both have rack and pinion steering and they both have trailing arm rear suspension with a v2 engine i think the body on 8829 is a little more well done for 8296 i think the alternate tractor model is much better for more comparisons see technicopedia eric	positive

hello all apologize for digging out a such old post recently i got a bag of lego technic parts where there have been mixed three sets 8858 8829 and 8235 the resurrection of 8858 has been described by me in a separate post going back to the dune buggy – when i saw it for the first time back in 1994 i did not like it as i was always big fan of 8840 which i consider to the day the best looking buggy and set 8829 looked to me ugly so there were those all parts in the bag… then i though why not build it  and i started to do it when i finished i was very surprised how the final look of this set is really taking my words back unfortunately in the bag there were missing some parts and i could not rebuild the back spoiler so i made some changes to it and make it from spare parts that i have and it came out acceptable i also added some additional parts such as “fake” steering wheel “rally” logo antennas i have also reverse mounting of the rear tires – why lego did them like that i never know – as i think they look better this way set well the review has been already made by owner of this post so i will only add few things into it engine – v2 aired cooled is driven by 4 gears  from the single wheel no differential as in 8840 using two old school z14 tooth bevel  then by z24 tooth crown and z8 tooth type 1 actually the as in most old sets the pistons are moving very fast not as in current sets and smooths – i needed to extra clean all engine parts as there was a lot friction suspension – set has “engine bay” working using two old gray shock absorbers 65l – the movement is not big but works very nice better then in 8840 in my opinion steering – this is a bit odd as there is no direct connection to hog as in most old sets but first the gear rack is moved by z8 then two z14 tooth where reverse movement is taking place later connection of two old school z14 tooth bevel goes to hog details – this is the most that i like in this set specially how the use of axle pin connector perpendicular and 1x10 bricks with 3x3 cut corners and plate 1x5 toothed ends 2 studs with center axle hole are making the body shape – is just wonder tires – the balloon rear are pretty nice the front is a new version of those that were in 8840 what i do not like 1 missing of technic figure 8840 had it 2 no steering wheel in the original set 3 no differential – but having in mind that lego has introduce 2412 teeth would be difficult to build the transmission in such small space where the engine is i will shortly upload new pictures and post them here later on  over all – i think it is worth buying it as it is very payable  actually very payable and runs smoothly  the steering suspension – perfect thank you and regards	positive
wow this buggy was my very first lego set i like this review  it remembered my childhood i also liked its body with those 8 studs long bricks on sides i can also remember trying to build engine in such way that it works smooth without success anyway i think its studless version  set 8048 is much better	positive

thanks for the review it looks beautiful my father was a backhoe driver so understandably i used to drool over this set in the catalogs i never did get it though as lego was so expensive in australia then i had around 2000 pieces and i thought i had loads d anyway last year i bought 8455 which i love it works great with a compressor i made too sweet i wish mine had a real cab though  do you have 8455 as well id love to see how they compare side by side it looks bigger than 8455 but i dont own any of the big old chuncky tires so i find it so hard to tell by the way i have been reading all of your reviews but i have been a bit busy of late so i havent had time to comment i hope you have more planned any chance of a supercar one	positive
another nice review the slow shutter speed pictures are great i think that was the only set with 8 distinct functions for a very long time and was only displaced by the 8455 backhoe in that respect the turntable on the back doesnt turn very well though as the weight is all distributed on one side the screw axle prevents it from popping off but there is still a lot of friction in it i dont have mine built anymore but it might be worth trying to put a weight brick or something on it quote do you have 8455 as well id love to see how they compare side by side it looks bigger than 8455 but i dont own any of the big old chuncky tires so i find it so hard to tell yeah its quite a bit bigger when everything is fully extended it becomes something like 26 long although the 8455 actually has morebetter functionality edited by cp5670 24 march 2008  0815 am	positive

bernddasbrot on mar 24 2008 0508 pm said there are 324 axle nuts on bricklink with an avg price of 089 but i wants it cheap sing and i would still call 324 quite rare and i also want to just tack it onto another order sad	negative
yeah i meant theyre rare  but i can imagine that a normal axle with the old half bushes will help sometimes these are really strong if you put 23 in a row edit i just tried it a normal 10l axle with 2 interlocking old half bushes type 1 on each end i chose those who only can be moved very hardly along an axle i slewed the bjst  back arm a few times tried the pneumatics parallel to it and it didnt loose edited by bernddasbrot 24 march 2008  0606 pm	neutral
quote there are 324 axle nuts on bricklink with an avg price of 089 i didnt know of this accessoryset 51102 you can buy it for 4000 8 i was thinking of getting one of those off bl several years ago back when the price used to be more like 15 or so but i realized that i hardly ever use the couple that i already have p they came out with the modern turntable the year after this set which mostly negated the need for these screw axles i think their only use now is to hold nonlego objects onto models like the technic pen in 8094 i guess you can try to make linear actuators out of them but theyre often too rare and fragile for that	neutral

bernddasbrot on mar 23 2008 0232 pm said hi this is my forth preoldschool review as promised a yellowset  my 8862 arrived today survived the washing machine coaster and actually was real fun to build the finished “boom  jib  scoop thing” bjst  xd thanks for viewing the pictures i hope you enjoyed it another great review and a wonderful set of pictures i like your nomenclature for the bjst acronyms always sound nicely scientific much better than digger no one would know you made it up until they found out what it means i also really like what i will call your kinetic photos they convey a sense of motion and show the range of the mechanism without the big file sizes of animations how long of a shutter speed did you use the secret to not getting too much friction in the turntable is using extra nuts and jamming them together you dont want to actually clamp the nuts tight across the turntable you want to jam two nuts tightly together at each end which prevents them from unwinding but still leave a little free play gap this way it will hold the assembly together but not prevent it from moving mine moves quite easily this same concept is used on the pen plotter or 8094 slewed i think thats a word how about slewn or slain or slewifacated i think rotated is best sweet eric	positive
by the way dont forget to build the alternate model of 8862 it is a combine farm equipment which is just as good as 8274 i liked it so much that i bought two copies of this set so i could display both my favorite alternate model not counting universal sets is the 8480 submarine maybe it is time for a white set review skull white is pretty rare for your blue set i recommend you review 8462 there are only a couple of green sets and 8479 is the best and then of course 8458 is silver i think we all know what the best black set is and according to your photography you have lots of them but dont forget 8868 eric	positive
bernddasbrot on mar 25 2008 0346 am said 15 seconds wow thats a long exposure i would think you would get way too much light and overexpose the image the aperture must have been tiny quote i will review it too and post it in this topic cool i am also planning to write about the combine on technicopedia combine quote actually i took it from your site xd i thought that word sounded familiar quote unfortunately i dont own 8480 but i think 8824 is also a very good though small white set 8462 rocks as a blue set i just got it a few weeks ago lets see 8462 also is one of the last technic sets i would call oldschool 8479 okay too but 8458 is imho not 8868 and the totally mysteriously black set will follow you dont own 8480 that is unacceptable it is imperative that you put a mortgage on your house immediately to get it sweet yes 8824 is a good white set i also see from your room photos that you have the 8839 supply ship which has lots of white this is a really nice set 8462 is hard to call old school but at least it uses regular beams the air tanks are the best part of the set i wish lego had used them more often especially on the highly pneumatic sets the tank makes all the difference on 8459 you are right 8458 is certainly not old school but it is a great set with wonderful suspension it is of the same era as the super street sensation with all of the panels for body contouring 8868 is technic at its best there is nothing else like it especially with the compressor quote did you had something like this in mind if the toothed 10l axle rotates the axle nuts want to rotate too but they cant because of that 2x4 technic plate so theyll decide to move along the axle the 1x6 bricks on each end make sure that the axle wont move in or out thanks for your feedback while the assembly you have drawn would work as a linear actuator i would not recommend it the torsional stiffness and strength of an axle are proportional to the polar moment of inertia a section property most of the stiffness comes from the outside of the cross shaped axle but in the threaded axle you lose all the stiffness of the outer area because it is not continuous this means you only get stiffness and strength from the small core i think the threaded axle would bend and break very easily if subjected to much torque eric	neutral
quote 8462 rocks as a blue set i just got it a few weeks ago lets see 8462 also is one of the last technic sets i would call oldschool 8479 okay too but 8458 is imho not yeah the tow truck was the last set that still used mainly studded beams they made many changes to technic the following year with models becoming predominantly studless and making heavy use of the flexible axleshoses and decorative panels the technic logo and box art style was also changed a lot i really like the overall construction of that set the model is fairly lightweight but extremely sturdy it must be one of the strongest large sets theyve released quote did you had something like this in mind thats basically the idea as blakbird said though it wouldnt be very powerful and would put the axle under some stress the linear actuators theyre bringing out this year do the same thing and should work much better	positive
im very sorry for that doublepost i made a picture for you sinner but forgot to upload it your dad patrick parrot driving a giant backhoe sadly his second job as photojournalist and the fact that bianca lamb was strolling by distracted him as a consequence he spoiled the whole construction site bringing death and doom with a technic backhoe to fabuland and a little walrus baby y p	neutral
a great review i only have new sets so looking at old ones like this is great i would suggest multiple pictures blended together afterwards instead of the long exposure pictures bernddasbrot on mar 23 2008 1132 pm said now you can recognize the backhoes real shape only with a little violence it’s possible to lift the bonnet  through the pneumatic pump arent you supposed to fit the bonnet over the pump and then attach it to the main frame  front	positive
some time ago i sort of complained about the fact that there was not much technic represented in the eurobricks community this was the topic if someone is interested i am glad to see someone took that complaint serious and started reviewing technic sets on large scale to show us how fascinating the theme really is this review is once again an excellent one i really enjoyed reading it i must buy this set sometime soon because i always liked the threeway pneumatic system it came with and the overall look of the machine for many years it seemed out of reach much to expensive and hard to come by as a kid now as an adult there are many ways to acquire this wonderful set keep on reviewing y	positive
this is a review of speed racer set 8159 raxer x vs taejo this is my second review and the first review of this paticular set and the only one on eurobricks at the moment xd so without further ado i present to you my review i like that saying so much i decided to use it again in this review its originally from my review of 8158 which can be seen here note sorry that this review got delayed but there was a hostile takeover of the computer xo dont worry everythings fine now xd set 8159 racer x vs taejo theme speed racer price 1999us pieces 237 minifigs 2 note 2 i did not take photos of just the new pieces this time because theyre the same new pieces as in 8158 just in diff colors if you want to see a picture of them click here first off pictures of the box instructions dss and minifigs not quite as many stickers as set 8158 but there still are quite a few can you guess which ones which d yes taejos hair really is red and black for racer xs head tlg just reused the baddies head from 7620  now onto the build first racer xs x racer d thats not its official name i think  back end of the car the cockpit and yeah there are no seats for racer xs hiny just a flat 2x2 dark bley plate the cockpit and rearend of the car connect using an sshaped connector piece the front part of the car the fornt and the cockpit are also connected using an sshaped connector piece adding some details including yellow fenders the underside of the car so far adding some more detail newly added motor vents and smooth details adding a front bumper amongst other things side view of the car so far no backseat driving wait a minute theres no backseat the underside with newly added axles demonstrating how hubcap piece is put on the car now onto taejos grr glorious red racer p front part of the car cockpit regular seats check cocpit and rearend of the car connected using sshaped connector piece adding some detail the front part of the car front and cockpit connected also using the sshaped connector piece adding some fenders to the car underside of the car so far adding some smooth details taejos is the only car with an actual hood side view of the car so far underside of the car with axels now some finished shots of both cars first racer xs fine black and yellow racer reminds me of an older ferrari from this angle up close and personal im guessing the 3 holes are exhaust outlets racer x rollin now its time for taejos red racer i couldve sworn i ordered some hubcaps guess who taejo racer x admiring taejos fine red automobile up close with big red rearend shot of the car i challenge you racer x taejo racer x bein a complete badass and smokin taejo  now for some comparison shots the silver pocket knife is just to hold up taejos car now a shot of the extra pieces now if you combine 8158 with 8159 you get this go go go now its time for the summary this set is an excellent buy at 20 dollars its well designed and has lots of details it also has very unique minifigs which are always good in a set its only downfalls are the lack of acessories for the minifigs and that there are no cool contraptions on the cars and by cool i mean lethal to the other racers now to the scoring of the set price1010 pieces 810 too many stickers for such a small set minifigs 1010 unique and creative playability 910 would have been perfect except for the lack of acessories and cool contraptions on the cars but both are easily modifiedfixed hence the nine overall 3740 a great set bonus try and count how many times my silver pocket knife appears and win the knowledge of knowing how many times the silver pocket knife appears p d this concludes the review more pictures of either set 8158 or 8159 or both available through request via pming me  see ya next time folks of course i dont mean that literally xd  general tarful edited by imperialshadows 01 june 2008  1205 pm	positive

as promised and with only a single day of delay is my review of the 2008 set 4994 creator fierce creatures this small set is the same size and price range as last years 4939 cool cars reviewed by prateek and dillthepill the box general info you get 193 pieces vs 206 for cool cars which is quite a lot but most of them are small there are a lot of hinges and some good slopes and wings the building instructions contains three models but no further ideas for inspiration primary model spider the first model is a big spider which shares some similarities to the secondary model of 4895 power in the design the legs each have 3 joints where the ones in the middle have stud joints to be moved sideways while the rest use hinges for all joints there are 8 of them and it does get a little tedious with all the repetitive building in this relatively small model i like the design of the face with a lot of eyes and a big and ugly mouth but the real gem is the xpattern on the opisthosoma made using doubleinverted slopes it is poseable and i think it looks more fierce when inverted secondary model snake the face of the snake is nicely detailed with a splitting tongue and a mouth than can move a little there is a problem with the construction it uses stacked hinges for some of the joints which are hard to pull apart without stressing the pieces tertiary model fly im not completely sure what this insect is i will say its a fly although the tail and head are too pointy this is a neat little thing conclusion primary model 8 it is a good design but lacks some sturdiness in the legs they fall off a little too easily secondary models 6 they are pretty good when you look at the bricks that are available but they dont wow you in any way and they suffer from the same issues as the primary model regarding sturdiness alternate models 3 it is hard to come up with alternate models with so many small pieces and plates that are only 1 stud wide the colors might make you want to build a spyrius space ship playability 8 the models have many movable joints and you can put quite a scare into your minifigs when their town gets attacked by these creatures unless some en forces are there to protect them price 6 creator sets are known for their great price to bricks ratio but this set doesnt quite measure up to sets like cool cars pieces 7 the pieces arent great by themselves but who doesnt need a fist full of hinges slopes and basic plates in standard colors i dont think this is a musthave set like the big rig was last year the pieces are great and it has a nice primary model but the set lacks a bit when it comes to the usual strong creator qualities like alternate models and price brickshelf gallery edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0630 pm indexed	positive
thank you for your detailed review lasse d y the only problem about this set is that most of the people here will regard this as a pure parts pack xd oooh  i just found out about the red teeth  cool i want that wub	positive
enchanted island 6278 pictorial review original price 66 pieces 412 figures 7 this 1994 set marked the beginning of a new era for lego pirates  it became a theme more centralised around playability and not so much grand ol ships 6278 enchanted island was the flagship set of the islanders subtheme heavily based around polynesian and native american concepts in fact tlc was successfully sued by a number of tribes for using bastardised maori names such as kahuka it was released as a legend set in 2001 but due to poor sales was discontinued again the largest of the islander sets enchanted island is a portion of an island with a river running through the left hand side features some sturdy buildings built into a treelike structure on a rocky outcrop whilst the left hand side features a tower built out of wooden posts and a large tribal statue the box cover shows all the details it does however differ from the instructions finished product in that it has been more aesthetically arranged  bushes etc have been moved to fill in gaps and to not obscure other things the sides of the box show nothing particularly special although in one scene it depicts the islander canoe chasing the pirate boat with the treasure just one way to play with the set the back of the box however is superb featuring a large number of alternative models a toothy statue a pirate tree think wolfpack with an islander base kahukas throne a firebreathing statue and a soupedup boat for the pirates these and many more can be easily made because of the large diversity of pieces the set has a huge number of minifigures for its size the third highest number in the pirate range the ses and the bsb being first and second respectively  a whopping 7 5 islanders including the alltoocommon king kahuka the elusive islander babe and 3 standard warriors  this set alone will never leave you short of enemies 2 pirates ironhook in his standard attire with a scurvy dog at his side attack the island although they are only moderately armed  2 cutlasses and a pistol between them a musket wouldve been nice the islanders on the other hand have 4 shields a bow and quiver and 6 spears not to mention the big pokey thing with horns on top weapon idol staff a monkey parrot and crocodile provide the obvious creature features with a fair amount of gold to finish off in the instructions the goblet does not have the lid although it does on the box its a nice touch anyway  adding a little more diversity to the monotonous treasure stashes the pirates boat is a nice 2 sail vessel with oars for when the wind stops and a treasure map the sails are similar to those in lagoon lockup but with an extra front sail its an awesome little boat better for raids than a rowing boat but not too big that it cant sail up rivers it can comfortably fit 2 men and at a squeeze 5 the sails are expensive if you buy them seperately normally this wont be a problem but they can cost aroun 5 each the islanders boat is a canoe with a sail and an outrigger to stabilise it the sail is beautifully done with 2 spars taughtening it there is a clip for the rower to leave his weapon when at se and the mast can turn to get as much wind as possible its quite a topheavy boat but it doesnt look hideous and without the mastsail it looks great 3 islanders can fit in it and more if they sit on the outrigger the markings on the canoe are stickers but they look fine and are probably more robust than markings for their job furthermore theyre waterproof sing kahukas throne can be carried by 2 loyal subjects or strapped to his pet crocodile the clips on the side can be used to rest his weaponry or hold spears for battle the throne looks nice although im not too sure about the blue against the red  id have prefered white as it would clash less an overview of the island it is built in 2 halves  left then right and then joined together loosley so it can be seperated for transporting around the back to the left and right there are large open spaces that are great for battles  this set isnt so much about a large solid build but creating a village  smaller structures linked by bridges and the back to the far left is a platform built onto the rock with access from the river via a ladder theres the standard islander drum with the lovely zebraskin part where did they get that ive never understood the white flag  i was under the impression it was used for surrender further along the rocky bank there are some hinged palm leaves that swing upwards to reveal the treasure its an ok hiding place not the best place to hide it right where the pirates sail past but it feels fabulous it fits right in above it on the rocky bank is the main structure it looks very disjointed when you build it bricks all over the place but once its done it looks nice and rural with leaves everywhere and the balcony where kahuka is standing you get a nice roof made from 2 large palm leaves tilting down around the back theres a slight shelter a table for picnics and a ladder to access the upstairs i was rather annoyed that it is so open but the set is designed from just one perspective to the left is the bridge to the other building a nice one piece bridge made of the softer plastic used for muskets and the post1991 cutlasses it looks good but be warned it tilts when you pull a pin sending the pirates flying this contraption is a good idea but it is very stiff and so doesnt swing even when burdened by a minifigure  youll want to modify this bit if you get it the other building looks like it is made out of posts and beams they are all red brown would have been better but it would have added too many colours to the range just like the use of black for trees in some forestmen sets there are 3 clips for spare weapons only 2 of these will ever be used when all the islanders are armed but it gives the pirates scope once theyve been disarmedtheres another nice palm tree roof on top 2 ladders give accesstheres a total of 4 in this set  worth getting eh although theyre 5p on bricklink for a kabob theyre like gold at the top theres another hidey hole the palm leaves lift up on hinges to show the treasure or hiding islander it can be seen from behind but this set is designed from one perspective only nice cattlehorns tooalongside the slats you can see in the floor  5 years later and it wouldve been a solid plate the big statue is one of the main selling point of this set alongside the tilting bridge  theyre the action features shown in every catalogue at the time but it is not really special just original the statue fits in with the theme perfectly  kahukas mask his shield and this statue all depict the same deity which is a nice collectible idea the back is rather plain except the angled 1x1 bricks  a good touch im not sure why theres a black brick in the back of the head but this is easily remedied it could even be done with a brick from this same set just swapping the two over aside from the head turning the back can open to store sacred objects or in my opinion prisoners hence the gaps for breathing either way its a lovely piece of architecture and deservedly a flagship element of the set theres your standard cooking pot floating around although a 1x1 yellow stud as human flesh remember minifigs are yellow no matter what the licensed themes say is a superb finish this set is a stunning set for both kids and afols who are just getting back into legopirates  it is a great army builder and due to its release as a legend is extremely cheap on ebay  you should be able to pick one up for £18 or £15 if youre lucky for that you get a lifetimes supply of islanders 4 ladders some wall panels 2 baseplates one raised and both with rivers and printed vegetation around the edge a ton of weapons a fair quantity of standard bricks but most of all a heap of vegetation this is an easy to buy set with normally around 5 on ebay at any time and is well worth it for the parts the play and the nostalgia it can be easily modified when used in conjunction with any other outpost a much larger fortress can be made especially if more rope bridges are used if you pick 2 of this fine set off ebay itll still be less than the original price a huge complex can be constructed giving you an instantaneous village for around £35 other information lugnet rating

thank you for review very good army builder i see	positive
thanks for a lovely review i only recently bought this set off ebay pretty good deal misb for 30 euros and i enjoyed putting it together and mixing it with the other piratesets when you put two sets of two baseplates together youll get a large pond with an island in the center just to achieve that i bought two more baseplates off ebay the result is this moc i always loved the islanders and have most of the sets not all of them but that is going to change in the future y	positive
a mighty fine review youve created slyowl y after some sleep i shall immerse myself more fully within it	positive
nice review  although im pretty sure eldorado fortress has 8 minifigs making this set no 4 in the minifig count i gave it a 5 the number of islanders and vegetation pieces comes in very handy for land based scenarios ive got 3 copies of this set 1 of them costing me less than 2euros from an ebay auction in scotland along with forbidden island its easily one of the most common and affordable pirate sets to be found on he second hand market	positive
a great and informative review with very fine pictures thanks slyowl sweet a wonderful set this is indeed full of nice details and pretty playable and a cool subtheme that offers a lot of fantasy and charming characters in a marvelous layout i really love that little boat with the outrigger and the neat buildings and sweet landscaping works together very well tlc got sued for using some names of native sounding origin now that sounds really strange to me such names´re widely spread within novels movies and such stuff i didn´t know that there´s some kind of copyright on them 8	positive
good review mr slyowl and good pics too i know it probably deserves better but i only give him a 3 ill be surely the only saying that i dont like this set but i remember i had it for christmas when i was a child and it disappointed me very much because i expected it much larger after seeing it in the lego catalogs well its just a little trauma i had p lol anyway i must admit its an interesant set specially because of the large number of minifigures and accesories it brings with and the two little ships edited by bluebard 31 march 2008  0113 am	positive

eldiano thank you for posting about your desire to have this set i do own the set and i do recommend it to others if they somehow find a used one the bricks are kind of sparse but the the bricks it does come with are really nice i love the figs and the base plates are by far my favorite made by tlg captain braunsfeld i suggest that you read through the link that covers topic bumping more clearly i apologize for the confusion eldiano i do believe that i have found a way to remove the confusion of posting in old topics soon among the pirate staff and to the other members of eb please stay tuned sinner on 18 july 2010  0316 am said 3 lego reviews dont date thus if you have something relevant to say then feel free to post in a topic but if its more than a few months old please make sure its good and if its been a few years it better be really good for example if you liked the review or set and want to say so you probably shouldnt if youve got an answer to a question such as does anyone have pictures of the alternate model then by all means post what you shouldnt do is ask questions to the original poster heshe may not even visit eb any more	positive
i realized that building the chess set from the new pirates theme they are two grey heads that reminded me of the king kahuna throne which goes to say that i am hoping they bring back new sets i just wish they were bigger i would love to build the old ones but i would side more towards the newer model if they ever released them	negative
what an amazing old set i loved pirates in my childhood but that was before the islander and spanish stuff mine were the bsb and soldier fortress with the big baseplate as im now returning to pirates ive tracked down most of the 2009 sets and of course bought the new 2015 sets but knowing i missed this middle period of islanders vs pirates makes me a bit sad those islanders are soooo monkey island those of my age likely feel the same to my eyes oh for a lemonhead minfig  im curious now how much this set sells for given it was apparently one of very few lego actually rereleased i recently bought a misb bsb that was an early 2000s rerelease and it was very pricey but then i suspect the bsb has a lot more of a nostalgic following these days than this set can anyone give me a rough idea what this set goes for in asnew condition these days regardless a fantastic review with some great photos of the whole set and minifigs even though this is an old thread i am glad someone else bumped it recently so i can add my thoughts too  one thing ive noticed comparing the newest pirates sets to the 80s ones i had as a kid and these from the 90s is the move away from baseplates and big panel pieces i actually like that in a lot of ways whilst i miss baseplates being included as they are a great starting point for creating new things and make the sets easier to play with visually i think legodesigned model sets look better without them	positive

sorry to bump such an old thread but i´ve just discovered this set is on sale at amazonde  for a mere 25 euros i am tempted not because i like the set or the models but because of the parts as most of you might know i´m especially into exoforce so would you recommend to get this set just for the parts are they a good choice to combine with efsets would anyone of you be interested in obtaining the fleshieparts of the minifigs from me as i totally don´t need those	neutral
i picked up this set a few weeks ago along with the smaller sets that come with the mach 5 and racer xs car and i was pleasantly surprised the commentators stand is nothing to write home about but the assortment of figs is great numerous new face prints in flesh i believe and in spite of the large amount of stickers the three cars are each unique and very welldesigned my only gripe about them is that cannonball taylors car the black and yellow one was a missed opportunity as in the movie its yellow and purple i know tlc is dropping purple for the future and had a bunch of problems with it in the past but it would have made for a great looking car imo	positive
well thanks for your posting but i couldn´t care less about fleshie minifigs or movieaccurate cars  or the cars at all this set would really only go into my parts bin therefore i need to know what parts are in there and if they are cool enough to go into an exoforce collectors parts bin	neutral

hi ive promised a lot lately ill review 8868 8880 space police ii blacktron ii and i will its just the time that is blocking me and my university and the fact that i just picked up 8460 in original box for only eur 3650 sweet the other reviews will follow  please bear with me and this set review is also a gift to this nice fellow who gave me the title thats what im talking about 1 useless information with high numbers this set contains 841 parts and was released in 1995 in the technic  tech build  advanced sub theme the bricklink price guide displays for “used” a qty avg price of 12585 and for “new” a qty avg price of 21282 i got it for 5698 still can’t believe it  this set was rereleased two times 8431 in 2002 and 8438 in 2003 2 the box front back open the box is higher than other technic boxes why i don’t know 8460 doesn’t have any real large parts whatever inlay i wonder why tlg doesn’t make inlays anymore… they’re noisy and brake easily but are great for pre sorting 3 building instructions i will quote myself from the 8862 review quote wow these instructions are used im not used to this after all this sets with unread instruction booklets triplewow ‘nuff said this is the “first” page fortunately peeron offers scans the last step for the alternate model and a few nice photos showing how the pneumatic pump will be erm pumped yeah random page i forgot the overall thoughts to the instructions these are technic instructions as we’re used to them part count easy to understand okay the string part at the end was too much for me and the color distinction is okay too 100 pages long and if i can trust my eyes the pneumatics page can be fold out i don’t have this page but i assume it 4 the parts 5 building an easy and fun build okay this could take some time my longest building review up to date the front steering the rear steering the axle pin between the rear steering is for the axle which rotates the crane the two worm screws in the front are for the outriggers they’re not linked one for each side the small wheel in the back is for the rotation adjusting front and rear steering outriggers are finished you can notice a 8 tooth gear that will rotate the technic turntable a steering wheel has been added could be the same stickers like the alternate 8880 used to have the steering can be operated with both actinic lights  no we’re far from finished i’ve got a lot of parts left at this point wow a 4x4 corner plate pneumatics and a winch if you can’t recognize it on the photo the technic beams are the erm wrongother side up the 1x6 technic beams on the left side are normal the axle that will extend the crane 7 gear racks 1x4 the 1x6 technic plate will keep the two pneumatic cylinders straight sad 8 huh did you blink you missed a special part the whole rotatable thing will be attached to the technic turntable using two long technic pins the pin on the right side should be in the middle of the three “turntable holes” on the right side it’s the first hole asymmetric why because we’ll add a cute cab 6 functionality you can find the features in comparison to other technic cranes here technopedia of course i made one sentence out of it please don’t find any mistakes p “two axle rack and pinion steering pneumatic luffing and gear driven telescoping via crank for the boom which can slew 360° on turntable driven via gear crank driven hoist and gear driven outriggers at four corners which snap over center” 7 random shots comparison to 8854 uuuh… once again a depth of field i tried to make it look authoritarian like 8858 but i failed somehow 8460 looks cute 8 comparison to 8421 mobile crane  crane truck i feel that a question concerning this will be asked so i deal with it right now first of all i don’t own 8421 yet i know a technic freak really should own it anyway 8421 has more than twice as much parts as 8460 is motorized features a v6engine and a very neat mechanism to extend the craneboom twice using a braided string with end studs try to find out how of course 8421 features far more than 8460 imho 8421 should have been a copy of 8460 a set so successful that it has been rereleased two times but the designers overshoot the mark 8421 is a breathtaking monster compared to it 8460 looks cute  not pale 9 final thoughts i got it on ebay in kind of good condition for about 50 dollars i know that it has been worth the money in any point of view wub i didn’t use the word “oldschool” for now i’ll change that 8460 belongs to the favored few of oldschool technic sets thanks for reading and viewing the pictures i hope you enjoyed it please comment if you want to	positive
im in the same situation as you i have this set but missed out on the newer 8421 this was a great set for its time but the 8421 definitely looks better to me ive been trying to find a good deal on it on ebay but its pretty expensive considering that it only went out of production last year quote inlay i wonder why tlg doesn’t make inlays anymore… they’re noisy and brake easily but are great for pre sorting the box designs in general are crappier these days than they used to be 10 years ago you dont see the old featured parts trays anymore and the boxes dont have the different sections either these also acted as internal supports for larger boxes so they were less prone to being crushed the cardboard material is also quite a bit thinner i think its a result of tlcs overall costcutting moves since then most people toss the boxes and probably dont care but i keep all of them there was actually a time when the boxes used to be even stronger i have an old 8859 set and the outer box is made of a hard styrofoam material although they probably stopped using that for environmental reasons edited by cp5670 06 april 2008  1013 pm	neutral
a great review thank you i do not know these old sets like this one but it is very cool to see how they were made i have an unopened 8421 maybe i should do a small review of that when i get to build it btw boxes are expensive so at a given price point its a choise between more bricks or nicer boxes i have no doubt what most people would chose front edited by front 06 april 2008  1021 pm	positive

simonwillems on apr 7 2008 1201 am said somehow i competely missed your review when you first made it i saw your pics on brickshelf and wondered about the review you have managed to review my all time favourite technic set yeah somehow i wonderd why only vbbn thanks responded but i learned from yodas sig patience  for a jedi it is time to eat as well  eat eat  hot  good food  d simonwillems said it was the first large technic set i was given by my parents when it first came out in 1995 i played for hours with this set making minifig seats in it it was so huge there was room for four minifigs to sit next to eachother in front i made various applications for it a bungeejump system with a large rubber band and lots of containers to be lifted the first changes i made included the inverting of the wheels and the disabling of one of the flashlightsteering wheels because they obstructed eachother by the way the nob for your winch is yellow instead of black i know this set by heart so watch out p  i always liked those nobs and people think you cant play  moc with technic at all xd about the nob erm yeah i only found 3 black ones in the box and so i took the yellow one that i got as an extra with 8829 simonwillems said the alternate model was great fun too the pump is cleverly hidden and the crane folds up great between the cab and the loading platform you could easily mod it with a pneumatic claw on the crane a motor to turn it and a compressor the only flaw was the loading platform which had no floor only some axles another reason for the 8460 as favorite set its got a real alternate model not just a different erm crane simonwillems said thanks so much for reviving my memorie concerning this great set youre welcome i consider this as my job  cp5670 said but i keep all of them there was actually a time when the boxes used to be even stronger i have an old 8859 set and the outer box is made of a hard styrofoam material although they probably stopped using that for environmental reasons thats the spirit i got more than hundred boxes and my 8848 box came with styrofoam too	positive
thanks for the review sweet for its size and parts count this is a remarkably featured set i dont think ive never seen the alternate model before personally i prefer 8421 because i think it looks much better and i love the six wheel steering i also love the three segment boom and the transmission they fit it all in so neatly i realise that it has trouble even holding up itself but ultimately it doesnt matter as its not like you are really going to construction work with it what bothers me more about 8421 is the design change in the boom from chainlinks to strings i would try to mod mine but all i have is the prototype picture to base it on and i dont have enough links anyway p bernddasbrot on apr 7 2008 0729 am said yeah somehow i wonderd why only vbbn thanks responded indeed i have been very busy the last few months and i kept meaning to reply at last i managed to find the time to reply today bernddasbrot on apr 7 2008 0729 am said another reason for the 8460 as favorite set its got a real alternate model not just a different erm crane yes that really sucks somebody i havent got the time to look  on brickshelf has made a quite good alternate lego have been a bit inconsistant with alternate models lately the recent tow truck had a good one i even made both	positive
great review while i admit i wasnt into technic at the time this came out i was a mere child give me a break d i can see now why it was featured so much from the booklets to display stands at toy stores and at my local lego center when it was still around this thing was everywhere with your review i can now truly appreciate all the details of the set i got to admit i can see the appeal now that comparison shot you took is amazing i love not only just how it included the little details such as the stabilizers but also looks incredibly fun to play around with great set and an even greater review	positive
funny review just a question though did your set come with three cutlasses also your food crate seems to be missing edited by sir dano 15 april 2008  0904 pm	neutral
actually they are ants spiders have 8 legs while ants have only 6 like these the two thing that look like legs in the front are the antennae back on topic i think this set looks great and i cant wait until i can get my hands on it and the other new ij sets edited by erdbeereis1 15 april 2008  0926 pm	positive
the rancor on apr 15 2008 1011 pm said im pretty sure those ants are actually spiders i thought they were spiders before but when i saw them mentioned as ants i realised that they are definately ants being a big ant fan i recognise that they are not spiders  they look like ants too and they could be lifesize to some larger species yay ants and new hairpieces and accessories	positive
thanks for this review alex54 this looks like a great set i love the new hair molds and faces plus al those extra pieces are fantastic batbrick away	positive
cant wait to get this one ants i dont have a tent either so thatll be a great pickup im surprised though that it includes the gold exoforce sword i didnt expect this to come in any other sets besides the tower faramir	positive

id buy a bunch of these just for the ants to make an ant farm i also like the bowl cut	positive
front on apr 16 2008 1015 am said they must be ants but im pretty convinced that what you think are the antennae are the ants mandibles or not there are six legs 2 antennae and 2 mandible and they most definately are ants to those still in doubt thanks for this great review alex this is most definately well in my opinion anyway the best set lets face it in motorcycle chase you really only got 2 bikes and 2 crates as the big parts of the set in this one which is the same price you get those ants a neat tent hurray a bprintedi map a chicken leg a castle sword ef sword and pirates sword a dagger now in light bley and a silver frying pan this set is packed with useful pieces im definately getting this one and i for one love mutts hair piece i sense my sigfig will soon have a new hair style thanks again alex for the sweet review peace edited by iamded 16 april 2008  0507 am	positive

i was already thinking of buying this set and youve totally convinced me thanks for the review alex btw i think they are ants having that shape moreover we already have spider molds and they have already been used in theatre themes see spiderman  luxorv	positive
ok i think its a nobrainer that this is a musthave for pretty much anyone who likes lego its cheap and a great minifigs  parts pack ill be getting at least 1 of these here is what i like about it 1 great minifigs with nice torsos sweet faces and awesome hair gotta ask em where they get it done  2 golden katana 3 chicken leg yum 4 nice campfire and this is what i dont like about it 1 dark bley knife seriously they could have at least made it silver like the sword if not chrome 2 rehashed tent 3 spiders with 6 legs i actually dont really care about the tent and the multilegged creatures those go straight into the sorting boxes perhaps i might use the tent someday for a steampunk moc of some kind or a stopmotion film or maybe some kind of contest anyway whats up with that thing that holds the katana the sword and the saber its in the airplane set too is it perhaps one of the treasures of the new movie or is it something indy takes with him everywhere in this film 44however nice pics nice review thanks dude edited by oky wan kenobi 16 april 2008  0938 am	positive

i simply that tent i guess i´ll have to buy three of these just to make a proper expedition moc somewhen a great little set indeed with marvelous new mf torsos and that new black feminine hairpiece´s also great and very useable for creating some characters related to the sixties and seventies and finally a pan that´s not black and a knife in grey that´s very handy indeed the chrome one always looked a bit too shiny to me thanks for that sweet review alex	positive
set ref 7625 name river chase number of minifigs 4 number of pieces unknown price 2290€ a general view of the set we’ve got an amphibious vehicle a small boat an observation post and a dark green croco so beautiful  for the figs we’ve got indy of course marion and two russian soldiers nothing special here in the back of the tree there is a box to put some things the amphibious vehicle is very nice the proportions are really great not too big not too small and there are a lot of details everywhere like the propeller a back view an inside view the small boat is a dark grey zodiac but the details are nice too giving it a retro look in the same way of all the indy vehicles the outpost has a net to permit to the bad guys to capture some nice guys and girls… but it seems that the girl marion is scared of the nice croco so indy comes and help her pushing the technic axle with this round inversed tiles which push out the net and capture the croco now marion feels happier and she takes a can of oil and whacks the poor croco without defences who has said marion is a nice girl so i’ve bought this set like an add on to my city in fact the elements of this set can easily be integrated in a town layout i plan to use the outpost for my forest section and the amphibious vehicle is always a nice touch of originality in a layout yes you can use all those military things without creating an army in a layout just put the violent parts out and you’ve got nice things like a biologist car in the case of the amphibious vehicle	positive
great set ill definitely get it is there any sign of flesh on the soldiers like at the collars	positive
is that a laptop its on does it come with the set seriously though it looks liek it has some good pieces particularily the soldiers clothing and the crocodile hehe hooray for new indy sets lets hope the film is as good it will be	positive

great review alex after seeing these pics im really looking forward to getting this set i really like how lego has designed the gas tank thats just so good finally a different shade of green for the croc its about time and more than welcome the vehicle looks good and a fun build though im not that fond of that commie tree	positive
darthperson8 on apr 15 2008 0712 pm said what are those bricks with the guns attached supposed to be great review and set btw some people have obliquely mentioned this in their responses to the setreview but to specifically answer your question its supposed to be a jerrycan aka a gasoline petrol container	neutral
a very fine review of a really great set thanks alex this set has everything a croc very nice mfs a neat tree trap a cool zodiac and a marvelous and very detailed amphibious car in a beautiful color scheme the only thing i´m not colpletely sure is the design of that jerrycan thanks for the right word and the interesting link kingboy  although the use of the revolver´s pretty clever indeed and fits well too it´s still clearly well a revolver very unusual and interesting for an official tlc design	positive
just like 7626 this is a must buy in my opinion i just the amphibious vehiclevery nice for army building	positive
this set looks good about the jerry cans i like how they give me more pistols this may be the only indy set i get from this batch ill just have to deal with the fleshie heads exchange them for yellow like stealth hunter said this will be good for army building silent help	positive
set ref 7626 name jungle cutter number of minifigs 4 number of pieces unknown price 3999€ a general view of the set we’ve got 5 giant ants two russian soldiers a general indy of course 3 trees a small entrance of a cave and the debroussaillor vehicle i don’t know the english name of it… you can’t enter into the cave because there is a spider web with its spider…unless… unless you know how the mechanism works and the spider web go up… and reveals a case with diamonds and accessories a closer view on the mechanism which is simple but works well and you can also see the difference or maybe the same size of a spider and a giant ant and i’ve always thought that those spiders were very big compared to the minifigs so those ants are really giant poor small frog the three trees with the entrance make a nice jungle layout don’t speak too loud you will wake up the soldier… don’t worry for him he will be waken up by the vehicle before being eaten by those giant ants a front view making the vehicle really menacing a back view push the red part from the back and there are two parts that fall down from the vehicle i don’t know why… the movie will clarify this i think… and here you can see how the two big circular blades turn when you push the vehicle… simple but effective run indy run this set is really nice the playability of the different elements is great the colour scheme is nice too i like those dark green tree parts the vehicle is really impressive without being too big and its very well details in general the designers of the indy sets have made a really nice works with a lot of efforts in all those details everywhere i’ve got some project for this set to integrate it in my city i’m a city mocer and not an indy fan so i don’t have bought the temple the bigger set of the series because it has nothing special for me in term of part selections or in the design in relation with the town theme and because my supermarket doesn’t have it yet so we are waiting for a member to review it and make the part 4…	positive
i like the creatures in this very much and it is good to see the vehicle from different angles thank you i think i shall buy this	positive

great review thanks a lot for all the pics i agree that this is probably the nicest set of the indy 4 wave so much dark green and i love all the plant pieces its been ages since weve had enough pieces in a regular release to build nice forests so its great to see 11 of the dark green leaves in one set and all the vines the design of the cutter looks very solid and brick built as well giant ants are great looking too	positive
a great detailed review for an excellent set i love the jungle cutter vehicle itself and all the dark green its great to have the trees and cave entrance you can never have enough extras the figs are nice too two russian soldiers the coollooking general i think his name is dovchenko or something and the repeatedbutstillnice indy with rpg thanks again looks like ill be picking this up along with jungle duel by the way i think this set is called jungle cutter	positive

thanks for the review alex i agree that this is the best set of kotcs sets although the airplane comes quite close although im not too fond of the trees the cave is good and the jungle cutter is brilliant plenty of great features and very detailed with much of the engine showing and a decent cockpit if thats the right word the general and the two soviets are great too could we have a closeup pic of them please  good to see that neither torso has exposed fleshy skin like the nazis as said though it is quite a pricy set i was expecting it to be just over the price of race for the stolen treasure great set thanks again alex	positive

this is the 3rd review that i had read its very tempting to fly over and get those sets from there because i may need to wait for some months before it arrived it seemed we will have a new small little creature to add into the ranks these red ants is cute and of course looks nasty too haha i love those trees foilage and plants very very much it can be used for my moc and is good for any green project related expansion i love it about the vehicle i find it abit wierd it seemed too big in the setup hehe but still i love this set mainly i will get it for the green parts	positive
heres a review of the second largest set in the dragon masters subtheme for castle month dark dragons den figs the set comes with 3 dragon knights two of which have the dragon wings on their helmetssad thing is one of my knights was missing the left wing on the helmet there are also the definitive dragon wiz the wizard or majisto if you prefertwo horses and a hawk try to find him in each picture the set theres a large spot under the mountain for the dragon to guard the treasure chest the chest has 2 red and green 1x1 circles in it another gate in the back along with a door for knights the right side of the mountain has a ladder and a removable rock face the left side has some stairs leading up to the top i love this tree design simple yet effective a shot of the top hey what are you doing no throw him in the dungeon overall this set when first released in 1993 was priced at 43usd although that might just be because of the juniorised pieces 6 burps its a fun set that provides excellent playability if you can find it at a 2030 price point pick it up overall grade 810 edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0133 pm	positive

ah the wonderful dragon knight or was it dragon masters sets i personally preferred the black knights but these guys still had some awesome sets thanks for this review this looks like a neat little set although those modern stairs look a little out of place that tree design is indeed a neat one i remember having that in one dark forestmen set i got the interior sure is roomy may i suggest for future review you photograph the set on a cleared table that way you wont get distracted by the clutter in the background and can focus on the main part of the image the set peace	neutral
this is probably one of my favourite sets andor one of the sets which i wish i ownedthe 90s was probably my favourite castle era tobad i was to young to buy this set when it came out man i wish i had one of those dragons they were one of the best type i reckon although all the dragons are good thanks for the reveiw edited by hollisbrick 16 april 2008  0741 am	positive
yay go dragon masters i have to agree with iamded i do like the black knights sets better for their design  betrayal  however the dragon knights are just awesome cause they have dragons this is a nice set with some awesome minifigs and a nice overall design i wish i had it go masters	positive
this was the last castle set i got before my dark age really liked it although the big rock parts looked really bad  i am kind of used to them now unfortunately i lost the little wand and i never understood who is good and who is bad does the wizard own the dragon well they dont seem to be enemies but isnt the dragon supposed to be evil	positive
the wizard somehow controls the dragons i think like for example the wizard of the new castle line does with the undead skeletons but i think it isnt sure that the dragon masters wizard is evil as it is still unclear which factions of the older castle series are good or bad	neutral

i own this set and i think its a great for a smaller fortress building there is a good selection of mini figs the burps do detract somewhat from the set but they do make it feel as if its in a large cave the cloth flags that are included are really nice and mine have lasted a long time	positive
the 8291 dirt bike comes from a long line of technic bikes and i think its the best ever it looks great and its fun to ride around in the house i hoped to find a figure the right size for it but none of mine would fit unlike a lot of technic models it looks good from all angles considering the size of the model it has a complicated way of connecting the engine to the wheel the rear shocks are just the right stiffness and they have a good amount of travel i thought these shocks were new i need to get out more functions shocks two front one stiffer one in the rear drivetrain 2 piston engine linked to the rear wheel via gears and a chainlink steering yes it does stand retractable for the price size and subject what else could be added 1010 parts considering that it has three shocks and a 40 chainlinks its a great set for parts some hard to use large parts are included but they are not overused the usage of the green does limit part usage somewhat though and ill be struggling to find a use for those wheels for anything other than a motorbike 810 price at 3999 aud for 248 parts it isnt the best value set the us price is 2500 which is somewhat better it does have some more complicated parts however 710 looks lego seems to be moving away from the seethough look for technic sets and this is a good example of it im not a big fan of fairings but i think they work great in this set as a fuel tank 810 fudge this set was great for me as i have never had a technic bike however for those that want this for just parts or have other bikes it could be a hard sell the alternate model a chopper is a complete rebuild which i didnt make and its great that lego have been including these most of the time lately 710 overall recommended 810	positive
i saw this set at my tru for only 2000 now i might go get it thanks sinner for another nice review quote hoped to find a figure the right size for it but none of mine would fit well just sit your booty down and ride it wourself  okay well maybe if you have a bionicle lying around or a halo figure	neutral
a very good review thanks sinner that´s really a pretty cool model very detailed with useful parts too hmm perhaps that one´s gonna get the first technic set i´ll buy beside that 4481 hailfire droid um thank you sinner	positive
thanks for the great review sinner i like the technic bikes i wonder how it would look if you replaced the gear on the back wheel with a smaller one	neutral
best review of a lime green technic dirt bike ever really it is i just dont understand the allure of the bike very much where does the fabuland fig go anyway very insightful review thanks for taking the time and effort to review it for us im not really interested in the set but wanted to support my buddy since i know how much work you put into these now i shall go read the cherry picker one i look forward to it because theres a walrus in it lasse d on apr 22 2008 0455 pm said it must be cold in that room nice shirt but the vertical hold is broken	neutral
hinckley on apr 23 2008 0110 am said it must be cold in that room nice shirt but the vertical hold is broken its a meeting room in billund  the temperature is usually fine there according to my memory i must say thats a nice collection of motocross bikes the employe is displaying building technic is such a specialist dicipline i think it takes a lot of patience to finalize the design of a model even such a relative simpel one as this cute bike front	neutral
sinner on apr 23 2008 1037 am said ill try to take a photo this weekend well i took the photo but didnt get around to posting it here it is with a smaller gear i think it looks better the problem is that its too tight and it doesnt rotate as freely anymore adding another link makes it too loose thus the set is probably the way it is as its the gear that fit best	neutral
how did i manage to miss this review i must have overlooked it somehow thanks for making this one sinner its always nice to see reviews of technic sets im not so sure whether i like this set i am not that much into motorbikes but lego did a good job on this one it looks a lot like an upgraded version of one of the first bikes lego made namely the 8838 shock cycle i also believe the back gearwheel is somewhat oversized it looks better with the smaller one you attached it is good to see that lego is back to making the technic sets the way they were except for the green that is 	neutral

i wasnt very interested in this set at first it seemed to be just a nice looking truck with a small motor but when i found out it had a transmission i changed my mind here is the transmission it allows the single motor to be used for two functions this system has been around for a while and lego seem to be using it more and more the transmission driving ring alone the red circle goes for 515 usd on bricklink and you also need the catch and clutch gear so i have been buying sets that have them instead i now have enough parts to make a supercar gearbox i bet a new supercar comes out next year now this is the gear that rotates the arm note the colour of the 24 tooth gear it seems to be a new gear trend a lot of work has been put into this truck looking real personally i think they went too far as the truck seems to have been designed for a tilting cab but its disabled to prevent breaking the front bottom of the transmission the bottom shaft lifts the arm note that there are more dark grey gears the motor fits in very well also the bottom of the arm i was surprised by the usage of a 12 tooth bevel to link with the 36 tooth double bevel as i had never seen that done before as you can see there is no room for any drive train standard steering for a recent technic truck there is a handofgod at the cab top that links via two knob wheels it looks good from the back you can also see the white clutch that connects the transmission to the motor to avoid burnouts it goes decently high and can go a bit higher if you use the crane arm compared to last years fire truck if i didnt buy the fire truck for half price i would have been annoyed that lego brought out what is almost a motorised version of the same set functions cherry picker arm motorised rotate and lift that links to a motor via a transmission and antiburnout clutch steering rack and pinion controlled via a handofgod linked by knob wheels doors open and close good functionality that works well but i wish they made the cab lift and im a bit sick of the lame fairing door trick 710 parts motor battery box transmission clutch practical wheels only two fairings compact turntable this is a great parts set 1010 price at 9999 aud for 726 parts its ok value when you consider what you are getting the us price is 6000 which is better but still not great i bought mine for 80 aud which was good however and i suspect that the price is designed for easy sale810 looks id buy this for the looks alone 910 fudge the functions work well and i llked it more than i thought i would oddly mine seemed to be missing a axle pin with friction but since it includes extra parts for the alternate model i didnt mind using one of my spares on the subject of the alternate model it is a dump truck which is made out to be a total rebuild but it isnt it could have easily been done like super street sensation was but lego have probably determined that instructions like that confuse people 810 overall recommended 810	positive
thank you for that fine review of a pretty cool and nice set with a very good amount of functionality and um playability for sure	positive
great review sinner i bought this set a few weeks ago personally i prefer the alternative model of the flatbed truck	negative
wow its a smarty set with drive shafts we are everybody and technical junk the specs and stuff kind of lose me but the walrus looks really cute in the cherry picker i imagine hes saving a kitten but really this is a great review and has a wealth of detail and knowlege for techniphiles thanks for providing such a cool resource for eb i really did enjoy delving in to the world of technic for a few moments the walrus rides it  oh hes so smart	neutral
thanks for reading my review guys vbbn on apr 20 2008 1058 pm said great review i never have been interested in this set i am saving my money for a grey technic set or thatt technic ferrari set if you mean 8145 ferrari 599 gtb then i recomend it but i think it is overpriced mine was almost half price and about to fall in the sorting bin holodoc on apr 21 2008 0423 am said i´m not that much into technic building because i´m lacking the inspiration to build something different with all those technic elements so i´ll pass on this one and stay to classic bricks i have enough now to be able to build something and i really should soon or im going to find it hard to justify to my wife buying the other 2008 sets imperialscouts on apr 21 2008 1258 pm said thanks for the review i think i am going to get this set for its many technic pieces i could really use those for a rig im going to build i didnt know you liked technic i look forward to seeing this rig cp5670 on apr 22 2008 0235 am said the overall design is a bit too studless for my liking i think the 8275 bulldozer has a much better balance of studded and studless pieces and the wheels somehow look too small to me i also have something of a backlog at the moment i still need to pick up that bulldozer along with the 8421 mobile crane on ebay id buy the bulldozer or mobile crane over this set as i own both already i bought this i tend to agree with the wheels but i think it doesnt detract from the model hinckley on apr 23 2008 0814 am said wow its a smarty set with drive shafts we are everybody and technical junk the specs and stuff kind of lose me but the walrus looks really cute in the cherry picker i imagine hes saving a kitten thanks for your foray into technic land i tried to fit him in the cab as well but he kept falling over	neutral
imperialscouts on apr 23 2008 1104 am said well its mostly from the mindstorms robotics side honestly if i bought this it would be my first technic set ever another illusion shattered interestingly ive never bought a mindstorms set as i have enough programming to do for work without doing it for fun i have been tempted though	neutral
sveltecorps on apr 30 2008 1044 pm said and what everyones been waiting for the skullies  three of em and a conquistador skellie  very cute note the backs of the crystal head have a plumesized hole  or maybe thats just where they injected the blue brainplastic spooky i love these skulls i wasnt sold from the initial pics but they have a very creepy smile and the head shape is just weird with the large eyes its kind of homer simpsonesque they reminded me more of the movie coneheads but i think your description is more accurate looking forward to the rest of the review	positive
the figs look great the natives and the skeleton conquistador are my favorite figures in the set the set itself is very good the interior sort of reminds me of an older style lego set for some reason it could be just me but it has a classic feel this will a great set to add to my list great review so far anyway i only saw the back of the box edited by general zen 01 may 2008  0217 am	positive
thanks sveltecorps i was really hoping that the conquistador helmet would end up being silver in the final set but i suppose its good to know that the helmet is being porduced again anyway and is the armour the skellie is wearing pearl gold thanks again i look forward to the rest of the review edit the dark tan baseplate is in fact very nice although the fact that you have to put stickers on it is a real downer but i suppose it is good for those who want it plain edited by tinypiesrus 01 may 2008  0219 am	positive
looks great i cantt wait until i can get my hands on this and the other new ij sets this is turning out to be a really good theme im really liking the crystal skulls and i also think the baseplate looks very nice those natives look fantastic in my opinion thanks for the great review edited by erdbeereis1 01 may 2008  0253 am	positive
sveltecorps on may 1 2008 0243 pm said hi tinypiesrus  i love that helmet too if only we had plumes again soon hopefully the armour is pearl silver not gold oh sorry my mistake so is it pearl silver as opposed to metallic silver that sure is an odd little vehicle the engine looks nice enough and the rubber treads are always good to have but other than that it really just looks thrown together thanks again svelte edited by tinypiesrus 01 may 2008  0258 am	negative

sveltecorps on may 1 2008 0244 am said e central turret thing this thing is kind of annoying and doesnt really sit or work well its kind of like a laser beam sending messages to space i guess as the central dome rises the two plates peel away i find it is a little bit tight to work smoothly and the two plates doesnt really sit well together at the top maybe i just need to rebuild it im sure this will also be explained in the movie great review now im really truly convinced that im gonna buy this set my faith was a little wobbly but its benn restored anyway i just wanted to point out that the temples entrance might actually be the turret thing if you watch the teaser there are some very similair stone pillars surrounded by sand there are 4 not 2 though  and when they close up it looks like all our characters are sucked into the sand and magically appear underground going through some stone plateswhich act like steps to go down that dissapear so in theory those steps beneath the turret are actualy the entrance and im asumming from this picture that the steps with 1x8 bricks with the dragon heads at the end lead us of somewhere else all in all this temple looks like a mixed up version of the real temple which is fine by me sidenote im not sure but based on minifig inclusion either lego was cheap or colonel dovchenko is dead by the time irina and her goons reach the temple ill wait till i see the movie  edited by belloq 02 may 2008  0214 am	positive

i know that alex54 had already reviewed this set beforehand but i wanted to give my 2 cents it is really more like 150 on this set i bought from toys r us on friday guess what the price had not been increased by a dollar like all other sets  this is my first review of a set ever dont be too mean 1 box it captures the potential i dont know how the scene plays out for now  action of the scene nicely and is very pleasing good job tlc  on the back it shows some of the play features of the set and a net little comic indiana jones seems to be surprisingly calm considering that he is about to be captured under a net and attacked by a snake the thing he fears most 1a comic not much to say on this 1b screw up at the top of the box both russian guards have the same grining face in the set one has the generic bad guy face from 7620 2 contents the box opens up to reveal a quartet of bags an uncrumpled manual yay and a sticker sheet boo 2a dss yoda said every for of rambling imaginable about this accursed item i have nothing to say meh 3 minifigs the only thing that has not really been discussed about the figs that you get in this set is that marion has a slightly new torso 4 parts of interest when i opened up the baggies these were the components that grabbed my attention a dark green alligator a net piece that i know has appeared in sets before hand  i needed it for a moc i am working on some raft part that is probably very old a ladder with two pairs of hindges and a dark brown version of this part 4 build amphibious vehicle this i one of the more enjoyable builds of the new line but that is just my opinion you start of with some thing very simple by the end of the next page it starts to bulk up more detail beginning to look like a car 4a build rear attachment bulk it up and add taillights done slap it on to the main vehicle 4b build front attachment i am running out of things to say bulk it up add some detail add a gun and headlights and attach to the rest to get the completed vehicle add stickers i honestly think that the amphibious vehicle looks much better with the stickers than without 5 build boat this build goes by rather quickly and adds to the playability of the final set base apply clamps add more to engine build more detail and a gun base finished boat plus stickers i love how lego slips in the product number into their stickers 6 build tree fort this is the weakest part of the whole set but i find my self liking it more and more for some odd and inexplicable reason that tan 6x6 will most likely see use in a pirate themed vinigete soon not mine  install netlauncher you spend the next two pages building this and putting it on a tree branch that is an ugly mix of brown dark brown and frown our commie friend seems to like coffee a lot second branch 3rd a wee bit to much on the coffee there dont you think final step the only redeeming value of this section is how well the net launcher works fantastically the rest is just utter fail 7 spare parts very little in terms of what is left over finished set all in all this set is a fine build and an excellent parts pack for dark green components i recommend this set strongly despite its few weaknesses	positive
i brought this set a few days ago and agree with everything you say i would have never noticed that the boat sticker is the set number unless you pointed it out glad to see that one set of fuel can stickers was extra i spent ages looking for a place to put them cool review btw	neutral

thanks for this review you have reviewed my most favourite town set of all times i am so happy to own this one i actually is a story to go along with it in the summer of 1998 i went on holiday with my parents to the country of luxembourg in the city of wiltz we encountered a small toystore which still had this set for sale 9 years after the release i did not had the sufficient amount of money to buy the set and had to leave it at the store i was practically in tears four years later we passed through luxembourg and i remembered the city and the store we made a detour and stopped by the same store every other old set was sold the only one remaining was this one i bought it immediately and treasured it ever since i use the baseplates a lot in my cities they serve well as roads with parking spaces next to them this was the first set i owned which had the huge 6x24 plates in them i remember my surprise when seeing plates of such enourmous lenght i recently made an entire racetrack together with this set and to promote myself i will place a link here	positive
metalandi thanks for this wonderful lovely review i enjoyed myself very much when i am looking through at the lovely pictures i must admit this is what i called a real classic race prix i miss those cute sweet little race cars which is able to contain a minifig furthermore this set offers 4 race cars and 13 minifigures in addition if town collectors remember the car number tiles are printed instead of using stickers this is the other set i owned which holds the similarity above 6381 motor speedway overall great review simonwillems on may 9 2008 0220 am said i recently made an entire racetrack together with this set and to promote myself i will place a link here i saw your entire racetrack it looks real exciting and i love your layout real nice edited by whitefang 15 may 2008  0956 am	neutral

ahhhh back in the days when shell was the racing fuel of choice before that octan company came to town bought off the old shell execs and ran them out of town on a rail but i digress i always liked the look of the set but at the time could not work out where i would be able to fit it into my town	neutral

i can remember when i saw this set in lego catalogues looking at it dreamin to have it like so many other sets and this one is still a dream i really like the design of this set it looks really complete with some nice details there are no lost place the strairs withe the foot bridge add a lot to it imo looking at the pics ive got a question  is the rescue rig trailer one piece or is it brick build	positive

hello all i dont believe there has been a review of this set yet so i wanted to take this opportunity up for review today is 8160 cruncher block and racer x as part of batbrick and iamded reviews here is the box i have to say i love the art on it its very colourful and makes the truck look a lot less crap than it does on the box plus you have to love the missile launching action bit right am i right why are you all staring at me and here is the back pretty generic but shows some nice details and so forth oh dear in turning around the box have i killed myself and iamded okey dokey up first is the best part of the entire set the minifigs racer x is wonderful though coming with a boring bruce wayne face but it is cruncher block his lady driver taejo that really shine look at those awesome suits the cool faces taejo has a ripped shirt now up is the first building part of the set with me and iamded looking rather slick in xs car while im not a big fan of yellow it is very nice and slopes in an underused colour is better than no slopes at all front view the new windshields are fantastic while a very cool car it is rather silly of tlc to give us the exact same one we got in the smaller set i didnt get the smaller set with this car so im still happy but it is a bad marketing move sorry iamded i know its your birthday butvroom now for the second part of the build and my favourite the front of the truck annoyingly enough this part opens up to shoot a pointless rubber projectile to do this you open the roof a nice detail btw and pull back the mechanism here thus blowing the front part open and launching itwell not far really the wheels and covers are pretty cool and the front is nicely designed the red looks good and the rear vision mirrors are a great touch and now for the most disappointing part  step three the trailer note  clicky joint piece not part of set just used to hold it up thats right almost the entire thing is open even the filled in side has holes id certainly be cared to be back there one bumpy hill and back you go i didnt put the lame computer stickers on and the control area is pretty lame in general not to mention taejo who is depicted on the boxart as standing at the desk would most likely just be sucked out the back at those speeds there are some pluses too though like the ridiculously awesome minifig paintings ill be using for wayne manor also note the control on crunchers desk that when turned turns the gun at the bottom its an alright feature here is an example ive shot iamded on his birthday what its a love ray havent you seen the care bears and though im not a massive fan of stickers this is just too cool the little aquarium is very simple but very clever using a printed piece between two clear windows to create the illusion of a tank it looks much better in real life trust me and here is a side view to better explain now to connect the two is a good thing i like the way a simple technic piece assumes the job oh and behold my hand the completed truck which while a mixed bag still doesnt look too bad i guess now the completed set which despite its unbelievable large flaws still looks cool warning the kickass iamded and batbrick figures do not come with this set more pics here httpwwwbrickshelycgii3147324 all in all minifigs 55  racer x is beautiful cruncher block and the driver too and taejo has a ripped shirt damn design 25  pretty poor considering the best part is available in a cheaper set and only the front part of the truck looks cool but still not truly awful build 35  despite having a bad trailer it was a fun build and sometimes you need something that doesnt take ages to make price 25  overpriced easily but rogue shadow is worse fun 35  the mere concept of such an open truck kept me playing with this baby for hours total 1525 not as bad as it would seem overall im really glad i bought it as the minifigs are fantastic and the paintings and fish tank are cool its fun stupid and downright ridiculous but while not a great set by any means certainly isnt as bad in the brick as it looks in photos until next time batbrick away edited by batbrick 13 june 2008  1220 pm	negative
awesome review batbrick i dont see any appeal at all really in this set but thats okay as i want to stick to castle anyway the car is the best part imo which you can get in a different set with another cool car and for a cheaper price but the main downfall to this set is the fact that the trucks trailer is half blown up and the survivors are magically staying inside and not being sucked right out of there as you have mentioned i would have thought tlc would at least included some sort of cover that you could take on and off easily kind of like the modular buildings having said all that though the front of the truck does look incredibly cool and those minifigs are sweet too bad they all have flesh tone printed on them so while this may not be my set of choice i can see the appeal well really i cant but its just my opinion im sure there are plenty others who would love to scoop this set up peace	negative
ill be passing on this set thanks for the review anyway is everyone supposed to be bald in the film it looks weird	negative
warning this reply may contain several minor movie spoilers if you havent yet seen the movie and want it to be a complete surprise do not read batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said but it is cruncher block his lady driver taejo that really shine look at those awesome suits the cool faces taejo has a ripped shirt i was originally skepitcal about the driver figure—i like the head but i was trying to figure out why they put in a female minifig with no hairpiece after having seen the movie i now understand why crunchers driver is a fairly manly looking woman and most of the lego hairpeices would make the minifig look too girly for the character  now that i know why taejos shirt is ripped up i dont mind the bits of fleshie color that are printed on it but i do wish they would make some of the new torsos a little more headcolour agnostictheres no real reason why cruncher and his driver couldnt have had ties that came all the way up to their necks instead of having those little wedges of flesh showing through loose collars yeah they are lowlevel mafioso type scum but they arent complete slobs batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said front view the new windshields are fantastic they are indeed very nice its the main reason i started looking at the speed racer sets in the first place batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said while a very cool car it is rather silly of tlc to give us the exact same one we got in the smaller set i didnt get the smaller set with this car so im still happy but it is a bad marketing move i think the error they made was in the smaller set though in the movie the only time we see crunchers semi is when hes being chased by racer x racer x and taejo do end up on the same team for a cross country rally race along with speed of course so i guess thats where they were going by putting those two together in the smaller set but it would have been much more interesting for them to have made up a set with taejo and one of the cars from the very goofy comic bookgimmicky teams they are racing against especially since one of the teams that is chasing taejo specifically is a bunch of armywannabee loonies—im sure more people would have loved some sort of darksand green racer with one of the ij soviets at the wheel than another racer x to summarize two racer xs is bad but it is the smaller set that should have been changed imho batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said annoyingly enough this part opens up to shoot a pointless rubber projectile thus blowing the front part open and launching itwell not far really as much as i normally dont like the stupid techic launcher thing and would rather not see it in a set ever again although one of these days i will make a giant multilauncer rig out of them just for fun at least there is a reason for it to be in this set as crunchers semi has a missile launcher in the front end of it in the movie i think youre supposed to lift the panel that hides the missile before launching it similar to the way that panels slide out of the way on the semi cab to allow for firing in the movie batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said and now for the most disappointing part  step three the trailer thats right almost the entire thing is open even the filled in side has holes id certainly be cared to be back there one bumpy hill and back you go im gonna chock this up to the standard lego philosophy of playset rather than model design for a lot of things the semi rig and raver xs car are the models the trailer is the playset seeing as how the trailer is crunchers mobile office rather finely appointed with lots of paintings and his pirahna babies in their tank behind his desk and the intent seems more or less to have a playest bit in order for kids to reenact the scene from the movie im not going to give them too much grief over this they tried to capture the basic bits of the movie set which we see mostly from the inside during the movie and translate it into a playset type environment that being said i do wish the back walls were more solid as i see no reason for there to be gaps in the back wall when the front wall or the fourth wall as the case may be here is already conspicously absent batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said there are some pluses too though like the ridiculously awesome minifig paintings ill be using for wayne manor also note the control on crunchers desk that when turned turns the gun at the bottom its an alright feature could have been a little better but its such a minor bit of this scene in the movie that i can see why they didnt spend too much time and effort on it it would have been nice to have more paintings though had the back wall been more complete and i like your idea of how to use them   batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said and though im not a massive fan of stickers this is just too cool the little aquarium is very simple but very clever using a printed piece between two clear windows to create the illusion of a tank definately a feature which is not showcased nearly well enough on the box art since it is one of the major features of this set in the movie its nice to see it translate rather well into brick batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said design 25  pretty poor considering the best part is available in a cheaper set and only the front part of the truck looks cool but still not truly awful that may be a bit harsh but not much given what ive said further up this post but it probably only deserves a 3 at best so im not realy going to quibble the point  i still think that racer x should be exclusive to this set and a different car should be in the smaller set with taejo which would have improved the cachet for this set overall batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said price 25  overpriced easily but rogue shadow is worse truethis should have ideally been about a 30 set especially given the general awesomeness of the ij race for the stolen treasure set unless they made the trailer a bit more detailed better back wall perhaps some drop down gun ports like in the movie or at put least one or more of crunchers goons in the set then maybe i could agree more with the msrp on that note if i remember correctly from my visit to my local tru yesterday in search of the new ij sets since local targets seem determined not to get them in stock yet they had this set on sale for around 35 along with an offer for a coupon good for 750 towards the purchase of a ticket to the movie with any speed racer toy purchase over 25 i may be wrong on the sale price but i know the ticket offer was there so if you havent seen the movie yet and are interested in this set tru may be the place to go right now to get both at a slightly cheaper price batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said fun 45  the mere concept of such an open truck kept me playing with this baby for hours so you did enjoy the playest aspect of the trailer even though you didnt care for the designlooks like they didnt do too badly then on what they wanted out of that bit  batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said overall im really glad i bought it as the minifigs are fantastic and the paintings and fish tank are cool its fun stupid and downright ridiculous but while not a great set by any means certainly isnt as bad in the brick as it looks in photos i was actually thinking about going and getting this set now that ive seen the movie and i understand what the heck is going on here more your review has definately added an additional impetus to that notion my pocketbook does not thank you	neutral
thanks for that fine review batbrick the most interesting part of the set for me are the neat mfs the trailer looks really pretty skeletal however it´s a nice little play set and´ll fit its purpose i guess	neutral
nice review good pictures thanks i think i may get a couple of the smaller sets as i think these will become collectors sets in years too come not sure this range will be that popular love the minifigs though	neutral
batbrick thanks for the sweet review you give me great insights into this set hehe i agreed that racer x is nice but i believe we can get it in the other set for a much lower price for me the trailer which does not have a cover is bugging me alot thats why i holding my reservations against this set at most i will consider the other 2 smaller sets for collection purpose nevertheless batbrick great job	negative
thanks for the review my wife wanted me to buy this for the fishtank and i came close untimately this set didnt offer many good part to me so i bought the smaller set with the same car the trailer is just too insubstantial	negative
thank you for the nice review	neutral
thanks for the great review it seems like the most awesome part of the set is the sticker sheet which is a reversal of the usual situation	positive
i bought this set a few days ago and agree with what you have said about it the trailer is fun to play with but just so plain overall great review	positive
i really like this set my favorite parts are the minifigs and xs car vrooom	positive
i enjoyed the review some cool fleshie heads and parts but it does seem a bit lamer even than i imagined from the box the airy truck is rather slyly disguised on the box art i would like to get it if it is ever on sale 50 off would be nice  speed racer lego doesnt seem to be selling too well in local shops here	neutral
good reviewi think the sets amazing	positive
that is a very nice and quick review thanks for giving us a quick summary not much comments on this set as i do not really go into batman theme yet however the ice cream truck in the set interest me apart from that nothing much yet who knows maybe i will change my mind in the future	neutral
mustget	positive
nice review brickbitz i actually think this kit is really very nice for the size true you only get three figures but it seems thats a norm in most batman sets besides everything else is great the tumbler looks like an amazing build  they really nailed this tank of a ride and the ice cream truck plus this set does seem to have some neat pieces in it trans green popsicles and lime hubcaps anyone i think this far beats the rest of the batman lineup this year which seems quite disapointing overall edited by grevious 16 may 2008  0812 pm	positive

great review as always although i know you dont take many pictures in your reviewsimho  but can we see a little more about the tumbler is that little windshield down near the bottom front a third seat what is in the framework of the back behind the cockpit i know theres a blunt shooter and flick fire missiles but is it all framework	neutral
trooperdavinfelth on may 16 2008 1111 pm said although i know you dont take many pictures in your reviewsimho  but can we see a little more about the tumbler ill get some set up tomorrow in better light to be honest there isnt a lot to see most of it is just basic technic blocks underneath with all the slopes built up on top	neutral
thanks a lot for the review brickbitz i really love this set sure the figs are annoyingly not new but the ice cream truck is fantastic and the tumbler is a marvel of black slopes i see now that it is far too huge though i reckon i will either keep it that way as a mega tumbler mod it to become another battank keep it as a model tumbler or pull it apart and use the bits to make a tumbler like wetwires awesome one love those popsicles though and those wheels are very nice so overall as a loyal batfan i love the set even though it couldve been better batbrick away	positive
nice review i really cant believe that it is out already i love that new batman suit and the tumbler have they made the posicles before this is sure a must have	positive
brickbitz on may 16 2008 1141 pm said ill get some set up tomorrow in better light to be honest there isnt a lot to see most of it is just basic technic blocks underneath with all the slopes built up on top some more pics of the tumbler	neutral
the tumbler is massive ill struggle to fit it into the cave but never mind the figs are nice the tumbler is pretty accurate or at least it will be after ive moded it and jokers tainted ice cream van is so very joker thanks for the review btw	positive
hey brickbitz i love how your review is not biased 10 ups in the end you said overall slightly disappointing most people post reviews only with praise but im glad you take both sides  enjoyed the review just like others have thanks so much	neutral
general grievous reviewed by dunamis set 10186 1085 pieces 8995 from lego shop  home build time 35 hours it is the start of summer here in california and along with the weekly deluge of new action films we start to see some of the next wave of star wars lego sets the latest offering from our favorite building toy company is none other than the infamous general grievous no doubt you all know the story of grievous two parts technic and one part human and his hatred of the jedi follow along as we get a closeup view of the mighty general no doubt the observant will wonder why i purchased this set from shop  home instead of my trusty lego store in glendale well it’s really as simple as two things i’ve been traveling a lot and didn’t have time to drive to the store to get it and gas is now 4gallon and i would likely spend more in gas than the 9 shipping cost to get it to me so there you have it the box a gigantic box much larger than expected held the mighty general we’re back to the perforated tabs on the side and two stickers on the front that let the box lift open inside we have 17 bags two manuals and three stickers on a relatively small sticker sheet the manuals the manuals are not terribly thick in fact the second manual is noticeably thinner than the first they come in at 75 and 31pages interesting to note on the back we see the next and more interesting wave of sets later this summer nothing new to report on the manuals as they provide the lego standard of high quality and features we expect  piece callouts  models divided into sections  large images  page numbers since there were links posted to the pdf files of the instructions online i’m sure you can all get an idea of the manual and the parts inventory however for those of you without access to the internet here are photos of the parts inventory pages random manual image features page the pieces the short answer is you get lots and lots of little pieces in white gray and black plus some big pieces in white gray and black mixed in the set is a fair amount of oddball pieces like minifig tools jedi hood and trans yellow dome fear not despite the eclectic collection of parts it all comes together in the end not unlike a typical day at work for me… it is probably worth noting again that there is a heavy amount of technic parts and pieces here the build the build starts off with a rather indepth build of the stand in which general grievous stands on once you think you are done you keep adding on to this rather solid base i bet there are 250 pieces just in the base alone it is quite nice when you get done with it though and really adds to the display i’m glad lego didn’t skimp on the base as it completes the model once you get through all that the rest of the build is a real thumbbruiser anyone who has built a decent size technic set knows the feeling of your thumbs being sore when you are done you get the same effect here it is actually a fun build and i really liked seeing how the designers used all the various pieces to recreate a fairly accurate model of grievous the model is built from the ground up as seen in a few of the progress shots here is what is left over the design the design is quite good and is very accurate some might be disappointed that since this is a technic set we don’t have more articulation in the shoulders and have the ability to separate two arms into four as seen in the movie however it would seem the real intent is for display and not functionality here is a shot of the torso and the detail involved here are grievous’ organs careful observers will note that my model is lacking two “arrow” stickers from the two white chest pieces i failed to see these on the sticker sheet and only grabbed the large grievous sticker so note that there are actually three stickers and not one chest protector and respirator head and arms i was a little disappointed that we got two yellow blades and no green blades on the lightsabers note how all the lightsabers have different hilts which is a nice touch here are some shots of the completed model with a few other sets shown for scale he is actually pretty tall you have the option to remove the top two arms and put in shoulder plates if you so desire detail on the back overall thoughts i’ve been saying for a few years that we should have a technic grievous set and we finally got one designed more as a model and not a fully functional swooshable figure grievous is a tad flimsy you won’t want him to veer too far off his massive and sturdy base it would have been nice to have is cape with him like the technic vader set i do like the size of the model and it is impressive to look at lego star wars system fans will likely want to think twice before purchasing but technic and ucs fans should be satisfied final rating 75 build 810 very good – fun relatively quick build technic fans will be more pleased than others design 810 very good – some nice snot and technic techniques a bit flimsy but the base is kind of cool parts 710 a mixed bag of stuff probably can’t get too many diverse builds from this except for other robot type models price 710 just ok – a bit stiff at 90 usd for a nice display model with limited functionality as always let’s hear your thoughts and feedback	positive
hey dunamis think you can get a straighton shot of the face the red pieces inside the eye sockets are topped with transgreenishyellow studs which make his face look eerily alive and very close to his screen appearance its a nice little detail that seems to not show through on pictures ive seen of the set the legs are a little wobbly im scared that hell be leaning too far forward in about 5 years	neutral

thanks very much for the review brickbitz i love this years mars mission line and though this is the weakest set it is still a major improvement the mech is very cool and well made and the commander is one of my favourite alien figs ever the alien ship is pretty good better than last years ones but not extremely good either but i still like the set batbrick away	positive
thanks for that interesting review brickbitz the alien fighter looks pretty nice nothing special but streamlined and fast nevertheless that transforming feature´s a nice addition for sure and these new flicker missile with its launch apparatus hmm i hope i won´t spend quite some time in search of that little rocket piece however there´s still something i miss with these alien crafts i don´t know i like some more organic looking design and they even come in some nice and different shapes but still perhaps a real space fighter just needs a solid cockpit cool windscreens and controls to satisfy my odd likings that exo suit looks really good and i wonder why it´s a little underrepresented on the box art the jet packspace scooter´s a really good idea and the only thing i hate´re those darned studless technic beams it could look so much better with a studded version of these parts but of course that´s only due to my personal preferences	positive

hi yall guess what happened today when walked into my toys r us in fullerton ca just to buy a simple tiny turbo racer what do i see all the agents sets sitting on the shelf ready for the taking i didnt have too much money with me so i just got 2 of 8631 mission 1 jetpack pursuit its a really cool little set so i thought id review this puppy for you i shall proceed in the order of the instructions so lets get started the minifigs lets begin with the minifigs saw fist and agent chase they are really cool some of the coolest minifigs i have seen in a while i took off saw fists wig  chainsaw so you can see his head and cybernetic arm better here is a back view of saw fist and  surprise agent chase has a double sided head one side with his cool mission face with sunglasses and headset and one with his casual bruce wayne type face note though that it is not really the bruce wayne face his wig btw is mutts hairpiece in black very neat poor saw fist seems to be forced to always drag his chainsaw around for it is way too long to just hang down from his shoulder like a normal arm the snowmobile next up we have the snowmobile a sleek little vehicle with only minor design flaws the container with the jewel is attached to the vehicle by a single stud so it doesnt fall off but is easy to pick up in the pic below you can see the only two tiny design flaws thanks to the exhaust pipes the laser cannon or whatever its supposed to be cant be lowered any further than this also the corners of that slopeish piece that the handle bar rests on are sticking out a little at the sides other than that its pretty well done the jetpack finally there is the jetpack imo a name like autogyropack or something would make more sense but whatever although a little bulky the jetpack is very well designed the rotor can be tilted back and at the lower back of the jetpack there is hook with which you can grab the container with the jewel from the snowmobile what i like best about the jetpack is that although it is attached to the minifig in kinda the same way as that of the riddler this one doesnt rotate around so the agent is being held in place steadily see ya later chainsawcyborgdude stickers this set comes with a surprisingly large sticker sheet the reason is that half of it are extra stickers there are two large agents logos and one inferno logo  perfect for agents mocs there are also a star and a small round sticker portraying the number of the mission the star seems to be part of some kind of game where you collect the stars from all sets on an agents id that you get from the mission 5 set i dont know though if you get any gain from this except for becoming a fullstatus lego agent below you can find the list of parts from this set click here for a better quality pic thats pretty much it i hope you liked this review and will run straight to your next toy store to get one or more of this set this was my very first set review so any questions comments or requests any more pics you want me to take would you like me to exchange the chainsaw with something else or do you want me to try the agents new hairpiece out on another fig if so just tell me see ya edited by oky wan kenobi 25 june 2009  0821 pm	positive
thanks for the great review oky wan the two vehicles look quite nice for a small set and the minifigs look great the two sided head is nice although it wouldve been nice if it was a new head rather than the standard frowning face the cyborg looks good nice and cartoony i like the printing on his back the belt on the hips should be useful not to mention the robotic hand i assume that anything that fits into a 1x1x1 cylinder can fit in it i hope so thanks again oky any chance you can get any more sets	positive

huhm  i like the idea of the agentid  but offcourse all they want with that is that you buy all six sets  but it can be a good idea for children they wouldnt think of hey they get all money only because i have a little card with stars or something well not to rant i think its good also can you make that name yourself maybe set 5 comes with a extra stickersheed with all letters that would be nice agent rupee a very nice review oky wan kenobi rupee	neutral
oky wan thanks for this wonderful review i really have mixed feelings towards agents set haha but i love the agent minifigure the doublesided face is great and i love the sunglass look its nice that they made use of mutts hairpiece which is personally my fave hairpiece at the moment the jetpack is neat making use of the additional secure backing onto the minifig is really very smart	positive

i love the way the bad guy has a special attachment on the jewel case just to allow the agent to grab it with his hook its like the two of them sat down beforehand and drew up the plans for the vehicle together cyborg ok and then ill make my getaway in the special snowmobile and you can follow me agent and ill scoop up the jewel and return it to foil your plan cyborg perfect see you tuesday dr s	positive
good review thanks oky wan hmm although i really like the villain not just the new arm i think the color is very villanous as all bondvillains with class have minions in uniforms its even possible to fill out their numbers with exoforce grunts of the same color im not that hot for the agent himself his uniform nah it doesnt even look like clothes just give the man a suit or some nifty leather i think ill try to grab some sets from the agents line just for the new parts to begin with mocs may follow who knows when they are available in stores here in sweden havent seen them yet though indiana jones just got here so there might be some further waiting for me now i want to see reviews of the other sets 	negative

thanks for an interesting review theriddler the set´s cheap and very useful to get two fantastic mfs a great mr freeze and a very cool new batman but i have to say that these two small vehicles just look plain ugly imho without any inspiration nor orginality sorry tlc but you can for sure do better than that and even with less pieces	neutral
nice review thanks i really like those little gokart thingies theyve got a fantastic mario kart look to them	positive
quote but i have to say that these two small vehicles just look plain ugly imho without any inspiration nor orginality indead the only reason to get this set is if you couldnt afford the batcave back in 2006 and want a mr freeze fig for a cheap price and anyone who did get that kit really have no reason whatsoever to get this wait did i forget something oh yeah  thanks for the review riddler edited by grevious 22 may 2008  1154 pm	neutral

like many others ill buy this just for mr f quickly recycle the parts and pretend this set never existed the flame detail is indeed terrible the bat is back  and hes flatulent this third batwave isnt really doing anything for me ill get the penguin set as well for pretty much the same reason  although the sub on that is pretty cool  but skip the others maybe batbrick can make us all nice altmocs to improve these sets thanks for the review though	negative

deinonychus on may 23 2008 1012 pm said pics and thoughts tomorrow i picked up this set earlier in the week and was quite pleased with it in fact i have missions 15 and am happy with all of them  this series is much better than the old alpha team ever was i look forward to reading your thoughts on it i will say 2 things about it now though 1my set came with defective instructions in 2 places pages are missing and duplicates of other pages repeated for instance the car instructions are missing steps 1621 fortunately i was able to make out what pieces went where in the missing steps by studying the illustration in step 22 i hope you have better luck with your instructions 2this set contains the best lego sound brick ever its just begging to be incorporated into my arkham asylum	positive
yay cant wait for your review i plan to get this and the giant truck the brick rat on may 23 2008 0731 pm said 2this set contains the best lego sound brick ever its just begging to be incorporated into my arkham asylum what is a sound brick	neutral
mr mandalorian on may 24 2008 1158 am said what is a sound brick ditto maybe its like the exoforce lightup brick only with sound instead of light that would kick innapropriate word deleted	neutral
the brick rat on may 23 2008 1031 pm said 1my set came with defective instructions in 2 places pages are missing and duplicates of other pages repeated for instance the car instructions are missing steps 1621 fortunately i was able to make out what pieces went where in the missing steps by studying the illustration in step 22 i hope you have better luck with your instructions everything was just fine with my directions sounds like you just ran into some bad luck there my friend quote 2this set contains the best lego sound brick ever its just begging to be incorporated into my arkham asylum i agree 100 and i didnt even see it had a sound brick until i read this last night usually lego promotes stuff like that pretty loudly on the packaging not here though	neutral
wow thanks deino for this great review i cant wait to get this myself but right now i gotta save for the cw sets the car is with no doubt one of the most mind blowing things tlg has come up with and we can only hope that there will be more models made out of almost only metalic colors the spider cyborg while not as innovative as some of the other cyborgs is a very nice fig and his head will be very usefull for splinter cell mocs and those intake pieces are only relatively new btw they are in almost all of the current 10 racers sets any chance of you taking a pic of a lineup of all the silver parts in this set edited by oky wan kenobi 24 may 2008  1132 pm	positive
wow thanks for the great review deino this set is really a must have for me the sound brick seems great the helicopter looks very nice and the car is superb all of the james bond features are really cool though im very interested in how the ejector seat works or doesnt work the car itself is very sleek and full of beautiful silver and the inclusion of the new rims and windshield mean that i wont have to buy many speed racer sets as for the minifigs they all look great especially spyclops though it looks rather easy for him to fall off of his spider legs can you confirm this a great review of a great set thanks deinonychus	positive
deinonychus on may 23 2008 0912 pm said the rear has two cones sticking out id like to think theyre smoke nozzles or oilslick sprayers according to page 14 of my brickmaster magazine the left cone is for smoke screen and the right cone is for oil slick	neutral
wow great review thanks this set looks absolutely great but im afraid of the price oh weel ill just get the 2 smaller ones im really liking this theme well done tlg	positive
esjpg 4794k 110 downloads the ejector seat a long technic axle runs the length of the front of the car it comes in to the seat area here and nests into the gray joint which is attached to the small gray technic beam the beam is attached to the ejector seat bottom white 3x2 plate with a technic pin the seat in turn is attached to the side of the car with a technic pin the result is when the axle is pushed forward the gray joint and beam tilt the seat and eject a minifig after about 20 shots the minifig only went outside of the car 3 timesthe rest of the time he just bounced around the inside of the car so they get an a for effort but an f for execution	neutral
thanks deinonychus for another great review i must say i do look forward to people uploading reviews of new sets it really helps me decide if i want it or not if its a good set imo then it adds to the excitement of picking up one myself this i must say is one of those sets the only concern for me like alot of others is the price i will just have to wait and see and continue to look at these photos deinonychus has provided for us so much for thinking the agent line was going to be weak i wonder if the exoforce style code brick number plate is a hint from tlc as to what will replace exoforce at the end of this year jb	positive
thanks for the great review im really liking these agents sets the more i see them the car seems to have alot of features its to bad the the ejection seat doesnt work as well as one would hope oh well makes me want the big rig even more now	positive
looking closely at the red cones on the missles and grey cones on the cars rear these appear to be a new piece note how there is a slight stopper ridge at the base of their top stud interestingly the trans green cones on the helicopter seem to be of the older mould style	neutral
great review deinonychus i really like it can someone record the sound os the sound brickmaybe on youtube i really want to hear it this sets are really cool deino can you post a picture of the agent card it comes with	positive
great review and fantastic pics deinonychus and a big thank you to whoever pointed out that you could use the sound brick for arkham asylum my addled brain didnt make the connection the car is just beautiful and with a good use for the most expensive part of the gate this is on my wish list for sure just have to see how much cash is left over after buying the new death star in a month or two agents has to be the biggest surprise from lego for ages without any pics it sounded soso but theyve done a brilliant job with it love those metallic coloured pieces	positive
great w im totaly gonna buy this set	positive
great review thanks for sharing	positive
hello all eurobricks members i will present to you a very short review on the recent castle battlepacks this time i will be reviewing skeleton battlepack and i hope everyone of you do enjoy viewing it this was a request that put up by hollisbrick in the castle thread initally i thought it was a very simple set to do a review however for the love of castle i decided to whip this up for every castle fan out there this is an image of how the skeleton battlepacks look like i have bought 12 last packs of these in total so far but none of the crown battlepacks yet there were snapped much faster that i imagined do pardon me for the poor lightning today is a bad weather its hard to get natural light the skeleton gang for a single battlepack like this with an attractive reasonable price you obtained a series of 5 skeleton minifigs with tons and tons of useful castle accessories to me its a very very great buy and its a must to stock up for my army building some addons however i was not very satisfied with my skeleton armies standards therefore i decided to make some slight modifications with some additional castle accessories that is stocked in my castle warehouse after the makeover ok this is what i called a real skeleton army this is mainly my opnion and it have to be aligned with my standards i felt this improved battlepack gives a punch to the exisitng battlepack the two soliders on the right is able to align with the rest of my castle chess sets armies while the one on the left it gives me a great archer back up with the quiver and helmet attached to him the ones on the center especially the armored guard which equipped with the black nose cone helmet is my fave it is able to illustrate the elite among the rest of the guards with its armor and helmet which was featured in my castle deep forest expansion moc promotion on in addition the one which was hastly done with a modify mace it looks rather simple in time to come i will change it and gives a better equipment and look these are the remains i can use the axe for my dwarf in my dwarf mine defender in that set there is no weapon for my dwarf and i have to get it from other sets the rest of the accessories makes a very good stock up for future upgrading overall 910 this is not a playset it is mainly bought for its abilty to mass recurit any armies and is a main love for all castle army builders such as me this set mainly have no major faults and i love it so much although i have done some slight modifciations but this set is a must for me to buy more and more meanwhile i will need to wait for the next shipment hope everyone have enjoying viewing this simple review of mine edited by whitefang 25 may 2008  1252 pm	positive
dragonator on may 25 2008 0821 pm said thanks for the review whitefang i love these sets and i wish they were available in nz so far it seems they may never come here but i can sit and hope i like the look of them after your makeover a real skeleton army there did you say youve bought 12 thts lots of skelies are you planning a big moc or something no problem i had bought it last month i thought it was so simple to do a review for this was looking through the thread then i realised there is a request for it it was an unexpected shipment that send to singapore it came in very limited quantity most of the battlepacks were snapped within a day or two when it arrived well i am thinking of building something big in the future its just a plan that i have not decided yet for me i always love to see the beauty of a big army with different battalions forming a kingdom thats why i always buy many many sets that have figures that attracts me and for this battlepack it served a very good purpose for it	neutral
thanks for the review i wanted to see what was in this set looks good is it sold in stores edited by mammymarf 25 may 2008  0338 pm	positive

hollisbrick on may 25 2008 0854 pm said thanks for the review it wasnt really a request but more of an imply to do it anyway great review cant wait til these come to aus probably when the rest of the castle comes out in september though well i am glad you enjoyed this review i hope these excellent battlepacks will reach the coast of australia and the rest of the world soon guess then we will have to wait till september 08 mammymarf on may 25 2008 1137 pm said thanks for the review i wanted to see what was in this set looks good is it sold in stores yes i have bought these from stores in my country however it came in limited quantity and it was snapped out within moments mack on may 26 2008 1247 am said i wish these battlepacks had a reasonable price click here to see the canadian price of these battlepacks 18 dollars thats 6 dollars more than the starwars battlepack yet you get the same amount of lego or less then a starwars battlepack how the megablok does lego price its items  im gonna have to skip this set and a few others that i wanted because of this bloody outrageous back on topic thanks for the detailed review whitefang i also like your little changes to the set they really make this set look better mack i am glad you liked the little changes i made yes the price for the battlepacks is a little steep however for the amount of minifigs and castle accessories the price and quantity justifiy my bulk purchase this is one way to acquired soldiers without spending much money on other sets in this way you will save much more i understand the concern of star wars battlepacks from your country but in my country star wars battlepacks are priced much much higher than the castle battlepacks asuka on may 26 2008 0138 am said thanks whitefang castle battle packs simply wonderful finally a dream came true well done tlc asuka i agreed with you totally this is indeed a dream come true batbrick on may 26 2008 0659 am said thanks whitefang i love this battlepack but can only really hope to get one still great accesories and a spider thats great batbrick away batbrick you must get one of these packs i am sure it will help you in your batman medival mocs there are many possibilites for you to play around and custom with your minifigs this battlepack and of course crown battlepack too will prove useful to you edited by whitefang 26 may 2008  0241 am	positive
no offence make this 799 can too expensive to be coming with only a few figures 20 earns you the same amount of figs plus a catapult barricade two horses and a jousting divider	negative
whitefang although i realize that the battle packs are great specifically for building armies and castle accessories which is why its such a shame that i wont be able to buy these things  while sdpirates sets are more for a catapult calvary whatever the fact to the matter is with the battle pack you get 5 minifigs with lots of accessories while with the sets that sdpirate showed us you get 5 minifigs with an okay amount of accessories 3 horses including two skeleton ones a ballista a weapons rack and a jousting barricade you cannot say that the battle pack contains the same amount of stuff that the other two sets have and therefore should be priced the same it just seems that lego is ripping off canadian army builders to me if the battle pack contained a small catapult or wall so that it contained about the same amount of stuff that the other sets had it would be fair it seems stupid that you will only get minifigs from one set while you can get about the same amount of minifigs plus a bunch of other stuff from two other equally priced sets that’s why to me these battle packs are a rip off because of what they contain imho the battle packs seem to be only worth about 10 dollars	neutral
thanks for the review whitefang your additions look great i like your mace much better than the use of a small technic cog your looks much sturdier and that helmet looks really great on skellie soldiers i never thought to use that before very cool indeed peace	positive
mack on may 26 2008 0130 pm said you cannot say that the battle pack contains the same amount of stuff that the other two sets have and therefore should be priced the same it just seems that lego is ripping off canadian army builders to me if the battle pack contained a small catapult or wall so that it contained about the same amount of stuff that the other sets had it would be fair it seems stupid that you will only get minifigs from one set while you can get about the same amount of minifigs plus a bunch of other stuff from two other equally priced sets that’s why to me these battle packs are a rip off because of what they contain imho the battle packs seem to be only worth about 10 dollars mack i can understand your concern when pricing is concerned pricing is always a big issue for us to determine whether to buy or not to buy a certain set in a particular country pricing varies differently across different countries such as us europe canada australia and etc this is something very hard for us to decide on we cant be sure why tlc placed their pricing strategies this way well i think we should appericate what tlc is trying to do for us by not using price as the only factor to judge whether to buy this set or not at least i am sure there are many of us trying to request for battlepacks to muster armies for their mocs armies collection and etc different people have different judgements towards different sets and different themes i respect your opnion imo lets dont let price be the only determined factor to decide whether to purchase a particular set or not instead consider an array of factors that is offered however i do know that consumers like me and you are always affected by price iamded on may 26 2008 0140 pm said thanks for the review whitefang your additions look great i like your mace much better than the use of a small technic cog your looks much sturdier and that helmet looks really great on skellie soldiers i never thought to use that before very cool indeed iamded i am glad you enjoyed the review and my slight modifications that mace was a much looking weapon it looks much firm than the orignal look the design was inspired from dwarf mine and dwarf mine defender i would not want to have so many troll flags hanging around the nose cone helmet was to give the soliders a whole new look to me it retains the classic look yet it belongs to present theme suitable for my skeleton elite guards	negative
thanks for the nice review whitefang i got the knights bp just for the scared face	neutral
sorry to be going a little off topic here but personally i have just bought 40 crowny battle packs for the only reason that i am running out of space to store the left over blocks about 500 of my crownies came from sets mentioned above on sale which would have been cheaper than the battle packs thanks for the review whitefang but i dont think i will be buy any skeleton battle packs that army is large enough	neutral
thebrickster on may 28 2008 0121 pm said for those of you who buy so many of this and the other battle pack with crownies what do you do with all of them is this simply to create a largescale army or do you plan to build large castle scenes with all the figs id love to see some pictures on the share your castle army thread i am a army builder and hope one day to make large scale castle battle scenes time is a huge factor at the moment i have to work so hard to pay for all thislol there is a queens birthday holiday coming up on the 9th of june here in australia thats the deadline i have given myself you will definately see my army in the share your castle army thread thats the beauty of the battle packs the figures come armed	positive
i dont think these new skeletons do it for me but thanks for a good review	negative
ive always wanted to see this set closeup voltio thanks for sharing the image review this is the only jungle adventurers set i dont have and its got some great unique pieces esp those leaf brick pieces whats great is theyre not stickers this is a really a nice review of a neat set with the extra little humor you shared thanks again for taking the time to photograph and share over eb	positive
thanks for this great review voltio i never knew of this set till now and it really looks great i never paid much attention to those aztecincan style sets which i now regret i love the bright colours used here and all the great traps theres so many of them which is exactly what we can expect from an old incan temple like this one im surprised theres no catapult anyway the minifigs included are also great and am i right in guessing those bricks are printed that would be fantastic as they look amazing that boat hull is new to me too although i guess the fact that its mainly in belville sets explains that pretty well thanks again for the sweet review do you have any other jungle adventurers sets you plan to review peace	positive
ive always wanted this set ever since it came out in 99 i have never seen it close up unless you count driving over it in lego racers 2 so thanks for the pictures and the great review voltio on may 26 2008 0443 am said el conde you are too beautiful a woman to be wandering alone in the jungle miss storm please allow me to accompany you gail storm im with johnny and i have a cutlass el conde ill be on my way hehe	positive
a real classic thanks for that nice and funny review voltio a well designed set very playable with a lot of nifty traps a very good use of that raised baseplate and really nice crafts the mf characters´re excellent too and although the color scheme´s great and original especially with all these neat printed pieces it´s perhaps the only part of that set that looks a little out of date today nevertheless the set´s plain charming and shows clearly that tlc don´t need licenses to do some distinct adventurer sets	positive
great review i saw the instructions of this set but never atracted me until now a great set an a excelente review	positive
thanks for reviewing this rare set since it came out in 1999 i have only seen this set in a toystore one single time one single copy as well it was in the summer of 1999 in belgium arlon in a store called maxi toys belgiums tru i think they had the three biggest junglesets for sale there these ancient ruins the set with the beautiful black boat and the zeppelin being into adventurers at that time i had never seen the entire jungle theme not even in a leaflet or catalog and surprised as i was i bought all three sets that was one happy dutch boy in belgium surprisingly the two smallest sets made it in very small quantities to my local stores in holland except for the pontoon plane and small raft which was my very first shop at home order the spiders secret i bought off bl which makes me the proud owner of the entire jungle serie back to the set this was the first time in a long history of collecting lego that i had a deformed piece an 2x8 red plate was twisted i twisted it back and it still serves its purpose i loved the whole steamidea in this jungle serie the two boats both including the one in this set had nice steamengines and a very cool mechanic yours has the wrong hathair btw to come along with them the skeleton falling down on the end of a chain was the most intriguing part of this set for me it worked really well and when you were done scaring minifigures you could winch it up again ready for the next go the only thing i did not really like about this set was the difference in wheelsize on the car front small back large and the way the palmtree consisted out of just three parts all in all a great set that is becoming more rare and expensive as we speakpost get it edited by simonwillems 26 may 2008  0759 pm	positive
great review i just barly missed the jungle series growing up with half a year of jungle and mainly orient expedition and dino island i like egypt more but this set despite the 4x4 palm tree is practically perfect i love the detail and vibrant colours gotta say ive got a thing for pippin reed myself by the way what does vhtf mean edited by sdpirate 28 may 2008  0106 am	positive
vhtf very hard to find to answer some earlier replies no there are no stickers in this set while some adventurers sets of the era had stickers the 5956 zeppelin had tons all of the interesting mesoamerican designs from this set are printed also simonwillems was correct my mechanic is missing his hat which should be a black kepi theyre extremely expensive on bl though proving once again that this set has some awesome parts so i ordered a replacement from lego its in the mail and should come soon	positive
the printed pieces are the real gems of this set beyond them there isnt much to this set though the boat hull is nice the model itself isnt all that great the new akator temple is definately a superior model at least in piece count but those printed pieces are hard to resist steve	negative

i absolutly love this set this is in my opinion the best adventurers set it has it all the falling bridge the falling skeleton the spear trap and the classic trapdoor it is a musthave set thanks for providing such a nice review	positive
i just rebuilt this entire set today and the nostalgia was totally worth taking bits and pieces from a few of my own mocs only now did i realize how rare some of those pieces are and im rather thankful that i have all of the printed pieces and achu the only pieces i am missing is a transparent orange headlight 3 out of 4 black minifigure hammer light gray chainreplaced it with a dark gray chain and one whole minifigure which is the mechanic guy i still have both the instructions and the box and both are in appalling conditions kudos to the pre2000s lego sets like this one love em	positive
wow good review i used to love this old sets as i was greatly fascinated by inca and aztec cultures and the mayans technological marvels astounded me i was thrilled to death when lego released little aztec figures so of course i jsut had to buy some your narration with the sig fig was hilarious and the review was all around wonderful keep up the good work mate	positive

welcome to cardinal bricks review of 7736 its a small set but as i bought it the other day i felt that it probably did merit a short review the box is ofcourse far larger than necessary theres plenty of air inside the contence is one bag and the instruction booklet you could proably build it inside the bag if the desire took you we have one new coastguard with the slightly stubly head found in the castle range and a transclear visor the build was challanging and arduious the final product is quite nice at one 300 its a good set only 50p more than an impulse set and with enough extra parts to justify the increase in the price a good set for a little gift or so on the buggy moves well theres not that much to say really for i cant really think of additional models to build with the parts but then what do you expect for the price edited by cardinal brick 26 may 2008  0647 pm	positive
thank you very much for the review cardinal brick thats indeed a very nice little set klausdieter	positive
donneyboy on nov 27 2008 0840 pm said i might buy a second one of that set and build it in the bag i just wanna prove that it is possible i bought 4 myself its like having a little beach fleet	positive
so i just piced up a new digital camera and i thought what better way to try it than doing a review of my newest set the new 7738 coast guard helicopter itsmy first review so go easy on me lets start off with the small stuff first the mini figs you get 4 figs total two helicopter pilots a diver and a civilan to rescue the torsos are nothing new on the pilot and diver same ones as in the last coast guard line but i like the colors alot better in this coast guard line than the previous generation the yellow and blue really work well together and the coloring on the badge looks great the civilian looks to be just a dock worker with an overall torso and a beenie the diver has nice vented helmet and a pair of flippers that suits his duty perfect next we have an absolute work of lego art the rescue raft the orange flaps can be moved back for easy entry to the raft as well as the white support beams with the caution tape i put support in perenthaces cause they really dont support anything just there to fill in the gaps at the top of the raft is a red locator beacon ccommunications antenna and a cargo loop for lifting the raft lets move on to the interior of the raft not much here but you can see the techinc beam that attaches to the top loopand to the floor of the raft so far this has proven to be very sturdy and has supported the full weight of the raft quite well you can also see the white box that holds the equipment of the raft here you can see the life saver tube heres a shot with our dock worker peaking out the side the raft says max ocupants 4 but with the storage box that might be a tight fit now lets move on to the helicopter in my opinion this is one of the best helicopters tlc has come out with to date i really felt they captured the look and proportions of a real coast guard helicopter it uses a lower hull and tail section of the new airliner and cargo airplane it really seems to work well with this application the engines have good detail using new cheese graders as vents as well as the new engine stacks that come in the new speed racer sets the rotors also appear to be new as well lets move on to the cockpit we have two seats for our pilots with a sticker sheet for intruments on a flat 4 wide plate theres also an antena being used as a flight stick another shot with our pilots at the helm now lets moveon to the high lihgt of this heavy lifting machine the med bay and lifting winch httpwwwbrickshelicopter020jpg here you can see the winch arm at rest along with the medical strechter the bad part is that the med strechter doesnt include the ussually included fold away wheels heres a shot with the winch arm extened ready for rescue in the second shot you can see the drum that the wire coils up in it coils up via a recently new power functions pull back motor to operate just pull out the winch cable hook on your load and presse this orange button on the side the bad part of the new power functions winch is that although its very smooth in its operation its not very strong it will only lift the raft a couple inches before it runs out of torque it also has a tendency to want to pull the crane arm backin while its lifting it doesnt matter if its a light load or heavy load the bay doors open on both sides for easy postioning of the figures and accses to the strechter here we have our diver looking over his rescuee nice and roomy if you dont mind a crane arm being in your way at 3999 and a peice count of 445 i felt this set was a great good considering what your getting the raft construction is very creative and is probbly the highlight of the set by itself the helicopter is probbly one of the best if not the best helicopter tlc has ever came out with if you can get over its size in a scale of one to five price peice count playability design overall 5 i would have given it a full 5 out of five but since the winch cant pull the raft all the way it didnt fell it right even with this minor flaw i still highly recomend this set	neutral
wow i was skeptical of this coast guard line though getting to see some detailed pictures of this set i really want to get get it alas i have not the money to get it and it isnt available in my town oh well maybe i can catch it on a sale at some point good review	positive

very nice job on the review 5150 i definitly like this set much better now that i have seen good pics of it i am definitly picking this up as soon as i can again great review  model on	positive
thanks everyone for the nice coments its nice to finaly have a camera that can take some decent photos makes doing reviews much more enjoyable klausdieter on may 28 2008 0917 pm said thank you very much for the nice review 5150 lego the helicopter is  apart from that it is very very big and that it does not include any interior  a very nice set  the most i like the life raft becuase it is simply  nevertheless i dont know if i buy it probably not  but its very nice two questions  where can you fasten the stretcher on to haul it up and down is the motor working with batteries klausdieter there is no real way to lift up the stretcher due to the crane arm being in the way there really isnt any room for any kind oflifting straps the set does include a 1x2 plate with a hinge for the diver to stand on so at least he can hold on to someone the crane lifts them up and then he can put them in the strechter thats my guess at least as far as the motor i dont believe it uses bateries since you pull out the motor and all the button does is recoil the winch line back in i have to say it does a very good job of that and is very smooth as long as you dont have anything to heavy one detail i forgot to meation is the shark its nothing new just the basic shark lego has had around for nealy 2 decades but it was a detail nothing less	neutral
nice review the helicopter reminds a sikorsky chopperisnt it	positive
i could tell from the pictures that a lot maybe all the designs on the raft were stickers in the whole set are there any printed parts besides the torsos or is it all stickers	negative
thats a very nice set im having my doubts about getting it though still the overall shape and size of the helicopter remind me of the reallife ch53 military cargo helicopter a very nice review youve got the photography down very well i feel perhaps a bit of nitpicking but at the end where you assign a rating if you do a rating with faces which is fine by me you may want to seperate the faces by a line otherwise it may become too crowded to the eye	neutral
this is a very good review thank you but i have some questions about the grey new parts in the life raft are they 1x1 like their counterparts with the clips or 1x2 and can they be held by a minifig by the handle if so these could be very useful for brickbuild weapons  tools also im looking forward to some orange eta 2 jedi interceptor mocs now who wants to be the first to make one btw which jedi has an orange eta 2	positive

im rather fond of helicopters and have built many different types this doesnt really remind me of any particular model other than perhaps an eh 101 merlin and even that resemblance is very superficial just for the record this is a sikorsky sea king and this is a sikorsky mh53 a derivation of the ch53 the only resemblance i see with the former is the colour scheme and with the latter the fact that its got a fat rearend sponsons and six blades it doesnt matter though because i really like it the colour scheme is great the shape is nice its got quite a bit of detail and i just have to get my hands on the cockpit window and those new rotor blades when i first saw the large aircraft pieces a few years ago i figured they were very much singleuse parts but the tail end doesnt look too bad pretty clever i like the raft too it really does look like the real deal that the helicopter cant lift it really isnt an issue because in real life they wouldnt lift the raft either theyd use the rescue hoist to lift the occupants of the raft into the helicopter one by one or perhaps in pairs imagine a storm with a helicopter hovering over tall waves with a big fat raft strung from a cable underneath it the raft would catch a lot of wind and flop around quite a bit causing it to loose all its occupants and also yanking the helicopter around possibly causing the pilot to loose control and crash bad idea cheers ralph edited by ralphs 30 may 2008  1109 pm	negative

thanks for the review riddler your pics are a bit blurry though if you want them a bit better you should sit your camera on a hard surface so you dont wobble it as much i love the tumbler though it is quite massive but either way ill be glad to get it the figs in my opinion are really bad joker should atleast have a different suit oh well its worth it for that awesome van and instance where the stickers are totally worth it thanks again batbrick away	neutral

great looking set loved the review pictures were good sometimes blury but i think i will pick this up after i get the rest of the kotcs sets riddler a tip i learned in photoclass is to take a breath in and hold it while pushing the shutter so you dont accidentally move while breathing i thought it was silly but it does work again great review looking forward to more	positive

thank you for clearing that up i felt that it was ok to review an old topic as stated rather than just go ahead and start a new one a shame that this set as all other batman sets have gone up so highly in value but still all things considering general after market lego price hikes it is still a wonderfull set even with its market value today that is if you can ignore the mrsp	positive
great find and thanks for the review inertia on may 28 2008 1108 pm said undoubtably better than its newer counterpart the mt101 armored drilling unit care to explain why personally i think that aside from the colour scheme the new one is far better why suspension more enclosed cockpits buglike appearence i suppose its a matter of personal opinion though	neutral
great review of a great set i always figured the hoses were welding torches attached to jetpacks yeah as the whole thing had the vibe of a mobile repair center much like many of my favorite sets this one has a base of simple bricks and plates and then from that solid foundation the rest is built out to be decorative or have the action features this gives sets a very solid feel as demonstrated in this set the first snowspeeder and galaxy explorer the mm armored drilling unit has a more technic base giving it a less solid appearance and though i like the set that jet that luanches from the back is horrible partially because of the useless orange containment things the mega core has a nifty crane instead of a big useless jet tohst	positive
sinner on may 28 2008 0235 pm said care to explain why the mcm has a pure weight of parts that i find hard to quantify but love it is just so dense when you build it full of nice surprises no technique required and a wonderful stearing mechanism that i rank as more important than the suspension of the mars version this thing was meant to crush anyway who needs suspension i also like the way you never felt that the mtrons deserved a base after building this it was that good the colour scheme was perfect its space and i like it enough said great review btw god bless nathan naturally youre entitled to your inferior opinion	positive
i love the design of the front canopy of this set but i always felt that they could have done more with the rest of the model this set is good candidate for customization though there is quite a bit on unused space inside especially in the middle section i want to try putting a technicstyle engine into mine at some point along with the necessary gearing i got my mcm brand new off ebay some years ago for a pretty good price but the box was very worn out and the big transneon panel which floats freely inside the box was a bit damaged as for the hosejetpack things i always assumed that they were either welding torches or flamethrowers take your pick quote kinda sad to think that with tlcs recent ban on magnets in their products first time ive heard of that what are they going to do for the train couplings	neutral

sinner on may 29 2008 0520 pm said no but we especially imperialshadows are working on new indexes supposedly the space one was my job okay just dont forget this when it goes up i like self promotion i have about 10 old space sets coming in from ebay and gonna review them soon as well so that should be some good additions to the index when it goes up thanks	neutral
thanks for that fine review of a really classic and impressive mtron set inertia tohst on may 28 2008 0455 pm said the mm armored drilling unit has a more technic base giving it a less solid appearance  yeah it´s pretty sad some of these new sets just look very cool at the outside but appear to be hollow and blank at the inside especially with the annoying use of studless technic beams to mod these sets often means to change the whole inner frame leaving us with a bunch of imho not really very useful parts it´s not a very honorable marketing strategy to produce set designs that´re aimed to look impressive and cool on the box art but´re pretty useless in their inner structures of course i don´t want to offend some technic lovers and although i always was more the system kind of guy why can´t they just use some technic beams with studs at least i grew up with just imagine with pictures of alternative models on the box and i don´t think it´s that easy especially for younger kids to mod some of these terrific blownup sets like it once was with sets like this one here implosion off	positive
sinner on may 30 2008 0138 am said thats because of cost  ive never heard an official word perhaps i should raise a topic but i think that they dont show them any more because it became a support nightmare what do i mean i bet tlg was tired of letters and calls saying timmy cant make this model shown on the box can you send instructions and the extra parts of course it´s a money issue my question was more rhetorical but i still don´t like how they sacrifice inherent set design on the altar of cost saving efforts to be even more correct i don´t understand why they try to make extraordinary cool looking sets with a pretty weak inner life yeah they want to sell sets with something that looks exciting on the box art but lego was and fortunately is with many recent sets too always more than just an impressive spaceship or sf tank vehicle it´s the sum of the set itself and its parts and what you can do with it that makes out the full fun of it the best thing you can do with a new set beside some ucs sets perhaps is to mod the set according to your own likings this is where just imagine begins and how kids start to learn how to moc at least it was like that to me individualizing official sets and looking on some cool alternative models gave me my first ideas and helped my imagination and skills to grow back in these days when i was a wee child books movies and tv series as a source of inspiration just came a little later i can see many people complaining about how to make the alternative models yes but just stop using them on the box art´s a very poor solution and a dangerous one too at least in long terms of course i know that you know all these things too sinner i just think it´s a shame and a risk too because tlc´s perhaps sacrificing more than they might know by yet building with bricks is the main attraction of lego not just some cool crafts to play around with others can do this too and maybe better than tlc if the kids of today ever forget about the fascination of being imaginative tlc´ll only lose in the end	neutral
this super set contains many of the city sets you can get for your mini city hospital the smallest set is the 7902 car with a doctor i thought it looked a bit too slow here is a car you can build with the same bricks the instruction manual for the ambulance does contain a picture of an alternate model but it is actually quite hard to build something significantly different this sets lacks some snotbricks so i had to be a little more creative and came up with this ambulance it is more a hearse than an ambulance the helicopter has a lot of slopes so i built a speed boat for those special emergencies unlike the first two sets i used far from all the bricks in this this set does really have some great parts the brickshelf gallery with some more pictures is anyone up to the challenge and build some alternate models of the last set in the super pack  the hospital	positive

brickadier general on may 29 2008 0727 pm said hi all so i was at the walmart yesterday and had the munchies and was looking for something to eat somewhere along the line i stopped caring about food and decided to browse the toy department to see what they had legowise thank you very much for that neat review brickadier general  i´m glad that you changed your mind a review of a burger wouldn´t be half that interesting for sure it´s just a mediocre set to me but of course it´s always cool to get important mfs in less pricy sets i like the penguin´s sub from the batcave more just because they did a fine job on resembling a penguin without using a sticker robins craft looks fairly nice but the most useful parts of the whole set for me personally would be those indeed very neat green engines	positive
clonecommando007 on may 29 2008 0653 pm said great review though you really seem to like this set and it probably is a great one im not a fan of the penguin sub or at least im not from what i see its not for everybody personally i just bought the set for the figures and i was originally just going to sort the parts and put them away in storage asuka on may 29 2008 0713 pm said thank you very much for that neat review brickadier general  i´m glad that you changed your mind a review of a burger wouldn´t be half that interesting for sure it´s just a mediocre set to me but of course it´s always cool to get important mfs in less pricy sets i like the penguin´s sub from the batcave more just because they did a fine job on resembling a penguin without using a sticker robins craft looks fairly nice but the most useful parts of the whole set for me personally would be those indeed very neat green engines yes it probably would have been nicer if they would have at least done a brick built beak for the front of the sub unfortunately i never got my hands on the batcave set so i never was able to build the original sub	negative

thanks  why isnt this set on sh who wants the second riddle	neutral
thanks for the great review brickadier general the sub looks very nice and i like the idea of a raising periscope did the batcave sub have that feature and the details on the sub look very nice the inclusion of the penguin robin and two of those great brickbuilt penguins really confirms that ill be getting this considering that i didnt purchase the batcave however i am rather dissapointed that this set is so similar to the vehicles of penguin and robinin repectively in the batcave set i feel that it only really caters to those who havnt bought the set and i wouldve much appreciated different vehicles overall a very nice set perhaps the best of the 2008 wave despite its lack of originality thank you very much for the review bg	positive
i was never considering getting this set as i dont really like batman but if i found this set and had some money with me i would buy it ii would use it for indiana jones or something and the revolevers and top hats the only problem i see with the boxart is that the penguin is drowning	positive
looks like a cool set but the hairpiece for robin is vary disapointing i would be so glad is they used the regular hair you see all the time i hope lego will not make a habit of using that hairpiece on other figures	negative

set 8635  agents  mobile command center pieces 1154 price us8999 those dedicated agents theyve fought chainsawarmed villains battled radiocontrolled cyborg crocs chased pallets of badlystored golden loot and wrestled killer sharks with vicious toothy grins finally theyve caught the notorious dr inferno and imprisoned him in their cavernous mobile command center but dr inferno wont go down without a fight can the agents stop the evil dr disco inferno fleeing will spy clops laser gun burn through the door in time or will dr inferno simply use the lovely agent traces enormous ponytail as an escape ladder to freedom more importantly will there be a riot in the streets of lego city as afols go apopletic at the thought of a 12 wide truck roaring through their ordered town layouts stay tuned part 1 the box instructions parts as the largest of the agents sets so far the box is easily the biggest trainee agents examine the following three pics and see if you notice anything odd box front box back box middle spot it thats right the printed cardboard which has supposed to be the bottom half of the fold out middle section is on the back slicing the ultralarge set image which would form the foldout in half  the way the cardboard is printed as one piece before its folded i think this would be very hard to do accidentally so suspect a major stuffup somewhere along the production line i bought this set off bricklink so would be very interested if anyone in the states who has seen these boxes actually on the shelves can tell me if this is common or rare basically i want to know if i should be annoyed that the bricklink seller didnt list this in the set description or are they all like this the instructions come in 4 booklets the parts list comes in at 5 pages which is a lot even at halfsize pages  large images of the parts inventory are in this folderwhen moderated for anyone interested heres also some cute agentstype artwork at the end of one of the books instructions show piece callouts and are divided into sections according to numbered bags as youd expect for a set with 1100 parts this baby comes with a lot of bags its a treasure trove of dark blue as well as the obvious large slopes and wall panels which make up the body and the roof there is a wealth of smaller navy blue pieces as well  small 1x1 bricks 2x2 bricks 1x1 plates 2x2 tiles heaps of 2x plates some slopes 22x cheese pieces basically anyone wanting a lot of dark blue should think about this set the roof panels alone for example could provide a dark blue sea for a modernised pirate moc 2 dsss dreaded sticker sheets quelle surprise  stickers the grey parts of the stickers here are metallic silver ink which is a nice touch actually as sticker sheets go theyre not too bad fairly subtle for the most part and the navy blue actually matches the bricks themselves however after looking at the sticker sheets i thought i was missing something what about the pieces used for the projection screens showing dr inferno and the sharks  why werent they on the sticker sheets there must be another one frantically i checked and rechecked the box and flipped through all the instruction manuals to find the elusive 3rd sheet where was it ten minutes later i noticed something which had honestly never occured to me  there were actual printed pieces in this set so obvious and yet so unthinkable its horrifying how years and years of exoforce and speed racer set releases can mentally condition peoples thought processes tut tut lego what have you reduced us to here they are folks  actual printed pieces yes i do believe this news deserves the caps i also noticed this nifty modification of the usual 2x3 cupboard  you can now fit drawers in it very clever this may have been around in belville sets for years for all i know but its new to me the drawers slide in and out very well and the top one sits on slight indentations in the middle of the cupboard part 2 the figs our trusty agents  charge chase trace and fuse high powered agents dont have time for names of more than one syllable  thats why the bad guys always lose  chase and fuse have the mutt hair in black and dark orange the lovely agent trace has an exquisite new hairpiece in dark brown perfect for rapunzel themed mocs as you can see her ponytail is loooong makes it hard to sit down the poor girl i feel sorry for all these female figs with such intricate hairstyles that they can never relax in an ordinary lego chair however at least she has two breasts unlike the recent harley quinn fig compensation indeed seriously though its great that theres a separate torso print for the female character and this attention to detail is typical of the set as a whole three of the agents have reversable heads  nice touch with the headsets and i like the id cards on their pants obviously the agents security system is based on some kind of crotch measuring device this would make sense considering the conspicuous bulges in the pants of dr infernos men see the other agents set reviews the villains  spy clops dr inferno gold tooth dr infernos hair in all its glory this is a great piece although the orange colouring is a little rough on the front its so 3d it deserves a back and side view and indeed eb thread all of its own as mentioned elsewhere this is different plastic to the normal minifig hair but it doesnt quite feel as soft as the exoforce hair it doesnt fall off as much anyway the figs get 1010 from me awesome hairpieces in great colours for the agents and a sleek navy blue neon green uniform the villains faces are great and they are all very distinctive the attention to detail is outstanding and its great to see a lego inhouse theme with characters as memorable and cool as figs from the licensed themes  part 3 the build the build is divided into three stages  the small vehicles the front of the truck and the massive command center section a small vehicles first up all the small vehicles we have a small flyer 2 buggies jet ski and a speed boat  all in glorious navy blue with little bits of silver detailing top view these vehicles are all simple small and welldesigned probably the weakest is the flyer only because the cockpit looks a little large in fact the small flyer is probably the weakest element of 8365 overall which tells you how good the set itself is in various threads here this set has been heavily criticised for being way out of proportion theres a reason for that as we shall come to however the existence of these small sets should appease some people with the new coast guard sets for example all of these save the flyer wouldnt look out of place on a city beach with a little modding heres an example  agents beach party spongebob couldnt help but crash the villains only have one small vehicle but theyve been wellserved in the smaller sets and this one is a unique and clever design i love the triangular shape and the simple but clever technique of making the arch slopes meet up around the propellers its sort of insectile in black and orange and looks very different from the usual assortment of helicopters etc b truck front this thing is a beast seriously look at it its chunky and mean looking you dont want to mess with this baby the build is really nice like a lot of star wars vehicles its all based on technic beams pinned together unlike a lot of mars mission sets underneath isnt all technic beams with some plates slapped on like a facade the majority is a lot of plates and bricks which all fit together solidly you can see from the detailing of cheese grater slopes and silver pieces on the front how effort has been made to give this vehicle a distinct feel different to other lego sets sure the silver slope mirrors might be a bit too much for some but this baby is all about attitude you can imagine it roaring down the road en route to dr infernos diabolical lair after all these sets are agents sets  nobody said they were secret agents c  command center  whole assembly heres a view of the whole thing assembled  inside and cool details to follow at the end its kind of hard to show here as it is extreeeeemely long this is indeed a big set the build for the trailer part of the command center is fun and very satisfying yes there are large pieces but there is also a huge amount of detail it is also solid as a rock i remember being annoyed building the big ferrari truck a few years ago  everytime you looked at it an 8 x 16 plate fell off the mobile command center is solid  even with the hinged roof and special features it is not delicate at all kudos to the designers again as it is mainly a brick build rather than a technic one i also like how the command center part connects to the cabin  its not a special piece at all just a technic axle going through two circle plates but it works and its solid please note ive been selective about which stickers ive applied during the build top view the rear heres an example of why i like the build a the designers have enough sense to put a ladder so a minifig can climb up to the interior when the command center is open b notice that although the ladder clips at the top there is an extra clip there in the middle purely to hold it in place so it doesnt flap around and holds firm i dont know if most designers would even think to put a ladder there let alone go the extra mile and put a mechanism to hold it in place pure class oh and notice the greebly detail stuff to the right there too the other side this is probably the other weak part of the build  the bricky gaps at the top where the hinge to open the roof sits its a little gappy but the set is so big you dont really notice d and now for the fun stuff  inside and neat details ok so weve built the thing its big its blue the top of the trailer itself would make a good warehouse moc for a harbour layout but what about inside is it any good what about all those small vehicles from the start of the review where do they go well im glad you asked because the solution is superb the small flyer folds slightly and slides into place here lift off the roof and youre away the large buggy and the speedboat go under here the jetski slides out of the rear here attached to its own little platform and the small buggy goes inside the main cabin theres even a crane so you can lift it down so now we know why this set is so large to fit everything in its amazing that this functionality doesnt affect the aesthetics of the set as a whole but we still havent finished on the details the front section has a very easytoswingopen roof section and missiles theres also a command section underneath the bit where the flyer lifts out and now for the interior i have to say i really like this space not only is it packed with great stuff theres also enough room for minifigs to move around i hate bases where the figs only have about 2 studs to actually stand and walk aquabase invasion is a nice set for example but the actual functional space inside the base is teensy claustrophobia you know within a week theyd be fighting to toss each other out of the airlock no such problems for these suave agents who have plenty of legroom and the ability to launch missiles from their ceiling the whole of the interior zooming in moving from left to right first off the medicine cabinet looks like someones been leaving secret mission dossiers lying around the projector area for mission briefings dr inferno recently changed his hair colour from purple to orange it seems why are all these minifigs so obsessed with their hair the projector folds down when the trailer is open push the button and the light glows on now dr infernos hair is orange again this is one of my favourite parts of the set it works a charm the batteries for these lightbricks can also be replaced  instructions are in the manual agent charge considers sharkfin soup for dinner did i mention these projection panels are printed the detail is very fine too the tool section laptops sit in the middle compartment you get some flippers yellow scuba tank and various implements im so impressed that the helmet is pearl silver with a different coloured visor too  theres so much variation in the parts in this set you dont get the sense the designers are using the same thing over and over to save money it all feels luxe and topoftheline just like the command center itself two laptops  yay the aforementioned rooftop missiles the dr inferno cage nasty electric shocks bzzt you can see my reviewing skills are burning out now  sentences truncated another example of detail  nowhere else in the set is a 1x1 transgreen tile used  they could have used a 1x1 trans green cheese wedge piece as there are others in the set but they didnt how does dr i get out flick that lever on the right hand exterior and the door pops open spy clops the loyal minion awaits his master on the other side and there we have it take a bow guys theres a lot of spare parts a suspicious amount of dark blue small slopes but i checked the instructions and didnt see anything missing i have to say i do like the new policy since speed racer i think of including these small slopes as extras part 4 overall rating if youve made it this far youve got more stamina than dr infernos army of cyborg animals themselves as i said earlier this set has drawn criticism for the size of the truck however large vehicles do exist  i grew up in a wheat farming area and as a kid the size of the lorries that thundered past carrying grain was probably intimidating to me as this monstrous espionage machine is to the good citizens of lego city on top of that it does contain a plethora of 4wide vehicles inside  criticism of this set on the basis of size to me also seems misguided as this is basically a playset  and it is a very good one to boot as you can probably tell i love it to pieces and wouldnt hesitate to recommend it to anyone whether for parts or for play value check out the parts list in this folderwhen moderated and you can see just how many excellent pieces it contains a lightup brick a flood of navy blue metallic silver bricks  were spoiled 8635 is also an enjoyable build with fantastic figs and topoftheline detailing in a year when ive found city a bit disappointing after the run of great sets in 20062007 the agents line has been one of the surprise hits for me and i cant wait to see what the designers come up with next edited by sveltecorps 02 june 2008  1246 am	positive

you know i like many had doubts about these sets when they were first mentioned but ive decided i want the whole line now this set is the créme de la créme just beautifully stunning that is a great review sveltecorps you have gone into fantastic detail and description of all the elements really it is this review that has persuaded me to buy this set i blame you the minifigs are great the vehicles are better and the truck and interior is awesome the few minor draw backs are far outweighed by the attention to detail and the many unique and cool elements used in this set and printed pieces that is even better great job you have obviously put a tremendous effort in making this review and i for one definitely appreciate it i am looking forward to these sets being available in new zealand	positive
must get two thanks so much this review has truly shown this set as a brilliant one even those who hate this theme must admit it is greatly designed i love the way the mini vehicles fit i love the light brick i love the truck front i love the trailer i love the missions bay i love holding cell i love everything edit and i second dragonators response when i say thankyou sveltecorps for this grand review you have convinced me utterly to get this batbrick away edited by batbrick 31 may 2008  1049 am	positive
wow like others have said i was unsure about these when i first heard about them but then looked at the first leaked pics and thought they actually look pretty neat now i have seen all the reviews i have to have all these sets at first i was thinking they would be great as parts packs but the more reviews i see the less i want to use them as part packs and just keep them as built or buy 2 so i can do both  cant wait till they hit the shelves in the uk thanks for the review	positive
thats an awesome review and a great set it seems with all of this years star wars i still havent got rogue shadow i cant afford agents too which is a shame looking at this	positive

sveltecorps a fanastic review of this biggest agents set at first i was not very keen to have this set however after reading your review you have make me swing up and down its simply fabulous thanks for your hard work i am sure its not easy to do this review i love that female minifig she looks awfully sweet especially with her new hair great job	positive
thanks for another wonderful review sveltecorps a very fine set indeed i absolutely love the way all of the vehicles fit into the command centre very clever the projector is really cool it looks very nice its great to see these light and sound bricks in the agents sets all of the little nooks and crannies in the centre are great too i really love the amount of detail featured mixed with all of the playability of this set the minifigs  as usual  are brilliant the uniforms look fantastic dr inferno looks especially great i love his white suit with hints of orange and who can forget his hair im really tempted to buy this beast now though im not sure my wallet will forgive me for it i suppose ill have to cut back on indy and castle multiples for now thanks for the truly great review sveltecorps nice work	positive
great review thanks thats one hell of a set i think lego has reached a certain kind of peak with the design cleverness and fun of this one im so relieved that agents seems to be shaping up to be even better then i thought it was going to beand i thought it was going to be cool to begin with agent charge not only does he look like dash justice but he has the name of one of dashs alpha team squadmates i call shenanigans	positive
wow excellent review thanks that set sure looks fantastic its incredible how much features theyve managed to pack in while keeping it roomy im really impressed by the quality of the design tlc is sure getting back on track with great design ow 2008 is going to be expensive	positive

i first i thought the whole agents line would not be very good but boy have i changed my mind this set looks amazing as do all of the other sets in the line i really like how the small vehicles all fit into the truck i dont like it when sets come with smaller vehicles and dont have anywhere to store them so they just float on the side that light projector is fantastic i cant believe they are actually printed this is definitly on my tobuy list thanks for the amazing review	positive
great review i just got 7644 mx81 hypersonic operations aircraft its a great ship i started to review it but then it started to rain i was outside so the review is coming tommorow technicolor stickers very pretty	positive
this set looks 10 times sweeter with the power functions too bad ill have to buy some extra	negative
wow this thing is very cool definately no lack of details and is quite cheap for the bang of the set that you get for some reason i really love the bay in the back of the detachable ship quite an improvement from last years line thank you for the review	positive
i was going to buy this set anyway but now im even more excited d my favorite part of this set is the bay that holds the little cart vehicles	positive
thank you for that fine review sveltecorps that´s a pretty cool set much more solid than the armoured drilling unit with a nice little transporter and some for sure pretty interesting additional power functions a very smart idea indeed did i miss something or is there really only one and probably improved shooting device and there´re even some levers to control the vehicles wow a matured marsmission on indeed now let´s get rid of these poor utilized jellies and we´re right on the way	positive

iron moose on jun 4 2008 1128 am said so is there some way to get all those motor bits at once or do you have to buy them on their own i dont think ive ever seen them in a store here only from sh so far or if you buy sets which they come in all the ones you need apart from one additional small motor are available in the 4958 monster dino set which i got half price i ordered the extra from sh at the same time i bought the set  but only because i had already looked at the instructions and knew what i needed if people have the ferris wheel set as well i think the small motor comes in that	neutral
this should be reported to the news 	neutral
well i guess its nice that theyre making the story background a little more clear with that jelly plugged into the power cable hmmh both jellies and crystals can be used as power sources think theres a connection both of them are transparent and greenish maybe jellies hatch from crystals like eggs or need them as food or something important like that yay for evil humans	positive
thanks for the great review sveltecorps i bought some of the mm last year and ended up selling them off for sw this new set has got me interested in mm again partly due to your cool review one question though did you get this set in aust shops or sh just wondering if i should be looking for it yet edit sorry just saw your other post saying it was ordered from sh cheers isc edited by i scream clone 04 june 2008  0808 am	positive

really nice review i love those sweet looking power functions on it if only the orange bits could be replaced then you could have a futuristic and motorized jungle cutter anyway the alien bit was disturbing but the overlytall new commanders look very very cool all in all a great set but i wont be able to buy it because in a few days sh will become 600 richer and my wallet will writhe around in pain on the floor	positive

algernon on jun 5 2008 0203 pm said why is it that agents and star wars get their own news articles but this fantastic set is totally ignored i think maybe theres a bit of star wars excitement on the front page which has probably got a few members frothing with excitement not every review needs to be frontpaged anyway 	neutral

well title says it the description youll understand later i ordered this off of sh last tuesday and oddly enough its listed on sh as mx81 hypersonic airplane id like to apologize for the random horrible faded pics i took the review outside and the clouds kept shifting changing the lighting and then i had to go inside because it started raining its been raining for a week its raining now as i type this so i foolishly went outside to take pics the front of the box not bad as far as boxes go it features a liftup tab which shows the various functions back of the box still not much to say two manuals i think this is just right not too thick but not too many manuals either oddly enough the box came with a little folded up piece of paper telling us not to mix the bags it comes sorted into 4 bags by the way minifigures the set features 3 normal mm figs 1 normal jellie and one of the new commanders i really like this guy he has a few issues like his hands being stuck sideways and still being hollow but still a great improvement hell make a lovely addition to any halloween moc stickers the set comes with a fairly big dss for the spacecraft pretty normal but i do like the dragon sticker then suprises of suprises a technicolor sticker sheet for the aliens how cool is this huh the tops of the actual stickers are shiny which is hard to see in the pic even the bottom is shiny who said stickers cant be cool the mining craft the little guy is pretty cute and well built my only gripe is that theres nowhere to spin the drill it seems so lifeless without a feature the alien craft youd think a commander would be important enough to have a seatbelt rather than be stabbed with a clip and stuck on the ship like those other grunt aliens i think this thing has some potential shiny stickers different body shape and when you look at those engines this thing could be an alien corvette but then you look at the back pretty bare no flares or anything its a cool little craft but it justlacks the modules these things have some potential as well with some modding they could be pretty cool unfortunetly its pretty boxy there are no engines and the wings are too small the top is pretty nice though the greebles are all right the controls as usual are a sticker pretty spacious mind you the cockpit doesnt stay flush with the body though the front plate underneath it can be easily replaced with a brick to fix that im not gonna comment on this the main body too bad the labratory isnt much of a lab a transred panel and some tray thing are all that compose the lab i was expecting more but true to form this mars mission set has no impressive interior to speak of there is a lot of space though so it shouldnt be hard to mod phew the lab folds up like so pretty simple and would allow access to the lab if there was one and then we have this thing what is it defense laser communications array satellite tv the modules connect like so sorry out of place too bad the pins stick out various pics as you can see this thing has more of those bars than an att commercial there you understand the topic description now  the rear it uses a white city plane wing for thewings when i first saw the prototype pics i thought they slanted downwards that wouldve been really cool ah now to the platform from the position of the drill i think this could be a really cool turret location when i mod it to more military space back to the bars if we had space monkeys theyd love this this set has more bars than a jungle gym  here we see the button that drops the platform pretty clever and its not in the way best of all it really works really well actually good job tlc 2 more bars and a shooter mechanism jeeze this is really setting itself up for a joke a shooter mechanism walks into a bar never mind here we have the handle that allows you to pick it up safely a good idea but its placed waaaay to far back way off the center of balance you have to hold on to it pretty well to keep it angled up though it does stop your hands from getting in the way of the platform ah the platform in action this is really a neat little feature not only can the ship land in a reduced footprint but it also prevents the nice white paint job from getting red dust all over it its centered pretty well too and you dont have to worry about knocking it over just dont shove it back at all here we have the latch when the button on top is pushed this gets pulled inward which pulls out of this hole and allows it to swing neatly down good luck and happy mining again sorry for the lack of inprogress review i wouldve liked to take pics of the mechanism and so on but typical of the mm sets you cant really take it apart well this is really a nice set which can hopefully be upgraded with a better lab with little difficulty some of my military mod plans include strip the lab and install a command center get rid of lots of bars the thing has more bars than alcatraz install some turrets this is a big command ship so why all the forwardfacing weapons itll need some aa defense mod the landing platform to be a troop dropper with installable aa turret mod the cockpit pods to be more aerodymic so thats all folks shall i include one last bar joke	neutral
i appreciate your review mr mandalorian but why the negativity id try to find more positives about the set instead of kinda criticizing it after each picture i personally think it looks freakin awesome the size is very impresive and i nearly fell of my chair when i saw the first pics earlier this year its quite unlike anything ive ever seen from lego edited by radiant7 04 june 2008  0827 am	positive
thanks for the review mr mandalorian this is an er interesting set lots of frontal firepower very big too and i like the idea of those two little craft that attach on the sides sort of like little escape pod things anywho not one of the things on my to buy list but i do like that radioactive sticker that could come in use looking forward to seeing your modifications too peace	positive
thanks for the great and very detailed review i love the new holostickers im still not sold on this set though im not sure why i think its the big wing piece and the tootechnicy build from looking at the instructions the platform seems kind of out of place and for the size of the set the functionality doesnt seem as good as it could be it reminds me of 7699 armored drilling unit  looks impressive but doesnt seem to do that much i do think mars mission has improved this year though bar none this is the weakest of the new mm sets i think	negative
mr mandalorian on jun 4 2008 0119 am said and then we have this thing what is it defense laser communications array satellite tv that certainly feels like an homage to the deep freeze defender which itself feels like an homage to the galaxy commander is there some way to centre one of the cockpit units without massive de and re construction	neutral
thanks for the review mr mandalorian the alien craft is a bit small in my opinion could have done with being just a little bit larger the main craft however despite its few minor flaws looks very good while space isn’t my normal theme i’m certainly being tempted this year	positive
iron moose on jun 4 2008 0234 am said that certainly feels like an homage to the deep freeze defender which itself feels like an homage to the galaxy commander thats the observation i had when i saw the first pictures of this set online a few months ago i am a proud owner of the 6973 deep freeze defender and 6980 galaxy commander so im looking forward to see how the 7644 stacks up next to them there is a definite lineage here and these sets clearly demonstrate the evolution of lego set design over the years the mx81 may not have the most playability out of all the new mm sets although it has alot from what i can tell but its hard to beat the look of a large sleek space cruiser sitting on your shelf or dresser at least for myself anyhow this is my first post to the forum and hope my welcome wont wear out here anytime soon edited by spacefan 04 june 2008  0643 pm	positive
thanks for the review i have to concede this does appear to be the weakest set of the summer mm lineup ive noticed a trend that the larger sets have plenty of parts potential but when assembled the model is not more than the sum of the parts eagle base certainly didnt seem worth the asking price at least this is one large model on a positive note the lame aero tubes darts and martian carrier pods have disappeared dont get me wrong i love mm and most of the lineup is great this one just seems to fall a little short of the bar	neutral
i dont understand why theres so much negativity this is actually my favorite of the new mm sets the finished look is very sleek and not very gappy at all the deployable landing pad is great and itll make it easy to put on a shelf without taking too much room lots of greebles although i will concede that its just begging to be modded still though im definitely buying this one  it has a really great look to it	positive

great review mr boba fett i really like this set a lot some of the features may not be as good as i hoped they would but overall this looks to be a really nice set im so happy that the giant spacecrafts are finally back quote ive noticed a trend that the larger sets have plenty of parts potential but when assembled the model is not more than the sum of the parts eagle base certainly didnt seem worth the asking price at least this is one large model on a positive note the lame aero tubes darts and martian carrier pods have disappeared hm actually i dont see the comparison eagle base looked terible to me right from the start so it was no suprise when it ended up being the weakest kit in the first year this big ship on the other hand looked great as soon as i saw it and still looks good	positive
iron moose on jun 4 2008 0215 pm said do tell im being curious not confrontational  well first and foremost like many other people im no fan of those dreaded unprinted minifig torsos and stickers but also the cost to piece ratio of the set it just seems too expensive for everything that you get such as too many small parts and a lighter than usual piece count for the price though if it had included printed minifigs and other elements i maybe would of been able to swallow its 100 usd cost a little easier but star justice is still lego space in the most classic sense thats available today and i will probably pony it up just because anyway i hope were not breaking forum protocol by not discussing the 7644 review of the original poster or that particular set in general	neutral

thanks for the review i actually quite like this i cant afford it so im not getting too attached to it but in its own way its great its certainly reminiscent of space sets of the past as others have said and the dropdown ramp section is just really cool as an idea you understand sure the lab is a little crap but at least the effort was made sort of  the sheer fact that its so big though really makes me like this theres just something appealing about large spaceships not capital ships just big space ships with lots of guns spacefan on jun 4 2008 1034 pm said anyway i hope were not breaking forum protocol by not discussing the 7644 review of the original poster or that particular set in general hey its no worse than batbrick and i no really it isnt even in the same league	positive
thank you for that nice review mr mandalorian wow somehow it´s almost like classic space´s back indeed it´s a great star ship it looks stream lined original and impressive and even the huge plane wing part looks rather cool and smooth on it it´s equipped at least with some kind of engines on top of the wings and although they´re made with only two a little juniorized parts it´s better than nothing there´s a lab or some sort of engine room with enough space inside to allow one or two mfs to play scotty yeah the two cockpits´re nicely detailed with a cool use of these orange 1x1 round plates and to detach one or all two of them reminds a lot of the playability of the good old space sets it seems even like it´s easy to attach them to some kind of cloud city twinpod car thanks these hinged wings looks like some solid fun to me of course the cockpits aren´t airtight and even this reminds unfortunately of the post blue grey and trans yellow era of cs anyway there´s no real fun without some moding i guess another great advantage of the set´s that it´s not overpacked with shooting things one technic shooter cool in grey and only one trans orange prison pod too well i can surely live with that especially since it´s nicely asymmetrical the drill rover´s very charming a little like a rebuilt oldsmobile convertibe stranded on mars sweet and that platform feature´s plain nifty and well done too very playable and useable for a lot of things hmm recently i complained a lot about the dense use of studless technic beams for the inner structure of vehicles like these exoforce tanks par exemple which makes moding in an economical way pretty frustrating but the beams here´re used in a very proper way it should be fairly easy to mod let´s say the back of that lab section up to perhaps even the cockpits to create a larger airtight area that could be boarded from the platform just to fit this certain spacers need for um realism there´re many more nice details too like that satelite tv thingy and that cylinder with trans blue 2x2 dish for the knob or these cylinders with cones on that handle and that alien craft´s pretty nice and detailed as well like i said before i really feel like classic space´s back	positive

guys thanks for your kind comments i am glad that you have enjoyed this review for this set i think i bought about 7 to 8 sets all for the griffins its used for my griffin riders in my castle collection now the green and brown parts come in very handy for castle mocs too imperialshadows on jun 9 2008 1113 pm said a very nice little review of a pretty nice little set that i wish id bought between 1 and 10 of just for the griffin oh well your review has shown me that its useful for more than just that so maybe ill try to pick one up someday cant have too many black capes books or printed things speaking of which the gray thing is technically a plume like any castle plume except in this case its a feather presumably from the griffin and made from the mold to the old indian feathers in the wild west sets its a case of an old part coming back for a slightly new use in a new colour beyond that the stone print tile is a bundle or rolled up blanket or package depending on where its used i dont think its ever meant to be a stone it was used as a rolled up pack on the back of the star wars speederbikes for example nice pics plenty of useful information id give this review an a thanks for doing it i am very happy that you enjoyed and find my review useful thanks for enlighten me now i know where is the origin of that gray plume i wonder if i can use it to match with my castle knights as its plume in addition i mistook the rolled up pack as the stone print tile why didnt i think of it i must have overlook it and used it as a stone tile instead nevertheless i am glad you have give me some good insights on the parts that i am not familar with sveltecorps on jun 10 2008 1049 am said thanks for the nice review  it was one of the first ones i got when emerging from my dark ages  i bought two of these just for buckbeack  i thought he would make a good statue in a persian temple type moc i also liked the minifig head pumpkin and plant part in bright green  both new pieces to me at the time all in all it was a good castle or forest building set with a nice selection of pieces for rocks grass plants and trees the dark bley plume piece also now appears in the 10185 green grocer set as detailing on the roof of the turret i never thought of using buckbeak as a statue for worship i find this concept very interesting yes i agreed that this set offers new parts at that time personally i pretty like the green plant good for any kind of terrain settings i did not realise that the dark bley plume piece appear in the green grocer thanks for pointing out edited by whitefang 10 june 2008  0339 am	positive
great review nice set for plants huh too bad i didnt get thus set but luckily my neighbor did that griffin is nice for castle mocs and that orange head pumpkin i know seems rare to me not much else to say	positive
mr spielbrick on jun 11 2008 0428 pm said ohhh great idea to review the old potter sets especially the line from prisoner of azkaban i was in my dark ages then luckily i was able to catch up on the missed figs with one internet order this draco is the best tlc has made if you ask me the new one also doubling for belloq and guards in the indy line doesnt look quite as hautain as this one buckbeak looks cool looks like his neckhead can be moved right rather similar to lego horses well designed the orange brick doesnt have a pumpkin face on it right unlike the one from philosophers stone in the set with the troll im looking forward to more reviews by you sir whitefang good work no printed face on the pumpkin since the event didnt happen on or near halloween unlike the whole troll situation i also agree that this draco is the best one the new one looks too much like a draco from the oldr films when he smirked a lot more but since very character got a redesignthey had to tune him up even if it meant changigng him for the worse	neutral
guys thanks for your comments glad you find this review useful and be sure to watch out for more old sets reviews mr spielbrick on jun 12 2008 1228 am said this draco is the best tlc has made if you ask me the new one also doubling for belloq and guards in the indy line doesnt look quite as hautain as this one buckbeak looks cool looks like his neckhead can be moved right rather similar to lego horses well designed mr spielbrick thanks for pointing out some important highlights for the review i have overlooked it earlier i strongly agreed with you that this draco is the best tlc made i pretty like the face compared to others furthermore i used my multiple dracos for my castle armor guards instead one could not have too many dracos buckbeak design is well made the head can be moved upwards and downwards the mechanism is similar to the horse design in addition buckbeak wings can be removed similar to the typical green or black dragon wings that we used to see in the past well the main reason for me to buy this set was in fact buckbeak you dont often find a griffin lying around except in harry potter sets mr spielbrick on jun 12 2008 1228 am said the orange brick doesnt have a pumpkin face on it right unlike the one from philosophers stone in the set with the troll sorry to said there is no print on that pumpkin face its pure orange	positive
i bought about 5 or 6 of these sets when they were on sale in mid 2006 i still have a few of them laying around unopened i think i payed like under 5 for each and thats a great deal for all the variety of neat parts you get with this set	positive
nice review i like the treemaking pieces the most of this not very expensive set the buckbeak fig is very nice and can bow his head like the horses i was annoyed to get another draco without some other not made figs pansy parkinson for example about the dark bley feathers in the second version of hogwarts there were several of these feathers put in little 1x1 cones like it was a feather to write with it i bought 2 sets of these and when they were for sale i just bought  6 more of it only annoying that i had then even a bigger army of dracos	neutral
i see a lot of good reviews on this site but this one is superb good job tom	neutral
hello eb yes im cranking out the reviews the other day i picked up this gem for an okay sales price at devonport tas while searching for the new batsets i informed iamded of this as he is a spideysuckup   and he informed me this was the only set he didnt have of the wave 2 of this theme so i ask you great eb members to please remind him of this when commenting here we go with the review of doctopus lair anyway unlike other reviews this stars more people the batbrickiamdeddragonatordaisy review daisy is the mouse that came in the set first up re the figs and i must say they are great i love fleshies and these are excellent to expand my batman world plus having a spiderman to beat up is good too doctopus is great though his tentacles are annoying to keep in order peter parker is a nice addition i love that torso eve though harry osborn was totally absent from this scene i welcome him as he is a good fig also best of all is mary jane fleshie females are hard to come by and i love that hair my very first one oh and even better is bley daisy on the far right another fantastic thing is that by mixing mj with doctopus you get a far more deadly and real villain than anyone couldve forseen  the hippy oh cmon tell me that aint cool anyhoo here is a pic of doctopus showing his might random fact did you know i influence both dragonator and iamded in their sigfigs dragonator adapts his from my ia series while iamded added mutt hair when i had him like that in a pic i posted now onto the box sorry about the lighting the art is good and the cartoon spidey in the corner may have beenthe inspiration for a similar style in the new batsets back of the box again sorry about the lighting and blur it was gtting late and these were the last pics finally we get to the first part of the set the catapult is that movie accurate or what i love the part in sm2 when he uses his homemade genetic spider powered catapult to launch himself to the scene oh well it does comes with a cool spider web an trans blue spider so it gets some points and it is really fun i launched spidey several metres once i dont think he ever recovered infact he almost certainly webbed himself slightly cooler extras are these two this awesome little boat is great for city as is the simple but nice bouy daisy approves naturally dragonator ruins everything when he found out the dragon that would be riding with him was our nickname for daisy now finally the main attraction  coctopus dock iamded and i threw dragonator in the water to see if he could swim he er couldnt one sweeney todd later we continue the overall construction of the building is very good i know a lot of people hated stickers and i hated applying these but they do look spectacular and perfect for any city setting like a bank a gotham bank as iamded has already noted below me the black lifesavers a very cool as are the web piece and log pieces the inside contains the neutron copperplate triple bypass humdrum holy hum 5000 which does does see movie anyhoo it is very cool and includes a little control thingy on the yellow brick next to it unfortunately the inside is plain but for that the other side has no wall too which is a bit of a letdown really but atleast it allows daisy easy access one gripe is those yellow 1x1 bricks they serve no purpose and break up the colour scheme better shot of the thingy thing i quite like it the use of technic parts actually works and the whole set is worth it for those purple flames and dishes alone it closes up pretty well too unable to hit the dish which is a nice feature me and iamded liked it so much we threw a revived dragonator into it unfortunately it disagreed with him but it was fun another shot of the dock i like how they have gaps in the jetty i know the movie version was pretty wack and although the set isnt very faithful to it looks more like a seaside library to be frank it still is very nice this is my first large blue baseplate too which is wonderful though funny how the set only uses about half of it the roof is a well designed and fun feature it uses some technic connections to render it flexible of any degree as you can see here by my opening of it better shot of the roof design it can lie flat or at any angle i might use the design myself in the future as much as i love the building this feature bugs me for in order for it to work this wall has to stick out which not only looks ugly but makes you be able to see through the corners still easily modded and log pieces are fantastic for mocing it also means that there are 7 windows all up for a good sizeable building by pulling out the piece in the center the walls both collapss sideways outwards which is actually pretty fun and works everytime overall view of the set including characters now for the story that makes no senseat all spiderman is dead after falling down the wall mechanism see above only daisy can save the day for dragonator is being held by the evil doctopus and iamded and dragonator are too busy not caring and brainbox is too busy complaining that this goes against all marvel continuity unfortunately daisy is on a lunchbreak so tough luck dragonator and daisy goes on a search for fortune and glory okay this is what i think of the set build 35  fun but those stickers ruin the experience somewhat and if you dont apply them the instructions are a bit hard to follow playability 45  great little gizmos and bits not the kind that keep you going like with the 2007 aquabase but good fun still design 45  not very movie faithful no but still a great little building and a smart design for certain aspects minifigs 55  great figs with all different faces and very useful bits price 25 far far overpriced even on sale sadly total 1825  a good set that couldve been better with a few minor changes nothing wrong with it but it doesnt really cross the line to greatness that said it has a lot going for it and definitely worth buying or atleast a look

thanks for the review even if it is a number of years late i picked this up whn it came out and thought it was a rather cool set besides the catapult plenty of cool pieces and the baseplate has found a use in the batcave although i think my dad managed to spill some beer on it at one point that was awful to clean off batbrick on jun 13 2008 1044 am said and brainbox is too busy complaining that this goes against all marvel continuity i wasnt expecting that there i was casually scrolling down when i stumbled onto a picture of me	positive

i picked up this set mainly because of the many 5spare glow in the dark parts and the promise of 2 racers and one helicopter for the price of a little more than two racers 90kr vs 2x40kr the box the back of the box shows the two alternate models you can build if the polybags rip there are 3 cheese slopes and two 1x2 tiles that glow in the dark where the tiles are exclusive for this set the total parts count is high at 142 but there are no really big pieces among them inside the box you will find the building instructions a sheet with some odd sticky labels thrown away and 3 polybags marked by the bag building difficulty the models the lime colored car doesnt bring out anything new we have seen racers built like that before but it does contain some nice bricks for the collection the police cruiser surprises with an interesting design along the sides as seen here it is harder to build because of the greater level of details the helicopter is without doubt the hardest vehicle to build in a bag i cant finish it because its larger than the bag you cant put on the top blades nor the tail of the thing so it beats the forklift from 7733 where the top bar is the new kind that doesnt completely fit there is also instructions for the alternate models but it requires the bags to be opened the vehicles are pretty standard for the racers theme with the police car being the highlight of the set conclusion i like the difficulty curve between bag 1 and 2 but the last bag should be labeled 1000000 instead of 3 it requires some inhuman skills to build that helicopter in the bag  lime colored car 3  we have seen it before but it has some nice pieces and lime police cruiser 9  it has a massive diffusers rare parts and a high level of details it is a shame lego relies so much on stickers helicopter 6  if you see it as a set for one fourth of the price of the cars it is quite amazing but you cant bag build it and i would personally prefer some more detail instead of the big size overall it is a nice little set but the police car is the main attraction i wouldnt get the other vehicles if they were sold separately brickshelf gallery edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0703 pm indexed	negative

adiksalego on jun 17 2008 1002 am said now now dont judge people who do this there have been bigger sets that were done in the bag to each his own  you make it sound like i did something deeply socially deviating like being an adult playing with lego but back on topic open the bags if they were meant to be opened why did lego close them in the first place bag building is not for everybody some might become very frustrated with it and let their anger out on the set by lining it up on a mini golf course	neutral

seeming as there were no reviews of this set in the index i have uploaded mine from jabbas hutt  here is my review for lego set 10178 motorized walking atat because i live in the uk i got this set with 6 free duracell batteries which was great its just twice as expensive as the us heres the basic set that is from the instructions this is the cockpit but please note after i took this photo i realised it was slightly built wrong heres one of the feet in proportion to a minifig to give you a general size this is luke skywalker swinging on a wire trying to destroy the atat i really wish lego didnt make so many lukes because i want differnt minifigs it would also be nice for a thermal detonator piece underneath the atat you can see the shaft that moves the back legs the motor and squeezed in on the righ t the massive battery box a load of cogs that move the legs these are the included figures snowtrooper general maximilian veers atat driverpilot or whatever you want to call him and luke all whithout there wepons please note veers should have a dark stone snowtroooper torso with 4 red and blue badge things not 3 these are the figures with weapons i gave them and the included ones snowtrooper has new style blaster veers has standard light grey pistol like the ones from the old adventure sets atat driver has old style blaster which i call heavy blaster and luke has shiny handle blue light sabre  the shiny blue light sabre was included with the set which is a bonus because i really dont like the grey ones httpwwwbrickshelsc00521jpgjpg this is the switch which is attached to the battery box on either side of the atat underneath the lift up side panels you push the forward to walk forward and backward to walk backwards simple eh  a front veiw with the the panels open here are the drivers controls which are simply a cotrol panel and 2 exoforce robot hands which are joystick things seen in the film if you look closley the almost useless carry handle this is the weird back piece looking down the atat from the back where you can see the the battery box and switch troops decending from ropes and cables and vader leading the assult for this i hadnt got any more imps so i used clones pilots i now have a whole load more snowtroopers solo and chewie sabotaging more troops to squash rebel scum huzahh a very bad picture of everyone packed up inside the size incomparison to its predecessor overall i would give this set 910 because it should come with more snowtroopers or it could be and endor version with loads of strormies and scout troopers aswell as this you can really sit any one down because of the battery box but i stilll find space to put all the shown figures on this review in the interior as you can see on the above image the chains and ropes are hanging down a bit tjis set is now limited to 5 per customer in the uk and now no longer comes with free batteries the walking on this is a bit wonky and dosent really walk like they do in the film as it moves two legs at a time i am currently attaching a motor to the head to make it move independently	negative

great review indexing it as i write this how come you think the ctt is the atats predecessor do you mean the motorized atat or atats in general i think this is a great set and i am very fond of mine its one of the few sw sets of mine that is on parade at all times most are packed away in the attic kimt btw its not alone the older version of the atat is keeping it company	positive

thanks for the review kimt  it comes at a confusing time you can take off the top disk and lift it like the millennium falcon from the top now i actually dont like this set that much it takes about 5 hours and 15 minutes to build if you do it in one go but the repeating sections makes this built the most tedious i have experienced it has way too many holes from which you can see the colorful skeleton and is overpriced compared to the older 10030 isd i remember thinking it was too expensive when it was 50 off at sh even the snowspeeder was kewler to less than half the price	negative
hmmm ive still got this set and i must say i think you did a good job of reviewing it but overall i hate the set probably the worst ucs set so far apart from the naboo fighter but that hardly even counts as ucs from my experience unless you really really want it and have nothing better to spent your  on in that case go for it but in my case it was a very repetitive build and final model was quite well bland not must variety to it if you know what i meanfor the price i would really reccomend the ucs star destroyer because thats a much better story	negative
even though i never liked ucs i absolutley hate this one sure its great on display but the build looks extremley boring to me just stacking plate after plate and as you said its going to break a little if you touch it the only intersting part for me is the firing laser although i do have to say the proce isnt too bad i still wouldt buy it and no minifigs so thanks for the review but ill pass on this one the new minifig scale ds looks awesome though and this might have hyped some up who are buying the new ds	negative
grevious on jun 24 2008 1012 pm said thanks for the review eh honestly i though this was awful ever since i first saw the pictures to me an incomplete grey ball doesnt really work as a special ucs kit for the sole reason that its boring extremely so now the new death star playset is a whole different story they should have done that in the first place theres nothing to add to grevious post thanks but i never like the big grey ball benny	negative

i think its a very weird and boring ucs set but what a lot of grey plates you could build something much better out of them but it would be fairly flat it looks very fragile though  my ucs atst is edited by shoc 25 june 2008  1028 am	negative
i also dont feel this is a very good set but is that old grey in which case it would be a nice part pack dr brick	negative
the build was a bit boring and i suppose a big grey ball isnt all that interesting but since the death star ii in the movie is a big grey ball too i dont see the problem i didnt think it was particularly fragile i dont care about minifigs or playability either a few plusses in my opinion it looked pretty damn impressive sitting in my lego room and the construction is really clever all in all i actually liked this one but perhaps i have a different expectation of sets than most of you sets are mainly parts packs and would you look at the quantity of grey plate in this thing its new grey btw i paid half price for it at shophome uk which is still a lot more than half price from the us and i didnt regret it for a second cheers ralph	negative
lasse d on jun 25 2008 0604 pm said here are some advantages that makes isd win for me  a lot more fun to build with less repetitions  it is easier to build alternate models from it how many alternate models of the ds2 have you seen  the bricks are more varied  you get magnets  it is a larger set if you look at the size  its more intresting to look at  its got more variety of nooks and crannys	positive
id love to get my hands on one of these but youd need about three jobs to justify the prices of this guy on ebay fantastic review kimt	neutral
kimt on jun 24 2008 0322 pm said 4 zero swooshability i think its very swooshable assuming you swoosh it at the same speed it moves in the movie d while i would never do something like this i bet if you packed this sucker with a bunch of m80 firecrackers it would make for a fantastic end to a stop motion movie with it being as delicate as you say it is i bet you wouldnt destroy any parts edited by gotoandlego 03 april 2010  0257 pm	positive
dang so much negativity on a such spectacular set this baby provides an amazing backdrop to any lego inspired star wars diorama and lets face it lego tends to be a rectangular brick and somehow we now have a sphere guys its a ucs it accurately depicts the on screen icon and put plain and simple is a wonderful sculptural piece of work in its own right i agree with kimt in that the removal of the laser and super star destroyer gives it more authenticity but to call it a gray golf ball or ignore its inherent accuracy is simply to miss the point it proved to be the best build to share with someone be it family or friend due to its repeated sections and impressive finish its a clever build and to criticize it for lack of playability or i suspect for many its absence of minifigs is just absurd and possibly why lego has not released a proper ucs in nearly two years i reckon many out there would love a ucs tyderium imperial walker or slave 1 with a spectacular piece count be it minifig scale or just darn impressive in its own right sadly for those who love these sculptural masterpieces were stuck with simple toys with play features and cute minifigs clever in their own right but lacking the clout and purity of the old ucs line lets hope some diversity of product is just around the corner else 10179 was the last of the truly brave financial gambles of the star wars line	positive
neoconagenda on 24 june 2015  1129 pm said i decided to reread this review because i just got this set today i dont really have a concern over the design or repeating build process because owning this set was never an option for me as i collect ucs sets but i am surprised to see an almost total lack of positive posts i really hope that i enjoy this build hi you may find this thread interesting i really enjoyed bricklinking it	neutral
ive just ordered the bits for this from bricklink im awaiting the final order now so im interested in these comments i can see that since ill be building it with the kids ill have to plan in plenty of breaks and do lots of parallel building to keep us all from getting bored	positive
you should have posted the entire review up i am about to look at the gallery for the rest of the pics edit as soon as i post the images came thats weird nice review is there more it says ill be back good first review edited by skipper 24 26 june 2008  0911 pm	neutral

its all good buti know you expected a but  its a rat	positive
thanks for the review bearing in mind that the whole point of this set is to get a cheap troll warrior i actually quite like it the cart isnt brilliant but for 13 pieces its not that bad the troll fig is great as always and i guess the rats are always nice to get not so much in real life though the sets that contain the trolls have a fairly solid number each i mean tower raid has three but nevertheless i think i may have to pick up a few of these whitefang on jul 2 2008 0249 pm said in addition the flick missile really works use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it the missile will fly well it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature the trolls hands are going to get quite sore then arent they	positive
trooperdavinfelth on jul 2 2008 0315 pm said its all good buti know you expected a but  its a rat or maybe a very large mouse	neutral
its a good review but you forgot another thing the troll needs a shiled like they used to in the 2007 castle line the sets always had shields for the minifigs and it could be better if it was 300 instead of 350 but yes it is a good impulse great army builder	positive
very good nice to see how its all played out nice review	positive
ah sweet thanks for the review whitefang i hope this set shows up in nz soon i cant wait to get my hands on it troll warrior on peace	positive
hey your review is great as usual as for the set itself  well its an impulse set after all  small and cheap nothing special well the rat is special hehe for me the rat is the most interesting in the set cause i dont have a rat i dont have a troll warrior either but im not very interested	neutral

whitefang on jul 3 2008 0406 am said i thought by calling it as a mouse it will be a little much friendly unlike calling it a rat why is mouse friendlier than rat	neutral
whitefang on jul 4 2008 0543 pm said well mouse sounded more friendly because it can associate with tom and jerry but calling it a rat equal calling it a pest its just a matter of putting it in different terms thats all the thing i dont get is how jerry is friendly	neutral
thank you for the review the set is nice i didnt need the flickfire missiles and would have rather a orctrol shield instead but i think i will pick one up	positive
hello all eurobricks members i will be doing a continuation of my impulse set reviews i was pretty excited when i laid my hands on these new impulse sets yesterday hope to give most of you a good insight for this set name street cleaner theme lego system  town  city year 2008 pieces 22 minifigs 1 an image of a 5620 street cleaner let the cleaning begin the street cleaner has a job to do it is to clean the rubbish on the streets after a new year countdown it seemed the cleaning agency have a new equipment to use its not as big as the previous street sweeper machine the cleaner will need to operate the equipment manually by pushing it look at the mess after sorting out look at the pieces offered its not a very complicated set since its an impulse set there are some pretty useful parts lying around such as the broom spade however i was quite surprised when i could not find the lid of the rubbish bin i cant used this rubbish bin to place it around my town without a lid on top of it i believed it is not a norm by not including the lid look at that bin well that rubbish bin seem to be containing his equipment in it instead of the rubbish the cleaners face looks pretty sad i think he wants to have a change of job front view i love that blue brush very much quite fun to play with especially pushing the rubbish aside thats why a spade is there to help him to dig out the litter and the broom to brush it away ok now i know why his face looks so sad where is that street sweeper machine summary review playability 6510 not bad to play with design 7510 the design is relatively interesting with the use of the technic part to be its foundation price 810 an inexpensive set to get another cleaner and some neat accessories overall 710 not a bad set after all pretty average but still quite good to buy if your towns required more cleaners hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelfwhen moderated edited by whitefang 04 july 2008  0344 pm	positive
thanks for the review  not a bad price of course its impulse for a fig a little cleaner thing and two accesories the brush fig and spade i dont have yet so i might just pick this up	positive
looking at this is making me want to build one of the favourite sets of my childhood 6649 street sweeper might do that today actually cheap good pieces despite the lack of a bin lid thats just inviting disaster isnt it nice fig and one of those blue brushes which ive always loved but never managed to use thanks whitefang	positive
glad you guys like the review brainbox on jul 3 2008 0619 pm said looking at this is making me want to build one of the favourite sets of my childhood 6649 street sweeper might do that today actually cheap good pieces despite the lack of a bin lid thats just inviting disaster isnt it nice fig and one of those blue brushes which ive always loved but never managed to use the 6649 looks lovely and i hope you managed to restore it indeed a bin without a lid is inviting trouble	positive
thank you for the nice review this set looks good i have too many of the blue sweepthings but the fig is nice and i didnt have this face so i will pick up one some day	positive
wow what a great little impulse set i relly dig the face as well as a chance to get some cool accessories like a broom bin no lidsigh and a mushroom top hat a really nice review and story too whitefang i think this guy will be joining my set of lego when he shows up in australia cheers isc	positive
thanks for the review poor little minifig this guy has to haul the heavy machine all the way from the depot onto the littered streets to locate some trash but when he has finally found some and switches on the machine everything will be launched towards his pants no wonder hes looking sad a nice set though and inventive too when it comes to streetsweepers i remember getting the first of its kind on my birthday in 1991	positive
hello all eurobricks members i will be doing a continuation of my impulse set reviews this will be the third review at a go hope everyone of you will find this review useful in a way name coast guard kayak theme lego system  town  city year 2008 pieces 21 minifigs 1 an image of a 5621 coast guard kayak roll roll roll your boat it seemed the coast guard has a kayak of his own roaming in the sea making sure that swimmers will be safe in the beach now i am illustrating him as a life guard instead this set is simply wonderful among the 4 new impulse sets coast guard kayak is the best looking set in my opnion the kayak design is very simple but looks realistic  furthermore if you dont need it to be a coast guard kind of stuff use it as a leisure water spot instead down in the marina i will think any lego citizen will love to have some water spot in their busy life so come down here and wind down with this new sport bits and pieces kayak and the bouy the bouy is very useful to position it at the coast of your water to highlight the boundaries in the sea and warning incoming ships or vessels oh i did not make it tilted purposely there is a white round base which allow it to tilt on both ends useful parts these parts are useful to add on in your city somehow when i see that red cone i can use it as a police stop to inspect vehicles on the road or form a barricade with it the bouy base shape is unique too i like it very much it is great to attached it by the side of the boat as a life bouy the coast guards life vest and helmet are very useful for water activites the life vest was produced in past sets and now it resurfaced again i am glad these vests made their way back a look of him without the life vest summary review playability 7510 fun to play with especially the bouy when you see it moving up and down design 8510 design is simple but straight to the point especially the kayak design price 810 an inexpensive set to get more coast guards and more kayaks overall 8510 a very good set to have in your lego town the kayak is simply so lovely to me hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated	positive

one of the better impulse sets imo	positive
thanks for pics the hawk it seems to me lacks a cockpit theres not even a seat to keep the pilot from falling off perhaps it theyd redesigned it to be a backpack jetpack sort of unit using similar pieces itd at least make some sense based on the other mm impluses can we assume this goes for 35usd at that price it seems to me that the astro fighter at 5usd was already a superior impluse set guess id buy one on clearance for the minifig	neutral
thanks for another review whitefang this is quite a nice set actually it evokes some of the design elements of the mx11 while looking different enough to justify me buying it the head on the astronaut is one i like so even better i hadnt realised it was that one actually does 26 pieces make it one of the bigger impulses sets i think i may have to get one if not two plus its called crystal hawk how can that not be considered cool	positive

i like this one aswell it has a couple of parts i need for an moc train locomotive and i dont have any of those space guys yet and a double faced guy is always a winner in my book	positive
thanks for another great review i definitely like this set sure the interior might be a bit bare but i think that the outside of the base with all of the great lava and rocks more than makes up for it it is a bit weird that on the one side there is nothing on the inside but thats easy to fix anyone know when this will be out in the us thanks again for the fantastic review	positive
honestly im too much of a space fan to be interested in this set id rather have the sub good review though d	negative

ill be honest  i dont like this ship at all its one of my least favourite ships in the pt and i have to yet buy either one of those sets i also found it funny that this set was meant to be a walmart exclusive yet never appeared on the shelves at my walmart anyhow thanks for the review	negative
led zeppelin on jul 10 2008 0446 pm said youre supposed to slide the front of the hull off rather than lift the top piece off yeah i was looking at the construction booklet and it reminded me of that i forgot about it but that makes it more fragile	neutral

nice review rezourceman i wanted to see one of this set it seems there isnt much to it other than what it looks like in the official pictures but i may well get it i like slime face	neutral
great review rezourceman your pics really show off the sub well and its good to see the build in progress i also have this set but i didnt apply stickers to the sub as i was planning to reuse the nice dark blue pieces however as shown in your review they do brighten it up a fair bit i cant say this is my favourite agents set the boat is a little oddly proportioned and the sub although retro looking has practically no interior and would be difficult to customise to put more in unlike say the clever job batbrick did with the penguin sub in his review the sub kind of looks like some jules verneish sea creature  i would have liked it if theyd gone all the way and made it some kind of giant robot jellyfish or squid i do agree with you about slime face  he has a fantastic torso with all the slime dripping down which is a bit obscured by the air tank its really encouraging that in the last 2 missions weve had great extra villains added in the only thing i would add about the octopus is that the glow in the dark plastic is mixed in unevenly with the aqua blue so it doesnt glow in the dark evenly  its kind of like the mars mission jellies in that respect though much cooler thanks again for the great review	negative
sveltecorps on jul 11 2008 0914 am said i would have liked it if theyd gone all the way and made it some kind of giant robot jellyfish or squid coughalphateamcough anyway i was about to reply earlier and say  great review svelte then i realised it was not you nice reveiw anyway the only reason i would get this set would be if i got all the other agents sets  all the sw cw sets  all the pieces i need on bl  all the new city ect setsthen i would think about geting it	neutral
darthlegois on jul 11 2008 1028 am said color0000ff coughalphateamcough id forgotten about ogels mutant vehicles i guess i meant a bigger cross between the 8636 sub and the big squid from 7775 aquabase invasion  that is such a great design sort of keep the retro feel but make it bigger with the 8636 sub theres really only room for one agent to sit and despite its size theres just a few not amazingly great functions such as the hidden chest and missiles	positive

aside from the price i love this set when i saw the prelim pics of agetns i did not like the theme but all the sets are starting to look more attractive now i can see the cool features and details as for this set i really like the badguy boat for some reason and the submarine looks good  i love the dark blue colour	positive
batbrick on jul 19 2008 0953 am said is it impossible or just very hard to mod nothing is impossible to mod probably the easiest part to change would be the front where the missiles are and the treasure chest slides out  you could make a sizeable compartment there however the middle section is so narrow and the end fins are just that  fins  that it might be harder to expand without changing the shape of the sub youll find out soon when yours arrives batbrick on jul 19 2008 0953 am said the octopus sounds great thanks for that is he meant to be on any side im guessing hes a mutant inferno creature about slime face is his head much different to the joker bombs i know he has slime marks on his head are they very apparent its not really clear but since all the other mutants are evil or at least controlled by dr inferno its probably a safe bet the squid is too slime faces head is different to the joker bombs  different eyes and teeth although the smile is similar i guess and the slime marks are much more apparent in the flesh or abs although they dont photograph that way joker bomb face below for contrast	neutral

6927 all terrain vehicle year released 1981 piece count 167 minifigs 2 list price 1450 a very unique vehicle in the classic space collection was this allterrain vehicle which i always considered more along the line of a mobile lab the set introducedinfused white and black bricks with classic blue space pieces the result was this great classic vehicle the set includes two figs still red and white heres a view of the vehicle which is really two components the vehicle itself and the lab section i absolutely loved the the blue windshield slopes 2 included and the unique upsidedown large blue slope in the back of the vehicle is the blue lab the back section of the vehicle has hinges that allow the jets sections to open the brick design fits perfectly into the lab and when opened the lab falls to the ground note the little round trans red 1x1s allow the lab to slide up and forward when the jet sections are closed i tried taking off the red 1x1s and the lab does not lift as easily with them the design is very clever esp for a classic set heres a shot of the standalone lab unlike earlier classic space windows this set has train window frames with yellow windows the top of the lab lifts up for playability inside the lab are several computers and a swivel chair back to the vehicle heres a shot of the cockpit with white steering wheel the left side has an upsidedown wrench and black antenna the right side a walkietalkie and another antenna the antennas can be used as breaks to keep the middle wheels from moving heres ashot of the under carriage and a final shot of the complete set for those of you following my classic space reviews this is review number 9 of 10 my final review of anall time favorite will be coming soon hope you enjoyed this review comments are always welcome	positive

thanks for the review this is one of my favorite space sets of all time i even had 2 of them back in the days my only complain about this set was that i found that the wheels where too small  i had some trouble passing the rover over the little cratersmountains of the space plates	positive
this is a great little set i like how it combines two very different color schemes for different parts of the model i have made some slight modifications to mine adding a roof on the vehicle and a back wall on the outpost also those white 1x1 headlight plates at the front are thinner than the modern kind and seem to be quite weak i got this set off ebay a while ago and one of them was broken in shipping even though the set was otherwise in display model condition and the other one broke off while i was building the set i replaced them with the newer variety mutex on jul 10 2008 1137 pm said my only complain about this set was that i found that the wheels where too small  i had some trouble passing the rover over the little cratersmountains of the space plates the only bad thing about this set is the name it cant even roll over a single plates height not very all terrain at all edited by cp5670 11 july 2008  0743 am	positive
thanks for another informative review of the best lego theme ever and not in attempt to hijack your thread but to add to it heres a pic of my blacktron 1 version of this beautiful set the 6927 has to rate as one of the best 5 classic space sets ever along with 918 6970 and 928	positive
give me an excuse to sneak into your house and let me have a feel of these classic space sets i never had a chance to have any experience with the classic space sets through your recent reviews on these it gave me a wider perspective of space i loved to play space as a child such as the late classic and futuron sets back to the review this 6927 is a great mobile command center vehicle suitable for all kinds of harsh terrain in the unknown space the 6 big wheels are real solid and firm back in those days transparent blue windscreen at the front is wonderful i just love these parts especially when its in blue 4 computer printed tiles arent lego so generous back in those days when printed parts are more commonly available unlike now its a real nice set however there is one thing i dont understand about this design why is the driver seat has a wide back with no cover behind and the command center has no door at the back i understand that these space guys are always carrying their helmet around for oxygen supply i wonder if there is a better answer to it	positive
oh man this review takes me back i got this set when i was 8 years old and loved it i remember modding it to remove the lab in the back and i put in a giant laser cannon instead cause when youre 8 years old everything needs a giant laser cannon cp5670 on jul 11 2008 1243 am said the only bad thing about this set is the name it cant even roll over a single plates height not very all terrain at all ha very true the vehicle is built so low to the ground that the front end catches on everything	positive
quote great buy on this one what did it cost you it was 30 which was a pretty good price given the condition it had no box or instructions though this set is actually fairly common on ebay though considering how old it is i see them pretty frequently on there quote its a real nice set however there is one thing i dont understand about this design why is the driver seat has a wide back with no cover behind and the command center has no door at the back i understand that these space guys are always carrying their helmet around for oxygen supply i wonder if there is a better answer to it i just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed edited by cp5670 11 july 2008  0639 pm	neutral
thebrickster on jul 11 2008 1016 pm said yes the extra space was probably for the oxygen tanks on the figs it makes taking them off a lot easier as for the labcontrol center i never had an issue with it being open i think this was just for playability one could always pretend that some sort of invisible force ray closed the side when activated invisible force fieldray that is a very neat idea i dont have much problem with it either was just curious about the design as i am not very familar with classic space i supposed the oxygen tanks is quite big to carry around especially when the vehicle is so cramped these allowance of space makes them much mobile to move about in the vehicle cp5670 on jul 12 2008 0239 am said i just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed great job thanks for sharing and answering the question i posted above i love the way you modify the front and back now i need to find where is the entrance to the mobile command center	neutral
awesome review brickster i didnt you are also a space fan oh how i love classic space the all time perfect lego space related theme everytime i see one i want to buy them more and more when compared to modern fang dangled sets with detailed figs and cool new accessories they have nothing on classic space simple beauty maybe its the bluegreytrans yellow color scheme classic space forever edited by piranha 30 august 2009  0751 am	positive

i ordered the set via sh and it cost 3499€ in germany 3799€ in belgium and 50 in australia it looks like it´s a exclusive set but without the 2limited edition sticker on the package in the usa it´s not aviable now i think it costs as much as the rocket ride 30  mrs pegleg he has the same short pants like in the other sets	neutral

i recently bought this set for my daughters birthday its the first belville set that ive bought for her so its a bit of an experiment the house is 5 rooms and its made up of mostly large pieces there still is a decent amount of normal lego in it though the doorways in the house align when it is opened out starting with the bathroom included is a shower toilet sink with vanity and a baby potty the mirror sticker is one of the few that i put on the open plan loungekitchendining room is well appointed as well and it has a nice glass table and coffee machine the kitchen chairs are fabuland parts and dont work really well it seems they are having jellyfish for dinner the clock is the only printed part in the set upstairs is a baby room and the master bedroom the radio and the tv not shown were stickers to my disappointment up top is an extra room suitable for reading those antenna things were made from spare parts by my daughter i have no idea what they are supposed to be  there are some stickers that go on the back but i didnt put them on as it is the set looks ok this way but since it is a dolls house it doesnt really matter i do think though that the fireplace should have been given a back the bbq is made from normal parts and is quite effective i think it uses the same light brick thats in the 4998 stegosaurus set my kids were using it as a torch before my grumbling ruined their fun like all belville sets the highlight is arguably the accessories ill be borrowing a few of these from time to time here is the controversial baby catapult as you can see it works ok but lego probably should have tried a bit harder we also bought for her 7583 playful puppy it also comes with some nice accessories but not enough to justify buying unless you want the rest of the parts poor puppy where does he sleep here is my daughter assembling it she made me make the house though as she wanted to play a game we bought her note the lego drink bottles  i didnt take any photos of the figures as they dont seem to be anything new but i can if people want me to at the time i was in bit of a hurry as i took these before bed so i wouldnt be stressed if the kids broke it the next day overall these sets seem overpriced to me and hard to justify unless you actually want a buildable dolls house which we did its still too early to tell if my daughter likes it or not but at this stage it seems she lost interest in a few days she does tend to go back to toys though edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0703 pm indexed	negative

yay its good to see your kids get to build some stuff too sinner  all through the review i was thinking this was a present  but who actually put it together so im glad the last pic cleared things up as for the set  it looks much bigger than i expected  i think it does make a good sized dollhouse there are a stack of nice pieces in there  cupboards oven transblue 2x5 bricks all the accessories plants flowers food the lightup brick the pink roof slopes  but not enough to justify the aud129 retail price maybe on sale id pick it up and resell the belville figs but david jones hasnt even had a regular 20 off lego sale for the whole of this year that ive seen i think the playful puppy set is a horrendous ripoff for aud20 though i agree with the baby catapult  the range is terrible lego just isnt trying any more is it at least theyve moved on from throwing cats off three storey buildings 2 questions though 1 was it a fun build 2 are those large figs anatomically correct under their froufrou finery if not what the hell are they doing in the second pic whilst baby sylvia explores the oven	neutral
excellent review its nice to see how its nice to see how   its nice  okay i cant get over the sex in the bedroom and the unattended baby crawling into the oven i didnt read anything else except where does the puppy sleep and my daughter made me build this you are sick and twisted and thats why i love you it seems you are coining the belville edge now will you please stop sitting around eating clams and get that baby out of the oven or make the fun in the bedroom a threeway please thank you ps ok i read it i want the baby toilet and i think the jellyfish is supposed to be a jellomold i bet you knew that the fireplace lattice look like the harry potter one and not the fabuland one boo wienies when your daughter outgrows it will you turn it into a belleville star wars moc please thank you in advance	positive

great review and i note something like a bucket in the dog set shame its not blue as for the fire place piece i love it and i want one ever since finding it on mlcad i love the bbq it looks so good you know i might even buy this it it was not so pink now as for the kiddies in ovens make sure they are not over cooked they can be stringy  and as for the couple up stairs now we at least know what you do with your mini figs when no one is looking lego sets in public places  just following your name sake i guess and i must say lego shame shame that catapult needs reviwing hardly even make a dent in a castle wall regards cpt pb	positive
i was sort of hoping for a flickfire baby still this looks decent for what it is i guess obviously it really is all about the accessories and its got em but not enough to make me spend that kind of cash and i dont even mind having a pile of pink parts around if you throw in a complete turkey or some birthday cakes its a slam dunk but as it is eh thanks for the review though its very nicely presented and leaves no doubt in my mind as to just how easy this set would be to misuse for other purposes	neutral
the lego lives on but you are one evil parent getting your kids addicted to belville like that but uh whats that doll doing on the bed whats underneath it and look what you found a bucket	neutral
great review sinner i havent seen a bellville set review before i just realised what you meant by fore in the topic subtitle too imperialshadows on jul 12 2008 0931 am said obviously it really is all about the accessories and its got em but not enough to make me spend that kind of cash and i dont even mind having a pile of pink parts around i agree a lot of the pieces are good but i dont think i would get it however i do think i will get the set with the dogs so my minifigs can have giant mutant hounds jimbutcher on jul 12 2008 0645 pm said and look what you found a bucket a bucket in disguise as a watering can	neutral
a nice review with a nice touch of sinner which made me laugh the playfull puppy set has saussages i think i would buy a playfull puppy it has nice pieces and the puppy can also be used for minifigs as a big dog why havent they not made a saussagesseller for city maybe in the future there are already more chickenlegs in minifigs sets	positive

sinner on jul 25 2008 0947 pm said im still undecided on if it was a smart buy she played with it a lot this week but last week she ignored it and i had to fix it twice my daughter is 12 and she still plays with all her belville stuff mostly the fairy princess castle sets if your daughter is anything like mine you will definitely get your moneys worth out of it however  as soon as my daughter says shes done with it i plan on raiding the sets for all those great food and accessory bits patience  great review by the way the belville sets are indeed overpriced but theyre probably legos best attempt at wooing the girl audience i still hate the fact that tlc thinks they need separate boy themes and girl themes but whatever theyre a very nice alternative to barbie  you get posable figures with realistic body proportions plus some creativity and building aspects thrown in	positive
i bought this today mainly because it was 25 off but id been eyeing it for a long time the accessories truly are brilliant theres so much here to be pillaged for other uses as people have said i picked up heaps of new parts ive never had or rare ones in even rarer colours to be honest i was surprised and impressed by the range and versatility of the regular bricks as well when you look at the box art what jumps out at you are the giant pink walls and curved pieces but theres a nice amount of white arches and lime green bricks not to mention all the windows and the trans blue 1x2x5 bricks and plants its a good thing the target audience likes stickers though theres more here than ive seen on any set except the 7709 sentai fortress i think they were aiming for one sticker per page of instructions i hope belville returns in 2010 thanks for the review sieggy did your daughter ever go back to it	positive

hello all eurobricks members and town lovers this is my first classic town review for today i will be featuring the 6641 4wheelin truck which is produced in 1987 for some younger members in eb you might not have encounter such a baby roaming down the streets horning at others with its big massive truck considering this is a 1987 set such a vehicle size is considered big in those days name 4wheelin truck theme lego system  town year 1987 pieces 80 minifigs 1 price usd650 an image of a 6641 4wheelin truck hello everyone why the name 4wheelin truck it is because this truck is equipped with 4 heavy duty wheels which is considered big among other small vehicles in classic town please take note most of the vehicles that are produced in classic town era are 4studs wide this truck is no exception meet the driver and his truck this truck has a very good combinations of different colors that are common for most town vehicles it made used of blue white and red as its primary combinations i find that this combinations is quite soothing to its eyes especially the blue bricks in addition the minifig torso is superb the driver must be a great fan of this vehicle i realised most truck drivers in the classic town era wear this most of the time i wonder if its some kind of an organization front view there is 2 red doors coupled with the truck to enable the driver to get in properly this vehicle is considered big in the 1980s however if you compared it with the current city vehicles this truck certainly will not outsize the current designs please take note of the wheels the wheels are pretty different i dont remember seeing these wheels in many other vehicles maybe some members can help me on this most of the classic town vehicles have a window frame on top which is known as a sunroof in this set this feature is also included furthermore the vehicle frame has a simple mechanism which all town lovers love it is to lift it up and place their driver in and out the seat most importantly you do not have to take off the entire window frame just to put in the driver different angles of the 4wheelin truck snot technique back 20 years ago lego had been experimenting with snot technique you can see that the back looks very neat without the studs in addition it can be quite useful to place a minifig on top of it or throw some baggage for some quick getaway summary review playability 810 great addition to your town collection design 8510 very good design i love 4studs truck at least it is able to occupy one side of the lane price 910 an inexpensive set based on the 1987 pricing overall 8510 a must have for all classic town lovers we have been complaining for more wider range of vehicle i gave it a 4 based on my review score card what about yours hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated edited by whitefang 13 july 2008  1208 pm	positive

whitefang on jul 13 2008 1125 am said the wheels are pretty different i dont remember seeing these wheels in many other vehicles maybe some members can help me on this first of all another great review thanks for doing these as for the wheels these were primarily technic wheels but did find their way into some other models in white i can only find a handful of minifig sets that they are included with theres half a dozen space sets but apart from the 4wheelin truck the only other town set appears to be the 6524 blizzard blazer tractor with snow plough the wheels were also in a train set called 4549 road  rail hauler where they were the wheels on a big forklift cheers rog	neutral

i recently got a few still sealed and new sets from the 90 on ebay and after the rock raiders hover scout this isthe second one ill review i really like the space port theme even if the sets may be more simple than earlier space city sets i like the overall look and the color scheme but enough of that lets go on with the pictures set nr 6455 name space simulation station number of minifigs 3 number of pieces 240 release year 1999 first again a few pics of the boxes and the instructions the main box this theme had a kinda strange seperation of the pieces the parts for the control center and the shuttle are in seperate little boxes and the others are in polybags with the models printed on them also seperate instructions for each step a general overview we got 3 lovely minifigs here from left to right the control engineer the mechanic and the astronaut the i dont know the english word for it testingthing the astronaut is being tested to hard nerves there the mechanics little car on the back an extinguisher and a radio device is attached the takeoff station for the little shuttle with the shuttle itself on it and without it tools tools tools the shuttle as standalone i think that would be fuel tanks i like this little detail and finally we have the controll room would have been better with seats but its alright a really sweet midsized set if you ask me a few juniorized parts but it fits perfectly with the set the theme itself is also great and i wish that tlg brings it back i could see stunning sets with the quality city sets have right now	positive
you just bring memorys back i never had one of the space port sets but i know that as a little boy i visited my toy store and kept on looking to the boxes on bl those sets cost too much for what ist worth today really tlc should bring this theme back space port on	positive

minibump wow id completely forgotten about this theme which is suprising since i absolutely loved this theme as a kid minus the sound n light brick which i thought was pretty big and ugly sure brings back memories of looking at those little catalogue booklets that came with the sets	positive
i had never seen this set or this theme before it was released during my dark age and i had missed it its nice to see such sets surface once again to educate members like me that there are some good sets we had missed during the dark age and i must admit that this is a very good set its comes with 3 minifigs and staudie with it geez i never thought he was an astronaunt back then the testing facility is great and i love to see it spin by putting staudie in it for a testrun the buggy is cute as well but somehow i dont really like the white frame at the back it looked a little odd to me the tools are simply wonderful to have furthermore these are grey tools the last time we had so many tools are the aeroplane mechanic the shuttle is nice but does the shuttle supposed to come with a cover as well i guess since this is a simulator they must have cut down the budget for it the control room is good and it will be even better with chairs included metalandi thanks for the wonderful review	neutral

update i will be merging reviews as they go idle this is now the dino attack review thread what jays not doing viking reviews nope i think christopher110 took care of those just fine instead i have brought you what is most possibly the highestanticipated set of the year  d  the t1 typhoon and i gotta say  dinos apart its actually really cool the dinos lets get the worst over with yes those are all the parts in that dino	negative
the figs theyre possibly the best part of the entire set all in all nice new head although the glasses limit its usability i am in love with the head on that fig its perfect for any number of figures  a good scarred hero face has always been on my want list im turning him into my viking warlord after i post this review again a new head great stubbly beard thing going on my secondfavorite head of the lot great for warriors especially with helms the torsos are fantastic for special forces figures if anyones planning to do something like that not too fond of the lime green on there but its still extremely usable this is actually a really cool machine gun i like it i think this would be a good point to note that all designs you see  outside the figures and dinos  are stickers that means a crapload of stickers if you cant stand stickers at all in a set dont buy this	positive
the copter this is one bigass copter the photos really dont do the size justice lower cockpit with cool computer too bad its a sticker although ill definitely leave this one on upper cockpit with cool computer see above awesome gatling gun yes even the technic beams have stickers im actually really fond of that little canister thing i can see using it elsewhere yes  thats a sticker the rope and hook i forgot to mention it before this set comes with two accessories besides the machine gun  binocs and one of those little things to slide down the rope also the thing that extends the rope turns the other side because theyre slightly asymmetrical one of my favorite stickers the door says survival equipment its on both sides definitely a keeper	positive
another of my favorite parts  landing gear this is the front section  and it retracts unlike most ships with landing gear this does not retract without effort coughxwingcough very sleek the back landing gear  and again smooth retraction gotta love it final score 8410 parts 810 figs 1010 dinos 210 copter 910 value 710 dont buy if  you can wait for vikings  you dont like any set with stickers  youre not a space fan buy if  youre a space fan  you dont mind stickersdont apply them  youre like to create cool figures overall i think it was worth the price even at 605 pieces however id suggest buying vikings even considering this well hope this review unexpected as it was  helped someone out there until next time bloody jay	positive
as unexpected as it was this was very helpful  three questions though 1 is the front green rubber missle a traditional launchable missle or does it have another firing mechanism 2 concerning the guns on the side are they fixed in one postition or does it have any functions 3 why did you decide to buy this set just curious	neutral

great review jay  tks a lot  i am not that of the big fan of the copter due to its proportions  but i admit its really asome looking better as i expected od the best are those mfs  they are truly awsome  i wiil but some of the smaller sets just for the figs hehe too bad that my favorite  your second best  dont come in the smallers sets   are you going to review the other sets as well  that could be cool 	positive
thanks bloodyjay another brilliant review i really like the helicopter though i hate the stickers it seem like there are a lot of it it wont stop me from buying it too bad that when will the dino line arrive in singapore    guess ive have to wait for the meanwhile	positive
hmmmm     interesting its a shame though because i really like the guns any idea when it should come to europe edit ive just scene the official dino attack site which says theyre coming to europe in october	neutral
no there arent any pictures yet	neutral
photos are not available but basically it is guns chains ropes crates	neutral
wow great review for a great set thanks jay i really like it although to big for my city  i too really like the mfs because of your review i am definitely considering it thanks again legobmw	positive
thats interesting news about the european release id definitely be interested to see how they modify the set  chains ropes and crates are definitely useful pieces cant wait for pictures to everyone looking for just the figures  dont skip out and get the smaller set and the tank spend the extra 20 and get the t1 its well worth it i might pick up the steel sprinter and the fire hammer myself still trying to decide if i do ill review them	positive
the weapon whatever its called this uses the same mechanism as the longboat for those that dont have either you snap the little sports stand thing which hits the missile which fires and since theres nothing holding the technic beam up to that height any more it drops down so that the next missile drops into place pretty cool if unrealistic the two on the side do not fire i think theyre mainly there for extra ammo my biggest problem with this set open bed this could have easily been remedied with a few plates interior opened the fire hammer next to the t1 they look very cool together dont they you can also see my curio shelf final score 7410 dinos 110 fig 810 but thats just me hummer 8510 parts 910 im a harsh reviewer i still think that if spacevehicles are your thing you should buy this however if youre a bigger castle fan or just like to get all sorts of lego i would still suggest buying the viking catapult before this however i do think that these are some of the coolest sets of 2005 this is something you will eventually want to get until next time bloody jay	positive
thanks bloody jay any chance you could be reviewing the other dino attack sets	neutral
mr legobildur on jul 25 2005 1011 pm said thanks bloody jay any chance you could be reviewing the other dino attack sets possibly the steel sprinter and urban avenger but i can say with finality that i will not buy the tank until i find it available for 30 or less on that note if anybody does find it for 30 or less shoot me a pm 	neutral

i love this set and i wish i thought of the bridge piece idea the only part i dont like is the lift thanks for the great review metalandi on jul 18 2008 0653 pm said edit oh damn i forgot to write review in the topic title can a mod please add this thanks done	positive
thanks for the awesome review metalandi your pics are very clear and you go into detail about all the functions of the set i agree this is a great set  one of the best of the cg line for sure way better than the boat set with the tower on the bionicle baseplate and cheaper too i even like the helicopter better than the oversized version lots of great parts and a really nice build by the looks of it too i cant wait for this to be released in oz	positive
seeing the pictures in this review certainly reinforce my original thoughts on this set heres an oilrig mod waiting to happen	neutral
good review  i will buy it this year 	positive
excellent review metalandi its always great to see early pictures of new sets this set really reminds me of an oil rig and could probably be easily modified as one if one wanted an alternate model the two components that i like most are the boat crane and the control room but other sections are pretty slick as well are those printed pieces in the control room or stickers im really starting to gain an appreciation for these new coast guard sets theyve come a long way over the years 575 coast guard station released 1978 i picked up the control boat  tower 7739 a few weeks ago but havent opened it yet in any case thanks for taking the time to review this set and share it over eb	positive
is there any way to order one of these if you dont live in france or one of the countries where sh sells it	neutral
the worker looks like he soiled his pants um oh yeah nice reveiw very cool set im not sure about the bottom floor glass being dark grey and the top floor glass being light blue	negative
i think it looks good on the real set i thought the darker glass might be good on the ground level so the rescued guy has it nice and dark in there	positive
nice review this is just the crown jewel for the coast guard theme i love the layout of its platform it looks real neat to have it placed it in the midst of the deep blue sea awaiting of any emergency rescue sometimes i feel that this set can used it to merge with my aqua raiders sets i thought of using it as a land base for the raiders to dock in their stuff before submerge into the ocean ok its just a wierd idea of mine just feel that aqua raiders and coast guard can work hand in hand since they are naval expertise it seemed i cant view all the pictures somehow nevertheless i can still view some of it quite well i love the command center the amount of computer printed pieces simply make me smile with the monitor keyboard radar screen and etc the helicopter is cute too however i pity the victim that is loaded at the back it seemed a little bit too dangerous in addition this set seemed to have quite alot of stickers which can be quite discouraging i do hope to see this set soon so far i quite like the current coast guard sets	positive

paramedic unit set  6364 year released 1980 piece count 140 minifigs 2 list price unknown well let me first say that the english name paramedic unit is not really a good name for this set the function of a paramedic is to take a patient from an emergent situation and deliver them to a hospital for treatment generally an emergency room this is a rather small clinic that i would imagine is more for family care than an emergency room in addition the car looks more like a doctornurses car rather than an ambulance or emergency response vehicle i would call this a clinic rather than a paramedic unit in any case its a great set esp for table towns that need medical services what i like is that this set is small enough to place anywhere in your lego city or town starting with the instructions like all the classic town sets alternate models are pictured although i never tried building one i like the little medical busvan the set includes two minifigs that include a female doctore or nurse and what i presume is a patient based on the torsos i really like the vehicle its a 4stud wide two seater the colors work well and i like the use of the white bar between the seats and the 1x1 blue plates for lights unfortunately the emblems are stickers heres a shot of the neat little clinic i like the use of the blinds for the exam room it shows that lego considered patient privacy when making this set the interior includes an exam room desk and two blue swivel chairs and a neat little eye chart although the letters l e g o would have made a nice touch lastly a picture of the complete set i must admit that i remember buying this set back in the 80s and i regreted it after taking it home im not sure what i didnt like about it perhaps the girl back then but now i really think its a neat set well theres a line of patients waiting to have their eyes checked comments welcome	neutral
thanks a lot for the review brickster i never had the chance to get some classic town sets but i wish i couldve i just wonder why lego cant release sets like this anymore	neutral
paramedic unit does not seem to suit well for this sets name it should be named as clinic outpatient treatment family doctor and etc from what i understand parmedic unit is a standalone unit that is on standby 247 ready for any emergency rescue in lego town ambulance with a group of paramedics will be ideal for this kind of situation i love female doctors especially with that lovely hairpiece the cruiser is a neat 4studs wide design just love these small car designs back then i wonder what can be used at the back of its boot the clinic is neat maybe we can send holodoc for some medical audit to make sure that this clinic is up to standard what surprised me the most is the neat little eye chart you dont see such details in any regular lego set the red and white color combination for the building works well for me most of the hospital buildings and vehicles always revolved in red and white i gave this a 4 thanks you so much brickster	positive
thebrickster on jul 19 2008 0230 am said i just cant believe someone would rate this set a 1 it appears to be a trend among these classic reviews never with a comment of why maybe a tfol it is our destiny to show them that lego existed before 1997 and was imho way better than today we need more classic reviews i hope i can continue with technic sets	neutral
people giving this 1 g id give it a 4 id give it a 3 but added a point out of nostalgia i think its a nice town set from the old days the only problem i always had is the lack of an ambulance and we got a female doctor 	neutral
brickster strikes again with another awesome review ah one of the few hospital related kits lego made wasnt this the first hospital with modern minifigs because i seem to remember seeing an even older hospital online that had the armless faceless figs regardless this would be great as a little doctors office in someones town layout  although the vehicle is a little silly and that eye chart sticker has to be the coolest decal ever quote maybe a tfol well it sure isnt me i personally love older kits even though im only a teen i like a lot of the newer sets a bit more than some of the classic stuff but i have always agreed that the 70s and 80s were an extremely high point in legos time even though i dont really own any kits from the period edited by grevious 19 july 2008  0505 pm	positive

thank you for all these reviews thebrickster and the idea with the polls is a very nice and interesting idea it will only take a while until i will have commented on all  so please give me some time  i gave this set a four the vehicle the minfigs and the design of the house are excellent  only the interior could be a bit spiced up telephone some other equipment klausdieter	positive
rriggs on jul 20 2008 1058 pm said the definition of a paramedic is someone who assists physicians in providing medical care i think in more modern times a paramedic is generally thought of as a more qualified and experienced ambulance technician but the dictionary definition would seem to fit with the lego model quite well rriggs thanks for clearing it up actually i did not check it with the dictionary thanks for giving a clear definition for paramedic	neutral
i like this set like most i view it more as a clinic it sits nicely in my town plan these old sets are all very cool	positive
wow old thread just for the record so long as it is here paramedics are advanced ambulance technicians unlike standard emts they are trained for advanced cardiac life support they can push drugs defibrillate place a breathing tube etc in the 1980s when the set was made it was quite common for paramedics to respond to calls in fly cars or special response units they would join up with ambulances at the scenes that required their skills if you ever watched the old american tv show emergency johnny gage and squad 51 were one of these response units they were mostly phased out in the 90s in favor of simply putting the paramedics and als gear in the ambulances	neutral
hello all eurobricks members and town lovers today i will be doing up a review on hook  haul wrecker this name is quite wierd to me i will prefer to call it the regular tow truck this is one of the service and repair vehicle that are always ready 247 on standby for any emergency towing in our towns name hook  haul wrecker theme lego system  town year 1989 pieces 44 minifigs 1 price usd600 an image of a 6660 hook  haul wrecker let the towing begins hook  haul wrecker is the typical 4studs wide vehicle that takes care of broken vehicles that is left stranded on the roads this tow truck is pretty useful as you can see current city sets hardly have any tow trucks available to tow new cars design this tow truck is catered for 4studs vehicles for classic town can you imagine yourself this truck towing a speed racer car i think it looks really out of proportion in addition the minifig which is included in this set has the regular truck print on its torso i am very sure they must be a fan club for trucks otherwise they should really need a change of clothes nevertheless in my honest opnion i really love this torso very much somehow it makes them look tough even though their face looks very friendly side view this vehicle has a combination of two primary colors which is white and red this color combination looks very good you cannot mistook it for an ambulance since they made use of this two colors too in most emergency vehicles this is my guess i supposed the designer will have tow truck concept as a form of emergency and considered red and white as its combinations this vehicle setup has the typical sunscreen on the top of the vehicle frame however this baby has more unique features installed in it these are the source of its brutal strength allterrain vehicle this tow truck equipped with the best wheels in fact these wheels offer suspension on the roads even when its travelling uphill the truck will move accordingly with its tyres when you act pressure on the top of the vehicle it will either be shifted leftwards or rightwards closeup of these unique tyres take a careful look these wheels have springs installed in it that is the magic of these vehicle and is defintely suited to run on any rough roads with least problems if any eb members know which other vehicles has this unique features please highlight it to me because if i remembered correctly i only remember seeing this pair of tyres in this great set he is ready for some serious towing the driver had finished hook up the pizza van on its back its pretty simple you just have to lift the back of the vehicle and placed it onto the hook presto the van is ready to go this vehicle provides so much fun you can really tow any 4studs vehicle in your town and here we go to the service station poor pizza guy summary review playability 1010 superb fun you will love to use this truck and tow any vehicles design 9510 excellent design especially with the use of the suspension tyres price 910 an inexpensive set based on the 1989 pricing this set is made up of less than 100 pieces overall 9510 every town must need a tow truck if a vehicle breaks down whom will be ready to tow i gave it a 5 based on my review score card what about yours hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelfwhen moderated	neutral

oh never seen that set before fun and strange that wheel supension system has it ever been used in any other sets	neutral
45 ive had this set since i was young never understood why a tow truck needed to be an offroader maybe it was used to tow the other offroad vehicles the suspension made the truck too tall to tow some cars so i often took the hook out and use the truck as just an great offroad truck like 6672 which also had the suspension wheels other tow truck sets better filled their roles better but that doesnt diminish this set at all whitefang on jul 18 2008 0919 am said i think it looks really out of proportion no for 25odd years this vehicle was perfectly proportioned with all others in the towncity line its all these new 6 and 8 and 20 wide vehicles that are ignoring convention and making it look out of proportion granted speed racer sets are more of their own line but 6660 is smaller than most of the cars produced in the last few years	positive

exxon gas station set  6375 year released 1980 piece count 254 minifigs 3 list price approx 20 one of the gems of my sets from 1980 has to be the exxon gas station it has very nice colors lots of great details and a high level of playability starting with the instructions the backside with a great picture of the complete set the set includes three minifigs including two gas station attendants and my favorite the urban cowboy one of the best things about this set is that it includes not one but two very detailed 4stud wide vehicles heres a picture of the red one which is a twoseater the car has two working doors a hood that opens and a little holed brick on the other side for pretending to fill er up heres another image at an angle isnt she a nice set of wheels heres the yellow car i always liked this one better perhaps it was the color with the black pieces in the back although it is a oneseater the set includes four fuel pumps that are numbered with decals and included a string as the hose heres a little accessory rack for oil and tools and another rack for tires the set had a nice exxon logo on three 1x6 bricks a large jack allows the cars to be lifted high into the air for tire and under engine repairs i love the office with its large 5x6 window inside is a chair and desk and the entire set happy motoring in legoland	positive

i think we only got shell stations in europe in the 80s never got this one but it looks like a typical lego gas station  once again i just dont know how you were able to keep stickers and prints in such a great condition i am sooooo jealous the tires of the cars are a problem though it was difficult and painful to put them off the wheel and back on later the black hat g i would have looooooved to have that when i was a boy	negative
i much prefer the shell version of that station which had the full awning over the roadway and the special road plate with the extra lane to pull into to fill er up	neutral
great review of a classic set man this is sure a wondeful kit even today the level of detail is astounding for the time and the whole kit is really cute you know i honestly dont get why some people have complained about the city gas stations figure count  the majority of lego gas stations had no more than three figures  including this one and the wonderful gas and wash express which i actually own i also dont get why people complain about the stickers so much  because even older kits often had a lot personally i think stickers are okay because printed pieces cant be used in as many places if the stickers are really specialized	positive

looks like a great set i may consider making this the first mars mission set i buy nice review also but quote lol thanks i just wanted to claim my place for the review personally i dont think you had a place to claim somebody else could have also gotten this set and had a proper review ready before yours but felt it was wrong to post because you had posted a placeholder  clubninja in this case i think placeholders should be banned and if you are not ready to post a full review you should not post anything simple really either that or what is the policy on here regarding more than one review of a set being posted  then you could have both posted reviews and it wont really matter i guess just my 2 cents worth thanks for the review though	positive
nice review good closeups and a good unconventional choice of a set as for the set itself it has its pros and cons in my eyes i like all the minifigs but especially the witch the fright knights are probably the closest you can get for an evil human castle faction as for the building itself on the other hand i like the fact that it can be modified but some of the design choices are just stupid the holes in the wall the one huge tower as opposed to several smaller ones the huge empty space in the center and the excessive usage of bright yellow i guess for a smaller kid the play value is great its easily accessible and it looks sturdy enough but to an afol its not much else than a source for bricks and figs in my opinion oh and they did have telescopes in the medieval times the witch most probably uses it for astrology and even if they didnt were talking about a castle with a dragon and a wicked witch in it so its not exactly a good example of accurate history	negative
sweet review metalandi this set always looked a bit too busy for my liking i guess i just didnt expect to see a set so tall after seeing your review though it is growing on me i like all the play features and at the very least its a great parts pack two things im confused about though in this pic is that dragon being used as a swing set and i dont get why the area where the witch casts her spells on the second floor is green green in castle means grass or forestmen  and having grass on the second floor of a building is just weird i understand that its modular and thus it would make sense if it were placed on the ground but dark grey would make just as much sense and would look much better than the green there imo anyway im just fussy thanks again for the cool review will we be seeing any more peace	negative
i love the reviews of older sets that i never had also tiny thing but you said it has 7 minifigs but the group shots only include 6 the last guy isnt shown until the very end	neutral
iamded yes it seems the dragon is used as such in the picture of the alternate model but i guess bad and evil knights also wanna have some fun sometimes you are right with the green plate on the second floor it does look a bit disturbing but that can	negative
i thoroughly enjoyed your review metalandi thank you especially for taking photos of all the contraptions and detailing exactly how they work as a member of classiccastle the census always seemed to be that fright knights were a class 410 or 610 but as sandy stated above it is one of the closest you can get to an evil faction by todays standards the contraptions seen here are much much more sophisticated and well thought out and are definitely missing in 2007s kings castle siege i enjoy the design of this castle much more even if the towers are taller simply because the design in the kings castle siege left builders with an empty space right in the courtyard without even a base plate and its nearly impossible to get your hands in and play in the enclosed space why would anyone unless youre simply posing figs and even that was difficult this castle instead had a variety of trap doors and surprises so despite the varied colors used here its not that hard to realize that the designers for this castle really took time to think things out and tried to make the castle enjoyable for the children that will play with it whereas our 2007 castle was strictly built to give kids the impression of an enormous magnificant castle with little to nothing inside its like comparing beauty 2007 to brains this castle edited by legobear 20 july 2008  0132 am	positive

metalandi thanks for doing this fright knights review by opening up a misb set which you have bought recently i am very sure the feeling is very nice especially touching the bricks which is preserved for 11 years sealed in bags i am quite fond of the fright knights theme unfortunately this theme was released during my dark age i never really bought sets from fright knights instead i bought plenty of minifigs to build an army if i could turn back time or find another misb set with a reasonable price i am very sure i will get it my soldiers need a castle to stay in i will be looking forward to your next review keep up the good job	neutral
ah this brings back memories i have this set and i loved the playabilaty factor opposing to older castle sets i have in medieval times there actually were primitive telescopes you can read about it here thanks for this review great storie great pics	positive

my first post in this topic looks foolish now that i bought this set from ebay i just really wanted the minifigs although i already had the batlord and the black dragon and the parts they will help me greatly in building the impenetrable fortress of the dragonwarriors for my princess quest comic by the end of this week this set will be in my clutches	positive

well that the bricks look new comes from that they are new i got this set new and unopened	neutral
ahh i remember how badly i wanted that set when it was new oh well definitely one of the most original castles if not the most i actually liked how the 1st floor was made into a throne room the tower looks pretty impressive too of course the castle has a flagrant flaw  the walls on the sides are open i also think it lacks in the minifig count though that is understandable for a castle with a dragon quote the fright knights are probably the closest you can get for an evil human castle faction totally agreed	positive
quite the topic bump but dang what a cool set and so tall this is the kind of sets i had as a kid but i dont remember this one im jealouss	positive
this is a great set and a great review  thanks for doing these i remember my brother getting this set i got the police station 6384 on the same day truly classic sets  its a shame that i dont have them anymore although i do have the two immediate descendants of the sets cheers rog	positive

i have a slightly different version of this set and i must say it is great boy to these reviews bring back memories thanks	positive
great review i love tis set too the best firestation ever made by lego mainly because the 80s sets are the favourite with me only i miss a helicopterplatvorm well i made a little modification	positive
i am a proud owner of this set this is one of the best fire stations ever what amazes me is what the designers made with only 368 pieces you get a very nice looking building in good size a good baseplate 2 cars 4 minifigs accessories and great alternative ideas in the back of the box like the fire boat or helicopter this is a great example of lego design	positive
i must agree great fire station i love the fact that in the classic sets you were given a base plate and some other great ideas i do miss the addition of base plates and alternate building ideas the only newer set i have seen with any alternate build photos is the 7239 fire engine i miss back when	positive

fire copter 1 this is fc1 over im making my way to main street now the smoke is coming from the legoland hotel over thats a roger im going to shoot the 500 gallon now over fire in your tabletown no problem legos set 6685 fire copter is sure to put it out  classic style set  6685 year released 1982 piece count 99 minifigs 1 list price unknown heres a great firethemed addition to your classic legoland display starting with the instructions the set includes one classic fireman with a nicely printed fireman torso what a great little detailed helicopter i love the use of the red and yellow colors the front opens to allow your fireman to quickly climb in in the back are two round yellow 2x2 bricks for the water supply and a hose connected on each side unfortunately i lost one of the hoses and the entire set isnt she a beauty 6685 fire copter 1 is a great supplement to set 6382 fire station released one year earlier after buying this great little set i had fun puting out fires all over my tabletown oops i think i smell one now	positive
thebrickster thank you so much for all these reviews of classic town sets omfg this set was released in 1982 and i was born 1 year earlier hehe  nice little heli	neutral
a nice little model with some neat features for its age plus the allyime classic fireman as a bonus however this design of chopper the police station around the same time was the same design i think dated very quickly while is was good to use the hinged car roof  which was relatively new at the time  together with the inverted screen it was superceded very quickly by designs that stood the test of time far better for example 6657 also i dont think i could everbuy a lego fire helicopter because it is not something we have in the ukeire police coast guard ambulance military etc etc but no fire helicopters not something i would therefore want in my lego town great review though many thanks again for doing these cheers rog	negative
well its ok but its not great voted 3 seems the classic town hater has voted a 1 again will the madness ever stop	neutral
a truly great set i always loved the mobile crane and was gobsmacked when this popped up using some of the great features from the crane but also making it an emergency vehicle too great classic firemen and  in your version  a suspiciously blue fire extinguisher great review of a great set  just a pity i no longer have it so many sets i used to have got lost during the period at the end of my childhood before i rescued what was left from my dads house once i realised what i had left behind hindsight is a great thing cheers again rog	positive
a great review i like this set it captures the classic town feeling well and the ladder is cool i cant help but feel thought that these reviews are being churned out to quickly you should leave a gap i am being flooded with all these great reviews	neutral
this definitly is a nice set i think this was also the first set to use that white basket nice one whitefang	positive
what an awesome little set i really like this engine but dont remember seeing it during the late 80s it must have been out during my dark ages i love the basketsection for the firemen equally nice is the fire hose which extends a good length the color combination of red with white and the trans blue windshield looks goos as well this is a great engine and one that would look perfect in a classic tabletown  and its 4studs wide very nice review whitefang i look forward to seeing more of your classic town reviews	positive
nice review whitefang with lots of photos  exactly as a good review should be as for the set  i own it and its a very good one the fire squad vehicle is a nice addition to my other fire dept vehicles it offers very good playability and this ladder is so long you can have so much fun with it	neutral
thats a great reviewpoll whitefang i gave this set a 5 its simply  the only thing which i miss are the respirators for the firemen since they already own air tanks but otherwise this set is brilliant i like it much more than the new one from 2007 since its not that big and juniorized klausdieter	positive
great set i found only one major fail  this  the hands of robot arms gets easly broken	positive
thanks for the review this set was outstanding for its time with all the features and detail the extending basket is just wonderful however i honestly wouldnt consider it the best firetruck ever i actually like the one from 2005 even better  becasue like most of the city vehicles it adds the needed bulk big engines like fire trucks need many of the older kits while awesome were honestly a little too skinny imo	positive
guys thanks for all your great comments nikola bathory on jul 22 2008 0657 pm said it offers very good playability and this ladder is so long you can have so much fun with it yes the extended length of the ladder provides great playability klausdieter on jul 25 2008 0301 am said i like it much more than the new one from 2007 since its not that big and juniorized thanks kd i owned the 2007 fire engine as well as this set was not restored back then and i needed a fire engine very badly i managed to restored it somehow and i compared it with the 2007 the older design is still the best osakana on jul 25 2008 0403 am said great set i found only one major fail  this  the hands of robot arms gets easly broken yes this is an interesting finding i remembered when i was a child that robot arms always come out of its own when i fiddle with it i was so annoyed by it and i just kept it there whenever i deployed it for rescue missions grevious on jul 26 2008 0200 am said however i honestly wouldnt consider it the best firetruck ever i actually like the one from 2005 even better  becasue like most of the city vehicles it adds the needed bulk big engines like fire trucks need many of the older kits while awesome were honestly a little too skinny imo grevious i appericate your honest comments and given me your insight towards this set and state a comparison as well i agreed with you that fire engines need to be big and sturdy on the other hand it can be nice to have the fire engine to look slim as well to cut through the traffic easily i am not against with the newer sets it just that part of the reasons which reflected in the review had fufill the basic key factors of a typical fire engine in addition it was my alltime favourite under the firefighting theme	positive
one of my all time favourite i still love it even after all these years though it did always seem a bit out of place as when i was a child i’d never seen a similar looking fire appliance in the uk	positive

i have a question what is the door above the gun for pic	neutral
this sounds very similar to the first one im glad im saving this one till later in my purchasing cycle all the sw walkers have a skeletal fram with almost nothing inside its very disappointing but i guess filling them in would up the piece count considerably does this beast have any good handholds for picking it up i seem to recall a handle or something coming out of the top in the prerelease pics	negative
so basically you cited as faults what everybody had been complaining about since the first information of the set arrived skeletal interior and lack of clones although i didnt realize it didnt have numbered backs that really is just ridiculous lego finally comes up with a very intelligent solution to the frustration seen when building large sets but then they neglect to implement it wtf lame still this may be the only clone wars set i buy besides the exclusives the exterior which imo is the only part that matters looks so fantastic i dont care about clones i have enough of those already and at 90 its still a better buy than the rgs the torrent is cool but not as cool as the fighter tank or dgs imo awesome inconstruction pics	positive
thanks for the reivew could you post a few pics of the atte in all its glory kimt	neutral
i just got this set sunday and its so huge that i cant put it anywhere it is pretty sturdy and heavy thats where the handle comes in im pissed that you only get 2 clones rex has to fight on the ground while you need more clones to man the gunscockpit the legs were the most annoying and time consuming part of the build and yea i agree that if tlg had made numbered bags it would have taken only 2 hours rather than 4 edited by ih master 13uilder17 14 october 2008  1138 pm	negative
i bought this a few weeks ago and absolutely loved making it its amazing how the paneling comes together to make such a tight fit but can easily open up the legs could have been a bit more poseable and the guns dont launch easily unless you push hard and fast id like the firing mechanism to launch more smoothly but it looks absolutely amazing about price it was ¥13000 where i am but im used to lego being expensive in japan so it was good value	positive

hey everyone my wife took me to legoland for my birthday just last week we had a fantastic time and it gave me the chance to pick up some of the new castle sets and battlepacks i was really impressed by the sets i bought and decided to do my first review let battle commence set name tower raid set number 7037 price gbp £1999 pieces 364 the models heres a shot of the complete set the set is made up of two models the crown knights tower and the orcs siege tower lets start with the crown knights tower a knight readies himself for battle my favourite model from the set the wicked orcs siege tower please note that for the purposes of display i mounted the orcs banner onto a small cone set on the top platform of the siege tower this doesnt come with the set but saves any orcs having to hold onto it all he time there are other areas it can be placed without using extra parts features both models look great and have excellent features the set as a whole has great playability and seems to have been concieved with a storyline the crown knights have a captured orc within the walls of their tower so the orc army has been sent out to recover him or are they merely after the gold the knights keep horded away the orcs siege tower has a powerful ram  springloaded by the simple arrangement of an elastic band  so pulling it back sends it flying out the front knocking down the wall on the side of the knights tower and releasing the captive orc the floor panels inside the prison are laid over a lip on the inside of the collapsible wall so fall in when theyre not supported theres a string at the rear for extending the boarding ramp and letting a fearsome orc warrior charge across flickfire action the battle heats up as the orcs close in the minifigures the crown knights i really like the crown knights theyre metallic helmets look great and they come with nice accessories the archer has a double printed head with a frightened look on the other side too im not surprised id be frightened when staring over the ramparts at these the orcs these guys really do look the part worthy advesaries to the crown knights the details are superb the printed elements weapons and helmets all set the orcs aside on the battlefield the set comes with a great new molded armour neckpiece too the mighty orc leader looks wicked in his full battlegear overview theres so much to this set its hard not to be impressed the orcs siege engine is a thing of beauty or terror and would look great on any battlefield the crown knights tower although basic looks good and has great playability im a big fan of the new castle knights and fantasy minifigures and the inclusion of five of them is just enough for this set and as a booster to any army at £1999 in the uk this set is well worth the money for content and quality id highly recommmend this set as a musthave purchase for anyone a final shot of the siege tower with a host of orcs ready for battle i hope you enjoyed my review ill be posting my next one for 7040 dwarves mine defender soon	positive

pedro for your first review you have amaze me with your photo session and the strucutre of your review i am very impressed by your high quality pictures you have done an excellent job i love the tower raid very much as it offers high playability with the wall and flooring falling down when the ram hits the wall its quite interesting to play with the mechanism of the ram is very fun to play with as well i will try and pull back and released it to knock a row of soldiers this is one of my favourite sets in castle 2008 well done	positive
whitefang on jul 30 2008 1256 am said pedro for your first review you have amaze me with your photo session and the strucutre of your review i am very impressed by your high quality pictures you have done an excellent job i completely agree this is an amazing review  bits of humor great photography and detailed descriptionsphotos based upon this review ive placed an order for this set along with some convincing from amazons 20 sale  the only drawbacks in this set that i can see concerns the tower with it being 1 small compared to the seige tower and 2 missing a few walls however this is also the joy of lego as one can simply purchase a few bricks and build their own walls andor expand the towers size or even attach it to a castle of course this increases the price of the set but considering how cheap bricks are on bricklink tower raid is still a very good value i hope you continue doing reviews pedro	positive
th set was fantastic becuase it was cheap and supplied a very good amount of pecies and had rather good minifigures	positive
i have one of these and must say that this is the best castle set in the theme and the most useful parts pack for its size yet	positive
name jungle duel set ref 7624 number of minifigs 3 number of pieces 90 price 900 a basic review of 7624 my apologies for the blurry and grainy pictures my camera is acting up  the build is nothing speicial on to the figs indiana jones mutt williams and irina spalkoi nice array of minifigs although i think they should have included a russian soldier or two if you look to the right on mutts jacket it has his name in script the tent is great aside from the fact that the fabric bends easily a nice amount of speicial pieces the weapons rack is pretty nifty so is the table when you swap the white piece with a black one overall it is a very nice set the 1000 price tag isnt so bad either thanks for reading playability1010 price810 figs810 build510 overall rating810 i recommend this set to all indiana jones and lego fans edited by wulf 29 july 2008  0250 pm	positive

time for my first review 7673 magnaguard starfighter peices 431  of figs 2 price 4499 usd the box pretty decent size box for the price magnaguards the normal box stuff front of the ship back open cockpit back of the box contents dss dreaded sticker sheet first manual page because its super important not to build on carpet  fig build the magna guard head imo its beautiful  the purple cone cape box the capes just one the magnaguard back the parts nicely sorted the new windshield piece beautiful the first step seccond step more steps of the main body the wing assembly sorry for the blur attached opposite wing both attached rear engine build the staffs i have mine set up differently than in the instructions i put one cone over the hump on one end of the staff and the other in the original spot then to load them onto the fighter all you do is push the original placed cone down and put it right in this way the staff looks better and it works the same see it slides right in skeletal parts of sides attached close up bottom both wings attached hidden missle launcher raised up another shot staffs attached complete side panel side pods complete swooshable finished time to complete 2hrs okay overall rating time price 910 could have been 4000 usd but due to new molds this is understandable parts 910 could have hade more dark red but thats imo plus i love dark red build time 810 i took my time on this and enjoyed the techniques the designers intricated also taking pics added to the time quite a bit playability 710 the main playability functions are the missle launchers in the back and the sliding cockpit my only gripe with these is they dont set right with the other slopes on the top also the inside of the cockpit is easily modded for regular size minifigs just pop a handlebar piece in the already provided arm in the cockpit and bam your favorite figs can have a ride it also helps keep the magnaguards in place if they hold it minifigs 1010 imo the new molds are great the only downfall is the right arm on both is less moveable due to the hard plastic turbanthing connected to the head swooshability 910 the starfighter is pretty sleek and very swooshable design 910 the most important aspect and this ones a winner its only a nine because it needs to have smoother edges in a few spots but they are easily modable overall score 87 i think its an awesome set very satisfying 2008 sw on dsr dsr edited by kimt 04 august 2008  1149 am indexed	positive

hmm a tougie i really like the world city one yet the dino one is a better deal ill vote for the dino because i regretably dont even have the world city one	positive
the coast guard quad because i live in the netherlands and we dont have the dino attack theme we have dino 2010 which have a diffrent quad so i would like to chose the dino attack one but as i dont one him goast guard though but i also dont have the coast guard one but i like him but i also dont have the coast quard one as well greets theforce edited by theforce 01 august 2008  1118 pm	positive
 that was a weird race anyway i love the look of both sets but ill have to go for the dino attack quad for a couple of reasons it is postapoc which i love features tan and dark red colours which are far more useful than yellow you get more bang for your buck with the dino set you get a little dino sure you can hate it but better than not having one right and the fig has much more useful pieces and a better face thanks for the face off thebrickster batbrick away	positive
its definately the street sprinter for me there are many reasons for that most of which have been mentioned by others already i hate yellow its the most useless color but i love tan and dark red its bigger and more detailed than the coast guard one plus i think there is a hinge in the back of it so there is apparently some more playability to it as well i love the postapoc style fig its detailed and simply looks cool also while the digger fig has quite an individual look to it the coast guard driver has the generic hero head and coast guard uniform its an overal better deal especially if you count the ludp which gives the set a whole lot more playability no matter how u the ldp may be tan  postapoc figs on	positive
ive got to go with the town one since you have to stand on the dino one steve	positive
i like the coast guard one but dinos eat coast guard people so dinos ftw and i think the dino bike would fit in with my collection pretty well	positive
dino attack for me you just cant say no to a huge bazooka though the tan and dark red works for me too	positive
the rancor on aug 2 2008 0939 am said i wish i had that but ill have to make do with the much less violent european version dino 2010 not attack heres a comaprison european version usa etc version theres a subtle difference but i prefer the us one i did not know that europe had a different quad or at least one without the bazooka interesting that the gun was removed from the european sets or added to the us sets i sort of like the chain i also notice a big difference in the boxart destroyed city to prehistoric volcano i wonder if the story was different as well thanks for sharing a good picture  well it does look like the dino quad has the upper hand almost double the votes	positive
dino attack quad for me no this isnt because i own it and not the other one but because i think just about everything is better in it  the design is better the colors are cooler and it has a better figure i dont like the figure in the coast guard quad at all  but since it was from world city im not suprised i also kinda like the dino actually its flexible and fits in with the previous dinos a lot better than the cruddy bigger ones with bright red yellow and green highlights	positive
ooooooh this is a very hard choicei like this new coast guard theme but i loved dino attackthe dino attack set has a weird looking gunbut imo the coast guard set lookscleaner if you get what i meanthe little dinolizard thing is practically worthless thats why i have a bin full of those little guysi want to keep liking dino attack i just cantso i know your like just get to the point already so i guess i have to go with coast guard thebrickster on aug 3 2008 0941 am said i did not know that europe had a different quad or at least one without the bazooka interesting that the gun was removed from the european sets or added to the us sets i sort of like the chain i also notice a big difference in the boxart destroyed city to prehistoric volcano i wonder if the story was different as well thanks for sharing a good picture  well it does look like the dino quad has the upper hand almost double the votes wow i would have so much wanted the european one more than the us one i mean that bazooka or as they called it a sonic screamer looks very silly	positive

dovchenko on aug 1 2008 0747 pm said finally a review of this thanks 120 bucks this tank looks tiny and though its amazingly detailed it should have been smaller and only 4050 bucks at most it just doesnt play that big a part man good pieces and mechanisms but no ones going to both buying a 120 buck tank no offence not unless it its the atte 120 is the price here in denmark it will most likely be the same price as the v19 torrent everywhere else so you dont have to worry about that	neutral

thanks for posting the review i’ve been wondering about this set to me it does feel a bit fig light for £50 i’d expect maybe one or two more clones i’m not to sure about the oversized issue it seems to me it’s better to have something a bit to large and have a better level or features than something smaller will less	negative

i am fairly confident that something involoving geonosis will be released in 2010 but any way i had this set  one of my first ones but i droped the ship and it blew up i found all the pieces but in never rebuilt the ship although i still have the figs ant the canon overall this set was above average in my opinion great review	positive
7263 tie fighter review parts 159 figs 2 price £2000 not sure my 2nd review today this set came out about the same time as the rots sets and included the first minifig to have a lul 1 box  manual this is the front of the box it has a try me slot for the lul vader a close up of the try me slot luckily i got mine form argos so no little kids have been playing around with it the manual cover im not quite sure why it has a pic of the figs on the front but it doesnt deface it so i dont mind random manual shot rots set preview at the back of the manual 2 general set and figs the contents of the set  the minifigs a normal tie pilot and the first ever lul fig dv also my only lul fig no helmets tie pilot torso the lul is made of 3 parts lighted up the led for the blade 3 the tie fighter just a pic of it cockpit with controls tie pilot sitting in the cockpit by the way the hinge brick is the wrong color it is supposed to be grey the cockpit shut i wonder why tlc never printed those cockpit glass things correctly jet out the back top plate has some nice printing 5 overall build 510 very repetitivewell the ships symmetrical minifigs 410 1 tie pilot which is okay but a lul vader he cant even fit in the ship design 610 strong but the wings are all wobbly if that makes sense i dont like the blue either parts 610 lots of blue grills thingys not much else but it got 6 because of the wings plates price 510 could have been more expensive at least it had 2 figs playability 110 cant do much as a stand alone set overall 410 there just isnt enough here it could at least have a better color scheme and instead of dv it could come with a stormie like the old one did	negative
thanks for the review i actually like the older tie better since it had a stand for the tie not really a fan of the lu figs either no matter  a tie is a tie and this is a must have fighter for any lego sw fan out there never can get enough ties except the tie advanced or vaders tiethey dont rock kimt	positive

and now for something completely different tiny turbos belonging to the racers line when i saw 8147 bullet run on sh for half the price i couldn´t resist buying it we had a lot of fun celebrating a bagbuild at our event using the 8150 zx turbo of that theme so i knew what would expect me with this extended set price normal 4999€ now 2499€ well i paid 3499€ in a lego store but that´s another story bricks 796 minifigs  hey this is tiny turbos stupid stickers don´t ask or read further the open box reveals seven polybags some with more smaller polybags inside the instruction booklet 2 ramps and the sticker sheet of course i put all of the bags on the table and not on the floor hey tlc didn´t print this on the first page of the building instructions and you won´t see any piece callouts as well on the other hand this is not adifficult build so why show them still there is an inventory list of all bricks at the end of the instructions note the giant sticker sheet we all now the dss but that is a new kind of extra super large sticker sheet it holds 82 stickers more to that later on the build is quite basic the only nonconventional parts of the build were the two slammers and the most annoying part was fiddling the rubber band of the holder without destroying it bag 1 easy beginning building the lime car the limo and the two slammers nothing exciting about the lime car but the limo was neat it´s an 18 studs long car the normal racers are abot 10 studs long nice way to put the horns on the back the slammers mmmmh nice invention if they would actually do something they are supposed to give the tubros a kick in the butt to speed them up but the result is a 80 cm long run and that´s it i had expected more acceleration from the slammers but it´s also fun to play with the cars without slamming them bag 2 convoy time the tow truck and the fuel truck the tow truck is a great idea and a good addition to the set the cars are supposed to crash  how do they get back home well here´s the answer quite american layout of the truck and it´s very well done horns 5 flashing lights and a right color choice you can move the arm up and down and pull out the hook note the metallic silver antennae the fuel tank has got a secret function it may break on the middle of the trailer therefore it has a hinge build in the bottom city fire mayhem and there´s no fire engine bag 3 long longer how long can a tiny truck be the pipe truck an unexpected buggy and the red racer 36 studs long the pipe truck breaks every convention the cabin is almost the same like the tow truck and the fuel truck and that is the good part of it the trailer has to carry pipes and is functional as well as it can commute sidewarts it looks quite unrealistic as well and you cannot drive this beast on tiny roads good for another crash but there are more cars in this bag now this was a surprise a buggy this is the only 6wide car but just because the wheels are large monster truck madness i don´t care for those cars personally a disappointment i would have preferred another racer  for variety though did i say another racer here we are the red devil great looking a real fast shape and red the best racer in this set vrooommm this is the most played with car of the set not only from me  as you may have noticed i didn´t put any stickers so far i don´t like stickers especially when placed over two or more bricks and here you are supposed to do it several times of course the cars look better with stickers on but they are also great without stickers only the fuel truck looks boring without my sons didn´t know there were supposed to be stickers and they didn´t ask for them so everything is allright here´s a closeup of the sticker sheet did i already mention it was 82 stickers  the only exception i made using sticker was for bag 4 bag 4 you go here you pay the highway toll booth the only immobile part of the set but great to brake though the barriers that is fun i only put on stickers on 2x2 plates where i had the idea to use those plates further on on different other mocs this looks a bit boring without the other stickers i admit but still no cut off to the playability there are also two ramps belonging to the set these only make sense if you are able to speed up the racers with the slammers and hit the ramps correctly i had problems with that so they are on the shelves now could be a lot fun making a contest though like this picture of the inventories frontpage all cars put together the usual leftovers all in all this is a great set to call ones own i did not regret buying it especially when it was 50 off even normal price would not have been too much build great for smaller children boring to afols 510 special brickscolors none all basics 310 design i love the tiny turbos´ size and design 910 playability 1 because of the slammers another 1 because no minifigscale but that is not the intention of the set still 910 pricepiece ratio dang it´s not on sale any more but if you hurry you could still grab one in the lego stores 1010 all in all 8510 and a clear recommendation it was and still is a set to play with your children the size fits perfectly to matchbox cars and that was exactly what my younger son did can you find all of the cars included in the set ps after buying this set i won an ebay auction with another tiny turbos set  8135 bridge chase this is even more fun i will soon care for a review with some never seen phototricks as well stay tuned edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0702 pm indexed	neutral
thanks for the review ill definately get this set sooner or later imo the tiny turbos are awesome i actually bought nearly every set so far built the models added the stickers and packed them away in ziplock bags in the attic sadly i dont have display room for them yet a fine set carwise dump the slammers and buildings into the spare bag and keep the cars kimt tiny turbos on	positive

my review gave you motivation to build a set my review was better than i thought	positive
skipper thanks for doing up all these sw reviews it certainly had given me some valuable insights on these sets especially on the snowspeeder it kind of making me regret to pass off this set however i had bought the hoth base instead but had never built it i am just wondering if the snowspeeder had any difference keep up the good work and always strive your best to make each upcoming review a better one	positive
i have mixed feelings about this set its one of the sets that sent my into a dark age the birth of my son contributed heavily when i first saw this set i was convinced that the earlier snowspeeder 7130 was superior in every way i liked the look of the 7130 version better i liked the coloration of it better the turret was better it used a webbed 6 x 6 dish after seeing this review i realize i was wrong on some accounts the cockpit is much more movie accurate the 7130 version had two separate compartments this version also came with a tow cable something that was lacking from the previous set while i still am unimpressed with the overall look of this set it is much less blocky which is always a good thing overall i still prefer 7130 to the 4500 version but the 4500 isnt nearly as bad as i first assumed and i regret never buying one of these when i had my chance	neutral
podracer not sure where you got that from i didnt have them out the set with treads is a dino 2010 thing which fits in well after a bit of modding also there are some of the old exoforce sets out there like the fire vulture because i always saw them fitting well with star wars	neutral
skipper 24 on aug 4 2008 1252 pm said podracer not sure where you got that from i didnt have them out i noticed the minifig between the grievous starfighter  the moddino2010 vehicle and it looked like a little person sitting in the pod of his podracer guess my eyes are playing tricks on me  my eyesight is shot  my wife keeps pushing me to go visit the optometrist	neutral
nope there is a guy sitting there hes there because on dine 2010 there were no guns like on dino attack so so i made a big gun like on the dino attack set i can see where you got the pod racer idea from now	neutral
ahem please get back on topic guys	neutral
skipper 24 on aug 3 2008 1109 pm said the minifgs on the box top they spelt dacks name wrong good set though	neutral
i really liked this set it was simple to build yet detailed and included three figures which was nice if only lego would do a few more hoth sets then we could make a real battle	positive
you have to love the originals well i didnt like the very first snowspeeder so this is the original to me i like it more then the new one that comes with the echo base beter color scheme and more realistic i think i got this set in stores and still love it to this day 	positive
good review i like it a lot nice job	positive
not one of my favourite sw sets kinda boring and the set is poorly designed imho we do get the general but thats not nearly enough thanks for the reivew and fine pics kimt	negative
i had this set £15 rrp actually  and agree mostly with your review although on the wheel bike itself two legs can be placed at the front end and two at the back to enable it to roll properly boga is very juniorised and the set itself is very simple and contains many large pieces the minifigures are good though i traded my gg however  just to offer my personal thoughts build 510 minifigs 1010 parts 310 price 710 playability 1010 overall 710  not an average tk	neutral
my brother had this set and i think it isnt the best set but great minifigs could use a star corps clone or 2 from the bp	neutral
7153 jango fetts slave 1 review parts 358 figs 2 price £2000 i got it on offer i think the rrp was £40 the only set to include jango fett and young boba also the decals on jango are from fine clonier im trying to say they dont came with the set 1 manual worn manual random page another random page looking at this page you can that this set has numbered bags back cover look how old yodas computer looks  2 general set and minifigs the sets contents jango with his hair on jango with helmet on with front view of face twist jangos head to initiate super bounty hunter mode jangos doubled sided head boba nothing to special although i think the torso and head are exclusive to the set 3 the ship not really scaled up right as you can see the guns can rotate the central sections interior not sure what this is is it a hyperdrive or a bomb or something there are these side panels on both sides behind the panels a secret compartment trans orange minifig heads in the compartment i think theyre supposed to be saturnic charges side storage compartment the back of the ship how those trans orange minifig heads fallout there is a magnet on the inside of the ship but for what the secret prison which also has a magnet on the top so it can stay on but easily come out the doors on it can lift up to put prisoners inside 1 of 2 identical wing things they can fold for flight mode the controls bottom jet thing let me out of here the prison is great for capturing small children 4 overall build 710 impossible to build without a hard stable surface minifigs 1010 2 exclusive figs design 710 nowhere near to scale but has some nice features parts 810 good parts like that big cockpit canopy price 910 for the price i got it was pretty good especially with the figs it comes with playability 710 lots of features but it would be better if it came with a jsf overall 910 lots of features and comes with exclusive minifigs edited by kimt 04 august 2008  1144 am indexed	positive
i have all three of the slave i ships and i agree with kimtalthough it is a very small compact ship the first slave i boba fett is still the sturdiest the newest slave i boba fett is not bad and is of much better construction than this slave i from jango fett even though i like the size and scale of the jango slave i and the newest boba fett slave iwhen you pick that very first one up it had the feeling ofyou can throw me against the wall drop me off the roof of your house or let 4 two year olds play with meim not gonna break at least thatss my opinion good review	positive

that was indeed a set that never appealed to me its build was just plain wrong and awful i only bought it because i found it on clearance at around 15€ and they had 4 of them if i had known better then id have bought all 4 seeing how much that jango fett minifig is worth now  but i ended up heavily modifying it in its propoions and now it looks ok next to the new slave one which is the best one of its 3 incarnations i think	negative
i got the original jsf for christmas which i might buy and review wonderful set the obi in this one is really awesome and its really just a great ship sticker free probably my favourite id fly it if any ship from star wars maybe i should get it and the slave i from episode ii after all i like jango despite having a crap story	positive

7261 clone turbo tank parts 801 figs 8 price £7000 ouch  edit new box pics added my version of the set comes with a normal mace windu figure and an extra clone trooper also the mace windu barc trooper and jet trooper minifigs were exclusive to the set well you could make the jet trooper yourself  also my set came with 4 extra blasters youll see them later and baby blue vent things instead of trans blue 1manual  box the front of the box the box compared to the motorized atat and the hailfire droid and dwarf spider droid minifgs the back which has pics of the sets functions and alternate models inside the box it has a white cardboard divider probably for strength seeming as the box it so flimsy pretty hefty manual the tt manual compared to the one of the atat ones random shot another random shot poster at the back of the manual 2 general set and minifigs the whole set i accidentally left one of the plates up when i took the pic close up of the figs two battle droids come with blasters and a mini turret the republic from lr jet trooper mace windu not lul barc trooper normal clone the commander look out jet pack maces torso barc trooper legs barc trooper torso he has got to be my favorite clone trooper by tlc the mysterious commander on lsw he was called cody right but he has star corps armour making him commander bly left  normal clone and the look out clone with electro binoculars 3 speeder bike side view of the barc speeder menacingish front view is menasingish a word printed back engine piece one of my shield things came with a crumpled handle it is worse than it looks in the pic 4 the turret the turret it can rotate and point upwards but what if you want to blast all those battle droids that are shorter than the height of the turret blasters add another hinge in that extra hinge in action 5 the tank its to big to get a decent side view pic johnny the cabin boy on the crows nest front 2 seater cockpit the 2 seats better be careful you dont fall off your seat there are some pretty big gaps down the sides back cockpit with dual missile launchers the back seat the engine the large central storage the turret controls fold down to lock into place so it doesnt fall out when driving you can put 2 minifigs up top mace and a clone driving you can see those 4 extra blasters 2 orange at the front of the pic and 2 between the chairs the turret and jet trooper barc trooper on the barc speeder the commander on the lift chair in the back cockpit another shot of that chair 6 overall build 810 quite enjoyable because it incorporates technic and system parts minifigs 910 on a set this size it has quite a lot including some exclusives such as the barc trooper but it could of had a droid or 2 more design 710 way out of scale but generally pretty strong due to the technic frame parts 710 lots of plates and nice minifig parts price 610 justifiable because of the amount of figs in the set playability 710 includes some cis units to fight the clones overall810 needs more droids and it could be bigger i will also probably have a break form reviewing for now seeming as i have just put out a whole load of reviews edited by kimt 09 august 2008  0851 pm indexed as 7261 review 2	positive

nice review again skipper i passed on this one because of the price but its a nice set good for you for getting the newer version with nonlul mace and an extra clone that purple blade sure is a beauty the tank itself is alright just an atat on wheels in my opinion the turret is great though and so is the speeder bike i didnt realize that the jet pack had two nailguns harpoon guns on it i thought that the nailgun was a new piece but the jetpack is very cool	positive
the kid on aug 4 2008 0820 am said i got the original version of this set with the luls mace windu figure when tlc released the nonluls version i managed to swap  they sent me the new version and a clone trooper iirc and i mailed them back the old version this was a great set the suspension worked great and it rolled magnificently nice review with good photos but again your price is a little off £6999 is the rrp unless the price you paid was £80 tk that was a great idea i never even thought to send it back and get the new one with the other clone and the non lul windu	positive
6701 space minifigures review set 6701 set name space minifigures released 1983 pieces 36 including minifigs minifigs 6 brickshelf gallery peeroncom bricklink bricksetcom introcomment as i reignited my love for classic space a few years ago i decided to start hunting sets i didnt have this small one fell into my lap very cheap with box and minifigs in great condition so now ive resized the pics and done the review and no i am not envious of this forumreallyim not the box the box is pretty neat it has a very comfortable size compared to modern boxes and the back of it shows what you get i like the way they tlg split the minifigs and arranged everything neatly front rear sadly the box has seen better days but its age taken into consideration i think its just fine the figs a fine collection of red white and yellow space figs some great accesories to go as well not much more to say except this was a great armybuilderset a true must have for most classic space fans the verdict its kinda hard rating this set since its a minifig supplemental set no design or colourscheme to comment on it has a lot of playability since figs will always come in handy when buildingplaying with your space sets kimt	positive
thanks for the review kimt i gave this above average i believe i had this one but it was so long ago im still a bit freaked out by the yellow ones when i emerged from my dark ages i kept thinking gee i miss the people packs but now that i have over 500 minifigures i dont feel that way anymore even so i wish they would rerelease some of the classic old ones	neutral
an ancient set revived from kimts collection just take a look at the box art this is one classic space minifig pack which deserve high rating and i gave it above average i never had any of these classic space figs before if tlg could ever released this again i am pretty sure i will grab multiple packs without a glimpse you need to build your space agentsastronauts with a little bit of accessories added to explore the unknown space i love this pack very much thanks for sharing	positive

pretty nice set but the newer minifig packs had greater variety in both the figures and equipment my favorite one among all of them is 6704 which is also the only instance of both blacktrons appearing in one set quote i wonder why this set had no blue or black astronauts whatever the case i always loved the small minifig sets that lego released as i could never get enough astronauts my favorite was the set of futuron astronauts i think the blue and black guys hadnt yet been released at the time of this set	positive

first thanks simonjedi for a great review im interested in what you think of the hydrolics i could spend hours just deploying and undeploying the wings and landing gear im a little worried the very first batch of the hydrolic piece for umm i think it was the offroad 4x4 technic set was very fragile and broke after a few uses these seem to be holding up but im anxious to see if they hold up after 100200 uses quote namewalter kovacs dateaug 4 2008 1147 am post337841 those black pieces used on the landing gear look very bioniclelike if they havent been used before id suspect they will be not that im a bionicle expert or anything quote right you are they are bionicle bohrok head pieces so pretty old in bionicle terms and fairly useless in my opinion but they do make interesting looking landing gear as i deploy and redeploy the wings and landing gear hopefully well get a pilot in the battle pack to help mitigate the fact we only get one here tohst	positive
thanks for the review ive added it to the index and added a poll in which members can vote their opinion on this set i think this is a very good set i like the colours and the very playable feature that allows the wings to lock in attack formation now all i need is to buy this baby edit i gave it an above average rating since its well designed looks sturdy and fits the sw theme sets perfectly	positive
great review simonjedi  i really like that you included lots of photos of your build i put together my v19 torrent last night and i was surprised by how heavy the completed ship is it has some real heft once its finished wow it is a really cool ship i was disappointed that the central wing doesnt really lock into place once it flips down it just kind of droops there so i attached a technic pin to the locking arm so it could plug into the 2x4 brick thats on the underside of the starfighter this brick can be seen in your photo of the bottom of the ship overall the build is one of the more confusing that ive seen i had to dismantle and rebuild the first engine after i realized id left out a piece and i kept thinking of the poor 7yearold that gets this set as hisher very first lego set ever	negative
thanks for this excellent review simonjedi  this looks like an awesome set and this is the set i am most looking foward just as well as the separatist spider droid 7681 	positive
the ability for it to fold in and out of attack position has wowed me this is my top priority now thanks for making up my mind	positive
hydraulic wings i am very impressed and am now considering getting this set purely because of this funciton i am just curious as to know why are there sand green parts on the bottom of the v19 is it visible when the model is completed i am also pleased to see tlc giving us a printed cockpit computer this time around	positive
skipper 24 on oct 11 2008 0810 am said in addition to my last comment am i correct in saying that the left over yellow technic part was merely to hold parts together while building yes i believe that the yellow technic is only used for the building however i didnt find it neccessary what a strange step	negative
i built mine today as soon as i tried to put it in attack position the thingy rotates the wrong way and it falls apart what a waste of 55	negative
actually we should care that theres only one fig in it since its kind of expensive though thats my opinion  but the ship is really awesome  its too bad theres not a battlepack that includes clone pilots edited by bricklanta 30 november 2008  0615 am	neutral

having just bought myself a copy of the wonderful metroliner 4558 i felt like doing a review before we start id like to thank greenhair for selling me one of his metroliners for a mere 80 euros granted the motor trainstation and tracks werent included but i did get an extra railcar instead   please note that i have included the fourth wagon in the final pic but that the official set includes just three wagons the metroliner was released in 1992 and was extremely popular amongst lego fans the set a picture of the box showing the set completely pic taken from peeron and one of the minifigs and the accessories as you may notice tlc was extremely generous supplying us with a grand total of 11 minifgs amongst which no less than 4 female minifigs ah the population crisis is finally over we also have three suitcases three cups and a small freight parcel and freight handling thingy normally this would include two bicycles a red and a black one a general side view of the three carriages thanks to greenhair and the brickster and heres one of the extra carriage thanks to greenhair and the brickster moving onto the front and back carriage which are externally identical please note that greenhair changed my back carriages headlights these would be yellow in the normal set all the doors in the entire set are printed pieces sorry for the bad picture quality in this one the interior of the two however is laid out a bit differently the space in the front carriage is occupied by a cockpit or whatever it is called in trains and some space to store your cable connecting the front lights with the engine i can imagine it must get quite cramped and dangerous for the minifig driver with all the cabling further back we have a quite random weird looking engine one part reminded me rather of a jet engine on a commercial airplane the engine is accessible by means of the two side cargo doors at the end of our first carriage we hit what looks like the trains restaurant two tables and no chairs the two middle carriages are identical both have a small sink nicely hidden from the intervening and impolite looks of fellow passengers the carriage further contains two tables and four seats two cargo spaces are nicely tucked away from view below the tables our final carriage has a back cockpit as well but differs from the front carriage in the central cargo area  where our train employee is hard at work earning his lego nickels  and the rear sleeping area the bed is a double one the upper one able to be flipped up for somewhat difficult access to the lower one the train station i could not take photos off since it was not included in the purchase judging from the building plans however i feel it was thrown in at the end just to add something to the set its construction is very simple consisting of a few grey plates on top of a few pillars access is provided by a plate which is connected to the platform with a few hinges there are however two lamp posts a timetable and a few chairs so if you dont like the platform you can still use these parts in a variety of other constructios to end off i took a pic of the complete set with extra wagon and a friendly surprised train driver opening the door and greeting the camera man conclusion being a 90s set the train basically builds itself the entire build cost me two hours and a half i lost quite some time simply admiring the set and was extremely straightforward with no suprises at all but i need to admit it has its charm the exterior is simply amazing the sleekness of the design the colours it matches perfectly i believe however that a width of 8 studs would be more to scale but 6 wide still looks amazing the interior is somewhat simplistic but is easily moddeable with a few extra pieces i basically bought the train as a parts pack the standard set three wagons includes no less than 8 train doors with windows 14 train windows 4 smaller longer ones and 4 freight doors the front and back of course count as unique pieces as well one feature i am displeased with are the printed doors i like printed pieces and while the bluewhitered stripe looks beautiful on the side the printed doors kind of limit mocing capabilities to carriages with a stripe on the side i considered simply removing the stripe but i found out i could just get normal grey ones from bricklink for a fair price i am very pleased with the train but since you already know my opinion feel free to tell us yours of this fabulous set edited by thebrickster 09 july 2009  0151 pm poll question was not multiple choice switched to radio group	positive

oh ruben you lucky so and so this set is one of the most beautful i have ever seen splendid looking build and 11 figures all the same faces like but still you get that old woman pigtail head piece which is just great i thought you meant the monorail set when you told me about this but guess i was wrong dont laugh ive been away from lego for quite some time and for 80 euros it was a real bargain from a great friend really nice review hope this sets brings you years of joy	positive
cool review i actually have two of these i got one for christmas when it was rereleased in 2003 and another one in a charity shop a few months later for €5 i love the minifigs even if they all have smileys and having two sets of them can really fill up a town	positive
its great to see someone reviewing a train this set is definately a five lego hasnt made a complete train set like this in a long time the metroliner is really a legend among classic trains the great level of playability and detailing makes it a terrific model specifically i was just noticing the details of the passenger car it has a sink  how cool is that and 11 minifigs  when was the last time lego included 11 figs in a single set a truly outstanding train set thanks for sharing images as ive always wanted to see it upclose it would be awesome if you could share some single side shots of the cars	positive
im not normally that big into trains but this set has a real coolness factor that sets it apart from most of the others the color scheme is the same one that amtrak and many local subway systems use i picked it up along with the club car expansion when they were rereleased in 2001 i have made various modifications to mine rearranging the car layouts and adding a second train motor into the rearmost car along with another set of lights so that both ends light up as you said it would be great to have an 8stud version of this so you could fit in two rows of seats side by side that might make a nice mod project at some point	positive
nice review i collect all metroliner i can i have 3 metroliner and when i can i buy a other  my aim  have the more big metroliner collect in france  in first time  its my favorite set	positive
ahh the good old train theme how i wish tlg would make such great trains today now that the quality of city sets has improved so much that really brings back memories even if i didnt have this one but a cargo train that came out about the same time period maybe plus a few years i dont have any trains myself at the moment mostly because im afraid i havent got enough space to put in on display with all the rails and stuff	positive
this is a great review of a great set hairy ruben i voted for outstanding since the only thing you can say about this train set is that it is outstanding it has been the best passenger train in all the time from legos beginning on until now i bought the rereleased version of it in 2003  and i really really do not regret it klausdieter	positive
i also voted outstanding for the simple reason that ive owned this set for a long time but for most of the time its been an anonymous heap of bricks mixed with all the other bricks i have so about a year ago i started rebuilding it and it now sits proudly next to also rebuilt 2150 on my shelf imo its an excellent set best of the 9v passenger trains no doubt and it combines the best of the 80s trains with that of the 90s  its not some futuristic panoramaglassed lowslung train but an honest realisticlooking train that captures many of the features that passenger trains used to and in some cases still have	positive
panda9001100 on aug 16 2008 0737 am said only strange they named it metroliner in holland when we speak of a metro i need to think at short distance trains only used in big cities like rotterdam it was only named metroliner in the us because of the color scheme is similar to the reallife metroliner i believe in eu it was called the euroexpress and probably just passenger train wherever that would be suitable the productnumber 4558 is universal though hairy ruben you dont have a review of the doubledeckerclub car on the way do you i myself never got it and i am seriously considering buying one from bricklink plus it is moreorless an requirement for this train one of very few doubledecker cars to actually stay within the general outer dimensions of the train	neutral
my favourite favourite favourite old set its too bad i was born 2 years after its release i would have had a major interest in classic town i might actually get this one on bricklink not that itll go for a good price ill only buy if it does you see an outstanding a highly useful and wellmade set that really just stands out from its counterparts edit nevermind edited by dovchenko 16 august 2008  1025 am	positive

i never got this set i spent a long time after one christmas trying to get and failed miserably admittedly i was much younger then it has however remained one of my most sought after items but i’ve still never got around to getting one the set generally makes me rather nostalgic for a time when the trains were painted in simple liveries like that one anyway it seems an excellent set from what i’ve seen and the figure selection is amazing i hope lego produce something as good as this when the new trains are released next year	positive
thanks for the review hinckley i love this set i still havent renewed my bm subscription but im sure i can find this on ebay or bricklink and what an addition this would be to my army edited by vbbn 05 august 2008  0132 am	positive
nice review i would like to get this set unfortunately i dont get brickmaster mag and the prices on bl ebay will most likely be ridiculous i wonder why indy doesnt come with his murse man purse in this set thats the best part of the fig the jeep itself is very nice especially with the dark green by the way what is frown brownish something i guess oh yeah and funny comic	positive
i really enjoyed getting this set in the mail its such a great small set and a good example of how smaller vehicles can have great details on them too the only drawback is that i didnt get another satchel for my various uses for them	positive
thanks for the cool review hinckley when i saw the picture originally i thought it looked good but not that good but seeing the pictures in your review i love this i voted it as outstanding because it has great parts and a brilliant construction ingenious perhaps sirnadroj on aug 5 2008 0230 am said simply put id have to admit this is one of the best indy sets i agree its so sad we europeans cant get it	positive

this set easily is above average for me i had this as a little child and whenever any of my relatives came to visit us they brought me some lego usually it was either this set or 6844 the really nice thing about this set are the alternate builds for the low price you got a nice range of parts and cool ideas what to build with them you could build a fleet of rovers or the alternates and everytime it was huge fun 	positive

i voted below average since im not a big fan of classic space	negative
thanks for this review if youd only know what memories you brought back i think i remember this set better than any other i had when i was a child some time after i got it i decided to disassemble it and combine it with the jeep from 6552 rocky river retreat it came out pretty good though as it became the main attraction point of my town beeing the car of my favourite minifig back then and and and looong story  i kept it assembled that way from this day on until earlier this year when i finally disassembled it because i needed the parts edited by metalandi 06 august 2008  0357 am	positive
this is by far my favourite outback series set i loved the fact that you can bend the bridge in different directions so that the suspension of the car really worked to keep the car levelled like you placed it in your last picture i had lots of fun with this when it came out eleven years ago in 1997 the bridge scene could also be used in the adventurers serie of 1998 classic highest rating buy it if you dont already have it	positive
great review brickster why exactly did the outback adventure etc themes never quite catch onjust a thought what a great set i wish i had it but in 1997 i was just back from my whirl wind trips around the world and had drifted away from lego i dont know why but i will say this i love the actual suspension that came with this set and the trains sets i have been trying to buy up as much of it as i can and now i see i need to add one more set to the i need to get that	positive

thebrickster on aug 7 2008 0406 pm said at leat you were able to pick up two of the sets do you still have them andor the pieces yes i have the parts the manuals and even one of the boxes unforutunaltey the parts are mixed in a big pile of parts as i never had any time to sort out my parts you can see i used the yellow doors here decals applied the great thing about the copter was it had 2 suitcases which as far as i can tell aint a common part not rare but still nice to have and it had the guy with the green jacket the winch wasnt bad either the only flaw was it was a standard lego copter meaning similar ones where avalible in quite a few sets do you plan to review it staudie	neutral

oh i loved this set when i was young i think i got it for my birthday and it was one of my favourite sets at the time funnily enough i was thinking about it the other day and how i really should build it again thanks for the nostalgic review	positive
ok this is the big one the controversial one the one everyone either hates or defends what do i think read on the figs bandana man masked dude dude with shades good figures i miss scarface comes with his torso though which is my favorite the one with the ammo strap across the chest one figure short of the figuretoprice value but we can deal with that the dino the dino its the one that comes with the chopper in green any questions the tank and so it begins i think it looks a lot better in person than on the box the left side good time to mention that the treads run pretty easily and this is a very playable set right side keep an eye on that flap in the center  and we have a folding ladder the back probably the weakest point of the set apart from the dino the turret turned and tilted the mechanism works extremely well and the gun seems to work better than others for some reason or maybe it just seems that way the front of the cockpit im at a loss trying to figure out how those tiny windshields defend them against 40foot mutant tyrannosaurus rexes with radioactive breath laser eyes and what have you anyway another one of those neat steering wheels some viking horns and some stickered control panels oh yeah this set has a good amount of stickers probably around 20ish the back of the cockpit i love the little gun it turns 360 degrees and tilts up oh yeah and those green barrels theyve been using are awesome i can think of tons of uses for them the verdict 7610 playability 9410 pieces 7510 figures 8810 dino 310 value 410 the main downfall of this set is the price i would easily pay 30 for this no questions asked but 40 was a hard sell for me  i gave in merely to see what i would think of it and also to help you guys find out the same this is a great display set and a great play set the pieces are good  lots of nice blay beams used in the construction but the price people thats the killer pick this up only if you have everything else or you find it on clearance and thus ends my dino attack review series hope you enjoyed them until next time bloody jay	neutral

sam89 on aug 5 2005 0133 pm said thanks for the reviews once again it looks like qite a nice set to me although the european version will lose the big gun i like some of the stickers although i wish they were printed and i actually quite like the dinosaur i probably wont get it though the set im most likely to get is the fire hammer yay some one that agrees with me 	positive

this is my first review so i thought the smaller the set the better 6626 snowmobile year 2000 subtheme arctic pieces 20 1 extra note polybag 6577 is the boxed version price €1  sh on ebay misp mint in sealed polybag building time less than 2 minutes if it came out in the last months if would be called an impulse set it actually came out a few years ago being those my dark years i missed the arctic line now that im back into business i wanted some but not all of the sets were good or easily available i had the chance to buy this one and i0m happy with it as you can see below it consists of a figure on a scooter the only accessories are those chainsaws that lie on the sides unless you take the skis from the scooter and have the minifig wear them the extra piece is a transyellow 1x1 round plate according to brickset and peeron the difference between box and polybag is the sticker sheet you choose whether the nose is better with or without the sticker id say with the judgement its cheap it has a cool minifig with a cool head accessory and a nice torso i dont think i like that orange colour that much and i cant understand why those blue pieces have to be blue i guess its beacuse the whole line uses blue with orange but i have to say this is definetely a good set id give it a 4 out of 5 in its category if you want to own at least a set per every theme this could be your arctic one packaging content minifig i hear you ask whats that yellow thing on the left leg dust or something alike the snowmobile edited by the cobra 07 august 2008  0233 pm	neutral

emergency evac set  6445 theme town resq year released 1998 piece count 97 minifigs 1 list price 8 usd in 1998 lego introduced a new theme called resq the theme was really a quasicoast guard subtheme of classic town the theme included boats helicopters emergency vehicles and even a water hovercraft most notable was the black and yellow color combination that predominated the sets i only picked up a couple of sets from the theme including this emergency evacuation vehicle that i consider a van i never got into the theme but looking back at these sets i have gained a better appreciation for their value in classic town lets take a look at 6445 in greater detail starting with the box the back of the box providing a few alternate models and similar imagery on the instructions the set includes one small sheet of decals for the van 6445 has one resq minifig that i find pretty nice i like the neon orange reflectors he has a nice printed backside with the word resq prominently displayed this little set includes an abundance of tools a black walkietalkie is not pictured heres the emergency van i like the back section that has a nice winch with turning wheel and a few hooks for tools heres the minifig pulling the grappling hook for some resq action this is my favorite part of this set the van isnt too fancy but has some neat features while i like the blue windshield piece for maybe space sets im not really fond of its use for the van the van has no steering wheel but rather two levers for steering on the top of the vehicle are two emergency alarms and some extra lights the back of the van has a large opening piece that allows wide access to the back section it comfortably fits a long gurneystretcher heres the driver resting on the gurney he should never have tried to pick up the gurney without a 2nd resq minifig and a shot of the back section without the gurney lastly a picture of the complete set final thoughts resq is really a neat theme that has great play value for kids while its not one of my more favorite town subthemes it does offer some nice pieces and an abundance of black and yellow pieces i think a few of the resq sets go nicely with the divers theme released one year earlier in 1997 i had a chance to purchase the largest set of the theme 6479 emergency response center at half the price but passed back in the late 90s id be interested in finding out what other eb members think of this set and the resq theme	positive
i am a proud owner of this set like others i got it discounted and couldnt resit the parts pack this is the type of lego sets that bothers me when you look at it now youd be tempted to say hey not bad but at the same time some years ago it wasnt good enough to buy it full price i was kinda disappointed because usually sets using that kinda baseplates are excellent castle paradisa and this one is just ok one really minus point would be the lack of any opponent faction in the set	negative

set 7680  the twilight theme star wars year released 2008 piece count 882 price aud14999 or 15999 if you buy at tru 9999 euro us9999 pity the twilight when rumours of the set name first circulated speculation was swift twilight  that suggests something sleek elegant and mysterious anticipation mounted fanfrenzy grew finally a pic leaked and the verdict was clunkadunk it appeared that in the jedi offseason anakin was running something that looked like an intergalactic garbage scow like roger wilco in the old sierra space quest pc games blocky and bley seemed to sum it up the set went from being one of the most anticipated to one of the least liked of 2008 pretty much instantly its a mark of that dislike that in the eb clone wars review feeding frenzy nobody has so far even bothered to post a few pics of this set even 2 weeks after its official release im here to redress that imbalance now and find out if 7680 is as horrendous as everyone originally thought part 1 box  parts front of the box its quite big same size as the 10144 sandcrawler annoyingly its the old style with the perforated corners that you have to tear to flip open the lid detail of the back showing set functions interior of the box  a lot of wasted space the set comes with 2 instruction manuals each 76 pages and no dss sheet polybags 13 of em like the other cw sets these are unnumbered parts ahoy you can tell at a glance that this set is comparable to the atte although there a large proportion of the 800 parts here are technic pins and bley plates part 2 minifigs and build the set comes with 4 figs or 35 depending on how you look at rotta  anakin ahsoka r2d2 and rotta very disappointing that theres nothing new here for such a highpriced exclusive although i guess it is maybe movie accurate anyway to paraphrase the wise patsy stone you can never have enough hats shoes or new anakin ahsoka hairpieces so its not too bad pics of the build in progress a quarter of the way through we can already see that this is one of those convoluted technic frames with some plates affixed type builds halfway and the smaller wing is added at the three quarter mark the giant single wing is added and voila done the final quarter is a race to attach all the exterior surfaces and details such as the engine and escape pod the build itself is a mixed blessing it is very technic oriented im not a technically minded person and dont really have much of a conceptual grasp of how everything functions until i see the final result so i find these type of builds a little uninteresting pins axles and beams give me bricks any day i really liked the 7676 gunship and the 7679 fighter tank although they do contain some technic framework they are largely brickbuilt ships especially the fighter tank which is solid largely brick built and full of neat functions the 7680 build is one of the most technicy builds ive ever undergone in a system set akin to the experience of building the 10178 motorised atat but whereas with that set you could understand the need for a technic framework the thing walks a lot of this seemed excessive yes the twilight does some have nice functions and it is so large and heavy it does need a strong skeleton but to me it just seemed too much and aesthetics have been sacrificed for in some cases limited functionality i will discuss in more detail what i mean as i look at different parts of the set on the upside this is the only nonsymmetric set in the cw range so at least every page and new step brings something different part 3 a closer view closeup of the main body of the ship fronton it is welldesigned how the figs appear in line of sight unlike the 6211 where jabba and leia were photoshopped in to the box art dont ask what rotta is doing out of the line of vision there some things are better left unsaid side view showing escape pod smaller cylinder and drive top view rear view showing back door the rear deck is huge indeed the whole ship is huge oddly so i dont know if this is moviescale or not but ive seen people complain the fighter tank is too big  and that set is nothing compared to this baby its wider than the gunship and in wingspan and length is almost bigger heres a few pics next to an mtt for comparison pretty big hey turning to the dark side must be good for business even if all you can buy is a rusty old beast like this at least you could comfortably squash pretty much every vehicle in the opposing fleet just by landing on it at least now you can see why it costs so much the official pics make it look smaller somehow by truncating the rear and wing the ship is in fact so big you cant really pose it with wings open  only hold it that way i was too lazy to build a giant transclear support strut so propped it up on a shoebox instead the wing opens very neatly  you push a technic lever and a pin holding the bottom wing pops out quite smoothly the little top turret can move up and down as well to get the full crossshaped effect part 4 features and functions the front cockpit folds down very neatly although i find the build here a little weak whee it goes all the way down to the floor the mechanism is cool but it takes up an awful lot of space basically the whole front is cockpit and all lego could manage for controls is 2 printed 1x2 tiles as well not pictured here but theyre attached to the part that folds up and down theres also no way for anyone to get in or out of the cockpit and an invisible windscreen technology has come a long way side view looking from wing r2d2 is here as well as some tools you can also glimpse here one of the main problems with the set despite being a huge boxy ship theres no interior none the twilight doesnt even have an internal floor all the room inside is taken up by the landing gear which folds up  again a clever function but it really gets in the way of the set as a whole kudos to the designer for coming up with stable working landing gear but too clever by half if it means that this giant ship ends up basically being one tiny cockpit and a rear door at the back that doesnt lead to any interior underside showing landing gear when open and closed  when the wing is folded down the gear is locked in place which is pretty neat spaceconsuming but neat the rear section the door when opened reveals an orange cupboard and a towline as ahsoka uses in the box art the door clicks into place when open and can be released by pressing the technic bit at the top again clever but pointless as you cant get inside ahsoka can indulge in a little recreational bungeejumping if she so wishes the rear deck is so large that it is wasted just being used so ahsoka can bungeejump i came up with a much better use for it outdoor garden despite having one roboticised hand anakin was still quite the green thumb and his lightsaber was very useful as a hedge trimmer so much so that he set up a side business between rottarescue missions heres a promotional postcard a few other bits and pieces the gun turret on the enormous megawing can only hold one flick fire missile at a time you do get two though  rear engine detail the escape pod sits neatly on the side and is basically built the same way as the gunship bacta tank the pod sits on these tehcnic pins and is held in place by the light bley parts part 5 in conclusion the twilight is a huge ship with a huge amount of great functions  folding wing folding cockpit rear door escape pod retractable landing gear but this functionality comes at a price  a very complex technic build and zip interior compared with the gunship for example which is stuffed with nooks and crannies the twilight suffers in this respect i also think it is just too large  it doesnt really fit with the other craft and vehicles released with the clone wars line i may be wrong and it is movieaccurate but when you have all the cw sets laid out it does stick out like a poor thumb part selection is ok with the only interesting things being a few dark orange plates the orange cupboard and the big transneon green radar dish dont get me wrong i dont think this is a bad set at all its just the other cw sets are so sweet i would say its an above average set in a field crammed with excellent ones if youre a completist buy it but if for example youd rather invest in another atte to upgrade your republic army then i couldnt really disagree with you either and to finish on a light note id like to remind you that you do get another ahsoka hairpiece which can be used for all sorts of things ugha warrior upgrade dr inferno hair transplant and finally attack of the deadly blueringed octopus native to australias beaches and oceans thanks for reading	neutral
really awesome review sveltecorps  you did a really complete and indepth review of this beast and with your nice pics is really enjoyable reading your review so congrats  i like this ship even if it looks so bulky but i need to buy first other sets so maybe this beast will be landing in my collection the next year or this one if i am lucky  i can just ask for something can you post a pic of all your clone wars sets together with this one all the sets in one pic not many pics with this an each set  please  edited by darkrebellion 12 august 2008  0220 am	positive

wow certainly much bigger than i would have thought thanks for the great review and pictures  well for some reason i was drawn to this set but with the lack of interior and quite a bit of technics i think ill pass or at least get the atte first thanks again	neutral
hopewell on aug 11 2008 1124 pm said i read the visual guide recently and learned a bit more about the twilight i wont get into spoilers but it seems that the ship becomes a sort of endearing family van for the characters which is neat big bulky uncool but it gets you from one place to another if it factors into more than just the 90 minute film i may pick this up it seems that theres room for a lot of personality in this ship once you see the film it is a corellian freighter smuggling spice for the hutts thats cool right lol the minivan of the galaxy  what a selling point if i am really impressed with it in the film i suppose that would change things but i will have to see 	positive
oh no anakin has gone over to the green side of the force well i guess someone had to review the clunkadunk eventually and you did a good job at it svelte corps i liked the punchline with the ahsokahairpiece swapping the ugha warrior upgrade is an interesting way of creating male togrutas and ahsoka looks even hotter with infernos hair matteo kenobi on aug 11 2008 0930 pm said if i am really impressed with it in the film i suppose that would change things but i will have to see  i wouldnt count on it spoiler after its first flight the twilight will crash and burn wookieepedia says so and you can see it in one of the trailers so i guess the twilight will stay mostly unbought poor clunkadunk	positive
thanks a lot for a very nice and entertaining review your photos were really nice and there have been some reviews lately that have such blurry pics cough cough it was a pleasure to see you can 1 put lego bricks together 2 write a review 3 handle your camera i think this ship is underrated it is really nice i love the playing features like landing gear and back door perhaps just cause i had to get along with so called landing gears in the past that did not work at all 7140 for example and i simply love that there is space inside you said there is not really some cause of the landing gear mechanism but it seems it should be easily fixed do you think there is enough space to put some plates over the landing gear and add some beds kitchen und tv i think this set is so perfect to mod it into a clone wars mobile home your back garden ist just perfect for this i prefer this over the atte and over a 2nd gunship thanks a lot for the review	positive
zzz on aug 12 2008 0900 pm said and i simply love that there is space inside you said there is not really some cause of the landing gear mechanism but it seems it should be easily fixed do you think there is enough space to put some plates over the landing gear and add some beds kitchen und tv i think this set is so perfect to mod it into a clone wars mobile home your back garden ist just perfect for this it does have that homely feel there is room inside with technic beams to lay plates etc on the only issue is that its kind of fiddly to access you could do it from either the side door or rear door though maybe move that tow line at the back i have to say it is a set that grows on you	positive
thank you sveltecorps for the review i like the inside nice and cosey i also like your little garden for me this put the twilight different in a better perspective than my first perspective of the twilight i voted outstanding greets theforce	neutral
i will not be picking this one up the main thing is that it simply looks akward it is big and bulky and seems to have random pieces on it with not reall streamline feel to it i also agree that for an exclusive that it 100 it needs more than just 35 mini figures anikan and ashoka and rotta already come in the atte which is cheaper and has more figures r2d2 is a figure that i am sure everybody has at least 4 or 5 of for that kind of money i expect something with at least one unique figure and more than 4 i also want just a cleaner and better designed set this is probably the letdown of the collection so far every collection needs one	negative
seems like tlc has done a pretty accurate representation of the ship the real fault for the ships messy design has to go to lucasfilm not tlc my guess is lucasfilm is trying to recapture that what a piece of junk magic of the millennium falcon i guess well have to wait to see the movie to see if they succeeded or not the idea of a space mobile home reminds me of the winnebago from spaceballs great review informative entertaining and opinionated so many people shy away from stating an actual opinion in their review for fear of offending anyone whats the point of making a review if you dont state what you think about it	neutral
sveltecorps on aug 12 2008 0219 am said hmm dior i can smell it now the ship doesnt look too swooshable but then again more than the heavy rgs i really like that review svelte corps so much detail unfortunately i would only get this if it was a very low price like in a sale	neutral
thanks for yet another awesome review quote seems like tlc has done a pretty accurate representation of the ship the real fault for the ships messy design has to go to lucasfilm not tlc my guess is lucasfilm is trying to recapture that what a piece of junk magic of the millennium falcon i guess well have to wait to see the movie to see if they succeeded or not this sums up my opinion exactly i can easily admit that the design of the kit is spot on  but unfortunately the actual design of the ship in the new movie is garbage actually despite the millennium falcons odd design i really think its a pretty appealing ship  and its really cool i cant say the same for the twilight though	negative

having plenty of time on my hands this summer i did some reviews yes im aware this has already been done but ill just do it once more no harm there set 5615 set title the knight price 299 euro  349 usd pieces 21 yes a whole 21 bricks release 2007 the box a neat little box that has a great size for dropping into your shopping cart for once tlg didnt shove the bricks into an oversized cardboard box  the knight this is a great minifig though he looks a little unsatisfiedmight be because his head isnt put on all the way a great army builder fig the only thing that i find a little annoying is that the collar isnt completely rounded it looks too much like an animation and lefthand work the weapon rack yes thumbs up for this plate mail sword shield and jousting helmet plus the spear and open helmet on the fig so many great additions to put into use bring it on pesky skeleton army the all in all verdict a great set a little too expensive compared to the crossbow attack in which one gets 2 knights and a skeleton plus bricks for 549 euro  599 usd but still a great army builder set and the 7090 set does not have the same knight fig kimt	positive
very good set indeed the possibility to alter the knights appearance hugely boosts the value very smart thinking of tlc got one of these so far but if i ever do a castlerelated comic or animation this will be the set i buy tons of	positive
argh what i was typing kept getting deleted by my stupid keyboard on topic this looks like a great little set i could use a few of these but i havent seen any at a local store too bad for me i suspose  great review and i like the green plate on the bottom never can have too many greens for my small but expanding swamp im building hope i can pick some of these up eventualy	positive
time for another of the great castle sets and yes this one is a great army builder set as well d set 7090 set title crossbow attack price 529 euro  599 usd pieces 54 release 2007 the box and as the other two sets reviewd so far 7009 and 5615 this one has a fitting box that is too easily snatched from the shelf and put into your shopping cart  not sure its a great thingtoo expensive in the end d the crossbow attack cart the cart is a neat little build that actually works and for once were not given that awful technic launcher but a buildit launcher it actually works just fine for its purpose the addition of two crossbows makes it worth buying never can get enought weapons for the evergrowing crownie army the figs oddly ive not taken any pics of the figs and therefore ill illustrate using the sh pic the figs are great i love the silver helmets and in this set you get 2 crownies and a skeleton plus a white skeleton horse thats a lot of figs for a set this size a true army builder thumbs up for that the all in all verdict another small yet super set in the castle theme i bought several of these to make a fine little army its cheap and often found on sale i can hardly resist buying it when i see it kimt	positive
this is an awesome set in my opinion i scraped my crossbows for mocing recently but the set is still an amazing army builder for the price for the sw battlepacks which have 4 minifigs and a cheap vehicle you get 4 knights  this is 2 sets to equal the price of a bp  2 skellys and 2 skelly horses plus 4 crossbows 4 good wheels and some other good dark blue and brown pieces for my ever expanding castle town great buy	positive
and another set enters the scene set 7009 set title the final joust price 829 euro  799 usd pieces 62 release 2007 the box and yet again tlg has put the bricks in a box that somehow corresponds with the amount of bricks in it the castle theme has got well designed boxes  the whole set build 2 knights jousting fence and weapon rack the weapons rack another great addition of weapons flail halberd and skeleton scimitar super weapons for those close encounter melee battles fought when tipped off the horse  grinp the jousting fence not much to say its a fence simple yet it serves its purpose very well the crown knight gotta love that guy he looks like nothing can hurt him he even got a selfsufficient smile on his face im sure hes convinced that no skeleton can defeat him also the horse its barding and the headcover looks awesome a great old school sword and the ever cool normannic shield what could possibly go wrong for this knight the helmet i really love imo its a lot better than the old knight helmets see review of 5615 the knight for a pic of one of those the skeleton knight the black skeleton horse rocks i love that design and in black its even badder than than the white version the shield reeks of dread and the knight is one bad skeleton on the rampage i do find that the helmet is a little off id rather have a black knights helmet instead the kk helmet doesnt really do it for me the all in all verdict this is another great army builder set it holds a lot of great weapons some cool minifigs and great pieces the only thing that puzzles me is why would a crown knight joust a skeleton doesnt really make sense kimt	positive
ive been waiting to hold this set in my hands for about a year and a half thanks to a silly tlc decision 7009 was not available in italian stores i finally decided to buy it on the net 2x  plus some other sets and those morons at the custom charged me quite a lot after i bought it while waiting for it to arrive i found out it was available in a store in switzerland not far away from home thats for the storytelling as for the set i thought it was great and still think so a good army builder as quite a few sets in the 20072008 castle line and a time traveller 6021 being my first lego castle set ever rating 55 edited by the cobra 13 august 2008  0904 pm	positive
lovely set nice collection of weapons cool horseaccesoires for the white knight cool black skeletal horse on the dark knights side loving the printed armours of both knights and as opposed to kimt apparently i really dig the black helmet i feel theres a lord of the ringsflavour to it with those curves well designed	positive
another small set my local target doesnt have they dont have the best castle selection they only really have dwarven mines and castle seiges ill buy this if i see it there though because it looks like a great little set i could use the awesome knight and a skeleton that has a regular body so he looks like he is in armor	positive
i should really get one more of these for the figures shields and weapons this set is the only one with the scythe in pearlgrey by the way the only thing that puzzles me is why would a crown knight joust a skeleton good question for a joust to make sense this set should contain two human knights instead  which would be fine with me so long as they had differing armour and colours edited by tenorikuma 13 august 2008  0351 am	neutral
kimt on aug 13 2008 0500 am said the quality of the set feel free to comment on the review andor set also thanks  the set is average its useful for picking up a few knights but im not really partial to the skeleton the idea of a knight and a skeleton tilting just strikes me as being odd my biggest issue with the current castle line is that most sets force you to purchase a mixture of skeletonsknights orcsknights orcsdwarves etc this is fine for those of you who love your fantasy however it makes the line a bit underwhelming for the rest of us still as mentioned earlier the set does have an upside so it is worth a purchase the review on the other hand is aces with great photos and a detailed description of the set and its contents nice work	neutral
you know what i think this set has charm lots of it im not a big fan of castle having very few sets all of them spanning different nationsarmies but i couldnt resist this set and while not obvious at first it really is backwards compatible with every castle set with a horse in it nonetheless i think this set is great its simple cheap and has charm thats good enough for me plus it has that fantastic grinning knight and the black skeleton horse those just made it better	positive
tenorikuma on aug 13 2008 0348 am said i should really get one more of these for the figures shields and weapons this set is the only one with the scythe in pearlgrey by the way except its just plain darkgrey you must have gotten this set mixed with another though ive never heard of a pearlgrey scythe	neutral
perhaps he meant the pearl light grey lance which is not that common	neutral
brickzone on aug 14 2008 0742 pm said perhaps he meant the pearl light grey lance which is not that common could be its not that uncommon its in several sets now red is uncommon	neutral
good review kimt pictures are clear and show each of the pieces in great detail i agree with your comments as well im a bit curious does the knights helm have a hole for plume ive been debating whether to purchase this set or not im not a big fan of horses so ill likely barely use them but i do like the unique minifigs weapon rackweapons and the fact that the divider has a few useful pieces that can be added to other sets however i just dont feel the set is worth 8 when compared to crossbow attack and the knights catapult unless the buyer is really wanting some mounted minifigs luckily amazon just lowered their price of this set from 8 to 6 along with another 20 if using bill me later just in case anyone was also in the same situation i was in at that price its damn well worth it	positive
first things first the knights helm does have a spot for a plume now i really like this set and it was the first one i dug into when i got my collection in the mail it has a great selection of equipment for good or evil figures and the barding for the horse is outstanding my only wish was for one of the long chrome swords for the knights i think the new knights with the tall shield and chrome sword look excellent on foot and on horseback it would definitely be neat to revisit this set with another human knight instead of the skeleton make that change and add a lady to joust for and itd be bang on	positive
indexed name holiday villa theme lego system  town year 1988 pieces 197 minifigs 2 price usd  there were quite a few sets in the 1980s that werent sold in the us i remember reading once that it was because they contained wine glasses and tlg felt they wouldnt be able to market a toy that encourage the drinking of alcohol this set was one of them i remember seeing this in a catalog that came with a fabuland set and wondering what it was and where i could get one i wrote to lego and got an overseas catalog which had the futuron 6990 monorail transport system in it before it was available in the us i was amazed i ended up buying 6349 holiday villa from that catalog but for some reason gave it to my best friend for his birthday ive always wanted this set and finally bought it from bricklink this year my purchase included everything except the box i really like the boxes but in lieu of a boxshot here is the instruction manual i imagine this was the image on the front of the box the parts one of the things that appealed to me about this set is its abundance of rare parts this base plate is an excellent piece and was only available in two sets classic lego telephone technically these blue windows 1 x 4 x 5 windows are only available in this set according to bricklink it was available in different form with and without fixed glass trans blue glass in other sets regardless this size and color window is rare and the blue door was only available in 4 sets this was a huge selling point for me as im a window monkey never heard that term its like a parts monkey a collector who buys mulitples of sets just for parts or large lots of bulk from bl and sorts them into bins but just for windows tell your friends i coined the term these sloped windows have endless possibilities in many themes maybe not with the curtain decals applied but are another great rare part that appears in this set the build remember this piece id like to see a badass agents car built on this car base  i am a fan of the sixwide car but i see the appeal of the four wide it has a very nostalgic feel to it theres no denying that this is a beauty of classic lego 4wide cars this set comes with two minifigures one of which appears to be a painter classic vintage lego figs onto the house which begins with the basic floorplan a kitchen thats open to the rest of the house and a little oven and hood vent is one of my favorite touches its one thing to throw an oven into a house set but the designer of this set made it a cool part of the architecture of the house which gives it a unique feel the completed first floor and carport i do wish the sides of the roof were white with a little overhang like an actual roof this method of white on bottom red on top looks more like a childs drawing than a real house this is easily fixed with some modifying still you get a lot of roof pieces in this set here we have the completed set the husband cleans the yard while the wife gets plastered on wine dont tell the american kids another angle working in the kitchen getting smashed before dinner i think she may have a serious problem the bedroom a little stark but the bed looks comfy overall shot of the interior rating playability 910 the possibilities are endless with drunky mcwinewine and husband really playability is up to the imagination of the player its a house not really very actionpacked design 9510 great design with plenty of rare parts love the classic car too loses half a point for the all red roof price na i believe this was inexpensive but since i have no proof i will have to leave this factor out of the overall rating overall 92510 classic sets like this all deserve 10s in my book but looking at it with an objective eye its excellent but not perfect	positive
thats a great review of a great set hinckley i voted for outstanding  this set is simply amazing i regrettably dont own this set since its very hard to find on ebay andor the stickers are missing but nevertheless i hope that i one day will be able to get this awesome set  or even better  see tlg releasing a new city villa in a style similar to that brilliant set  klausdieter edited by klausdieter 13 august 2008  0630 pm	positive

great review id give this set an 8 at the least its just a tad too simple for my liking but other than that it looks great while im a 4 wide car man i actually think this car looks rather horrendous the main body seems way too low in comparison with the windows the rare parts however do make up for it hinckley on aug 13 2008 1123 pm said yes yes in the states horrifying and deplorable violence is fine but drinking and swearing sends kids directly to hell somehow i feel like watching south park now  that was such a good episode	neutral

this is my favourite house which i owned during my childhood although its in the crypt but i hope to build it back one day looking at your review makes me so envy of you to own a complete set the baseplate is very unique especially for its stoned pattern classic lego telephone is just so lovely especially when its printed the entire house layout is simple and very nicely constructed in fact the simplicity just showed how much lego could do with such parts there are many nice furnitures included in this set such as the little ovenstove dining table bed and car porch the little black car is a classic example of a true 4studs car i love this house very much and my verdict is a full 5 no doubt about it thanks hinckley for this lovely review	positive

i wish i could find this set some day including the right baseplate some of my house mocs are styled after the classic 6349 and sometimes ive rebuilt it after instruction scans exchanging the baseplate i dont own one of these with 2 at 16x32 each and this city house out of an older thread of mine its offensive that ive used styling elements of 6349s just enlarged in terms of interior details not much but still enough for classic town i voted outstanding mfg widdi edited by widdi 09 october 2008  0122 am	positive

this would be great for any pirate fan the extraback pack for the soldiers some spare owes for the row boats a female face for a wench and a rather simple raft for that unlucky pirate lost at sea over all a nice set i am a little confused by the dynamite though perhaps an easy way to go fishing or perhaps to clear a rock in the forseen future or is it that she is just a suicide bomber attacking the white house water joke not ment to be tasteless or offensive to those lost in the act of terrosim greatest respect to those who have lost loved ones great review regards cpt pb	positive

glad some of you like this set for the wide variety of good accessories it seemed some are unfavour of the rafts design well i think for an impulse set the rafts design is quite good at least it took care of the color scheme well its just a simple raft for the adventurer to move onto the river stream and throw some dynamitte to blow some obstacles away cpt pegleg blockbeard on aug 14 2008 0329 pm said this would be great for any pirate fan the extraback pack for the soldiers some spare owes for the row boats a female face for a wench and a rather simple raft for that unlucky pirate lost at sea your comments make me feel like i has just done a pirate review instead of an extreme team review	positive

aerial recovery set  6462 theme town resq year released 1998 piece count 201 minifigs 3 list price 25 usd my personal favorite of the resq theme released in 1998 was this helicopter 6462 aerial recovery the set offered a pretty modern helicopter raft threewheeler rescue gurney and net and three figs including a diver the set is actionpacked and offers a high degree of play value starting with the box front side and back front back i always liked the rough oceansea water pictured in the boxart the same image from the front of the box appears on the cover of the instructions but the back of the instructions picture a plain view of the copter one sticker sheet with a few resq stickers is included mainly for the tail section of the helicopter interestingly the set includes three figures one being a diver what i always found strange is the inclusion of an xtreme team diver who has the logo on his torso although its a very nice fig back shot i think this was my first set with a lego threewheeler i always liked it a lot the set includes a yellow raft also found in the divers sets and some scuba gear note the raft has a black piece in its center for lifting up by the helicopter for sea and emergent rescue a gurney can also be lifted by the helicopter the set also includes a net with hook to lift the threewheeler and other items an extra string pulls the net closed heres a shot of the helicopter the front section has a large trans blue piece enclosing the cockpit inside is a printed radar slope a smaller trans blue piece appears a bit higher for access to the middle section of the helicopter andor a small storage area in the middle section is an place for the gurney and a box for storing some of the adventure gear heres a picture showing the gurney on the side is a pulley mechanism that swings to the right when not in use on the opposite side is the winch to raise and lower the grappling hook heres a picture of an open storage box i like the tail section with propeller decal is not shown heres another shot of the copter from a different angle and the final image the entire set final thoughts personally i think this is pretty nice set i like the thought of using the helicopter to rescue people at sea using the working winch extras like the trikethreewheeler and the rescue net make the set even more fun hope you enjoy this resq review	positive
thanks for this review thebrickster i also have this set and think its one of the best helicopters tlg made in the 90s its quite big and has got place for 2 minifigs in the cockpit i also like the fact that theres a victim included in form of the xtreme diver which also is a theme i always loved as a kid do you have any other resq sets left to review it would be an honour for me to also do a review of one or more sets which are left but unfortunately i got not much time at the moment	positive
cool then i think ill do a review of 6451 river response later today or tomorrow stay tuned	neutral
i got this set as well as a resq hovercraft this set is cool because of all the accessories and it come with a x team guy your set is also in much better condition than mine you have made me decide to rebuild it another great review thebrickster keep up the good work	positive

this helicopter is so cool and i agreed with you that this is a high playablity set its not common to see such a big scale helicopter which has two cockpits back then the color scheme works well for me with so much features such as the lowering of the grappling hook storage box storing of the gurney and etc one thing which can be improved onto the helicopter is the rotors it could be extended a little longer as the size of the helicopter is too big it makes the rotors rather weak as it is not able to support the weight i am confused why there is an extreme team personnel there i thought he was supposed to be recovered from the resq team although there is so many questions in my head such as why include the black tricycle bike extreme team and etc but this is still one very good set to play with too bad i had never seen this before somehow through your review i like it very much the only big scale helicopter which i owned is the 7738 coast guard helicopter and lift raft neverthless i gave this a 4 thanks brickster	positive
thanks for the review brickster i do own this set in its original form the only drawback that i have noted previously is the lack of rotors and the cobraesq of the copter body i wish it had a larger fuselage but i still have it and i still like it despite my criticismwhich i am sure is in my eyes only thanks again brickster i wish i had bought some of the other res q sets but of course i only bought three	neutral
i stopped collecting lego sets in the early 90s because of this kind of sets ive always been a classic town fan and i really didnt liked the futuristic design of tlcs newer sets	negative
i think the set is too unrealistic i like the new resq sets better and im somewhat a lifeboat freak so im always following such a sets with interest i would like to see some rigit inflatable boats some day  but about the chopper i like the accessoiries	negative
what exactly makes you feel this set isnt realistic it has got nothing what wouldnt be on a real helicopter imo and for the futuristic design yes it looks modern but it works and actually most of todays real helicopters also dont look like in the 70s anymore	positive
it took quite some time but now im finally continuing with city reviews this one beeing about a really good set of the resq theme and also one of my favourites of this theme it brings a lot of playability and an incredible amount of useful pieces even with only 145 bricks in complete set nr 6451 name river response number of minifigs 3 number of pieces 145 release year 1998 price 20 usd back then when it was new unfortunately i havent got the box of this set anymore but the instructions are still there in good condition we get 3 resq minifigs in this set from which i really love the detailed torsos a shot of the complete set with both the boat and the little car off board the before mentioned car is really really little but it still got enough space to transport 2 minifigs a closeup of the rubber dinghy the speed boat as standalone as already said before this set brings a big count of equipment and accesoires with it which is really good for a set this size in the middle section of the boat there is enough space for a minifig to sit in and put on his diving equipment and last but not least a shot from the whole set wirh everything attached at the front section you can see a wench which also adds a lot to the set when i got this set back in the day i was really happy about it and for sure spent a lot of tie playing with it because of its great features as the wench in the front of the boat or the car the boat can transport i hope you like my little review stay tuned for more in the next days edit i forgot the poll can sombody add it please i dont know how to do or if it is possible to do that myself edited by metalandi 15 august 2008  0359 pm	positive
this set was my first set ever from the resq series and i loved it entirely ofcourse i modded it slightly here and there after hours and hours of fun and excitement it has great play value even for a set in this size	positive
if you still have all the parts try to rebuild it youll see that its a great feeling	positive
very nice review this is another set which i had never seen before when i am in my dark age quite an useful set especially with the accessories and the minifigs torsos the speedboat is able to hold the car and the rubber rescue boat how can the driver steer this boat with so many things blocking the way i cant seemed to find its control though thanks for doing this review	neutral
nice review i collect castle too and the ghost isnt really rare i have one too but its not really found anymore so it would be a good thing to keep it anyway great review edited by mammymarf 15 august 2008  0848 pm	neutral
about the rarest one up there is that black ninja i only have one ninja and he is dark grey i also have five samurai the witch may be fairly rare but i am not sure i didnt really collect much in the fright knight era	neutral
very nicely done  this cart is a striking resemblance to the crossbow cart we got in 2007	positive
nice review i agree with thok it’s quite similar to the more recent crossbow attack though this one has the added benefit of two shields this set would i fleet be more useful to army builders than most of the modern castle sets even though many people don’t like frightknights	neutral
quote even though many people don’t like frightknights i dont really like fright knights either i just happened to have this set	neutral
looks great and the figures up there are old and kinda rare i dont really like fright knights though so i probably wont get this set	neutral
this is a pretty nice set i really like the torso and its genericness so it can be used for other factions and at least this set has 2 shields althought i prefer the triangular ones instead of just 1 shield you get from crossbow attack from the wrong fraction id have liked a crown knights shield 100x better some improvements for this set would be a normal bow and a sword instead of 2 of the 3 crossbows smaller wheels and triangular shields 45 from me actually 35 but ill round it up	positive
i gave it above average it was a nice set and included some nice pieces but it is only an impulse set after all edited by newright 19 august 2008  0106 pm	neutral
originally shared in the history  adventure forum for its adventure attributes heres my favorite of the outback collection first let me say that this little set is one of my alltime favorites because it can be used to sumplement a number of different themes 1 the set makes a great little adventure airstrip for adventurers and more recent the indiana jones theme see also german headquarters and port adventure ive also used the set as an addition to my wild west town the tan baseplate and windmill works great just subtract the plane modern equipment and figs and lastly as the set was intended as an outbackdesert airstrip set description outback airstrip set  6444 pieces 157 minifigs 3 release date 1997 original price 20 usd starting with the box and the backside notice the alternate models i love the swamp boat the building is my favorite part of the set it is simple has a little detail two great roof pieces and a single green window great piece check out the great windmill piece its my only one and makes a great part for wild west and that farm you always wanted to build i used it for the barnhouse of barnabas higgens and spring valley ranch on the side of the building is a great radio and a clear glass unfortunately no furniture can be found within the building and now the airplane front view i love the twin propellors side view and the rear section the back has a small cargo hold for some boxesfreight or some gear needed in the outback the set includes three figs two with cool shades and some great equipment i love the boom box a shot of the whole set and another summary as i mentioned above this set is very versatile and can suplement a few different themes its my personal favorite of the outback collection and im really glad i was able to find the set in the late 90s i almost didnt buy sets like this are timeless and so much fun to build and display hope you enjoy the review edit additional reviews review by agentrick57 december 24 2007 outback airstrip review in history  adventure forum february 10 2008	positive
great review this set has cool features i just wish that lego would release this as a lego legend and release it to australia too since this is a set about australia i wouldve bought two if this were a lego legend that is how good it is i like the building with latticed window and windmill i also like the cargo airplane windsock and radios plus it looks like its got great minifigs	positive
this is really an ideal small set in spite of its size it has nearly everything • three minifigs • a vehicle • a building • numerous minifig accessories • numerous rare and useful parts • nice model design especially for the time period too bad outback came out during my dark years	positive
the building is great and detailed with a few mods it could be added to my castle town i dont really like the plane though seems kind of abstract not really good in my opinion but i bet it would be easy to mod to look better	positive
one of the best in my humble opinion as far as i know it was never released in the uk so the only reason i managed to get my hands on it was on a family holiday to the us i think they’d only recently opened the lego store in disney arguable the best feature is that it seems to fit into a wide selection of themes is it a airstrip in the middle of nowhere is it next to a only mining town that’s not deserted the possibilities are rather open and that’s truly great	positive
i have had this on my bricklink wanted list for ages and yet noone with my criteria has it nice review and brilliant set	positive
set 7103 theme star wars set name jedi duel pieces 74 release 2002 price 10 usd minifigs 2 count dooku and yoda links 7103 brickshelf folder bricklink reference catalog peeroncom introcomment i remember getting this set solely because i collect star wars as i rebuild it and took pics of it i found that i actually like this set for different reasons dookus speeder is pretty cool and the lightsabre rocks the dooku minifig is also great whats not so great is the flythingy and getting another yoda though thats kinda hard not to get in a set focused on their duel you cant see the wires because they digitally removed them be careful or ill digidally remove your head  steven seagal i hope i quoted that one right  so to get the review on the move ill impress you all with a box picture neat huh one of the smaller boxes but still kinda big when consider that you only get 74 pieces and 2 minifigs the instruction isnt that big as i said the dooku minifigs is awesome i love the print on his torso that combines the brown cape with the torso and also the head is neatly designed not a fleshie though this was before the fleshlicensefacelift a sideview of the light blue speeder mmmm that crome light sabre hilt is nice the design of the speeder is also ok and without the usual offcolourscheme bricks no tan or yellow sticking out there yeah id panic too if this came right at mewho wouldnt when noones driving and a rear shot i think the design is a little off the shields makes it all a little too open in my opinion the printed bricks are a kick and thus evens the score here this hideous design is meant to flip yoda around the air put him in this funfair from hell thing and give him a twister he and dooku will never forget my guess is that its there to add some playability but its just odd and quite useless much like the playability soccer thingies in the ultimate light sabre duel the verdict ups and downs this set offers both i rate it as average since the size and price of the set make it acceptable to have odd things confused good so am i making a small set isnt that easy and remeber this set is from 2002 and a lot has happended since then designwise that is what do you think	positive
whats wrong with another yoda and some nice light blue bricks i probably would destroy this set and keep the minifigs intack tough chrome lightsabers on	neutral
thanks for the review kimt oldies reviewsold sets  are always appreciated i feel this set isnt that great 1 yoda he is by far the best part of the set although is his weapon blue 2lord tyrannus pretty nice i feel the middle part of his torso is a bit bland but that isnt a problem i wish they would make a fleshie one too 3 speeder bike i always hated this design the back looks terrible to me way too bulky in my opinion it jusnt give me the image that its the same as the movie the lightsaber is amazing why is it only in this set 4yodalifter what that is terrible but at least it has some nicely colored parts a fine set but not the best imo	negative
you think its not a great thing that we get a yoda fig in an affordable set like this that was the main reason why i got this set and what do you mean by another wasnt this the only one that was ever released except for the one in the dagobahxwing set sure he is not the best fig with the unmovable legs and all but still its yoda besides he doesnt move his legs a lot in real life either nice review though and thanks for telling me what that liftarmthingy was meant to be for i never got that and thought it was supposed to lift up the speeder for some reason i got two of this set and the printing on those blue parts were off in the second one i got edited by oky wan kenobi 18 august 2008  0845 pm	positive
nice review i realy like this set two nice minifigs in an affordable set and i do like the speeder but that lift thing is strange but now at least i know what it is thanks for letting me know	positive
thanks for the nice review kimt  i like this set especially by the fact that it is the only set containing the dooku minifig and the curved lightsaber  i also think that the minifig is cool but i also own the dagobah xwing and the wookiee catamaran sets so i have enought minifigs a clone wars version would be very cool  and the extrathingy is well just ok the bad part is that i dont buy the set when it is out and now is go for 40 on ebay and bricklink  edited by darkrebellion 18 august 2008  0951 pm	neutral
oky wan kenobi on aug 18 2008 0241 pm said wasnt this the only yoda that was ever released except for the one in the dagobahxwing set sure he is not the best fig with the unmovable legs and all but still its yoda edit im pretty sure we got a yoda in the wookiee catamaran set from revenge of the sith runs to check brickset yep theres a yoda in that set as well but the jedi duel is the only reasonably priced set with the green forceguru nevermind looks like a couple of other members already covered yodas availability in other sets back on topic great review and a real blast from the past i never did get this set just didnt care for the speederbike or the weird piece of equipment thanks for explaining that its supposed to be used to forcejump  spin yoda all over the place i never knew thats what it was for anyway wish i had known yoda and dooku were going to be impossible to get later i mayve picked this set up just for the minifigs edited by bamaker 18 august 2008  1039 pm	neutral
i missed out on this set but it looks pretty good imo thanks for clearing up what that thing was i thought it was something they flung at eachother in the movie i like the lightsaber also but why did they stop making chrome ones	neutral
i missed this setbut i reallly like the yoda and count dookui especially like count dookus lightsaberone thing thoughis it me oris yodas lightsaber blue in the picture edited by pr0visorak 20 august 2008  1221 pm	positive
i was very lucky to get this set and i love it i dont have it built cause i bought it for parts but it was fun while it lasted 	positive
great review kimt at that time it was still in my dark age and i hated myself not to get this set earlier this is quite inexpensive and you are able to get two greatest characters especially count dooku the minifigs are excellent especially the unique design of count dookus lightsaber i have no problem with the speedbike as it looks quite alright to me as for the elevation of yodas jump adds some playabilty but that does not work well for me nevertheless the main attractive factor is count dooku and i have to rate it a 5 i never own a yoda except for the magnet version	positive
i know we have another review of this set but since i just got it i thought i would share my comments on it set name droid gunship platform number 7678 pieces 329 price 2999 before we begin i will say that i like having a droid gunship but i still hope we get a maf hmp droid gunship maf droid gunship on to the review here we have the box it is really shiny and smooth and fits the sets size okay it has a clean bright look and is truley outstanding the back of the box which has the features of the set as well as the other three cw sets the contents the siticker sheet no to bad and the stickers have clear backs which is always nice instructions here we have the figstwo new droids and one older armed droid for the cockpit and the extra parts the build starts with the flat base pretty simple the bottom the side lasers next is the head it starts pretty soild the side buble laser turrets loveing the detail on the ship the lid and eyes the finished cockpit cozy interior would have had more room if it were the maf though the front landing gear simple and effective the back landing gear the rockets the clips are annoying but it make the rockets work so i guess it was nessecary mounted on the bottom not very secure but thats why they are meant to be dropped on the clones the finished ship  let me say that the droid gunship is a nice set indeed final rating 86 hope you enjoyed the review please if you have a ny questions pic requests etc then by all means ask best regards vbbn	neutral

it took a long time but now here it is the review of the xtreme team set 6584 extreme team challenge thebrickster asked me a few weeks ago to do this since he unfortunately never owned this great set so here we go first i have to say that i really love this late 90s town theme and i wish there would have been produced more sets this is the only one i own well beside that i also still have 6572 wind runners but the car is missing anyway lets face the facts and let the pictures speak for themselves subtheme xtreme team set nr 6584 name extreme team challenge number of minifigs 4 number of pieces 354 release year 1998 lets start off with a few quick shots of the box  instructions inside of the box we got some ideas for alternative models on the backside the same ones are also on the backside of the instructions instructions heres an overall view of this huge set we get 4 minifigs each with different heads and color patterns which i really like and also a good amount of equipment for them lets move on with the cool vehicles there are 3  completely different ones in this set first is the neat little trike next the not less neat 4wheeled offroadthing dont know whats it called really  and finally the huge monster truck i love the chrome sidepipes and the wench with the hook in the back which adds a lot of playability oh i almost forgot our brave adventurers also have got a raft to ride the wild mountain waters now lets focus on the many details of the mountain base we got a bridge over troubled waters but be aware its very unstable love the wood patterns on the yellow 1x6 tiles on a corner a camera is mounted to document the wild life for the evenings we also got a little campfire down by the river sits a grey falcon and watches the guys on their challenges whats that seems not very safe to be honestbe aware when you pass by these rocks cause it will collapse lets move up again where the tent is placed inside is plenty of space to take a rest for the figs and to store their equipment but i think they should have built the tent on another place cause the ground isnt very good there when you pull the mechanism a trap door opens will the guys all come back home safe and not injured you decide all in all this is a really great set ome may say it is a bit juniorized because of the baseplate but it really isnt its got a lot of playability and some rare parts the biggest beeing the baseplate which is only available in this set i hope you liked my review let me know your opinions edited by metalandi 23 august 2008  1256 pm	positive

cool set i like the tent and monster truck the most	positive
thank you for that very interesting review metalandi a cool set with a lot of features and some nifty vehicles very playable and well designed indeed perhaps a bit too colorful for my likings but pretty impressive in its conception for sure i wish we could see some more landscaping coming along with todays vehicle sets as well	positive

when i first saw this review title i thought it said rapid river review thinking it was an indian set 6766 nice review though i never got into rock raiders i would have loved the large drill bit piece for set s 4970 and 4940 this set looks like a little boulder hawler and a nice set to introduce someone unfamilar with the theme i esp like the fig and the little 2x2 drill bit tile the overall set looks like it has some very useful miningtype pieces nice review and thanks for sharing	neutral
i have never seen this set before but the minifig head would be perfect for a solid snake from mgs 2	positive
rock raiders was the shit back in the day awesome theme i had this set as well as the tunnel transporter which was amazing	positive
i always thought that this set was underrated it contains a really interesting collection of parts a decent fig and introduces an odd theme in only one set very well designed for one of the not greats god bless nathan	positive
easily one of the best town sets ever and pretty expensive for its size too iswas it that rare i hope i still have all the pieces from mine unfortunately my stickers are in pretty bad shape took them off because i needed the bricks stupid stickers covering multiple parts  only downside to this set the design is simple yet so detailed and the pizza van looks great 55	positive
i do like the set although i dont own it i do remember lusting after it when i was a kid though mainly because of the female minifig and the colors its a bit simplistic but comes with a few great parts you also did a great job on describing the set and the pictures give the full impression of the appearance for the review i just have to point out a few things to give you constructive criticism first of all its chef not chief entirely different professions and secondly the scale you give in the poll isnt very even above average jumps to outstanding which is a too big of a gap in my opinion you shouldve used good or great in between them but these are only minor faults this is a good review anyway	neutral
jopiek on aug 24 2008 1048 pm said a very good set indeed we have at least 3 of them but we like them all what do you mean by we you own three sets of the orignal 1994 series or the 2002 legend series	neutral
got this one as well not much surprises in such a small set but the fastfood pizza idea is pretty cool as far as i know only the small mcdonalds promo and this set are related to foodrestaurant thing until the cafe corner that is but since i have a classic lego city i cant miss this set	neutral

this set is great and so is this review i really like seeing reviews of classic sets like this and hope to see more in the future the chef in this set is the base for my sigfig in fact the classic sets have a totally different feel to them than the newer sets they look more human great review	positive
i remember having this set when it was originally released a good few years back but i dont think i have it anymore i remember i thought it was really awesome though i thought the oven and pizza storage in the back of the car were the greatest parts the little sink on the inside was cool too didnt realise they had made a legends set out of it id love to own this set again but misb examples on bricklink go for an extortionate amount of money ah well se la vie	positive

indexed allright hi everybody again today im gonna review the biggest set of the resq subtheme 6479 emergency response center with this one i think the reviews of all the resq sets are complete now and while im in a reviewing mode right now i thought id bring that up this set hast got many nice aspects and also some very rare pieces and comes with a wonderful amount of vehicles including a speedboat a tow truck a helicopter and a trike which can pull a little boat so sit down get your popcorn and beer were off to stormy weather at the coast subtheme resq set nr 6479 name emergency response center number of minifigs 5 number of pieces 420 release year 1998 unfortunately i dont have many of the boxes of my resq sets anymore so ill start right off with the instructions this time on the backside there is no alternate model as usual this time but only a different shot of the whole set next a general overview sorry about the slightly bad picture quality on some pics this time originally this set has 5 minfigs which all are really nice but the guy who drives the tow truck has been lost in the flood heres a picture of the missing fig lets move on to the vehicles we have something for the water the ground and the air in this set first the great tow truck i love the mechanism with the hooks in the back next on da speedboat at the rear its got a stretcher and a wench which adds a lot of playability if theres a a little accident near the coast the trike comes to appearance for more complicated stuff we have a little helicopter i broke the rotating piece at the top yesterday ouch   no space for a victim you say well not really but the helicopter also got a wench with a hook in the back now it comes to the station itself at the docks a neat life belt sign is mounted remember at this time there werent real ones as today a little more right an equipment holder is placed with various tools on the front and fire fighter equip at the back at the very front a little lighttower secures the shelter i havent quite found out what this thing is supposed to be maybe somebody knows another equipment holder this time with all the stuff you need for diving more equipment and even more we come to the hear piece of the station the control room with lots of buttons and scrrens last but not least a quick shot of all the accesoires and tools that you get which really is an amazing amount this set might have a few junioriced pieces as the big window in the front or the briedge on the roof but that doesnt matter because there is nearly one other set in which you get so much rare pieces and such an overwhelming amount of accesoires so i can recommend that for everybody who is a piecesfanatic not to forget the playability the great figs and the in my opinion very good color scheme once again thanks for taking the time reading and looking at my review i hope you liked it edited by thebrickster 31 december 2009  0919 pm	positive
do you mean this one httpwwwbricksetaspxset29621  i would also like to get that alone for the fact that its the only resq set with a female fig	neutral
i have this set and its pretty nice i love the resq theme in general i think that tow truck is easily the highlight of this set and is probably the best such vehicle ive seen in any city set the other vehicles are also great the base itself is lacking though as it basically consists of one room that doesnt even have side walls it does include a cool 3x6 computer sticker and a vast array of minifig tools and equipment though i have some plans to modify the building and make it larger but have never gotten around to doing it	positive
i just built this set in mlcad as a requestfor a fellow eurobricks member somehow i missed out on this set completely when it came out i was really suprised how long it took to build virtually despite its size this set is packed with details minifigs vehicles and tools thanks for all the pictures gif xml 6479 emergency response center edited by missouribb63 31 december 2009  0932 am	neutral
thanks for that very elaborate review nice to have several pics from different angels amazingly well done if this is your first ive added a poll and will index this review within this week along with all the other topics i am to index 	neutral
yes the review is great indeed i love indepth reviews with tons of photos as for the set  im not planning to buy it but it looks ok i think its a good tank	neutral
wow this is one great review fantastic pictures this looks like one cool set with heaps of neat functions a shame it doesnt include exclusive figures like ahsoka and captain rex in the atte or plo koon and asajj ventress in the gunship but you cant have everything so again thanks for this sweet review peace	neutral
bad quality pictures whats wrong with them this is a great review and thanks i was planning on buying this set and no others but the price stunned me thus i bought the atte and the rgs the set is better than i thought though i might do as mutley did and make my own	positive
baby i will like to take a moment to said outstanding piece of review for your first attempt you have done well with the pictures and its flow i have to admit that i love this fighter tank very much the downside of it which is overpriced and two clone troopers do not really justify the purchase well if i have the spare cash i will defintely get one of this keep it up	positive
thanks for the really cool review baby  i think this is an awesome first attemp for your first review it flows well really good pics and many pics  in the set i think this is a good purchase i will buy it when it comes out in the us and i think it is cool looking and the fuctions look neat  edited by darkrebellion 26 august 2008  1112 pm	positive
wow this ship is really big judging from the size of its hull wondering where can i keep it when ive bought it 	positive
but does this mean that they add to the piece count is it a super secret clever way to make the piece count seem bigger than it is hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm  addition ive built it review up later tonite but heres this to wet your appetite	negative
its a shame it only comes with two figs it would be great for my ancient middleeast project	negative
thanks for the pics so far will you have highres pics of the other sets in the instructions	positive

woohoo thanks for these pics im probably more excited about the dark red 1x4 arch than anything else i have a large project that im doing in dark red but there has only been the 1x6 arch made in that coloruntil now now to figure out how to score about a hundred of them  jeramy	positive
right so heres my review finally the whole gallery of box parts minifigs and finished model is here over 2 pages so on with the show minifigs httpwwwbrickshelycgii1340864 in the set you get krakaroff i dunno how to spell it and victor krum the figs are exactly the same bar their heads these are two fantastic figures the expression on krakaroffs face is priceless judging by the design i think we might get a yellow krakaroff cropping up somewhere which would make me a happy bunny hed make a fantastic viking ideally id have liked more than 2 figures for my money three would have done it i think 2 is too few piece count httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344573 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344571 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344572 for a 40 set the piece count is quiet good i dont know the exact number but when building it i didnt feel short changed bar the exception of the hull now i dont hate the hull my problem is that is doesnt connect with bricks like the old pirate ships there are pros and cons to this on the plus side its more secure and your whole ship doesnt need to be taken up with support structure the negative side being you cant really make it bigger as theyve only released a megablocking 4 set with the right piece and its the wrong color i also like how its wide meaning you can fit loads of minifigs on the main deck overall though i liked the pieces of note are gold studs httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344510 5 in total you get one spare the return of the black falcon shields httpwwwbrickshelycgii1340835 and the new drumstrang shields the construction a simple fun build nothing too fiddly the finished model httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344474 big picture i really like this set theres no bones about it it seems lego with the latter half of 2005 have given people who loved their original pirate ships hope for the future with this and the fantastic viking longboat even with the two 4 pieces the hull and front of the ship i wasnt put off httpwwwbrickshelycgii1340841 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344461 the front of the ship is a nice piece and can be used for stuff like castles httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344490 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344491 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344492 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344494 and the hull isnt all bad what i really liked was the little cargo hold at the moment i have a treasure chest in there but there space for about eight of them i reckon playability wise it does make alot of sense and as you can see you can imprision minifigs below deck httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344484 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344488 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344506 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344500 the quarters are great as well you can comfortably fit about six minifigs in the main gally three by the steering wheel and a couple up above the top cabin you could fit more but itd look strange my only gripe is the design of the top cabin when you want to open it up you have to remove the mast i know its simple enough but i think that it wouldnt have taken much for tlc to design it better but saying that its easily done and i like how the cabin can be lifted with ease from the steering deck httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344540 the final play feature is the plank you can while away the hours murdering hapless minifigs whove displeased the cabin a really nice addition for pirate fans the final verdictb playability 9510  lots to do for all the kids piece count 910 a great selection loses one for the hull figures 810  just needs one more construction 910  nice and simple value 8510  let down a bit by lack of minifigs and the cons of the hull boverall 8810 overall this is a set worth getting especially if you miss proper pirates it wouldnt take much to turn this into an amazing pirate ship moc hope you liked my review matt	positive
burnsexcellentburns i love those parts shots great stuff in there this really is a good sign for the new line hopefully therell be the same level of usefulness in the others thanks for taking the time to finish it up did you scan the back of the instructions	positive
i received this set with a 25 gift card so it was a great buy it follow with a similar build to the 2007 trucks but has a few improvements of course the name of the set could have been a bit more creative and yes this was an academy review set name truck and forklift number 7733 pieces 343 theme city year released 2008 price 2500 usd 1999 gbp 2400 euro 1box now the box follows a design similar to most other city sets it has the set information and photo of the set on the front sorry for it getting cut off i will remake it now the back of the box shows what each bag builds bag 1 is for the forklift bag 2 is for the cab and bags 3 and 4 are for the containers it also has the sets features 2contents the instructions there are 2 books included with the set one for the forklift and one for the truck minifigure1 the first minifig you build is a simple cargo worker interestingnew parts here we have some interesting and new parts they include a yellow seat a 1x2 plate with clips and a 1x4 slope 3the build cargo1 the first cargo palette has a few crates on it i really like the sticker on the small box forklift the forklift is a very fun extra to build and it is probably the best forklift that we have had so far it is very realistic and is very strong cargo2 the next piece of cargo is some octan barrels on a meter i am not sure what it is supposed to be but it is still a nice addition to the set minifgure2 the second minifigure is a classic driver with sunglasses and a coffee mug very nice new piece this is a very nice new piece that is included in the set a hollow canopy i believe it is also in white with the police mobile command station truck now anyone who has had one of the lego city harbor sets from last year then you will probably find this build to be very similar mostly in the cab part of the truck the trucks build is very solid and very realistic i sense ths will bring the ratings up quite a bit mystery cargo for some time specualtion has been going around what exactly is this it seems like nuero poison i am very happy with those 2x2 cylinders in transyellow in fact you can join in and guess what it may be in this topic containers the first container is built to hold one palette it fits onto the truck it produces a very pleasing result and has a better look to it than the containers from last year had the second container has the ability to hold two palettes and has a design similar to the first then you build on the wheels the back ones have beautiful mudflaps finshed set  parts 1010 lots of useful pieces great colors and some very cool new pieces minifigs 810 i would have liked another but it was 25 so i guess its okay price per part 1010 almost 350 pieces for 25  playability 810 forklifts are always fun and there are lots of things to do with this set overall 3640 90 a this is truley an outstanding set and it will make a great addition to anyones collection mocers would aslo like this due to the fact that it has some really nice parts it has a great build and utilizes some awesome new techniques it also has details something you might look for in a set highly recommended hope everyone enjoyed the review if you have any pic requests questions etc please ask i look forward to hearing your comments and the judges comments as well 7733 peeroncom 7733 bricklink catalog 7733 shop at home	positive

thanksfor this review i also got this set recently and im very happy about it i live the design of these new trucks and the forklift is also great not to forget the good amount of cargo btw i think the mysterious cargo only are normal fuel barrels	positive
a very fine set indeed and something at least a little different to the more usual city sets sweet and it could even be a little sweeter to me with car doors well nevermind thanks for that very nice review vbbn	positive
great review i dig this set it could have only been better if it had been a 6wide version of the old 6367 semitruck still i ask whats so special about the special edition	neutral
the cobra on aug 27 2008 0958 pm said still i ask whats so special about the special edition hmmgood question lets hope our reviewer can help us out here	neutral
nice review vbbn i stumbled upon your yellow seat as well didn´t you have one already or what made you think it´s new the big letdown on this set is the big canopy i would have preferred single bricks for that and for this truck there is no real need for a hollow canopy  it could as well have been made of solid bricks maybe we get another set with different use of the canopy this is one of the reasons i didn´t buy it so far and i´m especially not interested in another forklift i have plenty of those i agree it´s the best one we have seen so far though	positive
today i shall be reviewing 8290 mini forklift which i recieved when i went to tru to get a technic set so enjoy set name mini forklift number 8290 theme technic parts 89 price 1099 1box the box for this set is suprisingly small its about the size of a 399 set it shows the main forklift and the set information the back of the box features the dragster a very cool model and the suspension works perfectly 2contents we have two instruction booklets one for the forklift and one for the dragster the bags here are a few interesting pieces the long double pin in blue a bionicle connecter joint and a yellow l joint 3build we start off build nice and solid with your average technic build the following steps build up the detail of the bottom part next comes the cab its pretty simple yet effective after that comes the forks they work very well but if you have the palatte on them and you let go it might topple off hint put the edge of the palatte on the small lip on the pieces that connect to the forks this will hold it on better the finished product and palatte extra pieceskeep them as they are used to build the alternate model here is something that i found how to put a minifigure into the cab first remove the side doors then set the fig into the cab with his arm sticking slightly out the gap and finaly seal off the cab a nice way to put system into technic for your towns  parts 910loving them all price per part ratio 810somewhat pleaseing playability 910 works in any system town and has a great dragster alternate model overall 2630 86 b overall i would definatly recommend this set to anyone whether you are a system or technic fan this is perfect it has great parts and is pretty cheap the alternate model is also very good i hope you all enjoyed my review i have made the pictures the requested size on my camera i look forward to hearing your comments edited by vbbn 27 august 2008  0702 pm	positive
nice work vbbn im not really into technic myself but youve definately done a fine review on this set funny that it actually fits a minifig perhaps well see fans design forklifts with technic and having it minifig sized	positive
nice review the figure fitting inside is great i think the price might be a little high but you did get it from tru so what else is to be expected	neutral
what that looks like a walker an imperial walker no€ theme space blacktron i set name alienator set number 6876 number of pieces 82 figures1 released 1988 list price £99 it seem no source online has the price peeroncom bricklinkcom as always lets have a look at the box first as i€™m luck to own a boxed version of this set walking across a planet with a grid pattern sky the back shows a great selection of alternative models after opening the box we find a single instruction booklet inside the instruction booklet now we come to the man in the black visor the mark i blacktron and black and industrial he look in my opinion i think he probably has the second best lego space torso before the focus group decided they needed to be brighter now turning to the walker itself it€™s a simple build which i don€™t think even i with my great skills for messing up could get wrong the final unit is built in three key parts the command pod which is attached to the body by two pins at the back the walker legs this is pure design genius simply built easy to replicate and no fancy parts the top section which open to reveal the blacktrons hightech tools time to put the entire set together i think you€™ll agree it looks great for such a simple build looking like you could take on the universe a side view of the finished product a frontal view of the alienator what the hell how did that take down an atat this is one of my all time favourite lego space sets actually i didn€™t have it predark age and only recently bought one what attracted me to it was an old boxed set but since then i€™ve discovered a set that i wished i€™d owned long ago the rating system figures 810 i love the dark industrial space look parts 710 yes it may be nearly all black with some yellow highlights but is have a good range and they fit to make several great models fun fun fun 810 it walks well and it€™s a great set it has a large number of possible mods design 1010 it€™s ingenious the walking mechanism is so simple and yet so good i can€™t fault it price 10 while i could tell you how much i paid i was luck on ebay so this remains a question mark grand total 3340 reduced top level due to lack of price knowledge conclusion a set which in my opinion showcases what lego was about in the 1980€™s the set has an excellent design ethic and looks great with very limited parts it retains great action and functionality twinned with the great main model you€™re shown that there are a number of other great models you can make with the same parts this set is what it€™s all about for me i€™m very glad i bought outside my normal theme when i saw this actually on the strength of this set i recently order 6894 blacktron invader and can€™t wait to get it and see if it lives up to the alienator	neutral
i loved all of these walker sets it was such a smart technique i made one myself with what i had ahhh good times thanks for the great review	positive
the ywing is the work horse of the rebel alliance it’s well armed and heavily armoured but you’ll need it because you’ll be moving like a sleepy hut – general rieekan set name ywing starfighter set number 7658 number of pieces 454 figures2 released 2007 list price £3999 lets us begin with the box the front shows it in all it’s swooshing glory httptdyorgukimages765802jpg the back shows some of the many features of the set and also others you might like to buy in the star wars range after opening the box we find a single instruction booklet now we come to an important aspect of any star wars set the figure here we’re provided with an anomalous rebel pilot and his faithful r5 droid the pilot comes with the fairly standard lego star wars nonhero helmet printing what’s he going to do with the blaster taken on the entire empire one of the more interesting parts is the assembly of the engine which if like me you don’t pay enough attention to the instructions when building you can end up getting wrong the key detail i got wrong just before fitting the last engine if we look carefully on the side we can see a missile launcher i didn’t think torpedoes or concussion missiles were fired from there but i may be wrong after fitting the engine the models looks like this in all it’s glory manning one of the alliance’s fighters not so ready to take on the empire was he so overall we have a well designed model which is in my opinion far superior to the original we were offered with darth vader way back when lego star wars was new this ywing is sleek and looks great in my opinion the firing missiles are also a great touch the rating system figures 510 for the same price the last xwing had far more figures parts 610 swooshability 9510 design 910 price 310 grand total 32550 not to shabby conclusion so finally the answers to the questions you’ve no doubt want to know is the set worth the price i’ll be frank £3999 is too much for this set despite this i currently have a squadron of three ywings the reasons is this set has been on sale a number of times at £30 it’s certainly worth the money lego recently placed them online with a price of £20 this i think was a great price for the set and well work picking one or more up if you wanted to start your own rebellion	neutral

ive built the ywing and the imperial landing craft 7659 more or less at the same time and for about the same prices i think the imperial landing craft ilc is much superior to the ywing the ywing doesn’t have much functionality besides an awkward dropping bomb device and a moving cannon the missiles firing system is … your fingers the ilc has an awesome missiles firing system i wish i could get it individually for mocs a clever bomb dropping mechanism 5 minifigures with weapons the wings fold up together and the “cargo” can be detached as a play set i’ve built the ilc first so i got quite disappointed with the ywing	neutral

yodalikespie on 03 september 2011  0721 pm said is it worth the money since the new ywing comes out next year please check the date prior to asking questions in old topics three years ago in this case its rude to expect people to answer questions like that especially since its such a generic question besides how is he supposed to answer the question without knowing a lot more about the new ywing	neutral

i think it is a fair to ask questions here with the expectation of a new ywing in the coming year i came here to look at the review even though it is a few years old no images to go with the review bummer id like to see a more friendly tolerance on dated threads being bumped	neutral
etav8r on 19 september 2011  0316 am said is that a threat is it fair to ban someone on the forum because they revived an old thread and made inquiries thought this was a forum to discuss lego and that is what he was prompting i dont really care why he was banned but this isnt the only time ive seen this type of behavior and discourse here on eb not a threat at all  i was simply pointing out that yodalikespie made the mistake of inquiring about the new ywing before we had any information on it to my understanding its not so much the fact that he bumped the thread as the fact that he bumped it for no good reason im not certain where the moderators stand on this issue but i feel that yodalikespies question would have been better received had he posed it after a substantial amount of information had been gathered on 9495  as ive said there simply isnt much one can go off of at this point to determine its value relative to 7658	negative
fallenangel309 on 19 september 2011  0343 am said not a threat at all  i was simply pointing out that yodalikespie made the mistake of inquiring about the new ywing before we had any information on it to my understanding its not so much the fact that he bumped the thread as the fact that he bumped it for no good reason im not certain where the moderators stand on this issue but i feel that yodalikespies question would have been better received had he posed it after a substantial amount of information had been gathered on 9495  as ive said there simply isnt much one can go off of at this point to determine its value relative to 7658 roger that sad that the original review pics arent available any longer would be nice once the new set is released for comparisons	neutral
maybe the thread should be locked or taken down since the pics consist of broken links kind of a pointless review without the pics and for the record there are other websites with preliminary images of some the new 2012 sets that are not on the eurobrick star wars 2012 rumors thread perhaps that banned fellow was hoping some of the lego insiders had some knowledge about it i guess well never know now edited by sharky 22 september 2011  0922 pm	negative
and lo it came from the east denmark the set which had been foretold the cheap army builder and there was much rejoicing amongst the castle fans the cardinal then asked was all the rejoicing justified… set name the knight set number 5615 number of pieces 21 figures1 released 2008 list price £200 lets us begin with the box the front shows us are knight and his rack of arms the back shows us two sets from the castle range moving inside the box now the contents of the box it doesn’t look like much the instructions to help you through the build now the reason you probably bought the set well at least why i did the knight this features the new torso for 2008 and is the height of fashion this brings the number of printed torsos from the crown knights to three which allows for a greater variety in building your armies a new fashion sensation and all the must have accessories for this season with a more heavily armoured look he’s ready for anything the rest of the set is a weapons rack i assume that once you’ve got a few of these set you’ll probably like me give up building them and part them out but anyway here are some pictures of what the rest of the elements are spent on a long and complex build begins after 360 hour finally it’s finished sadly five minfigs were hurt in the construction of this rack now the money shot where we can see it all come together it looks great even the rack doesn’t look to bad sadly are hero wasn’t ready for other themes just yet in total we have a good army builder which castle fans have wanted however there remains a question in my mind as to if this set is good enough on it’s own without any other castle sets i can’t see it being to much fun so it’s not a good present the rating system figures 910 great new fashion for this season  parts 810 shield sword spear helmet and armour what more could i want well two shields fun fun fun 310 sadly it’s rather dull on it’s own i can’t think or to much else to do design 710 yes it’s the army builder i’ve wanted design well apart from that pirate one price 910 at £200 what more can i say grand total 3650 let down by being to small to stand alone conclusion so let’s answer the question is it the army all castle fans have wanted well yes and no is the answer while it is a great set and at the now reduced uk price of £200 amazing value i still think it’s inferior compared with the army building capability of cross bow attack i much prefer army building both factions at once	positive

finaly we get a new mech for takeshi and yes its yellow it brings back some flashbacks of supernova good times anyways i recieved this set at christmas last year with 3 other ef sets set name assault tiger number 8113 pieces 163 theme exoforce year released 2008 price 1500 usd 1895 eur 1box the boxes this year are much different than those from previous years it has some gaps in it and has a cardboard backround inside of it the box itself shows assault tiger and the set information the back shows a combiner the cardboard backdrop a very nice jungle look to it it has lots of fog as well creating a pale effect 2contents the instructions the instructions are clear and straightforward also included is a lego blooper the remains of the sticker sheet the stickers arent too bad i didnt apply the saw sticker as i wanted it to be left plain the buzzsaw a very cool piece mocists will love this 3build the figures the figures included are takeshi who features a nice new torso also included is the mini robot his is a very neat little guy but sadly he doesnt really become a weapon more of a block of red and black bricks the torso now the torso design for assault tiger is very different from the past years it now uses a castlelike piece as the main structure also of note is that he has a mini throne no controls sadly and with the orange cockpit piece its impossible to see takeshi when looking at the at close on see the third pic the legs the legs are slightly similar to the mt201 ultra drill walkers but have been modified to fit the at they are quite large and suit their purpose the arms the arms follow a new design but the only problem is they have no elbow or hand articulation nice weapons though the finished product  parts 1010 lots of useful pieces great colors and some very cool new pieces minifigs 810 a robot would have been nice and a better weapon mode for the minirobot would have been good price per part 710 a stretch playability 810 the lack of elbow and wrist articulation isnt the greatest overall 3340 825 b assault tiger is a nice set but some of those small little things can truly take a toll on the final rating i think that i would only recommend this set to anyone who wants the yellow and hardcore exoforce fans sh link peeron link i hope you enjoyed the review and if you have any pic requests or questions please ask edited by sinner 01 september 2008  0152 am	positive
thanks for the review one of the best sets in the entire line	positive
the assult tiger is pretty cool	positive
i just bought 2 of them since they were 5 each from lego i really wish they did not cancel this series	positive
good review i got 2 of those wheels are very useful especially if you dont have any  as for shields  i dont imagine trolls use them too much i think that they fight berserk style  all out assault one complaint is the piece that the wheels are attached to  its a single piece with smaller than the standard pin connection so you cant change the width of the cart for your mocs using the wheels i dont know if a piece with such a connection only on one side exists though 	positive
thanks for the interview i nearly forgot this set is out yet maybe ill grab one off my local store tomorrow	neutral

nikola bathory on aug 28 2008 1147 pm said wait a second a troll isnt that an orc i thought that this is a troll those are giant trolls the regular sized green guys such as is included with this set are trolls yes they look like orcs but lego calls them trolls	neutral
nice review i never new trolls had fireworks at least thats what it looks like to me maybe i shall build a trollish fireworks company fireworks on	positive
thank you for the nice review the set is not that bad but a shield would be a nice addition i also dont like the flickfire missile a camp site with a fire and a chickenleg would also be nice about the rat isnt it just foodsupply for the troll the only problem would than be that the food is running away	negative

very good informative review i really want this set but i never got around to buying it i thought all of your photos are great and of good quality keep it up	positive
i love this set indy is what got me back into lego	positive
i discovered this review a month ago and since that point in time i could not get the image of the sparkling golden chest out of my mind i finally just purchased the chest for myself i suppose this is a testament to how well honed your picture taking skills are this set is definitely a nice one im not a lego indy collector but i was tempted to purchase this set several times the vehicles are very nicely detailed and have some cool building techniques such as the wheel guards	positive
i keep looking at this set to buy since i have 3 10 cards now maybe i will go pick it up at the lego store next month so many things i want	neutral
great review i was debating on whether or not to snag this up before its gone and i think i will great review and thanks again	positive

welcome to another sunny day in legovilletoday we will be joining the mailman on his daily route delivering the days mail when i first saw this set i immiediately liked iti think tlg should make more of these everyday life type sets such as delivering mail going to the grocery store things like that anyway enough blabbering on to the review 7731 mail van set name 7731 mail van year 2008 theme city pieces 66 price 799 pounds 499 euros 595 price per piece about 12 cents well start with the box shots the box is an interesting shape that i have never seen before very rectangular the box art is pretty nice the back shows the mailman delivering some mail the picture on the front is the same as on the box random manual shot the manual does not have the piece call outs but on a small set like this i dont feel its needed parts list decent selection of parts i really like the mail pieces image at the back of the manual showing all of the cargo sets together in a little scene i like it when the manuals have images like these because its nice to see all of the sets together all of the parts spread out the parts in this set are pretty good unfortunatly the car base is one large piece however we do get 2 printed mail pieces which are always nice our trusty mailman this torso i think is very nice the little envelope is a nice touch extra parts not much to say here the finished set i really like the design of the van it looks very smooth and somehow looks very lego to me the colors are my favorite part the red and yellow look nice together a nice mailbox however i wish the letter on the front was printed the front of the van is nice i think the textured brick on the front gives it a different look on the front which is nice the back of the van the doors open to store mail although it doesnt have much room i like that they included this feature delivery the mail bricks slide right into the hole at the front this adds nice playability the vans all loaded up we are ready to deliver  parts 710 pretty good piece selection but for 8 should have included a few more playability810 its fun to deliver the mail to all of your towns residents design 910 the design is very nice except i feel that some of the stickered parts could have been printed overall 2430 after a long hard day of delivering mail theres nothing like enjoying a nice pizza and letting your hair out why do they make us wear those silly hats anyway this is a nice set that i can definitely recommend and i think tlg should certainly release a post office to go with this and the air mail set i really like these everyday life sets rather than always fighting crime or putting out fires those guys have normal lives too brickshelf folder httpwwwbrickshelrycgif338718	positive
this set is nice it looks like a dhl van	positive
legoman132 on aug 29 2008 0335 pm said this set is nice it looks like a dhl van funny thats what i thought when i first saw the pics good review btw oh and i keep meaning to get this set but keep forgeting	positive
good review thanks for the mail van while it certainly adds interaction and fun to a lego town it alone lacks details and playability and thus not a good set especailly taking its price into consideration its value is pretty much just like if not less than some impulse sets in my opinion	negative
its a good set but i think the first sticker shouldnt say 7731	positive
legoman132 on aug 29 2008 0635 am said this set is nice it looks like a dhl van makes you wonder if there was some kind of promo or hookup in the pipeline that never happened i have this set and i really like it it works well with either the new city sets or with my older 1980s1990s sets i actually like the use of the old style car base and mourned the day that these became exitinct the first time round c1990 thanks for the review cheers rog	positive
thanks for that very nice review erdbeereis1 it´s great to see some other city sets beside the usual hospital police and firefighter mayhem and this is a really nice little one now give me some car doors and a kevin costnerlike mf and i´m a happy camper indeed tlc	positive
nice review i like this little set some how it reminds me now of postman pat in dutch pieter post an english childrens tv series about a postman in a little village somewhere in yorkshire aah sweet memories i would rather have seen a postoffice released with some women minifigs instead of the green post bigplane but maybe in a couple of years	positive
rriggs on aug 31 2008 0255 am said i actually like the use of the old style car base and mourned the day that these became exitinct the first time round c1990 i dont hate the piece but i did object to the way this set fills in the middle recessed area with a 2 x 2 plate that is nearly impossible to get out again without doing some damage to it whats more if you fill in the recessed area youve eliminated the only rationale for using the car base in the first place	negative
welcome to another sunny day in lego city the sun is shining the birds are singing minifigs are drowning wait what the coast guard rushes to the scene and deploys the coast guard 4wd  jet scooter to save the poor minifig from drowning lets take a look at the coast guards buggy 7737 coast guard 4wd  jet scooter set info set name 7737 coast guard 4wd  jet scooter theme citycoast guard released 2008 price 999 usd995 eur799 gbp pieces 130 minifigs 1 price per piece about 8 cents now the review the box here is the front it shows a nice image of the buggy on the beach with the ocean in the background the back the back shows some of the features in the set such as the extra equipment manual the picture on the manual is the same as on the box as usual the parts the set has great colors i love how the orange blue and white look together the part selection is quite good but unfortunately uses the large car base coast guard minifig this is a great fig the torso print is very nice and matches the buggys colors well new tire mold here are the new tires they look very good inmanual shot color separation is not a problem here and since it is a small set the piece call out is not a necessity extra parts it is always nice to get extra cheese slopes the finished set the design of the trailer and jetski is great the jetski is very smooth looking and the color scheme is fantastic the sticker on the roof is nice but its actually too big for the piece the corners of the sticker flap where the piece curves jetski closeup here you can see how it attaches to the trailer i didnt add the sticker that goes on the front which is a little sign that says bb03 or something attaching the trailer this is where the trailer connects to the main car it attaches simply with a ball joint car front view the license plate is a nice sticker and the top lights look nice say cheese driver the back the back is very similar to the front it has the same sticker the equipment rack a very welcome addition to the set it adds quite a bit of playability the orange fins are great all decked out he looks pretty spiffy in his diving suit doesnt he brickshelf folder the ratings price 1010 you cant get much more in here for 10 parts 910 nice selection and great colors the big car base is a bit annoying design 910 the jetski is a prime example of something with a small amount of pieces that still looks amazing playability 910 you can drive the car go diving and jetski across the bay minifig 710 the one it comes with is great but it could have come with one more perhaps a citizen of some sort build 810 simple but looks great overall 4250 lego sh brickset peeron bricklink even in the face of danger this member of the coast guard always has a smile on his face summary simply put for 10 you have to buy this set it is one of the better sets in this price range you can buy and one of the best small city sets the colors are great the design is great and the fig is great i dont normally think small sets are worth heavy praise but this one definitely deserves it thanks and happy building	positive
what an outstanding review of a great set i esp like your intro i have this set but have not opened it yet it looks like a fun little beach set the new coast guard theme is very nice edit this set could almost pass for classic town except for the use of orange and the lack of opening doors on the car 5 stars	positive
great job i will want to get this set soon its a lovely set with some coast guard saving on the jet ski what i dont like about this set is the lack of doors everything about this is nice but i still have to give it a 4 as for the entire flow of review i agreed with brickster that your introduction is very good with the little amends i had added earlier it turns out to be very good keep it up	positive
i am not a fan of citytowntrainstuff but this is a very good review that almost makes me wish i had the time read money to purchase some of the coastguard sets	positive
a very good review of an especially charming and lovely set thanks the whole cg theme looks very nice to me with a good and detailed set design and this one´s no exception although it would be nice to see more car doors and some new mf faces though	positive
thanks for this review i was thinking of getting this set and having read your review went out today and got it what a great little set what i particularly like very sturdy build feels very solid as you build the pickup compared to the fire pickup  trailer i also have the orange pieces my first pieces in this colour the tyres which give the smoothest ride of any lego towncity vehicle ive ever built the raised suspension and side runners the coast guard dude again a first for me and his megacool flippers and aqualung the jetski controls  the handlebars actually move left to right which is a great detail little details that lego didnt have to do the grey handle by the ball joint moving handlebars the new tyres as you can probably guess i have voted outstanding for this set erdbeereis1 on aug 29 2008 0602 am said color separation is not a problem here and since it is a small set the piece call out is not a necessity you do get a piece call out with this set i did anyway its on the back of the small poster that is included in the set thanks again cheers rog edited by rriggs 02 september 2008  0253 pm	positive
rriggs on sep 2 2008 0850 am said you do get a piece call out with this set i did anyway its on the back of the small poster that is included in the set i meant the piece call outs during the build that show which pieces you need for that step and cardinal brick im not quite sure what you mean but i cetainly think that this jetski is wonderful	positive
erdbeereis1 on sep 2 2008 0915 pm said i meant the piece call outs during the build that show which pieces you need for that step oh cardinal brick on sep 2 2008 0905 pm said one question though do you think the jet ski is as good as previous ones i have to agree that the jetski is an awesome little piece of design apart from the handle bars it has a really cool orange piece on the front a piece ive never seen before  the 4x3 wheelarch sort of thing cheers rog	positive
i agree that this is a very good looking set i just finished building mine yesterday and i love it but here is one suggestion trim the large sticker that goes on the roof of the vehicle by cutting along the angles at the front of the sticker if you use it as it is it will extend beyond the flat surface of the roof and will overlap the lower sections past experience with stickers has suggested that this sticker will lift at the front corners lego stickers are probably the best that there are but sometimes modifications must be made now i want that large coast guard helicopter 7738	positive
nice set nice review i already have one coastguard set that truck but i like the idea very much however the rigid inflatables could be much improved see the real ones at wwwrnlicouk or wwwknrmnl	positive
great review of a great set one question how does the robotarmpiece connect to the jetski	positive
it gets placed on top of this piece	neutral
the coast guard sets are very eye catching the color scheme is making me want to pick up the entire line although the offshore platform hasnt been released stateside yet ive had my eye on this particular set for a few weeks now and is near the top of my to buy list with instructions provided on legocom i build a dr infero version of the jet ski to replace the one used in mission 2 swamp raid its a very sturdy design bulky enough to make it feel like a real vehicle great review too thankyou for the closer look at the set	positive
erdbeereis1 on sep 3 2008 0436 pm said it gets placed on top of this piece i thought so so thanks for confirming	neutral
i had to vote outstanding on this set because it simply is great minifigs a cool head sculpture and a nice little boat means unlimited playability great review though man	positive
what a great review of an excellent set i love the islanders and that drum outstanding i think these islander sets never got the credit they dserved i really like this set and its a great addition to the pirate collection	positive
what a wonderful review with smart showing the right parts and clear pictures fantastic job erdbeereis1 this set is interesting for several reasons first of all it contains a large amount of very useful minifigs not many sets of this size contain so much figs secondly the throne itself can be easily combined with the other islander sets or even with other pirate and nonpirate sets im going to see if i can get this one for a reasonable price on ebay	positive
thanks for the great review this set is pretty standard as islanders go but it is such a cool subtheme that i dont care a bit i totally agree with your comment about old and new sets i dont think i would enjoy lego as much if i didnt have a decent amount of kits from pre 1999	negative
another very nice review and im glad to see it has some nice pieces as well as characters too looks to me that no one on bl has it in australia for sale so i may pass on this beauty though i did pick up king kahuka recently he makes an appearance in my medium entry	neutral
those indians look useful for indiana jones in the future as long as the have the new skin color i wish i could have picked one of those up when i could	neutral
well for some weird reason i missed this before so i tell you now very good review as we are used of you erdbeereis1 i like all the islander sets and own quite a few myself for people that dont own any of the islander sets yet the 6262 king kahukas throne is a great way to start lots of minifigs and accessories	positive
well this is a not so old set and i bet most of you already have it so here is another review from me as usual let us start off with the box art box art i like the box art they put a nice background for the atap at the side we have the minifigs scale and at the back there is the function shown and advertisement for other set the content the content is consist of 6 packets of bricks and a instruction book yeap no sticker sheet instruction book the instruction books not only show us the steps but also show us all a clear pictures of the january release sets and some sets show with their function well this includes the atap functions as well besides there are bricks checklist as well and the how do you start off before assemble your sets and a little poster where the clones with their atap battling the droids heres a random page new pieces to me i never see both of this piece before so i assume it is a new pieces anyone have any idea is there any other sets that contains this piece the blasters we are given a 2 long blasters which is great which i it is more accurate as most of the clone troopers use a long blaster the minifigs the minifigs is 2 shock trooper but is different with 7655 clone troopers battle packss shock trooper the leg is different in colour we are given white hip while the one in the battle pack are given a black hip furthermore we get a new printed headgear which i think they have improve it check out the mouth printing the colour is brighter so here is the headgear the headgear limit itself from turning to the side this is because the front part it is too low until it block by the torso the shock troopers without helmet on we are given a black stud no face printed how i wish that i have extra with helmet on comparison with shock troopers from battle pack the atap heres the atap it looks ugly at a certain angle and looks great in a certain angle anyway i still like the set i like the walker vehicle below are the pictures taken randomly top view side view without stabilizer leg with stabilizer leg rear view the functions well the functions are not so impressive just something turning around open here and there the only function that is say as special is the retractable stabilizer leg the cockpit the cockpit can fit two clone troopers but too bad we are only given two and is not enough as there is no gunner on top inside it there is a guns holders which can hold two guns but fall off easily when you are trying to remove the guns well the other side have some speedometre thing and a controller to reveal the cockpit you have to open the top hatch look below so you can see whats inside oops the side hatch and back hatch as well open and close i think this pieces is use not to let you open the hatch but to make some design i mean make it able to move inside with clones beneath so this is the pieces that hold the stabilizer leg when is not in use this is how the stabilizer leg move at last and of course the revealing cockpit from below and at the back guess the droids have alternative way to take this things down faster the leg there are pieces blocking the leg to go to the front i mean overhead and lose balance the base in not movable the side armor the side armor has door and this is how it is attach it is very flimsy when you want to adjust it to be a little steep to creat the shape they might just fall off so it is connected to the body with just a technic pin and to hold it properly here is the support the side hatch it open and close easily very loose nothing to hold it tight heres some view when the side hatch is open the cannon the cannon on top is movable and adjustable the big cannon can move up and down while the smaller one can cove sideways but the smaller one tend to lose balance when it is without minifigs means the one on top and below will not b align this is the pieces that only enable it to move up and down to prevent it from moving freely lego put two pieces to block it completion i try to make the sets looks great i think this angle is right spare parts it is so few compare with 7673 magna guard starfighter and it is more expensive overall this set is not really a good set the hatch is quite flimsy top and the side since there is nothing to hold them tight besides it is lack of one clone but to complete your walker collection you must have it pros no sticker needed new improved headgear long balsters cons lack of clone flimsy expensive as few pieces are given hope you guys like it edited by kimt 30 august 2008  1201 pm	neutral
i do not like the fact that the clones have pure white legs it looks weird to me it was also weird that they included shock troopers but it was probably a way to get people to buy it this set also seems like one of those that was kind of thrown in with a mix of other sets like the tie crawler i never picked it up and with the new clone wars sets out i wont	negative
i agree the pure white legs are odd as is the inclusion of shocks instead of pilots or regulars or maybe even kashykk troopers that might have been better	negative

i could have gotten this set if i wanted to but it seemed like a waste of money to me i dont like the shock troopers helmets that much i feel they should have printed visors instead of cut out ones like they have in my opinion it would make it look a lot better the at ap itself sounds like it has a lot of holes in its cockpit which drags the set down and make it seem like they havent exactly put a lot of effort into it great review	negative
wow talk about a bumper nice review baby this set is quite nice i would have goten it if i had had the money but didnt back then so didnt get it it has a nice parts selection why did lego do the shock troopers with white hips and the bp ones have black hips confusers me commanderfox	positive

valentin on aug 30 2008 0231 am said the ssd looks very similar to the actual screenshots from aotc though am still wondering whats that little translucent red piece for i assumed it was the droids eye great review btw now i know what all the little bits are i have this set as well i quite like the droid dr s	positive

valentin nice review i was thinking of doing this review and realised there were 3 reviews being done for this lovely set i must admit this is an amazing set after buying it in tru for sgd4990 15 discount i like the comparison of both spider droid even though one is not lego thanks for doing this lovely review its enjoyable to read	positive

alakazam the good wizard is the wisest minifig in all of legoland he is a master of the wand and can see the future with these abilities he helps the knights predict where the trolls will strike next because this set is not in stores in the us i was luckily able to buy this set on my vacation to germany it is interesting that it is a euro exclusive 5614 the good wizard set info set name 5614 the good wizard theme castle released 2008 price eur 295gbp 199 pieces 16 minifigs 1 the review unfortunately i dont have the box because in got smushed in my suitcase on the plane so needless to say it was not in top condition the manual the manual is an extremely small foldout but the image on the front is nice on the back of the manual there is a picture of some of the 2008 impulse sets this is a nice feature the parts for an impulse set this has a pretty good selection a very nice owl and an interesting clear ball piece all built this set took me forever to build i had to take numerous breaks as it was the toughest longest build i have ever faced for an impulse set this actually looks pretty good the owl perch is nice also the crystal ball table the wizard is a very nice fig with great printing on the legs and hat and i love his beard brickshelf gallery the ratings price 810 not bad but i feel that impulse sets are slightly overpriced parts 710 impulse sets are focused around the minifig but the parts in this set are pretty good design 710 the crystal ball is a good idea and the owl perch is simple but nice playability 610 there is not much to play with here build 810 as i said before it took forever really it took all of 1 minute minifig 1010 the wizard is fantastic overall 4660 bricklink lego sh brickset abracadabra blades of four you are now a dinosaur summary for an impulse set this is very nice the wizard is an excellent fig and getting an animal in a cheap set is always great i would definitely recommend this set thanks and happy building	neutral
good review for a simple set while it does come with the basics for an impulse set i just feel that it lacks something though i am not sure what perhaps a printed magic scroll i am still not a fan of the printed cap especially the stars but i do like the printed pants displaying his various goodies hanging from his belt the plain torso is to be expected from a wizard minifig i suppose overall its not a bad set but it certainly feels to be lacking something imo	neutral
kudos on a well presented and written review i think the reason this set didnt release in us was because it didnt have any warnings about choking anywhere on the box therefore no lawsuits in us for lego cheers isc	neutral
i scream clone on aug 31 2008 0227 am said kudos on a well presented and written review i think the reason this set didnt release in us was because it didnt have any warnings about choking anywhere on the box therefore no lawsuits in us for lego cheers isc no thats not the reason im sure youll get this set eventually as for the box well theres always been 2 boxdesigns  one for the us and one for eu actually theres an asian one as well the eu doesnt have the box count or the dont swallow we know that the us version has the brick count and dont swallow warning typical us thanks for a super review strawberryiceman i like the wizard im only sorry they put him in an impulse set whod want an army of medium blue wizards so its the worst army builder but a cool wizard does that make sense	neutral
well set out review with alot of great content gotta ask you though how does the set look nothing like the box art with so few pieces id have thought one could mentally put it together given the box front	neutral
i’m not a great communicator but what i was trying to say was that on the box the sets looks quite exciting and well made and that the alien fits much more snugly than it does so i was a bit disappointed that it seemed wider and less compact and certainly less exciting when i opened it	negative
well now we at least know that we can avoid that set  johan	negative
worst set of the year worst set of all time the pictures say it all no ratings necessary a waste of paper for box and instructions and waste of plastic for bag and jelly alien the little alien ship that comes with the switch fighter beats this one hands down as well as any other lego spaceship i have ever seen and i have seen many thankfully this set isnt available in my country which is something i never thought i would say anyway i hope tlg makes these awful jelly aliens disappear forever after this year	negative
thanks for the review considering the price i give it below average i didnt buy any of the space impulse sets as i dont think they are good value	negative
to be honest i am going to give this set a 1 that is my lowest rating i will ever give to a set in eurobricks in fact this is the only impulse set which i do not have it at all after looking at your wonderful review i am going to give it a 2 and actually consider it to buy at least one to complete the entire impulse set series i dont really like the design and the alien at all in fact i prefer the mars mission astronaunt more than the aliens i dont really like the set but i like your review	negative
i already dont liked the aliens but if the fighter was better i would already bought him now i will maybe buy one of it just for the 2 limegreen pieces	negative
i rated this poor due to the fact the set is unimaginative looks like a bunch of plates where thrown together and it just isnt worth the money lego is asking for it imo ive never been a fan of the nonarticulated jellies so ill leave my disgust for them out of this post however unlike the set the review is a fine work of art that clearly depicts the goods and provides valuable insightopinions about the sets playability usefulness and overall value	positive
sets we miss include minfig sets like this one€ theme space set name space minifigs set number 6703 number of pieces 30 figures 6 released 1988 list price  unknown 6703 peeroncom 6703 bricklink catalog lets begin by admiring the outside of the box wow 6 figs and all equipped i was four more of these we don€™t get instructions so the back show how to put the figs together now for the men themselves the complete line up of all six figs it seems strange half are in black a closer look at our four futrons a look at the blacktrons looking like nice guys with their visors raised time for a closer look at the range of tool these good men received from the lego company yep one accessory per person the question is what could you do with this set i mean it€™s just spacemen in a line do you see the man who mugged you ma€™am a good set from an age when we could look forward to every few years a new set of minfigs and just a box of them the rating system figures 1010 an excellent selection for the time parts 410 good accessories but nothing else fun fun fun 710 i can see lots of opportunity for fun with this set design 810 well it€™s not really designed much but it€™s a great idea price 10 unknown at this time though mine was from woolworths grand total 2940 a good mark for a great set conclusion until the castle battle packs came out this year we€™ve been suffering from a lack of minfig based sets and from this review i think you can see why for many of us and i include myself here lego minifig are one of the best parts of the hobby and sets like these allowed you to build up a much larger number of figs lego did well with this set a nice range of figure and also a good selection of accessor	positive
you you got it mint in sealed box it indeed is a nice set i am not into space but nevertheless this set is a good addition if you need to get your space environment a little bit more crowded lego however is planning to release a minifig set again next year city and of course the advent calendars are also quite nice to get some figs with accessories	positive
cardinal brick on aug 30 2008 0623 pm said the question is what could you do with this set i mean it’s just spacemen in a line what could you do the possibilities are endless 1 you can stand them in a line 2 stand them in a circle 3 stand them in a square 4 sit them all down 5 sit some of them down and leave some standing up adult supervision may be necessary for tfols attempting this one 6 take them all apart and scatter the pieces like some kind of huge space mine has gone off 7 yeah ok thats probably enough for now seriously i love all the sets of minifigs from all the different themes and this is a great one i always wanted them when i was a kid but never did my focus always was on town sets petrol stations and police sets please stand up and there was never enough pocket money left over for space sigh you are so lucky to have this great set thanks for sharing cheers rog	positive

7670 hailfire tank and spider droid number of pieces 249 number of minifigs 4 price 1999 usd 2599 eur 1999 gbp brickset hello everyone today i will review the extremely underrated hailfire tank and spider droid set i hope this review does it justice so lets start with the box note this picture is not mine standard box for star wars in that time the background on the box looks like its from geonosis indicating that this set is from episode ii and not iii or the clone wars the back of the box not shown shows the playability functions and some other sets that were released at the same time as this overview here is an overview of the whole set it comes with one construction manual and no sticker sheets   this is a very simple set but with not much to it it is still a very important part of the cis army especially if you are interested in army building i like to call this set a super battle pack and youll find out why soon lets get right to it and look at the feature of the set the hailfire tank front a front view of the very cool tank here you can see two triangular shields on the hull the main body is very simple but altogether very effective and clever and making it really look like a hailfire tank although a little bit sized down from its movie version the transred stud used as the eye makes the tank look more menacing side the side view the wheels are very easy to make but its a real pain to connect all of those chain links together i dont see what you could use the links for except for another tank but maybe someone creative will find something for these the dark tan is nice though the wheels are held on by technic poles and the tank rolls on the wheels fairly well on carpet or a hard surface back this is the back of the tank here you can see eight flickfire missiles four on each side of the new type so they dont easily fall out also note the modified 2x2 with extended hole piece sticking out of the back this may be used to easily push around the tank i just wish you could fit a droid in the body for the cockpit now we move on to the spider droid or what i like to call the dwarf spider the front this one is also simple but very cleverly built the main body is two semispheres connected together for rotation and an antenna a cannon four legs and eyes made out of a useful telephone piece the picture speaks for itself as far as how the gun and eyes are built side a side view you can now see the legs better which are more sturdy then you would think each one is made out of two pearl bronze exoforce robot arms a useful bley handgun piece and a dark bley battle droid body all connected to the under body a big knoblike piece back the back not much to say here i like this spider droid because it is very sturdy and the legs are easy to adjust finally we look at the minifigs there are four minifigs in this set which is quite generous for a set of this size it comes with a yellow battle droid commander i really like this one two battle droids and a super battle droid all three battle droids have the new blaster pistols and one twisted arm thats about it for the review so here is the final verdict build 810 very fun and easy besides the chain links should take the seasoned builder less than 20 minutes playability 710 the flickfire missiles are fun as well as just zooming around the tank could use some clones for a battle swooshability 810 you can roll around the hailfire fairly well minifigs 910 a generous amount of figs and all are pretty good design 9510 a really simple and clever set although a little too small for the movie version price 1010 a very fair price considering the priceperparts ratio and the coolness of the set overall score 8510 a very neat set to have a great army builder and great for display next to all of the other cis sets the price is fair the figs are good and the build is very clever thats all for now folks please feel free to give some feedback edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0308 am	positive
thanks for sharing this review with us i think this one of the sets in europe this thing is waaaay overpriced and thus makes it a crappy set we pay nearly double the us price so i rated it poor also because the figs included does not make it great the hailfire is well designed and looks great but thats just about all there is worthy of a positive mentioning sorry on a side note as a bronzeawarded student wheres the price in eur and gbp and wheres the poll nevermind the poll ive added that one for you 	negative

thanks for the review jimbutcher i really like that set it combines interesting and good design with some awesome cool parts and a neat amount of charm	positive
this is a great set i have 2 of them now and i plan to get more it is much better than the droid battle pack for 10 bucks more you get better battle droid arms and some canon vehicles good enough for me	positive
thanks for the review is a great one this set is not really a good set but i like the spider droid the hailfire droid scale is not right i think it is suppose to be even bigger anyway this is the first set that rerelease the commander droid so i grab it	negative
thanks for the cool review jimbutcher  actually i really like this set it is small but very clever and even if the hailfire droid is undersized what in the whole line is not under or oversized  the new spider droid is the best small build i have ever done in a set and the droid commander is pretty cool  i am happy with the set and i will get another with my comiccon exclusive 	positive
7681 homing spider droid limited edition number of pieces 206 number of minifigs 5 price 3499 usd 2999 eur 1999 gbp theme star wars episode ii year released 2008 brickset folder bricklink catalog welcome to my sixth review on these boards of the mighty homing spider droid at first glance this ball on legs may not seem like much but hopefully this review will change your mind the box this box is the standard for all of the new clone wars sets sleek shiny and a rightoutofthefactory look the blueandwhite color scheme is fantastic and portrays that the sets are based off of a cartoon well this box has a limited edition in spanish too  seal slapped on the front although you wont have trouble finding this in your local toys r us because of the big clone wars display in the front of the store that you cant miss overview in this picture you can see the contents of the whole set minus the instruction booklet built you can spot five minifigures which ill get to later and a very tall cis weapon known as the homing spider droid this weapon of destruction is a musthave for your cis army although the color scheme mostly dark bley and light bley is a change up from the regular colors brown or blue of the cis this may have something to do with the blended armies of the trade federation and corporate alliance but i dont know for sure the instruction manual is very thin only about twenty pages homing spider droid this is the main part of the set four huge legs two mounted guns and a red sensor eye are the highlights of this artillery unit theres not many playability factors to this one but sometimes its just fun to squash the little clones a changeup of the contrary it also looks good next to all of the other cis sets but you might want to clear some room in your display area the legs take up a lot of room this thing is also massively tall about the same height as the republic cruiser main body this is the main body of the spider which has no cockpit and is remote controlled this spherical body not in that sort of way is a very quick build and features a big red eye connected by a red stud and hinge top gun here is the top gun not with tom cruise which is connected to the body using a clever technic system pun not intended as you can see from this picture you can see that it can rotate a full 360 degrees but only if you remove the eye also the gun can be pulled back and if you let go it will snap back like the a gun does when fired due to the force of the shot im not sure this was intended by tlg because it wasnt showed anywhere on the box or in the manual lower gun here is the gun attached to the under body of the main part it is attached using a hinge which allows it to move up and down i also like the cord that presumably transfers power included on both guns hips here is one of the hips attaching the legs to the body there is one on each side with two legs each the are attached to the body and legs with technic pieces legs you can see the tall legs in this pic they are basically just technic poles and connectors feet this is one of the feet the essential to balancing the whole vehicle these and the legs are repetitive so i suggest doing them all at the same time to avoid flipping back in the manual and repeating the process three more times the picture speaks for itself for the design of the feet all are connected to the legs using a doubleholed technic piece one massive son of a gun this thing is so tall it frightens the skin off of even the toughest most experienced soldiers run for your lives look at how much havoc and fear it causes family photo enough of the battle scenes here is a shot of this spider with its smaller cousin the dwarf spider droid minifigs finally here are the minifigs that come with this set there are five in all which include battle droid nothing special but still an addition to your army commander battle droid i love that yellow torso super battle droid again nothing special clone trooper im glad they gave us one in this set i can add it to to my other phase 1 clones commander fox i love it everything from the dark red markings to the accessories are fantastic the head is just the regular anime style clone wars face this set comes with two flashlights two antennae one visor one pauldron and one kama closeup of fox here is a closeup of fox so you can see the detailed insignia of the republic guard that wraps it up for the review here is the final verdict build 810 very easy and straightforward a little repetitive with the legs should take the seosoned builder around 20 minutes playability 610 not many play factors but its fun to just squash puny clones with this giant arachnid swooshability na minifigs 1010 you really cant ask for more in this sort of set design 810 not very sturdy but it is altogether clever price 510 yes it is limited edition but pumping up the price fifteen dollars more than it should be is a little ridiculous overall score 8510 an excellent set for display although not very sturdy minifigs are superb but the price could be better in the end i would highly recommend this to any prequel trilogy fan looking to build up his her army well thats about it for this review please feel free to leave your opinions edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0309 am	positive
i just bought this set the other day and i must admit that it gets a below average from me the price is not corresponding with what you get which would be implied had jim added the eur or gbp price in the infohint hint  the spider droid is flimsy at best making it stand or even move without tumbling over is hard also why the brown cylinders on the legs keep the colourscheme clean please the figs are fine except that i dislike the clone headgear and the fact that the helmets now have holes in the sides allowing the flesh head to show within  goofy looking i am soo replacing the clone heads with black ones great review of an acceptable set	negative

this is polar1 over its day 5 at arctic research base 76 we are experiencing radio difficulties since discovering a number of strange radioactive arctic life forms which seem to be effecting our signal over we have encountered a large polar bear which by all account appears to be friendly and playful our food supply however has diminished quickly and we have to venture north from the base to a frozen lake in search of fish our cordinates are currently 46Â°45â²4â³n 741Â°21â²7â³w we do plan to take the snowmobile to the lake after we get our provisions in order this is polar1 out polar explorer bonus pack set  6569 theme arctic year released 2000 piece count 76 minifigs 2 list price 10 usd in 2000 lego introduced a new theme called arctic it was something completely new and different for lego as no minifig scale sets andor adventurers had ever ventured to the arctic the set offered new orange pieces and combined elements of blue and white pieces to provide a number of sleds vehicles a mobile outpost 6520 and even a large polar base 6575 the theme was unfortunately short lived and did not see 2001 this particular set is a value pack that combines sets 6578 polar explorer and 6586 polar scout at a reasonable price of 10 usd i may have even paid a few dollars less at a discount toy store back in the early 2000s a picture of the bonus pack with the two sets combined within the box the backside features an advertisement for the lego club and pictures of other arctic sets starting with the smaller set the polar explorer just a tip of the iceberg  instructions front of box back of box both sets include the same minifig an arctic fig with glasses and a thick arctic coat heres a shot of the fig with his hood on i always thought the hood is a nice piece that would work well for hoth rebel snow scenes the set includes a few nice accessories the set actually creates a small icesnow formation that can even be placed on water to represent an iceberg heres a closeup with the blue ice spider the complete set next the polar scout front of box back of box the polar scout instructions picture the same image as the box but i really like the real arctic imagery on the backside the set includes a small sheet of decals included are some great arctic accessories and some interesting arctic creatures like this neon orange scorpion in a ball of ice i love the polar bear a great addition to snow scenes but the best part of this set is the orange and black sled the back sled attachment uhaul has some tools and a removable storage cover the top comes off easy to store tools and equipment heres the arctic fig with a great metal detector or other snow research device and the sled itself lastly a picture of the complete polar scout final thoughts im a little disappointed that arctic was a shortlived theme at the time i wasnt too interested in the arctic but i still regret not buying the large polar research base after seeing it at a discounted price i was able to pick up this set and the mobile outpost that i never opened id be interesting in reading your thoughts in regard to this set and the arctic theme	neutral
i like the theme very much but sadly i dont own any sets of it it brings such a great feeling its fresh and has great parts and sets and it brought the polar bear your review is very good and informative thanks i voted wrong i meant above average but i clicked below average 	positive
hi great review on one of my favourite themes i never realized how cool it was until just now when you did your review anyways i remember my one set of the arctict expedition the arctic expedition pack	positive
a nice set review as for the theme itself i though it was a very interesting theme sadly i don’t think lego put enough effort into it i was personally upset not to se a second year even if i didn’t buy any of the sets it reminds me of the artic theme playmobil did at one point in the distant past to be honest i think a number of good artic scenes were missed when it came out a really wanted to get a ski plane but it never came i built it myself in the end but i don’t know how lego missed that one on a slightly random note i do know that at least one lego minifig did make it all the way to the real artic with a research team sadly i don’t have any pictures to offer you	negative
a very nice review i really miss the arctic theme i didnt own any of the sets but after looking at the pictures in this review and reading the instructions on brickleys words and brickfactory i want them	positive
i find it amusing that the numbers on the decal for the flag were chosen so that it wouldnt look stupid if you put it on upsidedown by accident	neutral

nice review brickster the arctic theme is very nice the minifigs have a great look to them especially with the hoods the colors for the arctic sets i have always liked and somehow the idea of minifigs exploring the arctic is fun to me	positive
thank you very much for this review thebrickster i voted both times for outstanding because i really the arctic theme i only bought the ice sailor but otherwise no sets because of money and place reasons and because i already collect four themes city older castle western and star wars old triology but a comeback of the arctic theme  perhaps as addition to a winter sports and winter rescue theme would be very welcome i really all sets  the little and the big ones in my opinion they all were very well designed not too big vehicles not too little and not minimalitic great minifigs and very nice and lovely details and accessory klausdieter	positive

i chose above average it has a great minifigure i wish i had itsomeday i will	positive
you already know how i feel about the review as for the set im not entirely sure its a fine witch but youve already gotten her in the witchs windship and a few other sets i vote average on this a good minifig though one does not have the need for more than one witch and some fine additional parts	neutral
this is a very good review no doubt about it about this set this is a cheap way to buy this set with a witch and some nifty accessories such as the black cat in fact i think this is the first time i had ever seen a black cat its simple but not very useful in my collection because other fright knight sets also offer the witches too i dont need many witches overall i feel that this is an average set	neutral
yay another fright knights review odd comic at the end skipper 24 on sep 1 2008 0705 pm said ever wanted to turn into a animal wanted to curse your enemy or just wanted to be rich beyond your wildest dreams you should go visit the witch and her fireplace she can brew you up a potion for any occasion or purpose so head down to see the witch right now sounds like a song or nursery rhyme somehow anyway to the review it is a great review such a small set but youve summed it up well this is one of the few unpromo fright knight sets i didnt get sadly not sadly because of willa the witch i have about four of her but the special cat and the other bits one can never have too many lego bats i voted the set outstanding i think it is for its size kimt on sep 1 2008 0816 pm said you already know how i feel about the review good or bad feelings edited by shoc 02 september 2008  1145 am	positive

kimt on sep 30 2008 1255 am said youre damn right that is strange why is this your favourite please explain id love to find that out haha i wish i could well i like small sets and this is aside from the fright knights flying machine comes in the smallest lego box i have seen i just like the look and story feel of the set i wish lego put out more sets like this and the 3075 ninja masters boat	positive
huzzah the king has declared a royal tournament pitting the brave knight in his shining armour against the feared skeleton warrior and his shadow horse the jousting arena is set up so let the joust begin 7009 the final joust set info set name 7009 the final joust theme castle released 2007 price usd 799gbp 599eur 795 pieces62 minifigs 2 figs 2 horses price per piece about 13 cents let the games begin box shots the front has an image of the knight and skeleton jousting with lightning in the background the back show the two now fighting with an ax and ball and chain i dont really like the box image as i think the background looks too dark manual the front has the same picture as on the box on the back some of the other 2007 castle sets are displayed this is better than the usual sweepstakes image that we get the pieces nothing really special here but you at least get a good assortment of weapons shields i always like lego shields and these are no exception the patterns are great minifigs first the horses these are great the knights horses coverings are really nice now the minifigs the knight and skeleton both have nice armor the torsos are plain black for the skeleton and bley for the knight the finished product in the middle is the jousting barrier which is simple but serves its purpose on the left we have the weapon rack which is good it would have been nice if tlg had included a rack for the skeleton as well though extra parts only two extra white parts here you can use them if your knights horse wants to retire and look like a normal horse again oh that has to hurt it seems that the skellie has won this round poor knight brickshelf folder now for the ratings price 710 not a very good price per piece ratio however at least 2 figs and 2 horses are included parts 710 the shields and log bricks are nice but most of the others are nothing spectacular design 810 relatively well designed but a bit boring playability 810 you can joust with it and thats about all build 810 short and easy overall 3850 brickset lego sh peeron bricklink strike it seems that the horses have rebelled against their riders summary this set although not amazing is still a very solid set the minifigs are great and so are the horses but the rest of the set kind of feels like an afterthought even with its negative aspects i still recommend it especially if you are a castle fan thanks and happy building ps if you want to see how i made this set a bit more fun check out this click	positive
nice review i can tell that you put some effort into it the moc is a nice design your reviews are getting better and better	positive

review of 7670 hailfire droid and spider droid updated theme sw episode ii  clone wars parts 249  figs figs 4 price £2000 2000 ‚2599 year 2008 i think many people were deterred from this set because of the low piece count and a high price for it although it does come with 4 minfigures 1 overall set and figs official box pic this indicates it is a geonosis set from the background but it is no different from any other set same old brown separatist ships the whole set some red tan droids would have been nice like in the geonosian fighter set all the minifigs the super battle droid body is slightly different to the one in the bp it looks more grainy and silver i doubt this has any relevance for it being a geonosis set but i like them better how they were in the bps the super battle droid body dwarfing the commander droids body i think that the new commander droids body is better than the old one with just the yellow strip even though it is less accurate new twisted battle droid arm each droid has one of these i dont really like having droids with these new guns i think the older guns suited them much better 2 hailfire droid hailfire droid by itself it is certainly smaller than the original seeming as this is the main part of the set i was hoping it would be bigger but i dont mind it being this small too much wheels and rockets can fold outwards and inwards the wheels which spin round two large clear discs and made from loads of these tiny links this is probably the best way to make the wheels on this small scale the only other alternatives i can think of are using the tracks from the wookiee attack set or catterpilla tracks both of which wouldnt look right one of the missile pods these use the new flickfire missiles which dont fall out are an excellent idea they should have come with the purple cones like on the magna guards staffs instead of red though because in the film the missiles are purple one of the new flickfire missiles that dont drop out when the model is tilted forward i dont know what the holes in them are for though the 3 eyes are made up of 2 trans red cheese bricks for the sides and 1 trans red stud for the centeryou can also see how the missile pods are attached to the side of the body this is the back of the hailfire droid there is a plate with a hole in i have found only one purpose for this the hailfire droid is the commander droids war chariot what do you use the plate for 3 spider droid the spider droid the design has been greatly improved from the wookiee attack set not only is it more accurate but also more poseable which is useful when setting up battle scenes the ball joint provides the place to put the antenna which isnt long enough but the dome form the old set looks more like the droid form star wars episode ii the eyes are made of a telephone piece with 2 trans red studs on in the original it had orange studs the eyes can be seen in action 2 pics down i told you it was a telephone 1 of 4 identical legs these are very easy to adjust into what ever position you want and are much better than the originals but a word of warning never pull them apart as i did they become very loose when put back together so i put some blue tack in the holes 4overall build 710 a little to repetitive for my liking minifigs 810 4 figs for £20 isnt too bad plus they come with new guns design 910 both vehicles are very well designed but the hailfires small size let the set down parts 810 comes with lots of useful maybe not  brown track links price710 not too bad with 4 figs and loads of little brown links playability 610 not to much on its own overall 710 if it came with some clones and tan red droids it would be better afetr jar jar wiped out a small droid patrold he realized he was being watched mesa in big dodo this time	neutral
skipper 24 on sep 1 2008 1221 pm said this is the back of the hailfire droid there is a plate with a hole in i have found only one purpose for this the hailfire droid is the commander droids war chariot what do you use the plate for the plate with the hole in it is for an easy grip when you push it around i think nice review by the way i think the telephone piece is great if a little bit oversized	neutral
this was an exellent review keep them coming ras	positive
yeah this was an ok set i remember getting a few of these at tru the boxes were smashed up and i got some 30 percent off still not as cheap as regular us price  some ok bricks and a great minifig thanks for sharing your thoughts and opinions on this set ill rate this set as average oh yeah ive added the review to the index	neutral
thanks for the review this set never got me so i didnt get it i also dont like the droidheadonly thing and i havent bought any set like that i planned to buy this on sale but it never happend	negative
i had a chance to get this set but i didnt i really wish i did though because i saw it at my cuzs place not to long ago and its quite nice i wish tlg would do more 20 small sets like this besides bp although they are nice 	neutral
nice review which reminds me i must order some more of these battle packs at some point are you going to also review the skelton battlepack also i hope this is a start of a running joke about castle sets being stomped by sw sets	neutral
great review of a neat way to bulk up your castle guards and their associated weapons and shields i hope we continue to see sets like this in the future they have to be a good money maker for tlg and they always please the fans francis marion on sep 2 2008 1039 am said they should have given him a horse  with that lovely new barding nobody would complain about the price then even if it was 15	positive
great set but with two huge cons  availabilty only on sh well surely not in italian stores  why are the figures already built are todays kids so dumb lets go back to those old minifig packs	neutral
imperialshadows on sep 2 2008 0846 am said  with that lovely new barding nobody would complain about the price then even if it was 15 i sure wouldnt especially if it was the silver chainmail barding	neutral
i was going to get this but when i rang up sh apparently theyd sold out already price is a little on the steep side as well and i can only see it going up on sites such as amazon as the number of people wanting them goes up which it will it its anything based on the star wars battle packs	neutral
after reading your review i might buy me one of these at first i thought it was quite useless but i must admit that your review kinda changes my mind on this bp ive added it to the index	neutral
swman on oct 6 2008 0727 am said how were you able to get three small shields i only got two in mine i am going to check the trash just in case i think it only comes with two the extra one probably slipped in from another set sorry for any confusion	neutral
and another great review from one of our academy teachers i always look forward reading them  i think the battlepacks for castle are a great initiative from tlc i like this one but also the one with the skellies you get some different looking soldiers and a few weapons and shields so thats cool the low prices make it so that most people could build a large armybattle if they want to a big for your review and another for tlc for making these edited by zorro3999 06 october 2008  0540 pm	positive
i love this set i bought one when i went to the lego store at downtown disney and went home and bought another online i love that it gives you a variety of weapons and figures i like using the bowl helmet guy to man my catapults and crossbows	positive
its an ok set but its extremely overpriced where i live i simply couldnt justify paying 1799 tax for 5 minifigs the fact that these figures are featured prominantly in other sets makes this set a difficult purchase given the price i find it hard to look at this set with much enthusiasm	neutral
its way to expansive for what you get besides you pay more for the package then its containts	negative
yeah i have to admit you expect it to be wayyy cheaper since a no packaging to pay forbaggies and such b no liscensing feeslike sw so why isnt this set a better deal than sw battlepack dont look at me look at tlche he it rhymed	negative
i really love these impulse sets at a low price point for lots of minifigs this police one doesnt appeal too much to me at the moment but who knows with your reference i may need it with a future project hmm its actually a good way of getting those dogs cheaply	positive
i also love the impulse sets but we have already too many policemen although i actually bought this one our bobby isnt looking very nice is he we normally but policemen in a pool or sea with sharks at events like legoworld so maybe thats because of me edited by jopiek 02 september 2008  1100 pm	neutral
good set but i would have about 4 by now if it came with handcuffs though the roadsign is good	positive
i bought this set for 214€ yesterday and i have to admit that for that price im veerryy satisfied  i bought it especially for the dog my first one and for the road sign during the construction short of the set i was wondering something does the speed limit has a signification in every country or some variant exists in my country france the speed limit in town is 50 kmh so i understand the road sign in this set but in other country and especially the country were the speed limit is not in kmh does this set had another road sign	positive
not a bad set altough the radar is a little weird looking	neutral

set name crossbow attack set number 7090 theme castle pieces 54 minifigs 3 released 2007 price 599usd 399 eur 799 cdn legoshopcom description ready aim fireits a battle of brave knights against the evil skeleton rider includes 2 knights skeleton and a skeleton horse rolling wagon has a launcher that really fires bricklink inventory peeron inventory brickshelf gallery now on to the review the box as you can see the front of the box illustrates the set very nicely showing the skeleton warrior attacking and the knights firing their crossbow the back the back of the box shows a small battle happening between a knight and a skeleton as well as the main feature of the set the firing crossbow more on that later the instructions not much to say here its the same as the front of the box the back of the instructions this merely shows pictures of other sets in the castle line random instruction page this set does not use piece callouts to tell you what parts you will need in each step however the set is so small you should never have trouble finding a piece the minifigures this is the main reason i bought this set you get two knights one with a standard helmet and the other one with a new mold you also get a skeleton warrior the horse the set comes with a skeleton horse that looks great however it is a single molded piece that has no articulation closeup of the warrior riding his horse here you see the brave skeleton riding in on hisaherumnoble steed the accessoriesweapons for minifigure accessories you get an axe a skeleton sword and a skeleton shield extra pieces i was left with one skeleton arm and one leg when i was finished the build the crossbow wagon and now to the main part of the set the crossbow wagon it is really just a plate with some whells attached and a lot of those cheese wedge pieces to create the track for the projectile back view this view shows the mechanism that makes the crossbow fire it is powered by a rubber band you pull back on a technic piece which creates tension in the elastic band when you let go the elastic pushes the piece forward which in turn hits the projectile and makes it fire it works fairly well but i would have prefered it fired farther entire set the skeleton charges at his adversaries the knights prepare to counterattack overall build 1010 the build is simple easy and quick set design 710 the crossbow could have worked a bit better playability 810 the crossbow is fun to shoot minifigs 1010 it doent get much better than this i love that domed helmet mold price 810 the set is very affordable and worth the price overall score4350 conclusion overall this is a great set and a solid army builder you get three minifigures for a fair price and the crossbow wagon adds some muchneeded playability i bought two of these to bolster my army and to stock up on those rare domed helmet pieces basically get this set thank you for taking the time to read my review i hope you liked it	positive
thanks for the input	positive
i like this set mostly because it has some very usable pieces but also because of the amount of minifigures in the set which is a whopping three and one large animal skeleton horse the one thing however that i dont like about it is that one of the catapult operators isnt armed in my opinion this would have been a good time for tlg to release a suitable dagger piece not the kitchen knife for its castle line great review by the way it captured the key elements of this fantastic small set	neutral
nice review to start off you got all the details someone could possibly need in my opinion at least i do enjoy this set as well and ive bought only one to keep my minifigs as unique as possible despite my personal preference i still find this a nice army builder good amount of minifigs for the price as mentioned earlier with each being different from the other though i would like the catapult manager to be armed with at least something i still feel that he can just flee if hes ever in trouble hes a good guy to use for the castle gimmics if you have it one more small comment i also love those domed helmets even if they arent actually new my favorite of them all being followed up by the racer helmet	neutral
cardinal brick on sep 4 2008 0747 am said nice review  i still thing sets like this are the reason castle has done so well it allows you to collect a large number of minfig for not very much cash which i certainly indulged in my only complaint is that you end up with the evil skeletons out numbered however heard of the good guys winning with the numbers in their favour ive experienced that problem too i find my knights outnumber my skellies about 31	negative
dark times in lego castle land the poor knight is being held prisoner in the skeletons prison carriage we must help the brave knight on horseback free him at once lets ride 7092 skeletons prison carriage set info set name 7092 skeletons prison carriage theme castle released 2007 price usd 1999gbp 1499eur 1995 pieces 193 minifigs 5 animals 4 price per piece about 10 cents review time box shots our first pic is the front of the box which shows a dark image of the knight attemping to free the prisoner and here is the back showing some features the manual the image on the manual is the same as on the box front random manual shot no piece callouts but the color distinction is not a problem the parts 193 pieces doesnt seem like a lot but many of them are quite large the selection is pretty good lots of greys and black minifigs with this set comes a whopping 5 minifigs which is amazing for a 20 set the knights are very nice and one has a doublesided head the horses adding to the already large minifig count are the 4 horses 3 skeleton horses and 1 great brown horse for the knight extra parts now the finished set first we have the brave knight on his brown stallion the horses head covering looks very nice and the knight gets a nice long pointy stick the main event the prison carriage the design of this is excellent with the bionicle piece and the white horns it looks very spooky the tower this part is one of my favorites it uses white horns to give it a great creepy look one problem is that there is barely enough room for the 2 skeletons the driver here you can see the driver and his whip you can also see the bionicle spine a side view when you look from the side you can see the great design of the prison it is placed on tiles for easy removal and looks great with the round white 1 x 1s on the corners horses harness this is another very well designed portion of the set the harness attaches easily to the horses and to the carriage the prison look at the poor imprisoned knight lets try to free him the back of the prison hinges down the knight is freed everything together all together the set looks fantastic the carriage has a great creepy skeleton feel and getting 9 minifigs is amazing brickshelf folder ratings price 1010 193 pieces and 9 figs is fantastic for 20 parts 910 lots of good large pieces design 1010 captures the spooky skeleton look very well playability 810 its fun to try and free the prisoner and the carriage rolls well build 910 easy but fun minifigs 1010 the sheer amount of figs is great and they look great overall 5660 the future of lego castle summary this is an amazing set for the price a huge amout of minifigs combined with a great design and good playabilty makes the set a winner i would certainly recommend this set to anyone that remotely likes lego sets thanks and happy building	positive
youre really rolling these reviews out huh i am not sure how i feel about this set while it does include five figs three are skeletons and are generally worth much less than say three trollsorcs i know they didnt exist at this point in time so this is understandable the amount of horses is nice but im not a big lego horse fan what this set does have is a great appearance and brings atmosphere to the table 20 is an affordable amount for those of us who do not wish to splurge too much on a toy while being enough to actually get a large enough set to create something out of personally id rate it in between average and above average like another castle set i cant remember which i just feel this one also lacks something	neutral
i really like this set and its probably my next purchase from a store if i can still find it theres alot of great pieces i especially like the spiked thingy on the front and it makes a great addition for any skeletal army above all i just love the spinechilling feeling of it if i were a minifig in a legoland id be scared out of my pantspiece if i saw a carriage like that rolling towards me in a dark night	neutral
well indeed looks like a very nice set especially the scared knights are very nice 	positive
this was one of the first sets i bought from the new castle theme and i love it so many figs and awesome skeleton horses in just one set at the same time you get quite a few usefull black bricks for castle mocs another perfect set in the new world of castle review added to the index	positive

i really do love this set it has 5 figures which is unheard of for a 20 set it comes with plenty of weapons and accessories and has a great design the detail is really well done and for anyone who wants to just buy one set this set allows for hour of fun just by itself i already have one of these and hopefully will be getting a second	positive

this set is alright but it doesnt have that pizzaz feeling you know what i mean i would prefered a knights carrage realy but the design is ok	neutral
im a little late in the coming okay a lot  but regardless id applaud you for another fantastic and insightful review erdbeereis out of all the castle sets this one remains one of my favorites i got it for christmas in 2007 before i intended to spend much money on the new castle theme that changed once i managed to get the kings castle siege for a very good price its really a wonderful set all around  the design accomplishes the spooky undead feel very well and it contains a good piece selection and a phenomenal amount of minifigs seriously this set is almost unrivaled in modern lego in the final area  im still amazed at how many minifigures tlc put in the kit i also appreciate that the carriage has a far more realistic horse arangement  after all the sillyness of the onehorse pulled siege engines in kk its good to finally see a carriage pulled by multiple horses again all in all an excellent set and well worth 20 imo	positive
great review this is my 2nd favorite lego castle set tied with skeleton tower that i own my first favorite is drawbridge deffense	positive
great review erdbeereis1 this really is a fantasic set lets hope lego makes more sets like these with 5 minifigs4 horses at a price of 1999  actually its about rm200 here and its not even pricetopiece count anyways amazing review ad if i could get more castle sets this year i might even join the reviewers academy	positive

7990 cement mixer theme town released 2007 price 15 usd pieces 209 1 minifigure introduction need a skyscraper built a motherinlaw buried a treasure kept no problem here i come  only one booklet for instructions without any alternative model its divided into two sections for two seperate baggies which the parts come in parts come in two big bags a few big pieces and the stickers are loose in the box extra parts and sticker sheet dark bluish gray 1x1 round plates are meant to be used as cement sticker sheet is neat a standard worker with helmet he comes with a shovel colour scheme makes it easy to understand the instructions its easy for younger lego enthusiasts to build the model building in progress chassis of the truck is really sturdy drivers seat is on the left i wish we had a real seat instead of a modified tile working drum mechanism you can turn the cement drum from a handle on the front right nice details on the front rearview mirrors are great i love the snot front panel too control panel on the left cement hose hardly fits its place and the hose is too thick dont forget the shovel snot technique is used on the back panel as well long  wide truck with 8 wheels i love the 6studwide design of new town series cement drum actually works if you place a couple of 1x1 plates in the drum and turn the handle it pours out the little cement parts man at work all this hard work gave me wrinkles on my face  folder when public brickshelf rating figures 610 nothing special with the figure but what did i expect at least we have a face expression parts 610 standart parts for a truck but the big blue drum is new price 810 very nice and detailed truck for 15 usd design 910 it really does look great doesnt it building 810 easy to build and its fun with a little use of snot total 3750 its a must for every town but other players should find it attractive as well conclusion i occasionally order town sets but i felt a great urge to build this when i first saw it on brickshelf when it was released i ordered it right away ten days later i was amazed looking at this beauty by my table we didnt have a cement mixer for ages and im sure every town builder will have this set and i have no doubt nontown enthusiasts like me will consider getting this links brickset reviews bricklink entry peeron inventory	neutral

7040 dwarves mine defender theme castle released 2008 price 10 usd pieces 73 3 minifigures introduction here i am with one of the newest castle sets realeased in early 2008 its a small battle wagon with blades on the front probably to demolish rocks in mines but in this case our hero dwarf has to use his machine against the evil trolls who want to destroy his happy kingdom there is only one small booklet for instructions no alternate model parts come in two bags one for small pieces and one for bigger ones apart from the lovely figures the brown parts will be quite useful for any castle builder extra parts are not even worth mentioning there are no stickers figures are detailed enough dwarf is lovely with his beard but his legs wont move because he is short figures are the main attraction for adult players we havent seen castle army builder sets for a long while and this is closest weve got in recent years the dwarf is a little taller than it should have been but its not possible to do so without creating a completely new mould for figures and that would be expensive its beard is oversized as well but that gives him a legoish look which i like a lot the trolls  thats what everybody calls them but i say they are orcs  are obviously evil but they are friendly enough not to scare our munchkins but i wish they had different torsos or at least different faces like crownies there are not enough weapons to arm everyone but the flag pole is really nice unlike the star wars army builders this set has very little weaponry only one sword and one pike creates scarcity for 3 figures  star wars sets had 4 figures for same price so i hope our middle age warriors dont come across any stormtroopers  building in progress when you pull the chain the catapult fires a round brick the set has quite good playability moving blades and firing catapult should be fun for little children i wouldnt expect more functions for such a small sized model it hardly covers my hand the blades move with the front wheel on the right there is only one little downside there is too much friction for the wheel and blades wont move synchronized you may come over this problem by adjusting the blade height and lining them with the wheels mow the little buggers you can adjust the blade height there isnt enough room for the dwarf folder when public httpwwwbrickshelrycgif338578 rating figures 810 dwarf is amazing trolls are great too but i wish they had different faces parts 710 brown slopes are new rest is ok too price 710 acceptable but we have seen sets with more figures for less design 610 it looks kind of steampunkish but could be better with a little detail building 610 not repeating itself still nothing exciting total 3450 castle fans will definetely order this one but average lego player may not be interested conclusion overall its a nice set and id recommend it if you like the castle theme youll find some good use for the figures and this is the cheapest figure set of the year  at 333 usd each it could have more armory and weaponry but otherwise its quite alright skip lunch today and order this little set links brickset reviews bricklink entry peeron inventory	positive
lovely review really but the sad fact is weve seen it before twice httpwwweurobrickshowtopic20293	positive
a great review of a very good set i must echo kimt though i seem to be doing it an awful lot it would be improved by the addition of one more fig to the set as it’s the same price band as last years catapult	positive
ive skipped a few lunches on behalf of this set its a great army builder but so are many of the new castle sets what makes this great in my opinion is the figs  2 orcs and 1 dwarf  what else could one want thanks tlg for making this set and thank you for reviewing it for us review added to the index	positive
nice review i just recently purchased it for our future son and had to break into to it to get a first hand account of the merchandise i am not that big into the castle themebeing a citytown person myself but i must say that this set is awsome	positive
this set pulled me out of my dark ages thanks lego	positive
you chose the perfect set for your first poll simon no question this set is one of the alltimebeauties i rated outstanding of course i never hat the chance to get a complete copy of this set but i do own the engine and quite a bunch of monorail tracks your very detailed review made me think of getting the whole set some day thank you very much for this i never realized there were so many details included to this set the snackbar and the telephone cell and all the other nice things really strange for a nineties set which often lacked details the only thing that comes to my mind right now is that the engine looks quite blocky if the set was released today tlc would use more of those parts which make a better design imo and it would fit better to the curved walls of the stations as well wishful thinkinghow much would i love to see the monorail system back again wishful thinking i had to lough when reading your comment on the minifig seats dont you own many of those i dont know where to put mine	positive
this is an outstanding review which deserved to be featured here after seeing this set it prompts me to own this set and match with my 10159 legend city airport its very nice to see such outstanding set being reviewed and presented to our very screens everything about this set is simply outstanding i cant imagine that such incredible set actually released before why dont they ever continue with this anymore sigh its nice to see so much detailed from its shuttle snack bar stairs waiting platform validating machine and etc this is an instant 5 set if given a chance to own a misb set i will defintely seriously consider about it	positive
best set ever i got my copy years ago from a guy on the old rectoyslego newsgroup anybody here still remember that newsgroup i traded him a guarded inn a black falcons fortress and a couple other small castle sets for it no regrets on that trade it is hard to incorporate a monorail into a town especially if you have a bunch of trains too i ended up making my entire monorail system elevated theres just no easy way to make a monorail  road crossing i also gave up on having it run in a loop instead it runs back and forth between two endpoints	positive
yes this is one of the best town sets ever	positive
thanks for that splendid review simonwillems i clicked on outstanding of course i also like those little details especially the ticket validating machines youre very fortunate to own this wonderful set i hope you have an airport to go with it edit and bricklink is wrong giving 1991 as the release date youre right it was 1990 edited by legotrainfan 05 september 2008  0657 pm	positive
who was the one who rated it above average	positive
great review of a greater set	positive
this remains the definitive city set in my eyes i never managed to get one but from the instructions it seems to be perfect in just about every way i got the two space monorails a while ago but the much higher prices on this one have kept it out my reach this set is a lot bigger than either of those though i always liked the monorail system a bit better than the trains because you could easily incorporate height into the tracks and spread them out in all three dimensions quote edit and bricklink is wrong giving 1991 as the release date youre right it was 1990 it was apparently released in 1990 in europe and 1991 in north america going by some us and german catalogs i have from that time period edited by cp5670 06 september 2008  0606 am	positive
section8 on sep 6 2008 1006 pm said i thought it was out of my price range too then i realized that i had probably spent enough since coming out of my dark ages to buy a misb 6399 so i bought it and i am going to cut back on buying other sets for the next year or so to offset the one big purchase those glimpses of the 2009 sets havent made me regret the cutback that must be one of the biggest expenses legolike buying an misb 6399 congratulations with the purchase though it is a lot of money for one set	neutral
gasp blasphemy someone voted this set below average brings out hunting rifle ahem back on topic i remember wanting this set badly for years and i still want it just no as much because its expensive and as this review proves takes up a lot of room ive already got my trains to think about and i wont be getting this set anytime soon i also have a faint memory of this set being featured in one of legos advertisements more specifically someone narrowly missing it hitches a ride races the monorail to the airport and catches the plane i am yet to find it on the net as old lego adverts are hard to come by especially the european ones now to more important matters starts hunting edited by freddie 07 september 2008  1003 pm	positive
i know this is not the advertisement movie but if you want to see the airport shuttle moving click here freddie on sep 7 2008 1102 pm said now to more important matters starts hunting now to more important matters helps hunting	neutral

indexed name refuse collection truck set no 6693 theme lego system  town year 1987 pieces 103 minifigs 2 price unknown special parts 4215ap08 yellow panel 1 x 4 x 3 with recycling pattern just occurs in this set 2x 4598 red bracket 2 x 3  2 x 2 occurs only in this set and only one other set this truck was introduced in the same year that lego came up with the garbage bins that of course also appear in this set have you ever wondered why most of the time the streets of lego city are so clean and neat no litter no garbage everywhere no chewinggum on the streets even with so many different inhabitants it seems to always stay that way however the older afols amongst us have experienced totally different situations rubbish everywhere smelly and dirty looking pavements minifigs that were losing their standard grin that is why lego came out with this magnificent truck back in 1987 before that people needed to put there garbage in bags or maybe barrels from that year on every miniman and miniwoman is happily using a trash bin the minifig civil servants never seem to become tired and the garbage truck comes every other day to collect the rubbish and keep the city clean the secret behind the clean lego city and the always happy standard grin of our minifolks are the antilitter warriors that use their powerful machines and handy tools to just get the job done so if you dont own a garbage truck better try to get one before your standard grins also fade and your streets become as dirty as naples where the garbage collectors recently had a strike for quite some time an overview of the set including instructions actually one is included in the set unfortunately i afraid we dont have any boxes of this set left another image of the lego items in the set it shows the truck two civil servants to perform the waste collection duties two garbage bins and a broom and shovel the two chaps that always seem to smile even when the litter that they collect really stinks the accessories that accompany the set a broom and a shovel to help cleaning up in case a dustbin tips over a very nice feature of the set is that the elevator at the back can be lifted in more or less the same way that real garbage trucks do as you can see here the dustbin is emptied through a red train window it seems to be that the hinges of my version will need some revision panels inside the back of the truck maximize waste capacity for this 4 stud wide truck it is nice that the designers added this simple red round brick on a clip presumably it should depict cylinders to let the back compartment tip for emptying or otherwise it might be gastanks again the complete set it is very complete set but some additions could make it even more playable  garbage eg a green flower bottom or some round plates 1 x 1  a place for the second worker to position himself on when the trucks needs to drive to the dumpsite or an other street and also vertical bars for that second worker to hold himself by this is what the truck will look like when dumping the litter at the recycle plant or dump site the whole back nicely tilts so that all the litter will fall out of the truck a view on the back of the truck quite a small but yet effective opening the front of the truck only one seat for just the driver but i personally prefer that to a 6 wide truck that fills the total width of the streets and has problems with corners of course set 7991 the orange garbage truck of last year is also nice we also own some of those but we never put them in our lego town since they take too much room and the color scheme of 6693 is also more preferable to us the two panels with the printed recycling pattern are a bit worn so we might recreate the recycle logo and put it on a sticker some day playability 810 like i mentioned it is too bad that the set doesnt have any litter however lego also saw that and has put litter in the 6693 set design 910 a really nice truck with two minifigs and very nice details price 10 i was not able to get any price information at bricklink one can still obtain a 2nd hand one for about 25 overall 810 a set that should be entitled a classic in the same list as the pizza restaurants the 7750 and the blacksmith shop that was all the pictures i was allowed to take since it seems that those brave man still have quite some trash cans to empty thanks guys for doing the dirty work so our minifigs stay happy and our streets stay clean peeron lugnet brickset bricklink entries additional notes on the review my brother has always been keen on garbage trucks however when he became aware of this truck it wasnt available in the stores anymore newer sets that had the recycling theme we not that good they didnt have the emptying mechanism so after our dark ages one of the first sets we bought were some of those nice refuse collection trucks although the new orange truck has the desired mechanisms and thankfully is a decent garbage truck we more like 4 wide trucks than 6 studs wide trucks so for the years to come our lego town inhabitants will still be seeing this great truck to control their waste problems	positive
definitely the best garbage truck ever the color scheme is great and the design is awesome outstanding without a doubt i must have it sometime	positive
this truck is simply beautiful its on my brickset wanted list i love the colour scheme red and yellow are the right choice for this vehicle the back part of the truck can be opened so it can discharge the rubbish like real garbage trucks youve also mentioned that in your review and i find it a wonderful detail thanks for the review jopiek	positive
tenorikuma on sep 7 2008 0830 am said it would be cool to see a review comparing this set with the newer orange garbage truck well i might want to do that but then in a different way as the railroad maintenance i will then review the orange one and make comments on it compared to this one	neutral
thanks for the review like many such town sets i would characterise it as cute contrasting it to the new bin lorry its nice that this set has two minfigs more realistic and two bins those bins are a great addition to lego although wheelie bins would be nice now need some kind of 2x2 container you can clip a plate onto as a hinging lid and clip miniwheels under the back two studs having two minifigs is a superior point for this earlier lego rendition of a bin lorry in fact even though our bins are now emptied by a private company rather than the local council as was the case up till the mid 90s and of course for the last two decades there have been wheeliebins bin lorries have three guys  the driver and two collectors however our bin collectors for sure dont use a broom or shovel indeed on occasion theyve befouled the street themselves if something goes wrong with hoisting the bin on the mechanism the shape of the lorry in the set is still quite accurate pretty good for a fourwide vehicle i must admit to preferring the newer vehicles	positive
thanks so much for the great review i love that truck i hadnt realized there was a real 4wide recycle truck out there i must get it one day to replace this abomination currently doing garbage duty in my town i think that truck has seven pieces total in it i do like the blue color though 	positive
tenorikuma on sep 7 2008 0830 am said it would be cool to see a review comparing this set with the newer orange garbage truck true woold be good for the people that have few new city sets like me and your review is good btw i own this set however because it was really cool those days nowadays all trucks nd cars can do neat things but that wasnt so back then	positive
greetings just looking through the review index when i came across this one i recently acquired this set through ebay which came with a practically perfect box and instructions i would almost say that no one played with it much as all of the parts were brand new anyway i just wanted to say that this is a great set that was worth the 1499	positive

6206 tie interceptor number of pieces 212 number of minifigs 1 price 1999 usd 1799 eur theme star wars episode vi year released 2006 brickset folder bricklink catalog welcome to my ninth review the boards todays review is the long awaited tie interceptor but does it live up to expectations well lets find out i believe this is the first and only time tlg made this set so lets begin the review the box the box is standard for its time with silver font the background on the front has some planets and the death star ii clarifying that this set is from episode vi overview this set comes with the interceptor model and one fig the interceptor has a very sleek futuristic design with four wings and a ballshaped cockpit the tie interceptor is a stealthy speedy vehicle in the imperial fleet it is used for scouting missions and not meant for attacking due to its weak structure and low arsenal front this version of the tie group is very attractive and coollooking it has an aerodynamic shape giving it looks and speed while not accurate to the movies grey and black colored ties the blue in place of the grey is just fine and does not alter the coolness of the design thankfully there are no stickers in this set cockpit here you can see the ballshaped cockpit be very very careful when opening it its very flimsy and breaks off almost every time fortunately both the windshield and the dish on top are printed and not stickers please dont mind the dust cockpit interior this is the inside of the cockpit it is very roomy airtight and one of the few cockpits in sw sets that are this good it makes up for lack of detail by giving the pilot plenty of room so you should have no trouble there it is also very smooth in the back and where the windshield folds down this is by far the best sw cockpit i have ever seen done by tlg good job the only bad thing is the two tan bricks that clash with the rest of the color wing attachment this is how the wings are attached to the cockpit on each side unfortunately the design on this part is not so good and sometimes the wings break off plus this part is very blocky and there is a big juniorized piece on the base of the wings wings here is what each wing looks like there are three parts on each wing a middle and two fins the wings are very aerodynamic with a diamondlike design note the imperial insignias and the blue tiles lining the wings wing attachments contd here again you see how the middle wing part is attached to the base juniorized piece and the fins attached to the base by hinges the hinges allow the fins to fold in and out a bit but again this is very fragile and the fins often break off gun placements this is an example of four guns on the ship one on the tip of each fin the guns consist of a tile with a tenic tunnel hole on the bottom attached to a technic pin which is attached to a black bar a good design altogether back here you see the rear of the cockpit you can see why the opening mechanism is so flimsy the whole top and front is connected to the body only by a weak hinge system as seen in the picture also note the small transblue dish and the four transred studs minifigure finally here is the single figure that comes in this set a tie pilot it is an all black figure with a life support system decal on the front and a helmet with silver imperial insignias an overall good minifig with a different helmet mold than the stormtrooper or shadowtrooper well i suppose thats about all lets get to the final verdict build 610 a little difficult due the flimsiness of the ship but should only take the average builder no more than 30 minutes playability 710 its fun to fly around   but has no real functions swooshability 710 you can swoosh it around fairly well just be careful not to accidentally break it minifigs 810 a good fig although having only one leaves something more to be desired design 410 very very flimsy with the wings windshield and fins but good for display price 710 i think it was actually 30 usd when i got it but im not sure overall score 65 an average set very delicate so much that you can hardly pick it up but good for display the minifig is okay and having no stickers is good i would recommend this to a hardcore ot fan that wraps it all up please vote your opinion on this set in the poll and ill see you next review edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0310 am	neutral

name jetport fire squad set no 6440 theme lego system  town year 1991 pieces 84 minifigs 2 price usd 2750 which equals about eur 1926€ and gbp 1557£ introduction one of the sets that especially my cousin likes is this one one time at the dutch legoworld event we had three of those there with flashing lights and loud sirens trying to put out the fire that was caused by the crash of again some lego aircraft we never had this set before our drak ages and the sets probably came from ebay or so in my opinion the newest airport rescue is nice too but in the conclusion i will make some additional remarks about that just imagine what it would be like for your lego town if the pilot of one of your smaller planes just couldnt stop before the end of the runway here you see the disaster that happened some day in our town fortunately all passengers got out safely thanks to our brave fire fighters this magnificent truck was used to help putting out the fierce fire caused by the aviation gas from the small plane the set includes two firefighters in distinguishable airport uniforms in order to be able to safe the passengers and go for a quick intervention our brave firemen have an axe for each of them airtanks and a portable fire extinguisher here you see the truck on the right side the large spout on the roof really makes it a remarkable truck as you can see behind the red door there is space for the airtank of our brave firemen at the right there is also place for the small hand held extinguisher the left side of the truck has a water hose instead for a truck from 1991 there is quite some room inside actually both firemen fit inside unfortunately there is only one seat at the back there are two clips for the axes there you can also find the main switch for the light and sound system as you can see the red flashing lights do their job quite well the sirene is just behind the bar with the flashing lights the main spout just seems to begin emitting water the front of the truck for some reason there are two hidden spouts there as well what their purpose is seems unclear but they look nice kimt suggests that it is for foaming the runway and that is a real option of course this set can be found on peeron lugnet brickset bricklink entries playability 810 very nice set details that are movable and of course the light and sound design 810 nice sets with nice details but could have even been better seat for 2nd fireman missing no oxigen masks and only one airtank price 710 for a light and sound set and two firefighters the price is reasonable i would say overall 810 nice sets some details could even be better too bad that there is only a five to choose from a sticker when you have more than one truck last but not least an overview of the complete set including instructions fire mastered as the dutch firefighters will say when they have completed their job we have also bought the newer airport rescue truck 7891 however we think this 6440 one is much better the light and sound all the nice features and the nice details are much better than the new truck edited by jopiek 11 september 2008  1025 am	positive

information name fire control center set no 4953  peeroncom theme lego legoland year 1991 pieces 516 minifigs 4 price usd 8500  gbp unknown  eur unknown bricklink search results brickset lugnet introduction this week i got the flu so since i have to stay home and get better i might as well make a review its one of the most amazing older city sets thus making it a really valuable review this is the story about four handsome firemen living in one of the most amazing city structures out there the 6389 fire control center the box i actually didnt remember the box to be that small borrowed from peeron the four hunky firemen oh jeah what women doesnt like a man in a uniform the manual even the manual is aging but then again its 17 years old review as you all know a city must have some standard civil services like a hospital and a police station a fire house also is a must for any lego city this particular fire house is one of the most amazing sets ever to be released in this cool set you get 4 minifigs all fire fighters two verhicles and a helicopter firefighters have to move around the futuristic fire truck is definately my favourite chiefs car the smallest verhicle of the set its a small allterrain jeep for the fire chief pretty much a standard car in those days a real simple layout and a trunk which holds a small fire hose its lucky to be in this set because it complements the whole thing the car luckily its red and it has de cool signs on the side helicopter another great addition to the whole set is the helicopter again in a basic setup for that kind of verhicle at the time this one has the nice addition of two hoses to put out the fires raging in lego city the chopper no it doesnt really fly really cool fire truck thingy this fire truck is definately the best of the verhicles in this set its actually a futuristic model of fire trucks i havent seen any other fire truck like this i saw a police truck like it though but were talking fire fighters right actually the whole thing han open up to reveal a number of fire fighting appliances such as a hose a computer and a oxygen tank the fire truck click for bigger version the main building actually looks kinda empty when the trucks and chopper are gone however this still is realistic compared to a real fire house also the front has those amazing sliding doors which make this thing really look cool and clean off to fight a fire main structure with the slinding doors pulled down actually those sliding doors are also the hard part of the model since all the bricks must be perfectly aligned or else the doors will stutter but if youre a little familiar with lego then you dont need to worry from the back enough room to play with im going to give my perspectives on each of the sides on the left we have the garage for the bigger fire truck the only real flaw about this set is that this garage isnt long enough for the fire truck this could have been solved by making it two or three studs longer notice the cool sunroof in the middle we have the chiefs office complete with coffee machine a diversity of computers and a tape recorder most likely to tape any incoming calls a lot of details are crammed up in there just like in the rest of the set to the right is the helicopter platform i really like the greyblueyellow of the platform because it doesnt look so red anymore dont get me wrong red is a cool color but not too much red and the helicopter actually fits and stays in place during playtime the baseplate filled up this picture says it all again the four lego hunks are greeting all the ladies the minifigs are from a classic series this happens with more of my lego sets bottom line is that this set is one of the best fire houses lego created verdict the build is pretty easy but takes a while to really see where you are with your building its nice to have a hospital from the same era this create a more uniform look to your city once you completed the model your baseplate is pretty filled up but still has a lot of opportunities playability 1010 cool trucks a chopper and sliding doors nuff said design 910 insanely good design price 1010 couldnt get better than this overall 9610 with a score like that one can only say get one now time to go home the trucks and chopper back on their rightful spots	positive
i have this one the newer 6571 station is better in some ways but i always liked the big airportstyle fire engine in this and the windows covering the garages one mod project i have in mind is to expand the base adding a second room in the area beneath the control center interestingly this set had two different box pictures there was the original 1989 yellow legoland box and a 1991 blue system box and the blue box has the vehicles in different places quote price usd 8500  gbp unknown  eur unknown if this is referring to the original price it wasnt that much 50 is more like it	neutral
this set looks real nice but a wall in the middle with a stair and a few deskscontainers	neutral
big supie on sep 7 2008 0946 pm said i think the 6382 fire station is the better one from the 80ies i agree have that 6382 set for about 27 years now but i have always like that one futuristic truck when i was a child so i also still have some feelings for this set as well crazydance nice review after all	positive
this looks like a great set i like the futuristic fire truck that might be what i do with my imperial shuttles glass cockpit	positive
from memory argos sold it originally for about £21 gbp i seem to remember this as i could not afford the airport released the same year as this was about £2999 seems such a small amount of money now now have 2 copies of this set only 1 boxed 	positive
nice classic set are those hoses around the engine pneumatic tubes that technic catalog looks interesting too i have the catalogs for the next several years but not that one quote this is the model at step five the piston is already attached imagine this state on step 5 in modern sets back then lego had challenging instructions not the step madness like today the most extreme example of this was the engine step in the 8865 set which uses over 120 pieces by itself	neutral
great review i really love the seat and the great possibilities with the alternate models also congratulations for getting that set in perfect condition	positive
name electric passenger train set no 7725 theme lego  system  trains  12v  train set year 1981 pieces 485 minifigs 1 price usd 7000 which equals about eur 50€ and gbp 40£ introduction our most favorite theme is 12v trains actually i got my first 77series back in 1981 5th of december i was 25 years old just a week before my brother was born some years later i got the 7740 after our dark ages we my brother cousin and myself got all 12v trains at least once this 7725 was gathering dust in my brothers room the train in all its splendor as you can see it doesnt occur at the back of the 12v era train instructions although its larger brother the 7740 does some investigation learned that all the sets at the back of the instructions date from 1980 so the 7725 wasnt released yet here you can see the front of the 7725 with the driver in the cockpit the driver is in fact the only minifig that was included in the set as you can see our version of the train has a different front than the one in the instructions apparently the former owner used 7861 lighting set 12 v to upgrade the train with working back and frontlights i like the original lights but didnt notice that the train had those double lights until i did the review maybe we will give the train again its original signs and put custom leds in it or so so that the train can drive into two directions with accurately working lights another thing about the lights that puzzle me are the backlights while typing this i realise that the former owner might have added those so lets have a look at the instructions then as it turns out the lights are there also in the instructions i recently learned that only the last car or coach of a train has its red lights on so unless the train drives with only the front car it will never use those red backlights here you can see the cockpit with the engineer the cables dont look very pretty but well the train at least has working light here you can take a look at the inside of the engine car while the 7745 has a nice fake engine there just the weight bricks and the ugly cables apart from the engineer and his cockpit no other nice features here btw lego always used tiles in such a trains to make it easier for kids to take off the roof and have access to the minifig passengers etc here the proof that it is an electric train the pantograph of the front car it has the same kind of panthographs that the 7745 has the middle car has 4 chairs as you can see some vandal must have nocked over this one hope they leave the cables alone this early morning train seems to have one passenger a workman i like the small 2x3 windows from this car very much they give this care a nice look also the door in the middle adds something special to the train as far as i know no other passenger train has the doors in the middle here you see the side of the train just after the train has left brickingham station where the worker probably from set 6647 highway repair that was also released in 1980 a closeup of the last car with steering stand to allow the train to travel back and forth without having to make head in other words putting the engine in front again the train shunted to an end track so it can be cleaned i think it is apparent that it definitely needs cleaning very badly this set can be found on peeron lugnet brickset bricklink entries playability 510 the train is fine but with only one minifig not very playable without other sets also no accessories at all design 710 nice train the inside could have been a lot better but i really like to original front lights price 710 the train came with motor so not a bad price goes now for quite some money at ebay overall 6510 nice set but the 7745 is a better train im sure well that was it for today i hope you have enjoyed this review and got tears in your eyes seeing how nice the 12v era was it never comes back but maybe lego rereleases some of this sets in the 2009 train era very likely that this is just wishful thinking edited by jopiek 12 september 2008  0456 pm	neutral
freddie on sep 7 2008 1152 pm said a very nice review jopiek you know i was wondering how lego could justify having two 12vpowered passenger trains at the same time but after reading the review and seeing the lack of figures and accessories i guess i understand why plus the train is rather compact oh and i cant help but think that the chairs in the middle carriage are somewhat oddly placed because those placed next to the door are unusable because the door takes up room needed for figs arms also it appears that your set also has the newer couplers ie theres no hooks for the decoupling rail to grab hold of with the light assembly it really wont matter playwise or if you dont have any decouplers but its still a bit of a bummer the chair was just loose so it should be placed on the 2x2 plate that is also visible in the picture of the middle car btw the front magnet is the old type i have some decouplers but we dont use them because they are not really that reliable lego just release a whole line of trains at the same time i just discussed with my parents and they told be lego had those sets longer in store back then i must have gotten the 7745 somewhere in 1983 or even 1984 although it was released in 1981 i started of with the 7710 push along train and then upgraded the tracks with current rails when i got the 7745	positive
a nice old classic the driver has a nice hat and torso and the train is well designed except for that thing on the roof	positive
jopiek on sep 7 2008 1120 pm said the chair was just loose so it should be placed on the 2x2 plate that is also visible in the picture of the middle car thats not the one i was thinking of it was the other two chairs towards the middle of the wagon that i was thinking of if you try to seat a minifig in either of them youll quickly find that its impossible beacuse the door interferes with the figs required personal space if you move both of them one stud forward so that the back of the seat lines up with the edge of the window itll solve the problem and still leave space for a figs to be seated in the other chairs	neutral
a great review for a great set thanks for sharing it with us a like the older lego trains btw i think you need to fix this quote name jetport fire squad light and sound series	positive
the best 12v legotrain is for me the 7740 the 7725 is still a goodlooking train and the only one with short wagons in a electric version before i started to with bricklink i started to build this train in blue ive build 4 trains of it and sold 2 of them still one for sale  you can also build this in other colors like a yellow one or you can build a black version which i made a death train of it driven by a skeleton  edited by panda9001100 17 may 2009  0801 am	positive
are you going to review the other 12v sets if you have the time	neutral

i had never seen these sets before in my retail stores before however i do remember the existence of its video games look like an interesting set for great outdoor enterainment and fun for lego citizens whom is out for real thrill and excitement this theme never really got me excited back then after reading your review its quite useful for some new addition to your town features such as including a skater boy holding the pizza instead of using the pizza van the high fuel cost must have caught up to them to resort using skate board for delivery as for the street surfer vehicle its a cool looking vehicle with unique construction pardon me i have not seen such design before i will actually tear off the wheels cover up the sides and used it for wind surfing thats the whole idea after giving some thoughts and weighs its factors i will have to give it a 3 for this set i will probably get it if its on sales once again brickster this is a lovely review which has showed us a new perspective of island xtreme stunts	neutral
nice review i got this set not long after my ending of the dark ages it was even then already on slae for just 5 euro i like the figs and the vehicles it were some of my first orange pieces the hippie guy is called  snap lockit and the pizza guy is called  pepper roni i think the legodesigners had a cosy evening with much beer when they thought about the names i think this line was the only line which was made first as computergame and after that as a real line instead of the other computergames based on already existing lines	neutral
wout on oct 16 2008 0100 pm said the hippie guy is called  snap lockit and the pizza guy is called  pepper roni i think the legodesigners had a cosy evening with much beer when they thought about the names thanks for that bit of info im not familiar with the computer game or the characters although i may have heard the name pepper roni do you know the island girls name not included in this set though	neutral
her name was sky lane its quite sad though to actually play the gamethe xtreme tower is the only set that made it into the game itself and it was a really watered down version of the information center from the first two games but the island was in the game filled with incredible buildings that would have made really cool sets	negative
air chase woosh the bricksters seaplane flies over the beach quickly hippie dude is in close pursuit on his hang glider fuel is running out for the bricksters plane can hippie dude catch him before he either gets away or crash lands in the water you decide with island xtreme stunts air chase set  6735 theme island xtreme stunts year released 2002 piece count 83 minifigs 2 list price 10 usd a nice addition to the island xtreme stunts theme air chase includes two air vehicles a seaplane and hang glider the set has nice island colors inclusing white light blue and orange also includes in the set are some great chrome pieces for the bricksters airplane wings starting with the box you can see hippie dude in close pursuit the back of the box depicts some nice alternate jet skis same front box picture on the instructions and on the backside pictures of the video game air chase includes two nicely detailed figs hippie dude for lack of his official name and the brickster heres a picture of the orange hangglider and the underside unfortunately the hangglider is too heavy to be held up by a minigig while i like the brickbuilt glider for the extra pieces the plastic wing pieces from the ninja theme would have worked effectively and be a lot lighter i think the seaplane is the best part of the set heres a shot of the front end i like the skeletal sharkfish design whats great is none of the pieces use stickers they are all printed including the tail end although the cockpit has no steering wheel or lever piece it does have a very nice printed 1x2 tile the wings of the airplane have hinges to allow them to fold inward slightly also notice the nice chromesilver pieces heres a shot of the underside of the seaplane and lastly the complete set final thoughts air chase is another one of those fun island sets two figs with two vehicles make a perfect combination for creating some dogfights in the air at the same time the bricksters plane can land in the water to explore other adventure play opportunities this set is also a nice addition to the island xtreme stunts truck  stunt trikes 6739 the seaplane can be hauled by the large semitruck included within 6739 hope you enjoy this review	neutral
nice review is that one minifig breaking out of prison just wondering about his clothing the worst thing is the name anything with xtreme in the title almost deserves the lowest score possible on principle	negative
hippie dude thats snap lockitt island xtreme is one of the best themes ever im trying to get the sets off bricklink thanks fo the review i need this now	neutral
it is not very often that i rate a legoset poor its the first time actually but in this case i had no other option the idea of this set is good and i like the mostly yellow minifig but the design of both the airplane weird windowpiece a propellor that is way too small minimal skies underneath and a strange colourscheme and the hangglider two handlebars on the wings too many colours makes the set mark the essence of legos downfall during those years i really appreciate the fact that you made a review of this set brickster it made me look into the details of 6735 but i am just as sure today as i was back then i will never buy this anyway thanks for the review the quality of the set may be a disapointment your review certainly is not	negative
thanks for the nice review whitefang i quite like this set the front looks a bit bare but for a small set like this it doesnt really matter this set gets a 4 from me as well	positive
thanks erdbeereis1 for your kind words glad you liked this set just wondering whom has rated poor and below average i will like to know why you voted this way perhaps you could share with me and the rest on your thoughts and views	neutral
i love the classic sets of that era and a great review helps show off the simplicity of some older sets	positive
what would we do without the trucks of legoland to clean up our town well i didnt want to find out so i bought this set straight away 7991 recycle truck set info set name 7991 recycle truck released 2007 theme city price usd 1499gbp 1299eur 1495 pieces 206 minifigs 1 review time leading off the box the front shows the recycle man loading up the trash can one thing here is really bizarre on lego sh and everywhere else it says that this set is called recycle truck which makes sense as it has a recycle logo on the truck however on my box it says the set is called garbage truck has this happened to anyone else or is it just me here is the back of the box which shows some of the things you can do with this set the bags with this set you get 3 bags which are numbered and do you see what i see yes thats right the dss is in a bag so it doesnt get bent why tlg doesnt do this more often is beyond me bag 1 the set comes with a very nice selection of pieces a large number of these are orange manual silly me i forgot to take a picture of the front of the manual the picture is the same as on the front of the box the back shows some of the 2007 city sets in a nice little scene and inside minifig here is the friendly garbagerecycle man he looks nice but with the same head as so many other city figs before him come on tlg give us some new heads the sticker sheet the stickers actually are pretty decent as far as stickers go i like the recycle sign after bag 1 this is where we stand after the first bag is built bag  2 the parts contained in the second bag more nice orange pieces here extra parts some nice 1x1 slopes and 1x1 round plates everything built now that everything is built lets check it out the design of the set is very nice and the color scheme looks great when you see it you immediately know what it is the back has a droid arm that acts as a handle to dump the trashrecycling in the truck its simple but works well here you can see the dumping mechanism it works by a sliding technic beam with a stopper on top of the truck you can store the workers cart this works really well i think though that the top of the truck overall looks a bit jumbled up with a few too many different colors the bottom trash dumping time this is a good feature of the set a very well built snot front section this looks fantastic with the grills and number plate sticker someone has left a big mess on the street brickshelf folder ratings price 1010 for 15 this is a very good deal at 206 pieces parts 910 lots of orange design 910 a very well designed set especially the front playability 910 the trash dumper is fun and the added broom and cart make for good play value build 810 simple but stayed interesting overall4550 brickset lego sh bricklink peeron taking out the trash summary this is a great small set for the price with fun features nice colors and good design i would certainly recommend this set no matter what its really called thanks and happy building	positive
this is one of those sets that make me really want to start building up a city its a great value has a lot of useful pieces and is just plain fun to play with i do miss vehicles having doors though great review i was a bit curious as to how the dumping mechanism worked as well as the sticker count	positive
yeah the name on this set is strange i think all the boxes say garbage truck i guess its up to each builder to decide whether 1x1 round plates are recyclable material or not its a great model in any case i love these highly detailed city trucks weve been getting during the last year or two i used to have a preference for the late 80searly 90s city line but some of these new sets have really surpassed them in detail and functionality	positive
i own this set and i think its a really nice truck but there is two little details that i didnt like  1 a recycle truck really needs 2 minifig one to drive one to put the garbage on the back 2 the big hole behind the driver seat it was easy to fill it like this  with hole pouf  no more little hole but this is really a great set anyway 45 for me  above average 	positive
nice review this is a very nice vehicle one of my favorite of the newer city ones jopiek there are two generations of road plate that are wide enough for sixwide vehicles like this the current plates are dark grey with plain white printing and look not great in my opinion the previous ones are imo the best road plates of all time  green with dark grey road white dotted linezebras drain covers and yellow verge markings just like we really have here in ireland for urban area i would still choose the greenedged plates and just cover up the green  the markings are so much better than the current plates	neutral
trop beau	positive
jopiek on sep 10 2008 0145 am said also it will not empty completely because of that panel actually it does the back part of the truck with the panel hinges up so that when you want the truck to dump it doesnt get in the way	positive
a good set with a nice color scheme i still prefer the last one that had a removable bin	positive
what a great set and a very nice review erdbeereis i think the only improvement to this set would have been the use of chrome exhaust pipes and front grill i bought this set with a lot of excitement but unfortunately have not put it together yet what are your thoughts on these larger 6stud wide detailed vehicles as opposed to 4stud wide classics heres an image of 6668 recycle truck released in 1992 ps i like the use of taking out sponge bob in your review	positive
this looks like a great set and im happy you were dumping spongebob he deserves that this set looks very nice and if i see it i will probably pick it up	positive
thanks for this review i really love this set its perfect for my town and brings a sense of classic when i see it	positive
thanks for the review this is one of the few city sets that i own despite loving the theme so much most of my town is either custom or classic and its about as beautiful as a big garbage truck can ever be quote nice truck indeed but the yellow one is better i think at least if you put them on a roadplate it seems to me that those road plates are too small for that also it will not empty completely because of that panel well for the rest it is a nice set and a fine review well the truck barely fits onto the old roadplates not on curves though so if you put it in a display it probably wont look bad i think from what i see this and all the other 6 wide vehicles will fit much better on the newer roadplates which are four studs wider than the old ones	positive
hi i bought this set a while ago and have since remodeled it into a larger 8 wide truck now it can hold a driver and passenger its kind of boxy i may redesign it in the future	neutral
thats a really nice mod badsneaker the added bulk serves it well	positive
nice review i realy need to pick up this set and the cement truck too	positive
it would be cool if someone made a moc in which hippies steal the truck and cover it with flowers and bright colors and stuff	neutral
