these are my only space base plates from classic space actually with only 2 plates i could not do much serious expansion with it instead i merged it with my old city baseplates and used it as a docking station for scientific purposes or restricted facilities that is guarded by the police these baseplates are very useful and is suited for creating a space command center up in the space  	positive
these are pretty good but i think they look too much like the standard town roads from that period i like the black space plates from the early 90s better 6710	negative
cp5670 on jul 7 2008 1004 pm said i like the black space plates from the early 90s better 6710 awesome i had not seen these before they would really make nice plates for a sw death star scene thanks for sharing	positive
first what i liked sooooo much was the cover of these plates with this large picture of a classic space scene i still have a 306 misb just to keep that nice feeling of taking it out of a plastic box and look at it there were different versions of the cover though second the markings of the landing platform changed at some point id have to check it later when im at home think it had something to do with the interupted yellow lines	negative
these plates are great in setting up your space base and giving your ships a place to land my favorite though is the lunar crater plate which i use to death in my comic 	positive
why pay 350 dollars just download the instructions on buy the pieces off bricklink this is was i did when i wanted to create the blacktron ii in the futuron colour scheme also i tend to like both sets of base plates i bought the black ones myself and they were of great use but there more for creating the idea of a city or space station something more completely man made the gray ones give a better look of the roads being laid over bare rock especially when you introduce the plates with the craters i would love to see a 4848 baseplate with roads through them which would allow more building space on the side and maybe some craters also 4848 baseplates with craters but a few different kinds to create more or a realistic look and less of a repeating pattern and with all those rocks you have to put everything up on supports much better looking bases then	negative
lokix on jul 8 2008 0309 pm said why pay 350 dollars just download the instructions on buy the pieces off bricklink thats the problem the instructions arent anywhere to be found not that ive seen the set does seem to have some rare parts but i doubt 350 worth	negative

kdog on jul 8 2008 0948 pm said thats the problem the instructions arent anywhere to be found not that ive seen the set does seem to have some rare parts but i doubt 350 worth by looking at the pictures used to display this set ive a sneaky suspicion it did not come with instructions but meant for the pictures to be ideas the whole set was suppose to teach children to use their imagination giving them instructions would somewhat defeat this while trying to figure how to build things from looking at pictures would be a much better educational experience	negative
i also love these plates i build a lot with them eg this  unfortunately they are not available in bley 	neutral
year released 1976 piece count 53 minifigs 2 lego brought out floating boats quite early and in many ways the first were the best ill explain why later this set in particular is interesting as it came out in two versions one that includes the first minifigs and another that included the nonarmless type set 709 the police signs are stickers and are in surprisingly good condition considering the age of the set i am missing one sticker on the front though note the technic bush and axel they are the old type the position of the second figure is not a mistake i think hes supposed to be sitting down the first boats out by lego needed a weighted keel to prevent them keeling over i have tested this i suspect this is because of the density of the old hulls and the flat bottom but i could be wrong it cant be just because of the flat bottom as the new cargo ship doesnt need one the keel in detail the bottom extension is for a motor not included nor made by lego at the time the keel had longer studs even now it holds extra firmly this is why i prefer the old design you can extend or shorten the hulls as you please or even insert other lego in the middle you can easily add wheels or any other piece to the bottom of these hulls i wish they would go back to this idea the 4 hulls were of this concept but were too wide probably so the keel wasnt needed the old minifigs aside from having odd feet and no arms had a normal stud as the neck thus when you turn the head it tends to come off i love this set	negative
thebrickster on jun 22 2008 0141 am said it looks like your boat is in really good shape considering its 30 years old excellent review i know i got it for a song on ebay most 1970s sets dont seem to be in much demand	neutral
how about these policemen are unarmed	neutral
nice review sinner the old sets i donÂ´t know  every old set especially equipped with the old nonmoveable arms minifigs look very odd nowadays i agree with you with the hull shape and its possibility to be extended but every other aspect the lack of detail the keel itself you canÂ´t float it in shallow water keeps me from rating it higher than 310 in my opninion the best police boat so far is 4021 click to enlarge	negative
i love those minifigs theyd go for alot on ebay i bet great boat as well i love the old hull design	positive
this set showed what potential variations on the standard brick had back then i think that tlg was still finding its legs back then and learning new things so this is a solid set for the year it was released nice review sinner	positive
thank you for the nice review sinner holodoc on aug 1 2008 0859 am said nice review sinner the old sets i donÂ´t know  every old set especially equipped with the old nonmoveable arms minifigs look very odd nowadays i agree with you with the hull shape and its possibility to be extended but every other aspect the lack of detail the keel itself you canÂ´t float it in shallow water keeps me from rating it higher than 310 in my opninion the best police boat so far is 4021 click to enlarge well if youre meaning really old sets than i agree with you but a lot of the sets from the very late 1970s and onwards are still very nice this set just isnt a good example thats all oh and i also agree with you about that police boat however the newer one in the city line is also great imo the only thing that weighs against it is the giant size which makes it feel awkward in more classic towns edited by grevious 03 august 2008  0630 pm	negative
lol i cant help but smile everytime i see the quote on this thread dont worry these police are armless lol	negative
well what to say i got this boat late 70s when we were on our way to italy to spend the holidays there my parents always needed to keep my quiet during the 3day trip and the best way to do that was to buy me a lego set i got this one in a gas station in germany as far as i remember italy didnt have lego sets so a gas station close to the italian border but still in germany or austria was very often their last chance i often saw large quantities of lego sets in those gas stations though i remember seeing yellow castle and the galaxy explorer standing on a shelf it would be my birthday 13 weeks later so i always made sure they knew what to buy for me	positive
so youve been bitten by the classic bug too sinner great review but one would think arms would come in handy pun intended when you are a police officer right its a shame that many of the original figs must now be forced to stand looking like they have their hands in their pockets eh i have no idea where i was going with that last sentence	neutral
as you may have seen in my topic in general lego discussion i received a bunch of old lego from my stepgrandmotherinlaw among the bricks were instructions and pieces for an almost complete set 345 from 1969 i was very excited to find this out so i put it together i recently took it apart and reassembled it taking photographs along the way for the sake of eurobricks so without further ado set 345 house with car first off is the car this was still constructed in the bucket of bricks i received so i never took it apart next ill show you the instructions lots of added bricks per step which was fun however the angle of the instructions sometimes made it difficult to find where things were supposed to go the inbuild shots finally an allaround view of the finished set sadly i dont have much time to post more pictures or thoughts however ill try to come back and update the review later this week until then enjoy	positive
way before my time tooin fact this set came out twenty years before i was born the baseplate doesnt actually have dotsim not sure if they were there once and then rubbed off a possibility as the studs are rather smoother than i imagine they once were or if this particular one didnt have the dots this set also shows that the difficulty lego has in doing vehicle scale isnt new the house is the perfect size for microfigures from the lego games however the car is massiveover twice as tall as a microfig	neutral
great review mariko this set is way before my time too i like how lego used to create simple one story houses instead of the really tall house that we see in todays town theme such as 8403 city house one story houses such as 345 just look more realistic to my eyes the simplistic minimalism vibe that i get with this set is something that is hard to find in todays much more detailed sets although trust me i love love love todays detailed sets  the brick is epic	positive
image link from brickset i thought i would do a pic review of the 1st lego castle the yellow castle 375 released in 1978 first let me say that this set was truly ahead of its time it introduced new building concepts such as the hinge and new figs most were still the armless faceless minifigs during this time this set introduced me to castle which was my first real favorite theme i enjoyed breaking it out from the garage and building it again the majority of the pieces are 1x1 1x2 1x3 1x4 1x6 and 1x8 standard yellow bricks the set also includes yellow 1x4 1x6x2 and 1x8x2 arches yellow 2x2 2x3 and 2x4 bricks various grey plates 1x2 black inverted slopes red drawbridge pieces two classic red castle doors 8 hinges 2 for each corner and a few other nifty pieces including six red 1x1 windows a complete inventory is available at peeron 375 inventory a view from the front the drawbridge is 6x8 the front tower stands 12 13 bricks high plenty of room for horses the drawbridge does work the string originally black is attached to the opposite side between a plate and the arches the right side of the castle identical to the left ive always loved the 2x2x3 sloped bricks and corner pieces the back i love these red doors a 1x4 brick attached to the other side of the baseplate keeps intruders out that banner was the original sticker piece notice the wear the rear tower largest of the towers and backside two hinges at each of the corners allow the corners to open for playability before opening open lots of arches add to the detail of the inner walls inner front this set included 14 figs how about that for quantity unfortunately i peeled off worn stickers from the shields and the breast plates years ago the blue castle guards and knights are the keepers of the castle i still think that these helmets are the best lego ever made they just look good the black and white knights and the red knights ive always prefered to use the black and red guards and flags from the knights joust sets conclusion the yellow castle is truly a classic set and im so glad i kept the pieces to this together after all these years if you have a chance to buy one or even obtain the set instructions its worth building and wouldnt be difficult to substitute grey or other colors i hope you enjoyed this review and feel free to share your comments	positive
nice review i havent built yellow castle for many years but i do remember the fun i had building it when i was young yellow castle just opened up an entire new world for me also i liked all the alternate models on the box od wish i still had that	positive
question for you guys whats the best way to clean lego i was noticing that the baseplates and gray plates to this set are very dusty and could use a good cleaning mild soap water soak is there a better way	neutral
kimt on dec 28 2005 0252 pm said toothbrush and mild soap  and lots of time gently scrubbing a cleaning and great review  i love that set wub wub im sorry that you seem to miss the stickers  if you find somewhere to download printable copies of them please let me know satis kimt thanks for the tip i tried it on a few pieces and they look much better unfortunately it does take a lot of time i need a lego cleaning machine with this many pieces	positive
the original knights displaying their bright colored shields and breast plates and a good wash helped to brighten them up	neutral
quote im also impressed by the colors of the shields even a good cleaning wouldnt do that with my old shields have you ever tried replacing the heads by modern heads just to see how that would look remember never try to clean stickers  kimt	neutral
imperialjohn on dec 29 2005 0206 pm said you might find the stickers here ive searched that page before  it doesnt have the stickers but it has a lot of other useful ones od thebrickster send me a link to a page that has remakes of the good old classic shields and more you can find it here thanks brickster satis  kimt	neutral
ive tried this once remember normal white sticker sheet in an ink jet and the transparent plastic on top  ps the one on the right is the homemade one	neutral
imperialjohn on dec 29 2005 0511 pm said ive tried this once remember normal white sticker sheet in an ink jet and the transparent plastic on top  ps the one on the right is the homemade one so youre using two layers stickers doesnt that make it very thick	neutral
i guess its easiest to put the entire shield on a transparent sticker and cut the edges i would also do that with the white stickers because now you can still see the gray edges of the shield perhaps you can make a bigger black or brown in the other case outline you also wouldnt be able to see if the sticker is exactly in the middle	neutral
quote so youre using two layers stickers doesnt that make it very thick not really i think it works out very fine 1 print out the image 2 put on the plastic 3 cut out the image 4 apply on the part	neutral
indy565 on dec 31 2007 1024 am said wasnt this the first castle lego released hey indy565 we try not to revive old threads imded pointed out how old unless theres something to add now this doesnt mean you can never revive an old thread but just do it when theres a reason  yes i believe it is the oldest	neutral
great review the set is really nice i love that the front of the motercycle can turn and the engine is just beautiful with its half stacked bricks like kieldaman said the price used or new is quite a bit but there is a good variety of bricks here like the bricks inside the wheels did you get this set from your father great review luxorv	positive
wow talk about illegal connections eh great review i really like this set even for its age	positive
luxorv this is a well written presentation on this lego vintage review i never knew the existence of this set and even though the design is not part of the modern lego design concept but the overall appeal back in the 1970s certainly appeal to many i could not mind to own such vintage lego model and put them on display and potray as if it was a chart of evolution of lego motorbikes thanks for sharing and i cant wait to find out your next review	positive
great review for a classic model i love it	positive
rare classic sets are always a priceless part of any lego collection and its a good thing you still have this first set of yours luxor or did you purchase a new one excellent review btw its always a pleasure getting a closer look at these classic sets which i wouldnt have known to exist had i not seen this review overall i think its a really good set at that time of course judging this one by modern standards wont be fair but at the time im pretty sure it was a cool set to have though less cooler than having the harley davidson set	positive
thanks for the review luxorv an interesting old set though i find it hard to imagine a square smoke stack instead of roundish it truly has that classic lego simplistic build with all studs showing and making do with standard partsm except the few you havepointed out luxorv a nice flashback 35 years agonow thats old school anyway brick on everyone 	positive
thank you very much for this wonderful review this is the oldest lego set in my collection i received this model from my grand parents many years ago  im not exactly sure who in my family it used to belong to but it has a home with me now its a very simple but attractive looking vehicle and functions pretty well too overall very nice	positive
thanks for the great nostalgic review great pictures i love the shiny glow of 37 year old bricks sets were simpler back then but not less exciting in their own way i wasnt even born in 1973 but one of my first sets was the 1982 update of this 6630 bucket loader almost 10 years later but the very same bucket assembly only the colours have changed	positive
nice review great nostalgic set like you said it has nice designsimple yet effective i like construction vehicles so this set has even bigger impact on me	positive
ah the good old daysthanks for the review yoshi648  cute and cool at the same time its interesting to see that the same front end parts had been used from the early 70s up in to the late 90s  nice again to step back in time and keep on bricking everyone 	positive
i voted outstanding regarding this set i found mine at a consignment store it was inside of a larger set from the same time period	positive
its simply amazing how far lego has come in 30 years	positive
and again those tears in my eyes with original box i really love those classic space stuff looks like i need to clean my stuff this summer	positive
the computer is my favorite part sadly i dont own any classic spaceexept for some space police and a blue classic space man	positive
nice 442 is the lowest set number i have seen for any classic space set so it must been released with the first wave in 1978 its remarkable that a lego spaceship this old and small can seat more figs than the much bigger mx71 recon dropship of today anyway i just want to grab it out of the screen and swoosh it all over the place lol tlg please make these classic space sets again i promise ill buy many	positive
very brave to give an impression about one of the oldest sets ever reviewed a lot members here are younger than the set itself i think you will have to have grown up with it to like it nowadays we have seen quite a few better airplanes than that one for example this years 7643  but thanks for letting us know btw the 1x1 round brick with the solid stud is no 3062a instead of 3062b with the hollow stud	positive
great job i love reading vintage reviews as it reminds of our childhood days glad to see this in very good condition by the way i will move this to lego trains  town to see if thebrickster will like to include this set inside the review index over there i believe he is maintaining vintage town set reviews over there and this suits there well	positive
fantastic review iÂ´d love to read more like this trivia about oldrare pieces is almost as fun as the set itself	neutral
outstanding review of a very special set i actually remember seeing this set on the store shelves of local department stores can you believe it fantastic review walter i really enjoy looking at these vintage sets this one deserves a blog	positive
in 1977 trans or yellow slopes existed already and using them would have made the plane more realistic a third rear wheel would have enhanced playability and design rather than this ugly black round brick its the reason why i voted below average even considering 1977s standards however this set is nice and simple offering good playability	negative
daoudbazaar on jul 15 2009 0526 pm said  there is no 45Â° slope in the original plane design  and no front cockpit window  except that it wouldnt have been the spirit of st louis oooops youre completely right the spirit of stlouis didnt have any front window nor rear wheel anyway i think a standard ryan m1m2 plane would have been a better choice less a legend but more a flexible plan for multiple uses	negative
i really like the design it has an aesthetic value lacking from most official lego planes and follows closely to the real thing minus the colours something that cant really be claimed for more recent sets	positive
483 alpha1 rocket base year released 1979 piece count 170 minifigs 3 vehicles 1 two sections list price unknown despite the nuclear nonproliferation treaty of 1968 lego dared design a rocket base complete with a rocket system that may have had nuclear capability in 1979 luckily the rocket was defective having rather flimsy white bricks that did not stay together well during launch attempts lego scrapped its wmd program and the result was this classic blue era space set known as the alpha1 rocket base instructions on the backside of the instructions the set is featured with the space command center space cruiser and a few vehicle sets the set includes three figs and this great rocket fuel tanker heres the front section complete with computer and the rocket fuel section the set has some interesting features including the control section fuel control and launch pad on top of the control section is a nicely design radartracking system heres the open control room the launch pad and fuel control the fuel control includes two sink pieces and blue steering wheels and legos wmd weapon of mass destruction the alpha1 on the launch pad heres a shot of the launching mechanism unfortunately i have lost one of the blue sinkfaucet pieces as well as a black hose a closeup of the alpha1 rocket the white bricks never stayed together well often times coming apart within your hands the arming and guidance system was nicely designed a view of the complete set and another this is a great set the base fuel vehicle and launch platform offers a great amount of playability my only complaint is the rocket as mentioned above i dont think i ever played with it a sa kid because it always fell apart share your comments regarding this classic space set	positive
thebrickster on jul 4 2008 0414 am said a closeup of the alpha1 rocket the white bricks never stayed together well often times coming apart within your hands huh did they not think of putting a technic axle down the center of the rocket come to think of it when were technic axles invented its a neat little set makes me think i oughta make some similar kinda layout in ldd very elegant for playability	neutral
oh did i drool over this set as a kid since i never got it i didnt know how bad the rocket really was great review xenologer on jul 4 2008 1225 pm said come to think of it when were technic axles invented the white ones were	positive

hey ebers i got my market street on monday and finished building it last night i know its not such a nice review like yoda did the last times but i hope you enjoy some of the pics first a pic of the complete building the 3 minifigs and i pic of the stairs one of my highlights at this set more pics you can find here my opinion about the set i like this set very much it was really fun to build it im happy that that i got some more cherries and a croissant now sweet  a funny idea is the salad in the one box at the front i think normally its a hairpiece of an exoforce fig i also like the colours of the house the dark blue is sooooo nice i think i have to take more of this soon the lighter blue is also nice this set has really nice details like the stairs or the owl at the entry of the market or the balcony i paid 8999 eur a fair price for a really nice set greetings sandra	positive
thanks for the review my favourite detail is the salad d btw could you exchange the modules and make pics of that id like to see how the building looks with the flat roof instead of the dutch style one im not sure though if the vents on the flat roof makes sense as long as its only used as a garage top  maybe they should be removable as the balconies and such things to make the modularity leading not to weird results other than this in combination with a lot of money and the cafe corner set this really could get me into city 	positive
thanks i love the look of this set i love the mix of colours it breaks up the model rather than being a single monotone colour hes used several complimentary colours in order to make up the model i agree i think the chimneys on the flat roof is weird ontop of the garage but not so weird one you place it ontop of the building i guess hes done it to give us the choice of roofs and chimneys you can always remove the ones you dont like he also seems to have screwed up a bit on the tiling for the sidewalk on the side module on cafe corner and the building module of this set the sidewalk has the pattern light grey 1x6 at the front then dark grey 1x2 next then dark grey 2x2s however on this hes put the 2x2 tiles first then the 1x2s at the back easilly fixable though overall i love this set thanks for the pics compliments cafe corner perfectly	positive
thank you legocastlegirls for your quick review y its the first time i realize the back of the market street the tan bricks are a replacement for some windows id guess i do love that building especially the top floor with the neat balcony wub of course you are again left alone filling the interior but i just had some food parts ordered at bricklink xd one thing id like to know this is an onlineexclusive right can i order it at a legostore kln  oberhausen and get the sum rewarded on my voucher booklet sweet i heard it here but im not sure 8 if anyone is looking for how to fill it with interior go read the latest brickjournal 8 theres a whole chapter written about designing the rooms interior on	positive

nice review and great little story d y look at the normal horses their legs are positioned like that too only the skellie horses legs are touching so as to strengthen the middle otherwise it could easily snap in half also i think the new skeletons are nice their head is awesome i just dont see why tlc couldnt make the bent droid arms with the hand facing vertically instead of making a new arm design completely straight	positive
nice review and a great story also grevious this is a great set and a nice little army builder one at that the only thing that saddens me about the line itself is the new arms on the skelies they just look far to big when placed next to a normal fig for me the old versions of the skelies were far better why tlc changed to this is beyond me still i shall be buying alot of these sets just to increase my army	positive

here is a review of the new monster dino creator set with power functions first lets start with the box which is much larger than it needs to be it is one of the new style recloseable boxes rather than the rip the sides style this set is typical of creator and comes with three sets of instructions the monster dino a kind of spider and a crocodile the set comes with two of the new motors one small and one large a sound module plus the new ir controler and receiver there is a mix of techniques in this set the core is mainly studless technic there are some studded technic parts and most of the details are standard creator style there are two mechanisms one to control the legs and one to control the head and arms the leg drive is from the large motor and the arm and head are operated from the small motor the completed mechanism will stand on its own without any detail added the detail is added to the base unit to complete the model the operation of the dino is very good the design for the motors and drives is very compact and well thought out the walking motion works well although there is no steering and it will fall over it it encounters obstacles the sound module is built into the head so when the mouth opens the dino roars sort of glyman made the comment that this set is ugly as sin and i tend to agree i think there are too many colour variations with different shades of grey black and that lime green p which confuses the look of the finished model but i guess it might apeal more to younger kids i also do not like the spikes along the back which glow in the dark because the are loose and keep falling off this set is not cheap at 70 but i guess this is because of the motors and ir controller while on this i was surprised how good the range was on the new controller it would still operate ever when not in direct line of sight i would give this set a 1010 for playabilityit has kept the kid amused for hours i would give it 610 for value for money it is a bit pricey overall 810 it took approx 3 hours to build and has been well played with i have posted some more images and some videos of the finished models on my brickshelf page here if you have any questions please ask pete edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0628 pm indexed	positive
thanks for your review ickelpete y nice little movie you made whats on tv in the background  d after reading i wonder more than before what this dino has to do with creator wacko the complete mechanism is technic only the designpieces on top are classicstyle i agree with your comment on the colourselection x is that turquise next to lime looks like  well im not telling you what i think of right now  pretty lego set but not for me im waiting for the first pics of the ferris wheel or even better the 8275 technicbulldozer  wub new motors on	positive
thanks very much for that review i downloaded the instructions last week and i was largely impressed with what was in it however like holodoc i am waiting for the bulldozer i might have to settle with the dino though if lego charge australian some absurd price edit i just watched the videos thanks they are great the dino is better than i thought edited by sinner 10 july 2007  0229 am	positive
thank you very much for that interesting review ickelpete y well the color schemes pretty bad and the design of that dinos a bit to blocky for my liking but the two alternative models youve builtre quiet nice at least therere a lot of possibilities coming with that set 	neutral
ugly as hell but an awesome parts pack worthy of purchase	neutral
 such a beauty the functions are great cool video i want to get this set so badly great review y	positive
i bought this set last night and it is great my biggest surprise was the wheels that were included i didnt even know they existed and there arent even that new back to the set he is such a cute dinosaur d since he is so tubby i think he looks like a baby i suspect my wife wanted him more than me my biggest interest in the set was to have more motors and ir parts so i could make an ir car overall i highly recomend this set but as others have said be warned that the box is very oversized i wish lego would give up on this whole 11 picture thing wacko	positive
the box is has really strange dimensions  its very flat but has a large front  the 11 scale regarding the spines because theyre made of the softer nonabs plastic the stuff the 1994 cutlasses and brown muskets were made of they lose their shape a bit and so are hard to grip they simply fall off i suppose tlc use loads of different colours because a single or twocolour dino isnt very nice to look at especially when the surface isnt very smooth  it takes your eyes away from the surface and puts it on the colours someone should make an all terrain dino that can walk everywhere from this set  i dont have the skill with technic  i always end up layering and never finish any models 	negative
got this baby via shophome a little early and i though it was time to post my view of this set  snefroe you need to get this one   sorry for the lack of pics but there are already many pics online of this baby so here it is  best space set since a way too long time this is my first new space themed set since more than 20 years and i must say that i’m not disappointed at all i have much to say about this little gem first let’s cut it straight about the martians minifigures they are absolutely rubbish i can’t imagine how lego could produce such atrocity this said let’s move on to the dropship a real piece of art reminiscent of the aliens movie dropship the cockpit is spacious and provides a great field of view too bad there is no hinges to open it you must remove the canopy completely to switch pilot the drilling unit can be attached under the ship with the clever use of a rubber piece it stays well in place once attached good point some people don’t like the inclusion of the 2 containment area for the martians and crystal on both side of the ship but i kind like it it makes the ship less empty the 2 wings are complete with air intake some armaments and 1 standard launcher on the right wing normally i don’t like launchers but this one is very discrete and well integrated on the tail section are 2 thrusters that can be rotated and provide thus some “realistic” movements to the ship one of the last highlight of this ship is the landing gears or i must say landing dishes 6 medium sized radar dishes provide and incredible stability to the set they are quite sturdy and can take a beating i’m not going to review the alien spaceship in detail since it’s quite uninteresting i consider it more like a bonus addition to the set than anything else the look is passable and there are some interesting building techniques in it that’s all to end the review a little proscons table we all love proscons table   pros  incredible design  at last a decent space set  modular functions  quite sturdy  beautiful  great value for money cons  martians are rubbish  no hinges for the canopy  the drilling unit could use some more details score 910 by the way  i added a nice cool feature on my site  you can download the stickers for some sets that i own before building i always scan the stickers we never know it could come handy check this out on my site you need to go in the lego lists on the left vtx classic games	positive
mutex on jul 13 2007 1016 am said by the way  i added a nice cool feature on my site  you can download the stickers for some sets that i own before building i always scan the stickers we never know it could come handy check this out on my site you need to go in the lego lists on the left vtx classic games thats a good idea and very nice thanks mutex y nice review hmm now im pretty sure that ill have to mod that cockpit a little when i get that set	neutral
great review i must admit i didnt like mm at first site but seeing this review and looking at the mm boxes at stores appeal to me rather greatly i may get a couple of these sets great job y 	positive
ive got it also but i think ill replace the ball joint pieces with the kind of pieces that give the wings their angle	neutral
great review sweet maybe i will buy this one but not this month buying lego in billund has left me totally broke x 	positive
nice review	positive
the dropships looks neat and your review is good it isnt my theme but it clearly is a fantastic set for the space lovers under us mars mission is really a good step in the right direction for tlc	positive
of course right before i post this i see that ickelpete reviewed this set earlier in the week sorry for being redundant but it is already written so here ya go monster dino reviewed by dunamis set 4958 792 pieces 8995 from lego online store build time 35 hours here we go with another offering from the creator line im kind of fond of these sets as they are pretty imaginative and usually have instructions for multiple models i like the reusability of all the pieces and the varied things you can build the box the box that lego shipped this thing in was absolutely huge when i first got this in the mail i thought i had won the lottery and they had shipped the ucs falcon early once i opened the shipping box i was surprised to see an unusually large creator set box the box itself is pretty standard creator type box but this one shows off the power functions prominently on the right side of the box the back of the box shows some of the motorized features as well opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals were back to the reusable cereal box type tab system for those of you who stay up a night wondering about legos next box design inside the box we have a bunch of sealed bags immediately the power brick remote and motors stand out as they are each in individual bags also there are three manuals the manuals the three manuals are 76 76 and 56 pages in length they are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings  piece call outs for each step  parts inventory at the end of the primary model build  page numbers color separation in these manuals were fine for me interestingly the instructions for the primary build took a full manual plus about a quarter of another manual random manual photos parts list ill explain a bit more below but it would have been nice to have some written documentation on all the functions of the motors remote and receiver such as motor load guidelines and specific explanations of all the remote control functions it is severely lacking in this area the pieces obviously the pieces were most interested in are these new motors and wireless remote control note that before you fire this bad boy up you had better byob since this is prominently a european community i had better clarify my acronyms over here across the pond byob usually means bring your own beer in this case it still means bring your own beer im on my second heineken right now but in addition to numerous bottles of beer you will need a total of nine batteries to get through this set i kid you not anyway there are two motors a small and a large each with its own very unique name according to the manual the smaller one is called motor and the larger one is called xl motor very creative indeed the battery box takes six aa batteries and there are two compartments to hold them here is the first that seems pretty normal however the back side of it holds the other three batteries and it seems to be very poorly designed note in the photo above where the bottom battery is placed compare it to the previous photo and you will see the difference i played around with trying to get that bottom battery out and you better pack a lunch or byob because it is no small task why couldnt they make this compartment just like the other side there is a single power cord connector and a three position switch the middle position turns the power off and the other two positions seem to provide the same functionality in either position as far as i can tell perhaps a little blurb in the manual would have been nice to clear things up a bit the remote takes three aaa batteries it is fairly small and lightweight even with the batteries installed it has two thumb controls which could be levers if you insert technic bars or even pins the two controls are color coded and match the plugs on the receiver to control two separate motors in addition there is a four position switch which i assume changes the channel finally there are two tiny levers that seem to have no function im not sure if they are a trim control or variable speed control i messed with them and didnt notice any difference in the motor speed again some documentation from the incredibly verbose lego manual would have helped as far as the rest of the parts its really a mixed bag there are a lot of varied parts in this set to the point that there is almost one of everything lots of technic gears pins studded beams studless beams axles wheels etc also lots of little 1x1 slopes in various colors teeth horns etc you cant really say it is a parts pack because there is not enough of one thing to make it a parts pack a couple of notes it seems the quality control issue on the axles has been fixed i initially reported this back when i reviewed the 8285 about a year ago all the axles worked fine for me the color quality control issue is still alive check out the different shade of red in these two parts also included is the sound brick this looks just like the other sound or lightup bricks we have been seeing lately it does have a load dinosaur roar sound embedded in it though so hide the younglings if they are a bit on the skittish side finally ive never seen one of these before although someone will no doubt rattle off a dozen sets where you can find this part in about 5 seconds no i am not referring to the studded beam i put that in the photo for scale the build the build was fun and was fairly straightforward as i mentioned there is a lot of technic parts so if you are not a fan of the technic line you should run not walk away from this one there were no gotchas to speak of but you need to pay careful attention to the placement of the wires that go from the motors to the receiver they kind of sneak them around a bit so watch closely otherwise it was fine here is what is left over so far i have only built the primary model as seen on the box there are instructions for two more models both of the other models seem less complex than the primary model and are likely quicker builds the dino took me about 35 hours which included some time to screw around with the motors im an old school technic fan from way back in the 80s so i had some familiarity with the old technic motors obviously 25 years has improved some things and these seem much more powerful the design if you have built the 4507 prehistoric creatures then some of the design will feel familiar especially the head and tail it is almost like they took the dinosaur from that set and figured out how to motorize it this is not necessarily a bad thing just a comment the set does a good job of showing off the features of the new motors and remote it is nice to see how one motor can perform multiple functions in this case the small motor makes both arms move and opens and closes the mouth of the dinosaur when the mouth is completely open it pushes the activation switch on the sound brick which emits the roar sound pretty cool the xl motor handles the walking feature of the dinosaur there is both forward and reverse forward works really well while the reverse just makes the dinosaur look like he is doing a michael jackson moon walk wow i never thought i would use michael jacksons name in a lego dinosaur set review it is almost like the dinosaur cant get traction going in reverse however as noted previously forward works really well this guy actually gets going at a pretty good clip as you might expect he kind of waddles like a duck since there is no articulation in the knees it is a bit awkward but it works the xl motor seems to kick out plenty of power overall the design seems to be a mixed bag the way the tail is attached seems to be an afterthought the arms look to be too small however the walking mechanism and legsfeet are pretty cool as well as the head and mouth i guess it is a reasonable effort to get people introduced to the parts and well see designs improve as time goes on here are a few views of our new friend but what about the atat of course the real reason you are reading this is that you hope i will have some epiphany on how all this relates to the new walking atat judging from the box on the atat it looks like we get one motor i dont see the remote which is a disappointment as i hope it is not controlled by a switch on the body and you either turn the atat on or off if that is the case the first thing i am doing is scavenging the receiver and remote from this set to add to the atat granted it could be that it comes with a remote but is just not seen on the box also the atat box looks like one of the images shows that the head turns i sure hope this is controlled separately as it would be really lame to not be able to control this independently from the walking feature im kind of skeptical on the walking feature of the atat i suspect it will be rather cumbersome but hopefully i will be pleasantly surprised needless to say this is all speculation but those are my initial thoughts based on this set overall thoughts its an ok set kind of pricy but i suspect a large part of that is due to the motors and remote i havent built the other two models they seem less interesting to me but at least it has some variability also you get a ton of different parts which can either be a good thing or bad thing depending on what you are looking for the dinosaur is average the color selection is marginal black and lime green and the tail section is just lame i appreciate it more for the mechanical functions and how the motorized parts work it does do a good job of waking up my dog who seems pretty irritated by it it is a nice set to show off to the neighbors or the endless caravan of my wifes friends that seem to materialize out of nowhere people are quickly impressed by it and then promptly move along once you start trying to explain how it all works im a bit disappointed that the manual did not explain more about the remote and motor functions i suspect that there is more than meets the eye and ill just have to play around with it to find out it would be nice if lego had a website that showed all the cool functions of the motors and remotes so we fully understand the capabilities final rating 72 build 910 pretty quick and fun the mechanical part is cool functionality 610 it is a creator set so you have multiple builds as far as it being a dinosaur its just ok motorized parts are cool though design 610 partly cloudy some things are cool others are lame parts 810 new motors and remote are cool lots of varied parts included but nothing to write home about price 710 it is kind of expensive edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0623 pm indexed	negative
impressive review really clear photos too thanks dr s	positive
great review dunamis i hope you have as much fun with this as i have one point yes they are new axles they have appeared in a few sets this year	positive
ickelpete on jul 13 2007 1106 pm said great review dunamis i hope you have as much fun with this as i have one point yes they are new axles they have appeared in a few sets this year yes the kids seem to love it as you pointed out and the wife still thinks i am crazy so its all good i read your review after i posted mine seems like we shared the same thoughts on a majority of it i always think it is good to have multiple opinions on sets as it gives the community more data points to evaluate a given set	positive
thanks for the bonus review i am still on the fence with this one so every opinion is good dunamis on jul 14 2007 0741 am said but what about the atat in case you dont know the atat in the dark side development kit had a single motor and a moving head it worked by the head simply swinging from side to side due to balence shifts i suspect the atat will be same i also think that there will be no remote for it either edited by sinner 14 july 2007  1131 am	positive
tks once again dunamis for a great indepth review  i really look forward to your supped up and moded atat p i am really not found of the design but i think its still a nice parts pack especially with all these nice power function elements  yoda	positive
thats a nice looking dino set there great review dunamis also on this side of the border see that big thing above the us thats canada where im from byob still means bring your own beer my uncle is already on his third molsons edited by lieutenant colonel thok 14 july 2007  0221 pm	positive
oh is he ugly or what ive never seen a dino that needed to go on a diet more then him d but id get him for the pieces all those limegreen pieces drools but meh im not really in to mindstorms so i dont think id get this but anyway nice review i now know exactly what hes like kml	negative
wowthat set is really something but i prefer pehistoric power and triceratops or are they the same i can never tell	positive
awesome reveiw thanks i gotta get this one y wub	positive
i kind of like the design of this but more importantly i really want to get my hands on the power functions motors and ir control system id prefer the 8275 technic bulldozer but theres no way i can stretch to the 100 price tag so i was thinking i would have to see if i could get a 4958 monster dino cheap in the january sales then two things happened today firstly i saw the dino in tescos reduced from 70 to 55 then my wife said shed buy it for me for christmas wow thats never happened to me before i love my wife wub cant wait till christmas now	positive
ickelpete on nov 4 2007 0641 pm said if you really want the power functions the bulldozer is better value as you get two large motors two small motors and two receivers compared to the one in the dino set alos watch toysrus and argos both have had the bulldozer for 7075 in there pre christmas sales usually for a week only i am hopeing they will be on sale soon as i want a second bulldozer to get some more motors thanks for the tip but even 7075 is too much right now 55 was just about affordable but now my wifes buying for me its going to cost me zero zilch zip nada nothing which is even sweeter xd	neutral
i ended up buying both this and the dozer  i plan on using my dino for a ir car in a month or two	neutral
i ended up buying a misb set recently from a lego collector who is clearing up his collection excellent set to get the ir remote and ir receiver and other motors without paying insane amounts for the bulldozer now there is a quite a number of parts in power miner lime green and 1x1 white teeth plate for the mouth and claws the dino alone has 20 teeth in its mouth the glow in the dark antennas on the backbone of the dino is a nice touch as you can let him walk in the dark somewhat i do agree with the reviewer the box is insanely huge i dont think lego wanted to show a 11 scale dino they just wanted to promote the power function stuff as large as possible also the remote is smaller than shown in the picture as the hand holding it i think is smaller	positive
this is both my first set review and post about a star wars set even though i have been collecting them since 99 i got this one early this year so i thought i would post a review on it please bare with me i am not a great photographer so with that in mind here goes front of the box 75083 atdp boxfront by whitesidewjw on flickr back of the box 75083 atdp box back by whitesidewjw on flickr shot of the bags 75083 atdp bags by whitesidewjw on flickr the sticker sheet i normally dont apply them but for this i am going ahead and putting them on 75083 atdp sticker sheet by whitesidewjw on flickr minifigs i really like the two atdp pilots but the best agent kallus really does shine of course we get an extra stormtrooper 75083 atdp minifigs by whitesidewjw on flickr no new molds in this as far as i can tell however these printed 4x4 domes are really great i can see lots of uses for these in space mocs 75083 atdp new printed elements by whitesidewjw on flickr bag1 complete nothing earth shattering here an easy build 75083 atdp bag 1 complete by whitesidewjw on flickr bag 2 complete 75083 atdp bag 2 complete cockpit seats by whitesidewjw on flickr cockpit assembly 75083 atdp cockpit assembly by whitesidewjw on flickr bag 2 complete 75083 atdp bag3 complete by whitesidewjw on flickr foot assembly i like how they positioned the slopes 75083 atdp foot assembly by whitesidewjw on flickr complete atdp 75083 atdp complete by whitesidewjw on flickr complete atdpside view 75083 atdp side view complete by whitesidewjw on flickr complete atdp over view 75083 atdp complete overview by whitesidewjw on flickr complete atdp rear view 75083 atdp rear view by whitesidewjw on flickr extra pieces 75083 atdp extra pieces by whitesidewjw on flickr the verdict minifigs 55 we get a total of four figs i like the two atdp pilots and agent kallus is a well done minifig i can complain about another storm trooper either parts 35 other than the dome pieces i commented on before there is really not any new parts in this if you build space star wars or machinery this will still be a welcome assortment experience of build 45 this really was a fun build it came together fast but was challenging enough for its target age group playability 55 this thing is much more sturdy than it looks the legs take a little bit of effort due to the double locking hinges but hold together very wellthis is a very minor complaint value 45 typical 4999 for 500 pieces i must admit i paid a little more than msrp due to shipping but i cant complain about the value overall 2125 i really believe this is one of the best walkers that lego has designed the only changes i would make would be adding real control panels in the cockpit and it would be nice if lego made a real widow to fit in with these types of builds rather than a transparent tile over another plate all in all i would recommend this set and i hope the rest of the 2015 star wars sets are on par with this	positive
thanks for the early review i dont know much about the rebals show at all but i can say that the over all design of the walker really appeals to me and the minifigs look top notch i also like how the spring shooters are pretty much hidden in the frame nice job	positive
looks really nice one complaint is the back it is a pitty that lego didnt use any plates greebling there	negative
great review thanks for doing it im a big fan of this set the minifigures are good as is the parts selection i like the piece used in the cockpit to secure the minifigure in place i wouldve liked to see some panels in the cockpit though rather than translucent red pieces that said however they are useful pieces	positive
thanks for the review cannot wait for the 2015 sets	positive
thanks for the review i have two questions  what is the driver standing on when the hatch is open and he is looking out  could you show the face of kallus without helmet please my only complaint is that the colours of both kalluss and the driverss uniforms are wrong kalluss uniform is way too dark and should be more dark olive than black and the driverss uniforms are too bright and should be more greyish compared to what we saw in the series	neutral
whats behind the printed 4x4 dome is that 2x4 yellow plate im planning to replace that	neutral

awesome i am really looking forward to buy this but is it really 5000 us i was hoping more around 3000 also i was wondering how the hip section for the legs work does it have a stiff turning axis to it	positive
smitty500 on 25 december 2014  0721 am said awesome i am really looking forward to buy this but is it really 5000 us i was hoping more around 3000 i mean it fits the 10 cents per piece count and has 4 figures so for a licensed theme you cant beat that but i guess lego can never satisfy everyone	neutral
whitswj on 24 december 2014  0253 pm said here are the pics of kallus his head would be good for a steampunk character thanks indeed his face printing is really nice they captured his looks and spirit well	positive
great set really impressed odd that lego didnt include stickers for the controls  cant think of a reason they wouldnt have and why do only 3 of the 4 figures have leg printing i just cant understand lego at times	neutral
namioik on 25 december 2014  0853 am said i mean it fits the 10 cents per piece count and has 4 figures so for a licensed theme you cant beat that but i guess lego can never satisfy everyone this is true i just had that price in mind when i saw the first images of it it did not appear to be this big or complex but new sets are getting so much more advanced than what they used to be	neutral
thanks for the early review how tall is this next to the most recent recreation of the atat im picturing the two of them standing next to each other looking silly due to the scale differences	neutral
the legs are about 2 shorter than the atat its cockpit is a little larger than the atats head it doesnt look out of place as an escorttype walker or heavy walker especially as both are built in the same style although if scale differences really bother you the most recent atst is probably a better bet for you edited by hjmediastudios 29 december 2014  0432 pm	neutral
its a different helmet ezras is an imperial cadet helmet the same one he wears in breaking ranks	neutral
thanks for the review and pics this is a really nice looking walker one question  how snug are the atdp drivers sitting in their seats the cockpit looks good actually im not crazy about the atdp helmets on the show but i dig the minifigs good stuff awesome facial hair for kallus	neutral
hi i need some helpwhen i atach the pod to the place where the legs are placed the small piece that unites the pod to the legs is loos from the bottom so the top of the walker just moves around freely wich is different from every video review that i have seen where they can rotate the pod but its not loose the small piece that serves as the axis isnt staying locked on the bottom piece and i have reassembled it all and still its the same  help edit sorry i found out what went wrongdidnt push hard enough d edited by mrpinache 05 july 2015  1210 am	neutral
super outstanding review i am outside at this moment and this review is certainly great to read while you are on the move i am looking forward to get this upcoming new modular it is definitely fun to play and real awesome indeed thanks oky for this very fine review	positive
a great review of an obviously fantastic set a musthave for 2015 thanks	positive
brilliant review and thanks for plenty of detailed shots of the interior i may invest in this set but ill have to wait until 2015 star wars is sorted and budget for the arrival of pirates in april	positive
fantastic review could easily be the years best and its only january 1st youve got a duplicated picture in the bit where the candy is being moved from the outside and through the barber shop and i was expecting a final bw picture or two where the detective makes his report to the woman in red and gets his reward candy of course or she in turn reports back to her real boyfriend the candy smuggler edited by rollermonkey 01 january 2015  0408 pm	positive
firstly great review  i was really on the fence on this one this review has greatly changed my view on this modular a definite buy for me love the interiors and the whole concept the more i see it the more i see the little features which put this set apart or at least slightly different from the others of course great playability for the younger lot and i think a nice building to give any lego city more character and colour	positive
great review oky i really love your introduction text you put a lot of effort in this review with lots of nice touches well done for me the set gets 4 out of 5 its a great set but theres something preventing me of giving it 5 stars	positive
great review oky i managed to pick this set up a few days ago and i must say it might be my favorite modular yet for the feel alone the pool hall barbershop and the detectives office itself are all wonderfully designed	positive
can you please take some picturesexplain how the water tower is built i understand that there are some tank treads bot how exactly and it is there can be only one edited by yooha 01 january 2015  0714 pm	neutral
looking forward to picking up this set on saturday  nice review love the tiny details and the printed parts	positive
great review the intro was great but im still not convinced on this one the height seems too small for comparison with the rest of the modulars the play features are ok but i wish it would have been taller	negative
nice review thanks a lot managed to improve my opinion of the set a bit but im still getting two to build larger buirldings as soon as we get the next 2x vip points special	neutral

this modular building will be my next set thanks for the review	positive
thank you for the review it was very interesting and changed my opinion of the set im now considering a future purchase  just one question the mirror is on cardboard i was hoping for it to be a window piece with a mirror on one side i hope its not the same cardboard we had on some of the early harry potter sets or the element wont last long	neutral
thank you for the great review of this set im also curious for the backside of the mirror	neutral
snaplock on 01 january 2015  0740 pm said totally agree with you the height does seem rather small also 2x buildings on a 32x32 baseplate with a lots of spare studs behind the buildings are these buildings 12 studs in width it still looks great style wise however this might be a set i buy and look at it after i have built it  regret the amount of  i have spent on it 239 for us aussies  both are are 14 deep on the upper floors do is 3 studs deeper on the ground floor buit thats pretty much it cant believe how cramped the upper floors of the barber shop look weve come a long way from the wide and empty halls of cc and gg	neutral
amazing review very thorough with lots of details	positive
thanks for the review im a fan of the set but will be modding quite a bit have to get a small bar into the highlander and then turn the secondthird story above the barber shop into a proper apartment the detectives office is great and will stay as is	positive
awesome review and an awesome set what are the different shades of blue i know theres dark and medium blue but whats the other blue locutis	positive
legos affiliation with six wheelers go back a long way i think the first one was released in 1981 more than 25 years ago this year lego added another one to the family mars missions rhino 1 as its title sounds its been a while since ive bought and opened a large box so maybe this isnt a surprise to most of you but the box does not open at the front as with many larger sw boxes but at the side the two printed sealsor whatever people call them have gone as well being replaced by one larger print in the middle of side the box also isnt as thick as a large sw box like the sandcrawler the general size is however still quite large pict0001jpg 28191k 102 downloads the back side shows the mars mission theme sets eccept the rhino i guess it shows this set will be released as a tru exclusive or something only to show up in legoland shops and maybe lego shops its a shame really because this is by far the best set of the theme pict0002jpg 28542k 89 downloads when you open the front cover you see a larger picture picture of the rhino obviously it seems to be some sort of multifunctional truck i think the basic function is to drive around and explore for that it has a drilling device and six giant wheels pict0003jpg 2737k 82 downloads the set comes with two instruction books im afraid to say they did not resolve the grayblack colors issue colorwise the real thing does not look like the instruction book because of it pict0004jpg 30263k 75 downloads the rhino looks really big because of the six giant wheels i guess its more or less the same size as mtrons magnetiser with the big difference between the two being that the wheels have been turned around creating a unique wheel design for a lego model pict0285jpg 29059k 83 downloads pict0277jpg 28626k 80 downloads the wheels look very cool even though the first couple of wheels stand a bit closer to each other dont know why that is hm  and they could have used a bit more body but the design is pretty good i know armagheddon isnt far away  pict0292jpg 21675k 70 downloads the suspension of the wheels is a bit flimsy sure it allows the truck to move around in a more realistic way than the old sets but its not as flexible as some older sets like sws ctt nor do the wheels have much body the black bars you see on top of the wheels are more window dressing then functional pict0293jpg 24478k 88 downloads the over all shape of the rhino is kinda bulky it looks more like a beatle than a rhino if youre asking me it has three major sections but i wouldnt call it a modular building though the cockpit is the first section its spacious and detailed pict0290jpg 26277k 0 downloads pict0291jpg 29975k 87 downloads the cockpit hangs down from a weird angle its attached to a large vertical technic brick that is part of the rhinos main structure so its not a seperate spaceship which is a shame oh well you cant have it all i guess pict0301jpg 29113k 78 downloads ah yes stickers all over the place but theyre cool the mid section of the rhino dominates the basic shape of the model its as if those two large white parts form a strong and thick shield protecting whatever is inside from whatever is outsde pict0007jpg 21322k 67 downloads unfortunately there is nothing inside its extra space needed to house the spaceship thats really a shame a command center of some kind could have given the rhino a bit more panache pict0286jpg 25135k 87 downloads however whats really great is the way in which they fit together one side has an orange 1x2 plate that fits in between two white 1x3 plates of the other side creating yet another unique shape for a lego model but again its a shame they didnt do more with this section xo pict0283jpg 28775k 82 downloads the third and last section is a platform for a space ship pict0299jpg 2895k 77 downloads pict0287jpg 19978k 75 downloads the platform itself isnt really special no details no stickers its just a skeleton to carry the spaceship nothing more nothing less no your space ship doesnt fall off even if you rotate the platform into a launch position pushing the weight of the ship backwards in fact the position of the ship onto the platform is so solid its kinda difficult to imagine how this ship flies off  the ship on the other hand is pretty cool its all sorts of things at the same time it seems it transports two aliens but also a small car that reminds me of the small sets of spacepolice 2 blacktron 2 pict0295jpg 3074k 85 downloads pict0298jpg 26813k 75 downloads pict0294jpg 27684k 76 downloads the shuttle reminds me of a star trek shuttle and i think it needs some modding but i do think it looks pretty nice sure the cockpit is a bit too low a pilot needs to lay down instead of sitting down and the dropping mechnism if there is one at all isnt all that brilliant either the main structure is a bit too technical for me i prefer actual parts with studs not these lego technic bars and pins pict0006jpg 22443k 74 downloads the crew pict0276jpg 23943k 70 downloads ah yes theres also this green plastic residu think they are supposed to be the aliens and theres also this weird alien craft but i didnt bother to build that sad good wub great innovative design lots of potential i even like the colors sweet lots of playability its a big attractive model i dont see any weak spots in the design that could compromise stability or structural integrity not so good  too many technic parts some sections on the model like the gun and the drilling device are a bit to flimsy id say 758510 price 750 danish crowns about 105euro	positive
thanks very much i love it wub  it needs tweaking but isnt that half the fun incidentally when people were calling it rhino i thought it was just a reference to captain scarlet seeing the stickers in the middle made me realise my mistake buy buy buy	positive
thanks dude this is a great set can you please take more pictures thanks	positive
seems like they infuse system sets with more technic bars must be that technic isnt selling too well and they want to educate ppl how cool technic can be p its quite apparent when even the small bike needed technic frame	neutral
wow this year my wallet size has been bugging me sigh still its a goodlooking set and i will get it too many big sets	positive
this is a great review and so is the set y i thought i would buy it but when i saw the price i changed my mind xd i always liked flying things better though like the dropship although that is a bit pricey too i guess xd	neutral
this set is truely incredible a must have but this set is also incredibly overpriced n  com on its only a big vehicle  nothing really special to justify the near 100 price tag this set is clearly worth something like 65 at max look at the incredible dropship for 34 thats a good value for money y edited by mutex 15 july 2007  0457 pm	neutral
thanks for that very interesting review snefroe1 y that vehicle looks really nice with a lot of playability but too much technic brick construction for my liking it seems like theres pretty much space wasted inside of it some kind of small laboratory or a room for the crew and at least a mining toolshed wouldve been cool	neutral
awesome review if i pick up any mm sets it will definately be this one	positive
i echo the consensus of this thread  too much technic looks great too expensive looks great	neutral
kahgarak on jul 16 2007 0953 am said please build the alien craft im sure that we would all like a review of that  ok then ill do that later on but i will not touch that plastic residu xd	neutral
sinner on jul 15 2007 0102 pm said incidentally when people were calling it rhino i thought it was just a reference to captain scarlet yeah me too thats a great programme is it not and i mean both new and old anyway i like this ill probably get it when it finally becomes available in the uk i think theres a few things ill mod but overall its very nice although its interesting and slightly creepy how much the lights at the front look like eyes and as ive said many a time before i love the motorbike edited by brainbox 16 july 2007  0111 pm	positive

yes they can hold the crystals they cant move the hands    but they do have the clawlike hand of the droid arm edit could you post some general beauty pics of the rhino and the attached craft such as front side back etc all we have of the ship is one top pic edited by mr mandalorian 20 july 2007  0518 am	positive
8 such a wonderful machine great review too bad all my money is going towards the castle theme  my wallet is planning to kill me	positive
great review wonderfully detailed dont care for the ship at all its that technic under a hollow shell thing like the ctt if it wasnt for the figures i would have hated it and nothing about these figures excites me ill end up finding the least number of sets possible to provide at least one of each figure for the general population collection and skip the rest unless they do as i expect and flop here thus leading to huge discounts i like this set  at half off 	positive
the life on mars theme was so much better with the aliens dominating mars instead of the humans and the aliens were so much better with their own names etc good times anyway i think this is the best set in the series it looks so neat and reminds me of the pelican form halo xd edited by iamded 31 august 2007  0511 am	positive

lego 41062 elsas sparkling ice castle lego managed to get a frozen licensed set in the new wave of disney princess sets however im very surprised by the size its a 40 set and comes in a small friendsstyle box roughly 12x12 size  i almost didnt see it on the shelf when i was looking for it because its so small i mean i know its only 40 but its a friggin castle and why did lego only make this a smaller set if theyd made a 200 frozen castle they still would have sold every one they could produce they made big harry potter hogwarts sets and those sure sold and have you seen the toys in the frozen section of stores huge playsets for barbiesized dolls but i suppose im getting the cart before the horse here reviewing before ive even opened the box so name elsas sparkling ice castle set number 41062 pieces 292 price 3999 minifigs 3 theme disney princess year of release 2015 links bricklink peeron brickset the box the front of the box is standard lego fare other than the large anna and elsa in the bottom right corner oh and surprisingly nowhere on the box is the normal minifig lineup the only way to know what characters are included is to look at the set pictures the 11 this set uses one of the minidolls as the actual size sample thats probably not a bad choice since the minidolls are not nearly as well known as a minifig the back on the back the play features are shown in insets around a rear view of the castle like friends sets you also have an array of play accessories the seals is this standard on 2015 sets or is this specific to this set ive never seen 3 tape seals on a set even huge modulars or technic sets only have 2 so 3 on a set this small seems excessive perhaps lego expects people to try to steal the dolls if so why bother with extra tape a tiny pocketknife makes quick work of the tape so the third strip doesnt even slow you down the contents in the box are 2 instruction booklets bent a white plate a sticker sheet and 3 numbered bags of parts the stickers these are very hard to photograph since theyre shiny i mean polished chrome shiny those dark lines across the corners are not really there theyre reflections of my ceiling the manual backs the back of one booklet has a friends win girl the other has an ad for the lego disney princess website that site is so girly theres even sparkles following your mouse cursor around so i didnt stay too long or look too deeply the sample page the interior pages of the manuals are on lavender backgrounds its standard lego instructions with part callouts and insets when needed the build 1 the first thing you build is anna but im not showing that yet then you build this little picnic scene its tiny but effective and nice to have something not icy in the set since the movie has the in summer song for olaf im curious whats in that sandwich though  green and pink after the picnic is the olaf build but ill save him for later too the build 2 next is this small sleigh it has an amazing amount of style for something so small the curved front and decorative whips on the back make it look sleighlike instead of blocky but come on it already had pink accents are the pink flowers really necessary technically yes so the whips can mount to them but still its just overgirly for my taste the build 3 the sleigh needs a ramp to help it rocket along for a couple inches at least the ramp starts like this with a hidden lime green jumper plate that gets a cookie on it i couldnt remember anything in the movie like that so i asked my wife and she couldnt either a hidden cookie under a hill the build 4 after putting the tilting 2x8 onto the base and adding decorations this is the result a lime green bucket holding a pair of ice skates a flower in the snow really green and white round studs that i assume are supposed to be grass and snow the build 5 the sleigh looks huge sitting on top of the tiny hill but it actually works pretty well assuming youre on a smooth surface like a table you can give the sleigh a little nudge and itll shoot down the ramp and a few inches across the table the unevenness of the slopes vs the blue tiles holds the sleigh in line well and the bumps in the slopes dont seem to hamper anything the build 6 moving on to bag 2 man thats a lot of colors in this base already and im already starting to feel like theres transblue cheese thrown around randomly the build 7 continuing and rotating some steps and even more colors thrown in magenta in elsas ice palace i sure dont remember any of that the build 8 wait seriously an ice cream stand in the castle that is what the magenta is for i kinda actually like the looks of it but it doesnt fit the set the build 9 spinning back around now theres a light aqua spiral staircase added along with a roof this is where im really starting to wonder about legos thinking those light aqua stairs and the light aqua 1x4 tiles are exclusive to this set as far as i know its possible some other 2015 sets use them but nothing in bricklink yet seems expensive to produce to me when theres no huge reason to need them another blue for the tiles would have been fine and the spiral stairs really elsas castle is known for staircases but not spiral ones there should be a huge straight ice stairway out front or sweeping curved stairs inside but not a spiral the build 10 and now we finish the tree again why where is there a tree next to elsas castle and so weird with ice hanging from green branches that have both snow and flowers on them huh did lego watch a different movie the translight blue bits before looking at the upper level a brief pause to look at some other parts heres the 1x2x5 brick in translight blue and the 2x4x6 rock panel in glitter translight blue do those look like the same blue to you and again another unique part for this set why do those rock panels need to be glitter when lego made the same panel in trans light blue in 2013 and 2014 for superheroes friends and chima sets apparently disney really wanted glitter because there are a bunch of transglitter parts in the new princess sets theres transneon green cones for jasmine ariel jasmine and sleeping beauty all get glitter trans purple cones so theres a bunch of new glitter parts for 2015 the build 11 back to building  time to add the upper level we get a bedroom with a decent bed although stickered the build 12 the other side of the bedroom has some little accessories perfume and a crown i assume the build 13 time for walls and a roof i like the small white macaroni bricks for a wall but whats with the lavender fence piece in the center ill grant that it looks nice a common white fence would have been a little boring but its another unique piece to this set the build 14 the very top of the castle is built separately not a whole lot to say here other than why is there a torch in an ice castle the finished castle once the roof is put on the castle is done and that big purple star on top says everything to me about the styling it just doesnt look like modern lego to me it looks like this should be an old belville fairy tale set from around 1999 if i saw a photo of just the castle with no figs or picnic blanket id assume thats what it was the oops not actually done yet accessories at the end theres a few bits left to add there are these dark purple skis yup another unique part in the lower level let me tell you theyre a pain to get into that location at least with my big man hands more accessories the top level gets a stickered book the sticker has a nice castle image on it that is while not quite exactly the castle from disney world very disneylooking i actually had to google and see if thats the castle they use in their logo nope but its the same style the leftovers there are a lot of extra parts in this thats almost 10 of the part count in the set right there they are pretty useful overall though its great to have an extra carrot and brown branch for olaf since you know those will get lost as hes played with the figs finally the reason for the set lets face it the castle set is just an excuse to make these figures and theyre great i mean just fantastic the print on them is just such a good match to the real characters compare to the cartoon version from the front of the box elsas hair is a little darker than the cartoon but overall these are just dead on if i had to pick out a flaw its the spell elsa is holding its too bad she can only shoot it forward with her arm down like that itd be nice to have the end of the splash part bent 90 degrees so she can have her arm forward and the spell shooting forward too oh one other thing the minidoll heads dont press down tight to the body like minifig heads do theres still exposed neck it looks nice but it means elsas cape can swing around the fig backs elsas cape is glittery on the back and you can see the removable bow in her hair the full set one final issue when you put anna on the sleigh her cape doesnt have enough flexibility since its a wraparound kind and so it folds out funny thats why on the back of the box it shows her standing on the back of the sleigh with elsa in the seat edit how on earth did i forget to comment on those orange flowers to each side of the castle im pretty sure elsa did not have any flowers blooming outside her castle the conclusion hm i really wanted to like this set but i just cant quite bring myself to it feels like lego pulled a random castle design from the files then redid it into white and trans blue to look icy and allow a frozen tie in set the figs are great but the castle isnt i guess the real castle in the movie would be a boring set and this one has play features but it just is too different for my taste the ratings value 710  40 for less than 300 parts is high especially when so many of the parts are tiny but on the other hand theres a lot of rock panels and 1x2x5 trans blue panels but the figs help save it design 410  not one of legos best not as bad as the lows in the 90s but not a great set minifigs 1010  possibly even a 1210 they are the reason to buy the set  playability 810  there are a bunch of play features but they actually detract from the design so i had to knock off a couple points parts 710  a bunch of impractical unique parts how often do you need dark purple skis or a lavender fence piece but also a bunch of nice parts if you wanted to make your own icy scene overall 710  a great bunch of figs but id recommend not bothering with the manuals just use the parts to build your own castle thats better	neutral
two of my daughters are building this as we speak i agree the design is a lot smaller than i would have liked but theyre loving it no question the figures are the real draw here and at 6 and almost five years old theyre doimg a good job building so far at least for the 46 range in my house this set is a home run thanks for the great review mostlytechnic	positive
very nice review mostlytechinc once i saw this set i was interested in it for the colours and piecesthanks for this review to shed more light onto it	positive
isnt getting parts in new colors a good thing it is a shame there is only this one set i think tlg could make a whole subtheme out of frozen i do agree that they overuse lavender and magenta i dont see why every girl set has to have these sort of colors instead of what would be accurate to the source material 	negative

when i first saw the pictures i didnt realize that this set had so much color barf going on in it also there is a bunch of stuff that does not fit in with the movie and it is pricey the minifigures are nice but no kristoff or sven i thought about getting this but this review is pushing me towards no	negative
yep my family all thinks they should have made a bigger set added figs and just been printing money this feels massively rushed into production which is weird the other princess sets that just came out look worlds better	negative
i wish elsa had more of a white hairpiece rather than blonde but it could be worse not a bad set overall although olaf doesnt look right without the twigs on his head anna is a really nice and accurate fig	positive
the review is very well done thanks i dont know the movie my key question is whether the bricks in the set will allow to build my own snowice creations now with transglitter being part of the design approach i am not so sure can those who have already bought it tell me can transglitter be used as transparent with snow particles or is it just terrible i cannot really tell from the review pic above	neutral
im literally of the exact opposite opinion to op here i love the structure and the parts this is a fantastic little parts pack that ill be snagging more of when i find it againbut ive no use for the figures not a big disney princess fan its all about the parts this set is freaking amazing d	positive
well the good news for you is youre in luck whenever you find sets since the figs sell for a good bit of money  right now the bricklink value of the 3 figs is about 30	positive
mostlytechnic on 10 january 2015  0202 am said i think the transglitter blue panels can be icy or snowy just fine im sure thats why they used them for this set now if youre looking for realism like the photos in your sig seem to be it might be tougher but ive been thinking about using those big glittery panels to make a waterfalltype scene the guys over in the historic forum will kill me if my mocs start to glitter ill take a closer look when i see the set in a shop and as i understand i can sell the minifigs for the price of the set	neutral

there is a very simple reason for the flowers and greenleaved trees you should remember from the movie it was actually summer when elsa set of the eternal winter… the orange flowers do bother me from a design point of view i would have liked it better if they were a pinkpurplebluewhite color same goes for the leafy bits they could have used the pinkpurple ones they are gonna use in the elves sets it would have been fantastic if they had given us white leafy bits like snow covered branches im sure loads of us could use those in our mocs edited by bennemans 13 january 2015  0614 pm	neutral

hello everyone i am back to share with all of you another of my legends of chima polybags review it will be pretty comprehensive since the finished built will be quick and will be focusing more of what kind of fun that you can derive from there this polybag was bought in september 2013 when i visited legoland malaysia and i did not hesitate to put this in my shopping basket name 30253 leonidas jungle dragster theme lego system  legends of chima year 2013 pieces 30 minifigs 1 minifigure price usd na gbp na euro na sgd na resources brickset bricklink an original polybag image of the 30253 leonidas jungle dragster back view of the original polybag image of the 30253 leonidas jungle dragster the road scout of the lions tribe this polybag design is definitely plan to be the quickest and fastest dragster to recce enemy front by making a swift scout for the lions tribe i believe by the sound of the name jungle dragster it might just be suitable to use in jungle terrain well i dont quite agree that this is a dragster even though it has the kind of open view concept of rolling in fast but it does not have the length of a typical dragster similar to this town polybag design for example still it is nice to have smaller variants of their vehicular supremacy instruction manual front instruction manual back the lego building content with just 30 lego elements you can be pretty quick to be able to display these laid out content after the built is completed these are the remaining spare parts i am fond of the wheels which are some useful parts other than that there are nothing spectacular about it my name is leonidas and i belonged to the lions tribe do not be mistaken of his name leonidas to be the king of sparta who led the brave men of 300 spartans warriors to fight to the death against the persians instead this character is based on the bio resided in legocom you will realise that he is aligned with the lions tribe and is a proud lion footsoldier he may have that goofy idiotic look but he can be very serious in his commitment to discharging his duties you are able to observe his nice back view printing which reveal his black and blue sash leonidas has a dual facial feature to reveal his much serious appearance leonidas is one of the common characters available in the legends of chima universe it can be found in a total of five sets it is a great pity that there is no weapon being made for him in this polybag design which will certainly make a fine addition the completed built of the jungle dragster this is the main design of the jungle dragster which is very simple looking there is no distinct fighting capability from the vehicular design and it look just like a regular patrol vehicle one thing i like about this is the close distinct colour schema of the lions tribe other than that there is nothing special about it moving off with my jungle dragster to conclude this polybag is really meant for lego fans or collectors who appreciate legends of chima or wanting to sample the legends of chima theme it is a very simple built but yet could form a decent force size for recce purposes before sending in the big arsenals to whack their enemies either way i will only suggest you to buy it if you really love this theme at an inexpensive price otherwise it is perfectly alright to give this a miss summary review playability 410 you need to have more lions tribe vehicles in order to bring the best and fun out of it since this is more of a supporting vehicle design 410 simplistic built of the dragster and main focus is just acquiring the minifigure price 410 bought at about usd7 which is not an awesome price so get it if you can get it more than half of this price overall 410 if only you are a huge mega fan of the legends of chima then you need to get this i gave it a 2 based on my review score card what about yours i hope every one of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and criticisms are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my flickr	negative

sinner on jul 18 2007 0824 am said i thought you would like it i am pleased to say that i didnt know that the jig is up was also a common line most of what i remember about the old batman tv show actually comes from the movie as i own that mum bought it for me i tend to put in on if i have friends over and i am drunk enough i like the darker side of batman only and thus anything that is against the idea that batman is as big a loon as the guys that he hauls in i dont like joel schumakers movies fall well within that category wait what are you saying you prefer the joel schumacher films if you like the darker side of batman i recommend the tim burton films joel schumacher is as campy as the jig is up imo he added freakin nipples to the batsuit for gods sake p youd have to be nice and drunk to enjoy his films  i really like batman batman returns and batman begins sinner on jul 18 2007 0824 am said santa brings presents here in the middle of summer in full winter rig he is a hero at least he can come down chimneys here without being burnt p  no no no no i saw a movie once im pretty sure its a wallabee xwingyoda on jul 18 2007 1127 am said tks mate for this brilliant review d i loved your batfabuland story  always fantastic to read like always sweet i really love this set and i shall buy 2 copies one to build as is and another one for my town loool regular biplane for the tarmac and my swat copter  btw i would have a request could you post pics of the parts inventory please  many tks in advance  yoda what nice things to say  thanks mate you always make me feel brilliant  here is the parts inventory click to enlarge the scarecrow plane would make an excellent crop duster and the batcopter will make an excellent swat copter sweet sweet thanks everybody else for the nice compliments as well im deeply concerned about price differences in other countries it seems pretty ridiculous and counterproductive for tlc has anyone posted about this in the embassy forum	positive
sinner on jul 19 2007 0415 am said sorry due to my convoluted sentance structure you misinterpretted me i meant that joel shumakers movies fall well within the category of being against the idea that batman is as big a loon as the guys that he hauls in just to be sure i hate x the joel schumaker batman movies thank you for clarifying we can still be friends now people are entitled to their opinions but the opinion that the joel schumacher batman films are any good is just wrong and stupid p sinner on jul 19 2007 0415 am said ill get back to you at christmas it is possible i made a mistake yes i also wrote to lego about it and i posted their reply thanks for the link i was too lazy to search	neutral
what about the cartoon batman the animated series will always be the definitive batman to me the two tim burton movies were okay they havent aged well though and i really dig what christopher nolan is doing with the new movies christian bale did a fine job in batman begins  but when i watch the movie i hear kevin conroys voice in my head the cartoon rocked and as much as i enjoyed the justice league unlimited cartoon my biggest complaint was always more batman please	neutral

out of nowhere this set appeared at my local tru hadnt been expecting this one for a while so a nice surprise sweet firstly the box nice pic on the front good selection of minifigs the officer and pilot look cool with their dark blue trousers a new r2 unit as well dont remeber this in the film but great to have one in a new colour wub back of the box shows some of the ships nifty features first thing you notice when you open the box is the awesome selection of bricks this makes a for a great parts pack loads of unusual red and dark red pieces its so refreshing to see a star wars set that isnt predominantly grey there are also two instruction booklets as soon as you open the first booklet you hit an error why would i want two obiwans  its also at this point that you come across a big disappointment on the box you get a flesh quigon what is actually in the box is an epiii obiwan come on lego  why change it  all the figures look impressive in the flesh despite the big mistake once i started the build it progressed rapidly red pieces seem to be a lot easier to find lots of clever techniques quite a few technic elements get used at the start it reminded me of building a technic set from the 80s at times here is the main body half way through the build the landing mechanism is a nice touch its not fully retractable but still folds away nicely you find the ship keeps tipping over as you build it despite the feet as its only at the end thay it all becomes evenly balanced at both ends here the feet are extended you can also see the yellow knob that rotates the radar on top of the ship landing gear up viewed from the front here are the radar a great collection of dishes they spin easily with little friction here is the ship at the half way point the front works well with the top flipping up to squeeze in the pilot more to come 	positive

kernow on jul 22 2007 1048 pm said a new r2 unit as well dont remeber this in the film but great to have one in a new colour wub its also at this point that you come across a big disappointment on the box you get a flesh quigon what is actually in the box is an epiii obiwan more to come  nice review and i cant wait to see part ii  the quigon incident is just plain stupid  nice to have a new droid y part ii wait on copmike	neutral
whats up kernow nice review thanks for sharing welcome to eurobricks i hope you have fun here d xd that quigonn thing is weird come on lego someone is just asleep at the wheel over there with quality control missing pieces injections molds slipping quality ice cube traysimo thats a huge thing to miss the minifig on the box doesnt come in the setfalse claims anyway the ship looks beautiful and i wanted this set when i first saw it and your review confirms that it is very cool thanks again xd xd	negative

ok here is the set alot of us star wars fans have been waiting for the 7666 hoth rebel base wub first the box now the great minifigs that stunning k3po fig now the snowspeeder aaaaggghhhhh these parts are all stickers now for the turret the 2 cones on the side press in to fire out 2 blue lights saber blades d now for the small crane thingy yes the part under the engine on the snowspeeder is another sticker 8 echo base well the front door anyway d  the main control room d again these are stickers on a tinted clear panel and on the slope  i have no idea what this is meant to be d finally 2 shots of the full set wub well over all i really like this set and think it is great value for money the minifigs alone would set you back more than the cost of this set the build time was a good 2 hours or so and was good fun the snowspeeder is not as good as the second snowspeeder and no where near as good as the first in my opinion but i did love that first one the k3po fig is perfect and it is good to be getting more droids that arent r2d2 and c3po it is a shame about the stickers but that is the price of keeping the cost down i suppose the only printed part in the whole set is the snowspeederxwing windscreen i will definately be getting atleast another 3 of this great set 910	positive
i love it depending on the australian price if it comes down here that is incidently i have no idea what that other yellow thing is either thanks for the review	positive

great review i see now why the b model is so popular i wonder though on the car if instead of the panels for the rear spolier or wing if they could have used studded panels and maybe layer them to give the appearance of ie a three element rear wing i wont mention the front lights if i had the money i would buy it for the b model h	positive
great review with fantastic pictures as for the model im glad that they chose to make it less pretty  real le mans prototypes are rarely a sight to behold it is function and aerodynamics over form i would however have preferred more realism for the sake of learning  the front shouldnt open like that  instead it should be easy to remove the whole front cover leaving the suspension easy to work on  the aero seems to be realistic except for the rear end where theres no indication of a venturi channel this should have been easy to include  there is no fuel tank nor fixed fuel connector right behind the cabin  there are no air jacks seriously this is one of the most unique features of a race car like this and lego forgot about them instead they automated two functions which are manual on a real race car  the top cars at le mans are hybrids with ingenious systems i would have loved to see the front wheels connected to some kind of spinning apparatus indicating a kinetic energy recovery system if i get this set im going to make some modifications	positive
this is a mega review youve taken the right pictures and the video demonstrations of the mechanisms really help get the good points of the set across whats more amazing is that the review still feels very concise and to the point youve actually convinced me to put this set on my list and not just as a decent parts pack lasse d on 12 march 2015  0847 pm said  the front shouldnt open like that  instead it should be easy to remove the whole front cover leaving the suspension easy to work on  the aero seems to be realistic except for the rear end where theres no indication of a venturi channel this should have been easy to include  there is no fuel tank nor fixed fuel connector right behind the cabin  there are no air jacks seriously this is one of the most unique features of a race car like this and lego forgot about them instead they automated two functions which are manual on a real race car  the top cars at le mans are hybrids with ingenious systems i would have loved to see the front wheels connected to some kind of spinning apparatus indicating a kinetic energy recovery system im not sure air jacks are the feature that will have people fawning over this set and pneumatics are being covered rather well later in the year  but i agree with everything else most notably removable front and rear bodywork the removable engine cover on 8674 would be a good starting point here and the inclusion of some nod towards a hybrid system its also worth remembering the preliminary design did have the big honking fin bhf that is mandatory on all current prototypes so maybe when that was removed any trace of a tunnel or diffuser went with it on the subject of steering wheels all modern prototypes actually have left or right hand drive the regulations demand that both lmp1 and lmp2 cars are nominally capable of seating two people of course in practise the extra seat is taken up by the hybrid system in lmp1 and electronicsextra cockpit access in lmp2 however this doesnt change the fact that it would be easy to link the steering wheel to the hogfront axle edited by jay psi 12 march 2015  0955 pm	positive

wonderful review but i am still not sold on the set if we get more sets with the bright green i might be tempted to get it but until then it is too few parts in bright green too few different types not the number of pieces to be able to use that colour effectively in making mocs	neutral
true but i must say i like the new colour very fresh looking compared to the rather dullish regular green cant wait to build mocs with it	positive
i have been waiting for this set since the pictures for the toy fairs eirlier in the year and i am glad to say i am not disapointed first the price it is not cheap at 9999 but i guess that is typical for a set with this amount of electronics in itthere is no parts count and i have not had time to add up the 2 pages of contents to get a figure first the box standard flip top with large internal picture and rip to open lid inside there are no numbered bags in this set which i prefer i like to open all the bags and put all the parts in the box before building next is a picture on the electronics 2 xlmotors as lego describe them and 2 standard motors 2 ir receivers and 1 ir transmitter i know these have been discussed before but i really like the thought that has gone into the transmittersreceivers each receiver has 2 outputs to corespond with the 2 controls on transmitter they also have a choice of 4 channels so one transmitter can control up to 8 independant motors by changing the channel switch the transmitter also has a neat motor direction switch so you can configure the transmitter operation the set comes with three manuals 1 is the main drive mechanism 2 is the cab and engine and 3 is the attachments front and back there is also the now standard parts list in the back of the third manual there is no alternative model instructions despite the pictures of one on the box however there is a reference to the technic website on the back of the box but at the moment the page only has an advert saying the set is to be released on 1st september so i guess i will have to wait untill then to see if the instructions will be online the build is fairly straight forward the main chassis is studless the next picture shows the motors mounted into the chassis and the drive for the shovel and claw it also shows the v6 technic engine this next picture shows the ir receivers mounted on the back the battery box slots into the back and can be easily slid out with the removal of two pins which is useful because i can imagine i will need to change the batteries on a regular basis the next 2 picture are of the completed model overall i was very happy with the finished dozer the functions work really well and as i have the monster dino i have used a second transmitter so i dont have to touch the channel switch i have included some video on my brickshelf page unfortunately this set does suffer from some quality issues for example moulding marks on the plates colour diferences some of the pins not finished properly some pins were very stiff and quite hard to push into the holes but the worst issue was an axle that would not turn freely in a hole which just adds extra friction into the system i am glad to see some studded technic in this set i much prefer sets that use both varieties of technic beam there are only 2 fairings which is a great improvment over recent sets if tlc had tried to make the bulldozer shovel with fairings this would have been a complete disaster marks for the set 810 for price with the number of motors i expected it to be greater 910 for fun my kids love this type of set that does something when finished 610 for quality tlc really need to work on this one 810 overall i would definately get a second one if i see it in the sales feel free to post questions but i will be on holiday next week more pics and videos available here	positive

alright so i usually do quick photo reviews when i get new sets thats what ill do here but theres quite a few photos so i thought i might as well make its own review thread so i got the kwikemart by paying just2much on an early ebay copy i think its worth it as this week im gonna be super busy so i was able to build it saturday and stuff heres my video review i think its one of my best well lets get onto this photo review the set is 200 usd with a little over 2100 pieces the official release is april 15th for vip members may 1st for everyone else at lego stores and if you want full size pictures check out my flickr by clicking here the minifigures included are great you get three exclusive minifigures one being a completely exclusive character the first time lego has ever put an exclusive mould in a direct to consumer set and you get three of the series most popular characters in their normal attire for those who missed out on the first simpsons minifigures series the kwikemarts exterior is loaded with lots of sticker details the only printed detail youll see in the exterior is the dial pad in the phone booth which has appeared in some other licensed themes since last year   right here is there the store can be opened a simple technic pin and receiver keeps it in place and allows for opening and closing the roof of the store includes the garden shown in the paul mccartney episode the roof can be slided outin once you open it with the hinge part heres a look at the store with the roof removed the floors are a nice sand blue color coming with 8x16 thin plates and for the interior from the view of the store opened with the hinges at the back that i mentioned earlier the left front corner which includes some arcade machines of bonestorm and great white hunter an amazingly done buzz cola soda machine juice machine the checkout counter ect the right front corner with food aisles freezers and a frozen jasper sticker the back left corner which includes some nice coffee kettle builds the donut tray hotdogs ect the right back corner which has a door leading to a very small hallway that only has a mouse and cheese in it the hallway leads to the employees only door in the back and its very hard to get in the door way not that theres anything to do inside there also included is clancys copcar which fits three figures heres a look at the piece list in the instructions click on each to be lead to an enlarged version of the pic also included are some awesome printed pieces and two unprinted coffee cups honestly i think this set is perfect the price is fantastic and has a great ppp ratio they really went above and beyond by including snake in this set i honestly think its better than the simpsons house in terms of accuracy and the value here so many cool pieces printed and in exclusive colors so thats my quick picture review hope you guys enjoyed and id love to hear your thoughts	positive
thanks for the review your video was very well done seeing those sticker sheets is daunting	positive
thanks for the review i cant help but think the minifigures are the weak part of the set snake and apu are great but the rest i dont know they kinda redundant now they could at least give us new torso printing like homer wearing his jacket or bart wearing his blue tshirt or marge wearing her coat or as i said in the discussion thread id have included jasper in cmf series 2 and a frozen version here overall the set looks kinda smaller than what i thought snakes bag needed a  symbol printed because it looks like he is stealing gargabe  pretty good review overall	positive
hello everyone excellent review english is not my native language but i want to express my opinion simpsons house was the first of its kind and i can say without exaggeration that this is the most impressive set that im going my collection httpbricksetcomsetsownedbyceleb  i look at the video from the kwikemart and is difficult to say how good it is compared with the house the main disadvantages that i said to myself is this build the walls of the large panels next is access to the roof gray parts in front of the back door i think they represent the stairs is not on the level with doors on the roof and when you open them you can see the white block is openly trash my points of view boxes on the left of go to the store and powersauce box i want see make real and not just a cube fe such as in the unreleased star wars set about minifigures i fully agree with robert8 two more of the same homer marge and bart personally i put my set as a scene and all the replays minifigure are inside the house that was not identical characters next and also absolutely terrible barts accessory this set is made parking for bikes and it looks very cool but damn it is hoped to see the bart or lisas bike instead of useless balloons with paint the walls are made with convex inside panels why so can anyone know have not seen any pictures with such walls in tv show why did not they turn i personally really like how realized roof but my brother says that it is terrible  garden could do more in the series there were almost jungle i do not know how to be considered here maybe anyone can express any opinion or idea i look at the simpsons house and then look at the photo of this emart i can not understand in the house we have a garage two floors cool floor a lot of furniture all the rooms and walls collected from cubes many additional accessories and where is all this detail here it looks much smaller maybe even poorer if they still will release next year comic book store it will be even less of course it is difficult to estimate without seeing it live we have it will be sold only in may at first sight it does not look so impressive as the house can certainly the case in the limit on the amount of detail but why it was impossible to add  50 to the cost and make jasper the more detailed the roof the walls of the smaller elements that it was not convex sad thanks all for attention edited by celeb 13 april 2015  0510 am	positive

great review thanks for paying a little extra to get it now and review it for us you must be a younginthose phone booths thingys are called pay phones  jj theyre tough to find nowadays	positive
incredible set thanks for the pics so many details and unique prints and colors im not that into the simpsons but definitely a top tier set	positive
thank you all for the great feedback arslock on 13 april 2015  0219 pm said can you post a pic of it next to the simpsons house just curious about size comparisons soon but my area with the simpsons house is very messy so i will have to make room for it first gooker1 on 13 april 2015  0410 pm said great review thanks for paying a little extra to get it now and review it for us you must be a younginthose phone booths thingys are called pay phones  jj theyre tough to find nowadays lol	positive
looks great how does it compare to the house	positive
mestari on 14 april 2015  0115 pm said i have sooo mixed feeling about that i loved the simpsons house save for the terrible wall in the homer and marges room but this so far is inferior in almost every aspect the walls made of panels is a bummer i expect a d2c set to be better that this 60 stickers the same thing same price for less bricks and smaller build then the house strange coloured bricks on the outside wall some ugly mix of yellow  tan agreed glad my gf likes to do stickers 60 yikes but looking at it now i think the tanyellow is supposed to represent where the paint is fading on the back of the store i guess	positive
heres a size comp to the house click for a bigger image	positive
thats actually not bad sizing imo sure it looks like you get a lot more with the house but the kwikemart has a lot more of those little references that make it simpsons i agree with some of the complaining a real jasper behind a transblue panel would have been cool you could always bulk up the roof with more foliage i think it has a great foundation as a set but could do with a few mods to make it better thanks for the pictures i greatly appreciate being able to see reviews like this before dropping 200 on a lego set	negative
one thing that may justify the price it has 527 different parts if i counted correctly i alway heard the more different parts the more difficult the set is to produce the simpsons house already had an astonishig amount of different pieces but this one is even more extreme	negative
its the level of detail that floors me a licensed set with the mindset of those great creator sets i think it displays much better than the simpsons house which from the outside is a bit drab	negative
nice review but i have one question is the transparent dome of the squishee drink removable	negative
great review	positive
did anyone else have a problem with the piano against the wall of the simpsons house it just kept coming off way too easily and i was getting really frustrated with it sticking out and not fully going on so i had to put the two tiles that hold them one place over away from the wall for it to sit properly without falling out i think i might put snowball ii behind it since cats love to hide underneath or behind things lol but just curious to know if anyone else was encountering this problem with the previous set	positive
great review of a classic set y	positive
imperialshadows on aug 13 2007 0729 pm said nice review of a surprisingly interesting set y thanks imperialshadows on aug 13 2007 0729 pm said that baseplate was in a few other sets but never with that pattern would have made a great base for some of the classic 80s houses lego used to treat us to in tan was part of the adventurers egypt sets as recently as 2001 it was a base for ogel versatile plate that hopefully hasnt disappeared completely indeed i wouldnt mind one of all many of the raised plates are too raised i think the new one in the police station and the hospital is but i think this one is perfect imperialshadows on aug 13 2007 0729 pm said just so you know that monkey is drinking too much and likely to fall in the pool   i believe he is hoping to take the barman with him xd he is one of hinckleys characters on holiday	positive
tks sinner for that cool review  this set is not one of my favs never was really a big fan of those raised baseplates but had fantastic parts and mfs  it has great playability with really cool 80s miami feel wub that pink was actually pretty cool and went well with that lime green i think its lime but im not 100 positive once again this pisses me off so much that i was in my dark ages when this theme was out  i loved it especially all the beachwater themes wub i really wish tlc decided to bring that water paradisia back  who knows  after all they need to make some girlie sets  girls are a part of their market totally neglected  how many women we have on the boards  really a tiny few unfortunatly  so tlc please bring paradisia back in may 08 p  please  yoda	positive

awesome set i really like the robots and that tiny tank could be quite useful all the fancy machinery in there really make it more like a lab than a restaurant d the thing i found most funny was the positioning of the middle finger on the hand d d definitely gave me quite a laugh xd	positive

wub wub wub wub wub holodoc i seriously have some love for your review youre in it and using a fabuland wrench such a clever review with a great sense of humor i really liked this train set and it adds so much to a train layout especially when you buy multiples tlc is throwing away a potential gold mine by discontinuing this line  it is also nice to see those beautiful consistent slopes in that picture it really is sad that tlc is letting quality slip they dont seem to be responding to the issue they way they did the bleyfrown fiasco perhaps we afol need to make more of a stink to the embassy  again great job holodoc and thanks for sharing sweet y what an excellent and fun review	positive

yes my spongebob fans its time for another review  lets look at our bikini bottom map and head strait to meet miss puff at her boating school she is waiting for us to give us a guided tour of her establishment  another bit of sb history this set comes from the following episode boating school spongebob fails his boating test for the 38th time what a freaking retard lool hes so determined to get his license that patrick decides to help him he implants a walkietalkie inside sbs head in order to cheat and tell him what to do you will say that i am biais but i really enjoy building this set and i really like the sb theme  lets hope 2008 brings more of that cool spongieness  but i digress here are general pics of the instruction booklet and the dss g there are loads of crappy stickers in that one also  as you can see the set is divided in 3 polybags shamelessly but nonetheless wilfully hehe i will disregard the third one which is that playability crap course  i would have reviewed it but since it involves stickers i didnt want to ruin the parts and without stickers it would look dull plain and ugly it does look crappy with so imagine without so that review will not be 100 complete and i do apologise in advance but how many of you would have build that and keep it hehe off p 1 mfs and extras i will start with the really cool miss puff wub the fig mind you  she looks a bit stressed  no wonder that sponge menace will bring her to the hospital once again hehe as you can see that mf comprises 3 parts the small blue 1x1 round and the 2 major parts yeay another great stupid looking sb i love those idiotic faces  3 different sb figs and 3 idiotic faces hehe you never can get enough of them  here is just a regular patrick too bad patrick doesnt have different expressions  the pull back boat car nothing really to report except the fact that i left it sticker free  the only thing i built from the third polybag is that pretty cool ancker holding tower thingie  looks great in a lighthouse set hehe yes the roud tile bouey is printed  its the same as in sbs bed in the bikini bottom set  ok its time for those two great buildings the lighthouse and the school  pontoon  before reviewing them individually here is a general pic 2 the lighthouse one of the main reason to own that great set  sure it suffers from accute stickeretite sad but d  t worst is that door but nonetheless a great and simple building  great whitered colour scheme and a really fantastic 2 turning lights  i really like the yellow top of the lighthouse it adds to the comic atmosphere of that theme instead of having a more plain redwhite only the rear has nothing really fancy except tools to fix it in case of problems hehe the only thing i modified since i didnt build the third polybag is that i got rid of the trechnic parts on the right of the lighthoue to replace them with regular logs all hail the tower king  d 3 the school and pontoon i really like that little building and its great to see that once again tlc uses the amazing dark blue color  its really a simple design but looks fantastic and can be used for many things in a town hehe i also really like the combination with those dark bluish grey slopes  the rear reveals the desk stickers on the wall doh  and two clams serving as chairs really like on the show its really great to see that tlc stays really as close to the show as possible the pontoon again is simple yet really cool and effective and its really nice to have 2 lifesaving boueys the only thing i modified since i didnt build the third polybag is that i got rid of the trechnic parts in front of the pontoon to replace them with regular logs on the overall i think its really a great set  apart from the crap stickers i think tlc should have ditched or simplified the third playability polybag to lower the cost  oh well parts are always usefull except those one part shitty palm trees  so until my next review i bid you farewell my spongebob fans  and i really hope to see next year hehe will sb get his drivers license one day  for the sake of bikini bottom lets hope not  no license ever on  yoda	positive
youve done it again yoda  great reveiw i really like this set but in my opinon 50 is steep considering i wont actually play with it i mean half of it is a track for peat sake ill eventually get it for the mrs puff figure though y	positive
yoda comes through again i love this set but it just costs too much for australians so i will be giving it a miss  it is a shame as it has clams in it 8	positive
i like this one better than the other one for parts and such plus im generally a sucker for any different minifig but yeah that price is steep great review though	positive
another great review thanks yoda man those smooth slopes really look like crap when on a roof  that was the whole reason they had texture in the first place  ill never liked those they feel so cheap the new sb head is great and can mrs puffs legs move i just ask since her feet are separate and in figs where the legs cant move theyre usually one piece at the bottom to keep them from breaking off the set looks great and seems to have a lot of playability	positive
yoda i dont thank you for this review and after the chump bucket review too because im so exited to have them that since i ordered them from sh i come back home aftre the work the faster i can with the hope to see a big box on my bed and this even if i know that it tooks more than 67 days to have my order this mrs puff figs is really really nice wub and this 3rd sb head too	neutral
man that spongebob head cracks me up hilaritythis is a cool set although i much prefer the chum bucket set i dont see whats wrong with the course then again i can see why afols wouldnt like it its just playability really i like the breakable wall though the building is cool a few modifications ie making it more realistic real chairs for a start and it would make a cool little wharf for your lego town and to sw4j mrs puffs legs are connected at the feet if you look closely so thanks for the great review yoda	positive
maybe mrs puff has a nice toy inside xd i like this review the lighthouse part and the school are nice enough for other towns and the figs are nice even mrs puffs 2 pieces you cant use for other things  pity that its 50 dollars 60 euro for half price i would think about it	positive
holodoc on aug 16 2007 0926 am said there are far more interesting parts if you dont like sb what you cant dislike sb no one cant contrary to star trek d  vader on aug 16 2007 1148 am said am i the only one who thinks mrs puff kinda looks like a kinder egg toy theirs nothing wrong with that mind you yes i have a kinder problem xd  just seems strange to me maybe yes but in the show too so really no matter	neutral

great review as always y lego is timeless so there is no such thing as an old set i never build brick monsterscreatures but this set had such a nice assortment of parts that i had to pick a couple up as they werent clearancing out on shop  home i absolutely love dark orange and tan so it was an automatic win i love the use of familiar characters in the review i can almost hear hinckley screaming my megabloks p you sort of look like youre planning some vulture stew though might have to start a new challenge to determine a winner there sinner and his big pot o doom vs giant vulture only thing is does everything horrify the mrs she seems perpetually shocked andor dismayed at the goings on here now that i think about it i can see why im occasionally shocked andor dismayed 8 brick built beasties on y	positive

yesterday i went to toys r us and bought the dilophosaur ambush beside that the shop had a display of the jw polybags for €349 i picked up two of them now here is my little review of this pretty nice set first some data line jurassic world year 2015 pieces 29 price €349 packaging polybag ok lets start with the polybag itself it is a standard size and had plenty of room for all the parts the front depicts the whole set with a little hexagon on the right with a seperate picture of the dinosaur and its name in this case the celophysis is called gallimimus weird choice next is the instruction sheet it is a doublesided paper with every building step in clear sight the part selection is nice there are only a few but all of them are pretty usefull for all kind of builds there are two parts which stoodout both are printed tiles the first one is the yellowblack warning tile in 1x4 you cant have enough of that the second one is a 2x2 tile with the jurassic world logo on it thats pure awesome the bigger sets seem to have only sticker for that so this little set is a perfect way to get hold of this nice tile the leftovers nothing special here is the complete trap it is a basic build and functions pretty well in the end the parts are more interesting as the build so it will definitely end up as a partspack now on to the star of this bag the celophysisgallimimus i dont know why lego decided to call this dinosaur mold any different but i think it has to do with movieconnection and the will to not produce a new mold nevermind this figure is great and the colour is very bright and totally stood out pretty beastie a comparison between the 2015 gallimimus and the 2012 celophysis the final set in all its glory final verdict it is a great little set the parts used a nice and usefull the printed tiles are the secret stars of this set and the dinosaur is fun two with a few packs of these you could easily build a celophysis pack with lots of jurassic world signs on their way highly recommended	positive

lego 31036 creator toy and grocery shop thanks to eurobricks for making this review possible for years lego has offered a house of some sort in the creator line each year  with the standard creator 3in1 instructions thats given us a very wide variety of housing in 2014 they added a business option with their 31026 bike shop and cafe set this continues into this years toy and grocery shop set these shops are smaller than the very detailed modular buildings but that should help them fit in better with the other city sets and this also lets them get into more kids cities with their lower pricetag name toy and grocery shop set number 31036 pieces 466 price 3999 minifigs 2 theme creator year of release 2015 links bricklink peeron brickset the box the front of the box shows the a version model out of the three plus insets of the b and c versions i like the sortaeuropean looking backdrop it goes well with the styling of the buildings interestingly the main model is shown opened up for play while the two insets show those versions folded the box top on the top of the box lego helpfully shows that with 3 of these sets you can make a whole street the box back on the back you get to again see all three versions together but this time folded its a little creepy though with those clones running around  the manuals yep three actual printed manuals theres nothing indicating them as being a b and c models but its pretty obvious looking at the designs which is the main model and which are the alternates the contents bags of parts and two plates nothing terribly exciting to see here the minifigs nothing new here but two nice figs nonetheless well bricklink does say that both figs are unique to this set but theres not any new parts to them the closest thing to rare is the female head  its only in this set 2013s dragon mountain castle set a uk store grand opening set and one of the 2014 holiday freebie sets the faces arent that unique but i guess this exact combo of two faces on the head is i love the kid torso with the spaceman on it the minifig backs no back printing on anything here except for an alternate female face sorry i do like that her two faces are so different though thats much better than when a head has a scared and a more scared face the c build enough with the basics lets build im going to review them in the same order i built them backwards since you can tell immediately looking at the 3 designs that theyre going to use different numbers of pieces and so forth i figured id build the smallest first lest it seem like a letdown all three have some basic similarities  the two plates are hinged to give a building that opens for play they also do have interiors which you can see starting to form here the c build front its a pretty quick build so its done already heres the front of the building with it opened up like this it appears to be two separate stores a newsstand and some sort of shop you can enter all the printed tiles help give the newsstand a detailed appearance but im not sure why theyve got a 100 bill lying on the ledge the c build rear from the back side the interiors are pretty plain the shop half has a plant in a jar and a weird chair and the newsstand just has a register the c build sides heres the two sides of the folded building on the hinge side theres a bunch of windows in a disjointed wall with random colors on the other why did they put in a huge window when the set does include a transclear door that could have gone there and you get a small patch of plants like so many sets seem to have these days the c build extras thats a lot of leftovers there and not just little stuff  multiple doors stairs etc and unused sand green is always a little sad the b build 1 a pretty similar start with the hinge and little garden and some tiles along the ground the b build 2 now we see a big windowed wall some details like lights and how it has the usual alternate model weird part usage  like a 1x4 brick with side studs being used over the doorway even though those side studs will not get used the b build front the finished building gives us a nice little post office with a lettercarrying bird on the roof hope thats not their normal method of delivery something about the colors just doesnt work for me though the combo of white  light grey  dark grey  black  sand green plus tan is just too much the tan window and door frames i dont like the b build inside on the inside things are weird the counter on the left is ok but the light above the door with a yellow clip ugly is too big and everything else over there by the door doesnt make much sense either the b build sides i like the front side here except the colors are still too much the bench greenery mailbox on the corner and streetlight are all nice the boy is a little creepy though  binoculars in hand plus a telescope on the roof of the post office why the hinge side shows more of the weird colors you get in the wall but thats going to be hidden when the set is open plus we even see that on big modulars at times so its not so terrible the b build leftovers again a lot of leftover parts its obvious this was another alternate but itd be nice to see more of them used to make a bigger building but lets move on to the model that does use them all the a build 1 the first half starts like this maybe its just my bias but it already feels like a more detailed build bottles on the wall the yellow and red awning over the window etc the a build 2 the other half starts off with detailed work too i think thats a red vending machine the stairs are also very solidly built i also appreciate the effort to get that diagonal base where a door will be  its such a nice touch to have sections of a building that arent right angles the a build 3 not too much has been added but i wanted to showcase the tiny toys before they get hidden by a wall that robot and train are just fantastic little micro builds the a build 4 things are coming together quickly the walls windows and doors get the first floor nearly done im still not big on the sand green and tan combo but i do really like the red and yellow awnings the a build 5 it appears the shop owner lives upstairs since weve got a bedroom forming here the bed is a little plain but the table and lamp on the other half are great and my big fingers did not like putting all those railings on the balcony with the telescope posts and tile tops knocked quite a few off before i got them all done the a build front and its done all the details make this set really feel like a minimodular the roofline has great greebling and the shop contents and on and on its not perfect though the tiny car above the toy store door isnt nearly as good as the toys inside and the kids yellow scooter the wheels arent even on the ground much less able to roll the scooter looks decent though so that counts for something well at least as long as you are at this angle since the boys only got 1 foot on the 1 stud wide scooter the a build inside most of the interior has been seen already the roof though does a nice job of being interesting for a roof a skylight the edge rails etc and you can see theres not much wrong color in the walls the a model sides an interesting building when folded up very tall and skinny you can tell its not really meant to be displayed this way  its meant to be open the good  lots i like the awning the diagonal door the flowerbox under the upper window the folding gate on the balcony that lets it be used in open or closed mode and the green  white  blue colors the bad  well the stairs end short of the upper door i still dont really like the tan doorframes i think black would have been better and why dont the upper floors match up in size the a model leftovers ah thats more like it just a few small pieces left as spares the errors you might have to click through to the fullsize versions but i did catch a few weird errors in the manuals first in the photo of the newsstand the map in the front corner is on there sideways the map does have a clear north arrow printed on it on the second image the boys feet are hanging off the edge just unusual to see an alignment error in the manual like that the comparison here are this set and the modular detective office side by side theres a huge difference  as youd expect but is the difference more than youd expect this set is 466 parts 40 the do is 2262 pieces and 160 5 times the parts 4 times the price looking at them side by side id expect a bigger difference in both the conclusion so whats my conclusion on this model i love the main model but the alternates are meh its a nice set for someone looking for a town building other than police and fire stations but who isnt ready to move to the modular line compared to the modulars though it seems overpriced part of that is because the huge modulars are actually a great deal compared to other lego sets im also a little surprised that its so small when you compare it to the city sets like a police station those are generally designed with much more open space letting them be more of a playset this one is small and cramped so itd be tougher to play in its not really a city set though the ratings value 710  its under the 10 cents a part mark but thats largely due to having a ton of tiny parts all those flowers and decorative 1x1 round studs add up quickly design 710  good and bad on the colors and theres a big difference between the quality of the main vs alternate models having so many leftover pieces is one thing when the creator set makes 3 very different models ie a boat plane and truck when its 3 buildings it seems wasteful to have so many parts leftover minifigs 610  im not sure they both fit the set i suppose the boy is going to the toy store and the woman is going to the grocery but theres no storekeeper in either the woman doesnt look like a storekeeper to me so thats why i assume shes another shopper i love the boy but the woman is just soso  except that i do appreciate the head having two very different expressions but again that doesnt fit the set i cant see her scared face being used playability 610  the shops are detailed with registers and so forth but its all so tiny itd be hard to play with the figs in it parts 910  tons of windows and doors plus nice sand green bricks but some things the large blue curves used on the roof for example are weirdly specialized and would be hard to use in another building design overall 710  id recommend doing what i did  build the alternates first then the main since thats how youll want to leave it id really like to see the price a little lower compared to other sets again the part count is inflated due to so many tiny parts and the finished building is tiny but its loaded with neat details	positive
great review very thorough its not a set which makes me run to tye store but it definitely has some fun elements i do like your new grey background your pictures look great	neutral
nice review mostlytechnic i particularly like the use of grey background surface for the pictures it somehow makes the building stand out more good job	neutral
a terrific very comprehensive review  but im not at all impressed with this set it feels like a mishmash of bricks with no clear design aesthetic and as such blatantly underdeveloped ie designed to hit a pricebrick count point rather than provide a solid set in the creator town tradition compared to other creator sets at this price point 31025  mountain hut for example it feels utterly uninspired and ugly edited by johnny6666 04 may 2015  1002 am	negative
stevkir on 04 may 2015  0806 am said any chance you have a picture of the news stand next to the detectives office building as i would love to see the scaling for that sorry i do not  but itd be tiny and not look like the same scale johnny6666 on 04 may 2015  0959 am said it feels like a mishmash of bricks with no clear design aesthetic and as such blatantly underdeveloped ie designed to hit a pricebrick count point rather than provide a solid set in the creator town tradition compared to other creator sets at this price point 31025  mountain hut for example it feels utterly uninspired and ugly well i felt like the main model almost got to good looking  id replace some of the tan with black but otherwise im ok with that one	neutral
cheers for putting in the time to create a wonderful review i am not a huge fan of this set i like the colour combinations but it all seems a bit alltoosimple it can and will be nicely modularised though	negative
thanks mostlytechnic for this review i only brought this set to continue the shop series from creator in my opinion its only half as good as the bike shopcafe one plus it doesnt fit the same as that pair of shops oh well maybe next year lego creator will have a better one brick on review on mostlytechnic 	neutral
reviews for this set really should picture them next to the bike shop  cafe which its intended to be compatible with right down to the size of the baseplates and grey tiles around the edge it doesnt look that great on its own but if you add the two sets together you get something that begins to look like a street scene	positive

this seems like half of a set compared to the previous bike shopcafe as i like many of the elements i will probably buy a second one and build a mirror image version making one entirely a toy shop and the other a book storenews stand and adjust the sidewalks to work with the previous model then i think they will work well together i remember a little area in copenhagen that had this sort of architecture i would hope the subsequent models are better deigned to create more complex alternatives but these are both good starting points for original or enhanced models	neutral
thank you andy for your speed review y so theres nothing left to open while advent  i like all the tiny sets it neednt be another police and fireman   but well what would an advent calendar be without them d one thing about the train traffic lights tlc used to give us similar lights but you could show either of the lights with the other one being covered that one was waaay better  just a little piece more would have done the thing and i wont mention the radarcrapdish x let me quote franz beckenbauer is denn scho weihnacht legendary quote from an promotional job he did years ago  is it xmas already	neutral
asuka on sep 13 2007 0115 pm said but although i loved the last years one i think they could do another theme or perhaps even two calendars because right now castles pretty hot imo really hope they do different themes next year but not sure how theyd managed 24 different minisets for castle can envisage 78 minifigs but what else	neutral

informative review thanks y as usual it makes a fairly good parts pack wish i could pick up a few on deep discount but at full price one is fine i do like the stewards and some of the workmen overall i think im looking more forward to the belville calendar just for its assortment of unusual parts ugh belville still parts are parts and its got some phoinix summed up one of the most common complaints i hear about all of the lines in 3 simple words  no girlsagain good job now get lego to listen 	positive

im a big fan of anime and have watched some mechas like full metal panic neon evangelion genesis it is a mecha and chobits well she is a robot so i was curious to see what this new exo force line was all about the colorful sets and mangalike characters didnt persuade me right away but the urgent need for a couple of white 3x3 wing plates made me purchase this little thing it cost me 70 dkr as you can see on the box this is 930 euro or about the same an american has to pay for the new republic cruiser pretty expensive for so few pieces 90  a spare technic pin the box an actionpacked box with one of the sides being oddly empty except from the legologo whats inside there is a small building instruction two polybags no bag building here and a sticker sheet with alarmingly many stickers the build it takes so little time to build this set that i didnt get to take any pictures of the process every step was accompanied by an element description although i doubt most of you will need that with so few pieces to keep track on most of the dark green bricks have a sticker  even the slopes where the rough surface makes stickers fall off easily there should also have been a sticker on the windshield but i wanted to keep that piece clean for better usage later im one of those who keeps stickers on the bricks the model you want to see this model from the front as the back is pretty much neglected there isnt much for the pilot to grab a hold on either he is pretty much a sitting duck up there with the screen giving him only partial cover there is a huge wrench next to him which kind of symbolizes the crudeness of the mech the set isnt called cyclone defender for nothing the right arm might hold an ordinary light assault riffle but the other has a spinning disc with samurai swords which you can turn with the yellow knob on the backside those of you who have seen robot wars might remember the incredible power of this melee weapon from a robot named hypnodisc it would have been nice had there been a pullback motor to power the disc im sure lego has a lot of these in stock but the simple mechanism still works reasonably well the riffle comes off and a pin makes it easy to hold with the hand but the disc is fixed to the arm it is also a problem that the swords get misaligned quickly during play the minifig i really like this minifig because of the neat idea with an expression on each side that lego has made a standard for exo force posability most mechmocers show off their creations using gundamlike poses with two joints per leg one being the ankles and one for an arm i thought of some less serious poses crawling silent like a ninja belly gliding kick off upside down final rating i have to disappoint you here this is my first set in this line and i have absolutely no idea of how good it is the last robot i bought was the awesome 6889 spyrius recon robot for the same price but it is in a completely different genre the set had what i expected two white wings and is as such a nononsense set i guess it would be of more use if you have some more exo force which i dont 610 ups has great minifig weapons and is easy to build downs crude design and a bit too expensive for what you get brickshelf gallery	neutral
nice review  but you paid how much this set is priced around 7 euros here in germany which is a very fair price for what you get in my oppinion its a little disappointing though that i couldnt think of any alternate builds for this set and there are no inspirations on the box or the ef website	neutral
930 euro is msrp here in denmark 7 euro would have resulted in a nicer reception from my part but the strong marked position of lego in its homeland together with the general high prices because some of us are supposedly rich makes the prices less bearable it is funny you should mention germany i thought the prices for lego were even higher there im sure i paid more than msrp last time i bought lego from from your country on the other hand the last thing i bought was the 5521 model team sea jet from 1993	neutral

i couldnt find a review of this wonderful set in here so here it goes i got the set for msrp 180kr  24 euro which is a fair price here in denmark as all other creator sets there are instructions for several models 3 in this case the box the box is a little larger than city sets in the same price range the primary model is shown on the front while you see the secondary ones on the back what you get 312 pieces in 5 polybags and two building instructions one for the primary model and the other for the rest the built it was impossible for me to speed build this model because of the nifty functional details from the retractable landing gear to the wings that can turn by means of the handle in the back of the model it took me a full hour to build it because i had to test how it all works together the finished model the landing gear isnt fully enclosed when retracted and the models are subminifig scale but i still love the design of the models the doors for the rear wheels open as you pull the wheels down and the final piece of functionality comes from the wings that can either tilt the horizontal stabilizers or have elevators wing in wings out wings in wings out ratings as a whole i actually like this set even more than the big rig the models are just as diverse but the added functionality makes the plane more fun to play with than the rig price 710  a good price but not a bargain as the big rig design 910  there could have been a sligtly higher level of details in the main model but all models are really good looking and i especially like the design of the hovercraft functionality 1010  i guess you could ask for working rudders opening cockpit and so on but the plane is really filled with movable parts and the turning of the wings works really well secondary models 710  a hovercraft how awesome is that if only the last model was just as inventive instead of a standard helicopter modifiability 810  the bricks are in ordinary colours and there is a good variety of them giving you plenty of possibilities for mocing you can easily make the main model into something that looks more like an f14 910 probably as good as it gets for a creator set in this price range it is entertaining to both build and play with looks good and the secondary models are worth building as well brickshelf gallery	positive

thank you sinner for bringing the pictures of the hovercraft i think it is a really cool model but the steering wheel doent work too well it doesnt turn easilly all the way around and when the craft turns it doesnt stay stable on the three wheels because the front wheel turns quite alot into the opposite side now to the third model this is quite a basic helicopter with the functionality of having the rotors turning it doesnt use that many of the bricks and doesnt even have a landing gear i have a question to all of you as you can see i prefer to show one or two large pictures and have the rest as clickable thumbnails most people use only the relatively big typically 640x480 pictures so that you dont have to follow links what do you prefer it is no problem for me to do it the other way but i would like to know if you have any preferences	neutral

3499 is not too shabby the big guy itself is nice but the gem of the set is the mech really nice mech i must say great for posing the mini figs suprisingly nice little buildvehicle never seen this element beforeits probably nothing new though lol no articulation of the legs nooooooo phew the front two legs do articulate would of been bad if they didnt overall i give the set 7810 not the best but its actually quite nice and the yellow mech is awesome if it was him on his own then 9410 cheers	positive

it is no secret that marvel is one of the most successful companies right now from the avengers to the xmen and down to even the most obscure characters like antman every one of their movies has been a big hit until now the latest marvel movie fant4stic was released last month and while i have not seen it yet im sure its just as great as their other movies i mean it has the word fantastic in the title after all and being the smart business that they are the lego company decided to get in on the hype early and capitalize on this movies undoubtful success two years in advance by making a set featuring fant4stics main villain dr doom now thats what i call forward thinking but did they do a good job with it or were they being overhasty lets find out set number 76005 name spiderman daily bugle showdown theme marvel super heroes subtheme ultimate spiderman year of release 2013 pieces 476 minifigs 5 price 4999 usd sh description quote swing into the daily bugle and stop dr doom™ dr doom™ and his henchman beetle™ are attacking the daily bugle in their speedy jet to steal spidermans™ secret identity its up to spiderman™ and nova™ to swing in and stop them trigger the daily bugles explosion functions to cause destruction as the jet fires missiles stop dr doom™ from hitching the jets anchor hook to the safe with spidermans secret inside knock beetle™ off the building with the swinging web attack and drop dr doom™ inside with the rooftop trapdoor then fly nova™ in through the broken window with the dumpster catapult function and send those villains back to where they came from includes spiderman™ nova™ dr doom™ beetle™ and j jonah jameson™ with accessories and weapons the first thing that comes to mind after reading this description is wow thats a lot of tms anyway here are some resource links for this set brickset bricklink rebrickable the box since this set is based on the ultimate spiderman cartoon the box has the usual usm design with the red marvel super heroes background an illustration of spidey in the upper right corner and the usm logo in the lower right as usual there is a minifig line up in the lower left and since this was before the terrible redesign you can see the full body of the minifigs i really miss this type of line up there is quite a lot going on here doctor doom attacking the daily bugle in his jet while simultaneously reaching for j jonah jameson below with his jets claw spiderman reluctantly swings in to save him while nova fights off the beetle its a pretty cool scene even though its not very accurate to the show in beetle mania the episode that this set is based on the beetle was indeed out to kill jjj but it was in order to stop him from exposing his identity not spidermans although spidey was next on jjjs list and while he is a recurring villain on the show doctor doom had nothing to do with this plot and didnt even appear in the episode aside from a brief cameo its awesome that they included him anyway though so im not gonna complain note that the tower is so tall that it wraps around the top of the box there you can also see a scale reference with the spiderman minifig on the back of the box you can see the interior of the bugle and all of its play features which there are quite a few of since this is a playset its all illustrated pretty well although legos choice of sound effects is still a mystery to me i dont get why they dont go for spidermans signature fwip instead of fazzing and i didnt know that a breaking window made the sound btoom but i digress contents inside the box you will find three instruction booklets one smaller than the others a comic book a fairly large sticker sheet five numbered bags and two loose pieces a white string piece and a gray 16x8 plate there arent really any notable pieces and nobody cares about the comic bock no offense to the artist so lets get right to the instructions they are pretty straight forward and easy to follow some of the pages have a ghostly image of spidey nova and dr doom in the top right corner which is fitting since these are all minifigs that appear in this set which is strangely not something that can be said for many other super heroes instructions with this type of artwork minifigures as with most super heroes sets most people will get this set mainly for the minifigs so without further ado lets talk about them spiderman is the same old bootless one you get in almost every usm set not much to say about him some might complain that we dont get spideys alter ego peter parker in this set but in the usm cartoon mj is actually the one who works at the daily bugle not peter curse the creators of this cartoon for ruining our chances of getting a new peter parker minifig by trying to mix things up next we get j jonah jameson he appeared in a spiderman 2 set before but this is a complete redesign he now has a blue suit with a red tie a unique face print and that combedback hair in dark gray this new hairpiece doesnt suit him at all and the old flat top hair was perfect for him in my opinion so i dont know why they changed it the good thing about this change however is the fact that this piece is exclusive to this set in that color nova on the other hand is spoton he comes with a new helmet mold and some nice torso printing however he too is missing his boots tlc should have started making dualcolored legs a long time ago here are some reference images to compare them to okay so jjjs hair may not be completely black in the show but i still think they should have given his minifig a black hairpiece his suit is also not quite the right color he rarely appears in person in the show including the episode this set is based on and is usually seen on screens around new york so this is the best picture of him i could find i guess i should be happy they included a minifig of him at all in the episode it was actually mary jane who was at the bugle during beetles attack so it would have made more sense to include her but we got her in the spidercopter set one year later so thats ok all three of them have back printing in jjjs case im using that term loosely since it is only comprised of two lines but its nice that they went through the trouble of adding them both jjj and nova come with angry alternate faces it almost looks like theyre trying to outangry each other who do you think looks angrier let me know in the comments section below now lets talk about the bad guys even though he would be better off in a fantastic four set its great to finally get victor van doom one of the greatest marvel villains ever and in comics in general he comes with a dark green hood which was new and exclusive in that color at the time and he is the only minifig in this set that has leg printing beetle is a regular minifig with wings the metallic printing on his face and torso is pretty nice but i wish it would have continued onto his legs as well the beetle looks quite accurate to his onscreen counterpart the only thing that could have improved him is a new helmet mold with pointy eyebrowsantennae doctor doom however looks nothing like he does in the movie i just dont understand how lego could have messed him up so badly maybe they were working off of early concept art or something here is a back view of doom and beetle beetle would be a pretty boring minifig if it wasnt for his wings which are awesome with their holographic texture they are so mesmerizing i could look at those things all day this piece also appeared in trans light green in the galaxy squad sets which came out at the same time here they are without their gear as you can see they both have back printing as well and no doctor doom does not come with an alternate facial expression which is fine since you cant see much of his expressions due to his mask anyway heres a look at dr doom and nova without their headgear some say that dooms face looks too cartoony but i think it looks fine nova is wearing stylish goggles as a way of explaining his white eyes its a far better explanation than the batsweatband they did the same thing with the masked wolverine later here are all the figs with their accessories jjj comes with a camera so that he can take more pictures of spiderman beetle comes with one of those overused adu guns which is a very poor representation of his wristmounted blasters i hate to say it but even those bulky new stud shooters would have been a better representation of his weapons spidey comes with his usual string of webbing and nova comes with some iron man style translucent studs the weird thing is that they are red while his powers have a blue glow in the show doctor doom sadly doesnt get any accessories but who needs weapons when you have a jet with a claw and flickfire missiles the build the first bag contains spiderman a brick separator and the parts to build the ground floor of the dbc building after a quick and straightforward build you get this the dumpster and street lamp are separate from the building and since the lamp post is not built onto any baseplate and is quite topheavy it gets knocked over pretty easily maybe its meant to be that way but i would have preferred it if you could stick it onto the baseplate of the building on which there is unfortunately not enough space to do so as you would expect the second bag has the parts for the first floor of the building this is also the bag that contains beetle after another fairly simple build youll find yourself with a two story building with a spiderweb one side and a fire escape on the other however you have to apply three stickers during this section of the build which is never fun can you guess whats in bag number 3 yup the second floor of the building you dont need superpowers to predict that one also this bag contains nova and jameson the build of this section is a bit repetitive since the second floor is mostly the same as the first and it takes slightly longer to build since you have to build the rooftop as well also in addition to the two window stickers you have to apply ten 2x2 tile stickers trying to do this without having any of them being crooked is a real pain in the megablocks the next bag contains doctor doom and the cockpit of his jet dooms cape is in the usual square white box and the string for the claw is folded up in a piece of tape heres what you get at the end of this section looks more like an escape pod than a jet at this point the final bag is the smallest as it only includes the few parts needed to finish the doom jet once you build the wings and tail you stick them onto the cockpit via technic pins and youre done spare parts these are the parts that are left over after the build there is the brick separator of course an extra antenna and the usual little bits and bops whats really awesome though is that they give you an extra pair of beetles wings considering what a neat piece this is and that this is the only set in which it comes in transblack make this a very welcome spare that you can use in your customs the finished set here is the complete set the dbc building looks quite tall especially when you count the antenna comparing it to a screenshot from the episode the general look of the building is there although there are some inaccuracies aside from the fact that it is obviously way downscaled the screens that show jjj ranting about spiderman should have been hexagonal not square and should have wrapped around the building however considering how many stickers you would have had to apply if they would have made it accurate im actually glad they kept the screen mercifully small much like doctor doom himself the doom jet didnt actually appear in the beetle mania episode however it did appear in a later episode titled not a toy in which spiderman plays around with captain americas shield accidentally drops it in doctor dooms latvarian embassy and has to try to retrieve it and yes that episode was as godawful as it sounds heres a screenshot of the jet from that episode like with the dbc they managed to capture the general shape of the vehicle although it doesnt look quite as good as in the show the color scheme is too dark and it looks kind of blockier lets take a closer look at the jet there is no real way to reel the claw in unfortunately however there is a stud on the back of the jet that you can stick it onto needless to say this is not the ideal way of storing it i would have much preferred it if they would have attached it onto winch instead the engines on the wings can be turned even though they dont turn in the show and there is a flickfire missile on each side even if its not much to look at at least its a very swooshable vehicle on top of each wing there is a tile with the emblem of latvaria there was no such emplems on the jet in the cartoon but they are useful pieces that make it clear whose jet it is so im glad they included them there is nothing inside the cockpit except for a seat and unless you want to ruin dr dooms nice dark green cape i wouldnt put him inside of it they could have at least printed a control panel onto that empty 2x2 tile play features since this is a playset lets look at all the play features it has to offer like all playsets the building is open in the back so you can play inside on the ground floor there is a potted plant and nothing else seriously is this all they could come up with for this floor they could have included a security desk a lounge a second plant or anything else as it is its just a boring empty lobby the first floor is a bit more interesting there is a safe a swiveling chair and a pin board with various pictures of spiderman there is one tile that reads the true identity of spiderman which is supposedly what the villains are after i wonder how jameson got this information in the first place speaking of jameson the second floor is devoted to his office where he can sit and yell at his nonpresent employees demanding more pictures of spiderman it also has a swiveling chair as well as a desk with a lamp and a computer there is a technic beam connecting his desk with the ceiling of the first floor which you can remove in order to take off the upper half of the building but its difficult to do so i dont recommend it as you may have noticed in the picture above there are a few red pegs sticking out of the building these are for triggering the play features most of them are on the roof there is one on what looks like an air conditioning unit if you place spiderman holding is webstring on the jumper plate in front of it and push the peg spidey goes bungeejumping off the building wee there is also one that sticks out of the side of the building which when pulled triggers a trap door the third red peg on the roof can be used to pop off the dbc sign why is it called the dbc you ask it stands for daily bugle communications since in this version of spiderman the daily bugle is not only a newspaper but a news tv station as well one that promotes its own highly biased views so basically the fox news of the marvel universe i guess if youre an old school spiderman fan you could just leave off the c and have it just stand for daily bugle the sign above the main entrance wont be so easily modified however there is also a peg between the first and second floor which when pushed pops out one of the windows on the first floor the safe is only attached to a couple of jumper plates and has some jumper plates on top of it as well so you can easily attach the doom jets claw to it and rip it out of the building as seen on the back of the box there are also some snot bricks on the corners of the building that you can attach spiderwebs or spidey himself onto for some wallcrawling and webslinging action this is not so much a play feature as it is just a feature but as i mentioned earlier there is a fire escape on the left side of the building this was a neat idea as it helps it feel like a building in new york city but it is executed very poorly there is no hole big enough for the minifigs to climb down through so they would have to climb down the ladders from the outside which makes no sense no wonder spiderman always needs to rescue people from burning buildings there is one more play feature in the form of the dumpster you can open the lid put a minifig inside and make them jump by hitting a tab in the back remember this is before the introduction of super jumpers but nevertheless its a pretty strange place to launch minifigs out of i guess even super heroes like to do some dumpster diving you dont think this was funny no well me neither but thats the type of humor that this show loves to use sigh anyway lets get on to the ratings ratings design 25  the set looks ok despite many inaccuracies the dbc building and the jet somewhat resemble their onscreen counterparts and dont look too bad but they definitely could be better build 15  a mostly unchallenging and repetitive build with an attrocious amount of stickers minifigs 45  definitely the strongest point of the set some of the figs could be better but four out of five of them are exclusive to this set doctor doom is easily the best and probably the most desirable one  unless the fant4stic movie portraits him so badly that nobody will be interested in him but thats impossible playability 45  as you would expect from a playset the playability is quite high although i still feel like there could have been more parts 35  not many rare parts if youre looking for parts for building your own skyscraper with tan walls and lots of doors and windows though this set is for you price 35  at 476 parts for 50 this set is a bit pricey but it is somewhat justified by all the large window and wall pieces overall 35  this set is mediocre at best playsets are always a good choice for spiderman sets since they give spidey something to swing from but unfortunately they are rarely pulled off well the jet is blocky the building is barebones and the price feels too high the only reason to get this set are the four exclusive minifigs this set was discontinued early this year but if you still see it on clearance somewhere go ahead and get one for the minifigs and parts or buy multiples and use the parts to build a better dbc building i hope you enjoyed this review it is part of the reviewers academys 7th anniversary were not doing a big celebration this year due to other commitments but look out for more reviews with the 7th anniversary banner soon now if youll excuse me i am off to see fant4stic i hope its as fantastic as it promises to be 2 hours later i was wrong i was horribly horribly wrong	positive
hahah entertaining and informative a great read thanks for the review on a side note i thought fantfourstic wasok on the poorer side of ok the exposition felt like it was from a 3 hour film because it was so long and towards the middle it started to drag the ending was terrible edited by mutant orc 12 september 2015  0953 pm	positive
this is my favourite set should be making more spidey sets like this imo cough oscorp tower cough	positive
this set is from 2013 doctor doom is completely based off the comic version tv show version not the movie in any way anyways nice review i personally own this set and its a nice set but could have been better edited by aegis2000 13 september 2015  0233 am	neutral
yeah im really hoping the concept artdoom minifig joke is just that i picked this set up on whim mostly because a needed a building to add to a moc as a parts pack its not a bad set at all	positive
thanks for the review ive had that set for quite a while and its among my favorite marvel superheroes sets actually compared to the other stuff we usually get to accompany the minifigs all those laboratorys the most recent construction site and the hydra fortress  yeah youre being a little harsh here maybe youre still suffering from ptsd after watching fantfourstic	neutral
i actually am surprised at the poor points this set has gotten as this is one of my favorite sets that marvel has put out i actually would like to hear what your thoughts are on the usm  lego dr doom comparison oky thanks for the review httpmarvelanimateordoomusmpng edited by zorglorfian 14 september 2015  0644 am	neutral

overall i wish marvel in particular would have more playsets in its theme batman has several great ones in the dc theme but then again if this is the best playset to date for marvel maybe its better just to leave well enough alone i would definitely like to see them attempt something in the 100 us price range because i think it could be good marvel needs an equivalent to the arkham asylum set regarding this set i saved myself some money and bought the 4 minifigs i needed all but spidey on bricklink for less than half the set price edited by dmarvin 17 september 2015  0625 pm	neutral
this set seems to appeal more to the non superhero crowd it is one of the only marvel sets i bought mainly because i thought that the building was a nice return to the old style of city sets i would love to see this sort of backdrop for a more realistic agents theme i also liked that most of the figs in this set were easier to merge into other nonsuper uses thanks for the review god bless nathan	neutral
another great review oky i love this set	positive

hello everyone by now many excited lego star wars fans have started receiving their ucs falcon some of us here enjoy writing reviews and sharing our thoughts i mentioned to yoda that i was planning on doing a review of this set but it would likely take me a few weeks of 12 hours per night to finish building the set yoda suggested that i do the review as i go so everyone could see the progress of the set what a great idea so here is the first entry feel free to comment along the way i will try to post photos and updates every night on the build then wrap up the review when i complete the set if you have any specific questions or photo requests please be sure to ask ucs millennium falcon reviewed by dunamis set 10179 5195 pieces 49995 from lego shop at home the box obviously this is a box like no other first of all it comes in its own shipping carton inside of that there is a standard lego carton finally inside the lego carton we have the actual millennium falcon box and a nice little letter thanking you for buying the biggest lego set ever shipping box naboo set provided for scale lego carton and letter lego carton the millennium falcon box is really quite nice there are lots of photos and it does a good job of selling the set there are 8 individual pieces of tape that keep the lid on the box the limited first edition comes with a seal on the lower left corner millennium falcon box naboo set provided for scale lifting the lid straight up reveals one compartment of several bags on the right on the left we find a thin square box like a pizza box that contains the official certificate of authenticity two sticker sheets and one enormous manual under the pizza box we find two more compartments each filled with several typical lego bags the box weighs 24 pounds stickers pizza box pieces in compartments not quite sure what the little 30th anniversary sticker is for yet the certificate of authenticity is on heavy paper and is suitable for framing more to come tomorrow its late here	positive
good idea to make this review while you build the set ill be monitoring your progress and feedback the box so huge impressive	positive
nice review ill be watching and waiting for the rest	positive
will follow this impatiently  really like the start of the review y you always seems to pull it of nicely in comparission with the exasperating yoda xd p build on play on on on	positive
many tks dunamis for doing that its really great and i cant wait monitoring your progress on the beast 8 like it was mentionned in another thread the box looks less gigantic than i thought  remember the isd box  that was a huge box  is the instruction book in the pizza box  how big is it  im sure its really big and i hope for our sake that the colours are clearly marked xd if you know what i mean d  tks againand im so looking forward to your next post  ras 74 on sep 27 2007 0851 am said you always seems to pull it of nicely in comparission with the exasperating yoda xd p what what what  have you stopped your medication once again xd yoda	positive
excellent beginning our numbers are very close but i havent the luxury of space to build it so ill be enjoying it by proxy through you enjoy y	positive
wow that box is big but i somehow thought it would be even bigger still it looks like for once lego are actully using all the space inside and not just a fraction like with other sets cant wait to see more dunamisyou lucky megablok 	neutral

thats awesome man lucky that you got it i want it so badly and it has a huge box too zots	positive

the manual the gigantic manual measures 17 x 12 and is almost an inch thick it is spiral bound with a cardboard like front and back and it is 314 pages interesting decision not to break it up into multiple manuals it is almost unwieldy at this size and thickness unfortunately the manual is not available electronically from the lego website hopefully it will be soon missing were the little instructions at the beginning telling you to not build this beast on shag carpet and to sort out the 5000 pieces before you get started i guess they figure if you got 500 to spend on this thing you can build it however you want as usual we get the regular lego manual features  piece call outs for each step  parts inventory at the end of the manual  page numbers  photos of all the other 2007 sets at the end of the manual manual paperback book provided for scale various manual photos 8x8 plate provided for scale im about 2 hours into building and sorting im trying to stay a day ahead in my posting the build has been easier than i thought so far despite the massive number of pieces it has not been too hard to sort and find what you need build photos will start appearing in tomorrows entry	positive

my gawd that manuel is huge thats enough to put a sane man off of buying this setthank gawd none of us are sane thats all i can say xd just how many technic pins does this monster need 8 judging by that one pic theres gotta be a lot in this set	negative

nice idea reviewing the set while constructing it this is the top of the bill for any legocollector also financially speaking and i like the look of all those thousands of pieces the manual is incredible i thought i had a really thick manual coming with set 8479 but this one exceeds it with ease review on	positive
good review y me i cant build it before saturday 	positive
the build the build is going quicker than i thought i am sorting as i open the bags that i need some bags are in multiples so it is easy to pick them out the build is a tad repetitive as the framework of the ship is somewhat symmetrical here are some progress shots note that two plates 1x4 and 1x8 are stacked in between technic beams then the part below is assembled to hold the structure together this took about an hour of sorting and building ill post another update tomorrow	positive
so i see they even do mistakes on these  that beast looks really sturdy  that is great  are these yellow parts new  i am not a technic fan and never saw these before another question for you is the instruction book easy to follow especially regarding the colours does the black rally stands out comparing to the dark bley and so on  i sure hope so  cant wait to see moer hehe yoda	neutral
xwingyoda on sep 30 2007 1157 am said are these yellow parts new  i am not a technic fan and never saw these before you dont have the building crane 7905 either same color same shape there piece no 32555 four of them included i assume youre not a town fan p 	neutral
i have been taking photos for this review for a few months and i finally took the rest of the photos last night all the parts if you want tan this is the set to get main model the garage is a great addition but the car only just fits the main house is very nice looking the windows extend to the sides but not the back the chimney and drainage work very well and i love the basement i think the front works very well when i was making this i was multitasking doing weight training do a set do a step do a set and i ended up missing one of the row paths i discovered this after i finished the basement  the removable roof reveals byo floors probably why this is called a model house the roof was quite interesting to build this is my first large house set so it all was very new to me i love the garage door more nice pipework this photo i misfocused but there isnt much to see anyway the door is a nice touch the grill to the right on both sides is not just decoration as it hides the hinges for the door i also made one of the submodels i was considering keeping this but i decided against it once again the sides have windows but the back doesnt the truck is there to make the photo more worthwhile the roof to this one doesnt come off easily as all the tiles are used for the front just to clarify these houses arent attached so you can arrange them however you want the fronts are quite elaborate and it seems that lego were trying to make this almost like a simpler market street the truck is too small for a minifig but it probably was my favourite car thoughts i highly recommend this set in most countries it is good value for money including australia the design is excellent and three instructions are included the third is a school if anyone has made it and wants to post photos feel free at least one person at eb has made it i love how each house has its own car due to the way the primary model is made it is a bit weak at the corner but that was a design choice my only real complaint about this set is how lego is going though a mould transition and thus some roof slopes are rough others are smooth i can accept either and lego has been moving to smooth slopes for years now but to have a set with about 5050 is annoying the mtt was the same but that is my only gripe with this excellent set wub	positive
thanks for the review and tons of pics ive been wanting to pick this one up since i saw it i thought the 4956 creator house was nice but this model town house is in a completely different league i also like the alternate models that you can see in the catalogues	positive
thank you for the review sinner at first i wanted this set for the 4 blue 1x1 slope tiles but i can see there is much more into it than that it sure is a great value compared to what you get in the building bonanzas no cars and less detail it was funny to see the little side story in your pictures would it be hard to modify the cars to fit minifigs better	neutral
a beautiful and humorous review with very fine pics y a fantastic set full of neat details and in a wonderful color scheme great for every city builder for sure i guess we waited for sets like that we dreamed about them im glad we got them now  edit congrats it seems youve got your bucket back p	positive
i found the use of parts well done by the designers i made a car and then tried to make a house from a different instruction book i could not as several pieces were already used in the car nice to see them using all the parts like that rather than having a lot of extra bits moral of the story one instruction book at a time sweet	neutral
lasse d on sep 28 2007 0803 am said it sure is a great value compared to what you get in the building bonanzas no cars and less detail i was all for the white house until i saw this set i still wouldnt mind it though d lasse d on sep 28 2007 0803 am said would it be hard to modify the cars to fit minifigs better the problem with the blue truck is a lack of headroom however the truck is quite low and i cant see it being too hard to change and still have it looking good asuka on sep 28 2007 0830 am said great for every city builder for sure i guess we waited for sets like that we dreamed about them im glad we got them now  i think lego were really listening with this years creator sets wub with the exception of the ferris wheel they are all sets that you could buy 10 of and not have too many hard to use parts asuka on sep 28 2007 0830 am said edit congrats it seems youve got your bucket back p well in this reality anyway xd who knows what goes on in the wacker and walrus world but i do seem to be a tormented soul 	neutral

i too have bought this set and the only thing i notice which is a bit odd with the exception of there being no floors in the house is the lack of a steering wheel in the car	negative
thanks for the review sinner i definitely want this set now the mixed rough and smooth roof bricks would annoy me on a model like the mtt but here it looks as is if the roof is quite old with some parts being worn and pitted and some parts being replaced with new roof tiles i quite like the effect i agree on which is the best vehicle and if it doesnt fit minifigs just mod the heck out of it xd	positive

great review i just built the original and this one has clear advantages over the original though i wish lego would stop putting torsos with defined breasts and curves on children i really like pretty much every change i wont be getting it and id be lying if i said im not a little disappointed for the first four years my motherinlaw got me the new winter village set for christmas after the last two which didnt really fit thematically in my display i had hoped for a new oneparticularly since my daughter is getting to be around the age where she can play with them i mention her specifically because ive seen lots of people dismiss those who are a bit disappointed as rabid adults who dont care about kids getting cool sets and i dont think thats fair i may have to see how much some of the parts go for on bricklink the rerelease is better than the original but not good enough that id want to spend 80 to get a set thats nearly identical to one i have edited by tea weevil 29 november 2015  0431 pm	neutral

regarding the reason for the different designs on the inner bags i think that the white stripe is the new version with the nonstripe version being old i suspect the reason some sets have both versions is simply that theyre still using up some of their supply of older bags good review i didnt realise there were quite as many changes as you highlighted tree roof etc	positive
i missed out on the first one but i love the improvements made in this version like the tree having an actual brown trunk so it looks less like an artificial one and the carolers as well i may pick this up but im sorry to those of you who already have one	positive
cheers for putting up the review some nice improvements but not enough for me to pick it up the original set is good enough for me pity the poll has no option yes but only in addition to new sets not in stead of new sets edited by withacee 01 december 2015  0938 am	neutral
thanks for a nice review i am building it as we speak and i like it so far since i didnt have the old one i cant complain	positive
thanks for the review they definitely improved upon the original but since i already own the original i cant justify this set also unfortunately it seems to be the trend but im sure there are a lot of first timers out there too that will snatch this up since it is a really lovely building and the updates make it better for sure	neutral
oky on 29 november 2015  1145 am said as for the controversy over rereleasing the winter toy shop i can see where the haters are coming from but i find their complaints to be quite petty i can understand if youre disappointed because you already have the first winter toy shop and were looking forward to a new set this year but theres always next year if youre a completist and feel like tlg is forcing you to buy a set you dont need youre wrong nobody is forcing you to buy anything but yourself if you decide to buy every set in a theme no matter what it is thats your problem not legos so put down your torches and pitchforks and just be glad that they improved the set design and gave us another chance to buy this classic set there are far worse things that can happen in this world than lego rereleasing one of their most popular sets sorry for that little rant so what is your opinion on rereleases like this please cast your vote in the poll above after mocking people for holding a particular opinion you then turn around and ask people to express their opinion no thanks i guess ill keep my opinions to myself i certainly dont want to be labeled a hater	neutral
oky on 02 december 2015  1249 am said i dont think that would be a realistic option as that would mean that they would have to spend twice the resources on this theme which i dont think they are ready to do but if more people would like this option i can add it to the poll i know but one can always hope cant one i hope the wv theme will be continued in coming years with new sets but given santas workshop and this rerelease i dont get my hopes up too much time to get mocing and reverse engineering	neutral
i didnt own the original toy shop so i bought it this time around i just finished building it saturday and i love it however i wish they had both rereleased this one and came out with a new addition to the village 	positive
oky on 02 december 2015  1249 am said im not mocking anyone i just think that some people need to calm down a bit and that tlg is getting more hate than they deserve for this set but thats just my opinion and youre welcome to disagree with it everyone is entitled to their own opinion including you and me and yes i would love to hear your thoughts on this matter because i would like to have a friendly discussion on this subject thats cool and i appreciate that but i would recommend avoiding the use of the word hater then thats a perjorative term thats loaded with negative connotation as im sure youre well aware its the flipside to me calling you a mindless fanboy or a corporate shill those arent terms that invite friendly discussion they shut down discussion by belitting the other persons opinion and implying that they lack the maturity or intelligence to think critically i dont actually care all that much about this set you just hit on a pet peeve of mine is all and its one that i see spreading throughout eurobricks which is a shame the use of terms like hater whiner or fanboy are becoming much too prevalent around here	neutral
review  42044  display team jet introduction the smallest of the 2016 sets is the display team jet it doesnt seem to have lots of functionality but maybe the landing gear is retractable this set kind of reminds me to the 9394  jet plane although its obviously a lot smaller as you can read in my review of the 42052  heavy lift helicopter basically anything flying is 1 for me so lets find out if this set also fits the bill note all images can be clicked for hires versions set information number 42044 title display team jet theme technic released 2016 part count 113 box weight 193 gr box dimensions 154 cm x 138 cm x 59 cm set price msrp € 999 price per part € 0088 links brickset bricklink the box being a small set it obviously comes in a small box the display team jet is an aerobatics jet used in air shows on the box its flying rather high but at least its at a safe distance from the crowd front side shows the main model together with a small section indicating you can use digital building instructions to build this model back side the back side shows the bmodel a stunt plane and again a reference to the apps for digital building instructions more on the stunt plane later content of the box the box contains 2 instructions booklets a and bmodel 1 sticker sheet 3 technic liftarms 2 bags instruction booklets both the instructions for the a and bmodel are included in the box sticker sheet a lot of stickers for such a small set apparently no panel is left untouched liftarms three liftarms unsealed nothing out of the ordinary for a small set bags two bags containing the rest of the parts highlighted parts this section describes the new andor otherwise interesting parts yellow 5l axles the 5l axle in yellow has never been released before so its one of the new parts for this year black 7l flex axles for the layman this seems a common part but the 7l soft axle actually has never been released in black before combined with the rerelease of the 19l soft axle in black this will open up lots of possibilities for those of you thinking youve read this text before you are right the new drag racer contains these new 7l flex axles too white panels this small set comes with a whopping 10 panels great for the ones who like panels not so great if you think tlg is using too much panels lately rudder this part the small bionicle wing is the same as the one used in last years 42033  record breaker part list this set contains 113 parts all listed below the build this is the collection of parts used to build the jet it sure looks like we are getting a landing gear the build is fun but pretty straightforward there arent any special or cool techniques used in this set it almost took me more time to apply all the stickers than to build the actual model finished model the finished jet does look cool though the white and yellow color scheme combined with the stickers work really well i have seen people refer to the plane as being orange but its definitely yellow technic or lego in general tends to have some color variation when it comes to yellow i do concur this is the warmer variant of yellow but its not orange the back of the plane looks nice too although i am not a big fan of the rudder part it looks too detailed compared to the other panels its not a big deal though and maybe its just me parts left only three common parts left features and functions this set has a single feature and that is a retractable landing gear its operated by the black 12t double bevel gear near the cockpit in the following picture you can see the landing gear retracted this image shows the landing gear when the plane is ready for landing hopefully the pilot will roll the plane before landing but you probably know what i mean video heres s short video demonstrating the display team jet bmodel this set also includes the building instructions for the bmodel a stunt plane the building experience for the stunt plane is more or less the same as for the jet well what do you expect when both models are planes with a limited number of parts for an alternative model the stunt plane looks fine theres not a lot of functionality in this plane but its worth mentioning that the tail wheel allows the plane to roll on a flat surface the plane also has working propellors both functions are demonstrated in the video unfortunately the landing gear of the stunt plane is not retractable parts left a couple of extra leftover parts but its nice to see that most of the parts have been used in the bmodel as well actually theres probably an extra yellow technic smooth 12 bush left i just found it on my desk but it could belong to one of the other sets video heres a video demonstrating the stunt plane summary two nice planes for 13 bucks thats basically what you get both models look good and the set has some interesting new parts especially the 7l flex axle will be very popular it comes with a decent collection of white panel although they are very common nowadays both models have limited functionality but each of them has at least one function to give the model some playability for kids other than the swooshability that is okay it might lack some proper functions but i still think kids will love this set i can see kids running around with one of the planes in their hands all in all i think this set delivers what youd expect score lets see how this set flies remember that the grades are based on it being a small set obviously a set like this cannot be compared with a mercedes flagship 8 design for a small set the model looks very authentic 7 building experience no surprises 7 features just the retractable landing gear 8 playability it has swooshability so i see kids running around with this model 7 parts lots of panels if you are into that 8 value for money cant go wrong with these small sets 75 fun for kids more image can be found on my flickr page thank you for reading i hope you enjoyed it	positive
while i can see kids enjoying this im not sure i would buy the flex axles are nice and it is a decent number of white panels but i think i would get better return out of a larger parts set fantastic review though and your pictures show off this tiny model better than the box art does	negative
very nice little set and a lot of those new white small panels its a need	positive
love this model awesome swooshability interesting parts and a nice little model to put on my desk at work 	positive

megaroi on 01 december 2015  1056 am said hi there nice model great review i almost reverse engineered this model but used wrong parts for landing wheels didnt know how to fix the nose proper and so on so i was very interested in this model and i like playing with it i love the reviews but i think i have to mention that the yellow axle must be a 5l the picture shows a 5l and a 5l would fit the size of the model the cart has also a 5l in yellow what sitze is the yellow axle in this seit really 4l as written in the text greetings robert the picture of the manual says 4x 5l yellow axle and that seems to line up with what im seeing in the pics as well so i assume the 4l is a typo	neutral
i seem to have been messing up axle lengths in various reviews its indeed 5l my bad thanks for pointing it out	neutral
very nice review for a nice little set i especially like the smoothness of operation for the retractable landing gear i dont like the lack of symmetry for the propeller of the b model though but understand the alternative would be to add one extra small panel to the set or skip two of them in the b model	positive
nice review even with the missing demonstration video of the amodel looks like this is an excellent panel pack for the price and those soft axles will go down a treat will this set be the dark horse of 1h 2016	positive
i am definitely getting set for the panels	positive
jay psi on 02 december 2015  1210 am said nice review even with the missing demonstration video of the amodel hmmm strange let me fix that	neutral
fixed the video and fixed the stars in the voting thanks for paying attention guys	neutral
i just built the a model and i rather like it it is much bigger than it looks from the box  about 30 studs long there is only one function  the landing gear  but it works very nicely apart from that its a very solid build and achieves an elegant shape with an absolute minimum of parts i dont usually get excited about small sets but this one appeals to me i like the feeling that every single piece has a purpose	positive
my favourite of the 2016 sets ive built so far id go so far as to say this is the best budget set in years i would have loved this when i was a kid  great swoosh ability 	positive

i got this little set for xmas and i noticed all the gaps and decided to fix them so here it is img5344 by jj2sam on flickr first i added some beams to the wings and top to make it less hollow second i put some navigation lights on it i made the nose a bit wider and added a control panel and lastly i changed out the landing gear wheels to more appropriate ones img5349 by jj2sam on flickr more pictures are here	neutral
thats a cool little mod two small nigles though 1 your navigation lights are flipped on the main wings 2 the panels on the tail i think were supposed to be the intakes for the jet engine by using them to close up the tail youve turned it into a glider cant wait untill i find one of these on shelves	positive
so this set showed up in stores yesterday and i immediately picked two up all in all it is a nice set but it is slightly different from what i was expecting the plane feels a bit flat pointy nose wide bottom etc and while the panels work very well as wings it feels a bit simplistic to just have singlepart wings the stickers really work for it though its a cracking set though nice parts pack and a nice model as well	positive
got this at the weekend mainly for the parts but built it first agreed with other comments  awesome swooshability	positive
i almost purchased this today because i like the wheel  disc combo so much	positive
another great review jim and again i love the model those pearl gold wheels this one definitely goes on the buy on sight list	positive

theitalianbrick on 01 december 2015  0932 am said jim great reviews but can i suggest you one thing take some pics before you apply the stickersand some with the stickers on it helps to have a comparison you are right i came to the same conclusion when writing the review i tell you it doesnt look that good without stickers but i dont have a picture to prove it to be honest i compared it to the model posted in the 2016 topic a few days ago i applied the stickers before building the model so i wasnt able to make a proper comparison i will keep it in mind for future reviews thanks for the suggestion	neutral
cool glad you like em and thanks for the kind words	neutral

thanks for the review i wonder if the design inspiration came from the russian ka32 helicopter	positive
great review with high quality pictures well done im glad you took the time to do it properly cool that you have built both models i agree with the mudguards they sure look good on this model	positive
i was waiting especially for review of this set let me add few things about this thing it all will be complainging of person who works with these type of machines so if you just want a unusual machine in your collection ignore my complaining  i see underground loaders almost every day and believe me this model would now work in the underground mine first of all its cab should stick out more from the frame each loader has cab placed out of the chassis to provide better view for the driver in this class of machine it would help a bit but in low loader ones it is extremely important this is the view from the cab of a low profile loader looking at front  and yes front of the machine is where engine is placed because at least at kghm all machines drive engine forward another thing about that cab is that seat and steering wheeljoysticks are placed perpendicularly to the machine chassis to provide same view for driving forward and backwards so another weak spot of the set the model lacks of trans clear lights on the engine part because all machines that work underground have same lamps on front and back another thing that comes to my mind is that warning light and antena would not live too long in the mine becuase it could be torn apart by ramming into tunnels roofs it does resemble shape of underground machine but not a loader only machine that comes to my mind is something that are used for movingplacing hydraulic support jacks in tunnels sorry for poor quality i didnt find better picture of it it does have claw four wheels and articulated chassis but have much greater range of movement of the arm anyway id give it at least 35 for overall look model itself as a set looks unfinished or cut down on pieces after visit of an accountant for me it looks like engine part was built differently with knobs for steeringclaw operating sticking out from back claw needs almost seven full turns of the worm gear to close from opened position and is rather annoing to use it in way it is built in this model bracket that holds bevel gears responsible for steering is rather loose being hold in place by single 34 pin on the other hand the steering works very well it seems that lack of differential will be more common in lego sets becuase it is another model that have fake engine driven by single wheel like in old russian rc cars i am ok with that but it is a pitty that this model has only r2 engine thing that i do not like the most in this model is how the claw arm works first of all it barelly lifts the claw of the ground the movement could be much better and it has major design flaw  universal joints are not placed in line with articulation points and this is main reason of 5l axle not being suported on both sides under the turntable while rainsing the arm it bends a little i really would like to see this model built differently with normal bucket and better range of movement edited by mlonger 05 december 2015  1108 pm	negative
thanks for the thorough comments i agree that the set has some limitations both in construction and realism but i think theyre acceptable given the pricepoint and size the antenna is definitely ludicrous  i really do suspect they had a surplus of the swords to use up and yes the way the steering knob is mounted is loose i also noticed that the ujoints to the claw are not in the right spot like you mentioned but didnt include it since it still works fine that axle coming forward to the claw has a very long unsupported section that does bend a bit when you raise and lower the claw it works but is a bit of a cheat that im kinda surprised they let through i just checked and the bucket from 8043 is a couple studs too wide for this set im betting that was seriously considered but itd have meant scaling the whole thing up and that would have put it into a higher price point or they could have pulled the mold for the 8x14 bucket back out and remade it for this set i really like the model you built and thats interesting about the cabs being basically flush with the top but sticking out the side in image searching as part of my research i found both that style and ones like this with the cab sticking up more like the photo of the caterpillar one in my review i wonder if thats a useuropean difference or different types of mining or what because both styles definitely exist in the real world	neutral
great review thank you the set to me is kinda blah interested more in the new panels than the rest of it	neutral
great review and great pictures  many thanks for talking the time to review this set  i am a fan of lego technic construction stuff but this set is not so appealing to me but then again i am sure some people will love it	negative
great review one thing reaaaaaally bothers me about this set both models have the engine connected to one wheel the other wheel on the powered axle is just left to rotate freely and that really bothers me as it did in 42022 on 42022 even more tbh since its main feature is being a frigging car looking at the pics it isnt even a space issue as it was in the hot rod where they needed to route the steering through so they just cheaped out and didnt bother fitting a diff in there or even a live axle link im not very interested in this set not into construction stuff but i think this is a worrying trend 	negative
thanks for review mostlytechnic not a must have for me but this set have nice assortment of parts new turntable new panels i like yellow and if ill buy two of this sets  ill get enough wheels for proper 18wheeler and rubber connectors that i almost dont using at all but want to have more and more edited by victor imaginator 06 december 2015  0219 pm	positive

cool mod by effe but the original model out of the box is one of the poorest models tlg ever released looks from front to rear as a cheaped out set with really lazy design effort a shame for the responsible lego designer parts assortment seems to be ok but this should not be the most important criteria sry jim i really appreciate your always very well done reviews and offen i agree with the overall judgementsverdicts and of course tastes are different but especially that review sounds like gushing praise in my ears just my 2 ct edit ooops just saw the review isnt done by jimblush so sry jim now my final comment belongs to mostlytechnic edited by kumbbl 27 december 2015  0733 am	negative

lego 42045 technic hydroplane racer thanks to lego and eurobricks for making this review possible this was supposed to be a previewreview before the dec 1 release date for the set but it got stuck in customs or something and didnt arrive in time well id rather do a good late review than a rushed review so here it is name hydroplane racer set number 42045 pieces 180 price 1999 minifigs 0 theme technic year of release 2016 links bricklink brickset the box standard technic box action photo 2in1 logo inset of functions and the new try our app logo in the corner the box back more standard stuff with the bmodel and a larger app ad the contents 3 bags two manuals yes despite all the ads for their instructions app they included printed manuals for both the main and b models a big sticker sheet and two loose black beams the interesting parts theres a lot of panels in this set some are new colors the blue curved panel and the lshaped blue panels are a new mold i see them being used as mudguards on future sets or maybe even this year i havent looked at the other 2016 technic sets in detail yet the hose soft axle 7 long in black is new as well the normal 7 axle in yellow is a new color too and i have no idea why its in this set both models use it in invisible places so theres no reason other than making it easier to grab the right length axle to have it i assume other sets this year are using it but im not sure the manual and the dumbingdown continues now they have to show people to compare axle lengths to the 11 prints on the page that have always been there but how does the 11 work on the app might have to look into that for the record i pulled out my phone and tried to find the app in the google store couldnt find it so then i went to the lego website shown on the page and it had a link to it turns out it wasnt showing up because its tablet only so google wasnt showing it to me on my phone ill try again later with a tablet starting the build two technic standards a bunch of pieces linked together to make a specific pattern of holes and an engine block some weirdness this felt very weird to me  making the crankshaft for the engine they have you build it right to left i dont know if its because im a lefty or what but it felt awkward i need to look in some old manuals and see if its always been this way nope i randomly looked at 2013s set 42000 racer and it builds it left to right assembling the core heres the core of the racer upside down the engine block some gears at each end and a couple boat studs for smooth gliding and yes they cheated and those are only attached on two studs instead of all 4 im always amazed at how lego geometry keeps finding interesting ways that it works like here with those boat studs they fit perfectly into the bottom of the brick and against the beam the front end up front we get a standard blue seat with a couple hidden wheels behind it a boat doesnt typically have wheels but these will drive the mechanisms of this model so well let it slide an odd part choice here though  in the very front there are two tan axle pin without friction parts holding that 3 long liftarm on why theres no need in either model for the nonfriction pin and theres lots of the normal blue axle pins in the set so why include these two different pins and all done it looks like a huge jump here but its really not the front and rear connect to each other and then a bunch of big panels are added that make the model look way bigger the stickers on this set really make it work without them its pretty bland and boring so i recommend using them from the rear at the back we have a fan to propel the boat thats not so accurate all the images i can find of reallife boats use props in the water but since this is a nonfloating model we have to make some tweaks i guess there also should be fins going down into the water for stability and hydroplaning but again had to drop that heres an example of a real boat you can see they nailed the overall look quite well the underside for those that want to see the mechanicals heres the underside of the model minifig scale technic nope not quite a fig will fit the seat but sticks out of the cockpit and cant fit a helmet at all so close starting the b model again with the engine block but this time an opposing 4 instead of inline an odd part its rare for lego to include parts specific to the bmodel so i was curious when i found this 2axle with pin a fairly new part in the main model its used in a place that a normal 3 pin would have been fine and its the only one of these in the whole set so it obviously must be needed in the bmodel sure enough theres an assembly here that needs it the front of the boat more upsidedown building and that silver piston is basically only there as a spacer it has no real function yet it turns out later an axle goes into it so its a support for one end of the axle adding the wheels we keep building around the engine this model uses the same wheel setup as the main model taking shape the bmodel instructions tell you to put the stickers on in case you havent  they actually did a good job making the sticker work on either model but the silver piston used as a crossbrace is a bit weird it can spin so that axle hole on the side ends up facing whatever way it wants the back end the flex axles are used here under the panels just for appearance and to support the exhausts at the right angle same fan propulsion as the main model and just as wrong here  worse the gearing is switched in the main model the pistons and fan spin pretty quickly as you push the boat across the floor in this one they turn very slowly more instruction weirdness im always curious at how lego decides to do instructions heres how the panels on one side of the boat are assembled for the mirror image on the other side they tell you to put all 3 pins into the short panel as step 1 2 black and a blue add the white piece as step 2 and then add teh second panel and stickers as step 3 why two different ways all done heres a similar angle as most of the official images looks ok i noticed though how obvious the wheels are the back of the box image is a lower angle that hides them more and i like the mudguard panels as seats pretty clever from the side im not fond of the profile it doesnt sit level like i think it should the wheels are a stud too low sticking out of the bottom the underside like most bmodels there are compromises theres pins and axles sticking out but thats what you do when faced with a limited piece selection minifig scale yet nope not quite a bit too big this time i think the driver is supposed to sit in the seat with knees over the front of the guard where the grey pin is so the minifig is way too small spare pieces very few leftovers in this bmodel the conclusion so whats my conclusion on this model the bmodel is fairly meh and too similar to the main model however i love the hydroplane racer itself it looks great and is very swooshable for the price its surprisingly large thanks to the big panels on the sides yes this is one set that really needs the stickers to look good but they look great and are well worth putting on the ratings value 910  close to 10 cents a piece and a fairly large model for the price design 910  looks great other than the tiny fan on the back minifigs na  i was tempted to give a score since a minifig almost fits but thatd be cheating playability 810  not much functionality other than the engine and fan spinning but very swooshable and sturdy enough to be played with parts 910  a bunch of panels including some new ones just about every kind of technic pin and quite a few thin liftarms  overall 910  the set is a solid winner as long as your satisfied with the main model	positive
thanks for a great review too bad there is only one blue curved panel in this set my opinion on the frictionless axlepins is that the flex axle might be easier to stick in them than in regularblue axlepins didnt actually try it though  edited by majklspajkl 05 december 2015  1146 pm	negative

review  42038  arctic truck introduction arctic vehicles arent new to lego back in 2000 the town theme already had several small orange arctic vehicles in 2014 tlg again released a number of arctic sets in the city theme formerly known as town some of these sets are actually pretty big containing over 700 parts looking back in history it seems that arctic sets may have found their origin in the technic theme although these sets were white instead of orange they are unmistakenly arctic the 1986 technic arctic sets contained the infamous technic figures unfortunately the 2015 arctic truck doesnt contain any technic figures but nonetheless its great to see a new arctic vehicle in the technic line not counting several snow scooters lets see if the new arctic truck lives up to the

main model the lower left section shows the bmodel which looks very promising more on that later the lower right section shows the motorization options for the main model the crane partially and the bed can be motorized besides motorization some leds can be added as headlights the side on of the sides shows one of the newer smaller style panels this is the first time it appears in orange when you take a look at the sticker you can see that its not symmetrical not sure why tlg cut of one of the sides of the stickers since the position of the panel is very suitable for a continuous sticker content of the box the box is pretty densely packed which is better than semifilled boxes it feels like you actually bought something which matches the box size the box contains 2 booklets 1 sticker sheet 8 bags booklets  sticker sheet unfortunately the instructions and sticker sheet havent been packed with cardboard protection which results in a curved sticker sheet and slightly bent instructions in my case this wasnt so bad at least no real damage highlighted parts this set proves to be a great parts pack especially when you might have missed some of the 2014 sets black link treads usually the link treads come in dark blue grey but this sets includes 96 black treads which is great if youd like to replace the dbg ones in your mocs or other official sets undercarriage and suspension several parts are included to build the undercarriage driving the treads four large tread sprockets and eight small tread sprockets which are used as return sprockets also included are four steering portal hubs and four steering portal axles for driving and steering the vehicle several frames including two cshaped pivot frames and two steering ball joints to create an undercarriage much like the 4x4 crawler the set even includes two hshaped frames aka dog bone frames new changeover catch parts this year 2015 three new parts have been introduced to improve the changeover catch more on these parts later new pin connector another new part for this year 2015 is the 1l round pin connector which looks like a pin connector but acts more like a bush new pins furthermore this sets includes quite a large number of three relatively new parts 17 x pin with pin hole 14 x 3l pin with 1l axle and 11 x 3l pin with 2l axle which have been introduced this year 2015 when the new 3l pin with 1l axle was introduced in 2014 it was only a matter of time before the new 3l pin with 2l axle would appear both new pins are a great addition to the parts portfolio panels last but not least this sets contains a fair number of orange panels including the 3x11 panel in orange which is the first time weve seen this part part list below is the entire part list for the 913 parts as usual this part list can be found at the end of the second booklet the build the build immediately starts with some of the new parts used to build the compact gearbox in the center of the model notice the two 20 tooth bevel gears one would have been enough to drive the 12 tooth bevel gear so the second seems to be useless tlg probably used it in the amodel because they needed it in the bmodel which you can see later the front and rear suspension are almost identical the front side also has the 13l gear rack used for steering the picture below shows the steering rack on the front suspension in more detail at this point you have more or less finished the chassis the gearbox is in place and the majority of the functions has internally been connected to the right gears the small turntable shows where the crane will be attached later on at the end of the first booklet some of the bodywork has been attached to the chassis the orangeblack color scheme never fails to please me throw in some cool stickers for the extra effect and we have a winner if you decide to motorize the model using pf the top of the cabin can be lifted to accomodate the battery box the chassis uses lots of orange and some black panels to give the model its distinctive look the protective black bumberrailing is a nice addition which adds something to the exterior the dumping bed at the rear can tilt to empty its load its operated by a mini la the treads which look very cool in black are driven by a large tread sprocket and returned by two small tread sprockets the front and rear sections are identical building the undercarriages feels a bit repetitive which is a problem for most tracked vehicles finished model adding the crane to the model finishes the build your model should look something like this when you take a close look at the finished model you realize this is something else its trully a unique vehicle the color scheme is brilliant and the fact that its an arctic truck is really neat its a welcome change for the technic line to see a vehicle like this this picture emphasizes thats its a very cool vehicle imagine this beast plowing through the snow as far as i know its not based on a real life vehicle ifs probably a combination of several vehicles and some imagination i can be totally wrong though the rear of the vehicle shows the crane and drum placed on the tipper bed from this angle you can see some of the internals of the model the gearbox behind the cabin for example the crane can be partially motorized rotation and base while the boom is operated manually what i like a lot is the protective railing around the vehicle left over parts some leftover parts nothing noteworthy features and functions this set has several functionsfeatures steering driving suspension crane tipping bed steering as you can see in the image below the steering mechanism has quite a bit of negative caster please correct me if im wrong which causes the treads to rotate a bit upwarddownward instead of only to the left and right driving you mention driving as a feature yes i do and let me explain why normally i would ommit this as a feature and take driving for granted however driving this vehicle on a flat surface causes it to simply slide over the surface for other arctic vehicles this would be a plus but with a tracked vehicle it limits playability this is one of the main drawbacks of these tread they simple dont work properly on smooth surfaces suspension the suspension is working properly you do need to apply some pressure but all things considered its not too bad crane the crane has four degrees of freedom base rotation lower boom upper boom hook it does what its supposed to do base rotation and lower boom can be motorized and switched using the gearbox while the upper boom and hook are operated manually tipping bed the tipping is operated via a mini la conclusion while the set does offer various functions and features driving and steering is a serious issue therefor this set is more likely to be showcased than to be played with bmodel instructions for the bmodel are of high quality looking at the image below you will see what i mean heres the finished bmodel a tracked jeep with a communcations device this alternate model looks so good it could easily have made it as a main model one thing that does pop in mind how would this look with tires more on that later when you are in the artcic region its imperative to have proper communication channels since theres no internet backbone you will need a big antenna of some sort this bmodel actually features a small trailer wagon with a transmitterreceiver heres more detailed image of the bmodel without trailer wagon i would buy this model in a heartbeat if it were a main model simply gorgeous the side view doesnt give away that this in alternate model the stickers also work really well in this model and again nothing to complain here the model even has a small crane at the rear operated by the mini la here you can see the arctic fleet comprised of both the amodel and bmodel i bet these two can get some work done a bit of a messy picture but this should give you an impression of the size of both models leftover parts not too many parts left which is obviously a good thing alternate model with tumbler tires just like me you probably have been wondering how this model would look like with tumbler tires well here it is as i imagined it does look great admittedly these are not the type of tires we ought to use but to be honest i dont really care again the negative caster results in quirky steering the tires are a bit too big so they hit the chassis when you compress the suspension while this has absolutely nothing to do with an arctic vehicle i really love this picture summary were almost at the end of my review so what do i think of this set lets start with getting the elephant out of the room this set lacks proper driving and steering does that make it a bad set definitely not its a great set but it lacks some playability when it comes to moving the vehicle the crane and tipper bed do work properly so theres still some playability left does this set look cool definitely i think its one of the coolest no pun intended and most original models of recent years the orange and black color scheme works great and the stickers are well designed the bmodel is of very high quality and some might even prefer it over the amodel and if you are not interested in either of these models this set provides you with a variety of great parts all in all i think this is a great set maybe not to play with but it scores high on all other criteria pros original model great color scheme lots of interesting parts great bmodel cons steering and driving dont work too well repetitive build of undercarriages minor con score below are my scores based on different categories 8 design original and good looking model 7 building experience fun to build albeit a bit repetitive 8 features packs quite a few features 7 playability some features work some dont 9 parts comes with interesting parts 9 value for money two great model in a single set 8 cool as a bonus heres picture of the main model with tumbler tires why because we can	positive
very timely review jim my wife has just surprised me by giving me this set a few days ago and i have just built the a model two days ago and b model yesterday i agree with all that you wrote above i dont have tumbler tires but i have 9398 tires driving is smooth but steering  suspension will be bad as you said due to negative caster and tires hitting the chassis anyway tonight i will destroy the b model and rebuilt this httpwwwbusterhau8cmodelhtml	positive
i was supposed to publish it together with the 42039  24 hours racer but it somehow got backlogged after completing the reviews for the 2016 sets i felt i needed to finish it was already 90 done that cmodel looks cool	positive
the set is a looker youve got to admit it but what it gives in looks does not make up for what it lacks in functions i really wanted this set badly even when i restarted my adventure with technic about a month ago than i learned more and more about what a good model can do mostly thanks to this forum and yt right now im a bit disappointed with the arctic truck  smaller sets offer more functions and teach you much more jim it was a great review nevertheless edited by pgplay 14 december 2015  1122 am	negative

until i saw photos of this set i wasnt convinced i wanted it now after seeing all the combinations ab and tumbler tires i am definitely buying two copies i need orange parts and black treads anyway the only problem i have with this is that its going to encourage me to buy many copies of the drag racer just to get enough wheels to play with	positive

review  42001  mini offroader introduction technic mini models are sometimes regarded as models not worth buying i dont agree with this opinion whether its a special part or innovative building technique almost every mini model has something that makes the set worthwhile this time i will be reviewing the 42001 mini offroader this model is not a smaller version of an existing model so theres no real comparison with a bigger brother or sister if you will nor does the model resemble a real life brand or vehicle so it is what it is a mini offroader note all images can be clicked for hires versions set information number 42001 title mini offroader theme technic released 2013 part count 100 box weight 165 gr box dimensions 155 x 140 x 42 cm set price msrp 999 eur de  799 gbp  1299 usd price per part de 0100 eur  uk 0080 gbp  usa 0130 usd links brickset bricklink the box the box measures 155 x 140 x 42 cm which is obviously not very big the weight of the box is approximately 165 grams frontside the front of the box shows a though four wheel drive offroader challenging a fierce rocky mountain trailnow does it what the box actually shows is mini offroader challenging a small foam rock formation much like rocks used in star trek the original series yet smaller the box also states that this model is for the age of 7 till 14 more importantly the 2models in1 logo is clearly visible which means this set can be used to build two different models backside the backside shows a picture of the alternate model and a smaller version of the original model the conversion arrow and the 2in1 are printed to clarify that the main model can be converted into a secondary model sides one of the sides shows the 2in1 logo and a picture of the main model another side shows a picture of one of the wheels in actual size and again a picture of the main model contents of the box the box contains 2 booklets 2 bags 4 tires booklets this set contains two booklets which is not very common for a set this size both models share the same chassis which is why the build has been divided over two booklets one for the chassis 8 pages with 10 steps and one for the bodywork 34 pages with 23 steps for the main model and 20 steps for the alternate model bags the box contains only 2 bags which is to be expected from a set consisting of 100 parts one of the bags is filled with liftarms panels rims and two elastic bands the other bags contains all the other parts like pins axles connectors etc opening the bags results in the following collection of parts with the exception of the tires no abundant number parts that will add real value to your collection nevertheless there are some interesting orange parts and elastic bands tires the tires are provided seperately ie not contained in the bags from the picture you can see that these tires have a front and a back side so you should pay attention when fitting them to the rims which have two different sides as well highlighted parts this section describes the unique andor highlighted parts very small smooth technic panel 21 and 22 these two small technic were new at the time of release and this set was only one of two sets containing them in orange the other set is the 42007  moto cross bike at the moment of writing theres a third set containing these parts the black champion racer side a side b small rubber band i was under the impression that these white rubber bands werent that common but it seems that these bands are as common as dirt but hey you cant have enough rubber bands thin liftarm 1x5 with axle holes like the panels these liftarms were also new at the time of release looking at the the frequent usage in other sets this part has proven to be a most useful mammal thin liftarm 1x3 not a very rare piece per se but if you are not into bionicle this liftarm part can be hard to find your other option would be to buy the 9390  mini tow truck or the 8305  dual bikes from a while ago 2000 long pin with center pin hole this relatively new kid on the block is currently used in many technic and nontechnic sets and has well proven its worth axle pin connector hub with 2 axles like the previous part this newish part is also quite helpful in certain situations part list heres the complete list for all 100 parts building experience the build starts with the chassis of the offroader after connecting some liftarms two elastic bands one on each side are attached to the towball pins this is all there is to the suspension plain and simple the two elastic bands contract the lshaped liftarms which results in the long ends swiveling downwards the video below demonstrates the suspension the simplicity doesnt do it justice because it works like a charm the suspension is very smooth with the right amount of stretch and resistance this great working suspension adds a lot of value to this set to quote john hurt in the movie contact why build one when you can have two at twice the price i have purchased two sets so we can simultaneously see both models and make a proper comparison below you can see two identical chassis which will be used for both versions of the build at this stage we have arrived at the end of the first booklet which only took about ten minutes not surprising since the first booklet only has 10 building steps progressing to the second booklet you need to choose between building the main and alternative model thats a choice i dont need to make for this review so lets start with the main model main model when building the bodywork theres a rather peculiar building technique which you wouldnt expect in an official lego set the axle and pin connector hub with 2 axles only protrudes halfway into the double bent liftarm the thin 1x4 liftarm which is added in one of the following steps makes sure the hubs stay perfectly in place but i was still surprised to see this technique the finished bodywork for the main model looks likeuhhwelli dont know exactly it doesnt bear any resemblance to a real life model which makes it hard to judge one things for sure its not the best looking technic mini model the bodywork can be attached to the chassis by using a 7l axle and two bushes one on each side of the chassis alternate model unfortunately the alternate model doesnt look much better than the main model its even a stud less wide while you would like to see slightly more body matching the size of the tires and chassis attached to the chassis the body is even more out of proportion its not really ugly and the color scheme is great obviously this goes for the main model as well but the body simply doesnt match the chassis i can only imagine that this model is supposed to have a chibi look much like the microfighter star wars models comparison the following section shows a selection of images from different angles to compare the main and secondary model the main model has a bit more volume while the alternate model has a more sporty look front view the main model has headlights which are attached at a higher point while the alternate model has headlights which are placed more closely next to each other rear view a slightly different setup in both models where the main model again has higher placed rear lights side view the side view shows that the panels are used differently in both models the main models uses them as doors while the alternate model uses them as engine cover bonnet top view the top view reveals that the main model might have room for a minifig parts left the left image shows the parts which are left after building the main model while the second image shows the parts left after building the alternate model as you can see the main model uses slightly more parts than the alternate model features besides the awesome suspension which we already have discussed there arent a lot of features in this set theres actually a single feature which is only present in the main modelopening doors wow impressive well maybe we cant expect too much functionality in such a small model summary the offroader is a fun model which is fairly easy to build the suspension is simple yet very effective the model could do better in the design department but the suspension offers great playability and that is what this set is all about the orange parts are not very common so they are an added bonus all things considered this set is definitely worth the few bucks you need to spend on it pros great suspension fun to play with some semi rare orange parts great color scheme cons no resemblence to an actual offroader not the best looking model score below are my scores based on different categories 6 design not the best looking technic model 7 building experience the suspension makes it fun to build 7 features the suspension makes up for the lack of functionality 8 playability the model has carswooshability 7 parts some interesting orange parts 8 value for money great present for the younger builders 71 elastic hope you enjoyed it thanks for reading and please rate this set at the top of this topic	positive

a wonderful set and perhaps as close to classic space as possible y also theres a great amount of very useful and interesting parts too like these round stabilizer parts with clip  theres a complete different feeling with this new sets compared to the first mm ones 8 beside the a little more realistic aspects of it with the more enclosed cockpit nearly with some controls   its the overall more solid feeling i guess the other sets look pretty neat and fashionable at the surface but their internal structure is much more hollow and useless with some studless technic beams and such stuff very shining but hard and boring to mod just aimed for maximal cool looking box art and the rest went down for saving costs beside that already pretty good 7692 dropship that is the only thing i dont get with that is why the minirobots a onearmed one ach pirates on mars i suppose xd	positive

great review but am i the only one who thinks this is a pretty homely looking vehicle the small exploration robot is cool but the large windscreen on the main vehicle reminds me about jack stone i also think the bases of the vehicle parts are very basic and look almost unfinished with the holes and such i think i will pass this one even though the alien has a jet pack and there is the nice mini vehicle	negative
tks for the great review mm  its always appreciated to have reviews of new set having said that i really dont see the point of that set and its such money and time wasted imo i dont like that theme apart the dropship and 6wheeler and that tiny vehicle doesnt do the trick for me i see it as a really cheap excuse to try and please classic space fan with that horrendous mm graphics and what amazes me is that you guys loke that d money saved on  yoda	negative

during the annual thanksgiving road trip to the relatives i stopped by the tru in portland or lo and behold the new mars mission sets predictably i bought them i present to you the mx41 switch fighter man what a long name the box standard mm on the front it shows the fighter in flight mode and a yellow note telling you that it transforms the back shows three pictures showing it happen the parts once i open the box the first thing that comes out is a bent and rolled up instruction booklet and i was forced to put it under a stack of beer books for an hour then theres the dss yes two of the stickers do feature a cobra i wonder why because this sets decal should be a beatle xd decent parts nothing too special then i noticed this little part its used for the flickmissiles but i have no idea what else it would be used for  the build the alien ship when i looked at the box art for this set i was releived to see that the aliens dont have another curvedforward wing ship instead they have this little beauty which appears to be the alien mini cooper small and hot wub anyway partially completed even if you dont like the set it has some nice green flame peices which work nicely for space laser swords fully completed the only annoying bit about it is that the crystalholding thing in front wobbles all over the place the alien fits into it by way of impalement it must hurt getting in and out switch fighter cockpit the set makes good use of the alpha team cockpit for controls it has a meagre handlebar that the astronaught cant even reach the rear shell of the fighter starts out around the alien containment chamber its a bit odd that the containment chamber has an alien sticker because the instruction booklet lists it as holding crystals the crystal canister is held back by a technic pin this is without a doubt the ugliest color arrangment ever warning mass stickers x the cockpit fits into grooves in the shell then it clicks into place in a 1x1 brick with a horizontal clip the wing mechanism the wing for some reason the body of the mechanism has a blue brick wacko the wing and mechanism connect to prevent the fighter doing a nosedive while in tank mode the wing mechanism completed the underside the body and wing connect by way of a miscolored red brick i have no idea why its red black would bave been much much better completed tank mode all in all this looks pretty neat the wheel base is pretty short but its not bad transform the set transforms neatly if ungainly without antigrav support it would fall forward on its nose each time it transformed jet mode its all right but it could be a bit better the shell keeps slipping back forward to the tank mode because theres nothing to stop it sliding spare parts overall i thought this set was great it could do with some fixing such as the mismatched colors but it should be a definate buy for mm fans brickshelf gallery when available	positive
cool review im actually liking that new missile part as it seems to combine a bar with a pin but its a real eyesore if you ask me	positive
wub thanks for another great review sweet i am also glad that it is a very different alien fighter design as i already have three varients of the old type the fighter transforms better than i thought it would i was expecting just the wings i should be buying this set as well mr mandalorian on nov 26 2007 0345 pm said without antigrav support it would fall forward on its nose each time it transformed well since antigrav doesnt exist and will never exist there has to be another option looking at it in tank mode it does have a vague aerofoil shape so i think it should be able to work as a lifting body all it needs to do then is move fast enough to start taking off and then it can extend the wings 8	neutral
great review sinner on nov 26 2007 1222 am said well since antigrav doesnt exist and will never exist there has to be another option looking at it in tank mode it does have a vague aerofoil shape so i think it should be able to work as a lifting body all it needs to do then is move fast enough to start taking off and then it can extend the wings 8 this is clearly tlg officially supporting antigrav technologyi mean think about it how can it support itself without antigrav while transforming the answer it cant sweet p	neutral
hmm its actually a nice bit better than i expected and great review thanks but think ill pass on this one i quite like the alien fighter though heh and loved the way you described how he sat in the cockpit	negative
very cool review mr mandalorian this isnt a bad set the alien craft is very sleek if only theyd gone with the old alien body in transgreen and the transforming is alright the tank mode looks sweet sweet peace	positive
after seeing this set review it change my mind about this set by the way thanks for the great review	neutral
thanks for that very good review mr mandalorian y i think that this is a plain beautiful set oh how i wish that tlc wouldve taken that direction from the beginning  the design is much more practicable with fewer nonsystem parts and technic beams with studs this makes everything much more easier to mod and a lot more useful at least imo y so its for sure not very hard to make the wonderful enclosed cockpit one brick higher and even that little alien ship looks decent and nice xo and the fighter looks sleek and elegant too in both modes thats just very cool compliments tlc now all we needre aliens with moving arms and here we go classic space on forever xd	positive
thanks for a very thorough review i might think about getting this i really like the mini alien fighter and the transformation idea is always a welcome one both modes look pretty good despite the some of the odd coloured bricks which id mod out you know what it reminds me of some of the futuristic designs in the gerry anderson series	positive
wow this is actually quite a neat set it is definitively my favorite in the line after the big drilling unit begingeek im not sure it would nose dive when transforming from tank mode i guess it would pick up speed and transform quickly since it doesnt seem to have any downwards pointing thrusters endgeek	positive

hmmm i doubt ill be getting this set good review though	negative

and another tks and congrats mm on that review  like the oher post i think that this set is a wastre of time and money and shelfspace its such a ripp off from that ugly alfa team crapjet i do not like the design of the jet itself the small flags as front is so lame  and i dont like those orange wheels as engines  furthermore i dont like the rover mode either  the only cool thing about it is the special martian jet which they should ahve sold separatly p at least some interesting parts but that far from saving that set imo  money saved on once again p yoda	negative
john cleese on nov 25 2007 1056 pm said cool review im actually liking that new missile part as it seems to combine a bar with a pin but its a real eyesore if you ask me a needed solution to those blasted flick missles from falling out while swooshing sweet wonder if the range might have an issue seeing its held in there but who knows maybe they now pop out with a greater velocity than a mere finger flick i had resorted to technic 12 bushings smooth to lock in the missiles technic axle with stud	positive
great review mr m y i wub those green flames and the design of the ship is pretty good thanks for the review and great pictures they are clear big and describe the set just the way they should	positive
mr mandalorian on nov 26 2007 0929 pm said 1 thanks guys 2 i dont think that tank is very fast maybe if it drove off of a crater 1 there will always be kudos for a good review at eb  2 yeah it does look quite slow and tanklike it is a shame lego didnt make a more obvious way shoving what goes on brainbox on nov 26 2007 1015 pm said the one thing youd have to make sure of though is that it was fairly light and the wheel base had a fairly large surface area actually thats two things so as to make sure it didnt dig into the soil if that happened transformation would be harder as the wheels would dig into the ground and drag through the soil then itd nose dive you mean the ungainly way in which the wheels have to turn in order to change from tank mode i think you are right as well on the other hand if it has antigrav then it doesnt really make sense to have wheels as well i mean if the power goes then the wheels cant turn anyways	negative

awesome i cant wait to get my hands on this one	positive
sweeeet wub its nice to finally see a set thats not bipedal or  tripedal quote exoforce is an anomaly in my lego interests i dont know why i like it so much or why i keep buying it but i do that would be a problem wouldnt it p quote the cockpit itself is constructed very well but the canopy seems like an afterthought closing on to the robots head and leaving his back and sides completely exposed i dunno at least it has a canopy unlike past sets	positive
thanks for this fantastic review hinckley i cant wait to see the comic  i really love this mech as i am a fan of nonbipedal mechs though i am terrible at making them the purple is great and i cant wait to see what mocers will use those awesome new spike peices for 3 robots in one mech is a really good deal too and that spider droid just adds so much more to the set and thanks for taking the time to do this sweet not to sound like a smartypants though but the grill peice in purple is not the first time this has happened two were included in the 06 joker helicopter  thanks again to the brickmobile 	positive
awesome reveiw thanks for the pics did the instructions come with a comic	positive
thanks for that very neat review hinckley y this set looks indeed very interesting with a very cool antlike look and a simple but essential overall design the cockpit seems better protected than many other ef ones that spines lovely and the way these iron dronesre attached is simple but effective  and hey did i miss something orre there really no crappy shooting devices p thanks to the minirobots and their inventor i guess 	positive
great review y i am sure to get this set for parts now his legs dont look very poseable  thanks hinck vbbn	neutral
another fantastic review hinckley i really like this set i wasnt to keen on it when i first saw the pictures bit having seen the review i am starting to like it it seems quite sturdy and it makes a change from the usual 2 legged mechs as well as that purple is welcome anywhere i have such a shortage of that colour i like the rusty orange colour of the robots and their backjet packs are quite cool and the mini robot looks sweet	positive

from the lego store in chicago if i recall his post properly my goodness hink youre going to pull an allnighter for reviews at this rate oh well its kinda worth it right p	neutral
another great review hink looks like a great set quote the cockpit isnt sealed and is actually aggravatingly unrealistic as it leaves the drivers chest vulnerable to enemy fire actually the cockpit lacks any controls as seen here where it looks like keiken is simply pounding a counter demanding food d gimme food or else my friend up there willl shoot your punk  into mars well i guess that explains why there are no robot snipers in ef if there were well wouldnt be much of a story would there xd	positive
darnit hinckley  you always make us wait for the comic which is almost everyones favorite part   xd i just noticed ryos uniform had a camo pattern with all the orange he has its kinda pointless edited by lt veers 28 november 2007  0448 am	neutral
this designers were on a roll with this one until it came to the flying unit it looks like a shambles epecially the guns looking rather simplistic although they used something similar to the light and sound globe peice which is kind of neat i dont think ill be buying this but your review almost talked me into it	neutral
sinner on nov 28 2007 1253 am said how well do the tracks work the last tank was too light and it didnt roll well at all  its similar in weight but i didnt have to press down so hard to get the treads to move barely at all really i think the mobile defense tank although a better overall design suffered from the odd angle of the treads and that was mostly why the treads didnt turn well plus what was with those weird exhaust pipes anyway they are both cool tanks although i like the mobile defense tank better 	neutral
fantastic great review thanks a bunch for all the pics theyve shown me how in my opinion bad this set is p i just expected it to be more bricky rather than technicy oh well i wasnt planning on buying it anyway xd i noticed you spelt minifigs minifgis in the first paragraph in case you wanted to know xd so again thanks and im looking forward to seeing the rest of them and the comics peace	negative
thanks for this great review hinckley  i know youre loving this attention xd p i actually like this set and like it a lot more now that ive seen this review ill most likely get mostly for the figs and parts i reckon it would look a lot better alongside the rest of the 2008 ef mechs anyway thanks for the review to the brickmobile 	positive

thanks for that good review hinckley y a really interesting set and a turning point for lego minirobots instead of shooting crap pretty cool i hope the kidsll like it too for the design i love that asymmetrical look of the front part and the sleek guns of the flyer its smart that the gatling gun moves along with the tank too the set idea with two vehicles in ones not new but very play able and the treadsbig wheel designs cool i dont like the use of studless technic beams but well they do their job i guess and keikens cockpit should be easy to improve	positive
asuka on nov 28 2007 0241 pm said for the design i love that asymmetrical look of the front part and the sleek guns of the flyer the asymmetry reminds me of the wookie vehicles in starwars battlegrounds y and i see they changed back to the first color schemes for minifig suits which i think where better than the dark suits of 2007 except for hikarus wub  luxorv	neutral

here is my review of the set 6265 sabre island overview sabre island was release in 1990 an it contained 92 pieces and its retail price was 1550 it comes with 3 imperial blue coats and a nice outpost for them the pictures  full review anyway you can see here a picture of the box the model shown on the box differs from the actual model slightly and the back of the box which shows some nice alternative models from the pieces provided a close up of two or three of the alternative models and now for the minifigs i prefer the red coats over the blue coats but these minifigs are nice and for the number of pieces one gets a fair amount of them the set itself makes a nice small outpost it comes complete with a palm tree a cannon with ammo on a turntable a small tower a nice large imperial flag and a little red row boat here is a shot from ground level showing the cannon and blue coat patrolling the out post the rowing boat was a nice touch and it comes with a small flag too no pirates will avoid the wrath of myself and my mighty island the top of the tower is rather plain and simple which in some ways is good as it keeps the whole set detailed yet not crowded but i feel a little something should of been added to the top though the back is lacking any type of walls so one can play with the minifigs inside yet their are also no stairs or any other ways for the blue coats to climb up their tower either the rag tag pirates attack sabre island but never fear the lord of pies is here me throwing a pie at captain ironhook from another angle overall i think this is a very good if somewhat simple set and makes a great cheap imperial set comments thoughts and opinions are welcome and sorry about the darkness in some photos i have not had time to take photographs when it is till light recently for when i return home it is dark   edit fixed thank you edited by phred 12 april 2015  0514 am	positive

i gave this one a 5 its one of the little pirate sets i had during my youth and i loved it for several reasons first of all it contains 2 of my favorite minifigs it can be used as a small independent base or in combination with one of the bigger sets eldorado or trading posts as a lookup or outer defense besides all that this set just looks beautiful i love the colors blue baseplate and the whiteyellow tower one of the best littlemedium sized sets ever made by lego	positive

its a fantastic set cant think of anything wrong with it to be honest even if the island is a bit small the plate itself is still useful and the rest of it is also very useful walls can go toward a bigger fort cannon can extend your ship soldiers extend your army boat extends err your boats and the island prin is just cool	positive

picked up from the lego shop in bluewater yesterday front of box back of box price 250 gbp contents a very small instruction manual instructions front intsructions back 25 pieces 23 used in the model regular construction mini fig start of the assembly roll in the drum just attach the drum a little tap with the hammer hammer not included wheel it into position time to start mixing also time for a well earned tea break the cement is all ready now and the 2 left over bits extra cement is always useful and not really wasted overall a nice little set and i am pleased to see little sets appearing again at long last the only negative is with the drum of the mixer although the angle can be adjusted you cannot tip the contents out of the mixer all in all i would say 810 for a good little set comments   edit by hobbes replaced pictures with clickable thumbs and corrected set number	neutral
great review and nice touch putting the minifig in the mixer y and i think you are the first to review this set so all in all good work steel	positive
thanks for the review does anyone know if these mini sets are sold at tru	neutral
omg i absolutely love how you reviewed this set i think you are the only person ive ever seen on eurobrick with such a thorough review i read eurobricks daily and this really raises the bar in terms of how a person does a review please do not resize your pics they are perfect crisp large thorough and clear it gives anyone who really wants info on the set just about everything they need to know about it i had no idea they used that lil thing to have the cement mixer spin cool idea   nice set but perfect perfect review thanks much xd	positive
thanks for the review this looks like a nice set to have multiple copies of i think that you may have mistyped the setnumber as i was expecting this cute car when i read the title i wondered how you could see a cementmixer in this set p	neutral
heres all the parts in assorted baggies and the horribly messed up instructions four astronauts and four aliens with an extra gold visor yay not bad the base of the horribly unstable alien craft the wings move up and down aswell as back and forth the purpose i know not next we build the nerf section of the base basically technic and the rest of the tube connectors heres the farthest i got the little missle to go its fairly dissapointing good thing i didnt expect much from this portion of the set heres the start of the command base more of the main structure will be adding lots of things to all the little beams heres a storage container and the surprisingly not flimsy radar on this side we see the alien elevator it uses a horribly long technic rod i have not seen one of this proportion its like a foot and a half long more of the inner base where all the little tubes shall go all the connected tubes and such i also encountered a problem in the instructions it says for the end of the elevator prong to be touching the tube connector where it is shown here but mine has a 1x space inbetween no matter heres the completed base  my knee again onto the spaceship the bulk of it is just technic supporting beams with some large slope peices covering it all up more on that later the white coverup the middle section lifts up to store the overly large jetpack as you see the storage containers take up most the bulk in the back and you can see the jetpack on the ground aswell as the trigger hand hold thing that allows you to swoosh it look in the back lego greebles despite the large cockpit it only holds one person laying down the wings are really the saving grace  double layered with a nice two toned effect kitty nudged me this picture so its abit blurry my apologies  extra peices and or peices i have no idea where the hell they go p overall the set is quite fun i must admit full price i probably would not go for it but i got it for just under 70 dollars for that price i can confidently say its quite worth it many useful peices nice figures other than the aliens and the tube things are quite fun to boot even though i liked the life on mars system more which i also have none the less its very fun to make them shoot around alright so its not much of a command base either and it looks abit bare but its still fun even if you ignore the nerf section overall i give it a hardy 35 out of 5 the openness and epic fail of a missile launcher are hard to get by but overall its a dandy set d merry christmas wub	positive
thanks for the review brickmaster i wanted this set at first but i realized i dont want it as much anymore seems like a waste of 90 	negative

i dont recall mine having an alignment problem on the tubes could you perhaps take a closer picture of the area did yours also have two of the same sticker for the wings of the alien craft	neutral
thanks for this review lots of minifigs is a plus although half of them are junk jellies but dang the base just doesnt seem impressive it looks so cheap like a skeleton the tubes are just ridiculous but hey at least it comes with two cool spacecraft thats nice	positive
i agree it does seem very scarce but ive taken apart the nerf launcher made a new module with the tube the launcher used and beefed up the base with some computers and other things for 90 dollars i would pass i agree on sale it is lovely though and none the less ive been entertained for ages with them flyin through the tubes d	neutral
thanks for the photos and review brickmaster im hoping to find this on sale as well no luck so far i love the white ship and i think the base would be amusing but ultimately hard to reuse incidentally that long axel is common in recent technic sets but i think it was orignally made for the hockey sets d	positive

so here it is the long expected  review of the town plan i bought it at the legostore riem arcaden last saturday i paid 14999 eur for 1981 pieces this set is separated in 4 parts 1 the servicegasstation 2 the cars the petrol pump and the fountain 3 the cinema 4 the town hall the service station has a lot of really nice details like tools for the car repair or the table with the cashpoint and the foodstation theres a croissant a banana and a apple in this set one of my favourit parts is the trolley with some tools you can see it at brickshelf at the second part are only a few pieces and i needed not much time to built the 2 cars the fountain and the petrol pump theres something at the truck i dont understand maybe i did something wrong but the truck has no backlights wacko i like the petrol pump thats why i post a pic of it the cinema is the highlight for me it has also really nice details like the popcorn table or the gumball or candy machine the colours sheme is really nice the front of the building with the big displays is a cool idea overall a really nice building the town hall has also a really nice colour sheme i love that dark green mixed with the white stairs a lot of plants around and in the town hall as you can see some figs who married there not more to say about this building see the pics and enjoy it overall this set is a must have it was really fun to built it this set reminds me of the back to the future movie with michael j fox the whole gallery is at brickshelf there you can find a few more pics i hope you enjoyed this review regards sandra	positive

sorry for answering so late but i was very busy thanks guys for your comments y tedbeard on dec 28 2007 0808 pm said sorry to disagree with anyone however but this was not a great review i appreciate the effort sandra made but a great review would include more details such as what are stickers and what are printed pieces a great review points out flaws or limitations as well as what works or is really neat a great review would have analyzed the price per piece and compared that to other setsthemes one might look at the recent reviews of the indy sets or the new spongebob sets as examples of really good reviews the pictures are good but a great review above all should provide the reader with some new information perhaps even answer questions posed in the prerelease discussion thread i learned nothing new about the set from this review that said it was a good review for someone who had not seen the prerelease discussion and she did a good job of showing said person what they could expect in the set its good that you told me your opinion about my review it was my third review i made and i have to say that i made this review not for analyses just only to show the eb members some nice pics and to tell them my opinion lego is fun for me i dont like to analyse the pieces bricks prices colours i just want to build something thats why im at eurobricks and not at an other big legocommunity in germany lego is fun fun fun and everybody knows that lego is a expensive hobbie so why should i write it again and again julencin2000 on dec 29 2007 1007 pm said very good review thanks sticker sheet pic with 1 megapixel film posters thanks for the link julencin  xwingyoda on dec 29 2007 1025 pm said ps  tedbeard  do tone it down youg man  if youre not happy with sandras work do provide one yourself instead of bitching on how you view a review and on how sandras post is veryt far from one according to you  yoda thanks yoda sweet copmike on dec 30 2007 0130 pm said thanks for the review legocastlegirl  excellent work y i agree with you the best part seems to be the movietheater thats perfect because i just love to watch movies in the theater so far this year ive seen 46 pictures and had some popcorn to  this is a mustgetset town on copmike thanks copmike  so it will be a good year 2008 for you therell be a lot of good movies at cinema next year i cant wait for national treasure book of secrets the second movie after national treasure with nicolas cage	positive

xwingyoda on dec 29 2007 0125 pm said ps  tedbeard  do tone it down youg man  if youre not happy with sandras work do provide one yourself instead of bitching on how you view a review and on how sandras post is veryt far from one according to you  wow i have not been called a youg man by which i assume you mean young for a while as a forty year old with three kids thats unusual sweet i tried very hard to remain positive in my critique and complimented her on those things she had done well i felt that given the somewhat juvenile omg bestreviewever tone that was creeping in amongst the replys that it needed to be tempered with some thoughtful suggestions as to how a good review could be made great your ad hominem approach is offensive and far more negative than i was and to suggest i should do my own review is ridiculous i live in canada and we do not even have the set available here yet thus i am interested in seeing reviews of this set if i already had the set i would not be so interested and next time you propose to critique a critique perhaps you should actually read what i wrote i said she wrote a good review for a specific audience i did not say it was awful or whatever you seem to have assumed i meant saying something is good but could be improved can hardly be characterized as bitching 	positive
thanks for the review i really want this set because 1 it looks fantastic 2 has harder to find colors 3 is a 50th anniversary commemorative 4 some of the models are based on the 50s sets i love the old stuff the tanker truck is a perfect recreation of the old ho 187 scale esso tanker truck i have one and you can look at it for comparison if you would like lego ho vehicles id like to modify the truck from this new set to look even more like the old esso truck getting rid of the green and adding some decals	positive
happy new year everyone i went to my local walmart looking for an exclusive bionicle set yesterday but was amazed to find everything there sw bionicle ef indie the works i nabbed the jsf and the rogue shadow and scampered home to take pics with my new camera wub the box the same as the other 07 boxes nothing new the back shows the various features with pop out r2  luckily the intruction booklet and the dss were intact not folded like the last mm set i got  the dss not too bad but printed parts would have been great the figs anakin is amazing imo wub fits the cw anie great i noticed on the sh reviews the kiddies were saying how ugly he looked  they need to see the cw cartoon for the sake of my health i should probably stop reading those d the build i wont go too indepth on the build since vader posted a very indepth review here the start of the build the body of the fighter starts out long and skinny the jsfs landing gear allows it to sit comfortably without getting in the way while swooshing r2d2s launching device r2 in position when launched he often gets stuck if you dont press the button hard enough  looks like r2 needs to lay off whatever it is robots eat so far the flag stickered its a big sucker sticker completed i forgot to add the nose stickers before i took the pic warning the nose cone sticker is actually two stickers i thought it was one peeled of one of the stickers and put it on the middle of the two 1x8 plates and didnt notice the other sticker wacko various completed shots i think this was a beautiful little set r2s launching unit and the flick missiles are annoying but easily fixed i plan to add proper cannons in place of the flick missiles anakin is a great minifig but he doesnt look so well standing next to my other figs the brickshelf gallery when public will	positive

wow im surprised no one had done this already first off this is a truly lovely set that many people should own even though its sold out on the sh   now lets start off with an overview note i was missing a few of the pieces the rabbit the trike when i toke the pics the figs and a cat the engine i really love this thing its a beautiful 060 steam engine with a tender this is probably the most detailed steam engine lego has given us i loved it so much i made a nonholiday version for my town the flat cars i like these but they seem a bit simple their cargo is good for christmas or a birthday party the passenger car it resembles the green passenger car we got a while back but i like the interior in this one a bit better the caboose a simple caboose like the one from 2001 the sad thing about it is thats there is no interior and its hard to take the roof off overall i like this set but it is kind of hard to use during the non winter months the price is kind of good but with that price it should have came with the motor i give it a 910 happy new year edited by agentrick57 04 january 2008  1200 am	positive

okie guys and gals here s time for some droid exploration with my review of set 7670 as a general statement i have to say its really a neat set that is not that expensive for what it holds 1 box art like always i will start with pics of the box art btw notice anything guys  no bloody crappy dss yes finally a set without stickers and that feels great d 2 the mfs nothing really spectacular there the only novelty lies within the inclusion of the new commander yellow torso bd apart from that there are 2 bds and unfortunately yet another sbd i like those but i have a huge amount of them and i would rather had something different you have 3 short blasters and a couple of extra parts 3 the spider droid i think its a pretty cool little buggar its a rather simple yet classic construction i think it has sweet parts such as the bd body in dark bley it really has a spider feel unlike the previous ep3 one 4 the hailfire droid this baby represents the pice de resistance of this set i truly love it  sure its a bit under scale but i dont really mind that its conception is superb even if i totally dislike assembling those technic treads especially 80 of those small things the ellipse of the treads is well balanced and that trans disc is a brilliant idea the great thing is those new flick fire missiles they dont fall unlike the other ones and they do look good on this baby also you can put the wheels together and the missiles to gain some shelf space easy storage on d  in conclusion those druids re really sweet and are perfect target practice for the upcoming rgs hehe  i hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any  yoda	positive

nive review of it yoda but i was going to do a review of it but now i see this i dont want to do it anymore  next time try to do it with action it is rare that people do that they only do it with the set and not further 	neutral
nice review thanks it still seems overpriced to me though also the box shows the droid torsos that are used for feet on the spider droid as being light bley yet they are clearly dark bley wacko tk	negative

great review mate as usual for me the highlight of this set has to be the new spider droid even though its made up of some strange parts it really appeals to me i would love a few of those babys the hellfire droid is also well put together even if it is a little small but hey it looks fun i really like the look of this set but the price tag really puts me off why oh why did lego price it so high 	neutral
great review very precise as for the spider droid construction i have already worked it into a moc httpwwwbrickshelrycgif290980 strykersingle gun hydraseven guns hammermissile pods steel	neutral

great review as weve come to expect from yoda y nice to see that tlg is finding new and interesting ways to get around the no minifig only sets restrictions with hasbro clearly this is another army builder with a minimal vehicle as were becoming accustomed to heck even the diminutive hailfire is technically a droid as well thus making this all minifigs from a certain point of view only negative it is a bit overpriced ill have a better feel for that when i get one treadslinks always drive up a price so it might just be fair the spiderdroid is a winner even with the unusual parts assortment i like it when lego thinks of different ways to use things i think it promotes the same from us im not sure what i think of the new battledroid commanders but at least i can make extras easily if i need to as i bought a bunch of yellow droid bodies off bricklink once thinking i might want to make some kind of new droid out of them they were cheap at the time now i expect the price to go up just because of this potential use between those and the grey ones its good to see more becoming available hopefully well see black and a few other colours produced for some nice customizing possibilities all in all a nice little set with a great army building potential especially on a buyonegetonehalfoff or better type of sale until then ill grab one or two and be glad to have them	positive
i got this set for a few months 1 or 2 and i agree that it is small but still it looks great on plates clone troopers just for fun 	positive
i got this and a couple of other sets on mondayand to tell you the truth i was a bit dissapointedi like the set i like the parts but its definitly not worth its rrp of 45 nzd if you ask me i should be more like 35 nzd but hey i still like it i got it for 30 on ebay so im not complaining y y	negative
ah i finally got the 2 city sets i really wanted  i am so happy that lego went postal on us p  since they are rather small i shall do a mix review of these 2 sweet sweet sets 1 mail van 7731 like always ill start with shots of the box art and bloody dss now here are the extras of that set i really love the new torso of the postal worker my huge grip lies on the mail box that mail logo is a freaking sticker  for that part i was so expecting a printed part that is really really bad  apart from that the design is pretty cool the van is quite simple but i think its pretty cute i love the fact that the rear is a window 2 air mail 7732 like always ill start with shots of the box art and bloody dss the extras are ok another great postal worker you also have yet another red trolley with a package that is a bloody sticker yet again  g tlc should have more printed parts  that plane for me is a classic thing of beauty  really is consistent with the fantastic planes of the 80s thats the kind of lanes tlc should produce instead of those huge playmo planes actually i am happy that tlc released that one  for once its not a bloody airline exclusive promo set  here are general pics i love the engines of the plane simple yet superb also the top hatch opens to insert mail and packages the front control panel is a printed part  i love the classic double train windows and here is a poc of the undeneath of the set in conclusion i truly love these small sets they are the perfect size 4 wide car yeay  and the colour pattern is amazing as well i hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any  yoda	positive
i havent spotted these in the us yet im looking forward to finding them overall the 2008 lineup is a excellent and its going to be difficult for me to decide which themessets to pursue theres a lot to choose from	positive
thanks for the great review yoda  im definitely going to get that plane ive sadly only owned one of the many lego planes there is  thebrickster on jan 5 2008 1123 am said i havent spotted these in the us yet im looking forward to finding them overall the 2008 lineup is a excellent and its going to be difficult for me to decide which themessets to pursue theres a lot to choose from really where do you live	positive
thanks for the takes on these two sets yoda stickers or not i still think these are charming sets with all the essence and nostalgia of the older sets back in the 8090s am i the first one to notice the new doors used in the back of the van not only is it using the popular new frame but the old container doors have been redesigned to fit with the new frame as well pity theyre not yellow though	positive
very nice cheers yoda ill definitely be getting the post van not sure about the plane though both are awesome but i think i have enough planes can you tell me though the wheels on the van are they rubber or plastic they look a bit tacky	positive
these little sets are really nice they cought my eye the minute i saw them it would have been so great if there was a post office to go with them there are so few buildings in lego city the design is very classic and i am ofcourse considering to get them but it seems that i have a lot of small cars and planes on my desk  recently i took a flight with cyprus airways from thessaloniki to cyprus and the two promo plane sets were there i was so tired though that i couldnt stay awake to buy them im taking a flight again on tuesday and i hope they are not out of stock thanks for a great review yoda a fine job as always cant wait for your next one	positive
thank you for the nice review pity of the stickers but the design is nice 80ies on	positive
great review yoda i find myself saying that line alot d  i love these two little sets wub tlc continues the great city line that started in 07 and continues into 08 its also nice to have other sub lines besides fire and police  p i hope there are many more postal sets like a post officethat would be sweet hope these are mainstream and not those damn exclusives  postal on p	positive
thanks for the review i was always going to get these two sets so you havent swayed me at all xd i reckon lego could enhance this subtheme by releasing a post motorbike with or without a sidecar and post office obviouly the office would be the hub of all the activity while the post bike would take care of the postal run this would free up the van to take or recieve bulk mail or parcels to or from the airport it could then also do the parcel deliveries around the city the office would also serve as the reciever for all the parcels the new goods truck might deliver just some thoughts thats all sweet	neutral
loool  spielberg goes on a career change d these are some nice sets i really love that car looks sleek	positive
thanks for a nice review and few comments to sets nice airplane finally some reminiscence for lego city golden era for me years 19821992 everything is nice but two things are freezing a smile on my face first of all the ugly new hinge used for plane roof i have already 4032 and those new hinges are looking really terrible when compared fe with 6368 second one is new minifig i dont know what i expected but this torso design looks too simple and too cheap concerning new car  i appreciate fact that tlc makes after long long years again postal sets but i dont like those newstyle cars matchbox wheels and bad rate between drivers cockpit and cargo space are damping me from buying 6651 mail truck or 105 canada post truck were much better edited by kanalk1 06 january 2008  0733 pm	positive
while the plane does look nice i dont particularly care for the van but the van does have some good parts which is the only reason i would by one yellow mud guards the new windshield and the small door on the rear	neutral
im glad to see the mail van has the doors that used to be on the older cargo containers i had given up on those older ones but now that theyre still out there i may invest in the older cargo system instead of the new 6wide ones both sets are good enough ill get both im hoping for a postal building too even though i have the smaller of the old post offices a nice big modern one would be great im not too hung up about the design of the plane ive got the neat old cargo plane with the tail that swings open one of the best plane sets for big packages the truck is goofy looking but if i get sick of looking at it i can rebuild it into a classic looking one great review by the way the pictures are some of the better one ive seen in a review recently	neutral
thanks yoda for the great reviews i love the airplane its really cute the van needed to grow on me though but you did the trick i dont like the wheels of the van they will need replacing and wouldnt everything have been better if they were completely red dr brick	neutral
hey everyone my first 2008 set is this one 5613 i thought id share a review of it sweet id like to say sorry about my photos they were taken quickly first we have the box it is the smallest lego box ive ever seen and actually looks cute wub it will be heavy competition with playmobils specials back of the box showing an action pose the contents of the little box with a very tiny instruction manual wub the manual unfolded notice that every part has its part number beside it  the back of the manual showing some fire sets and the other impulse sets the parts 30 in total the small set built the firefighter has a small fire to extinquish armed with an axe chainsaw other saw and foam psssh thing xd  five extra parts in a 30 part set we get an extra black hatchet yellow bar tap light bley 11 plate red 11 plate modified with fingers and 22 dark bley radar dish besides the plate ive never seen these as reserve parts but im not complaining xd here is a small alternate model i created with it a small bbq what hes hungry and he needs to put something on the bbq  xd overall you cant go wrong with these impulse sets i paid 289 euros for this little set so thats a great value sadly the only impulse avaible were these 3 city sets no police and the alien mars mission looking forward to the knight and magician as well as those indy sets tt	positive

love this set now more than ever wub i knew i wanted it from the first leaked boxshots especially with my love of yellow buildings just ask hinckley   great review especially nice to see the closeup parts shots those new 2x2 white windows are very much like replacements for the classic 2x2 windows tlg stopped regularly making a while back so its great to see them the wheels are trolley wheels common in sets including stretchers and handcarts the holder for them is a fairly recent part i think i remember a couple coming in a little single minifig jet engine repair set i picked up in a sh order within the last year oh honey be sure to wrench that chicken before it burns wacko thanks for another excellent review of a set im even more excited about than before y	positive

thanks for the review dunamis this is a great little set im also very impressed with takuto20s mods ive been trying a few of my own i liked the tower block design but a lot of stuff needed fixing firstly i added a 4th wall and made it so the storeys could be lifted off like in the other models i also added flowers on the windowsills and doorways out on to the balconies still to be added is an extra door for the top floor which im going to get from the new doors and windows pack i added a chimney that goes all the way up the back of the house and has a fireplace on every level each floor is fully furnished with a fireplace wash basin and bed on the upper levels and a corner sofa and coffee table plus an extra large fireplace on the ground floor finally here is my idea of what to do with two copies of this set all the parts pictured are from 2x 4996 except 5 extra fence panels and the minifigs the house on the left has its garden at the rear	positive

hello and welcome to another redman set review well actually the first redman set review im your host redman and today i adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the impulse set simply titled the knight this is a great set with 14 pieces 2 of which are spare and a minifig with 2 weapons 2 helmets and some shiny armour all this is packaged in a tiny box just short of 10 cm or 3 inches with a neat little instruction manual that folds up to the size of the weapons rack included in the set as you can see this set only costs a measly 7 nzd disclaimer redman not included here we see the box clearly showing what the box holds on the top we see a 11 scale picture of a minifig for those new to lego or who have forgotten how big a minifig is i guess  xd the instruction manual showing the nice and easy built with me for size comparison d sorry about the dark image i had to lean over the light to get a birds eye pic  here we see the 2 different soldiers you can make with the set a knight and a guard or standard troop or soldier or whatever you want to call him note each set comes with only 1 minifigure and additional accessories of course you know im in the picture just for the sake of it im not really one of the soldiers xd the neat little weapons rack or rather equipment rack as it holds not only a weapon but a shield except the ovoid ones helmet and armour nice and easy storage so your equipment wont get dirty lying around on the ground d one of the spare parts is another of those robot hands so you can stick that in place of the shield and allow the rack to hold 2 weapons just thought youd like to know that  and here we see the nifty little structure of the thing it can even support a whole minifig note the grey stud on the bottom bar is a spare part i just find it better used there to hold the armour  huh i dont remember this picture 8 it appears i drifted off and these guys dont look too happy i overtook their weapons equipment rack  i should go xd so in conclusion this is a great set for army building at a reasonable price with nice equipment and it can be picked up as a little extra with your normal shopping xd thats all for today folks sweet redman so what do you think should i continue with these redman reviews  p or just stop now xd comments and criticism welcome  peace	positive

thanks everyone for your positive feedback its really appreciated d youd be surprised how long that redman presents thing up the top took me to make xd so it appears people do like redman expect him to be reviewing the good wizard and battle arachnoid in near future i know those have already been reviewed but new zealand never gets sets first so ill just be reviewing the sets i get xd thefrisian on jan 19 2008 0444 am said nice review very detailed y as for the spare parts mine didnt come with any both dark grey 1x1 round plates are used on the weapons rack one for the armour one for the helmet and i only got one robot hand for holding weapons thats strange maybe im just lucky xd i also got 2 spare orange viking horn pieces in my battle arachnoid d peace	positive

well today i finally got my hands on set 7038 now since the moment i first saw pics of this set i knew it was for me so lets start with the new troll helmet and torso these are both great this troll really stands out as a leader when next to the usual trolls in the dwarf mining set ok so heres a few shots of the front of the set now one thing i really like about this set is the way that lego have placed the back wheels higher than the front this allows the set to really appear to being pulled here we have a shot at the missiles on the wagon these are better than some around i have to say if you look just behind the bottom missile you will see a simple firing device simply push it down and then let it go to see those missiles fire the troll flag is moved behind the missiles for firing one thing that does bother me about this set is the lack of anything on the rear ok its easy to fix with a little mocing so its not the end of the world but i would of liked something placed there now lets move on to the crownies wagon this is simple yet good for holding weapons as for the crown knights themselves well there the ones from the impulse sets which is great imo heres a few quick shots of the 2 larger trolls we have so far i prefer the sand green one what about you well thats the end for now requests for pics and comments are welcome overall i rate this set as a must for anyone whos a fantasy castle fan i know ill be getting more of this set as for the new wagon well its joined up with the other trolls i do hope the impules crownies i bought today can handle them oh and yes i did change the knights heads xd  fantasy war on vader	positive
awesome review i like the turkey leg hanging in front of the troll xd yea the back looks a littleempty 8 well overall i enjoyed the review see ya soon	positive
seems like a good set should i get it btw how did you get you hands on this	neutral
nice review sweet this is a must buy for me since i wub the new sand green giant troll now i just have to wait until its available in the us  general tarful	positive
thanks for this excellent review vader it seems you are succumbing to the castle side of the force i love the new helmet and the new orc torso is fantastic as well which is great to see that the troll faction has many ranks too the troll himself i love i agree with you in saying i prefer the sand green version the battle wagon is cool one of the better wagon designs and the flag is a great touch which improves it sadly the back is rather empty but a few modsll change that  and of course this set includes the infamous chicken pole one pic request if you have time vader could you please post a few pics of the new helmet on its own and on a human soldier please batbrick is back 	positive
thanks for the review vader the first picture of the troll is great the gold armour really shines xd a fantastic set ill definitely get a couple of these wub as for the ogresgiant trolls the dark tan one fits in the mine setting well but for above ground settings i prefer the sand green one y peace edited by iamded 19 january 2008  1021 am	positive
some people say they like the shadow knight helmet better but this one is way better	positive
thanks for that vader i love this helmet wub it will certainly work great as an asian dynasty war helm i reckon thanks again batbrick is back 	positive
this is fantastic i love the new helmets for the goblins sweet ive always loved the chicken leg thing really screams lego to me at least how lego used to be  great little bit the goblins are awesome too and the sand green one should look good next to the tan onesgives a nice feeling of a real species in reality not all members of a species are identical its great seeing them in different colors great review xd	positive
thanks for the review i love this set its a cheap way to get green trolls and i love the new helmet it looks great and i think it will be very usefull for other factions as well sweet dnl	positive
a troll driven by a turkey leg what a wonderful little detail d d thanks for the review vader very clever using a flag to hide that crazy firing device i find it rather odd they used blue pins for this black or gray wouldve been alot more discrete about the big trolls i think using different colours is good i dont think a troll force would be very organized so different colours would make the effect complete y  as for your troops looks quite fearsome definitely compared to my pathetic number of soldiers  a nice set but i would rather get the attack on tower though no matter about the price difference	negative

xwingyoda on jan 22 2008 0426 pm said tks for the review mate  now i have to bloody wait long because lego france has this line available in freaking march  pissed yoda on  d i love the new goblin p that helmet is really cool why on earth tlc didnt include that one in the dwarf mine  such another idiotic move  anyone keeping track of tlcs stupidity lately  that would be interesting  i clearly want a huge goblin army now hehe  and i totally agree with you mate the troll lokks better in sand green the cart itself is pretty lame imo  just a sordid excuse to include yet another annoying shooting crappy device but for a 21 set its okie i say  need my bad guys on  yoda i believe there is a topic around here somewhere based on bad lego ideas after getting this new helmet i really wish lego had included it with the mining set its bloody annoying having to buy yet more of them from bl  the shooting bit is better than some sets that have had one at least this one is smartly done and of course it can also be hidden	neutral
thanks for the review of a set i would otherwise probably have passed on out of curiosity how did you know it was for you you seem to be building quite a collection why castle now was the fantasy element all it took just curious thanks again and god bless nathan	neutral
lego city truck  forklift set  7733 pieces 343 price 2499 usd store of purchase toys rus release date january 2008 after discussion of the mysterious yellow cargo contained in this new city transport set and a visit to my local tru i purchased this set i was immediately pleased with the pricepiece which i think is pretty reasonable 343 pieces for 25 starting with the box great city artwork boasting special edition tha backside of the box no alternate models comes as no surprise the dreaded decals i was looking for the skull and bones for radioactive but no such luck my favorite part of the set a very clever forklift side view and the backside what i like about the forklift is the bars across the top giving the vehicle a reallife design the double wheels in the front with two pieces that can hold the wheels also adds to a clever design i like the figs although not much new  perhaps ill make the driver into a werewolf later the set includes three cargo pallets the first some sort of fuel with gauge the 2nd two indy containers and a square 2x4 brick i have not put the decals on yet and the mysterious yellow cargo your guess is as good as mine   on to the truck the front section the front grill another angle the back i like the opening mechanism that is very simple but works well also is the large plate tile piece inside i like this because the entire interior has no studs and the trailer section of the truck orange and yellow tail lights and the rear trailer open the complete set summary this is a neat set that reminds me a bit of classic lego city but larger it is very playable and has a lot of accessories adding to the value the build was very simple and enjoyable took me about an hour it is a great addition to a number of city sets including the cargo ship container stacker the world city cargo train and the new cargo plane as i mentioned previously i have not yet put on the decals that im sure will really add to the overall look of the set the forklift is awesome and i like the cargo containers the truck could have benefited from a few additional details chrome smokers and an undercarriage box that really opens considering everything i would buy this set again hope you enjoy and perhaps this mysterious cargo will make its way into a brickster mystery y	positive
question whats different with this special edition btw nice shots	neutral
general kannon on jan 19 2008 0510 am said im guessing the main difference is the fact that the box says special edition its either that or its a toysrus exclusive set as my armoured drilling unit box also had special edition on it	neutral

some guy on jan 19 2008 1117 pm said i think the special edition is just for making people intrested and make them want to buy that set or something hmm thats a thought but why would they pick this particular set i would expect theyd do that with a slightly bigger set like the heavy hauler perhaps why do you think theyde pick this one	neutral
mr tiber on jan 19 2008 0246 pm said hmm thats a thought but why would they pick this particular set i would expect theyd do that with a slightly bigger set like the heavy hauler perhaps why do you think theyde pick this one good question maybe its merely a gimick to help push the city sets with all the other competing themes the cement mixer is a special edition as well	neutral
this set looks pretty good to me it is six wide isnt it that is nice for a truck like this	positive
great review my only grip with this set is you can only fit one pallet in the truck it should have been the same size as the trailer so you can at least fit 2 pallets seems like alotof wasted space if im going to transport cargo i want to use the maximum amount of space aviable xd	negative
i got this set last week and just to add a few of my own points cons  the forklift spring feels a bit flimsy  i dont know how long it will last or how much stress it would take  and the end coil isnt really heavily secured to the lift mechanism time will tell on that one  30 stickers its the exoforce of city sets the truck set does look less plain with them on though i would reccomend lining them up with the green brick in the second container rather than applying the first lot without a guide or they may end up uneven  its very hard to put the minifig in the forklift without dismantling or breaking open the set slightly  the cargo box attached to the main cabin of the truck doesnt hold very strongly  minifigs are dull  that dark blue torso with pattern is way overused  green stickers are a different green to the bricks themselves pros  lots of nice pieces including the large white panels and cargo pieces and i like the green white colour scheme  the cargo doors open well and the hingeing mechanism doesnt stand out to the detriment of the rest of the set as some people have complained about the mail airplane  studless floor in cargo containers makes it easy to move pallets in and out  fits in better than the heavy hauler to a minifig sized city  new 1x1x4 slope at least i hadnt seen it before overall  nice set with some good pictures although a bit flimsy and way too many stickers  the same issues i have with the cargo plane as well although that had more colour issues	positive
hey thanks for the review the brickster i was just wondering if you could possibly upload a picture of the instructions for the forklift and if possible tell me the piece  of the 1x4 slope bricks to bricklink them thanks	neutral

greetings and welcome to another redman review im your host redman and today i adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the impulse set simply titled the knight no wait thats the old script xd i mean the good wizard sweet the other castle impulse set the first being the knight this is a wonderful and in my case unexpected addition to the castle line i did not expect to get a nice good wizard but rather another plain white skellie for the impulse and was pleasantly surprised when i saw the first picture of this set the impulse sets give you pieces you wouldnt expect to see in such small sets for example the knight came with the armour and this comes with an owl a gem and a crystal ball piece it comes with 11 pieces including the wand owl and gem and no spares which doesnt really matter as it doesnt need any the box sports the set number age range which i blissfully ignore xd awesome castle logo and the assembled set with the usual 11 scale picture of a minifig the back of the box shows pictures of the boxed skeleton tower and kings castle siege sets note the price is in new zealand dollars and is really the same prica as any other impulse set next are the instructions which are separated into 3 parts 1 for the minifigure 1 for the table and one for the bird stand very simple also worth mentioning is the parts numbers are next to their respective parts for replacement parts etc on the back we see on the top half pictures of skeleton prison carriage skeleton tower and kings castle siege this time not of the boxed sets but the sets themselves on the lower half we have 8 pictures each of the different impulse sets the wizards torso is plain sand blue with no patterns or anything but it doesnt really matter is his beards in the way  the head is that same old white fade to grey beard head but the white beard covers up most of the grey my favourite part is the pants i love that were getting printed belts and legs again his belt has 4 gold crosses as seen in if you look closely the new crownies torso and the crownie archers torso and a belt buckle and the legs have a bottle a coin and a small bag nice little wizardey items the er items no accessories no models the stuff in the set include a little stand for the owl and a table utilising the new 4x4 round piece in light bley with the crystal ball in the middle encasing the yellow gem held on by a 2x2 circle piece in blue why blue im not sure maybe its because the crystal is yellow and the crownies colours are blue and gold so the blue piece with the yellow crystal symbolise the crownies colours or maybe tlc just felt the need to include an odd colour p in conclusion this is a wonderful set with some neat accessories and it doesnt really need to be bought in the masses after all you needs an army of owls and wizards  p so it works fine as a single set and adds a more fantasy feel to your crownie army thats all for today folks sweet redman thanks for reading another of my redman interviews any suggestions on how towhat to do to improve it is greatly appreciated as are all comments and criticisms except those blatant thoughtless criticisms that dont help at all p peace edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0131 pm	positive
yay another redman review you are an excellent reviewer iamded redman your pictures show all the details included in the set and your thoughts bring new light to features and bits i hadnt noticed or thought about before y i love this little set i will get two i reckon because i want all the wizard bits in a minifig box as well nice little humorous pic at the end too one improvement i think could be to include the pics of the back of the box and other side of the instructions anyway honestly there isnt much to improve you are an excellent reviewer  redman on batbrick is back 	positive

thank you very much for a good and informative review doc sinister y this looks like the best of the bigplanes to me very nice and smoother than the rest  although like youve said what the heckre they transporting diamonds and pearls so much wasted space and the landing gear should really fold in n	neutral
i loved the pics in the catalogues but was a bit disappointed by the build and end result my own thoughts cons  as noted the cargo space is really small considering the size of the plane although i can see this is restricted due to playability  without the barrier in the middle the cargo would slide all over the place while the plane was being swooshed  the cargo lift im not sure how else to describe it is very weak and snaps off although it is a clever design i think its badly implemented  there is nothing to hold the cargo pallet to the cargo lift truck so it tends to slide off all over the place as soon as the truck moves  colour issues  i had at least 3 shades of green with the larger plane pieces and noticeable variances even with identical cargo hatch pieces at least one of them also came quite scratched which was a little disappointing  at 7995 aud its 10 more than the passenger plane was with less pieces and figs and no printed pieces whatsoever more  for less methinks pros  lots of nice cargo crate pieces and even the stickers for these are pretty good  landing gear piece adjusts very well to height differentials so the plane doesnt lose its gear as often as the earlier passenger planes  the hinging mechanism works very well to open the cargo holds  opens very smoothly and is not noticeable  id definitely like to see more of this technique  the little vehicles work well chained together and are all good small designs overall  i really like the large planes since 06 but i dont think theyve still quite hit the nail on the head whereas the earlier planes were a little flimsy this one is sturdier but has its own issues the look of the cargo plane is nice and the new landing piece and cargo hatch pieces are really great but some design weaknesses and colour issues detract from the overall product its a shame as with a bit of tweaking this could have been a musthave set	negative
tks drs for your cool review  i admit tht this plane is way better than i imagined  even if i still dislike the new hull the engines and landing gear are really improved and the way to operate the crates work really well  tks for sharing these pics  yoda	positive

thanks everyone heres part 2 the second instruction booklet includes instructions for both alternate models which is good i hate having too many manuals here she is the plane its very nice and well proportioned but where did iamded get that laser overview the landing gear is very sturdy and nice and the wings are surprisingly good top view iamdeds head fell into the propellers i was trying to save him honest a view of how the motor on this one works by pushing the orange button you can make the prop spin it is well integrated like the chopper though the prop only spins for about 2 12 seconds still its a nice feature the tail is also well made simple but lovable oh and check out that tank the prop spinning agh is that my hand final view there seems to be some sort of explosion here 8 well i think i got iamded more than me atleast the second model is also great though not as good as the chopper the lack of space to fit something into the cockpit brings it down a bit but it is a very nice model overall i recommend it though unlike the chopper it will be hard to mod into minifig scale so far so good with 4995 here are the leftover pieces from the model enjoy batbrick away 	positive

i really like this set even though i was hoping for a minimotor d chock full of great parts too thanks for the review sweet	positive
thanks guys heres the final part the instructions for the boat begin on page 46 the overall set its actually much nicer than i thought it would be the pictures on the box make it look ugly top view tommy guns do not actually come with set  side view the designers have done an excellent job with the hull considering the lack of many slopes pieces you can see it is pretty much minifig scale too here you can see that by pushing in the red technic axle the anchor on the front will be hauled back into the boat back view these outboard motors are pretty cool though i wish they could go own into the water more overall though the weakest model its still a lot of fun and has a clever way around the lack of a shapely hull i was impressed with it after the building it it even has two rounded snotty bottom pieces on the nose of the boat to give the impression it is speeding through the water with the front lifting up lots of leftover pieces for this one the pieces sorry about the poor photograph there it was getting late  overall the cargo chopper is another great set in the fantastic creator line loads of fun great play and some clever designs it challenges you to make your own things and even includes some nifty pieces bley barrels wub  i wont give it a rating but ill just say i certainly recommend it to fans of the theme and lego fans in general now finally iamded and i teamup in the face of a larger foe get that lord of pies batbrick away 	positive

great little set i bought this set only a few years ago misb and i am still very happy about it the hut is simple but very effective as a castaway building on some deserted island the palmleaves are a good addition to any lego collection this set had a nice amount of weapons two for each pirate and two of those weapons are flintlock muskets as opposed to just pistols nice poll as well but you made sure nobody can give this set a 1 which is very nice but probably a little mistake d  i gave it the toprating y	positive

well since this topic has resurfaced i would add my 2 cents about my appreciation of this set it was the first and unfortunately the largest pirate set i owned as a kid but i played the wazoo out of it some of the minifigs have lost almost all their face printing after so many play sessions theres just something about the hut that appealed to me more than the cheesy skullface islands we keep gettingprobably that it wa kind of neutral good for my pirates settlers or islanders though the palm leaves were rather fragile and used to break off the studded parts it would be nice to get more of these beach village army builder sets edited by ardelon 21 september 2014  0340 pm	neutral
hi guys i picked these up the other day but its taken me this long to get round to posting the reviews so here we go tub comparison with a minfig thanks brainbox the lighting changes a bit throughout the photographs as it was going dark outside so i only really had my desk light and i kept getting in the way 4837 mini trains now the box i really like its no different to those of last years sets but the colour here is simply fantastic and really seems appropriate for the theme so this is what you get inside all the pieces are still inside the bag the optical illusion was accidental d  no pieces of particular outstanding interest but the dark green cheese slopes are rather nice look out for those later 1 2 3 this is the main model and uses all the pieces in the set bar these two which according to the inventory are spares but as with all my other creator sets im cheating and leaving them in this is far and away the best model of the three and evokes the iconic version of a steam train the green looks superb but im not sure whether thats due to the model itself or the actual colour moving on we get to the second model 1 leftovers yes i admit i was using a piece of paper this isnt actually a bad model i dont think its quite as nice as the previous one but its not bad its different from the first model as well which is good too muich of the same can be a bad thing finally we come to the third model leftovers now ill be honest i dont really know what this is its not that good a model compared to the other two thats all i can say really and of course all the pieces fit into the tub overall i have to say i do like this set despite the weak third model the strength of the primary and secondary models make up for any weaknesses in the third and i can imagine the pieces being fully usuable in building other trains while the basic idea of these tubs isnt quite as good as the xpods with regards portability and general niceness they arent bad and for a fairly cheap price 34 as well 4838 mini vehicles this is one of those set boxes that you see because of the ridiculously loud colours sound marketing scheme if you ask me ive managed it again there are pieces outside the bag or are there now these i like y  1 2 i dont know what the clip is for there isnt one on the other side 3 4 5 this is the main model of the set and again all the pieces are used bar these three the spares its quite a nice model although the cars a bit odd still i like the ramps and the colour scheme reminds me just a little of g1 ultra magnus hmm i think that boom arm could do with refixing 1 2 leftovers this is actually quite nice as well its that classic breakdown truck and the boom arm itself is quite nice with quite a bit of movement another solid model 1 leftovers im surprised by the amount of detail here actually not only have tlc included a spare wheel at the back but also what looks like a trailer hitch which all adds to the realism another nice model to round out a nice set and in the tub overall im not sure which of the two i like better when i bought them and on the way home i much preferred the train set but after building this set im not sure this is another good set from the year when tlc seems to be giving us so many there are some good pieces in here too and while theres nothing unique theyre still good so thanks for reading hope it helped someone and if there are any requests ill see what i can do thats requests for pics not songs   edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0656 pm indexed	positive

so here it is finally my first ever review of a lego setoh wait its actually 2 sets so i dont really know how to do it right but ill try the best sorry if some pictures are a litte bit dark but im not really into photography and i got bad light here lets start with the dwarfs mine defender theme castle 2008 set name dwarfs mine defender number 7040 pieces 86 price 999 eur first as always the box the back a few instructions on how the defender works for those how dont know   and the instructions we continue with the minifigs sorry i forgot to make a closeup of the dwarf and finally the mine defender itself i personally think it isnt as bad as maybe some people think the chain for the catapult is great i think i kinda love those controls the mechanism with the rubbe rband actually works pretty well but only on a notglossy underground thats pretty much all of it its small but i like it a lot so lets go on to the tower raid now which would be my absolute favorite of those new sets  theme castle 2008 set name tower raid number 7037 pieces 364 price 2999 eur again first the box  instructions we got 2 sets of instructios here one for the tower and one for the siege tower the minifigs we got one archer and one soldier here both with the torsos of the 2007 sets now thw orc side starting with the great leader with the new armor and the golden helmet i love those pieces closeup of the armor  helmet then we got another orcknight and the prisoner with handcuffs the crownie tower looks great overall though there is something i dont really like about it but later on that now the back and that is what really bothers me there areno walls on the first floor except the one with the wallpiece and the door and theprison also is open at the back the orc easily could jump out there not sure what these are all about they really dont add much to the set enough rant now lets go on with a pretty sweet detail the golden crystal on the little table the wall piece on the first floor you can ram in and finally the very best thing of this set the amazing orc siege tower from the front the great working ram you can pull it back very far and it got pretty much power here we got another sweet detail the siege platform that moves out by pulling a cord in the back of the tower finally a picture of a bit siege action if you ram in the lower wallpiece the brown shelfs of the prisonfloor collapse and the prisoned orc is finally free summary likes as i mentioned before i really think thats the best ever produced siege tower its got so mich details and works extremely well also the overall look of it is magnificant the destroymechanism of the tower is pretty cool too the brown door is a fine detail too nothing much to say about the mine defender i like this little set and theres nothing really to bother about it dislikes the back of the tower thats really the only thing thats a bit bad imo they could have put there 2 more walls on the first floor and something to lock the prison easily final thought the tower raid for me personally is the best of the 2008 sets so far its got great playability and looks simply good my opinion buy it	positive
tks for those so much  y nice reviews i love that tower raid and the defender and will buy them both quote really dont add much to the set oh but they do more pieces higher price 	neutral
thanks for these fantastic review its the first time i take a good look at these sets there is a good chance ill buy the dwarfs mine defender especially for that price	neutral
this set didnt come with the new jail door piece id have guessed it would have since there is an orc in prison nice review im looking forward to picking up these sets steve	neutral
thank you for these fine reviews metalandi y therere really some nice playable features in the tower raid set and all these great orc torsos just sweet and it even looks like that black orcarmors a new piece lovely 	positive
cheers for the reviews theyre both nice sets and i think i just may have to buy both or maybe ill get two of the dwarf set the figs in each are really cool as well the dwarf well theyre just cool anyway but the troll with the golden helmet and armour thats just wub	positive
the tower raid has the best price per piece ratio in the whole 2008 line thanks for the review 	positive
thanks metalandi these are 2 great sets im definately looking forward to seeing these in new zealand stores the collapsing floorprisoner freeing mechanism on the tower is wonderful a great touch some slight modifications like some walls will make this perfect and the dwarfs mine defender is a sweet little set with some neat minifigs thanks for the reviews y peace	positive
thanks for these great reviews sweet the dwarfs mine defender looks interesting the figs though are wub the only thing missing is a weapon for the dwarf and some shields the battering ram and tower are awesome 8 the troll king with new torso helmet and body armor is simply amazing i like how the troll is handcuffed d the tower shows nice detail except for the poor brig  i love that gold crystal the battering ram is a thing of beauty 30 for the tower and ram and 10 for the defender are very well priced i still want the battle wheel more though damn exclusives   p	positive
thanks for the review i personally think the siege tower is probably the best one which lego has ever produced	positive
well i dont think orcs are that sturdy seeing that theyd have to jump from the second level of the tower i dont see survival as his chief objective p awesome review im loving these sets more and more the tower raid is definitely the best and the cheapest set there  oh and pirhana its not really a king its more like an officer remember the wizard rules these goblins edited by trooperdavinfelth 22 february 2008  0249 pm	positive
thank you for the nice review pity the tower is not designed better but i still want to buy these 2 sets if only there were 2 dwarves in the dmdefender	neutral
i got myself today 3 dwarfs mine defender and i have to say that sets does suck big time the plastic rubber band doesnt do squat and 3 wheels i really not enough i only built 2 of those and changed the front of it with 4 wheels and no plastic rubber band and i changed the 2x2 dark bley plate its still looks good but the crappy rubber band system is really not well thought off anyhow my orc army is growing  yoda	negative
hello eurobricks my first post yesterday i will buy this two sets im waiting for the packs sorry but my english isnt good	positive

green grocer reviewed by dunamis set 10185 2352 pieces 14995 from the lego store glendale ca build time 65 hours holy guacamole almost exactly one year after caf corner was released we get the third installment in the increasingly popular lego exclusive town series combined with the famous 10182 caf corner and its trusty companion 10190 market street this trio makes the foundation for an amazing city block of lego goodness for those new to this series of sets check out my reviews of the two previous sets in this line cafe corner market street i would not necessarily recommend reading too many of my reviews in one setting as you might experience loss of brain cells andor drowsiness you have been warned so how does green grocer stack up to the two previous sets you ask well follow along kind reader and i shall attempt to unravel this question the box the gigantic box is pretty standard and looks amazingly similar to the caf corner box the back of the box shows some of the features of the green grocer as well as a lot of the cool interior that was absent from the previous sets in addition we are shown an image of the three sets together and a small insert image showing how they connect together as if we could not master that difficult maneuver opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals as it seems to be the norm now we have the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets however upon opening the tabs we are pleasantly surprised to find a cardboard tray have not seen one of those in a while as you can see in the photo we have two 32x16 green base plates three instruction manuals and a bunch of bags that are broken into four groups group 1 has 12 bags and goes with the first manual and builds the first floor group 2 has 9 bags and goes with the second manual to build the second floor group 3 has 14 bags and goes with the third manual for the top floor and roof and one bag that is not numbered and hence you can open it whenever you feel like it there are no stickers  yay moving right along we get to the three instruction manuals the manuals the three manuals are 55 47 and 47 pages in length they are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings  piece call outs for each step  parts inventory at the end of the second manual  page numbers color separation in these manuals was fine for me except dark bley and black we get a nice photo of all three sets together plus we get a nice tip showing how to split up the bags and what goes where those additional pieces you see in the photo just below the numbered bags are the pieces that come from the single unnumbered bag along with the base plates parts list random manual shot the pieces upon opening the first set of bags one thing is clear there are a ton of little tiny pieces the minifigs are included in this first section as well interesting to note that there are a handful of printed pieces and as i mentioned previously no stickers we also get a host of new and exciting pieces to add to our collection keep in mind my scope of lego sets is generally centered around star wars technic creator and the occasional racer set so what is new to me might have been around 15 years at any rate here are some of the more interesting pieces again note the printed tiles this time around lego has decided to include 33 more minifigs than the caf corner and market street sets yes we get four minifigs instead of three here are the cast of characters pictured left to right is sir top hat miss jenny blue overalls patti o furniture and little timmy cub scout ill leave it up to the minifig aficionados to decipher which torsos are new and to tell us all about the hairpieces i can say with reasonable certainty that the four yellow smiley heads are not new somebody check that dont forget the lovable little cat named tom he is the archrival of the mouse jerry that lives downstairs overall there are a lot of pieces large variety and wide range of colors the build if you have either of the two previous sets you will feel right at home here just like in the previous builds it seems like the first ten build steps are consumed with laying a bunch of 1x1 1x2 and 2x2 tiles everywhere almost feels like 30 of the pieces are used up right away see below there are several sections where you build various parts of the interior take a look at the cash registercounter below and the beverage cooler and the produce stand and everything that goes in it looks like someone has mail looks like someone just had a baby this set is incredibly well done and gives inspiration to go back and add similar items to caf corner and market street as before the average builder is introduced to some new building techniques like using the hinge plates to make the angles on the front of the building as shown below also the top of the roof shows some interesting ideas overall it is a really fun build that kept me entertained the whole way the design this is a great set with lots of little details i especially like the little mouse hole in the wall leading to the jerry the mouses area they even included a little slice of cheese it seems the designers cant get away from the usual staircase which i always feel is way too big maybe future designs can incorporate a spiral staircase to save room for other things in the model one welcome addition is the fire escape as seen below im going to show a bunch of examples of various items in the set so you can get the feel of the amazing detail in this design take a look at the lamps torches just outside the door and the streetlight with fire hydrant brickwork and archway awning here is the back side of the building note the trashcans and yard tools here is a closeup of the railings on the second story balcony and the second photo is the finished product with curtains in the window nice use of cups to make the banister on the second floor here is the fireplace on the second floor second floor staircase with toms hiding spot check out the radiator on the third floor more third floor nice grandfather clock and rug third floor check out the deck that is up on the roof complete with two chairs table umbrella flower pots and grill interesting use of minifig hammers on the roof finally here is what is left over when were done a couple of shots of the front a shot of the back and here are all three together overall thoughts this is an incredible set and the best of the three in my opinion it is hard to top caf corner but i believe green grocer just did i absolutely love all the details and building techniques that went into making this set there is a ton of different parts and wide color selection as usual we get a bunch of tiles and small plates but that goes with the series also we get four minifigs and lots of minifig accessories im giving this set a score of 100 i thought about it and i really dont know how they could have made it any better in short run dont walk to go pick this set up final rating 100 build 1010 excellent  lots of nice interiors details and accessories to build functionality 1010 outstanding raises the bar with interior and detail think caf corner on steroids design 1010 excellent  cant say enough good things about it parts 1010 great selection and diverse colors great minifigs price 1010 price ratio is excellent but lots and lots of little parts well worth the price as alway feel free to comment complain and question what you see here id like to hear your feedback on this amazing set	positive
a great reveiw dunamis y  you have only backed up what i thought when the pictures first appeared if you are a lego fan there is no excuse not to buy this set it is a must have i love the mouse hole and the mouse and his cheese wub 	positive
very nice very nice indeed lots of lovely little details even at the back this review hasnt changed my opinion one bit im still looking forward to when i can finally pick up mine at the post office im crossing my fingers that there will be more buildings following after this one im guessing that legos just testing the waters to see how far afols are willing to go regarding price vs details green grocer is still epic though	positive
for some silly and quite delusional reason i thought that i had a chance to review this first d but yours is at your house and mine is hopefully winging its way to me  thanks for the review it will help me survive until mine arrives i love this set wub hopefully there will be many more stunning sets like this to come sweet xwingyoda on mar 8 2008 0803 pm said i didnt know green grocer had a rodent infestation  neither did i and i have looked through the instructions at least three times 	positive

like the set this review also deserves a 1010 ive ordered this set yesterday on sh seeing and reading this review im convinced it will be worth the money so bonaparte is finally entering the city theme 	positive
this is a nice review thanks for all the great pictures	positive
truly an awesome review thanks dunamis i ordered my two copies one to build one to store in the vault last week cant wait to get this one the attention to detail here is what makes the set great theres nothing to criticize about this set its really the closest thing to perfection that i have seen from tlc the difference between this set and cc is the interior detail and because of that gg now become in my opinion the best set ever released by tlc do the ccggms sets fit well with the 50th anniv town plan my impression is that out of the box at least they dont which is too bad however i dont think it would be hard to mod the town plan so it looks like it belongs in the same town as ccggms these sets to me are what i have always wanted from tlc as an adult i hope they keep up the line and add more elements to this excellent lineup	positive
wow thanks for the nice review i have the other 2 sets and waiting for this to come to our shores stupendous design and details i really like the hammerrails on the roof cant wait wub	positive
o m g i must have that set  y wub i remember you telling me that you were going to do a review of this set and i was so anxious i love these reviews thanks so much great pictures wub y y this will dent my wallet 8 i am so envious	positive
a very informative review indeed thank you so much for doing so now i know that the price is worth every penny leaving my pocket  what do you guys think is tlc putting up as the next modular set is it asking too much of tlc to produce 1 modular set each quarter 4 times a year	positive
a million thanks for this review this is greater than i thought i especially like that clock im going to get this set as soon as possible	positive

thank you sooo much for this amazing review dunamis i absolutly adore this set and youve review has prompted me to certainetly start saving i have a bit left over form christmas that will come in handy d  i love the little fridge downstairs the fire escape and the mouse hole alot more good ideas that we can all use in creating our own buildings this line is by far my favorite lego line ever yes even beats starwars but only just   hooray for dunamis xd	positive
ive got something i want to share with you a beautiful dream came true 1 the box top back the alternate model is also very well done the pneumatics dump the bucket and open the flap  open you can see a diagram how the pneumatics work just a happy kid playing the plastic inlays  all 2 the parts as you can see 8854 offers a very large variety of different parts loads of technic bricks gears and even plates also note the threaded axle 10 5 large pulleys a big turntable and the 1x20 rack 3 building the mechanism for the outriggers and the rotation of the turntable the turntable the pneumatics are finished the mechanism for the telescope the finished model 4 random shots you can see how the turntable will be rotated thanks for reading erm viewing the pictures please comment if you want to	positive
really cool set this has convinced me that i really want it	positive
wow another old technic set review by you nice set and thanks for that review	positive
looks like you have the original 1989 version with the yellow top cylinders  i got one too several years ago although i probably paid too much for it p on a side note if that pneumatic tubing feels harder and stiffer than the modern type i highly recommend that you dont use it and buy some of the newer stuff off bricklink instead tlc originally used a different material for the tubes and this stuff degrades the nozzles on pistons switches and so on over time the old tubes also grip the nozzles much more firmly and if you arent careful when removing them its actually possible to rip off the nozzles completely xo i had this happen a few years ago although tlc replaced my broken pistons for free i got rid of that stuff for good after that although the pistons on my power crane still have slightly discolored nozzles edited by cp5670 10 march 2008  0457 am	neutral
great pictures especially the perspective from overhead this is one of my favorite technic models because it packs so many features in a relatively small space and im working on documenting this one in technicopedia right now thanks for the photos eric	positive
thanks for another fun review this set is high on my list of things to buy i love cranes built many and bought many including the classic 8460 from 1995 and the more recent 8421 that threaded axle never stopped intriguing me it was use in so few sets i believe 8851 contained one as well and i still dont know why its better than any other axle congratulations with a near mint copy of this set 	positive
simonwillems on mar 10 2008 0132 pm said that threaded axle never stopped intriguing me it was use in so few sets i believe 8851 contained one as well and i still dont know why its better than any other axle the purpose of the threaded axle is to carry tension regular axles are used primarily for carrying torsion for gears sometimes for compression 8855 landing gear helicopter skids and sometimes just for looks roll cages canopies but used in tension connectors will usually just pop off with the threads and the corresponding nuts this part can be used to squeeze parts together like the pen in the plotter of 8094 or to hold heavy assemblies onto turntables like 8862 and 8851 with the power crane 8854 reviewed here that is the complete list of sets which used this part i wrote about it here httpwwwericalbre1984htmlparts eric	neutral

hi this is my third oldschool technic set review i dont want to talk much please enjoy just the pictures 1 the parts 2 building the two axles you can see in the middle are not connected and dont belong to each other the axle on the left side is for the steering on the right side for the engine the darkgray technic gear 16 tooth with clutch allows the connection from the differential gear to the engine trough the axle for the steering the v6engine the winch thats a part you dont see everyday a 1x2 rack it only reappears in 2 sets from 2001 and 2004 the rebel wrecker has been released in 1994 the front double wishbone with antisway barsuspension yeah i got it from technopedia xd  the finished model 3 random shots i really like this picture authoritative isnt it 8 d thanks for viewing the pictures please comment if you want to	neutral
thanks for reviewing all these old sets will you be doing any more	positive
yeah if i rebuild and wash a model i will record it glad to see you liked it	positive
this set is really cool i might actually get it	positive
ah a good old retro review those old school days had some pretty impressive sets with alot more complexity than modern sets if you have it may i recommend 8880	positive
the only original stickers are the front headlightpatterns on the 2 red 1x2 bricks the others have been destroyed  must have been the bad decaying sticker quality that breaks when youll remove it  so i printed them i didnt print the flag for only the alternate model needs it although its a neat idea and lordgalewind clickey i keep that in mind one of my 8880 is already dusty enough	negative
thanks for reviewing this classic set i got it when it first came out and still love it the suspension steering and robust look of the model havent been done that well ever since this set puzzled me though back in the days the rear suspending part containing the differential and some gears was shown different on the box from the instructions in the instructions it showed that the grey part of the suspension in the back had to be made using a 1x2 smooth tile and 4 cornerplates 2x2 in grey the box however showed a much sturdier solution using a 1x8 tile and a 1x8 plate it is also visible on the cover of the instructions the pieces i mean are in this picture bernddasbrot on mar 9 2008 0705 pm said otherwise great set	positive
thanks youve just motivated me to go on a senselesspreliminarydesignerrorshunt a few things ive discovered left side alternate model the steering link can only be put in place with a little violence the handlebar  is turned far more than its actually possible although the wheels are straight right side the 1x8 tile simonwillems pointed out the half bush right next to it is cantfindthewords wrong could be that the technic triangle is missing the windscreen 1x6 technic plates are mounted with 12 pins instead of axle pins with half bushes who can find more xd	neutral
ive seen a few cases like this where the box pictures are slightly different from the actual model the airtech claw rig compressor is another one that comes to mind the changes sometimes seem pointless and make you wonder why they bothered p quote the only original stickers are the front headlightpatterns on the 2 red 1x2 bricks the others have been destroyed  must have been the bad decaying sticker quality that breaks when youll remove it  so i printed them i didnt print the flag for only the alternate model needs it although its a neat idea the other stickers on mine have held up pretty well although i didnt try to remove them after i put them on the flag started to break after a year or so and just fell off its axle at one point i taped over it and its holding up well now although its a little frayed along one edge this is actually the earliest set ive seen that uses this crappy sticker material which is unfortunately very common today even other technic sets had good stickers for many years after that	negative
bernddasbrot on mar 10 2008 0556 pm said youve just motivated me to go on a senselesspreliminarydesignerrorshunt man this set is a disaster what were they thinking d p i just remembered one other fun aspect of this set the crane hook can be attached to the underside of the rear bumper to hold it in position while driving along but when things are like this and you try and wind up the cable the winch is strong enough to break the original provided lego rope it worked with my copy d so this set is capable of demolishing itself but still one of the best technicsets i have with all stickers intact im not so sure about that flag though must check on that	positive
wow that first picture is great you must have a very wide angle lens with the capability to focus very close macro the perspective makes the model look huge nice work i think the suspension on this set is my favorite of all technic it has such large travel and is so what word should i use bouncy hey why do you only review sets which are red d eric	positive
blakbird on mar 10 2008 0935 pm said hey why do you only review sets which are red d i exactly thought that today as i made the pics for my signature xd at my school leaving examination i made a model in blender3d and explained to the board of examiners how to build a car and how to animate it it needed a color so i took red because all beautiful and fast cars are red my physics teacher contradicted 	neutral

i can remember that ive seen a few color variations on brickshelf and on ebay they sold well its new and familiar at the same time that makes it more interesting	positive
reread your review today great pictures this is a fabulous model got this model a few months ago for just € 25 it is small and has great working parts i love the way the frontsuspension is made epic i only had the lightstickers replaced with transclear bricks btw the gear rack has been used in this years 8048 buggy	positive
i also happened to receive this set this weekend virtually misb the seals on the side of the box were loose however everything inside was untouched this little beast a joy to build and even more so to play with as indicated by eric on the technicopedia page its crammed with functions for a mediumsized set i think i love it even more than my son does	positive
i read blackbirds technopedia page on this truck the other week went onto ebay and picked up a misb copy for £25 gbp bargin great to get old sets unopened peeling the plastic off of the specialist parts was always cool love the front suspension	positive
that price is exceptional its less than what i paid for mine 9 years ago and is even less than the original price of the set note that the stickers in this set are the bad variety that will crack and peel over time if you want to preserve them the technic flag in particular you will need to tape over it	neutral
somehow i also managed to get this set in very good condition including box instructions and all stickers for a mere €22 a few months ago this is indeed a very special set and was a pleasure to build the only flaw i noticed was weak support of the rear drivetrain which was easily corrected with a few extra plates	positive
thanks for the great review vbbn y i already own 2 of these xd on your camera there should be a little flower sign switch to that to go to micro mode  its a really good first review y sweet	positive
a nice review well done y the set itself doesnt look quite interesting to me compared with some of the newer ones like 7647 or 7648 the way the driver fits into the cockpit looks not very clever and pretty uncomfortable as well xd	negative
my friend has this set and the alien ships wings are wobbly and overall x he may have built it wrong im not sure i didnt see the build anyways nice review y	negative
sweet first pic review y i got this set for a birthday present last year and it is pretty fun overall the alien ship in this set is actually one of my favorites it just looks cool and the way you can fold it out is really clever the only negative for me is the cockpit of the mining unit not really because it isnt detailed but because mine is top heavy and keeps falling forward its kinda funny if you think about him driving along and then falling forwardbut not funny at all when youre playing 	positive
cool review makes me want to get the set y	positive
thank you for your nice review vbbn y but it only confirms this theme is not my cup of tea weird aliens strange colors parts stuck together with no idea  i always hated this big wheels  its even worse in orange x saving money for different sets on and that doesnt mean it was a bad review  	neutral
vbbn on mar 12 2008 1137 pm said those new alien commanders for summer look promising though ive not heard of these can you direct me to some pictures steve	positive
vbbn on mar 14 2008 0112 am said holodoc i agree with you and the buety of being a custom parts maker is that i can recolor these  y athos sure buddy they have moving arms legs a real mf the arms and legs are the same just flipped  blech i dont like that at all x steve	negative
thanks for the review i do like this set though i am not a fan of the jelly aliens though the alien ship looks good with the curved parts and flip open and close design	positive
well as bad a concept aliensvshumans is for a theme i really do like this set the human rover has nice parts for reuse especially those oldschool space wheels and despite those wobbly wings i really like the alien ship goes from a flying saucerish shape to a spread winged almost raven shape very ominous and cool looking now that alien commander is terrible if i dont buy bionicle minifigs already why would i be interested in that thing kinda wish theyd take the drones from the retiring exoforce theme and do them in green theyd make nice alien robot things	positive

hi this is my forth oldschool technic set review since blakbird pointed out that all my technic reviews are red i chose a yellow dune blaster for today just kidding this set is red as it should be dont worry my next reviews will be yellow and black uhhh forshadowing   i will start with some facts 277 elements and released in 1994 thats enough 1 the box 2 the parts 3 building instructions and catalogues wow no folds no wear marks  simply wub was lesen coole kids  klick das super magazin fuer coole kids how obvious 4 building no differential i really love the way the 1x8 technic bricks on the sides will be positioned later fun fact the engine contains no 2ltechnic axle and finished a real quick build 5 spare parts for the alternate model the yellow technic handle should be from 8412 maybe a bonus feature from the seller 6 random shots 7 final thoughts this is my second 8829 and i also noticed that the engine turns very hard the alternate model is really sorry to all those of you who like it crappy i mean a nice idea but not with this wheels  anyway a really beautiful technicset reminiscing this word exists does it thanks for viewing the pictures i hope you enjoyed it please comment if you want to edited by bernddasbrot 21 march 2008  0209 pm	positive
i dont own the 8296 but what i can see from the pictures i would say that 8296 is very similar to 8829 the only things that are different ist that 8296 is studless and features a steering wheel for the seat but 8829 has got bigger wheels  it also would have been nice if the wheels from 8296 could have the same tread	neutral
a very good review with fine and informative pictures and a really nice set thanks bernddasbrot sweet hmm i really wish that tlc would make some steerable cars within the system line too	positive

blakbird on mar 22 2008 0356 pm said imho 8829 is much better than 8296 first 8829 is a lot bigger i really like the huge rear balloon tires they both have rack and pinion steering and they both have trailing arm rear suspension with a v2 engine i think the body on 8829 is a little more well done for 8296 i think the alternate tractor model is much better for more comparisons see technicopedia eric wow 8 thanks for that cool link blakbird xd i agree that 8829s body is better i especially like 8829s rear spoiler and its angled side beams  toa of justice	positive
hello all apologize for digging out a such old post recently i got a bag of lego technic parts where there have been mixed three sets 8858 8829 and 8235 the resurrection of 8858 has been described by me in a separate post going back to the dune buggy – when i saw it for the first time back in 1994 i did not like it as i was always big fan of 8840 which i consider to the day the best looking buggy and set 8829 looked to me ugly so there were those all parts in the bag… then i though why not build it  and i started to do it when i finished i was very surprised how the final look of this set is really taking my words back unfortunately in the bag there were missing some parts and i could not rebuild the back spoiler so i made some changes to it and make it from spare parts that i have and it came out acceptable i also added some additional parts such as “fake” steering wheel “rally” logo antennas i have also reverse mounting of the rear tires – why lego did them like that i never know – as i think they look better this way set well the review has been already made by owner of this post so i will only add few things into it engine – v2 aired cooled is driven by 4 gears  from the single wheel no differential as in 8840 using two old school z14 tooth bevel  then by z24 tooth crown and z8 tooth type 1 actually the as in most old sets the pistons are moving very fast not as in current sets and smooths – i needed to extra clean all engine parts as there was a lot friction suspension – set has “engine bay” working using two old gray shock absorbers 65l – the movement is not big but works very nice better then in 8840 in my opinion steering – this is a bit odd as there is no direct connection to hog as in most old sets but first the gear rack is moved by z8 then two z14 tooth where reverse movement is taking place later connection of two old school z14 tooth bevel goes to hog details – this is the most that i like in this set specially how the use of axle pin connector perpendicular and 1x10 bricks with 3x3 cut corners and plate 1x5 toothed ends 2 studs with center axle hole are making the body shape – is just wonder tires – the balloon rear are pretty nice the front is a new version of those that were in 8840 what i do not like 1 missing of technic figure 8840 had it 2 no steering wheel in the original set 3 no differential – but having in mind that lego has introduce 2412 teeth would be difficult to build the transmission in such small space where the engine is i will shortly upload new pictures and post them here later on  over all – i think it is worth buying it as it is very payable  actually very payable and runs smoothly  the steering suspension – perfect thank you and regards	positive
pictures of my restored set 8829 i was almost 96 complete and for missing parts i add of my own the seat is black and not blue as one was missing in my 8858 the spoiler is different steering wheel added not connected to wheels and some additional items to make it look better this is how i change the tire orientation the new rear spoiler i still need to clean front rims edited by aow 26 november 2015  1232 pm	neutral
wow this buggy was my very first lego set i like this review  it remembered my childhood i also liked its body with those 8 studs long bricks on sides i can also remember trying to build engine in such way that it works smooth without success anyway i think its studless version  set 8048 is much better	positive

hi this is my forth preoldschool review as promised a yellowset  my 8862 arrived today survived the washing machine coaster and actually was real fun to build 1 information this set contains 664 parts only i thought i’d be far more and was released in 1989 in the technic theme be sure to visit technopediaif you want to know more 2 building instructions wow these instructions are used im not used to this after all this sets with unread instruction booklets the pneumatics page the last step for the alternate model 3 the parts wow look at all those technic beams gears pins a few parts are missing in this photo 3 building the left worm gear is for the outriggers the right one for turning the “rear boom” the three 12l axles left one outriggers middle one steering right one erm… rearboomrotation the two worm gears in the front part left one lifting the bucket right one dumping the bucket the turningmechanism for the “rearboom” is finished once again a toothed 10l axle the boat weight 2x6x2 is hidden underneath the radiator grill okay… many hoses and a nice comfy seat have been added now you can recognize the backhoes real shape only with a little violence it’s possible to lift the bonnet  through the pneumatic pump yeah outriggers same technique that the 8854 uses the finished “boom  jib  scoop thing” bjst  xd the finished loader bucket and to end the building process the same picture from the introduction offtopic “it is all part of the miracle of nature  the circle of life” 4 functionality this time i tried something new i hope you can spot something  if not technopedia okay here we go 5 random shots i’ve got way too many pictures this time so i refer to my brickshelf folder until it’s moderated you can follow the multilingual links eins deux three quattro fem zes sédem osiem 6 final thoughts definitely worth buying as a child i thought it looks hideous  but today i’ve found out it’s totally fun to build and freaking functional three things i want to mention though the bjst can only be slewed a new word if the outriggers are deployed it is also possible that the bjst will reach the ground danger of grinding or sticking even if the outriggers are deployed the two mechanisms for the loader bucket can actually interlock and the 14 tooth gears might break  disentangle from the axle thanks for viewing the pictures i hope you enjoyed it please comment if you want to	neutral

thanks for the review it looks beautiful my father was a backhoe driver so understandably i used to drool over this set in the catalogs i never did get it though as lego was so expensive in australia then i had around 2000 pieces and i thought i had loads d anyway last year i bought 8455 which i love it works great with a compressor i made too sweet i wish mine had a real cab though  do you have 8455 as well id love to see how they compare side by side it looks bigger than 8455 but i dont own any of the big old chuncky tires so i find it so hard to tell by the way i have been reading all of your reviews but i have been a bit busy of late so i havent had time to comment i hope you have more planned any chance of a supercar one	positive
another nice review the slow shutter speed pictures are great i think that was the only set with 8 distinct functions for a very long time and was only displaced by the 8455 backhoe in that respect the turntable on the back doesnt turn very well though as the weight is all distributed on one side the screw axle prevents it from popping off but there is still a lot of friction in it i dont have mine built anymore but it might be worth trying to put a weight brick or something on it quote do you have 8455 as well id love to see how they compare side by side it looks bigger than 8455 but i dont own any of the big old chuncky tires so i find it so hard to tell yeah its quite a bit bigger when everything is fully extended it becomes something like 26 long although the 8455 actually has morebetter functionality edited by cp5670 24 march 2008  0815 am	positive
thanks for your feedback i like both but i would say 8455 is far more than just a studless version with 10 pneumatic cylinders and 2 pneumatic pumps its a wonderful set for every pneumatic freak unfortunately i dont own the 8455  yet  sinner said i hope you have more planned any chance of a supercar one i foreshadowed a black review a few days ago guess which one xo xd	positive

quote there are 324 axle nuts on bricklink with an avg price of 089 i didnt know of this accessoryset 51102 you can buy it for 4000 8 i was thinking of getting one of those off bl several years ago back when the price used to be more like 15 or so but i realized that i hardly ever use the couple that i already have p they came out with the modern turntable the year after this set which mostly negated the need for these screw axles i think their only use now is to hold nonlego objects onto models like the technic pen in 8094 i guess you can try to make linear actuators out of them but theyre often too rare and fragile for that	neutral

bernddasbrot on mar 24 2008 0539 pm said could you explain your thoughts please you know my english skills  i was thinking you could somehow attach a 16tooth dark gray gear the one that spins freely around axles to the nut which would make the axle move in and out when the gear turned and convert the gears rotary motion to linear motion in a fairly compact package although there are other ways of doing the same thing that dont use such rare parts and the 2008 technic sets will come with prebuilt linear actuators anyway	neutral
quote how long of a shutter speed did you use 15 seconds quote by the way dont forget to build the alternate model of 8862 i will review it too and post it in this topic quote slewed i think thats a word how about slewn or slain or slewifacated i think rotated is best actually i took it from your site xd quote white is pretty rare unfortunately i dont own 8480 but i think 8824 is also a very good though small white set 8462 rocks as a blue set i just got it a few weeks ago lets see 8462 also is one of the last technic sets i would call oldschool 8479 okay too but 8458 is imho not 8868 and the totally mysteriously black set will follow quote i was thinking you could somehow attach a 16tooth dark gray gear the one that spins freely around axles to the nut which would make the axle move in and out when the gear turned and convert the gears rotary motion to linear motion in a fairly compact package did you had something like this in mind if the toothed 10l axle rotates the axle nuts want to rotate too but they cant because of that 2x4 technic plate so theyll decide to move along the axle the 1x6 bricks on each end make sure that the axle wont move in or out thanks for your feedback	neutral
quote 8462 rocks as a blue set i just got it a few weeks ago lets see 8462 also is one of the last technic sets i would call oldschool 8479 okay too but 8458 is imho not yeah the tow truck was the last set that still used mainly studded beams they made many changes to technic the following year with models becoming predominantly studless and making heavy use of the flexible axleshoses and decorative panels the technic logo and box art style was also changed a lot i really like the overall construction of that set the model is fairly lightweight but extremely sturdy it must be one of the strongest large sets theyve released quote did you had something like this in mind thats basically the idea as blakbird said though it wouldnt be very powerful and would put the axle under some stress the linear actuators theyre bringing out this year do the same thing and should work much better	positive
blakbird on mar 25 2008 0642 pm said wow thats a long exposure i would think you would get way too much light and overexpose the image the aperture must have been tiny for the aperture i dont know what ive used but my room was already very darkend as i tool the photos it was actually serendipity  blakbird said cool i am also planning to write about the combine on technicopedia i will but ill need some time i really shoud do a few things for university thats also the reason why i succeded in so many other things   blakbird said you dont own 8480 that is unacceptable it is imperative that you put a mortgage on your house immediately to get it not again sing just kidding my parents will xd  blakbird said while the assembly you have drawn would work as a linear actuator i would not recommend it the torsional stiffness and strength of an axle are proportional to the polar moment of inertia a section property most of the stiffness comes from the outside of the cross shaped axle but in the threaded axle you lose all the stiffness of the outer area because it is not continuous this means you only get stiffness and strength from the small core i think the threaded axle would bend and break very easily if subjected to much torque the toothed 10l axle doesnt look very robust youre right on brickshelf i once saw another version using a worm gear and a halfbush being moved along another axle edited by bernddasbrot 28 march 2008  0512 pm	neutral
a great review i only have new sets so looking at old ones like this is great i would suggest multiple pictures blended together afterwards instead of the long exposure pictures bernddasbrot on mar 23 2008 1132 pm said now you can recognize the backhoes real shape only with a little violence it’s possible to lift the bonnet  through the pneumatic pump arent you supposed to fit the bonnet over the pump and then attach it to the main frame  front	positive

some time ago i sort of complained about the fact that there was not much technic represented in the eurobricks community this was the topic if someone is interested i am glad to see someone took that complaint serious and started reviewing technic sets on large scale to show us how fascinating the theme really is this review is once again an excellent one i really enjoyed reading it i must buy this set sometime soon because i always liked the threeway pneumatic system it came with and the overall look of the machine for many years it seemed out of reach much to expensive and hard to come by as a kid now as an adult there are many ways to acquire this wonderful set keep on reviewing y	positive

thanks for the review and for giving me directions p i think the design of these two cars looks to be better than in the other set the drivers are positioned lower compared to the windscreen and the design of the front on th red car is really nice im missing details of motors and cars this big could use a working steering mechanism	neutral
speaking of pocket knives i just got speed racer and snake oiler at kmart and might mod the helmet so it actually looks like the cartoon the problem is  i dont want to shell out two bucks for a clear visor  by the way i know transclear visors are nonproduction but where did they come from a pickabrick if so what store well at least if i do go through getting the elusive clear visor its not as bad as the insane 25 red vader helmet this set is great i would have gotten this along with the one i purchased but i didnt have enough dough with me to get both	positive

as promised and with only a single day of delay is my review of the 2008 set 4994 creator fierce creatures this small set is the same size and price range as last years 4939 cool cars reviewed by prateek and dillthepill the box general info you get 193 pieces vs 206 for cool cars which is quite a lot but most of them are small there are a lot of hinges and some good slopes and wings the building instructions contains three models but no further ideas for inspiration primary model spider the first model is a big spider which shares some similarities to the secondary model of 4895 power in the design the legs each have 3 joints where the ones in the middle have stud joints to be moved sideways while the rest use hinges for all joints there are 8 of them and it does get a little tedious with all the repetitive building in this relatively small model i like the design of the face with a lot of eyes and a big and ugly mouth but the real gem is the xpattern on the opisthosoma made using doubleinverted slopes it is poseable and i think it looks more fierce when inverted secondary model snake the face of the snake is nicely detailed with a splitting tongue and a mouth than can move a little there is a problem with the construction it uses stacked hinges for some of the joints which are hard to pull apart without stressing the pieces tertiary model fly im not completely sure what this insect is i will say its a fly although the tail and head are too pointy this is a neat little thing conclusion primary model 8 it is a good design but lacks some sturdiness in the legs they fall off a little too easily secondary models 6 they are pretty good when you look at the bricks that are available but they dont wow you in any way and they suffer from the same issues as the primary model regarding sturdiness alternate models 3 it is hard to come up with alternate models with so many small pieces and plates that are only 1 stud wide the colors might make you want to build a spyrius space ship playability 8 the models have many movable joints and you can put quite a scare into your minifigs when their town gets attacked by these creatures unless some en forces are there to protect them price 6 creator sets are known for their great price to bricks ratio but this set doesnt quite measure up to sets like cool cars pieces 7 the pieces arent great by themselves but who doesnt need a fist full of hinges slopes and basic plates in standard colors i dont think this is a musthave set like the big rig was last year the pieces are great and it has a nice primary model but the set lacks a bit when it comes to the usual strong creator qualities like alternate models and price brickshelf gallery edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0630 pm indexed	positive
thank you for your detailed review lasse d y the only problem about this set is that most of the people here will regard this as a pure parts pack xd oooh  i just found out about the red teeth  cool i want that wub	positive
thank you for review very good army builder i see	positive
excellent review y getting a better chance to look at this set actually makes me interested in it i was in my dark ages throughout the islander days though i have built up a small force of them 10 from ebay buys but no actual sets if this is really as reasonable as you say there i may just have to pick one up soon oddly i do own the baseplates to this set having also picked them up in a lot on ebay so i might be able to recreate it manually but i think id rather pick one up whole it looks like a great mix of parts and makes a decent looking display piece thanks again for the fine review y	positive
thanks for a lovely review i only recently bought this set off ebay pretty good deal misb for 30 euros and i enjoyed putting it together and mixing it with the other piratesets when you put two sets of two baseplates together youll get a large pond with an island in the center just to achieve that i bought two more baseplates off ebay the result is this moc i always loved the islanders and have most of the sets not all of them but that is going to change in the future y	positive
excellent review i really like this set and so i gave it a 55 this set is on my list to get i especially like the speedy pirate boat and the also very fast outrigger canoe with a sail i dont think a small number of these cannibals will make much of an impact on gaming though even if they get a bonus with spears duke	positive
a mighty fine review youve created slyowl y after some sleep i shall immerse myself more fully within it	positive
nice review  although im pretty sure eldorado fortress has 8 minifigs making this set no 4 in the minifig count i gave it a 5 the number of islanders and vegetation pieces comes in very handy for land based scenarios ive got 3 copies of this set 1 of them costing me less than 2euros from an ebay auction in scotland along with forbidden island its easily one of the most common and affordable pirate sets to be found on he second hand market	positive
excellent review of an outstanding set i love the main image i want this set so bad	positive
its a great set and one i have yet to add to my collection despite my large number of islander extras enchanted island aside from having so alluring a name was good value for money in that you only needed this one set and you had a good representation of the islanders both in the size of the set and the number of minifigs the flipping rope bridge and the river give it a great rainforest retreat sort of feeling and one is inclined to think of this set as more inland than directly coastal for me whilst the islanders were never seen in the same light or popularity as pirates and imperials they were an obvious and colourful addition that to me added a whole new depth to the pirate system and one was now able to play a 3 or 4 way war adding a greater political element to the sets enchanted island is probably the 3rd most appealing of the large land bases for me after port royal and eldorado fortress good review and glad to see the set recognised	positive
for some reason i never considered buying this set but your review changed that ill try to get it on ebay thanks for your efforts to make this wonderful review for us its now added to our index	positive
wow that is one great review you made sly i gave it a four only thing i dont like is the raised baseplate it does get you a lot of figs two ships and some nice assecories great set	positive
great review i think this set looks great i really like the islanders and that statue is really nice it comes with a lot of nice leaves and i like all of the secret compartments and the like thanks for the nice review	positive
thanks for the review i am getting very interested in the classic pirates sets and i wat some now this seems like it would be a great starter	positive
i was just going into my dark ages when lego began the islander themes so ive never really cared for them but this review actually made me want this set real bad i guess this is what reviews are for then  good job on the review	positive
great review i recently got this set for only 150 sek around 17 and it´s really good	positive
hello eldiano although the review is fine and you have memories related to that set please have in mind that the post you were replying to was in fact some 7 years old this is what we call bumping of old topics and it shouldnt be done you might want to take a look at our faq posting tips and etiquette edited by phred 06 april 2015  0347 am by phred read next post please	neutral
eldiano thank you for posting about your desire to have this set i do own the set and i do recommend it to others if they somehow find a used one the bricks are kind of sparse but the the bricks it does come with are really nice i love the figs and the base plates are by far my favorite made by tlg captain braunsfeld i suggest that you read through the link that covers topic bumping more clearly i apologize for the confusion eldiano i do believe that i have found a way to remove the confusion of posting in old topics soon among the pirate staff and to the other members of eb please stay tuned sinner on 18 july 2010  0316 am said 3 lego reviews dont date thus if you have something relevant to say then feel free to post in a topic but if its more than a few months old please make sure its good and if its been a few years it better be really good for example if you liked the review or set and want to say so you probably shouldnt if youve got an answer to a question such as does anyone have pictures of the alternate model then by all means post what you shouldnt do is ask questions to the original poster heshe may not even visit eb any more	positive
fortunately i got this set on 2000 not the released version the original one and i said fortunately because its a lovely set how could i rate it but awesome a little islander army the islander girl ironhook and that cool boat with two sails the jailpolynesian statue i must recognize that i have a thing with the islanders i know that they are weird poorly based on the polynesian aborigens etc but they are very original broke with the traditional enemies and gave to the pirates theme an exotic and wild look	positive
judging from your pictures there seems to be many interesting torsos and new fleshy heads but i dont think this set is for me fueling my dismissal of this set is that i saw the trailer for this film at the cinema today and it looked pretty terrible x thanks for taking your time to review this set though ricecracker  edited by casewindu 29 march 2008  1018 pm	negative

sorry to bump such an old thread but i´ve just discovered this set is on sale at amazonde  for a mere 25 euros i am tempted not because i like the set or the models but because of the parts as most of you might know i´m especially into exoforce so would you recommend to get this set just for the parts are they a good choice to combine with efsets would anyone of you be interested in obtaining the fleshieparts of the minifigs from me as i totally don´t need those	neutral
i picked up this set a few weeks ago along with the smaller sets that come with the mach 5 and racer xs car and i was pleasantly surprised the commentators stand is nothing to write home about but the assortment of figs is great numerous new face prints in flesh i believe and in spite of the large amount of stickers the three cars are each unique and very welldesigned my only gripe about them is that cannonball taylors car the black and yellow one was a missed opportunity as in the movie its yellow and purple i know tlc is dropping purple for the future and had a bunch of problems with it in the past but it would have made for a great looking car imo	positive
such on 07 july 2011  0850 am said an opportunity has come up to buy this set for 100 aud just wondering whether people think its worth buying ive heard very little about the speed racer legos this comment does not seem a good reason for reviving a 2 and a half years old topic to me please avoid doing so in the future	negative
speed racer is the action filmand he has formula 1 car but he is intersted in art of the race	positive
ah thanks sommuch again for that great review y sweet man i am so happy they made this set the new one seems too boring 	positive
somehow i competely missed your review when you first made it i saw your pics on brickshelf and wondered about the review you have managed to review my all time favourite technic set it was the first large technic set i was given by my parents when it first came out in 1995 i played for hours with this set making minifig seats in it it was so huge there was room for four minifigs to sit next to eachother in front i made various applications for it a bungeejump system with a large rubber band and lots of containers to be lifted the first changes i made included the inverting of the wheels and the disabling of one of the flashlightsteering wheels because they obstructed eachother by the way the nob for your winch is yellow instead of black i know this set by heart so watch out p  i always liked those nobs i do own the 8421 and i can tell you this 8460 is much much stronger it can carry more weight because the boom is lighter then the 8421 they are powered by the same two pistons you know when you made it right when the crane is in upright position fully extended and you release the brake from the winch does the hook lower without having to pull it if it does you succeeded in constructing the set right the alternate model was great fun too the pump is cleverly hidden and the crane folds up great between the cab and the loading platform you could easily mod it with a pneumatic claw on the crane a motor to turn it and a compressor the only flaw was the loading platform which had no floor only some axles thanks so much for reviving my memorie concerning this great set y	positive
a great review thank you i do not know these old sets like this one but it is very cool to see how they were made i have an unopened 8421 maybe i should do a small review of that when i get to build it btw boxes are expensive so at a given price point its a choise between more bricks or nicer boxes i have no doubt what most people would chose front edited by front 06 april 2008  1021 pm	positive

thanks for the review sweet for its size and parts count this is a remarkably featured set i dont think ive never seen the alternate model before personally i prefer 8421 because i think it looks much better and i love the six wheel steering i also love the three segment boom and the transmission they fit it all in so neatly i realise that it has trouble even holding up itself but ultimately it doesnt matter as its not like you are really going to construction work with it what bothers me more about 8421 is the design change in the boom from chainlinks to strings i would try to mod mine but all i have is the prototype picture to base it on and i dont have enough links anyway p bernddasbrot on apr 7 2008 0729 am said yeah somehow i wonderd why only vbbn thanks responded indeed i have been very busy the last few months and i kept meaning to reply at last i managed to find the time to reply today bernddasbrot on apr 7 2008 0729 am said another reason for the 8460 as favorite set its got a real alternate model not just a different erm crane yes that really sucks somebody i havent got the time to look  on brickshelf has made a quite good alternate lego have been a bit inconsistant with alternate models lately the recent tow truck had a good one i even made both	positive
great review while i admit i wasnt into technic at the time this came out i was a mere child give me a break d i can see now why it was featured so much from the booklets to display stands at toy stores and at my local lego center when it was still around this thing was everywhere with your review i can now truly appreciate all the details of the set i got to admit i can see the appeal now that comparison shot you took is amazing i love not only just how it included the little details such as the stabilizers but also looks incredibly fun to play around with great set and an even greater review	positive
thanks guys  sinner i hope you refered to 8285 so my answer will match 8285 is interesting main model american styled truck alternate model european styled truck i dont think tlg produced many european styled truck edit i just found a wonderful mocalternate on brickshelf 8436 by industrialdesigner if i got him right he designed a few offical technic sets for tlg  all promises promises promises hm and again its ebay thats blocking me i want to foreshadow my next review although itll take some time to make it i know you know but please act inconspicuous until youll can act very astonished edited by bernddasbrot 09 april 2008  0325 pm	neutral

set ref 7625 name river chase number of minifigs 4 number of pieces unknown price 2290€ a general view of the set we’ve got an amphibious vehicle a small boat an observation post and a dark green croco so beautiful  for the figs we’ve got indy of course marion and two russian soldiers nothing special here in the back of the tree there is a box to put some things the amphibious vehicle is very nice the proportions are really great not too big not too small and there are a lot of details everywhere like the propeller a back view an inside view the small boat is a dark grey zodiac but the details are nice too giving it a retro look in the same way of all the indy vehicles the outpost has a net to permit to the bad guys to capture some nice guys and girls… but it seems that the girl marion is scared of the nice croco so indy comes and help her pushing the technic axle with this round inversed tiles which push out the net and capture the croco now marion feels happier and she takes a can of oil and whacks the poor croco without defences who has said marion is a nice girl so i’ve bought this set like an add on to my city in fact the elements of this set can easily be integrated in a town layout i plan to use the outpost for my forest section and the amphibious vehicle is always a nice touch of originality in a layout yes you can use all those military things without creating an army in a layout just put the violent parts out and you’ve got nice things like a biologist car in the case of the amphibious vehicle	positive

alex54 on apr 15 2008 1017 pm said i plan to use the outpost for my forest section and the amphibious vehicle is always a nice touch of originality in a layout yes you can use all those military things without creating an army in a layout just put the violent parts out and you’ve got nice things like a biologist car in the case of the amphibious vehicle or just put it up on blocks next to a trailer and youve got a nice trailertrash section of town steve	neutral
batbrick on apr 15 2008 0539 pm said commies look great as well haha commies this set really looks great i really see what you were saying about the whole retro thing reminds me a bit of a dino island set myself except without the dinosaurs always without the dinosaurs this is a must get does anyone know when these will be released in the us faramir edited by faramir 15 april 2008  1050 pm	positive
my favorite part of this is prob the amphibious vehicle looks really neat nice to see another different torso for marion	positive
hmm im debating whether i should get this setgreat reveiw btw i love that dark green croc	neutral
thanks for the review i really like this littleish set quite alot of detail it reminds me of sets from the late 90s more soviets are always welcome too and the new torso for marion is nice as is the new dark green alligator all of the neat little accesories are great too a cup shovel binoculars and of course the cans of gasoline again thanks for the review alex	positive
shoc on apr 15 2008 1031 pm said is that a laptop its on does it come with the set yes its a laptop and it was in the set when i opened it i understood why this little box was so heavy asus is my official sponsor so i have to show the logo i have to add that i dont have put on the stickers	neutral
great review alex after seeing these pics im really looking forward to getting this set i really like how lego has designed the gas tank thats just so good finally a different shade of green for the croc its about time and more than welcome the vehicle looks good and a fun build though im not that fond of that commie tree	positive
good	positive
darthperson8 on apr 15 2008 0712 pm said what are those bricks with the guns attached supposed to be great review and set btw some people have obliquely mentioned this in their responses to the setreview but to specifically answer your question its supposed to be a jerrycan aka a gasoline petrol container	neutral
a very fine review of a really great set thanks alex this set has everything a croc very nice mfs a neat tree trap a cool zodiac and a marvelous and very detailed amphibious car in a beautiful color scheme the only thing i´m not colpletely sure is the design of that jerrycan thanks for the right word and the interesting link kingboy  although the use of the revolver´s pretty clever indeed and fits well too it´s still clearly well a revolver very unusual and interesting for an official tlc design	positive
just like 7626 this is a must buy in my opinion i just the amphibious vehiclevery nice for army building	positive
this set looks good about the jerry cans i like how they give me more pistols this may be the only indy set i get from this batch ill just have to deal with the fleshie heads exchange them for yellow like stealth hunter said this will be good for army building silent help	positive
im glad they change the torso form the prototype	neutral
set ref 7626 name jungle cutter number of minifigs 4 number of pieces unknown price 3999€ a general view of the set we’ve got 5 giant ants two russian soldiers a general indy of course 3 trees a small entrance of a cave and the debroussaillor vehicle i don’t know the english name of it… you can’t enter into the cave because there is a spider web with its spider…unless… unless you know how the mechanism works and the spider web go up… and reveals a case with diamonds and accessories a closer view on the mechanism which is simple but works well and you can also see the difference or maybe the same size of a spider and a giant ant and i’ve always thought that those spiders were very big compared to the minifigs so those ants are really giant poor small frog the three trees with the entrance make a nice jungle layout don’t speak too loud you will wake up the soldier… don’t worry for him he will be waken up by the vehicle before being eaten by those giant ants a front view making the vehicle really menacing a back view push the red part from the back and there are two parts that fall down from the vehicle i don’t know why… the movie will clarify this i think… and here you can see how the two big circular blades turn when you push the vehicle… simple but effective run indy run this set is really nice the playability of the different elements is great the colour scheme is nice too i like those dark green tree parts the vehicle is really impressive without being too big and its very well details in general the designers of the indy sets have made a really nice works with a lot of efforts in all those details everywhere i’ve got some project for this set to integrate it in my city i’m a city mocer and not an indy fan so i don’t have bought the temple the bigger set of the series because it has nothing special for me in term of part selections or in the design in relation with the town theme and because my supermarket doesn’t have it yet so we are waiting for a member to review it and make the part 4…	positive
i like the creatures in this very much and it is good to see the vehicle from different angles thank you i think i shall buy this	positive
oh man thanks for the review imo this looks like the best set in the new indy line do you have any better pics of the colonel	positive
this one is my favorite from the bunch thanks for the time spent in making a review	positive
great review thanks a lot for all the pics i agree that this is probably the nicest set of the indy 4 wave so much dark green and i love all the plant pieces its been ages since weve had enough pieces in a regular release to build nice forests so its great to see 11 of the dark green leaves in one set and all the vines the design of the cutter looks very solid and brick built as well giant ants are great looking too	positive
a great detailed review for an excellent set i love the jungle cutter vehicle itself and all the dark green its great to have the trees and cave entrance you can never have enough extras the figs are nice too two russian soldiers the coollooking general i think his name is dovchenko or something and the repeatedbutstillnice indy with rpg thanks again looks like ill be picking this up along with jungle duel by the way i think this set is called jungle cutter	positive

thanks for this fantastic review alex those trees are a neat add on to any jungle as is that sweet cave but the main part of this set the jungle cutter man that is wicked packed with that awesome dark green and with those wonderful treads not to mention the smoothly spinning buzz saws however this sets a tad overpriced in my opinion and looking through the instructions they have that crazy colour syndrome again using blue yellow and red parts in the internal build still thanks for this sweet review with neat pics thumbup peace	neutral
great review again alex  same question in case you didnt se it in my reply to the other set where did you get those new sets  i really love that set  its called jungle cutter the trees are really cool and make a great adition to it imo that temple entrance or monument is really cool  those bionicle parts do make fantastic vegetation  i totally forgot about that green frog  thats cool  those are so cute  5 more ants is great  the vehicle look really sharp ah ah ah 2 more commies yeay  that officer is really freaky actually  could have been a high rank under pol pots regime in the s21 yeay looks more asian than russian imo now its time for my grips  same bloody rant about indy   i havent read the instructions before but once again there are so many parts in crap colours that need to be changed look at all the crap red and yellow in there  i will need to look for those parts before buying the set like i always do  mod while building on  i am really soimpressed with that indy line  i sincerely hope it will have a long and healthy life 	positive

what a lovely set i think i have to put this on my wishlistjust for that beautiful woodcutting tank thingie 2008 is gonna get expensive for me	positive
the thing and the set is called jungle cutter and the reason the front pops off is because indy blows it up with a bazooka incase you wanted to know thanks for the nice review	neutral
what a marvelous diversity of plant parts very nice mfs and a cool and detailed harvester that conventionalized cave with its neat opening feature´s also very well done thanks for that fine review of a pretty cool set alex	positive
this is the 3rd review that i had read its very tempting to fly over and get those sets from there because i may need to wait for some months before it arrived it seemed we will have a new small little creature to add into the ranks these red ants is cute and of course looks nasty too haha i love those trees foilage and plants very very much it can be used for my moc and is good for any green project related expansion i love it about the vehicle i find it abit wierd it seemed too big in the setup hehe but still i love this set mainly i will get it for the green parts	positive
heres a review of the second largest set in the dragon masters subtheme for castle month dark dragons den figs the set comes with 3 dragon knights two of which have the dragon wings on their helmetssad thing is one of my knights was missing the left wing on the helmet there are also the definitive dragon wiz the wizard or majisto if you prefertwo horses and a hawk try to find him in each picture the set theres a large spot under the mountain for the dragon to guard the treasure chest the chest has 2 red and green 1x1 circles in it another gate in the back along with a door for knights the right side of the mountain has a ladder and a removable rock face the left side has some stairs leading up to the top i love this tree design simple yet effective a shot of the top hey what are you doing no throw him in the dungeon overall this set when first released in 1993 was priced at 43usd although that might just be because of the juniorised pieces 6 burps its a fun set that provides excellent playability if you can find it at a 2030 price point pick it up overall grade 810 edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0133 pm	positive
this is around the time that many consider the decline of castle in which point i somewhat agree but admittedly it still looks like a very playable set and the tree is very well done thank you for the review	positive
ah the wonderful dragon knight or was it dragon masters sets i personally preferred the black knights but these guys still had some awesome sets thanks for this review this looks like a neat little set although those modern stairs look a little out of place that tree design is indeed a neat one i remember having that in one dark forestmen set i got the interior sure is roomy may i suggest for future review you photograph the set on a cleared table that way you wont get distracted by the clutter in the background and can focus on the main part of the image the set peace	neutral
this is probably one of my favourite sets andor one of the sets which i wish i ownedthe 90s was probably my favourite castle era tobad i was to young to buy this set when it came out man i wish i had one of those dragons they were one of the best type i reckon although all the dragons are good thanks for the reveiw edited by hollisbrick 16 april 2008  0741 am	positive
yay go dragon masters i have to agree with iamded i do like the black knights sets better for their design  betrayal  however the dragon knights are just awesome cause they have dragons this is a nice set with some awesome minifigs and a nice overall design i wish i had it go masters	positive
agent rick youre definately the dragon master around these parts what a great little set i really like the classic dragon which reminds me of a similar style used for the lego crocodiles and the dungeon is pretty slick too i like the use of the large gates plus the doors plus the set contains the blue wizard awesome great review	positive
great classic dragon den i love the old green dragons very much there were my fave i love these theme very much after the black knights era this is a very very good set i wished i can have this too	positive
a very neat set with charming mfs and a great classic dragon a good use of burps and a really nice tree indeed thanks for the review agentrick57	positive
the wizard somehow controls the dragons i think like for example the wizard of the new castle line does with the undead skeletons but i think it isnt sure that the dragon masters wizard is evil as it is still unclear which factions of the older castle series are good or bad	neutral
phoinix on 16 april 2008  0906 pm said this was the last castle set i got before my dark age really liked it although the big rock parts looked really bad  i am kind of used to them now unfortunately i lost the little wand and i never understood who is good and who is bad does the wizard own the dragon well they dont seem to be enemies but isnt the dragon supposed to be evil i always liked the burps i dont know why maybe because they were dark grey and dark grey pieces seemed a bit hard to come by at the time i always assumed that the dragon was sort of the mascot of the dragon masters the wizard was there to keep him under control so he wouldnt turn on them i always figured that the wizard was working with the dragon master king and they were fighting against the royal knights the dudes with the lion faces on their torsos or whatever they were called i like this set a lot i think the castle theme declined after the dragon masters and royal knights themes were discontinued the new knights never really took the cake its funny but it seems to me anyways that when the lego minifigs lost their regular smilesmirk faces whether they were masked by a beard or not thats when lego began to declinea bit the dragon masters had their vicious faces and all but they still had that smilesmirk underneath their rough exteriors the new knights look a littleless confident	positive
i own this set and i think its a great for a smaller fortress building there is a good selection of mini figs the burps do detract somewhat from the set but they do make it feel as if its in a large cave the cloth flags that are included are really nice and mine have lasted a long time	positive
the 8291 dirt bike comes from a long line of technic bikes and i think its the best ever it looks great and its fun to ride around in the house i hoped to find a figure the right size for it but none of mine would fit unlike a lot of technic models it looks good from all angles considering the size of the model it has a complicated way of connecting the engine to the wheel the rear shocks are just the right stiffness and they have a good amount of travel i thought these shocks were new i need to get out more functions shocks two front one stiffer one in the rear drivetrain 2 piston engine linked to the rear wheel via gears and a chainlink steering yes it does stand retractable for the price size and subject what else could be added 1010 parts considering that it has three shocks and a 40 chainlinks its a great set for parts some hard to use large parts are included but they are not overused the usage of the green does limit part usage somewhat though and ill be struggling to find a use for those wheels for anything other than a motorbike 810 price at 3999 aud for 248 parts it isnt the best value set the us price is 2500 which is somewhat better it does have some more complicated parts however 710 looks lego seems to be moving away from the seethough look for technic sets and this is a good example of it im not a big fan of fairings but i think they work great in this set as a fuel tank 810 fudge this set was great for me as i have never had a technic bike however for those that want this for just parts or have other bikes it could be a hard sell the alternate model a chopper is a complete rebuild which i didnt make and its great that lego have been including these most of the time lately 710 overall recommended 810	positive
i think the green motocross bike looks great i like the use of fairings on this bike the only thing i really dont like about the technics bikes in general is the clumsy design of the chaindrive it sticks way to much out to the side if they made a really big bike model it would be more in place with this chain drive im not sure if it wouldnt be possible to design a shaft drive to the rear wheel ala bmw style but the green kawasaki look great with the front and rear suspension i have the street bike 8420 a somewhat larger and more complicated set and will probably add the motocross bike to my collection soon it would be great if lego could make a line of bikes like they do the ferrari line front	positive
i saw this set at my tru for only 2000 now i might go get it thanks sinner for another nice review quote hoped to find a figure the right size for it but none of mine would fit well just sit your booty down and ride it wourself  okay well maybe if you have a bionicle lying around or a halo figure	neutral
a very good review thanks sinner that´s really a pretty cool model very detailed with useful parts too hmm perhaps that one´s gonna get the first technic set i´ll buy beside that 4481 hailfire droid um thank you sinner	positive

best review of a lime green technic dirt bike ever really it is i just dont understand the allure of the bike very much where does the fabuland fig go anyway very insightful review thanks for taking the time and effort to review it for us im not really interested in the set but wanted to support my buddy since i know how much work you put into these now i shall go read the cherry picker one i look forward to it because theres a walrus in it lasse d on apr 22 2008 0455 pm said it must be cold in that room nice shirt but the vertical hold is broken	neutral

sinner on apr 23 2008 1037 am said ill try to take a photo this weekend well i took the photo but didnt get around to posting it here it is with a smaller gear i think it looks better the problem is that its too tight and it doesnt rotate as freely anymore adding another link makes it too loose thus the set is probably the way it is as its the gear that fit best	neutral
simonwillems on may 17 2008 0630 pm said how did i manage to miss this review i must have overlooked it somehow you must have been ignoring me its been in my signature for weeks simonwillems on may 17 2008 0630 pm said it looks a lot like an upgraded version of one of the first bikes lego made namely the 8838 shock cycle i also believe the back gearwheel is somewhat oversized it looks better with the smaller one you attached yes it does seem to be a remake the shock cycle even has a dangly chain like my modded version as a set id prefer the old one due to the four indentical springs	neutral

i wasnt very interested in this set at first it seemed to be just a nice looking truck with a small motor but when i found out it had a transmission i changed my mind here is the transmission it allows the single motor to be used for two functions this system has been around for a while and lego seem to be using it more and more the transmission driving ring alone the red circle goes for 515 usd on bricklink and you also need the catch and clutch gear so i have been buying sets that have them instead i now have enough parts to make a supercar gearbox i bet a new supercar comes out next year now this is the gear that rotates the arm note the colour of the 24 tooth gear it seems to be a new gear trend a lot of work has been put into this truck looking real personally i think they went too far as the truck seems to have been designed for a tilting cab but its disabled to prevent breaking the front bottom of the transmission the bottom shaft lifts the arm note that there are more dark grey gears the motor fits in very well also the bottom of the arm i was surprised by the usage of a 12 tooth bevel to link with the 36 tooth double bevel as i had never seen that done before as you can see there is no room for any drive train standard steering for a recent technic truck there is a handofgod at the cab top that links via two knob wheels it looks good from the back you can also see the white clutch that connects the transmission to the motor to avoid burnouts it goes decently high and can go a bit higher if you use the crane arm compared to last years fire truck if i didnt buy the fire truck for half price i would have been annoyed that lego brought out what is almost a motorised version of the same set functions cherry picker arm motorised rotate and lift that links to a motor via a transmission and antiburnout clutch steering rack and pinion controlled via a handofgod linked by knob wheels doors open and close good functionality that works well but i wish they made the cab lift and im a bit sick of the lame fairing door trick 710 parts motor battery box transmission clutch practical wheels only two fairings compact turntable this is a great parts set 1010 price at 9999 aud for 726 parts its ok value when you consider what you are getting the us price is 6000 which is better but still not great i bought mine for 80 aud which was good however and i suspect that the price is designed for easy sale810 looks id buy this for the looks alone 910 fudge the functions work well and i llked it more than i thought i would oddly mine seemed to be missing a axle pin with friction but since it includes extra parts for the alternate model i didnt mind using one of my spares on the subject of the alternate model it is a dump truck which is made out to be a total rebuild but it isnt it could have easily been done like super street sensation was but lego have probably determined that instructions like that confuse people 810 overall recommended 810	positive

sveltecorps on apr 30 2008 1044 pm said and what everyones been waiting for the skullies  three of em and a conquistador skellie  very cute note the backs of the crystal head have a plumesized hole  or maybe thats just where they injected the blue brainplastic spooky i love these skulls i wasnt sold from the initial pics but they have a very creepy smile and the head shape is just weird with the large eyes its kind of homer simpsonesque they reminded me more of the movie coneheads but i think your description is more accurate looking forward to the rest of the review	positive
the figs look great the natives and the skeleton conquistador are my favorite figures in the set the set itself is very good the interior sort of reminds me of an older style lego set for some reason it could be just me but it has a classic feel this will a great set to add to my list great review so far anyway i only saw the back of the box edited by general zen 01 may 2008  0217 am	positive
thanks sveltecorps i was really hoping that the conquistador helmet would end up being silver in the final set but i suppose its good to know that the helmet is being porduced again anyway and is the armour the skellie is wearing pearl gold thanks again i look forward to the rest of the review edit the dark tan baseplate is in fact very nice although the fact that you have to put stickers on it is a real downer but i suppose it is good for those who want it plain edited by tinypiesrus 01 may 2008  0219 am	positive
looks great i cantt wait until i can get my hands on this and the other new ij sets this is turning out to be a really good theme im really liking the crystal skulls and i also think the baseplate looks very nice those natives look fantastic in my opinion thanks for the great review edited by erdbeereis1 01 may 2008  0253 am	positive
sveltecorps on may 1 2008 0243 pm said hi tinypiesrus  i love that helmet too if only we had plumes again soon hopefully the armour is pearl silver not gold oh sorry my mistake so is it pearl silver as opposed to metallic silver that sure is an odd little vehicle the engine looks nice enough and the rubber treads are always good to have but other than that it really just looks thrown together thanks again svelte edited by tinypiesrus 01 may 2008  0258 am	negative
thanks for the great review sveltecorps ive been wanting to see this set in detail since it debuted at the conventions i have to say that on the one hand i agree that the minifigures the crystal skulls and the colors are great i even like the waterfall but on the other i kind of think that the set itself is a disappointment it looks like they tried to accommodate design and playability needs but really didnt come through on either so as you pointed out the mid section doesnt really fit in with the other parts and the trap sequence doesnt really flow either but perhaps your right and all will be answered in the film i was surprised at just how empty the temple looked in the photo taken from above they really should have gone the extra mile and made the temple look more like a temple and not worry so much about the action features eh but so it goes but i too am a sucker for tombs and temples so i wont be able to pass it up archaeology on	negative

while i truely fell in love one more time with the older lego city sets i thought why not make a review of one of the in my opinion greatest city sets of all time lets not talk too much here we go set nr 6395 name victory lap racetrack number of minifigs 13  number of pieces unknown release year 1988 starting with the beautiful old legoland box front back with some cool alternative models inside we continue with the great minifigs which are not less than 13 i dont think there is any city set with more figures is there civilians race crew  assistant personnel drivers all heres a overview of the whole set the rescue rig dont exactly know how to call it with trailer the score board  traffic lights which would be one of the details i love the most about this set the next sweet detail the camera  cameraman of course we have a doc if there is some kind of accident the pit stop boxes i love the small toolholder with the axle and wheel behind it the control room high above the racetrack ready to go that was it all in allall i can say is if you see this set anywhere on ebay ore somewhere else get it	positive
ahhhh back in the days when shell was the racing fuel of choice before that octan company came to town bought off the old shell execs and ran them out of town on a rail but i digress i always liked the look of the set but at the time could not work out where i would be able to fit it into my town	neutral

i can remember when i saw this set in lego catalogues looking at it dreamin to have it like so many other sets and this one is still a dream i really like the design of this set it looks really complete with some nice details there are no lost place the strairs withe the foot bridge add a lot to it imo looking at the pics ive got a question  is the rescue rig trailer one piece or is it brick build	positive
adiksalego on may 15 2008 0829 pm said wow simon you got two yummy id be happy if i had two no its just one but extended with the baseplate of 6381 mentioned above and some more plates and small fences alex54 on may 15 2008 1020 pm said looking at the pics ive got a question  is the rescue rig trailer one piece or is it brick build it is one piece not even the wheels come off this trailer is always ready to go and was only used in a slecect number of sets	neutral
thank you very much for that fine review of a really classic and wonderful racing set and i really wish that tlc would continue with showing some great alternative models on the back of the boxes just imagine on	neutral
hello all i dont believe there has been a review of this set yet so i wanted to take this opportunity up for review today is 8160 cruncher block and racer x as part of batbrick and iamded reviews here is the box i have to say i love the art on it its very colourful and makes the truck look a lot less crap than it does on the box plus you have to love the missile launching action bit right am i right why are you all staring at me and here is the back pretty generic but shows some nice details and so forth oh dear in turning around the box have i killed myself and iamded okey dokey up first is the best part of the entire set the minifigs racer x is wonderful though coming with a boring bruce wayne face but it is cruncher block his lady driver taejo that really shine look at those awesome suits the cool faces taejo has a ripped shirt now up is the first building part of the set with me and iamded looking rather slick in xs car while im not a big fan of yellow it is very nice and slopes in an underused colour is better than no slopes at all front view the new windshields are fantastic while a very cool car it is rather silly of tlc to give us the exact same one we got in the smaller set i didnt get the smaller set with this car so im still happy but it is a bad marketing move sorry iamded i know its your birthday butvroom now for the second part of the build and my favourite the front of the truck annoyingly enough this part opens up to shoot a pointless rubber projectile to do this you open the roof a nice detail btw and pull back the mechanism here thus blowing the front part open and launching itwell not far really the wheels and covers are pretty cool and the front is nicely designed the red looks good and the rear vision mirrors are a great touch and now for the most disappointing part  step three the trailer note  clicky joint piece not part of set just used to hold it up thats right almost the entire thing is open even the filled in side has holes id certainly be cared to be back there one bumpy hill and back you go i didnt put the lame computer stickers on and the control area is pretty lame in general not to mention taejo who is depicted on the boxart as standing at the desk would most likely just be sucked out the back at those speeds there are some pluses too though like the ridiculously awesome minifig paintings ill be using for wayne manor also note the control on crunchers desk that when turned turns the gun at the bottom its an alright feature here is an example ive shot iamded on his birthday what its a love ray havent you seen the care bears and though im not a massive fan of stickers this is just too cool the little aquarium is very simple but very clever using a printed piece between two clear windows to create the illusion of a tank it looks much better in real life trust me and here is a side view to better explain now to connect the two is a good thing i like the way a simple technic piece assumes the job oh and behold my hand the completed truck which while a mixed bag still doesnt look too bad i guess now the completed set which despite its unbelievable large flaws still looks cool warning the kickass iamded and batbrick figures do not come with this set more pics here httpwwwbrickshelycgii3147324 all in all minifigs 55  racer x is beautiful cruncher block and the driver too and taejo has a ripped shirt damn design 25  pretty poor considering the best part is available in a cheaper set and only the front part of the truck looks cool but still not truly awful build 35  despite having a bad trailer it was a fun build and sometimes you need something that doesnt take ages to make price 25  overpriced easily but rogue shadow is worse fun 35  the mere concept of such an open truck kept me playing with this baby for hours total 1525 not as bad as it would seem overall im really glad i bought it as the minifigs are fantastic and the paintings and fish tank are cool its fun stupid and downright ridiculous but while not a great set by any means certainly isnt as bad in the brick as it looks in photos until next time batbrick away edited by batbrick 13 june 2008  1220 pm	negative
ill be passing on this set thanks for the review anyway is everyone supposed to be bald in the film it looks weird	negative
batbrick thanks for the sweet review you give me great insights into this set hehe i agreed that racer x is nice but i believe we can get it in the other set for a much lower price for me the trailer which does not have a cover is bugging me alot thats why i holding my reservations against this set at most i will consider the other 2 smaller sets for collection purpose nevertheless batbrick great job	negative
thanks for the review my wife wanted me to buy this for the fishtank and i came close untimately this set didnt offer many good part to me so i bought the smaller set with the same car the trailer is just too insubstantial	negative
thank you for the nice review	neutral
i bought this set a few days ago and agree with what you have said about it the trailer is fun to play with but just so plain overall great review	positive
i really like this set my favorite parts are the minifigs and xs car vrooom	positive
i enjoyed the review some cool fleshie heads and parts but it does seem a bit lamer even than i imagined from the box the airy truck is rather slyly disguised on the box art i would like to get it if it is ever on sale 50 off would be nice  speed racer lego doesnt seem to be selling too well in local shops here	neutral

good reviewi think the sets amazing	positive
the batman minifig have a detailed and cool torso thanks for the review brickbitz edited by darkrebellion 16 may 2008  0731 pm	positive
nice review brickbitz i actually think this kit is really very nice for the size true you only get three figures but it seems thats a norm in most batman sets besides everything else is great the tumbler looks like an amazing build  they really nailed this tank of a ride and the ice cream truck plus this set does seem to have some neat pieces in it trans green popsicles and lime hubcaps anyone i think this far beats the rest of the batman lineup this year which seems quite disapointing overall edited by grevious 16 may 2008  0812 pm	positive

trooperdavinfelth on may 16 2008 1111 pm said although i know you dont take many pictures in your reviewsimho  but can we see a little more about the tumbler ill get some set up tomorrow in better light to be honest there isnt a lot to see most of it is just basic technic blocks underneath with all the slopes built up on top	neutral
nice review i really cant believe that it is out already i love that new batman suit and the tumbler have they made the posicles before this is sure a must have	positive
the tumbler is massive ill struggle to fit it into the cave but never mind the figs are nice the tumbler is pretty accurate or at least it will be after ive moded it and jokers tainted ice cream van is so very joker thanks for the review btw	positive
general grievous reviewed by dunamis set 10186 1085 pieces 8995 from lego shop  home build time 35 hours it is the start of summer here in california and along with the weekly deluge of new action films we start to see some of the next wave of star wars lego sets the latest offering from our favorite building toy company is none other than the infamous general grievous no doubt you all know the story of grievous two parts technic and one part human and his hatred of the jedi follow along as we get a closeup view of the mighty general no doubt the observant will wonder why i purchased this set from shop  home instead of my trusty lego store in glendale well it’s really as simple as two things i’ve been traveling a lot and didn’t have time to drive to the store to get it and gas is now 4gallon and i would likely spend more in gas than the 9 shipping cost to get it to me so there you have it the box a gigantic box much larger than expected held the mighty general we’re back to the perforated tabs on the side and two stickers on the front that let the box lift open inside we have 17 bags two manuals and three stickers on a relatively small sticker sheet the manuals the manuals are not terribly thick in fact the second manual is noticeably thinner than the first they come in at 75 and 31pages interesting to note on the back we see the next and more interesting wave of sets later this summer nothing new to report on the manuals as they provide the lego standard of high quality and features we expect  piece callouts  models divided into sections  large images  page numbers since there were links posted to the pdf files of the instructions online i’m sure you can all get an idea of the manual and the parts inventory however for those of you without access to the internet here are photos of the parts inventory pages random manual image features page the pieces the short answer is you get lots and lots of little pieces in white gray and black plus some big pieces in white gray and black mixed in the set is a fair amount of oddball pieces like minifig tools jedi hood and trans yellow dome fear not despite the eclectic collection of parts it all comes together in the end not unlike a typical day at work for me… it is probably worth noting again that there is a heavy amount of technic parts and pieces here the build the build starts off with a rather indepth build of the stand in which general grievous stands on once you think you are done you keep adding on to this rather solid base i bet there are 250 pieces just in the base alone it is quite nice when you get done with it though and really adds to the display i’m glad lego didn’t skimp on the base as it completes the model once you get through all that the rest of the build is a real thumbbruiser anyone who has built a decent size technic set knows the feeling of your thumbs being sore when you are done you get the same effect here it is actually a fun build and i really liked seeing how the designers used all the various pieces to recreate a fairly accurate model of grievous the model is built from the ground up as seen in a few of the progress shots here is what is left over the design the design is quite good and is very accurate some might be disappointed that since this is a technic set we don’t have more articulation in the shoulders and have the ability to separate two arms into four as seen in the movie however it would seem the real intent is for display and not functionality here is a shot of the torso and the detail involved here are grievous’ organs careful observers will note that my model is lacking two “arrow” stickers from the two white chest pieces i failed to see these on the sticker sheet and only grabbed the large grievous sticker so note that there are actually three stickers and not one chest protector and respirator head and arms i was a little disappointed that we got two yellow blades and no green blades on the lightsabers note how all the lightsabers have different hilts which is a nice touch here are some shots of the completed model with a few other sets shown for scale he is actually pretty tall you have the option to remove the top two arms and put in shoulder plates if you so desire detail on the back overall thoughts i’ve been saying for a few years that we should have a technic grievous set and we finally got one designed more as a model and not a fully functional swooshable figure grievous is a tad flimsy you won’t want him to veer too far off his massive and sturdy base it would have been nice to have is cape with him like the technic vader set i do like the size of the model and it is impressive to look at lego star wars system fans will likely want to think twice before purchasing but technic and ucs fans should be satisfied final rating 75 build 810 very good – fun relatively quick build technic fans will be more pleased than others design 810 very good – some nice snot and technic techniques a bit flimsy but the base is kind of cool parts 710 a mixed bag of stuff probably can’t get too many diverse builds from this except for other robot type models price 710 just ok – a bit stiff at 90 usd for a nice display model with limited functionality as always let’s hear your thoughts and feedback	positive
excellent review dunamis this set looks great the designers really though the kit out it seems the internal organs have got to be my favorite part but everything is good now all we need is a ucs obiwan with a laser pistol to finish off grievous in a totally anticlimatic way	positive
hey dunamis think you can get a straighton shot of the face the red pieces inside the eye sockets are topped with transgreenishyellow studs which make his face look eerily alive and very close to his screen appearance its a nice little detail that seems to not show through on pictures ive seen of the set the legs are a little wobbly im scared that hell be leaning too far forward in about 5 years	neutral
nice review dunamis  i built it two weeks ago on the legoworld speedbuild in oslo and didn´t have time to get the feel during that crazy race i agree with you that the base is nice  sturdy makes it stand real still  i´m looking forward on your next score four eyes arms on copmike	positive

cool i like the idea of using the hood as an organ dunamis reviews on	positive
thanks for that fine review dunamis i really like that set gg´s an interesting and well designed movie character and that lego version of him´s indeed well done and very detailed and although i would wish for a some more functional or playable  feature of move and even splitable arms i guess it´s an already very cool ucs version of that grumpy old kaleesh	positive

hi yall guess what happened today when walked into my toys r us in fullerton ca just to buy a simple tiny turbo racer what do i see all the agents sets sitting on the shelf ready for the taking i didnt have too much money with me so i just got 2 of 8631 mission 1 jetpack pursuit its a really cool little set so i thought id review this puppy for you i shall proceed in the order of the instructions so lets get started the minifigs lets begin with the minifigs saw fist and agent chase they are really cool some of the coolest minifigs i have seen in a while i took off saw fists wig  chainsaw so you can see his head and cybernetic arm better here is a back view of saw fist and  surprise agent chase has a double sided head one side with his cool mission face with sunglasses and headset and one with his casual bruce wayne type face note though that it is not really the bruce wayne face his wig btw is mutts hairpiece in black very neat poor saw fist seems to be forced to always drag his chainsaw around for it is way too long to just hang down from his shoulder like a normal arm the snowmobile next up we have the snowmobile a sleek little vehicle with only minor design flaws the container with the jewel is attached to the vehicle by a single stud so it doesnt fall off but is easy to pick up in the pic below you can see the only two tiny design flaws thanks to the exhaust pipes the laser cannon or whatever its supposed to be cant be lowered any further than this also the corners of that slopeish piece that the handle bar rests on are sticking out a little at the sides other than that its pretty well done the jetpack finally there is the jetpack imo a name like autogyropack or something would make more sense but whatever although a little bulky the jetpack is very well designed the rotor can be tilted back and at the lower back of the jetpack there is hook with which you can grab the container with the jewel from the snowmobile what i like best about the jetpack is that although it is attached to the minifig in kinda the same way as that of the riddler this one doesnt rotate around so the agent is being held in place steadily see ya later chainsawcyborgdude stickers this set comes with a surprisingly large sticker sheet the reason is that half of it are extra stickers there are two large agents logos and one inferno logo  perfect for agents mocs there are also a star and a small round sticker portraying the number of the mission the star seems to be part of some kind of game where you collect the stars from all sets on an agents id that you get from the mission 5 set i dont know though if you get any gain from this except for becoming a fullstatus lego agent below you can find the list of parts from this set click here for a better quality pic thats pretty much it i hope you liked this review and will run straight to your next toy store to get one or more of this set this was my very first set review so any questions comments or requests any more pics you want me to take would you like me to exchange the chainsaw with something else or do you want me to try the agents new hairpiece out on another fig if so just tell me see ya edited by oky wan kenobi 25 june 2009  0821 pm	positive
thanks for the excellent review oky judging by this set the line is going to be promising i really like the figs and im glad to see that robot arm is actually a new arm mold awesome can a minifig hand fit in the end or just the chainsaw attachment could it fit an exoforce robot claw theres a lot of detail in the torsos and i like that the agents suit is like a motocross uniform i love that the snowmobile has a working tread copmike ras and i tried to build a snowmobile with working treads but we ended up using chainsaw blades in the end great work oky	positive
thats a great review for your first one i think the jet pack if far to bulky it could do with some minimising but that’s life i assume that you can’t fit a standard hand in the chainsaw arms are the hole would be to large but would you be so good as to confirm this for me overall i quite like the jet ski and the ability to lower the arms to much doesn’t both me how much was it just so i can get an idea of the price finally thanks for posting this review so quickly	neutral
this is much much much more promising than the 2008 batman set for 1000 the vehicle looks like someone took time to design it but the batman one looks like  lego dear lego where is the quality for batman i really like the new cyborg arm and the propellers on that thing   it is a really promising line although i would get rid of all those bionicle pieces	positive
thanks for the great review oky wan the two vehicles look quite nice for a small set and the minifigs look great the two sided head is nice although it wouldve been nice if it was a new head rather than the standard frowning face the cyborg looks good nice and cartoony i like the printing on his back the belt on the hips should be useful not to mention the robotic hand i assume that anything that fits into a 1x1x1 cylinder can fit in it i hope so thanks again oky any chance you can get any more sets	positive
this set looks wicked thanks very much for the sweet review oky wan the pics are perfect great quality and the perfect size well done this sets got everything a new hairpiece tank treads a gem well i could go on but you can all see everything from the great pics thanks again oky this is one set ill definately be getting peace	neutral
thanks guys i really tried to make it a good first review now to answer your questions the robot arm can fit ef robot claws and anything that a minifig can hold in his hand or that would fit into a 1x1x1 cylinder so normal minifig hands are too small to fit tlg is using the robot claw idea for the main villain of the agents line do you still want me to try it out and take pics the price was 1099 usd at the tru i bought it at i bet itss be a dollar less on sh and im sorry but i probably wont get any more sets any time soon i have to save my money for all the other good set that are to come but if i would get another set it would just be the one with the helicopter and the allsilver car if anyone gets this set can heshe please review it thanks any other questions i can answer for you guys edited by oky wan kenobi 18 may 2008  0859 am	neutral
oky wan thanks for this wonderful review i really have mixed feelings towards agents set haha but i love the agent minifigure the doublesided face is great and i love the sunglass look its nice that they made use of mutts hairpiece which is personally my fave hairpiece at the moment the jetpack is neat making use of the additional secure backing onto the minifig is really very smart	positive
nice first review oky wan  i´d say this is better than we first thought the minifigs looks cool and the overall look is ok and the excaustpipe is a new peace also i think agents on copmike	positive

i love the way the bad guy has a special attachment on the jewel case just to allow the agent to grab it with his hook its like the two of them sat down beforehand and drew up the plans for the vehicle together cyborg ok and then ill make my getaway in the special snowmobile and you can follow me agent and ill scoop up the jewel and return it to foil your plan cyborg perfect see you tuesday dr s	positive
good review thanks oky wan hmm although i really like the villain not just the new arm i think the color is very villanous as all bondvillains with class have minions in uniforms its even possible to fill out their numbers with exoforce grunts of the same color im not that hot for the agent himself his uniform nah it doesnt even look like clothes just give the man a suit or some nifty leather i think ill try to grab some sets from the agents line just for the new parts to begin with mocs may follow who knows when they are available in stores here in sweden havent seen them yet though indiana jones just got here so there might be some further waiting for me now i want to see reviews of the other sets 	negative

wow thanks for the great review sirnadroj the overall set is what attracted me in the first place that elevated hut and swampy setting just sucked me right in it all looks really nice to me a definite buy that agents head would make a great indy for those opposed to fleshies and that monobrow i mean villain guy looks very er well the monobrow is unique thought i noticed the suit looks a bit skin tight in the crotchal area dont look at me like that you saw it too anyway the helmets the best part about the villain great for warhammer 40000 orks peace	positive

thanks for an interesting review theriddler the set´s cheap and very useful to get two fantastic mfs a great mr freeze and a very cool new batman but i have to say that these two small vehicles just look plain ugly imho without any inspiration nor orginality sorry tlc but you can for sure do better than that and even with less pieces	neutral

thanks for the review ill probably get one copy of this set mr freeze and his cart look neat i dont like the huge wing on the back of batmans buggy so ill probably mod that out	neutral
quote but i have to say that these two small vehicles just look plain ugly imho without any inspiration nor orginality indead the only reason to get this set is if you couldnt afford the batcave back in 2006 and want a mr freeze fig for a cheap price and anyone who did get that kit really have no reason whatsoever to get this wait did i forget something oh yeah  thanks for the review riddler edited by grevious 22 may 2008  1154 pm	neutral
grevious on may 23 2008 0954 am said indead the only reason to get this set is if you couldnt afford the batcave back in 2006 and want a mr freeze fig for a cheap price and anyone who did get that kit really have no reason whatsoever to get this ill get it i admit the vehicles are extremely poorly designed i mean really poorly designed but the mrfreeze fig is fantastic and i would buy two of this set just for him as his head and gear are very useful for mocing it also comes with some nice pieces like the grappling hook little wheels exhaust pieces and such still a pretty bad set build wise but it has atleast inspired me to make my own batbuggy thanks for the review theriddler appreciated batbrick away	positive
as others have said this really is a set for those that didnt buy the batcave thus i want it the cars are pretty horrid though thanks for the review theriddler	neutral
thanks for the review for such a high price that we need to fork out compared to a total pieces of 76 its is very expensive to pay for such poor design but then i will still considered to get them as what sinner had said this is a very good way to get mr freeze without getting the batcave and it so happened that i do not have the batcave too i believed that is the cheapest set among the four so for the minifigs only this set is recommended other than that i am sorry	neutral
thanks for the review theriddler this is a neat little set a bit overpriced in my opinion but for a new suited batman and a mr freeze fig in a set other than one of the most expensive batsets released its worth my money peace	positive
wowie im glad you like it maby il do the tumbler also but soon the batcycle and the scuba also come	neutral
pretty nice review for a first time theriddler next time though if your camera has it use the macro function little flower icon and perhaps a tripod that should get rid of any blur and provide you with better pictures apart from that a good little review keep up the good work	neutral
neat little set i do like the parts a number of hard to find bits all in one pack depending on how much it costs in usd ill have to consider it and while the buggy designs kinda suck im a little happy to see them its been years since tlc made any small go kart style vehicles i guess tiny turbos have been overshadowing that market	positive
thanks for the reveiw the figs are bloody great but those cars are a bit well ill put it blantly retarded although they shall be good after some modding and whats with that grapple hook does it even have a rope so i guess batman will hokk it to mr freeze so his ride looks more ugle anyway can you pleese take some pics of the figs	neutral
thats a great set itd be even better if it were sold as two separate little cars they remind me of the dozens of little lego cart vehicles i got as a kid those were always fun quick builds that resulted in lots of cool play i think this set is aimed more at kids and in that respect its a pure winner it doesnt hurt that you can get freeze and the newly designed batman both in this set for a reasonable price	positive
thanks the penguin and more pics on monday	neutral
the pics as promised extra part	neutral
in actuality i think that this may be my favorite batman set of all time i know i know  its a small set with crappy tiny vehicles so it probably sucks for the fan who likes to display sets but look at the mocing side and you see this set has a ton of potential new batman fig well mainly the torso but it looks nice sleek and armored a definite plus whether youre a mocist or batfan mr freeze because nobody bought the batcave when they should haveand by nobody i mean me plus i love that head cheapest way to amass the lightning piece the other sets that have it are lolhueg well not really but i dont have 50 to toss around on a little skeleton tower and its a great piece two little blue gems i may be alone on this but those are my favorite parts the gems and thats my favorite color for them 3 3 3 several other useful parts including a o piece in black some lightmedium blue bits from mr freezes kart the oddly placed grappling hook and some cheap wheels now i dont know about you guys but this is as close to a batman battlepack as were going to get lol  im buying at least three maybe more once i get my summer job  oh and the fact that the us price is only 10 helps a little but this year you guys cant complain  you got practically every set first especially the new castle tt trexxen	positive
thanks for the review i dont know if i would get this set though the cars are not that great and the price is a little too high	negative
i got this yesterday and built it this morning apart from the figs it is very crappy mr freezes buggy is ok but the bat buggy is easily the worst vehicle ive seen for years colours are all over the place the grappling hook feels cheaply made the inclusion of those odd pearl silver parts which have been in the exoforce sets seem especially random here the terrible bionicle flame piece its the first lego vehicle ive built where ive immediately had the urge to disassemble it and pretend i never bought it really i only got it for mr freeze so i shouldnt complain but still its a real step backwards the comparable catwoman dragster set was heaps better the penguin sub is sweet though thanks for the review anyway	negative
looks cool one of the best in this line cant wait for review	positive

deinonychus on may 23 2008 1012 pm said pics and thoughts tomorrow i picked up this set earlier in the week and was quite pleased with it in fact i have missions 15 and am happy with all of them  this series is much better than the old alpha team ever was i look forward to reading your thoughts on it i will say 2 things about it now though 1my set came with defective instructions in 2 places pages are missing and duplicates of other pages repeated for instance the car instructions are missing steps 1621 fortunately i was able to make out what pieces went where in the missing steps by studying the illustration in step 22 i hope you have better luck with your instructions 2this set contains the best lego sound brick ever its just begging to be incorporated into my arkham asylum	positive

great review deino man that car is just so beautiful and the helicopter is nice too unfortunately this seems pretty pricy and i hardly think ill be getting it any time soon what with my limited budget and all still its great to see how well agents is shaping up	positive
thanks for the review deino i love going back through the old agents thread just to see how wrong we were about these awesome sets i actually really like the gate those portcullis pieces people may know i always find nice uses for and i really really really want that awesome sound brick the figs are a bit disappointing in numbers but agent chase is very cool generic henchman are great and spy clops is one of my favourite minifigs ever the helicopter is wonderful too i love that it is customised for spy clops to winch him down the colours as usual for these sets are fantastic the dark blue orange and chrome silver the car is the best though i love all the functions how does the ejector seat work though batbrick away	positive
thanks for the awesome review deinonychus this really is a sweet set a bit expensive a set for me as i only get the cheaper noncastle sets which is a shame because i love that head it would be great for some more cyborg troops the car is awesome i didnt expect it to have that many silver parts thats fantastic heaps of play features too that ejector seat mechanism sounds interesting thanks again for the sweet review peace	positive
deinonychus on may 23 2008 0912 pm said the rear has two cones sticking out id like to think theyre smoke nozzles or oilslick sprayers according to page 14 of my brickmaster magazine the left cone is for smoke screen and the right cone is for oil slick	neutral
wow great review thanks this set looks absolutely great but im afraid of the price oh weel ill just get the 2 smaller ones im really liking this theme well done tlg	positive
esjpg 4794k 110 downloads the ejector seat a long technic axle runs the length of the front of the car it comes in to the seat area here and nests into the gray joint which is attached to the small gray technic beam the beam is attached to the ejector seat bottom white 3x2 plate with a technic pin the seat in turn is attached to the side of the car with a technic pin the result is when the axle is pushed forward the gray joint and beam tilt the seat and eject a minifig after about 20 shots the minifig only went outside of the car 3 timesthe rest of the time he just bounced around the inside of the car so they get an a for effort but an f for execution	neutral
thanks deinonychus for another great review i must say i do look forward to people uploading reviews of new sets it really helps me decide if i want it or not if its a good set imo then it adds to the excitement of picking up one myself this i must say is one of those sets the only concern for me like alot of others is the price i will just have to wait and see and continue to look at these photos deinonychus has provided for us so much for thinking the agent line was going to be weak i wonder if the exoforce style code brick number plate is a hint from tlc as to what will replace exoforce at the end of this year jb	positive
thanks for the great review im really liking these agents sets the more i see them the car seems to have alot of features its to bad the the ejection seat doesnt work as well as one would hope oh well makes me want the big rig even more now	positive
thanks for your great review it looks very nice indeed the gate have very interesting mechanism the car looks very slick and cool it looks like those typical kind of james bond car this review gives me very good insights	positive
great review deinonychus i really like it can someone record the sound os the sound brickmaybe on youtube i really want to hear it this sets are really cool deino can you post a picture of the agent card it comes with	positive

hello all eurobricks members i will present to you a very short review on the recent castle battlepacks this time i will be reviewing skeleton battlepack and i hope everyone of you do enjoy viewing it this was a request that put up by hollisbrick in the castle thread initally i thought it was a very simple set to do a review however for the love of castle i decided to whip this up for every castle fan out there this is an image of how the skeleton battlepacks look like i have bought 12 last packs of these in total so far but none of the crown battlepacks yet there were snapped much faster that i imagined do pardon me for the poor lightning today is a bad weather its hard to get natural light the skeleton gang for a single battlepack like this with an attractive reasonable price you obtained a series of 5 skeleton minifigs with tons and tons of useful castle accessories to me its a very very great buy and its a must to stock up for my army building some addons however i was not very satisfied with my skeleton armies standards therefore i decided to make some slight modifications with some additional castle accessories that is stocked in my castle warehouse after the makeover ok this is what i called a real skeleton army this is mainly my opnion and it have to be aligned with my standards i felt this improved battlepack gives a punch to the exisitng battlepack the two soliders on the right is able to align with the rest of my castle chess sets armies while the one on the left it gives me a great archer back up with the quiver and helmet attached to him the ones on the center especially the armored guard which equipped with the black nose cone helmet is my fave it is able to illustrate the elite among the rest of the guards with its armor and helmet which was featured in my castle deep forest expansion moc promotion on in addition the one which was hastly done with a modify mace it looks rather simple in time to come i will change it and gives a better equipment and look these are the remains i can use the axe for my dwarf in my dwarf mine defender in that set there is no weapon for my dwarf and i have to get it from other sets the rest of the accessories makes a very good stock up for future upgrading overall 910 this is not a playset it is mainly bought for its abilty to mass recurit any armies and is a main love for all castle army builders such as me this set mainly have no major faults and i love it so much although i have done some slight modifciations but this set is a must for me to buy more and more meanwhile i will need to wait for the next shipment hope everyone have enjoying viewing this simple review of mine edited by whitefang 25 may 2008  1252 pm	positive
dragonator on may 25 2008 0821 pm said thanks for the review whitefang i love these sets and i wish they were available in nz so far it seems they may never come here but i can sit and hope i like the look of them after your makeover a real skeleton army there did you say youve bought 12 thts lots of skelies are you planning a big moc or something no problem i had bought it last month i thought it was so simple to do a review for this was looking through the thread then i realised there is a request for it it was an unexpected shipment that send to singapore it came in very limited quantity most of the battlepacks were snapped within a day or two when it arrived well i am thinking of building something big in the future its just a plan that i have not decided yet for me i always love to see the beauty of a big army with different battalions forming a kingdom thats why i always buy many many sets that have figures that attracts me and for this battlepack it served a very good purpose for it	neutral
thanks whitefang castle battle packs simply wonderful finally a dream came true well done tlc	positive
thanks whitefang i love this battlepack but can only really hope to get one still great accesories and a spider thats great batbrick away	positive
no offence make this 799 can too expensive to be coming with only a few figures 20 earns you the same amount of figs plus a catapult barricade two horses and a jousting divider	negative
sdpirate on may 26 2008 1040 am said no offence make this 799 can too expensive to be coming with only a few figures 20 earns you the same amount of figs plus a catapult barricade two horses and a jousting divider are you refering to these following sets both these sets adds up to 1800 cad and the skeleton pack have the same price of 1800 cad prices quoted from sh i understand that 7009 and 7090 offers more pieces horses and same amount of minifigs compared to a typical battlepack imo i feel that all 3 sets are all army building sets 7009 offer small catapult 3 minifigs a skeleton white horse 7090 offer a joust divider weapon rack good accessories 2 minifigs a horse with barding and a skeleton black horse these sets have different purpose for me buying multiples of 7009 is to build its catapult white skeleton calvaries while 7090 is to build on crown calvaries and black skeleton calvaries however battlepacks have a different agenda it offered some castle accessories that is not available commonly for a castle army builder like myself castle accessories are always in demand the black robe silver armor silver shortaxe are not very common castle accessories it can be used as a good stock up too i am not saying this battlepack is an one way solution to solve everything thats why different sets are released to target on different purposes	neutral
whitefang although i realize that the battle packs are great specifically for building armies and castle accessories which is why its such a shame that i wont be able to buy these things  while sdpirates sets are more for a catapult calvary whatever the fact to the matter is with the battle pack you get 5 minifigs with lots of accessories while with the sets that sdpirate showed us you get 5 minifigs with an okay amount of accessories 3 horses including two skeleton ones a ballista a weapons rack and a jousting barricade you cannot say that the battle pack contains the same amount of stuff that the other two sets have and therefore should be priced the same it just seems that lego is ripping off canadian army builders to me if the battle pack contained a small catapult or wall so that it contained about the same amount of stuff that the other sets had it would be fair it seems stupid that you will only get minifigs from one set while you can get about the same amount of minifigs plus a bunch of other stuff from two other equally priced sets that’s why to me these battle packs are a rip off because of what they contain imho the battle packs seem to be only worth about 10 dollars	neutral
thanks for the review whitefang your additions look great i like your mace much better than the use of a small technic cog your looks much sturdier and that helmet looks really great on skellie soldiers i never thought to use that before very cool indeed peace	positive
mack on may 26 2008 0130 pm said you cannot say that the battle pack contains the same amount of stuff that the other two sets have and therefore should be priced the same it just seems that lego is ripping off canadian army builders to me if the battle pack contained a small catapult or wall so that it contained about the same amount of stuff that the other sets had it would be fair it seems stupid that you will only get minifigs from one set while you can get about the same amount of minifigs plus a bunch of other stuff from two other equally priced sets that’s why to me these battle packs are a rip off because of what they contain imho the battle packs seem to be only worth about 10 dollars mack i can understand your concern when pricing is concerned pricing is always a big issue for us to determine whether to buy or not to buy a certain set in a particular country pricing varies differently across different countries such as us europe canada australia and etc this is something very hard for us to decide on we cant be sure why tlc placed their pricing strategies this way well i think we should appericate what tlc is trying to do for us by not using price as the only factor to judge whether to buy this set or not at least i am sure there are many of us trying to request for battlepacks to muster armies for their mocs armies collection and etc different people have different judgements towards different sets and different themes i respect your opnion imo lets dont let price be the only determined factor to decide whether to purchase a particular set or not instead consider an array of factors that is offered however i do know that consumers like me and you are always affected by price iamded on may 26 2008 0140 pm said thanks for the review whitefang your additions look great i like your mace much better than the use of a small technic cog your looks much sturdier and that helmet looks really great on skellie soldiers i never thought to use that before very cool indeed iamded i am glad you enjoyed the review and my slight modifications that mace was a much looking weapon it looks much firm than the orignal look the design was inspired from dwarf mine and dwarf mine defender i would not want to have so many troll flags hanging around the nose cone helmet was to give the soliders a whole new look to me it retains the classic look yet it belongs to present theme suitable for my skeleton elite guards	negative
sorry to be going a little off topic here but personally i have just bought 40 crowny battle packs for the only reason that i am running out of space to store the left over blocks about 500 of my crownies came from sets mentioned above on sale which would have been cheaper than the battle packs thanks for the review whitefang but i dont think i will be buy any skeleton battle packs that army is large enough	neutral
for those of you who buy so many of this and the other battle pack with crownies what do you do with all of them is this simply to create a largescale army or do you plan to build large castle scenes with all the figs id love to see some pictures on the share your castle army thread	neutral

a real classic thanks for that nice and funny review voltio a well designed set very playable with a lot of nifty traps a very good use of that raised baseplate and really nice crafts the mf characters´re excellent too and although the color scheme´s great and original especially with all these neat printed pieces it´s perhaps the only part of that set that looks a little out of date today nevertheless the set´s plain charming and shows clearly that tlc don´t need licenses to do some distinct adventurer sets	positive

great review i just barly missed the jungle series growing up with half a year of jungle and mainly orient expedition and dino island i like egypt more but this set despite the 4x4 palm tree is practically perfect i love the detail and vibrant colours gotta say ive got a thing for pippin reed myself by the way what does vhtf mean edited by sdpirate 28 may 2008  0106 am	positive
vhtf very hard to find to answer some earlier replies no there are no stickers in this set while some adventurers sets of the era had stickers the 5956 zeppelin had tons all of the interesting mesoamerican designs from this set are printed also simonwillems was correct my mechanic is missing his hat which should be a black kepi theyre extremely expensive on bl though proving once again that this set has some awesome parts so i ordered a replacement from lego its in the mail and should come soon	positive
the printed pieces are the real gems of this set beyond them there isnt much to this set though the boat hull is nice the model itself isnt all that great the new akator temple is definately a superior model at least in piece count but those printed pieces are hard to resist steve	negative

i just rebuilt this entire set today and the nostalgia was totally worth taking bits and pieces from a few of my own mocs only now did i realize how rare some of those pieces are and im rather thankful that i have all of the printed pieces and achu the only pieces i am missing is a transparent orange headlight 3 out of 4 black minifigure hammer light gray chainreplaced it with a dark gray chain and one whole minifigure which is the mechanic guy i still have both the instructions and the box and both are in appalling conditions kudos to the pre2000s lego sets like this one love em	positive

welcome to cardinal bricks review of 7736 its a small set but as i bought it the other day i felt that it probably did merit a short review the box is ofcourse far larger than necessary theres plenty of air inside the contence is one bag and the instruction booklet you could proably build it inside the bag if the desire took you we have one new coastguard with the slightly stubly head found in the castle range and a transclear visor the build was challanging and arduious the final product is quite nice at one 300 its a good set only 50p more than an impulse set and with enough extra parts to justify the increase in the price a good set for a little gift or so on the buggy moves well theres not that much to say really for i cant really think of additional models to build with the parts but then what do you expect for the price edited by cardinal brick 26 may 2008  0647 pm	positive

so i just piced up a new digital camera and i thought what better way to try it than doing a review of my newest set the new 7738 coast guard helicopter itsmy first review so go easy on me lets start off with the small stuff first the mini figs you get 4 figs total two helicopter pilots a diver and a civilan to rescue the torsos are nothing new on the pilot and diver same ones as in the last coast guard line but i like the colors alot better in this coast guard line than the previous generation the yellow and blue really work well together and the coloring on the badge looks great the civilian looks to be just a dock worker with an overall torso and a beenie the diver has nice vented helmet and a pair of flippers that suits his duty perfect next we have an absolute work of lego art the rescue raft the orange flaps can be moved back for easy entry to the raft as well as the white support beams with the caution tape i put support in perenthaces cause they really dont support anything just there to fill in the gaps at the top of the raft is a red locator beacon ccommunications antenna and a cargo loop for lifting the raft lets move on to the interior of the raft not much here but you can see the techinc beam that attaches to the top loopand to the floor of the raft so far this has proven to be very sturdy and has supported the full weight of the raft quite well you can also see the white box that holds the equipment of the raft here you can see the life saver tube heres a shot with our dock worker peaking out the side the raft says max ocupants 4 but with the storage box that might be a tight fit now lets move on to the helicopter in my opinion this is one of the best helicopters tlc has come out with to date i really felt they captured the look and proportions of a real coast guard helicopter it uses a lower hull and tail section of the new airliner and cargo airplane it really seems to work well with this application the engines have good detail using new cheese graders as vents as well as the new engine stacks that come in the new speed racer sets the rotors also appear to be new as well lets move on to the cockpit we have two seats for our pilots with a sticker sheet for intruments on a flat 4 wide plate theres also an antena being used as a flight stick another shot with our pilots at the helm now lets moveon to the high lihgt of this heavy lifting machine the med bay and lifting winch httpwwwbrickshelicopter020jpg here you can see the winch arm at rest along with the medical strechter the bad part is that the med strechter doesnt include the ussually included fold away wheels heres a shot with the winch arm extened ready for rescue in the second shot you can see the drum that the wire coils up in it coils up via a recently new power functions pull back motor to operate just pull out the winch cable hook on your load and presse this orange button on the side the bad part of the new power functions winch is that although its very smooth in its operation its not very strong it will only lift the raft a couple inches before it runs out of torque it also has a tendency to want to pull the crane arm backin while its lifting it doesnt matter if its a light load or heavy load the bay doors open on both sides for easy postioning of the figures and accses to the strechter here we have our diver looking over his rescuee nice and roomy if you dont mind a crane arm being in your way at 3999 and a peice count of 445 i felt this set was a great good considering what your getting the raft construction is very creative and is probbly the highlight of the set by itself the helicopter is probbly one of the best if not the best helicopter tlc has ever came out with if you can get over its size in a scale of one to five price peice count playability design overall 5 i would have given it a full 5 out of five but since the winch cant pull the raft all the way it didnt fell it right even with this minor flaw i still highly recomend this set	neutral
wow i was skeptical of this coast guard line though getting to see some detailed pictures of this set i really want to get get it alas i have not the money to get it and it isnt available in my town oh well maybe i can catch it on a sale at some point good review	positive
great reveiw this is definatly one of the cg sets im geting i cant wait to get my hands on this set	positive
great review 5150 lego the new camera was well worth it you´ve got everything well done i´m looking forward to your next review meschepers on may 27 2008 0622 am said wow i was skeptical of this coast guard line though getting to see some detailed pictures of this set i really want to get get it same here maybe in two days i can see it in real	positive
nice review a must have for my city collection	positive
thank you very much for the nice review 5150 lego the helicopter is  apart from that it is very very big and that it does not include any interior  a very nice set  the most i like the life raft becuase it is simply  nevertheless i dont know if i buy it probably not  but its very nice two questions  where can you fasten the stretcher on to haul it up and down is the motor working with batteries klausdieter edited by klausdieter 28 may 2008  0919 pm	neutral
great review 5150 although you might want to resize your pictures before posting them so they dont take forever to load quote wow i was skeptical of this coast guard line i was actually the complete opposite ever since i saw the first pictures i fell in love with the whole line the helicopter looks to be one of the two best in the line right up with the 4wd and jetski great job tlc and i do hope you have something equally as great planned for next year	neutral
very nice job on the review 5150 i definitly like this set much better now that i have seen good pics of it i am definitly picking this up as soon as i can again great review  model on	positive
thank you for that fine review of a really excellent set 5150 lego i never saw a little juniorization done that good before	positive
nice review the helicopter reminds a sikorsky chopperisnt it	positive
i could tell from the pictures that a lot maybe all the designs on the raft were stickers in the whole set are there any printed parts besides the torsos or is it all stickers	negative
5150 lego on may 29 2008 0712 am said thanks everyone for the nice coments its nice to finaly have a camera that can take some decent photos makes doing reviews much more enjoyable there is no real way to lift up the stretcher due to the crane arm being in the way there really isnt any room for any kind oflifting straps the set does include a 1x2 plate with a hinge for the diver to stand on so at least he can hold on to someone the crane lifts them up and then he can put them in the strechter thats my guess at least as far as the motor i dont believe it uses bateries since you pull out the motor and all the button does is recoil the winch line back in i have to say it does a very good job of that and is very smooth as long as you dont have anything to heavy one detail i forgot to meation is the shark its nothing new just the basic shark lego has had around for nealy 2 decades but it was a detail nothing less thank you very much for that information 5150 lego	neutral
this is a very good review thank you but i have some questions about the grey new parts in the life raft are they 1x1 like their counterparts with the clips or 1x2 and can they be held by a minifig by the handle if so these could be very useful for brickbuild weapons  tools also im looking forward to some orange eta 2 jedi interceptor mocs now who wants to be the first to make one btw which jedi has an orange eta 2	positive

thanks for the nice review theriddler a neat and funny ice cream truck and a pretty detailed yet perhaps a little big tumbler an overall cool set for sure	positive
uncle jokers cheap technic missile surprise great review however there isnt much appeal to the set after you see what the surprise is though i can modify the truck to have an evil gasice cream making interior	neutral
the stickers ruin the tumbler but the truck is very good if it was cheaper id get it	negative
i am gonna have to pick this up what a grand representation of the tumbler and it would be my first joker minifigure my lego batlife is looking up tnr	neutral
looks like a nice set thanks for the review i cant get over how enormous the tumbler is they should have made it smaller the price too i fthey did that and threw in a dark knight joker and henchman i would totally buy it enjoy your new set darthperson	neutral
thanks for the review theriddler i am going to see if this set is at meijer and i will buy it if it is and i am reviewing the harley truck right now and i will post a review later	positive
i have been thinking about buying this set just for the tumbler and now i am sold one more set for the shelf great review	positive
4olic on aug 28 2009 0659 am said if you do not have this set i highly recomend it if i could i would trust me i havent seen one with figs for under 200 looking at this review actually makes me sad	positive
thank you for clearing that up i felt that it was ok to review an old topic as stated rather than just go ahead and start a new one a shame that this set as all other batman sets have gone up so highly in value but still all things considering general after market lego price hikes it is still a wonderfull set even with its market value today that is if you can ignore the mrsp	positive
i too thought the jokers van was the pleasant surprise of this set the tumbler looks good yes until you see it in person its grossly oversized they should have made it closer to a regular car size like the movie because this one is a monster	neutral
i bought this off ebay while not having been collecting space as a child it was mainly wild west and city i have decided upon reading kdogs mtron bar brawl mania strip in his space comic to buy as many mtron sets and figures i could find except i got distracted and bought some different sets as well to start off with heres a picture of the box heres a general shot showing the entire set a front view the buggy another shot of the buggy without the minifig the flyer the flyer without the minifig mtron crate with some equipment and hoses i dont know the use of the hoses though  the cockpit open the cockpit closed with the crew the magnetic crane another shot of the crane rear view with hatch open one of the side slots that can carry either the buggy or the flyer top view of this excellent vehicle excellent for getting spyrius or blacktron out of your way  final shot excellent set one of the biggest space ground vehicles and one of the best sets made by lego undoubtably better than its newer counterpart the mt101 armored drilling unit a great addition to any collection and has a lot of cool neat features that make it have a lot of playability simply excellent five out of five	positive
sinner on may 28 2008 0235 pm said care to explain why the mcm has a pure weight of parts that i find hard to quantify but love it is just so dense when you build it full of nice surprises no technique required and a wonderful stearing mechanism that i rank as more important than the suspension of the mars version this thing was meant to crush anyway who needs suspension i also like the way you never felt that the mtrons deserved a base after building this it was that good the colour scheme was perfect its space and i like it enough said great review btw god bless nathan naturally youre entitled to your inferior opinion	positive
thanks for those wonderful pictures and congrats i think buying this on ebay was a good decision i have no mtron sets at all but i like the mcm very much its just a wonderfully big set with many nice detials lots of playing possibilities i wish i had it too	positive
i love the design of the front canopy of this set but i always felt that they could have done more with the rest of the model this set is good candidate for customization though there is quite a bit on unused space inside especially in the middle section i want to try putting a technicstyle engine into mine at some point along with the necessary gearing i got my mcm brand new off ebay some years ago for a pretty good price but the box was very worn out and the big transneon panel which floats freely inside the box was a bit damaged as for the hosejetpack things i always assumed that they were either welding torches or flamethrowers take your pick quote kinda sad to think that with tlcs recent ban on magnets in their products first time ive heard of that what are they going to do for the train couplings	neutral
cp5670 on may 28 2008 0852 pm said first time ive heard of that what are they going to do for the train couplings new couplings are going to be available soon there is a thread with pictures of the new couplings here	neutral
joebot on may 28 2008 0731 pm said kinda sad to think that with tlcs recent ban on magnets in their products since when is that the new train couplings have magnets only with a special casing anyways mtron is one of the greatest space factions with mega core magnetiser as my favourite set of these guys even though i do not own it  the only thing that bothers me is the lack of reachable controls for the minifigs to drive their vehicles but iirc it is the same with a lot of other spacesets as well	positive
fluyt on may 28 2008 0156 pm said since when is that the new train couplings have magnets only with a special casing youre right i should have clarified  its the old loose magnets that apparently are being discontinued not all magnets altogether as you noted the new train couplings still have magnets but they appear to be permanently attached to a fairly large housing which i guess will prevent kids from eating them but the old mtron round magnet pieces are presumably discontinued	neutral
sinner on may 28 2008 1135 pm said care to explain why personally i think that aside from the colour scheme the new one is far better why suspension more enclosed cockpits buglike appearence i suppose its a matter of personal opinion though i just thought that the mt101 was very skeletal and couldnt really steer that well although i do like it also the mcm has a better design in my view as the wheels are closer together making it look a lot more tankish than the mt101 also space in the rear isnt wasted on having a shuttle cp5670 on may 29 2008 0252 am said as for the hosejetpack things i always assumed that they were either welding torches or flamethrowers take your pick hmm well they dont have much else to defend themselves with and i think in the uk the mcm was marketed as a mobile recovery center fluyt on may 29 2008 0356 am said anyways mtron is one of the greatest space factions with mega core magnetiser as my favourite set of these guys even though i do not own it  the only thing that bothers me is the lack of reachable controls for the minifigs to drive their vehicles but iirc it is the same with a lot of other spacesets as well yeah they could have used the normal levers instead of the pronged two piece things at the front of the cockpit but there is certainly a lot to mod joebot on may 29 2008 0425 am said but the old mtron round magnet pieces are presumably discontinued shoot guess that bl and ebay are the only sources now thanks for your input	neutral
inertia on may 29 2008 0844 am said i just thought that the mt101 was very skeletal and couldnt really steer that well although i do like it also the mcm has a better design in my view as the wheels are closer together making it look a lot more tankish than the mt101 also space in the rear isnt wasted on having a shuttle thanks for an answer ill shut up now so we can focus on your review	neutral
sinner on may 29 2008 0520 pm said no but we especially imperialshadows are working on new indexes supposedly the space one was my job okay just dont forget this when it goes up i like self promotion i have about 10 old space sets coming in from ebay and gonna review them soon as well so that should be some good additions to the index when it goes up thanks	neutral
thanks for that fine review of a really classic and impressive mtron set inertia tohst on may 28 2008 0455 pm said the mm armored drilling unit has a more technic base giving it a less solid appearance  yeah it´s pretty sad some of these new sets just look very cool at the outside but appear to be hollow and blank at the inside especially with the annoying use of studless technic beams to mod these sets often means to change the whole inner frame leaving us with a bunch of imho not really very useful parts it´s not a very honorable marketing strategy to produce set designs that´re aimed to look impressive and cool on the box art but´re pretty useless in their inner structures of course i don´t want to offend some technic lovers and although i always was more the system kind of guy why can´t they just use some technic beams with studs at least i grew up with just imagine with pictures of alternative models on the box and i don´t think it´s that easy especially for younger kids to mod some of these terrific blownup sets like it once was with sets like this one here implosion off	positive
asuka on may 30 2008 0217 am said of course i don´t want to offend some technic lovers and although i always was more the system kind of guy why can´t they just use some technic beams with studs at least thats because of cost the older beams needed a four sided mold and the newer ones need only a two lego do seem to be using both types more as of late though asuka on may 30 2008 0217 am said i grew up with just imagine with pictures of alternative models on the box and i don´t think it´s that easy especially for younger kids to mod some of these terrific blownup sets like it once was with sets like this one here implosion off ive never heard an official word perhaps i should raise a topic but i think that they dont show them any more because it became a support nightmare what do i mean i bet tlg was tired of letters and calls saying timmy cant make this model shown on the box can you send instructions and the extra parts i know that for some recent models they were designed but not published how do i know this the creator said so	neutral
sinner on may 30 2008 0138 am said thats because of cost  ive never heard an official word perhaps i should raise a topic but i think that they dont show them any more because it became a support nightmare what do i mean i bet tlg was tired of letters and calls saying timmy cant make this model shown on the box can you send instructions and the extra parts of course it´s a money issue my question was more rhetorical but i still don´t like how they sacrifice inherent set design on the altar of cost saving efforts to be even more correct i don´t understand why they try to make extraordinary cool looking sets with a pretty weak inner life yeah they want to sell sets with something that looks exciting on the box art but lego was and fortunately is with many recent sets too always more than just an impressive spaceship or sf tank vehicle it´s the sum of the set itself and its parts and what you can do with it that makes out the full fun of it the best thing you can do with a new set beside some ucs sets perhaps is to mod the set according to your own likings this is where just imagine begins and how kids start to learn how to moc at least it was like that to me individualizing official sets and looking on some cool alternative models gave me my first ideas and helped my imagination and skills to grow back in these days when i was a wee child books movies and tv series as a source of inspiration just came a little later i can see many people complaining about how to make the alternative models yes but just stop using them on the box art´s a very poor solution and a dangerous one too at least in long terms of course i know that you know all these things too sinner i just think it´s a shame and a risk too because tlc´s perhaps sacrificing more than they might know by yet building with bricks is the main attraction of lego not just some cool crafts to play around with others can do this too and maybe better than tlc if the kids of today ever forget about the fascination of being imaginative tlc´ll only lose in the end	neutral
this super set contains many of the city sets you can get for your mini city hospital the smallest set is the 7902 car with a doctor i thought it looked a bit too slow here is a car you can build with the same bricks the instruction manual for the ambulance does contain a picture of an alternate model but it is actually quite hard to build something significantly different this sets lacks some snotbricks so i had to be a little more creative and came up with this ambulance it is more a hearse than an ambulance the helicopter has a lot of slopes so i built a speed boat for those special emergencies unlike the first two sets i used far from all the bricks in this this set does really have some great parts the brickshelf gallery with some more pictures is anyone up to the challenge and build some alternate models of the last set in the super pack  the hospital	positive
a great and very creative work i especially like the speed boat and the smaller car just splendid	positive
thank you very much asuka but i get the hint last	neutral
brilliant a huge amount of creativity there to do what you did with such limited piece counts is exceptional theyre at least as good as most of the alternate models lego show on sets	positive
harley  mistah j i want to preface my review by admitting that i’m an unrepentant harley quinn fanboy i’ve been enamored with the character since she first appeared in batman the animated series back in the 90’s and i’ve since followed her misadventures through her introduction into the regular batman series during no man’s land into her own series and even on the shortlived and notsogood birds of prey tv show so please excuse any proharley bias so down to business the 267 piece set retails for 30 us 35 at toys r us and builds up very fast and easy it consists of batman’s bat cycle harley’s hammer truck and brand new batman and harley quinn minifigs there is also no lack of weapons in addition to the usual bag of bataccessories and guns the set also comes with a pair of gray revolvers batman in this set has the new “armor” torso print and the hips are the same color as the legs hinting that this is supposed to represent the movie style batsuits more so then the traditional comic book “underwear over tights” look harley quinn is a very cool looking minifig and i haven’t grinned so much at a new batman character figure since my first batman minifig a couple years ago the figure is very true to the character and the torso has been accented with a few shape lines to try and distinguish her as a female despite the boxy body harley’s jester cap is an interesting new piece it seems to me at least to be made of a slightly different grade of plastic then we’re used to it’s molded in red and painted with black and white and it comes packed in its own separate little baggie i expect that this piece may have cost lego a little more then usual to produce harley also has a buildable accessory a giant mallet sure she can’t stand up all that well unless it’s held in specific ways but it’s neat and most importantly it’s funny it’s especially fun for smacking the everloving crap out of other minifigs with the bat cycle is in bag number one and is a very fast build this isn’t some little japanese sport bike like nightwing’s cycle this monster is almost a car and seems to pack just the right amount of intimidation for the caped crusader to exploit thanks to the thick tires two in front one in back it stands up just fine on its own and rolls very well the huge exhaust pipes are a nice touch and give the thing a look of engine power the only real flaw is the inclusion of the flickfire missiles mounted on the sides but as with any lego model they can be easily left out without hurting the look of the vehicle the hammer truck is the bulk of this set and a lot more fun then it looks of the monster truck persuasion the vehicle is designed and built with a surprising level of solidity the axle mounts are particularly impressive the big wheels and tires just beg you to drive this thing right over the bat cycle or batman the megamallet gimmick is also a surprise not so much for its technical complexity there isn’t any really but for the fact that once you start turning the knob at the rear to swing the mallet back and forth it’s really a lot of fun there are some low points to the truck design again the flickfire missiles are tacked on and there’s a cargo cratebed set into the back for harley’s loot of jewels the crate would have looked a lot better molded in black in brown it breaks up the look of the truck a little speaking of which the look of the truck is very pleasing the red and black harley quinn color scheme works really well on the vehicle there are a few stickers here and unfortunately the diamond patterned ones are applied over multiple bricks the rest however are great not only does she have an “i love joker” bumper sticker but she has a joker playing card taped to her dash i guess serving as a picture of her beloved puddin’ there is also a sticker for activation of the hammer which boldly shouts hit me this is a fun set a neat new batman vehicle and a big truck with lots of playability the harley minifig is a musthave for any batfan and if you only get one of the batman sets this year i’d recommend this one the price versus piececount on this set is a little bit of a deterrent though this might not be the best set for collectors on a budget or people looking for something completely new and innovative but anyone buying this for a child can rest assured that the kid will get your money’s worth out of the set through its play value when added together and averaged out the pros and cons of this set combine to give it a score of out of 5 even if harley herself is a clean 6 out of 5	positive

the 08 batman sets look like a step up from the somewhat lackluster 07 sets this looks like a very fun set with a whimsical sense of style very fitting with harley quinns character the price isnt great but i guess you gotta pay for that batman logo on the downside  i am so over the good buy vehicle vs bad guy vehicle concept i really wish tlc would get over this you see it throughout the product line  batman castle mission to mars etc	neutral

hi all so i was at the walmart yesterday and had the munchies and was looking for something to eat somewhere along the line i stopped caring about food and decided to browse the toy department to see what they had legowise usually they have jack squat but on this particular day they had a lot of new sets i impulsively picked this set up along with harley quinns hammer truck and the new little campsite from the indy 4 line i must say when i first saw images of this set i wasnt exactly thrilled or anything i mean i didnt really see anything particularly special about it but after purchasing it i must admit that i would consider it a must buy for any lego fan but enough babbling about myself onward with the review my first of an official set in this picture you can see everything you get with the set i thought the boxart was pretty nice looking the manual on the other hand took somewhat of a beating within the box a common problem with most more recent sets i do have to say that i wish they would at least make some effort in fixing this they could just make a little thin cardboard folder to minimize bending and tears for batman minifig collectors the highlight of this set are the robin and penguin figs previously you could only get them in the pricey batcave set but this set provides a much cheaper alternative one thing you will notice however is that robins hairpiece is a new mold as it is actually a black version of mutts hair from the indy 4 line personally i think it actually looks better than the hairpiece used on the older version of robin as the batcave had before it this set comes with some bricks to make two cute but deadly penguins they help add more charm to an already charming set when youre finished building youll end up with a nice little assortment of extra parts 1 black cheese slope 3 1x1 tile black yellow and white a revolver a technic pin and a 1x1 red round plate heres robins scuba jet its nice and sleek looking notable parts of interest would probably be the green turbine engines my only complaint on this one would have to be the use of decals on the 2x2 round yellow tiles for that type of a part printing seems as though it would have been the best way to go now for in my opinion the best part of the setthe penguins sub this set has more decals than robins scuba jet but they seem more necessary in this case i actually wanted to put the decals on the sub as i think the it looks great with them obviously it looks like a penguin but wow does it ever do it with style it has a lot of interactive features the first of which i will mention being the periscope which raises up and down and for the collectors of parts in new colors it has a few parts in medium orange such as 2x2 tile heres a shot of the bottom of the sub another nifty little feature is how you can lift the top off and fit the penguin inside and there is enough room inside so that you can firmly place top on again and without interference to the movement of the periscope another little feature is the rear springloaded missile you just tilt the small lever toward the front of the sub and it fires and the last small feature are the flickmissiles on each side overall this is a great set with a lot to offer for a decent price a lot of fans might view the only drawback to it as being the use of decals but if you plan on keeping the kit together they make it look really fantastic buy it if you can matt edited by imperialshadows 01 june 2008  1142 am	positive
brickadier general on may 29 2008 0727 pm said hi all so i was at the walmart yesterday and had the munchies and was looking for something to eat somewhere along the line i stopped caring about food and decided to browse the toy department to see what they had legowise thank you very much for that neat review brickadier general  i´m glad that you changed your mind a review of a burger wouldn´t be half that interesting for sure it´s just a mediocre set to me but of course it´s always cool to get important mfs in less pricy sets i like the penguin´s sub from the batcave more just because they did a fine job on resembling a penguin without using a sticker robins craft looks fairly nice but the most useful parts of the whole set for me personally would be those indeed very neat green engines	positive
thanks  why isnt this set on sh who wants the second riddle	neutral
thanks for the great review brickadier general the sub looks very nice and i like the idea of a raising periscope did the batcave sub have that feature and the details on the sub look very nice the inclusion of the penguin robin and two of those great brickbuilt penguins really confirms that ill be getting this considering that i didnt purchase the batcave however i am rather dissapointed that this set is so similar to the vehicles of penguin and robinin repectively in the batcave set i feel that it only really caters to those who havnt bought the set and i wouldve much appreciated different vehicles overall a very nice set perhaps the best of the 2008 wave despite its lack of originality thank you very much for the review bg	positive
i was never considering getting this set as i dont really like batman but if i found this set and had some money with me i would buy it ii would use it for indiana jones or something and the revolevers and top hats the only problem i see with the boxart is that the penguin is drowning	positive
looks like a cool set but the hairpiece for robin is vary disapointing i would be so glad is they used the regular hair you see all the time i hope lego will not make a habit of using that hairpiece on other figures	negative
axle on may 30 2008 0330 pm said the only problem i see with the boxart is that the penguin is drowning is not he just received underwater breathing superpowers and and oh well  speaking seriously great review btw  thanks  one question the teeth are printed on the sticker arent they  and are not on the box  good day gentlemen 	neutral
set 8635  agents  mobile command center pieces 1154 price us8999 those dedicated agents theyve fought chainsawarmed villains battled radiocontrolled cyborg crocs chased pallets of badlystored golden loot and wrestled killer sharks with vicious toothy grins finally theyve caught the notorious dr inferno and imprisoned him in their cavernous mobile command center but dr inferno wont go down without a fight can the agents stop the evil dr disco inferno fleeing will spy clops laser gun burn through the door in time or will dr inferno simply use the lovely agent traces enormous ponytail as an escape ladder to freedom more importantly will there be a riot in the streets of lego city as afols go apopletic at the thought of a 12 wide truck roaring through their ordered town layouts stay tuned part 1 the box instructions parts as the largest of the agents sets so far the box is easily the biggest trainee agents examine the following three pics and see if you notice anything odd box front box back box middle spot it thats right the printed cardboard which has supposed to be the bottom half of the fold out middle section is on the back slicing the ultralarge set image which would form the foldout in half  the way the cardboard is printed as one piece before its folded i think this would be very hard to do accidentally so suspect a major stuffup somewhere along the production line i bought this set off bricklink so would be very interested if anyone in the states who has seen these boxes actually on the shelves can tell me if this is common or rare basically i want to know if i should be annoyed that the bricklink seller didnt list this in the set description or are they all like this the instructions come in 4 booklets the parts list comes in at 5 pages which is a lot even at halfsize pages  large images of the parts inventory are in this folderwhen moderated for anyone interested heres also some cute agentstype artwork at the end of one of the books instructions show piece callouts and are divided into sections according to numbered bags as youd expect for a set with 1100 parts this baby comes with a lot of bags its a treasure trove of dark blue as well as the obvious large slopes and wall panels which make up the body and the roof there is a wealth of smaller navy blue pieces as well  small 1x1 bricks 2x2 bricks 1x1 plates 2x2 tiles heaps of 2x plates some slopes 22x cheese pieces basically anyone wanting a lot of dark blue should think about this set the roof panels alone for example could provide a dark blue sea for a modernised pirate moc 2 dsss dreaded sticker sheets quelle surprise  stickers the grey parts of the stickers here are metallic silver ink which is a nice touch actually as sticker sheets go theyre not too bad fairly subtle for the most part and the navy blue actually matches the bricks themselves however after looking at the sticker sheets i thought i was missing something what about the pieces used for the projection screens showing dr inferno and the sharks  why werent they on the sticker sheets there must be another one frantically i checked and rechecked the box and flipped through all the instruction manuals to find the elusive 3rd sheet where was it ten minutes later i noticed something which had honestly never occured to me  there were actual printed pieces in this set so obvious and yet so unthinkable its horrifying how years and years of exoforce and speed racer set releases can mentally condition peoples thought processes tut tut lego what have you reduced us to here they are folks  actual printed pieces yes i do believe this news deserves the caps i also noticed this nifty modification of the usual 2x3 cupboard  you can now fit drawers in it very clever this may have been around in belville sets for years for all i know but its new to me the drawers slide in and out very well and the top one sits on slight indentations in the middle of the cupboard part 2 the figs our trusty agents  charge chase trace and fuse high powered agents dont have time for names of more than one syllable  thats why the bad guys always lose  chase and fuse have the mutt hair in black and dark orange the lovely agent trace has an exquisite new hairpiece in dark brown perfect for rapunzel themed mocs as you can see her ponytail is loooong makes it hard to sit down the poor girl i feel sorry for all these female figs with such intricate hairstyles that they can never relax in an ordinary lego chair however at least she has two breasts unlike the recent harley quinn fig compensation indeed seriously though its great that theres a separate torso print for the female character and this attention to detail is typical of the set as a whole three of the agents have reversable heads  nice touch with the headsets and i like the id cards on their pants obviously the agents security system is based on some kind of crotch measuring device this would make sense considering the conspicuous bulges in the pants of dr infernos men see the other agents set reviews the villains  spy clops dr inferno gold tooth dr infernos hair in all its glory this is a great piece although the orange colouring is a little rough on the front its so 3d it deserves a back and side view and indeed eb thread all of its own as mentioned elsewhere this is different plastic to the normal minifig hair but it doesnt quite feel as soft as the exoforce hair it doesnt fall off as much anyway the figs get 1010 from me awesome hairpieces in great colours for the agents and a sleek navy blue neon green uniform the villains faces are great and they are all very distinctive the attention to detail is outstanding and its great to see a lego inhouse theme with characters as memorable and cool as figs from the licensed themes  part 3 the build the build is divided into three stages  the small vehicles the front of the truck and the massive command center section a small vehicles first up all the small vehicles we have a small flyer 2 buggies jet ski and a speed boat  all in glorious navy blue with little bits of silver detailing top view these vehicles are all simple small and welldesigned probably the weakest is the flyer only because the cockpit looks a little large in fact the small flyer is probably the weakest element of 8365 overall which tells you how good the set itself is in various threads here this set has been heavily criticised for being way out of proportion theres a reason for that as we shall come to however the existence of these small sets should appease some people with the new coast guard sets for example all of these save the flyer wouldnt look out of place on a city beach with a little modding heres an example  agents beach party spongebob couldnt help but crash the villains only have one small vehicle but theyve been wellserved in the smaller sets and this one is a unique and clever design i love the triangular shape and the simple but clever technique of making the arch slopes meet up around the propellers its sort of insectile in black and orange and looks very different from the usual assortment of helicopters etc b truck front this thing is a beast seriously look at it its chunky and mean looking you dont want to mess with this baby the build is really nice like a lot of star wars vehicles its all based on technic beams pinned together unlike a lot of mars mission sets underneath isnt all technic beams with some plates slapped on like a facade the majority is a lot of plates and bricks which all fit together solidly you can see from the detailing of cheese grater slopes and silver pieces on the front how effort has been made to give this vehicle a distinct feel different to other lego sets sure the silver slope mirrors might be a bit too much for some but this baby is all about attitude you can imagine it roaring down the road en route to dr infernos diabolical lair after all these sets are agents sets  nobody said they were secret agents c  command center  whole assembly heres a view of the whole thing assembled  inside and cool details to follow at the end its kind of hard to show here as it is extreeeeemely long this is indeed a big set the build for the trailer part of the command center is fun and very satisfying yes there are large pieces but there is also a huge amount of detail it is also solid as a rock i remember being annoyed building the big ferrari truck a few years ago  everytime you looked at it an 8 x 16 plate fell off the mobile command center is solid  even with the hinged roof and special features it is not delicate at all kudos to the designers again as it is mainly a brick build rather than a technic one i also like how the command center part connects to the cabin  its not a special piece at all just a technic axle going through two circle plates but it works and its solid please note ive been selective about which stickers ive applied during the build top view the rear heres an example of why i like the build a the designers have enough sense to put a ladder so a minifig can climb up to the interior when the command center is open b notice that although the ladder clips at the top there is an extra clip there in the middle purely to hold it in place so it doesnt flap around and holds firm i dont know if most designers would even think to put a ladder there let alone go the extra mile and put a mechanism to hold it in place pure class oh and notice the greebly detail stuff to the right there too the other side this is probably the other weak part of the build  the bricky gaps at the top where the hinge to open the roof sits its a little gappy but the set is so big you dont really notice d and now for the fun stuff  inside and neat details ok so weve built the thing its big its blue the top of the trailer itself would make a good warehouse moc for a harbour layout but what about inside is it any good what about all those small vehicles from the start of the review where do they go well im glad you asked because the solution is superb the small flyer folds slightly and slides into place here lift off the roof and youre away the large buggy and the speedboat go under here the jetski slides out of the rear here attached to its own little platform and the small buggy goes inside the main cabin theres even a crane so you can lift it down so now we know why this set is so large to fit everything in its amazing that this functionality doesnt affect the aesthetics of the set as a whole but we still havent finished on the details the front section has a very easytoswingopen roof section and missiles theres also a command section underneath the bit where the flyer lifts out and now for the interior i have to say i really like this space not only is it packed with great stuff theres also enough room for minifigs to move around i hate bases where the figs only have about 2 studs to actually stand and walk aquabase invasion is a nice set for example but the actual functional space inside the base is teensy claustrophobia you know within a week theyd be fighting to toss each other out of the airlock no such problems for these suave agents who have plenty of legroom and the ability to launch missiles from their ceiling the whole of the interior zooming in moving from left to right first off the medicine cabinet looks like someones been leaving secret mission dossiers lying around the projector area for mission briefings dr inferno recently changed his hair colour from purple to orange it seems why are all these minifigs so obsessed with their hair the projector folds down when the trailer is open push the button and the light glows on now dr infernos hair is orange again this is one of my favourite parts of the set it works a charm the batteries for these lightbricks can also be replaced  instructions are in the manual agent charge considers sharkfin soup for dinner did i mention these projection panels are printed the detail is very fine too the tool section laptops sit in the middle compartment you get some flippers yellow scuba tank and various implements im so impressed that the helmet is pearl silver with a different coloured visor too  theres so much variation in the parts in this set you dont get the sense the designers are using the same thing over and over to save money it all feels luxe and topoftheline just like the command center itself two laptops  yay the aforementioned rooftop missiles the dr inferno cage nasty electric shocks bzzt you can see my reviewing skills are burning out now  sentences truncated another example of detail  nowhere else in the set is a 1x1 transgreen tile used  they could have used a 1x1 trans green cheese wedge piece as there are others in the set but they didnt how does dr i get out flick that lever on the right hand exterior and the door pops open spy clops the loyal minion awaits his master on the other side and there we have it take a bow guys theres a lot of spare parts a suspicious amount of dark blue small slopes but i checked the instructions and didnt see anything missing i have to say i do like the new policy since speed racer i think of including these small slopes as extras part 4 overall rating if youve made it this far youve got more stamina than dr infernos army of cyborg animals themselves as i said earlier this set has drawn criticism for the size of the truck however large vehicles do exist  i grew up in a wheat farming area and as a kid the size of the lorries that thundered past carrying grain was probably intimidating to me as this monstrous espionage machine is to the good citizens of lego city on top of that it does contain a plethora of 4wide vehicles inside  criticism of this set on the basis of size to me also seems misguided as this is basically a playset  and it is a very good one to boot as you can probably tell i love it to pieces and wouldnt hesitate to recommend it to anyone whether for parts or for play value check out the parts list in this folderwhen moderated and you can see just how many excellent pieces it contains a lightup brick a flood of navy blue metallic silver bricks  were spoiled 8635 is also an enjoyable build with fantastic figs and topoftheline detailing in a year when ive found city a bit disappointing after the run of great sets in 20062007 the agents line has been one of the surprise hits for me and i cant wait to see what the designers come up with next edited by sveltecorps 02 june 2008  1246 am	positive

you know i like many had doubts about these sets when they were first mentioned but ive decided i want the whole line now this set is the créme de la créme just beautifully stunning that is a great review sveltecorps you have gone into fantastic detail and description of all the elements really it is this review that has persuaded me to buy this set i blame you the minifigs are great the vehicles are better and the truck and interior is awesome the few minor draw backs are far outweighed by the attention to detail and the many unique and cool elements used in this set and printed pieces that is even better great job you have obviously put a tremendous effort in making this review and i for one definitely appreciate it i am looking forward to these sets being available in new zealand	positive
must get two thanks so much this review has truly shown this set as a brilliant one even those who hate this theme must admit it is greatly designed i love the way the mini vehicles fit i love the light brick i love the truck front i love the trailer i love the missions bay i love holding cell i love everything edit and i second dragonators response when i say thankyou sveltecorps for this grand review you have convinced me utterly to get this batbrick away edited by batbrick 31 may 2008  1049 am	positive
wow great review of what seems to be a great set i love that ponytail this looks to be a must have set it probably wont stay together for long though thanks very much i fixed the header for you thats two you owe me the other is for making me think that this set was in australia 	positive
sveltecorps a fanastic review of this biggest agents set at first i was not very keen to have this set however after reading your review you have make me swing up and down its simply fabulous thanks for your hard work i am sure its not easy to do this review i love that female minifig she looks awfully sweet especially with her new hair great job	positive
omg thank you thank you thank you you made my day so that means dr infernos hair isnt rubber but one question is it like that weird funny soft plastic like the ants from indy 4 please answer	positive
great review thanks thats one hell of a set i think lego has reached a certain kind of peak with the design cleverness and fun of this one im so relieved that agents seems to be shaping up to be even better then i thought it was going to beand i thought it was going to be cool to begin with agent charge not only does he look like dash justice but he has the name of one of dashs alpha team squadmates i call shenanigans	positive
woah i got to have this set i shall buy it asap thanks for the review expertly done	positive
wonderful review  one of the best ive ever seen on this site man we thought this might be the weakest set in the line but it turns out it may be the strongest everything about this set  from the color scheme to all the details to the minifigures to the piece selection  is just wonderful i think this set has finally confirmed it agents is everything alpha team wasnt and is how they should have done a spy theme from the start kudos to tlc for finally getting it right  and i sure hope theres a second year	positive
wow excellent review thanks that set sure looks fantastic its incredible how much features theyve managed to pack in while keeping it roomy im really impressed by the quality of the design tlc is sure getting back on track with great design ow 2008 is going to be expensive	positive

another great review im looking forward to getting this set sometime soon i wasnt aware of the power function aspect similar i suppose to the old technic sets which had an additional instructions for those with the relevant motors i knew those dinos i got at clearance would come in useful nice to see the recent bulldozer treads appearing in black grey seemed a slightly unusual colour choice	positive
these new sets are just totally offthewall radical d its the little details like the scoops on the blades and the alternate alien energy source lego didnt even have to include those but they did that show lego are really getting back into their groove this year the ability to add power functions is just so cool as well im going to pickup the creator monster dino set for the electronics when the sales hit as svelte has suggested a very entertaining review just like the agents mobile command center one d	positive
nice review the power functions is a nice idea and i ownder if it will appear in any other new sets regarless if i get this i decided to just to get what ever looks good in the shops from now on  im defianltey picking up some of the white visors off bricklink	neutral
thank you for that fine review sveltecorps that´s a pretty cool set much more solid than the armoured drilling unit with a nice little transporter and some for sure pretty interesting additional power functions a very smart idea indeed did i miss something or is there really only one and probably improved shooting device and there´re even some levers to control the vehicles wow a matured marsmission on indeed now let´s get rid of these poor utilized jellies and we´re right on the way	positive
isnt it a lovely set i too have one modded of course 	positive
asuka on jun 4 2008 0926 am said did i miss something or is there really only one and probably improved shooting device no you didnt miss anything theres only one and its the less obtrusive new piece the range is pretty poor though 	neutral
so is there some way to get all those motor bits at once or do you have to buy them on their own i dont think ive ever seen them in a store here	neutral
well i guess its nice that theyre making the story background a little more clear with that jelly plugged into the power cable hmmh both jellies and crystals can be used as power sources think theres a connection both of them are transparent and greenish maybe jellies hatch from crystals like eggs or need them as food or something important like that yay for evil humans	positive
thanks for the great review sveltecorps i bought some of the mm last year and ended up selling them off for sw this new set has got me interested in mm again partly due to your cool review one question though did you get this set in aust shops or sh just wondering if i should be looking for it yet edit sorry just saw your other post saying it was ordered from sh cheers isc edited by i scream clone 04 june 2008  0808 am	positive
excellent review loving this set i mean come on its a flipping tank awesomeness is written all over this  from all those blades and scoops at the front to the mini rover and yes you can even turn it into a motorized battle tank reminds me of the old technic days when they advertised in the manuals how to hook up the kits with separately sold motors another day another review of an awesome set yes this is sure tlcs year	positive
really nice review i love those sweet looking power functions on it if only the orange bits could be replaced then you could have a futuristic and motorized jungle cutter anyway the alien bit was disturbing but the overlytall new commanders look very very cool all in all a great set but i wont be able to buy it because in a few days sh will become 600 richer and my wallet will writhe around in pain on the floor	positive
well title says it the description youll understand later i ordered this off of sh last tuesday and oddly enough its listed on sh as mx81 hypersonic airplane id like to apologize for the random horrible faded pics i took the review outside and the clouds kept shifting changing the lighting and then i had to go inside because it started raining its been raining for a week its raining now as i type this so i foolishly went outside to take pics the front of the box not bad as far as boxes go it features a liftup tab which shows the various functions back of the box still not much to say two manuals i think this is just right not too thick but not too many manuals either oddly enough the box came with a little folded up piece of paper telling us not to mix the bags it comes sorted into 4 bags by the way minifigures the set features 3 normal mm figs 1 normal jellie and one of the new commanders i really like this guy he has a few issues like his hands being stuck sideways and still being hollow but still a great improvement hell make a lovely addition to any halloween moc stickers the set comes with a fairly big dss for the spacecraft pretty normal but i do like the dragon sticker then suprises of suprises a technicolor sticker sheet for the aliens how cool is this huh the tops of the actual stickers are shiny which is hard to see in the pic even the bottom is shiny who said stickers cant be cool the mining craft the little guy is pretty cute and well built my only gripe is that theres nowhere to spin the drill it seems so lifeless without a feature the alien craft youd think a commander would be important enough to have a seatbelt rather than be stabbed with a clip and stuck on the ship like those other grunt aliens i think this thing has some potential shiny stickers different body shape and when you look at those engines this thing could be an alien corvette but then you look at the back pretty bare no flares or anything its a cool little craft but it justlacks the modules these things have some potential as well with some modding they could be pretty cool unfortunetly its pretty boxy there are no engines and the wings are too small the top is pretty nice though the greebles are all right the controls as usual are a sticker pretty spacious mind you the cockpit doesnt stay flush with the body though the front plate underneath it can be easily replaced with a brick to fix that im not gonna comment on this the main body too bad the labratory isnt much of a lab a transred panel and some tray thing are all that compose the lab i was expecting more but true to form this mars mission set has no impressive interior to speak of there is a lot of space though so it shouldnt be hard to mod phew the lab folds up like so pretty simple and would allow access to the lab if there was one and then we have this thing what is it defense laser communications array satellite tv the modules connect like so sorry out of place too bad the pins stick out various pics as you can see this thing has more of those bars than an att commercial there you understand the topic description now  the rear it uses a white city plane wing for thewings when i first saw the prototype pics i thought they slanted downwards that wouldve been really cool ah now to the platform from the position of the drill i think this could be a really cool turret location when i mod it to more military space back to the bars if we had space monkeys theyd love this this set has more bars than a jungle gym  here we see the button that drops the platform pretty clever and its not in the way best of all it really works really well actually good job tlc 2 more bars and a shooter mechanism jeeze this is really setting itself up for a joke a shooter mechanism walks into a bar never mind here we have the handle that allows you to pick it up safely a good idea but its placed waaaay to far back way off the center of balance you have to hold on to it pretty well to keep it angled up though it does stop your hands from getting in the way of the platform ah the platform in action this is really a neat little feature not only can the ship land in a reduced footprint but it also prevents the nice white paint job from getting red dust all over it its centered pretty well too and you dont have to worry about knocking it over just dont shove it back at all here we have the latch when the button on top is pushed this gets pulled inward which pulls out of this hole and allows it to swing neatly down good luck and happy mining again sorry for the lack of inprogress review i wouldve liked to take pics of the mechanism and so on but typical of the mm sets you cant really take it apart well this is really a nice set which can hopefully be upgraded with a better lab with little difficulty some of my military mod plans include strip the lab and install a command center get rid of lots of bars the thing has more bars than alcatraz install some turrets this is a big command ship so why all the forwardfacing weapons itll need some aa defense mod the landing platform to be a troop dropper with installable aa turret mod the cockpit pods to be more aerodymic so thats all folks shall i include one last bar joke	neutral
i appreciate your review mr mandalorian but why the negativity id try to find more positives about the set instead of kinda criticizing it after each picture i personally think it looks freakin awesome the size is very impresive and i nearly fell of my chair when i saw the first pics earlier this year its quite unlike anything ive ever seen from lego edited by radiant7 04 june 2008  0827 am	positive
thanks for the review mr mandalorian this is an er interesting set lots of frontal firepower very big too and i like the idea of those two little craft that attach on the sides sort of like little escape pod things anywho not one of the things on my to buy list but i do like that radioactive sticker that could come in use looking forward to seeing your modifications too peace	positive
mr mandalorian on jun 4 2008 0119 am said and then we have this thing what is it defense laser communications array satellite tv that certainly feels like an homage to the deep freeze defender which itself feels like an homage to the galaxy commander is there some way to centre one of the cockpit units without massive de and re construction	neutral
spacefan on jun 4 2008 0556 pm said anyhow this is my first post to the forum and hope my welcome wont wear out here anytime soon having a name like that is a good start	positive
thanks for the review i have to concede this does appear to be the weakest set of the summer mm lineup ive noticed a trend that the larger sets have plenty of parts potential but when assembled the model is not more than the sum of the parts eagle base certainly didnt seem worth the asking price at least this is one large model on a positive note the lame aero tubes darts and martian carrier pods have disappeared dont get me wrong i love mm and most of the lineup is great this one just seems to fall a little short of the bar	neutral
i dont understand why theres so much negativity this is actually my favorite of the new mm sets the finished look is very sleek and not very gappy at all the deployable landing pad is great and itll make it easy to put on a shelf without taking too much room lots of greebles although i will concede that its just begging to be modded still though im definitely buying this one  it has a really great look to it	positive
two more questions 1  how stable is the entire craft when balanced on the platform is there a chance that it will just collapse 2  what are the total wingspan height and depth measurements of the model	neutral

great review mr boba fett i really like this set a lot some of the features may not be as good as i hoped they would but overall this looks to be a really nice set im so happy that the giant spacecrafts are finally back quote ive noticed a trend that the larger sets have plenty of parts potential but when assembled the model is not more than the sum of the parts eagle base certainly didnt seem worth the asking price at least this is one large model on a positive note the lame aero tubes darts and martian carrier pods have disappeared hm actually i dont see the comparison eagle base looked terible to me right from the start so it was no suprise when it ended up being the weakest kit in the first year this big ship on the other hand looked great as soon as i saw it and still looks good	positive
iron moose on jun 4 2008 0215 pm said do tell im being curious not confrontational  well first and foremost like many other people im no fan of those dreaded unprinted minifig torsos and stickers but also the cost to piece ratio of the set it just seems too expensive for everything that you get such as too many small parts and a lighter than usual piece count for the price though if it had included printed minifigs and other elements i maybe would of been able to swallow its 100 usd cost a little easier but star justice is still lego space in the most classic sense thats available today and i will probably pony it up just because anyway i hope were not breaking forum protocol by not discussing the 7644 review of the original poster or that particular set in general	neutral

hello all eurobricks members i will be presenting my first review on one of the harry potters set firstly i must emphasize that i am not a very big harry potter fan or owned many harry potter sets for this review i will be highlighting what is the beauty of this small little set and the reasons to own multiple sets of it comments and critics are strongly welcomed this set is featured in the harry potter movie prisoner of azkaban this set is orignally released in 2004 align with the harry potters movie this was actually one of the movie scene where buckbeak the griffin is appeared in the movie the group of students are supposed to be having up close and personal with him however draco decided to disturb our lovely buckbeak enough of this movie synopsis i am sure fans of harry potter will know this better box art featured minifigcreature background scene the scene is a simple garden which had a very good mixture of spare parts for your mocs building on its own there is nothing outstanding about this set except for the griffin you can buy multiple sets for the griffin alone and for draco minifig well you dont need lots of draco but for castle lovers black cap are exceptionally useful at least from my view now i will point out the following why this sets is so great for other reasons hidden cover note that this is the only mechanism which you can find in this set it looks rather simple but quite useful there are some little things hide in it too greens foilage and brown parts needless to say much it offer 3 foilage a green plant 3 brown slopes 2 ideal bricks and 1x1 brown brick for building a tree great for jungle building forest building and etc i am sure there are many builders will look out for these interesting parts it comes with a wizard book owl 2 printed tiles with a spider and stone prints on it the far right seriously i dont find any good use for it can any eb members enlighten me on that gray thing on the right grey parts it comes with a good 10 x 4 green plate useful for adding as a platform some more grey slopes for your mocs there you have it draco encounter with buckbeak comparing with deep forest ambush as you may remembered recently there was an impulse set competition one of my entries which is under the history theme the deep forest ambush was firstly inspired by this set and made an improvement out of it look at the improved tree compared with the orignal summary review playability 410 not much to play with except swooshing around the griffin design 510 too simple and its defintely not related with the movie scene parts 1010 great for parts explained by the review a great deal of green and brown parts price 910 an inexpensive set based on the 2004 pricing overall 710 a must have for all harry potter fans and collectors whom needs a great use of green and brown parts hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine more pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated let the potter magic begans edited by whitefang 09 june 2008  0245 pm	neutral
a very nice little review of a pretty nice little set that i wish id bought between 1 and 10 of just for the griffin oh well your review has shown me that its useful for more than just that so maybe ill try to pick one up someday cant have too many black capes books or printed things speaking of which whitefang on jun 9 2008 0941 am said interesting parts it comes with a wizard book owl 2 printed tiles with a spider and stone prints on it the far right seriously i dont find any good use for it can any eb members enlighten me on that gray thing on the right the gray thing is technically a plume like any castle plume except in this case its a feather presumably from the griffin and made from the mold to the old indian feathers in the wild west sets its a case of an old part coming back for a slightly new use in a new colour beyond that the stone print tile is a bundle or rolled up blanket or package depending on where its used i dont think its ever meant to be a stone it was used as a rolled up pack on the back of the star wars speederbikes for example nice pics plenty of useful information id give this review an a thanks for doing it	neutral

great review nice set for plants huh too bad i didnt get thus set but luckily my neighbor did that griffin is nice for castle mocs and that orange head pumpkin i know seems rare to me not much else to say	positive
ohhh great idea to review the old potter sets especially the line from prisoner of azkaban i was in my dark ages then luckily i was able to catch up on the missed figs with one internet order this draco is the best tlc has made if you ask me the new one also doubling for belloq and guards in the indy line doesnt look quite as hautain as this one buckbeak looks cool looks like his neckhead can be moved right rather similar to lego horses well designed the orange brick doesnt have a pumpkin face on it right unlike the one from philosophers stone in the set with the troll im looking forward to more reviews by you sir whitefang good work	positive

nice review i like the treemaking pieces the most of this not very expensive set the buckbeak fig is very nice and can bow his head like the horses i was annoyed to get another draco without some other not made figs pansy parkinson for example about the dark bley feathers in the second version of hogwarts there were several of these feathers put in little 1x1 cones like it was a feather to write with it i bought 2 sets of these and when they were for sale i just bought  6 more of it only annoying that i had then even a bigger army of dracos	neutral

hmmm ive still got this set and i must say i think you did a good job of reviewing it but overall i hate the set probably the worst ucs set so far apart from the naboo fighter but that hardly even counts as ucs from my experience unless you really really want it and have nothing better to spent your  on in that case go for it but in my case it was a very repetitive build and final model was quite well bland not must variety to it if you know what i meanfor the price i would really reccomend the ucs star destroyer because thats a much better story	negative
thanks for the review eh honestly i though this was awful ever since i first saw the pictures to me an incomplete grey ball doesnt really work as a special ucs kit for the sole reason that its boring extremely so now the new death star playset is a whole different story they should have done that in the first place edited by grevious 24 june 2008  0912 pm	negative
even though i never liked ucs i absolutley hate this one sure its great on display but the build looks extremley boring to me just stacking plate after plate and as you said its going to break a little if you touch it the only intersting part for me is the firing laser although i do have to say the proce isnt too bad i still wouldt buy it and no minifigs so thanks for the review but ill pass on this one the new minifig scale ds looks awesome though and this might have hyped some up who are buying the new ds	negative

great concise review kimt though its not for me you held my interest all the way through thanks isc	positive
i think its a very weird and boring ucs set but what a lot of grey plates you could build something much better out of them but it would be fairly flat it looks very fragile though  my ucs atst is edited by shoc 25 june 2008  1028 am	negative
i also dont feel this is a very good set but is that old grey in which case it would be a nice part pack dr brick	negative

kimt on jun 25 2008 0834 am said i dont agree that the isd is better  imho theyre exactly them same  big and grey this is a question of personal liking  which is the coolest ds or isd not comparative here are some advantages that makes isd win for me  a lot more fun to build with less repetitions  it is easier to build alternate models from it how many alternate models of the ds2 have you seen  the bricks are more varied  you get magnets  it is a larger set if you look at the size	positive
wow what a letdown i recently picked up this set and i looked up this review to see what i was getting into not good news the silver lining is that it was a damaged box deal at brickworld so it only cost me 100 half off the already lowered price so it was definatley worth it as a parts pack if nothing else its the last unopenedunbuilt large kit in my collection so even if it is repetetive i am going to build it anyway it is likely however that i may substitute pieces to do away with the colored interior ive already determined that after it sits on display for a while i want to do a zepplin as an alternate build looking at the parts list it looks like its the perfect set for such an undertaking	negative
id love to get my hands on one of these but youd need about three jobs to justify the prices of this guy on ebay fantastic review kimt	neutral
dang so much negativity on a such spectacular set this baby provides an amazing backdrop to any lego inspired star wars diorama and lets face it lego tends to be a rectangular brick and somehow we now have a sphere guys its a ucs it accurately depicts the on screen icon and put plain and simple is a wonderful sculptural piece of work in its own right i agree with kimt in that the removal of the laser and super star destroyer gives it more authenticity but to call it a gray golf ball or ignore its inherent accuracy is simply to miss the point it proved to be the best build to share with someone be it family or friend due to its repeated sections and impressive finish its a clever build and to criticize it for lack of playability or i suspect for many its absence of minifigs is just absurd and possibly why lego has not released a proper ucs in nearly two years i reckon many out there would love a ucs tyderium imperial walker or slave 1 with a spectacular piece count be it minifig scale or just darn impressive in its own right sadly for those who love these sculptural masterpieces were stuck with simple toys with play features and cute minifigs clever in their own right but lacking the clout and purity of the old ucs line lets hope some diversity of product is just around the corner else 10179 was the last of the truly brave financial gambles of the star wars line	positive

7656 general greivouss starfighter release 2007 number of pieces 232 minifigs 1 brickset welcome this is my first review so contstructive critisism is very much appreciated on to the review first we start out with the box the box art is the same as always since 2006 nothing special then we start the build the build is fairly easy and will take the seasoned builder about 1520 min to complete here is the finished model and birds eye view as you can see this ship is very sleek the fins or wings each have an outer slope and an inner one with the guns in between there are also cones on the front of the fins which give the ship an even more sleek look in the middle of the wings there is the main body with a big slope and stripes decorating it this set has a very good playability factor as im about to show you now the guns on the ship are pretty cool looking to begin with a bley slope attaching a lightsaber hilt and a transneon green stud to the fin on each side but theres more than what meets the eye yes the guns flip up and they can flip all the way back to hide them for whatever case they need hiding lets have a look at the back there is a tail fin used as landing gear and some lightspeed boosters but wait the tail fin can flip up for flight thanks to a hinge attached to the back of the cockpit heres another playability factor the cockpit can slide open very smoothly and easily heres how this is possible a clever system under the hood allows the cockpit to open see those two bley pieces on the black ones those bley ones attach to the tan plates under the hood and the hood and windsheild attach to the black peices the black and bley pieces work together as a sliding system so the cockpit opens viola and then the cockpit snaps in place thanks to the red hook and clip its a very accurate system and works very well youll want to open and close it over and over again now finnaly to the fig the general himself a very impressive fig with a new head and torso mold in this set which is one of only two with greivous in it he comes with 2 green and two blue lightsabers all with bley hilts   i was hoping for chrome hilts but its a minor fault grievous also comes with a new mold pistol blaster not pictured heres the general in the cockpit sadly a weak cockpit no details he just half lays down on a small slope in this set he doesnt come with a cape beacuse with it on the cockpit doesnt close thats about it heres the final verdict build 710 fairly easy but fun a little bit weak playability 810 many playability factors but some are boring or pointless swooshability 810 very fun to fly around sometimes pieces break off minifigs 1010 one amazing fig with 4 lightsabers and a new blaster what more could you ask for design 910 very sleek but hardly any real texture i like it but others might want greebling price 1010 overall score 910 a very cool ship with a very cool minifig and accessories one of the best sw sets i have ever seen for its small price i highly recommend it to any kind of sw lego or sw lego fan hope you enjoyed my review please leave feedback edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0301 am	positive
you should have posted the entire review up i am about to look at the gallery for the rest of the pics edit as soon as i post the images came thats weird nice review is there more it says ill be back good first review edited by skipper 24 26 june 2008  0911 pm	neutral
sorry about that skipper i added the topic after the first pic was uploaded just to make sure the pics would be in the post you probably posted while i was editing it and i had to go to visit my grandparents im at their house right now sorry if you got freaked out	neutral
the set no longer looks as ugly as ive always thought thanks for the review  i might have to pick one up now to go with the magnaguard fighter	neutral
thats a neat little set i like the design of the fighter thanks for the review  its been keep it up kimt	positive
hey thanks for all the feedback guys ill try to do the sith infiltrator this weekend	neutral
yesterday i buy this setand im waiting for a pack this review is very helpful jimbutcher on jun 27 2008 0834 pm said ill try to do the sith infiltrator this weekend i wait	neutral
jameseh on jun 28 2008 0824 pm said does the sliding cockpit come off easily my friends brothers breaks everytime you touch it but he may have built it wrong it put me off the set im very sad to say that sometimes it does but thats only if you hold it from the top and bottom with your fingers and thumb respectivly but if you hold it in your palm or from the sides it wont break emphasis on sometimes but dont try to mess around with it by removing its pieces or adding new one or modding it in any way because the sliding mechanism wont agree with the mods and break but this hardly takes away from anyone liking this set because imo its perfect just how it is	negative
yeah general grievous starfighter will land in my house greate set i love decals  brown and sandy pattern ingenious btw when you show sith infiltrator review i wait 	positive
nice work jim for your first review i must admit the set didnt really appeal to me at first but your review has definitely shown off the cool functions built in to this ship well done cheers isc	positive
nice review i bought a couple of these for parts the only thing i dont like about the ship itself not the lego version it does fine is why is the grand droid general flying around in in a small fighter like this i prefer the battlefront interpretation witch uses it as a bomber anyway great review york	neutral
thanks again you guys dont worry the sith infiltrator review will be up this week my computer has viruses but now i got firefox complete with spell check so i should be able to go on the internet ok from now on	neutral
great review i would get the set but im saving for the clone wars sets	positive
its all good buti know you expected a but  its a rat	positive
thanks for the review bearing in mind that the whole point of this set is to get a cheap troll warrior i actually quite like it the cart isnt brilliant but for 13 pieces its not that bad the troll fig is great as always and i guess the rats are always nice to get not so much in real life though the sets that contain the trolls have a fairly solid number each i mean tower raid has three but nevertheless i think i may have to pick up a few of these whitefang on jul 2 2008 0249 pm said in addition the flick missile really works use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it the missile will fly well it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature the trolls hands are going to get quite sore then arent they	positive
trooperdavinfelth on jul 2 2008 0315 pm said its all good buti know you expected a but  its a rat or maybe a very large mouse	neutral
its a good review but you forgot another thing the troll needs a shiled like they used to in the 2007 castle line the sets always had shields for the minifigs and it could be better if it was 300 instead of 350 but yes it is a good impulse great army builder	positive
very good nice to see how its all played out nice review	positive

grrr you beat me to it i got two of these in the mail today and was so eager to do a review of it thanks for saving me the work edited by wilhelm screamer 03 july 2008  0330 am	positive
ah sweet thanks for the review whitefang i hope this set shows up in nz soon i cant wait to get my hands on it troll warrior on peace	positive
hey your review is great as usual as for the set itself  well its an impulse set after all  small and cheap nothing special well the rat is special hehe for me the rat is the most interesting in the set cause i dont have a rat i dont have a troll warrior either but im not very interested	neutral
nice review i will definately need a few of these	positive
whitefang on jul 3 2008 0406 am said i thought by calling it as a mouse it will be a little much friendly unlike calling it a rat why is mouse friendlier than rat	neutral
guys thanks for your kind comments it seemed most of us here love this impulse set mainly to build army guess i am a little bit too critic in my review i was expecting a little bit more nevertheless i intend to buy multiple sets of this and build on my orc armies and split them into different battalions this is indeed one of the better ways to acquire orcs wilhelm screamer on jul 3 2008 1130 am said i got two of these in the mail today and was so eager to do a review of it thanks for saving me the work opps i was eager to do a review as well when i bought these sets i hope you enjoyed reading this comprehensive review nikola bathory on jul 3 2008 0408 pm said hey your review is great as usual as for the set itself  well its an impulse set after all  small and cheap nothing special well the rat is special hehe for me the rat is the most interesting in the set cause i dont have a rat i dont have a troll warrior either but im not very interested give the new theme a chance i feel tlg have made an effort to revive certain elements that are present in past castle themes although it is not as good as the past but it is certainly better than the recent castle themes shoc on jul 4 2008 0100 am said why is mouse friendlier than rat well mouse sounded more friendly because it can associate with tom and jerry but calling it a rat equal calling it a pest its just a matter of putting it in different terms thats all edit instead of posting another post to explain why i used mouse i will write it here tom and jerry is reflected as a cartoon children associate jerry as a mouse since its supposed to be heartwarming and make us laugh in real life there are many different pets we raised one of the possible pets we considered is a mouse mouse are supposed to be shy and friendly creatures that live in harmony while rats lived in packs hunt food in the dark and is widely regarded as a pest in this review i am trying to illustrate rat and associate it with mouse by presenting it in a much friendly approach there is no right or wrong answer its just making use of different words to represent how i feel towards a particular thing edited by whitefang 04 july 2008  0808 am	positive
whitefang on jul 4 2008 0543 pm said well mouse sounded more friendly because it can associate with tom and jerry but calling it a rat equal calling it a pest its just a matter of putting it in different terms thats all the thing i dont get is how jerry is friendly	neutral
this is a nice way of building up orc armies but i do wish it was designed like the knight impulse set there you have a minifig enough weapons and armor for two figs and a weapons rack made out of basic pieces add a generic fig from your collection and you have two knights and the pieces from the rack can be easily used in mocs the pieces that make up the siege weapon in the orc impulse are not as easy to use in other creations id rather have seen a orcish weapons rack different from the knights rack but like it using basic elements with a second helmet another weapon the orc armor and a shield to put on it still although not as good as the knight impulse its a nice little set whitefang on jul 4 2008 0343 am said tom and jerry is reflected as a cartoon children associate jerry as a mouse since its supposed to be heartwarming and make us laugh in real life there are many different pets we raised one of the possible pets we considered is a mouse mouse are supposed to be shy and friendly creatures that live in harmony while rats lived in packs hunt food in the dark and is widely regarded as a pest where i come from people keep both as pets however if either are found in the house uninvited they are considered pests and if you look at the chinese zodiac rats are very well thought of and are symbols of prosperity the brick mouse rat	positive
thank you for the review the set is nice i didnt need the flickfire missiles and would have rather a orctrol shield instead but i think i will pick one up	positive
hello all eurobricks members i will be doing a continuation of my impulse set reviews i was pretty excited when i laid my hands on these new impulse sets yesterday hope to give most of you a good insight for this set name street cleaner theme lego system  town  city year 2008 pieces 22 minifigs 1 an image of a 5620 street cleaner let the cleaning begin the street cleaner has a job to do it is to clean the rubbish on the streets after a new year countdown it seemed the cleaning agency have a new equipment to use its not as big as the previous street sweeper machine the cleaner will need to operate the equipment manually by pushing it look at the mess after sorting out look at the pieces offered its not a very complicated set since its an impulse set there are some pretty useful parts lying around such as the broom spade however i was quite surprised when i could not find the lid of the rubbish bin i cant used this rubbish bin to place it around my town without a lid on top of it i believed it is not a norm by not including the lid look at that bin well that rubbish bin seem to be containing his equipment in it instead of the rubbish the cleaners face looks pretty sad i think he wants to have a change of job front view i love that blue brush very much quite fun to play with especially pushing the rubbish aside thats why a spade is there to help him to dig out the litter and the broom to brush it away ok now i know why his face looks so sad where is that street sweeper machine summary review playability 6510 not bad to play with design 7510 the design is relatively interesting with the use of the technic part to be its foundation price 810 an inexpensive set to get another cleaner and some neat accessories overall 710 not a bad set after all pretty average but still quite good to buy if your towns required more cleaners hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelfwhen moderated edited by whitefang 04 july 2008  0344 pm	positive
thanks for the review  not a bad price of course its impulse for a fig a little cleaner thing and two accesories the brush fig and spade i dont have yet so i might just pick this up	positive
looking at this is making me want to build one of the favourite sets of my childhood 6649 street sweeper might do that today actually cheap good pieces despite the lack of a bin lid thats just inviting disaster isnt it nice fig and one of those blue brushes which ive always loved but never managed to use thanks whitefang	positive
glad you guys like the review brainbox on jul 3 2008 0619 pm said looking at this is making me want to build one of the favourite sets of my childhood 6649 street sweeper might do that today actually cheap good pieces despite the lack of a bin lid thats just inviting disaster isnt it nice fig and one of those blue brushes which ive always loved but never managed to use the 6649 looks lovely and i hope you managed to restore it indeed a bin without a lid is inviting trouble	positive
thank you for the nice review this set looks good i have too many of the blue sweepthings but the fig is nice and i didnt have this face so i will pick up one some day	positive
wow what a great little impulse set i relly dig the face as well as a chance to get some cool accessories like a broom bin no lidsigh and a mushroom top hat a really nice review and story too whitefang i think this guy will be joining my set of lego when he shows up in australia cheers isc	positive
thanks for the review poor little minifig this guy has to haul the heavy machine all the way from the depot onto the littered streets to locate some trash but when he has finally found some and switches on the machine everything will be launched towards his pants no wonder hes looking sad a nice set though and inventive too when it comes to streetsweepers i remember getting the first of its kind on my birthday in 1991	positive
hello all eurobricks members i will be doing a continuation of my impulse set reviews this will be the third review at a go hope everyone of you will find this review useful in a way name coast guard kayak theme lego system  town  city year 2008 pieces 21 minifigs 1 an image of a 5621 coast guard kayak roll roll roll your boat it seemed the coast guard has a kayak of his own roaming in the sea making sure that swimmers will be safe in the beach now i am illustrating him as a life guard instead this set is simply wonderful among the 4 new impulse sets coast guard kayak is the best looking set in my opnion the kayak design is very simple but looks realistic  furthermore if you dont need it to be a coast guard kind of stuff use it as a leisure water spot instead down in the marina i will think any lego citizen will love to have some water spot in their busy life so come down here and wind down with this new sport bits and pieces kayak and the bouy the bouy is very useful to position it at the coast of your water to highlight the boundaries in the sea and warning incoming ships or vessels oh i did not make it tilted purposely there is a white round base which allow it to tilt on both ends useful parts these parts are useful to add on in your city somehow when i see that red cone i can use it as a police stop to inspect vehicles on the road or form a barricade with it the bouy base shape is unique too i like it very much it is great to attached it by the side of the boat as a life bouy the coast guards life vest and helmet are very useful for water activites the life vest was produced in past sets and now it resurfaced again i am glad these vests made their way back a look of him without the life vest summary review playability 7510 fun to play with especially the bouy when you see it moving up and down design 8510 design is simple but straight to the point especially the kayak design price 810 an inexpensive set to get more coast guards and more kayaks overall 8510 a very good set to have in your lego town the kayak is simply so lovely to me hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated	positive
excellent review i like how the new coast guard sets blare out new when you see them	positive
thank you for the nice review the set is nice the pieces are nice and the grey helmet is great for an additional star wars rebel technician	positive
one of the better impulse sets imo	positive
thanks for pics the hawk it seems to me lacks a cockpit theres not even a seat to keep the pilot from falling off perhaps it theyd redesigned it to be a backpack jetpack sort of unit using similar pieces itd at least make some sense based on the other mm impluses can we assume this goes for 35usd at that price it seems to me that the astro fighter at 5usd was already a superior impluse set guess id buy one on clearance for the minifig	neutral

thanks for your comments guys i really appericate it brainbox on jul 3 2008 0611 pm said this is quite a nice set actually it evokes some of the design elements of the mx11 while looking different enough to justify me buying it the head on the astronaut is one i like so even better i hadnt realised it was that one actually does 26 pieces make it one of the bigger impulses sets i think i may have to get one if not two imo impulse set total piece count should be 30 or less it will be ideal and more ways to construct a much better impulse sets such as past impulse sets that we came across i may be wrong on the 30 piece count thing but this is how i view impulse sets brainbox on jul 3 2008 0611 pm said plus its called crystal hawk how can that not be considered cool do you know i bought this set mainly because it have such a cool name attached with it crystal hawk i simply fell in love with that name	positive
thanks for the great review now i just have to have that set	positive
thank you for the nice review this set has a very classic space feeling so i dont care about the lack of cockpit a nice little set with a nice minifig	positive
once again another outstanding review by sveltecorps i am not a very big fan of agents but this theme defintely offer plenty of useful parts this volcano base is simply fanastic for parts usage especially in doing up landscaping with mountains by making use of the brown burps i must admit that the exterior looks real cool but the interior looks rather empty these orange slopes certainly make a great illustration of the larva which gives the agents a hard time to infiltrate within its compound to save his comrade i am quite sure this set will defintely attracts lots of kids to coax their parents to buy it since the bright colors will defintely caught their attention with all those hitech sleek weaponary i am sure this is the next big thing for kids out there well i am not sure if this theme works for me as well but this set defintely works well for landscaping project	positive
thanks for another great review i definitely like this set sure the interior might be a bit bare but i think that the outside of the base with all of the great lava and rocks more than makes up for it it is a bit weird that on the one side there is nothing on the inside but thats easy to fix anyone know when this will be out in the us thanks again for the fantastic review	positive
excellent review sc thanks for sharing the figs are awesome i really like the female villain  an excellent face i also like the agent uniforms the laser gun is perfect it has that peter sellerspink panther dooms day device look that i envision when i think of laser destruction the volcano has some neat features as well like the trans redorange lava it is a bit heavy on stickers though as are many new setsthemes but overall i think this set will really appeal to the kids  a great review of a neat set	positive
awsome review dude im proably getting this though the main downfall is there is hardly an inside	neutral
thanks for the stepbystep set looks great mmmmm clawdette	positive
thanks for the review sveltecorps i have yet to purchase an agent set but i think that will change shortly i am not a big fan of the stickers but the huge laser gun the unique minifig design and beaucoup transorange pieces have me sold	positive
i know the word secret base but whats this the base is hardly secret with a massive laser gun and wide screen sticking out it looks good lots and lots of orange woo	positive
this will be a wonderful set for a mustafar moc	positive
woo rock raiders only the best theme ever thats right possibly even better than castle 07 cheers for the review metalandi hopefully you can inspire others to see the greatness of rock raiders too i love how everything was so simple yet so effective it was loads of fun to play with and build the alternate models when i was younger as well and probably still is  do you plan of doing any other reviews or do you have any other sets rapid rider is another great small one adding a bit of diversity with a waterbased vehicle and you get the bandit minifig or you could get the rock raiders set and get all of our spelunking friends dont make me name them all  or if you want a slightly bigger set loader dozer could be the way to go axles a pretty cool minifig too and you get a rock monster sorry if the last comments were detracting from your review dont think i didnt like it becuase it was great i really hope you can do more oh and yes my torso does come from a female fig peace	positive
unfortunately i dont have any other sets yet i think i got one of the bigger vehicles back in the time but i dont have any sets from this time anymore but i certainly plan to get the loader dozer andor the chrome crusher soon i found an ebay auction where somebody is selling the sets 4940 4950 and 4970 new  sealed hopefully i have luck with that its only at 4 euros right now but its still running 6 days httpcgiebaydewtaitih005	neutral
great review  man this brings me back i still have like 5 of those rock monsters in response to your statement rock raiders does belong in this forum being everything space related 1 its on an alien planet 2 in the computer games start and in the story yes there was a computer gamemy cousin has it they are in a space ship 3 there are huge alien rock monsters trying to kill them	positive
great review and such a nice figure i consider rock raiders space too i also consider many of the diver themes space as well ive yet to own a rock raiders set i have tried to buy a few off ebay but they always went too high	neutral
rock raiders was one of my favorite lego themes ever	positive
sinner on jul 20 2008 0456 pm said i consider rock raiders space too i also consider many of the diver themes space as well me too the rock raiders are very scifi with the best lego space storyline the aquazonies would be inner space rather than outer space though but they look very spacey edited by shoc 20 july 2008  0745 pm	neutral
7663 sith infiltrator year 2007 number of pieces 310 number of minifigs 1 price 2999 usd brickset hello everyone and welcome to my second review on eurobricks the sith infiltrator lets start with a pic of the box shall we as you can see its a limited edition set meaning the fig and set could be worth a lot in the future this set takes about 20 minuets for the seasoned builder an overview of the infiltrator also know as the scimitar as seen in the picture this ship is very sleek with very few studs on top snot studs not on top basically its the cockpit with two wings with two fins on each wing attached to the hull heres a side view of the scimitar very cool looking it lands on two feet in the front while the cockpit rests on the ground rear view the back the outer cockpit is beautiful a printed piece on the back no dreaded sticker sheet dss and a large printed disc on top heres a look at the middle there is a flickfire missile transred cone attach to technic pin on the inner wing a transred lightsaber blade in the back of the hull and a transred lightsaber blade in between the fins on either side all of those lightsaber blades may come in handy hey look the fins open from the wings the fins open due to double hinges on each fin unfortunately you have to hold the ship up in order for the bottom fins to open now lets have a look inside the cockpit to open you lift the back printed part which is attached to the printed disc on top which is attached to a hinge it opens pretty smoothly but is somewhat loose so sometimes it closes on its own also the disc isnt secured well enough to the door and often breaks off even with the smallest movement to it inside there is an elevated control panel and two sliding pieces near the floor this ship also comes with a small speeder bike its very cleverly built and is a really neat addition see that clear disc on the bottom it fits perfectly into the sliding pieces in the cockpit hmm whats this a hidden compartment now this was a very cool idea by tlg a secret compartment found by taking off the top slope of the hull contains darth mauls weapons and tools which include a chrome lightsaber hilt a pair of electrobinouculars and three probe droids a closeup of a probe droid just a plain black minifig head with a black lever on top finally the fig darth maul in the flesh plastic a good fig altogether with a black hood and lightsaber blades taken from the ship he did come with a crisp new black cape packaged in a small white cardboard box but i am currently using it for another fig note that this is a limited edition fig so stock up a comparison pic of the two mauls the 2007 version is on the left and the 1999 version on the right note a few key differences between the two the new one has smaller red tattoos and a smoother torso also the new one has bigger eyes and a more cartoony look maul on the speeder bike of course he fits perfectly in the cockpit wile sitting on the bike and he can reach the controls well thats about it here is the final verdict build 810 easy and fun breaks every once in a while playability 710 this set has many features but is very fragile between the cockpit and hull and between the two cockpit pieces swooshability 110 too fragile to fly around plus the flick fire missiles fall out minifigs 910 a great fig with a chrome hilt and a double sided blade a little cartoony design 710 very clever techniques very sleek but very fragile price 810 fair enough could be a few dollars cheaper overall score 6510 a very sleek ship with clever building and play techniques but very very fragile and shouldnt be picked up off of the shelf too often and with that my review is over but all of yours are not comments and thoughts very welcome edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0259 am indexed	neutral
jimbutcher on jul 10 2008 0944 pm said a hidden compartment now this was a very cool idea by tlg a secret compartment found by taking off the top slope of the hull youre supposed to slide the front of the hull off rather than lift the top piece off	neutral
ill be honest  i dont like this ship at all its one of my least favourite ships in the pt and i have to yet buy either one of those sets i also found it funny that this set was meant to be a walmart exclusive yet never appeared on the shelves at my walmart anyhow thanks for the review	negative
led zeppelin on jul 10 2008 0446 pm said youre supposed to slide the front of the hull off rather than lift the top piece off yeah i was looking at the construction booklet and it reminded me of that i forgot about it but that makes it more fragile	neutral
nice review jim i think i would only buy this for darth maul though you definitely showcased all the cool features really well	neutral
trudop561 on jul 11 2008 0630 am said i got this set last year and i think you made a mistake when you have remove a piece to access the probe droids and equipment you just have to slide the entire main part and i have a question is this equipped with the new flickfire missiles that dont fall off yes i realized the first part  as for the flickfire missiles the do fall off very easily	neutral
a very neatly designed sith infiltrator though i think it lacks the size of the older version a fine ship but not what i would call a sith infiltrator it should be bigger thanks for another fine sw review kimt	negative
hey all so i purchased the remaining three agents sets i needed and saw that there was no review up yet for this set heres the first batch of parts and the first instruction bits the mini figures the first small vehicles heres a mistake that i found in the instruction booklet there is no difference between steps 2 and 3 the team inferno boat this is a nice chunky boat that looks fairly heavy duty and evily its nice to see the smooth disks on the bottom that lego seemingly havnt done in recent boatplane sets and the agents submarine this is a nice build aswell nice and long with a few hidden compartments one for missiles a place to put the treasure some final shots of the completed set the spare bits another special mention has to go out to slime face i think he is my favourite ever lego character the detail on his unique torso is brilliant his head is fantastic and his costume just looks great with the black and green plus green is my favourite colour check out the back of his torso with the slime pouring down deep sea quest was £3499 price  910  this is a pretty reasonable price for a fairly substantial set parts  810  a lot of nice bits few nice boats bits and a lot of smooth disk things minifigures  1010 as i said slime face is my favourite lego character and the details brilliant vehicles  810 both very good with some interesting features build  810 a pretty fun build overall  910 its gotta be if just for slime face alone but this really is a great set	positive
im not real fond of slimeface he looks too much like the jokerbombs i was hoping for something newer the slime printing is a nice touch though steve	negative
thanks for reviewi hope svelt corps still reviews it  slime is pretty cool i knew about the torse for a while but its no less cool now	positive
sveltecorps on jul 11 2008 0914 am said i would have liked it if theyd gone all the way and made it some kind of giant robot jellyfish or squid coughalphateamcough anyway i was about to reply earlier and say  great review svelte then i realised it was not you nice reveiw anyway the only reason i would get this set would be if i got all the other agents sets  all the sw cw sets  all the pieces i need on bl  all the new city ect setsthen i would think about geting it	neutral
thanks for the review its great to see detailed pictures of slime face the set looks good but not as good as some of the others in this line great review	neutral
i feel like a n00b asking but what is the usd price i didnt see a price in the review	neutral
it was £3499 so usd its likely to be 4555 i would imagine	neutral
great review really thanks i slime face even slimey as my slime sense nice that break jaw is also in it undersigned mowo	neutral
aside from the price i love this set when i saw the prelim pics of agetns i did not like the theme but all the sets are starting to look more attractive now i can see the cool features and details as for this set i really like the badguy boat for some reason and the submarine looks good  i love the dark blue colour	positive
i forgot to comment on this review great job rezourceman like sveltecorps said your pics really show off the set and what there is to it i just ordered this and the volcano base off sh and i cant wait for them to come so ill comment on these reviews i forgot about i love the inferno boat as you say in your review it looks very heavy duty and ready to take on the agents the sub i quite like from the look of it though there is the problem of too little space i will try and correct that the dark blue is especially good and i love slime face his torso is very cool sveltecorps on jul 11 2008 0914 am said i cant say this is my favourite agents set the boat is a little oddly proportioned and the sub although retro looking has practically no interior and would be difficult to customise to put more in unlike say the clever job batbrick did with the penguin sub in his review wow thanks for that little mention is it impossible or just very hard to mod sveltecorps on jul 11 2008 0914 am said i do agree with you about slime face  he has a fantastic torso with all the slime dripping down which is a bit obscured by the air tank its really encouraging that in the last 2 missions weve had great extra villains added in the only thing i would add about the octopus is that the glow in the dark plastic is mixed in unevenly with the aqua blue so it doesnt glow in the dark evenly  its kind of like the mars mission jellies in that respect though much cooler the octopus sounds great thanks for that is he meant to be on any side im guessing hes a mutant inferno creature about slime face is his head much different to the joker bombs i know he has slime marks on his head are they very apparent thanks again for the review batbrick away	positive
batbrick on jul 19 2008 0953 am said is it impossible or just very hard to mod nothing is impossible to mod probably the easiest part to change would be the front where the missiles are and the treasure chest slides out  you could make a sizeable compartment there however the middle section is so narrow and the end fins are just that  fins  that it might be harder to expand without changing the shape of the sub youll find out soon when yours arrives batbrick on jul 19 2008 0953 am said the octopus sounds great thanks for that is he meant to be on any side im guessing hes a mutant inferno creature about slime face is his head much different to the joker bombs i know he has slime marks on his head are they very apparent its not really clear but since all the other mutants are evil or at least controlled by dr inferno its probably a safe bet the squid is too slime faces head is different to the joker bombs  different eyes and teeth although the smile is similar i guess and the slime marks are much more apparent in the flesh or abs although they dont photograph that way joker bomb face below for contrast	neutral

thanks for the review this is one of my favorite space sets of all time i even had 2 of them back in the days my only complain about this set was that i found that the wheels where too small  i had some trouble passing the rover over the little cratersmountains of the space plates	positive
this is a great little set i like how it combines two very different color schemes for different parts of the model i have made some slight modifications to mine adding a roof on the vehicle and a back wall on the outpost also those white 1x1 headlight plates at the front are thinner than the modern kind and seem to be quite weak i got this set off ebay a while ago and one of them was broken in shipping even though the set was otherwise in display model condition and the other one broke off while i was building the set i replaced them with the newer variety mutex on jul 10 2008 1137 pm said my only complain about this set was that i found that the wheels where too small  i had some trouble passing the rover over the little cratersmountains of the space plates the only bad thing about this set is the name it cant even roll over a single plates height not very all terrain at all edited by cp5670 11 july 2008  0743 am	positive
thanks for another informative review of the best lego theme ever and not in attempt to hijack your thread but to add to it heres a pic of my blacktron 1 version of this beautiful set the 6927 has to rate as one of the best 5 classic space sets ever along with 918 6970 and 928	positive
give me an excuse to sneak into your house and let me have a feel of these classic space sets i never had a chance to have any experience with the classic space sets through your recent reviews on these it gave me a wider perspective of space i loved to play space as a child such as the late classic and futuron sets back to the review this 6927 is a great mobile command center vehicle suitable for all kinds of harsh terrain in the unknown space the 6 big wheels are real solid and firm back in those days transparent blue windscreen at the front is wonderful i just love these parts especially when its in blue 4 computer printed tiles arent lego so generous back in those days when printed parts are more commonly available unlike now its a real nice set however there is one thing i dont understand about this design why is the driver seat has a wide back with no cover behind and the command center has no door at the back i understand that these space guys are always carrying their helmet around for oxygen supply i wonder if there is a better answer to it	positive
dovchenko on jul 10 2008 0824 pm said no more of your great reviews why a good review right here got into the thick of the set without becoming boring with an absence of pictures or not having enough text ive exhausted my collection of classic space sets id love to keep them going but just one more set you can check out this index for a complete listing and links to each of the reviews thanks for the feedbback mutex on jul 10 2008 0937 pm said this is one of my favorite space sets of all time i even had 2 of them back in the days my only complain about this set was that i found that the wheels where too small  i had some trouble passing the rover over the little cratersmountains of the space plates it is a gem in the classic space collection the playability is great i agree with you as i never thought this was much of an allterrain vehicle with the wheel construction the bottom of the vehicle would always touch the bottom of nonsmooth surfaces the wheels do need to be bigger but i still like them cp5670 on jul 10 2008 1043 pm said i got this set off ebay a while ago and one of them was broken in shipping even though the set was otherwise in display model condition and the other one broke off while i was building the set i replaced them with the newer variety great buy on this one what did it cost you hewman on jul 10 2008 1111 pm said not in attempt to hijack your thread but to add to it heres a pic of my blacktron 1 version of this beautiful set thats excellent i love the alternate color scheme great job here whitefang on jul 11 2008 1211 am said however there is one thing i dont understand about this design why is the driver seat has a wide back with no cover behind and the command center has no door at the back i understand that these space guys are always carrying their helmet around for oxygen supply i wonder if there is a better answer to it yes the extra space was probably for the oxygen tanks on the figs it makes taking them off a lot easier as for the labcontrol center i never had an issue with it being open i think this was just for playability one could always pretend that some sort of invisible force ray closed the side when activated great comments i love hearing what others think of these classics	positive
quote great buy on this one what did it cost you it was 30 which was a pretty good price given the condition it had no box or instructions though this set is actually fairly common on ebay though considering how old it is i see them pretty frequently on there quote its a real nice set however there is one thing i dont understand about this design why is the driver seat has a wide back with no cover behind and the command center has no door at the back i understand that these space guys are always carrying their helmet around for oxygen supply i wonder if there is a better answer to it i just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed edited by cp5670 11 july 2008  0639 pm	neutral
ive always associated this set with 6929 the voyager theyre of the same timeframe and more or less the same style 6927 is without any doubt my favourite ground vehicle of space it was pretty simple but it was such a creative set the stories you could tell with this model g most defenitely in my top 5 of space sets	positive
this set never got me as a kid i suspect it was because of the wheels i had mostly basic sets so it would have been more of the same looking at it now i can see i have misjudged it and i love the lablift method im going to have to build this to see it in action thanks for another great review	positive
great review allterrain vehicle was one of my two favorite lego sets ever i have to include a shot of the back of the box because i love the ideas lego provided for this set hewman on jul 11 2008 0111 am said very nice blacktronthemed 6927 cp5670 on jul 11 2008 0139 pm said i just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed i love your modified 6927 with the enclosed front 2 weeks ago i modified my allterrain vehicle as well in a similar way but just slightly more modified from the original i call it 6927c allterrain vehicle improved class a few clues for anyone to easily build this themselves also a much more extensive modificationmoc that i call 6927w allterrain warrior quote 6927w allterrain warrior i wanted to make a combat variant of 6927 so i used the 6927c improved class as the starting point and went from there i added a completely new forwardcab close to the ground for a groundobserver to monitor the terrain i added even larger wheels allowing this variant to truly be all terrain besides what good is it having a combat vehicle if it gets stuck in the middle of a firefight the 6927w has a five man crew a driver a gunner who also serves as overallcommander a terrain observer in the very front in the lab are the weapons systems officer and computertech specialist the allterrain warrior vehicle portion is armed with lasers and blaster cannons with options for other weapons there are shortrange nuclear rockets on the lab guided by the rader control the lab now has blastproof shutters on the windows protecting the crew from rocket blast additional protection can be added to the lab ifneedbe such as more extensive blastshielding allinall the allterrain warrior is a beast of a machine two 6927s can protect an entire convoy of standard 6927 or 6927c these are my very first attempts at modification and doing a moc of classic space lego edited by parallaxscroll 29 august 2009  0303 am	neutral

yeah first time that i am getting a set before everyone first of all the package the european version has no limited edition button hooray sorry for the blurry backshot we see the hospital back a few bubbles with set functions and a little comic comic bubbles the figures are injured spongebob patrick and the new fish doctor spongebob has a headprint and a backprint other than the normal spongebob spongebob and injured bob the set comes with two litters the ambulance car is a bit extraordinary i don´t know how the car is like in the show and i saw a lot of episodes but it looks a bit strange mostly because the weehls are too small of course we get another ss not so d this time the litter fits in the back with help of this lid i wish it would be the hingelid from before 2004 now we come to the meanpart of the set the hospital the entrance has got babyblue traindoors and a hudge sign that shows emergency the tubes are nearly everywhere in this set i was getting insane when i came to the part where i must put the stickers on the tubes this parts are very usefull but i wanted that the set looks good because i will display it so i stickered just two of the parts and not all four now we come to the interroir the doctor has a desk with computer sadly it´s not very well placed and he must duck because of his fin next to the door we get this little case wash basin and two drawers again we get stickers not that i don´t like stickers it´s just everytime i get to the part where i must put the stickers on i think how i can reuse the model and if i rebuild the model later and and and i hate it to deside a few posters are in it too the set is a great addittion to your own bikino bottom but the playability is not very big for the kids they can just play that patrick steals the ambulance car like shown on the package and is hitting spongebob than the drive back the doctor gives spongebob two medicines and let him go i bought the set mostly because of the parts tubes in lightbley and a few woodpieces but i am thinking about let it stand in my little bikini bottom just consist of crusty crab and chum bucket playability 310 figures 1010 price 810 design 910 total 3040	positive
thanks for the review looks like a great set im surprised that spongebobs bandage has a full body headprint so kudos to lego for that	positive
oh so spongebob was the injured one i thought this set depicted the episode wherein mr krabs was the one rushed to the hospital	neutral
i love the sponge bob sets i have all of them nice review	positive
great review i want that set mainly for patric and the spongebob with the bandage but why does bob have full length pants i thought he wore briefs	neutral
i ordered the set via sh and it cost 3499€ in germany 3799€ in belgium and 50 in australia it looks like it´s a exclusive set but without the 2limited edition sticker on the package in the usa it´s not aviable now i think it costs as much as the rocket ride 30  mrs pegleg he has the same short pants like in the other sets	neutral
nice review the set looks promising	positive
wow that set looks better than i thought i just might get it if its under 30 usd i love all the details inside and it seems to have a better interior than the city hospital and the new figs look nice	positive

the official name for this lego set is the emergency room i have all the other spongebob sets including three krusty krabs two bikini bottoms as well as one of everything else  now all i need to do is wait until next month to buy this set if i find it at my local toys r us that spongebob minifig looks cute	positive
im not a huge fan of spongebob but this set i might want also have maybe i can combine it with the city hospital	positive
this set doesnt have much playability but the hospital is better than the one released by lego recently it has more detail i like it	neutral
thanks navy trooper fenson for the review  good one  i really like that sb is printed i will need to get this one when i go to the us in two weeks copmike	positive
nice review nft i´m not that much into spongebob but these two pieces just for themselves are interesting to get container cupboard 4532 and cupboard drawer 4536 the latter not being sold for the last 6 years both together are an excellent way to create detailed interiors 6 of those for me please	positive
theres a lot great pieces in this set i would be willing to get the set just for them thanks for the great review	positive
yay its good to see your kids get to build some stuff too sinner  all through the review i was thinking this was a present  but who actually put it together so im glad the last pic cleared things up as for the set  it looks much bigger than i expected  i think it does make a good sized dollhouse there are a stack of nice pieces in there  cupboards oven transblue 2x5 bricks all the accessories plants flowers food the lightup brick the pink roof slopes  but not enough to justify the aud129 retail price maybe on sale id pick it up and resell the belville figs but david jones hasnt even had a regular 20 off lego sale for the whole of this year that ive seen i think the playful puppy set is a horrendous ripoff for aud20 though i agree with the baby catapult  the range is terrible lego just isnt trying any more is it at least theyve moved on from throwing cats off three storey buildings 2 questions though 1 was it a fun build 2 are those large figs anatomically correct under their froufrou finery if not what the hell are they doing in the second pic whilst baby sylvia explores the oven	neutral
excellent review its nice to see how its nice to see how   its nice  okay i cant get over the sex in the bedroom and the unattended baby crawling into the oven i didnt read anything else except where does the puppy sleep and my daughter made me build this you are sick and twisted and thats why i love you it seems you are coining the belville edge now will you please stop sitting around eating clams and get that baby out of the oven or make the fun in the bedroom a threeway please thank you ps ok i read it i want the baby toilet and i think the jellyfish is supposed to be a jellomold i bet you knew that the fireplace lattice look like the harry potter one and not the fabuland one boo wienies when your daughter outgrows it will you turn it into a belleville star wars moc please thank you in advance	positive
great review and i note something like a bucket in the dog set shame its not blue as for the fire place piece i love it and i want one ever since finding it on mlcad i love the bbq it looks so good you know i might even buy this it it was not so pink now as for the kiddies in ovens make sure they are not over cooked they can be stringy  and as for the couple up stairs now we at least know what you do with your mini figs when no one is looking lego sets in public places  just following your name sake i guess and i must say lego shame shame that catapult needs reviwing hardly even make a dent in a castle wall regards cpt pb	positive

sinner you know i had never seen a belville set in any review with such great pictures before i just cant take my eyes off in the master bedroom the scene is quite a little hot enough of me peeping up there lets take a look at the interior i am very surprised by its construction of the house its quite big and is nice of you to buy a great sweet gift for your daughter i am very sure she will enjoyed playing with it somehow it reminded me of barbie doll products maybe its too pinkish for me the accessories is the plus factor in any belville sets it offered quite a handful of great accessories to add into any types of mocs construction to add in the plus factor in it sinner you are a very nice dad i like how parents buy educational toys for their children to expand their imaginations instead of sitting in a couch playing video games and etc	positive

7654 droids battle pack year 2007 number of pieces 102 number of minifigs 7 price 999 usd brickset hi everybody and welcome to my fourth review on eurobricks today i will review the droid bttle pack set note this set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid but i replaced them along with the crooked arms with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms a picture of the box as it is on the shelves of majorretail stores a small box as expected for inexpensive sets like these note the build your army button on the front tlg obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples and with good reason which will be explained later in this review an overview of the sets content you can see a droid carrying vehicle a stap and some battle super battle droids a look at the carrier a light tank note the guns on the front the guns and cockpit can turn a little bit left and right from the main body also the guns can move up and down free from the cockpit and check out the cockpit two 2x1 center studded plates side by side for the pilot to stand on now moving on to the stap a small very useful vehicle in the sw universe these are seen frequently in both the movies and games as well as other multimedia the design is very clever using vertical building and a clear stand rear view the guns handlebars can go this far back and finally the figs the figs are very good but very common we havent seen sbds in a while and now instead of metallic blue they are metallic dark grey the worst part of this set is that the battle droids have the old arms and guns while the droids in the mtt and clone pack both of the same year as this have the new ones i wonder why tlg decided to do that again this set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid but i replaced them along with the crooked arms with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms so thats about it heres the final verdict build 810 very easy should take the seasoned builder about 510 minutes playability 610 has a few play feature but nothing exciting is good for mocs and army building swooshability 810 i suppose you could fly around the stap minifigs 710 the battle droids are good but very common and the dont come with new arms or guns the sbds are very nice and in a new color all figs are great for army building design 810 the stap was clever but the carrier was a little bulky price 1010 as fair as it gets overall 7510 the figs are great to have and make mocs and armies and the vehicles are pretty cool the carrier is a little lame the main problem with this set is that the bds dont get the new guns or arms so they dont fit in with all the new sets also droids arent as cool as clones but the price is very fair and now my review has ended unfortunately i believe this will be my last review for a long time for two reasons one the remaining sets that arent done according to kimts index i either dont have or are broken or have missing pieces and two my budget is low right now and i wont be able to get the clone wars sets right when they are released so someone will probably beat me to reviewing them too bad because i would love to do an rgs review well as always comments very welcome	positive

hello all eurobricks members and town lovers this is my first classic town review for today i will be featuring the 6641 4wheelin truck which is produced in 1987 for some younger members in eb you might not have encounter such a baby roaming down the streets horning at others with its big massive truck considering this is a 1987 set such a vehicle size is considered big in those days name 4wheelin truck theme lego system  town year 1987 pieces 80 minifigs 1 price usd650 an image of a 6641 4wheelin truck hello everyone why the name 4wheelin truck it is because this truck is equipped with 4 heavy duty wheels which is considered big among other small vehicles in classic town please take note most of the vehicles that are produced in classic town era are 4studs wide this truck is no exception meet the driver and his truck this truck has a very good combinations of different colors that are common for most town vehicles it made used of blue white and red as its primary combinations i find that this combinations is quite soothing to its eyes especially the blue bricks in addition the minifig torso is superb the driver must be a great fan of this vehicle i realised most truck drivers in the classic town era wear this most of the time i wonder if its some kind of an organization front view there is 2 red doors coupled with the truck to enable the driver to get in properly this vehicle is considered big in the 1980s however if you compared it with the current city vehicles this truck certainly will not outsize the current designs please take note of the wheels the wheels are pretty different i dont remember seeing these wheels in many other vehicles maybe some members can help me on this most of the classic town vehicles have a window frame on top which is known as a sunroof in this set this feature is also included furthermore the vehicle frame has a simple mechanism which all town lovers love it is to lift it up and place their driver in and out the seat most importantly you do not have to take off the entire window frame just to put in the driver different angles of the 4wheelin truck snot technique back 20 years ago lego had been experimenting with snot technique you can see that the back looks very neat without the studs in addition it can be quite useful to place a minifig on top of it or throw some baggage for some quick getaway summary review playability 810 great addition to your town collection design 8510 very good design i love 4studs truck at least it is able to occupy one side of the lane price 910 an inexpensive set based on the 1987 pricing overall 8510 a must have for all classic town lovers we have been complaining for more wider range of vehicle i gave it a 4 based on my review score card what about yours hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated edited by whitefang 13 july 2008  1208 pm	positive
glad you guys liked this review bernddasbrot on jul 13 2008 0733 pm said great review of a lovely set thank you sadly i dont see my 6641 really often because it is kind of in the back of my shelf but i might get it and swoosh it  a few times imho i think 6675 is a little bit more aggressive cool please make more swoosh it around i will prefer to use it to vrooom it around on my road baseplates bernddasbrot thanks for reminding me of the 6675 i will need to find it and restore it first meanwhile watch out for more upcoming classic town reviews	neutral
whitefang on jul 13 2008 1125 am said the wheels are pretty different i dont remember seeing these wheels in many other vehicles maybe some members can help me on this first of all another great review thanks for doing these as for the wheels these were primarily technic wheels but did find their way into some other models in white i can only find a handful of minifig sets that they are included with theres half a dozen space sets but apart from the 4wheelin truck the only other town set appears to be the 6524 blizzard blazer tractor with snow plough the wheels were also in a train set called 4549 road  rail hauler where they were the wheels on a big forklift cheers rog	neutral
love this set nice review also i had the set in my hands a few times but never bought it though i drooled at it i remember i guess i didnt get pocket money at that time it was not that common around europe in the 80s i guess so better to say that no one bought it for me a few years later i got the safari truck which is also really sweet i like the colors of this model and the detail of it the minifig is really classic made only for this set appears in some later train sets as well and shows the exact image of the truck on the shirt including the motor piece one of the most detailed and loveliest little sets from a sweet era of legoland city ps voted o for outstanding edited by zzz 14 july 2008  0950 am	positive
hmmm i probably would not have bought this as a kid in 1987 unless i had money to spare or the shop had no other set from space or castle the two other big lines in 1987 and no better set in the town section i think its a great parts pack but the model itself does not look very attractive i never really liked those wheels honestly theyre from the basic sets mostly and they work pretty well in those but im just not a fan the roof on the other hand was very popular and the blue modified bricks at the front were quite rare in those days but generally speaking this was not the star of 1987 gave it a 3	negative

i now found pics too thats absolutely  after 10188 town plan this is the best city set ever i really like the neat landscape with the little hill there are a bench and some flowers on it too  and this brilliant cottage  great idea with that power function that the wind mill turns and then enable the lights of the cottage  concerning the city theme i must say in the last time tlg comes up with one great surprise after the other does anyone know where and when itll be available this year i think  otherwise there wouldnt be already pics would they and how much itll cost i think about 70 euros what do you think i only hope that itll be available in germany too otherwise i would be really if i am not able to get it since it is a must for every city and environment fan klausdieter edited by klausdieter 14 july 2008  0649 pm	neutral

i recently got a few still sealed and new sets from the 90 on ebay and after the rock raiders hover scout this isthe second one ill review i really like the space port theme even if the sets may be more simple than earlier space city sets i like the overall look and the color scheme but enough of that lets go on with the pictures set nr 6455 name space simulation station number of minifigs 3 number of pieces 240 release year 1999 first again a few pics of the boxes and the instructions the main box this theme had a kinda strange seperation of the pieces the parts for the control center and the shuttle are in seperate little boxes and the others are in polybags with the models printed on them also seperate instructions for each step a general overview we got 3 lovely minifigs here from left to right the control engineer the mechanic and the astronaut the i dont know the english word for it testingthing the astronaut is being tested to hard nerves there the mechanics little car on the back an extinguisher and a radio device is attached the takeoff station for the little shuttle with the shuttle itself on it and without it tools tools tools the shuttle as standalone i think that would be fuel tanks i like this little detail and finally we have the controll room would have been better with seats but its alright a really sweet midsized set if you ask me a few juniorized parts but it fits perfectly with the set the theme itself is also great and i wish that tlg brings it back i could see stunning sets with the quality city sets have right now	positive
you just bring memorys back i never had one of the space port sets but i know that as a little boy i visited my toy store and kept on looking to the boxes on bl those sets cost too much for what ist worth today really tlc should bring this theme back space port on	positive
in the catalog images i thougt that the base was on a 1616 baseplate i have some sets of spaceport and like them but i would want real town sets in 1999 edited by lord santos 15 july 2008  1058 am	neutral

my sister got this from our grandparents once when she was interested with space but it fell into my hands later i had a lot of fun with that by the way the name for the test thing is called a centrifuge it tests a persons ability to withstand high gforces edited by filefolders 15 july 2008  0355 pm	positive
minibump wow id completely forgotten about this theme which is suprising since i absolutely loved this theme as a kid minus the sound n light brick which i thought was pretty big and ugly sure brings back memories of looking at those little catalogue booklets that came with the sets	positive
i had never seen this set or this theme before it was released during my dark age and i had missed it its nice to see such sets surface once again to educate members like me that there are some good sets we had missed during the dark age and i must admit that this is a very good set its comes with 3 minifigs and staudie with it geez i never thought he was an astronaunt back then the testing facility is great and i love to see it spin by putting staudie in it for a testrun the buggy is cute as well but somehow i dont really like the white frame at the back it looked a little odd to me the tools are simply wonderful to have furthermore these are grey tools the last time we had so many tools are the aeroplane mechanic the shuttle is nice but does the shuttle supposed to come with a cover as well i guess since this is a simulator they must have cut down the budget for it the control room is good and it will be even better with chairs included metalandi thanks for the wonderful review	neutral
thank you very much for the review now i remember i got mission control when i was only 5 and built it with the help of my older sister i loved it so much i never rebuilt it but now i just have to space simulation was one i never got but looks to be a great set	neutral

update i will be merging reviews as they go idle this is now the dino attack review thread what jays not doing viking reviews nope i think christopher110 took care of those just fine instead i have brought you what is most possibly the highestanticipated set of the year  d  the t1 typhoon and i gotta say  dinos apart its actually really cool the dinos lets get the worst over with yes those are all the parts in that dino	negative
the figs theyre possibly the best part of the entire set all in all nice new head although the glasses limit its usability i am in love with the head on that fig its perfect for any number of figures  a good scarred hero face has always been on my want list im turning him into my viking warlord after i post this review again a new head great stubbly beard thing going on my secondfavorite head of the lot great for warriors especially with helms the torsos are fantastic for special forces figures if anyones planning to do something like that not too fond of the lime green on there but its still extremely usable this is actually a really cool machine gun i like it i think this would be a good point to note that all designs you see  outside the figures and dinos  are stickers that means a crapload of stickers if you cant stand stickers at all in a set dont buy this	positive
the copter this is one bigass copter the photos really dont do the size justice lower cockpit with cool computer too bad its a sticker although ill definitely leave this one on upper cockpit with cool computer see above awesome gatling gun yes even the technic beams have stickers im actually really fond of that little canister thing i can see using it elsewhere yes  thats a sticker the rope and hook i forgot to mention it before this set comes with two accessories besides the machine gun  binocs and one of those little things to slide down the rope also the thing that extends the rope turns the other side because theyre slightly asymmetrical one of my favorite stickers the door says survival equipment its on both sides definitely a keeper	positive
another of my favorite parts  landing gear this is the front section  and it retracts unlike most ships with landing gear this does not retract without effort coughxwingcough very sleek the back landing gear  and again smooth retraction gotta love it final score 8410 parts 810 figs 1010 dinos 210 copter 910 value 710 dont buy if  you can wait for vikings  you dont like any set with stickers  youre not a space fan buy if  youre a space fan  you dont mind stickersdont apply them  youre like to create cool figures overall i think it was worth the price even at 605 pieces however id suggest buying vikings even considering this well hope this review unexpected as it was  helped someone out there until next time bloody jay	positive
mr legobildur on jul 24 2005 0935 pm said as unexpected as it was this was very helpful  two questions though 1 is the front green rubber missle a traditional launchable missle or does it have another firing mechanism 2 concerning the guns on the side are they fixed in one postition or does it have any functions 3 why did you decide to buy this set just curious 1 oh i overlooked that didnt i in response its an upsidedown launcher so the switch is on the underside so no no special mechanism 2 the gatling guns can be raised but not turned 3 i found it in toys r us and was after a few of the figs but after seeing the box up close and personal decided what the heck its a good break from vikings d	neutral
great review jay  tks a lot  i am not that of the big fan of the copter due to its proportions  but i admit its really asome looking better as i expected od the best are those mfs  they are truly awsome  i wiil but some of the smaller sets just for the figs hehe too bad that my favorite  your second best  dont come in the smallers sets   are you going to review the other sets as well  that could be cool 	positive
thanks bloodyjay another brilliant review i really like the helicopter though i hate the stickers it seem like there are a lot of it it wont stop me from buying it too bad that when will the dino line arrive in singapore    guess ive have to wait for the meanwhile	positive
that looks like a really great set although i dont think id have anywhere to put it i dont think ill ever be able to get the set anyway since it doesnt come out over here	positive
hmmmm     interesting its a shame though because i really like the guns any idea when it should come to europe edit ive just scene the official dino attack site which says theyre coming to europe in october	neutral
photos are not available but basically it is guns chains ropes crates	neutral
wow great review for a great set thanks jay i really like it although to big for my city  i too really like the mfs because of your review i am definitely considering it thanks again legobmw	positive
thats interesting news about the european release id definitely be interested to see how they modify the set  chains ropes and crates are definitely useful pieces cant wait for pictures to everyone looking for just the figures  dont skip out and get the smaller set and the tank spend the extra 20 and get the t1 its well worth it i might pick up the steel sprinter and the fire hammer myself still trying to decide if i do ill review them	positive
i guess well have to wait for the photos officially announced by lego the dino attack line is going to be made available in europe in october 2005 edit check out the official dino attack site here	neutral
yeah i picked up another one i really liked the chopper lets cut straight to the chase dinos first the worst of course these things are so horrible they dont deserve more than one photo theyre rubbery one piece and the only things that remotely indicate that theyre made by lego are the holes on the bottom of their feet theyre unrealistic to an extreme unmatched by even the previously reviewed dinos in that they are waaaaaaaay too thin one is pink and theyre all grinning fig one interesting thing to note is that this one has the same torso as the ironmasked dude in the chopper not his own barearms torso pic for the sake of comparison now i dont consider this fig as good as the others because the other heads are useful for vikings and assorted castletype people but this has sunglasses all in all youll probably find it useful but i dont still great torso for special ops stuff hummer those headlights  while stickers yes all prints are again stickers although there are much less than the chopper  are great pieces i can see using them as furnace covers or stove burners the windshieldhood area not much to say about this one drivers side my question when this is brought to europe will the steering wheel switch sides  seriously though i love that little steering wheel piece more than i love taffy and im a man who enjoys his taffy left side in its entirety  and the right side view through the right side  no seat here couldve done with another fig to fill the nonexistant seat as well	positive
the weapon whatever its called this uses the same mechanism as the longboat for those that dont have either you snap the little sports stand thing which hits the missile which fires and since theres nothing holding the technic beam up to that height any more it drops down so that the next missile drops into place pretty cool if unrealistic the two on the side do not fire i think theyre mainly there for extra ammo my biggest problem with this set open bed this could have easily been remedied with a few plates interior opened the fire hammer next to the t1 they look very cool together dont they you can also see my curio shelf final score 7410 dinos 110 fig 810 but thats just me hummer 8510 parts 910 im a harsh reviewer i still think that if spacevehicles are your thing you should buy this however if youre a bigger castle fan or just like to get all sorts of lego i would still suggest buying the viking catapult before this however i do think that these are some of the coolest sets of 2005 this is something you will eventually want to get until next time bloody jay	positive
sorry for the double post but i just had another question in mind how longhighwide is this badass copter including rotors i have heard of as long as 25 inches for the length but is this true or is it just an exaggeration	neutral
wow i think this is the first time im the first to have a new set at least here and review it got it 2 days ago thanks to a fast shipping from sh this time and i found time now to review it now enough of the babbling lets let the facts and pictures speak which actually turned out pretty well this time set nr 4210 name coast guard platform number of minifigs 4 number of pieces 469 release year 2008 a few shots of the box first 2 books of instructions we got here first one for the helicopter second one for the rest and the platform itself a general overview of the platform from above the 4 minifigs 3 rescue guys and one oil rig worker  the pilot seems not very happy that he has to work in the middle of nowhere at sea right beside the entry of the tower we have the diving equipment holder next the guy can jump in this little speedboat and another guy brings it down to water with the crane if somebody is rescued from the air he arrives here and is brought to the tower with the little moving platform than runs on rails down under we got a buoy and several life belts and extinguishers with the lift somebody who is rescued by the boat can be brought up i think it would been better if they would have made a mechanism there to bring it up but its okay a few floors higher the sea is being observated and watched on the ground level we have the medical stationwarmup room the helicopter as standalone all in all for me this is besides the police station the city set of this year its got great features and looks fantastic and also has many useful pieces you cant do anything wrong with buying it 1010 for me thats all for now hope you liked my review edit oh damn i forgot to write review in the topic title can a mod please add this thanks	positive
thanks for the awesome review metalandi your pics are very clear and you go into detail about all the functions of the set i agree this is a great set  one of the best of the cg line for sure way better than the boat set with the tower on the bionicle baseplate and cheaper too i even like the helicopter better than the oversized version lots of great parts and a really nice build by the looks of it too i cant wait for this to be released in oz	positive
seeing the pictures in this review certainly reinforce my original thoughts on this set heres an oilrig mod waiting to happen	neutral
excellent review metalandi its always great to see early pictures of new sets this set really reminds me of an oil rig and could probably be easily modified as one if one wanted an alternate model the two components that i like most are the boat crane and the control room but other sections are pretty slick as well are those printed pieces in the control room or stickers im really starting to gain an appreciation for these new coast guard sets theyve come a long way over the years 575 coast guard station released 1978 i picked up the control boat  tower 7739 a few weeks ago but havent opened it yet in any case thanks for taking the time to review this set and share it over eb	positive
great set and great parts pack as well i guess i´m gonna buy this when it´s on sale just for the orange parts excellent for exo force	positive
i it i dont think im gonna buy it but i loved the review nice oil rig worker he looks so rough undersigned mowo	positive
thanks for the great review im loving this set a lot  it looks well designed and the helicopter is awesome plus i love the new worker figure with the beard quote i agree this is a great set  one of the best of the cg line for sure way better than the boat set with the tower on the bionicle baseplate i wouldnt say that at all  true this base is bigger but the other set was well designed as well  plus the included boat is wonderful	positive
metalandi on jul 19 2008 0128 am said i dont know really in which country do you live i havent been to my local stores for a while now so i dont know if they have it there but maybe ill find some time tomorrow to check it out heh i live in japan probably the only one here who does so i dont have sh at all if sh us or canada had it which they dont i could probably get it forwarded	neutral
the worker looks like he soiled his pants um oh yeah nice reveiw very cool set im not sure about the bottom floor glass being dark grey and the top floor glass being light blue	negative
i think it looks good on the real set i thought the darker glass might be good on the ground level so the rescued guy has it nice and dark in there	positive
nice review this is just the crown jewel for the coast guard theme i love the layout of its platform it looks real neat to have it placed it in the midst of the deep blue sea awaiting of any emergency rescue sometimes i feel that this set can used it to merge with my aqua raiders sets i thought of using it as a land base for the raiders to dock in their stuff before submerge into the ocean ok its just a wierd idea of mine just feel that aqua raiders and coast guard can work hand in hand since they are naval expertise it seemed i cant view all the pictures somehow nevertheless i can still view some of it quite well i love the command center the amount of computer printed pieces simply make me smile with the monitor keyboard radar screen and etc the helicopter is cute too however i pity the victim that is loaded at the back it seemed a little bit too dangerous in addition this set seemed to have quite alot of stickers which can be quite discouraging i do hope to see this set soon so far i quite like the current coast guard sets	positive
i agree with both of you first i have to add that a few of the stickers were a bit annoying as it comes to put them on espacially the ones on the helicopter where you have to put them on round parts but i didnt really see this at a bad point i really can live with it second it was a very hard decision believe it or not on which new set to buy cause i got a huge 2008 setwantlist i guess itll take some time before i can get most of the other sets i want	neutral

thats a great review of a great city set thank you very much metalandi first of all i wanted to buy the 7999 cg petrol boat  tower but now i surely will buy this amazing platform instead of the 7999 if my local toy seller sells the 4210 reason 4210 is something very unusual set i think we wont get a set similar to that in the next 20 years and because of i dont like the petrol boat inside no backwalls  nearly no interior  klausdieter	positive
great review metalandi thanks for posting it with a number of pictures the only question is why lego decided to produce so many sets i want to buy in one year	neutral
thanks i own this set it was a good time as tlg released a lot of little buildings just look through the 63xxsetnumbers	neutral
thebrickster on jul 19 2008 0230 am said i just cant believe someone would rate this set a 1 it appears to be a trend among these classic reviews never with a comment of why maybe a tfol it is our destiny to show them that lego existed before 1997 and was imho way better than today we need more classic reviews i hope i can continue with technic sets	neutral
people giving this 1 g id give it a 4 id give it a 3 but added a point out of nostalgia i think its a nice town set from the old days the only problem i always had is the lack of an ambulance and we got a female doctor 	neutral
brickster strikes again with another awesome review ah one of the few hospital related kits lego made wasnt this the first hospital with modern minifigs because i seem to remember seeing an even older hospital online that had the armless faceless figs regardless this would be great as a little doctors office in someones town layout  although the vehicle is a little silly and that eye chart sticker has to be the coolest decal ever quote maybe a tfol well it sure isnt me i personally love older kits even though im only a teen i like a lot of the newer sets a bit more than some of the classic stuff but i have always agreed that the 70s and 80s were an extremely high point in legos time even though i dont really own any kits from the period edited by grevious 19 july 2008  0505 pm	positive
gave it a 4 its not exactly town plan but its above average	positive
i like this set like most i view it more as a clinic it sits nicely in my town plan these old sets are all very cool	positive
wow old thread just for the record so long as it is here paramedics are advanced ambulance technicians unlike standard emts they are trained for advanced cardiac life support they can push drugs defibrillate place a breathing tube etc in the 1980s when the set was made it was quite common for paramedics to respond to calls in fly cars or special response units they would join up with ambulances at the scenes that required their skills if you ever watched the old american tv show emergency johnny gage and squad 51 were one of these response units they were mostly phased out in the 90s in favor of simply putting the paramedics and als gear in the ambulances	neutral
hello all eurobricks members and town lovers today i will be doing up a review on hook  haul wrecker this name is quite wierd to me i will prefer to call it the regular tow truck this is one of the service and repair vehicle that are always ready 247 on standby for any emergency towing in our towns name hook  haul wrecker theme lego system  town year 1989 pieces 44 minifigs 1 price usd600 an image of a 6660 hook  haul wrecker let the towing begins hook  haul wrecker is the typical 4studs wide vehicle that takes care of broken vehicles that is left stranded on the roads this tow truck is pretty useful as you can see current city sets hardly have any tow trucks available to tow new cars design this tow truck is catered for 4studs vehicles for classic town can you imagine yourself this truck towing a speed racer car i think it looks really out of proportion in addition the minifig which is included in this set has the regular truck print on its torso i am very sure they must be a fan club for trucks otherwise they should really need a change of clothes nevertheless in my honest opnion i really love this torso very much somehow it makes them look tough even though their face looks very friendly side view this vehicle has a combination of two primary colors which is white and red this color combination looks very good you cannot mistook it for an ambulance since they made use of this two colors too in most emergency vehicles this is my guess i supposed the designer will have tow truck concept as a form of emergency and considered red and white as its combinations this vehicle setup has the typical sunscreen on the top of the vehicle frame however this baby has more unique features installed in it these are the source of its brutal strength allterrain vehicle this tow truck equipped with the best wheels in fact these wheels offer suspension on the roads even when its travelling uphill the truck will move accordingly with its tyres when you act pressure on the top of the vehicle it will either be shifted leftwards or rightwards closeup of these unique tyres take a careful look these wheels have springs installed in it that is the magic of these vehicle and is defintely suited to run on any rough roads with least problems if any eb members know which other vehicles has this unique features please highlight it to me because if i remembered correctly i only remember seeing this pair of tyres in this great set he is ready for some serious towing the driver had finished hook up the pizza van on its back its pretty simple you just have to lift the back of the vehicle and placed it onto the hook presto the van is ready to go this vehicle provides so much fun you can really tow any 4studs vehicle in your town and here we go to the service station poor pizza guy summary review playability 1010 superb fun you will love to use this truck and tow any vehicles design 9510 excellent design especially with the use of the suspension tyres price 910 an inexpensive set based on the 1989 pricing this set is made up of less than 100 pieces overall 9510 every town must need a tow truck if a vehicle breaks down whom will be ready to tow i gave it a 5 based on my review score card what about yours hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelfwhen moderated	neutral
cool review ive always loved these hard looking tyres i never understood why they dont make them anymore they looked way more offroadish	neutral
this is one of my favorite town vehicles from the old time and for one specific reason the truck is on the guys shirt it didnt matter that the color was wrong or the hook was missing i thought it was awesome beyond imagination for some reason thanks for the review whitefang	positive
i rate this a 5 one of my last sets before my dark age suspension wheels are superb and are rare the minifig although smiling really looks tough because of the tanktop oh did i say im giving it a 5	positive
4 stars the suspension wheel holder totally rocks yeah though the slope brick 45 2x3 x 1 13 double disappoints me a little btw the 6350 pizza to go van looks soooo cute thanks for the review and keeeeep them coming	positive
thanks for all of your encouraging comments i am glad most of you love to view our classic reviews do stay out for more upcoming exciting classic town reviews i appericiate greatly by all of your words there are many outstanding reviews from brickster as well especially those classic vintage lego sets that i had never seen before except browsing it in brickset therefore i will encourage eb members to take some time off to view these truly wonderful classic reviews trust me it shall be an eye opening experience for each and everyone of you whom had never seen classic town in such an up close personal experience before lasse d on jul 19 2008 1222 am said this is one of my favorite town vehicles from the old time and for one specific reason the truck is on the guys shirt it didnt matter that the color was wrong or the hook was missing i thought it was awesome beyond imagination for some reason the torso is just lovely i felt the 6641 4 wheelin truck is almost identical with the torso except for the front color combination click onto the picture for an instant review bernddasbrot on jul 19 2008 0247 am said btw the 6350 pizza to go van looks soooo cute yes that cute pizza van appeared for a reason	neutral
oh never seen that set before fun and strange that wheel supension system has it ever been used in any other sets	neutral
indeed they have theyve appeared in 15 different sets in total they also have an identical width with the wide 2x2 wheels holder which is used on cars today they are still excellent today since retrofitting these suspension parts onto todays offroader trucks wont give them weird proportions or any problems and it looks perfect plus they are useful if youre lazy and dont feel like constructing the pinsuspension used in the early 90s for trucktrailers altough stability probably will suffer	neutral
45 ive had this set since i was young never understood why a tow truck needed to be an offroader maybe it was used to tow the other offroad vehicles the suspension made the truck too tall to tow some cars so i often took the hook out and use the truck as just an great offroad truck like 6672 which also had the suspension wheels other tow truck sets better filled their roles better but that doesnt diminish this set at all whitefang on jul 18 2008 0919 am said i think it looks really out of proportion no for 25odd years this vehicle was perfectly proportioned with all others in the towncity line its all these new 6 and 8 and 20 wide vehicles that are ignoring convention and making it look out of proportion granted speed racer sets are more of their own line but 6660 is smaller than most of the cars produced in the last few years	positive
superb review of a great setthis is one of my favourite classic sets becouse of all these functionsenginesuspensionand its great design with less than 100 pieces used only 52 congratulations for the reviewi think that its an outstanding set and surely worth 5 stars	positive

exxon gas station set  6375 year released 1980 piece count 254 minifigs 3 list price approx 20 one of the gems of my sets from 1980 has to be the exxon gas station it has very nice colors lots of great details and a high level of playability starting with the instructions the backside with a great picture of the complete set the set includes three minifigs including two gas station attendants and my favorite the urban cowboy one of the best things about this set is that it includes not one but two very detailed 4stud wide vehicles heres a picture of the red one which is a twoseater the car has two working doors a hood that opens and a little holed brick on the other side for pretending to fill er up heres another image at an angle isnt she a nice set of wheels heres the yellow car i always liked this one better perhaps it was the color with the black pieces in the back although it is a oneseater the set includes four fuel pumps that are numbered with decals and included a string as the hose heres a little accessory rack for oil and tools and another rack for tires the set had a nice exxon logo on three 1x6 bricks a large jack allows the cars to be lifted high into the air for tire and under engine repairs i love the office with its large 5x6 window inside is a chair and desk and the entire set happy motoring in legoland	positive
nice its like an alternative to the shell petrol company sets we had over here in the uk or did you have them to edited by skipper 24 19 july 2008  0421 pm	neutral
i think we only got shell stations in europe in the 80s never got this one but it looks like a typical lego gas station  once again i just dont know how you were able to keep stickers and prints in such a great condition i am sooooo jealous the tires of the cars are a problem though it was difficult and painful to put them off the wheel and back on later the black hat g i would have looooooved to have that when i was a boy	negative
i much prefer the shell version of that station which had the full awning over the roadway and the special road plate with the extra lane to pull into to fill er up	neutral
great review of a classic set man this is sure a wondeful kit even today the level of detail is astounding for the time and the whole kit is really cute you know i honestly dont get why some people have complained about the city gas stations figure count  the majority of lego gas stations had no more than three figures  including this one and the wonderful gas and wash express which i actually own i also dont get why people complain about the stickers so much  because even older kits often had a lot personally i think stickers are okay because printed pieces cant be used in as many places if the stickers are really specialized	positive
i love this set its nice and simple maybe its because i build this set by myself by ordering all parts and buildinginstruction and i made one extra tanktransporter 	positive
excellent review its nice to see review of old sets that i dont own i hope to see many more was this released under the esso name int the uk	positive

brickster you need your own sticky review section i love looking at all of these old sets as i have said before you take me back to a much simpler time thank you and on to the set i love this gas station lego really needs to look to its past on some of these sets for the time the level of detail is great i wish i still had this one in one piece as well	positive
brickster once again this is another excellent gas station awaiting to be in the limelight i dont understand why i always loved these classic gas station such as shell exxon and octan they just look so lovely no city or town could ever survive without these important key installations around to pump gaspetroleum for all vehicles that depend it for fuel consumption as always all gas station will always inculde a road plate and i am glad i am still seeing roads included in such sets such as the recent 7993 service station however town plans gas station did not include a baseplate though nevertheless let me continue with this review 3 lovely minifigs included in this set its not common to see exxon torsos these days i just love that lady staff very much especially with its classic hairdo 4studs car just simply rocks with such fabulous simple design furthermore it gave you 2 cars instead of one what more can you ask you dont see tlg giving more cars in recent sets these days what surprise me about this cars is the ability of opening the front engine column i remembered vividly that only trucks or massive vehicles does have this playing feature nevertheless its an excellent addition for a 1980 gas station set this is a perfect set even when its going to fit into my current town buildings i am sure it wont have a hard time to match with the rest of the facade i can use this gas station and stationed it near the country side this set is so hard to resist with such elegant design of its fuel pump there are a total of 4 pumping stations the vehicles wont be fighting against each other for slots then the reparing area is very nice it will be even better if it include a shelter on top of it the office is simple and nice i had never expect an office to exist in gas station most of the time there are groceries stores for the consumers to get off buy off some stores and load it in the car no major complains from me i am not trying to be selection bias i had demostrated key points which is good enough to justify my score and i gave it a 5 outstanding classic gas station set	positive
okay guys i have built the set so lets review set name 7649 mt201 ultra drill walker price 6999 pieces 759 bought from tor r us in michigan us the box first we have the front it shows the set its functuns and the limited edition sign the box is huge about the size of the dino attack chopper set or the mars mission base nowadays most set that are 5000 or more have a flap displaying the sets functions opening theflap on this box reveals a gigantic picture of the set and the back the bags numbered next the manuals they have piece call outs page numbers etc there are 2 manuals with this set sticker sheets they actually arent all that bad random manual image build first we open bag 1 this will build the alien craft and the minifigures now here we have some interesting parts a green spine from exoforce and a black rim for the set container stacker next we start the build on the alien craft it is pretty sturbdy but has no cockpit for the alien the alien stickers are really cool they are rainbowish and has a silver back next come the build on the wings and the finished craft it is pretty good and has a nice sleek design however i think i will use the large ship for the commander out this year to fight the driller instead next is bag 2 which builds the rover and astro ship first is the ship it starts off with doctor infernos colors it builds up very nice and the detail is absolutley amazing next the roof is built it has some speed racer slopes the hinge piee now has a hole through it sorry for the blurry pic more is added then comes the bottom piece the detail is very nice and the hinge piece has a use later on then you build the crates each one holds two crystals added to the ship also a pic of the finished ship here we start the rover it sports anice detail the orange studs get coveded by the grill to look more like an engine the detail in this thing is pretty good it has a gun and shovel here is how it fits into the ship it slides in and is secured thanks to the hinge okay so next we open the number 3 bag which builds the body here are some interesting pieces then we start the build it begins nice and study i just love these stickers with the bulldogs on them more of the build with the stickers added next we add in the front part the detail is again outstanding with the turntable added it can move down as well the next step is to build the water tank it utilizes the bionicle boostersbig white things and added to the walker then we build that drill it uses a lot of rims and such with the gears added the front part uses a lot of those new droideka 3prong things and bionicle eyes the drill can spin thanks to the gears and added to the vehical next is the cockpit it has a nice space for the astros bckpack added the final stage is the legs thank god they arent like striking venoms they are all the same however see those two rubber parts those keep it in place when on surfaces like glass next come the large part of the legs these are similar to the assault tigers legs the final result is very sturdy thanks too notice the amazing classic space sticker so we finally come down to this the final result is amazing it is sturdy and has great detail it is very realistic and when the ship is removed the drill goes down and the turret is aimed up hope you all enjoyed the review	positive

looks like a great set i may consider making this the first mars mission set i buy nice review also but quote lol thanks i just wanted to claim my place for the review personally i dont think you had a place to claim somebody else could have also gotten this set and had a proper review ready before yours but felt it was wrong to post because you had posted a placeholder  clubninja in this case i think placeholders should be banned and if you are not ready to post a full review you should not post anything simple really either that or what is the policy on here regarding more than one review of a set being posted  then you could have both posted reviews and it wont really matter i guess just my 2 cents worth thanks for the review though	positive
today im gonna review the bigger of the 2 castles from the fright knigh theme i got this one last week at a pretty fair prive at ebay new and still sealed i love opening boxes that had been lying arounf for years and being the first to build an old set since i know this castle theme is not liked so much by the general public ill try here and change their minds cause i really think this is a great set this time i have to say my pictures turned out pretty amazing even if i am still using just my cellphone cam but im really pleased now with the quality here we go set nr 6097 name night lords castle number of minifigs 7 number of pieces 598 release year 1997 lets start with a few box  instructions pictures the inside od the box with a few alternate models the back with another possibility how to assemble the 3 main parts instructions next the 6 minifigs starting with the witch on her black dragon all 5 figures of the fright section and the poor royal knight we go on with the set itself first a general overview its really high on the first floor theres a trap with which you can drop stones or other things down on unliked guests the pot comes originally from fabuland i think i love this thing in the same floor there is a second trap if you pull the bar the door opens we move on to the tower itself did i mention its really high on the ground level theres the place for the witch to do her spells the wall is a secret door which reveals a skeleton when turned over on the next level there is this little thingy first it only seems like a barrel but when you pull the two 1x4 tiles on the back a skull is being revealed scary huh  i dont really understand what this is for but i assume its a telescope to watch and observate the dragons i do find that a bit senseless since there havent been telescopes in medieval times or have there been the back of the tower with the prison and the room for the treasure chest the prison opened its secured with a chain which i like very much cause you really can lock it with that treasure chest from the highest peak we now go down to the very ground level at the back of the castle there is another secret walldoor flanked by two shields at the back half of the inside there is the throne hall for the bat lord with a nice warm fireplace in the back this is where the secret door is placed the second half is pretty empty except for these two baskets i dont know exactly what they are for but i ike the idea for using them as water places for the horses one thing that might be a bit stupid is that 2 of the 4 side entrances do not have doors so they are open and a guard would have to stand there the whole day you can see it in his face he isnt very happy with that  that was my last review of the sets i got the last weeks but im looking forward to make much more in the future overall this is a pretty good set i dont know any other one with so much details and playability the minus point is as already said that it is too open on the sides but that can be solved easily with a bit of modding also i must say this set isnt that much juniorized as many might have thought though the design is a bit unconventional but exactly thats what i like most about it all in all it gets a 910 for me hope you enjoyed the reading and the pictures cant wait to see your response edit oops i forgot to put one figure of the fright knight faction on the photo but its the one in the last picture edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0128 pm	positive
nice review good closeups and a good unconventional choice of a set as for the set itself it has its pros and cons in my eyes i like all the minifigs but especially the witch the fright knights are probably the closest you can get for an evil human castle faction as for the building itself on the other hand i like the fact that it can be modified but some of the design choices are just stupid the holes in the wall the one huge tower as opposed to several smaller ones the huge empty space in the center and the excessive usage of bright yellow i guess for a smaller kid the play value is great its easily accessible and it looks sturdy enough but to an afol its not much else than a source for bricks and figs in my opinion oh and they did have telescopes in the medieval times the witch most probably uses it for astrology and even if they didnt were talking about a castle with a dragon and a wicked witch in it so its not exactly a good example of accurate history	negative
iamded yes it seems the dragon is used as such in the picture of the alternate model but i guess bad and evil knights also wanna have some fun sometimes you are right with the green plate on the second floor it does look a bit disturbing but that can	negative

metalandi thanks for doing this fright knights review by opening up a misb set which you have bought recently i am very sure the feeling is very nice especially touching the bricks which is preserved for 11 years sealed in bags i am quite fond of the fright knights theme unfortunately this theme was released during my dark age i never really bought sets from fright knights instead i bought plenty of minifigs to build an army if i could turn back time or find another misb set with a reasonable price i am very sure i will get it my soldiers need a castle to stay in i will be looking forward to your next review keep up the good job	neutral
ah this brings back memories i have this set and i loved the playabilaty factor opposing to older castle sets i have in medieval times there actually were primitive telescopes you can read about it here thanks for this review great storie great pics	positive
wow what a cool castle and set in general i had no idea that this set existed long dark ages thanks to you metalandi for such a great review the figures look really nice and the set is full of lots of little trinkets  details traps etc i have already had a look on ebay for this set looks like a great set for parts too i give the review 455 evil witches cheers isc	positive
sandy on aug 5 2008 0621 pm said my first post in this topic looks foolish now that i bought this set from ebay i just really wanted the minifigs although i already had the batlord and the black dragon and the parts they will help me greatly in building the impenetrable fortress of the dragonwarriors for my princess quest comic by the end of this week this set will be in my clutches great cant wait for the next installment good review the pieces are so shiny and new all my space sets arent shiny or new this is an excellent castle i got it the day it came out it has a lot of playability	positive
metalandi on aug 6 2008 0140 pm said well that the bricks look new comes from that they are new i got this set new and unopened i know pretty good deal	positive
good review  the photo from above shows off the scale of the castle much better than the box photo i was one of those who always thought this set looked lame ever since first seeing it in the catalogue a couple of my siblings had smaller bat lordfright knight sets and enjoyed the accessories and style of the minifigs etc so last year having not only ended my dark ages but done so for some of the rest of my family i got this set off ebay for my sister for christmas i of course had to build it to make sure all parts were there before leaving ebay feedback and ending the transaction first impressions were of how much brick there was to the set as well as really useful large structural elements and to be honest while perhaps a bit childish theres no doubt the style of the minifigs is kinda cute and useful for customs it was really enjoyable building this set and the scale is impressive when built empty spaces notwithstanding but hey lego has always had buildings with no back etc  just use your imagination and enjoy the access to playspace offered the traps etc are neat and more like the kind of action features modern sets come with i for one am in favour of these for kids they are fun and i think for builders they give ideas cause they are often done with minimal parts or impact on the set design anyways needless to say my sister loved the set indeed shes currently rebuilding it for the second time if i see it as cheap again i will pick up one for myself i got the first one at €30 incl postage i believe	positive
ahh i remember how badly i wanted that set when it was new oh well definitely one of the most original castles if not the most i actually liked how the 1st floor was made into a throne room the tower looks pretty impressive too of course the castle has a flagrant flaw  the walls on the sides are open i also think it lacks in the minifig count though that is understandable for a castle with a dragon quote the fright knights are probably the closest you can get for an evil human castle faction totally agreed	positive
quite the topic bump but dang what a cool set and so tall this is the kind of sets i had as a kid but i dont remember this one im jealouss	positive
i got a couple of the small sets from this line when it came out recently i acquired several more from bricklink because i just really love the way they look this theme really had good intentions but the execution was flawed i hope one day lego returns to a darker tone but maybe next time it could be more castlevania inspired that would really turn some heads plus vampires and gothic aesthetics are really popular now it will probably have run its course by the time lego would be able to develop a theme around them though	negative
fire station set  6382 year released 19801981 piece count 368 minifigs 4 list price approx 20 legos third fire station was this little gem 6382 the set offered new design elements not previously offered in previous sets what really stands out for me is 1x3 car doors and torsos with printed designs a decal was used for the large sign on the building and the 1 on the hood of one of the vehicles i think this was also the first set to offer the sliding garage mechanism a feature that added a great amount of realism and playability the set also included two blue doors and the new fire hose with preconnected faucetspicket getting on to the pictures i saved the cover of the box for this set but lost the instructions over the years i was able to download some instructions from the web heres a shot of the box cover and the back of the box the set includes four figs three of which are fireman and a lady who can serve as a dispatcher as mentioned above the torsos are printed on my favorite of the two vehicles included i love the design of fire engine 1 i always loved the fire hoses included in this set no string to have to tie or freyed ends engine 2 is this much larger engine with ladder i like how it contains an oxygen tank and fire axe on the other side of the engine are two shutter doors that reveal the hose and ladder controls these are stickers the ladder is much wider than previous lego ladders and extends a good length i like the baseplate of this set which has the numbers one and two marking each garage the building is simple but has a nice design i love the sliding garage doors note notice the two windows of the 2nd floor the actual set should have blinds on these windows ive lost one of the stickered windows so placed the single blinded window on the 1st floor each of the two sides of the garages are the same heres a shot of the right side on the first floor is the dispatch area and a classic blue space computer the 2nd floor has a bed and a chair heres a shot of the entire backside and lastly a shot of the entire station this set is one of my favorite fire stations that offers a great amount of playability hope you enjoyed the review	positive
this is a great set and a great review  thanks for doing these i remember my brother getting this set i got the police station 6384 on the same day truly classic sets  its a shame that i dont have them anymore although i do have the two immediate descendants of the sets cheers rog	positive

i have a slightly different version of this set and i must say it is great boy to these reviews bring back memories thanks	positive
great review i love tis set too the best firestation ever made by lego mainly because the 80s sets are the favourite with me only i miss a helicopterplatvorm well i made a little modification	positive
i am a proud owner of this set this is one of the best fire stations ever what amazes me is what the designers made with only 368 pieces you get a very nice looking building in good size a good baseplate 2 cars 4 minifigs accessories and great alternative ideas in the back of the box like the fire boat or helicopter this is a great example of lego design	positive

i´m glad you are reviewing 4digit sets now brickster thebrickster on jul 20 2008 0714 pm said this set is one of my favorite fire stations that offers a great amount of playability this pretty sums it up the firestation was one of the few sets in my childhood i owned and was not classic space i especially liked the roller doors this was one of the first sets they came with in the late 80´s i sold it to my nephew darn i really regret it when i asked him a couple of years ago if he still owned it and i could buy it back he also had made cash out of it i gave it a 4 there is always room for improvement like the helipad mentioned so it can´t be a 5 in my opinion take off you rose coloured glasses	positive

fire copter 1 this is fc1 over im making my way to main street now the smoke is coming from the legoland hotel over thats a roger im going to shoot the 500 gallon now over fire in your tabletown no problem legos set 6685 fire copter is sure to put it out  classic style set  6685 year released 1982 piece count 99 minifigs 1 list price unknown heres a great firethemed addition to your classic legoland display starting with the instructions the set includes one classic fireman with a nicely printed fireman torso what a great little detailed helicopter i love the use of the red and yellow colors the front opens to allow your fireman to quickly climb in in the back are two round yellow 2x2 bricks for the water supply and a hose connected on each side unfortunately i lost one of the hoses and the entire set isnt she a beauty 6685 fire copter 1 is a great supplement to set 6382 fire station released one year earlier after buying this great little set i had fun puting out fires all over my tabletown oops i think i smell one now	positive
a great small set i remember this set most of all because of the inverted window screen loooooved the chopper but never got it another 5 please	positive
good but i like the heli of set 6571 better another 4 from me	positive
a nice little model with some neat features for its age plus the allyime classic fireman as a bonus however this design of chopper the police station around the same time was the same design i think dated very quickly while is was good to use the hinged car roof  which was relatively new at the time  together with the inverted screen it was superceded very quickly by designs that stood the test of time far better for example 6657 also i dont think i could everbuy a lego fire helicopter because it is not something we have in the ukeire police coast guard ambulance military etc etc but no fire helicopters not something i would therefore want in my lego town great review though many thanks again for doing these cheers rog	negative
well its ok but its not great voted 3 seems the classic town hater has voted a 1 again will the madness ever stop	neutral
hello all eurobricks members and town lovers today i will be doing up a review on snorkel squad one of the most important and basic vehicle in any fire department snorkel squad in simple english terms it refers to fire engine fighting fire always on standby ready to save the citizens from crisis trust me you will understand why this snorkel squad is superb impressive by the end of this review on a side note there is only part that is replaced by another color can you find the difference name snorkel squad theme lego system  town year 1987 pieces 151 minifigs 2 price usd1350 an image of a 6358 snorkel squad looking smart on their standby this snorkel squad is a fanastic fire engine that is ready to save people from the fires its primary color red is used in all fire emergency department and vehicles in case of any emergency this snorkel squad will be activated and arrived at the scene as soon as possible no time to waste personally this is the best fire engine that i had ever seen meet the fire fighters it comes with two brave fire fighters both of them wear the standard fire fighter outfit that is present in almost all fire station sets in classic town the torso is very nice and formal and looks real impressive onto them i love the buttons on them furthermore these white helmets are a symbol to the world of fire fighting these are the people whom save lives by risking their own lives in dangerous situations water hose compartment the water hose is a string that is stored in the front it can be rolled out and the fire fighters are able to use it without much difficulty they will just pull out the hose and spray onto the fire the next picture shows a much clearer look in its interior in addition the fire logo that is on the compartment is actually printed yes its not a sticker and that is great news for us interesting features these clamps on both sides is supposed to stablise the fire engine when the ladder is heading upwards it is a simple mechanism which illustrate clearly what it does this feature is recently seen in construction vehicle such as the mobile crane of course it is not a complicated feature it just made use of three quite common white parts swivel mechanism these swivel mechanism in my opnion are very fun to play with these connectors on the front and the back enable the long fire engine to make sharp turns on any junctions arriving at the scene fast enough this is not a fire engine that only travel straight roads try it onto your base plates and you will be surprised how well it can turn best playable mechanism in 6358 the driver will be activating the ladder at the back of the vehicle in order to adjust the height and making sure that the ladder do not fall short the tiles on the plates are acting like a stoppage the ladder are able to rotate 360 degree without much problem if you removed the driver out of the control panel it goes up as tall as 30cm look at that amazing height too bad i have not constructed my cafe corner yet otherwise i can give you a better feel of how amazing this baby can go i used the old road baseplate as a guide and roughly it can goes as tall as 30 to 35cm look at the black hinges below by shifting it to the last that was the maximum height it can move this is a very good way to adjust the height oh and i forget to mention that there are 2 storage compartments for the fighters to place their equipments behind quite easy to access no doors apart from the standard roof top on the drivers seat there is no doors present at both side i am quite sad to see that there are no doors maybe these fighters are supposed to jump off the seat instead of opening the doors well i guess this is the only major flaws that i had found in this set heading off got you meet the model 6358 fire engine summary review playability 1010 superb fun the ladder and swivel mechanism is really very fun to play with design 9510 excellent design it got an almost full 10 the lack of doors dropped my ratings slightly price 810 a very mid range price i dont think it cost very expensive but i am not sure how much it cost now overall 9210 best fire engine ever and one of the great looking one too get this model now i gave it a 5 based on my review score card what about yours hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated	positive
a great review i like this set it captures the classic town feeling well and the ladder is cool i cant help but feel thought that these reviews are being churned out to quickly you should leave a gap i am being flooded with all these great reviews	neutral
this definitly is a nice set i think this was also the first set to use that white basket nice one whitefang	positive
what an awesome little set i really like this engine but dont remember seeing it during the late 80s it must have been out during my dark ages i love the basketsection for the firemen equally nice is the fire hose which extends a good length the color combination of red with white and the trans blue windshield looks goos as well this is a great engine and one that would look perfect in a classic tabletown  and its 4studs wide very nice review whitefang i look forward to seeing more of your classic town reviews	positive
nice reveiw it looks like a great set i think i know what i will do tonight rebuild my lego fire department it has fire pickup truck fire truck from 2005 sorry cant remember set number and the most recent fire station if i can find all the pieces	neutral
nice review whitefang with lots of photos  exactly as a good review should be as for the set  i own it and its a very good one the fire squad vehicle is a nice addition to my other fire dept vehicles it offers very good playability and this ladder is so long you can have so much fun with it	neutral
thats a great reviewpoll whitefang i gave this set a 5 its simply  the only thing which i miss are the respirators for the firemen since they already own air tanks but otherwise this set is brilliant i like it much more than the new one from 2007 since its not that big and juniorized klausdieter	positive
guys thanks for all your great comments nikola bathory on jul 22 2008 0657 pm said it offers very good playability and this ladder is so long you can have so much fun with it yes the extended length of the ladder provides great playability klausdieter on jul 25 2008 0301 am said i like it much more than the new one from 2007 since its not that big and juniorized thanks kd i owned the 2007 fire engine as well as this set was not restored back then and i needed a fire engine very badly i managed to restored it somehow and i compared it with the 2007 the older design is still the best osakana on jul 25 2008 0403 am said great set i found only one major fail  this  the hands of robot arms gets easly broken yes this is an interesting finding i remembered when i was a child that robot arms always come out of its own when i fiddle with it i was so annoyed by it and i just kept it there whenever i deployed it for rescue missions grevious on jul 26 2008 0200 am said however i honestly wouldnt consider it the best firetruck ever i actually like the one from 2005 even better  becasue like most of the city vehicles it adds the needed bulk big engines like fire trucks need many of the older kits while awesome were honestly a little too skinny imo grevious i appericate your honest comments and given me your insight towards this set and state a comparison as well i agreed with you that fire engines need to be big and sturdy on the other hand it can be nice to have the fire engine to look slim as well to cut through the traffic easily i am not against with the newer sets it just that part of the reasons which reflected in the review had fufill the basic key factors of a typical fire engine in addition it was my alltime favourite under the firefighting theme	positive
quote i am not against with the newer sets it just that part of the reasons which reflected in the review had fufill the basic key factors of a typical fire engine in addition it was my alltime favourite under the firefighting theme yes i agree this set is wonderful even today and is one of the best fire kits ever release and actually realistic scale is not really a necessity in lego  its just my personal taste for example ive never liked the tiny planes in the old airports that much but i can see why a lot of people like them better than the new ones edited by grevious 28 july 2008  0317 pm	neutral
one of my all time favourite i still love it even after all these years though it did always seem a bit out of place as when i was a child i’d never seen a similar looking fire appliance in the uk	positive

it looks like a really good set and like it is a lot larger than the old one thanks for the review	positive
this sounds very similar to the first one im glad im saving this one till later in my purchasing cycle all the sw walkers have a skeletal fram with almost nothing inside its very disappointing but i guess filling them in would up the piece count considerably does this beast have any good handholds for picking it up i seem to recall a handle or something coming out of the top in the prerelease pics	negative
so basically you cited as faults what everybody had been complaining about since the first information of the set arrived skeletal interior and lack of clones although i didnt realize it didnt have numbered backs that really is just ridiculous lego finally comes up with a very intelligent solution to the frustration seen when building large sets but then they neglect to implement it wtf lame still this may be the only clone wars set i buy besides the exclusives the exterior which imo is the only part that matters looks so fantastic i dont care about clones i have enough of those already and at 90 its still a better buy than the rgs the torrent is cool but not as cool as the fighter tank or dgs imo awesome inconstruction pics	positive
just picked this set up and just took a break from building to go to football practice i have just finished building all of the legs and so far it looks like it is going to be a great set i would have like it if more clones were included but whatever i find it interesting how many clone accessories they give you i dont like it only because i cant decide what i want to use i find it interesting that at lease 2 people are missing pieces i have had multiple times where i thought i was missing pieces only to find that they were in the bag somewhere other than the fact that there is a lack of minifigures i love this set and cant wait to finish it later tonight edited by swman 04 august 2008  0833 pm	positive
i just got this set sunday and its so huge that i cant put it anywhere it is pretty sturdy and heavy thats where the handle comes in im pissed that you only get 2 clones rex has to fight on the ground while you need more clones to man the gunscockpit the legs were the most annoying and time consuming part of the build and yea i agree that if tlg had made numbered bags it would have taken only 2 hours rather than 4 edited by ih master 13uilder17 14 october 2008  1138 pm	negative
i bought this a few weeks ago and absolutely loved making it its amazing how the paneling comes together to make such a tight fit but can easily open up the legs could have been a bit more poseable and the guns dont launch easily unless you push hard and fast id like the firing mechanism to launch more smoothly but it looks absolutely amazing about price it was ¥13000 where i am but im used to lego being expensive in japan so it was good value	positive

hey everyone my wife took me to legoland for my birthday just last week we had a fantastic time and it gave me the chance to pick up some of the new castle sets and battlepacks i was really impressed by the sets i bought and decided to do my first review let battle commence set name tower raid set number 7037 price gbp £1999 pieces 364 the models heres a shot of the complete set the set is made up of two models the crown knights tower and the orcs siege tower lets start with the crown knights tower a knight readies himself for battle my favourite model from the set the wicked orcs siege tower please note that for the purposes of display i mounted the orcs banner onto a small cone set on the top platform of the siege tower this doesnt come with the set but saves any orcs having to hold onto it all he time there are other areas it can be placed without using extra parts features both models look great and have excellent features the set as a whole has great playability and seems to have been concieved with a storyline the crown knights have a captured orc within the walls of their tower so the orc army has been sent out to recover him or are they merely after the gold the knights keep horded away the orcs siege tower has a powerful ram  springloaded by the simple arrangement of an elastic band  so pulling it back sends it flying out the front knocking down the wall on the side of the knights tower and releasing the captive orc the floor panels inside the prison are laid over a lip on the inside of the collapsible wall so fall in when theyre not supported theres a string at the rear for extending the boarding ramp and letting a fearsome orc warrior charge across flickfire action the battle heats up as the orcs close in the minifigures the crown knights i really like the crown knights theyre metallic helmets look great and they come with nice accessories the archer has a double printed head with a frightened look on the other side too im not surprised id be frightened when staring over the ramparts at these the orcs these guys really do look the part worthy advesaries to the crown knights the details are superb the printed elements weapons and helmets all set the orcs aside on the battlefield the set comes with a great new molded armour neckpiece too the mighty orc leader looks wicked in his full battlegear overview theres so much to this set its hard not to be impressed the orcs siege engine is a thing of beauty or terror and would look great on any battlefield the crown knights tower although basic looks good and has great playability im a big fan of the new castle knights and fantasy minifigures and the inclusion of five of them is just enough for this set and as a booster to any army at £1999 in the uk this set is well worth the money for content and quality id highly recommmend this set as a musthave purchase for anyone a final shot of the siege tower with a host of orcs ready for battle i hope you enjoyed my review ill be posting my next one for 7040 dwarves mine defender soon	positive

great review this is an awesome set besides knocking down the wall at the side can the battering ram do any other damage to the tower ex reducing it to rubble bricks and why cant the orc just jump out of the hole in the back do they need to do that much unnecessary damage to the tower	neutral

whitefang on jul 30 2008 1256 am said pedro for your first review you have amaze me with your photo session and the strucutre of your review i am very impressed by your high quality pictures you have done an excellent job i completely agree this is an amazing review  bits of humor great photography and detailed descriptionsphotos based upon this review ive placed an order for this set along with some convincing from amazons 20 sale  the only drawbacks in this set that i can see concerns the tower with it being 1 small compared to the seige tower and 2 missing a few walls however this is also the joy of lego as one can simply purchase a few bricks and build their own walls andor expand the towers size or even attach it to a castle of course this increases the price of the set but considering how cheap bricks are on bricklink tower raid is still a very good value i hope you continue doing reviews pedro	positive

hmm a tougie i really like the world city one yet the dino one is a better deal ill vote for the dino because i regretably dont even have the world city one	positive
the coast guard quad because i live in the netherlands and we dont have the dino attack theme we have dino 2010 which have a diffrent quad so i would like to chose the dino attack one but as i dont one him goast guard though but i also dont have the coast guard one but i like him but i also dont have the coast quard one as well greets theforce edited by theforce 01 august 2008  1118 pm	positive
 that was a weird race anyway i love the look of both sets but ill have to go for the dino attack quad for a couple of reasons it is postapoc which i love features tan and dark red colours which are far more useful than yellow you get more bang for your buck with the dino set you get a little dino sure you can hate it but better than not having one right and the fig has much more useful pieces and a better face thanks for the face off thebrickster batbrick away	positive
its definately the street sprinter for me there are many reasons for that most of which have been mentioned by others already i hate yellow its the most useless color but i love tan and dark red its bigger and more detailed than the coast guard one plus i think there is a hinge in the back of it so there is apparently some more playability to it as well i love the postapoc style fig its detailed and simply looks cool also while the digger fig has quite an individual look to it the coast guard driver has the generic hero head and coast guard uniform its an overal better deal especially if you count the ludp which gives the set a whole lot more playability no matter how u the ldp may be tan  postapoc figs on	positive
that was an intresting race and i was split between the two until i saw whitefangs reply and the fact you can use the sprinter as a militery thingwhich you could do for both but sprinter just pulls it off better and i like the radar on the back of it so ill have to go with the street sprinter thanks for the nice topic brickster	positive
ive got to go with the town one since you have to stand on the dino one steve	positive
i vote for the dino quadbike definately i wish i had that but ill have to make do with the much less violent european version dino 2010 not attack heres a comaprison european version usa etc version theres a subtle difference but i prefer the us one as for the coast guard quad i think its ok but not as good as the new one	positive
i like the coast guard one but dinos eat coast guard people so dinos ftw and i think the dino bike would fit in with my collection pretty well	positive
i like the dino thingy because of the pieces and the dino is a lot of fun on its own i know thats akward	positive
dino attack for me you just cant say no to a huge bazooka though the tan and dark red works for me too	positive
the rancor on aug 2 2008 0939 am said i wish i had that but ill have to make do with the much less violent european version dino 2010 not attack heres a comaprison european version usa etc version theres a subtle difference but i prefer the us one i did not know that europe had a different quad or at least one without the bazooka interesting that the gun was removed from the european sets or added to the us sets i sort of like the chain i also notice a big difference in the boxart destroyed city to prehistoric volcano i wonder if the story was different as well thanks for sharing a good picture  well it does look like the dino quad has the upper hand almost double the votes	positive
dino attack quad for me no this isnt because i own it and not the other one but because i think just about everything is better in it  the design is better the colors are cooler and it has a better figure i dont like the figure in the coast guard quad at all  but since it was from world city im not suprised i also kinda like the dino actually its flexible and fits in with the previous dinos a lot better than the cruddy bigger ones with bright red yellow and green highlights	positive
ooooooh this is a very hard choicei like this new coast guard theme but i loved dino attackthe dino attack set has a weird looking gunbut imo the coast guard set lookscleaner if you get what i meanthe little dinolizard thing is practically worthless thats why i have a bin full of those little guysi want to keep liking dino attack i just cantso i know your like just get to the point already so i guess i have to go with coast guard thebrickster on aug 3 2008 0941 am said i did not know that europe had a different quad or at least one without the bazooka interesting that the gun was removed from the european sets or added to the us sets i sort of like the chain i also notice a big difference in the boxart destroyed city to prehistoric volcano i wonder if the story was different as well thanks for sharing a good picture  well it does look like the dino quad has the upper hand almost double the votes wow i would have so much wanted the european one more than the us one i mean that bazooka or as they called it a sonic screamer looks very silly	positive

christian thanks for this outstanding review i have been waiting for this moment for someone to do up an excellent review like this republic fighter tank is my 2nd favourite set in my clone wars list the 2 clone troopers could be easily add up to your rgs since it offer only more trooper however i felt that this set is quite overpriced in fact all clone war sets are very expensive the fighter tank has a very great color combination of red and white to represent the republic the wheels below is the most impressive feature which enable the hovering feel the hatch is a neat feature as well however i noticed there is a rubber band within the control panel may i know what is it for i really enjoy viewing this review you had given the insight which will eventually determined whether to get it any sooner or later pr0visorak on aug 2 2008 0535 pm said this set costs a s100 in singaporei went to hng kong too see lego and the shops there are more expensive by a few dollarshoweveri went to australia before and everything there is the same price but when there is a sale it becomes very cheap hello pr0visorak you are from singapore as well welcome to eurobricks i hope you will do an introduction to the rest of the members in this forum in singapore it cost sgd10000 in fact that was the promotional price therefore there is no further discount for it	positive

thanks for the review i actually like the older tie better since it had a stand for the tie not really a fan of the lu figs either no matter  a tie is a tie and this is a must have fighter for any lego sw fan out there never can get enough ties except the tie advanced or vaders tiethey dont rock kimt	positive
this set was on my wanted list for a long time and the sales at sh came just in time i also loved the set and like you only put the stickers on the toll both it looks great on a town layout with almost no modifications the racers are great the trucks and the limo are the best in my oppinion the sticker sheet is huge but ive seen bigger stickers over multiple pieces are the worst the slammers are ok but not great i played with my 4 years old son and we tryed to do what shows in the box the cars passing the toll jumping the ramps and crashing the trucks but it is very difficult to get it right but the crashes are very fun	positive
thanks for the review ill definately get this set sooner or later imo the tiny turbos are awesome i actually bought nearly every set so far built the models added the stickers and packed them away in ziplock bags in the attic sadly i dont have display room for them yet a fine set carwise dump the slammers and buildings into the spare bag and keep the cars kimt tiny turbos on	positive
tiny turbos are good for parts but im not so keen on them as they have no minifig drivers so i wasnt sure about this set but your review has made me like them more i probably wont buy the set but i appreciate it more thanks for the review	positive

as my summer holiday was kinda wet for 2 weeks i decided to shop some sets i crossed the german border and bought me this one mainly for the parts to get time going i built the models and made this small review for you to enjoy or hate high resolution pics can be found here when public set 4994 title fierce creatures price 999 euro  1299 usd pieces 193 minifigs 0 the box the box looks awesome it has some great animations of the 3 models in the instruction the rear of the box shows some nice upcloseandpersonal drawings of each model i think it works better having the models drawn instead of a mere photo of them somehow it allows the great colourscheme to really show the instructions the instruction is easy to follow and shows which pieces are used in each building step that makes it all a lot easier especially with so many small pieces as in this set the bricks are divided into 3 polybags and the instruction is a fine small book which can be easily stored along the rest of your evergrowing amount of booklets and pamphlets printed by tlg the models model 1 is a spider and it’s nasty the 2x2 modified brick with the hole would allow one to hang it from a string this beast is sure to give you several nightmares were it hanging from a string in your bedroom – so i wouldn’t do that plus the fact that my wife threw away the box and ordered me to take the spider apart when she saw it – she’s an arachnophobian and does not take spiders lightly it looks real in a brickishnonrealway model 2 is a snake there’s not much to say other than the head is awesomely designed and the rest is bad the body is poorly designed and does not live up to the coolness of the head build the head ignore the rest model 3 is a flying scorpion or something not as realistic as the spider but still a great model with a cool head the tail is a bit poorly designed but it’ll do and it does offer some good ideas on how to use bricks all in all verdicts this is an ok creator set it holds a lot of fine pieces and the models are an ok inspiration given its size it’s an ok set but it’s nothing more than that i’ll give it an average score i enjoyed building the models and fumbling with the bricks in the shade during a “siesta” on my vacation and that’s what it is an enjoyable build and a little inspiration on a hot day with a erdinger dunkel weissbier in my other hand kimt edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0629 pm indexed	positive

4500 rebel snow speeder review parts 214 figs 3 price £2000 edit new box pics added sorry theyre a bit blurry because of the light i took them in this is the original trilogy edition version of this set but there arent any differences to the normal one 1 manual  box the front of the ote box the minifgs on the box top the back of the box with some alternate models and overview of some of the functions the manual cover you can see it is the ote version of the set random shot 1 of 2 posters in the instructions the second poster 2 general set and minifigs the built set contents the three figs with the included weapons how i like to customize the pilots helmets luke from 4500 and luke from 10178 motorized atat the three helmets included with the set 3 turret heres the turret with the rebel gunner standing next to it the controls for the turret  the turret can rotate and tilt two fire at those pesky atat walkers i put a spider web sort of radar dish thing on like on the original 7130 to make it look more like the one from tesb 4 the speeder a front view of the speeder the pilot controls with a atat print the seats for the pilot and rear gunner the rear gunners tow cable a detailed printed plate next to the engines printed plates under the airbrake things more printed parts there is no dss with this set got tie up those walkers we might need some more tow cable  5 overall build 710 pretty symmetrical build but its fun minifigs 810 3 figs in a £20 set is pretty good i think design 910 very strong and close to minifig scale the turret could have some work though parts 810 lots of variety and includes some interesting ones such as the cockpit and rear air vent price 710 3 figs and 214 parts not to bad i guess playability 610 could be better if it came with a snow trooper overall 810 the set comes with 3 figs that only come with more expensive sets also it has a variety of different parts as well as the build being enjoyable edited by skipper 24 04 august 2008  0310 pm indexed	neutral
thanks for the review this is another good sw set a true classic i especially like the colourscheme of this set the rebel gun is crappy though but overall the set rocks kimt	positive
i once bought a entire lego collection including this set however i never have build it seeing this fine review has given me new motivation to do so nice work again skipper	positive
skipper thanks for doing up all these sw reviews it certainly had given me some valuable insights on these sets especially on the snowspeeder it kind of making me regret to pass off this set however i had bought the hoth base instead but had never built it i am just wondering if the snowspeeder had any difference keep up the good work and always strive your best to make each upcoming review a better one	positive
there isnt much difference apart form it has stickers on and is grey also the guns and tow cable gun are different as well as the engines but if you look at pictures of the hoth base speeder not to much is noticeable	neutral
i have mixed feelings about this set its one of the sets that sent my into a dark age the birth of my son contributed heavily when i first saw this set i was convinced that the earlier snowspeeder 7130 was superior in every way i liked the look of the 7130 version better i liked the coloration of it better the turret was better it used a webbed 6 x 6 dish after seeing this review i realize i was wrong on some accounts the cockpit is much more movie accurate the 7130 version had two separate compartments this version also came with a tow cable something that was lacking from the previous set while i still am unimpressed with the overall look of this set it is much less blocky which is always a good thing overall i still prefer 7130 to the 4500 version but the 4500 isnt nearly as bad as i first assumed and i regret never buying one of these when i had my chance	neutral
great review i bought this set when it came out but sold it a couple years later for some extra cash i have no regrets selling this one as i was never really impressed with it different story for the 4483 atat  oh how i wish i still had that one the snowspeeder was alright just didnt have any sort of wow factor to it the best part of the set is probably the rebel trooper looking at the last photo in your review looks like youre about to have a major battle in your hallway apart from the snowspeeder  motorized atat i see the arc170 fighter grievouss starfighter and is that a podracer i see  and what is the set with the treads its not star wars but looks like a pretty cool set maybe a mission mars vehicle	positive
podracer not sure where you got that from i didnt have them out the set with treads is a dino 2010 thing which fits in well after a bit of modding also there are some of the old exoforce sets out there like the fire vulture because i always saw them fitting well with star wars	neutral

7255 general greivous wheel bike chase review parts 111 figs 2 price £1000 the first set to include gg 1 general set and minifigs not manual because i dont have it the contents of the box after being built both minifigs the set includes 5 lightsabers my own design gg ggs cape on the outside ggs cape on the inside 2 the wheel bike front view standing on legs side view gg cant hold the controls because of his arms roller mode the legs are a bit to chunky so to roll it has to be tilted forward 3 boga the lizard grey tip to the tail the front back and saddle split in to three sections 4 overall build 410 there isnt really much to build minifigs 910 it comes with gg with the special cape and obiwan in rots gear which is hard to find i think design 510 not really to scale but otherwise okay apart from boga which just looks like any old dinosaur also the controls on the wheel bike arent really right parts 610 comes with some dark green bricks and lots of rods  the guns on the wheel bike the boga feet are also nice price 810 £10 for 2 figs isnt bad it could have a few more parts though playability 1010 you can easily recreate the movie scenes with this set overall 710 it would be better if the bike and boga were more to scale and more accurate as well as the set having more parts	neutral

7153 jango fetts slave 1 review parts 358 figs 2 price £2000 i got it on offer i think the rrp was £40 the only set to include jango fett and young boba also the decals on jango are from fine clonier im trying to say they dont came with the set 1 manual worn manual random page another random page looking at this page you can that this set has numbered bags back cover look how old yodas computer looks  2 general set and minifigs the sets contents jango with his hair on jango with helmet on with front view of face twist jangos head to initiate super bounty hunter mode jangos doubled sided head boba nothing to special although i think the torso and head are exclusive to the set 3 the ship not really scaled up right as you can see the guns can rotate the central sections interior not sure what this is is it a hyperdrive or a bomb or something there are these side panels on both sides behind the panels a secret compartment trans orange minifig heads in the compartment i think theyre supposed to be saturnic charges side storage compartment the back of the ship how those trans orange minifig heads fallout there is a magnet on the inside of the ship but for what the secret prison which also has a magnet on the top so it can stay on but easily come out the doors on it can lift up to put prisoners inside 1 of 2 identical wing things they can fold for flight mode the controls bottom jet thing let me out of here the prison is great for capturing small children 4 overall build 710 impossible to build without a hard stable surface minifigs 1010 2 exclusive figs design 710 nowhere near to scale but has some nice features parts 810 good parts like that big cockpit canopy price 910 for the price i got it was pretty good especially with the figs it comes with playability 710 lots of features but it would be better if it came with a jsf overall 910 lots of features and comes with exclusive minifigs edited by kimt 04 august 2008  1144 am indexed	positive
thanks again skipper for producing yet another review to go into the index i like this slave1 but sadly i must admit that i like the really old version better boba fetts slave1 that is even though is grossly undersized i think its better than this one belonging to his father jango kimt	neutral
i have all three of the slave i ships and i agree with kimtalthough it is a very small compact ship the first slave i boba fett is still the sturdiest the newest slave i boba fett is not bad and is of much better construction than this slave i from jango fett even though i like the size and scale of the jango slave i and the newest boba fett slave iwhen you pick that very first one up it had the feeling ofyou can throw me against the wall drop me off the roof of your house or let 4 two year olds play with meim not gonna break at least thatss my opinion good review	positive

thanks for the review it looks like an interesting set even if not as good as bobas skipper 24 on aug 3 2008 0811 pm said i never got the original boba fetts slave 1 i wish they would make one to scale with the minifigures i would be so cool you mean it would be so cool i agree that it would be if they made a large minifig scale version like with the ucs millenium falcon i would probably try to buy that edited by shoc 03 august 2008  0831 pm	neutral

nice review i will say i like the latest slave i the best as it is longer than jangos i havent seen the first one so i cant really comment	neutral
that was indeed a set that never appealed to me its build was just plain wrong and awful i only bought it because i found it on clearance at around 15€ and they had 4 of them if i had known better then id have bought all 4 seeing how much that jango fett minifig is worth now  but i ended up heavily modifying it in its propoions and now it looks ok next to the new slave one which is the best one of its 3 incarnations i think	negative
i got the original jsf for christmas which i might buy and review wonderful set the obi in this one is really awesome and its really just a great ship sticker free probably my favourite id fly it if any ship from star wars maybe i should get it and the slave i from episode ii after all i like jango despite having a crap story	positive
okay i have fixed that pic thanks oky wan i have modified this but then yesterday i built it back to its original state to review it	neutral
yep those decals are suffering i am going to apply some new ones now with proper paper	neutral
good review i always wanted to know how it was different to the boba fett slave i i would probably only get this though for jango fett the newer one looks sturdier and proportioned better imo	neutral

this set looks liek a good buy for 4 wish it was still around but like you said it needs accessories	positive
i remember having this set actually i even still have it at least the pars are somewhere  when i was a child and i used it for making races as it is there for all these many reviews let me think again at that i also planned to make some reviews for the town section i got your message thebrickster dont worry i got a lot to do at the moment but i should find some time this upcoming week	neutral

skipper 24 on aug 4 2008 0404 pm said did your version without the lul mace have trans blue grill things like the ones on the back of the speeder  or was my set a one off i bought mine online thinking it was the new version but i ended up with that very lame lul fig i just hate that fig its completely useless we cant use any part of it for anything although i only discovered yesterday that the lightsaber blade was a standard one and not glued as i always believed so all isnt completely lost in the end i still was rather disappointed by the set its too full of holes  hum i think theres kind of a paradox in that sentence but the barc speeder and green clone are indeed fantastic oh and yes mine came with sand blue grill parts instead of the transyellow ones didnt realise it at first and i spent half an hour cursing thinking they forgot to put them in the box but in the end i dont know if the replacements are any better  since theyre supposed to represent some kind of thruster light or something all in all i think its my worst set not necessarily for the set itself which is ok but psychologically theres too many things that went wrong with it	neutral
good set but its flimsy as sin but that may have been my rush job building it mine got shoved off a bed oh and i lost my light up mace  propably somewhere within the blue bin o doom™ aka the brick bucket™ or blocknull™  edited by maiq the liar 04 august 2008  1015 pm	neutral
the kid on aug 4 2008 0820 am said i got the original version of this set with the luls mace windu figure when tlc released the nonluls version i managed to swap  they sent me the new version and a clone trooper iirc and i mailed them back the old version this was a great set the suspension worked great and it rolled magnificently nice review with good photos but again your price is a little off £6999 is the rrp unless the price you paid was £80 tk that was a great idea i never even thought to send it back and get the new one with the other clone and the non lul windu	positive

thanks for the review kimt i gave this above average i believe i had this one but it was so long ago im still a bit freaked out by the yellow ones when i emerged from my dark ages i kept thinking gee i miss the people packs but now that i have over 500 minifigures i dont feel that way anymore even so i wish they would rerelease some of the classic old ones	neutral
i voted above average as well but back in 1983 i would have probably gone much lower sadly i wasnt as interested in minifigs at the time i appreciated the ones i had but i really just wanted ships or bases and would have gladly passed this by for something with one or two figures and a small moon rover i skipped all of the classic minifig sets space castle and town it was only upon coming out of my dark ages that i went minifig crazy for me this is above average because of the accessories without them its an average set with a small brick built droid or a rover it would be outstanding that said id buy at least 10 copies now though id rather have a 4 figure set with one of each colour including blue i never had blue back then i think castle lured me away thanks for an interesting review it gives me a chance to further explore why i changed from shipset to minifig fan and bore all of eb with it	neutral
an ancient set revived from kimts collection just take a look at the box art this is one classic space minifig pack which deserve high rating and i gave it above average i never had any of these classic space figs before if tlg could ever released this again i am pretty sure i will grab multiple packs without a glimpse you need to build your space agentsastronauts with a little bit of accessories added to explore the unknown space i love this pack very much thanks for sharing	positive

first thanks simonjedi for a great review im interested in what you think of the hydrolics i could spend hours just deploying and undeploying the wings and landing gear im a little worried the very first batch of the hydrolic piece for umm i think it was the offroad 4x4 technic set was very fragile and broke after a few uses these seem to be holding up but im anxious to see if they hold up after 100200 uses quote namewalter kovacs dateaug 4 2008 1147 am post337841 those black pieces used on the landing gear look very bioniclelike if they havent been used before id suspect they will be not that im a bionicle expert or anything quote right you are they are bionicle bohrok head pieces so pretty old in bionicle terms and fairly useless in my opinion but they do make interesting looking landing gear as i deploy and redeploy the wings and landing gear hopefully well get a pilot in the battle pack to help mitigate the fact we only get one here tohst	positive
thanks for the review ive added it to the index and added a poll in which members can vote their opinion on this set i think this is a very good set i like the colours and the very playable feature that allows the wings to lock in attack formation now all i need is to buy this baby edit i gave it an above average rating since its well designed looks sturdy and fits the sw theme sets perfectly	positive
the v19 was my first tcw set i buyed it when i was visiting my father i just wanted to build it there and i do so but how do you will get sthbig like this with in the train so i had to destroy him when i was still home again i had to build it 3 times because the mechanic dont works i only can say that the v19 is one of the best tcw sets thanks to you for the review simonjedi  i just wanted to make one in german but now i neednt to make it	positive
the ability for it to fold in and out of attack position has wowed me this is my top priority now thanks for making up my mind	positive
hydraulic wings i am very impressed and am now considering getting this set purely because of this funciton i am just curious as to know why are there sand green parts on the bottom of the v19 is it visible when the model is completed i am also pleased to see tlc giving us a printed cockpit computer this time around	positive

having just bought myself a copy of the wonderful metroliner 4558 i felt like doing a review before we start id like to thank greenhair for selling me one of his metroliners for a mere 80 euros granted the motor trainstation and tracks werent included but i did get an extra railcar instead   please note that i have included the fourth wagon in the final pic but that the official set includes just three wagons the metroliner was released in 1992 and was extremely popular amongst lego fans the set a picture of the box showing the set completely pic taken from peeron and one of the minifigs and the accessories as you may notice tlc was extremely generous supplying us with a grand total of 11 minifgs amongst which no less than 4 female minifigs ah the population crisis is finally over we also have three suitcases three cups and a small freight parcel and freight handling thingy normally this would include two bicycles a red and a black one a general side view of the three carriages thanks to greenhair and the brickster and heres one of the extra carriage thanks to greenhair and the brickster moving onto the front and back carriage which are externally identical please note that greenhair changed my back carriages headlights these would be yellow in the normal set all the doors in the entire set are printed pieces sorry for the bad picture quality in this one the interior of the two however is laid out a bit differently the space in the front carriage is occupied by a cockpit or whatever it is called in trains and some space to store your cable connecting the front lights with the engine i can imagine it must get quite cramped and dangerous for the minifig driver with all the cabling further back we have a quite random weird looking engine one part reminded me rather of a jet engine on a commercial airplane the engine is accessible by means of the two side cargo doors at the end of our first carriage we hit what looks like the trains restaurant two tables and no chairs the two middle carriages are identical both have a small sink nicely hidden from the intervening and impolite looks of fellow passengers the carriage further contains two tables and four seats two cargo spaces are nicely tucked away from view below the tables our final carriage has a back cockpit as well but differs from the front carriage in the central cargo area  where our train employee is hard at work earning his lego nickels  and the rear sleeping area the bed is a double one the upper one able to be flipped up for somewhat difficult access to the lower one the train station i could not take photos off since it was not included in the purchase judging from the building plans however i feel it was thrown in at the end just to add something to the set its construction is very simple consisting of a few grey plates on top of a few pillars access is provided by a plate which is connected to the platform with a few hinges there are however two lamp posts a timetable and a few chairs so if you dont like the platform you can still use these parts in a variety of other constructios to end off i took a pic of the complete set with extra wagon and a friendly surprised train driver opening the door and greeting the camera man conclusion being a 90s set the train basically builds itself the entire build cost me two hours and a half i lost quite some time simply admiring the set and was extremely straightforward with no suprises at all but i need to admit it has its charm the exterior is simply amazing the sleekness of the design the colours it matches perfectly i believe however that a width of 8 studs would be more to scale but 6 wide still looks amazing the interior is somewhat simplistic but is easily moddeable with a few extra pieces i basically bought the train as a parts pack the standard set three wagons includes no less than 8 train doors with windows 14 train windows 4 smaller longer ones and 4 freight doors the front and back of course count as unique pieces as well one feature i am displeased with are the printed doors i like printed pieces and while the bluewhitered stripe looks beautiful on the side the printed doors kind of limit mocing capabilities to carriages with a stripe on the side i considered simply removing the stripe but i found out i could just get normal grey ones from bricklink for a fair price i am very pleased with the train but since you already know my opinion feel free to tell us yours of this fabulous set edited by thebrickster 09 july 2009  0151 pm poll question was not multiple choice switched to radio group	positive

oh ruben you lucky so and so this set is one of the most beautful i have ever seen splendid looking build and 11 figures all the same faces like but still you get that old woman pigtail head piece which is just great i thought you meant the monorail set when you told me about this but guess i was wrong dont laugh ive been away from lego for quite some time and for 80 euros it was a real bargain from a great friend really nice review hope this sets brings you years of joy	positive
cool review i actually have two of these i got one for christmas when it was rereleased in 2003 and another one in a charity shop a few months later for €5 i love the minifigs even if they all have smileys and having two sets of them can really fill up a town	positive
its great to see someone reviewing a train this set is definately a five lego hasnt made a complete train set like this in a long time the metroliner is really a legend among classic trains the great level of playability and detailing makes it a terrific model specifically i was just noticing the details of the passenger car it has a sink  how cool is that and 11 minifigs  when was the last time lego included 11 figs in a single set a truly outstanding train set thanks for sharing images as ive always wanted to see it upclose it would be awesome if you could share some single side shots of the cars	positive
im not normally that big into trains but this set has a real coolness factor that sets it apart from most of the others the color scheme is the same one that amtrak and many local subway systems use i picked it up along with the club car expansion when they were rereleased in 2001 i have made various modifications to mine rearranging the car layouts and adding a second train motor into the rearmost car along with another set of lights so that both ends light up as you said it would be great to have an 8stud version of this so you could fit in two rows of seats side by side that might make a nice mod project at some point	positive
nice review i collect all metroliner i can i have 3 metroliner and when i can i buy a other  my aim  have the more big metroliner collect in france  in first time  its my favorite set	positive
ahh the good old train theme how i wish tlg would make such great trains today now that the quality of city sets has improved so much that really brings back memories even if i didnt have this one but a cargo train that came out about the same time period maybe plus a few years i dont have any trains myself at the moment mostly because im afraid i havent got enough space to put in on display with all the rails and stuff	positive
really nice train i always wished tlg would have made the passenger ir train longer and maybe used some of the nice features of this train i still love that faucet piece	positive
hairy ruben on aug 5 2008 1200 am said the interior of the two however is laid out a bit differently the space in the front carriage is occupied by a cockpit or whatever it is called in trains and some space to store your cable connecting the front lights with the engine i can imagine it must get quite cramped and dangerous for the minifig driver with all the cabling further back we have a quite random weird looking engine one part reminded me rather of a jet engine on a commercial airplane the engine is accessible by means of the two side cargo doors at the end of our first carriage we hit what looks like the trains restaurant two tables and no chairs there shouldnt be so much of the light cable in the front section or cockpit most of the cable should be in the central part of the train then it is not so crowded for the engine driver i have never had a problem with the cable and the space available for it the only problem i had was that the cable had a loose contact after some time when the train went into a curve cant remember if it was a left or right curve the light went off i have now got the same problem with the cable that i put into my santa fe super chief always when the engine turns into a right curve the light goes off my dad could repair the cable for the metroliner even though he is quite skilled at repairing electronic things he found it very difficult to repair since there were no screws to open the electronic plate it annoyed him a lot so ive been asking myself if i should really bother him with a second cable with the same problem the train set itself is outstanding and thats what i voted for i only have the legend 10001 but its 99 identical to 4558 i also have club car 4547 i dont have the legend club car 10002 the reason for this is i always had the choice between one big lego set or several small ones for christmas when i was a child i always went for several small ones metroliner 4558 would have been a big train set but i really wanted a passenger car so i bought 4547 with my savings without having the metroliner i was quite happy when the metroliner was rereleased i bought it with my own money then i could finally use the club car with the train it was created for edited by legotrainfan 15 august 2008  0755 pm	neutral
panda9001100 on aug 16 2008 0737 am said only strange they named it metroliner in holland when we speak of a metro i need to think at short distance trains only used in big cities like rotterdam it was only named metroliner in the us because of the color scheme is similar to the reallife metroliner i believe in eu it was called the euroexpress and probably just passenger train wherever that would be suitable the productnumber 4558 is universal though hairy ruben you dont have a review of the doubledeckerclub car on the way do you i myself never got it and i am seriously considering buying one from bricklink plus it is moreorless an requirement for this train one of very few doubledecker cars to actually stay within the general outer dimensions of the train	neutral
my favourite favourite favourite old set its too bad i was born 2 years after its release i would have had a major interest in classic town i might actually get this one on bricklink not that itll go for a good price ill only buy if it does you see an outstanding a highly useful and wellmade set that really just stands out from its counterparts edit nevermind edited by dovchenko 16 august 2008  1025 am	positive

i got my indy exclusive in the mail today packaging front back instructions minifigs this set comes with 1 minifig the standard indy with hat and whipno satchel the build i am really happy with the amount of frown headlight bricks that come with this set 12 in all the mudguards are cleverly built with 1 x 2 panels and 1 x 1 panel corners in dark green in the first 2 pages of the instructions there are a lot of great pieces this set would sell like mad if it were released for sale parts monkeys alone would go insane buying these up for the dark green and frown pieces the body of the car consists of black plates brackets and modified bricks with curved tops that allow the dark green mudguards to just peak out cool technique the grill looks cool using only six pieces i wish all small sets were this unique and cool heres the completed jeep it looks a little small for an actual jeep but for a brickmaster set its awesome imo some more detail shots of the set with indy in the drivers seat i hope they take brickmaster exclusives overseas because itd be awesome if everybody could get these my buddy copmike would probably love to be the first to review this set so ive dedicated my review comic to him my rating playability 810 you need to add some other sets and characters to really play with this set design 910 great techniques and inclusion of rare parts but loses a point for being an unrealistic size for a jeep price 1010 part of the brickmaster package it is a reasonable prize for an exclusive set and everything else that comes with the subscription overall 910 great but not perfect and definitely needs to be offered overseas lego would make a ton of money releasing this for sale imo as it really is a terrific small set	positive
super review thanks simply put id have to admit this is one of the best indy sets and in such a small package its a very detailed lil jeep and thats why i like it i have this too but i dont want to open it since its exclusive wait i thought we were calling it rown and not frown	positive

nice review hinckley i just got mine as well by paying quite a high price for it since its exclusive to us however i had not opened it yet and i left it in my friends car i gave it for an above average for that cool little jeep for an exclusive brickmaster set this is certainly one of the best vehicles i had ever seen i like its construction built if this is ever released in the main stream i am sure it will be a hit to get a small sized indiana jones set	positive
nice review i would like to get this set unfortunately i dont get brickmaster mag and the prices on bl ebay will most likely be ridiculous i wonder why indy doesnt come with his murse man purse in this set thats the best part of the fig the jeep itself is very nice especially with the dark green by the way what is frown brownish something i guess oh yeah and funny comic	positive

thanks for this review if youd only know what memories you brought back i think i remember this set better than any other i had when i was a child some time after i got it i decided to disassemble it and combine it with the jeep from 6552 rocky river retreat it came out pretty good though as it became the main attraction point of my town beeing the car of my favourite minifig back then and and and looong story  i kept it assembled that way from this day on until earlier this year when i finally disassembled it because i needed the parts edited by metalandi 06 august 2008  0357 am	positive
this is by far my favourite outback series set i loved the fact that you can bend the bridge in different directions so that the suspension of the car really worked to keep the car levelled like you placed it in your last picture i had lots of fun with this when it came out eleven years ago in 1997 the bridge scene could also be used in the adventurers serie of 1998 classic highest rating buy it if you dont already have it	positive
great review brickster why exactly did the outback adventure etc themes never quite catch onjust a thought what a great set i wish i had it but in 1997 i was just back from my whirl wind trips around the world and had drifted away from lego i dont know why but i will say this i love the actual suspension that came with this set and the trains sets i have been trying to buy up as much of it as i can and now i see i need to add one more set to the i need to get that	positive
stauder on aug 7 2008 0617 am said the great thing about the copter was it had 2 suitcases which as far as i can tell aint a common part not rare but still nice to have and it had the guy with the green jacket the winch wasnt bad either the only flaw was it was a standard lego copter meaning similar ones where avalible in quite a few sets do you plan to review it oh i wish i had it i dont recall seeing 6487 in the stores back when i purchased the other outback sets id love to see a review	positive
nice review this set looked very nice for its time	positive
oh i loved this set when i was young i think i got it for my birthday and it was one of my favourite sets at the time funnily enough i was thinking about it the other day and how i really should build it again thanks for the nostalgic review	positive
ok this is the big one the controversial one the one everyone either hates or defends what do i think read on the figs bandana man masked dude dude with shades good figures i miss scarface comes with his torso though which is my favorite the one with the ammo strap across the chest one figure short of the figuretoprice value but we can deal with that the dino the dino its the one that comes with the chopper in green any questions the tank and so it begins i think it looks a lot better in person than on the box the left side good time to mention that the treads run pretty easily and this is a very playable set right side keep an eye on that flap in the center  and we have a folding ladder the back probably the weakest point of the set apart from the dino the turret turned and tilted the mechanism works extremely well and the gun seems to work better than others for some reason or maybe it just seems that way the front of the cockpit im at a loss trying to figure out how those tiny windshields defend them against 40foot mutant tyrannosaurus rexes with radioactive breath laser eyes and what have you anyway another one of those neat steering wheels some viking horns and some stickered control panels oh yeah this set has a good amount of stickers probably around 20ish the back of the cockpit i love the little gun it turns 360 degrees and tilts up oh yeah and those green barrels theyve been using are awesome i can think of tons of uses for them the verdict 7610 playability 9410 pieces 7510 figures 8810 dino 310 value 410 the main downfall of this set is the price i would easily pay 30 for this no questions asked but 40 was a hard sell for me  i gave in merely to see what i would think of it and also to help you guys find out the same this is a great display set and a great play set the pieces are good  lots of nice blay beams used in the construction but the price people thats the killer pick this up only if you have everything else or you find it on clearance and thus ends my dino attack review series hope you enjoyed them until next time bloody jay	neutral

this is my first review so i thought the smaller the set the better 6626 snowmobile year 2000 subtheme arctic pieces 20 1 extra note polybag 6577 is the boxed version price €1  sh on ebay misp mint in sealed polybag building time less than 2 minutes if it came out in the last months if would be called an impulse set it actually came out a few years ago being those my dark years i missed the arctic line now that im back into business i wanted some but not all of the sets were good or easily available i had the chance to buy this one and i0m happy with it as you can see below it consists of a figure on a scooter the only accessories are those chainsaws that lie on the sides unless you take the skis from the scooter and have the minifig wear them the extra piece is a transyellow 1x1 round plate according to brickset and peeron the difference between box and polybag is the sticker sheet you choose whether the nose is better with or without the sticker id say with the judgement its cheap it has a cool minifig with a cool head accessory and a nice torso i dont think i like that orange colour that much and i cant understand why those blue pieces have to be blue i guess its beacuse the whole line uses blue with orange but i have to say this is definetely a good set id give it a 4 out of 5 in its category if you want to own at least a set per every theme this could be your arctic one packaging content minifig i hear you ask whats that yellow thing on the left leg dust or something alike the snowmobile edited by the cobra 07 august 2008  0233 pm	neutral
nice review cobra thanks for sharing i think arctic was one of those neat themes that never really took off i like these little polybag sets as they make great startersintroduction sets for themes or serve as a nice supplement or addon to an existing collection ive always liked the thick green hood piece used in the arctic theme and have thought about using it in a sw hoth scene in any case nice review ive got an arctic set that i built recently and will share a review soon	positive
here we are my first clone wars set and my first star wars review here we have the wonderful droid gunship one of the cheaper of the clone wars sets this set is exclusive to walmart and its one of the better exclusives out there im looking at you twilight  first off we have a shot of the entire set with the box a random page shot along with pics of the parts list the build is split up into three sections the back the cockpit and the missles the back has a lot of nice dark blue plates and is the only part of the set which uses stickers the bottoms shows various technic systems which ill get to later the cockpit has many details mostly guns and the rotating guns are a nice touch the cockpit can fit a battle droid but not a minifig im not sure why a droid would want leather though the last part is loading this baby with the missles there are four blacksmall and two dark bley large missles which are loaded in groups of three as sls the middle mechanism is for the missiles and the back part with the bionicle teeth are used ad landing gear the knob on top turns to release the missiles on the clones  leftover bits and the used ssnot so d this time around the gunship versus a time traveling agent charge  overall build 810 a basic build but at some points repetitive minifigs 1010 just your basic droids you cant go wrong design 710 a basic design with some interesting techniques pieces 910 a mix of old and new pieces along with the return of this lovely piece which hasnt been seen for almost 10 years price 810 30 for a gunship ill take it final verdict 810 a great price for a small set like this and it has a great bit of swooshability	positive

set 7680  the twilight theme star wars year released 2008 piece count 882 price aud14999 or 15999 if you buy at tru 9999 euro us9999 pity the twilight when rumours of the set name first circulated speculation was swift twilight  that suggests something sleek elegant and mysterious anticipation mounted fanfrenzy grew finally a pic leaked and the verdict was clunkadunk it appeared that in the jedi offseason anakin was running something that looked like an intergalactic garbage scow like roger wilco in the old sierra space quest pc games blocky and bley seemed to sum it up the set went from being one of the most anticipated to one of the least liked of 2008 pretty much instantly its a mark of that dislike that in the eb clone wars review feeding frenzy nobody has so far even bothered to post a few pics of this set even 2 weeks after its official release im here to redress that imbalance now and find out if 7680 is as horrendous as everyone originally thought part 1 box  parts front of the box its quite big same size as the 10144 sandcrawler annoyingly its the old style with the perforated corners that you have to tear to flip open the lid detail of the back showing set functions interior of the box  a lot of wasted space the set comes with 2 instruction manuals each 76 pages and no dss sheet polybags 13 of em like the other cw sets these are unnumbered parts ahoy you can tell at a glance that this set is comparable to the atte although there a large proportion of the 800 parts here are technic pins and bley plates part 2 minifigs and build the set comes with 4 figs or 35 depending on how you look at rotta  anakin ahsoka r2d2 and rotta very disappointing that theres nothing new here for such a highpriced exclusive although i guess it is maybe movie accurate anyway to paraphrase the wise patsy stone you can never have enough hats shoes or new anakin ahsoka hairpieces so its not too bad pics of the build in progress a quarter of the way through we can already see that this is one of those convoluted technic frames with some plates affixed type builds halfway and the smaller wing is added at the three quarter mark the giant single wing is added and voila done the final quarter is a race to attach all the exterior surfaces and details such as the engine and escape pod the build itself is a mixed blessing it is very technic oriented im not a technically minded person and dont really have much of a conceptual grasp of how everything functions until i see the final result so i find these type of builds a little uninteresting pins axles and beams give me bricks any day i really liked the 7676 gunship and the 7679 fighter tank although they do contain some technic framework they are largely brickbuilt ships especially the fighter tank which is solid largely brick built and full of neat functions the 7680 build is one of the most technicy builds ive ever undergone in a system set akin to the experience of building the 10178 motorised atat but whereas with that set you could understand the need for a technic framework the thing walks a lot of this seemed excessive yes the twilight does some have nice functions and it is so large and heavy it does need a strong skeleton but to me it just seemed too much and aesthetics have been sacrificed for in some cases limited functionality i will discuss in more detail what i mean as i look at different parts of the set on the upside this is the only nonsymmetric set in the cw range so at least every page and new step brings something different part 3 a closer view closeup of the main body of the ship fronton it is welldesigned how the figs appear in line of sight unlike the 6211 where jabba and leia were photoshopped in to the box art dont ask what rotta is doing out of the line of vision there some things are better left unsaid side view showing escape pod smaller cylinder and drive top view rear view showing back door the rear deck is huge indeed the whole ship is huge oddly so i dont know if this is moviescale or not but ive seen people complain the fighter tank is too big  and that set is nothing compared to this baby its wider than the gunship and in wingspan and length is almost bigger heres a few pics next to an mtt for comparison pretty big hey turning to the dark side must be good for business even if all you can buy is a rusty old beast like this at least you could comfortably squash pretty much every vehicle in the opposing fleet just by landing on it at least now you can see why it costs so much the official pics make it look smaller somehow by truncating the rear and wing the ship is in fact so big you cant really pose it with wings open  only hold it that way i was too lazy to build a giant transclear support strut so propped it up on a shoebox instead the wing opens very neatly  you push a technic lever and a pin holding the bottom wing pops out quite smoothly the little top turret can move up and down as well to get the full crossshaped effect part 4 features and functions the front cockpit folds down very neatly although i find the build here a little weak whee it goes all the way down to the floor the mechanism is cool but it takes up an awful lot of space basically the whole front is cockpit and all lego could manage for controls is 2 printed 1x2 tiles as well not pictured here but theyre attached to the part that folds up and down theres also no way for anyone to get in or out of the cockpit and an invisible windscreen technology has come a long way side view looking from wing r2d2 is here as well as some tools you can also glimpse here one of the main problems with the set despite being a huge boxy ship theres no interior none the twilight doesnt even have an internal floor all the room inside is taken up by the landing gear which folds up  again a clever function but it really gets in the way of the set as a whole kudos to the designer for coming up with stable working landing gear but too clever by half if it means that this giant ship ends up basically being one tiny cockpit and a rear door at the back that doesnt lead to any interior underside showing landing gear when open and closed  when the wing is folded down the gear is locked in place which is pretty neat spaceconsuming but neat the rear section the door when opened reveals an orange cupboard and a towline as ahsoka uses in the box art the door clicks into place when open and can be released by pressing the technic bit at the top again clever but pointless as you cant get inside ahsoka can indulge in a little recreational bungeejumping if she so wishes the rear deck is so large that it is wasted just being used so ahsoka can bungeejump i came up with a much better use for it outdoor garden despite having one roboticised hand anakin was still quite the green thumb and his lightsaber was very useful as a hedge trimmer so much so that he set up a side business between rottarescue missions heres a promotional postcard a few other bits and pieces the gun turret on the enormous megawing can only hold one flick fire missile at a time you do get two though  rear engine detail the escape pod sits neatly on the side and is basically built the same way as the gunship bacta tank the pod sits on these tehcnic pins and is held in place by the light bley parts part 5 in conclusion the twilight is a huge ship with a huge amount of great functions  folding wing folding cockpit rear door escape pod retractable landing gear but this functionality comes at a price  a very complex technic build and zip interior compared with the gunship for example which is stuffed with nooks and crannies the twilight suffers in this respect i also think it is just too large  it doesnt really fit with the other craft and vehicles released with the clone wars line i may be wrong and it is movieaccurate but when you have all the cw sets laid out it does stick out like a poor thumb part selection is ok with the only interesting things being a few dark orange plates the orange cupboard and the big transneon green radar dish dont get me wrong i dont think this is a bad set at all its just the other cw sets are so sweet i would say its an above average set in a field crammed with excellent ones if youre a completist buy it but if for example youd rather invest in another atte to upgrade your republic army then i couldnt really disagree with you either and to finish on a light note id like to remind you that you do get another ahsoka hairpiece which can be used for all sorts of things ugha warrior upgrade dr inferno hair transplant and finally attack of the deadly blueringed octopus native to australias beaches and oceans thanks for reading	neutral
really awesome review sveltecorps  you did a really complete and indepth review of this beast and with your nice pics is really enjoyable reading your review so congrats  i like this ship even if it looks so bulky but i need to buy first other sets so maybe this beast will be landing in my collection the next year or this one if i am lucky  i can just ask for something can you post a pic of all your clone wars sets together with this one all the sets in one pic not many pics with this an each set  please  edited by darkrebellion 12 august 2008  0220 am	positive

thanks for the review now i thinnk i will buy this set btw i really like what you did to the back i might do the same to mine	positive
i read the visual guide recently and learned a bit more about the twilight i wont get into spoilers but it seems that the ship becomes a sort of endearing family van for the characters which is neat big bulky uncool but it gets you from one place to another if it factors into more than just the 90 minute film i may pick this up it seems that theres room for a lot of personality in this ship once you see the film it is a corellian freighter smuggling spice for the hutts thats cool right	neutral
this is probably the best review ive ever seen why it put the set in context with peoples changing thoughts about it it commented on the box why do such expensive sets have such ordinary boxes the photography was outstanding every issue that a builder could have with it was discussed in a calm and rational manner i have the same issues with technic structured sets and sveltecorps summed up my feelings on this beautifully this was an even handed review so thoughtful finally you gotta love a bit of humour in a review that gardenis brilliant i was probably never going to get this set anyway but it sets a new worlds best standard for reviews i strongly encourage anyone thats going to review a set to have a good look at this to see how well it can be done thanks for the magnificent review	positive
oh no anakin has gone over to the green side of the force well i guess someone had to review the clunkadunk eventually and you did a good job at it svelte corps i liked the punchline with the ahsokahairpiece swapping the ugha warrior upgrade is an interesting way of creating male togrutas and ahsoka looks even hotter with infernos hair matteo kenobi on aug 11 2008 0930 pm said if i am really impressed with it in the film i suppose that would change things but i will have to see  i wouldnt count on it spoiler after its first flight the twilight will crash and burn wookieepedia says so and you can see it in one of the trailers so i guess the twilight will stay mostly unbought poor clunkadunk	positive
thank you sveltecorps for the review i like the inside nice and cosey i also like your little garden for me this put the twilight different in a better perspective than my first perspective of the twilight i voted outstanding greets theforce	neutral
i will not be picking this one up the main thing is that it simply looks akward it is big and bulky and seems to have random pieces on it with not reall streamline feel to it i also agree that for an exclusive that it 100 it needs more than just 35 mini figures anikan and ashoka and rotta already come in the atte which is cheaper and has more figures r2d2 is a figure that i am sure everybody has at least 4 or 5 of for that kind of money i expect something with at least one unique figure and more than 4 i also want just a cleaner and better designed set this is probably the letdown of the collection so far every collection needs one	negative
seems like tlc has done a pretty accurate representation of the ship the real fault for the ships messy design has to go to lucasfilm not tlc my guess is lucasfilm is trying to recapture that what a piece of junk magic of the millennium falcon i guess well have to wait to see the movie to see if they succeeded or not the idea of a space mobile home reminds me of the winnebago from spaceballs great review informative entertaining and opinionated so many people shy away from stating an actual opinion in their review for fear of offending anyone whats the point of making a review if you dont state what you think about it	neutral
sveltecorps on aug 12 2008 0219 am said hmm dior i can smell it now the ship doesnt look too swooshable but then again more than the heavy rgs i really like that review svelte corps so much detail unfortunately i would only get this if it was a very low price like in a sale	neutral

having plenty of time on my hands this summer i did some reviews yes im aware this has already been done but ill just do it once more no harm there set 5615 set title the knight price 299 euro  349 usd pieces 21 yes a whole 21 bricks release 2007 the box a neat little box that has a great size for dropping into your shopping cart for once tlg didnt shove the bricks into an oversized cardboard box  the knight this is a great minifig though he looks a little unsatisfiedmight be because his head isnt put on all the way a great army builder fig the only thing that i find a little annoying is that the collar isnt completely rounded it looks too much like an animation and lefthand work the weapon rack yes thumbs up for this plate mail sword shield and jousting helmet plus the spear and open helmet on the fig so many great additions to put into use bring it on pesky skeleton army the all in all verdict a great set a little too expensive compared to the crossbow attack in which one gets 2 knights and a skeleton plus bricks for 549 euro  599 usd but still a great army builder set and the 7090 set does not have the same knight fig kimt	positive
i bought four of these sets i guess this was the best selling impulse set so far great idea to have weapons and helmet choice as for the price id say 7090 is surprisingly cheap	positive
argh what i was typing kept getting deleted by my stupid keyboard on topic this looks like a great little set i could use a few of these but i havent seen any at a local store too bad for me i suspose  great review and i like the green plate on the bottom never can have too many greens for my small but expanding swamp im building hope i can pick some of these up eventualy	positive
time for another of the great castle sets and yes this one is a great army builder set as well d set 7090 set title crossbow attack price 529 euro  599 usd pieces 54 release 2007 the box and as the other two sets reviewd so far 7009 and 5615 this one has a fitting box that is too easily snatched from the shelf and put into your shopping cart  not sure its a great thingtoo expensive in the end d the crossbow attack cart the cart is a neat little build that actually works and for once were not given that awful technic launcher but a buildit launcher it actually works just fine for its purpose the addition of two crossbows makes it worth buying never can get enought weapons for the evergrowing crownie army the figs oddly ive not taken any pics of the figs and therefore ill illustrate using the sh pic the figs are great i love the silver helmets and in this set you get 2 crownies and a skeleton plus a white skeleton horse thats a lot of figs for a set this size a true army builder thumbs up for that the all in all verdict another small yet super set in the castle theme i bought several of these to make a fine little army its cheap and often found on sale i can hardly resist buying it when i see it kimt	positive
hard to find in italian shops i had a friend buying one for meas soon as the set was available i always wanted another one so while in switzerland see kimts 7009 review for the full story i bought two for 5 €uros you get two knights a skeleton and a skeleton horse some hand weapons and a shooting device please remember dont aim at the eyes just great	positive
this little bugger brought me back from my dark ages as a movie fan i just couldnt resist the thought of making an animation with living lego skeletons im referring to ray harryhausens work on the classic jason and the argonauts here buying the indy sets stopped me from getting a lot more castle sets though in time i added the final joust the wizard and the impulse knight to my collection as well as buying more unique figs king princess from expensive castle sets off bricklink so yeah great little set two crownies a skeleton and a skeletal horse you just cannot resist that even if you hadnt been buying lego for 5 years as far as im concerned this set is one for the ages i love it	positive
this is an awesome set in my opinion i scraped my crossbows for mocing recently but the set is still an amazing army builder for the price for the sw battlepacks which have 4 minifigs and a cheap vehicle you get 4 knights  this is 2 sets to equal the price of a bp  2 skellys and 2 skelly horses plus 4 crossbows 4 good wheels and some other good dark blue and brown pieces for my ever expanding castle town great buy	positive
and another set enters the scene set 7009 set title the final joust price 829 euro  799 usd pieces 62 release 2007 the box and yet again tlg has put the bricks in a box that somehow corresponds with the amount of bricks in it the castle theme has got well designed boxes  the whole set build 2 knights jousting fence and weapon rack the weapons rack another great addition of weapons flail halberd and skeleton scimitar super weapons for those close encounter melee battles fought when tipped off the horse  grinp the jousting fence not much to say its a fence simple yet it serves its purpose very well the crown knight gotta love that guy he looks like nothing can hurt him he even got a selfsufficient smile on his face im sure hes convinced that no skeleton can defeat him also the horse its barding and the headcover looks awesome a great old school sword and the ever cool normannic shield what could possibly go wrong for this knight the helmet i really love imo its a lot better than the old knight helmets see review of 5615 the knight for a pic of one of those the skeleton knight the black skeleton horse rocks i love that design and in black its even badder than than the white version the shield reeks of dread and the knight is one bad skeleton on the rampage i do find that the helmet is a little off id rather have a black knights helmet instead the kk helmet doesnt really do it for me the all in all verdict this is another great army builder set it holds a lot of great weapons some cool minifigs and great pieces the only thing that puzzles me is why would a crown knight joust a skeleton doesnt really make sense kimt	positive
ive been waiting to hold this set in my hands for about a year and a half thanks to a silly tlc decision 7009 was not available in italian stores i finally decided to buy it on the net 2x  plus some other sets and those morons at the custom charged me quite a lot after i bought it while waiting for it to arrive i found out it was available in a store in switzerland not far away from home thats for the storytelling as for the set i thought it was great and still think so a good army builder as quite a few sets in the 20072008 castle line and a time traveller 6021 being my first lego castle set ever rating 55 edited by the cobra 13 august 2008  0904 pm	positive
lovely set nice collection of weapons cool horseaccesoires for the white knight cool black skeletal horse on the dark knights side loving the printed armours of both knights and as opposed to kimt apparently i really dig the black helmet i feel theres a lord of the ringsflavour to it with those curves well designed	positive
i should really get one more of these for the figures shields and weapons this set is the only one with the scythe in pearlgrey by the way the only thing that puzzles me is why would a crown knight joust a skeleton good question for a joust to make sense this set should contain two human knights instead  which would be fine with me so long as they had differing armour and colours edited by tenorikuma 13 august 2008  0351 am	neutral
im not a huge fan of this set but it is a great way to nab a fully mounted knight complete with a very attractive barding given that in prior years it wasnt possible to get a barded horse in such a small set this set is actually a decent way to build a mounted cavalry for your kingdom looking at bricklink it would probably cost as much to buy the knight horse and weapons separately and that doesnt take into account the skeleton or the extra bricks despite my indifference to this set i actually have purchased four of them in the past year simply because there isnt a cheaper way to acquire a mounted knight a quick question about the poll are we voting on the quality of the set or the quality of the review later edited by blueandwhite 13 august 2008  0550 am	neutral

this set is a great little bundle the kitted out knight skellie knight weapons and the few bricks for the fence and weapon rack the castle 07 barding here is very nice indeed the colour scheme of the new castle guys is great imo the light blue and blue work nicely together and against the grey background i dont really like the pearl grey helmet  it would be nicer in metallic silver like the visor i think interesting comment re the skellie helmet  i guess black normal knights helmet with visor would be quite nice for him i got this set as part of the complete castle collection from sh however i have extras of all the smaller sets and skeleton tower except i dont have another one of this set its on my list of sets to buy unfortunately it wasnt on sh for ireland when i was making later orders  quite an odd omission also last year castle 07 was exclusive to argos uk catalogue retailer who only had three sets not the joust i should see if the local toy store has it now though as they did stock some 07 castle in addition to 08 at the start of the year i think small sets like this should be well stocked in shops for a year or two  it surely doesnt do their sales much good to be so sporadically available sorry turned into a bit of a ramble anyways the point is that this set is good enough id pick up another the cobra that sucks about customs i try to keep my orders to within the €23 dutyfree limit for here in ireland if your imports are waylaid you pay 20 import duty 21 sales tax and a postage fee for the diversion to customs nasty edited by brickzone 13 august 2008  1115 am	positive
you know what i think this set has charm lots of it im not a big fan of castle having very few sets all of them spanning different nationsarmies but i couldnt resist this set and while not obvious at first it really is backwards compatible with every castle set with a horse in it nonetheless i think this set is great its simple cheap and has charm thats good enough for me plus it has that fantastic grinning knight and the black skeleton horse those just made it better	positive

good review kimt pictures are clear and show each of the pieces in great detail i agree with your comments as well im a bit curious does the knights helm have a hole for plume ive been debating whether to purchase this set or not im not a big fan of horses so ill likely barely use them but i do like the unique minifigs weapon rackweapons and the fact that the divider has a few useful pieces that can be added to other sets however i just dont feel the set is worth 8 when compared to crossbow attack and the knights catapult unless the buyer is really wanting some mounted minifigs luckily amazon just lowered their price of this set from 8 to 6 along with another 20 if using bill me later just in case anyone was also in the same situation i was in at that price its damn well worth it	positive
dj2005 on aug 29 2008 1126 am said im a bit curious does the knights helm have a hole for plume i can answer on behalf for kimt if memories served me right yes there is a hole for placing the knights plume do correct me wrong if i had answered wrongly its been awhile since i last touched my castle sets thanks kimt for this fine review this is one of the castle sets which i had bought high volume mainly for its horses barding and the weapons a great army builder and accessories for your castle armies this is an instant 5	positive
first things first the knights helm does have a spot for a plume now i really like this set and it was the first one i dug into when i got my collection in the mail it has a great selection of equipment for good or evil figures and the barding for the horse is outstanding my only wish was for one of the long chrome swords for the knights i think the new knights with the tall shield and chrome sword look excellent on foot and on horseback it would definitely be neat to revisit this set with another human knight instead of the skeleton make that change and add a lady to joust for and itd be bang on	positive
this looks like a really great set i wasnt around in 88 to get it but i like it it actually has things inside the interior thanks for the review hinckley on aug 13 2008 0611 pm said there were quite a few sets in the 1980s that werent sold in the us hooray sort of in england we dont get in normal shops batman and spongebob sets and not at all  avatar sets and brickmaster but america gets all of these maybe its revenge for americas lego neglect in the 80s hinckley on aug 13 2008 0611 pm said i remember reading once that it was because they contained wine glasses and tlg felt they wouldnt be able to market a toy that encourage the drinking of alcohol this set was one of them they didnt want to encourage the drinking of alcohol in america but were fine encouraging it in other places maybe thats why my country has such a big problem with binge drinking or maybe not	positive
thats a great review of a great set hinckley i voted for outstanding  this set is simply amazing i regrettably dont own this set since its very hard to find on ebay andor the stickers are missing but nevertheless i hope that i one day will be able to get this awesome set  or even better  see tlg releasing a new city villa in a style similar to that brilliant set  klausdieter edited by klausdieter 13 august 2008  0630 pm	positive
nice set what a great find this is one thing i think the tlg has forgotten about the creator houses are nice but they are not really geared toward a town them no mini figs cars etc these sets were and that adds so much to a town layout it cant be overlooked i really like this i may have to start my ebay searching thanks hinckley	positive

great review id give this set an 8 at the least its just a tad too simple for my liking but other than that it looks great while im a 4 wide car man i actually think this car looks rather horrendous the main body seems way too low in comparison with the windows the rare parts however do make up for it hinckley on aug 13 2008 1123 pm said yes yes in the states horrifying and deplorable violence is fine but drinking and swearing sends kids directly to hell somehow i feel like watching south park now  that was such a good episode	neutral

this is my favourite house which i owned during my childhood although its in the crypt but i hope to build it back one day looking at your review makes me so envy of you to own a complete set the baseplate is very unique especially for its stoned pattern classic lego telephone is just so lovely especially when its printed the entire house layout is simple and very nicely constructed in fact the simplicity just showed how much lego could do with such parts there are many nice furnitures included in this set such as the little ovenstove dining table bed and car porch the little black car is a classic example of a true 4studs car i love this house very much and my verdict is a full 5 no doubt about it thanks hinckley for this lovely review	positive

thanks for the wonderful review this is really a beautiful set  i love the old lego houses from the 80s and 90s  they were always very quaint and well designed actually i like the old car designs too but only for their nostalgic value in reality they are very unrealistic and look more like go carts that said not all four wide cars are silly looking  the 4wide cars in these city sets are awesome and fit in with the modern city style great	positive
i just bought this its truly a wonderful set and i love the houses from that era as well very charming great review	positive
i wish i could find this set some day including the right baseplate some of my house mocs are styled after the classic 6349 and sometimes ive rebuilt it after instruction scans exchanging the baseplate i dont own one of these with 2 at 16x32 each and this city house out of an older thread of mine its offensive that ive used styling elements of 6349s just enlarged in terms of interior details not much but still enough for classic town i voted outstanding mfg widdi edited by widdi 09 october 2008  0122 am	positive

aerial recovery set  6462 theme town resq year released 1998 piece count 201 minifigs 3 list price 25 usd my personal favorite of the resq theme released in 1998 was this helicopter 6462 aerial recovery the set offered a pretty modern helicopter raft threewheeler rescue gurney and net and three figs including a diver the set is actionpacked and offers a high degree of play value starting with the box front side and back front back i always liked the rough oceansea water pictured in the boxart the same image from the front of the box appears on the cover of the instructions but the back of the instructions picture a plain view of the copter one sticker sheet with a few resq stickers is included mainly for the tail section of the helicopter interestingly the set includes three figures one being a diver what i always found strange is the inclusion of an xtreme team diver who has the logo on his torso although its a very nice fig back shot i think this was my first set with a lego threewheeler i always liked it a lot the set includes a yellow raft also found in the divers sets and some scuba gear note the raft has a black piece in its center for lifting up by the helicopter for sea and emergent rescue a gurney can also be lifted by the helicopter the set also includes a net with hook to lift the threewheeler and other items an extra string pulls the net closed heres a shot of the helicopter the front section has a large trans blue piece enclosing the cockpit inside is a printed radar slope a smaller trans blue piece appears a bit higher for access to the middle section of the helicopter andor a small storage area in the middle section is an place for the gurney and a box for storing some of the adventure gear heres a picture showing the gurney on the side is a pulley mechanism that swings to the right when not in use on the opposite side is the winch to raise and lower the grappling hook heres a picture of an open storage box i like the tail section with propeller decal is not shown heres another shot of the copter from a different angle and the final image the entire set final thoughts personally i think this is pretty nice set i like the thought of using the helicopter to rescue people at sea using the working winch extras like the trikethreewheeler and the rescue net make the set even more fun hope you enjoy this resq review	positive
thanks for this review thebrickster i also have this set and think its one of the best helicopters tlg made in the 90s its quite big and has got place for 2 minifigs in the cockpit i also like the fact that theres a victim included in form of the xtreme diver which also is a theme i always loved as a kid do you have any other resq sets left to review it would be an honour for me to also do a review of one or more sets which are left but unfortunately i got not much time at the moment	positive
metalandi on aug 15 2008 0716 am said do you have any other resq sets left to review it would be an honour for me to also do a review of one or more sets which are left thanks metalandi this and the emergency evac set are the only req sets i have i would encourage you to share a review as you have done some very nice reviews	neutral
i got this set as well as a resq hovercraft this set is cool because of all the accessories and it come with a x team guy your set is also in much better condition than mine you have made me decide to rebuild it another great review thebrickster keep up the good work	positive
thanks for the review brickster i do own this set in its original form the only drawback that i have noted previously is the lack of rotors and the cobraesq of the copter body i wish it had a larger fuselage but i still have it and i still like it despite my criticismwhich i am sure is in my eyes only thanks again brickster i wish i had bought some of the other res q sets but of course i only bought three	neutral
ive always wanted this set and the hovercraft too bad i never did great set	positive
what exactly makes you feel this set isnt realistic it has got nothing what wouldnt be on a real helicopter imo and for the futuristic design yes it looks modern but it works and actually most of todays real helicopters also dont look like in the 70s anymore	positive
metalandi on aug 24 2008 0417 pm said what exactly makes you feel this set isnt realistic since the question was asked 1 tiny rotors 2 dual cockpits only seen on a few military copters 3 stretcher extends beyone edges of fuselage when inside the vehicle 4 extra long canopy really only seen on military helicopters and military design 5 black colorscheme for rescue vehicle the the stretcher minifig designs and rescue logo are the only things about this copter that really suggest that it is a civilian rescue aircraft its a toy set with alot of play value but i agree with karto that these kind of desgins really turned me off to alot of the town and city sets of the 90s on the positive side the new city sets with thier realistic nonfuturistic designs have really tempted me to buy more vehicles	neutral
it took quite some time but now im finally continuing with city reviews this one beeing about a really good set of the resq theme and also one of my favourites of this theme it brings a lot of playability and an incredible amount of useful pieces even with only 145 bricks in complete set nr 6451 name river response number of minifigs 3 number of pieces 145 release year 1998 price 20 usd back then when it was new unfortunately i havent got the box of this set anymore but the instructions are still there in good condition we get 3 resq minifigs in this set from which i really love the detailed torsos a shot of the complete set with both the boat and the little car off board the before mentioned car is really really little but it still got enough space to transport 2 minifigs a closeup of the rubber dinghy the speed boat as standalone as already said before this set brings a big count of equipment and accesoires with it which is really good for a set this size in the middle section of the boat there is enough space for a minifig to sit in and put on his diving equipment and last but not least a shot from the whole set wirh everything attached at the front section you can see a wench which also adds a lot to the set when i got this set back in the day i was really happy about it and for sure spent a lot of tie playing with it because of its great features as the wench in the front of the boat or the car the boat can transport i hope you like my little review stay tuned for more in the next days edit i forgot the poll can sombody add it please i dont know how to do or if it is possible to do that myself edited by metalandi 15 august 2008  0359 pm	positive
this set was my first set ever from the resq series and i loved it entirely ofcourse i modded it slightly here and there after hours and hours of fun and excitement it has great play value even for a set in this size	positive
wow i loved this set i still have it actually in pieces though i took it apart quite soon after i got it then managed to lose the instruction manual	positive
if you still have all the parts try to rebuild it youll see that its a great feeling	positive
very nice review this is another set which i had never seen before when i am in my dark age quite an useful set especially with the accessories and the minifigs torsos the speedboat is able to hold the car and the rubber rescue boat how can the driver steer this boat with so many things blocking the way i cant seemed to find its control though thanks for doing this review	neutral
well i for one really like this set it has to be one of the nicer ribbies that tlg has made tons of playability and nice options for redesign great set overall thanks for the review	positive
6004 crossbow cart review because i may start collecting castle here is a review of one of my few castle sets please note i hurriedly put his together meaning some parts are the wrong color look out for them this review will also be done in my star wars review style the lighting is also particularly bad in the pics on with the review parts 20 figs 1 price  1overview and fig the whole set the fright knights knight the disemboweled knight the head printing is just longer then the helmet visor 2 the cart the cart has 3 crossbows and 2 norman type shields the carts advanced defense and weapons systems all the parts from the cart forgot to add the fig in 3extras  overall here are all my castle figs remember i dont collect castle yet  oh yeah i forgot to put one of the old skellies and a ghost on there could a castle fan tell me if any of these minifigs are rare i have no idea because i dont collect castle build 610 pretty standard for a impulse minifigs 710 nice minifig with lots of accessories design 810 this set made way for some of the new castle carts of similar size parts 1010 3 crossbows 2 shields arrow quiver and spear as well as cool minifg in a 20 piece set price 1010 well i dont know but lego was cheaper in 97 so it gets 10 playability 55 pretty much standard for a impulse set overall 810 good parts and price as well as minifig scores this set an 8 thanks for reading	positive
about the rarest one up there is that black ninja i only have one ninja and he is dark grey i also have five samurai the witch may be fairly rare but i am not sure i didnt really collect much in the fright knight era	neutral
very nicely done  this cart is a striking resemblance to the crossbow cart we got in 2007	positive
nice review i agree with thok it’s quite similar to the more recent crossbow attack though this one has the added benefit of two shields this set would i fleet be more useful to army builders than most of the modern castle sets even though many people don’t like frightknights	neutral
quote even though many people don’t like frightknights i dont really like fright knights either i just happened to have this set	neutral
looks great and the figures up there are old and kinda rare i dont really like fright knights though so i probably wont get this set	neutral
thanks for the review ive added it to the index im not a fan of this theme but i have to say that this is a neat little set that does hold some good things figs and weapons are always welcome and one can never have to many wheels so i rate this average	neutral
i gave it above average it was a nice set and included some nice pieces but it is only an impulse set after all edited by newright 19 august 2008  0106 pm	neutral
this is really an ideal small set in spite of its size it has nearly everything • three minifigs • a vehicle • a building • numerous minifig accessories • numerous rare and useful parts • nice model design especially for the time period too bad outback came out during my dark years	positive
this is probably my alltime favorite lego set it was originally given to me for my birthday by a close friend of mine back in the release year of 1997 the cargo plane was by far my favorite vehicle ever unfortunately someone stole the plane from me when our families went on vacation and the rest of the set was given to my cousins oldest son when i was no longer interested in my lego collection now that im back into lego i use that buildings construction for various projects especially as a dr inferno lookout shack using parts from extra mission 3 swamp raid the shack compliments the original set greatly edited by skorpius47 19 august 2008  0144 am	positive
this was a cool set i thoght of it as i was building the post plane	positive
one of the best in my humble opinion as far as i know it was never released in the uk so the only reason i managed to get my hands on it was on a family holiday to the us i think they’d only recently opened the lego store in disney arguable the best feature is that it seems to fit into a wide selection of themes is it a airstrip in the middle of nowhere is it next to a only mining town that’s not deserted the possibilities are rather open and that’s truly great	positive
legoman132 on aug 18 2008 0936 pm said this was a cool set i thoght of it as i was building the post plane interesting thought i have the post plane but i havent opened it yet i suppose its the yellow the plane in this set is much different than most of the other classic town airplanes in that it has the double tail section heres a shot of the new 7732 air mail set  definately a nice set	positive
i have had this on my bricklink wanted list for ages and yet noone with my criteria has it nice review and brilliant set	positive
thanks for the review kimt oldies reviewsold sets  are always appreciated i feel this set isnt that great 1 yoda he is by far the best part of the set although is his weapon blue 2lord tyrannus pretty nice i feel the middle part of his torso is a bit bland but that isnt a problem i wish they would make a fleshie one too 3 speeder bike i always hated this design the back looks terrible to me way too bulky in my opinion it jusnt give me the image that its the same as the movie the lightsaber is amazing why is it only in this set 4yodalifter what that is terrible but at least it has some nicely colored parts a fine set but not the best imo	negative
you think its not a great thing that we get a yoda fig in an affordable set like this that was the main reason why i got this set and what do you mean by another wasnt this the only one that was ever released except for the one in the dagobahxwing set sure he is not the best fig with the unmovable legs and all but still its yoda besides he doesnt move his legs a lot in real life either nice review though and thanks for telling me what that liftarmthingy was meant to be for i never got that and thought it was supposed to lift up the speeder for some reason i got two of this set and the printing on those blue parts were off in the second one i got edited by oky wan kenobi 18 august 2008  0845 pm	positive
nice review i realy like this set two nice minifigs in an affordable set and i do like the speeder but that lift thing is strange but now at least i know what it is thanks for letting me know	positive
i think this is a pretty lame set it came with dooku who i think only came in this set plus a unique lightsaber still they could have made it much bigger added anikan and obiwan and added structures and made it more like the scene from the movie also the speeder doesnt seem very accurate	negative
i wonder how expensive this set would be on ebay shop victoriously	neutral
i missed this setbut i reallly like the yoda and count dookui especially like count dookus lightsaberone thing thoughis it me oris yodas lightsaber blue in the picture edited by pr0visorak 20 august 2008  1221 pm	positive
i was very lucky to get this set and i love it i dont have it built cause i bought it for parts but it was fun while it lasted 	positive
great review kimt at that time it was still in my dark age and i hated myself not to get this set earlier this is quite inexpensive and you are able to get two greatest characters especially count dooku the minifigs are excellent especially the unique design of count dookus lightsaber i have no problem with the speedbike as it looks quite alright to me as for the elevation of yodas jump adds some playabilty but that does not work well for me nevertheless the main attractive factor is count dooku and i have to rate it a 5 i never own a yoda except for the magnet version	positive
i know we have another review of this set but since i just got it i thought i would share my comments on it set name droid gunship platform number 7678 pieces 329 price 2999 before we begin i will say that i like having a droid gunship but i still hope we get a maf hmp droid gunship maf droid gunship on to the review here we have the box it is really shiny and smooth and fits the sets size okay it has a clean bright look and is truley outstanding the back of the box which has the features of the set as well as the other three cw sets the contents the siticker sheet no to bad and the stickers have clear backs which is always nice instructions here we have the figstwo new droids and one older armed droid for the cockpit and the extra parts the build starts with the flat base pretty simple the bottom the side lasers next is the head it starts pretty soild the side buble laser turrets loveing the detail on the ship the lid and eyes the finished cockpit cozy interior would have had more room if it were the maf though the front landing gear simple and effective the back landing gear the rockets the clips are annoying but it make the rockets work so i guess it was nessecary mounted on the bottom not very secure but thats why they are meant to be dropped on the clones the finished ship  let me say that the droid gunship is a nice set indeed final rating 86 hope you enjoyed the review please if you have a ny questions pic requests etc then by all means ask best regards vbbn	neutral

hello all eurobricks members and classic town lovers  editors note to mark the celebration of classic town this set which is released in 1994 and rereleased as a legend in 2002 pizza to go review is dedicated to classic towns opening cermony and members such as hinckley brickster imperialshadows sinner and many others whom have contributed to the final success of classic town thank you so much for inviting me to be part of this wonderful project and i wish all the best to the success of classic town i urge everyone of you to check out classic town and take alook at the cool stuff we have done  today i will be doing up a review on pizza to go set this outlet is one of the most favourite eatery for any lego citizens living in their town when they are driving on the road they are sure to look out pizzeria signage they offer the best pizza in town no one in town can resist the delicious aroma of pizza coming out from the red chimney let us find out why is this shop so popular among so many lego citizens and was one of the famous sets that is rereleased under the legend theme pizza to go is my favourite set of all time i believed there is no other pizza outlet lying around in any lego city apart pizzeria it seemed there are the sole outlet that is selling pizza for many years this set was rereleased in 2002 and it is part of the legend theme this is one of the few sets that are highly demanded to be brought back by many fans of lego around the world i owned the 6350 any members whom had owned both sets before is there any difference between these two because when i searched through peeron it shown 144 pieces instead of 194 pieces for the 1994 set name pizza to go theme lego system  town year 1994 rerelease 2002 pieces 194 minifigs 3 an image of a 6350 pizza to go let the delivery begins pizza to go is the regular pizza outlet that sells nothing but pizza they deliever pizza to every household in town with their trusty delivery van walkin are welcomed too there is a stand for customers to dine in their pizza quickly before making their way to their next destination in my opnon no town can ever survive without the pizza tradition devoted pizzeria staff every outlet comes with 3 dedicated staff making sure that operations will run smoothly on the left we will have the pizza boy whom is wearing the regular blue dungarees and its white cap i wonder who is that boy on the middle we will have the pizza girl she looks like any typical sweet girl in town that the boys will look at she is wearing a suntop strapless on her she reminded me of one person though i think her name is called alice taking a careful look i wonder if imperialshadows is the pizza boy back then without that black patch on its left eye on another note this minifigure was my favourite female minifigures are very uncommon back then i am glad i have this figure adding to my town population on the right we will have the hardworking chef preparing the pizzas in the oven he wears the regular white chef outfit but he wear a grey pants instead of the usual fullwhite outfit in most resturants such as breezeway cafe 6376 lets take a closer look at the pizza boys van this van is very very small looking and very fuel efficient it is able to cut lanes very fast due to its small size the pizza van is made up of 4studs wide design no doors by the side however in this vehicle i think the doors is not a must to be included in this design our pizza boy will need to leave vehicle pretty fast and ensuring that the pizza delivery is on time common mechanism this van has the regular rooftop that can be lifted up to place the pizza boy into the driver seat there is a sun roof on its top which enable him to let him have some sunlight from above the logo on the side of it is actually a transparent sticker which have the pizzeria itallian logo and a tasty looking pizza on both sides of its van i like that sticker very much mine looks quite worn out over time if its a printed piece it will be a terrific bonus nevertheless i can still accept the sticker our pizza van can deliever up to 2 pizza at a go at every trip 2 piping hot pizza will be stored at the back of the van the pizza is fitted in perfectly in each compartment furthermore the white window shutter is terrific in this design you dont see this kind of design anymore i think i have not seen much delivery vans on the street anymore too base of the van from the base you can see that it is using of the regular red car base that is common in most 4studs vehicle design in fact this car base served as a foundation for its vehicle design back of pizzeria alice and the chef will be showing you around at the back of the kitchen there is an oven on the left a water tap and a holder for the oar stick looks pretty empty right look below for a surprise my favourite feature this oven can be used to heat up 2 pizzas at a go now i understand why this set is named pizza to go i have been using their slogan unknowingly this feature is superb nice now we know that the pizza is prepared from the outlet instead of using delivery van to collect it from a factory alice what are you waiting for help the chef quickly pizzeria the signage sure looks big from far and catches their attention easily too with its pleasnt looking design as you have already noticed this is made up of sticker i dont mind for this set it contains sticker sometimes i do hope they can give us spare sticker for us to change after a long period of time distinct red chimney this is the front of the oven and that is where the smoke comes out using only bricks to construct this is simply wonderful i like the use of their white bricks to construct the wall layout and a combination of red parts especially on the top i like the look of this very much another picture on its side printed parts in this set you will get a total of 5 pizzas and i believed no other sets offer so many pizza you can placed up to 4 pizzas in the van and oven alice will be carrying the last pizza around the green and red round dish is a printed part most exclusive part in 635010036 the most unique and important printed parts that is only exclusive in this set its at the front of the pizza van it is none other but the pizzeria logo standing at the front of the delivery van forgotten to take a picture of this piece took it from peeron different views of pizza to go outlet another bright sunday day in pizza to go summary review playability 1010 a lot of playing by doing up the pizza process from preparing to delivery design 9510 outstanding design with great use of bricks i like the structure of it very much price 9510 an inexpensive set based on the 1994 pricing it comes with 3 minifigs shop a van and a exclusive printed piece overall 9710 i am not trying to be bias in fact this set is absoultely filled with minimum flaws look at my review again if you are not satisfied with it or tell me what you dont like i gave it a 5 based on my review score card what about yours hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelfwhen moderated	positive
easily one of the best town sets ever and pretty expensive for its size too iswas it that rare i hope i still have all the pieces from mine unfortunately my stickers are in pretty bad shape took them off because i needed the bricks stupid stickers covering multiple parts  only downside to this set the design is simple yet so detailed and the pizza van looks great 55	positive
i do like the set although i dont own it i do remember lusting after it when i was a kid though mainly because of the female minifig and the colors its a bit simplistic but comes with a few great parts you also did a great job on describing the set and the pictures give the full impression of the appearance for the review i just have to point out a few things to give you constructive criticism first of all its chef not chief entirely different professions and secondly the scale you give in the poll isnt very even above average jumps to outstanding which is a too big of a gap in my opinion you shouldve used good or great in between them but these are only minor faults this is a good review anyway	neutral
i rate it a full 5 too and i wish lego would make a set like this in 2010 a town needs pizza edit dont always trust peeron sometimes they miss some pieces and sometimes they just cant count them edited by the cobra 24 august 2008  1141 am	positive

jopiek on aug 24 2008 1048 pm said a very good set indeed we have at least 3 of them but we like them all what do you mean by we you own three sets of the orignal 1994 series or the 2002 legend series	neutral

this set is great and so is this review i really like seeing reviews of classic sets like this and hope to see more in the future the chef in this set is the base for my sigfig in fact the classic sets have a totally different feel to them than the newer sets they look more human great review	positive
i remember having this set when it was originally released a good few years back but i dont think i have it anymore i remember i thought it was really awesome though i thought the oven and pizza storage in the back of the car were the greatest parts the little sink on the inside was cool too didnt realise they had made a legends set out of it id love to own this set again but misb examples on bricklink go for an extortionate amount of money ah well se la vie	positive
its defintely nice to see this past classic town review resurface again i tom bricks on may 15 2009 1005 am said i used to want this set so badly and i almost got it when it was rereleased i still wonder why i didnt because with a building van 5 pizzas and a then very rare female fig this set would have been perfect for someone with a smaller collection like i had then what surprised me the most is how well this set still holds up to others today off to bricklink i agreed that this set is perfect for someone with a small collection in fact i feel that this set is one of the must have set that can allow you build your pizza franchise in your town posades on may 15 2009 1045 am said definitely one of my favorite sets from my childhood i still remember my sister getting it for me for my birthday and me building it that same day too bad i had it displayed all these years on my windowsill so the pizza delivery van and pizzeria have become yellowed is it possible to restore it by getting those bricks or parts again yellowed bricks is really very saddening it reminds me of my breezeway cafe those were the days where we are too young to know how to take good care of our toys alywin on may 15 2009 1059 pm said i also always think the girl minifig is supposed to be a customer lego is really up to everyones own imagination you are right the girl could have been a customer i thought of her as a staff misrepresentation could be so easy but then again the box nevr stated its role too	neutral
nice review i have this set and i like it alot its a master peice	positive
indexed allright hi everybody again today im gonna review the biggest set of the resq subtheme 6479 emergency response center with this one i think the reviews of all the resq sets are complete now and while im in a reviewing mode right now i thought id bring that up this set hast got many nice aspects and also some very rare pieces and comes with a wonderful amount of vehicles including a speedboat a tow truck a helicopter and a trike which can pull a little boat so sit down get your popcorn and beer were off to stormy weather at the coast subtheme resq set nr 6479 name emergency response center number of minifigs 5 number of pieces 420 release year 1998 unfortunately i dont have many of the boxes of my resq sets anymore so ill start right off with the instructions this time on the backside there is no alternate model as usual this time but only a different shot of the whole set next a general overview sorry about the slightly bad picture quality on some pics this time originally this set has 5 minfigs which all are really nice but the guy who drives the tow truck has been lost in the flood heres a picture of the missing fig lets move on to the vehicles we have something for the water the ground and the air in this set first the great tow truck i love the mechanism with the hooks in the back next on da speedboat at the rear its got a stretcher and a wench which adds a lot of playability if theres a a little accident near the coast the trike comes to appearance for more complicated stuff we have a little helicopter i broke the rotating piece at the top yesterday ouch   no space for a victim you say well not really but the helicopter also got a wench with a hook in the back now it comes to the station itself at the docks a neat life belt sign is mounted remember at this time there werent real ones as today a little more right an equipment holder is placed with various tools on the front and fire fighter equip at the back at the very front a little lighttower secures the shelter i havent quite found out what this thing is supposed to be maybe somebody knows another equipment holder this time with all the stuff you need for diving more equipment and even more we come to the hear piece of the station the control room with lots of buttons and scrrens last but not least a quick shot of all the accesoires and tools that you get which really is an amazing amount this set might have a few junioriced pieces as the big window in the front or the briedge on the roof but that doesnt matter because there is nearly one other set in which you get so much rare pieces and such an overwhelming amount of accesoires so i can recommend that for everybody who is a piecesfanatic not to forget the playability the great figs and the in my opinion very good color scheme once again thanks for taking the time reading and looking at my review i hope you liked it edited by thebrickster 31 december 2009  0919 pm	positive
i own this set and its one of my favourites simply because of the cool colour scheme which you mention plus all the vehicles and accessories the resq theme is one of my faves of all time actually i own nearly all of them missing a small set that was only available in the us or japan i think dr s	positive
i just built this set in mlcad as a requestfor a fellow eurobricks member somehow i missed out on this set completely when it came out i was really suprised how long it took to build virtually despite its size this set is packed with details minifigs vehicles and tools thanks for all the pictures gif xml 6479 emergency response center edited by missouribb63 31 december 2009  0932 am	neutral

hi everyone this is my first review on lego sets here hope you guys like it and i would like to apologise for the bad quality pictures hope you guys dont mind first i will start with the box art box art i guess this is the first time that lego star wars sets use white and blue colour for their box i like the new colour scheme a nice blend though heres the front the back not to waste space on the box lego do some advertisement to attract us to buy more sets grinthe more the side at the top side there is this minifigs scale picture it is great as we get to know the real size of a minifigs contents the contents consist of a sticker sheet instruction book and 8 packet of bricks the packer are not numbered but it is ok as there is not much pieces instruction book and random page as usual the instruction book have brick checklist other sets pictures and tutorial on how you should assemble your set i mean the very first page sticker sheet there is not much sticker sheet and is a great news that the republic logo on the round plate is printed unlike republic gunship anyway i didnt apply the stickers the commander gear this is a new thing to minifigs as well well is like batman accessories they pack it in one small packet however you only get one commander gear pack in this set anyway i didnt use them the minifigs well we get the the new minifigs the ugly face clone new printed torso and new mold of helmet however i not really like the new head stud i prefer a black one or at least the one like jango fett black colour with face the helmet everything is printed no holes at the visor there but there are hole on the both side this new helmet mold also made the headgear turn 360 degree freely without helmet with helmet you can see the flesh tone at the hole beside the blasters  short blasters were given instead of long one is great at least they give us two blasters instead of one the tank here is the pics of the tank it was not badly design nor nicely design but it looks great if you didnt saw the beneath or under the tank view from front view from side view from back whats beneath under it was 4 wheels to make it move fluently it is made by the thread supporter like the one we fet from tie crawler or battank the functions well firstly you can open up the hood i guess to see the engine secondly the side cannon that can move upwards the thing is quite tight see random instruction page and there is barrier to block the cannon from going downwards the cockpit well the cockpit is small and the space is limited the monitor stuff is printed brick and is another great news you have to remove the piece pic below to reveal the cockpit and put your clone to pilot it popup gunner mechanism well the backdoor have a thing to attack to the seat of the gunner the top hatch is very loose so it there is a clone as a gunner and you open the back door the clone will popup and automatically open the hatch on top this is how the top looks like without a clone there is this movable cannon upwards left and right and a little keyboard thing with it but the cannon fall off quite easily the flick launching missile mechanism the mechanism is on both side and you need to turn the thing inwards to reveal the flick fire mechanism below are the pic of how it is turned you can keep you blaster at the front of the side there are place for you to store them it close nicely completion this is how it looks like extra parts there quite a number of them overall this set is not bad the price is quite expensive but you will like it the popup mechanism is something new to me but this set have more function and 2 clone trooper with a pack of commander gear pros 2x clone troopers high playability nice design cons a little expensive sticker sheet cannon on top falls off quite easy edited by kimt 27 august 2008  1216 pm	positive
thanks for that very elaborate review nice to have several pics from different angels amazingly well done if this is your first ive added a poll and will index this review within this week along with all the other topics i am to index 	neutral
yes the review is great indeed i love indepth reviews with tons of photos as for the set  im not planning to buy it but it looks ok i think its a good tank	neutral
wow this is one great review fantastic pictures this looks like one cool set with heaps of neat functions a shame it doesnt include exclusive figures like ahsoka and captain rex in the atte or plo koon and asajj ventress in the gunship but you cant have everything so again thanks for this sweet review peace	neutral
bad quality pictures whats wrong with them this is a great review and thanks i was planning on buying this set and no others but the price stunned me thus i bought the atte and the rgs the set is better than i thought though i might do as mutley did and make my own	positive
thank you kimt for adding the poll hehe this is my first review so im not so confident about the pictures thank you guys for viewing and commenting	neutral
nice review i hope i can get this set as well as agents city  other sw stuff and nice pics i didnt think they were bad i thought they were pretty good	neutral
splendid photos and well written review i love it ive owned and built mine and must say its a good set and the tank dont disappointment in terms of design and playability i got mine stickered well been a perfectionist i am p thanks again for the review that it should deserved d	positive
baby i will like to take a moment to said outstanding piece of review for your first attempt you have done well with the pictures and its flow i have to admit that i love this fighter tank very much the downside of it which is overpriced and two clone troopers do not really justify the purchase well if i have the spare cash i will defintely get one of this keep it up	positive
wow this ship is really big judging from the size of its hull wondering where can i keep it when ive bought it 	positive
mattzitron on aug 13 2005 1130 pm said the strange thing is for the first time i can remember the minifigs came decapitated and theres no neckwear i recall jake saying something about it being new lego policy to supply the minifig heads and torsos separately what with the expensestrimming and all its apparently one of the many little quirky things theyve discovered in the manufacturing and packaging process that people have done for years without thinking in this case putting the heads on the torsos but that turns out to be a surprisingly significant expense timewise i suppose think it was in one of his blog posts but not sure too tired ie lazy to go hunting for it now sorry 	neutral
but does this mean that they add to the piece count is it a super secret clever way to make the piece count seem bigger than it is hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm  addition ive built it review up later tonite but heres this to wet your appetite	negative
its a shame it only comes with two figs it would be great for my ancient middleeast project	negative
mattzitron you have done well to display images of the dung stain hull its a darn shame that it cant be extended however i see no reason why lego couldnt produce a special middle hull piece that is compatible although the way theyve made the hull is a bit stupid the old system was a lot more flexible better still why cant lego design a hull that can be extended in length and width then they could be as made as long or wide as desired and that would be great	negative
good work samsta no wonder i wasnt aware 4 pirates and all	positive
yoda601 on aug 17 2005 0253 pm said its a shame it only comes with two figs it would be great for my ancient middleeast project if you ever get a moment id love some pics of that ive been tooling around with something along those lines in my ever expanding fantasy setting akkh	positive

very nice review of a set that ive been dying to get but my friendly neighborhood lego store never seems to have in stock the yellow seat is most definitely not a new piece i had two of those in my old beta1 command base almost 30 years ago	positive

metalandi on aug 27 2008 0326 pm said thanksfor this review i also got this set recently and im very happy about it i live the design of these new trucks and the forklift is also great not to forget the good amount of cargo btw i think the mysterious cargo only are normal fuel barrels thanks normail fuel would be in those octan barrels	positive
great review i dig this set it could have only been better if it had been a 6wide version of the old 6367 semitruck still i ask whats so special about the special edition	neutral
kimt on aug 27 2008 0500 pm said hmmgood question lets hope our reviewer can help us out here and i can the set is exclusive to lego brand retail stores lego sh and toys r us only	neutral
metalandi on aug 27 2008 0750 pm said that explains why it isnt in our local stores i also got it from sh but my box hasnt got the special edition printing on it surprisingly just like dwarves mine is exclusive to target holodoc on aug 28 2008 0416 am said nice review vbbn i stumbled upon your yellow seat as well didn´t you have one already or what made you think it´s new the big letdown on this set is the big canopy i would have preferred single bricks for that and for this truck there is no real need for a hollow canopy  it could as well have been made of solid bricks maybe we get another set with different use of the canopy this is one of the reasons i didn´t buy it so far and i´m especially not interested in another forklift i have plenty of those i agree it´s the best one we have seen so far though thanks i have a yellow seat but i just thought it was interesting as for the canopy it really looks good on the finished truck i like it and that forklift could be the official one and the rest could become parts	positive
today i shall be reviewing 8290 mini forklift which i recieved when i went to tru to get a technic set so enjoy set name mini forklift number 8290 theme technic parts 89 price 1099 1box the box for this set is suprisingly small its about the size of a 399 set it shows the main forklift and the set information the back of the box features the dragster a very cool model and the suspension works perfectly 2contents we have two instruction booklets one for the forklift and one for the dragster the bags here are a few interesting pieces the long double pin in blue a bionicle connecter joint and a yellow l joint 3build we start off build nice and solid with your average technic build the following steps build up the detail of the bottom part next comes the cab its pretty simple yet effective after that comes the forks they work very well but if you have the palatte on them and you let go it might topple off hint put the edge of the palatte on the small lip on the pieces that connect to the forks this will hold it on better the finished product and palatte extra pieceskeep them as they are used to build the alternate model here is something that i found how to put a minifigure into the cab first remove the side doors then set the fig into the cab with his arm sticking slightly out the gap and finaly seal off the cab a nice way to put system into technic for your towns  parts 910loving them all price per part ratio 810somewhat pleaseing playability 910 works in any system town and has a great dragster alternate model overall 2630 86 b overall i would definatly recommend this set to anyone whether you are a system or technic fan this is perfect it has great parts and is pretty cheap the alternate model is also very good i hope you all enjoyed my review i have made the pictures the requested size on my camera i look forward to hearing your comments edited by vbbn 27 august 2008  0702 pm	positive
that´s really a sweet and charming little technic set thanks for that fine review	positive
nice review the figure fitting inside is great i think the price might be a little high but you did get it from tru so what else is to be expected	neutral
what that looks like a walker an imperial walker no€ theme space blacktron i set name alienator set number 6876 number of pieces 82 figures1 released 1988 list price £99 it seem no source online has the price peeroncom bricklinkcom as always lets have a look at the box first as i€™m luck to own a boxed version of this set walking across a planet with a grid pattern sky the back shows a great selection of alternative models after opening the box we find a single instruction booklet inside the instruction booklet now we come to the man in the black visor the mark i blacktron and black and industrial he look in my opinion i think he probably has the second best lego space torso before the focus group decided they needed to be brighter now turning to the walker itself it€™s a simple build which i don€™t think even i with my great skills for messing up could get wrong the final unit is built in three key parts the command pod which is attached to the body by two pins at the back the walker legs this is pure design genius simply built easy to replicate and no fancy parts the top section which open to reveal the blacktrons hightech tools time to put the entire set together i think you€™ll agree it looks great for such a simple build looking like you could take on the universe a side view of the finished product a frontal view of the alienator what the hell how did that take down an atat this is one of my all time favourite lego space sets actually i didn€™t have it predark age and only recently bought one what attracted me to it was an old boxed set but since then i€™ve discovered a set that i wished i€™d owned long ago the rating system figures 810 i love the dark industrial space look parts 710 yes it may be nearly all black with some yellow highlights but is have a good range and they fit to make several great models fun fun fun 810 it walks well and it€™s a great set it has a large number of possible mods design 1010 it€™s ingenious the walking mechanism is so simple and yet so good i can€™t fault it price 10 while i could tell you how much i paid i was luck on ebay so this remains a question mark grand total 3340 reduced top level due to lack of price knowledge conclusion a set which in my opinion showcases what lego was about in the 1980€™s the set has an excellent design ethic and looks great with very limited parts it retains great action and functionality twinned with the great main model you€™re shown that there are a number of other great models you can make with the same parts this set is what it€™s all about for me i€™m very glad i bought outside my normal theme when i saw this actually on the strength of this set i recently order 6894 blacktron invader and can€™t wait to get it and see if it lives up to the alienator	neutral
i loved all of these walker sets it was such a smart technique i made one myself with what i had ahhh good times thanks for the great review	positive
the ywing is the work horse of the rebel alliance it’s well armed and heavily armoured but you’ll need it because you’ll be moving like a sleepy hut – general rieekan set name ywing starfighter set number 7658 number of pieces 454 figures2 released 2007 list price £3999 lets us begin with the box the front shows it in all it’s swooshing glory httptdyorgukimages765802jpg the back shows some of the many features of the set and also others you might like to buy in the star wars range after opening the box we find a single instruction booklet now we come to an important aspect of any star wars set the figure here we’re provided with an anomalous rebel pilot and his faithful r5 droid the pilot comes with the fairly standard lego star wars nonhero helmet printing what’s he going to do with the blaster taken on the entire empire one of the more interesting parts is the assembly of the engine which if like me you don’t pay enough attention to the instructions when building you can end up getting wrong the key detail i got wrong just before fitting the last engine if we look carefully on the side we can see a missile launcher i didn’t think torpedoes or concussion missiles were fired from there but i may be wrong after fitting the engine the models looks like this in all it’s glory manning one of the alliance’s fighters not so ready to take on the empire was he so overall we have a well designed model which is in my opinion far superior to the original we were offered with darth vader way back when lego star wars was new this ywing is sleek and looks great in my opinion the firing missiles are also a great touch the rating system figures 510 for the same price the last xwing had far more figures parts 610 swooshability 9510 design 910 price 310 grand total 32550 not to shabby conclusion so finally the answers to the questions you’ve no doubt want to know is the set worth the price i’ll be frank £3999 is too much for this set despite this i currently have a squadron of three ywings the reasons is this set has been on sale a number of times at £30 it’s certainly worth the money lego recently placed them online with a price of £20 this i think was a great price for the set and well work picking one or more up if you wanted to start your own rebellion	neutral
a wonderful set and a really charming design well detailed and pretty smooth at the same time perhaps that small gap at the cockpit´s an a little weak point but we can always mod a little thanks for that very neat review cardinal brick	positive

ive built the ywing and the imperial landing craft 7659 more or less at the same time and for about the same prices i think the imperial landing craft ilc is much superior to the ywing the ywing doesn’t have much functionality besides an awkward dropping bomb device and a moving cannon the missiles firing system is … your fingers the ilc has an awesome missiles firing system i wish i could get it individually for mocs a clever bomb dropping mechanism 5 minifigures with weapons the wings fold up together and the “cargo” can be detached as a play set i’ve built the ilc first so i got quite disappointed with the ywing	neutral
kimt on aug 28 2008 0908 pm said youve got to be kidding the ilc is bulky and doesnt even come close to the design superiority of the ywing its smooth its beautiful and its awesomely designed by the designers at lego its got greebles man i was not talking about the looks of course the rebels have got to have nicer looking ships	neutral
i like the model it is one of the best rebel sets out there but i dont like it that there is no landing gear when you set this one on the floor your rebel base it looks like it crashed or something and looses its look of superiority actually quite fast it needs to be at least 2 studs high if not more from the ground tlc is in these days afraid of flimsy landing gear as they gave to us in the early sw time now they want something sturdy for playability but i think there should have been some details on the bottom especially a landing gear that unfolds i also dont like the mistake of tlc that they changed this year with the release of indy hopefully to give the pilot a usual smile face the old yellow version of gold leader even had a headgear i hope tlc realised this year that we want more detailed faces well the licenced sets we got proved that but who knows the upsides of this set are the amount of pieces and detail especially the engines were fun to build and perhaps the most interesting construction i have seen in years also it is big bulky and looks sleek at the same time just wonderful and next to the 4502 xwing it looks in the perfect size i gave this the highest rating even if the underside disappoints but whatever it is lego you can add some landing gear on your own thanks for the review your pics were really really good next time make more of them please	positive

is it worth the money since the new ywing comes out next year	neutral
i think it is a fair to ask questions here with the expectation of a new ywing in the coming year i came here to look at the review even though it is a few years old no images to go with the review bummer id like to see a more friendly tolerance on dated threads being bumped	neutral
fallenangel309 on 19 september 2011  0201 am said again we know next to nothing about the new ywing it wouldnt be possible to say whether 7658 is worth the money relative to the new one until we know what the new one looks like what its minifigures look like how much it will cost etc also note that yodalikespie has been banned is that a threat is it fair to ban someone on the forum because they revived an old thread and made inquiries thought this was a forum to discuss lego and that is what he was prompting i dont really care why he was banned but this isnt the only time ive seen this type of behavior and discourse here on eb	negative
etav8r on 19 september 2011  0316 am said is that a threat is it fair to ban someone on the forum because they revived an old thread and made inquiries thought this was a forum to discuss lego and that is what he was prompting i dont really care why he was banned but this isnt the only time ive seen this type of behavior and discourse here on eb not a threat at all  i was simply pointing out that yodalikespie made the mistake of inquiring about the new ywing before we had any information on it to my understanding its not so much the fact that he bumped the thread as the fact that he bumped it for no good reason im not certain where the moderators stand on this issue but i feel that yodalikespies question would have been better received had he posed it after a substantial amount of information had been gathered on 9495  as ive said there simply isnt much one can go off of at this point to determine its value relative to 7658	negative
maybe the thread should be locked or taken down since the pics consist of broken links kind of a pointless review without the pics and for the record there are other websites with preliminary images of some the new 2012 sets that are not on the eurobrick star wars 2012 rumors thread perhaps that banned fellow was hoping some of the lego insiders had some knowledge about it i guess well never know now edited by sharky 22 september 2011  0922 pm	negative
and lo it came from the east denmark the set which had been foretold the cheap army builder and there was much rejoicing amongst the castle fans the cardinal then asked was all the rejoicing justified… set name the knight set number 5615 number of pieces 21 figures1 released 2008 list price £200 lets us begin with the box the front shows us are knight and his rack of arms the back shows us two sets from the castle range moving inside the box now the contents of the box it doesn’t look like much the instructions to help you through the build now the reason you probably bought the set well at least why i did the knight this features the new torso for 2008 and is the height of fashion this brings the number of printed torsos from the crown knights to three which allows for a greater variety in building your armies a new fashion sensation and all the must have accessories for this season with a more heavily armoured look he’s ready for anything the rest of the set is a weapons rack i assume that once you’ve got a few of these set you’ll probably like me give up building them and part them out but anyway here are some pictures of what the rest of the elements are spent on a long and complex build begins after 360 hour finally it’s finished sadly five minfigs were hurt in the construction of this rack now the money shot where we can see it all come together it looks great even the rack doesn’t look to bad sadly are hero wasn’t ready for other themes just yet in total we have a good army builder which castle fans have wanted however there remains a question in my mind as to if this set is good enough on it’s own without any other castle sets i can’t see it being to much fun so it’s not a good present the rating system figures 910 great new fashion for this season  parts 810 shield sword spear helmet and armour what more could i want well two shields fun fun fun 310 sadly it’s rather dull on it’s own i can’t think or to much else to do design 710 yes it’s the army builder i’ve wanted design well apart from that pirate one price 910 at £200 what more can i say grand total 3650 let down by being to small to stand alone conclusion so let’s answer the question is it the army all castle fans have wanted well yes and no is the answer while it is a great set and at the now reduced uk price of £200 amazing value i still think it’s inferior compared with the army building capability of cross bow attack i much prefer army building both factions at once	positive
thanks for sharing this review with us ill add it to the index one of my favourite impulse sets along with the troll warrior or is that orc warrior	positive
do we really need more construction works legoland is just one huge building site theme city set name mini digger set number 7246 number of pieces 36 figures1 released 2005 list price 350 usd 7426 peeroncom 7246 bricklink catalog diving right in let get some photos of the box the digger at work the back just has more of the same not to inspiring once we open the box we find two poly bags and some instructions the total contents of the box well minus the air instruction booklet short and simple now the single minfig of the set nothing new of special that i can see …got a job working construction for the johnstown company moving onto the digger itself it’s one of those builds where all you really need is a quick glance at the instructions and off you go side view of the finished product alternative view it doesn’t look to bad now lets add our construction worker looks rather good though the lifting action isn’t smooth it’s nothing special it’s not the greatest construction set that lego have ever produced but i think it is worth the money the arm action really does bug me though the rating system figures 510 just another construction peon parts 410 nothing novel and i dislike the new digger arm system fun fun fun 710 i think the playability is high and you can get a good load of bricks in the bucket design 610 not the best designed digger but not the worst price 710 a reasonable price for what you get grand total 2950 still halfway decent but nothing to write home about conclusion this set is yet another in a long line of lego digger and to be honest it’s not the best in my opinion i still hold nostalgic memories for 6504 which i still think is a great digger from my point of view the set sits to high off the ground and make me wonder how the worker gets in i really don’t like the digging arm action it will never be smooth and while it poses better i just think it’s inferior despite this i still think it’s not a bad set i’d just like it to be so much more	negative
another fine review i love the last action picture thanks for sharing btw i am so looking forward to that 384 london bus review	positive

thanks for the review vbbn i have to say ef has never really caught my attention but this set seems alright to be honest when i saw the topic title i was expecting a tiger looking mech the mech itself is cool except for the huge leg pieces i think the minifigs are great in ef sets with the dark colored outfits like dark red or dark green	positive
thanks for the review one of the best sets in the entire line	positive
since my last post ive had the chance to build the tiger and i was surprised in a good way a much better set than i actually thougth front	positive

what do you mean the troll’s should outnumber the crown knight how are you going to manage that well here’s the answer theme castle set name troll warrior set number 5618 number of pieces 19 figures1 released 2008 list price £250 gbp 350 usd 299 euro 5618 peeroncom 5618 bricklink catalog 5618 shop at home lets us begin with the box the troll warrior and his might cart set sets for children to pester for at christmas now for what’s inside the contents of the box it doesn’t look like much now for the troll himself i’m glad they selected this troll torso rather than the other one for the impulse set i think this one is the superior one also he comes well armed with a spear and sword but no shield sadly someone really needs to look at the rodent problem in the castle sets now the cart nice easy construction as with all impulse sets i’m still not convinced by the flicking missiles a line of those would do some damage what an oncoming army can expect to see all together now and it looks rather good so there we have it a cheap way of bolstering the troll army and outfitting them with some more weapons also for anyone planning a pied piper moc another set with a rat in it the rating system figures 810 preferred troll torso and helmet style  parts 710 two spears and a sword but sadly lacking that all important shield fun fun fun 410 somewhat more to do on it’s own that other impulse at least the troll can fight the rat design 710 well designed even the flicker missile doesn’t look bad price 810 at £250 more than the other castle impulse grand total 3450 lack of a shield and to small to stand alone for my rating system conclusion castle fans got a great army builder with the knight and they’ve been lucky enough to receive another one with this set i’m glad we’ve got a troll impulse as it allow for enlarging the armies of evil some the crown knight don’t totally outnumber all their opponents	positive
best impulse set so far thanks for sharing your thoughts and yes someone should look into that rodent issue ill add this to the index within long	positive
good review i got 2 of those wheels are very useful especially if you dont have any  as for shields  i dont imagine trolls use them too much i think that they fight berserk style  all out assault one complaint is the piece that the wheels are attached to  its a single piece with smaller than the standard pin connection so you cant change the width of the cart for your mocs using the wheels i dont know if a piece with such a connection only on one side exists though 	positive

nice review i never new trolls had fireworks at least thats what it looks like to me maybe i shall build a trollish fireworks company fireworks on	positive
thank you for the nice review the set is not that bad but a shield would be a nice addition i also dont like the flickfire missile a camp site with a fire and a chickenleg would also be nice about the rat isnt it just foodsupply for the troll the only problem would than be that the food is running away	negative
that’s the problem i couldn’t quite tell what it’s a bit of a problem in a reviewer maybe a hose to clip to the fire hydrant i don’t know	neutral

i discovered this review a month ago and since that point in time i could not get the image of the sparkling golden chest out of my mind i finally just purchased the chest for myself i suppose this is a testament to how well honed your picture taking skills are this set is definitely a nice one im not a lego indy collector but i was tempted to purchase this set several times the vehicles are very nicely detailed and have some cool building techniques such as the wheel guards	positive

welcome to another sunny day in legovilletoday we will be joining the mailman on his daily route delivering the days mail when i first saw this set i immiediately liked iti think tlg should make more of these everyday life type sets such as delivering mail going to the grocery store things like that anyway enough blabbering on to the review 7731 mail van set name 7731 mail van year 2008 theme city pieces 66 price 799 pounds 499 euros 595 price per piece about 12 cents well start with the box shots the box is an interesting shape that i have never seen before very rectangular the box art is pretty nice the back shows the mailman delivering some mail the picture on the front is the same as on the box random manual shot the manual does not have the piece call outs but on a small set like this i dont feel its needed parts list decent selection of parts i really like the mail pieces image at the back of the manual showing all of the cargo sets together in a little scene i like it when the manuals have images like these because its nice to see all of the sets together all of the parts spread out the parts in this set are pretty good unfortunatly the car base is one large piece however we do get 2 printed mail pieces which are always nice our trusty mailman this torso i think is very nice the little envelope is a nice touch extra parts not much to say here the finished set i really like the design of the van it looks very smooth and somehow looks very lego to me the colors are my favorite part the red and yellow look nice together a nice mailbox however i wish the letter on the front was printed the front of the van is nice i think the textured brick on the front gives it a different look on the front which is nice the back of the van the doors open to store mail although it doesnt have much room i like that they included this feature delivery the mail bricks slide right into the hole at the front this adds nice playability the vans all loaded up we are ready to deliver  parts 710 pretty good piece selection but for 8 should have included a few more playability810 its fun to deliver the mail to all of your towns residents design 910 the design is very nice except i feel that some of the stickered parts could have been printed overall 2430 after a long hard day of delivering mail theres nothing like enjoying a nice pizza and letting your hair out why do they make us wear those silly hats anyway this is a nice set that i can definitely recommend and i think tlg should certainly release a post office to go with this and the air mail set i really like these everyday life sets rather than always fighting crime or putting out fires those guys have normal lives too brickshelf folder httpwwwbrickshelrycgif338718	positive
legoman132 on aug 29 2008 0335 pm said this set is nice it looks like a dhl van funny thats what i thought when i first saw the pics good review btw oh and i keep meaning to get this set but keep forgeting	positive
good review thanks for the mail van while it certainly adds interaction and fun to a lego town it alone lacks details and playability and thus not a good set especailly taking its price into consideration its value is pretty much just like if not less than some impulse sets in my opinion	negative
its a good set but i think the first sticker shouldnt say 7731	positive
nice review i like this little set some how it reminds me now of postman pat in dutch pieter post an english childrens tv series about a postman in a little village somewhere in yorkshire aah sweet memories i would rather have seen a postoffice released with some women minifigs instead of the green post bigplane but maybe in a couple of years	positive
rriggs on aug 31 2008 0255 am said i actually like the use of the old style car base and mourned the day that these became exitinct the first time round c1990 i dont hate the piece but i did object to the way this set fills in the middle recessed area with a 2 x 2 plate that is nearly impossible to get out again without doing some damage to it whats more if you fill in the recessed area youve eliminated the only rationale for using the car base in the first place	negative
welcome to another sunny day in lego city the sun is shining the birds are singing minifigs are drowning wait what the coast guard rushes to the scene and deploys the coast guard 4wd  jet scooter to save the poor minifig from drowning lets take a look at the coast guards buggy 7737 coast guard 4wd  jet scooter set info set name 7737 coast guard 4wd  jet scooter theme citycoast guard released 2008 price 999 usd995 eur799 gbp pieces 130 minifigs 1 price per piece about 8 cents now the review the box here is the front it shows a nice image of the buggy on the beach with the ocean in the background the back the back shows some of the features in the set such as the extra equipment manual the picture on the manual is the same as on the box as usual the parts the set has great colors i love how the orange blue and white look together the part selection is quite good but unfortunately uses the large car base coast guard minifig this is a great fig the torso print is very nice and matches the buggys colors well new tire mold here are the new tires they look very good inmanual shot color separation is not a problem here and since it is a small set the piece call out is not a necessity extra parts it is always nice to get extra cheese slopes the finished set the design of the trailer and jetski is great the jetski is very smooth looking and the color scheme is fantastic the sticker on the roof is nice but its actually too big for the piece the corners of the sticker flap where the piece curves jetski closeup here you can see how it attaches to the trailer i didnt add the sticker that goes on the front which is a little sign that says bb03 or something attaching the trailer this is where the trailer connects to the main car it attaches simply with a ball joint car front view the license plate is a nice sticker and the top lights look nice say cheese driver the back the back is very similar to the front it has the same sticker the equipment rack a very welcome addition to the set it adds quite a bit of playability the orange fins are great all decked out he looks pretty spiffy in his diving suit doesnt he brickshelf folder the ratings price 1010 you cant get much more in here for 10 parts 910 nice selection and great colors the big car base is a bit annoying design 910 the jetski is a prime example of something with a small amount of pieces that still looks amazing playability 910 you can drive the car go diving and jetski across the bay minifig 710 the one it comes with is great but it could have come with one more perhaps a citizen of some sort build 810 simple but looks great overall 4250 lego sh brickset peeron bricklink even in the face of danger this member of the coast guard always has a smile on his face summary simply put for 10 you have to buy this set it is one of the better sets in this price range you can buy and one of the best small city sets the colors are great the design is great and the fig is great i dont normally think small sets are worth heavy praise but this one definitely deserves it thanks and happy building	positive
what an outstanding review of a great set i esp like your intro i have this set but have not opened it yet it looks like a fun little beach set the new coast guard theme is very nice edit this set could almost pass for classic town except for the use of orange and the lack of opening doors on the car 5 stars	positive
great job i will want to get this set soon its a lovely set with some coast guard saving on the jet ski what i dont like about this set is the lack of doors everything about this is nice but i still have to give it a 4 as for the entire flow of review i agreed with brickster that your introduction is very good with the little amends i had added earlier it turns out to be very good keep it up	positive
a very good review of an especially charming and lovely set thanks the whole cg theme looks very nice to me with a good and detailed set design and this one´s no exception although it would be nice to see more car doors and some new mf faces though	positive
thanks for this review i was thinking of getting this set and having read your review went out today and got it what a great little set what i particularly like very sturdy build feels very solid as you build the pickup compared to the fire pickup  trailer i also have the orange pieces my first pieces in this colour the tyres which give the smoothest ride of any lego towncity vehicle ive ever built the raised suspension and side runners the coast guard dude again a first for me and his megacool flippers and aqualung the jetski controls  the handlebars actually move left to right which is a great detail little details that lego didnt have to do the grey handle by the ball joint moving handlebars the new tyres as you can probably guess i have voted outstanding for this set erdbeereis1 on aug 29 2008 0602 am said color separation is not a problem here and since it is a small set the piece call out is not a necessity you do get a piece call out with this set i did anyway its on the back of the small poster that is included in the set thanks again cheers rog edited by rriggs 02 september 2008  0253 pm	positive
erdbeereis1 on sep 2 2008 0915 pm said i meant the piece call outs during the build that show which pieces you need for that step oh cardinal brick on sep 2 2008 0905 pm said one question though do you think the jet ski is as good as previous ones i have to agree that the jetski is an awesome little piece of design apart from the handle bars it has a really cool orange piece on the front a piece ive never seen before  the 4x3 wheelarch sort of thing cheers rog	positive
i agree that this is a very good looking set i just finished building mine yesterday and i love it but here is one suggestion trim the large sticker that goes on the roof of the vehicle by cutting along the angles at the front of the sticker if you use it as it is it will extend beyond the flat surface of the roof and will overlap the lower sections past experience with stickers has suggested that this sticker will lift at the front corners lego stickers are probably the best that there are but sometimes modifications must be made now i want that large coast guard helicopter 7738	positive
nice set nice review i already have one coastguard set that truck but i like the idea very much however the rigid inflatables could be much improved see the real ones at wwwrnlicouk or wwwknrmnl	positive
great review of a great set one question how does the robotarmpiece connect to the jetski	positive
the coast guard sets are very eye catching the color scheme is making me want to pick up the entire line although the offshore platform hasnt been released stateside yet ive had my eye on this particular set for a few weeks now and is near the top of my to buy list with instructions provided on legocom i build a dr infero version of the jet ski to replace the one used in mission 2 swamp raid its a very sturdy design bulky enough to make it feel like a real vehicle great review too thankyou for the closer look at the set	positive

i had to vote outstanding on this set because it simply is great minifigs a cool head sculpture and a nice little boat means unlimited playability great review though man	positive
what a great review of an excellent set i love the islanders and that drum outstanding i think these islander sets never got the credit they dserved i really like this set and its a great addition to the pirate collection	positive
what a wonderful review with smart showing the right parts and clear pictures fantastic job erdbeereis1 this set is interesting for several reasons first of all it contains a large amount of very useful minifigs not many sets of this size contain so much figs secondly the throne itself can be easily combined with the other islander sets or even with other pirate and nonpirate sets im going to see if i can get this one for a reasonable price on ebay	positive
great review well done for sure i love these reviews of old set and this one is especially unique i must agree with you the color scheme is magnificent makes me want to go to ebay and buy it now to bad for spongebob though he got in with a real bad crowd	positive
thanks for the great review this set is pretty standard as islanders go but it is such a cool subtheme that i dont care a bit i totally agree with your comment about old and new sets i dont think i would enjoy lego as much if i didnt have a decent amount of kits from pre 1999	negative
another very nice review and im glad to see it has some nice pieces as well as characters too looks to me that no one on bl has it in australia for sale so i may pass on this beauty though i did pick up king kahuka recently he makes an appearance in my medium entry	neutral
17 for an old set is good i may hunt for it on ebay 	neutral
an outstanding set because who doesnt love islanders outstanding review as well	positive
very solid set 5 minifigs and plenty of weapons to go around adding up to great playability what more could you want aspecially from a set this size only i would have liked another cutlass a musket instead of 1 of the pistols and for 1 of the pirates to have another head but those things are no big deal it is still a lot better than sets nowadays edited by fluyt 23 december 2008  0950 pm	positive

well for some weird reason i missed this before so i tell you now very good review as we are used of you erdbeereis1 i like all the islander sets and own quite a few myself for people that dont own any of the islander sets yet the 6262 king kahukas throne is a great way to start lots of minifigs and accessories	positive
well this is a not so old set and i bet most of you already have it so here is another review from me as usual let us start off with the box art box art i like the box art they put a nice background for the atap at the side we have the minifigs scale and at the back there is the function shown and advertisement for other set the content the content is consist of 6 packets of bricks and a instruction book yeap no sticker sheet instruction book the instruction books not only show us the steps but also show us all a clear pictures of the january release sets and some sets show with their function well this includes the atap functions as well besides there are bricks checklist as well and the how do you start off before assemble your sets and a little poster where the clones with their atap battling the droids heres a random page new pieces to me i never see both of this piece before so i assume it is a new pieces anyone have any idea is there any other sets that contains this piece the blasters we are given a 2 long blasters which is great which i it is more accurate as most of the clone troopers use a long blaster the minifigs the minifigs is 2 shock trooper but is different with 7655 clone troopers battle packss shock trooper the leg is different in colour we are given white hip while the one in the battle pack are given a black hip furthermore we get a new printed headgear which i think they have improve it check out the mouth printing the colour is brighter so here is the headgear the headgear limit itself from turning to the side this is because the front part it is too low until it block by the torso the shock troopers without helmet on we are given a black stud no face printed how i wish that i have extra with helmet on comparison with shock troopers from battle pack the atap heres the atap it looks ugly at a certain angle and looks great in a certain angle anyway i still like the set i like the walker vehicle below are the pictures taken randomly top view side view without stabilizer leg with stabilizer leg rear view the functions well the functions are not so impressive just something turning around open here and there the only function that is say as special is the retractable stabilizer leg the cockpit the cockpit can fit two clone troopers but too bad we are only given two and is not enough as there is no gunner on top inside it there is a guns holders which can hold two guns but fall off easily when you are trying to remove the guns well the other side have some speedometre thing and a controller to reveal the cockpit you have to open the top hatch look below so you can see whats inside oops the side hatch and back hatch as well open and close i think this pieces is use not to let you open the hatch but to make some design i mean make it able to move inside with clones beneath so this is the pieces that hold the stabilizer leg when is not in use this is how the stabilizer leg move at last and of course the revealing cockpit from below and at the back guess the droids have alternative way to take this things down faster the leg there are pieces blocking the leg to go to the front i mean overhead and lose balance the base in not movable the side armor the side armor has door and this is how it is attach it is very flimsy when you want to adjust it to be a little steep to creat the shape they might just fall off so it is connected to the body with just a technic pin and to hold it properly here is the support the side hatch it open and close easily very loose nothing to hold it tight heres some view when the side hatch is open the cannon the cannon on top is movable and adjustable the big cannon can move up and down while the smaller one can cove sideways but the smaller one tend to lose balance when it is without minifigs means the one on top and below will not b align this is the pieces that only enable it to move up and down to prevent it from moving freely lego put two pieces to block it completion i try to make the sets looks great i think this angle is right spare parts it is so few compare with 7673 magna guard starfighter and it is more expensive overall this set is not really a good set the hatch is quite flimsy top and the side since there is nothing to hold them tight besides it is lack of one clone but to complete your walker collection you must have it pros no sticker needed new improved headgear long balsters cons lack of clone flimsy expensive as few pieces are given hope you guys like it edited by kimt 30 august 2008  1201 pm	neutral
swman on aug 29 2008 0835 pm said i do not like the fact that the clones have pure white legs it looks weird to me it was also weird that they included shock troopers but it was probably a way to get people to buy it this set also seems like one of those that was kind of thrown in with a mix of other sets like the tie crawler i never picked it up and with the new clone wars sets out i wont me too i dont like the the shock to have white legs because i am very fussy and i dont mix them i also expect other clone to be in this set but it came with 2 shocks i buy it because i like the walker vehicle	negative
i agree the pure white legs are odd as is the inclusion of shocks instead of pilots or regulars or maybe even kashykk troopers that might have been better	negative
baby on aug 29 2008 1254 pm said has anyone noticed the boxart includes the 3rd leg both in the lowerd position as well as the raised one stauder	neutral
i switched my shock trooper legs as soon as i got this set as for the new pieces im pretty sure that they were also featured in the striking venom set nice in depth review i switched my shock trooper legs as soon as i got this set as for the new pieces im pretty sure that they were also featured in the striking venom set nice in depth review	neutral
stauder on aug 29 2008 0845 am said has anyone noticed the boxart includes the 3rd leg both in the lowerd position as well as the raised one stauder i believe thats to show off the functions of the set nice review you carefully explained every detail and i think that ill buy this set now im glad lego decided to make two seats in the interior and they did a very nice job on the third leg looking good both up and down i think i will switch the hips of the shock troopers into black like the other shock troopers	positive

i could have gotten this set if i wanted to but it seemed like a waste of money to me i dont like the shock troopers helmets that much i feel they should have printed visors instead of cut out ones like they have in my opinion it would make it look a lot better the at ap itself sounds like it has a lot of holes in its cockpit which drags the set down and make it seem like they havent exactly put a lot of effort into it great review	negative
wow talk about a bumper nice review baby this set is quite nice i would have goten it if i had had the money but didnt back then so didnt get it it has a nice parts selection why did lego do the shock troopers with white hips and the bp ones have black hips confusers me commanderfox	positive

well set out review with alot of great content gotta ask you though how does the set look nothing like the box art with so few pieces id have thought one could mentally put it together given the box front	neutral
i’m not a great communicator but what i was trying to say was that on the box the sets looks quite exciting and well made and that the alien fits much more snugly than it does so i was a bit disappointed that it seemed wider and less compact and certainly less exciting when i opened it	negative
well now we at least know that we can avoid that set  johan	negative
thanks for this review as for the set well i am not to crazy about this set but i want some sort of small alien fleet vehicals and this would work well but i would rather ave my money to buy classic town edited by vbbn 01 september 2008  0248 am	negative
to be honest i am going to give this set a 1 that is my lowest rating i will ever give to a set in eurobricks in fact this is the only impulse set which i do not have it at all after looking at your wonderful review i am going to give it a 2 and actually consider it to buy at least one to complete the entire impulse set series i dont really like the design and the alien at all in fact i prefer the mars mission astronaunt more than the aliens i dont really like the set but i like your review	negative
i already dont liked the aliens but if the fighter was better i would already bought him now i will maybe buy one of it just for the 2 limegreen pieces	negative
i rated this poor due to the fact the set is unimaginative looks like a bunch of plates where thrown together and it just isnt worth the money lego is asking for it imo ive never been a fan of the nonarticulated jellies so ill leave my disgust for them out of this post however unlike the set the review is a fine work of art that clearly depicts the goods and provides valuable insightopinions about the sets playability usefulness and overall value	positive
impluse sets are made good by using parts well and minifigs this has either i give a low score i really dislike the alien figs worst lego fig ever	negative
sets we miss include minfig sets like this one€ theme space set name space minifigs set number 6703 number of pieces 30 figures 6 released 1988 list price  unknown 6703 peeroncom 6703 bricklink catalog lets begin by admiring the outside of the box wow 6 figs and all equipped i was four more of these we don€™t get instructions so the back show how to put the figs together now for the men themselves the complete line up of all six figs it seems strange half are in black a closer look at our four futrons a look at the blacktrons looking like nice guys with their visors raised time for a closer look at the range of tool these good men received from the lego company yep one accessory per person the question is what could you do with this set i mean it€™s just spacemen in a line do you see the man who mugged you ma€™am a good set from an age when we could look forward to every few years a new set of minfigs and just a box of them the rating system figures 1010 an excellent selection for the time parts 410 good accessories but nothing else fun fun fun 710 i can see lots of opportunity for fun with this set design 810 well it€™s not really designed much but it€™s a great idea price 10 unknown at this time though mine was from woolworths grand total 2940 a good mark for a great set conclusion until the castle battle packs came out this year we€™ve been suffering from a lack of minfig based sets and from this review i think you can see why for many of us and i include myself here lego minifig are one of the best parts of the hobby and sets like these allowed you to build up a much larger number of figs lego did well with this set a nice range of figure and also a good selection of accessor	positive
you you got it mint in sealed box it indeed is a nice set i am not into space but nevertheless this set is a good addition if you need to get your space environment a little bit more crowded lego however is planning to release a minifig set again next year city and of course the advent calendars are also quite nice to get some figs with accessories	positive
cardinal brick on aug 30 2008 0623 pm said the question is what could you do with this set i mean it’s just spacemen in a line what could you do the possibilities are endless 1 you can stand them in a line 2 stand them in a circle 3 stand them in a square 4 sit them all down 5 sit some of them down and leave some standing up adult supervision may be necessary for tfols attempting this one 6 take them all apart and scatter the pieces like some kind of huge space mine has gone off 7 yeah ok thats probably enough for now seriously i love all the sets of minifigs from all the different themes and this is a great one i always wanted them when i was a kid but never did my focus always was on town sets petrol stations and police sets please stand up and there was never enough pocket money left over for space sigh you are so lucky to have this great set thanks for sharing cheers rog	positive
fantastic review this is one of the classic minifigs pack which is so great for gathering massive number of minifigs i miss those days where they sell 5 minifigs together in a set thanks for this lovely review	positive
7670 hailfire tank and spider droid number of pieces 249 number of minifigs 4 price 1999 usd 2599 eur 1999 gbp brickset hello everyone today i will review the extremely underrated hailfire tank and spider droid set i hope this review does it justice so lets start with the box note this picture is not mine standard box for star wars in that time the background on the box looks like its from geonosis indicating that this set is from episode ii and not iii or the clone wars the back of the box not shown shows the playability functions and some other sets that were released at the same time as this overview here is an overview of the whole set it comes with one construction manual and no sticker sheets   this is a very simple set but with not much to it it is still a very important part of the cis army especially if you are interested in army building i like to call this set a super battle pack and youll find out why soon lets get right to it and look at the feature of the set the hailfire tank front a front view of the very cool tank here you can see two triangular shields on the hull the main body is very simple but altogether very effective and clever and making it really look like a hailfire tank although a little bit sized down from its movie version the transred stud used as the eye makes the tank look more menacing side the side view the wheels are very easy to make but its a real pain to connect all of those chain links together i dont see what you could use the links for except for another tank but maybe someone creative will find something for these the dark tan is nice though the wheels are held on by technic poles and the tank rolls on the wheels fairly well on carpet or a hard surface back this is the back of the tank here you can see eight flickfire missiles four on each side of the new type so they dont easily fall out also note the modified 2x2 with extended hole piece sticking out of the back this may be used to easily push around the tank i just wish you could fit a droid in the body for the cockpit now we move on to the spider droid or what i like to call the dwarf spider the front this one is also simple but very cleverly built the main body is two semispheres connected together for rotation and an antenna a cannon four legs and eyes made out of a useful telephone piece the picture speaks for itself as far as how the gun and eyes are built side a side view you can now see the legs better which are more sturdy then you would think each one is made out of two pearl bronze exoforce robot arms a useful bley handgun piece and a dark bley battle droid body all connected to the under body a big knoblike piece back the back not much to say here i like this spider droid because it is very sturdy and the legs are easy to adjust finally we look at the minifigs there are four minifigs in this set which is quite generous for a set of this size it comes with a yellow battle droid commander i really like this one two battle droids and a super battle droid all three battle droids have the new blaster pistols and one twisted arm thats about it for the review so here is the final verdict build 810 very fun and easy besides the chain links should take the seasoned builder less than 20 minutes playability 710 the flickfire missiles are fun as well as just zooming around the tank could use some clones for a battle swooshability 810 you can roll around the hailfire fairly well minifigs 910 a generous amount of figs and all are pretty good design 9510 a really simple and clever set although a little too small for the movie version price 1010 a very fair price considering the priceperparts ratio and the coolness of the set overall score 8510 a very neat set to have a great army builder and great for display next to all of the other cis sets the price is fair the figs are good and the build is very clever thats all for now folks please feel free to give some feedback edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0308 am	positive

thanks for the review jimbutcher i really like that set it combines interesting and good design with some awesome cool parts and a neat amount of charm	positive
great review i agree that this set is underrated the hailfire is supposed to be a little taller than two battle droids so scalewise its nice the dwarf spider droid is amazing in my opinion i just wish it wasnt brown it makes me feel like its on geonosis we never saw a grey varient of the hailfire so its fine with me that its brown	positive
this is a great set i have 2 of them now and i plan to get more it is much better than the droid battle pack for 10 bucks more you get better battle droid arms and some canon vehicles good enough for me	positive
thanks for the review is a great one this set is not really a good set but i like the spider droid the hailfire droid scale is not right i think it is suppose to be even bigger anyway this is the first set that rerelease the commander droid so i grab it	negative
thanks for the cool review jimbutcher  actually i really like this set it is small but very clever and even if the hailfire droid is undersized what in the whole line is not under or oversized  the new spider droid is the best small build i have ever done in a set and the droid commander is pretty cool  i am happy with the set and i will get another with my comiccon exclusive 	positive
this is a must have set for aotc fans and i really love the hailfire droid but it costs like 80 or more now that its discontinued	neutral
7681 homing spider droid limited edition number of pieces 206 number of minifigs 5 price 3499 usd 2999 eur 1999 gbp theme star wars episode ii year released 2008 brickset folder bricklink catalog welcome to my sixth review on these boards of the mighty homing spider droid at first glance this ball on legs may not seem like much but hopefully this review will change your mind the box this box is the standard for all of the new clone wars sets sleek shiny and a rightoutofthefactory look the blueandwhite color scheme is fantastic and portrays that the sets are based off of a cartoon well this box has a limited edition in spanish too  seal slapped on the front although you wont have trouble finding this in your local toys r us because of the big clone wars display in the front of the store that you cant miss overview in this picture you can see the contents of the whole set minus the instruction booklet built you can spot five minifigures which ill get to later and a very tall cis weapon known as the homing spider droid this weapon of destruction is a musthave for your cis army although the color scheme mostly dark bley and light bley is a change up from the regular colors brown or blue of the cis this may have something to do with the blended armies of the trade federation and corporate alliance but i dont know for sure the instruction manual is very thin only about twenty pages homing spider droid this is the main part of the set four huge legs two mounted guns and a red sensor eye are the highlights of this artillery unit theres not many playability factors to this one but sometimes its just fun to squash the little clones a changeup of the contrary it also looks good next to all of the other cis sets but you might want to clear some room in your display area the legs take up a lot of room this thing is also massively tall about the same height as the republic cruiser main body this is the main body of the spider which has no cockpit and is remote controlled this spherical body not in that sort of way is a very quick build and features a big red eye connected by a red stud and hinge top gun here is the top gun not with tom cruise which is connected to the body using a clever technic system pun not intended as you can see from this picture you can see that it can rotate a full 360 degrees but only if you remove the eye also the gun can be pulled back and if you let go it will snap back like the a gun does when fired due to the force of the shot im not sure this was intended by tlg because it wasnt showed anywhere on the box or in the manual lower gun here is the gun attached to the under body of the main part it is attached using a hinge which allows it to move up and down i also like the cord that presumably transfers power included on both guns hips here is one of the hips attaching the legs to the body there is one on each side with two legs each the are attached to the body and legs with technic pieces legs you can see the tall legs in this pic they are basically just technic poles and connectors feet this is one of the feet the essential to balancing the whole vehicle these and the legs are repetitive so i suggest doing them all at the same time to avoid flipping back in the manual and repeating the process three more times the picture speaks for itself for the design of the feet all are connected to the legs using a doubleholed technic piece one massive son of a gun this thing is so tall it frightens the skin off of even the toughest most experienced soldiers run for your lives look at how much havoc and fear it causes family photo enough of the battle scenes here is a shot of this spider with its smaller cousin the dwarf spider droid minifigs finally here are the minifigs that come with this set there are five in all which include battle droid nothing special but still an addition to your army commander battle droid i love that yellow torso super battle droid again nothing special clone trooper im glad they gave us one in this set i can add it to to my other phase 1 clones commander fox i love it everything from the dark red markings to the accessories are fantastic the head is just the regular anime style clone wars face this set comes with two flashlights two antennae one visor one pauldron and one kama closeup of fox here is a closeup of fox so you can see the detailed insignia of the republic guard that wraps it up for the review here is the final verdict build 810 very easy and straightforward a little repetitive with the legs should take the seosoned builder around 20 minutes playability 610 not many play factors but its fun to just squash puny clones with this giant arachnid swooshability na minifigs 1010 you really cant ask for more in this sort of set design 810 not very sturdy but it is altogether clever price 510 yes it is limited edition but pumping up the price fifteen dollars more than it should be is a little ridiculous overall score 8510 an excellent set for display although not very sturdy minifigs are superb but the price could be better in the end i would highly recommend this to any prequel trilogy fan looking to build up his her army well thats about it for this review please feel free to leave your opinions edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0309 am	positive
i just bought this set the other day and i must admit that it gets a below average from me the price is not corresponding with what you get which would be implied had jim added the eur or gbp price in the infohint hint  the spider droid is flimsy at best making it stand or even move without tumbling over is hard also why the brown cylinders on the legs keep the colourscheme clean please the figs are fine except that i dislike the clone headgear and the fact that the helmets now have holes in the sides allowing the flesh head to show within  goofy looking i am soo replacing the clone heads with black ones great review of an acceptable set	negative
thank you for that good review jimbutcher i think that this is really a pretty interesting and original looking set maybe it´s not very stable but it owns some special war of the worlds charm for sure	positive
massmanufactured and designed to withstand extreme amounts of punishment its an iron drone and its marching on its sentry set data 7711 sentry year 2006 theme exoforce subtheme robots pieces 74 4 extra  both counting hinge control stick and its base as two separate pieces price euro 7 circa misb including sh on ebay rrp was euro 5 circa  5 usd probably 5 ukp building time 2025 minutes 10 minutes building the rest of the time placing stickers more info brickset  peeron being 2006 my last dark year i wasnt a big exoforce fan but they were ok i tought 2007 models were better and still think 2008 models are the best that basically means 1 its a shame that there will be no more of this line and 2 this is my first 2006 model yet i bought in in july 2008 ok lets do this one box front box was battered due to italian post theyll do their best to give lego boxes a war outlook closeup the japanese katakana read tokushu butai  special military forces box back amazing alternate model some like it more than the original design box content a small but capable sticker sheet two bags and instructions sticker sheet and theyre numbered random instructions page connecting legs to the body instructions page  sticker detail thats why theyre numbered instructions page  parts inventory does anybody check if theyre all there before building surely not me loose pieces nothing rare i think small techinc parts come in different colours as usual you often dont see them when the model is complete but sometimes you do the iron drone strong and durable and much better looking than those crappy mm jelly aliens building starts the open cockpit  front and rear view left leg  front and rear view right leg is built of the same pieces left arm  with laser cannon the cannon  great use of the hollow studs with the plant tree palm top right arm  with twin missiles complete model  front view complete model  side view and rear view rating and review parts and building nothing new but both models are ok instead of waiting the last page of the manual youd better put the stickers in place while building looking at the box youd tell stickers background is trans purple it actually is trans clear excpet for the yellow and black stripes  warning hazard try not to put your fingerprints on the sticky side consider using tweezers posability both legs and both arms feature three joints and thats good so that the weight doesnt have the sentry falling down final model smaller compared to 2007 claw crusher and 2008 batlle arachnoid but cheaper and surely worth the money the minifig is just another iron drone not much to say final rating 355 edited by sinner 01 september 2008  0222 am	neutral
thanks for the review i really do like the first year of ef nowadays they mecha are perhaps more cleverly designed and use ball joints for playability but i really love the blocky bulky look of the first drones machines and somehow the older ones seem a better value of parts im more inclined to buy duplicates of them than the newer models	neutral
thanks for the review this is one of the few first wave sets that i didnt get im not really sure why as it wasnt too expensive	neutral
thank you for that fine review thebrickster i really like how this two small sets create an intense and adventurous atmosphere against the backdrop of a pretty exotic region the sets´re well designed and very nice with a fine amount of rather unique and well fitting gear the whole theme offers a lot of playability in a setup that´s a little different to tlc´s standard sceneries for sure and it always reminded me of who goes there too	positive
a very nice review i really miss the arctic theme i didnt own any of the sets but after looking at the pictures in this review and reading the instructions on brickleys words and brickfactory i want them	positive

nice review brickster the arctic theme is very nice the minifigs have a great look to them especially with the hoods the colors for the arctic sets i have always liked and somehow the idea of minifigs exploring the arctic is fun to me	positive
thank you very much for this review thebrickster i voted both times for outstanding because i really the arctic theme i only bought the ice sailor but otherwise no sets because of money and place reasons and because i already collect four themes city older castle western and star wars old triology but a comeback of the arctic theme  perhaps as addition to a winter sports and winter rescue theme would be very welcome i really all sets  the little and the big ones in my opinion they all were very well designed not too big vehicles not too little and not minimalitic great minifigs and very nice and lovely details and accessory klausdieter	positive
thanks very much for this great review thebrickster i love the arctic subtheme but unfortunately i never got my hands on any of the sets since this theme had its time during my dark ages this one is a really neat little set with a great amount of accesoires especially these snow shoes and the backpack which i love	positive
great review i hope tlc does another i rember reading a book once based on the theme which stated the scorpions and thespiders and such were aliens 	positive
wasnt there some years back a film based on aliens in the arctic cant remember the name and i think it was really old but there certainly was going on something with strange creatures and a polar base	neutral

2872 witch and fireplace review theme fright knights parts 18 figs 1 price unknown bricklink 500 year 1997 brickset peeron brickshelf bricklink ever wanted to turn into a animal wanted to curse your enemy or just wanted to be rich beyond your wildest dreams you should go visit the witch and her fireplace she can brew you up a potion for any occasion or purpose so head down to see the witch right now although this set is from the fright knights theme it can easily fit in with any other castle theme due to the lack of specialised fright knight parts and printings the set comes with no astounding parts but looks like the source for our good magician impulse set from the current castle theme i think i got this as a promo set official pic the box art for the set has the standard fright knight background and lego system logo followed by the set number down the left hand side of the box a cat is attempting a head stand also i think this box display the contents of the set in an attractive set up as usual 1 the whole set minifigs and all here is the witch on the torso there is a spider amulet which is a little hard to make out due to the low res of the image the witches wand is the same as the bellville fairy wands except in trans red like a lightsaber blade although it is completely useful as a lightsaber as you have probably noticed the witch has no legs instead she has a slope brick with the dress pattern printed on witch get it witchwhich looks better than asajj ventress from the new clone wars sets in my opinon for this anyway the fairysaber new word duel this is the old run down fireplace of the witch at the base there are two smouldering coals instead of fire witch its not funny any more is it doesnt make that much sense seeming as it is a fireplace the little triangular brick on top doesnt really do anything i also accidentally put the wrong one on while building it should be a sloping brick here are the coals the old trans orange studs are less translucent than the new ones i like how they have places them above the main baseplate on a 1x2 plate so they are in line with the rest of the fire place other wise it would look wrong here is everything else i havent covered yet the crystal ball the pets and the magical potion vial the crystal ball is identical to the one included with the good wizard impulse form the current castle theme i like the molds for the cat and the bat although if the cat had some yellow printing for the eyes like the white cat had black for the eyes it would be much better i think the trans green tube things are a little uncommon but im not worried about that 2 overall build 610 extremely puzzling and difficult do not attempt alone  its pretty simple but seeming as it has a load of stuff you can move around it is good minifigs 910 i really like the witch and it couldnt have really come with anyone else also it came with the wand which is really good too design 810 it should have come with some fire and maybe some more orange bricks to put at the base parts 810 the minifigure isnt bad nor are the animals or the trans green part price 1010 i am guessing this was pretty good seeming as i think i got this as a promo i gave it 10 because it was free playability 710 as wth all impulse sets there isnt much here but at least it comes with some animals to have a fight with or give the witch rabies overall 810 if it came with some more stuff for the fire place and the cat was more detailed it would have scored higher but because this set can easily be intergrated with other castle sets it got a mighty 8 3 mini comic  hocus pocus magic shocus turn my pets into dinosaurs not to catchy is it poof oh know i think i might drink my magical potion glug glug glug oh my	positive
thank you very much for this review skipper 24 i voted for outstanding since this set is a little but very lovely set i really it although i dont own it yet  since its very similar to todays impulse sets a minifig and some nice additional stuff and i like the black cat which gives the set a more gloomy atmosphere hopefully tlg will include a black cat and a chimney like in this set in the new advent calendar too klausdieter	positive
i chose above average it has a great minifigure i wish i had itsomeday i will	positive
you already know how i feel about the review as for the set im not entirely sure its a fine witch but youve already gotten her in the witchs windship and a few other sets i vote average on this a good minifig though one does not have the need for more than one witch and some fine additional parts	neutral
yay another fright knights review odd comic at the end skipper 24 on sep 1 2008 0705 pm said ever wanted to turn into a animal wanted to curse your enemy or just wanted to be rich beyond your wildest dreams you should go visit the witch and her fireplace she can brew you up a potion for any occasion or purpose so head down to see the witch right now sounds like a song or nursery rhyme somehow anyway to the review it is a great review such a small set but youve summed it up well this is one of the few unpromo fright knight sets i didnt get sadly not sadly because of willa the witch i have about four of her but the special cat and the other bits one can never have too many lego bats i voted the set outstanding i think it is for its size kimt on sep 1 2008 0816 pm said you already know how i feel about the review good or bad feelings edited by shoc 02 september 2008  1145 am	positive

review of 7670 hailfire droid and spider droid updated theme sw episode ii  clone wars parts 249  figs figs 4 price £2000 2000 ‚2599 year 2008 i think many people were deterred from this set because of the low piece count and a high price for it although it does come with 4 minfigures 1 overall set and figs official box pic this indicates it is a geonosis set from the background but it is no different from any other set same old brown separatist ships the whole set some red tan droids would have been nice like in the geonosian fighter set all the minifigs the super battle droid body is slightly different to the one in the bp it looks more grainy and silver i doubt this has any relevance for it being a geonosis set but i like them better how they were in the bps the super battle droid body dwarfing the commander droids body i think that the new commander droids body is better than the old one with just the yellow strip even though it is less accurate new twisted battle droid arm each droid has one of these i dont really like having droids with these new guns i think the older guns suited them much better 2 hailfire droid hailfire droid by itself it is certainly smaller than the original seeming as this is the main part of the set i was hoping it would be bigger but i dont mind it being this small too much wheels and rockets can fold outwards and inwards the wheels which spin round two large clear discs and made from loads of these tiny links this is probably the best way to make the wheels on this small scale the only other alternatives i can think of are using the tracks from the wookiee attack set or catterpilla tracks both of which wouldnt look right one of the missile pods these use the new flickfire missiles which dont fall out are an excellent idea they should have come with the purple cones like on the magna guards staffs instead of red though because in the film the missiles are purple one of the new flickfire missiles that dont drop out when the model is tilted forward i dont know what the holes in them are for though the 3 eyes are made up of 2 trans red cheese bricks for the sides and 1 trans red stud for the centeryou can also see how the missile pods are attached to the side of the body this is the back of the hailfire droid there is a plate with a hole in i have found only one purpose for this the hailfire droid is the commander droids war chariot what do you use the plate for 3 spider droid the spider droid the design has been greatly improved from the wookiee attack set not only is it more accurate but also more poseable which is useful when setting up battle scenes the ball joint provides the place to put the antenna which isnt long enough but the dome form the old set looks more like the droid form star wars episode ii the eyes are made of a telephone piece with 2 trans red studs on in the original it had orange studs the eyes can be seen in action 2 pics down i told you it was a telephone 1 of 4 identical legs these are very easy to adjust into what ever position you want and are much better than the originals but a word of warning never pull them apart as i did they become very loose when put back together so i put some blue tack in the holes 4overall build 710 a little to repetitive for my liking minifigs 810 4 figs for £20 isnt too bad plus they come with new guns design 910 both vehicles are very well designed but the hailfires small size let the set down parts 810 comes with lots of useful maybe not  brown track links price710 not too bad with 4 figs and loads of little brown links playability 610 not to much on its own overall 710 if it came with some clones and tan red droids it would be better afetr jar jar wiped out a small droid patrold he realized he was being watched mesa in big dodo this time	neutral

6205 vwing fighter number of pieces 118 number of minifigs 1 price 999 usd 1399 eur 899 gbp theme star wars episode iii year released 2006 brickset folder bricklink catalog welcome to this review of the vwing fighter this will be my eighth review on the boards strangely enough there was another set called the vwing fighter that came out in 1997 for the space theme note that i am missing several small pieces to this set but they are mostly insignificant to the overall look the box this is the standard box type for all 20052006 star wars sets i cant say that i like it as much as the 2007 or 2008 box types but itll do it features a profile view of darth vader and silver text overview this is the whole set this ship is meant to protect the chancellor at all costs they are usually found in groups of three or four front this ship is very sleek and youll notice that its colors are dark red light bley and dark bley with a touch of black it starts at the nose very narrow but as the body progresses to the back it gets wider like a v hence the name back here is a view of the rear note the transneon green discs used to represent the boosters also notice the dark red r4 astro droid and the hinges used as aromor flight all four wings two on each side can open up for flight attack mode they can open even farther then the pic shows but its not an intended function the wings a great but its a real pain to position them correctly and the bottom wings close when you set the ship down tail fins this is what the tail fins look like on each side with two flaps attached to the top and bottom if you look closely the tail fins and wings look a little bit like a mini ship themselves maybe controlled by remote no this is not an intended function either guns side the guns are very simple but very clever using a double technic hole piece two black bars and two technic pins also note the landing gear minifig finally here is the minifig a clone pilot it has light blue arms and legs white hands a helmet with black markings and republic insignia on it and a doublesided torso the front of the torso is great featuring shoulder straps armor plating and a life support system while this minifig is not altogether accurate to the movie it has still been one of my favorite star wars figs back the back of the fig that can double as the front of clone marines this side features shoulder straps and armor plating cockpit lastly here is the pilot seated in the cockpit he fits perfectly although it is not airtight we wouldnt want the poor guy to suffocate now would we that wraps up the review here is the final verdict build 810 a nice easy build and the last of the small sw ships 10 or less playability 610 pretty fun to swoosh around but thats about it could use a vulture droid but that would take away the small factor swooshability 1010 very fun and easy to swoosh around endlessly without fear of it breaking minifigs 910 there really is no need to have more although a palpy fig would be outstanding the pilot is a great figure though design 910 extremely accurate to the movie but the cockpit is not airtight price 1010 you couldnt ask for a better deal overall score 86 an excellent set unfortunately this is the last of the small sw ships currently the fig is great and the sleek design is accurate that just about sums it all up feel free to leave your comments edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0311 am	positive

the cobra on sep 2 2008 1133 am said  why are the figures already built are todays kids so dumb lets go back to those old minifig packs probably to reduce the sizecomplexity of the package thus saving tlc money i dont see it being a big deal as customization is always an option concerning the set not much to say other than it does what its suppose to do build up ones army of knights the variance of faces and accessories are great i especially love the chrome sword the price isnt bad either since the package comes with five nice figs and some great equipment edited by dj2005 03 september 2008  0646 am	neutral
i was going to get this but when i rang up sh apparently theyd sold out already price is a little on the steep side as well and i can only see it going up on sites such as amazon as the number of people wanting them goes up which it will it its anything based on the star wars battle packs	neutral

and another great review from one of our academy teachers i always look forward reading them  i think the battlepacks for castle are a great initiative from tlc i like this one but also the one with the skellies you get some different looking soldiers and a few weapons and shields so thats cool the low prices make it so that most people could build a large armybattle if they want to a big for your review and another for tlc for making these edited by zorro3999 06 october 2008  0540 pm	positive

its an ok set but its extremely overpriced where i live i simply couldnt justify paying 1799 tax for 5 minifigs the fact that these figures are featured prominantly in other sets makes this set a difficult purchase given the price i find it hard to look at this set with much enthusiasm	neutral
its way to expansive for what you get besides you pay more for the package then its containts	negative
i like your review on this battle pack but i think that this battle pack was over priced 12 for this i am not paying that much for 5 knights	negative
i really love these impulse sets at a low price point for lots of minifigs this police one doesnt appeal too much to me at the moment but who knows with your reference i may need it with a future project hmm its actually a good way of getting those dogs cheaply	positive

i like this set mostly because it has some very usable pieces but also because of the amount of minifigures in the set which is a whopping three and one large animal skeleton horse the one thing however that i dont like about it is that one of the catapult operators isnt armed in my opinion this would have been a good time for tlg to release a suitable dagger piece not the kitchen knife for its castle line great review by the way it captured the key elements of this fantastic small set	neutral
nice review to start off you got all the details someone could possibly need in my opinion at least i do enjoy this set as well and ive bought only one to keep my minifigs as unique as possible despite my personal preference i still find this a nice army builder good amount of minifigs for the price as mentioned earlier with each being different from the other though i would like the catapult manager to be armed with at least something i still feel that he can just flee if hes ever in trouble hes a good guy to use for the castle gimmics if you have it one more small comment i also love those domed helmets even if they arent actually new my favorite of them all being followed up by the racer helmet	neutral
millacol88 on sep 6 2008 0155 am said ive experienced that problem too i find my knights outnumber my skellies about 31 a crownie dies easyer than a skeleton its so hard to perforate the lungs or pierce the heart on a skeleton with a spear or crossbow bolt isnt it a great set with a reasonable price thanks for sharing it with us added to the index	neutral
youre really rolling these reviews out huh i am not sure how i feel about this set while it does include five figs three are skeletons and are generally worth much less than say three trollsorcs i know they didnt exist at this point in time so this is understandable the amount of horses is nice but im not a big lego horse fan what this set does have is a great appearance and brings atmosphere to the table 20 is an affordable amount for those of us who do not wish to splurge too much on a toy while being enough to actually get a large enough set to create something out of personally id rate it in between average and above average like another castle set i cant remember which i just feel this one also lacks something	neutral
well indeed looks like a very nice set especially the scared knights are very nice 	positive
one of the best sets from the new castle theme we havent seen a carriage in a long long time and it looks so spooky and sceary lots of minifigs new skeleton horses 3 this was the first set i got from the new castle theme outstanding	positive
that’s a nice review though i do feel the price was a little high but as you said you get so much in it last year argos in the uk reduced it to £799 which was a true bargain and sent me all over london looking for a store with more in stock again as with all the lego castle sets i think what makes it work so well is that lego are now providing a much larger number of minfigs and that’s often what makes a set	neutral

im a little late in the coming okay a lot  but regardless id applaud you for another fantastic and insightful review erdbeereis out of all the castle sets this one remains one of my favorites i got it for christmas in 2007 before i intended to spend much money on the new castle theme that changed once i managed to get the kings castle siege for a very good price its really a wonderful set all around  the design accomplishes the spooky undead feel very well and it contains a good piece selection and a phenomenal amount of minifigs seriously this set is almost unrivaled in modern lego in the final area  im still amazed at how many minifigures tlc put in the kit i also appreciate that the carriage has a far more realistic horse arangement  after all the sillyness of the onehorse pulled siege engines in kk its good to finally see a carriage pulled by multiple horses again all in all an excellent set and well worth 20 imo	positive
great review this is my 2nd favorite lego castle set tied with skeleton tower that i own my first favorite is drawbridge deffense	positive

7990 cement mixer theme town released 2007 price 15 usd pieces 209 1 minifigure introduction need a skyscraper built a motherinlaw buried a treasure kept no problem here i come  only one booklet for instructions without any alternative model its divided into two sections for two seperate baggies which the parts come in parts come in two big bags a few big pieces and the stickers are loose in the box extra parts and sticker sheet dark bluish gray 1x1 round plates are meant to be used as cement sticker sheet is neat a standard worker with helmet he comes with a shovel colour scheme makes it easy to understand the instructions its easy for younger lego enthusiasts to build the model building in progress chassis of the truck is really sturdy drivers seat is on the left i wish we had a real seat instead of a modified tile working drum mechanism you can turn the cement drum from a handle on the front right nice details on the front rearview mirrors are great i love the snot front panel too control panel on the left cement hose hardly fits its place and the hose is too thick dont forget the shovel snot technique is used on the back panel as well long  wide truck with 8 wheels i love the 6studwide design of new town series cement drum actually works if you place a couple of 1x1 plates in the drum and turn the handle it pours out the little cement parts man at work all this hard work gave me wrinkles on my face  folder when public brickshelf rating figures 610 nothing special with the figure but what did i expect at least we have a face expression parts 610 standart parts for a truck but the big blue drum is new price 810 very nice and detailed truck for 15 usd design 910 it really does look great doesnt it building 810 easy to build and its fun with a little use of snot total 3750 its a must for every town but other players should find it attractive as well conclusion i occasionally order town sets but i felt a great urge to build this when i first saw it on brickshelf when it was released i ordered it right away ten days later i was amazed looking at this beauty by my table we didnt have a cement mixer for ages and im sure every town builder will have this set and i have no doubt nontown enthusiasts like me will consider getting this links brickset reviews bricklink entry peeron inventory	neutral
thanks for the great review this is one of my favorite city kits from 2007 i think its a lot better than the cement mixer from the classic town theme  and it has some cool pieces too	positive
i voted outstanding because i think this is the best cement mixer tlg ever made also love the 6stud wide based vehicles as you mentioned i both bought and sold it again this year and i already regret it but i had to sell some stuff because of a loss of space	positive
lovely review really but the sad fact is weve seen it before twice httpwwweurobrickshowtopic20293	positive
a great review of a very good set i must echo kimt though i seem to be doing it an awful lot it would be improved by the addition of one more fig to the set as it’s the same price band as last years catapult	positive
ive skipped a few lunches on behalf of this set its a great army builder but so are many of the new castle sets what makes this great in my opinion is the figs  2 orcs and 1 dwarf  what else could one want thanks tlg for making this set and thank you for reviewing it for us review added to the index	positive
nice review i just recently purchased it for our future son and had to break into to it to get a first hand account of the merchandise i am not that big into the castle themebeing a citytown person myself but i must say that this set is awsome	positive

indexed going through the boards i was amazed to find out that no one ever attempted to review one of the best lego classics the 6399 airport shuttle while i was studying for exams a few weeks back i decided to take a break built the monorail and take some pictures of it resulting in the present review along with this i made my first ever poll here we go first some data setnumber 6399 setname airport shuttle released in 1990 in holland though bricklink says 1991 number of parts 731 number of figs 9 price unknown prices on bricklink vary from 261 up to 2300  but this was an expensive set even in the nineties the box mine is a bit battered by the owner before me but theres still plenty to see this is one of the largest boxes i have look at the minifig in the downright corner for the comparision and it is a really neat storing facility for many sets the box shows the set and in the background the silhouet of the set that is to accompany this one the airport from 1990 i like the angle of the box showing the two stations track and train in one picture the back of the box shows some really nice ideas for other setups why oh why has lego abandonned this kind of showing whats possible with one set inside flap of the box showing details of the set and the functions detail on the front of the box displaying the dimensions it really is a huge track layout for one set the instructions there is a nice little booklet showing the same picture as the box art with the figures lined up underneath the last page nicely folds out to show the entire setup of the tracks the figures a brilliant selection of minifigs including airport people and a cook all figures that are supposed to go on the shuttle carry a ticket and there are also some suitcases tickets fit inside of course station  1 the set includes two stations here is the first depicting the airport there are lots of details a phonebooth two seats some flowers a map luggagelockers and of course the streetlights a detailed shot of the station showing the luggagelockers and ticketvalidating machine part of the beauty of this set is the fact that it is so extremely detailed just look at the signs to show where to go next stickers and the scenery opposite the street the station has the same shape as the airport shuttle logo how sweet is that the station pictured as part of the layout the stations ends are made with airplane wings to smoothen the arrival of the shuttle station  2 here is the second station my personal favorite an elevated stop with a little snackbar underneath and stairs leading to the platform some chairs and streetlights here as well plus two old fashioned trees the part of the set that can be used in any layout the snackbar with hamburger sign sticker yes those hamburgers look tasty indeed also notice the lights hanging from the platform overhead and the ticketvalidating machine at the bottom of the stairs here we have the platform with information panels and seats also notice the two trafficlights for the train heres how it works the train will travel in the direction the arrow is pointing when turning the knob the two grey blocks will move towards or away from the trackcenter activating a button on the centerpiece of the train the motor which makes the train start its journey around the track there is only one speed and the train can only be put to a stop or change direction at stations the station as part of the layout the shuttle now on with the train there are two carrriages connected to a centered motor the power is provided by means of a batterybox containing a 9v battery the batterybox is in one of the carriages and displays airport shuttle a total of five passengers can be seated inside leaving room for their luggage and two drivers the front carriage with the button for the batterybox showing the underside showing the gearwheel metal that brings the power from the motor onto the geared track the black pointy things alongside the gearwheel react with the direction knobs at stations this is how the shuttle negociates with height differences everything hinges and rotates making the shuttle capable of performing steep climbs the motor is powerful enough to not slow down at such a climb detailed shot showing the first set of covered wheels in hinged position the shuttle on the layout the full layout this layout is quite huge involving lots of track pieces ramps ten large stanchionpoles and the two stations to show the movement of the shuttle i have made a 20 second movie which can be seen in my brickshelf gallery of this set conclusion well to conclude the review some final thoughts this truly is one of the more detailed sets around at least from the nineties and one of the largest in dimensions the monorail system is cleverly thought out and works excellent track extensions are hard to get however and very expensive nowdays especially the switchpoints and long straight track pieces the tracks included with this set will provide you with hours of fun though because there are a lot of them it can be quite hard to incorporate the monorail in your town without having a clearlybasedonthemonorailalone town i tried to incorporate it some years ago link here posing a real challenge the ratings price 810 this is an expensive set if you can get it for under 200 get it this set is rare in any condition parts 1010 lots of rare pieces cool minifigs 9v system roadplates lots of minifigseats en red trainwindows originality 1010 there are very few monorails released this one being the only town set compatibility 810 can be a bit hard to incorporate in a town but hey you got the monorail so no complaining here total 3640 i can only reccommend this set to anyone it is my personal favorite set upto this present time if there are any questions ask them all comments are welcome of course	positive
you chose the perfect set for your first poll simon no question this set is one of the alltimebeauties i rated outstanding of course i never hat the chance to get a complete copy of this set but i do own the engine and quite a bunch of monorail tracks your very detailed review made me think of getting the whole set some day thank you very much for this i never realized there were so many details included to this set the snackbar and the telephone cell and all the other nice things really strange for a nineties set which often lacked details the only thing that comes to my mind right now is that the engine looks quite blocky if the set was released today tlc would use more of those parts which make a better design imo and it would fit better to the curved walls of the stations as well wishful thinkinghow much would i love to see the monorail system back again wishful thinking i had to lough when reading your comment on the minifig seats dont you own many of those i dont know where to put mine	positive
best set ever i got my copy years ago from a guy on the old rectoyslego newsgroup anybody here still remember that newsgroup i traded him a guarded inn a black falcons fortress and a couple other small castle sets for it no regrets on that trade it is hard to incorporate a monorail into a town especially if you have a bunch of trains too i ended up making my entire monorail system elevated theres just no easy way to make a monorail  road crossing i also gave up on having it run in a loop instead it runs back and forth between two endpoints	positive
an excellent review of one of the jewels in the crown of the lego town range to answer one of your question i think the lack of people owning this set is one of the reasons that its yet to have a review personally i’ve only seen this set in the flesh once in my life when i was a child just before it was withdrawn from sale it is a lovely set well made and well produced though i think there is a flaw and that’s when the passages get of the other end of their train ride what picks them up a bus set for the airport would have been a good addition apart from that i can’t really fault it and that fact it comes with three female minifigs is just stellar as for incorporation keeping it elevated seems the most sensible suggestion i’ve always thought it i have it and wanted to integrate the set to a town to use it in the style of the dlr in london but that’s just a thought	positive
thanks for that splendid review simonwillems i clicked on outstanding of course i also like those little details especially the ticket validating machines youre very fortunate to own this wonderful set i hope you have an airport to go with it edit and bricklink is wrong giving 1991 as the release date youre right it was 1990 edited by legotrainfan 05 september 2008  0657 pm	positive

an aweome review of an outstanding set	positive
this remains the definitive city set in my eyes i never managed to get one but from the instructions it seems to be perfect in just about every way i got the two space monorails a while ago but the much higher prices on this one have kept it out my reach this set is a lot bigger than either of those though i always liked the monorail system a bit better than the trains because you could easily incorporate height into the tracks and spread them out in all three dimensions quote edit and bricklink is wrong giving 1991 as the release date youre right it was 1990 it was apparently released in 1990 in europe and 1991 in north america going by some us and german catalogs i have from that time period edited by cp5670 06 september 2008  0606 am	positive

gasp blasphemy someone voted this set below average brings out hunting rifle ahem back on topic i remember wanting this set badly for years and i still want it just no as much because its expensive and as this review proves takes up a lot of room ive already got my trains to think about and i wont be getting this set anytime soon i also have a faint memory of this set being featured in one of legos advertisements more specifically someone narrowly missing it hitches a ride races the monorail to the airport and catches the plane i am yet to find it on the net as old lego adverts are hard to come by especially the european ones now to more important matters starts hunting edited by freddie 07 september 2008  1003 pm	positive

indexed name refuse collection truck set no 6693 theme lego system  town year 1987 pieces 103 minifigs 2 price unknown special parts 4215ap08 yellow panel 1 x 4 x 3 with recycling pattern just occurs in this set 2x 4598 red bracket 2 x 3  2 x 2 occurs only in this set and only one other set this truck was introduced in the same year that lego came up with the garbage bins that of course also appear in this set have you ever wondered why most of the time the streets of lego city are so clean and neat no litter no garbage everywhere no chewinggum on the streets even with so many different inhabitants it seems to always stay that way however the older afols amongst us have experienced totally different situations rubbish everywhere smelly and dirty looking pavements minifigs that were losing their standard grin that is why lego came out with this magnificent truck back in 1987 before that people needed to put there garbage in bags or maybe barrels from that year on every miniman and miniwoman is happily using a trash bin the minifig civil servants never seem to become tired and the garbage truck comes every other day to collect the rubbish and keep the city clean the secret behind the clean lego city and the always happy standard grin of our minifolks are the antilitter warriors that use their powerful machines and handy tools to just get the job done so if you dont own a garbage truck better try to get one before your standard grins also fade and your streets become as dirty as naples where the garbage collectors recently had a strike for quite some time an overview of the set including instructions actually one is included in the set unfortunately i afraid we dont have any boxes of this set left another image of the lego items in the set it shows the truck two civil servants to perform the waste collection duties two garbage bins and a broom and shovel the two chaps that always seem to smile even when the litter that they collect really stinks the accessories that accompany the set a broom and a shovel to help cleaning up in case a dustbin tips over a very nice feature of the set is that the elevator at the back can be lifted in more or less the same way that real garbage trucks do as you can see here the dustbin is emptied through a red train window it seems to be that the hinges of my version will need some revision panels inside the back of the truck maximize waste capacity for this 4 stud wide truck it is nice that the designers added this simple red round brick on a clip presumably it should depict cylinders to let the back compartment tip for emptying or otherwise it might be gastanks again the complete set it is very complete set but some additions could make it even more playable  garbage eg a green flower bottom or some round plates 1 x 1  a place for the second worker to position himself on when the trucks needs to drive to the dumpsite or an other street and also vertical bars for that second worker to hold himself by this is what the truck will look like when dumping the litter at the recycle plant or dump site the whole back nicely tilts so that all the litter will fall out of the truck a view on the back of the truck quite a small but yet effective opening the front of the truck only one seat for just the driver but i personally prefer that to a 6 wide truck that fills the total width of the streets and has problems with corners of course set 7991 the orange garbage truck of last year is also nice we also own some of those but we never put them in our lego town since they take too much room and the color scheme of 6693 is also more preferable to us the two panels with the printed recycling pattern are a bit worn so we might recreate the recycle logo and put it on a sticker some day playability 810 like i mentioned it is too bad that the set doesnt have any litter however lego also saw that and has put litter in the 6693 set design 910 a really nice truck with two minifigs and very nice details price 10 i was not able to get any price information at bricklink one can still obtain a 2nd hand one for about 25 overall 810 a set that should be entitled a classic in the same list as the pizza restaurants the 7750 and the blacksmith shop that was all the pictures i was allowed to take since it seems that those brave man still have quite some trash cans to empty thanks guys for doing the dirty work so our minifigs stay happy and our streets stay clean peeron lugnet brickset bricklink entries additional notes on the review my brother has always been keen on garbage trucks however when he became aware of this truck it wasnt available in the stores anymore newer sets that had the recycling theme we not that good they didnt have the emptying mechanism so after our dark ages one of the first sets we bought were some of those nice refuse collection trucks although the new orange truck has the desired mechanisms and thankfully is a decent garbage truck we more like 4 wide trucks than 6 studs wide trucks so for the years to come our lego town inhabitants will still be seeing this great truck to control their waste problems	positive
it would be cool to see a review comparing this set with the newer orange garbage truck	neutral
definitely the best garbage truck ever the color scheme is great and the design is awesome outstanding without a doubt i must have it sometime	positive
this truck is simply beautiful its on my brickset wanted list i love the colour scheme red and yellow are the right choice for this vehicle the back part of the truck can be opened so it can discharge the rubbish like real garbage trucks youve also mentioned that in your review and i find it a wonderful detail thanks for the review jopiek	positive
tenorikuma on sep 7 2008 0830 am said it would be cool to see a review comparing this set with the newer orange garbage truck well i might want to do that but then in a different way as the railroad maintenance i will then review the orange one and make comments on it compared to this one	neutral
yeah its very nice along with all the older sets ive got the cement mixer that was released around about the same time as this	positive
thanks for the review like many such town sets i would characterise it as cute contrasting it to the new bin lorry its nice that this set has two minfigs more realistic and two bins those bins are a great addition to lego although wheelie bins would be nice now need some kind of 2x2 container you can clip a plate onto as a hinging lid and clip miniwheels under the back two studs having two minifigs is a superior point for this earlier lego rendition of a bin lorry in fact even though our bins are now emptied by a private company rather than the local council as was the case up till the mid 90s and of course for the last two decades there have been wheeliebins bin lorries have three guys  the driver and two collectors however our bin collectors for sure dont use a broom or shovel indeed on occasion theyve befouled the street themselves if something goes wrong with hoisting the bin on the mechanism the shape of the lorry in the set is still quite accurate pretty good for a fourwide vehicle i must admit to preferring the newer vehicles	positive
tenorikuma on sep 7 2008 0830 am said it would be cool to see a review comparing this set with the newer orange garbage truck true woold be good for the people that have few new city sets like me and your review is good btw i own this set however because it was really cool those days nowadays all trucks nd cars can do neat things but that wasnt so back then	positive
greetings just looking through the review index when i came across this one i recently acquired this set through ebay which came with a practically perfect box and instructions i would almost say that no one played with it much as all of the parts were brand new anyway i just wanted to say that this is a great set that was worth the 1499	positive
great to find this review of a classic set and its far better than any yuk set from 1997 omg what were they thinking  i prefer the six wide for trucks but for the 80s it was perfect and even today still holds its own 	positive
great review and i love the soft yellow effect to the pics imo the most recent garbage truck shouldve used the same piece for lifting the cans into the big bin instead of the droid arms	positive
6206 tie interceptor number of pieces 212 number of minifigs 1 price 1999 usd 1799 eur theme star wars episode vi year released 2006 brickset folder bricklink catalog welcome to my ninth review the boards todays review is the long awaited tie interceptor but does it live up to expectations well lets find out i believe this is the first and only time tlg made this set so lets begin the review the box the box is standard for its time with silver font the background on the front has some planets and the death star ii clarifying that this set is from episode vi overview this set comes with the interceptor model and one fig the interceptor has a very sleek futuristic design with four wings and a ballshaped cockpit the tie interceptor is a stealthy speedy vehicle in the imperial fleet it is used for scouting missions and not meant for attacking due to its weak structure and low arsenal front this version of the tie group is very attractive and coollooking it has an aerodynamic shape giving it looks and speed while not accurate to the movies grey and black colored ties the blue in place of the grey is just fine and does not alter the coolness of the design thankfully there are no stickers in this set cockpit here you can see the ballshaped cockpit be very very careful when opening it its very flimsy and breaks off almost every time fortunately both the windshield and the dish on top are printed and not stickers please dont mind the dust cockpit interior this is the inside of the cockpit it is very roomy airtight and one of the few cockpits in sw sets that are this good it makes up for lack of detail by giving the pilot plenty of room so you should have no trouble there it is also very smooth in the back and where the windshield folds down this is by far the best sw cockpit i have ever seen done by tlg good job the only bad thing is the two tan bricks that clash with the rest of the color wing attachment this is how the wings are attached to the cockpit on each side unfortunately the design on this part is not so good and sometimes the wings break off plus this part is very blocky and there is a big juniorized piece on the base of the wings wings here is what each wing looks like there are three parts on each wing a middle and two fins the wings are very aerodynamic with a diamondlike design note the imperial insignias and the blue tiles lining the wings wing attachments contd here again you see how the middle wing part is attached to the base juniorized piece and the fins attached to the base by hinges the hinges allow the fins to fold in and out a bit but again this is very fragile and the fins often break off gun placements this is an example of four guns on the ship one on the tip of each fin the guns consist of a tile with a tenic tunnel hole on the bottom attached to a technic pin which is attached to a black bar a good design altogether back here you see the rear of the cockpit you can see why the opening mechanism is so flimsy the whole top and front is connected to the body only by a weak hinge system as seen in the picture also note the small transblue dish and the four transred studs minifigure finally here is the single figure that comes in this set a tie pilot it is an all black figure with a life support system decal on the front and a helmet with silver imperial insignias an overall good minifig with a different helmet mold than the stormtrooper or shadowtrooper well i suppose thats about all lets get to the final verdict build 610 a little difficult due the flimsiness of the ship but should only take the average builder no more than 30 minutes playability 710 its fun to fly around   but has no real functions swooshability 710 you can swoosh it around fairly well just be careful not to accidentally break it minifigs 810 a good fig although having only one leaves something more to be desired design 410 very very flimsy with the wings windshield and fins but good for display price 710 i think it was actually 30 usd when i got it but im not sure overall score 65 an average set very delicate so much that you can hardly pick it up but good for display the minifig is okay and having no stickers is good i would recommend this to a hardcore ot fan that wraps it all up please vote your opinion on this set in the poll and ill see you next review edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0310 am	neutral

name jetport fire squad set no 6440 theme lego system  town year 1991 pieces 84 minifigs 2 price usd 2750 which equals about eur 1926€ and gbp 1557£ introduction one of the sets that especially my cousin likes is this one one time at the dutch legoworld event we had three of those there with flashing lights and loud sirens trying to put out the fire that was caused by the crash of again some lego aircraft we never had this set before our drak ages and the sets probably came from ebay or so in my opinion the newest airport rescue is nice too but in the conclusion i will make some additional remarks about that just imagine what it would be like for your lego town if the pilot of one of your smaller planes just couldnt stop before the end of the runway here you see the disaster that happened some day in our town fortunately all passengers got out safely thanks to our brave fire fighters this magnificent truck was used to help putting out the fierce fire caused by the aviation gas from the small plane the set includes two firefighters in distinguishable airport uniforms in order to be able to safe the passengers and go for a quick intervention our brave firemen have an axe for each of them airtanks and a portable fire extinguisher here you see the truck on the right side the large spout on the roof really makes it a remarkable truck as you can see behind the red door there is space for the airtank of our brave firemen at the right there is also place for the small hand held extinguisher the left side of the truck has a water hose instead for a truck from 1991 there is quite some room inside actually both firemen fit inside unfortunately there is only one seat at the back there are two clips for the axes there you can also find the main switch for the light and sound system as you can see the red flashing lights do their job quite well the sirene is just behind the bar with the flashing lights the main spout just seems to begin emitting water the front of the truck for some reason there are two hidden spouts there as well what their purpose is seems unclear but they look nice kimt suggests that it is for foaming the runway and that is a real option of course this set can be found on peeron lugnet brickset bricklink entries playability 810 very nice set details that are movable and of course the light and sound design 810 nice sets with nice details but could have even been better seat for 2nd fireman missing no oxigen masks and only one airtank price 710 for a light and sound set and two firefighters the price is reasonable i would say overall 810 nice sets some details could even be better too bad that there is only a five to choose from a sticker when you have more than one truck last but not least an overview of the complete set including instructions fire mastered as the dutch firefighters will say when they have completed their job we have also bought the newer airport rescue truck 7891 however we think this 6440 one is much better the light and sound all the nice features and the nice details are much better than the new truck edited by jopiek 11 september 2008  1025 am	positive

jopiek on sep 8 2008 1224 am said thanks of course for the flattery but do you then from your profession understand what the purpose is of the front spouts that even can be hide since that puzzles me it can be that the lego designers thought it was a nice touch and didnt bothered about the realistic value of such a feature but i dont suppose that that is the case here somehow i had just noticed your reply to be honest with you the aes in my country does not have front spouts in their fire engine i do not remember seeing this feature before it is a possibility that this feature is included in some models or an imaginative addition from our lego designers i will need to check this out kimt on sep 9 2008 0316 pm said perhaps the front sprouses are for foaming the runway that is a logical answer	neutral

information name fire control center set no 4953  peeroncom theme lego legoland year 1991 pieces 516 minifigs 4 price usd 8500  gbp unknown  eur unknown bricklink search results brickset lugnet introduction this week i got the flu so since i have to stay home and get better i might as well make a review its one of the most amazing older city sets thus making it a really valuable review this is the story about four handsome firemen living in one of the most amazing city structures out there the 6389 fire control center the box i actually didnt remember the box to be that small borrowed from peeron the four hunky firemen oh jeah what women doesnt like a man in a uniform the manual even the manual is aging but then again its 17 years old review as you all know a city must have some standard civil services like a hospital and a police station a fire house also is a must for any lego city this particular fire house is one of the most amazing sets ever to be released in this cool set you get 4 minifigs all fire fighters two verhicles and a helicopter firefighters have to move around the futuristic fire truck is definately my favourite chiefs car the smallest verhicle of the set its a small allterrain jeep for the fire chief pretty much a standard car in those days a real simple layout and a trunk which holds a small fire hose its lucky to be in this set because it complements the whole thing the car luckily its red and it has de cool signs on the side helicopter another great addition to the whole set is the helicopter again in a basic setup for that kind of verhicle at the time this one has the nice addition of two hoses to put out the fires raging in lego city the chopper no it doesnt really fly really cool fire truck thingy this fire truck is definately the best of the verhicles in this set its actually a futuristic model of fire trucks i havent seen any other fire truck like this i saw a police truck like it though but were talking fire fighters right actually the whole thing han open up to reveal a number of fire fighting appliances such as a hose a computer and a oxygen tank the fire truck click for bigger version the main building actually looks kinda empty when the trucks and chopper are gone however this still is realistic compared to a real fire house also the front has those amazing sliding doors which make this thing really look cool and clean off to fight a fire main structure with the slinding doors pulled down actually those sliding doors are also the hard part of the model since all the bricks must be perfectly aligned or else the doors will stutter but if youre a little familiar with lego then you dont need to worry from the back enough room to play with im going to give my perspectives on each of the sides on the left we have the garage for the bigger fire truck the only real flaw about this set is that this garage isnt long enough for the fire truck this could have been solved by making it two or three studs longer notice the cool sunroof in the middle we have the chiefs office complete with coffee machine a diversity of computers and a tape recorder most likely to tape any incoming calls a lot of details are crammed up in there just like in the rest of the set to the right is the helicopter platform i really like the greyblueyellow of the platform because it doesnt look so red anymore dont get me wrong red is a cool color but not too much red and the helicopter actually fits and stays in place during playtime the baseplate filled up this picture says it all again the four lego hunks are greeting all the ladies the minifigs are from a classic series this happens with more of my lego sets bottom line is that this set is one of the best fire houses lego created verdict the build is pretty easy but takes a while to really see where you are with your building its nice to have a hospital from the same era this create a more uniform look to your city once you completed the model your baseplate is pretty filled up but still has a lot of opportunities playability 1010 cool trucks a chopper and sliding doors nuff said design 910 insanely good design price 1010 couldnt get better than this overall 9610 with a score like that one can only say get one now time to go home the trucks and chopper back on their rightful spots	positive

found this set on a flea market in munich yesterday just 25 years after its release the instructions for a total of five models two of them printed the other 3 are just photo instructions in the book it still has the box in good shape despite some wear from the age sadly five little pieces were missing and 5 wrong pieces inside instead 2 complete wheels and a classic 80s90s plane wing dumped into my bricks but i was able to replace the missing minifig torch and the 4 missing plates with identical pieces from my collection the box and contents the set still has the original box inside the pieces plastic insert instructions and a 1987 technic catalogue imagine that set livespan today four years and the 8841 is still in the catalogue classic technic design from early 80s showing a function drawing of the steering and the main model a small set but with a flap shoeing the contents all pieces in the inner box and the papers included 5th model soapbox racer this is more or less a soapbox racer with working steering but no engine its got a rather blocky design but still looks sleek enough and is a simple build little over 100 pcs out of 180 the soapbox at step 2 just included the steering at step 6 completed and ready to race downhill total 710 simple but effective 4th model simple chassis very simple and boring alternate using just 13 of the 180 pieces in the set it even hasnt got a seat construction its just a plain steering mechanism attached on wheels with a spartan chassis of just a few pieces this is the whole model at step 5 just attach the steering mechanism and wheels and youre done total the worst alternate model of the complete set just a boring 410 3rd model balance very original small model its a small model of a working classic balance and it works with small parts laid on the scales altough theyve got just a 4x4 footprint its a fast build just 15 minutes and youve done it the model as it looks at step 3 finished easy build with just 63pcs out of 180 total very original model it actually works with small weights but a very simple build still a 710 alternate model tractor with equipment this is the second model its a simple but boxy design featuring a harrow and a plough the tractor has a similar design to the very first tractor set but much smaller the plough is about 24wide and the harrow is completely snotted even back in 1983 has two functions working steering and the coupler for the equipment uses almost all pieces of the set the tractor at step 8 the steering isnt completely attached now this is the completed tractor the complete harrow finished alternate with the plough attached total nice but quite ugly and boxy design for a tractor with 4 wheels of the same size takes me to a 610 main model desert racer this is the main model with a nice for early 80s but boxy design it has two functions steering and a working 1cylinder rear engine which is of the old 2x2 piston type since the small piston design wasnt invented back then this is the only model of the set which has piece callouts in the instructions the printed alternate model has no callouts they werent invented on both models back in 1983 the three smaller photo instruction alternates have a piece callout at the beginning showing all needed pieces the seat is a nice but blocky design and use a primitive snot technique this is the model at step five the piston is already attached imagine this state on step 5 in modern sets back then lego had challenging instructions not the step madness like today this is the engine just made of plates with a hole in the middle for the piston step 9 the piston engine is completed on step 12 the roll bar and the seat are installed only the steering isnt completed yet front view of the finished model just 15 steps needed back then birds eye view of the whole set displayed on the box model verdict nice design especially the colorful seat in snot technique but quite boxy especially the engine since there were only the huge pistons still a 910 set verdict design and models 710 very boxy designs due to the age the chassis alternate sucks build 910 classic 80s technic building quite challenging but fun sturdyness 710 rear section damaged after the table fall but rather easily fixed fun 910 blast from the past overall 810 mfg widdi edited by widdi 07 september 2008  0411 pm	positive
nice classic set are those hoses around the engine pneumatic tubes that technic catalog looks interesting too i have the catalogs for the next several years but not that one quote this is the model at step five the piston is already attached imagine this state on step 5 in modern sets back then lego had challenging instructions not the step madness like today the most extreme example of this was the engine step in the 8865 set which uses over 120 pieces by itself	neutral

name electric passenger train set no 7725 theme lego  system  trains  12v  train set year 1981 pieces 485 minifigs 1 price usd 7000 which equals about eur 50€ and gbp 40£ introduction our most favorite theme is 12v trains actually i got my first 77series back in 1981 5th of december i was 25 years old just a week before my brother was born some years later i got the 7740 after our dark ages we my brother cousin and myself got all 12v trains at least once this 7725 was gathering dust in my brothers room the train in all its splendor as you can see it doesnt occur at the back of the 12v era train instructions although its larger brother the 7740 does some investigation learned that all the sets at the back of the instructions date from 1980 so the 7725 wasnt released yet here you can see the front of the 7725 with the driver in the cockpit the driver is in fact the only minifig that was included in the set as you can see our version of the train has a different front than the one in the instructions apparently the former owner used 7861 lighting set 12 v to upgrade the train with working back and frontlights i like the original lights but didnt notice that the train had those double lights until i did the review maybe we will give the train again its original signs and put custom leds in it or so so that the train can drive into two directions with accurately working lights another thing about the lights that puzzle me are the backlights while typing this i realise that the former owner might have added those so lets have a look at the instructions then as it turns out the lights are there also in the instructions i recently learned that only the last car or coach of a train has its red lights on so unless the train drives with only the front car it will never use those red backlights here you can see the cockpit with the engineer the cables dont look very pretty but well the train at least has working light here you can take a look at the inside of the engine car while the 7745 has a nice fake engine there just the weight bricks and the ugly cables apart from the engineer and his cockpit no other nice features here btw lego always used tiles in such a trains to make it easier for kids to take off the roof and have access to the minifig passengers etc here the proof that it is an electric train the pantograph of the front car it has the same kind of panthographs that the 7745 has the middle car has 4 chairs as you can see some vandal must have nocked over this one hope they leave the cables alone this early morning train seems to have one passenger a workman i like the small 2x3 windows from this car very much they give this care a nice look also the door in the middle adds something special to the train as far as i know no other passenger train has the doors in the middle here you see the side of the train just after the train has left brickingham station where the worker probably from set 6647 highway repair that was also released in 1980 a closeup of the last car with steering stand to allow the train to travel back and forth without having to make head in other words putting the engine in front again the train shunted to an end track so it can be cleaned i think it is apparent that it definitely needs cleaning very badly this set can be found on peeron lugnet brickset bricklink entries playability 510 the train is fine but with only one minifig not very playable without other sets also no accessories at all design 710 nice train the inside could have been a lot better but i really like to original front lights price 710 the train came with motor so not a bad price goes now for quite some money at ebay overall 6510 nice set but the 7745 is a better train im sure well that was it for today i hope you have enjoyed this review and got tears in your eyes seeing how nice the 12v era was it never comes back but maybe lego rereleases some of this sets in the 2009 train era very likely that this is just wishful thinking edited by jopiek 12 september 2008  0456 pm	neutral
freddie on sep 7 2008 1152 pm said a very nice review jopiek you know i was wondering how lego could justify having two 12vpowered passenger trains at the same time but after reading the review and seeing the lack of figures and accessories i guess i understand why plus the train is rather compact oh and i cant help but think that the chairs in the middle carriage are somewhat oddly placed because those placed next to the door are unusable because the door takes up room needed for figs arms also it appears that your set also has the newer couplers ie theres no hooks for the decoupling rail to grab hold of with the light assembly it really wont matter playwise or if you dont have any decouplers but its still a bit of a bummer the chair was just loose so it should be placed on the 2x2 plate that is also visible in the picture of the middle car btw the front magnet is the old type i have some decouplers but we dont use them because they are not really that reliable lego just release a whole line of trains at the same time i just discussed with my parents and they told be lego had those sets longer in store back then i must have gotten the 7745 somewhere in 1983 or even 1984 although it was released in 1981 i started of with the 7710 push along train and then upgraded the tracks with current rails when i got the 7745	positive
a nice old classic the driver has a nice hat and torso and the train is well designed except for that thing on the roof	positive
jopiek on sep 7 2008 1120 pm said the chair was just loose so it should be placed on the 2x2 plate that is also visible in the picture of the middle car thats not the one i was thinking of it was the other two chairs towards the middle of the wagon that i was thinking of if you try to seat a minifig in either of them youll quickly find that its impossible beacuse the door interferes with the figs required personal space if you move both of them one stud forward so that the back of the seat lines up with the edge of the window itll solve the problem and still leave space for a figs to be seated in the other chairs	neutral
giorgio on sep 8 2008 1123 am said the 7745 was realsed in 1985  lego had 2 12v passengers trains between 1981 and 1984 the 7740  7725 during the 80s the avergae life of a train was about 5 years freddie yups now i see what you mean i checked the instructions and indeed the chairs are in the wrong place whoops you are totally right i meant 7740 instead of 7745 fixed it edited by jopiek 08 september 2008  0500 pm	neutral
a set from the golden age of lego it brings back a lot childhood memories seeing this review i was 5 and just starting to play with lego around that time i could look for hours the lego catalogs dreaming of sets like this one thanks for this wonderful review	positive
the best 12v legotrain is for me the 7740 the 7725 is still a goodlooking train and the only one with short wagons in a electric version before i started to with bricklink i started to build this train in blue ive build 4 trains of it and sold 2 of them still one for sale  you can also build this in other colors like a yellow one or you can build a black version which i made a death train of it driven by a skeleton  edited by panda9001100 17 may 2009  0801 am	positive

beach cruisers set  6445 theme island xtreme stunts year released 2002 piece count 97 minifigs 2 list price 7 usd during a trip to legoland california in 2002 their big store had a neat little display of some new sets and themes including island xtreme stunts the new theme offered great colors including orange tan and light blue which immediately caught my eye the theme focussed on island fun with some adventure and included some great figs like the brickster i had to buy at least one set choosing truck  stunts trike review coming soon at the time the theme was short lived and many of the sets were on sale at discount toy stores not too long after their initial release i picked up this set 6445 beach cruisers for 333 usd which will be my first of three island xtreme stunt reviews starting with the box a race between the street surfer and skate boarder the back shows some alternate models including a sail boat and jet ski same image on the instructions as the box but the backside shows the island xtreme stunts video game for different platforms the set includes a small decal sheet for the skateboard i love the two figs included within this set one is a hippietype with shades and leafed muscle short and the other pizza boy skateboarder check out the pizza boy on his skateboard two green brackets are included for attaching each fig to the long grey bar using this piece one can make the skateboarder do tricks and flips the street surfer vehicle is pretty nice to the sail is placed on a black bar and lance then attached to the vehicle heres a picture of the vehicle to me it has that old soap box derby look to it  like something kids would create to race down a hill the vehicle doesnt have a steering wheel but rather two levers which i think work well in the cockpit heres the underside the set has three neon orange wheels that attach to technic axle pins to attach to the vehicle lastly the entire set with a few extra pieces final thoughts while island xtreme stunts is not the best citytown subtheme esp for the traditional lego classic town fan it does have some fun sets like this little beach cruiser good figs a skateboard and a very rollable fun word equivalent to swooshable but for vehicles with wheels vehicle you can even blow on the sail to get it to roll across the floor this set is a lot of fun	neutral

like whitefang i too only remember this line in computer game form i used to love that game i actually have never seen a review for an xtreme stunts set so this was nice to see as for the set i think it looks pretty good i really like the hippie guy the windboard thing is nice as well but looks a bit strange somehow i give this set a solid 3 out of 5 thanks for the nice review edited by erdbeereis1 08 september 2008  0405 am	positive
nice review i got this set not long after my ending of the dark ages it was even then already on slae for just 5 euro i like the figs and the vehicles it were some of my first orange pieces the hippie guy is called  snap lockit and the pizza guy is called  pepper roni i think the legodesigners had a cosy evening with much beer when they thought about the names i think this line was the only line which was made first as computergame and after that as a real line instead of the other computergames based on already existing lines	neutral

her name was sky lane its quite sad though to actually play the gamethe xtreme tower is the only set that made it into the game itself and it was a really watered down version of the information center from the first two games but the island was in the game filled with incredible buildings that would have made really cool sets	negative

it is not very often that i rate a legoset poor its the first time actually but in this case i had no other option the idea of this set is good and i like the mostly yellow minifig but the design of both the airplane weird windowpiece a propellor that is way too small minimal skies underneath and a strange colourscheme and the hangglider two handlebars on the wings too many colours makes the set mark the essence of legos downfall during those years i really appreciate the fact that you made a review of this set brickster it made me look into the details of 6735 but i am just as sure today as i was back then i will never buy this anyway thanks for the review the quality of the set may be a disapointment your review certainly is not	negative
hello all eurobricks members and town lovers today i will be doing up a review on glade runner set this is a very small set which is slightly bigger than the current impulse set its part of the race theme which involved in land and sea racers back in the early 1990s i just love these orignal race themes which is produced back then name glade runner theme lego system  town  race year 1993 pieces 29 minifigs 1 price usd325 an image of a 6513 glade runner swamp race shall begins this glade runner is pretty nice looking with its sleek sports look well for a glade runner in the water it certainly looks much impressive somehow i felt that the 6513 is aligned with the 6514 trail ranger i always had that perception that both vehicles are brothers and was released under the same year in fact glade runner was released in 1993 based on peeron information i always felt that this set is used for investigators or police to used for tracking or search purposes in the swamp areas instead of using it for a race i will place this set in the jungle somewhere like bricksters jungle settings although it looks too bright for such serious agenda but i think its pretty useful to use it this way they can rent it from the nearby shop and used it to search it kind of reminded me of the movie us marshals which acted by tommy lee jones and wesley snipes meet the ace please pardon his trousers i did not bleach it earlier it was caused overtime without adequate caring to the minfig look at this great article on how to protect your lego the driver wears a green vest with patch pockets on both sides this is my favourite design during that period it comes with a yellow lifevest too as for the 1x4 printed tile with 3 stars shining in front of the runner its a very nice printed tile that can be used for other racing purposes in other sets as well overall design the built is very simple and yet so realistic making use of the aeroplane tailhead to add as the holder for the rotor is smart the white bricks acting as a platform for both sides to hold the driver to sit onto the centre with the steering wheel at the front i am very happy with this design place the glade runner in front of the fan with a reasonable fan speed you will see the rotor runs like a charm different angles of the vehicle close encounter with the swamp sharks coined by brickster see you later to conclude this is a very nice little set that can provide much fun i dont really used it to race in the waters instead i leave it to my imagination and used it for police investigation purposes such as air crash excerise search and rescue operations and etc i think it can provides quite a fun loving experience although the set might not be very appealing to some people but i find it very fun to play around and is one of my favourite sets in the 1990s where i placed it with my 6514 trail ranger together summary review playability 8510 i leave it to your imagnination design 910 very simple yet realistic design price 1010 a very inexpensive set great way to buy such small sets at a low price overall 8510 glade runner is not common in town and city theme its not a must to have it but if you ever come across it do get it i gave it a 4 based on my review score card what about yours hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated	positive

nice review white fang this really reminds me of an allamerican set with its red white and blue colors and the white stars although i really like the fig with its scruffy bearded face i find the green torso a bit odd for this set i suppose i would expect some sort of redblue racer fig with a whiteblue racing helmet swamp sharks  too funny  you always add a nice addition of humor to your reviews now im going to check out some wonder woman clips on youtube	positive

what would we do without the trucks of legoland to clean up our town well i didnt want to find out so i bought this set straight away 7991 recycle truck set info set name 7991 recycle truck released 2007 theme city price usd 1499gbp 1299eur 1495 pieces 206 minifigs 1 review time leading off the box the front shows the recycle man loading up the trash can one thing here is really bizarre on lego sh and everywhere else it says that this set is called recycle truck which makes sense as it has a recycle logo on the truck however on my box it says the set is called garbage truck has this happened to anyone else or is it just me here is the back of the box which shows some of the things you can do with this set the bags with this set you get 3 bags which are numbered and do you see what i see yes thats right the dss is in a bag so it doesnt get bent why tlg doesnt do this more often is beyond me bag 1 the set comes with a very nice selection of pieces a large number of these are orange manual silly me i forgot to take a picture of the front of the manual the picture is the same as on the front of the box the back shows some of the 2007 city sets in a nice little scene and inside minifig here is the friendly garbagerecycle man he looks nice but with the same head as so many other city figs before him come on tlg give us some new heads the sticker sheet the stickers actually are pretty decent as far as stickers go i like the recycle sign after bag 1 this is where we stand after the first bag is built bag  2 the parts contained in the second bag more nice orange pieces here extra parts some nice 1x1 slopes and 1x1 round plates everything built now that everything is built lets check it out the design of the set is very nice and the color scheme looks great when you see it you immediately know what it is the back has a droid arm that acts as a handle to dump the trashrecycling in the truck its simple but works well here you can see the dumping mechanism it works by a sliding technic beam with a stopper on top of the truck you can store the workers cart this works really well i think though that the top of the truck overall looks a bit jumbled up with a few too many different colors the bottom trash dumping time this is a good feature of the set a very well built snot front section this looks fantastic with the grills and number plate sticker someone has left a big mess on the street brickshelf folder ratings price 1010 for 15 this is a very good deal at 206 pieces parts 910 lots of orange design 910 a very well designed set especially the front playability 910 the trash dumper is fun and the added broom and cart make for good play value build 810 simple but stayed interesting overall4550 brickset lego sh bricklink peeron taking out the trash summary this is a great small set for the price with fun features nice colors and good design i would certainly recommend this set no matter what its really called thanks and happy building	positive
this is one of those sets that make me really want to start building up a city its a great value has a lot of useful pieces and is just plain fun to play with i do miss vehicles having doors though great review i was a bit curious as to how the dumping mechanism worked as well as the sticker count	positive
nice truck indeed but the yellow one is better i think at least if you put them on a roadplate it seems to me that those road plates are too small for that also it will not empty completely because of that panel well for the rest it is a nice set and a fine review	positive
erdbeereis1 on sep 10 2008 0538 pm said actually it does the back part of the truck with the panel hinges up so that when you want the truck to dump it doesnt get in the way i should have taken a better look at the one my brother has  it still is a nice truck much better than all the strange sets that were release those dark ages before	positive
a good set with a nice color scheme i still prefer the last one that had a removable bin	positive
what a great set and a very nice review erdbeereis i think the only improvement to this set would have been the use of chrome exhaust pipes and front grill i bought this set with a lot of excitement but unfortunately have not put it together yet what are your thoughts on these larger 6stud wide detailed vehicles as opposed to 4stud wide classics heres an image of 6668 recycle truck released in 1992 ps i like the use of taking out sponge bob in your review	positive
this looks like a great set and im happy you were dumping spongebob he deserves that this set looks very nice and if i see it i will probably pick it up	positive

thanks for this review i really love this set its perfect for my town and brings a sense of classic when i see it	positive
hi i bought this set a while ago and have since remodeled it into a larger 8 wide truck now it can hold a driver and passenger its kind of boxy i may redesign it in the future	neutral
thats a really nice mod badsneaker the added bulk serves it well	positive
that looks like one of those big strange recycle trucks from new york city i like it	positive
i like this set but i cant give it a good grade for playability as the rearmost hinging section is too stiffly hinged so when you open it its likely to break if you hold it just over the shovel and broom my truck thus has that function and with it of course the whole container tipping disabled i also moved the cab a bit forward and the front axle rearward to give the cab the typical garbage truck look as they are often very low slung this also created space behind the cab for some equipment	negative
