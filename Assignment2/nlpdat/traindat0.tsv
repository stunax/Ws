306 Lunar Landing Plates Year Released: 1979 Piece Count: 2 Minifigs: 0 List Price: unknown As part of the Classic Space Collection, Lego offered two sets of moon plates. One was a set of two crater plates, and the other, this very useful Landing Plate set. Not much to review, but worth sharing a few images: The landing plate: And T-Plate: The two plates connect to form this very nice Classic Space landing platform: Set 497, Galaxy Explorer included the landing platform, but the one that I had was lighter in color than the one contained in this set (at least the yellow circle). Future Lego space sets could benefit by having similar road plates. Share your thoughts.	neutral
These are my only space base plates from Classic Space. Actually, with only 2 plates, I could not do much serious expansion with it. Instead, I merged it with my old city baseplates, and used it as a docking station for scientific purposes or restricted facilities that is guarded by the police. These baseplates are very useful and is suited for creating a space command center, up in the space.  	positive
These are pretty good, but I think they look too much like the standard town roads from that period. I like the black space plates from the early 90s better (6710).	negative

first, what i liked sooooo much was the cover of these plates, with this large picture of a classic space scene. I still have a '306' misb just to keep that nice feeling of taking it out of a plastic box, and look at it... there were different versions of the cover though. second, the markings of the landing platform changed at some point. i'd have to check it later when i'm at home, think it had something to do with the interupted yellow lines...	negative

I've used these plates to represent restricted areas, and even as simple airport runways, beyond their space uses. I never liked the black plates (they were during my dark ages anyway, so I've never really seen one up close), but I have seen them used in a Death Star display as suggested and it turned out fairly well.	neutral
These plates are great in setting up your space base and giving your ships a place to land. My favorite, though, is the lunar crater plate, which I use to death in my comic. :)	positive
Why pay $350 Dollars, just download the instructions on buy the pieces off Bricklink. This is was I did when I wanted to create the Blacktron II in the Futuron colour scheme. Also I tend to like both sets of base plates, I bought the black ones myself and they were of great use but there more for creating the idea of a city or space station, something more completely man made. The gray ones give a better look of the roads being laid over bare rock especially when you introduce the plates with the craters. I would love to see a 48*48 baseplate with roads through them which would allow more building space on the side and maybe some craters. Also 48*48 baseplates with craters but a few different kinds to create more or a realistic look and less of a repeating pattern. And with all those rocks you have to put everything up on supports, much better looking bases then.	negative
Quote Oh how I love these plates. Afew years ago I found a local retail store with about 6-7 sets of these in their basement warehouse I was given special access to (along with MANY other old space goodies.. hehe..) I love the things, I have loads, and I've used them for multiple space bases and battles. Along with afew grey crater plates and the large grey plates (1.5x the size of a normal baseplate) you can get quite a monorail layout going. *sigh* I should really clean up and get one set up again, so I can take some pictures! Wow, nice. You probably have enough to make that scene on the box picture. I got one pack off ebay a while ago and have another octagon plate from the Blacktron 6988 base. I'm building my carrier MOC around one but don't have anything planned for the others. These baseplates are still relatively common on ebay for their age. I see MISB packs on there every few weeks and they tend to sell for around $20. The older kind (in the OP) are much harder to come by. Edited by CP5670, 09 July 2008 - 10:18 PM.	neutral
I also love these plates! I build a lot with them (e.g. this ). Unfortunately they are not available in bley ...	neutral
Lokix, on Jul 11 2008, 03:00 PM, said: By looking at the pictures used to display this set I've a sneaky suspicion it did not come with instructions but meant for the pictures to be ideas. The whole set was suppose to teach children to use their imagination, giving them instructions would somewhat defeat this while trying to figure how to build things from looking at pictures would be a much better educational experience. But I don't wanna use my imagination!	neutral
Year Released: 1976 Piece Count: 53 Minifigs: 2 LEGO brought out floating boats quite early, and in many ways the first were the best. (I'll explain why later...) This set in particular is interesting as it came out in two versions; one that includes the first minifigs and another that included the non-armless type. (Set 709.) The police signs are stickers, and are in surprisingly good condition considering the age of the set. (I am missing one sticker on the front though.) Note the Technic Bush and Axel; they are the old type. The position of the second figure is not a mistake; I think he's supposed to be sitting down.... The first boats out by LEGO needed a weighted keel to prevent them.... keeling over. (I have tested this!) I suspect this is because of the density of the old hulls and the flat bottom... but I could be wrong. (It can't be just because of the flat bottom as the new cargo ship doesn't need one.) The keel in detail. The bottom extension is for a motor. (Not included, nor made by LEGO at the time.) The keel had longer studs. Even now it holds extra firmly. This is why I prefer the old design. You can extend or shorten the hulls as you please, or even insert other LEGO in the middle. You can easily add wheels or any other piece to the bottom of these hulls. I wish they would go back to this idea; the 4+ hulls were of this concept but were too wide. (Probably so the keel wasn't needed.) The old minifigs aside from having odd feet and no arms had a normal stud as the neck. Thus when you turn the head it tends to come off. I love this set!	negative

Nice review Sinner! The old sets... I donÂ´t know - every old set, especially equipped with the old non-moveable arms minifigs look very odd nowadays. I agree with you with the hull shape and its possibility to be extended, but every other aspect, the lack of detail, the keel itself (you canÂ´t float it in shallow water) keeps me from rating it higher than 3/10. In my opninion the best police boat so far is 4021 *click to enlarge*	negative
I love those minifigs, they'd go for alot on ebay I bet. Great boat as well, I love the old hull design.	positive
This set showed what potential variations on the standard brick had back then. I think that TLG was still finding its legs back then and learning new things so this is a solid set for the year it was released. Nice review Sinner.	positive

This set just isn't a good example, that's all. OH, and I also agree with you about that police boat. However, the newer one in the CITY line is also great, IMO. The only thing that weighs against it is the giant size, which makes it feel awkward in more classic towns. Edited by Grevious, 03 August 2008 - 06:30 PM.	negative

So, you've been bitten by the classic bug too, Sinner. Great review; but one would think arms would come in handy (pun intended) when you are a police officer, right? It's a shame that many of the original figs must now be forced to stand looking like they have their hands in their pockets, eh? I have no idea where I was going with that last sentence...	neutral
As you may have seen in my topic in general LEGO discussion, I received a bunch of old LEGO from my step-grandmother-in-law. Among the bricks were instructions and pieces for an almost complete set 345 from 1969. I was very excited to find this out, so I put it together. I recently took it apart and re-assembled it, taking photographs along the way for the sake of Eurobricks. So, without further ado, set 345: House With Car. First off is the car. This was still constructed in the bucket of bricks I received, so I never took it apart: Next I'll show you the instructions. Lots of added bricks per step, which was fun. However, the angle of the instructions sometimes made it difficult to find where things were supposed to go. The in-build shots. Finally, an all-around view of the finished set. Sadly, I don't have much time to post more pictures or thoughts. However, I'll try to come back and update the review later this week. Until then, enjoy!	positive
Nice review, 'Mariko'! This set is way past my time. The baseplate is okay (though I hate those dots). The car is pretty cool too...	positive
Great review. I never had this set, but it looks nice. I really like the checker pattern near the big window.	positive
Way before my time, too--in fact, this set came out twenty years before I was born! The baseplate doesn't actually have dots--I'm not sure if they were there once, and then rubbed off (a possibility, as the studs are rather smoother than I imagine they once were), or if this particular one didn't have the dots. This set also shows that the difficulty LEGO has in doing vehicle scale isn't new. The house is the perfect size for microfigures from the LEGO Games; however, the car is massive--over twice as tall as a microfig!	neutral
Image Link from Brickset I thought I would do a pic review of the 1st Lego Castle, The Yellow Castle, #375- released in 1978. First, let me say that this set was truly "ahead of it's time". It introduced new building concepts (such as the hinge and new figs (most were still the armless, faceless mini-figs during this time). This set introduced me to Castle which was my first real favorite theme. I enjoyed breaking it out from the garage and building it again. The majority of the pieces are 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 1x4, 1x6, and 1x8 standard yellow bricks. The set also includes yellow 1x4, 1x6x2, and 1x8x2 arches, yellow 2x2, 2x3, and 2x4 bricks, various grey plates, 1x2 black inverted slopes, red drawbridge pieces, two classic red castle doors, 8 hinges (2 for each corner), and a few other nifty pieces including six red 1x1 windows. A complete inventory is available at Peeron: 375 Inventory. A view from the front. The drawbridge is 6x8. The front tower stands 12 1/3 bricks high (plenty of room for horses). The drawbridge does work. The string (originally black) is attached to the opposite side between a plate and the arches. The right side of the castle (identical to the left). I've always loved the 2x2x3 sloped bricks (and corner pieces): The back. I love these red doors. A 1x4 brick attached to the other side of the baseplate keeps intruders out. That banner was the original sticker piece. Notice the wear. The rear tower, largest of the towers: And backside: Two hinges at each of the corners allow the corners to open for playability: Before opening: Open: Lots of arches add to the detail of the inner walls: Inner front: This set included 14 figs (how about that for quantity). Unfortunately, I peeled off worn stickers from the shields and the breast plates years ago. The blue castle guards and knights are the keepers of the castle. I still think that these helmets are the best Lego ever made. They just look good. The black and white knights: And the red knights: I've always prefered to use the black and red guards and flags from the knight's joust set(s): Conclusion The Yellow Castle is truly a classic set and I'm so glad I kept the pieces to this together after all these years. If you have a chance to buy one or even obtain the set instructions, it's worth building and wouldn't be difficult to substitute grey or other colors. I hope you enjoyed this review and feel free to share your comments.	positive
There's two alternates on the back of the instructions and as I recall, some sort of bridge on the inner fold or back of box. I threw away the box to this set years ago- just lucky to still have all the pieces. With standard pieces, you can build all these alternates and many more. That's why I don't particularly care for the new castles (like Vladek's). They make building so difficult and duplicate pieces are so limited. Here's an old shot of the castle in the city that it use to guard. We played for hours back in these days,	neutral
Great review. It is nice to see an in-depth photo review of this set. I especially love the last picture of your old city! It certainly does bring back memories...	positive

They do need to be re-sized. In US, I converted them to .59 inch width. You could do the same in cm by converting to 1.5 cm wide. I did the same with the torso stickers - same ratio. I ended up with a PowerPoint sheet of multiple shields and torso designs. Printed on sticker pages from a good quality photo-printer gives you very nice stickers. The hard part is cutting them. The results are the four knights pictured above. The web site also has Forestmen and custom torso and shield designs that are very nice.	neutral
I've tried this once. Remember? Normal white sticker sheet in an ink jet and the transparent plastic on top !! P.S. The one on the right is the homemade one!!	neutral
Here's a shot of a custom forestman. These really work well: I'm using just regular sticker paper. How do you stick transparent plastic on top?	neutral
i guess it's easiest to put the entire shield on a transparent sticker and cut the edges. i would also do that with the white stickers, because now you can still see the gray edges of the shield. Perhaps you can make a bigger black, or brown in the other case, outline. you also wouldn't be able to see if the sticker is exactly in the middle...	neutral
Quote so you're using two layers (stickers) doesn't that make it very thick? Not really. I think it works out very fine. 1. Print out the image. 2. Put on the Plastic. 3. Cut out the image. 4. Apply on the part.	neutral

Theme: Hobby Sets Set name: Harley-Davidson 1000cc Set Number: 394 Price (new): 260-280 $, 185-200 Euro Price (used): 14-175 $, 10-125 Euro Pieces: 143 Year of release: 1976 Links: Peeron, Bricklink and Brickset Looking at the release date of this set makes me remember the good old times when LEGO sets stayed in production and could be found in stores for long years. Yes, I hear you younger FOLs say this meant we had less variety at the time, but at least we did not have to go on a frenzy to get them all in just 1 or 2 years before they disappeared (to re-appear on the secondary market at crazy prices). Anyway, I also realise this set is older than me by 5 years (at least the first boxes of this set). I think my parents bought it when I was something like 1/2 year old, or even before, as my Father really liked the Hobby Set line and took any chance to get one, you know, for the kids, when theyâ€™ll be old enough to play with themâ€¦ I am really happy my Father did it, too. As a matter of fact, this has always been one of my favourite non-minifigure scale sets. I know younger eyes will look on it and wonder how we could love and enjoy a model like this, so blocky and rough. Just remember this was the best TLG designers could do with the bricks available at the time. Enough about memories; letâ€™s start with the review! The Box Front The front of the box (here cut and folded to save space) shows the Harley Davidson 1000cc in all its glory upon a nice town landscape. I really appreciate how TLG box designers used a real life photo of the model in a real life environment to give this Hobby Set a better background. Moreover, the landscape does not distract the eye, even with its lights, since the focus is strongly set on the motorbike itself. Back (and sides) The back of the box shows the model on a more neutral background and from another angle. We can see the stickers in place (take a good look at them here, because I did not apply them). The right side we also see a pic of the set from the front, and one with a child playing with it. In this latter shot, the model rests upon a nice black box with a Harley Davidson sign on it. I frankly do not remember if this was some sort of tray or smaller box within the LEGO one or if it is meant for publicity only. Another thing we can notice on the right-most side of the box is a white band, right below the LEGO logo, sporting the sign â€˜Designed for experienced LEGO buildersâ€™ in various languages. All in all, a really well done and professional job. Contents Inside This set includes a number of parts in mainly Black, White and Light Grey. Some Blue and Yellow add nice touches of colour to the total. The partsâ€™ selection is not mind-blowing, as most of the pieces had been in production, in these same colours for years. Anyway, Iâ€™d like to focus on a couple of details: The Milky White Technic axles as well as the Red Technic Bush Old 2 are among my favourite parts. The bushes, in particular, are quite useful to build more sturdy looking tubes than what can be achieved with the newer and slimmer ones. It would seem that the tile pieces appeared in the â€˜without groveâ€™ version as a standard and in the â€˜with groveâ€™ version as alternates (see Bricklink inventory). Notice, though that the box (above) and instructionsâ€™ (below) pictures all show the â€˜with groveâ€™ variety. As said, there are no re-coloured parts in this set. New pieces The few new molds used in this set are: Black and White Slope, Inverted 45 2 x 2 Old Type with Round Bottom Tube, Black Technic, Brick 1 x 2 with Hole Type II and Red Hinge Plate 2 x 4 with Articulated Joint â€“ Male and Female. The most interesting piece from this lot, as many of you will have noticed is the Technic, Brick 1 x 2 with Hole Type II. This kind of technic brick was use during 1976 and 1977 only. It would seem TLG tried a new design variant, which did not meet success and was later replaced with the standard bricks again. Nonetheless, Iâ€™m sure that people who own these bricks like them for the unusual design and the possibilities they offer into adding details to their creations. Instructions Cover â€“ As usual, the instructions are not organised in the form of a booklet, but they consist of a folded double printed sheet. The â€˜coverâ€™ shows again the same shot as the front of the box, with bigger LEGO logo and set number and without the other additional information. â€˜Back coverâ€™ â€“ Here we see the full name of the set: Harley-Davidson FLH 1200. This makes me wonder: why is this set known as 394 Harley Davidson 1000cc when it is indeed a 1200cc? Anyway, what really makes me love this page is the list of stats below the photo, and in particular these two lines: H.P. (?)/(not given). This calls for just one question: why did Harley-Davidson not release this info? My opinion is that since this is a motorbike built for the Police, they did not have permission to share the specifications on the motor, which was probably customised either by Harley-Davidson upon request or by the Police themselves. â€˜Random pageâ€™ â€“ As expected, no call-outs here, but the build is pretty straight forward and does not need them (apart for one passage weâ€™ll see later). The colours are easy to tell apart (in the end there is no Dark Grey in this set that could be confused with Black). Again, notice how the instructions include the â€˜with groveâ€™ tiles and not the older ones. Maybe this was changed during the long time this set stayed in production? The â€˜last pageâ€™ shows other four models included in the Hobby Set line. Unfortunately, I own only one of them: the 396 Thatcher Perkins Locomotive. Indeed, I would have liked to have them all! Building Start The handle bars look a bit too squared to me, but itâ€™s just a minor feature, and the overall shape is still good in my opinion. Notice the red hinge plate, which will be almost totally hidden in the finished model (see below), and the blue tiles which work as indicators. The first steps, used to build the front wheel and windshield are really easy, until you get to the wheel. In facts, the instructions do not show clearly all the pieces needed for it, and I found myself with a â€˜floatingâ€™ wheel for the absence of one of the Red Technic Bush Old 2 on one side (the one not visible on the instructions, of course). Not a big deal, but something that could have been done better. Motor and seat The second part of the build includes the motor, seat and â€˜saddle bagsâ€™. The technique used for the motor, or better the radiator, is very clever. To get the ridged feel, TLG designers used 4 Light Grey plates stuck one on the other but not completely in contact. This way, the studs, while keeping the plates in position, keep them raised from one another at the same time. The Yellow round bricks add some details and colour touches to this predominantly Light Grey parts of the vehicle. The use of the Engine, Smooth Small, 1 x 2 Side Plates for the exhaust pipes, while quite clever, still looks a bit strange to me. Iâ€™m mostly used to see them in airplanes, helicopters and spaceships. â€˜Saddle-bagsâ€™, a simple build for one of the iconic parts of this motorcycle. Here you see them in place, as well as get a look at the finished seat. I like how LEGO designers managed to make its shape with just a few quite big bricks. The â€˜saddle bagsâ€™ are a really nice touch, and they work perfectly when compared to the original. This is the rear wheel. As said before, only when you get to this passage in the instruction you get a real understanding of how the front wheel is supposed to be mounted as well. Careful readers will notice how this is not one of the original wheels in this set. The original ones were mounted using the Technic, Gear Expert Builder 9 Tooth. Unfortunately, I could only find one of them in my collection, an itâ€™s used as the front wheel. By adding the rear wheel (which is shown from a better angle in the instructions), we complete the model. Notice how the two technic bricks supporting the wheel are held in position by two 2x1 plates. I think this was a bad case of â€˜building by compartmentsâ€™ mentality: if TLG designers had considered this a bit more, they would have used 2 4x1 plates instead of 4 2x1. On the other hand, this is not the worst case I have seen in a LEGO set, and they keep up the tradition nowadays too. Finished set Front And here it is our fancy Police Harley-Davidson! Indeed, the front looks blocky and quite horrible to our eyes, but again, it was almost the best that could be done at the time. I only wish they had made it a little less bulky, even though this build is clearly thought to give better stability to the wheel. The Blue tiles work nicely to emphasise the indicators, the slightly unsightly red plate is normally covered by the plate sticker and the windshield, albeit being hard to see through, is nicely shaped. Back The back side is less detailed than the front, but shows the red light and antenna which are typical of the Police motorbikes from this period. How many times have we seen this angle in the chase scenes from TV shows like â€œCHiPsâ€? Side All in all, this model looks pretty sturdy (apart for the antenna, which falls off all too easily) and detailed, especially considering the limited variety of parts available and used at the time. They even got so far to put a 2x2 tile as kick-stand to display it without fear of it falling on the sides! Bonus images Size comparison? What I never understood about this set is what scale it is meant to be. I mean, it is clearly not minifig-scale, and it could not be technic-fig-scale (those came later). But it is not even Miniland scale! Moreover, the only other model with the same scale is the other Hobby Set motorbike, as the cars have a scale of their own and the Thatcher uses still another one! Final comments Overall, this is a great set for collectors of old models and motorbike fans, or both. It does not sport a huge variety of bricks, but was a good choice at the time, and even if the result is matter-of-fact blocky when compared to the original, it implements some good solutions to minimise the LEGO brick appearance and maximise the similarity as much as possible. Design & Colour scheme â€“ 9/10 (The design is as accurate as possible, apart for the front mudguard maybe, and the colours are completely in line for a Police vehicle. The solutions and details included in this set justify the â€˜Expert buildersâ€™ label and add to the appearance, and, why not, playability of the model.) Parts - 8/10 (Not a huge selection, and very few new molds. Nonetheless, a good source of Black and White standard parts for MOCs and one of the few sources for the extra rare Technic, Brick 1 x 2 with Hole Type II pieces.) Playability - 9/10 (A sturdy model which can take some serious play and swoosh-ing without falling apart. The easily detachable antenna and the lack of an appropriate scale interaction with most other models make it lose one point, though.) Build - 7/10 (Pretty straight forward, with few nice solutions and an already mentioned slightly obscure passage in the instructions.) Price - 5/10 (Like most older models, especially the Hobby Set and Model Team ones, this set can be found at reasonable prices only rarely. Most of the times, people are asked shameful prices for such a smallish set.) Overall: 8/10 Very good. As always, questions, comments, and pic requests welcome!

Great job on this review of a unique and rare set LuxorV! Considering the year it was released, this must have been a cool set back then. Even up to now with all the specialized pieces and advanced building techniques, I could still appreciate the beauty of this brickbuilt Harley-Davidson police motorbike. The various elements are instantly recognizable and it even has the unusual 'partly-stacked' plates technique for the motor. Overall, I'd say this is an above average set that is a must-have for any hardcore LEGO collector.	positive
Great review! The set is really nice, I love that the front of the motercycle can turn and the engine is just beautiful, with its half stacked bricks like KielDaMan said. The price used or new is quite a bit, but there is a good variety of bricks here like the bricks inside the wheels. Did you get this set from your father? Great review LuxorV!	positive
Thanks for the feedback guys! Indeed this is a great set, and I'm very attached to it. As far as I remember, I got it for say my 2nd birthday, I think But it is not my first LEGO set. You'll learn more on this in my next planned review	positive
LuxorV, this is a well written presentation on this LEGO Vintage review. I never knew the existence of this set and even though the design is not part of the modern LEGO design concept but the overall appeal back in the 1970s certainly appeal to many. I could not mind to own such vintage LEGO model and put them on display and potray as if it was a chart of evolution of LEGO motorbikes. Thanks for sharing and I can't wait to find out your next review.	positive
Thanks 'LuxorV' for this review of such a classic old Lego set and I do remember seeing these in a catalogue years ago. Excellent brick-built police cycle, I think it's time Lego did another one eh ? Brick On Ride On Everyone !	positive
Great review for a classic model. I love it.	positive
Theme: Hobby Sets Set name: Thatcher Perkins Locomotive Set Number: 396 Price (new): 369-450 $, 258-314 Euro Price (used): 100-355 $, 45-250 Euro Pieces: 434 Year of release: 1976 Links: Peeron, Bricklink and Brickset My Father assures me this is the very first LEGO set I ever got. In facts, he gave it to me as a present for my first half year. Of course, that is to say he bought it for himself and used me as the official excuse! When I grew up, at first I found it to be quite boring: no minifigures, limited play features; in the end, it was just a locomotive! It soon went to forgotten-land. Then, when I was about 10 years old, I one day found again the instructionsâ€™ â€˜bookletâ€™ and saw this bright coloured big steam engine, and I suddenly wanted to build it again. It would seem I finally got to the right age (at least for me) to appreciate the design of this great set. But enough about memories; letâ€™s start with the review! The Box Front The front of the box (here cut and folded to save space) shows the Thatcher Perkins Locomotive in all its glory upon a nice countryside landscape. I really appreciate how TLG box designers used a real life environment made of sand, gravel and pebbles to give this Hobby Set a better background. Moreover, the landscape does not distract the eye, since the focus is strongly set on the locomotive itself. The box measures about 39.5 x 24.5 x 5.5 centimetres, or 15.56 x 9.65 x 2.17 inches. This is more or less the size of the 4840 - The Burrow, or the Advent Calendars. Back (and sides) The back of the box shows the model on a more neutral background and from another angle. We can see the stickers in place (take a good look at them here, because I did not apply them). The right side we also see a pic of the set from the (3/4) back, and one with a child playing with it. In this latter shot, the model rests upon a nice black box with a Thatcher Perkins sign on it. Unlike the Harley Davidson 1000cc set, the Thatcher Perkins does not have the sign â€˜Designed for experienced LEGO buildersâ€™ for some reason. Contents Inside This set includes a large number of parts, mainly Black, Blue and Red, with some nice Yellow to lighten it up more. Parts of interest The partsâ€™ selection is not exceptional, but weâ€™ll see this set includes some unique pieces which have not been in LEGO sets for long years since the 1980s, like the very nice Black Plate, Modified 1 x 2 with Steam Engine Cylinder, Flat Surfaces, Black Train Wheel Spoked for Motor and the Red Train Steam Drive Rod Holder - Train Steam Drive Rod group. The Wheel Spoked Large, as beautiful as they were, saw the light from the production line for the last time in 1976! The only new mold used in this set is the Black and Blue Slope, Inverted 45 2 x 2 Old Type with Round Bottom Tube. As you can see in the above picture, this locomotive was designed to work (well, be played with) on all kind of surfaces, so the wheels sport tyres. In this picture you can see how they look without the tyres. Of course, builders can use the Thatcher Perkins on their brick-built tracks. Another group of interesting parts are shown in this pic: Red Wheel Spoked 2 x 2 with Stud (and tyre), Black Brick, Modified 2 x 4 with Wheels Holder Old, Clear Bottom and Yellow Minifig, Head (Plain) - Stud Solid. Many newer fans will not be familiar with the last two parts: they were standard fare in a number of sets between the 1960s and early 1990s, but then (unfortunately) they were taken out of production. To be fair, the replacement of the Black Brick, Modified 2 x 4 with Wheels Holder Old, Clear Bottom with the standard technic parts was probably due to the fact that the metal pin used to connect the wheels to these bricks had a shameful tendency at getting off the wheel. Too bad it could not be fixed and these parts kept in production. For those interested, here is a picture of the DSS, courtesy of Peeron. Instructions Cover â€“ As usual, the instructions are not organised in the form of a booklet, but they consist of a folded double printed sheet. The â€˜coverâ€™ shows again the same shot as the front of the box. â€˜Back coverâ€™ â€“ Here we see the name of the set and some additional information, like the year when the first Thatcher Perkins started working (1863) and the type (4-6-0) of this locomotive, which, as shown in the image, is related to the number and position of the wheels. On a side note, the pencil signs on the sides of the sheet were made by my Father while counting the parts in the set. â€˜Random pageâ€™ â€“ As expected, no call-outs here, but the build is pretty straight forward and does not need them. The colours are easy to tell apart. Full page â€“ As you may have noticed, all the building steps are drawn on one side of the â€˜bookletâ€™, making it more properly an instructionsâ€™ sheet. What really makes this â€˜instruction bookletâ€™ stand out in my eyes is the fact that it is indeed a poster: the building steps are all on one side, while the other is a bigger image of the completed set with the name Thatcher Perkins in yellow enclosed in an old styled red tag. Building Start The build starts with the base of the locomotive, putting the 10 wheels in place and strengthening the engine. Notice the use of this â€˜illegalâ€™ technique to build the bumpers. LEGO, as we all know can be a tricky medium to build with, and some details need special solutions to be completed. We then start building the boiler and cabin. Going up fast and steady! In the penultimate step, we build the chimney and cow catcher. Iâ€™d like to spend a few more words on the chimney and how it is attached to the main body. As you can see in the left picture, the 3x3 base of the chimney is asymmetrical, with a 3x2 base on one side and a combination of a 1x2 and a 1x1 plates on the other. In the right picture, you see the top of the main body where the chimney will be attached; it is made of a 1x2 base and 1 1x2 tile. Using another â€˜illegalâ€™ technique (or at least one LEGO designers do not like much nowadays), the holes of the 3x2 plate of the chimney will connect with the studs of the 1x2 plate on the main body, giving a well centred and quite sturdy build. Finished set Front The front of the model sports 3 big headlights, a nice cow catcher and the nicely detailed engine front. I can almost hear it whistle! Side And here it is our good old Thatcher Perkins Locomotive! Indeed, it looks like a classic and powerful engine form one of those Spaghetti Western films, doesnâ€™t it? What I found strange in the beginning is the choice of colours (I was convinced steam engines were all black, at the time). Then I checked some pictures of the original, and I must admit the resemblance is almost perfect! Back The back side is less detailed than the front, with cabin almost devoid of details. I think LEGO could have done a better job on it. 3/4 Front and â€¦ Just see how good it looks from this angle, with all the tubing, moving parts and the lovely 3 headlights! â€¦ 3/4 Back The back view is not as impressive, but grants us a good look at the big posterior wheels and the bumpers. Bonus images Size comparison? As I stated elsewhere, I never understood what scale these Hobby Sets are meant to be. They are clearly not minifig-scale, and they are not technic-fig-scale either. But they are not even Miniland scale! Moreover, they use different scales between locomotives, cars and motorbikes amongst the Hobby Set line! As I said before, the set comes with tyres on the wheels to allow a wider playing experience, not limiting this model to tracks. Nonetheless, builders can assemble their own track (maybe using the vintage blue 4.5V tracks) and make the Thatcher Perkins run its proper environment. Final comments Overall, this is a great set for collectors of old models and steam engines fans, or both. It does not sport a huge variety of bricks, but was a good choice at the time, and even if the result is matter-of-fact a bit blocky when compared to the original, it implements some good solutions to minimise the LEGO brick appearance and maximise the similarity as much as possible. Design & Colour scheme â€“ 8/10 (The design is as accurate as possible, and the colours are completely in line for the Thatcher Perkins Locomotive. The solutions and details included in this set justify the â€˜Expert buildersâ€™ label and add to the appearance, and, why not, playability of the model. Though, I still wish TLG had included more details in the cabin.) Parts - 10/10 (Quite a big selection, but only one new mould. Nonetheless, a good source of Black, Blue and Red standard parts for MOCs and one of the few sources for the extra rare Black Plate, Modified 1 x 2 with Steam Engine Cylinder, Flat Surfaces, Black Train Wheel Spoked for Motor, Red Train Steam Drive Rod Holder - Train Steam Drive Rod group and Wheel Spoked Large.) Playability - 9/10 (A sturdy model which can take some serious play and swoosh-ing without falling apart. The somewhat easily detachable chimney and the lack of an appropriate scale interaction with most other models make it lose one point, though.) Build - 7/10 (Pretty straight forward, with few nice solutions.) Price - 5/10 (Like most older models, especially the Hobby Set and Model Team ones, this set can only rarely be found at reasonable prices. Most of the times, people are asked shameful prices for such a smallish set.) Overall: 8/10 Very good. More pictures can be found in this Brickshelf gallery. As always, questions, comments, and pic requests welcome! Edited by Rufus, 10 July 2011 - 07:05 PM. Indexed	positive
Rare classic sets are always a priceless part of any LEGO collection, and it's a good thing you still have this first set of yours Luxor (or did you purchase a new one?). Excellent review BTW, it's always a pleasure getting a closer look at these classic sets which I wouldn't have known to exist had I not seen this review. Overall I think it's a really good set at that time, of course judging this one by modern standards won't be fair but at the time I'm pretty sure it was a 'cool' set to have (though less cooler than having the Harley Davidson set).	positive
Thanks, Luxor, for bringing us this excellent tour round an old classic! For its time, this is truly a remarkably detailed and beautiful set, and I think it's amazing how it's still in such good condition after all this time. Do you have any more from this era (excepting the Harley, of course )? I've created a whole new index to put them in	positive

A nice flashback 35 years ago....now thats old school anyway Brick On everyone ! Indeed, this set must be valued in relation to its own time and style.

INDEXED 410 â€“ Payloader Theme: Legoland/Vehicle Piece Count: 28 Year Released: 1973 MSRP: ??? Links: Brickset, Lugnet, Peeron, Bricklink *Note: This set was released under the number 604 outside of the U.S.* Ah, classic Legoland. A time before mini-figs ever existed, and cars and buildings could be made with just a few bricks. The part selection was pretty basic: bricks, plates, slopes, windows and wheels were all you needed to construct an entire town. Heavy machinery could be modeled in 4-wide and be just a few bricks tall. For this review we will be taking a look at the 410 Payloader, one of LEGOâ€™s first sets of a bucket loader. So grab a hard hat, we are heading to the construction yard! Box image courtesy of Bricklink. Box Contents Here we have our instructions which are obviously the older style of LEGO instructions. The steps used much simpler imagery, but they get the job done. They show how to build the Payloader in seven steps. This small set has all of 28 parts in it. The more interesting parts of note are the red digger arm, the bucket, the blue 1X2 brick with arm holes, and the blue 2X2 brick with the classic LEGO logo printed on it. Construction In the first few steps we start building up the base. Then add the arms and start building the cab. Add the bucket, the trailer socket and finish the cab. Throw on some wheels. Completed Set And with that we are finished with our nice small model. Here is the back right side. Notice how the back of the cab was left with an empty spot. Here is the left side. Notice how on the top of the arm they made it so you could just push down on the tips it to make the arm lift instead of having to grab by the arm itself. On the front we have the nice LEGO logo shown to remind the forgetful of what they were playing with. You can also see how much space is in the bucket itself, which can't hold more than a few small plates. Finally on the back we have the trailer socket. This was a nice addition to make it able to tow trailers from other sets like 685. Just donâ€™t try to bring it into your layout populated by mini-figs, they may have a problem trying to get in. Other Thoughts Considering this set is nearly 37 years old, I myself am still surprised by how well the bricks have held up. I purchased this set from a thrift store a year ago for a mere 25 cents. Normally when used LEGO is purchased you can expect to see scratches, marks, wearing, discoloration, etc but boy was I surprised to see how all these parts are in mint condition. Even the instructions still looked like they came from a new box and not all ripped up and tattered. The pieces still connect to each other nice and tight and the metal pieces for the wheels haven't rusted. This just shows that with proper care these things can last a lifetime. I really would like to get a small display case to show it off. Conclusion Playability: 8/10 In addition to the standard of having rolling wheels, you also get a fully movable bucket assembly. With it you can pick up smaller pieces and unload them into a dump truck. Design: 7/10 Like all other Legoland vehicles it has a very basic design, but you can still easily identify what it is. Simple yet effective. Parts: 7/10 Like most other older LEGO sets, all you really get are a few basic bricks and plates. However, you do get a bucket assembly and the 2X2 brick with the classic LEGO logo on it is very cool. It was also nice of LEGO to include the trailer socket so you could tow around your trailers. Price: 8/10 Bricklink's history shows them to sell for around $10 USD used. While that is a bit much for a set this size, it is pretty good considering this set is over 37 years old. However, if you are looking for a new boxed set be prepared to fork over about $50 USD. Overall: 8/10 This small machine would make a nice addition to your collection as a reminder of LEGO's past. So what are your thoughts on this classic set? Edited by TheBrickster, 01 June 2010 - 05:55 AM.	positive
Thank you very much for this wonderful review! This is the oldest Lego set in my collection. I received this model from my grand parents many years ago - I'm not exactly sure who in my family it used to belong to, but it has a home with me now. It's a very simple but attractive looking vehicle, and functions pretty well too. Overall, very nice.	positive
Thanks for the great nostalgic review! Great pictures, I love the shiny glow of 37 year old bricks! Sets were simpler back then, but not less exciting in their own way. I wasn't even born in 1973, but one of my first sets was the 1982 update of this, 6630 Bucket Loader. Almost 10 years later, but the very same bucket assembly, only the colours have changed.	positive
Nice review! Great nostalgic set, like you said, it has nice design-Simple yet effective! I like construction vehicles, so this set has even bigger impact on me!	positive
I voted 'Outstanding.' Regarding this set, I found mine at a consignment store. It was inside of a larger set from the same time period.	positive
Woah. 25 cents for a mint condition set! That's amazing.	neutral
Well, it's not exactly a large shuttle, but still a nice set: 442 Space Shuttle Year Released: 1979 Piece Count: 79 Minifigs: 1 Vehicles: 0 List Price: unknown This little classic was my smallest classic space set. Believe it or not, I still have the box: Here's the back: The instructions are pretty tattered and missing a section. I had to download some from the web: But the ship is again intact, missing only one grey 1x3 plate: I've always liked this computer piece: Here's the under side. This set included the small classic jet engines: A close-up of the sloped printed space brick: And the complete set with minifig: This set was a great little space ship that made a nice addition to the Blue Space Theme. As small as it was, it could hold two-three figs (one standing up). I don't even think the Mars Mission Recon Drop Ship holds three figs. In any case, it was a must-have for Blue Space Fans, and probably only a few bucks back in the day. SWOOSH!	neutral
and again those tears in my eyes. with original box...! I really love those classic space stuff. Looks like I need to clean my stuff this summer.	positive
This classic space shuttle is simply superb! I love the layout of this shuttle. In fact, it reminded me as one of the space fighter jet, that roam around in space, defending the boundaries from intruders. I just love these old grey bricks very much and the printed computer brick is just lovely. It's such a pity, that I did not grow up with Classic Space in my childhood. These are actually great stuff, and formed the base of the Space theme in LEGO. Brickster, thanks again for another outstanding classic review.	positive
this was my first space set ever!! 1979, 1980... don't know anymore, but i do remember i got this together with 897 for my birthday when we where camping... with a little luck i may even have an old film from my dad, opening the boxes... well what to say... it looked soooooo aggressive with those two engines! but i never knew why you needed two steering wheels on it... they probably just thought a symmetrical model was better .... i can't blame them... what a nice set.... it would even sell today, no doubt... looooots of swooshability...	positive
The computer is my favorite part. Sadly, I dont own any classic space...Exept for some space police, and a blue classic space man.	positive
Nice!!! 442 is the lowest set number I have seen for any Classic Space set, so it must been released with the first wave in 1978. Its remarkable that a LEGO spaceship this old and small can seat more figs than the much bigger MX-71 Recon Dropship of today. Anyway, I just want to grab it out of the screen and swoosh it all over the place, lol. TLG, please make these Classic Space sets again! I promise I'll buy many!	positive
INDEXED Everyone remembers their first time. For me, it was in 19*cough*somethingsomething*cough*. We were at her house, and her mother was gone for at least an hour. She slowly unzi... uhhh. Sorry, wrong story. Um, yeahh. Anyway, I do remember my first time. It was 1977, in late summer. Our neighbor, who worked for a department store called Famous-Bahr, said that the main store had a travelling LEGO display. So my family filed into the car and drove into downtown St Louis to see this display. To tell you the truth, I don't remember much about the display itself, but I DO remember that my parents bought me my first LEGO set. Set # 456, the Spirit of St Louis. Set #: 456 (also sold as Set # 661) Name: Spirit of St Louis Theme: LEGOLAND / Large Vehicle Year: 1977 Pieces: 49 Minifigs: 0 Price: $5.00 USD? (Bricklink MISB start @ $175.00 USD, Used Complete ~$35.00 USD) Links: Peeron, Bricklink, Brickset Packaging Box Front: The original box that my set came in was most likely trashed 5 minutes after returning home. This image was lovingly stolen off of the Peeron page for this set. I feel lucky that I even got this much. Similarly, I have no pictures of the plastic baggies the set came in. Truth be told, I can't be sure that there even WERE plastic baggies that the parts came in. THE SET Side View: Well there she is. My first set ever . Actually, I seem to recall the real Spirit of St Louis was silver colored, not Black and Yellow. If you need a history lesson, the Spirit of St Louis was Charles Lindbergh's plane when he made the first trans-Atlantic solo flight. More details can be found on the Wikipedia page. The overall shape is pretty close, at least. The cockpit window could stand to be moved forward one stud, but everything seems to be relatively close. The tail piece isn't the right shape, but it is likely the only tail piece LEGO produced at the time. If you look closely, you can see the various bite marks that my brother and I inflicted over the years. I know some people would be aghast that there are bite marks, but brick separators wouldn't come out for another 10 years. Besides, we were young. We didn't know any better. I certainly had no idea that it would become my obsession. There are some interesting part choices here. Everything is brick and plate built, as you might expect. The same set nowadays would have lots of slope, wedges and wedge plates to round things out. But LEGO was all about the brick in '77, so bricks are what we got. The black inverted slopes worked pretty well asthetically as the wing struts. The wings are simple 4 x 10 plates, nice and square. There were no minifigs in this set. If I remember correctly, 1977 was just about the time when minifigs made their first appearance. I know I have one other set from '77 that does include a minifg, at least. I don't have a lot of comments for the following photos. I'll let the pictures speak for themselves. 3/4 View Back Back 3/4 Top Front PARTS Interesting Pieces I have no idea if there were any extra pieces that came with this set. I kind of doubt it. Instead I took a photo of some of the interesting parts to the model. That translucent white piece didn't photograph so well, but it is a Technic Axle 8. That's right, sets from 1977 contained Technic elements. The two black parts are the forerunners to the 1 x 2 Technic Brick, as well. Everytime I hear someone on the forums complain about Technic elements in system sets, I think back to this set. The round brick is special as well. Here is a closer view of it, complete with bite marks . Round Brick As you can see, the stud is closed. It is only one of two closed stud 1 x 1 Round Bricks that I own. They stopped appearing in sets in 1981, for those that are interested. The DSS You thought you were going to escape this heading, didn't you? Surprise! Yes, even in 1977 LEGO sets had stickers. The oldest printed elements I can remember were in the Classic Space sets that started in 1979. Again, when people in the forums complain about DSS in sets, I can only help think of this set. And chuckle to myself maniacally. The sticker has held up really well considering it's been stuck on the brick for 32 years. No discoloration, very little curling. I think if all stickers held up this well over time, there would be less DSS complaints. THE RATINGS Playability: 6/10 - The set is quite swooshable, and the propellor spins. Outside of that, though... Minifigs: N/A Design: 6/10 - The overall shape is quite good, especially given the era. The color choice leaves a lot to be desired. Price: 1/10 - It's been retired for 30 years. It's going to cost you to get your hands on it. Overall: 13/30 - This set is for true collectors only. I can't imagine anyone wanting one because they want to play with it. It was a great set back in the day, but the design feels REALLY dated. And if you're wondering, mine is NOT for sale. Ever. All the photos, plus more, can be found in the Gallery.	neutral
Great job! I love reading vintage reviews, as it reminds of our childhood days. Glad to see this in very good condition. By the way, I will move this to LEGO Trains & Town, to see if TheBrickster will like to include this set inside the review index over there. I believe he is maintaining vintage town set reviews over there, and this suits there well.	positive

Great review, It's good to see some of the old sets reviewed. I think I learned something about the history of Lego from this one.	neutral
fantastic review! IÂ´d love to read more like this, trivia about old/rare pieces is almost as fun as the set itself.	neutral
In 1977, trans or yellow slopes existed already, and using them would have made the plane more realistic. A third rear wheel would have enhanced playability and design, rather than this ugly black round brick. It's the reason why I voted "below average" even considering 1977's standards. However this set is nice and simple, offering good playability.	negative

Just go there (Washington) and have a look of this legend : Cavannus, on Jul 15 2009, 09:40 PM, said: In 1977, trans or yellow slopes existed already, and using them would have made the plane more realistic. I don't think so. There is no 45Â° slope in the original plane design ... and no front cockpit window. Quote A third rear wheel would have enhanced playability and design, rather than this ugly black round brick. Except that it wouldn't have been the Spirit Of St Louis. This set is a great one and I wish I'd bought it in '77. It is the Spirit of the 70ties ...	positive

Oooops, you're completely right, the Spirit Of St-Louis didn't have any front window nor rear wheel. Anyway, I think a standard Ryan M-1/M-2 plane would have been a better choice. Less a legend, but more a flexible plan for multiple uses!	negative
I really like the design, it has an aesthetic value lacking from most official Lego planes and follows closely to the real thing (minus the colours), something that can't really be claimed for more recent sets.	positive
483 Alpha-1 Rocket Base Year Released: 1979 Piece Count: 170 Minifigs: 3 Vehicles: 1 (two sections) List Price: unknown Despite the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968, Lego dared design a Rocket Base complete with a rocket system that may have had nuclear capability in 1979. Luckily, the rocket was defective having rather flimsy white bricks that did not stay together well during launch attempts. Lego scrapped its WMD program and the result was this classic "blue era" space set known as the Alpha-1 Rocket Base. Instructions: On the backside of the instructions, the set is featured with the Space Command Center, Space Cruiser, and a few vehicle sets: The set includes three figs: And this great rocket fuel tanker: Here's the front section complete with computer: And the rocket fuel section: The set has some interesting features including the Control Section, Fuel Control, and Launch Pad: On top of the Control Section is a nicely design radar/tracking system: Here's the open control room: The Launch Pad and Fuel Control: The Fuel Control includes two sink pieces and blue steering wheels: And Lego's WMD (Weapon of Mass Destruction), the Alpha-1 on the Launch Pad: Here's a shot of the launching mechanism: Unfortunately, I have lost one of the blue sink/faucet pieces as well as a black hose: A close-up of the Alpha-1 Rocket. The white bricks never stayed together well often times coming apart within your hands: The arming and guidance system was nicely designed: A view of the complete set: And another: This is a great set. The base, fuel vehicle, and launch platform offers a great amount of playability. My only complaint is the rocket (as mentioned above). I don't think I ever played with it a sa kid because it always fell apart. Share your comments regarding this Classic Space set.	positive

wooow! what a set!! not all that large, most defenitely not as sophisticated as the message intercept base from 10 years later, but in those, this was all a kid need to have hours of fun. soooo many great parts on this one.... technic hoses, computers, rocket parts, trans yellow parts... the perfect outpst really... it was actually my sister who got this one, but it only took an hour before i claimed it...

Hey EB'ers, i got my Market Street on Monday and finished building it last night. I know it?s not such a nice review like *yoda* did the last times, but i hope you enjoy some of the pics. First a pic of the complete building: The 3 Minifigs: and i pic of the stairs (one of my highlights at this set): More pics you can find here My opinion about the set: I like this set very much, it was really fun to build it. I?m happy that that i got some more cherries and a croissant now *sweet* , a funny idea is the salad in the one box at the front. i think normally it?s a hairpiece of an exoforce fig. I also like the colours of the house, the dark blue is sooooo nice. I think i have to take more of this soon. The lighter blue is also nice. This set has really nice details like the stairs, or the owl at the entry of the market, or the balcony. I paid 89,99 EUR, a fair price for a really nice set!! Greetings Sandra	positive
Thanks for the review, my favourite detail is the salad! :-D BTW, could you exchange the modules and make pics of that? I'd like to see how the building looks with the flat roof instead of the dutch style one. I'm not sure though if the vents on the flat roof makes sense as long as it's only used as a garage top... :-/ Maybe they should be removable as the balconies and such things to make the modularity leading not to weird results... Other than this: In combination with a lot of money and the Cafe Corner set this really could get me into city! ;-)	positive
thanks for the great review! *sweet* now that i've seen the set, I'm afraid i'm a bit disappointed 8-| 1) the color combination doesn't really do it for me. blue, dark blue, grey, black, tan, white, they're all mixed together without any over all design... 2) is there any interior? it doesn't look like it, and in any case, you can only reach it if you remove the modules... hm... |-/ now it looks too much of a box... 3) there are most certainly some nice ideas in this model and some great parts. the best part of the model is the staircase 4) i don't think he spent much time in thinking about the design. As apo said, the chimneys on top of a garage is kinda weird, there's also a gate, next to another gate which is weird as well... also, if this is supposed to ba a grocery, then the owner has done a lot to hide it. The croissant is nice, but next to the brown box with vegies, there's nothing that suggests this is a shop... 5) the white lamp and the the yellow cylinder are at the same level of the tiles. IMO it should be above the level of the tiles... 6), IMO not worth the 90 euro Edited by snefroe1, 20 June 2007 - 09:03 AM.	negative
Thanks, I love the look of this set! I love the mix of colours, it breaks up the model rather than being a single monotone colour. He's used several complimentary colours in order to make up the model. I agree I think the chimneys on the flat roof is weird ontop of the garage, but not so weird one you place it ontop of the building. I guess he's done it to give us the choice of roofs and chimneys. You can always remove the ones you don't like... He also seems to have screwed up a bit on the tiling for the sidewalk on the side module. On Cafe Corner (And the building module of this set) the sidewalk has the pattern light grey 1x6 at the front, then dark grey 1x2 next, then dark grey 2x2's. However on this he's put the 2x2 tiles first then the 1x2's at the back. Easilly fixable though. Overall I love this set, thanks for the pics! Compliments Cafe Corner perfectly.	positive
Hi Thanks for posting those great pictures. I got the CC some time ago and I really looking forward to get my hands on the Market Street. I think the colour scheme of this set is great, maybe because blue is my favourite colour (just check my wardrobe)? I really like the design of the roof and the staircase. I ?am not so sure if I like the gateways but I believe they will grow on me when I get the set myself snefroe1, on Jun 20 2007, 09:02 AM, said: 5) the white lamp and the the yellow cylinder are at the same level of the tiles. IMO it should be above the level of the tiles... I? am totally agree with snefreo1, the yellow cylinder and the lamppost should be on a level above the tiles. Actually I have put a 2x2 plat under the lamppost on my CC, looks much better if you ask me. Unfortunately Shop at Home does not send to Norway???, so I have to purchase this set in Billund (Yes, I ?am going to Legoland this summer) or on ebay.	positive
Thank you very much for that nice review and those lovely pictures, Legocastlegirl! *y* A very interesting set with a great color scheme and some "sunny side" feeling indeed. *sweet*	positive
I'm not much of a city fan but this looks great. I guess this is the closest we can get to Legoland (miniland) quality sets. And considering this is a three floro, small structure, and it's over 1,000 parts, just imagine (pun not intended) how many peices are in LL California's Empire State Building or WTC Freedom Tower models! Both are large and in real scale over 100 floors! That's a lot of bricks. Anyways, I've got a friend who loves city. I'm sure this one would make a great addition to his town setup! Gotta tell him about this new set! *y*	positive

Tks for sharing these cool pics ;-) Its also a nice hommage to Erik Brok. I really like this set, I think its really well designed with great ideas such as the dual stairs, the balconies, the croissant insignia, the market entrance design with the horns, whip and owl 8-? I like the color combination, and the mosaic design just in front of the entrance. The only terrible flaw is that yellow cinlinder !! That is just awful for a flower pot :-X I don't mind at all having that lamp post at the same level since it would be normal to have the base of the lamp at the level of the tile but I agree that is just pickering about an insignificant detail :-P Legocastlegirl, on Jun 20 2007, 07:42 AM, said: a funny idea is the salad in the one box at the front. i think normally it?s a hairpiece of an exoforce fig.

Thanks for this review, and that great little comic! About the skellies though (X-D), you have to admit that besides their long arms making the skellie legs look out of proportion, that they're just made poorly. They're sticking straight out, as opposed to every other fig, which have a slight bend to make them look more natural. Also, as I'm sure you've noticed, the pegs are on angles! That makes it impossible for them to hold their weapons straight, and they can't even put their arms over their heads without stressing the plastic some... I mean they're DEAD. Well, at least undead, they're not supposed to be stiff, and personally I like the ragdoll look more, it makes them seem more dead :-P	negative
A very nice review with good pictures, thanks Grevious. *y* And undead ragdolls on! :-P	positive

Excellent photographs! and I like the comic too. I don't care what anyone says, I love the new skeletons. *skull*	positive
Nice review, and great little story. :-D *y* Look at the normal horses, their legs are positioned like that too. Only the skellie horse's legs are touching, so as to strengthen the middle, otherwise it could easily snap in half. Also, I think the new skeletons are nice, their head is awesome, I just don't see why TLC couldn't make the bent droid arms with the hand facing vertically, instead of making a new arm design completely straight.	positive
Nice review and a great story also grevious, this is a great set and a nice little army builder one at that. The only thing that saddens me about the line itself is the new arms on the skelies, they just look far to big when placed next to a normal fig. For me the old versions of the skelies were far better, why tlc changed to this is beyond me. Still i shall be buying alot of these sets just to increase my army.	positive

I bought this set last night and it is great. My biggest surprise was the wheels that were included; I didn't even know they existed and there aren't even that new. Back to the set, he is such a cute dinosaur. :-D Since he is so tubby I think he looks like a baby! I suspect my wife wanted him more than me.... my biggest interest in the set was to have more motors and IR parts so I could make an IR car. Overall, I highly recomend this set, but as others have said, be warned that the box is very oversized. I wish Lego would give up on this whole 1:1 picture thing. *wacko*	positive
The box is has really strange dimensions - it's very flat but has a large front - the 1:1 scale. Regarding the spines, because they're made of the softer non-ABS plastic (the stuff the 1994 cutlasses and brown muskets were made of), they lose their shape a bit and so are hard to grip; they simply fall off. I suppose TLC use loads of different colours because a single or two-colour dino isn't very nice to look at, especially when the surface isn't very smooth - it takes your eyes away from the surface and puts it on the colours. Someone should make an all terrain dino that can walk everywhere from this set - I don't have the skill with technic - I always end up layering and never finish any models. :-(	negative
Thanks for the nice review. It's butt ugly to me but the motors + IR control seem pretty neat ! Even at that high price, it looks like a good parts pack ! *sweet*	positive

Of course, right before I post this I see that Ickelpete reviewed this set earlier in the week. Sorry for being redundant but it is already written so here ya go: Monster Dino Reviewed by Dunamis Set 4958 792 Pieces $89.95 from LEGO Online Store Build time 3.5 hours Here we go with another offering from the Creator line. I?m kind of fond of these sets as they are pretty imaginative and usually have instructions for multiple models. I like the reusability of all the pieces and the varied things you can build. The Box: The box that LEGO shipped this thing in was absolutely huge! When I first got this in the mail, I thought I had won the lottery and they had shipped the UCS Falcon early. Once I opened the shipping box, I was surprised to see an unusually large Creator set box. The box itself is pretty standard Creator type box but this one shows off the Power Functions prominently on the right side of the box. The back of the box shows some of the motorized features as well. Opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals. We?re back to the reusable cereal box type tab system for those of you who stay up a night wondering about LEGO?s next box design. Inside the box we have a bunch of sealed bags. Immediately the power brick, remote and motors stand out as they are each in individual bags. Also, there are three manuals. The Manuals: The three manuals are 76, 76 and 56 pages in length. They are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - Piece call outs for each step - Parts inventory at the end of the primary model build - Page numbers Color separation in these manuals were fine for me. Interestingly, the instructions for the primary build took a full manual plus about a quarter of another manual. Random manual photos: Parts list I?ll explain a bit more below, but it would have been nice to have some written documentation on all the functions of the motors, remote and receiver. Such as motor load guidelines and specific explanations of all the remote control functions. It is severely lacking in this area. The Pieces: Obviously, the pieces we?re most interested in are these new motors and wireless remote control. Note that before you fire this bad boy up, you had better BYOB. Since this is prominently a European community, I had better clarify my acronyms. Over here across the pond, BYOB usually means ?Bring Your Own Beer?. In this case, it still means bring your own beer (I?m on my second Heineken right now) but in addition to numerous bottles of beer you will need a total of NINE batteries to get through this set. I kid you not: Anyway, there are two motors (a small and a large) each with its own very unique name according to the manual; the smaller one is called ?motor? and the larger one is called ?XL motor?. Very creative indeed! The battery box takes SIX AA batteries and there are two compartments to hold them. Here is the first: That seems pretty normal. However, the back side of it holds the other three batteries and it seems to be very poorly designed: Note in the photo above where the bottom battery is placed. Compare it to the previous photo and you will see the difference. I played around with trying to get that bottom battery out and you better pack a lunch (or BYOB) because it is no small task! Why couldn?t they make this compartment just like the other side? There is a single power cord connector and a three position switch. The middle position turns the power OFF and the other two positions seem to provide the same functionality in either position as far as I can tell. Perhaps a little blurb in the manual would have been nice to clear things up a bit. The remote takes three AAA batteries. It is fairly small and lightweight even with the batteries installed. It has two thumb controls which could be levers if you insert Technic bars or even pins. The two controls are color coded and match the plugs on the receiver to control two separate motors. In addition, there is a four position switch which I assume changes the channel. Finally, there are two tiny levers that seem to have no function. I?m not sure if they are a trim control or variable speed control. I messed with them and didn?t notice any difference in the motor speed. Again, some documentation from the incredibly verbose LEGO manual would have helped. As far as the rest of the parts, it?s really a mixed bag. There are a lot of varied parts in this set to the point that there is almost one of everything. Lots of Technic gears, pins, studded beams, studless beams, axles, wheels, etc. Also, lots of little 1x1 slopes in various colors, teeth, horns, etc. You can?t really say it is a parts pack because there is not enough of one thing to make it a parts pack. A couple of notes: It seems the quality control issue on the axles has been fixed. I initially reported this back when I reviewed the 8285 about a year ago. All the axles worked fine for me. The color quality control issue is still alive. Check out the different shade of red in these two parts: Also included is the sound brick. This looks just like the other sound or light-up bricks we have been seeing lately. It does have a load dinosaur ?roar!? sound embedded in it though so hide the younglings if they are a bit on the skittish side. Finally, I?ve never seen one of these before (although someone will no doubt rattle off a dozen sets where you can find this part in about 5 seconds): No, I am not referring to the studded beam, I put that in the photo for scale. The Build: The build was fun and was fairly straightforward. As I mentioned, there is a lot of Technic parts, so if you are not a fan of the Technic line you should run, not walk away from this one. There were no gotchas to speak of, but you need to pay careful attention to the placement of the wires that go from the motors to the receiver. They kind of sneak them around a bit so watch closely. Otherwise, it was fine. Here is what is left over: So far, I have only built the primary model. As seen on the box, there are instructions for two more models. Both of the other models seem less complex than the primary model and are likely quicker builds. The Dino took me about 3.5 hours which included some time to screw around with the motors. I?m an old school Technic fan from way back in the 80?s so I had some familiarity with the old Technic motors. Obviously, 25+ years has improved some things and these seem much more powerful. The Design: If you have built the 4507 Prehistoric Creatures then some of the design will feel familiar, especially the head and tail. It is almost like they took the dinosaur from that set and figured out how to motorize it. This is not necessarily a bad thing, just a comment. The set does a good job of showing off the features of the new motors and remote. It is nice to see how one motor can perform multiple functions. In this case, the small motor makes both arms move and opens and closes the mouth of the dinosaur. When the mouth is completely open, it pushes the activation switch on the sound brick which emits the ?roar!? sound. Pretty cool. The ?XL Motor? handles the walking feature of the dinosaur. There is both forward and reverse. Forward works really well while the reverse just makes the dinosaur look like he is doing a Michael Jackson moon walk. (Wow, I never thought I would use Michael Jackson?s name in a LEGO Dinosaur set review!) It is almost like the dinosaur can?t get traction going in reverse. However, as noted previously forward works really well. This guy actually gets going at a pretty good clip. As you might expect, he kind of waddles like a duck since there is no articulation in the knees. It is a bit awkward but it works. The ?XL Motor? seems to kick out plenty of power. Overall, the design seems to be a mixed bag. The way the tail is attached seems to be an afterthought. The arms look to be too small. However, the walking mechanism and legs/feet are pretty cool as well as the head and mouth. I guess it is a reasonable effort to get people introduced to the parts and we?ll see designs improve as time goes on. Here are a few views of our new friend: But What About The AT-AT??? Of course, the real reason you are reading this is that you hope I will have some epiphany on how all this relates to the new walking AT-AT. Judging from the box on the AT-AT, it looks like we get one motor. I don?t see the remote which is a disappointment as I hope it is not controlled by a switch on the body and you either turn the AT-AT on or off. If that is the case, the first thing I am doing is scavenging the receiver and remote from this set to add to the AT-AT. Granted, it could be that it comes with a remote but is just not seen on the box. Also, the AT-AT box looks like one of the images shows that the head turns. I sure hope this is controlled separately as it would be really lame to not be able to control this independently from the walking feature. I?m kind of skeptical on the walking feature of the AT-AT. I suspect it will be rather cumbersome but hopefully I will be pleasantly surprised. Needless to say, this is all speculation but those are my initial thoughts based on this set. Overall Thoughts: It?s an OK set. Kind of pricy but I suspect a large part of that is due to the motors and remote. I haven?t built the other two models (they seem less interesting to me) but at least it has some variability. Also, you get a ton of different parts which can either be a good thing or bad thing depending on what you are looking for. The dinosaur is average. The color selection is marginal (black and lime green?) and the tail section is just lame. I appreciate it more for the mechanical functions and how the motorized parts work. It does do a good job of waking up my dog who seems pretty irritated by it. It is a nice set to show off to the neighbors or the endless caravan of my wife?s friends that seem to materialize out of nowhere. People are quickly impressed by it and then promptly move along once you start trying to explain how it all works. I?m a bit disappointed that the manual did not explain more about the remote and motor functions. I suspect that there is more than meets the eye and I?ll just have to play around with it to find out. It would be nice if LEGO had a website that showed all the cool functions of the motors and remotes so we fully understand the capabilities. Final Rating: 72% Build 9/10 (Pretty quick and fun. The mechanical part is cool) Functionality 6/10 (It is a Creator set so you have multiple builds. As far as it being a dinosaur, it?s just OK. Motorized parts are cool though.) Design 6/10 (Partly cloudy. Some things are cool, others are lame.) Parts 8/10 (New motors and remote are cool. Lots of varied parts included but nothing to write home about.) Price 7/10 (It is kind of expensive) Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 06:23 PM. Indexed	negative
Impressive review! Really clear photos too! Thanks. Dr. S.	positive
A very nice review, thanks dunamis. *y* I really don?t understand that color scheme, but the new motors?re very interesting. Well, that Dino is just mediocre to me.... I think that the new Technic Bulldozer is much more interesting.	neutral
Great Review Dunamis I hope you have as much fun with this as I have. One point yes they are new axles they have appeared in a few sets this year.	positive

Yes, the kids seem to love it (as you pointed out) and the wife still thinks I am crazy so it's all good. I read your review after I posted mine. Seems like we shared the same thoughts on a majority of it. I always think it is good to have multiple opinions on sets as it gives the community more data points to evaluate a given set.	positive

Thanks for the bonus review. I am still on the fence with this one so every opinion is good! dunamis, on Jul 14 2007, 07:41 AM, said: But What About The AT-AT??? In case you don't know, the AT-AT in the Dark Side Development Kit had a single motor and a moving head. It worked by the head simply swinging from side to side due to balence shifts.

Oh, is he ugly or what? I've never seen a dino that needed to go on a diet more then him. :-D But I'd get him for the pieces; all those lime-green pieces. *drools* But, meh, I'm not really in to Mindstorms, so I don't think I'd get this. But anyway, nice review, I now know exactly what he's like. KML	negative
Awesome reveiw, thanks! I gotta get this one!!! *y* *wub*	positive
I kind of like the design of this, but more importantly I really want to get my hands on the power functions motors and IR control system. I'd prefer the 8275 Technic Bulldozer, but there's no way I can stretch to the ?100 price tag, so I was thinking I would have to see if I could get a 4958 Monster Dino cheap in the January sales. Then two things happened today. Firstly I saw the Dino in Tescos reduced from ?70 to ?55. Then my wife said she'd buy it for me for Christmas. Wow! That's never happened to me before. I love my wife! *wub* Can't wait till Christmas now!	positive

If you really want the power functions the Bulldozer is better value as you get two large motors, two small motors and two receivers compared to the one in the Dino set alos watch Toysrus and argos both have had the Bulldozer for ?70-75 in there pre christmas sales usually for a week only I am hopeing they will be on sale soon as I want a Second Bulldozer to get some more motors.	neutral

I ended up buying a MISB set recently from a Lego collector who is clearing up his collection. Excellent set to get the IR remote and IR receiver and other motors without paying insane amounts for the bulldozer now. There is a quite a number of parts in Power miner lime green and 1x1 white teeth plate for the mouth and claws. The dino alone has 20 teeth in its mouth The glow in the dark "antennas" on the backbone of the dino is a nice touch as you can let him walk in the dark somewhat. I do agree with the reviewer, the box IS INSANELY HUGE!!! I don't think Lego wanted to show a 1:1 scale dino, they just wanted to promote the power function stuff as large as possible. Also, the remote is smaller than shown in the picture as the hand holding it I think is smaller.	positive
This is both my first set review and post about a Star Wars set- (even though I have been collecting them since '99). I got this one early this year so I thought I would post a review on it. Please bare with me- I am not a great photographer. So with that in mind, here goes!

Of course we get an extra stormtrooper: 75083 AT-DP Minifigs by whitesidewjw, on Flickr No new molds in this as far as I can tell, however these printed 4X4 domes are really great.

I like the two AT-DP Pilots and Agent Kallus is a well done minifig. I can complain about another storm trooper either Parts- 3/5- Other than the dome pieces I commented on before, there is really not any new parts in this. If you build space, star wars, or machinery, this will still be a welcome assortment. Experience of Build 4/5- This really was a fun build. It came together fast but was challenging enough for its target age group. Playability 5/5- This thing is much more sturdy than it looks. The legs take a little bit of effort due to the double locking hinges but hold together very well.This is a very minor complaint. Value 4/5- Typical- $49.99 for 500 pieces- I must admit I paid a little more than MSRP due to shipping but I can't complain about the value. Overall: 21/25- I really believe this is one of the best walkers that Lego has designed. The only changes I would make would be adding real control panels in the cockpit and it would be nice if lego made a real widow to fit in with these types of builds rather than a transparent tile over another plate. All in all, I would recommend this set and I hope the rest of the 2015 Star Wars sets are on par with this.	positive
Looks really nice. One complaint is the back it is a pitty that Lego didn't use any plates greebling there.	negative
Great review! Thanks for doing it. I'm a big fan of this set, the minifigures are good, as is the parts selection. I like the piece used in the cockpit to secure the minifigure in place. I would've liked to see some panels in the cockpit though rather than translucent red pieces, that said however they are useful pieces.	positive
Thanks for the review. Cannot wait for the 2015 sets.	positive
Pretty good first review! This looks pretty great, I probably won't be getting it due to budget constraints. (Bionicle) but still, very nice set. To me it kinda looks like the missing link between when the at-st evolved into the at-at. Also, I know the rebels stormtroopers get a lot of hate, but I really like them. Thanks for the review!	positive
Whats behind the printed 4x4 dome? Is that 2x4 yellow plate? Im planning to replace that.	neutral
Great first review! As a huge walker fan its great to get one thats not a redesign, or one of those tiny battlepack vechicles.	positive
Awesome! I am really looking forward to buy this, but is it really $50.00 US? I was hoping more around $30.00. Also, I was wondering how the hip section for the legs work, does it have a stiff turning axis to it?	positive

I built this set and I think the two rubber pieces holding the both sides of the face is a bit stretched out therefore making the set somewhat tight for entire top hatch to open and close. Does anyone have the same situation? Is this right? -------------- Never mind I got it! I built the back a stud too long! Edited by namioik, 29 December 2014 - 03:04 AM.	neutral
Thanks for the early review! How tall is this next to the most recent recreation of the AT-AT? I'm picturing the two of them standing next to each other looking silly due to the scale differences.	neutral
The legs are about 2" shorter than the AT-AT; its cockpit is a little larger than the AT-AT's "head;" it doesn't look out of place as an escort-type walker or heavy walker, especially as both are built in the same style, although if scale differences really bother you the most recent AT-ST is probably a better bet for you.

Great reveiw, shame on Lego for forgetting that they already made a AT-DP pilot helmet (Ezra's from the Phantom set) that didn't resort to needing a printed head.	negative
It's a different helmet. Ezra's is an Imperial Cadet Helmet (the same one he wears in "Breaking Ranks).	neutral
Thanks for the review and pics. This is a really nice looking walker. One question - how snug are the AT-DP drivers sitting in their seats? The cockpit looks good. Actually I'm not crazy about the AT-DP helmets on the show but I dig the minifigs! Good stuff. Awesome facial hair for Kallus!	neutral

hi, i need some help...when i atach the pod to the place where the legs are placed, the small piece that unites the pod to the legs is loos from the bottom, so the top of the walker just moves around freely, wich is different from every video review that i have seen (where they can rotate the pod but its not loose) the small piece that serves as the axis isnt staying locked on the bottom piece and i have reassembled it all and still its the same :\ help! edit: sorry, i found out what went wrong...didnt push hard enough :D Edited by mrpinache, 05 July 2015 - 12:10 AM.	neutral

Fantastic review, could easily be the year's best, and it's only January 1st! You've got a duplicated picture in the bit where the candy is being moved from the outside and through the barber shop.. ...and I was expecting a final B&W picture or two where the detective makes his report to the woman in red, and gets his reward (candy, of course) or she in turn reports back to her real boyfriend, the candy smuggler.

Firstly, Great Review ++++++ I was really on the fence on this one. This review has greatly changed my view on this modular. A definite buy for me. Love the interiors and the whole concept. The more i see it the more i see the little features which put this set apart or at least slightly different from the others. Of course great playability for the younger lot and i think a nice building to give any Lego City more character and colour...	positive
Great review Oky! I really love your introduction text. You put a lot of effort in this review, with lots of nice touches. Well done For me the set gets 4 out of 5. It's a great set, but there's something preventing me of giving it 5 stars.	positive
Great review Oky! I managed to pick this set up a few days ago and I must say, it might be my favorite modular yet for the feel alone. The pool hall, barbershop, and the detective's office itself are all wonderfully designed!	positive
Looking forward to picking up this set on Saturday :-) Nice review, love the tiny details and the printed parts.	positive
Nice review, thanks a lot. Managed to improve my opinion of the set a bit, but I'm still getting two to build larger buirldings as soon as we get the next 2x VIP points special	neutral
TheLazyChicken, on 01 January 2015 - 06:14 PM, said: Great review! The intro was great, but I'm still not convinced on this one. The height seems too small for comparison with the rest of the modulars. The play features are ok but I wish it would have been taller. Totally agree with you, the height does seem rather small. Also 2x buildings on a 32x32 base-plate with a lots of spare studs behind the buildings are these buildings 12 studs in width?. It still looks great style wise, however this might be a set i buy and look at it after i have built it & regret the amount of $$$ i have spent on it. $239 for us Aussie's .

Thank you for the review, it was very interesting and changed my opinion of the set, I'm now considering a future purchase ^^. Just one question: The mirror is on cardboard? I was hoping for it to be a window piece with a mirror on one side.. I hope it's not the same cardboard we had on some of the early Harry Potter sets or the element won't last long	neutral
Thank you for the great review of this set. I'm also curious for the backside of the mirror.	neutral

Thank you for the amazing and really well-readable review! Makes me want to get the set even more!	positive
Lego's affiliation with six wheelers go back a long way. I think the first one was released in 1981, more than 25 years ago. This year, Lego added another one to the family, Mars Mission's "Rhino 1", as its title sounds... It's been a while since i've bought and opened a large box, so maybe this isn't a surprise to most of you, but the box does not open at the front, as with many larger sw boxes, but at the side. The two printed seals(or whatever people call them) have gone as well, being replaced by one larger print in the middle of side... the box also isn't as thick as a large sw box, like the sandcrawler... The general size is, however, still quite large. PICT0001.JPG 281.91K 102 downloads the back side shows the Mars Mission theme sets... eccept the Rhino! I guess it shows this set will be released as a TRU exclusive or something, only to show up in Legoland shops and maybe Lego shops... It's a shame really, because this is by far the best set of the theme. PICT0002.JPG 285.42K 89 downloads When you open the front cover, you see a larger picture picture of the Rhino. Obviously, it seems to be some sort of multifunctional truck. i think the basic function is to drive around and explore. For that it has a drilling device and six giant wheels. PICT0003.JPG 273.7K 82 downloads The set comes with two instruction books. i'm afraid to say they did not resolve the gray/black colors issue. Colorwise, the real thing does not look like the instruction book because of it... PICT0004.JPG 302.63K 75 downloads The Rhino looks really big because of the six giant wheels. I guess it's more or less the same size as M-tron's Magnetiser with the big difference between the two being that the wheels have been turned around, creating a unique wheel design for a Lego model PICT0285.JPG 290.59K 83 downloads PICT0277.JPG 286.26K 80 downloads the wheels look very cool, even though the first couple of wheels stand a bit closer to each other. Don't know why that is. hm... |-/ and they could have used a bit more body, but the design is pretty good. i know, "Armagheddon" isn't far away... |-/ PICT0292.JPG 216.75K 70 downloads The suspension of the wheels is a bit flimsy. sure, it allows the truck to move around in a more realistic way than the old sets, but it's not as flexible as some older sets, like sw's CTT. Nor do the wheels have much body. the black bars you see on top of the wheels are more "window dressing" then functional... PICT0293.JPG 244.78K 88 downloads The over all shape of the Rhino is kinda "bulky", it looks more like a beatle than a rhino, if you're asking me. It has three major sections, but i wouldn't call it a modular building though... The cockpit is the first section. It's spacious and detailed. PICT0290.JPG 262.77K 0 downloads PICT0291.JPG 299.75K 87 downloads The cockpit hangs down from a weird angle. it's attached to a large vertical technic brick that is part of the Rhino's main structure, so it's not a seperate spaceship, which is a shame... oh well... you can't have it all, i guess... PICT0301.JPG 291.13K 78 downloads ah yes... stickers all over the place, but they're cool. the mid section of the Rhino dominates the basic shape of the model. It's as if those two large white parts form a strong and thick shield, protecting whatever is inside from whatever is outsde. PICT0007.JPG 213.22K 67 downloads unfortunately, there is nothing inside. it's extra space needed to house the spaceship. That's really a shame; a command center of some kind could have given the rhino a bit more "panache". PICT0286.JPG 251.35K 87 downloads However, what's really great, is the way in which they fit together: one side has an orange 1x2 plate that fits in between two white 1x3 plates of the other side, creating yet another unique shape for a Lego model. But again, it's a shame they didn't do more with this section... X-O PICT0283.JPG 287.75K 82 downloads The third and last section is a platform for a space ship. PICT0299.JPG 289.5K 77 downloads PICT0287.JPG 199.78K 75 downloads The platform itself isn't really special. no details, no stickers,... it's just a skeleton to carry the spaceship, nothing more nothing less. No, your space ship doesn't fall off, even if you rotate the platform into a launch position, pushing the weight of the ship backwards. In fact, the position of the ship onto the platform is so solid, it's kinda difficult to imagine how this ship flies off. |-/ The ship on the other hand, is pretty cool. It's all sorts of things at the same time it seems. It transports two aliens, but also a small car that reminds me of the small sets of Spacepolice 2, blacktron 2,... PICT0295.JPG 307.4K 85 downloads PICT0298.JPG 268.13K 75 downloads PICT0294.JPG 276.84K 76 downloads the shuttle reminds me of a Star trek shuttle and i think it needs some modding, but i do think it looks pretty nice. sure, the cockpit is a bit too low, a pilot needs to lay down instead of sitting down and the dropping mechnism, if there is one at all isn't all that brilliant either... The main structure is a bit too technical for me. I prefer actual parts with studs, not these Lego technic bars and pins. PICT0006.JPG 224.43K 74 downloads the crew: PICT0276.JPG 239.43K 70 downloads ah yes, there's also this green plastic residu. think they are supposed to be the aliens... and there's also this weird alien craft, but i didn't bother to build that... *sad* GOOD: *wub* Great, innovative design, lots of potential, i even like the colors *sweet* Lots of playability it's a big, attractive model; i don't see any weak spots in the design that could compromise stability or structural integrity. NOT SO GOOD: |-/ too many technic parts, some sections on the model, like the gun and the drilling device are a bit to flimsy I'd say 7.5-8.5/10 Price: 750 Danish Crowns, about 105euro	positive
Thanks very much. I love it *wub* . It needs tweaking, but isn't that half the fun? Incidentally, when people were calling it Rhino, I thought it was just a reference to Captain Scarlet. Seeing the stickers in the middle made me realise my mistake. Buy! Buy! Buy!	positive
Thanks dude. This is a great set. Can you please take more pictures? Thanks	positive
seems like they infuse system sets with more technic bars. must be that technic isn't selling too well and they want to educate ppl how cool technic can be. :-P it's quite apparent when even the small bike needed technic frame.	neutral

Thanks for that very interesting review, snefroe1. *y* That vehicle looks really nice, with a lot of playability, but too much Technic brick construction for my liking.

Great review, wonderfully detailed. Don't care for the ship at all. It's that 'technic under a hollow shell' thing like the CTT. If it wasn't for the figures, I would have hated it, and nothing about these figures excites me. I'll end up finding the least number of sets possible to provide at least one of each figure for the general population collection and skip the rest (unless they do as I expect and flop here, thus leading to huge discounts). I like this set ... at half off. ;-)	positive
The Life on Mars theme was so much better, with the aliens dominating Mars instead of the humans. And the aliens were so much better, with their own names etc. Good times.

I think the Life on Mars series was great. Although I didn't click until the line was gone that the red hangar on the alien base was for the red mech, and same with the blue one. Man, I was gutted when I realised that, I want those mechs! However, the base was great, with the small mech and the flying crafts. Could the LoM mechs have been the spark of life for Exo-force? 8-?

Lego 41062 Elsa's Sparkling Ice Castle Lego managed to get a Frozen licensed set in the new wave of Disney Princess sets. However, I'm VERY surprised by the size. It's a $40 set and comes in a small Friends-style box (roughly 12"x12" size) - I almost didn't see it on the shelf when I was looking for it because it's so small. I mean, I know it's only $40 but it's a friggin' CASTLE. And why did Lego only make this a smaller set? If they'd made a $200 Frozen castle they still would have sold every one they could produce. They made big Harry Potter Hogwarts sets and those sure sold. And have you SEEN the toys in the Frozen section of stores? HUGE playsets for Barbie-sized dolls. But I suppose I'm getting the cart before the horse here, reviewing before I've even opened the box. So..... Name: Elsa's Sparkling Ice Castle Set Number: 41062 Pieces: 292 Price: $39.99 Minifigs: 3 Theme: Disney Princess Year of Release: 2015 Links: Bricklink Peeron Brickset The Box The front of the box is standard Lego fare, other than the large Anna and Elsa in the bottom right corner. Oh, and surprisingly, nowhere on the box is the normal minifig lineup. The only way to know what characters are included is to look at the set pictures. The 1:1 This set uses one of the minidolls as the actual size sample. That's probably not a bad choice since the minidolls are not nearly as well known as a minifig. The Back On the back, the play features are shown in insets around a rear view of the castle. Like Friends sets, you also have an array of play accessories. The Seals Is this standard on 2015 sets or is this specific to this set? I've never seen 3 tape seals on a set. Even huge modulars or Technic sets only have 2, so 3 on a set this small seems excessive. Perhaps Lego expects people to try to steal the dolls? If so, why bother with extra tape? A tiny pocketknife makes quick work of the tape so the third strip doesn't even slow you down. The Contents In the box are 2 instruction booklets (bent), a white plate, a sticker sheet, and 3 numbered bags of parts. The Stickers These are very hard to photograph since they're shiny. I mean polished chrome shiny. Those dark lines across the corners are not really there, they're reflections of my ceiling. The Manual Backs The back of one booklet has a Friends "Win!" girl. The other has an ad for the Lego Disney Princess website. That site is SO girly there's even sparkles following your mouse cursor around. So I didn't stay too long or look too deeply. The Sample Page The interior pages of the manuals are on lavender backgrounds. It's standard Lego instructions with part callouts and insets when needed. The Build, 1 The first thing you build is Anna, but I'm not showing that yet. Then you build this little picnic scene. It's tiny but effective, and nice to have something not icy in the set since the movie has the "In Summer" song for Olaf. I'm curious what's in that sandwich though - green and pink? After the picnic is the Olaf build, but I'll save him for later too. The Build, 2 Next is this small sleigh. It has an amazing amount of style for something so small. The curved front and decorative whips on the back make it look sleigh-like instead of blocky. But come on, it already had pink accents, are the pink flowers really necessary? Technically, yes, so the whips can mount to them, but still, it's just over-girly for my taste. The Build, 3 The sleigh needs a ramp to help it rocket along (for a couple inches, at least). The ramp starts like this, with a hidden lime green jumper plate that gets a cookie on it. I couldn't remember anything in the movie like that, so I asked my wife and she couldn't either. A hidden cookie under a hill? The Build, 4 After putting the tilting 2x8 onto the base and adding decorations, this is the result. A lime green bucket holding a pair of ice skates, a flower (in the snow, really?), green and white round studs that I assume are supposed to be grass and snow? The Build, 5 The sleigh looks huge sitting on top of the tiny hill, but it actually works pretty well. Assuming you're on a smooth surface like a table, you can give the sleigh a little nudge and it'll shoot down the ramp and a few inches across the table. The unevenness of the slopes vs the blue tiles holds the sleigh in line well, and the bumps in the slopes don't seem to hamper anything. The Build, 6 Moving on to bag 2.... man that's a lot of colors in this base already. And I'm already starting to feel like there's trans-blue cheese thrown around randomly. The Build, 7 Continuing (and rotating), some steps and even more colors thrown in. Magenta? In Elsa's ice palace? I sure don't remember any of that... The Build, 8 Wait, seriously? An ice cream stand in the castle? That is what the magenta is for? I kinda actually like the looks of it, but it doesn't fit the set. The Build, 9 Spinning back around, now there's a light aqua spiral staircase added along with a roof. This is where I'm really starting to wonder about Lego's thinking. Those light aqua stairs, and the light aqua 1x4 tiles, are exclusive to this set (as far as I know... it's possible some other 2015 sets use them, but nothing in Bricklink yet). Seems expensive (to produce) to me, when there's no huge reason to need them. Another blue for the tiles would have been fine. And the spiral stairs? Really? Elsa's castle is KNOWN for staircases, but NOT spiral ones! There should be a huge straight ice stairway out front or sweeping curved stairs inside, but not a spiral. The Build, 10 And now we finish the tree. Again, why? Where is there a tree next to Elsa's castle? And so weird... with ice hanging from green branches that have both snow and flowers on them. Huh? Did Lego watch a different movie? The Trans-Light Blue Bits Before looking at the upper level, a brief pause to look at some other parts. Here's the 1x2x5 brick in trans-light blue and the 2x4x6 rock panel in glitter trans-light blue. Do those look like the same blue to you? And again, ANOTHER unique part for this set. Why do those rock panels need to be glitter, when Lego made the same panel in trans light blue in 2013 and 2014 for SuperHeroes, Friends, and Chima sets? Apparently Disney REALLY wanted glitter, because there are a bunch of trans-glitter parts in the new Princess sets. There's trans-neon green cones for Jasmine; Ariel, Jasmine, and Sleeping Beauty all get glitter trans purple cones. So there's a bunch of new glitter parts for 2015. The Build, 11 Back to building - time to add the upper level. We get a bedroom with a decent bed, although stickered. The Build, 12 The other side of the bedroom has some little accessories. Perfume and a crown I assume? The Build, 13 Time for walls and a roof. I like the small white macaroni bricks for a wall, but what's with the lavender fence piece in the center? I'll grant that it looks nice (a common white fence would have been a little boring), but it's ANOTHER unique piece to this set. The Build, 14 The very top of the castle is built separately. Not a whole lot to say here other than why is there a torch in an ICE CASTLE? The Finished Castle Once the roof is put on, the castle is done. And that big purple star on top says everything to me about the styling. It just doesn't look like modern Lego to me; it looks like this should be an old Belville fairy tale set from around 1999. If I saw a photo of just the castle with no figs (or picnic blanket), I'd assume that's what it was. The Oops, Not Actually Done Yet Accessories At the end, there's a few bits left to add. There are these dark purple skis (yup, another unique part) in the lower level. Let me tell you, they're a pain to get into that location, at least with my big man hands. More Accessories The top level gets a stickered book. The sticker has a nice castle image on it that is, while not quite exactly the castle from Disney World, VERY Disney-looking. I actually had to google and see if that's the castle they use in their logo. Nope, but it's the same style. The Leftovers There are a LOT of extra parts in this. That's almost 10% of the part count in the set right there! They are pretty useful overall though. It's great to have an extra "carrot" and brown "branch" for Olaf, since you know those will get lost as he's played with. The Figs Finally, the reason for the set. Let's face it, the castle set is just an excuse to make these figures. And they're GREAT. I mean just fantastic. The print on them is just such a good match to the real characters. Compare to the cartoon version from the front of the box. Elsa's hair is a little darker than the cartoon, but overall these are just dead on. If I had to pick out a flaw, it's the "spell" Elsa is holding. It's too bad she can only shoot it forward with her arm down like that. It'd be nice to have the end of the splash part bent 90 degrees so she can have her arm forward and the spell shooting forward too. Oh, one other thing. The minidoll heads don't press down tight to the body like minifig heads do. There's still exposed neck. It looks nice, but it means Elsa's cape can swing around. The Fig Backs Elsa's cape is glittery on the back and you can see the removable bow in her hair. The Full Set One final issue. When you put Anna on the sleigh, her cape doesn't have enough flexibility (since it's a wraparound kind) and so it folds out funny. That's why on the back of the box it shows her standing on the back of the sleigh with Elsa in the seat. Edit: How on earth did I forget to comment on those orange flowers to each side of the castle? I'm pretty sure Elsa did NOT have any flowers blooming outside her castle! The Conclusion Hm. I really wanted to like this set, but I just can't quite bring myself to. It feels like Lego pulled a random castle design from the files then redid it into white and trans blue to look icy and allow a Frozen tie in set. The figs are great, but the castle isn't. I guess the real castle in the movie would be a boring set and this one has play features, but it just is too different for my taste. The Ratings Value: 7/10 - $40 for less than 300 parts is high (especially when so many of the parts are tiny, but on the other hand there's a LOT of rock panels and 1x2x5 trans blue panels), but the figs help save it. Design: 4/10 - Not one of Lego's best. Not as bad as the lows in the 90s, but not a great set. Minifigs: 10/10 - Possibly even a 12/10. They ARE the reason to buy the set . Playability: 8/10 - There are a bunch of play features, but they actually detract from the design, so I had to knock off a couple points. Parts: 7/10 - A bunch of impractical unique parts (how often do you need dark purple skis or a lavender fence piece?) but also a bunch of nice parts if you wanted to make your own icy scene. Overall: 7/10 - A great bunch of figs, but I'd recommend not bothering with the manuals. Just use the parts to build your own castle that's better.	neutral
Very nice review, mostlytechinc! Once I saw this set I was interested in it for the colours and pieces...thanks for this review to shed more light onto it!	positive
Isn't getting parts in new colors a good thing? It is a shame there is only this one set, I think TLG could make a whole subtheme out of Frozen. I do agree that they overuse lavender and magenta, I don't see why every girl set has to have these sort of colors instead of what would be accurate to the source material .	negative

Sure, new colors are good. But cramming a bunch of oddball ones into a single set where they don't even make sense just seems financially unwise for Lego. I'd rather have seen a larger set than light aqua spiral staircase parts. Or lavender tiny fences. Lego made the stairs in dark purple last year for Rapunzel's Tower, and those probably would have been ok here. Or make them in a more useful color like WHITE.	neutral
Thanks for the review mostlytechnic. I too wish they had done a real castle for this set, it certainly deserved it. My sons and I figure they could have used the old rock monster mold from Rock Raiders in white for the missing snow beast. I will pick it up though for the figs and unique pieces.	positive
Thanks for the review! I have the same opinion about the design, looks like Belville. I bought it on Legostore Orlando December 30th. It was impressive. My wife saw them putting on shelf, 8 or 10 boxes. She ran and grabbed the last one! The girls faces around it was indescribable, mix of ecstasy and afraid to loose it. It happened in less than 2 minutes. My 7 yo girl didn't want it. She likes the dresses but hates the movie. Prefers Lego Movie. But my 2 yo girl who never saw the movie grabbed it for good, and we bought it. Lego will sell it like water, but I do not understand why a set so small. It is the WORST SET DESIGN since the introduction of Lego Friends. My 7 yo has more than 50 Lego friends minifigures, all the Lego fiends stores and concluded that the castle had a terrible design. She is 7!! Let's be honest, Lego should have released this sets months before this Christmas and is loosing a perfect opportunity to sell a decent set, with much more pieces. I am wondering if they are going to make another set with the same characters. At the end,. It is just for the minifigures.	negative
When I first saw the pictures, I didn't realize that this set had so much color barf going on in it. Also, there is a bunch of stuff that does not fit in with the movie, and it is pricey. The minifigures are nice, but no Kristoff or Sven. I thought about getting this, but this review is pushing me towards no.	negative
I wish Elsa had more of a white hairpiece rather than blonde. But it could be worse. Not a bad set overall, although Olaf doesn't look right without the twigs on his head. Anna is a really nice and accurate fig.	positive
I think the trans-glitter blue panels can be icy or snowy just fine. I'm sure that's WHY they used them for this set. Now, if you're looking for realism (like the photos in your sig seem to be), it might be tougher. But I've been thinking about using those big glittery panels to make a waterfall-type scene.	positive
I'm literally of the exact opposite opinion to OP here. I love the structure and the parts (this is a fantastic little parts pack that I'll be snagging more of when I find it again)...but I've no use for the figures (not a big Disney Princess fan). It's all about the parts. This set is freaking amazing! :D	positive
Very nice review indeed and I also can't wait for the release of this set. It will be a superb wonderful addition to the LEGO Disney Princess theme.	positive

There is a very simple reason for the flowers and green-leaved trees; you should remember from the movie it was actually summer when Elsa set of the eternal winter… The orange flowers do bother me, from a design point of view; I would have liked it better if they were a pink/purple/blue/white color. Same goes for the leafy bits; they could have used the pink/purple ones they are gonna use in the Elves sets. It would have been fantastic if they had given us WHITE leafy bits (like snow covered branches)! I'm sure loads of us could use those in our MOCs!

This seems to be one of those sets that LEGO really should have released a month before Christmas, it likely then would have been toy of the year 2014,	positive
I'm trusting there is something else going on behind the scenes because this should have been a huge set and released in November of 2014 at the latest. Maybe we will see more and better Frozen sets when the post-Christmas consumer spending wave hits. Edited by m0dulo, 13 January 2015 - 10:03 PM.	neutral

That was a great review with loads of excellent pictures. The set is better than I thought. I want to buy one of the new sets as I would love a blue Batman, but they are so expensive for Australians. I love the new pumpkin heads. The story involved more mini-fig cruelty; excellent! I also liked the scarecrow/crow joke. :-D (One request; please don't say lines like "To the Batcopter" next time.

Most of what I remember about the old Batman TV show actually comes from the movie as I own that. (Mum bought it for me.) I tend to put in on if I have friends over and I am drunk enough. I like the darker side of Batman only, and thus anything that is against the idea that Batman is as big a loon as the guys that he hauls in I don't like. Joel schumaker's movies fall well within that category. hinckley39, on Jul 18 2007, 04:51 PM, said: The crow is my favorite part. :-$ I'm happy to be swaying you over to the side of mini-fig suffering >:-) It sucks that your pricing is so different over there.

When i first saw pic's of the bi-plane i wasn't sure if i liked it or not, but after seeing it in more detail i gotta say i love the thing *wub* It's a great plane with so many good aspect's, it's also the perfect counter vehicle for the new bat-plane. For me though the best part of the set has got to be the new pumpkin heads, those are just beautiful and i cant wait to get lots of them.	positive
Nice review. The Batcopter is pretty neat, but I prefer Scarecrow's bi-plane. Quote Batsy: We needed to wrap this review up so I used my Baterang. Bianca: Is that really what it's called? Batsy: Beats me... Nooo... it's Batarang.	neutral
Great review! Funny as allways! The comic was just a hell lot of fun. It really had me laughing. I would love to have this set but the price is just to high here, far worse than I had expected. I'll be better off buying the Battank, which is much better priced. Actually there is almost no price difference between The Batcopter and The Battank here *wacko*	negative

What about the cartoon??? Batman: The Animated Series will always be the definitive Batman to me. The two Tim Burton movies were okay (they haven't aged well though), and I really dig what Christopher Nolan is doing with the new movies. Christian Bale did a fine job in "Batman Begins" ... but when I watch the movie, I hear Kevin Conroy's voice in my head. The cartoon rocked. And as much as I enjoyed the Justice League Unlimited cartoon, my biggest complaint was always: more Batman please!!	neutral
Excellent hinckley *y* *y* *y* ! Looks like a nice set - I like the mix of dark Batman-pieces and a bit lighter Badmans-pieces. Batmans new blue headpiece looks a bit off though.

Out of nowhere this set appeared at my local TRU. Hadn't been expecting this one for a while, so a nice surprise. *sweet* Firstly the box. Nice pic on the front. Good selection of minifigs. The officer and pilot look cool with their dark blue trousers. A new R2 unit as well. Don't remeber this in the film, but great to have one in a new colour. *wub* Back of the box shows some of the ship's nifty features. First thing you notice when you open the box, is the awesome selection of bricks. This makes a for a great parts pack. Loads of unusual red and dark red pieces. It's so refreshing to see a Star Wars set that isn't predominantly grey. There are also two instruction booklets. As soon as you open the first booklet you hit an error. Why would I want two Obi-Wans? :-| It's also at this point that you come across a big disappointment. On the box you get a flesh Qui-Gon. What is actually in the box is an EpIII Obi-Wan. Come on LEGO - why change it? |-/ All the figures look impressive in the flesh despite the BIG mistake. Once I started the build it progressed rapidly. Red pieces seem to be a lot easier to find. Lots of clever techniques. Quite a few Technic elements get used at the start. It reminded me of building a Technic set from the 80s at times. Here is the main body half way through the build. The landing mechanism is a nice touch. Its not fully retractable, but still folds away nicely. You find the ship keeps tipping over as you build it despite the feet, as it's only at the end thay it all becomes evenly balanced at both ends. Here the feet are extended. You can also see the yellow knob that rotates the radar on top of the ship. Landing gear up viewed from the front. Here are the radar. A great collection of dishes. They spin easily with little friction. Here is the ship at the half way point. The front works well with the top flipping up to squeeze in the pilot. More to come... :-)	positive

7665 Review Part 2 The second half of the build goes quicker than the first. Once you start to add the engines, the ship really begins to take shape. The main body of the ship has a few surprises hidden away under a removable cover. Inside you get some retracting guns, a storage box, a little shuttle and space for a droid and figure. Here is everything you can fit inside. The guns are concealed behind the side vents. Pushing them forward causes the vents to open. Closed: And open: The final feature is the passenger area/escape pod. Inside is plenty of space for two figures. The pod cleverly attaches by pushing the front section of the ship forward, sliding the pod in, then returning the front. Everything locks together and is held securely in place by an elastic band. :-) Here's a couple of pictures of the final model. It's not the most beautiful creation ever, but it is an excellent representation of the ship from the film. The angular shape actually suits a LEGO build well. There's one more useful feature. The whole ship can be safely and comfortably picked up by two ball ended Technic pins towards the back end. It balances well at this point and does allow you to swoosh the ship around much more easily. This was the most enjoyable Star Wars build I've had in a long time. Everything progresses nicely with almost no repetitive bits. The ship looks good and is also HUGE! *sweet* Compare it to the 6211 ISD and you'll see it's only fractionally smaller. When I first saw pictures of this on the internet I thought it looked OK. Once you see it for real it is much more impressive. For ?69.99 in the UK I'm not complaining. It's the best value Star Wars set of the year so far. To conclude: Pieces: 9/10 Minifigures: 7/10 (would be a 9 apart from the stupid Qui-Gon/Obi-Wan head error) Playability: 8/10 Originality: 9/10 Set Design: 8/10 Overall: 8.2/10 The box says this is a Limited Edition set (whatever that means). So if you're planning to get it I'd suggest you grab it at the first opportunity. I'm glad I did! X-D Edited by Kernow, 22 July 2007 - 10:56 PM.	positive

I guees that they're on dark waters. You can always put some trans blue and trans clear 1x1 round plates, no? I tried that technique to make the lava (using trans red and trans orange plates), it looks neat. Regarding the human soldier thing Yoda mentioned, it's quite weird.

The upper plate with clip for the door is a little high, on top of a dark gray 1x1 brick. So if you want the door to operate well you have to place it like that. I just put the clip under that brick, a very easy fix, so my door now is lower which looks better IMHO, and no sneaky skelly can crawl along under it.... X-D	neutral

(well the front door anyway :-D ) The main control room? :-D Again these are stickers on a tinted clear panel and on the slope |-/ I have no idea what this is meant to be! :-D Finally 2 shots of the full set! *wub* Well over all i really like this set and think it is great value for money. The minifigs alone would set you back more than the cost of this set. The build time was a good 2 hours or so and was good fun! The snowspeeder is not as good as the second snowspeeder and no where near as good as the first in my opinion, but i did love that first one. The k-3po fig is perfect and it is good to be getting more droids that aren't r2-d2 and c-3po. It is a shame about the stickers but that is the price of keeping the cost down i suppose (the only printed part in the whole set is the snowspeeder/x-wing windscreen). I will definately be getting atleast another 3 of this great set. 9/10	positive

Mutley , did you bought it @ TRU? - Are there any other sets? exept of Hoth Base , and is there the republic cruiser?	neutral
I thought after the King's Royal Castle uproar about stickers, Lego would have gone back to printed bricks. Obviously, it is all about costs these days and not about keeping people happy.	negative

The smaller the boxes, the more chance I will have getting them in my suitcase ;) I have to say, I am very glad we are now not getting a 1:1 ratio between the numbers used prices in USA vs UK (e.g. it is not longer ?49.99 = $49.99) :)	positive
Excellent set. The snowtroopers are just amazing (most Lego imperial troops are really good). However, it's sad that except from Luke, all the rebels have the same face which is what is more the most unexpressive that you can find. For the rest, the quality looks excellent. The snowspeeder is far better than the first they realized (but only one thing: it looks a bit too white to me. I think I remember they were grey and orange rather than white in the film) and the Echo Base door is really cool. Really nice set. Edited by Lord Beckett, 02 August 2007 - 04:14 PM.	positive

Man the stickers on everything are really starting to irritate me a lot. I'm not sure I like the white 3P0, in a set that is primarily made up of whites. Doesn't stand out enough. The snowspeeder looks a lot shorter than previous versions. Steve	negative
Jim, great review as always. You convinced me to get this one of these days, although not a to priority. Any comments on which functions can be converted to PF and how well they work?	positive
Thanks for a great review. I've got a pile of TRU and Lego credit I wanna spend and was thinking about getting this (since I got a sneak peak of your review in the Academy) but it's not here in the US yet. Too bad. Wonder when it'll hit? I do disagree about the manuals though. I find the thinner, stapled manuals easier to use than single large square-bound ones since they lay flatter when open. Have any links to the prelim photos of the front end? I don't remember seeing that and was curious how different it looked.	positive

Really thorough review, Jim. I am super jealous that you have 2 of these and I have none, with no opportunity to get one any time soon.	positive
Great review. I see now why the B model is so popular. I wonder though, on the car, if instead of the panels for the rear spolier (or wing) if they could have used studded panels and maybe layer them to give the appearance of, ie: a three element rear wing. I won't mention the front lights. If I had the money I would buy it for the B model. H	positive
Great review Jim and stunning pictures	positive
I think I read somewhere that the US will not get this set or the motorcycle until August 2015. That means the flagship most likely won't be in August but even later in the year... nothing Bricklink can't solve though.	neutral
Great review with fantastic pictures. As for the model, I'm glad that they chose to make it less pretty - real Le Mans prototypes are rarely a sight to behold. It is function and aerodynamics over form. I would, however, have preferred more realism for the sake of learning: - The front shouldn't open like that - instead it should be easy to remove the whole front cover, leaving the suspension easy to work on. - The aero seems to be realistic, except for the rear end where there's no indication of a venturi channel. This should have been easy to include. - There is no fuel tank, nor fixed fuel connector right behind the cabin. - There are no air jacks! Seriously!? This is one of the most unique features of a race car like this... and LEGO forgot about them. Instead they automated two functions which are manual on a real race car. - The top cars at Le Mans are hybrids with ingenious systems. I would have loved to see the front wheels connected to some kind of spinning apparatus indicating a kinetic energy recovery system. If I get this set... I'm going to make some modifications.	positive
This is a mega review. You've taken the right pictures and the video demonstrations of the mechanisms really help get the good points of the set across. What's more amazing is that the review still feels very concise and to the point. You've actually convinced me to put this set on my list and not just as a decent parts pack.

I'm not sure air jacks are the feature that will have people fawning over this set, and pneumatics are being covered rather well later in the year ... but I agree with everything else, most notably removable front and rear bodywork (the removable engine cover on 8674 would be a good starting point here) and the inclusion of some nod towards a hybrid system. It's also worth remembering the preliminary design did have the Big Honking Fin (BHF) that is mandatory on all current prototypes, so maybe when that was removed any trace of a tunnel or diffuser went with it. On the subject of steering wheels, all modern prototypes actually have left or right hand drive. The regulations demand that both LMP1 and LMP2 cars are nominally capable of seating two people. Of course in practise the "extra seat" is taken up by the hybrid system in LMP1 and electronics/extra cockpit access in LMP2. However this doesn't change the fact that it would be easy to link the steering wheel to the HoG/front axle. Edited by Jay Psi, 12 March 2015 - 09:55 PM.	positive

Ted, have you described your photography setup somewhere? I love the crisp quality of your pictures.	positive
Great review. I think it look like a great set, both A and B. However the panels are the only thing I would need, but still a great looking set.	positive
Great review Jim.. I have been sitting on the fence about if I will get this set for a while but I saw one built for the first time at a local brick show on the weekend. It definitely looks better in real life than any pics. I have decided to buy one	positive
A great review Jim. Just finished building this set. A couple of steps required abit of lego stressing to get together when there was an easier way. Just made it into RC ( almost finished it in LDD) which was easy to do as it has so much room for nearly any configuration of motors and not have them showing. A great set. Edited by jono.rocky, 13 March 2015 - 10:53 AM.	positive
Wonderful review, but I am still not sold on the set. If we get more sets with the bright green I might be tempted to get it, but until then it is too few parts in bright green (too few different types, not the number of pieces) to be able to use that colour effectively in making MOC's.	neutral
True, but I must say I like the new colour, very 'fresh' looking compared to the rather dullish regular green. Can't wait to build MOCs with it.	positive
I have been waiting for this set since the pictures for the toy fairs eirlier in the year and I am glad to say I am not disapointed. First the price it is not cheap at ?99.99 but I guess that is typical for a set with this amount of electronics in it.There is no parts count and I have not had time to add up the 2 pages of contents to get a figure. First the box standard flip top with large internal picture and rip to open lid. inside There are no numbered bags in this set which I prefer I like to open all the bags and put all the parts in the box before building. Next is a picture on the electronics 2 XLmotors as lego describe them and 2 standard motors. 2 IR receivers and 1 IR transmitter I know these have been discussed before but I really like the thought that has gone into the transmitters/receivers each receiver has 2 outputs to corespond with the 2 controls on transmitter they also have a choice of 4 channels so one transmitter can control up to 8 independant motors by changing the channel switch. The transmitter also has a neat motor direction switch so you can configure the transmitter operation. The set comes with three manuals 1 is the main drive mechanism 2 is the cab and engine and 3 is the attachments front and back. There is also the now standard parts list in the back of the third manual. There is no alternative model instructions despite the pictures of one on the box however there is a reference to the technic website on the back of the box but at the moment the page only has an advert saying the set is to be released on 1st September so I guess I will have to wait untill then to see if the instructions will be online. The build is fairly straight forward the main chassis is studless, the next picture shows the motors mounted into the chassis and the drive for the shovel and claw. It also shows the V6 technic engine. This next picture shows the IR receivers mounted on the back. The battery box slots into the back and can be easily slid out with the removal of two pins which is useful because I can imagine I will need to change the batteries on a regular basis. The next 2 picture are of the completed model Overall I was very happy with the finished dozer the functions work really well and as I have the monster dino I have used a second transmitter so I dont have to touch the channel switch, I have included some video On my Brickshelf page. Unfortunately this set does suffer from some quality issues for example moulding marks on the plates, colour diferences, some of the pins not finished properly, some pins were very stiff and quite hard to push into the holes but the worst issue was an axle that would not turn freely in a hole which just adds extra friction into the system. I am glad to see some studded technic in this set I much prefer sets that use both varieties of technic beam. There are only 2 Fairings which is a great improvment over recent sets if TLC had tried to make the bulldozer shovel with fairings this would have been a complete disaster. Marks for the set 8/10 for price with the number of motors I expected it to be greater. 9/10 for fun my kids love this type of set that does something when finished. 6/10 for quality TLC really need to work on this one. 8/10 overall I would definately get a second one if I see it in the sales. Feel free to post questions but I will be on holiday next week. More pics and Videos available HERE	positive
Thank you vey much for this review. I do have some questions; 1. What are the white clutches geared into? 2. Is the engine geared to one or both drive motors? 3. How well does it go on carpet? 4. Can it doze without breaking the blade?	positive
Excellent review, thanks! What is the cost in US? Not released in my area. The shovel is obviously my favorite area, it looks detailed and strong. I love the treads, because I need them to move the 4 x 4 barrels on my super-scaled turbolaser turret. Very good pics too. What color are the treads? I never had them. They are plastic or rubber?

Ah man...I wanted to review it with mine. Oh well. Here in the U.S. it cost $150 and has 1355 pieces total. The pins and axles did seem a bit difficult in putting them into place. A problem I have been having is the batterys are done after about 4 hours of play, which I really wish they would last longer :-( . Overall it is a stupendous set and it is really nice to see our old friend the studs make a return!	neutral
Thanks for the review, it really looks cool. Too bad it's soo expensive. :-/ I must admit that I prefer the 8421 mobile crane for more or less the same price, the design is more "sexy". *wub*	neutral
Thanks for the great review of this set. I've been looking forward to it as well and I am excited about the wireless controls like the Dino. I too am curious if this set has been released here in the US. I was told that it was a Sept 1 release. I agree about the battery life. My Dino set lasted about 4 hours too.	positive
Thanks for the review! This looks like a great set, and with four motors, two receivers and a remote control I wouldn't say it is overpriced. It is still a lot of money though..... If my scholarship permits it I will seriously consider buying this set.	positive
I can't wait to get my paws on this dozer! :-$ The new motors look very interesting and I It will be fun to see which possibilities they have in any future MOC:s.	positive
Nice review, Ickelpete. Thank you.	positive
Ickel, thanks for that awesome review. It makes me want to buy this set. I think it'd go just swell with the Mobile Crane. The fact that it has all the motors and such is awesome, I can foresee using those for a lot of other functions for MOCs. And, well I'm a fan of treads. You can never have enough treads :-D Hm, would you be able to tell us, perhaps after a test or two what kind of weight this beast can push around? Thank you!	positive
Hi, many thanks for this review, photos and videos.

The new small Technic sets have incredible functionality for their size, and this one is no exception. With only 106 parts this crane can roll, extend, rotate, lift (and hold in any position) and has working stabilisers! The boom extends the same as the other sets with this boom; simply pull it. It works surprisingly well and due to circular ridges inside the boom the extension (which is just a standard beam) will hold in place. The gear at the back controls the height of the boom. As you can see the boom is only half extended. Boom fully extended, half down. The cable is kept in place via two gears and a blue pin, same as the 7905 crane. Even under decent weights this works well. The stabilisers however cannot handle much weight once the load is moved off axis. The stablilsers are a very simple but effective design. Another shot of the stablilsers. This also shows how far the boom will decend. The boom height mechanism works well also. I love the cab design. Overall this is a remarkable achievement for the low price. I bought it for the boom piece as I want to improve the crane that came with 7998 7898 ( :-$ ). I highly recommend it.	positive

Alright, so I usually do quick photo reviews when I get new sets. That's what I'll do here, but there's quite a few photos, so I thought I might as well make its own review thread. So, I got the Kwik-E-Mart by paying just2much on an early eBay copy. I think it's worth it, as this week I'm gonna be super busy, so I was able to build it Saturday and stuff. Here's my video review, I think it's one of my best: Well, let's get onto this photo review. The set is $200 USD with a little over 2100 pieces. The official release is April 15th for VIP members, May 1st for everyone else at LEGO Stores. And, if you want full size pictures, check out my Flickr by clicking here. The minifigures included are great. You get three exclusive minifigures (one being a completely exclusive character- the first time LEGO has ever put an exclusive mould in a Direct to Consumer set), and you get three of the series most popular characters in their normal attire for those who missed out on the first Simpsons minifigures series. The Kwik-E-Mart's exterior is loaded with lots of sticker details. The only printed detail you'll see in the exterior is the dial pad in the phone booth, which has appeared in some other licensed themes since last year. ( ^^^ right here is there the store can be opened- a simple Technic pin and receiver keeps it in place and allows for opening and closing) The roof of the store includes the garden shown in the Paul McCartney episode. The roof can be slided out/in once you open it with the hinge part. Here's a look at the store with the roof removed. The floors are a nice sand blue color, coming with 8x16 thin plates: And, for the interior, from the view of the store opened with the hinges at the back that I mentioned earlier: The left front corner, which includes some arcade machines of Bonestorm and Great White Hunter, an amazingly done Buzz cola soda machine, juice machine, the checkout counter, ect: The right front corner, with food aisles, freezers, and a frozen Jasper sticker: The back left corner, which includes some nice coffee kettle builds, the donut tray, hotdogs, ect: The right back corner, which has a door leading to a very small hallway that only has a mouse and cheese in it. The hallway leads to the employees only door in the back, and it's very hard to get in the door way (not that there's anything to do inside there): Also included is Clancy's copcar, which fits three figures: Here's a look at the piece list in the instructions, click on each to be lead to an enlarged version of the pic: Also included are some awesome printed pieces, and two unprinted coffee cups! Honestly, I think this set is perfect. The price is fantastic, and has a great PPP ratio. They really went above and beyond by including Snake in this set. I honestly think it's better than the Simpsons House in terms of accuracy and the value here- so many cool pieces printed and in exclusive colors. So, that's my quick picture review. Hope you guys enjoyed, and I'd love to hear your thoughts!	positive

Thanks for all the feedback you guys! Robert8, on 12 April 2015 - 11:25 PM, said: I can't help but think the minifigures are the weak part of the set. Snake and Apu are great but the rest.... I don't know. They kinda redundant now. They could at least give us new torso printing, like Homer wearing his jacket or Bart wearing his blue t-shirt or Marge wearing her coat. Or, as I said in the discussion thread, I'd have included Jasper in CMF series 2 and a Frozen version here. Overall, the set looks kinda smaller than what I thought. I agree, but so many people were complaining about how The Simpsons House should have included the most common versions (mostly because the eyes or whatever), so I think LEGO played it safe and just included the normal versions. It makes sense, since Series 1 is gone forever, and the common versions were in there, and this set is bound to be in stock for a very long time like the Death Star. I never really agreed when people were complaining about the alternate eye prints personally, but I guess this is a good business choice based on previous feedback.

Hello everyone. Excellent review! English is not my native language, but I want to express my opinion. Simpsons house was the first of its kind, and I can say without exaggeration that this is the most impressive set that I'm going (my collection http://brickset.com/sets/ownedby-celeb ). I look at the video from the Kwik-e-Mart, and is difficult to say how good it is compared with the house. The main disadvantages that I said to myself, is this: build the walls of the large panels, next is access to the roof (gray parts in front of the back door (I think they represent the stairs)) is not on the level with doors on the roof and when you open them, you can see the white block is openly trash, my points of view. Boxes on the left of go to the store and powersauce box, i want see make real and not just a cube, f.e. such as in the unreleased Star Wars set. About minifigures, I fully agree with Robert8. Two more of the same Homer, Marge and Bart?! Personally, I put my set as a scene and all the replays minifigure are inside the house that was not identical characters next And also absolutely terrible Bart`s accessory This set is made parking for bikes and it looks very cool. But damn, it is hoped to see the Bart or Lisa's bike, instead of useless balloons with paint. The walls are made with convex inside panels, why so? can anyone know? have not seen any pictures with such walls in TV show. Why did not they turn? I personally really like how realized roof, but my brother says that it is terrible :) garden could do more in the series there were almost jungle I do not know how to be considered here, maybe anyone can express any opinion or idea? I look at the Simpsons house, and then look at the photo of this e-Mart. I can not understand, in the house we have a garage, two floors, cool floor, a lot of furniture, all the rooms and walls, collected from cubes, many additional accessories. And where is all this detail here? It looks much smaller (maybe even poorer). If they still will release next year comic book store, it will be even less? Of course it is difficult to estimate without seeing it live, we have it will be sold only in May. At first sight it does not look so impressive as the house. Can certainly the case in the limit on the amount of detail, but why it was impossible to add $ 50 to the cost and make Jasper, the more detailed the roof, the walls of the smaller elements, that it was not convex. Sad. Thanks all for attention. Edited by celeb, 13 April 2015 - 05:10 AM.	positive
Great review!! Thanks for paying a little extra to get it now and review it for us!!! You must be a youngin'...those phone booths thingys are called "pay phones" :) J/J They're tough to find nowadays.	positive
Incredible set, thanks for the pics! So many details and unique prints and colors. I'm not that into the Simpsons but definitely a top tier set.	positive

looks great. how does it compare to the house	positive
Here's a size comp to the house: Click for a bigger image.	positive
That's actually not bad sizing, IMO. Sure, it looks like you get a lot more with the house, but the Kwik-E-Mart has a lot more of those little references that make it Simpsons. I agree with some of the complaining; a real Jasper behind a trans-blue panel would have been cool. You could always bulk up the roof with more foliage... I think it has a great foundation as a set, but could do with a few mods to make it better. Thanks for the pictures; I greatly appreciate being able to see reviews like this before dropping $200 on a LEGO set.	negative
Great Review Just2Good, honestly I love this set lots of great details and references.	positive

It's the level of detail that floors me, a licensed set with the mindset of those great Creator sets. I think it displays much better than the Simpsons house which, from the outside, is a bit drab	negative

Did anyone else have a problem with the piano against the wall of The Simpsons House? It just kept coming off way too easily and I was getting really frustrated with it sticking out and not fully going on so I had to put the two tiles that hold them one place over away from the wall for it to sit properly without falling out, I think I might put Snowball II behind it since cats love to hide underneath or behind things lol but just curious to know if anyone else was encountering this problem with the previous set.	positive
I recently acquired 90% of this set, so I thought I would do a review of it. Please note that half of the Mini-figs are wrong, and there are some part substitutions. This is the only set that comes with this plate. There is a depression under the grey plates to the back. The pool depression can be easily covered by three quarter circle plates... which just happen to be included in this set. (Good set design Lego!) The stairs are old Fabuland ones, and have been used in a few other sets. This is the only one that has them in "ParaPink" however. What is the difference between "ParaPink" and "Pink"? Dunno... The big windows are in only two other sets, both of them DACTA ones! The smaller ones were in one other Paradisa set. The interior, while simple, works very well. I love the coffee machine. A cute car came with the set as well. The bird house is a nice idea as well. Once the current visitors leave I will probably be breaking this set. I wish Lego would go back to these sets as they always had some great parts in them.	negative
Great review of a classic set. *y*	positive
Tks Sinner for that cool review ;-) This set is not one of my favs (never was really a big fan of those raised baseplates) but had fantastic parts and MFs !! It has great playability with really cool "80's Miami" feel *wub* That pink was actually pretty cool and went well with that lime green (I think its lime but I'm not 100% positive). Once again this pisses me off so much that I was in my dark ages when this theme was out !! I loved it, especially all the beach/water themes *wub* I really wish TLC decided to bring that water Paradisia back !! Who knows !! After all they need to make some girlie sets !! Girls are a part of their market totally neglected !! How many women we have on the boards ?? Really a tiny few unfortunatly !! SO TLC, please bring Paradisia back in may 08 :-P , please !! *yoda*	positive

The same counts for me. I have never seen a single show. So I only can argue about the bricks as are. I don?t like all the SB sets because of the inflationary use of stickers. >:-( More to that see below.

Due to a larger BL order in the U.S. I couldn?t resist to add two Hopper Waggons to my train layout. Here?s a review of this fantastic set. The box. Well, there?s nothing really special about it. The open box with three polybags. Note, that there are only three different colors used in that set (actually there are 4, but you can?t see the dark grey ones). Great color composition by the way. *wub* And - NO STICKERS !!! - :-D Oooops - I opened the bags too fast. Help me, I?m drowning! *sing* Not following the instructions, I built the wheels first to get the larger pieces out of the way. Keep on rolling. This is the load of the hopper waggon. 11 round bricks altogether. When I opened the set, I was curious if it was a new colored set or an old one. Luckily enough it was an old one, with old dark grey. I don?t know if TLC ever produced this set with bley. From the following pic you can clearly see, that the set is an old one. Look at these slope bricks. See what I mean? All bricks are looking exactly the same! Buy a set today means get at least three different textures on the slopes and maybe even more shades of tan. :-X >:-( I have said that in many other threads here and I?m saying it again: Back to the roots, Lego! You were able to produce good quality. Show us you can still do it! *sad* But now to the building. It?s a 6 x 24 train base plate you?re building on. Did I say I liked the colors? :-D This is the mechanism to unload the waggon. Built in the waggon with open gates... ... and with closed ones. Almost done. This is the first time, I realized that minifigs actually can step on those ladders. :-$ A short lift and the wheels are fixed. This darn mechanism! Wait, I?m coming with my monkey wrench! >:-) Who opened that door again? Do I have to do it all on my own? :'-( Finally the work is done. Now have a brake. One shot from the front/back. You can see the car is really huge! 8-? I put it behind the red car of the 4512. That sure looked very strange. *wacko* The set fits a lot better to the other cars of the "My Own Train" theme than to the older ones. The Score: Brick selection: 10/10 excellent color and brick selection (these were the days...) Playability: 9/10 great unloading mechanism Price/piece count ratio: 8/10 at peeron it says 20$, I got it for 39,95$ -> 30?/228 bricks. Not really cheap, but worth every cent! :-) Overall rating: 9/10 and a definity "must buy" for rolling stock lovers. Sad enough it?s not available on S@H any more. But there are still sets on BL and ebay. That?s for now folks, thank you for reading. I have some job to do...	positive

*wub* *wub* *wub* *wub* *wub* Holodoc, I seriously have some love for your review!! You're in it and using a Fabuland wrench!!! Such a clever review with a great sense of humor! I really liked this train set and it adds so much to a train layout, especially when you buy multiples. TLC is throwing away a potential gold mine by discontinuing this line. :'-( It is also nice to see those beautiful consistent slopes in that picture. It really is sad that TLC is letting quality slip. They don't seem to be responding to the issue they way they did the bley/frown fiasco. perhaps we AFOL need to make more of a stink!

That?s really a great and overall nice playset with a very cool Mrs. Puff and a fine new Spongebob! *sweet* The boating school?s indeed very nice with a beautiful color scheme, and so is the lighthouse.... I?m really tempted to buy a second set just to "complete" these buildings.... although it?s a little too expensive for doing so, and it wouldn?t even fit with the style of the other SB sets. X-D Wet highway to the poor puffer fish? privat hell on! :-D	positive
You've done it again. *yoda* ! Great reveiw. I really like this set, but in my opinon, $50 is steep considering I won't actually 'play' with it. I mean, half of it is a track for peat sake! Ill eventually get it for the Mrs. Puff figure, though. *y*	positive
*yoda* comes through again! I love this set... but it just costs too much for Australians so I will be giving it a miss. :'-( It is a shame as it has clams in it... 8-|	positive
Another great review, thanks *yoda*! Man, those smooth slopes really look like crap when on a roof :-| That was the whole reason they had texture in the first place... |-/ I'll never liked those, they feel so cheap! The new SB head is great, and can Mrs. Puff's legs move? I just ask since her feet are separate, and in figs where the legs can't move, they're usually one piece at the bottom to keep them from breaking off. The set looks great, and seems to have a lot of playability	positive
Yoda, I don't thank you for this review, and after the Chump Bucket review too! Because I'm so exited to have them that since I ordered them from s@h, I come back home aftre the work the faster I can, with the hope to see a big box on my bed... and this, even if I know that it tooks more than 6-7 days to have my order... This Mrs. Puff figs is really really nice *wub* And this 3rd SB head too!	neutral
Man, that Sponge-bob head cracks me up! Hilarity.This is a cool set, although I much prefer the Chum Bucket set. I don't see what's wrong with the course, then again I can see why AFOLs wouldn't like it. It's just playability really. I like the breakable wall though. The building is cool, a few modifications (i.e. making it more realistic, real chairs for a start) and it would make a cool little wharf for your Lego town. And to SW4J, Mrs Puff's legs are connected at the feet, if you look closely. So, thanks for the great review, *yoda*!	positive
Thank you *yoda* for strike 2! It?s SB again. |-/ Sticker Alarm! :-X But this set is better than Chum Bucket. There are far more interesting parts if you don?t like SB. Especially the light house and the little hut with the wooden pontoon. *y* And yet again another set with smooth slopes and rough ones... Too bad, too bad. >:-( >:-( >:-( If I just knew the person who is responsible for that... >:-)	positive
Maybe mrs Puff has a nice toy inside X-D I like this review. The lighthouse part and the school are nice enough for other towns. and the figs are nice, even mrs puffs 2 pieces you can't use for other things. :-) Pity that it's 50 dollars/+/- 60 euro. for half price I would think about it.	positive

Lego 31036 Creator Toy and Grocery Shop Thanks to EuroBricks for making this review possible! For years, Lego has offered a house of some sort in the Creator line each year - with the standard Creator 3-in-1 instructions, that's given us a very wide variety of housing. In 2014, they added a business option with their 31026 Bike Shop and Cafe set. This continues into this year's Toy and Grocery Shop set. These shops are smaller than the very detailed modular buildings, but that should help them fit in better with the other City sets, and this also lets them get into more kids' cities with their lower pricetag. Name: Toy and Grocery Shop Set Number: 31036 Pieces: 466 Price: $39.99 Minifigs: 2 Theme: Creator Year of Release: 2015 Links: Bricklink Peeron Brickset The Box The front of the box shows the "A" version model out of the three, plus insets of the B and C versions. I like the sorta-European looking backdrop; it goes well with the styling of the buildings. Interestingly, the main model is shown opened up for play, while the two insets show those versions folded. The Box Top On the top of the box, Lego helpfully shows that with 3 of these sets, you can make a whole street. The Box Back On the back, you get to again see all three versions together, but this time, folded. It's a little creepy though with those clones running around :) The Manuals Yep, three actual, printed manuals. There's nothing indicating them as being A, B, and C models, but it's pretty obvious looking at the designs which is the "main" model and which are the alternates. The Contents Bags of parts and two plates. Nothing terribly exciting to see here.... The Minifigs Nothing new here, but two nice figs none-the-less. Well, Bricklink does say that both figs are unique to this set, but there's not any new parts to them. The closest thing to rare is the female head - it's only in this set, 2013's Dragon Mountain Castle set, a UK store grand opening set, and one of the 2014 Holiday freebie sets. The faces aren't that unique, but I guess this exact combo of two faces on the head is. I love the kid torso with the spaceman on it. The Minifig Backs No back printing on anything here except for an alternate female face. Sorry. I do like that her two faces are so different though. That's much better than when a head has a "scared" and a "more scared" face. The "C" Build Enough with the basics; let's build. I'm going to review them in the same order I built them, backwards. Since you can tell immediately looking at the 3 designs that they're going to use different numbers of pieces and so forth, I figured I'd build the smallest first lest it seem like a letdown. All three have some basic similarities - the two plates are hinged to give a building that opens for play. They also do have interiors, which you can see starting to form here. The "C" Build, Front It's a pretty quick build, so it's done already. Here's the front of the building with it opened up. Like this, it appears to be two separate stores, a newsstand and some sort of shop you can enter. All the printed tiles help give the newsstand a detailed appearance, but I'm not sure why they've got a $100 bill lying on the ledge... The "C" Build, Rear From the back side, the interiors are pretty plain. The shop half has a plant in a jar and a weird chair, and the newsstand just has a register. The "C" Build, Sides Here's the two sides of the folded building. On the hinge side, there's a bunch of windows in a disjointed wall with random colors. On the other, why did they put in a huge window when the set does include a trans-clear door that could have gone there? And you get a small patch of plants, like so many sets seem to have these days. The "C" Build, Extras That's a lot of leftovers there. And not just little stuff - multiple doors, stairs, etc. And unused sand green is always a little sad.... The "B" Build, 1 A pretty similar start, with the hinge and little garden and some tiles along the ground. The "B" Build, 2 Now we see a big windowed wall, some details like lights, and how it has the usual alternate model "weird part usage" - like a 1x4 brick with side studs being used over the doorway, even though those side studs will not get used. The "B" Build, Front The finished building gives us a nice little post office, with a letter-carrying bird on the roof. Hope that's not their normal method of delivery! Something about the colors just doesn't work for me though. The combo of white / light grey / dark grey / black / sand green plus tan is just too much. The tan window and door frames I don't like. The "B" Build, Inside On the inside, things are weird. The counter on the left is ok, but the light above the door (with a yellow clip? ugly!) is too big, and everything else over there by the door doesn't make much sense either. The "B" Build, Sides I like the front side here, except the colors are still too much. The bench, greenery, mailbox on the corner, and streetlight are all nice. The boy is a little creepy though - binoculars in hand PLUS a telescope on the roof of the post office? Why? The hinge side shows more of the weird colors you get in the wall, but that's going to be hidden when the set is open. Plus we even see that on big modulars at times, so it's not SO terrible. The "B" Build, Leftovers Again, a lot of leftover parts. It's obvious this was another alternate, but it'd be nice to see more of them used to make a bigger building. But let's move on to the model that DOES use them all... The "A" Build, 1 The first half starts like this. Maybe it's just my bias, but it already feels like a more detailed build. Bottles on the wall, the yellow and red awning over the window, etc. The "A" Build, 2 The other half starts off with detailed work too. I think that's a red vending machine. The stairs are also VERY solidly built. I also appreciate the effort to get that diagonal base where a door will be - it's such a nice touch to have sections of a building that aren't right angles. The "A" Build, 3 Not too much has been added, but I wanted to showcase the tiny toys before they get hidden by a wall. That robot and train are just fantastic little micro builds. The "A" Build, 4 Things are coming together quickly. The walls, windows, and doors get the first floor nearly done. I'm still not big on the sand green and tan combo, but I do really like the red and yellow awnings. The "A" Build, 5 It appears the shop owner lives upstairs, since we've got a bedroom forming here. The bed is a little plain, but the table and lamp on the other half are great. And my big fingers did not like putting all those railings on the balcony, with the telescope posts and tile tops. Knocked quite a few off before I got them all done. The "A" Build, Front And it's done. All the details make this set really feel like a mini-modular. The roofline has great greebling, and the shop contents, and on and on. It's not perfect though. The tiny car above the toy store door isn't nearly as good as the toys inside. And the kid's yellow scooter? The wheels aren't even on the ground, much less able to roll. The scooter looks decent though, so that counts for something. Well, at least as long as you are at this angle, since the boy's only got 1 foot on the 1 stud wide scooter. The "A" Build, Inside Most of the interior has been seen already. The roof though does a nice job of being interesting for a roof. A skylight, the edge rails, etc. And you can see there's not much "wrong color" in the walls. The "A" Model, Sides An interesting building when folded up. Very tall and skinny. You can tell it's not really meant to be displayed this way - it's meant to be open. The good - lots! I like the awning, the diagonal door, the flowerbox under the upper window, the folding gate on the balcony that lets it be used in open or closed mode, and the green / white / blue colors. The bad - well, the stairs end short of the upper door, I still don't really like the tan doorframes (I think black would have been better), and why don't the upper floors match up in size? The "A" Model, Leftovers Ah, that's more like it. Just a few small pieces left as spares. The Errors You might have to click through to the full-size versions, but I did catch a few weird errors in the manuals. First, in the photo of the newsstand, the map in the front corner is on there sideways. The map does have a clear north arrow printed on it. On the second image, the boy's feet are hanging off the edge. Just unusual to see an alignment error in the manual like that. The Comparison Here are this set and the modular Detective Office side by side. There's a huge difference - as you'd expect. But is the difference MORE than you'd expect? This set is 466 parts, $40. The DO is 2262 pieces and $160. 5 times the parts, 4 times the price. Looking at them side by side, I'd expect a bigger difference in both. The Conclusion So, what's my conclusion on this model? I love the main model, but the alternates are meh. It's a nice set for someone looking for a town building other than police and fire stations, but who isn't ready to move to the modular line. Compared to the modulars though, it seems overpriced. Part of that is because the huge modulars are actually a great deal compared to other Lego sets. I'm also a little surprised that it's so small, when you compare it to the City sets like a police station. Those are generally designed with much more open space, letting them be more of a playset. This one is small and cramped, so it'd be tougher to play in. It's not really a City set though. The Ratings Value: 7/10 - It's under the 10 cents a part mark, but that's largely due to having a TON of tiny parts. All those flowers and decorative 1x1 round studs add up quickly! Design: 7/10 - Good and bad on the colors, and there's a big difference between the quality of the main vs alternate models. Having so many leftover pieces is one thing when the Creator set makes 3 very different models (ie a boat, plane, and truck). When it's 3 buildings, it seems wasteful to have so many parts leftover. Minifigs: 6/10 - I'm not sure they both fit the set. I suppose the boy is going to the toy store and the woman is going to the grocery? But there's no storekeeper in either. The woman doesn't look like a storekeeper to me, so that's why I assume she's another shopper. I love the boy, but the woman is just so-so - except that I do appreciate the head having two very different expressions. But again, that doesn't fit the set. I can't see her scared face being used. Playability: 6/10 - The shops are detailed with registers and so forth, but it's all so tiny it'd be hard to play with the figs in it. Parts: 9/10 - Tons of windows and doors, plus nice sand green bricks. But some things (the large blue curves used on the roof for example) are weirdly specialized and would be hard to use in another building design. Overall: 7/10 - I'd recommend doing what I did - build the alternates first, then the main since that's how you'll want to leave it. I'd really like to see the price a little lower compared to other sets (again, the part count is inflated due to SO MANY tiny parts) and the finished building is tiny, but it's loaded with neat details.	positive
Great review! Very thorough. It's not a set which makes me run to tye store, but it definitely has some fun elements. I do like your new grey background. Your pictures look great!	neutral
Any chance you have a picture of the News Stand next to the Detectives Office building as I would love to see the scaling for that?	neutral
Nice review mostlytechnic. I particularly like the use of grey background surface for the pictures. It somehow makes the building stand out more. Good job!	neutral
A terrific, very comprehensive review - but I'm not at all impressed with this set. It feels like a mishmash of bricks with no clear design aesthetic and as such blatantly underdeveloped (i.e. designed to hit a price/brick count point rather than provide a solid set in the Creator Town tradition). Compared to other Creator sets at this price point (31025 - Mountain Hut, for example) it feels utterly uninspired and ugly. Edited by Johnny6666, 04 May 2015 - 10:02 AM.	negative

Cheers for putting in the time to create a wonderful review. I am not a huge fan of this set; I like the colour combinations, but it all seems a bit all-too-simple. It can (and will) be nicely modularised, though!	negative
Thanks 'mostlytechnic' for this review, I only brought this set to continue the shop series from creator. In my opinion it's only half as good as the bike shop/cafe one. Plus it doesn't fit the same as that pair of shops, oh well maybe next year Lego creator will have a better one. Brick On Review On 'mostlytechnic' !	neutral
Reviews for this set really should picture them next to the Bike Shop & Cafe, which it's intended to be compatible with right down to the size of the baseplates and grey tiles around the edge. It doesn't look that great on its own, but if you add the two sets together you get something that begins to look like a street scene.	positive

Interesting to get two comments right in a row with opposite opinions :) I don't have the bike/cafe set, but to me, they don't looks like they'd really go together. They're the same concept (two buildings that fold in half) but the sidewalk is different size and they just feel differently styled to me.	negative
As a fan of Creator houses, I really want to like this set. However, I think that Creator houses have long filled a niche that's neglected elsewhere: residential houses. We haven't had a larger residential house since 2013; I'm not sure if these sets have anything to do with that, but it seems like they may be the replacement for larger houses. And I'd much rather have a larger house set than a set like this. I also agree with many others here; something about it just feels incomplete. I think that the various City business buildings we've gotten in recent years (including those in this year's City Square--which is much more expensive than this, but also contains much more) make for better buildings at this scale.	positive
Thanks andy_0306uk, your very clever strategic decision to serve us with blurry pictures allowed me to glance at this review without ruinating that whole wonderful Advent surprise too much.... :-P *y* But although I loved the last year?s one, I think they could do another theme (or perhaps even two calendars), because right now Castle?s pretty hot IMO.	positive

Things that are similar to the City theme, and more civil life based, like some blacksmith equipment, market place, bakery, farmer and so on, but a wizard workshop, a hidden treasure and some medieval furniture would also work fine....

9.30 euro is MSRP here in Denmark. 7 euro would have resulted in a nicer reception from my part, but the strong marked position of LEGO in its homeland together with the general high prices (because some of us are supposedly rich...) makes the prices less bearable. It is funny you should mention Germany. I thought the prices for LEGO were even higher there! I'm sure I paid more than MSRP last time I bought LEGO from from your country. On the other hand. The last thing I bought was the 5521 Model Team sea jet from 1993!	neutral

I couldn't find a review of this wonderful set in here, so here it goes! I got the set for MSRP (180kr = 24 euro) which is a fair price here in Denmark. As all other Creator sets there are instructions for several models (3 in this case). The box The box is a little larger than City sets in the same price range. The primary model is shown on the front while you see the secondary ones on the back. What you get 312 pieces in 5 polybags and two building instructions: one for the primary model and the other for the rest. The built It was impossible for me to speed build this model because of the nifty functional details from the retractable landing gear to the wings that can turn by means of the handle in the back of the model. It took me a full hour to build it because I had to "test" how it all works together. The finished model The landing gear isn't fully enclosed when retracted and the models are sub-minifig scale, but I still love the design of the models. The doors for the rear wheels open as you pull the wheels down and the final piece of functionality comes from the wings that can either tilt (the horizontal stabilizers) or have elevators. Wing in, wings out, wings in, wings out... Ratings As a whole I actually like this set even more than the Big Rig. The models are just as diverse but the added functionality makes the plane more fun to play with than the rig. Price: 7/10 - A good price, but not a bargain as the Big Rig Design: 9/10 - There could have been a sligtly higher level of details in the main model, but all models are really good looking and I especially like the design of the hovercraft. Functionality: 10/10 - I guess you could ask for working rudders, opening cockpit and so on, but the plane is really filled with movable parts and the turning of the wings works really well. Secondary models: 7/10 - A hovercraft! How awesome is that!? If only the last model was just as inventive instead of a standard helicopter... Modifiability: 8/10 - The bricks are in ordinary colours and there is a good variety of them giving you plenty of possibilities for MOC'ing. You can easily make the main model into something that looks more like an F-14. 9/10 Probably as good as it gets for a Creator set in this price range. It is entertaining to both build and play with, looks good and the secondary models are worth building as well! (Brickshelf gallery)	positive
Nice review and a nice set. Thanks for taking the time. I'll want to pick this guy up.	positive
Hovercraft Alternate model. Uses around 4/5th of the parts. It is cool but a bit fragile.	positive
Thank you Sinner for bringing the pictures of the hovercraft. I think it is a really cool model, but The steering wheel doen't work too well. It doesn't turn easilly all the way around and when the craft turns, it doesn't stay stable on the three wheels because the front wheel turns quite alot into the opposite side. Now to the third model! This is quite a basic helicopter with the functionality of having the rotors turning. It doesn't use that many of the bricks and doesn't even have a landing gear. I have a question to all of you. As you can see, I prefer to show one or two large pictures and have the rest as clickable thumbnails. Most people use only the relatively big (typically 640x480) pictures so that you don't have to follow links. What do you prefer? It is no problem for me to do it the other way, but I would like to know if you have any preferences.	neutral

?34.99 is not too shabby. The big guy itself is nice, but the gem of the set is the Mech. Really nice Mech I must say! Great for posing. The Mini figs Suprisingly nice little build/vehicle. Never seen this element before....its probably nothing new though, Lol. No articulation of the legs? Nooooooo! Phew! The front two legs do articulate. Would of been bad if they didnt. Overall, I give the set 7.8/10. Not the best, but its actually quite nice, and the Yellow Mech is awesome. If it was him on his own, then 9.4/10! Cheers	positive

It is no secret that Marvel is one of the most successful companies right now. From the Avengers to the X-Men and down to even the most obscure characters like Ant-Man, every one of their movies has been a big hit until now. The latest Marvel movie, Fant4stic, was released last month and while I have not seen it yet, I'm sure it's just as great as their other movies. I mean, it has the word "Fantastic" in the title after all! And being the smart business that they are, The Lego Company decided to get in on the hype early and capitalize on this movie's undoubtful success two years in advance by making a set featuring Fant4stic's main villain, Dr. Doom. Now that's what I call forward thinking! But did they do a good job with it or were they being overhasty? Let's find out! Set Number: 76005 Name: Spider-Man: Daily Bugle Showdown Theme: Marvel Super Heroes Subtheme: Ultimate Spider-Man Year of Release: 2013 Pieces: 476 Minifigs: 5 Price: $49.99 USD S@H description: Quote Swing into the Daily Bugle and stop Dr. Doom™! Dr. Doom™ and his henchman Beetle™ are attacking the Daily Bugle in their speedy jet to steal Spider-Man's™ secret identity. It's up to Spider-Man™ and Nova™ to swing in and stop them! Trigger the Daily Bugle's explosion functions to cause destruction as the jet fires missiles! Stop Dr. Doom™ from hitching the jet's anchor hook to the safe with Spider-Man's secret inside! Knock Beetle™ off the building with the swinging web attack and drop Dr. Doom™ inside with the rooftop trapdoor! Then fly Nova™ in through the broken window with the dumpster catapult function and send those villains back to where they came from. Includes Spider-Man™, Nova™, Dr. Doom™, Beetle™ and J. Jonah Jameson™ with accessories and weapons. The first thing that comes to mind after reading this description is: Wow, that's a lot of TMs! Anyway, here are some resource links for this set: Brickset Bricklink Rebrickable The Box Since this set is based on the Ultimate Spider-Man cartoon, the box has the usual USM design with the red Marvel Super Heroes background, an illustration of Spidey in the upper right corner, and the USM logo in the lower right. As usual, there is a minifig line up in the lower left, and since this was before the terrible redesign, you can see the full body of the minifigs. I really miss this type of line up. There is quite a lot going on here: Doctor Doom attacking the Daily Bugle in his jet while simultaneously reaching for J. Jonah Jameson below with his jet's claw, Spider-Man (reluctantly) swings in to save him, while Nova fights off the Beetle. It's a pretty cool scene, even though it's not very accurate to the show. In "Beetle Mania", the episode that this set is based on, the Beetle was indeed out to kill JJJ, but it was in order to stop him from exposing his identity, not Spider-Man's (although Spidey was next on JJJ's list). And while he is a recurring villain on the show, Doctor doom had nothing to do with this plot and didn't even appear in the episode aside from a brief cameo. It's awesome that they included him anyway, though, so I'm not gonna complain. Note that the tower is so tall that it wraps around the top of the box. There, you can also see a scale reference with the Spider-Man minifig. On the back of the box, you can see the interior of the Bugle and all of its play features which there are quite a few of since this is a playset. It's all illustrated pretty well, although Lego's choice of sound effects is still a mystery to me. I don't get why they don't go for Spider-Man's signature "Fwip!" instead of "Fazzing!" and I didn't know that a breaking window made the sound "Btoom!" but I digress. Contents Inside the box you will find three instruction booklets (one smaller than the others), a comic book, a fairly large sticker sheet, five numbered bags, and two loose pieces: A white string piece and a gray 16x8 plate. There aren't really any notable pieces and nobody cares about the comic bock (no offense to the artist), so lets get right to the instructions. They are pretty straight forward and easy to follow. Some of the pages have a ghostly image of Spidey, Nova, and Dr. Doom in the top right corner which is fitting since these are all minifigs that appear in this set (which is strangely not something that can be said for many other Super Heroes instructions with this type of artwork). Minifigures As with most Super Heroes sets, most people will get this set mainly for the minifigs, so without further ado, let's talk about them. Spider-Man is the same old bootless one you get in almost every USM set. Not much to say about him. Some might complain that we don't get Spidey's alter ego Peter Parker in this set, but in the USM cartoon, MJ is actually the one who works at the Daily Bugle, not Peter. Curse the creators of this cartoon for ruining our chances of getting a new Peter Parker minifig by trying to mix things up. Next we get J. Jonah Jameson. He appeared in a Spider-Man 2 set before, but this is a complete redesign. He now has a blue suit with a red tie, a unique face print, and that combed-back hair in dark gray. This new hairpiece doesn't suit him at all and the old flat top hair was perfect for him in my opinion, so I don't know why they changed it. The good thing about this change, however, is the fact that this piece is exclusive to this set in that color. Nova on the other hand is spot-on. He comes with a new helmet mold and some nice torso printing. However, he, too, is missing his boots. TLC should have started making dual-colored legs a long time ago. Here are some reference images to compare them to. Okay, so JJJ's hair may not be completely black in the show, but I still think they should have given his minifig a black hairpiece. His suit is also not quite the right color. He rarely appears in person in the show (including the episode this set is based on) and is usually seen on screens around New York, so this is the best picture of him I could find. I guess I should be happy they included a minifig of him at all. In the episode, it was actually Mary Jane who was at the Bugle during Beetle's attack, so it would have made more sense to include her, but we got her in the Spider-copter set one year later, so that's ok. All three of them have back printing. In JJJ's case I'm using that term loosely since it is only comprised of two lines, but it's nice that they went through the trouble of adding them. Both JJJ and Nova come with angry alternate faces. It almost looks like they're trying to out-angry each other. Who do you think looks angrier? Let me know in the comments section below. Now let's talk about the bad guys. Even though he would be better off in a Fantastic Four set, it's great to finally get Victor Van Doom, one of the greatest Marvel villains ever and in comics in general. He comes with a dark green hood which was new and exclusive in that color at the time, and he is the only minifig in this set that has leg printing. Beetle is a regular minifig with wings. The metallic printing on his face and torso is pretty nice, but I wish it would have continued onto his legs as well. The Beetle looks quite accurate to his on-screen counterpart. The only thing that could have improved him is a new helmet mold with pointy eyebrows/antennae. Doctor Doom, however, looks nothing like he does in the movie. I just don't understand how Lego could have messed him up so badly. Maybe they were working off of early concept art or something. Here is a back view of Doom and Beetle. Beetle would be a pretty boring minifig if it wasn't for his wings which are awesome with their holographic texture. They are so mesmerizing, I could look at those things all day. This piece also appeared in trans. light green in the Galaxy Squad sets which came out at the same time. Here they are without their gear. As you can see, they both have back printing as well. And no, Doctor Doom does not come with an alternate facial expression, which is fine since you can't see much of his expressions due to his mask anyway. Here's a look at Dr. Doom and Nova without their headgear. Some say that Doom's face looks too cartoony, but I think it looks fine. Nova is wearing stylish goggles as a way of explaining his white eyes. It's a far better explanation than the Bat-sweatband. They did the same thing with the masked Wolverine later. Here are all the figs with their accessories. JJJ comes with a camera so that he can take "more pictures of Spider-Man!" Beetle comes with one of those overused ADU guns which is a very poor representation of his wrist-mounted blasters. I hate to say it, but even those bulky new stud shooters would have been a better representation of his weapons. Spidey comes with his usual string of webbing and Nova comes with some Iron Man style translucent studs. The weird thing is that they are red while his powers have a blue glow in the show. Doctor Doom sadly doesn't get any accessories, but who needs weapons when you have a jet with a claw and flick-fire missiles. The Build The first bag contains Spider-Man, a brick separator, and the parts to build the ground floor of the DBC building. After a quick and straight-forward build, you get this. The dumpster and street lamp are separate from the building and since the lamp post is not built onto any baseplate and is quite top-heavy, it gets knocked over pretty easily. Maybe it's meant to be that way, but I would have preferred it if you could stick it onto the baseplate of the building on which there is unfortunately not enough space to do so. As you would expect, the second bag has the parts for the first floor of the building. This is also the bag that contains Beetle. After another fairly simple build, you'll find yourself with a two story building with a spiderweb one side and a fire escape on the other. However, you have to apply three stickers during this section of the build which is never fun. Can you guess what's in bag number 3? Yup, the second floor of the building. You don't need superpowers to predict that one. Also, this bag contains Nova and Jameson. The build of this section is a bit repetitive since the second floor is mostly the same as the first and it takes slightly longer to build since you have to build the rooftop as well. Also, in addition to the two window stickers you have to apply ten 2x2 tile stickers! Trying to do this without having any of them being crooked is a real pain in the megablocks. The next bag contains Doctor Doom and the cockpit of his jet. Doom's cape is in the usual square white box and the string for the claw is folded up in a piece of tape. Here's what you get at the end of this section. Looks more like an escape pod than a jet at this point. The final bag is the smallest as it only includes the few parts needed to finish the Doom jet. Once you build the wings and tail, you stick them onto the cockpit via Technic pins and you're done. Spare Parts These are the parts that are left over after the build. There is the brick separator of course, an extra antenna, and the usual little bits and bops. What's really awesome, though, is that they give you an extra pair of Beetle's wings! Considering what a neat piece this is and that this is the only set in which it comes in trans-black make this a very welcome spare that you can use in your customs. The Finished Set Here is the complete set. The DBC building looks quite tall, especially when you count the antenna. Comparing it to a screenshot from the episode, the general look of the building is there, although there are some inaccuracies. Aside from the fact that it is obviously way down-scaled, the screens that show JJJ ranting about Spider-Man should have been hexagonal, not square, and should have wrapped around the building. However, considering how many stickers you would have had to apply if they would have made it accurate, I'm actually glad they kept the screen mercifully small. Much like Doctor Doom himself, the Doom jet didn't actually appear in the Beetle Mania episode. However, it did appear in a later episode titled "Not A Toy" in which Spider-Man plays around with Captain America's shield, accidentally drops it in Doctor Doom's Latvarian embassy and has to try to retrieve it. And yes, that episode was as godawful as it sounds. Here's a screenshot of the jet from that episode. Like with the DBC, they managed to capture the general shape of the vehicle, although it doesn't look quite as good as in the show. The color scheme is too dark and it looks kind of blockier. Let's take a closer look at the jet. There is no real way to reel the claw in unfortunately. However, there is a stud on the back of the jet that you can stick it onto. Needless to say, this is not the ideal way of storing it. I would have much preferred it if they would have attached it onto winch instead. The engines on the wings can be turned, even though they don't turn in the show, and there is a flick-fire missile on each side. Even if it's not much to look at, at least it's a very swooshable vehicle. On top of each wing there is a tile with the emblem of Latvaria. There was no such emplems on the jet in the cartoon, but they are useful pieces that make it clear whose jet it is, so I'm glad they included them. There is nothing inside the cockpit except for a seat and unless you want to ruin Dr. Doom's nice dark green cape, I wouldn't put him inside of it. They could have at least printed a control panel onto that empty 2x2 tile. Play Features Since this is a playset, let's look at all the play features it has to offer. Like all playsets, the building is open in the back so you can play inside. On the ground floor, there is a potted plant and... nothing else. Seriously? Is this all they could come up with for this floor? They could have included a security desk, a lounge, a second plant, or anything else! As it is, it's just a boring empty lobby. The first floor is a bit more interesting. There is a safe, a swiveling chair, and a pin board with various pictures of Spider-Man. There is one tile that reads: "The true identity of Spider-Man" which is supposedly what the villains are after. I wonder how Jameson got this information in the first place. Speaking of Jameson, the second floor is devoted to his office where he can sit and yell at his non-present employees, demanding "more pictures of Spider-Man!" It also has a swiveling chair as well as a desk with a lamp and a computer. There is a Technic beam connecting his desk with the ceiling of the first floor which you can remove in order to take off the upper half of the building, but it's difficult to do, so I don't recommend it. As you may have noticed in the picture above, there are a few red pegs sticking out of the building. These are for triggering the play features. Most of them are on the roof. There is one on what looks like an air conditioning unit. If you place Spider-Man holding is web-string on the jumper plate in front of it and push the peg, Spidey goes bungee-jumping off the building. Wee! There is also one that sticks out of the side of the building which when pulled triggers a trap door. The third red peg on the roof can be used to pop off the DBC sign. Why is it called the DBC, you ask? It stands for Daily Bugle Communications since in this version of Spider-Man, the Daily Bugle is not only a newspaper, but a news TV station as well, one that promotes its own highly biased views. So basically the Fox News of the Marvel universe. I guess if you're an old school Spider-Man fan, you could just leave off the "C" and have it just stand for Daily Bugle. The sign above the main entrance wont be so easily modified however. There is also a peg between the first and second floor which when pushed pops out one of the windows on the first floor. The safe is only attached to a couple of jumper plates and has some jumper plates on top of it as well, so you can easily attach the Doom jet's claw to it and rip it out of the building as seen on the back of the box. There are also some SNOT bricks on the corners of the building that you can attach spiderwebs or Spidey himself onto for some wall-crawling and webslinging action. This is not so much a play feature as it is just a feature, but as I mentioned earlier, there is a fire escape on the left side of the building. This was a neat idea as it helps it feel like a building in New York City, but it is executed very poorly. There is no hole big enough for the minifigs to climb down through, so they would have to climb down the ladders from the outside which makes no sense. No wonder Spider-Man always needs to rescue people from burning buildings. There is one more play feature in the form of the dumpster. You can open the lid, put a minifig inside, and make them jump by hitting a tab in the back. Remember, this is before the introduction of super jumpers, but nevertheless it's a pretty strange place to launch minifigs out of. I guess even Super Heroes like to do some dumpster diving. You don't think this was funny? No? Well, me neither, but that's the type of humor that this show loves to use. Sigh. Anyway, let's get on to the ratings. Ratings Design: 2/5 - The set looks ok. Despite many inaccuracies, the DBC building and the jet somewhat resemble their on-screen counterparts and don't look too bad, but they definitely could be better. Build: 1/5 - A mostly unchallenging and repetitive build with an attrocious amount of stickers. Minifigs: 4/5 - Definitely the strongest point of the set. Some of the figs could be better, but four out of five of them are exclusive to this set. Doctor Doom is easily the best and probably the most desirable one - unless the Fant4stic movie portraits him so badly that nobody will be interested in him, but that's impossible. Playability: 4/5 - As you would expect from a playset, the playability is quite high, although I still feel like there could have been more. Parts: 3/5 - Not many rare parts. If you're looking for parts for building your own skyscraper with tan walls and lots of doors and windows though, this set is for you. Price: 3/5 - At 476 parts for $50, this set is a bit pricey, but it is somewhat justified by all the large window and wall pieces. Overall: 3/5 - This set is mediocre at best. Playsets are always a good choice for Spider-Man sets since they give Spidey something to swing from, but unfortunately they are rarely pulled off well. The jet is blocky, the building is bare-bones, and the price feels too high. The only reason to get this set are the four exclusive minifigs. This set was discontinued early this year, but if you still see it on clearance somewhere, go ahead and get one for the minifigs and parts, or buy multiples and use the parts to build a better DBC building. I hope you enjoyed this review. It is part of the Reviewers Academy's 7th Anniversary. We're not doing a big celebration this year due to other commitments, but look out for more reviews with the 7th Anniversary banner soon. Now, if you'll excuse me, I am off to see Fant4stic. I hope it's as fantastic as it promises to be! (2 hours later) I was wrong! I was horribly, horribly wrong!	positive
Hahah, entertaining and informative, a great read- thanks for the review! On a side note I thought Fant-Four-Stic was....ok. On the poorer side of ok. The exposition felt like it was from a 3 hour film because it was so long and towards the middle it started to drag. The ending was terrible. Edited by Mutant Orc, 12 September 2015 - 09:53 PM.	positive
Yeah. I'm really hoping the concept art/Doom minifig joke is just that! I picked this set up on whim, mostly because a needed a building to add to a MOC, as a parts pack it's not a bad set at all.	positive
Thanks for the review, i've had that set for quite a while, and it's among my favorite Marvel Superheroes Sets actually. Compared to the other stuff we usually get to accompany the minifigs... All those "Laboratorys", the most recent Construction Site, and the "Hydra Fortress" .. yeah... You're being a little harsh here Maybe you're still suffering from PTSD after watching Fant-Four-Stic!	neutral
Aegis2000, on 13 September 2015 - 02:32 AM, said: This set is from 2013, Doctor Doom is completely based off the Comic version/ TV Show version, not the movie in any way. Anyways, nice review. I personally own this set, and it's a nice set, but could have been better. He's just joking about Doom.	neutral
I actually am surprised at the poor points this set has gotten, as this is one of my favorite sets that Marvel has put out. I actually would like to hear what your thoughts are on the USM - LEGO Dr. Doom comparison, Oky.

I'm glad you were joking about Doom. I'm not that big of a fanboy, but I had the need to correct you for some reason. With that said, I bought this set for the minifigures a few years ago. Looking back, I don't really care about the figures today like I did in 2013. The building is decent for the size of the set though. Thanks for the review.	neutral

Overall, I wish Marvel in particular would have more playsets in its theme (Batman has several great ones in the DC theme). But then again, if this is the best playset to date for Marvel, maybe it's better just to leave well enough alone. I would definitely like to see them attempt something in the $100+ (US) price range because I think it could be good; Marvel needs an equivalent to the Arkham Asylum set. Regarding this set, I saved myself some money and bought the 4 minifigs I needed (all but Spidey) on Bricklink for less than half the set price.

Personally, I thought your review was spot on and I very much enjoyed your tone. I'm not usually much of a mini-fig person, but I will admit I bought this set mostly for Dr. Doom (and considered Nova a bonus). Growing up, I was a big fan of the Fantastic Four and an even bigger fan of Dr Doom. I hope that someday the film rights will revert to Marvel and we'll finally get a FF film that respects the original source material and features a Dr Doom worthy of the name. As for the set itself, I don't have much use for playsets (not that there's anything wrong with them, I think the Marvel Lego line could use more of them in fact) and I didn't even realize it was linked to a specific show as I've fallen a bit out of touch with the franchise of late. I bought it; I built it; it sat a shelf for a while; I scrapped it for parts. I think most of it wound up as a greenhouse for my winter village set-up. It's not a _bad_ set, but I think you summed things up nicely when you called it mediocre. Thanks for the entertaining review.	neutral
Thanks for the review.I'm not a big fan of Spider Man sets, but this set really impressed me. This must because of the design of this set and the minifigures that included in this set.	positive
I think I'm the only person in the world who likes Fant4stic... Was it the best superhero movie? Not even close, but I didn't think it deserved the hate it got. It was just incredibly and clumsily mishandled. Anyways, great review. I might pick this one up if only for the Beetle fig.	negative
Hi again! They have arrived *wub*! They come dismantled inside the package instead of one piece like the Blackhole Stormtrooper did.

Hello everyone! By now many excited LEGO Star Wars fans have started receiving their UCS Falcon. Some of us here enjoy writing reviews and sharing our thoughts. I mentioned to Yoda that I was planning on doing a review of this set but it would likely take me a few weeks (of 1-2 hours per night) to finish building the set. Yoda suggested that I do the review as I go so everyone could see the progress of the set. What a great idea! So, here is the first entry. Feel free to comment along the way. I will try to post photos and updates every night on the build then wrap up the review when I complete the set. If you have any specific questions or photo requests, please be sure to ask. UCS Millennium Falcon Reviewed by Dunamis Set 10179 5195 Pieces $499.95 from LEGO Shop at home The Box: Obviously, this is a box like no other. First of all, it comes in its own shipping carton. Inside of that, there is a standard LEGO carton. Finally, inside the LEGO carton, we have the actual Millennium Falcon box and a nice little letter thanking you for buying the biggest LEGO set ever. Shipping box (Naboo set provided for scale) LEGO Carton and letter LEGO Carton The Millennium Falcon box is really quite nice. There are lots of photos and it does a good job of ?selling? the set. There are 8 individual pieces of tape that keep the lid on the box. The limited first edition comes with a seal on the lower left corner. Millennium Falcon Box (Naboo set provided for scale) Lifting the lid straight up reveals one compartment of several bags on the right. On the left, we find a thin, square box (like a pizza box) that contains the official certificate of authenticity, two sticker sheets and one enormous manual! Under the pizza box, we find two more compartments each filled with several typical LEGO bags. The box weighs 24 pounds! Stickers Pizza Box Pieces in compartments Not quite sure what the little 30th anniversary sticker is for yet. The Certificate of Authenticity is on heavy paper and is suitable for framing. More to come tomorrow. It's late here.	positive
Nice review. I'll be watching and waiting for the rest.	positive
Will follow this impatiently ;-) Really like the start of the review *y* You always seems to pull it of nicely, in comparission with the exasperating *yoda* X-D :-P Build On! Play On! On On!	positive
Many tks Dunamis for doing that, its really great and I can't wait monitoring your progress on the beast 8-? Like it was mentionned in another thread, the box looks less gigantic than I thought - remember the ISD box !! That was a huge box !! Is the instruction book in the pizza box ? How big is it ? I'm sure its really big and I hope for our sake that the colours are clearly marked X-D If you know what I mean :-D !! Tks againand I'm so looking forward to your next post !!

Tks for that comparison pic Dunamis ;-) OK the box is big !! I pictured it a tad smaller though !! I know what I don't like, its the fact that it has the regular Lego Star Wars logo on top with Vader. UCS sets should have a different iconography like they did in the past. Sure its a trivial detail but it adds to the fact of owning something special !! After all its the most expensive set ever as of now ;-) Happy building !! And we'll wait patiently for some cool pics later on :-P *yoda*	negative
Very expecting indeed. Waiting for your kind photo ... :-)	neutral
My gawd that manuel is huge!!!!! That's enough to put a sane man off of buying this set.......Thank gawd none of us are sane thats all i can say X-D Just how many technic pins does this monster need??? 8-? Judging by that one pic theres gotta be a lot in this set.	negative
Wow I never thought I'd be impressed by a box but I certainly am now. Any chance of seeing all 5000 bricks in a big pile? Vader, on Sep 28 2007, 10:14 AM, said: My gawd that manuel is huge!!!!!

I pictured it a tad smaller though !! *yoda* I don't have the UCS ISD but from the pic i can see that it is about the same thickness, slightly shorter but much wider than the MF. So this leads me to believe that dimension-wise the UCS MF is more compact. Also, notice how in the content, the parts fit in just nice without additional spare space for anything else. Strange isn't it that when TLC is responsible for the shipping, we see optimum usage of box spaces. X-D imagine if all boxes were this efficient. $4.99 sets would be no bigger than a match box! X-D X-D the MTT would be reduced to 1/4 its current size! X-D X-D X-D	neutral
Great review so far! I am looking forward to additional posts! As for the number of pins - from the Peeron inventory for the set, there are over 400 technic pins of various lengths! (insert the "my fingers hurt from building" emoticon) Keep the pictures coming!	positive
The Minifigs: As you can see, the minifigs are really nice. They even throw in an extra fleshie head! No doubt these will fetch quite a bit on the Bricklink and Ebay markets. I?m keeping mine. Continuing the Build This photo shows how well this model is put together. Notice that they use four of the three-hole beams per side to hold this together. I remember reading that you can hang this model from the ceiling. I don?t doubt it. These right angle Technic pieces are used to reinforce the structure of the model. You can see them used here: I was shocked at how many light gray plates are in this set. I have TWO tubs full of these: The infrastructure is now complete: I got hung up for about an hour looking for one of these: Turns out, LEGO gave me an extra left wedge and shorted me a right wedge. So frustrating! I had to stead one off my 6211 Star Destroyer. It is not a very common piece by the way?	neutral
Hey nice review, im up to about the same point as you (page 70 to be exact) , tho i didnt have that missing piece thankfully! I think lego have done a much better job at packing the lego this time, i remember it taking me much longer to find pieces on the UCS ISD build	positive
So I see they even do mistakes on these |-/ That beast looks really sturdy !! That is great !! Are these yellow parts new ? I am not a Technic fan and never saw these before. Another question for you: is the instruction book easy to follow, especially regarding the colours. Does the black rally stands out comparing to the dark bley and so on ? I sure hope so ;-) Can't wait to see moer hehe *yoda*	neutral
I have been taking photos for this review for a few months and I finally took the rest of the photos last night. All the parts. If you want tan, this is the set to get! Main model. The garage is a great addition... ...but the car only just fits! The main house is very nice looking. The windows extend to the sides... ...but not the back. The chimney and drainage work very well, and I love the "basement". I think the front works very well. When I was making this I was multitasking doing weight training; do a set, do a step, do a set... and I ended up missing one of the row paths. I discovered this after I finished the basement. :-| The removable roof reveals BYO floors. Probably why this is called a Model house! The roof was quite interesting to build. This is my first large house set so it all was very new to me. I love the garage door. More nice pipework. This photo I mis-focused but there isn't much to see anyway! The door is a nice touch. The grill to the right on both sides is not just decoration as it hides the hinges for the door. I also made one of the sub-models. I was considering keeping this but I decided against it. Once again the sides have windows... but the back doesn't. The truck is there to make the photo more worthwhile! The roof to this one doesn't come off easily as all the tiles are used for the front. Just to clarify; these houses aren't attached so you can arrange them however you want. The fronts are quite elaborate and it seems that Lego were trying to make this almost like a simpler market street. The truck is too small for a minifig... ...but it probably was my favourite car. Thoughts I highly recommend this set. In most countries it is good value for money, including Australia. The design is excellent and three instructions are included. (The third is a school. If anyone has made it and wants to post photos feel free! At least one person at EB has made it.) I love how each house has its own car. Due to the way the primary model is made it is a bit weak at the corner, but that was a design choice. My only real complaint about this set is how Lego is going though a mould transition and thus some roof slopes are rough, others are smooth. I can accept either, and Lego has been moving to smooth slopes for years now, but to have a set with about 50/50 is annoying. (The MTT was the same.) But that is my only gripe with this excellent set. *wub*	positive
Thanks for the review, and tons of pics! I've been wanting to pick this one up since I saw it. I thought the 4956 Creator House was nice, but this Model Town House is in a completely different league! I also like the alternate models that you can see in the catalogues.	positive
A beautiful and humorous review with very fine pics. *y* A fantastic set, full of neat details and in a wonderful color scheme. Great for every City builder for sure. I guess we waited for sets like that. We dreamed about them. I?m glad we got them now. :'-) EDIT: Congrats! It seems you?ve got your bucket back.... :-P	positive
I found the use of parts well done by the designers. I made a car and then tried to make a house from a different instruction book. I could not as several pieces were already used in the car. Nice to see them using all the parts like that rather than having a lot of "extra" bits. Moral of the story: one instruction book at a time. *sweet*	neutral
Lasse D, on Sep 28 2007, 08:03 AM, said: It sure is a great value compared to what you get in the Building Bonanzas (no cars and less detail). I was all for the white house until I saw this set. I still wouldn't mind it though. :-D Lasse D, on Sep 28 2007, 08:03 AM, said: Would it be hard to modify the cars to fit minifigs better? The problem with the blue truck is a lack of headroom. However the truck is quite low and I can't see it being too hard to change and still have it looking good. Asuka, on Sep 28 2007, 08:30 AM, said: Great for every City builder for sure.

Thank you very much for the review Sinner. I definitly *wub* this set. This will make a great addition for us "Townies". I thought the size was too small. I plan to make my house fit practically the whole baseplate. Plus I will definitly add floors, that looked :-D . I can't believe TLC skimped on the floors.	positive
I too have bought this set and the only thing I notice which is a bit odd, with the exception of there being no floors in the house is the lack of a steering wheel in the car!	negative
Sinner. You have convinced me. I bought this set yesterday when it was on sale at International LEGO weekend in Sk?rb?k.	positive
Sinner, thanks for this outstanding review! I am glad that I had read this review in advance, before making my purchase on this set earlier with my girlfriend. We built this set for a total of 3 hours, to complete this beauty, in about 2 hours ago. There are stars circling around my head at this very moment, when I post this reply. I must admit from the bottom of my heart, that this is an wonderful piece of house, that simply shows the beauty of it, with the European kind of houses, where there is a garage. Furthermore, there is a lovely blue car. I am seeing stars right now, in the middle of the night, and I must drop a thanks to you personally as well. Although it is empty from its interior unlike the 4996 Beach House, but this set has the majestic look which simply place a "Wow" factor in front of it upon completion. At the moment, we had plans for getting the second set next month, to build the other design as well. Hopefully, I will be able to share with you guys, all of my different Creators sets, with its alternate designs as well in the near future.	positive

i actually bought this set last Monday as it was reduced to 14.99.....it actually not a bad little set considering the size and part count, has a decent array of functions. its a nice little set....the B model looks just as good so i might buy a second set, as you get the bucket left over and i need that bucket for another set.

Remember when I said in my review of 7090 to expect a review after I went to ToysRus? Well, somehow things didn?t work out, but fortunately I?m finally reviewing my latest purchases, starting with 7091 Catapault Defense, which happens to be one of the best sets in the Castle line. The Box and Instructions: Lego box art is at it?s highest point ever these days, with lots of special effects and great action poses. The castle theme is no exception, and 7091 isn?t either. I?ll let the box speak for itself: I love the back of the castle boxes as well, since they give another action scene and other neat info like a layout of all the accessories. The Contents: Only the bare essentials as usual: piece bags and instructions. I seriously wish they still put mini catalogs inside sets like they did when I was young, but I guess they are too expensive to make or something. Ah well, can?t have everything. No picture of the instructions this time, but since that isn?t necessary I?ll just say that they are fine, and do not have a problem with distinguishing dark gray from black. The Pieces: Here?s your basic shot of every piece included, minus a few extra pieces like an extra Viking horn and black skeleton leg. Not too shabby for a 10 USD set. There?s a lot of nice pieces in 7091, as you can see (and this doesn?t include the accessories or minifig parts!). The brown plates, wheels, and spoked things are always useful, and the dark blue and gold slopes are really cool. However, there?s also a fair amount of technic in here, so be warry. As usual for the castle line, 7091 has a heaping helping of accessories. Most of them are old pieces recolored, but the ball on chain (what?s the actual name, could someone tell me?) and the shields are brand new. I actually like the new skeleton weapon, since it?s fairly detailed and was really the only way TLC could make a part like that. And yes, the shields ARE printed (quite nicely too, if I do say so myself). Plus, you get Viking horns (always useful to have), a grey boulder, a basket, and 3 helmets. Not a half bad deal, eh? Oh, who am I kidding ? it?s awesome! Minifigures: Ah yes, one of the highlights of any castle set. You get 2 soldiers and 2 skellies this time, all with different weapons. The two soldiers are just regular Crown troops with different faces ? nothing special, except that they are awesome anyway. The skeletons on the other hand are much more interesting: an archer and a black skellie! Archers cool, of course, but I know many don?t like the printing on the black skeletons. Well, let me say that I don?t mind it so much. The only real problem is that the eyes are dark red instead of just red, which makes the printing a bit less noticeable. And I?ve been through it before that the new skeleton molds in general don?t bother me at all ? go skeletons! The Finished Set: Alright, there?s two builds in this set, and I?ll start with the smaller: the skeleton barricade. Okay, so it?s nothing special, but it?s cool all the less. The shield on the front and the slanted spears are nice touches. Here?s just how the skeletons can tower over their own barricade: with a little step. Ah, the catapault. The lovely catapault. Seriously, I love TLC?s design. Very effective, and also very realistic, especially compared to KK. Love the side details and the swiveling base, and you gotta love the clever use of that basket. Playability: Yes, I?ve made it a tradition now to write stories for any castle set I buy (and this isn?t the last one, you can be sure of that!). Here?s one featuring everything in 7901: Oh, and here?s a small ship I made out of all the pieces in this set plus a couple extra figures and weapons from my copy of 7901. Not half bad, IMO, considering what I had to work with. Overall Rating: Presentation: 9/10 Pieces: 8/10 Minifigures: 9/10 Finished model: 9/10 Playability: 8/10 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Final Score: 8.6/10 Once again, I highly recommend the reviewed set. Castle is possibly the best theme this year, and this set is one of many that prove it. As with all castle sets, it?s best if you buy several if you want to truly enjoy it, but this set alone is also impressive in both design and pieces and minifigures. Get at least one if you have even a slight liking for Castle. Edited by KimT, 10 August 2008 - 01:31 PM.	positive
Very nice review! Seems like I'll be getting my first Castle set soon.. *wub* Grevious, on Oct 10 2007, 09:33 PM, said: Most of them are old pieces recolored, but the ball on chain (what’s the actual name, could someone tell me?) That would be a flail. ;-)	positive
Very nice review! I like the amount of pics and that alternate model. I wouldn't have thought of making a ship from those parts, I once made a larger, Crownie-ized skellie barrier instead.	positive
A very nice review with good, although perhaps a little too big, pictures.... *y* Now I realized that this catapult?s able to swivel, that?s neat, thank you! X-D	positive

i just got this today. It is amazing like my other two castle sets: the joust and the crossbow. I am currently starting to save for 2008 but for Christmas i think i want the Skeleton Carridge and the Naboo N-1 Fighter.	positive
Great review! I just built the original, and this one has clear advantages over the original (though I wish Lego would stop putting torsos with defined breasts and curves on children). I really like pretty much every change. I won't be getting it, and I'd be lying if I said I'm not a little disappointed. For the first four years, my mother-in-law got me the new winter village set for Christmas; after the last two, which didn't really fit thematically in my display, I had hoped for a new one--particularly since my daughter is getting to be around the age where she can play with them. I mention her specifically because I've seen lots of people dismiss those who are a bit disappointed as rabid adults who don't care about kids getting cool sets, and I don't think that's fair. I may have to see how much some of the parts go for on Bricklink. The rerelease is better than the original, but not good enough that I'd want to spend $80 to get a set that's nearly identical to one I have.

Great review, thanks Oky! IMO, the only significant improvements over the 2009 version are the figures, toys, and printed shop sign. As I already have the older one I'll have to give this one a pass.	neutral
Thanks for the excellent review! Unfortunately it only highlights how minimal the upgrades are (though they are nice). Definitively a pass for me. Let's hope LEGO does continue to make the more realistic winter village sets (versus Santa). I'm not opposed to a rehash, the post office could use some improvements for example, but this one is just a wee bit minimal.	negative
I missed out on the first one, but I love the improvements made in this version, like the tree having an actual brown trunk so it looks less like an artificial one, and the carolers as well. I may pick this up, but I'm sorry to those of you who already have one.	positive
I bought it and I'm very happy with it.	positive
Cheers for putting up the review. Some nice improvements, but not enough for me to pick it up. The original set is good enough for me. Pity the poll has no option "Yes, but only in addition to new sets, not in stead of new sets". Edited by Withacee, 01 December 2015 - 09:38 AM.	neutral
Thanks for a nice review. I am building it as we speak, and I like it so far. Since I didn't have the old one, I can't complain.	positive
Thanks for the review. They definitely improved upon the original, but since I already own the original, I can't justify this set also, unfortunately. It seems to be the trend. But I'm sure there are a lot of first timers out there too that will snatch this up since it is a really lovely building. And the updates make it better for sure.	neutral
Thanks Oky for this fine review. I agreed with your sentiments on the unnecessary rants. I also owned the 2009 version and even though there are minor improvements. There must be a logical reason for its release again but is not entirely the same. I felt is an excellent opportunity for others to acquire this design especially after six years ago. As for myself, I will probably buy this if my spare funds allow me to own this set.	neutral
Thanks for the kind comments everyone! I like hearing your opinions on this set. Withacee, on 01 December 2015 - 09:37 AM, said: Pity the poll has no option "Yes, but only in addition to new sets, not in stead of new sets". I don't think that would be a realistic option as that would mean that they would have to spend twice the resources on this theme which I don't think they are ready to do, but if more people would like this option, I can add it to the poll. Joebot, on 01 December 2015 - 08:33 PM, said: After mocking people for holding a particular opinion, you then turn around and ask people to express their opinion?? No thanks. I guess I'll keep my opinions to myself. I certainly don't want to be labeled a "hater." I'm not mocking anyone. I just think that some people need to calm down a bit and that TLG is getting more hate than they deserve for this set, but that's just my opinion and you're welcome to disagree with it. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, including you and me. And yes, I would love to hear your thoughts on this matter because I would like to have a friendly discussion on this subject.	neutral
I didn't own the original toy shop so I bought it this time around. I just finished building it Saturday and I love it! However, I wish they had both re-released this one AND came out with a new addition to the village. :)	positive
REVIEW - 42044 - DISPLAY TEAM JET INTRODUCTION The smallest of the 2016 sets, is the Display Team Jet. It doesn't seem to have lots of functionality, but maybe the landing gear is retractable. This set kind of reminds me to the 9394 - Jet Plane, although it's obviously a lot smaller. As you can read in my review of the 42052 - Heavy Lift Helicopter basically anything flying is +1 for me, so let's find out if this set also fits the bill. Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions. SET INFORMATION Number: 42044 Title: Display Team Jet Theme: Technic Released: 2016 Part Count: 113 Box Weight: 193 gr Box Dimensions: 15,4 cm x 13,8 cm x 5,9 cm Set Price (MSRP): € 9,99 Price per Part: € 0,088 Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX Being a small set, it obviously comes in a small box. The Display Team Jet is an Aerobatics Jet, used in air shows. On the box it's flying rather high, but at least it's at a safe distance from the crowd. Front side shows the main model, together with a small section indicating you can use Digital Building instructions to build this model. BACK SIDE The back side shows the B-model, a Stunt Plane. And again a reference to the apps for Digital Building instructions. More on the Stunt Plane later. CONTENT OF THE BOX The box contains: 2 Instructions Booklets (A- and B-model) 1 Sticker Sheet 3 Technic Liftarms 2 Bags INSTRUCTION BOOKLETS Both the instructions for the A- and B-model are included in the box. STICKER SHEET A lot of stickers for such a small set. Apparently no panel is left untouched. LIFTARMS Three liftarms unsealed, nothing out of the ordinary for a small set. BAGS Two bags containing the rest of the parts. HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This section describes the new and/or otherwise interesting parts. YELLOW 5L AXLES The 5L Axle in Yellow has never been released before, so it's one of the new parts for this year. BLACK 7L FLEX AXLES For the layman this seems a common part, but the 7L Soft Axle actually has never been released in black before. Combined with the re-release of the 19L Soft Axle in black, this will open up lots of possibilities. For those of you thinking you've read this text before; you are right, the new Drag Racer contains these new 7L Flex Axles too. WHITE PANELS This small set comes with a whopping 10 panels. Great for the ones who like panels. Not so great if you think TLG is using too much panels lately. RUDDER This part, the Small Bionicle Wing, is the same as the one used in last year's 42033 - Record Breaker. PART LIST This set contains 113 parts, all listed below. THE BUILD This is the collection of parts, used to build the Jet. It sure looks like we are getting a landing gear. The build is fun, but pretty straightforward. There aren't any special or cool techniques used in this set. It almost took me more time to apply all the stickers than to build the actual model. FINISHED MODEL The finished Jet does look cool though. The white and yellow color scheme, combined with the stickers, work really well. I have seen people refer to the plane as being orange, but it's definitely yellow. Technic (or LEGO in general) tends to have some color variation when it comes to yellow. I do concur this is the warmer variant of yellow, but it's not orange. The back of the plane looks nice too, although I am not a big fan of the rudder part. It looks too detailed, compared to the other panels. It's not a big deal though, and maybe it's just me. PARTS LEFT Only three common parts left. FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS This set has a single feature and that is a retractable landing gear. It's operated by the black 12T Double Bevel Gear near the cockpit. In the following picture you can see the landing gear retracted. This image shows the landing gear when the plane is ready for landing. Hopefully the pilot will roll the plane before landing, but you probably know what I mean VIDEO Here's s short video demonstrating the Display Team Jet. B-MODEL This set also includes the building instructions for the B-model, a Stunt Plane. The building experience for the Stunt Plane is more or less the same as for the Jet. Well, what do you expect when both models are planes with a limited number of parts. For an alternative model the Stunt Plane looks fine. There's not a lot of functionality in this plane, but it's worth mentioning that the tail wheel allows the plane to roll on a flat surface. The plane also has working propellors. Both functions are demonstrated in the video. Unfortunately, the landing gear of the Stunt Plane is not retractable. PARTS LEFT A couple of extra leftover parts, but it's nice to see that most of the parts have been used in the B-model as well. Actually, there's probably an extra yellow Technic Smooth 1/2 Bush left. I just found it on my desk, but it could belong to one of the other sets. VIDEO Here's a video demonstrating the Stunt Plane. SUMMARY Two nice planes for 13 bucks, that's basically what you get. Both models look good and the set has some interesting new parts. Especially the 7L Flex Axle will be very popular. It comes with a decent collection of white panel, although they are very common nowadays. Both models have limited functionality, but each of them has at least one function to give the model some playability for kids, other than the swooshability that is. Okay, it might lack some proper functions, but I still think kids will love this set. I can see kids running around with one of the planes in their hands. All in all I think this set delivers what you'd expect. SCORE Let's see how this set flies! Remember that the grades are based on it being a small set. Obviously a set like this, cannot be compared with a Mercedes flagship. 8 DESIGN For a small set, the model looks very authentic. 7 BUILDING EXPERIENCE No surprises. 7 FEATURES Just the retractable landing gear. 8 PLAYABILITY It has swooshability, so I see kids running around with this model. 7 PARTS Lots of panels, if you are into that. 8 VALUE FOR MONEY Can't go wrong with these small sets. 7,5 FUN FOR KIDS More image can be found on my Flickr page. Thank you for reading. I hope you enjoyed it.	positive
While I can see kids enjoying this, I'm not sure I would buy. The flex axles are nice, and it is a decent number of white panels but I think I would get better return out of a larger parts set. Fantastic review though, and your pictures show off this tiny model better than the box art does.	negative
Thanks for the nice review! The landing mechanism looks quite cute. Aren't the yellow axles 5L, not 4L? (Very strange that they would release such a part).	positive
It says 5l in the parts list.	neutral
For 10 Euros very usefull parts. I like it as well as other 2016 sets. I like the gear retracting mechanism a lot. Very good set for good price. Thanx for good review. :) Max	positive
MegaRoi, on 01 December 2015 - 10:56 AM, said: Hi there, nice model, great review! I almost reverse engineered this model, but used wrong parts for landing wheels, didn't know how to fix the nose proper, and so on. So i was very interested in this model and i like playing with it. I love the reviews, but i think i have to mention, that the yellow axle must be a 5L! The picture shows a 5L, and a 5L would fit the size of the model. The cart has also a 5L in yellow. What sitze is the yellow axle in this seit. Really 4L as written in the text? Greetings, Robert The picture of the manual says 4x 5L yellow axle, and that seems to line up with what im seeing in the pics as well So i assume the 4L is a typo	neutral
Good review, as always Jim When I first saw this set I thought that it would make a great parts pack for me, as that I have about 20 white pieces in my Technic collection (all from 42043) and this set has some really useful ones, all for a cheap price. Those 7L flex axles will be extremely useful in my current build I'm doing	positive
Nice review, even with the missing demonstration video of the A-model! Looks like this is an excellent panel pack for the price, and those soft axles will go down a treat. Will this set be the dark horse of 1H 2016...?	positive
I am definitely getting set for the panels!	positive

Fixed the video and fixed the stars in the voting. Thanks for paying attention guys	neutral
I just built the A model, and I rather like it. It is much bigger than it looks from the box - about 30 studs long. There is only one function - the landing gear - but it works very nicely. Apart from that, it's a very solid build, and achieves an elegant shape with an absolute minimum of parts. I don't usually get excited about small sets, but this one appeals to me. I like the feeling that every single piece has a purpose.	positive
Boulderer, on 27 December 2015 - 05:44 PM, said: My favourite of the 2016 sets I've built so far. I'd go so far as to say this is the best "budget" set in years. I would have loved this when I was a kid ... great "swoosh ability" ?????? Good to hear that, im gonna check the toy shops in my lunch break tomorrow, see if they got their shipment in yet, if they have, ill definitely buy one of these little sets	positive
Thats a cool little mod, two small nigles though, 1, your navigation lights are flipped on the main wings, 2, the panels on the tail i *think* were supposed to be the intakes for the jet engine, by using them to close up the tail you've turned it into a glider Cant wait untill i find one of these on shelves!	positive
Got this at the weekend, mainly for the parts, but built it first. Agreed with other comments - awesome swooshability.	positive
REVIEW - 42046 - GETAWAY RACER INTRODUCTION Starting with the 42010 - Off-road Racer and 42011 - Race Car in 2013, TLG released two sets in the first half of each year, using a pullback motor. The pullback motor allows the model to be pulled back, followed by forward motion. Usually there's no apparent relation between the two set, other than the ability to combine them into an alternate build. This year there seems to some sort of Cops and Robbers scene going on. A Getaway Racer and a Police Interceptor. That can't be a coincidence. Makes you wonder who will be victorious, the good guys or the bad guys. Let's find out! Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions. SET INFORMATION Number: 42046 Title: Getaway Racer Theme: Technic Released: 2016 Part Count: 170 Box Weight: 302 gr Box Dimensions: 26,0 cm x 13,8 cm x 5,9 cm Set Price (MSRP): € 19,99 Price per Part: € 0,118 Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX The box has the same dimensions as previous year's pullback motor sets. In the lower right corner there's a visual explanation of the pullback mechanism. The dark model with it's decals sure looks like a cool hot rod. CONTENT OF THE BOX The box contains: 1 Instructions Booklet 1 Sticker Sheet 2 Technic Liftarms 1 Pullback Motor 3 Bags INSTRUCTION BOOKLET Just a single booklet. Unfortunately no booklet for the alternate model. STICKER SHEET The sticker sheet contains a lot of cool stickers with flames and skulls etc. PULLBACK MOTOR AND LIFTARMS The pullback motor and two liftarms are found unbagged. BAGS A total of three bags containing the majority of the parts. HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This section describes the new and/or otherwise interesting parts. Actually, this set is the only set of 1H 2016 which doesn't use any new parts, not even parts in a new color. TIRES The Getaway Racer uses four low profile tires (Tire 37 x 22 ZR). RIMS The rims are Wheel 30.4mm D. x 20mm in Pearl Gold, found in 12 other sets. PANELS This set contains three #3 Panelsand three #4 Panels in black. PART LIST This set contains 171 parts, all listed below. THE BUILD This being a small model, I won't show any building steps. Let's skip right to the finished model. Below you can see the end result. In my opinion the model looks great. It's got that hot rod vibe going on and the stickers add darkness to the vibe. Slight problem with this set is that it really needs the stickers to finish the look. Otherwise it's quite dull, with black and dark grey liftarms and panels. The rear view shows the pullback motor connected directly to the rear axle. In this image you can also clearly see the exhaust pipes on the side, which are very well executed. The 3x3 Technic Discs with stickers, used in the rim, result in only seeing a part of the rim. This works very well with the golden rims. The bottom view shows the chassis of the car. Nothing really noteworthy, as you would expect from a pullback set. VIDEO The following video gives you an overview of the finished model. PARTS LEFT These six parts are left after building the model. Seems about right. FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS This being a pullback motor set, it only has a single feature. The video below demonstrates the acceleration of the vehicle. My girlfriend was kind enough to catch the model before it fell to the ground. Or did it hit something before it fell to the ground?! VIDEO This video shows the pullback functionality. B-MODEL The alternate model is a combined build with the Police Interceptor, which you can see on the back of the box. Unfortunately the instructions for the combined B-model are not included, so I didn't get a chance to build it. This would make for a fun challenge, building the B-model without the instructions. SUMMARY Pullback sets are not the most technically advanced models, so you can't expect any other functionality than hitting the walls in your house. However, I think they are very appealing to kids. The fact that this year's pullback sets form a duo adds to the fun. In my opinion TLG hit the nail on the head with the Getaway Racer and Police Interceptor. The Getaway Racer looks very badass, which is something you don't see every day in a Technic set. SCORE How do I grade the bad guy in this year's duo. 8 DESIGN It looks so cool, but it does need the stickers. 7 BUILDING EXPERIENCE Nothing out of the ordinary. 7 FEATURES Limited to the pullback-and-drive functionality. 7 PLAYABILITY Combined with the Police Interceptor, kids will love it. It does need it's Nemesys though. 7 PARTS Collection of common parts. Gold rims could be interesting. 8 VALUE FOR MONEY Pullback sets always deliver a certain value. 7,3 HIT IT! More image can be found on my Flickr page. Thank you for reading. I hope you enjoyed it.	positive
Another great review Jim! And again i love the model, those pearl gold wheels This one definitely goes on the "buy on sight" list	positive

Great review with high quality pictures, well done!! I'm glad you took the time to do it properly. Cool that you have built both models. I agree with the mudguards. They sure look good on this model.	positive
I was waiting especially for review of this set. Let me add few things about this... thing. It all will be complainging of person who works with these type of machines, so if you just want a unusual machine in your collection, ignore my complaining :) I see underground loaders almost every day, and believe me, this model would now work in the underground mine. First of all, its cab should stick out more from the frame. Each loader has cab placed out of the chassis, to provide better view for the driver. In this class of machine it would help a bit, but in low loader ones it is extremely important: This is the view from the cab of a low profile loader (looking at front - and yes, front of the machine is where engine is placed, because at least at KGHM all machines drive engine forward): Another thing about that cab is that seat and steering wheel/joysticks are placed perpendicularly to the machine chassis, to provide same view for driving forward and backwards. So another weak spot of the set. The model lacks of trans clear lights on the engine part, because all machines that work underground have same lamps on front and back. Another thing that comes to my mind is that warning light and antena would not live too long in the mine, becuase it could be torn apart by ramming into tunnels roofs. It does resemble shape of underground machine, but not a loader. Only machine that comes to my mind is something that are used for moving/placing hydraulic support jacks in tunnels. Sorry for poor quality, I didn't find better picture of it: It does have claw, four wheels and articulated chassis, but have much greater range of movement of the arm. Anyway, I'd give it at least 3/5 for overall look. Model itself, as a set, looks unfinished (or cut down on pieces after visit of an accountant...) For me it looks like engine part was built differently, with knobs for steering/claw operating sticking out from back. Claw needs almost seven full turns of the worm gear to close from opened position, and is rather annoing to use it in way it is built in this model. Bracket that holds bevel gears responsible for steering is rather loose, being hold in place by single 3/4 pin. On the other hand, the steering works very well. It seems that lack of differential will be more common in LEGO sets, becuase it is another model that have fake engine driven by single wheel (like in old russian RC cars...). I am OK with that, but it is a pitty that this model has only R2 engine. Thing that I do not like the most in this model is how the claw arm works. First of all, it barelly lifts the claw of the ground, the movement could be much better. And it has major design flaw - universal joints are not placed in line with articulation points, and this is main reason of 5L axle not being suported on both sides under the turntable. While rainsing the arm, it bends a little! I really would like to see this model built differently, with normal bucket and better range of movement.

Thanks for the thorough comments! I agree that the set has some limitations, both in construction and realism, but I think they're acceptable given the pricepoint and size. The antenna is definitely ludicrous - I really do suspect they had a surplus of the swords to use up! And yes, the way the steering knob is mounted is loose. I also noticed that the u-joints to the claw are not in the right spot like you mentioned, but didn't include it since it still works fine. That axle coming forward to the claw has a very long unsupported section that does bend a bit when you raise and lower the claw. It works, but is a bit of a cheat that I'm kinda surprised they let through. I just checked and the bucket from 8043 is a couple studs too wide for this set. I'm betting that was seriously considered, but it'd have meant scaling the whole thing up and that would have put it into a higher price point. Or they could have pulled the mold for the 8x14 bucket back out and remade it for this set... I really like the model you built! And that's interesting about the cabs being basically flush with the top but sticking out the side. In image searching as part of my research, I found both that style and ones like this, with the cab sticking up more (like the photo of the Caterpillar one in my review). I wonder if that's a US/European difference, or different types of mining, or what, because both styles definitely exist in the real world.	neutral
Think this is the only 1H set I'll be getting. Guess I'm waiting for 2H for the rest of the construction stuff! This set looks okay to me; it includes the instructions for both models, which is cool, and includes some great parts. I like that it's not just another bucket loader and that it actually tries something different, too.	positive

Lego 42045 Technic Hydroplane Racer Thanks to Lego and EuroBricks for making this review possible! This was supposed to be a preview-review, before the Dec 1 release date for the set, but it got stuck in customs or something and didn't arrive in time. Well, I'd rather do a good, late review than a rushed review, so here it is. Name: Hydroplane Racer Set Number: 42045 Pieces: 180 Price: $19.99 Minifigs: 0 Theme: Technic Year of Release: 2016 Links: Bricklink Brickset The Box Standard Technic box. Action photo, 2-in-1 logo, inset of functions. And the new "try our app" logo in the corner. The Box Back More standard stuff with the B-model and a larger app ad. The Contents 3 bags, two manuals (yes, despite all the ads for their instructions app, they included printed manuals for both the main and B models!), a BIG sticker sheet, and two loose black beams. The Interesting Parts There's a lot of panels in this set. Some are new colors (the blue curved panel) and the L-shaped blue panels are a new mold. I see them being used as mudguards on future sets (or maybe even this year; I haven't looked at the other 2016 Technic sets in detail yet). The hose, soft axle 7 long in black is new as well. The normal 7 axle in yellow is a new color too, and I have no idea why it's in this set. Both models use it in invisible places, so there's no reason other than making it easier to grab the right length axle to have it. I assume other sets this year are using it, but I'm not sure. The Manual And the dumbing-down continues. Now they have to show people to compare axle lengths to the 1:1 prints on the page that have always been there. But how does the 1:1 work on the app? Might have to look into that... (for the record... I pulled out my phone and tried to find the app in the Google store. Couldn't find it. So then I went to the Lego website shown on the page and it had a link to it. Turns out it wasn't showing up because it's tablet only, so Google wasn't showing it to me on my phone. I'll try again later with a tablet...) Starting the Build Two Technic standards. A bunch of pieces linked together to make a specific pattern of holes, and an engine block. Some Weirdness This felt very weird to me - making the crankshaft for the engine, they have you build it right to left. I don't know if it's because I'm a lefty or what, but it felt awkward. I need to look in some old manuals and see if it's always been this way... (nope! I randomly looked at 2013's set 42000 Racer, and it builds it left to right.) Assembling the Core Here's the core of the racer, upside down. The engine block, some gears at each end, and a couple boat studs for smooth gliding. And yes, they cheated and those are only attached on two studs instead of all 4. I'm always amazed at how Lego geometry keeps finding interesting ways that it works. Like here, with those boat studs. They fit perfectly into the bottom of the brick and against the beam. The Front End Up front we get a standard blue seat with a couple "hidden" wheels behind it. A boat doesn't typically have wheels, but these will drive the mechanisms of this model, so we'll let it slide. An odd part choice here though - in the very front there are two tan "axle pin without friction" parts holding that 3 long liftarm on. Why? There's no need in either model for the non-friction pin, and there's lots of the normal blue axle pins in the set. So why include these two different pins? And All Done! It looks like a huge jump here, but it's really not. The front and rear connect to each other, and then a bunch of big panels are added that make the model look WAY bigger. The stickers on this set really make it work. Without them it's pretty bland and boring, so I recommend using them. From the Rear At the back we have a fan to propel the boat. That's not so accurate. All the images I can find of real-life boats use props in the water. But since this is a non-floating model, we have to make some tweaks I guess. There also should be fins going down into the water for stability and hydroplaning, but again, had to drop that. Here's an example of a real boat: You can see they nailed the overall look quite well. The Underside For those that want to see the mechanicals, here's the underside of the model. Minifig Scale Technic? Nope, not quite. A fig will fit the seat, but sticks out of the cockpit and can't fit a helmet at all. So close... Starting the B Model Again with the engine block, but this time an opposing 4 instead of inline. An Odd Part It's rare for Lego to include parts specific to the B-model, so I was curious when I found this 2-axle with pin, a fairly new part. In the main model, it's used in a place that a normal 3 pin would have been fine, and it's the only one of these in the whole set, so it obviously must be needed in the B-model. Sure enough, there's an assembly here that needs it: The Front of the Boat More upside-down building. And that silver piston is basically only there as a spacer. It has no real function. (Yet.... it turns out later an axle goes into it, so it's a support for one end of the axle.) Adding the Wheels We keep building around the engine. This model uses the same wheel setup as the main model. Taking Shape The B-model instructions tell you to put the stickers on in case you haven't - they actually did a good job making the sticker work on either model. But the silver piston used as a cross-brace is a bit weird. It can spin, so that axle hole on the side ends up facing whatever way it wants. The Back End The flex axles are used here under the panels just for appearance and to support the exhausts at the right angle. Same fan propulsion as the main model, and just as wrong here :) Worse, the gearing is switched. In the main model, the pistons and fan spin pretty quickly as you push the boat across the floor. In this one, they turn very slowly. More Instruction Weirdness I'm always curious at how Lego decides to do instructions. Here's how the panels on one side of the boat are assembled. For the mirror image on the other side, they tell you to put all 3 pins into the short panel as step 1 (2 black and a blue), add the white piece as step 2, and then add teh second panel and stickers as step 3. Why two different ways? All Done Here's a similar angle as most of the official images. Looks ok. I noticed though how obvious the wheels are. The back of the box image is a lower angle that hides them more. And I like the mudguard panels as seats. Pretty clever. From the Side I'm not fond of the profile. It doesn't sit level like I think it should. The wheels are a stud too low sticking out of the bottom. The Underside Like most B-models, there are compromises. There's pins and axles sticking out, but that's what you do when faced with a limited piece selection. Minifig Scale Yet? Nope, not quite. A bit too big this time. I think the driver is supposed to sit in the seat with knees over the front of the guard (where the grey pin is). So the minifig is way too small. Spare Pieces Very few leftovers in this B-model. The Conclusion So, what's my conclusion on this model? The B-model is fairly meh, and too similar to the main model. However, I LOVE the hydroplane racer itself. It looks great and is very swooshable. For the price, it's surprisingly large thanks to the big panels on the sides, Yes, this is one set that really needs the stickers to look good, but they look great and are well worth putting on. The Ratings Value: 9/10 - Close to 10 cents a piece, and a fairly large model for the price. Design: 9/10 - Looks great other than the tiny fan on the back. Minifigs: n/a - I was tempted to give a score since a minifig almost fits, but that'd be cheating. Playability: 8/10 - Not much functionality other than the engine and fan spinning, but very swooshable and sturdy enough to be played with. Parts: 9/10 - A bunch of panels (including some new ones), just about every kind of Technic pin, and quite a few thin liftarms . Overall: 9/10 - The set is a solid winner, as long as your satisfied with the main model.	positive
Again, great review with superb pictures. The white and blue certainly works very well with your dark backdrop. Thorough review for such a small model. Small in size but great as a set. Tell me, why did I let you review this one?!	positive
Thanks for a great review! Too bad there is only one blue curved panel in this set. My opinion on the frictionless axlepins is that the flex axle might be easier to stick in them than in regular/blue axlepins...

Flex axle will fit in both, but using tan pins doesn't require strength. Conncetion with tan pins is weaker too.	neutral
Great review! Im a bit undecided on the set though, it has some nice parts (4 cil engine in such a small set!) and it looks good, but also a bit small and simple, not sure if it stands up to the standards of the small tracked loader or similar for sets of this size, and as a parts pack (for panels/flaxles) the display team jet is infinitely better. Ill probably pick one up, but right now i really want another tracked loader... (last one was sacrificed to the MOD gods)	neutral
REVIEW - 42038 - ARCTIC TRUCK INTRODUCTION Arctic vehicles aren't new to LEGO. Back in 2000 the Town theme already had several small orange arctic vehicles. In 2014 TLG again released a number of Arctic sets in the City theme (formerly known as Town). Some of these sets are actually pretty big, containing over 700 parts. Looking back in history it seems that Arctic sets may have found their origin in the Technic theme. Although these sets were white instead of orange, they are unmistakenly Arctic. The 1986 Technic Arctic Sets contained the infamous Technic Figures. Unfortunately the 2015 Arctic Truck doesn't contain any Technic Figures, but nonetheless it's great to see a new Arctic vehicle in the Technic line, not counting several snow scooters. Let's see if the new Arctic Truck lives up to the expectations. Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions. SET INFORMATION Number: 42038 Title: Arctic Truck Theme: Technic Released: 2015 Part Count: 1219 Box Weight: 2110 gr Box Dimensions: 47,8 cm x 28,0 cm x 7,2 cm Set Price (MSRP): € 79,99 / US$ 84.99 / £ 59.99 Price per Part: € 0,088 / US$ 0.093 / £ 0.066 Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX The box measures 47,8 cm x 28,0 cm x 7,2 cm and weighs around 1385 grams. The box actually feels pretty heavy which means it's filled properly. This seems to be a trend in the Technic theme. Slightly smaller boxes can save shelf space for retailers. THE FRONT The front of the box shows the main model and in the lower right corner there's a image with the dimension of the model. It's 40cm long and 18cm wide. THE BACK The upper part of the back of the box shows the functions of the main model. The lower left section shows the B-model, which looks very promising (more on that later). The lower right section shows the motorization options for the main model. The crane (partially) and the bed can be motorized. Besides motorization some LEDs can be added as headlights. THE SIDE On of the sides shows one of the newer smaller style panels. This is the first time it appears in orange. When you take a look at the sticker you can see that it's not symmetrical. Not sure why TLG "cut of" one of the sides of the stickers, since the position of the panel is very suitable for a continuous sticker. CONTENT OF THE BOX The box is pretty densely packed, which is better than semi-filled boxes. It feels like you actually bought something which matches the box size. The box contains: 2 Booklets 1 Sticker Sheet 8 Bags BOOKLETS & STICKER SHEET Unfortunately the instructions and sticker sheet haven't been packed with cardboard protection, which results in a curved sticker sheet and slightly bent instructions. In my case this wasn't so bad. At least no real damage. HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This set proves to be a great parts pack, especially when you might have missed some of the 2014 sets. BLACK LINK TREADS Usually the Link Treads come in Dark Blue Grey, but this sets includes 96 Black treads, which is great if you'd like to replace the DBG ones in your MOCs, or other official sets. UNDERCARRIAGE AND SUSPENSION Several parts are included to build the undercarriage driving the treads. Four Large Tread Sprockets and eight Small Tread Sprockets, which are used as return sprockets. Also included are four Steering Portal Hubs and four Steering Portal Axles for driving and steering the vehicle. Several frames, including two C-shaped Pivot Frames and two Steering Ball Joints to create an undercarriage much like the 4x4 Crawler. The set even includes two H-shaped Frames (a.k.a. Dog Bone Frames). NEW CHANGEOVER CATCH PARTS This year (2015) three new parts have been introduced to improve the changeover catch. More on these parts later. NEW PIN CONNECTOR Another new part for this year (2015) is the "1L Round Pin Connector", which looks like a pin connector, but acts more like a bush. NEW PINS Furthermore this sets includes quite a large number of three (relatively) new parts. 17 x Pin with Pin Hole, 14 x 3L Pin with 1L Axle and 11 x 3L Pin with 2L Axle, which have been introduced this year (2015). When the new 3L Pin with 1L Axle was introduced in 2014 it was only a matter of time before the new 3L Pin with 2L Axle would appear. Both new Pins are a great addition to the parts portfolio. PANELS Last but not least this sets contains a fair number of orange panels, including the 3x11 Panel in Orange, which is the first time we've seen this part. PART LIST Below is the entire part list for the 913 parts. As usual this part list can be found at the end of the second booklet. THE BUILD The build immediately starts with some of the new parts, used to build the compact gearbox in the center of the model. Notice the two 20 Tooth Bevel Gears. One would have been enough to drive the 12 Tooth Bevel Gear, so the second seems to be useless. TLG probably used it in the A-model, because they needed it in the B-model, which you can see later. The front and rear suspension are almost identical. The front side also has the 13L Gear Rack, used for steering. The picture below shows the steering rack on the front suspension in more detail. At this point you have more or less finished the chassis. The gearbox is in place and the majority of the functions has internally been connected to the right gears. The small turntable shows where the crane will be attached later on. At the end of the first booklet, some of the bodywork has been attached to the chassis. The orange-black color scheme never fails to please me. Throw in some cool stickers for the extra effect and we have a winner. If you decide to motorize the model, using PF, the top of the cabin can be lifted to accomodate the battery box. The chassis uses lots of orange (and some black) panels to give the model it's distinctive look. The protective black bumber/railing is a nice addition which adds something to the exterior. The dumping bed at the rear can tilt to empty it's load. It's operated by a Mini LA. The Treads, which look very cool in Black, are driven by a Large Tread Sprocket and returned by two Small Tread Sprockets. The front and rear sections are identical. Building the undercarriages feels a bit repetitive, which is a problem for most tracked vehicles. FINISHED MODEL Adding the crane to the model finishes the build. Your model should look something like this. When you take a close look at the finished model, you realize this is something else. It's trully a unique vehicle. The color scheme is brilliant and the fact that it's an Arctic Truck is really neat. It's a welcome change for the Technic line to see a vehicle like this. This picture emphasizes that's it's a very cool vehicle. Imagine this beast plowing through the snow! As far as I know it's not based on a real life vehicle. If's probably a combination of several vehicles and some imagination. I can be totally wrong though. The rear of the vehicle shows the crane and drum, placed on the tipper bed. From this angle you can see some of the internals of the model, the gearbox behind the cabin for example. The crane can be partially motorized (rotation and base), while the boom is operated manually. What I like a lot is the protective railing around the vehicle. LEFT OVER PARTS Some leftover parts, nothing noteworthy. FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS This set has several functions/features: Steering Driving Suspension Crane Tipping bed STEERING As you can see in the image below the steering mechanism has quite a bit of negative caster (please correct me if I'm wrong), which causes the treads to rotate a bit upward/downward instead of only to the left and right. DRIVING You mention driving as a feature?! Yes I do and let me explain why. Normally I would ommit this as a feature and take driving for granted. However, driving this vehicle (on a flat surface) causes it to simply slide over the surface. For other arctic vehicles this would be a plus, but with a tracked vehicle it limits playability. This is one of the main drawbacks of these tread, they simple don't work properly on smooth surfaces. SUSPENSION The suspension is working properly. You do need to apply some pressure, but all things considered it's not too bad. CRANE The crane has four degrees of freedom: Base rotation Lower boom Upper boom Hook It does what it's supposed to do. Base rotation and lower boom can be motorized and switched using the gearbox, while the upper boom and hook are operated manually. TIPPING BED The tipping is operated via a Mini LA. CONCLUSION While the set does offer various functions and features, driving and steering is a serious issue. Therefor this set is more likely to be showcased than to be played with. B-MODEL Instructions for the B-model are of high quality. Looking at the image below, you will see what I mean. Here's the finished B-model, a tracked Jeep with a communcations device. This alternate model looks so good, it could easily have made it as a main model. One thing that does pop in mind; how would this look with tires?! More on that later. When you are in the artcic region it's imperative to have proper communication channels. Since there's no internet backbone, you will need a big antenna of some sort. This B-model actually features a small trailer wagon with a transmitter/receiver. Here's more detailed image of the B-model, without trailer wagon. I would buy this model in a heartbeat if it were a main model. Simply gorgeous. The side view doesn't give away that this in alternate model. The stickers also work really well in this model. And again, nothing to complain here. The model even has a small crane at the rear, operated by the Mini LA. Here you can see the arctic fleet, comprised of both the A-model and B-model. I bet these two can get some work done!! A bit of a messy picture, but this should give you an impression of the size of both models. LEFTOVER PARTS Not too many parts left, which is obviously a good thing. ALTERNATE MODEL WITH TUMBLER TIRES Just like me, you probably have been wondering how this model would look like with (Tumbler) tires. Well, here it is. As I imagined it does look great. Admittedly, these are not the type of tires we ought to use, but to be honest; I don't really care. Again, the negative caster results in quirky steering. The tires are a bit too big, so they hit the chassis when you compress the suspension. While this has absolutely nothing to do with an arctic vehicle, I really love this picture. SUMMARY We're almost at the end of my review, so what do I think of this set. Let's start with getting the Elephant out of the room; this set lacks proper driving and steering. Does that make it a bad set?! Definitely not! It's a great set, but it lacks some playability when it comes to moving the vehicle. The crane and tipper bed do work properly, so there's still some playability left. Does this set look cool? Definitely! I think it's one of the coolest (no pun intended) and most original models of recent years. The orange and black color scheme works great and the stickers are well designed. The B-model is of very high quality and some might even prefer it over the A-model. And if you are not interested in either of these models, this set provides you with a variety of great parts! All in all I think this is a great set! Maybe not to play with, but it scores high on all other criteria. PROS Original model Great color scheme Lots of interesting parts Great B-model CONS Steering and driving don't work too well Repetitive build of undercarriages (minor con) SCORE Below are my scores based on different categories. 8 DESIGN Original and good looking model. 7 BUILDING EXPERIENCE Fun to build, albeit a bit repetitive. 8 FEATURES Packs quite a few features. 7 PLAYABILITY Some features work, some don't. 9 PARTS Comes with interesting parts. 9 VALUE FOR MONEY Two great model in a single set. 8 COOL! As a bonus, here's picture of the main model with Tumbler Tires. Why? Because we can!	positive
Very timely review Jim. My wife has just surprised me by giving me this set a few days ago and I have just built the A model two days ago and B model yesterday. I agree with all that you wrote above. I don't have Tumbler tires but I have 9398 tires. Driving is smooth but steering + suspension will be bad as you said due to negative caster and tires hitting the chassis. Anyway, tonight I will destroy the B model and rebuilt this http://www.busterhau...8-c-model.html.	positive
The set is a looker, you've got to admit it, but what it gives in looks does not make up for what it lacks in functions. I really wanted this set, badly even, when I restarted my adventure with Technic about a month ago. Than I learned more and more about what a good model can do, mostly thanks to this forum and YT. Right now I'm a bit disappointed with the Arctic Truck - smaller sets offer more functions and teach you much more. Jim it was a great review nevertheless Edited by pgplay, 14 December 2015 - 11:22 AM.	negative
Great review. I bought this model several weeks ago and the box has sat on my shelf, so I think after this I will be digging it out for Christmas and I expect my son will have a lot of fun with it when it's built.

Until I saw photos of this set I wasn't convinced I wanted it. Now after seeing all the combinations (A+B and tumbler tires!) I am definitely buying two copies. I need orange parts and black treads anyway. The only problem I have with this is that it's going to encourage me to buy many copies of the drag racer just to get enough wheels to play with.	positive

Nequmodiva, on 14 December 2015 - 09:48 PM, said: You switched the sides for the panel with the unsymmetrical sticker. Otherwise you would see that the cut off part is where there's a beam in front of the panel. That's probably done because the beam could possibly damage the sticker, either while building or while placed against it for a long time. Or it's simply omitted because it wouldn't be (completely) visible This is probably the only reason (for TLG choosing to provide an asymmetrical sticker), but looking at the sticker sheet, I also believe they simply didn't have the space on the sheet for a symmetrical solution. A symmetrically stickered panel could have more (re)uses for the MOC'ers. On Lego's own B-model, they handily camouflage it with the exhausts	neutral
Thank you Jim, nice Review It´s a great set: A lot unique parts and not just pins, axles and beams. I bough it to bring me back to Lego from my DA (10 years)... PS. Soon I will post an alternative model	positive

REVIEW - 42001 - MINI OFF-ROADER INTRODUCTION Technic Mini models are sometimes regarded as models not worth buying. I don't agree with this opinion. Whether it's a special part or innovative building technique, almost every Mini model has something that makes the set worthwhile. This time I will be reviewing the 42001 Mini Off-Roader. This model is not a smaller version of an existing model, so there's no real comparison with a bigger brother, or sister if you will. Nor does the model resemble a real life brand or vehicle, so it is what it is, a Mini Off-Roader. Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions. SET INFORMATION Number: 42001 Title: Mini Off-Roader Theme: Technic Released: 2013 Part Count: 100 Box Weight: 165 gr Box Dimensions: 15,5 x 14,0 x 4,2 cm Set Price (MSRP): 9.99 EUR DE / 7.99 GBP / 12.99 USD Price per Part: DE 0.100 EUR / UK 0.080 GBP / USA 0.130 USD Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX The box measures 15,5 x 14,0 x 4,2 cm which is obviously not very big. The weight of the box is approximately 165 grams. FRONTSIDE The front of the box shows a though four wheel drive off-roader challenging a fierce rocky mountain trail...now does it?! What the box actually shows is Mini Off-Roader challenging a small foam rock formation, much like rocks used in Star Trek The Original Series, yet smaller The box also states that this model is for the age of 7 till 14. More importantly, the 2-models in-1 logo is clearly visible, which means this set can be used to build two different models. BACKSIDE The backside shows a picture of the alternate model and a smaller version of the original model. The conversion arrow and the 2-in-1 are printed to clarify that the main model can be converted into a secondary model. SIDES One of the sides shows the 2-in-1 logo and a picture of the main model. Another side shows a picture of one of the wheels in actual size and again, a picture of the main model. CONTENTS OF THE BOX The box contains: 2 Booklets 2 Bags 4 Tires BOOKLETS This set contains two booklets which is not very common for a set this size. Both models share the same chassis, which is why the build has been divided over two booklets, one for the chassis (8 pages with 10 steps) and one for the bodywork (34 pages with 23 steps for the main model and 20 steps for the alternate model). BAGS The box contains only 2 bags which is to be expected from a set consisting of 100 parts. One of the bags is filled with liftarms, panels, rims and two elastic bands. The other bags contains all the other parts, like pins, axles, connectors, etc. Opening the bags results in the following collection of parts, with the exception of the tires. No abundant number parts that will add real value to your collection. Nevertheless, there are some interesting orange parts and elastic bands. TIRES The tires are provided seperately (i.e. not contained in the bags). From the picture you can see that these tires have a front and a back side, so you should pay attention when fitting them to the rims, which have two different sides as well. HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This section describes the unique and/or highlighted parts. VERY SMALL SMOOTH TECHNIC PANEL (#21 AND #22) These two small Technic were new at the time of release and this set was only one of two sets containing them in orange. The other set is the 42007 - Moto Cross Bike. At the moment of writing there's a third set containing these parts, the Black Champion Racer. Side A Side B SMALL RUBBER BAND I was under the impression that these White Rubber Bands weren't that common, but it seems that these bands are as common as dirt. But hey, you can't have enough rubber bands! THIN LIFTARM 1x5 WITH AXLE HOLES Like the panels, these Liftarms were also new at the time of release. Looking at the the frequent usage in other sets, this part has proven to be a most useful mammal. THIN LIFTARM 1x3 Not a very rare piece per se, but if you are not into Bionicle, this liftarm part can be hard to find. Your other option would be to buy the 9390 - Mini Tow Truck, or the 8305 - Dual Bikes from a while ago (2000). LONG PIN WITH CENTER PIN HOLE This relatively new kid on the block is currently used in many Technic and non-Technic sets and has well proven it's worth. AXLE PIN CONNECTOR HUB WITH 2 AXLES Like the previous part this newish part is also quite helpful in certain situations. PART LIST Here's the complete list for all 100 parts. BUILDING EXPERIENCE The build starts with the chassis of the Off-Roader. After connecting some liftarms two elastic bands, one on each side, are attached to the towball pins. This is all there is to the suspension, plain and simple. The two elastic bands contract the L-shaped liftarms, which results in the long ends swiveling downwards. The video below demonstrates the suspension. The simplicity doesn't do it justice, because it works like a charm. The suspension is very smooth with the right amount of stretch and resistance. This great working suspension adds a lot of value to this set. To quote John Hurt in the movie Contact: "Why build one when you can have two at twice the price?". I have purchased two sets so we can simultaneously see both models and make a proper comparison. Below you can see two identical chassis which will be used for both versions of the build. At this stage we have arrived at the end of the first booklet, which only took about ten minutes. Not surprising, since the first booklet only has 10 building steps. Progressing to the second booklet, you need to choose between building the main and alternative model. That's a choice I don't need to make for this review, so let's start with the main model. MAIN MODEL When building the bodywork there's a rather peculiar building technique, which you wouldn't expect in an official LEGO set. The Axle and Pin Connector Hub with 2 Axles only protrudes halfway into the Double Bent Liftarm. The Thin 1x4 Liftarm which is added in one of the following steps makes sure the hubs stay perfectly in place, but I was still surprised to see this technique. The finished bodywork for the main model looks like....uhh...well.....I don't know exactly. It doesn't bear any resemblance to a real life model, which makes it hard to judge. One thing's for sure; it's not the best looking Technic Mini Model. The bodywork can be attached to the chassis by using a 7L axle and two bushes, one on each side of the chassis. ALTERNATE MODEL Unfortunately the alternate model doesn't look much better than the main model. It's even a stud less wide, while you would like to see slightly more body, matching the size of the tires and chassis. Attached to the chassis the body is even more out of proportion. It's not really ugly and the color scheme is great (obviously this goes for the main model as well), but the body simply doesn't match the chassis. I can only imagine that this model is supposed to have a chibi look, much like the Microfighter Star Wars models. COMPARISON The following section shows a selection of images from different angles to compare the main and secondary model. The main model has a bit more volume, while the alternate model has a more sporty look. FRONT VIEW The main model has headlights which are attached at a higher point, while the alternate model has headlights which are placed more closely next to each other. REAR VIEW A slightly different setup in both models, where the main model again has higher placed rear lights. SIDE VIEW The side view shows that the panels are used differently in both models. The main models uses them as doors, while the alternate model uses them as engine cover (bonnet). TOP VIEW The top view reveals that the main model might have room for a minifig PARTS LEFT The left image shows the parts which are left after building the main model, while the second image shows the parts left after building the alternate model. As you can see, the main model uses slightly more parts than the alternate model. FEATURES Besides the awesome suspension, which we already have discussed, there aren't a lot of features in this set. There's actually a single feature, which is only present in the main model....opening doors! Wow, impressive! Well, maybe we can't expect too much functionality in such a small model. SUMMARY The Off-Roader is a fun model which is fairly easy to build. The suspension is simple, yet very effective. The model could do better in the design department, but the suspension offers great playability and that is what this set is all about. The orange parts are not very common so they are an added bonus. All things considered this set is definitely worth the few bucks you need to spend on it. PROS Great suspension Fun to play with Some (semi) rare orange parts Great color scheme CONS No resemblence to an actual off-roader Not the best looking model SCORE Below are my scores based on different categories. 6 DESIGN Not the best looking Technic model. 7 BUILDING EXPERIENCE The suspension makes it fun to build. 7 FEATURES The suspension makes up for the lack of functionality. 8 PLAYABILITY The model has Car-Swooshability. 7 PARTS Some interesting orange parts. 8 VALUE FOR MONEY Great present for the younger builders. 7,1 ELASTIC Hope you enjoyed it! Thanks for reading and please rate this set at the top of this topic!	positive
Once again, excellent review Jim! Than you for not skipping this small but pretty great set. I also got two of this and I have to say, I really admire the nifty suspension. Building a third bodywork for the same suspension system is still on my backlog.	positive

When I built it I was very surprised how cool suspension it has and how much playability it features. I've also tried to build some alternative model out of it but without success.

Here is the review...for Broadside's Brig 6259! A set from 1991, with a handsome count of 64 pieces, 3 figures, and a sale price of $8.75! The building(and parrot): We'll start off with the front. It looks like a good solid building to hold those scurvy dogs! We yonder over to the left side: And see a nice open back: And yonder to the plain right side: Back to the left, we find the corner, with a nice area to rest your tired soldiers! We see the platform in the corner, a lovely place for soldiers to stand on! It's a bit...skimpy, so watch your step! The middle is blocked by some stones, assuring security! But still open enough to stand in! The jail is cramped, and fits only TWO people, but we only need one prisoner in this set :-) ! Moving up is the watch tower, a place for your soldier stand and stand watch or for silly parots to sit on! Here's the front middle part, again those stones blocking the way! Figures and Accesories: We have a delightful number of a soldier, a sailor, and a scurvy pirate! A lovely parot! And a generous assortment of weapons! That concludes our review. Overall: It's a fantastic little set, and great for army and supplies and bricks gathering! I can't find any faults with this set, it's just the neatest little thing you've seen in a port *wub* Highly recomended *y* . And to end our review: A comic!	positive
A fine little set with 64 pieces and 3 figures for under $10. May have seemed a bit steep in 1991, but I wouldn't know, I'd passed into my dark ages already, so alas, I haven't a copy of this set. Looking at the parts list, I could build one out of my current inventory though. Issued today for $10, I'd buy no less than 14 of them, even though it does lack the obligatory rowboat for the pirate to make his escape in. Very nice review and comic, thanks for doing them! *y* Edited by imperialshadows, 20 October 2007 - 06:10 AM.	positive

Mister Phes, on Oct 20 2007, 12:38 AM, said: You've done a good job of this review Mr ImperialScouts! But two things. 1) Background far too bright and the set is far too dark, easily rectified with Brightness & Contrast adjustment. 2) No poll to rate the set out of 5. Nonetheless this should be frontpaged on Classic-Pirates.com! Alas, I cannot make polls in the pirate forum, so a generous moderator/admin would be so kind to add one. Nonetheless, the picture was fixed, and appears to be alright. But I'm glad that the review is enjoyed!	neutral
I'm not generous but I'll do it anyway X-D Now I need to write an artistic statement and then I can write my own review for Broadside's Brig!	neutral

The Poll doesn't allow you to select 2 from 1-5. It instead says 1, 3, 3, 4, 5. But besides that, your review I give it a 5 because 1) shows the set in all angles 2) shows the characters 3) comment on the little creature comforts of the set 4) added a comic (playability) 5) showed true enthusiasm *y* *wub*	neutral
The poll is for the set, not the review :-D . But thank you anyway! And it appears Mister Phes made the mistake :-P !	neutral
i'd give a 2, but you put 3 two times. Is a nice set but is not really cool. Is a worse version of Lagoon lock up	negative
A nice little set. Silly parrots ON!	positive
For the price it really looks like a nice set. Because of the lack of a cannon, I give it a 4. Cool comic IS! *y* Captain Roger, on Oct 20 2007, 10:59 AM, said: i'd give a 2, but you put 3 two times. Thanks for the pointer! Changed, and I added your vote.	positive

It's mine *wub*! Just got my Luke today from TRU in in Merrilville, IN... ;-)! So here's some pictures and thoughts: Still in the packing with the box Pieces out in the fresh air Put together, ready for some serious Vader vacking >:-)! If you this close you're so dead!! It's yet another lovely maquette *wub*! The only downside is that the LEGO SW sign doesn't even resemble (ok, I've exagurating a bit :'-)) the ones from the other maquettes! Check out this one from the Blackhole Trooper compared with the Luke one: The Luke one is has a massproduced look over it with just a printing |-/ , the other has depth & a painting on it.

Not my thing, but a very nice review, thanks for sharing it! I was seriously considering this one when it was originally announced as a 6212 copack item at a particularly good price and then everything changed.

During the annual Thanksgiving Road Trip to the relatives, I stopped by the TRU in Portland, OR. Lo and behold, the new Mars Mission sets! Obviously, I bought them. ;-) The box: Not much to say. Standard box art for MM sets, nothing new. The parts: Some good parts here. Even if you don't like the set (Which I highly doubt after I've had my say :-P ), it's a decent parts pack. I noticed that some old parts have been renewed. I know the wheel has been used in the '07 sets, but the cockpit and hitch I haven't seen in a while. The VLDSS (Very large DSS). Grr. New part. At least, I think it is. Someone slap me if it isn't. *wacko* The figs. I know I've seen that head before, but I have no idea where. Does anyone know? I was hoping that the aliens would have new arms, at least. I was sadly mistaken... On the upside, I finally discovered that they glow in the dark. :-$ The alien has a jetpack. If that's not the silliest thing I've ever seen, I don't know what is. The build. Simple build. A block. So easy a caveman cou- oh, never mind. Geico's used that one enough. Then, we have this jobber right here. Not sure what it is, but it looks like some crystal scanning device. It's starting to look pretty nice. It almost looks practical. The cockpit is suffering from a bad dose of over-stickering. On the upside, we have a new piece there to hold the cockpit on. Part 1 complete. It has a nice little radio antenna, which is ruined by the use of a random missile that looks like it's going to shoot the antenna before it shoots the alien. Still, I never say no to a good missile I can use for something else. The trailer: Fairly simple, but it works. It features stabilizing arms, a handheld saw, and an extremely random mini-bot who's purpose escapes me. The Whole Meal Deal- Erm, general pics. Overall, I thought this was a good set. In fact, it reminds me of this:	positive

Cool review, thanks!! :-D I personally think the minirobot is awesome, and (dare I say) cute! This was described on Amazon to be a mobile lab, I'm not seeing that. I do however see a crystal hauling vehicle. *sweet* Pretty cool, not as bad as previous sets. ~Peace	positive

A wonderful set and, perhaps, as close to Classic Space as possible. *y* Also there?s a great amount of very useful and interesting parts too like these round 'stabilizer' parts with clip.... :'-) There?s a complete different feeling with this new sets compared to the first MM ones.... 8-| Beside the a little more realistic aspects of it with the more enclosed cockpit (nearly with some controls.... ;-) ) it?s the overall more solid feeling I guess.... The other sets look pretty neat and fashionable at the surface, but their internal structure is much more hollow and useless with some studless technic beams and such stuff.... very shining, but hard and boring to MOD, just aimed for maximal cool looking box art and the rest went down for saving costs.... (beside that already pretty good 7692 Dropship that is). The only thing I don?t get with that is why the minirobot?s a one-armed one.... ach, Pirates on Mars I suppose.... X-D	positive
that head might have been from rock raiders. lovely set, and a good review. jifel	positive
Tks for the great review MM ;-) Its always appreciated to have reviews of new set. Having said that I really don't see the point of that set and its such money and time wasted IMO. I don't like that theme apart the dropship and 6wheeler and that tiny vehicle doesn't do the trick for me. I see it as a really cheap excuse to try and please Classic Space fan with that horrendous MM graphics and what amazes me is that you guys loke that :-D Money saved On !! *yoda*	negative

Thanks for posting the picture of this new MM set. When I first saw the Mars Mission sets I was a little apprehensive about the design and the aliens (They could have at least make movable arms :(), but anyways when I bought the small fighter I was totally hook. My fave set from the line is the mech.	positive
During the annual Thanksgiving Road Trip to the relatives, I stopped by the TRU in Portland, OR. Lo and behold, the new Mars Mission sets! Predictably, I bought them. I present to you: the MX-41 Switch Fighter! Man, what a long name. The box: Standard MM. On the front, it shows the Fighter in flight mode, and a yellow note telling you that it transforms. The back shows three pictures showing it happen. The parts: Once I open the box, the first thing that comes out is a bent and rolled up instruction booklet, and I was forced to put it under a stack of beer books for an hour. Then, there's the DSS. Yes, two of the stickers do feature a cobra. I wonder why, because this set's decal should be a beatle. X-D Decent parts, nothing too special. Then, I noticed this little part. It's used for the flick-missiles, but I have no idea what else it would be used for. :-/ The Build: The alien ship: When I looked at the box art for this set, I was releived to see that the aliens don't have another curved-forward wing ship. Instead, they have this little beauty, which appears to be the Alien Mini Cooper- small and hot. *wub* Anyway, partially completed. Even if you don't like the set, it has some nice green flame peices, which work nicely for space laser swords. Fully completed. The only annoying bit about it is that the crystal-holding thing in front wobbles all over the place. The alien fits into it by way of impalement. It must hurt getting in and out. Switch fighter (cockpit): The set makes good use of the Alpha Team cockpit. For controls, it has a meagre handlebar that the astronaught can't even reach. The rear "shell" of the fighter starts out around the alien containment chamber. It's a bit odd that the containment chamber has an alien sticker, because the instruction booklet lists it as holding crystals. The crystal canister is held back by a technic pin. This is, without a doubt, the ugliest color arrangment EVER. Warning: Mass stickers. :-X The cockpit fits into grooves in the "shell". Then it clicks into place in a 1x1 brick with a horizontal clip. The wing "mechanism": The wing. For some reason, the body of the "mechanism" has a blue brick. *wacko* The wing and "mechanism" connect to prevent the fighter doing a nosedive while in tank mode. The wing "mechanism" completed: The underside: The body and wing connect by way of a miscolored red brick. I have no idea why it's red- black would bave been much, much better. Completed. Tank mode: All in all, this looks pretty neat. The wheel base is pretty short, but it's not bad. Transform! The set transforms neatly, if ungainly. Without "Anti-grav" support, it would fall forward on it's nose each time it transformed. Jet mode. It's all right, but it could be a bit better. The "shell" keeps slipping back forward to the "tank mode" because there's nothing to stop it sliding. Spare parts: Overall: I thought this set was great. It could do with some fixing, such as the mismatched colors, but it should be a definate buy for MM fans. Brickshelf Gallery (When available)	positive
*wub* Thanks for another great review. *sweet* I am also glad that it is a very different alien fighter design as I already have three varients of the old type! The fighter transforms better than I thought it would; I was expecting just the wings. I should be buying this set as well... Mr. Mandalorian, on Nov 26 2007, 03:45 PM, said: Without "Anti-grav" support, it would fall forward on it's nose each time it transformed. Well, since anti-grav doesn't exist, and will never exist, there has to be another option! Looking at it in tank mode it does have a vague aerofoil shape so I think it should be able to work as a lifting body. All it needs to do then is move fast enough to start taking off and then it can extend the wings... 8-|	neutral

Very cool review, Mr. Mandalorian! This isn't a bad set, the alien craft is very sleek (if only they'd gone with the old alien body in trans-green...) and the transforming is alright. The tank mode looks sweet. *sweet* ~Peace	positive
after seeing this set review it change my mind about this set. By the way thanks for the great review.	neutral
Thanks for that very good review, Mr. Mandalorian! *y* I think that this is a plain beautiful set, oh how I wish that TLC would?ve taken that direction from the beginning.... :'-) The design is much more practicable, with fewer non-system parts and technic beams with(!) studs.... this makes everything much more easier to MOD and a lot more useful, at least IMO. *y* So it?s for sure not very hard to make the (wonderful enclosed) cockpit one brick higher, and even that little Alien Ship looks decent and nice.... X-O And the fighter looks sleek and elegant too, in both modes! That?s just very cool, compliments, TLC. Now all we need?re aliens with moving arms and here we go, Classic Space on forever! X-D	positive
Thanks for a very thorough review. I might think about getting this. I really like the mini alien fighter, and the transformation idea is always a welcome one. Both modes look pretty good, despite the some of the odd coloured bricks (which I'd MOD out). You know what it reminds me of? Some of the futuristic designs in the Gerry Anderson series.	positive
friggin sweet, Thank you mr mandy for the reveiw of this sweet ship! *y* *wub*	positive
Thanks, guys! Lasse D, on Nov 26 2007, 08:54 AM, said: Wow. This is actually quite a neat set! It is definitively my favorite in the line after the big drilling unit! \begin{geek} I'm not sure it would nose dive when transforming from tank mode. I guess it would pick up speed and transform quickly since it doesn't seem to have any downwards pointing thrusters. \end{geek} I don't think that tank is very fast... Maybe if it drove off of a crater....

I guess it would pick up speed and transform quickly since it doesn't seem to have any downwards pointing thrusters. The one thing you'd have to make sure of, though, is that it was fairly light and the wheel base had a fairly large surface area (actually, that's two things), so as to make sure it didn't dig into the soil. If that happened, transformation would be harder as the wheels would dig into the ground and drag through the soil. Then it'd nose dive.	neutral
Great review Mr Mandalorian! *y* I'm not a fan of MM and don't like this set much, but it has some neat features. But the only way I can see it transforming is by racing off a cliff and swinging its wings out *wacko* To the Brickmobile! >:-)	negative
john cleese, on Nov 25 2007, 10:56 PM, said: cool review. I'm actually liking that new missile part as it seems to combine a bar with a pin. But it's a real eyesore if you ask me. A needed solution to those blasted flick missles from falling out while swooshing. *sweet* Wonder if the range might have an issue seeing it's held in there but who knows, maybe they now "pop" out with a greater velocity than a mere finger flick? I had resorted to technic 1/2 bushings (smooth) to lock in the missile's technic axle (with stud).	positive

You mean the ungainly way in which the wheels have to turn in order to change from tank mode? I think you are right as well. On the other hand. If it has anti-grav, then it doesn't really make sense to have wheels as well. I mean. If the power goes, then the wheels can't turn anyways!	negative

Great review Hinckley! I know you've been busy, so thank you so much for getting this up! :-D The spine construction is clever, the minirobot's cool, this is a fantastic set! ~Peace	positive
Sweeeet. *wub* It's nice to finally see a set that's not bipedal or (?) Tripedal. Quote Exo-Force is an anomaly in my LEGO interests. I don't know why I like it so much or why I keep buying it but I do. That would be a problem, wouldn't it? :-P Quote The cockpit itself is constructed very well but the canopy seems like an afterthought, closing on to the robot's head and leaving his back and sides completely exposed. I dunno. At least it has a canopy, unlike past sets..	positive
Thanks for this fantastic review Hinckley, I can't wait to see the comic! :'-) I REALLY love this mech as I am a fan of non-bipedal mechs (though I am terrible at making them), the purple is great and I can't wait to see what MOCers will use those awesome new spike peices for! 3 robots in one mech is a really good deal too, and that spider droid just adds so much more to the set. And thanks for taking the time to do this! *sweet* Not to sound like a smartypants though, but the grill peice in purple is not the first time this has happened, two were included in the 06 Joker Helicopter ;-) Thanks again! To the Brickmobile! >:-)	positive
Awesome Reveiw thanks for the pics!! Did the instructions come with a comic?	positive
Great review as always, Hinckley. Frankly I'm in love with this thing. So much so, in fact, that I've been calling it 'Shadow Panther' for weeks, but never mind... Anyway, why do I like it? Well, purple is such a fantastic Lego colour- it's sparingly used, which makes it interesting, and it simply looks great. Those jetpack/backpack things the robots are wearing, and if they are jetpacks, as the back of the box suggests, then the use of chaisaws is quite nifty and innovative. The minibot is cool, and certainly an interesting gimmick. Sure, they don't look quite as good in some of the other sets, but here it looks great. The overall structure and design are cool too. It's always nice to see an 'irregular' mech, and this is no exception. It's especially cool whee the spines are concerned. Plus, on top of all that, it's got a nice selection of parts, including some lovely new ones, and the inlaid box is interesting. Well worth getting, I think.	positive
Another fantastic review, Hinckley. I really like this set, I wasn't to keen on it when I first saw the pictures bit having seen the review, I am starting to like it. It seems quite sturdy, and it makes a change from the usual 2 legged mechs. As well as that purple is welcome anywhere, I have such a shortage of that colour! I like the rusty orange colour of the robots, and their back/jet packs are quite cool, and the mini robot looks sweet.	positive

From the LEGO Store in Chicago, if I recall his post properly! My goodness Hink, you're going to pull an all-nighter for reviews at this rate! Oh well, it's kinda worth it, right? :-P	neutral
Another great review, Hink! Looks like a great set. Quote The cockpit isn't sealed and is actually aggravatingly unrealistic as it leaves the drivers chest vulnerable to enemy fire. Actually the cockpit lacks any controls as seen here where it looks like Keiken is simply pounding a counter demanding food. :-D "Gimme food! Or else my friend up there willl shoot your punk- @$$ into mars!" Well, I guess that explains why there are no robot snipers in EF. If there were, well.... Wouldn't be much of a story, would there?

this designers were on a roll with this one until it came to the flying unit. It looks like a shambles, epecially the guns looking rather simplistic. Although they used something similar to the light and sound globe peice, which is kind of neat. I dont think I'll be buying this but your review almost talked me into it.	neutral
Sinner, on Nov 28 2007, 12:53 AM, said: How well do the tracks work? The last tank was too light and it didn't roll well at all. :-/ It's similar in weight but I didn't have to press down so hard to get the treads to move, barely at all, really. I think the Mobile Defense Tank, although a better overall design, suffered from the odd angle of the treads and that was mostly why the treads didn't turn well. Plus, what was with those weird exhaust pipes?? Anyway, they are both cool tanks although I like the Mobile Defense Tank better... :-)	neutral
Thank you for the glimps at the new set Hinckley *y* . I saw this set today at my local TRU store. The new slope 1x2 pieces look very *sweet* . I definitly see great potential for these pieces on locomotives. I hope these are going to be bountiful in the 2008 lines. Model On!!	positive
Fantastic! Great review, thanks a bunch for all the pics, they've shown me how (in my opinion) bad this set is. :-P I just expected it to be more bricky rather than technicy. Oh well, I wasn't planning on buying it anyway. X-D I noticed you spelt mini-figs mini-fgis in the first paragraph, in case you wanted to know. X-D So again, thanks, and I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of them, and the comics! ~Peace	negative
Hinckley, on Nov 28 2007, 06:48 AM, said: Cool! But my reviews are not meant to sway anyone. They should just inform people further as if they want to buy it or not. I am not necessarily for encouraging anyone to buy every set I review. :-D But I'm glad you liked it. Thank you. oh I know but without the info I definately wouldnt buy it, now I'm considering it.

Thanks for this great review Hinckley! :'-) I know you're loving this attention! X-D :-P I actually like this set, and like it a lot more now that I've seen this review.

Thanks for that good review, Hinckley. *y* A really interesting set and a turning point for LEGO. Minirobots instead of shooting crap, pretty cool. I hope the kids?ll like it too. For the design, I love that asymmetrical look of the front part and the sleek guns of the flyer. It?s smart that the gatling gun moves along with the tank, too. The set idea with two vehicles in one?s not new, but very play- able and the treads/big wheel design?s cool. I don?t like the use of studless technic beams, but well, they do their job I guess. And Keiken?s cockpit should be easy to improve....	positive

Here is my review of the set 6265 Sabre Island! Overview: Sabre Island was release in 1990 an it contained 92 pieces and its retail price was $15.50. It comes with 3 Imperial Blue coats, and a nice outpost for them. The pictures + full review: Anyway, you can see here a picture of the box, the model shown on the box differs from the actual model slightly. ...And the back of the box, which shows some nice alternative models from the pieces provided. A close up of two or three of the alternative models. And now for the minifigs. I prefer the Red coats over the Blue coats but these minifigs are nice, and for the number of pieces one gets a fair amount of them. The set itself makes a nice small outpost, it comes complete with a palm tree, a cannon (with ammo) on a turntable, a small tower a nice large Imperial flag and a little red row boat! Here is a shot from ground level showing the cannon and Blue coat (patrolling the out post!) The rowing boat was a nice touch, and it comes with a small flag too. "No Pirates will avoid the wrath of myself and my mighty Island!" The top of the tower is rather plain and simple which in some ways is good, as it keeps the whole set detailed yet not crowded, but I feel a little something should of been added to the top though. The back is lacking any type of walls, so one can play with the minifigs inside, yet their are also no stairs or any other ways for the Blue Coats to climb up their tower either! The rag tag pirates attack Sabre Island! But never fear, The Lord Of Pies is here! Me throwing a pie at Captain Ironhook from another angle. Overall I think this is a very good, if somewhat simple set, and makes a great cheap Imperial set! Comments, thoughts and Opinions are welcome! (And sorry about the darkness in some photos, I have not had time to take photographs when it is till light recently, for when I return home it is dark |-/ ) Edit: Fixed, Thank you!

Bonaparte, on Dec 8 2007, 09:40 PM, said: I gave this one a 5. *snip* It can be used as a small independent base or in combination with one of the bigger sets (Eldorado or Trading posts) as a lookup or outer defense.*snip* I hope that when I got Eldorado Fortress for Christmas (The one I got for ?25) I can somehow combine the two to make a single larger base.

LOL! Those Star Wars heiroglyphics are awesome! Were those in the movie? Or is this just a joke by the Lego designers? That would be the first time TLC showed any kind of reference humor! The rest of the set is great too, even the skeleton and the stickers. YES, that's right, I actually like those things.

My 2nd review (what a veteran) ... again, found this set via a shop assistant, in my local TRU (Portsmouth, UK) this evening. Comes in at ?44.99, which, is pretty steep, but, you get quite a bit for your money. Front of the Box : Back of the Box : Back of the Box Closeup : Contents : It was a nice surprise to get numbered bags ... not had a large set with numbered bags for quite a while, at least in none of the sets I've bought recently! Didn't take a close up of the stickers, but I was quite disappointed that the curved pieces had stickers ... if they could print the ATT curved pieces, why not these? Minifigs : Oh ... and there's a nice backprint on the Pilot figure : Now, the build was pretty good ... you build the plane first (after the minifigures). Quite an interesting build in a way, becayse for a while you think the back is the front ... and then you realise, heh! Now ... I've not seen the film in a while, but I don't recall a guy flying a plane with a fishing rod ... don't flame me if this is what happens, see earlier point regards not seeing the film in ages!! :-P After that, you build the temple in stages, starting with the entrance first, and then the holey floor section with the spears. These spears are just loosely placed into technic holed bricks. Quite easy to make em flick out but they can go anywhere! hehe Entrance : Holey Floor & Spears : These two parts are hinged and on an angle to each other and the gap makes for a handy bottomless pit, complete with pole for Indy to swing over with his whip. After that, you create the door and the ratchet mechanism to keep it raised. After that, you add the runners for the ball and the swinging knives trap. Swords Trap - Before : After : Finally, you build the statue that holds the efigy. Nice bit of construction here, especially the way that everything falls over once the efigy is removed. Do be careful when putting the curved bits on though ... it appears one of the edges on mine has slightly bent when putting it on ... nowt noticable though. Temple : Preparing to steal : Run!! You can see that the temple has toppled and debris has fallen all around ... And then, as he goes through the door, the door falls (he gets his hat) and then the rock ball starts a rolling! Ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun!! The stickers were a pain though ... there's no room for a border around the sticker here! Beware!! After all that is done, you join all the pieces together and it makes more a really good playset. Plenty of opportunity for recreating scenes here! Idol Closeup : Total Set : Spares : Yet more spare stickers??! (sorry, i've already put the spares in my box of bits!) Overall, 8 out of 10 ... lots of play value and a pretty nice build. Too many stickers though ... and defo poor arms for the skeletons! Edited by imperialshadows, 01 June 2008 - 12:18 PM.	positive

This set is so cool... and another must buy! :-$ I'm in trouble next year it seems... The figs are great! *wub* I think the plane is only OK; perhaps they should have made that in a separate set as it needed to be a certain size to fit the figs, but that meant that the tail is way too short. Here is a picture of the actual plane so you can see what I mean. (Notice the pilot is fishing... ;-) ) The temple is another story; I think Lego have done an incredible job with this, fitting in the key parts of this sequence without making an absurdly large model. Addtionally, there are many parts in this set that I haven't got so it shouldn't be too hard to justify. X-D Thanks for another great review. *sweet* I love the photo of Indy running with the idol and the boulder close behind. :-P Naith, on Dec 16 2007, 10:20 PM, said: lol is it just me or in the earlier concepts of this set we saw a native on the box? i wonder why they removed it :-( *wacko* I recall that too. :-/ EDIT: Yes there was one...

OMG I absolutely love how you reviewed this set, I think you are the only person I've ever seen on Eurobrick with such a thorough review. I read Eurobricks daily and this really raises the bar in terms of how a person does a review. Please do not resize your pics, they are perfect, crisp, large, thorough, and clear; it gives anyone who really wants info on the set just about everything they need to know about it. I had no idea they used that lil "thing" to have the cement mixer spin, cool idea ;-) . Nice set, but perfect perfect review. Thanks much! X-D	positive
Thanks for the review, this looks like a nice set to have multiple copies of... I think that you may have mistyped the setnumber, as I was expecting this cute car when I read the title (I wondered how you could see a cementmixer in this set...) :-P	neutral

Thanks for this review. Lots of minifigs is a plus, although half of them are junk jellies, but dang the base just doesn't seem impressive. It looks so cheap, like a skeleton. The tubes are just ridiculous. But hey, at least it comes with two cool spacecraft, that's nice.	positive
I agree, it does seem very scarce, but Ive taken apart the nerf launcher, made a new module with the tube the launcher used, and beefed up the base with some computers and other things. For 90 dollars I would pass, I agree. On sale it is lovely, though. And none the less ive been entertained for ages with them flyin through the tubes :-D	neutral
Should be here's the completed base and my Knee In Cordoroys (sp?) Great review.	positive
Thanks for the photos and review Brickmaster. I'm hoping to find this on sale as well... no luck so far. I love the white ship, and I think the base would be amusing, but ultimately hard to re-use. Incidentally, that long axel is common in recent technic sets, but I think it was orignally made for the hockey sets. :-D	positive

PSPguy, on Dec 27 2007, 03:08 AM, said: What? If your asking how they are but together you snap the window piece into the ho\lder. Errr.... no. As Brikbitz said on his site in the 7732 postal plane review... Quote You can see the traditional airplane window piece, but the bad news is they've changed the window pane. It's the new flat piece used in 4996 Beach House, it just doesn't work as well. Without the original bevelled edge it doesn't seal the window and there is small noticable gap around the edge. Not a major problem but it might get a bit draughty inside and certainly no high altitude flying. I was wondering if it is the old or new type.

So here it is, the long expected ;-) review of the town plan: I bought it at the Legostore Riem Arcaden last Saturday. I paid 149,99 EUR for 1981 pieces. This set is separated in 4 parts. 1: the Service/Gasstation 2: the cars. the petrol pump and the fountain 3: the cinema 4: the town hall The Service Station has a lot of really nice details, like tools for the car repair, or the table with the cashpoint and the foodstation (there?s a croissant, a banana and a apple in this set). One of my favourit parts is the trolley with some tools, you can see it at brickshelf. At the second part are only a few pieces and i needed not much time to built the 2 cars, the fountain and the petrol pump. There?s something at the truck i don?t understand.. maybe i did something wrong.. but.. the truck has no backlights.. *wacko* I like the petrol pump, that?s why i post a pic of it: The cinema is the highlight for me. It has also really nice details, like the popcorn table or the gumball or candy machine. The colours sheme is really nice, the front of the building with the big displays is a cool idea. Overall a really nice building. The town hall has also a really nice colour sheme, i love that dark green mixed with the white stairs. A lot of plants around and in the town hall. As you can see some figs who married there. Not more to say about this building. See the pics and enjoy it: Overall this set is a must have!! It was really fun to built it. This set reminds me of the Back to the Future movie with Michael J. Fox. The whole gallery is at Brickshelf, there you can find a few more pics. I hope you enjoyed this review. Regards Sandra	positive
Great review Sandra, thanks for taking the time. I love the theatre and the town hall, and the married couple is just a cute little extra *wub* This looks fantastic not only for the model, but for parts as well!	positive
Thank you for the great review Sandra *y* . I *wub* the detail that TLC added to this set. I would like to add that I think all the buildings look *sweet* . I really like how you compared the look to "Back to the Future". When I saw the first pics, I thought the same thing. The look of the set is definitly the 1950's. I am :-( to see the price though. I am sure this set will be $149.99 US too. GREAT REVIEW, Model On!!	positive
Thank you for the review Sandra! This set looks finally nice, better than my first view. I really need it, I've already planed to integrate it to my new layout... It will be hard to wait for it!	positive

Awesome!! I love the intierior of the Theater! Really good reveiw!	positive
I enjoyed seeing this review. Nice to get some different angles on the components. Sorry to disagree with anyone however, but this was not a great review. I appreciate the effort Sandra made but a great review would include more details such as what are stickers and what are printed pieces. A great review points out flaws or limitations as well as what works or is really neat. A great review would have analyzed the price per piece and compared that to other sets/themes. One might look at the recent reviews of the Indy sets or the new Spongebob sets as examples of really good reviews. The pictures are good but a great review, above all, should provide the reader with some new information, perhaps even answer questions posed in the pre-release discussion thread. I learned nothing new about the set from this review. That said, it was a good review for someone who had not seen the pre-release discussion and she did a good job of showing said person what they could expect in the set.	positive
I see the service station has a full arry of tools, oxy/fuel torch and other goodies. not a bad set, still very pricey :-/	positive

Wow, I'm surprised no one had done this already. First off, this is a truly lovely set that many people should own, even though it's SOLD OUT on the S@H :'-( . now lets start off with an overview. *Note*: I was missing a few of the pieces (the rabbit, the trike) when I toke the pics. The figs and a cat. The engine: I really love this thing. It's a beautiful 0-6-0 steam engine with a tender. This is probably the most detailed steam engine Lego has given us. I loved it so much, I made a non-holiday version for my town. The flat cars: I like these, but they seem a bit simple. Their cargo is good for Christmas or a birthday party. The passenger car: It resembles the green passenger car we got a while back, but I like the interior in this one a bit better. The caboose: a simple caboose like the one from 2001. the sad thing about it is thats there is no interior and it's hard to take the roof off. Overall: I like this set, but it is kind of hard to use during the non winter months. The price is kind of good, but with that price, it should have came with the motor. I give it a 9/10 Happy New Year! Edited by AgentRick57, 04 January 2008 - 12:00 AM.	positive

I was fortunate enough to get one along with the Hobby Train. They are the first trains I have ever owned (mainly by virtue of them having been half price). It's a fantastic selection of parts with the Holiday Train, as well as it really looking the part as a set. I'm happy not to get a motor; as I think the 9V setup would prove expensive, and the IR control system for the RC setup seems a bit poor. I got some "dead" track for with it to have just as a push train for now.	positive
Got one for 90 USD, one of the best trains ever..Funny as train, perfect for parts. What else to say. *y*	positive
Okie guys and gals, here s time for some droid exploration with my review of set 7670. As a general statement I have to say its really a neat set that is not that expensive for what it holds. 1) Box art Like always I will start with pics of the box art. BTW, notice anything guys ? No bloody crappy DSS. Yes, finally a set without stickers and that feels great :-D 2) The Mfs Nothing really spectacular there. The only novelty lies within the inclusion of the new Commander (yellow torso) BD. Apart from that, there are 2 BDs and unfortunately yet another SBD (I like those but I have a huge amount of them, and I would rather had something different). You have 3 short blasters and a couple of extra parts. 3) The Spider Droid I think it?s a pretty cool little buggar. It?s a rather simple yet classic construction I think. It has sweet parts such as the BD body in dark bley. It really has a spider feel unlike the previous Ep3 one. 4) The Hailfire Droid This baby represents the ?pi?ce de resistance? of this set. I truly love it !! Sure it?s a bit under scale but I don?t really mind that. Its conception is superb even if I totally dislike assembling those technic treads (especially 80 of those small things). The ellipse of the treads is well balanced and that trans disc is a brilliant idea. The great thing is those new flick fire missiles: they don?t fall unlike the other ones and they do look good on this baby. Also you can put the wheels together and the missiles to gain some shelf space (easy storage ON :-D ) In conclusion those druids re really sweet and are perfect target practice for the upcoming RGS hehe !! I hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any ;-) *yoda*	positive

My first (and second) idea was that 25 euro was a bit to much for this. :-) X-D whatever :-P Bloody typo I say. However, the upcomming Castle Advent calendar might include druids :-P I paid 30? for it ;-) (dang 1 cent more expensive as S@H :-D ) Trudop561, on Jan 5 2008, 11:21 PM, said: They released the battle droid commander in 2000 :-| Yes, another nice tone, meessa so happy !! First, you are very welcome for my review of a set present in your wishlist. Then the Commander you are talking about has a tan body with oreange markings only (check !!) and the commander here has a full YELLOW body like in the Spiderman set Doc Oc's hideout (4856) !! Therefore those 2 Commanders are 2 different MFs. *yoda*	neutral
Yeah finally *yoda* got his SW :-D I got 2 of them after X mas - they are really cool - especially the Spider Droid! 2 of them On! & Happy *yoda* On :-P Edited by aayla-secura, 05 January 2008 - 10:38 PM.	positive
Nice review, thanks. It still seems overpriced to me though. Also, the box shows the droid torsos that are used for "feet" on the Spider Droid as being light bley, yet they are clearly dark bley. *wacko* TK	negative

Great review, as we've come to expect from *yoda* *y* Nice to see that TLG is finding new and interesting ways to get around the "no minifig only" sets restrictions with Hasbro. Clearly, this is another army builder with a minimal vehicle as we're becoming accustomed to. Heck, even the diminutive Hailfire is technically a droid as well, thus making this all minifigs, from a certain point of view. Only negative: It is a bit overpriced. I'll have a better feel for that when I get one. Treads/links always drive up a price, so it might just be fair. The spiderdroid is a winner, even with the unusual parts assortment. I like it when LEGO thinks of different ways to use things, I think it promotes the same from us. I'm not sure what I think of the new battledroid commanders, but at least I can make extras easily if I need to, as I bought a bunch of yellow droid bodies off Bricklink once, thinking I might want to make some kind of new droid out of them. They were cheap at the time, now I expect the price to go up just because of this potential use. Between those and the grey ones, it's good to see more becoming available. Hopefully we'll see black and a few other colours produced for some nice customizing possibilities. All in all, a nice little set with a great army building potential, especially on a buy-one-get-one-half-off or better type of sale. Until then, I'll grab one or two and be glad to have them.	positive
I got this set for a few months [1 or 2].. And i agree that it is small.. But still.. It looks great on plates, clone troopers [Just for fun..] >:-)	positive
my hailfire droid is gonna be coming in the mail soon, as well as the battlepacks.	neutral
Ah I finally got the 2 City sets I really wanted !! I am so happy that Lego went postal on us :-P . Since they are rather small I shall do a mix review of these 2 sweet sweet sets. 1) Mail Van (7731) Like always I?ll start with shots of the box art and bloody DSS. Now here are the extras of that set: I really love the new torso of the postal worker. My huge grip lies on the mail box: that mail logo is a freaking sticker !! For that part I was so expecting a printed part. That is really really bad !! Apart from that the design is pretty cool. The van is quite simple but I think its pretty cute. I love the fact that the rear is a window. 2) Air Mail (7732) Like always I?ll start with shots of the box art and bloody DSS. The extras are OK: another great postal worker. You also have yet another red trolley with a package that is a bloody sticker yet again !! G TLC should have more printed parts !! That plane for me is a classic thing of beauty !! Really is consistent with the fantastic planes of the 80?s. That?s the kind of lanes TLC should produce instead of those huge Playmo planes. Actually I am happy that TLC released that one ? for once its not a bloody airline exclusive promo set !! Here are general pics. I love the engines of the plane: simple yet superb. Also the top hatch opens to insert mail and packages. The front control panel is a printed part !! I love the classic double train windows and here is a poc of the undeneath of the set. In conclusion I truly love these small sets: they are the perfect size (4 wide car yeay !!) and the colour pattern is amazing as well. I hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any ;-) *yoda*	positive
Great review Yoda. Thanks for sharing. I wasn't real fond of the postal truck at first. It's so different than those in the US. But after seeing your close-up images (esp. the back of the tuck), it looks really neat. I also like the mail box a lot. It looks good in red. Too bad for the stickers, but it's still nice. The plane reminds me a lot of the design used in the Jurassic Park set. As you've said, it's similar to 80s designs. I really like the brick-built design too. It's just real Lego - that's about all I can say. Very nice sets that are a must together. Thanks for the review.	positive
I haven't spotted these in the US yet. I'm looking forward to finding them. Overall, the 2008 line-up is a excellent and it's going to be difficult for me to decide which themes/sets to pursue. There's a lot to choose from.	positive
Very nice, cheers Yoda! I'll definitely be getting the post van, not sure about the plane though. Both are awesome, but I think I have enough planes... Can you tell me though, the wheels on the van, are they rubber or plastic? They look a bit tacky...	positive
Aww man, is TLC really getting too cheap for printed parts? Shame on you TLC!! Despite those stickers these are two really neat sets. Especially the airplane. Classic *wub* Reminds me of that little plane my dad bought in an airplane. Not sure what's the set nr.. The window at the rear of the van looks like a normal window frame without the clips for the shutters. I never knew those existed 8-? Might come handy for ship building. Thanks for the review Yoda!	positive
Thanks for the review! I was always going to get these two sets, so you haven't swayed me at all!! X-D I reckon Lego could enhance this sub-theme by releasing a post motorbike (with or without a sidecar) and post office. Obviouly the office would be the hub of all the activity, while the post bike would take care of the postal run. This would free up the van to take or recieve bulk mail or parcels to or from the airport. It could then also do the parcel deliveries around the city. The office would also serve as the reciever for all the parcels the new goods truck might deliver. Just some thoughts, that's all!! *sweet*	neutral
I need to do some catching up here :-P Matn, on Jan 5 2008, 05:16 PM, said: Could you tell me how much you payed for them? I think I'm gonna buy them tomorrow if they have it already (or if I don't see any cooler sets). I paid a tad more than the S@H price: I paid 15 for the plane and 8 for the van (sure its a tad more expensive but I didn't want to wait for TRU to get them) Freddie, on Jan 5 2008, 06:10 PM, said: Am I the first one to notice the new doors used in the back of the van. Not only is it using the popular new frame, but the old container doors have been redesigned to fit with the new frame as well. Pity they're not yellow, though. Great remark there, I guess I totally missed that one :-$ And I agree that yellow doors would have been better but those dark bley do not look that bad !! Mr Hobbles, on Jan 5 2008, 09:10 PM, said: Can you tell me though, the wheels on the van, are they rubber or plastic? They look a bit tacky... Rubber off course ;-) They do look a tad tacky but its because they are the thin type (like with the racers) and I am not a fan of those |-/ phoinix, on Jan 5 2008, 09:35 PM, said: cant wait for your next one Tks ;-) Me neither though :-P marvinblue, on Jan 6 2008, 03:31 AM, said: I reckon Lego could enhance this sub-theme by releasing a post motorbike (with or without a sidecar) and post office.

At one point I was thinking of a impulse set with a yellow bike, postman, post and letters (that would rock !!). I hope TLC adds to this sub theme and keeps that retro feel *wub* A yellow dirtbike with sidecar would be a sweet 5? set !! Also a small town feel post office would be so cool: like a 20/30? set ;-) We can be sure of one thing though, this year's advent calendar will have a postamn and small post office ;-) Post On !! *yoda*	neutral
Thanks for the review :-) I was actually considering getting these, but I saw they were overpriced for my tastes - too bad, theyre nifty lil things *wub*	positive
loool : Spielberg goes on a career change :-D these are some nice sets. I really love that car. looks sleek	positive
While the plane does look nice, I don't particularly care for the van. But the van does have some good parts, which is the only reason I would by one: yellow mud guards, the new windshield, and the small door on the rear.	neutral
Well first off, thanks yoda for the great review. :-) Hmmm... Well, i have to say, i'm not at all impressed with any of these sets. I mean, there nice and all, but the van just seems way to small. It would have been nice if you could fit more than one package in it. I guessi'm one of those that are more of the fan of the 6 wide trucks. And the plane.... Hm. this has a "cute" factor and all, but i mean com'on... You have to open a hatch on the roof to get your packages in?? And what about getting them out? You have to flip the plane upside down? :-| Weak. They should have had a hinged rear end or a hatch on the side.	negative

No stairs in buildings, cars with just one minifig, all those things that make LEGO what it is... Thanks Yoda for your review! Those posts sets will be mine, but I will wait to find them in my supermarket, even if I have to wait 2 or 3 months, I know that I will save some money, so I will buy more LEGO :-D There are simple designed sets, but we don't need more: two nice litle sets that are not oversized and too expensive.	positive

It's so different than those in the US. good point B... this design is just too foreign to my eyes for me to enjoy... i don't like either of these sets, very disapointing - the postal theme has so much potential. i don't really like the torsos either - too plain/cheap as kanal suggested. and i will agree that the wheels on the van look cheap. i was sooooo impressed with city 2007, this is a real let down. though, i am happy to see a small set with a postal box. so, even though, all that aside, i'll probably buy 6 of the van - just for the yellow mudgards, postal box and stickers to populate my city. and i think this set will provide some excellent piece to MOC a yellow civillian convertable with *sweet* - BM	neutral
I'm glad to see the mail van has the doors that used to be on the older cargo containers. I had given up on those older ones, but now that they're still out there, I may invest in the older cargo system instead of the new 6-wide ones. Both sets are good enough, I'll get both. I'm hoping for a postal building too, even though I have the smaller of the old post offices. A nice big modern one would be great. I'm not too hung up about the design of the plane; I've got the neat old cargo plane with the tail that swings open (one of the best plane sets) for big packages. The truck is goofy looking, but if I get sick of looking at it I can rebuild it into a classic looking one. Great review by the way, the pictures are some of the better one I've seen in a review recently.	neutral

I guessi'm one of those that are more of the fan of the 6 wide trucks. I see your point that more cargo capacity would have been better. Nevertheless, my personal preference is for smaller "classic" scale City sets. The mail van is nice and small, and should fit well with my road plates and 1990s cars from the 4561 train. On a side note, did anyone notice the message on the back of both sets' boxes, "designed for easy building and instant play"? It surprised me a little, since these sets seem no less complex than any other City set of late. They look like quick builds, sure, but not as though the designers went out of their way to simplify them.	positive
Thanks *yoda* for the great reviews. I love the airplane, it's really cute. The van needed to grow on me though but you did the trick. I don't like the wheels of the van. They will need replacing. And wouldn't everything have been better if they were completely red? Dr. Brick	neutral

Beach House Reviewed by Dunamis Set 4996 522 Pieces $29.95 from Target Build time 90 minutes Yet another interesting Creator theme house. This one comes fresh of the 2008 line of sets and promises 3 different models. Packing 522 pieces (albeit a lot of 1x1 plates) for only $29.95 it was hard to pass this one by as I was foraging for the new 2008 Star Wars sets at the local Target. Plus, I was itching to do another review since I had finally fully recovered from my marathon UCS Falcon review which took the better part a month to complete. The Box: The box is pretty standard Creator type box which shows off the three models (beach house, Caf? and ?towering? apartment building.) The back of the box shows some of the features of the three models. Interesting features of the three models prominently displayed on the back include: - Food counter complete with coffee (espresso) maker and food warmer (with chicken leg!) - Home office complete with laptop (and the ubiquitous coffee cup.) - Flip up roof granting access inside of beach house. Note the satellite TV dish and even rain gutters along the roofline! Opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals. We?re back to the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets. Note the parts inventory is on the side of the box as well. This is a nice feature. Once inside the box, we are greeted by eight sealed bags plus two yellow 16x2 plates and a green 32x16 baseplate. Thank goodness there is no DSS (dreaded sticker sheet) but alas there are no minifigs. In addition, there are the three manuals (one for each model) and they were stuffed into my box with the care of kid trying to put 10 gallons (or liters if you prefer) of candy in a 5 gallon bucket. But hey, we?re not collecting manuals here so who cares if the manuals are all bent and warped? The Manuals: The three manuals are 74, 72 and 48 pages in length. They are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - Piece call outs for each step - Parts inventory at the end of the primary model build - Page numbers Color separation in these manuals were fine for me. Plus, we get the usual verbose LEGO instructions on not dumping all your pieces outside in the grass and not to dump all your pieces into a single pile. Thanks for the tip, TLG! Parts list The Pieces: Pretty standard stuff here and as I mentioned, lots of 1x1 plates and tiles (at least 100.) However, we do get quite a few windows and a couple of doors. A majority of the color is black and yellow. I did see a few pieces that I was not familiar with so I?m going to show them below. Keep in mind I?m not a parts jockey so bear with me if I think a part is brand new for 2008 and it was actually released with the classic space line. 2x2 Window (fixed) and 4x3 window that opens: The follow photo shows the window glass (same as in Corner Caf?), door glass and new black parts. Turns out these black parts are used as wheels. I showed the window glass because it still contains the molding circle just like they did before. It is hard to see from the photo, but it is there. The door glass I think might be new: I don?t recall seeing these 2x2 round plates with clips before and I thought I would show the mail only because it is printed and not a sticker: I know these are common, but didn?t they have four studs on top? These only have two: How about this sloped 4x3 window that opens: Overall a nice assortment of parts with nothing juniorized. The Build: The build was fun and was fairly straightforward. Once you figure out which of the three models to build, it goes pretty quick. Here are a few shots: See how the inside is made: Look at the detail with the flowers and even the outside water faucet! Outdoor seating area: Upstairs being built: Upstairs with opening roof (notice the satellite TV dish): Check out the patio on the upstairs complete with outdoor light and rain gutters! Here?s my favorite, the BBQ grill. At least we know where those new parts go: Finally, check out the tree. No juniorization here! Here is what is left over: So far, I have only built the primary model. The others look interesting, especially the caf?. The Design: The design was well done. Very rich in detail. I love how there are no juniorized parts. The house is accessible by taking off the top floor (like Caf? Corner and Market Street). There is an internal staircase as well. There is no interior to speak of in the beach house, but there is in the other two models. The only real negative is that it is kind of small when you get it done. It would be nice if it was about 50% bigger. Here are a few views of the beach house with a few minifigs thrown in: Check out the close-up of the caf? which I think looks great: Also, here is a photo of the interior of the apartment building where you can see the office and computer: Overall Thoughts: It is a really nice set. A tad on the small side but it has some great detail and lots of features. Quick enough to build all three models and would fit real nice into an existing town plan. Is minifig scale, but does not come with any. Lots of window parts and black slopes. Is a nice diversion from the onslaught of Clone Wars ships that we can?t remember seeing from the movies. Final Rating: 84% Build 9/10 (Pretty quick and fun.) Functionality 9/10 (It is a Creator set so you have multiple varied builds. Diverse enough to keep the kids entertained.) Design 10/10 (Excellent and well thought out. Outstanding detail for such a small model.) Parts 6/10 (Fair, nothing earth-shattering but lots of slopes and windows.) Price 8/10 (Price ratio is good but you get a lot of little parts. Would be better with minifigs.) Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 06:38 PM. Indexed	positive

Love this set now more than ever. *wub* I knew I wanted it from the first leaked boxshots, especially with my love of yellow buildings (just ask Hinckley ;-) ). Great review, especially nice to see the closeup parts shots. Those new 2x2 white windows are very much like replacements for the classic 2x2 windows TLG stopped regularly making a while back, so it's great to see them. The wheels are trolley wheels, common in sets including stretchers and handcarts. The holder for them is a fairly recent part I think. I remember a couple coming in a little single minifig jet engine repair set I picked up in a S@H order within the last year.

Well today i finally got my hands on set 7038, now since the moment i first saw pics of this set i knew it was for me. So lets start with the new troll helmet and torso, these are both great. This troll really stands out as a leader when next to the usual trolls in the dwarf mining set: Ok so here's a few shots of the front of the set: Now one thing i really like about this set is the way that lego have placed the back wheels higher than the front. This allows the set to really appear to being pulled: Here we have a shot at the missiles on the wagon, these are better than some around i have to say. If you look just behind the bottom missile you will see a simple firing device, simply push it down and then let it go to see those missiles fire: The troll flag is moved behind the missiles for firing: One thing that does bother me about this set is the lack of anything on the rear, ok it's easy to fix with a little moc'ing so it's not the end of the world but i would of liked something placed there: Now lets move on to the Crownie's wagon, this is simple yet good for holding weapons: As for the Crown knights themselves, well there the ones from the impulse sets which is great IMO: Here's a few quick shots of the 2 larger trolls we have so far, i prefer the sand green one. What about you? Well that's the end for now, requests for pics and comments are welcome. Overall i rate this set as a must for anyone who's a fantasy castle fan, i know i'll be getting more of this set...... As for the new wagon well it's joined up with the other trolls: I do hope the impules crownies i bought today can handle them, oh and yes i did change the knights heads X-D : Fantasy war on!! *vader*	positive
seems like a good set should i get it? BTW how did you get you hands on this?	neutral
Looks like an ace set :-$ I may get this just for the sand green troll, even if I'm not a great castle fan, I do want one of them things! *wub* I also love the goblin's new metal flaked helmet, and the same style with the wheels. They look very nice. The chicken leg fishing pole is always fun too :-$	positive
Nice review. *sweet* This is a must buy for me since I *wub* the new sand green giant troll! Now I just have to wait until it's available in the US :'-( General Tarful	positive
Thanks for this excellent review Vader! It seems you are succumbing to the Castle side of the force. I love the new helmet, and the new Orc torso is fantastic as well, which is great to see that the Troll Faction has many ranks too. The Troll himself I love, I agree with you in saying I prefer the sand green version. The battle wagon is cool, one of the better wagon designs, and the flag is a great touch which improves it. Sadly the back is rather empty, but a few mods'll change that :-) And of course this set includes the infamous chicken pole! One pic request, if you have time Vader, could you please post a few pics of the new helmet on its own, and on a human soldier please? Batbrick is Back! >:-)	positive
Thanks for the review *vader*! The first picture of the troll is great, the gold armour really shines! X-D A fantastic set, I'll definitely get a couple of these! *wub* As for the Ogres/'giant trolls', the dark tan one fits in the mine setting well, but for above ground, settings, I prefer the sand green one. *y* ~Peace Edited by iamded, 19 January 2008 - 10:21 AM.	positive

Thanks for the review! i love this set! it's a cheap way to get green trolls, and i love the new helmet, it looks great and I think it will be very usefull for other factions as well. *sweet* DNL	positive
A Troll driven by a turkey leg, what a wonderful little detail!!! :-D :-D Thanks for the review Vader. Very clever, using a flag to hide that crazy firing device. I find it rather odd they used blue pins for this. Black or gray would've been alot more discrete. About the big trolls, I think using different colours is good. I don't think a troll force would be very organized, so different colours would make the effect complete *y* . As for your troops, looks quite fearsome! Definitely compared to my pathetic number of soldiers.. :-$ A nice set, but I would rather get the Attack on Tower though.. no matter about the price difference.	negative

Lego City Truck & Forklift Set # 7733 Pieces: 343 Price: $24.99 (USD) Store of Purchase: Toys R'Us Release Date: January 2008 After discussion of the mysterious yellow cargo contained in this new City transport set and a visit to my local TRU, I purchased this set. I was immediately pleased with the price/piece which I think is pretty reasonable (343 pieces for $25). Starting with the box, great City artwork boasting "Special Edition": Tha backside of the box (no alternate models comes as no surprise): The dreaded decals (I was looking for the skull and bones for radioactive, but no such luck): My favorite part of the set, a very clever forklift: Side view: And the backside: What I like about the forklift is the bars across the top giving the vehicle a "real-life" design. The double wheels in the front with two pieces that can hold the wheels also adds to a clever design: I like the figs (although not much new - perhaps I'll make the driver into a werewolf later): The set includes three cargo pallets, the first some sort of fuel with gauge: The 2nd, two Indy containers, and a square 2x4 brick (I have not put the decals on yet): And the mysterious yellow cargo. Your guess is as good as mine :-$ . On to the truck, the front section: The front grill: Another angle: The back: I like the opening mechanism that is very simple, but works well. Also is the large plate tile piece inside. I like this because the entire interior has no studs: And the trailer section of the truck: Orange and yellow tail lights: And the rear trailer open: The complete set: Summary: This is a neat set that reminds me a bit of classic Lego City (but larger). It is very playable and has a lot of accessories adding to the value. The build was very simple, and enjoyable (took me about an hour). It is a great addition to a number of City sets including the Cargo Ship, Container Stacker, the World City Cargo Train, and the new Cargo Plane. As I mentioned previously, I have not yet put on the decals that I'm sure will really add to the overall look of the set. The forklift is awesome and I like the cargo containers. The truck could have benefited from a few additional details (chrome smokers, and an undercarriage box that really opens). Considering everything, I would buy this set again. Hope you enjoy and perhaps this mysterious cargo will make its way into a Brickster Mystery. *y*	positive
The forklift is amazing, and nice design of the opening side doors aswell. Thanks for the review, I may actually pick this one up ;-)	positive

Getting off topic, I'd like to see Lego make a car transport truck. I don't think I've ever seen one in Lego. It would definately have to be 6-wide, or even larger.	negative

Nice review, your camera is much better now.

Wow, that's a great review of a great set Dr S! *y* As you yourself have already noted, this has the potential to be a fantastic military MOC!

Nice review, Dr. S! I have been thinking long and hard about the scale of the planes in my town. I would like to keep my passenger planes in their classic 4-wide fuselage style, but I really don't mind the new plane hull pieces if they are used as an enormous transport plane like the Ilyushin-76. Unfortunately I can't afford this lovely new green one at the moment (which would be perfect to go with my green army) as I took too much of a hit buying the new 2008 Star Wars sets! But I have modified my white one to take huge cargo loads, in fact my APC is designed specifically to fit inside. Unfortunately I'm a bit busy to take pics at the moment, but hope to put some up soon.	neutral

Thanks for a nice review, Piranha. *y* A lovely playset, with a classical Egyptian adventurers touch. Although I?m not completely sure for the robot arms for the statues.... Somehow, a little more details could?ve worked well for that set.... 8-|	positive
Wow I can't believe other people have had this same head error mistake! X-O I thought it was one of those extreme cases of production slip up! The good thing is I will get a replacement Indy head, and get to keep that Anakin head!! I forgot to mention that my set was also missing 1 black ear piece for the Anubis statues There also are extra stickers for my set, I can't figure out what they are for though? hehe, I too like my TOD Indy fig 8-| :-D P	neutral
I got mine today! X-D I too got an Anakin Clone Wars head, although I'm not really complaining since I already have an Indy head from the Motorcycle Chase set. It is really odd that they would pack in such a different looking head though. Also, for those that think the head has no use, try placing it under one of the braided new brown dwarf beards. It looks pretty nice, I think! *y* On the set, it's wonderful! The hieroglyphic stickers are wonderful, Marion (especially her head and hair) is wonderful, and the Anubis statues are nice too. There's also lots of nice tan parts, such as 20 round 2x2s, and 8 1x8 bricks. All in all, it's a great set for the price, and I can't wait to get Race for the Stolen Treasure and Temple Escape now! *sweet*	positive
I got this set and there weren't any qualms/misprints/mis packagings. Hmmm, must be a small problem.	neutral
Yeah in mine I did not have any problems. Well except on one of my dark blue round pieces it was a bit damaged but it still worked fine and I got a replacement from LEGO.	neutral
Welcome to: My sigfig Sgt. Joey Sh. will lead trough this review of the new City 7743 Police Surveilance Truck. First of all the box: Front Back The Minifigs: 3 Police officers and a bad guy Now the vehicles: The cute little ATV *wub* The main part of the set: The Surveilance Truck A shot of the interior The trailer Back of the trailer The truck Back Side The little building: Front The interior And last but not least: Spare parts and not needed stickers That?s it! Hope to see you again at the next episode of Sgt. Joey?s Reviews.	positive
Thanks for the review, Stealth Hunter. *y* That truck looks better than I expected, and it?s for sure a pretty playable set. Nice, but still too much police mayhem to me. I think the new police station?ll satisfy all my safety needs.... :-)	neutral
Great review Stealth Hunter, a bit blurry in places but overall nice shots of the truck. It is much, much better than I expected, but i still won't get it, I have no need for more police. Thanks for the great review! Batbrick Away! >:-)	neutral
Thanks for the review, that truck is actually better than I first thought! I am still tossing up getting it, as I am getting the Police Station, and where would it park?! :-P I quite like the little building though, but still... I am so confused *wacko*	neutral
I like the new station but the truck is a good question. I still like the classic 1994 one and the 1980's can that was one of the first units I got	neutral
Great review, Batbrick! Iamded got what he deserved. X-D	positive
Great review! Keep them coming! I might get this set now. I must have those grey barrels... Oh dear... :-D X-D :-P X-D This was a hilaruos review, too. Edited by ~VBBN~, 10 February 2008 - 11:21 PM.	positive
I wish I could just get those grey barrels alone, the rest of the set doesnt really intreigue me much :-$ Thanks for the review.	negative
Thanks everyone, heres part 2: The second instruction booklet includes instructions for both alternate models, which is good, I hate having too many manuals: Here she is, the plane: Its very nice and well proportioned, but where did iamded get that laser? Overview, the landing gear is very sturdy and nice, and the wings are surprisingly good: Top view, iamded's head fell into the propellers, I was trying to save him, honest! A view of how the motor on this one works, by pushing the orange button you can make the prop spin. It is well integrated like the chopper, though the prop only spins for about 2 1/2 seconds. Still, its a nice feature: The tail is also well made, simple, but lovable. Oh, and check out that tank! The prop spinning, Agh! Is that MY hand? Final view, there seems to be some sort of explosion here 8-| Well I think I got iamded more than me atleast. The second model is also great, though not as good as the chopper. The lack of space to fit something into the cockpit brings it down a bit, but it is a very nice model overall. I recommend it, though unlike the chopper it will be hard to mod into minifig scale. So far so good with 4995, here are the leftover pieces from the model: Enjoy! Batbrick Away! >:-)	positive
I really like this set... even though I was hoping for a mini-motor! :-D Chock full of great parts too. Thanks for the review. *sweet*	positive

Congrats to that nice review.... I like the Batcave set, you should also been able to find it at discount....	positive
Thank you for your wonderful review! ) I was done very well.... ) I suggest that you will find "Two-Face's Escape" set a very interesting one to build.... It also provides great playability and is not very expensive for what you will get. ) Good day to you. )	positive

It is a tie between Two Face's escape and the batcave... but I would go with the cave... over 1000 pieces, nifty submarine, penguins, alfred, mr freeze, and and and.... it is wonderful...! especially for 38?!! :-) ol' style Batman ON! (yep, this is a lil' rant on 2008 batman.. :-P )	positive
6258 Smuggler's Shanty Overview Smuggler's Shanty was released in 1992, it consisted of 69 pieces, 3 minifigs (two pirates, one Imperial) and it cost $9.25 (USD). The set itself is a small but rather sturdy den for the pirates! Review: The minifigs consist of two pirates and one Imperial. The minifigs are not all that rare, which is disappointing, I would of liked a rarer fig! But still it is a good cheap source of pirate and Imperial figures. Here is an overall shot of the set, which includes the three figs, the shanty which is made using palm leaves pieces, and a nice grey shark nibbling at the soldier's oar. A close up of the soldier rowing hard in his boat. I would have preferred to have a normal soldier with shako hat, as I have more officers than normal soldiers now!: And a close up snap of the main structure. Note the wine glass, which was a nice touch! Funnily enough, only 4 pieces of treasure were included in this set, compared to the usual 8 gold coins in other sets. A view from the back, which also gives a good view of the pieces used to construct the shanty mainly simple black 1 by 1 bricks: The Shanty looks good from most angles but their are a few where the roof construction looks rather odd, but that is just a minor nitpick! Yet another view from the front,, this time at a slightly different angle. The yellow base plate looks rather nice too, I prefer it over the tan pieces we trend to get nowadays: "Attack!!" The Stupid drunk pirate in the background does not even notice! Overall I think this is a rather good set, despite some shortcomings, such as the lack of treasure and odd roof from some angles. The shark, Imperial soldier and useful parts make up for it, and of course the price is cheap on most auction sites, I got mine for a mere ?5 ($10), with the cheapest price on Bricklink being $8. Rate the set then leave your comments, thoughts and opinions!!!	positive
First I'll comment on the review and at a later date I'll comment on the set. You've done a top job Lord of Pies *y* You've captured the set from a variety of angles and posed the mini-figures interestingly.	neutral
simonwillems, on Feb 19 2008, 07:47 PM, said: Nice poll as well, but you made sure nobody can give this set a 1 which is very nice (but probably a little mistake :-D ). I gave it the top-rating. *y* So I have, oops! I never was very good at maths. :-P	positive
Wow. I remember this set from when I was a kid. I got it for my birthday and opened the package first. Sadly, I had to go to school so I had to leave it at home and not build it or play with it until I got home. Needless to say that was one of the longest days of school ever. Good review, great set.	positive
I bought one of these new from Bricklink a few months ago as part of my Pirate splurge I went on. I really enjoyed this set because of the amount of figs in such a small set, though Pirates were always pretty good about their fig count. Also the neat little hut is nicely done for its purpose. Great review, btw!	positive
First of all excellent Review! 5/5 for me. I have yet to attain one of these sets. It has a nice trio of men including a redcoat, and a nice assortment of weapons. The rest, such as the leaves, is great for MOCing. imperialshadows, on Feb 19 2008, 08:41 PM, said: I gave it a 4 out of 5, just because I'd buy 4 out of 5 sitting on the shelves today, were it possible. If I saw 5 of these sitting on a shelf I would certainly buy all 5, then I would ask to speak with a manager to see if there is any way I can attain more pirate Lego stuff. simonwillems, on Feb 19 2008, 08:47 PM, said: Nice poll as well, but you made sure nobody can give this set a 1 which is very nice (but probably a little mistake :-D ). I gave it the top-rating. One should not step into the pirates domain and give a mere 1 to any non4+ pirate set. Duke	positive
woow :D this was my first LEGO set ever!	neutral
This set shows the awesomeness of classic pirate sets. I really have to get me some more! XD Great Review on a great set!	positive
A nice review and a nice little set for anyone's Pirate collection. A 5/5 for the review.	neutral
I'd give the set a 3 1/2 out of 5. It needed 1 more Imperial to get a 4. A bigger basplate would have been nice as it appears to hard to fit all the minifigs on the island. Thanks for this great review	neutral
IMO this is a very simple and small set good to add some part to forbidden island. good	positive
Laurinator- I don't mind an occassional old review coming back to life for discussion, but it seems you've replied to many old reviews that have been stagnant for years. Please try to refrain from "bumping" a lot of old topics as it pushes down new content that should really be the focus of discussion now.	neutral
Hi guys. I picked these up the other day, but it's taken me this long to get round to posting the reviews. So, here we go: Tub comparison with a minfig (thanks Brainbox): The lighting changes a bit throughout the photographs, as it was going dark outside, so I only really had my desk light, and I kept getting in the way. 4837 Mini Trains Now the box I really like. It's no different to those of last year's sets, but the colour here is simply fantastic, and really seems appropriate for the theme. So this is what you get inside. All the pieces are still inside the bag, the optical illusion was accidental :-D . No pieces of particular outstanding interest, but the dark green cheese slopes are rather nice. Look out for those later. 1 2 3 This is the main model, and uses all the pieces in the set (bar these two, which according to the inventory are spares, but as with all my other Creator sets, I'm cheating and leaving them in). This is far and away the best model of the three, and evokes the iconic version of a steam train. The green looks superb, but I'm not sure whether that's due to the model itself or the actual colour. Moving on, we get to the second model: 1 Leftovers (yes, I admit, I was using a piece of paper) This isn't actually a bad model. I don't think it's quite as nice as the previous one, but it's not bad. It's different from the first model as well, which is good. Too muich of the same can be a bad thing. Finally, we come to the third model: Leftovers Now... I'll be honest. I don't really know what this is. It's not that good a model compared to the other two. That's all I can say, really. And of course, all the pieces fit into the tub. Overall: I have to say, I do like this set, despite the weak third model. The strength of the primary and secondary models make up for any weaknesses in the third, and I can imagine the pieces being fully usuable in building other trains. While the basic idea of these tubs isn't quite as good as the X-Pods with regards portability and general 'niceness' they aren't bad. And for a fairly cheap price (?3-4) as well. 4838 Mini Vehicles This is one of those set boxes that you see because of the ridiculously loud colours. Sound marketing scheme if you ask me. I've managed it again. There are pieces outside the bag. Or are there? Now these I like *y* . 1 2 (I don't know what the clip is for, there isn't one on the other side) 3 4 5 This is the main model of the set, and again all the pieces are used bar these three, the spares. It's quite a nice model, although the car's a bit odd. Still, I like the ramps, and the colour scheme reminds me just a little of G1 Ultra Magnus. Hmm, I think that boom arm could do with refixing... 1 2 Leftovers This is actually quite nice as well. It's that classic breakdown truck, and the boom arm itself is quite nice, with quite a bit of movement. Another solid model. 1 Leftovers I'm surprised by the amount of detail here actually. Not only have TLC included a spare wheel at the back, but also what looks like a trailer hitch, which all adds to the 'realism.' Another nice model to round out a nice set. And in the tub. Overall: I'm not sure which of the two I like better. When I bought them, and on the way home, I much preferred the train set. But after building this set, I'm not sure. This is another good set from the year when TLC seems to be giving us so many. There are some good pieces in here too, and while there's nothing unique, they're still good. So, thanks for reading, hope it helped someone, and if there are any requests, I'll see what I can do. That's requests for pics, not songs ;-) . Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 06:56 PM.

Tks for that nice review, brainbox! I recieved the construction diggers set like this last year. Gee what a nice parts pack. I like that orange lidded set, the truck. So nice. I won't get it though.	positive
Thanks for the review Brainbox. *sweet* These look really nifty* I might pick up a couple of these as for the parts, I'm sure they could come in handy for something. And so cheap as well. I still miss X-pods though. :'-( *Do the kids still say nifty these days? *wacko*	neutral

Thanks for these great reviews Brainbox, I never expected you to do a review for some reason. I love these mini sets, the Train in particular is great. I won't get any though, those Indy sets are coming in fast and I'm gonna need all the money I can muster. Still they are nifty little sets. Batbrick Away! >:-)	positive

Mmmmh, I *wub* love the train... Great review. It looks like each model can be connected to the other to make a complete train. *y* *y* It makes me want to get 3 of them (or more) to make a long one. :-D	neutral
So here it is finally, my first ever review of a lego set..oh wait, it's actually 2 sets. So i don't really know how to do it right, but i'll try the best. (Sorry if some pictures are a litte bit dark, but i'm not really into photography and i got bad light here) Let's Start with the Dwarf's Mine Defender: Theme: Castle 2008 Set Name: Dwarf's Mine Defender Number: 7040 Pieces: 86 Price: ?9,99 (EUR) First, as always, the box: The back, a few instructions on how the defender works, for those how don't know ;-) : And the instructions: We continue with the minifigs, sorry i forgot to make a closeup of the dwarf: And finally the mine defender itself, i personally think it isn't as bad as maybe some people think. The chain for the catapult is great i think: I kinda love those controls, the mechanism with the rubbe rband actually works pretty well, but only on a not-glossy underground. That's pretty much all of it, it's small but i like it a lot. So let's go on to the tower raid now, which would be my absolute favorite of those new sets. -------------------------------------- Theme: Castle 2008 Set Name: Tower Raid Number: 7037 Pieces: 364 Price: ?29,99 (EUR) Again, first the box & Instructions: We got 2 sets of instructios here, one for the tower and one for the siege tower: The Minifigs, we got one archer and one soldier here, both with the torsos of the 2007 sets: Now thw orc side, starting with the great leader, with the new armor and the golden helmet (i love those pieces!): Closeup of the armor & helmet: Then we got another orc-knight: And the prisoner, with handcuffs! The Crownie Tower looks great overall, though there is something i don't really like about it, but later on that. Now the back, and that is what really bothers me, there areno walls on the first floor except the one with the wall-piece and the door, and theprison also is open at the back. The orc easily could jump out there: Not sure what these are all about, they really don't add much to the set: Enough rant now, let's go on with a pretty sweet detail, the golden crystal on the little table: The wall piece on the first floor you can ram in: And finally the very best thing of this set, the amazing orc siege tower! From the front: The great working ram, you can pull it back very far and it got pretty much power: Here we got another sweet detail, the siege "platform" that moves out by pulling a cord in the back of the tower: Finally a picture of a bit siege action: If you ram in the lower wallpiece, the brown shelfs of the prison-floor collapse and the prisoned orc is finally free! Summary: Likes: As i mentioned before, i really think that's the best ever produced siege tower, it's got so mich details and works extremely well, also the overall look of it is magnificant. The destroy-mechanism of the tower is pretty cool too, the brown door is a fine detail too. Nothing much to say about the mine defender, i like this little set, and there's nothing really to bother about it. Dislikes: The Back of the tower. That's really the only thing that's a bit bad imo, they could have put there 2 more walls on the first floor and something to lock the prison easily. Final Thought: The Tower Raid for me personally is the best of the 2008 sets so far, it's got great playability and looks simply good. My opinion: Buy it!	positive
Tks for these cool reviews metalandi !! I love these orc sets !! I am so going to get these ;-) I'm happy to see that scared face again (I love it really !!) and the use of that handculfs !! That new armour looks really cool That tower is really nice and I wont mod it that much which os cool and the battle ram is freaking sweet !! Tks again for sharing ;-) *yoda*	positive
Great review, pictures and all! Thanks for showing all the mechanisms of the tower, I didn't notice them from either the pics we had or the instructions--it didn't hit me that when you knock down the wall the second floor breaks. That is a genius idea. This looks like a superb set, unfortunately my priority right now is the Troll Warship. Still, if that really is U.S. $80, I might skip it and go for this instead, which is only $20 US. One note, though. I think there might not be a back cage on the second floor of the tower so that the mechanism can work. Did you try to see if the second floor ground still falls if you add it a fourth cage wall? Also, you could just pretend that the tower is built against a mountainside. It would fit perfectly and add more defense to the Knights. Great review! :-) VK	positive
Tks for those so much!! :'-) *y* Nice reviews! I love that tower raid, and the defender, and will buy them both. Quote really don't add much to the set: Oh, but they do. More pieces= higher price. ;-)	neutral
Thanks for these fantastic review. It's the first time I take a good look at these sets. There is a good chance I'll buy the Dwarf's Mine Defender, especially for that price.	neutral
This set didn't come with the new jail door piece? I'd have guessed it would have, since there is an orc in prison. Nice review. I'm looking forward to picking up these sets. Steve	neutral
Thank you for these fine reviews, metalandi. *y* There?re really some nice playable features in the Tower raid set, and all these great Orc torsos, just sweet! And it even looks like that black Orc-armor?s a new piece, lovely.... :'-)	positive
Cheers for the reviews. They're both nice sets, and I think I just may have to buy both. Or maybe I'll get two of the dwarf set? The figs in each are really cool as well. The dwarf, well, they're just cool anyway, but the troll with the golden helmet and armour, that's just *wub*	positive
The Tower Raid has the best price per piece ratio in the whole 2008 line. Thanks for the review ^_^	positive
Thanks metalandi! These are 2 great sets, I'm definately looking forward to seeing these in New Zealand stores! The collapsing floor/prisoner freeing mechanism on the tower is wonderful, a great touch. Some slight modifications, like, some walls, will make this perfect. And the Dwarf's Mine Defender is a sweet little set, with some neat minifigs. Thanks for the reviews! *y* ~Peace	positive
Thanks for these great reviews! *sweet* The dwarfs mine defender looks interesting, the figs though are *wub* The only thing missing is a weapon for the dwarf and some shields The battering ram and tower are awesome! 8-? The Troll King with new torso, helmet, and body armor is simply amazing I like how the troll is handcuffed :-D The tower shows nice detail except for the poor "brig" . I love that gold crystal! The battering ram is a thing of beauty! $30 for the Tower and Ram and $10 for the Defender are very well priced! I still want the Battle Wheel more though! Damn Exclusives! :'-( >:-( P	positive
Thanks for the review, I personally think the siege tower is probably the best one which Lego has ever produced.	positive
Well, I don't think Orcs are that sturdy, seeing that they'd have to jump from the second level of the tower, I don't see survival as his chief objective! :-P Awesome review! I'm loving these sets more and more! The Tower Raid is DEFINITELY the best and the cheapest set there! >:-) Oh, and Pirhana, it's not really a 'king', it's more like an officer. Remember, the Wizard rules these goblins! Edited by trooperdavinfelth, 22 February 2008 - 02:49 PM.	positive
*sweet* WOW!! Another excellent review! Haha, that tower does reminds me of KK II of Mistland Tower =x Well, overall, i love these 2 sets very very much *sweet*	positive
Thank you for the nice review. Pity the tower is not designed better, but I still want to buy these 2 sets. If only there were 2 dwarves in the DMDefender.	neutral
I got myself today 3 Dwarf's Mine Defender and I have to say that sets does suck big time: the plastic rubber band doesn't do squat, and 3 wheels i really not enough. I only built 2 of those and changed the front of it with 4 wheels and no plastic rubber band and I changed the 2x2 dark bley plate. Its still looks good but the crappy rubber band system is really not well thought off. Anyhow my Orc army is growing >:-) *yoda*	negative
xwingyoda, on Mar 1 2008, 06:32 AM, said: Its still looks good but the crappy rubber band system is really not well thought off. *yoda* i totally agreed with your comments. The rubber system is not effective at all. I bought 2 defenders recently and i found out that when the wheels move, the rubber just stuck there without rotating the blades at the front :-/ I have not really found a solution for mine yet. So far, i only took out the rubber band, placing the blades on the ground, removing of the red technic part on the left side. In this way, when the defender is moving on smooth ground, the blades will move too ;-)	negative

Green Grocer Reviewed by Dunamis Set 10185 2,352 Pieces $149.95 from The LEGO Store (Glendale, CA) Build time 6.5 hours Holy guacamole! Almost exactly one year after Caf? Corner was released we get the third installment in the increasingly popular LEGO exclusive town series. Combined with the famous 10182 Caf? Corner and its trusty companion 10190 Market Street this trio makes the foundation for an amazing city block of LEGO goodness. For those new to this series of sets, check out my reviews of the two previous sets in this line: Cafe Corner Market Street I would not necessarily recommend reading too many of my reviews in one setting as you might experience loss of brain cells and/or drowsiness. You have been warned. So, how does Green Grocer stack up to the two previous sets you ask? Well, follow along kind reader and I shall attempt to unravel this question. The Box: The gigantic box is pretty standard and looks amazingly similar to the Caf? Corner box. The back of the box shows some of the features of the green grocer as well as a lot of the cool interior that was absent from the previous sets. In addition, we are shown an image of the three sets together and a small insert image showing how they connect together (as if we could not master that difficult maneuver?) Opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals. As it seems to be the norm now, we have the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets. However, upon opening the tabs we are pleasantly surprised to find a cardboard tray! Have not seen one of those in a while. As you can see in the photo, we have two 32x16 green base plates, three instruction manuals and a bunch of bags that are broken into four groups: Group 1 has 12 bags and goes with the first manual and builds the first floor. Group 2 has 9 bags and goes with the second manual to build the second floor. Group 3 has 14 bags and goes with the third manual for the top floor and roof. And one bag that is not numbered and hence you can open it whenever you feel like it. There are no stickers ? Yay! Moving right along, we get to the three instruction manuals. The Manuals: The three manuals are 55, 47 and 47 pages in length. They are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - Piece call outs for each step - Parts inventory at the end of the second manual - Page numbers Color separation in these manuals was fine for me except dark bley and black. We get a nice photo of all three sets together: Plus, we get a nice tip showing how to split up the bags and what goes where. Those additional pieces you see in the photo just below the numbered bags are the pieces that come from the single un-numbered bag (along with the base plates). Parts list Random manual shot The Pieces: Upon opening the first set of bags, one thing is clear; there are a TON of little tiny pieces! The minifigs are included in this first section as well. Interesting to note that there are a handful of printed pieces and as I mentioned previously, no stickers. We also get a host of new and exciting pieces to add to our collection. Keep in mind my scope of LEGO sets is generally centered around Star Wars, Technic, Creator and the occasional racer set so what is new to me might have been around 15 years. At any rate, here are some of the more interesting pieces: Again, note the printed tiles. This time around, LEGO has decided to include 33% more minifigs than the Caf? Corner and Market Street sets. Yes, we get four minifigs instead of three! Here are the cast of characters: Pictured (left to right) is Sir Top Hat, Miss Jenny Blue Overalls, Patti O? Furniture and little Timmy Cub Scout. I?ll leave it up to the minifig aficionados to decipher which torsos are new and to tell us all about the hairpieces. I can say with reasonable certainty that the four yellow smiley heads are not new (somebody check that?) Don?t forget the lovable little cat named ?Tom?. He is the arch-rival of the mouse ?Jerry? that lives downstairs: Overall, there are a lot of pieces, large variety and wide range of colors. The Build: If you have either of the two previous sets, you will feel right at home here. Just like in the previous builds, it seems like the first ten build steps are consumed with laying a bunch of 1x1, 1x2 and 2x2 tiles everywhere. Almost feels like 30% of the pieces are used up right away (see below). There are several sections where you build various parts of the interior. Take a look at the cash register/counter below: And the beverage cooler: And the produce stand and everything that goes in it: Looks like someone has mail: Looks like someone just had a baby: This set is incredibly well done and gives inspiration to go back and add similar items to Caf? Corner and Market Street. As before, the average builder is introduced to some new building techniques like using the hinge plates to make the angles on the front of the building as shown below: Also the top of the roof shows some interesting ideas: Overall, it is a really fun build that kept me entertained the whole way. The Design: This is a great set with lots of little details. I especially like the little mouse hole in the wall leading to the Jerry the mouse?s area. They even included a little slice of cheese! It seems the designers can?t get away from the ?usual? staircase which I always feel is way too big. Maybe future designs can incorporate a spiral staircase to save room for other things in the model. One welcome addition is the fire escape as seen below: I?m going to show a bunch of examples of various items in the set so you can get the feel of the amazing detail in this design. Take a look at the lamps (torches?) just outside the door: And the streetlight with fire hydrant: Brickwork and archway: Awning: Here is the back side of the building. Note the trashcans and yard tools: Here is a close-up of the railings on the second story balcony and the second photo is the finished product with curtains in the window. Nice use of cups to make the banister on the second floor: Here is the fireplace on the second floor: Second floor staircase with Tom?s hiding spot: Check out the radiator on the third floor: More third floor: Nice grandfather clock and rug (third floor) Check out the deck that is up on the roof. Complete with two chairs, table, umbrella, flower pots and grill: Interesting use of minifig hammers on the roof: Finally, here is what is left over when we?re done: A couple of shots of the front: A shot of the back: And here are all three together: Overall Thoughts: This is an incredible set and the best of the three in my opinion. It is hard to top Caf? Corner but I believe Green Grocer just did. I absolutely love all the details and building techniques that went into making this set. There is a ton of different parts and wide color selection. As usual, we get a bunch of tiles and small plates, but that goes with the series. Also, we get four minifigs and lots of minifig accessories. I?m giving this set a score of 100%! I thought about it and I really don?t know how they could have made it any better. In short, RUN don?t walk to go pick this set up! Final Rating: 100% Build 10/10 (Excellent - Lots of nice interiors, details and accessories to build.) Functionality 10/10 (Outstanding. Raises the bar with interior and detail. Think Caf? Corner on steroids.) Design 10/10 (Excellent ? can?t say enough good things about it.) Parts 10/10 (Great selection and diverse colors. Great minifigs.) Price 10/10 (Price ratio is excellent but lots and lots of little parts. Well worth the price.) As alway, feel free to comment, complain and question what you see here. I'd like to hear your feedback on this amazing set.	positive
Wow! That's a great review I'm glad you took so many pictures, this set is far better than I ever expected it to be, the detail inside is great. Is it the first set you'e given 100% to?	positive

What a beautiful set, TLC give the designer a pay rise immedietly. I was lucky to order one of these while they were on sale to us aussies ;-) but dont worry lego the $100 you saved me will be spent on more sets like this.

Like the set, this review also deserves a 10/10. I've ordered this set yesterday on S@H. Seeing and reading this review, I'm convinced it will be worth the money. So, Bonaparte is finally entering the City theme !!!	positive
Great review, great set. I can't mine until after Easter. *weeps*.	positive
Truly an awesome review. Thanks Dunamis. I ordered my two copies (one to build, one to store in the "vault") last week. Can't wait to get this one! The attention to detail here is what makes the set great. There's nothing to criticize about this set. It's really the closest thing to perfection that I have seen from TLC. The difference between this set and CC is the interior detail, and because of that, GG now become (in my opinion) the best set EVER released by TLC. Do the CC/GG/MS sets fit well with the 50th anniv. town plan? My impression is that out of the box, at least, they don't. Which is too bad. However, I don't think it would be hard to mod the Town Plan so it looks like it belongs in the same town as CC/GG/MS. These sets, to me, are what I have always wanted from TLC as an adult. I hope they keep up the line, and add more elements to this excellent lineup.	positive
wow,, thanks for the nice review! I have the other 2 sets and waiting for this to come to our shores. Stupendous Design and Details! I really like the "hammer-rails" on the roof. CANt wait!!! *wub*	positive
A very informative review, indeed. Thank you so much for doing so. Now I know that the price is worth every penny leaving my pocket. ;-) What do you guys think is TLC putting up as the next modular set? Is it asking too much of TLC to produce 1 modular set each quarter (4 times a year)?	positive
A million thanks for this review. This is greater than I thought. I especially like that clock. I'm going to get this set as soon as possible.	positive

Great review. Thanks for taking the time to do this. This has been a great line. At the risk of abandoning my Castle/Adventurer loyalties. I've got to say this is rapidly becoming my favorite line and this set looks to be the best of the lot. While it still hurts to shell out $150, I think I'll still be happy to do so. Steve	positive
Thank you sooo much for this amazing review Dunamis! i absolutly adore this set and you've review has prompted me to certainetly start saving! (i have a bit left over form christmas that will come in handy! :-D ) I love the little fridge downstairs, the fire escape and the mouse hole, alot more good ideas that we can all use in creating our own buildings! This line is by far my favorite lego line ever! (yes even beats starwars, but only just ;-) ) Hooray for Dunamis! X-D	positive
I?ve got something, I want to share with you. A beautiful dream came true: #1: the box: Top: Back: the alternate model is also very well done. The pneumatics dump the bucket and open the flap (?). Open: you can see a diagram how the pneumatics work. Just a happy kid playing. The plastic inlays (?): All: #2: the parts: As you can see, 8854 offers a very large variety of different parts. Loads of Technic bricks, gears and even plates. Also note the threaded axle 10, 5 large pulleys, a big turntable and the 1x20 Rack. #3: building: The mechanism for the outriggers and the rotation of the turntable: The turntable: The pneumatics are finished: The mechanism for the telescope: The finished model: #4 random shots: You can see how the turntable will be rotated. Thanks for reading- erm? viewing the pictures! Please comment if you want to!	positive
Really cool set! This has convinced me that I really want it!	positive
Wow, another old technic set review by you. Nice set, and thanks for that review.	positive
Great pictures, especially the perspective from overhead. This is one of my favorite Technic models because it packs so many features in a relatively small space. And I'm working on documenting this one in Technicopedia right now! Thanks for the photos, Eric	positive
Thanks for another fun review! This set is high on my list of things to buy, I love cranes, built many and bought many including the classic 8460 from 1995 and the more recent 8421. That threaded axle never stopped intriguing me... It was use in so few sets (I believe 8851 contained one as well?) and I still don't know why it's better than any other axle. Congratulations with a near mint copy of this set! :-)	positive

It was use in so few sets (I believe 8851 contained one as well?) and I still don't know why it's better than any other axle. The purpose of the threaded axle is to carry tension. Regular axles are used primarily for carrying torsion (for gears), sometimes for compression (8855 landing gear, helicopter skids), and sometimes just for looks (roll cages, canopies). But used in tension, connectors will usually just pop off. With the threads and the corresponding nuts, this part can be used to squeeze parts together (like the pen in the plotter of 8094), or to hold heavy assemblies onto turntables (like 8862 and 8851). With the power crane (8854) reviewed here, that is the complete list of sets which used this part. I wrote about it here: http://www.ericalbre...1984.html#Parts Eric	neutral
As I bought it, I didn't even know I would also get a box. It just said: all parts with building instructions. After opening the parcel I was like: "woah... woooaaahhh" and so on. ;-) I love LEGO-boxes because as a child I stood in the toy stores starring at the boxes, only seeing the front and the back, nothing more. This brings back some memories... :'-)	positive

This was my first technic set, aged 7! Still a great one in terms of function density, and a great B-model. In the UK I'm certain it was called the "Salvage Hoist".	positive
yeah. If I rebuild and wash a model I will record it. Glad to see you liked it!	positive
Ah a good old retro review. Those old school days had some pretty impressive sets, with alot more complexity than modern sets. If you have it may I recommend 8880?	positive
Thanks for reviewing this classic set. I got it when it first came out and still love it: the suspension, steering and robust look of the model haven't been done that well ever since. This set puzzled me though, back in the days. The rear suspending part containing the differential and some gears was shown different on the box from the instructions. In the instructions it showed that the (grey part of the suspension) in the back had to be made using a 1x2 smooth tile and 4 cornerplates (2x2) in grey. The box however showed a much sturdier solution using a 1x8 tile and a 1x8 plate. It is also visible on the cover of the instructions. The pieces I mean are in this picture: BerndDasBrot, on Mar 9 2008, 07:05 PM, said: Otherwise, great set!	positive
I've seen a few cases like this where the box pictures are slightly different from the actual model. The Airtech Claw Rig compressor is another one that comes to mind. The changes sometimes seem pointless and make you wonder why they bothered. :-P Quote the only original stickers are the front headlight-patterns on the 2 red 1x2 bricks. The others have been destroyed - must have been the bad decaying sticker quality that breaks when you'll remove it - so I printed them. I didn't print the flag for only the alternate model needs it, although it's a neat idea...! The other stickers on mine have held up pretty well, although I didn't try to remove them after I put them on. The flag started to break after a year or so and just fell off its axle at one point. I taped over it and it's holding up well now, although it's a little frayed along one edge. This is actually the earliest set I've seen that uses this crappy sticker material (which is unfortunately very common today). Even other Technic sets had good stickers for many years after that.	negative

It needed a color, so I took red "because all beautiful and fast cars are red..." My physics teacher contradicted. :-)	neutral
I can remember that I've seen a few color variations on brickshelf and on ebay (They sold well). It's new and familiar at the same time. That makes it more interesting!	positive
I read blackbirds technopedia page on this truck the other week, went onto ebay and picked up a MISB copy for £25 GBP Bargin, great to get old sets unopened, peeling the plastic off of the specialist parts was always cool! Love the front suspension	positive
That price is exceptional. It's less than what I paid for mine 9 years ago, and is even less than the original price of the set. Note that the stickers in this set are the bad variety that will crack and peel over time. If you want to preserve them (the Technic flag in particular), you will need to tape over it.	neutral
Somehow I also managed to get this set in very good condition (including box, instructions and all stickers) for a mere €22 a few months ago. This is indeed a very special set, and was a pleasure to build. The only flaw I noticed was weak support of the rear drivetrain, which was easily corrected with a few extra plates.	positive

thanx for the review. i have one question. do these aliens have moving arms? as far as the set goes i think lego did a bad job on the alien ship. i dont think any of the alien ships look good in Mars Mission the human fanction got a lot better this year and i would have bought this buggy if it came by its self..	negative

Thank you for your nice review, vbbn! *y* But it only confirms: This theme is NOT my cup of tea.

Well, as bad a concept aliensvshumans is for a theme... I really do like this set. The human rover has nice parts for reuse, especially those oldschool space wheels. And despite those wobbly wings, I really like the alien ship. goes from a flying saucer-ish shape to a spread winged almost raven shape, very ominous and cool looking. Now that 'alien commander' is terrible... if I don't buy bionicle minifigs already, why would I be interested in that thing? Kinda wish they'd take the Drones from the retiring ExoForce theme and do them in green, they'd make nice alien robot things...	positive

BerndDasBrot, on Mar 21 2008, 07:07 AM, said: Hi! This is my forth (old-school) technic set review! Since blakbird pointed out that all my technic reviews are red, I chose a yellow dune blaster for today! This is my second 8829 and I also noticed that the engine turns very hard. The alternate model is really (sorry to all those of you who like it) crappy. I mean- a nice idea, but not with this wheels! :-| Anyway: a really beautiful Technic-set! *reminiscing* (this word exists, does it?) thanks for viewing the pictures, I hope you enjoyed it! Please comment if you want to! A great set review, as always. Nice try making a review of a set that was not red. It almost worked! Maybe next time. *sweet* One thing I noticed is that a bunch of your pictures are missing the beam that goes over the left hand wheel as a fender. Like this picture: What kind of camera do you use? The pictures have very good depth of field, meaning that both the foreground and the background are in good focus. This is usually hard to do without a very small aperture. Yes, "reminiscing" is a word. It means to fondly remember the past. I also noticed that the engine was sticky. Set 8408 has the same problem. It took me forever to figure out what the problem was. If you take the engine out of the model, it turns nice and smooth. Then when you put it back in, it works terrible. It turns out the key is that, in the back, there is an 8 tooth spur gear and a 24 tooth crown gear used as a spur. If you look at Technica, you will see that there are two different crown gears. One of them works well mated with an 8 tooth on parallel axles, and the other one doesn't. The difference is only supposed to be longer teeth, so it really should not matter, but it does. If your set works bad, try switching the crown gear to one of the other variety. Worked for me. Eric	positive
Toa_Of_Justice, on Mar 21 2008, 08:10 AM, said: That looks like a very nice set! :-) In your opinion, how does it compare to the current Dune Buggy? -Toa Of Justice IMHO, 8829 is much better than 8296. First, 8829 is a lot bigger. I really like the huge rear balloon tires. They both have rack and pinion steering, and they both have trailing arm rear suspension with a V-2 engine. I think the body on 8829 is a little more well done. For 8296, I think the alternate tractor model is much better. For more comparisons, see Technicopedia. Eric	positive

Finally, after a very frustrating incident with the Internet Explorer 7's 'Back' button, I present to you my very first review. This is a review of set 8158 Speed Racer Vs Snake Oiler, it's also the first review of a Speed Racer set on EuroBricks. Also you should know that I didn't put the stickers on as they can be quite valuable later on down the road, so I'm sorry for the lack of stickers. :-$ So without further ado I present to you my first review. He He, that rhymes. :-D EDIT: I just finished resizing the pics and uploading them to BrickShelf after having a heated argument about when my bedtime is with my mother. So, I will be doing a complete redo of the picture portion of my review of set 8158. I'm going to work on that as soon as I finish typing this message... EDIT 2: Review fully redone now, *sighs*, that took forever. EDIT 3: Almost forgot to put in a new link to its BrickShelf folder. This is V.2 of my review of set 8158, enjoy...

It's only downfalls are that there are way too many stickers, 32 to be exact, :-| and there are no cool contraptions on the cars to take out the other racer. A great buy for $19.99, I reccomend this set to everybody because of the reasons I staed above and because even I, who is not a big fan of Speed Racer, X-O was drawn to this spectacular little set. Price: 10/10 Pieces: 8/10 Too many stickers. Minifigs: 9/10 Needed some accessories. Playability: 8/10 Needs some cool contraptions on the cars to take out the other racer.

Yay, finally! Thanks for the great review. It confirmed that I am most definately getting these *wub* The orange racer is absolutley beautiful! Once again, awesome review! *sweet*	positive

Thanks for resizing the pics. It is strange that you didn't know about that Z-piece before. It was well used in old space sets. The cars are pretty nice, but I think the people sit way too high in them - the windscreen gives almost no protection. I am planning on modifying them to 7 studs wide since that's my current standard for this kind of race cars (Seriously!). Looking forward to the next review.	neutral

Hi! This is my forth pre-old-school review. As promised: a yellow-set ! My 8862 arrived today, survived the washing machine coaster and actually was real fun to build! #1: information: This set contains 664 parts (only! I thought I’d be far more!) and was released in 1989 in the TECHNIC theme. Be sure to visit Technopediaif you want to know more! #2: building instructions: Wow these instructions are used! I'm not used to this after all this sets with unread instruction booklets... The pneumatics page: The last step for the alternate model: #3: the parts: Wow! Look at all those technic beams, gears, pins...! (A few parts are missing in this photo!) #3: building: The left worm gear is for the outriggers, the right one for turning the “rear boom” The three 12L Axles: left one: outriggers, middle one: steering, right one: erm… rear-boom-rotation. The two worm gears in the front part: left one: lifting the bucket, right one: dumping the bucket. The turning-mechanism for the “rear-boom” is finished. Once again a toothed 10L axle. The Boat Weight 2x6x2 is hidden underneath the radiator grill. Okay… many hoses and a nice, comfy seat have been added. Now you can recognize the Backhoes real shape. Only with a little violence it’s possible to lift the bonnet (?) through the Pneumatic Pump. Yeah, outriggers. Same technique that the 8854 uses. The finished “boom / jib / scoop thing” (=BJST) :-| X-D The finished loader bucket. And to end the building process: the same picture from the introduction. (OFF-TOPIC: “It is all part of the miracle of nature! - The circle of life!” #4: functionality: This time, I tried something new! I hope you can spot something - if not: Technopedia! Okay, here we go. #5: random shots: I’ve got way too many pictures this time, so I refer to my brickshelf folder. Until it’s moderated you can follow the multilingual links! eins deux three quattro fem zes sédem osiem #6: final thoughts: Definitely worth buying! As a child I thought it looks hideous - but today I’ve found out it’s totally fun to build and freaking functional. Three things I want to mention though: The BJST can only be slewed (a new word!) if the outriggers are deployed. It is also possible that the BJST will reach the ground (danger of grinding or sticking) even if the outriggers are deployed. The two mechanisms for the loader bucket can actually interlock, and the 14 tooth gears might break / disentangle from the axle. thanks for viewing the pictures, I hope you enjoyed it! Please comment if you want to!	neutral
Ah, what a very fine classic set.... and all these lovely Technic beams with studs! *wub* Thank you very much for that excellent review, Bernd, and you did a fantastic job with all these great pictures! :'-) *y*	positive
Thanks for the review. It looks beautiful. My father was a backhoe driver, so understandably I used to drool over this set in the catalogs. I never did get it though as Lego was so expensive in Australia then; I had around 2000 pieces and I thought I had loads! :-D Anyway, last year I bought 8455, which I love; it works great with a compressor I made too! *sweet* I wish mine had a real cab though... :'-( Do you have 8455 as well? I'd love to see how they compare side by side... It looks bigger than 8455 but I don't own any of the big old chuncky tires so I find it so hard to tell. By the way, I have been reading all of your reviews but I have been a bit busy of late so I haven't had time to comment. I hope you have more planned; any chance of a supercar one?	positive
Another nice review. The slow shutter speed pictures are great. I think that was the only set with 8 distinct functions for a very long time and was only displaced by the 8455 Backhoe in that respect. The turntable on the back doesn't turn very well though, as the weight is all distributed on one side. The screw axle prevents it from popping off but there is still a lot of friction in it. I don't have mine built anymore but it might be worth trying to put a weight brick or something on it. Quote Do you have 8455 as well? I'd love to see how they compare side by side... It looks bigger than 8455 but I don't own any of the big old chuncky tires so I find it so hard to tell. Yeah, it's quite a bit bigger. When everything is fully extended, it becomes something like 26" long. Although the 8455 actually has more/better functionality. Edited by CP5670, 24 March 2008 - 08:15 AM.	positive
Thanks for your feedback! I like both, but I would say 8455 is far more than just a studless version! with 10 pneumatic cylinders and 2 pneumatic pumps it's a wonderful set for every pneumatic freak. Unfortunately I don't own the 8455 - YET. ;-) Sinner said: I hope you have more planned; any chance of a supercar one? I foreshadowed a black review a few days ago... guess which one... X-O X-D	positive
A great review for a great set! It even had the old technic T-pieces and bevels, which I actually prefer to their modern counterparts.

The screw axle prevents it from popping off but there is still a lot of friction in it. I got mine for £20 in a second hand shop; it said complete, but one of the screw knuts was missing! X-O So it's practically impossible to keep the back arm on with only one |-/ And they're rather rare on BL too |-/	positive
yeah, I meant they're rare. ;-) but I can imagine that a normal axle with the old half bushes will help. Sometimes these are really strong; if you put 2-3 in a row? EDIT: I just tried it: a normal 10L axle with 2 interlocking old half bushes type 1 on each end. (I chose those who only can be moved very hardly along an axle.) I slewed the BJST / back arm a few times tried the pneumatics parallel to it and it didn't loose. Edited by BerndDasBrot, 24 March 2008 - 06:06 PM.	neutral

BerndDasBrot, on Mar 24 2008, 05:39 PM, said: could you explain your thoughts please? You know: my english skills ;-) I was thinking you could somehow attach a 16-tooth dark gray gear (the one that spins freely around axles) to the nut, which would make the axle move in and out when the gear turned and convert the gear's rotary motion to linear motion in a fairly compact package. Although there are other ways of doing the same thing that don't use such rare parts, and the 2008 Technic sets will come with pre-built linear actuators anyway.	neutral
BerndDasBrot, on Mar 25 2008, 03:46 AM, said: 15 seconds. Wow, that's a long exposure. I would think you would get way too much light and overexpose the image. The aperture must have been tiny. Quote I will review it too and post it in this topic! Cool. I am also planning to write about the combine on Technicopedia. Combine Quote actually I took it from your site! X-D I thought that word sounded familiar! Quote unfortunately I don't own 8480 but I think 8824 is also a very good (though small) white set! 8462 rocks as a blue set. I just got it a few weeks ago. Let's see... 8462 also is one of the last TECHNIC sets I would call Old-school. 8479... okay too, but 8458 is IMHO not. 8868 and the totally mysteriously black set will follow...! You don't own 8480? That is unacceptable. It is imperative that you put a mortgage on your house immediately to get it! *sweet* Yes, 8824 is a good white set. I also see from your room photos that you have the 8839 Supply Ship which has lots of white. This is a really nice set. 8462 is hard to call old school, but at least it uses regular beams. The air tanks are the best part of the set. I wish LEGO had used them more often, especially on the highly pneumatic sets. The tank makes all the difference on 8459. You are right, 8458 is certainly not old school, but it is a great set with wonderful suspension. It is of the same era as the Super Street Sensation with all of the panels for body contouring. 8868 is Technic at its best. There is nothing else like it, especially with the compressor. Quote Did you had something like this in mind if the toothed 10L axle rotates the axle nuts want to rotate too but they can't because of that 2x4 Technic Plate. So they'll decide to move along the axle. The 1x6 Bricks on each end make sure that the axle won't move in or out. Thanks for your feedback! While the assembly you have drawn would work as a linear actuator, I would not recommend it. The torsional stiffness and strength of an axle are proportional to the polar moment of inertia, a section property. Most of the stiffness comes from the outside of the cross shaped axle. But in the threaded axle, you lose all the stiffness of the outer area because it is not continuous. This means you only get stiffness and strength from the small core. I think the threaded axle would bend and break very easily if subjected to much torque. Eric	neutral
I'm very sorry for that doublepost... I made a picture for you, sinner, but forgot to upload it: Your dad, Patrick Parrot, driving a giant backhoe. Sadly his second job as Photojournalist and the fact that Bianca Lamb was strolling by, distracted him. as a consequence he spoiled the whole construction site bringing death and doom with a Technic Backhoe to Fabuland. And a little Walrus baby. *y* :-P	neutral
Thanks for another classic review! Man, I wish I had this set. The shovels should have been black though.	positive
A great review. I only have new sets, so looking at old ones like this is great. I would suggest multiple pictures blended together afterwards, instead of the long exposure pictures.

Some time ago I sort of complained about the fact that there was not much Technic represented in the Eurobricks community (this was the topic, if someone is interested). I am glad to see someone took that complaint serious and started reviewing technic sets on large scale to show us how fascinating the theme really is! This review is once again an excellent one, I really enjoyed reading it. I must buy this set sometime soon because I always liked the three-way pneumatic system it came with and the overall look of the machine. For many years it seemed out of reach, much to expensive and hard to come by as a kid. Now as an adult there are many ways to acquire this wonderful set. Keep on reviewing! *y*	positive
This is a review of Speed Racer set 8159 Raxer X Vs Taejo. This is my second review and the first review of this paticular set and the only one on EuroBricks... at the moment X-D So without further ado I present to you my review... (I like that saying so much I decided to use it again in this review, it's originally from my review of 8158, which can be seen here.) Note: Sorry that this review got delayed, but there was a hostile takeover of the computer, X-O don't worry everythings fine now. X-D Set: 8159 Racer X Vs Taejo Theme: Speed Racer Price: $19.99US Pieces: 237 Minifigs: 2 Note 2: I did not take photos of just the new pieces this time because they're the same "new" pieces as in 8158, just in diff. colors. If you want to see a picture of them click here. First off pictures of the Box, Instructions, DSS, and Minifigs: Not quite as many stickers as set 8158, but there still are quite a few. Can you guess which ones which? :-D Yes, Taejo's hair really is Red and Black, for Racer X's head TLG just reused the baddie's head from 7620. |-/ Now onto the build: First Racer X's X Racer :-D (Thats not it's official name.. I think.) :-$ Back end of the car. The cockpit, and yeah there are no seats for Racer X's hiny, just a flat 2x2 Dark Bley plate. The cockpit and rearend of the car connect using an S-shaped connector piece. The front part of the car. The fornt and the cockpit are also connected using an S-shaped connector piece. Adding some details including Yellow fenders. The underside of the car, so far. Adding some more detail. Newly added motor vents and smooth details. Adding a front bumper, amongst other things. Side view of the car, so far. "No backseat driving, wait a minute, there's no backseat!" The underside with newly added axles. Demonstrating how hubcap piece is put on the car. Now onto Taejo's GRR (Glorious Red Racer) :-P Front part of the car. Cockpit, regular seats... check. Cocpit and rearend of the car connected using S-shaped connector piece. Adding some detail. The front part of the car. Front and cockpit connected also using the S-shaped connector piece. Adding some fenders to the car. Underside of the car, so far. Adding some smooth details. Taejos is the only car with an actual hood. Side view of the car, so far. Underside of the car with axels. Now some finished shots of both cars: First Racer X's fine Black and Yellow racer Reminds me of an older Ferrari from this angle. Up close and personal. I'm guessing the 3 holes are exhaust outlets. Racer X rollin'. Now it's time for Taejo's Red racer "I could've sworn I ordered some hubcaps!" -guess who... Taejo Racer X admiring Taejo's fine red automobile. Up close with 'Big Red'. Rearend shot of the car. "I challenge you Racer X!" -Taejo Racer X bein' a complete badass and smokin' Taejo. >:-) Now for some comparison shots: (The Silver pocket knife is just to hold up Taejo's car.) Now a shot of the extra pieces: Now if you combine 8158 with 8159, you get this: "Go, Go, Go!" Now it's time for the summary: This set is an excellent buy at $20 dollars, it's well designed and has lot's of details, it also has very unique minifigs. (Which are always good in a set.) It's only downfalls are the lack of acessories for the minifigs and that there are no cool contraptions on the cars, and by "cool" I mean lethal to the other racer(s). Now to the scoring of the set: Price:10/10 Pieces: 8/10 Too many stickers for such a small set. Minifigs: 10/10 Unique and creative. Playability: 9/10 Would have been perfect except for the lack of acessories and cool contraptions on the cars. (But both are easily modified/fixed hence the nine.) Overall: 37/40 A great set! Bonus: Try and count how many times my Silver pocket knife appears and win... the knowledge of knowing how many times the Silver pocket knife appears. :-P :-D This concludes the review, more pictures of either set 8158 or 8159 or both available through request, via PM-ing me. ;-) See ya' next time folks... of course I don't mean that literally X-D ...

Thanks for the review, mate. I may get this as well, so I can get Racer X. Axctually, I see what TLC's done here, splitting up the two more well-known characters, Speed and Racer X, so you have to get both sets.

I'd have to agree with you with regards the helmet. I would've preferred this, especially for Speed. Interestingly, my pocket knife is the same as that one. I didn't count its appearances though.	neutral
Speaking of pocket knives, I just got Speed Racer and Snake Oiler at K-Mart and might mod the helmet so it actually looks like the cartoon. The problem is - I don't want to shell out two bucks for a clear visor! >:-( By the way, I know trans-clear visors are non-production, but where did they come from? a pick-a-brick? if so, what store? Well at least if I do go through getting the elusive clear visor, it's not as bad as the insane $25+ red vader helmet! This set is great. I would have gotten this along with the one I purchased, but I didn't have enough dough with me to get both.	positive
Crap, now I want these sets!! Great review!	positive
Very good review! These sets are a lot better than I expected, and for $20, I might have to pick up both! My family and I are going to Orlando this summer, hopefully I'll pick these and some other sets up at the Lego Store in Downtown Disney. :-D	positive
Thanks for this review, it's a nice set with some cool pieces and nice techniques, I like the way the roof pieces are used to make the spiders back, for instance Lasse D, on Mar 26 2008, 09:48 PM, said: Alternate models: 3 It is hard to come up with alternate models with so many small pieces and plates that are only 1 stud wide.

thank you for review very good army builder i see	positive
Excellent review! *y* Getting a better chance to look at this set actually makes me interested in it. I was in my dark ages throughout the Islander days, though I have built up a small force of them (10?) from eBay buys, but no actual sets. If this is really as reasonable as you say there, I may just have to pick one up soon. Oddly, I do own the baseplates to this set, having also picked them up in a lot on eBay, so I might be able to recreate it manually, but I think I'd rather pick one up whole. It looks like a great mix of parts and makes a decent looking display piece. Thanks again for the fine review! *y*	positive
A great and informative review with very fine pictures, thanks SlyOwl! *sweet* A wonderful set this is indeed, full of nice details and pretty playable, and a cool subtheme that offers a lot of fantasy and charming characters in a marvelous layout. I really love that little boat with the outrigger, and the neat buildings and sweet landscaping works together very well. TLC got sued for using some names of native sounding origin? Now that sounds really strange to me.... such names´re widely spread within novels, movies and such stuff, I didn´t know that there´s some kind of copyright on them.... 8-|	positive
Good review, mr. SlyOwl! And good pics too! I know it probably deserves better but I only give him a 3. I'll be surely the only saying that I don't like this set but I remember I had it for christmas when I was a child and it disappointed me very much because I expected it much larger after seeing it in the LEGO catalogs. Well it's just a little trauma I had :-P LOL Anyway I must admit it's an interesant set, specially because of the large number of mini-figures and accesories it brings with and the two little "ships" Edited by BlueBard, 31 March 2008 - 01:13 AM.	positive
Excellent review of an outstanding set! I love the main image. I want this set so bad!	positive
It's a great set and one I have yet to add to my collection despite my large number of Islander extras. Enchanted Island, aside from having so alluring a name was good value for money in that you only needed this one set and you had a good representation of the islanders both in the size of the set and the number of minifigs. The flipping rope bridge and the river give it a great rainforest retreat sort of feeling and one is inclined to think of this set as more inland than directly coastal for me. Whilst the Islanders were never seen in the same light or popularity as Pirates and Imperials they were an obvious and colourful addition that to me added a whole new depth to the Pirate system and one was now able to play a 3 or 4 way war adding a greater political element to the sets. Enchanted Island is probably the 3rd most appealing of the large land bases for me after Port Royal and Eldorado Fortress. Good review and glad to see the set recognised!	positive
SlyOwl, you're a legend! Thank you for taking the time to do such a comprehensive review. You've captured Enchanted Island in impeccable detail and anyone who doesn't own this set should know it inside-out by now. I shall write my thoughts on the set itself, directly.	positive
For some reason I never considered buying this set. But your review changed that. I'll try to get it on eBay. Thanks for your efforts to make this wonderful review for us. It's now added to our index.	positive
Great review! I think this set looks great. I really like the islanders and that statue is really nice. It comes with a lot of nice leaves and I like all of the secret compartments and the like. Thanks for the nice review!	positive
Thanks for the review! I am getting very interested in the classic pirates sets, and I wat some now. This seems like it would be a great starter.	positive
I was just going into my dark ages when LEGO began the Islander themes, so I've never really cared for them. BUT this review actually made me want this set real bad. I guess this is what reviews are for then - good job on the review	positive
Great review! I recently got this set for only 150 SEK, around $17, and it´s really good!	positive
Everytime I saw this at a toy store I always cried to my parents for one, but never got it, I got the smaller islander sets, but the more I see this now, I don't want it, I could buy it, but naahh, I am hoping Lego does an updated version of the islanders with this new pirates line, one can hope right!! XD	neutral
What an amazing (old) set! I loved Pirates in my childhood, but that was before the Islander and Spanish stuff... mine were the BSB and soldier fortress with the big baseplate. As I'm now returning to Pirates, I've tracked down most of the 2009 sets and of course bought the new 2015 sets... but knowing I missed this "middle" period of Islanders vs Pirates makes me a bit sad... those Islanders are soooo "Monkey Island" (those of my age likely feel the same) to my eyes! Oh for a "Lemonhead" minfig... ;) I'm curious now how much this set sells for, given it was apparently one of very few Lego actually re-released! I recently bought a MISB BSB that was an early 2000's re-release, and it was very pricey... but then, I suspect the BSB has a LOT more of a nostalgic following these days than this set! Can anyone give me a rough idea what this set goes for in as-new condition these days? Regardless, a fantastic review with some great photos of the whole set and minifigs... even though this is an old thread, I am glad someone else bumped it recently so I can add my thoughts too. :) One thing I've noticed comparing the newest Pirates sets to the 80's ones I had as a kid (and these from the 90's) is the move away from baseplates and big "panel" pieces. I actually like that in a lot of ways; whilst I miss baseplates being included as they are a great starting point for creating new things (and make the sets easier to "play" with), visually, I think Lego-designed model sets look better without them.	positive

I will most likely get all the speed racer sets as it was one of my favorite movies(the animated one) i just loved the decked up and tricked out cars >:-) great review and red tux = X-D	positive
Looks like a great ole set to me. The cars seem abit overly slopey to me though, I'll probably pass on this. But as a note, I especially like the black and yellow car's horizontal wheel covering things. Nice :-$	positive
Thank you for the pics *y* I want a Trixie impulse set *wub* And otherwise that little boy with his monkey. I like the print on his t shirt.	positive
Sorry to bump such an old thread, but I´ve just discovered this set is on sale at Amazon.de - for a mere 25 Euros. I am tempted. Not because I like the set or the models, but because of the parts. As most of you might know, I´m especially into Exo-Force. So would you recommend to get this set just for the parts? Are they a good choice to combine with EF-sets? Would anyone of you be interested in obtaining the fleshie-parts of the minifigs from me, as I totally don´t need those?	neutral
I picked up this set a few weeks ago (along with the smaller sets that come with the Mach 5 and Racer X's car), and I was pleasantly surprised. The commentator's stand is nothing to write home about, but the assortment of figs is great (numerous new face prints in flesh, I believe), and in spite of the large amount of stickers, the three cars are each unique and very well-designed. My only gripe about them is that Cannonball Taylor's car (the black and yellow one) was a missed opportunity, as in the movie it's yellow and purple. I know TLC is dropping purple for the future and had a bunch of problems with it in the past, but it would have made for a great looking car IMO.	positive
An opportunity has come up to buy this set for 100 AUD. Just wondering whether people think it's worth buying? I've heard very little about the speed racer Legos	neutral

Hi! I've promised a lot lately. I'll review 8868, 8880, Space Police II, Blacktron II... And I WILL. It's just the time that is blocking me. And my university. And the fact that I just picked up 8460 in original box for only EUR 36,50...! *sweet* The other reviews will follow - please bear with me. And this set review is also a gift to this nice fellow who gave me the title! That's what I'm talking about: #1 useless information with high numbers: This set contains 841 parts and was released in 1995 in the TECHNIC / Tech Build / Advanced (sub-) theme. The bricklink price guide displays for “Used” a Qty Avg Price of $125.85 and for “New” a Qty Avg Price of $212.82. I got it for $56,98. Still can’t believe it. :'-) This set was rereleased two times (8431 in 2002 and 8438 in 2003). #2 the box: Front: Back: Open: The box is higher than other Technic boxes. Why? I don’t know. 8460 doesn’t have any real large parts. Whatever. Inlay: I wonder why TLG doesn’t make inlays anymore… They’re noisy and brake easily but are great for (pre-) sorting. #3 building instructions: I will quote myself from the 8862 review: Quote Wow these instructions are used! I'm not used to this after all this sets with unread instruction booklets... Triple-wow! ‘nuff said. This is the “first” page. (Fortunately Peeron offers scans!) The last step for the alternate model and a few nice photos showing how the pneumatic pump will be erm- pumped. Yeah. Random page: I forgot the overall thoughts to the instructions: These are Technic instructions as we’re used to them: part count, easy to understand (okay, the string part at the end was too much for me) and the color distinction is okay too. 100 pages long and if I can trust my eyes the pneumatics page can be fold out. (I don’t have this page but I assume it.) #4 the parts: #5 building: An easy and fun build. Okay, this could take some time. My longest building review up to date. The front steering: The rear steering. The axle pin between the rear steering is for the axle which rotates the crane. The two worm screws in the front are for the outriggers (they’re not linked. One for each side.) The small wheel in the back is for the rotation. Adjusting front and rear steering. outriggers are finished. You can notice a 8 tooth gear that will rotate the Technic Turntable. A steering wheel has been added. Could be the same stickers like the alternate 8880 used to have. The steering can be operated with both actinic lights (?) No. We’re far from finished. I’ve got a lot of parts left at this point. Wow. A 4x4 corner plate! Pneumatics and a winch: If you can’t recognize it on the photo: The Technic Beams are the erm- wrong/other side up. The 1x6 Technic Beams on the left side are normal. The axle that will extend the crane: 7 gear racks 1x4 the 1x6 Technic plate will keep the two pneumatic cylinders straight. *sad* 8-| Huh? Did you blink? You missed a special part: The whole rotatable thing will be attached to the Technic turntable using two long Technic pins. The pin on the right side should be in the middle of the three “turntable holes”. On the right side, it’s the first hole. Asymmetric! Why? Because we’ll add a cute cab! #6 functionality: You can find the features in comparison to other Technic cranes here. Technopedia, of course. I made one "sentence" out of it: (please don’t find any mistakes.) :-P “two axle rack and pinion steering, pneumatic luffing and gear driven telescoping via crank for the boom which can slew 360° on turntable driven via gear, crank driven hoist and gear driven outriggers at four corners which snap over center.” #7 random shots: Comparison to 8854: uuuh… once again a depth of field. I tried to make it look authoritarian like 8858 but I failed. Somehow 8460 looks cute. #8 comparison to 8421 Mobile Crane / Crane Truck: I feel that a question concerning this will be asked, so I deal with it right now. First of all: I don’t own 8421 yet. I know. A Technic freak really should own it. Anyway: 8421 has more than twice as much parts as 8460, is motorized, features a V6-engine and a very neat mechanism to extend the crane/boom twice using a braided string with end studs. Try to find out how! Of course 8421 features (far) more than 8460. IMHO 8421 should have been a copy of 8460, a set so successful that it has been rereleased two times, but the designers overshoot the mark. 8421 is a (breathtaking) monster. Compared to it, 8460 looks cute - not pale! #9 final thoughts: I got it on eBay in kind of good condition, for about 50 dollars. I know that it has been worth the money in any point of view. *wub* I didn’t use the word “old-school” for now. I’ll change that: 8460 belongs to the favored few of old-school Technic sets! thanks for reading and viewing the pictures, I hope you enjoyed it! Please comment if you want to!	positive
Ah, thanks sommuch again for that great review! *y* *sweet* Man, I am so happy they made this set. The new one seems too boring. ;-)	positive
Somehow I competely missed your review when you first made it, I saw your pics on brickshelf and wondered about the review... You have managed to review my all time favourite technic set! It was the first large Technic set I was given by my parents, when it first came out in 1995. I played for hours with this set, making minifig seats in it (it was so huge there was room for four minifigs to sit next to eachother in front....) I made various applications for it, a bungee-jump system with a large rubber band, and lots of containers to be lifted. The first changes I made included the inverting of the wheels and the disabling of one of the flashlight-steering wheels because they obstructed eachother. By the way, the nob for your winch is yellow instead of black (I know this set by heart, so watch out :-P ). I always liked those nobs. I do own the 8421 and I can tell you: this 8460 is much, much stronger, it can carry more weight because the boom is lighter then the 8421: they are powered by the same two pistons... You know when you made it right: when the crane is in upright position, fully extended and you release the brake from the winch. Does the hook lower without having to pull it? If it does, you succeeded in constructing the set right. The alternate model was great fun too, the pump is cleverly hidden and the crane folds up great between the cab and the loading platform. You could easily mod it with a pneumatic claw on the crane, a motor to turn it and a compressor. The only flaw was the loading platform which had no floor (only some axles). Thanks so much for reviving my memorie concerning this great set! *y*	positive
A great review, thank you. I do not know these old sets like this one, but it is very cool to see how they were made. I have an un-opened 8421, maybe I should do a small review of that when I get to build it. btw. boxes are expensive, so at a given price point, it's a choise between more bricks or nicer boxes. I have no doubt what most people would chose. Front Edited by Front, 06 April 2008 - 10:21 PM.	positive

Great review! While I admit I wasn't into Technic at the time this came out (I was a mere child, give me a break! :-D), I can see now why it was featured so much. From the booklets to display stands at toy stores and at my local LEGO center (when it was still around), this thing was everywhere! With your review, I can now truly appreciate all the details of the set. I got to admit, I can see the appeal now! That comparison shot you took is amazing. I love not only just how it included the little details such as the stabilizers, but also looks incredibly fun to play around with. Great set and an even greater review!	positive
thanks guys! @ sinner: i hope you refered to 8285 so my answer will match: 8285 is interesting: main model: american styled truck, alternate model: european styled truck. I don't think TLG produced many european styled truck. EDIT: I just found a wonderful MOC-alternate on brickshelf: 8436 by industrialdesigner. If I got him right, he designed a few offical technic sets for TLG. @ all: promises, promises, promises... hm. and again it's eBay that's blocking me. I want to foreshadow my next review (although it'll take some time to make it): I know, you know. But please act inconspicuous until you'll can act very astonished...!

Set ref: 7624 Name: Jungle Duel Number of minifigs: 3 Number of pieces: 78 Price: 11,90€ It’s the smaller set from the last Indy movie, “the kingdom of the crystal skull”. Here we go! A general view of the set: We have a tent, some food ( a chicken leg is always welcome!), a fireplace, the things with all the swords, a bench with a broken table, 3 ants, a map (printed tile) and other accessories. Don’t make that girl hungry or... YYYYAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! Ho no! Our diner, a giant ant, has gone away! Those giant ants are made in a smooth plastic, in dark red and trans black colour: And here a closer view on the two new hairpieces: The new girl hairpiece is really cute, and I’m a bit disappointed by the new man hairpiece…Those hair lake some volume… But I’m really happy to see that TLC has made some new moulds for hairpieces! It’s the good part of the theatre lines! So, it’s a really interesting set because you’ve got a lot of useful pieces for a city Mocers, with the two new hairpieces without spending a lot of money!

Actually they are ants. Spiders have 8 legs while ants have only 6 like these. The two thing that look like legs in the front are the antennae.

Can't wait to get this one (ANTS!!!) I don't have a tent either, so that'll be a great pickup. I'm surprised, though, that it includes the gold Exo-Force sword. I didn't expect this to come in any other sets besides the tower. <Faramir-<	positive

Thanks for this great review, Alex, this is most definately (well, in my opinion anyway) the best set. Lets face it, in motorcycle chase you really only got 2 bikes and 2 crates as the big parts of the set. In this one, which is the same price, you get those ants, a neat tent (Hurray!), a [b]printed[/i] map, a chicken leg, a Castle sword, EF sword, and Pirates sword, a dagger (now in light bley) and a silver frying pan. This set is packed with useful pieces, I'm definately getting this one. And I for one love Mutt's hair piece. I sense my sig-fig will soon have a new hair style.

OK! I think, it''s a no-brainer that this is a must-have for pretty much anyone who likes LEGO! It's cheap and a great minifigs & parts pack! I'll be getting at least 1 of these! Here is what I like about it: 1. Great minifigs with nice torsos, sweet faces, and awesome hair! (Gotta ask 'em where they get it done! ) 2. Golden katana! 3. Chicken leg! YUM! 4. Nice campfire! And this is what I don't like about it: 1. Dark bley knife! Seriously, they could have at least made it silver like the sword, if not chrome! 2. Rehashed tent. 3. Spiders with 6 legs!!! I actually don't really care about the tent and the multi-legged creatures. Those go straight into the sorting boxes. Perhaps I might use the tent someday for a steampunk MOC of some kind, or a stop-motion film, or maybe some kind of contest... Anyway, what's up with that thing that holds the katana, the sword, and the saber? It's in the airplane set too! Is it perhaps one of the treasures of the new movie or is it something Indy takes with him everywhere in this film? 44However, nice pics, nice review! Thanks, dude!

Mhm...I really need this set! There are various things I’m interested in: the minifigs (hey, I still have no Indiana Jones figs!), the new hairpieces, a gold katana, a dark bley pirate cutlass (is this the first one?), a dark bley knife (could be useful..), those giant ants, yet another silver broad sword (you never have enough of those).....great parts pack indeed.

I simply that tent! I guess I´ll have to buy three of these just to make a proper expedition MOC somewhen.... A great little set indeed, with marvelous new MF torsos and that new black feminine hairpiece´s also great and very useable for creating some characters related to the sixties and seventies. And finally a pan that´s not black and a knife in grey. That´s very handy indeed, the chrome one always looked a bit too shiny to me.... Thanks for that sweet review, alex!	positive

Great review Alex After seeing these pics i'm really looking forward to getting this set, i really like how lego has designed the gas tank that's just so good.

Merci Beaucoup for the great review Alex !! Where did you get the sets ? That set is called River Chase This is a great set !! I love the amphibious vehicle with all the darj green part !! I agree with you that the the dark green croc is fantastic !! I'm also happy to have a dark bley Zodiac and a new Marion Torso. That "tree hut" is a fun feature where the playability doesn't screw the design !! I really love the commies !! Its fun how Lego reuses those fleshie heads and I really don't mind at all. So its evil for evil since one of the commie has the zazi face I also love the ptrol cans !! ingenious !! I still have rants on that set: * Why oh why another similar Indy !! Arghhh I can't stand it !! * Why oh why the same Marion head !! Can't wait to have those sets !!	positive
good	positive
A very fine review of a really great set, thanks alex! This set has everything, a croc, very nice MFs, a neat tree trap, a cool zodiac and a marvelous and very detailed amphibious car in a beautiful color scheme. The only thing I´m not colpletely sure is the design of that jerrycan (thanks for the right word and the interesting link, Kingboy ). Although the use of the revolver´s pretty clever indeed and fits well too, it´s still clearly, well, a revolver.... very unusual and interesting for an official TLC design.	positive
Just like 7626 this is a must buy in my opinion. I just the amphibious vehicle,very nice for army building.	positive

Set ref: 7626 Name: Jungle Cutter Number of minifigs: 4 Number of pieces: unknown Price: 39,99€ A general view of the set: We’ve got 5 giant ants, two Russian soldiers, a General, Indy of course, 3 trees, a small entrance of a cave, and the debroussaillor vehicle (I don’t know the English name of it…). You can’t enter into the cave, because there is a spider web with its spider…Unless… Unless you know how the mechanism works and the spider web go up… And reveals a case with diamonds and accessories. A closer view on the mechanism (which is simple but works well), and you can also see the difference, or maybe the same, size of a spider and a giant ant! And I’ve always thought that those spiders were very big compared to the minifigs! So those ants are really giant! Poor small frog! The three trees with the entrance make a nice jungle layout! Don’t speak too loud, you will wake up the soldier… Don’t worry for him, he will be waken up by the vehicle before being eaten by those giant ants! A front view, making the vehicle really menacing! A back view: Push the red part from the back and there are two parts that fall down from the vehicle. I don’t know why… The movie will clarify this I think… And here you can see how the two big circular blades turn when you push the vehicle… Simple but effective! Run Indy, run! This set is really nice. The playability of the different elements is great, the colour scheme is nice too (I like those dark green tree parts!). The vehicle is really impressive without being too big and its very well details! In general the designers of the Indy sets have made a really nice works, with a lot of efforts in all those details everywhere! I’ve got some project for this set, to integrate it in my city... I’m a city mocer, and not an Indy fan. So I don’t have bought the temple, the bigger set of the series, because it has nothing special for me in term of part selections or in the design, in relation with the town theme, and because my supermarket doesn’t have it yet! So, we are waiting for a member to review it and make the part 4…	positive
Oh, man, thanks for the review! IMO, this looks like the best set in the new Indy line! Do you have any better pics of the Colonel?	positive
Excellent review Alex. Thanks for sharing. I can't wait to buy this set once available. I really like the dark green leaf pieces. I like the cave/temple which will look great in my Jungle Diorama. Blending the dark green and light green works well for the vehicle. Overall, a neat little set.	positive
Great review, thanks for that. I love almost everything about this set. The ants, commies, general (can we please get a shot of his face?), dark green, treads, foliage and other creatures. Great stuff, i'll have to get it on sale though. Batbrick Away!	positive
This is a great set!!!!!! It is probably my favourite Indy so so far! Great reveiw! Although the set is great the price is greater have to get it on sale..	positive
This one is my favorite from the bunch. Thanks for the time spent in making a review	positive
Great review, thanks a lot for all the pics. I agree that this is probably the nicest set of the Indy 4 wave. So much dark green and I love all the plant pieces. It's been ages since we've had enough pieces in a regular release to build nice forests so it's great to see 11 of the dark green leaves in one set and all the vines! The design of the cutter looks very solid and brick built as well. Giant ants are great looking too.	positive
A great, detailed review for an excellent set! I love the Jungle Cutter vehicle itself, and all the dark green! It's great to have the trees and cave entrance; you can never have enough extras! The figs are nice too; two Russian soldiers, the cool-looking general (I think his name is Dovchenko or something) and the repeated-but-still-nice Indy with RPG. Thanks again, looks like I'll be picking this up along with Jungle Duel. (By the way, I think this set is called Jungle Cutter).	positive
Wow those trees look so weak compared to those enormous blades. Anyway, a high-possibility-and-appeal-to-us-compulsive-LEGO-shoppers set, so, I'll try to get it, which means I'll obsesively look until i find. Deforestation of puny trees, ON!	neutral
Thanks for the review alex I agree that this is the best set of KotCS sets (although the airplane comes quite close..). Although I'm not too fond of the trees, the cave is good, and the jungle cutter is brilliant. Plenty of great features, and very detailed, with much of the engine showing and a decent cockpit (if that's the right word..). The general and the two Soviets are great too (could we have a close-up pic of them please? ), good to see that neither torso has exposed fleshy skin like the Nazis. As said though, it is quite a pricy set, I was expecting it to be just over the price of Race for the Stolen Treasure. Great set, thanks again, alex!	positive
Here some close-up pics of the Russian soldiers and the General : And I know that you have seen that I don't have put the stickers on...	neutral
Ahhhhh now this swamp vehicle looks great to me, when i first heard lego were making it i was worried that it would be a poor version. However im pleased to see that it's not, even though i'm not a great fan of those treads. The trees don't really add anything to the set which is a shame, still the parts are welcome at least. The entrance is good though it could do with being bigger, but i guess we can moc that. I really like the commie general, he looks like a real bad megablocks	positive
Great review again Alex !! Same question (in case you didn't se it in my reply to the other set): where did you get those new sets ?? I really love that set !! Its called Jungle Cutter The trees are really cool and make a great adition to it IMO. That temple entrance or monument is really cool !! Those Bionicle parts do make fantastic vegetation !! I totally forgot about that green frog !! Thats cool , those are so cute !! 5 more ants is great !! The vehicle look really sharp (ah ah ah). 2 more commies yeay !! That officer is really freaky actually !! Could have been a high rank under Pol Pot's regime in the S21... Yeay looks more asian than russian IMO Now its time for my grips: * same bloody rant about Indy !! * I haven't read the instructions before but once again there are so many parts in crap colours that need to be changed Look at all the crap red and yellow in there !! I will need to look for those parts before buying the set like I always do !! Mod while building On !! I am really soimpressed with that Indy line !! I sincerely hope it will have a long and healthy life !!	positive

I'm definitely changing them; they may be bearers of the Red Star but they don't need red lining inside their vehicles.	neutral
What a lovely set! I think I have to put this on my wishlist,just for that beautiful woodcutting tank thingie. 2008 is gonna get expensive for me	positive
the thing and the set is called jungle cutter and the reason the front pops off is because indy blows it up with a bazooka incase you wanted to know. thanks for the nice review	neutral
What a marvelous diversity of plant parts, very nice MFs and a cool and detailed harvester. That conventionalized cave with its neat opening feature´s also very well done. Thanks for that fine review of a pretty cool set, alex.	positive
This is the 3rd review, that i had read. It's very tempting to fly over and get those sets from there. Because, i may need to wait for some months before it arrived. It seemed we will have a new small little creature to add into the ranks. These "Red Ants" is cute and of course looks nasty too. Haha. I love those trees, foilage and plants very very much. It can be used for my MOC and is good for any "Green" project related expansion. I love it. About the vehicle, i find it abit wierd. It seemed too big in the set-up. Hehe, but still i love this set. Mainly, i will get it for the green parts	positive
Here's a review of the second largest set in the Dragon Masters subtheme for castle month, Dark Dragon's Den! Figs: The set comes with 3 Dragon knights, two of which have the dragon wings on their helmets(Sad thing is, one of my knights was missing the left wing on the helmet). There are also the definitive dragon, Wiz the wizard (or Majisto if you prefer)two horses, and a hawk( try to find him in each picture!) The set: there's a large spot under the mountain for the dragon to guard the treasure chest. The chest has 2 red and green 1x1 circles in it. Another gate in the back, along with a door for knights. The right side of the mountain has a ladder and a removable rock face. The left side has some stairs leading up to the top. I love this tree design. simple yet effective. A shot of the top- Hey, what are you doing?!? NO!! Throw him in the dungeon! Overall: This set when first released in 1993 was priced at $43USD, although that might just be because of the Juniorised pieces (6 BURPs!). It's a fun set that provides excellent playability. If you can find it at a $20-$30 price point, pick it up. Overall grade: 8/10 Edited by KimT, 10 August 2008 - 01:33 PM.	positive
This is around the time that many consider the decline of castle, in which point I somewhat agree, but admittedly it still looks like a very playable set, and the tree is very well done. Thank you for the review!	positive
Agent Rick: You're definately the Dragon Master around these parts. What a great little set. I really like the classic dragon which reminds me of a similar style used for the Lego crocodiles. And the dungeon is pretty slick too. I like the use of the large gates plus the doors. Plus the set contains the blue wizard. Awesome! Great review.	positive
A very neat set with charming MFs and a great classic dragon, a good use of BURPs and a really nice tree indeed. Thanks for the review, AgentRick57!	positive
this was the last castle set i got before my dark age.. really liked it although the big rock parts looked really bad ( i am kind of used to them now) unfortunately i lost the little wand.. and i never understood who is "good" and who is "bad" does the wizard own the dragon? well they dont seem to be enemies but isnt the dragon supposed to be evil??	positive
The 8291 Dirt Bike comes from a long line of Technic bikes, and I think it's the best ever. It looks great, and it's fun to ride around in the house. I hoped to find a figure the right size for it, but none of mine would fit. Unlike a lot of Technic models, it looks good from all angles. Considering the size of the model it has a complicated way of connecting the engine to the wheel. The rear shocks are just the right stiffness... ...and they have a good amount of travel. I thought these shocks were new. I need to get out more... Functions: Shocks: Two front, one stiffer one in the rear. Drivetrain: 2 piston engine linked to the rear wheel via gears and a chainlink. Steering: Yes it does... Stand: Retractable. For the price, size and subject, what else could be added? 10/10 Parts: Considering that it has three shocks and a 40 chainlinks it's a great set for parts. Some hard to use large parts are included, but they are not overused. The usage of the green does limit part usage somewhat though, and I'll be struggling to find a use for those wheels for anything other than a motorbike. 8/10 Price: At $39.99 AUD for 248 parts it isn't the best value set. The US price is $25.00 which is somewhat better. It does have some more complicated parts however. 7/10 Looks: Lego seems to be moving away from the see-though look for Technic sets and this is a good example of it. I'm not a big fan of fairings but I think they work great in this set as a fuel tank. 8/10 Fudge: This set was great for me as I have never had a Technic bike. However for those that want this for just parts or have other bikes it could be a hard sell. The alternate model (a chopper) is a complete rebuild (which I didn't make), and it's great that Lego have been including these most of the time lately. 7/10 Overall: Recommended. 8/10	positive
I think the green motocross bike looks great. I like the use of fairings on this bike. The only thing I really don't like about the Technics bikes in general, is the "clumsy" design of the chaindrive. It sticks way to much out to the side. If they made a really big bike model, it would be more in place with this chain drive. I'm not sure if it wouldn't be possible to design a shaft drive to the rear wheel, ala BMW style. But the green "Kawasaki" look great with the front and rear suspension. I have the Street Bike, 8420, a somewhat larger and more complicated set, and will probably add the motocross bike to my collection soon. It would be great if Lego could make a line of bikes, like they do the Ferrari line. Front	positive
A very good review, thanks, Sinner. That´s really a pretty cool model, very detailed with useful parts too.... hmm, perhaps that one´s gonna get the first Technic set I´ll buy, beside that 4481 Hailfire Droid.... um, thank you, Sinner....	positive
Thanks for the Great review Sinner I like the Technic bikes I wonder how it would look if you replaced the gear on the back wheel with a smaller one?	neutral
I have just finished building this set. I was a bit disappointed with the amount of bricks when they were out on my table, but the final model is really nice and totally makes up for that. I like the small details like on the handles and fuel tank and the only real negative thing I can say is that the cog seems a bit oversized in the rear. I don't know if the designer frequents this forum, but I'm sure he will be happy about how much you like it - it took quite some time/prototypes to get to this design: (Sorry about the size of the picture - it isn't mine)	positive
Best review of a Lime Green Technic Dirt Bike ever! Really, it is. I just don't understand the allure of the bike very much. Where does the Fabuland fig go? Anyway, very insightful review. Thanks for taking the time and effort to review it for us. I'm not really interested in the set, but wanted to support my buddy since I know how much work you put into these.

How did I manage to miss this review? I must have overlooked it somehow... Thanks for making this one Sinner, it's always nice to see reviews of Technic sets. I'm not so sure whether I like this set, I am not that much into motorbikes, but Lego did a good job on this one. It looks a lot like an upgraded version of one of the first bikes Lego made, namely the 8838 Shock Cycle. I also believe the back gearwheel is somewhat oversized, it looks better with the smaller one you attached. It is good to see that Lego is back to making the Technic sets the way they were (except for the green, that is )	neutral

I wasn't very interested in this set at first. It seemed to be just a nice looking truck with a small motor... but when I found out it had a transmission I changed my mind! Here is the transmission. It allows the single motor to be used for two functions. This system has been around for a while, and Lego seem to be using it more and more. The Transmission Driving Ring alone (the red circle) goes for $5-15 USD on BrickLink, and you also need the Catch and Clutch Gear so I have been buying sets that have them instead. I now have enough parts to make a Supercar gearbox. (I bet a new supercar comes out next year now...) This is the gear that rotates the arm. Note the colour of the 24 tooth gear; it seems to be a new gear trend. A lot of work has been put into this truck looking real. Personally I think they went too far as the truck seems to have been designed for a tilting cab, but it's disabled to prevent breaking the front. Bottom of the transmission. The bottom shaft lifts the arm. Note that there are more dark grey gears. The motor fits in very well also. The bottom of the arm. I was surprised by the usage of a 12 Tooth Bevel to link with the 36 Tooth Double Bevel as I had never seen that done before. As you can see there is no room for any drive train. Standard steering for a recent technic truck. There is a hand-of-god at the cab top that links via two Knob Wheels. It looks good from the back. You can also see the white Clutch that connects the transmission to the motor to avoid burnouts. It goes decently high, and can go a bit higher if you use the crane arm. Compared to last years fire truck. (If I didn't buy the fire truck for half price I would have been annoyed that Lego brought out what is almost a motorised version of the same set.) Functions: Cherry Picker Arm: Motorised rotate and lift that links to a motor via a transmission and anti-burnout clutch. Steering: Rack and pinion controlled via a hand-of-god linked by Knob Wheels Doors: Open and close. Good functionality that works well, but I wish they made the cab lift and I'm a bit sick of the lame fairing door trick. 7/10 Parts: Motor, battery box, transmission, clutch, practical wheels, only two fairings, compact turntable... this is a great parts set. 10/10 Price: At $99.99 AUD for 726 parts it's OK value when you consider what you are getting. The US price is $60.00 which is better, but still not great. I bought mine for $80 AUD which was good however, and I suspect that the price is designed for easy sale...8/10 Looks: I'd buy this for the looks alone! 9/10 Fudge: The functions work well and I llked it more than I thought I would. Oddly mine seemed to be missing a Axle Pin with Friction, but since it includes extra parts for the alternate model I didn't mind using one of my spares. On the subject of the alternate model, it is a dump truck which is made out to be a total re-build, but it isn't. It could have easily been done like Super Street Sensation was, but Lego have probably determined that instructions like that confuse people. 8/10 Overall: Recommended. 8/10	positive

Looks like an interesting set. I didn't realize the motor controlled two functions through a transmission switch. That's always good to see. I'll probably pass it up though until the price falls a bit. The overall design is a bit too studless for my liking (I think the 8275 bulldozer has a much better balance of studded and studless pieces), and the wheels somehow look too small to me. I also have something of a backlog at the moment; I still need to pick up that bulldozer along with the 8421 mobile crane (on ebay).	neutral
Wow, it's a smarty set with drive shafts (We are everybody!) and technical junk. The specs and stuff kind of lose me but the walrus looks really cute in the cherry picker!

Set: 7627 - Indiana Jones - Temple of the Crystal Skull Pieces: 929 Price: $AUD149.99 Out of all the Indy 4 sets, this one seems to cop the most flak - which may account for the fact that the other 3 were reviewed weeks ago and this one has sat, unloved and alone, waiting for someone to turn their eye upon it (or, y'know, buy it). Luckily I'm a sucker for spooky old temples, filled with devilish traps and hidden treasures, hissing fountains and overgrown foliage, creepy skeletons and crumbling stonework, so here it is: Indiana Jones 7627, Temple of the Crystal Skull. Part 1: The Figs First off, the figs - 6 humans and 4 skellies (or should that be skullies? ) Indy, Mutt, Irina, and that sneery Russian guy that's in the 2 smaller sets. Nothing new here. Aha! What have we here - two natives. I wonder if hair is a sign of power in this culture, since one guy is completely bald and the other one has the most extraordinarily luxurious black mullet. Somehow I doubt the movie will answer this question. Back view - as you can see, the scalp tattoos are also popular in this tribe. Fashion conscious! (Note in the background the paws of the fearsome black jungle panther, ie my cat, curious as to see what the tribe was up to.) Also, don't ask me why these guys are carrying axes rather than, say, spears. And what everyone's been waiting for, the skullies - three of 'em and a conquistador skellie - very cute. Note the backs of the crystal head have a plume-sized hole - or maybe that's just where they injected the blue brain-plastic. Spooky! I love these skulls, I wasn't sold from the initial pics but they have a very creepy smile and the head shape is just... weird. With the large eyes, it's kind of Homer Simpson-esque. And here we have the token vehicle in the set - a weird little tank thing with treads. Kind of looks like a cross between the amphibious boat and a mini-tank. I'm sure there's a military expert around here who can tell us exactly what it is supposed to be. The treads are nice, but the rest of it is a bit thrown together. You can tell they wanted to keep the dark green colour scheme but the budget only allowed them 5 parts to do so . All in all, a mixed bag with the figs. 4 repeats from the cheaper sets which means we have one new native figure and the crystal skullies. There are heaps of the old-skool skele heads scattered around the sets so those that prefer can replace the skullies with ordinary skellies. Bizarrely, the top of the box which has the line of 1:1 figs pic (you know what I mean) doesn't have names for any of the characters, whereas all the smaller sets do. Part 2: Box, Parts Front of box: Back of box: Two instruction books: Parts. This set has come under criticism for being overpriced - myself included - but the official piece count is 900 plus, which is pretty good considering it also contains the baseplate. 6 big bags and 2 of those 12x12 bricks in dark tan. (Note: set does not contain live Black Jungle Panther™) The DSS, helpfully comes pre-scrunched thanks to TLC. Even in a $AUD150 set they can't get that right... sigh. The dark tan baseplate. Say what you like, I'm in love. I know some people don't like these, but they were such a staple of Castle/ Pirates for so many years that I don't consider them a juniorised piece at all. This one, recycled from the 05 Police HQ and 06 Hospital, is much better in design than the King Leo's Castle one as the different heights and asymmetry make it look much more like a natural piece of ground. Perfect for MOCs. And it's dark tan - how could anyone not love such a huge slab of dark tan? Note this love doesn't extend to applying the stonework stickers which are, frankly, crap. Random instructions page: Part 3: Temple of Doom - or just a doomed temple? The complete set, front view. Isometricish view: Back view: Top view: First impressions? It's very dark tan, isn't it? And green. And bright green. And dark green. And dark red. And normal tan. And dark bley. And pearl gold! In fact, it's a bit of a mish-mash of colours. I'm of two minds about this. I kind of prefer the palette to be a bit subtler, but I can see that a playset designed for kids isn't going to sell bucketloads all tastefully done in shades of tan with lashings of dark-green foliage. There's a huge amount of dark red in this set, which is always a welcome colour, but I'm not convinced it quite works with the 2 shades of tan on offer here. On the plus side, there's also a huge amount of dark tan in ordinary 2x2 bricks, tiles, plates and 1x1 and 1x2x3 slopes, which is great for anyone wanting to stock up. Let's take a closer look. I'll do this roughly in order of the build itself: a) The big scary face. This is a simple, fun build and very effective at projecting menace at the temple entrance. It actually detaches very easily from the temple (as pictured on the box art) to allow easier access to the inside. The eyes are flick-fire missiles, with Scary Face's hair conveniently providing ammo refills should you run out. All in all, from me. (b) The Back Spin the skelly head and stone steps appear - we haven't seen this feature in a while. Nice to get these pieces in dark bley. A conquistador hides under the stairs - this is a bit useless as the stairs can't fully extend while he's there . Moving right... a trapdoor - what could possibly be behind it??!!??!!? Answer: not much, really. A little red stair. I really like these 2 stickers though - very intricate. The staircase leads to what I like to think of as the Crystal Skull Transmogrification Chamber. Now, I know nothing about the movie except that it's supposed to be have a kind of 50s B-movie plot rumoured to feature (look away, spoiler-haters)..... aliens. These weird, creepy gold chairs look made from the bones of aliens if you ask me, with their strange vertebrae and silver claws. It wouldn't surprise me if bringing these aliens back to life was part of the plot of the movie... hence the crystal skull? I guess we'll find out May 22. In any case, transforming aliens clearly like a disco whirl as when you pull the handle, the whole of this assembly spins giddily around. A very clever and simple trick - it's basically just a wheel under the platform but the effect is great. Also under here is a bottomless pit (stickered)... I would very much expect a villian to be thrown down it at some point. "So, do you come here often?" "I don't know who designed this club. These chairs are REALLY uncomfortable." NB. I am really, really over those pearl gold 1x2 roof corner slopes which started popping up in the 2006 Castle range, infected Exo-Force and have now spread here. Can we please have these in a different colour? Or a different pearl gold piece? Pretty please? ( c) Left tower (looking from the front) A small tower with a trans clear gem. (d) Right tower Waterfall with booby trap. I like the sticker, it's very cartoony, which fits with the set somehow. When you turn the wheel, flick fire missiles spray out and hit whoever is on the stairs. Both towers have a trap where if you move the skull, another one pops out from the dragon mouth. (e) Central turret thing This thing is kind of annoying and doesn't really sit or work well. It's kind of like a laser beam sending messages to space, I guess. As the central dome rises, the two plates peel away. I find it is a little bit tight to work smoothly and the two plates doesn't really sit well together at the top. Maybe I just need to rebuild it. I'm sure this will also be explained in the movie. (f) Final trap - the stair that isn't there The final trap is at the front - as Indy goes down the staircase, you can push the red heads and all the 1x8 bley bricks come tumbling down. Simple and works well. (g) Alternate view Here's how it looks as pictured on the box with the head removed. As you can see, this allows better access to the centre of the temple. As you can see, sadly there is nothing actually interesting there except a staircase to the turret and 2 dark tan slopes which are just stuck there and look a little out of place. I mean, come on, everything else has a splash of dark red and gold! Your Destination: Nowhere! Part 4: In Conclusion So after all those endless pics, what about the set itself? CONS:As a playset, 7627 doesn't quite make sense. Admittedly, the traps that are there are well-designed and unobtrusive. On the other hand, there's a great big whopping entrance at the front - but I wasn't sure if the figs are supposed to sneak in through the backdoor and go up the spiral staircase and past the waterfall (as shown in the box art) or if they were meant to end up in the golden skull room. The middle area doesn't really connect with anything, nor does the giant space turret. It may be that some of these questions are answered in the film, but whereas with 7624, 7625 and 7626 I could at least picture a story myself (eg with River Chase is fairly obvious what's happening - a chase down a river with a croc and a communist staking them out)!, the Temple set is a little all over the place. The design feels a little off to me - not really bad but not really great either. PROS: On the plus side, the natives and crystal skulls themselves are great. At 900+ pieces, this is also a great parts pack for dark tan, dark red, plant pieces, gold oddments etc. I especially love the baseplate in that shade. I like the overall shape of the temple - a big staircase with secret nooks and crannies. The build is reasonably interesting and there are some clever tricks with the traps. But upon reflection I shouldn't have to sell this set - it should be able to sell itself! As I said before, I'm a huge fan of dark, mysterious old temples so for that I have to give it some love. It reminds me of the big old Adventurers sets and the whiff of nostalgia is itself a powerful intoxicant. However, for the price Lego is selling it in Australia/ Europe/ Canada I couldn't recommend it as a must-buy for full price when the smaller sets in this series are themselves so good.

I know that alex54 had already reviewed this set beforehand, but I wanted to give my 2 cents (it is really more like $1.50) on this set I bought from toys 'r' us on friday (guess what, the price had not been increased by a dollar like all other sets, ). This is my first review of a set ever, don't be too mean. 1) Box It captures the potential (I don't know how the scene plays out... for now ) action of the scene nicely and is very pleasing, good job TLC . On the back it shows some of the play features of the set and a net little comic. Indiana Jones seems to be surprisingly calm considering that he is about to be captured under a net and attacked by a snake (the thing he fears most). 1a) comic not much to say on this... 1b) screw up At the top of the box, both "Russian Guards" have the same grining face, in the set one has the generic bad guy face from 7620. 2) Contents The box opens up to reveal a quartet of bags, an un-crumpled manual (YAY!), and a sticker sheet (BOO!) 2a) DSS Yoda said every for of rambling imaginable about this accursed item, I have nothing to say. Meh... 3) Minifigs The only thing that has not really been discussed about the figs that you get in this set is that Marion has a slightly new torso. 4) Parts of interest When I opened up the baggies, these were the components that grabbed my attention. A DARK GREEN alligator, a net piece that I Know has appeared in sets before hand ( I needed it for a MOC I am working on), some raft part that is probably very old, a ladder with two pairs of hindges, and a DARK brown version of this part. 4) Build (amphibious vehicle) This I one of the more enjoyable builds of the new line. But that is just my opinion. You start of with some thing very simple... By the end of the next page, it starts to bulk up More detail... Beginning to look like a car... 4a) Build (rear attachment) Bulk it up and add Taillights... Done... Slap it on to the main vehicle... 4b) Build (Front attachment) I am running out of things to say... Bulk it up... Add some detail... Add a gun and headlights... And attach to the rest to get the completed vehicle... Add stickers... I honestly think that the amphibious vehicle looks much better with the stickers than without... 5) Build (boat) This build goes by rather quickly and adds to the playability of the final set. Base... Apply clamps... Add more to engine... Build more detail and a gun base... Finished boat... Plus stickers... I love how Lego slips in the product number into their stickers. 6) Build (tree fort) This is the weakest part of the whole set. But I find my self liking it more and more for some odd and inexplicable reason. That tan 6x6 will most likely see use in a pirate themed vinigete soon (not mine ). Install net-launcher... You spend the next two pages building this... And putting it on... A tree branch that is an ugly mix of brown, dark brown, and frown... (our commie friend seems to like coffee a lot) Second branch... 3rd... (a wee bit to much on the coffee there, don't you think?) Final step... The only redeeming value of this section is how well the net launcher works, fantastically. The rest is just utter fail. 7) Spare parts Very little in terms of what is left over... Finished set... All in all, this set is a fine build and an excellent parts pack for dark green components. I recommend this set strongly, despite its few weaknesses.	positive
Nice review! Although you need to use the Macro setting(a.k.a. the Flower setting) for better pics. Are you using a digital camera? You really need Macro... The idea is, turn it on and hold down on the 'take picture' button halfway until the pic focuses. Then press it down all the way to take the pic. I'm glad this one also comes with the new Uzi; I wanted an extra...	neutral
Good,thorough review. Some of the pictures were a bit blurry though.	neutral
Thank you for the nice, in-depth review! I have to say, Lego did a good job on the amphibious vehicle. P.S.- If you need photo taking help, PM me and I can give you some handy tips.	positive
Very good for a first review! I bought this set and Jungle Duel at Target the other day (I was going to wait and buy them when I go to Downtown Disney this summer, but how could I pass up saving four bucks that I can spend on store-exclusives? ) and I have to say I absolutely love them. The amphibious vehicle (don't they call it a Duck in the movie?) is definitely my favorite LEGO vehicle I've ever built. Everything about it is wonderful- the size, the colour scheme, and it's accurate to the one in the movie. And Irina Spalko's hair is to die for. On a side note, I don't get why they made Marion's arms white in the set. The shirt underneath her vest in the movie is obviously blue. I switched the arms out for light blue ones and it looks a lot better, and it makes Marion's eyes look great. -Ryan	positive
While i truely fell in love one more time with the older lego city sets, i thought, why not make a review of one of the, in my opinion greatest city sets of all time. Let's not talk too much, here we go! Set Nr.: 6395 Name: Victory Lap Racetrack Number of minifigs: 13 (!!) Number of pieces: unknown Release Year: 1988 Starting with the beautiful old Legoland box: Front: Back, with some cool alternative models: Inside: We continue with the great minifigs, which are not less than 13! I don't think there is any city set with more figures, is there? Civilians: Race Crew & Assistant Personnel: Drivers: All: Here's a overview of the whole set: The "Rescue Rig" (don't exactly know how to call it) with trailer: The score board & Traffic Lights, which would be one of the details i love the most about this set: The next sweet detail, the Camera + Cameraman! Of course we have a doc, if there is some kind of accident: The pit stop boxes, i love the small tool-holder with the axle and wheel behind it: The control room high above the racetrack: Ready to go?!! That was it all in all,all i can say is, if you see this set anywhere on ebay ore somewhere else, get it!	positive
What a fantastic set. I'm overwelmed with feelings of nostalgia by seeing this review. The playability factor of this set is as high as it can be. Thanks for making and sharing this awesome review !	neutral
Thanks for this review! You have reviewed my most favourite town set of all times, I am so happy to own this one. I actually is a story to go along with it: In the summer of 1998 I went on holiday with my parents to the country of Luxembourg, in the city of Wiltz we encountered a small toystore which still had this set for sale, (9 years after the release!). I did not had the sufficient amount of money to buy the set and had to leave it at the store, I was practically in tears... Four years later we passed through Luxembourg and I remembered the city and the store. We made a detour and stopped by the same store. Every other old set was sold, the only one remaining was this one! I bought it immediately and treasured it ever since. I use the baseplates a lot in my cities, they serve well as roads with parking spaces next to them. This was the first set I owned which had the huge 6x24 plates in them, I remember my surprise when seeing plates of such enourmous lenght... I recently made an entire racetrack together with this set and to promote myself I will place a link HERE	positive
Nice reveiw I would fork out $100 AUD for that set its just so bueatiful if only TLG re-released this	neutral
Ahhhh... back in the days when Shell was the racing fuel of choice before that Octan company came to town, bought off the old Shell execs and ran them out of town on a rail... but I digress... I always liked the look of the set, but at the time could not work out where I would be able to fit it into my town...	neutral

Thank you very much for that fine review of a really classic and wonderful racing set! And I really wish that TLC would continue with showing some great alternative models on the back of the boxes.... just imagine on!	neutral
Hello all, I don't believe there has been a review of this set yet, so I wanted to take this opportunity. Up for review today is 8160 Cruncher Block and Racer X as part of Batbrick and iamded reviews: Here is the box, I have to say I love the art on it. It's very colourful and makes the truck look a lot less crap than it does on the box. Plus, you have to love the "Missile launching action" bit right, am I right? Why are you all staring at me? And here is the back. Pretty generic, but shows some nice details and so forth. Oh dear! In turning around the box have I killed myself AND iamded!? Okey dokey, up first is the best part of the entire set: the minifigs! Racer X is wonderful, though coming with a boring Bruce Wayne face. But it is Cruncher Block, his lady Driver Taejo that really shine. Look at those awesome suits! The cool faces! Taejo has a ripped shirt! Now up is the first building part of the set, with me and iamded looking rather slick in X's car. While I'm not a big fan of yellow, it is very nice, and slopes in an underused colour is better than no slopes at all: Front view, the new windshields are fantastic: While a very cool car, it is rather silly of TLC to give us the exact same one we got in the smaller set. I didn't get the smaller set with this car, so I'm still happy, but it is a bad marketing move: Sorry iamded, I know it's your birthday, but......VROOM! Now for the second part of the build and my favourite, the front of the truck: Annoyingly enough, this part opens up to shoot a pointless rubber projectile: To do this, you open the roof (a nice detail btw) and pull back the mechanism, here: Thus blowing the front part open and launching it.....well, not far really The wheels and covers are pretty cool, and the front is nicely designed, the red looks good and the rear vision mirrors are a great touch. And now for the most disappointing part - step three, the trailer: (Note - Clicky joint piece not part of set, just used to hold it up!) That's right, almost the entire thing is open, even the "filled in" side has holes! I'd certainly be cared to be back there, one bumpy hill and back you go! I didn't put the lame computer stickers on, and the control area is pretty lame in general. Not to mention Taejo (who is depicted on the boxart as standing at the desk, would most likely just be sucked out the back at those speeds! There are some pluses too though, like the ridiculously awesome minifig paintings I'll be using for Wayne Manor. Also note the "control" on Cruncher's desk that when turned, turns the gun at the bottom. It's an alright feature: Here is an example, I've shot iamded on his birthday. What? It's a love ray! Haven't you seen the Care Bears? And though I'm not a massive fan of stickers, this is just too cool. The little aquarium is very simple but very clever, using a printed piece between two clear windows to create the illusion of a tank: It looks much better in real life, trust me, and here is a side view to better explain: Now, to connect the two is a good thing, I like the way a simple technic piece assumes the job. Oh, and behold my hand! The completed truck, which, while a mixed bag, still doesn't look too bad (I guess): Now the completed set, which, despite its unbelievable large flaws, still looks cool. (Warning, the kickass iamded and Batbrick figures do not come with this set): More pics here: http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=3147324 All in all: Minifigs: 5/5 - Racer X is beautiful, Cruncher Block and the Driver too, and Taejo has a ripped shirt, damn! Design: 2/5 - Pretty poor considering the best part is available in a cheaper set, and only the front part of the truck looks cool, but still not truly awful. Build: 3/5 - Despite having a bad trailer, it was a fun build and sometimes you need something that doesn't take ages to make. Price: 2/5 - Overpriced easily, but Rogue Shadow is worse! Fun: 3/5 - The mere concept of such an open truck kept me playing with this baby for hours! Total: 15/25, not as bad as it would seem. Overall I'm really glad I bought it as the minifigs are fantastic and the paintings and fish tank are cool. It's fun, stupid and downright ridiculous, but while not a great set by any means, certainly isn't as bad in the brick as it looks in photos. Until next time, Batbrick Away!

Awesome review Batbrick! I don't see any appeal at all really in this set, but that's okay, as I want to stick to Castle anyway. The car is the best part IMO, which you can get in a different set with another cool car and for a cheaper price. But the main downfall to this set is the fact that the truck's trailer is half blown up and the survivors are magically staying inside and not being sucked right out of there, as you have mentioned. I would have thought TLC would at least included some sort of cover that you could take on and off easily (kind of like the modular buildings). Having said all that though, the front of the truck does look incredibly cool, and those minifigs are sweet. Too bad they all have flesh tone printed on them. So, while this may not be my set of choice, I can see the appeal... well, really I can't, but it's just my opinion! I'm sure there are plenty others who would love to scoop this set up. ~Peace	negative
I'll be passing on this set, thanks for the review anyway, is everyone supposed to be bald in the film? it looks weird	negative
Thanks for that fine review, Batbrick. The most interesting part of the set, for me, are the neat MFs.... the trailer looks really pretty skeletal. However.... it´s a nice little play set and´ll fit its purpose I guess.	neutral
Nice review. Good pictures, thanks. I think I may get a couple of the smaller sets, as I think these will become collectors sets in years too come, Not sure this range will be that popular? Love the minifigs though.	neutral
Batbrick thanks for the sweet review. You give me great insights into this set. Hehe, I agreed that Racer X is nice, but I believe we can get it in the other set for a much lower price. For me, the trailer which does not have a cover is bugging me alot. That's why, I holding my reservations against this set. At most, I will consider the other 2 smaller sets for collection purpose. Nevertheless, Batbrick great job	negative
Thanks for the review. My wife wanted me to buy this for the fishtank, and I came close! Untimately this set didn't offer many good part to me so I bought the smaller set with the same car. The trailer is just too insubstantial...	negative

Thanks for the great review! It seems like the most awesome part of the set is the sticker sheet, which is a reversal of the usual situation!	positive
I bought this set a few days ago and agree with what you have said about it. The trailer is fun to play with but just so plain. Overall great review.	positive
I really like this set: My favorite parts are the minifigs and X's car. VROOOM!	positive
I enjoyed the review. Some cool fleshie heads and parts, but it does seem a bit lamer even than I imagined from the box (the "airy" truck is rather slyly disguised on the box art). I would like to get it if it is ever on sale, 50% off would be nice :) Speed Racer Lego doesn't seem to be selling too well in local shops here.	neutral

Thanks a lot for the review brickbitz. I really love this set, sure the figs are annoyingly not new, but the ice cream truck is fantastic and the Tumbler is a marvel of black slopes. I see now that it is far too huge though, I reckon I will either keep it that way as a "mega tumbler", mod it to become another Battank, keep it as a model Tumbler, or pull it apart and use the bits to make a Tumbler like Wetwire's awesome one. Love those popsicles though, and those wheels are very nice, so overall as a loyal Batfan I love the set, even though it could've been better. Batbrick Away!	positive

The Tumbler is massive! I'll struggle to fit it into the Cave, but never mind. The figs are nice, the Tumbler is pretty accurate (or at least, it will be after I've MODed it), and Joker's tainted ice cream van is so very Joker. Thanks for the review, btw.	positive

Thanks so much dunamis for your awesome review .

Excellent review, Dunamis. This set looks great. The designers really though the kit out, it seems. The internal organs have got to be my favorite part, but everything is good. Now all we need is a UCS Obi-Wan with a laser pistol to finish off Grievous in a totally anti-climatic way!	positive
Hey Dunamis, think you can get a straight-on shot of the face? The red pieces inside the eye sockets are topped with trans-greenish-yellow studs which make his face look eerily alive and very close to his screen appearance. It's a nice little detail that seems to not show through on pictures I've seen of the set. The legs are a little wobbly. I'm scared that he'll be leaning too far forward in about 5 years	neutral

Awesome review, Dunamis! That's such a sweet set, I loved it as soon as I thoroughly examined the online instructions. It looks way awesome in the brick, my favourite part has to be the eyes. Very cool, and creepy. Thanks again for the info, and of course the pics! ~Peace	positive

Thanks very much for the review brickbitz! I love this year's Mars Mission line, and though this is the weakest set, it is still a major improvement. The mech is very cool and well made, and the Commander is one of my favourite alien figs ever. The alien ship is pretty good, better than last years ones but not extremely good either, but i still like the set. Batbrick Away!	positive
Thanks for that interesting review, brickbitz. The alien fighter looks pretty nice, nothing special but streamlined and fast nevertheless. That transforming feature´s a nice addition for sure, and these new flicker missile with its launch apparatus.... hmm, I hope I won´t spend quite some time in search of that little 'rocket' piece.... However, there´s still something I miss with these alien crafts.... I don´t know.... I like some more organic looking design, and they even come in some nice and different shapes, but still.... perhaps a real space fighter just needs a solid cockpit, cool windscreens and controls to satisfy my odd likings. That 'exo suit' looks really good and I wonder why it´s a little underrepresented on the box art. The jet pack/space scooter´s a really good idea, and the only thing I hate´re those darned studless technic beams.... it could look so much better with a studded version of these parts. But of course that´s only due to my personal preferences.	positive

My first impression upon seeing this set was "no thanks", but now I'm warming up to it. Still, I'll skip it if it interferes with my Hypersonic Operations Aircraft fund. :P	neutral
Thanks for the excellent review Oky! Judging by this set, the line is going to be promising. I really like the figs and I'm glad to see that robot arm is actually a new arm mold. Awesome!! Can a minifig hand fit in the end or just the chainsaw attachment? Could it fit an Exo-Force robot claw? There's a lot of detail in the torsos and I like that the Agent's suit is like a moto-cross uniform. I love that the snowmobile has a working tread. Copmike, Ras and I tried to build a snowmobile with working treads, but we ended up using chainsaw blades in the end. Great work Oky!	positive
Thanks for the great review Oky Wan The two vehicles look quite nice for a small set and the minifigs look great! The two sided head is nice, although it would've been nice if it was a new head rather than the standard frowning face. The cyborg looks good, nice and cartoony, I like the printing on his back. The belt on the hips should be useful, not to mention the robotic hand. I assume that anything that fits into a 1x1x1 cylinder can fit in it? I hope so Thanks again Oky. Any chance you can get any more sets?	positive
Thanks for the review. I'm looking forward to some of the new parts and ideas in this line. The figures look great. The actual sets themselves don't really appeal though.	neutral
This set looks wicked! Thanks very much for the sweet review Oky Wan! The pics are perfect, great quality and the perfect size, well done! This sets got everything, a new hairpiece, tank treads, a gem, well, I could go on but you can all see everything from the great pics. Thanks again Oky! This is one set I'll definately be getting! ~Peace	neutral
Huhm .. i like the idea of the agent-ID .. but offcourse all they want with that is that you buy all six sets .. but it can be a good idea for children, they wouldn't think of "hey they get all money only because i have a little card with stars" or something. Well, not to rant, i think it's good. Also, can you make that name yourself? maybe set 5 comes with a extra stickersheed with all letters, that would be nice "Agent Rupee" A very nice review Oky Wan Kenobi. =Rupee	neutral
Oky Wan, thanks for this wonderful review! I really have mixed feelings towards Agents set. Haha, but I love the Agent mini-figure. The double-sided face is great and I love the sunglass look. It's nice that they made use of Mutt's hairpiece which is personally my fave hairpiece at the moment The jet-pack is neat. Making use of the additional secure backing onto the mini-fig is really very smart.	positive
Nice first review Oky Wan ! I´d say this is better than we first thought. The minifigs looks cool and the overall look is ok. And the excaustpipe is a new peace also I think? Agents On copmike	positive
I kind of like the set. As said it has a very cartoonish style to it so I'm guessing the kids are going to love it. And as a parent I'll love it if the construction isn't to fragile. ;) I'll probably be getting a few for myself but only as parts pack. copmike, on May 18 2008, 11:29 AM, said: And the excaustpipe is a new peace also I think? Yeah and it's all over this years releases. From what I've seen so far it's found in: racers, Speed Racers, Mars Mission and Exo-Force sets. I just wish that instead of a 2x1 plate with an exhaustpipe in each end they would have made it an 1x1 plate with a single exhaust. That would have been a lot more useful.	positive

I love the way the bad guy has a special attachment on the jewel case JUST to allow the Agent to grab it with his hook. It's like the two of them sat down beforehand and drew up the plans for the vehicle together... CYBORG: "OK, and then I'll make my getaway in the special snowmobile and you can follow me..." AGENT: "...And I'll scoop up the jewel and return it to foil your plan". CYBORG: "Perfect. See you Tuesday?" Dr. S.	positive
Good review! Thanks Oky Wan. Hmm, although I really like the villain (not just the new arm, I think the color is very... villanous, as all Bond-villains with class have minions in uniforms. It's even possible to fill out their numbers with Exo-force grunts of the same color) I'm not that hot for the agent himself, his uniform... nah. It doesn't even look like clothes, just give the man a suit or some nifty leather. I think I'll try to grab some sets from the agents line just for the new parts (to begin with... MOCs may follow, who knows?) when they are available in stores here in Sweden. Haven't seen them yet, though Indiana Jones just got here so there might be some further waiting for me. Now I want to see reviews of the other sets :)	negative
Hmm, interesting set. Great review! I might pick this one up for the wonderful parts. ~VBBN~	neutral
What a lovely set, thanks for that fine review, Oky Wan Kenobi! The MFs´re wonderful, that helipack looks solid and well done and I especially like the slightly asymmetrical design of the neat snowmobile. A very playable little set for sure, and the most interesting part´s for sure that new cool MF arm....	positive
Yay, Oky Wan! Wow, the Agents line is looking good so far. The jetpack is pretty nice, and the minifigs... My dad was in Portland just yesterday, and If I'd have called an hour sooner, he might have been able to get to the TRU...	neutral
Thanks for the great review Oky Wan! At first I didn't think I liked the Agents sets but the more I see them the better I think they look. I will definitely pick up 1 or 2 of the sets. I really like the jet pack, and the figs look great. That double face is very nice. TLG should make more figs with these faces in my opinion.	neutral
Great review!Thank youvery much! I think this line is much more promising than most orginally thought it would be. I'm onmy way to see ifican find the big rig right now!	neutral
Thank you.	neutral
Thanks for the review! Do i see a little Indy hint on that map? Oh and btw., the map looks like it actually is printed am i right?	neutral
Looks good, and I'll bet that jaw and wire could be used for lots of MOCs... Is this the only Agents set that contains the wire? While I'm here: I got the third mission, would anyone like a review of that? Faramir	positive
That would be great! I still wonder why the instructions aren't up yet, though..	neutral
Thanks for the review, this set is wonderful! U love the TWO dark green crocodiles and awesome minifigs, especially break jaw That bike is awesome and the base, like all agents sets, comes with great pieces, like the barbed wire, orange anything, leafy pieces and brown log pieces. Thanks for the review, I'll definitely get this one! Batbrick Away!	positive
Great little set, nice to have a small building instead of all vehicles. Plant pieces and dark green crocs always welcome. Good parts selection for the price. Thanks for the review! Can't wait till we can get our hands on these!	positive
Nice set... Im definately gonna pick it up when I see it. I like the design of the base and it comes with lots of usefull an neat pieces.	positive
Great looking set! I’m determined to get all the Agent sets this summer. Comments: Swamp Tower-The barbed wire is cool, but it seems like it’s only for looks. Bike-Cool looking, but doesn’t seem to have any controls. Cybercrocs-Wow, haven’t seen any of these pieces for a while, and in dark green, awesome! Agent Charge-Sweet head, definitely cool. Break Jaw-He looks like the result of some animal testing on humans gone horribly wrong. I hope they come out near me soon.	positive
Wow, thanks for the great review, SirNadroj! The overall set is what attracted me in the first place, that elevated hut and swampy setting just sucked me right in! It all looks really nice to me, a definite buy. That Agents head would make a great Indy, for those opposed to fleshies. And that monobrow, I mean, villain guy looks very... er... well, the monobrow is unique, thought I noticed the suit looks a bit skin tight in the crotchal area. Don't look at me like that, you saw it too! Anyway, the helmet's the best part about the villain, great for Warhammer 40,000 Orks. ~Peace	positive
I always joked that our house would have a moat around it with mechanical alligators. Now I can build the house in lego! Thanks SirNadroj for the review and pictures. This is definitely my favorite Agents set.	positive
Great review and a good confirmation of exactly what I suspected... this is a parts line for me. Much like Exoforce before it, this will be the theme I pick up when I'm out of other things, or it's on sale. Plus those dark green alligators bring tears of joy to an old pirate.

Thanks for an interesting review, ???theriddler???. The set´s cheap and very useful to get two fantastic MFs, a great Mr. Freeze and a very cool new Batman. But I have to say that these two small vehicles just look plain ugly IMHO, without any inspiration nor orginality.... Sorry, TLC, but you can for sure do better than that, and even with less pieces....	neutral
Nice review, thanks! I really like those little go-kart thingies, they've got a fantastic Mario Kart look to them	positive
Thanks for the review... Ill probably get one copy of this set. Mr. Freeze and his cart look neat. I dont like the huge wing on the back of Batman's buggy so Ill probably mod that out.	neutral
Quote But I have to say that these two small vehicles just look plain ugly IMHO, without any inspiration nor orginality Indead. The only reason to get this set is if you couldn't afford the Batcave back in 2006 and want a Mr. Freeze fig for a cheap price. And anyone who did get that kit really have no reason whatsoever to get this. Wait, did I forget something? Oh yeah - thanks for the review, Riddler. Edited by Grevious, 22 May 2008 - 11:54 PM.	neutral
Like many others, I'll buy this just for Mr F, quickly recycle the parts, and pretend this set never existed. The flame detail is indeed terrible. The Bat is back - and he's flatulent! This third Bat-wave isn't really doing anything for me. I'll get the Penguin set as well for pretty much the same reason - although the sub on that is pretty cool - but skip the others. Maybe Batbrick can make us all nice alt-mocs to improve these sets... Thanks for the review though!	negative
Thanks for the review ???theriddler???. This is a neat little set, a bit overpriced in my opinion, but for a new suited Batman and a Mr Freeze fig in a set other than one of the most expensive Bat-sets released, it's worth my money. ~Peace	positive
Pretty nice review for a first time ???theriddler???. Next time though, if your camera has it, use the macro function (little flower icon) and perhaps a tripod. That should get rid of any blur and provide you with better pictures. Apart from that, a good little review. Keep up the good work!	neutral
Neat little set. I do like the parts a number of hard to find bits all in one pack, depending on how much it costs in USD I'll have to consider it. And while the buggy designs kinda suck, I'm a little happy to see them, its been years since TLC made any small go kart style vehicles. I guess Tiny Turbos have been overshadowing that market?	positive

In actuality, I think that this may be my favorite Batman set of all time. I know, I know - it's a small set with crappy tiny vehicles; so it probably sucks for the fan who likes to display sets; but look at the MOCing side and you see this set has a ton of potential: -New Batman fig. Well, mainly the torso; but it looks nice, sleek, and armored! A definite plus whether you're a MOCist or batfan. -Mr. Freeze. Because nobody bought the Batcave when they should have...and by nobody I mean me. Plus, I love that head! -Cheapest way to amass the lightning piece. The other sets that have it are lolhueg (Well, not really, but I don't have $50 to toss around on a little skeleton tower...), and it's a great piece. -Two little blue gems. I may be alone on this, but those are my favorite parts (the gems), and that's my favorite color for them! <3 <3 <3 -Several other useful parts, including a +O piece in black, some light/medium blue bits from Mr. Freeze's kart, the oddly placed grappling hook, and some cheap wheels. Now, I don't know about you guys, but this is as close to a Batman Battlepack as we're going to get, lol - I'm buying at least three, maybe more once I get my summer job ^.^ (Oh, and the fact that the US price is only $10 helps a little, but this year you guys can't complain - you got practically every set first, ESPECIALLY the new castle! T.T) ~Trexxen	positive
Thanks for the review. I dont know if I would get this set though. The cars are not that great and the price is a little too high.	negative
I got this yesterday and built it this morning. Apart from the figs, it is very crappy. Mr Freeze's buggy is OK but the bat buggy is easily the worst vehicle I've seen for years. Colours are all over the place, the grappling hook feels cheaply made, the inclusion of those odd pearl silver parts which have been in the Exo-Force sets seem especially random here, the terrible Bionicle flame piece... It's the first Lego vehicle I've built where I've immediately had the urge to disassemble it and pretend I never bought it! Really, I only got it for Mr Freeze so I shouldn't complain. But still. It's a real step backwards. The comparable Catwoman dragster set was heaps better. The Penguin sub is sweet though Thanks for the review anyway!	negative
Coming in at around $50 US, Turbo Car Chase is one of the bigger of the new Agents sets. A big box with a helicopter, car, and gate in it. Seems like a winner, but how good is it really, and is it worth the cash? Let's start with the Minifigs. This set comes with a standard Inferno Henchman, Spy Clops, and Agent Chase. The Henchman is you basic LEGO criminal type with a gun and a jumpsuit, nothing real groundbreaking here. Spy Clops, on the other hand, is very cool for, technically, half of a Minifig. His head has a neat electronic goggle print and the rest of him is a torso mounted onto a set of six legs made from Exo-Force robot arms. The whole thing is really well done and neat as hell. Agent Chase (Turbo Car Chase! ) seems to have a standard agent body and a double-printed face with one side a sunglasses and headset print. The other face is a determined Agent look. The set also includes a laptop with Doctor Inferno wallpaper. The laptop is a new piece and works like the LEGO books that are in a lot of Harry Potter sets. Molding on the keyboard is really well done and the thing can be held by a Minifig along either corner, but not in the middle and not while closed. The gate in the set is nothing revolutionary by itself, and I sort of get the feeling that it was included to drive up the piece count and the set price point. That being said, there are some things to like here. For instance, the gate has four wheels of barbed wire attached to it. The barbed wire is new and makes me want to start building some World War I trench MOCs. The rest of the gate is fairly big and it has a handy ramp attached so that vehicles can roll through it easily. The main feature of the gate is a sound brick. It's much better then LEGO sound and light units of the past, when the gate is opened it depresses a button and an alert klaxon blares that sounds every bit like a prison-beak in progress. The triggering action works surprisingly well and it's pretty much for this feature alone that I'm not going to immediately break the gate back down and add it to my parts bin. The designers did make an effort to create more then just a fence though. A nice control panel connected to a big spotlight crowns the piece, and a pair of cameras watch the opening. It's really hard to mess up a LEGO helicopter, and this set is no exception. The Inferno Chopper is a nicely proportioned and well built machine. It looks properly menacing and has the uniform orange and black of other Inferno property. It's armed with a set of four Technic pegs cleverly used as guns on outriding mounts, as well as a pair of the newer-style flick-fire missiles. I personally don't care for flick-firing missiles, but these look decent enough and seem to stay put so I really can't complain about them. Along the fuselage are a pair of intake pieces that I've never seen before and I'm guessing are new. They're pretty well designed and will come in handy for MOCing down the road. The action feature of the aircraft is the wench system. This is very different then other LEGO wenches in that you build the entire mechanism and housing. You can then use it to raise Spy Clops up and down from the bottom of the chopper using the rotor. Now, this also keeps you from sitting there and just giving the rotor repeated spins to simulate flight. I'm not too thrilled with that, but there are a hundred other LEGO helicopters out there with fully rotating rotors, so I guess I can let it by just this once. As you'd suspect, the bottom of the cockpit is completely open, which makes this a vehicle pretty much solely for Spy Clops (Sorry Henchman). But there is plenty of room beneath the body to attach a plate with some seats on it to accommodate another pilot without drastically altering the design, or even removing existing pieces. The Turbo Car is a slick little honey of a LEGO car, and the silver pieces that make up the body work contribute a lot to that fact. The front license plate appears to be an Exo-Fore code brick. But it also hides the activation lever for the passenger ejector seat. The seat works about as well as the Spruce Goose, which is to say not well at all, but here it's the thought that counts. The interior of the car is really well done. There's even a radar screen for keeping track of pesky helicopters. But the Bond-like features don't end there. A lever in the compartment raises pair of guns in the hood and a knob on the rear deploys a quad rocket system with more flick-fire missiles. This is a car that won't be stopped easily! The rear has two cones sticking out. I'd like to think they're smoke nozzles or oil-slick sprayers. All-in-all, this is a really good set. The car is pure LEGO vehicle love and looks fantastic. The silver pieces are very nice and it's a shame LEGO doesn't use metallic colors in System sets more often. There are, however, a LOT of sticker for this set and I know how much that bugs a lot of people. I personally like how much detail the stickers add to these sets and don't mind them so much. The set also comes with an Agents ID card for Chase which you can put little star stickers on from other sets as you get them. It's printed on a real nice piece of sturdy plastiboard and would be cooler if you could put your own picture and name on it instead of pretending to be Chase. Sold by themselves, the car and chopper would be must-haves. All tossed together with the gate sort of makes the set a little less then the sum of it's parts. And with 498 parts (most of them small) that's not so hot. It's only slightly over-priced in my opinion, but if you do shell out the money you won't regret it. I'm very comfortable recommending this set to anyone. Close to perfect, but the price and some minor flaws bring it back just a little. I'd say 4.33, but out of 5 is close enough!	positive
Looks cool, one of the best in this line. Cant wait for review!	positive

Deinonychus, on May 23 2008, 10:12 PM, said: Pics and thoughts tomorrow! I picked up this set earlier in the week and was quite pleased with it (in fact I have missions 1-5 and am happy with all of them - this series is much better than the old Alpha Team ever was). I look forward to reading your thoughts on it. I will say 2 things about it now though. 1)My set came with defective instructions. In 2 places pages are missing and duplicates of other pages repeated. For instance, the car instructions are missing steps 16-21. Fortunately, I was able to make out what pieces went where in the missing steps by studying the illustration in step 22. I hope you have better luck with your instructions. 2)This set contains the best LEGO sound brick ever (it's just begging to be incorporated into my Arkham Asylum).	positive
Mr. Mandalorian, on May 24 2008, 11:58 AM, said: What is a sound brick? Ditto. Maybe its like the Exo-Force light-up brick, only with sound instead of light. That would kick [INNAPROPRIATE WORD DELETED].	neutral
WOW! Thanks, Deino, for this great review! I can't wait to get this myself, but right now I gotta save for the CW sets! The car is with no doubt one of the most mind blowing things TLG has come up with and we can only hope that there will be more models made out of almost only metalic colors! The spider cyborg, while not as innovative as some of the other cyborgs, is a very nice fig, and his head will be very usefull for Splinter Cell MOCs! And those intake pieces are only relatively new btw, they are in almost all of the current $10 Racers sets. Any chance of you taking a pic of a line-up of all the silver parts in this set? Edited by Oky Wan Kenobi, 24 May 2008 - 11:32 PM.	positive
Great review, Deino! Man, that car is just so beautiful, and the helicopter is nice too. Unfortunately, this seems pretty pricy, and I hardly think I'll be getting it any time soon, what with my limited budget and all. Still, it's great to see how well Agents is shaping up.	positive
I love it ! Fun, playable, cool looking, and killer minifigs! Sweet!	positive
Thanks for the review Deino! I love going back through the old "Agents" thread just to see how wrong we were about these awesome sets! I actually really like the gate, those portcullis pieces people may know i always find nice uses for, and I really, really, really want that awesome sound brick. The figs are a bit disappointing in numbers, but agent Chase is very cool, generic henchman are great, and Spy Clops is one of my favourite minifigs ever! The helicopter is wonderful too, I love that it is customised for Spy clops to winch him down. The colours as usual for these sets are fantastic, the dark blue, orange and chrome silver! The car is the best though, I love all the functions. How does the ejector seat work though? Batbrick away!	positive
Wow, thanks for the great review Deino This set is really a must have for me. The sound brick seems great, the helicopter looks very nice and the car is superb! All of the James Bond features are really cool, though I'm very interested in how the ejector seat works (or doesn't work..). The car itself is very sleek and full of beautiful silver, and the inclusion of the new rims and windshield mean that I won't have to buy many Speed Racer sets. As for the minifigs, they all look great, especially SpyClops. Though it looks rather easy for him to fall off of his spider legs. Can you confirm this? A great review of a great set, thanks Deinonychus	positive

ES.JPG 47.94K 110 downloads The ejector seat A long Technic axle runs the length of the front of the car. It comes in to the seat area here and nests into the gray joint which is attached to the small gray Technic beam. The beam is attached to the ejector seat (bottom white 3x2 plate) with a Technic pin. The seat, in turn, is attached to the side of the car with a Technic pin. The result is, when the axle is pushed forward, the gray joint and beam tilt the seat and "eject" a Minifig. After about 20 shots the Minifig only went outside of the car 3 times...the rest of the time he just bounced around the inside of the car. So they get an A for effort, but an F for execution	neutral
Thanks for the great review! I'm really liking these agents sets the more i see them. The car seems to have alot of features. Its to bad the the ejection seat doesn't work as well as one would hope. Oh well. Makes me want the big rig even more now!	positive
Thanks for your great review! It looks very nice indeed! The gate have very interesting mechanism. The car looks very slick and cool. It looks like those typical kind of James Bond car. This review gives me very good insights.	positive
Great review deinonychus I really like it! can someone record the sound os the sound brick(maybe on youtube?) I really want to hear it. This sets are really cool deino can you post a picture of the agent card it comes with?	positive
Great review and fantastic pics, Deinonychus. And a big thank you to whoever pointed out that you could use the sound brick for Arkham Asylum, my addled brain didn't make the connection. The car is just beautiful, and with a good use for the most expensive part of the gate, this is on my wish list for sure, just have to see how much cash is left over after buying the new death star in a month or two. Agents has to be the biggest surprise from Lego for ages, without any pics it sounded so-so, but they've done a brilliant job with it, love those metallic coloured pieces!	positive

Great Review Thanks for sharing	positive
Hello all Eurobricks members, I will present to you a very short review on the recent Castle Battlepacks. This time, I will be reviewing Skeleton Battlepack, and I hope everyone of you do enjoy viewing it. This was a request that put up by hollisbrick in the Castle thread. Initally, I thought it was a very simple set to do a review. However, for the love of Castle, I decided to whip this up for every Castle fan out there. This is an image of how the Skeleton Battlepacks look like. I have bought 12 last packs of these in total so far but none of the Crown battlepacks yet. There were snapped much faster, that I imagined. Do pardon me for the poor lightning. Today is a bad weather, it's hard to get natural light. The Skeleton Gang For a single battlepack like this, with an attractive reasonable price. You obtained a series of 5 skeleton mini-figs with tons and tons of useful castle accessories. To me, it's a very very great buy, and it's a MUST to stock up for my army building! Some add-ons! However, I was not very satisfied with my Skeleton armies standards. Therefore, I decided to make some slight modifications with some additional castle accessories that is stocked in my Castle warehouse. After the makeover, Ok, this is what I called a real skeleton army. This is mainly my opnion and it have to be aligned with my standards. I felt this improved battlepack gives a punch to the exisitng battlepack. The two soliders on the right, is able to align with the rest of my Castle Chess sets armies. While the one on the left, it gives me a great archer back up with the quiver and helmet attached to him. The ones, on the center especially the armored guard which equipped with the black nose cone helmet is my fave. It is able to illustrate the "Elite" among the rest of the guards with its armor and helmet which was featured in my Castle Deep Forest Expansion MOC.. Promotion On! In addition, the one which was hastly done with a modify mace, it looks rather simple. In time to come, I will change it and gives a better equipment and look. These are the remains. I can use the axe for my dwarf in my dwarf mine defender. In that set, there is no weapon for my dwarf and I have to get it from other sets. The rest of the accessories, makes a very good stock up for future upgrading! Overall: 9/10 This is not a playset. It is mainly bought for its abilty to mass recurit any armies, and is a main love for all Castle Army builders such as me! This set mainly have no major faults, and I love it so much. Although, I have done some slight modifciations, but this set is a must for me to buy more and more! Meanwhile, I will need to wait for the next shipment! Hope everyone have enjoying viewing this simple review of mine! Edited by WhiteFang, 25 May 2008 - 12:52 PM.	positive
Thanks for the review WhiteFang. I love these sets, and I wish they were available in NZ. So far, it seems they may never come here... But I can sit and hope.

But I can sit and hope. I like the look of them after your make-over, a real skeleton army there! Did you say you've bought 12! Tht's lots of Skelies. Are you planning a big MOC or something? No problem! I had bought it last month. I thought it was so simple to do a review for this. Was looking through the thread, then I realised there is a request for it. It was an unexpected shipment that send to Singapore. It came in very limited quantity. Most of the battlepacks were snapped within a day or two when it arrived. Well, I am thinking of building something big in the future. It's just a plan that I have not decided yet. For me, I always love to see the beauty of a big army with different battalions, forming a kingdom. That's why, I always buy many many sets that have figures that attracts me. And for this battlepack, it served a very good purpose for it!	neutral
Thanks for the review!!! It wasn't "really" a request but more of an imply to do it Anyway great review! Can't wait til these come to Aus. probably when the rest of the castle comes out in September though	positive
Thanks, WhiteFang! Castle Battle Packs.... simply wonderful! Finally a dream came true, well done TLC!	positive
Thanks for the review Whitefang! Your additions look great, I like your mace much better than the use of a small technic cog, your looks much sturdier. And that helmet looks really great on skellie soldiers, I never thought to use that before. Very cool indeed! ~Peace	positive
MacK, on May 26 2008, 01:30 PM, said: You cannot say that the battle pack contains the same amount of stuff that the other two sets have and therefore should be priced the same. It just seems that Lego is ripping off Canadian army builders, to me if the battle pack contained a small catapult, or wall so that it contained about the same amount of stuff that the other sets had it would be fair. It seems stupid that you will only get minifigs from one set, while you can get about the same amount of minifigs plus a bunch of other stuff from two other equally priced sets. That’s why to me these battle packs are a rip off, because of what they contain, IMHO the Battle Packs seem to be only worth about 10 dollars. MacK, I can understand your concern when pricing is concerned. Pricing is always a big issue for us to determine whether to buy or not to buy a certain set in a particular country. Pricing varies differently across different countries such as US, Europe, Canada, Australia and etc. This is something very hard for us to decide on. We can't be sure why TLC placed their pricing strategies this way. Well, I think we should appericate what TLC is trying to do for us, by not using price as the only factor to judge whether to buy this set or not. At least, I am sure there are many of us trying to request for battlepacks to muster armies for their MOCs, Armies Collection and etc. Different people have different judgements towards different sets and different themes. I respect your opnion. IMO, let's don't let price be the only determined factor to decide whether to purchase a particular set or not. Instead, consider an array of factors that is offered. However, I do know that consumers like me and you are always affected by price. iamded, on May 26 2008, 01:40 PM, said: Thanks for the review Whitefang!

That mace was a much looking weapon. It looks much firm than the orignal look. The design was inspired from Dwarf Mine and Dwarf Mine Defender. I would not want to have so many troll flags hanging around. The nose cone helmet, was to give the soliders a whole new look. To me, it retains the classic look, yet it belongs to present theme, suitable for my Skeleton Elite Guards.	negative
Thanks for sharing these close-up images of this battlepack WhiteFang. I actually had this set in my hand at Legoland Cal. and could not decide if I wanted it. I'm currently out of "castle-mode" with my large Indy Jungle set up on the table, and creating Ghost Train MOCs that are starting to line up on the bookshelves.

For those of you who buy so many of this and the other battle pack with Crownies, what do you do with all of them? Is this simply to create a large-scale army, or do you plan to build large castle scenes with all the figs. I'd love to see some pictures (on the "share your castle army" thread).	neutral

There are so many great stuffs waiting for you such as Dwarf Mine, Tower Raid and etc. However, I can understand that the problem of space is always the key issue. Without space, it is hard for us to keep it on display for big-scale MOCs or for storage purpose. I will be waiting for you to get your Troll Warship too.

For me, I will use these battlepack for army building purpose. I always feel that every kingdom needs a considerable amount of soldiers to defend their kingdom. Therefore, most of the time, the amount of soldiers will dictate how strong that kingdom is in my collection. In the future, I hope to build large castle scenes, combined all playsets, armies everything together and developed a kingdom scene. Of course, that is just a dream for now. I am still currently not able to afford much space and time to do such big scale project at the moment. Meanwhile, for this great castle theme, I am storing them at the moment and take it out when the time is ripe. One day soon, I hope I can post an image or two of my armies.

Hi gang! As you all know, Indiana Jones IV has just debuted, and TLG has released a set depicting the Incan temple (7627) from the film's climax. But Lego beat Harrison Ford, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and company to the punch by nine whole years with Johnny Thunder's adventures in the Amazon Ancient Ruins. The Vitals: Year of release: 1999 Parts Count: 453 MSRP: $80.00 The set included eight figures: (from left) Two skeletons, Dr. Lightning, Gail Storm, Gabarros, Achu, Johnny Thunder, and Señor Palomar. On the far right is my new sigfig, el Conde Voltio Villar. Construction begins with Dr. Lightning and his jeep. It's a sturdy Adventurers-style vehicle, with fatter tires at the rear for better traction. Next is Gabarros and his unusual boat. The hull is from Belleville/Paradisa sets, where it is usually pink or white. TLG ought to have put it in the Pirate theme, as it is a nice, intermediate size. In this set, it is a small steamship. The temple is built on modular 8x8 green bricks which fit into square holes in the baseplate. This is the "treasure room." This square has a nasty double-spear trap. Careful... This is the top section of the temple, crowned by Achu the (mummified?) Incan. More modular sections (these are from the front of the temple site, across the river from the main building). El Conde: "You are too beautiful a woman to be wandering alone in the jungle, Miss Storm. Please, allow me to accompany you." Gail Storm: "I'm with Johnny, and I have a cutlass." El Conde: "I'll be on my way." Here's the finished temple, with all parts in place. Now for the traps... "Hmm, a giant ruby to bring home to the king." "¡Uf!" "That was embarassing. Miss Storm saw me fall..." "And now I've fallen again!" "I had better rest here before something worse happens." "¡Chispas!" "That's it, I'm leaving this place!" "Why me? Why?" The Verdict: This is a fine set, a set whose bare parts/price ratio does not accurately reflect the intricacy of its design nor the rarity of its parts. I had to buy replacements for some of them, and let me tell you, they are PRICEY! That green baseplate? $14. The little dark gray saucepan near the fire? Not available on Bricklink at any price. The brown boat hull? VHTF. With this set, parts quality trumps parts quantity. And the minifigures are wonderful! There's not a dud in the bunch with the possible exception of the very common Dr. Lightning, and even he is not bad. When you factor in the coherence of the color scheme and the brilliant traps, it is obvious that 5986 is a classic. 10/10 Edited by WhiteFang, 27 November 2008 - 05:33 AM.

I've always wanted to see this set close-up Voltio. Thanks for sharing the image review. This is the only Jungle Adventurers set I don't have and it's got some great unique pieces (esp. those leaf brick pieces). What's great is they're not stickers. This is a really a nice review of a neat set; with the extra little humor you shared. Thanks again for taking the time to photograph and share over EB.	positive
Thanks for this great review, voltio! I never knew of this set 'till now, and it really looks great! I never paid much attention to those Aztec/Incan style sets, which I now regret. I love the bright colours used here, and all the great traps, there's so many of them, which is exactly what we can expect from an old Incan temple like this one. I'm surprised there's no catapult. Anyway, the minifigs included are also great, and am I right in guessing those bricks are printed? That would be fantastic, as they look amazing. That boat hull is new to me too, although I guess the fact that it's mainly in Belville sets explains that pretty well. Thanks again for the sweet review, do you have any other Jungle Adventurers sets you plan to review? ~Peace	positive
I'm gonna start searching Ebay!	positive
I've always wanted this set, ever since it came out in '99.

A real classic, thanks for that nice and funny review, voltio! A well designed set, very playable with a lot of nifty traps, a very good use of that raised baseplate and really nice crafts. The MF characters´re excellent too! And although the color scheme´s great and original, especially with all these neat printed pieces, it´s perhaps the only part of that set that looks a little out of date today.... Nevertheless, the set´s plain charming and shows clearly that TLC don´t need licenses to do some distinct Adventurer sets.	positive
Great Review. I saw the instructions of this set, but never atracted me Until now A great set an a excelente review.	positive
Thanks for reviewing this rare set! Since it came out in 1999 I have only seen this set in a toystore one single time, one single copy as well... It was in the summer of 1999 in Belgium (Arlon) in a store called 'Maxi Toys' (Belgiums TRu, I think). They had the three biggest Junglesets for sale there: these Ancient Ruins, The set with the beautiful black boat and the zeppelin. Being into Adventurers at that time I had never seen the entire Jungle theme (not even in a leaflet or catalog) and surprised as I was I bought all three sets. That was one happy Dutch boy in Belgium! Surprisingly the two smallest sets made it in very small quantities to my local stores in Holland (except for the pontoon plane and small raft which was my very first Shop at Home order). The spider's secret I bought off BL, which makes me the proud owner of the entire Jungle Serie. Back to the set: This was the first time in a long history of collecting Lego that I had a deformed piece: an 2x8 red plate was twisted, I twisted it back and it still serves it's purpose... I loved the whole steam-idea in this Jungle serie: the two boats both (including the one in this set) had nice steamengines and a very cool mechanic (yours has the wrong hat/hair btw) to come along with them. The skeleton falling down on the end of a chain was the most intriguing part of this set for me, it worked really well and when you were done scaring minifigures you could winch it up again ready for the next go. The only thing I did not really like about this set was the difference in wheelsize on the car, front small, back large and the way the palmtree consisted out of just three parts... All in all a great set that is becoming more rare and expensive as we speak/post. Get it! Edited by simonwillems, 26 May 2008 - 07:59 PM.	positive
Great review! I just barly missed the Jungle series, growing up with half a year of Jungle and mainly Orient Expedition and Dino Island. I like Egypt more, but this set (despite the 4x4 palm tree) is practically perfect. I love the detail and vibrant colours. Gotta say, I've got a thing for Pippin Reed myself. By the way, what does "VHTF" mean? Edited by sdpirate, 28 May 2008 - 01:06 AM.	positive
VHTF= Very Hard to Find. To answer some earlier replies... No, there are no stickers in this set. While some Adventurers sets of the era had stickers (the 5956 Zeppelin had tons), all of the interesting mesoamerican designs from this set are printed. Also, simonwillems was correct; my mechanic is missing his hat, which should be a black kepi. They're extremely expensive on BL, though (proving once again that this set has some awesome parts), so I ordered a replacement from Lego. It's in the mail and should come soon.	positive
The printed pieces are the real gems of this set. Beyond them, there isn't much to this set, though the boat hull is nice. The model itself, isn't all that great. The new Akator temple is definately a superior model (at least in piece count), but those printed pieces are hard to resist. Steve	negative
I absolutly love this set. This is in my opinion the best Adventurers set. It has it all; the falling bridge, the falling skeleton, the spear trap, and the classic trapdoor. It is a must-have set. Thanks for providing such a nice review.	positive

So i just piced up a new digital camera and i thought what better way to try it than doing a review of my newest set. The new 7738 Coast Guard Helicopter! itsmy first review, so go easy on me! lets start off with the small stuff. First the mini figs. You get 4 figs total. Two helicopter pilots, a diver and a civilan to rescue. The torso's are nothing new on the pilot and diver. Same ones as in the last coast guard line. But i like the colors alot better in this coast guard line than the previous generation. The yellow and blue really work well together and the coloring on the badge looks great! The civilian looks to be just a dock worker with an overall torso and a beenie. The diver has nice vented helmet and a pair of flippers that suits his duty perfect! Next we have an absolute work of lego art. The rescue raft! The orange flaps can be moved back for easy entry to the raft, as well as the white "support" beams with the caution tape. I put support in perenthaces cause they really don't support anything. Just there to fill in the gaps. At the top of the raft is a red locator beacon, ccommunications antenna, and a cargo loop for lifting the raft. lets move on to the interior of the raft. Not much here. But you can see the techinc beam that attaches to the top loop,and to the floor of the raft. So far this has proven to be very sturdy and has supported the full weight of the raft quite well. You can also see the white box that holds the equipment of the raft. Here you can see the life saver tube. Here's a shot with our dock worker peaking out the side. The raft says max ocupants 4, but with the storage box, that might be a tight fit. Now lets move on to the Helicopter! in my opinion this is one of the best helicopters TLC has come out with to date. I really felt they captured the look and proportions of a real Coast Guard helicopter. it uses a lower hull and tail section of the new airliner, and cargo airplane. It really seems to work well with this application. The engines have good detail using new "cheese graders" as vents, as well as the new engine stacks that come in the new speed racer sets. The rotors also appear to be new as well. lets move on to the cockpit. We have two seats for our pilots with a sticker sheet for intruments on a flat 4 wide plate. There's also an antena being used as a flight stick. Another shot with our pilots at the helm. Now lets moveon to the high lihgt of this heavy lifting machine. The med bay, and lifting winch. http://www.brickshel...icopter_020.jpg here you can see the winch arm at rest, along with the medical strechter. The bad part is that the med. strechter doesn't include the ussually included fold away wheels. here's a shot with the winch arm extened ready for rescue! In the second shot you can see the drum that the wire coils up in. It coils up via a recently new power functions "pull" back motor. To operate, just pull out the winch cable, hook on your load, and presse this orange button on the side... The bad part of the new power functions winch is that although its very smooth in its operation, its not very strong. It will only lift the raft a couple inches before it runs out of torque. It also has a tendency to want to pull the crane arm backin while its lifting. It doesn't matter if its a light load, or heavy load. The bay doors open on both sides for easy postioning of the figures and accses to the strechter. Here we have our diver looking over his rescue-e. Nice and roomy if you don't mind a crane arm being in your way!! At $39.99 and a peice count of 445, i felt this set was a great good considering what your getting. The raft construction is very creative and is probbly the highlight of the set by itself. The helicopter is probbly one of the best, if not the best helicopter TLC has ever came out with if you can get over its size. in a scale of one to five.... Price- Peice count- Playability- Design- overall- .5 I would have given it a full 5 out of five, but since the winch can't pull the raft all the way, it didn't fell it right. Even with this minor flaw, i still highly recomend this set!	neutral
Wow. I was skeptical of this Coast Guard line. Though getting to see some detailed pictures of this set I really want to get get it. Alas, I have not the money to get it and it isn't available in my town. Oh well. Maybe I can catch it on a sale at some point. Good review!	positive

Great review, 5150. Although, you might want to resize your pictures before posting them so they don't take forever to load. Quote Wow. I was skeptical of this Coast Guard line. I was actually the complete opposite. Ever since I saw the first pictures, I fell in love with the whole line. The helicopter looks to be one of the two best in the line, right up with the 4WD and Jetski. Great job TLC, and I do hope you have something equally as great planned for next year.	neutral

Klaus-Dieter There is no real way to lift up the stretcher. Due to the crane arm being in the way there really isn't any room for any kind oflifting straps. The set does include a 1x2 plate with a hinge for the diver to stand on so at least he can hold on to someone, the crane lifts them up and then he can put them in the strechter. Thats my guess at least. As far as the motor, i don't believe it uses bateries since you pull out the motor, and all the button does is recoil the winch line back in. I have to say it does a very good job of that, and is very smooth. (as long as you don't have anything to heavy) One detail i forgot to meation is the shark. Its nothing new, just the basic shark lego has had around for nealy 2 decades, but it was a detail nothing less.	neutral
Nice review! The helicopter reminds a Sikorsky chopper,isn't it?	positive
I could tell from the pictures that a lot (maybe all) the designs on the raft were stickers. In the whole set are there any printed parts besides the torsos or is it all stickers?	negative
All stickers i'm afraid. Though i'mnot a fan of stickers myself. Some sets (like Ferrari for example) take longer to put on than building the actual set. This one is not as sticker heavy as it seams though, and the ones that areon there really give the set that extra touch. Printed would have been preffered of course, but in this case i didn't mind it.	negative

That's a very nice set. I'm having my doubts about getting it though still. The overall shape and size of the helicopter remind me of the real-life CH-53 military cargo helicopter. A very nice review. You've got the photography down very well I feel. Perhaps a bit of nitpicking but at the end where you assign a rating, if you do a rating with faces (which is fine by me) you may want to seperate the faces by a line. Otherwise it may become too crowded to the eye.	neutral
This is a very good review, thank you! But I have some questions about the grey new parts in the life raft. Are they 1x1 like their counterparts with the clips or 1x2? And can they be held by a minifig by the handle? If so, these could be very useful for brick-build weapons & tools! Also, I'm looking forward to some orange ETA 2 Jedi Interceptor MOCs now! Who wants to be the first to make one? BTW, which Jedi has an orange ETA 2?	positive

I'm rather fond of helicopters and have built many different types. This doesn't really remind me of any particular model, other than perhaps an EH. 101 Merlin and even that resemblance is very superficial. Just for the record: this is a Sikorsky Sea King and this is a Sikorsky MH-53 (a derivation of the CH-53). The only resemblance I see with the former is the colour scheme and with the latter the fact that it's got a fat rear-end, sponsons and six blades. It doesn't matter though, because I really like it. The colour scheme is great, the shape is nice, it's got quite a bit of detail and I just have to get my hands on the cockpit window and those new rotor blades. When I first saw the large aircraft pieces a few years ago I figured they were very much single-use parts, but the tail end doesn't look too bad. Pretty clever. I like the raft too. It really does look like the real deal. That the helicopter can't lift it really isn't an issue, because in real life they wouldn't lift the raft either. They'd use the rescue hoist to lift the occupants of the raft into the helicopter one by one (or perhaps in pairs). Imagine a storm with a helicopter hovering over tall waves with a big fat raft strung from a cable underneath it. The raft would catch a lot of wind and flop around quite a bit, causing it to loose all its occupants and also yanking the helicopter around, possibly causing the pilot to loose control and crash.

Thank you for clearing that up I felt that it was OK to review an old topic, as stated, rather than just go ahead and start a new one. A shame that this set, as all other Batman sets, have gone up so highly in value but still all things considering (general after market Lego price hikes) it is still a wonderfull set even with its market value today (that is if you can ignore the MRSP).	positive
I too thought the Joker's van was the pleasant surprise of this set. The Tumbler looks good yes, until you see it in person... it's grossly oversized. They should have made it closer to a regular car size (like the movie), because this one is a monster.	neutral
I bought this off ebay, while not having been collecting space as a child, it was mainly Wild West and City... I have decided, upon reading KDog's M:Tron Bar Brawl Mania strip in his Space Comic, to buy as many M:Tron sets and figures I could find.. except I got distracted and bought some different sets as well... To start off with, here's a picture of the box: Here's a general shot showing the entire set: A front view: The buggy: Another shot of the buggy without the minifig: The flyer: The flyer without the Minifig: M:Tron crate with some equipment and hoses, I don't know the use of the hoses though : The cockpit open: The cockpit closed with the crew: The Magnetic crane: Another shot of the Crane: Rear View with Hatch open: One of the side slots that can carry either the Buggy or the Flyer: Top view of this excellent Vehicle: Excellent for getting Spyrius or Blacktron out of your way : Final shot: Excellent set, one of the biggest space ground vehicles and one of the best sets made by LEGO. Undoubtably better than it's newer counterpart the MT-101 Armored Drilling unit.... A great addition to any collection and has a lot of cool neat features that make it have a lot of playability. Simply excellent! Five out of Five!	positive

It is just so dense when you build it, full of nice surprises, no technique required, and a wonderful stearing mechanism that I rank as more important than the suspension of the mars version. This thing was meant to crush anyway, who needs suspension? I also like the way you never felt that the M-trons deserved a base after building this, it was that good...

Fun review, thanks! Kinda sad to think that with TLC's recent ban on magnets in their products, we'll never see an M:Tron revival ...	neutral
I love the design of the front canopy of this set, but I always felt that they could have done more with the rest of the model. This set is good candidate for customization though. There is quite a bit on unused space inside, especially in the middle section. I want to try putting a Technic-style engine into mine at some point, along with the necessary gearing. I got my MCM brand new off ebay some years ago for a pretty good price, but the box was very worn out and the big trans-neon panel, which floats freely inside the box, was a bit damaged. As for the hose/jetpack things, I always assumed that they were either welding torches or flamethrowers. Take your pick.

Fluyt, on May 28 2008, 01:56 PM, said: Since when is that? The new train couplings have magnets, only with a special casing. You're right, I should have clarified -- it's the old loose magnets that apparently are being discontinued, not all magnets altogether. As you noted, the new train couplings still have magnets, but they appear to be permanently attached to a fairly large housing, which I guess will prevent kids from eating them. But the old M:Tron round magnet pieces are presumably discontinued.	neutral
Sinner, on May 28 2008, 11:35 PM, said: Care to explain why? Personally I think that aside from the colour scheme the new one is far better. Why? Suspension, more enclosed cockpits, bug-like appearence.... I suppose it's a matter of personal opinion though. I Just thought that the MT-101 was very skeletal and couldn't really steer that well, although I do like it. Also the MCM has a better design, in my view, as the wheels are closer together, making it look a lot more tankish than the MT-101. Also space in the rear isn't wasted on having a shuttle.

The only thing that bothers me is the lack of (reachable) controls for the minifigs to drive their vehicles (but iirc it is the same with a lot of other space-sets as well) yeah they could have used the normal levers instead of the pronged two piece things at the front of the cockpit. But there is certainly a lot to mod. Joebot, on May 29 2008, 04:25 AM, said: But the old M:Tron round magnet pieces are presumably discontinued.

It looks like you're right about the old magnets. I got a few off PAB two months ago but they no longer have them. I guess I should grab some while they're still widely available on Bricklink, as they can be useful in a number of situations. On a side note, one interesting thing about this set is that it seemingly had two US/Canada names, Mega Core Magnetizer and Multi Core Magnetizer. Brickset, Lugnet and all the other sites I've seen call it Mega, but I have some North American catalogs from that time period that call it Multi and the box also says Multi on it. I actually didn't know the Mega name at all until many years after the M:Tron line.	neutral

Asuka, on May 30 2008, 02:17 AM, said: Of course I don´t want to offend some Technic lovers, and although I always was more the System kind of guy, why can´t they just use some technic beams with studs at least?

This super set contains many of the city sets you can get for your mini city hospital. The smallest set is the 7902 car with a doctor. I thought it looked a bit too slow. Here is a car you can build with the same bricks. The instruction manual for the ambulance does contain a picture of an alternate model, but it is actually quite hard to build something significantly different. This sets lacks some SNOT-bricks, so I had to be a little more creative and came up with this ambulance. It is more a hearse than an ambulance. The helicopter has a lot of slopes, so I built a speed boat for those special emergencies. Unlike the first two sets, I used far from all the bricks in this. This set does really have some great parts. The brickshelf gallery with some more pictures. Is anyone up to the challenge and build some alternate models of the last set in the super pack - The hospital?	positive
A great and very creative work, I especially like the speed boat and the smaller car, just splendid!	positive
Brilliant, a huge amount of creativity there. To do what you did with such limited piece counts is exceptional. They're at least as good as most of the alternate models Lego show on sets.	positive
Harley & Mistah J. I want to preface my review by admitting that I’m an unrepentant Harley Quinn fanboy. I’ve been enamored with the character since she first appeared in Batman: The Animated Series back in the 90’s, and I’ve since followed her misadventures through her introduction into the regular Batman series during No Man’s Land, into her own series, and even on the short-lived and not-so-good Birds of Prey TV show. So please excuse any pro-Harley bias. So, down to business. The 267 piece set retails for $30 US ($35 at Toys R Us) and builds up very fast and easy. It consists of Batman’s Bat Cycle, Harley’s Hammer Truck, and brand new Batman and Harley Quinn Minifigs. There is also no lack of weapons. In addition to the usual bag of Bat-accessories and guns, the set also comes with a pair of gray revolvers. Batman in this set has the new “armor” torso print and the hips are the same color as the legs, hinting that this is supposed to represent the movie style Batsuits more so then the traditional comic book “underwear over tights” look. Harley Quinn is a very cool looking Minifig, and I haven’t grinned so much at a new Batman character figure since my first Batman Minifig a couple years ago. The figure is very true to the character, and the torso has been accented with a few shape lines to try and distinguish her as a female despite the boxy body. Harley’s jester cap is an interesting new piece. It seems (to me at least) to be made of a slightly different grade of plastic then we’re used to. It’s molded in red and painted with black and white, and it comes packed in its own separate little baggie. I expect that this piece may have cost LEGO a little more then usual to produce. Harley also has a buildable accessory, a giant mallet. Sure, she can’t stand up all that well unless it’s held in specific ways, but it’s neat and most importantly, it’s funny. It’s especially fun for smacking the everloving crap out of other Minifigs with. The Bat Cycle is in bag number one and is a very fast build. This isn’t some little Japanese sport bike like Nightwing’s cycle. This monster is almost a car and seems to pack just the right amount of intimidation for the Caped Crusader to exploit. Thanks to the thick tires (two in front, one in back) it stands up just fine on its own and rolls very well. The huge exhaust pipes are a nice touch and give the thing a look of engine power. The only real flaw is the inclusion of the flick-fire missiles mounted on the sides. But, as with any LEGO model, they can be easily left out without hurting the look of the vehicle. The hammer truck is the bulk of this set and a lot more fun then it looks. Of the monster truck persuasion, the vehicle is designed and built with a surprising level of solidity. The axle mounts are particularly impressive. The big wheels and tires just beg you to drive this thing right over the Bat Cycle (or Batman). The mega-mallet gimmick is also a surprise. Not so much for its technical complexity, there isn’t any really, but for the fact that once you start turning the knob at the rear to swing the mallet back and forth, it’s really a lot of fun. There are some low points to the truck design. Again the flick-fire missiles are tacked on and there’s a cargo crate/bed set into the back for Harley’s loot of jewels. The crate would have looked a lot better molded in black. In brown it breaks up the look of the truck a little. Speaking of which, the look of the truck is very pleasing. The red and black Harley Quinn color scheme works really well on the vehicle. There are a few stickers here, and unfortunately, the diamond patterned ones are applied over multiple bricks. The rest, however, are great. Not only does she have an “I Love Joker” bumper sticker, but she has a Joker playing card taped to her dash, I guess serving as a picture of her beloved Puddin’. There is also a sticker for activation of the hammer, which boldly shouts HIT ME! This is a fun set. A neat new Batman vehicle and a big truck with lots of playability. The Harley Minifig is a must-have for any Bat-Fan and, if you only get one of the Batman sets this year, I’d recommend this one. The price versus piece-count on this set is a little bit of a deterrent though. This might not be the best set for collectors on a budget or people looking for something completely new and innovative, but anyone buying this for a child can rest assured that the kid will get your money’s worth out of the set through its play value. When added together and averaged out, the pros and cons of this set combine to give it a score of out of 5. Even if Harley herself is a clean 6 out of 5	positive

Quote Looking forward to the review, this looks to be the best of the new Batsets. *gasp* Are you kidding me? Honestly, I hate this set. The batbike looks far too blocky, and that Hammer Truck looks super shoddy and thrown together. The only real reason I'd get it at all would be for the Harely Quinn figure - but I'd probably just get her separately on Bricklink. Besides, the Tumbler and Robin's Jetski sets look far better to me. They actually seem to have great vehicle designs. No new villian figures, I know, but still some great old ones. Er, wait a minute... oh yeah, hope your review gives the real scoop on this kit, Deino.	negative

The '08 Batman sets look like a step up from the somewhat lackluster '07 sets. This looks like a very fun set with a whimsical sense of style very fitting with Harley Quinn's character. The price isn't great, but I guess you gotta pay for that Batman logo. On the downside ... I am so over the good buy vehicle vs. bad guy vehicle concept. I really wish TLC would get over this.

Hi all, so I was at "The Wal-Mart" yesterday and had the munchies and was looking for something to eat. Somewhere along the line, I stopped caring about food and decided to browse the toy department to see what they had Lego-wise. Usually, they have jack squat, but on this particular day they had a lot of new sets. I impulsively picked this set up, along with Harley Quinn's Hammer Truck and the new little campsite from the Indy 4 line. I must say, when I first saw images of this set I wasn't exactly thrilled or anything. I mean, I didn't really see anything particularly special about it, but after purchasing it, I must admit that I would consider it a must buy for any Lego fan. But enough babbling about myself. Onward with the review (my first of an official set)! In this picture, you can see everything you get with the set. I thought the box-art was pretty nice looking. The manual, on the other hand, took somewhat of a beating within the box, a common problem with most more recent sets. I do have to say that I wish they would at least make some effort in fixing this. They could just make a little thin cardboard "folder" to minimize bending and tears. For Batman minifig collector's, the highlight of this set are the Robin and Penguin figs. Previously, you could only get them in the pricey Bat-Cave set, but this set provides a much cheaper alternative. One thing you will notice, however, is that Robin's hairpiece is a new mold, as it is actually a black version of Mutt's hair (from the Indy 4 line). Personally, I think it actually looks better than the hairpiece used on the older version of Robin. As the Batcave had before it, this set comes with some bricks to make two cute (but deadly) penguins. They help add more charm to an already charming set. When you're finished building, you'll end up with a nice little assortment of extra parts; 1 black "cheese slope," 3 1x1 tile (black, yellow and white), a revolver, a technic pin, and a 1x1 red round plate. Here's Robin's Scuba Jet. It's nice and sleek looking. Notable parts of interest would probably be the green turbine engines. My only complaint on this one would have to be the use of decals on the 2x2 round yellow tiles. For that type of a part, printing seems as though it would have been the best way to go. Now for, in my opinion, the best part of the set...the Penguin's sub. This set has more decals than Robin's Scuba Jet, but they seem more necessary in this case. I actually wanted to put the decal's on the sub, as I think the it looks great with them. Obviously, it looks like a penguin, but wow, does it ever do it with style! It has a lot of interactive features, the first of which I will mention, being the periscope which raises up and down. And for the collectors of parts in new colors, it has a few parts in medium orange?, such as 2x2 tile. Here's a shot of the bottom of the sub. Another nifty little feature is how you can lift the top off and fit the penguin inside. And there is enough room inside, so that you can firmly place top on again, and without interference to the movement of the periscope. Another little feature is the rear spring-loaded missile. You just tilt the small lever toward the front of the sub, and it fires. And the last small feature are the flick-missiles on each side. Overall, this is a great set with a lot to offer for a decent price. A lot of fans might view the only drawback to it as being the use of decals, but if you plan on keeping the kit together they make it look really fantastic. Buy it if you can.

I´m glad that you changed your mind, a review of a burger wouldn´t be half that interesting for sure. It´s just a mediocre set to me, but of course it´s always cool to get important MFs in less pricy sets. I like the Penguin´s sub from the Batcave more, just because they did a fine job on resembling a penguin without using a sticker.... Robins craft looks fairly nice, but the most useful parts of the whole set, for me personally, would be those indeed very neat green engines. Yes, it probably would have been nicer if they would have at least done a brick built beak for the front of the sub. Unfortunately, I never got my hands on the Batcave set, so I never was able to build the original sub.	negative
Thanks for the review! I love this set, i didn't think it was much at first either, but i really love it. Another cheaper Robin and Penguin is great, and those nifty mini penguins are awesome. The spare pieces are even nice! I love Robin's little scuba jet, those green engines are very nice and I love it compactness. Penguin's sub is even better, at first I was annoyed at getting two subs but now I realise it means I can have a fleet of them I'll be sure to mod over those cannons though, but the details are very slick.

Will Spy Clops laser gun burn through the door in time, or will Dr Inferno simply use the lovely Agent Trace's enormous ponytail as an escape ladder to freedom? More importantly, will there be a riot in the streets of Lego City as AFOLs go apopletic at the thought of a 12 wide truck roaring through their ordered town layouts? Stay tuned! Part 1: The Box, Instructions, Parts As the largest of the Agents sets (so far), the box is easily the biggest. Trainee agents, examine the following three pics and see if you notice anything odd. Box front: Box back: Box middle: Spot it? That's right. The printed cardboard which has supposed to be the bottom half of the fold out middle section is on the back, slicing the ultra-large set image which would form the foldout in half . The way the cardboard is printed as one piece before it's folded I think this would be very hard to do 'accidentally' so suspect a major stuff-up somewhere along the production line. I bought this set off bricklink so would be very interested if anyone in the States who has seen these boxes actually on the shelves can tell me if this is common or rare. Basically I want to know if I should be annoyed that the bricklink seller didn't list this in the set description, or are they all like this? The instructions come in 4 booklets. The parts list comes in at 5 pages, which is a lot even at half-size pages ! Large images of the parts inventory are in this folderwhen moderated for anyone interested. Here's also some cute Agents-type artwork at the end of one of the books. Instructions show piece call-outs and are divided into sections according to numbered bags. As you'd expect for a set with 1100+ parts, this baby comes with a lot of bags. It's a treasure trove of dark blue. As well as the obvious large slopes and wall panels which make up the body and the roof, there is a wealth of smaller navy blue pieces as well - small 1x1 bricks, 2x2 bricks, 1x1 plates, 2x2 tiles, heaps of 2x plates, some slopes, 22x cheese pieces... basically anyone wanting a lot of dark blue should think about this set. The roof panels alone, for example, could provide a dark blue sea for a modernised Pirate MOC. 2 DSSs (Dreaded Sticker Sheets). Quelle surprise - stickers! The grey parts of the stickers here are metallic silver ink, which is a nice touch. Actually, as sticker sheets go, they're not too bad. Fairly subtle for the most part and the navy blue actually matches the bricks themselves. However, after looking at the sticker sheets I thought I was missing something. What about the pieces used for the projection screens showing Dr Inferno and the sharks - why weren't they on the sticker sheets? There must be another one! Frantically I checked and rechecked the box and flipped through all the instruction manuals to find the elusive 3rd sheet. Where was it? Ten minutes later I noticed something which had honestly never occured to me - THERE WERE ACTUAL PRINTED PIECES IN THIS SET! So obvious and yet so unthinkable. It's horrifying how years and years of Exoforce and Speed Racer set releases can mentally condition people's thought processes. Tut tut, Lego. What have you reduced us to? Here they are, folks - ACTUAL PRINTED PIECES. (Yes, I do believe this news deserves the caps.) I also noticed this nifty modification of the usual 2x3 cupboard - you can now fit drawers in it! Very clever. This may have been around in Belville sets for years for all I know, but it's new to me. The drawers slide in and out very well and the top one sits on slight indentations in the middle of the cupboard. Part 2: The figs! Our trusty agents - Charge, Chase, Trace and Fuse. (High powered agents don't have time for names of more than one syllable - that's why the bad guys always lose ). Chase and Fuse have the Mutt hair in black and dark orange. The lovely Agent Trace has an exquisite new hairpiece in dark brown, perfect for 'Rapunzel' themed MOCs. As you can see, her ponytail is loooong. Makes it hard to sit down, the poor girl. I feel sorry for all these female figs with such intricate hairstyles that they can never relax in an ordinary Lego chair. However, at least she has two breasts unlike the recent Harley Quinn fig. Compensation indeed. Seriously though, it's great that there's a separate torso print for the female character and this attention to detail is typical of the set as a whole. Three of the agents have reversable heads - nice touch with the headsets and I like the ID cards on their pants. Obviously the agents security system is based on some kind of crotch measuring device. This would make sense considering the conspicuous bulges in the pants of Dr Inferno's men (see the other Agents set reviews.) The villains - Spy Clops, Dr Inferno, Gold Tooth. Dr Inferno's hair in all it's glory. This is a great piece, although the orange colouring is a little rough on the front. It's so 3D, it deserves a back and side view (and indeed EB thread) all of its own. As mentioned elsewhere, this is different plastic to the normal minifig hair, but it doesn't quite feel as soft as the Exo-force hair. It doesn't fall off as much, anyway. The figs get 10/10 from me. Awesome hairpieces in great colours for the Agents and a sleek navy blue/ neon green uniform. The villains' faces are great and they are all very distinctive. The attention to detail is outstanding and it's great to see a Lego in-house theme with characters as memorable and cool as figs from the licensed themes . Part 3: The build The build is divided into three stages - the small vehicles, the front of the truck, and the massive command center section. (a) Small vehicles First up, all the small vehicles. We have a small flyer, 2 buggies, jet ski, and a speed boat - all in glorious navy blue with little bits of silver detailing. Top view. These vehicles are all simple, small and well-designed. Probably the weakest is the flyer, only because the cockpit looks a little large. In fact, the small flyer is probably the weakest element of 8365 overall, which tells you how good the set itself is! In various threads here, this set has been heavily criticised for being way out of proportion. There's a reason for that, as we shall come to. However, the existence of these small sets should appease some people. With the new coast guard sets, for example, all of these save the flyer wouldn't look out of place on a City beach with a little modding. Here's an example - agents beach party! (Spongebob couldn't help but crash.) The villains only have one small vehicle, but they've been well-served in the smaller sets, and this one is a unique and clever design. I love the triangular shape and the simple but clever technique of making the arch slopes meet up around the propellers. It's sort of insectile in black and orange, and looks very different from the usual assortment of helicopters etc. (b) Truck front This thing is a beast! Seriously, look at it. It's chunky and mean looking. You don't want to mess with this baby. The build is really nice. Like a lot of Star Wars vehicles, it's all based on technic beams pinned together. Unlike a lot of Mars Mission sets, underneath isn't ALL technic beams with some plates slapped on like a facade. The majority is a lot of plates and bricks which all fit together solidly. You can see from the detailing of 'cheese grater' slopes and silver pieces on the front how effort has been made to give this vehicle a distinct feel different to other Lego sets. Sure, the silver slope mirrors might be a bit too much for some, but this baby is all about attitude. You can imagine it roaring down the road en route to Dr Inferno's diabolical lair! After all, these sets are 'Agents' sets - nobody said they were *secret* Agents (c ) Command center - whole assembly Here's a view of the whole thing assembled - inside and cool details to follow at the end. It's kind of hard to show here as it is extreeeeemely long. This is indeed a big set. The build for the trailer part of the command center is fun and very satisfying. Yes, there are large pieces but there is also a huge amount of detail. It is also solid as a rock. I remember being annoyed building the big Ferrari truck a few years ago - everytime you looked at it, an 8 x 16 plate fell off. The Mobile Command Center is solid - even with the hinged roof and special features, it is not delicate at all. Kudos to the designers, again as it is mainly a brick build rather than a technic one. I also like how the command center part connects to the cabin - it's not a special piece at all, just a technic axle going through two circle plates, but it works and it's solid. (Please note I've been selective about which stickers I've applied during the build.) Top view: The rear: Here's an example of why I like the build: (a) the designers have enough sense to put a ladder so a minifig can climb up to the interior when the command center is open (b) notice that although the ladder clips at the top, there is an *extra* clip there in the middle purely to hold it in place so it doesn't flap around and holds firm. I don't know if most designers would even think to put a ladder there let alone go the extra mile and put a mechanism to hold it in place. Pure class. Oh, and notice the greebly detail stuff to the right there too. The other side. This is probably the other weak part of the build - the bricky gaps at the top where the hinge to open the roof sits. It's a little gappy but the set is so big you don't really notice. (d) And now for the fun stuff - inside and neat details! OK, so we've built the thing. It's big. It's blue. The top of the trailer itself would make a good warehouse MOC for a harbour layout. But what about inside? Is it any good? What about all those small vehicles from the start of the review? Where do they go? Well, I'm glad you asked. Because the solution is superb. The small flyer folds slightly and slides into place here: Lift off the roof and you're away! The large buggy and the speedboat go under here: The jetski slides out of the rear here, attached to its own little platform: And the small buggy goes inside the main cabin. There's even a crane so you can lift it down. So now we know why this set is so large! To fit everything in! It's amazing that this functionality doesn't affect the aesthetics of the set as a whole. But we still haven't finished on the details. The front section has a very easy-to-swing-open roof section and missiles: There's also a command section underneath the bit where the flyer lifts out: And now for the interior. I have to say I really like this space. Not only is it packed with great stuff, there's also enough room for minifigs to move around. I hate bases where the figs only have about 2 studs to actually stand and walk. Aquabase Invasion is a nice set, for example, but the actual functional space inside the base is teensy. Claustrophobia! You know within a week they'd be fighting to toss each other out of the airlock. No such problems for these suave Agents, who have plenty of legroom *and* the ability to launch missiles from their ceiling. The whole of the interior: Zooming in: Moving from left to right. First off, the medicine cabinet. Looks like someone's been leaving secret mission dossiers lying around. The projector area for mission briefings. Dr Inferno recently changed his hair colour from purple to orange, it seems. Why are all these minifigs so obsessed with their hair? The projector folds down when the trailer is open. Push the button and the light glows on. Now Dr Inferno's hair is orange again! This is one of my favourite parts of the set. It works a charm. The batteries for these lightbricks can also be replaced - instructions are in the manual. Agent Charge considers shark-fin soup for dinner. Did I mention these projection panels are printed? The detail is very fine too. The tool section. Laptops sit in the middle compartment. You get some flippers, yellow scuba tank and various implements. I'm so impressed that the helmet is pearl silver with a different coloured visor too - there's so much variation in the parts in this set, you don't get the sense the designers are using the same thing over and over to save money. It all feels luxe and top-of-the-line, just like the Command Center itself. Two laptops - yay! The aforementioned rooftop missiles: The Dr Inferno cage. Nasty electric shocks! Bzzt! (You can see my reviewing skills are burning out now - sentences.... truncated...) Another example of detail - nowhere else in the set is a 1x1 transgreen tile used - they could have used a 1x1 trans green cheese wedge piece as there are others in the set, but they didn't. How does Dr I get out? Flick that lever on the right hand exterior and the door pops open. Spy Clops the loyal minion awaits his master on the other side. And there we have it. Take a bow, guys! There's a lot of spare parts. A suspicious amount of dark blue small slopes but I checked the instructions and didn't see anything missing. I have to say, I do like the new policy (since Speed Racer I think) of including these small slopes as extras. Part 4: Overall Rating If you've made it this far, you've got more stamina than Dr Inferno's army of cyborg animals themselves! As I said earlier, this set has drawn criticism for the size of the truck. However, large vehicles do exist - I grew up in a wheat farming area and as a kid the size of the lorries that thundered past carrying grain was probably intimidating to me as this monstrous espionage machine is to the good citizens of Lego City! On top of that, it *does* contain a plethora of 4-wide vehicles inside ! Criticism of this set on the basis of size to me also seems misguided as this is basically a playset - and it is a very good one to boot. As you can probably tell, I love it to pieces and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone, whether for parts or for play value. Check out the parts list in this folderwhen moderated and you can see just how many excellent pieces it contains. A light-up brick, a flood of navy blue, metallic silver bricks - we're spoiled. 8635 is also an enjoyable build, with fantastic figs and top-of-the-line detailing. In a year when I've found City a bit disappointing after the run of great sets in 2006-2007, the Agents line has been one of the surprise hits for me and I can't wait to see what the designers come up with next.

Yay! I was waiting for this to be reviewed! Can't wait to see how it is, I love the look of this set EDIT: Wow! Fast going on the review there svelte-corps, I love the look of the instructions. Batbrick Away! Edited by Batbrick, 31 May 2008 - 06:10 AM.	positive
Man I was hoping to be the first to review, ordered from TRU 2 days ago. Oh well this set looks sweet, can't wait for your review.	positive
Man, tohse mini vehicles and minifigs are sexy as all heck! I love Dr.Inferno and the female pattern for Agent trace (is it just me or she almost "busting out"? ). I love the Dr. Inferno hair, and the reappearance of Spy-Clops and Gold Tooth is simply gold (yes yes, pun intended!) I have to say this is shaping up to be one of my favourite sets, well, ever! Batbrick Away!	positive
can't wait for the kick @$$ trailer review :D	neutral
Me want this set	positive
That's an AWESOME review. And a great set, it seems. With all of this year's Star Wars (I still haven't got Rogue Shadow) I can't afford Agents too, which is a shame looking at this.	positive
Wow! Great review of what seems to be a great set. I love that ponytail. This looks to be a must have set! (It probably won't stay together for long though...) Thanks very much. (I fixed the header for you; that's two you owe me. The other is for making me think that this set was in Australia... )	positive
Thanks for another wonderful review, svelte_corps A very fine set indeed, I absolutely love the way all of the vehicles fit into the command centre, very clever. The projector is really cool, it looks very nice. It's great to see these light and sound bricks in the Agents sets. All of the little nooks and crannies in the centre are great too, I really love the amount of detail featured, mixed with all of the playability of this set. The minifigs - as usual - are brilliant, the uniforms look fantastic. Dr Inferno looks especially great, I love his white suit with hints of orange, and who can forget his hair? I'm really tempted to buy this beast now, though I'm not sure my wallet will forgive me for it. I suppose I'll have to cut back on Indy and Castle multiples for now... Thanks for the truly great review, svelte_corps, nice work	positive
Wow this set looks so amazing! Amazing! Genius! Da'vinci art I say! You've done an excellent job reviewing, and really, this is the review I've been waiting for. So cool! So classy! I love the mission briefing feature. To think that lego could go so high as to put something ingenious like that in there! Too bad Lego figures don't have fingers to make shadow shows, eh? Genius! The Jet lauching feature is pretty slick, and they even put a control center in there too! That's beast. Loving that. The bottom...I don't see how that big buggy can get out or in there, but, Awesome too! The back of the truck could use more detailing I think, but the jail pop-open feature is pretty cool, as is the speed boat storage rack. Cabin; it's great! That roof opening feature is a great part of this set. Also I think you can have multiple figures up there...maybe you can mod it to put a bed in there! It certainly looks big enough! Inferno plane, wow that think is smooth, baby! I love how the wings contain rotors inside of them!!! That's awesome detail right there. That is a sweet ship thingy, so slick. The rest of the command center is pretty awesome too; we get a 4x4 wheeler and a crane, and lots of room! Wow! Just wow! Great review, great set! You are well worthy of your custom title! I'm gonna go buy this for only $90!!!! WOOT!	positive
Wonderful review - one of the best I've ever seen on this site. Man, we thought this might be the weakest set in the line, but it turns out it may be the strongest! Everything about this set - from the color scheme to all the details to the minifigures to the piece selection - is just wonderful! I think this set has finally confirmed it: Agents is everything Alpha Team wasn't, and is how they should have done a spy theme from the start. Kudos to TLC for finally getting it right - and I sure hope there's a second year!	positive
wow, excellent review, thanks. That set sure looks fantastic. It's incredible how much features they've managed to pack in while keeping it roomy. I'm really impressed by the quality of the design. TLC is sure getting back on track with great design. ow... 2008 is going to be expensive...	positive
Excellent review by an excellent reviewer on and excellent set. This theme really does seem to be one of TLC's best. Edited by Plural, 31 May 2008 - 03:24 PM.	positive
I first I thought the whole Agents line would not be very good. But boy have I changed my mind! This set looks amazing, as do all of the other sets in the line. I really like how the small vehicles all fit into the truck. I don't like it when sets come with smaller vehicles and don't have anywhere to store them, so they just float on the side. That light projector is fantastic! I can't believe they are actually printed! This is definitly on my to-buy list! Thanks for the amazing review!	positive
7645 - MT-61 Crystal Reaper Piece count: 600 Price: $AUD79.95, 49.95 Euros (in most countries), 39.99 GBP, USD 49.99 It's happened in the wider world, and it had to happen to Lego - yes, the 80s are back. Space invaders, holograms, compulsory seat-belt wearing legislation, and the return of classic Space. Ok, we don't have a fully fledged classic space theme back yet, but if 7645 is the way of the future, I think Lego is ready to do it properly. I wasn't a huge fan of last year's Mars Mission sets and only picked up a few on clearance, but this set is light years (excuse the pun) ahead of 2007's offerings. This mining vehicle is solid, compact, and well-designed. It looks impressive, and even better, it has fantastic Power Functions operability! Behold 7645 - MT-61 Crystal Reaper! (PS I wasn't joking about the holograms or seat belts.) Part 1: Box, Instructions, DSSs (Dreaded Sticker Sheets), Parts Front of box: Back of box: 2 x instruction booklets: DSS numero uno - for the Reaper DSS number two - apologies for the blurry pic but I wanted to capture the sweet shimmy of the metallic holographic background on this sheet The way it catches the light really makes a difference to the small alien craft and makes it look much more interesting from the plain stickers of last year. There's heaps of spare silvery stuff once the stickers are applied for those who use the leftover sticker material for customising. Parts bags - 4 numbered with one extra with larger pieces Parts everywhere - woo! I know the Lego instruction books scold me if I mix bags, but I'm a devil-may-care kind of guy. In your face, TLC. I love mixing all the parts together before I build, it reminds me of my youth when the days were long, anything was possible, and I didn't need strict instructions not to build on grass or poke my eye out with a technic shooter. Interesting parts - these may or may not be new, my technic knowledge is not that detailed. The little scoop parts are so cute and have a heap of potential uses. I love 'em. They're like Smurf hats at Miniland scale. These technic wheel things in orange are also cute. They kind of remind me of marigolds. Giant Fabuland marigolds! The track pieces - you get 70 of these - here's the section of track for one side - as you can see it's about 52 studs long. These hold together better than the small ones on the Hailfire Droid/ Jungle Cutter. Part 2: Minifigs, small mining transport, alien ship I have to confess - I forgot to take an individual snap of the astronauts . It's the usual bunch though - Scaredy Face guy, Sunglasses in Space Man and a third one I can't remember. You don't really care, though? You're only interested in the alien commander and his matching arms/ legs combo deal. As brickbitz noted in his review of the smaller set, the glowy eye is just a 1x1 cylinder. The set also comes with 2 normal jellies - one pictured here for size. You'll see what happened to the other one soon enough... The alien craft is nothing exciting, apart from the gorgeous glinting stickers. Here's the road safety angle. The commander actually clips onto a 1x2 plate with handle so he can't fall out! Then the lime tentacle thing descends on top of him to keep him firmly there, like a baby seat. Not very brave for an alien commander, is he? I mean, did Darth Vader ever use a seatbelt? Tssk. With cradle up: This part of the build also includes the small astronaut mining buggy - small and effective. (Please note in this build I've applied stickers to everything bar cockpit pieces.) This comes with radio and saw piece. Part 3: The Reaper! The first part of the build is the detachable shuttle. I really like the retro aesthetic of this with the angled wings and the side hoverpod things. It is much better than the comparable vehicle from 7699. The new flickfire piece is a waste of space - it's fairly limp. I prefer the simple flickfire technic pin to be honest. There's also a very nice little side workshop as you can see. I really like how the control unit is 'plugged' into the wall via 5 1x1 round plates (third pic, it's a bit dark). Great detail. [The technic pins on the back are there to connect the Power Functions battery box. It's odd they're included at this stage of the instructions - maybe the intention was to release it originally with all the necessary motors etc but the price point was too high and they scaled it back] The base. The shuttle sits on that bley technic axle in the middle when the Reaper is fully assembled. The little vehicle scoots down the ramp at the rear, which folds up to hold it in place when the Reaper is in motion. You can see there's a crystal container here as well - another nice small detail which I found the 2007 sets lacked. There's also an alien here - thankfully not in those horrendous trans-orange tubes so prevalent last year. The complete assembly. Isn't it snug? It's just the right size too - not massive but large enough to be a serious mining vehicle. The ominous black treads contrast nicely with the white/ orange colour scheme of the vehicle itself. The trans detailing - blue for weapons, neon green for energy - is carried nicely through the whole set. The blades and the scoops whirl nicely as the machine trundles along. Top down view: Tread detail: Whirling blades of death! The buggy descends: Probably the most disturbing aspect of the whole set is this pic: The jelly has an orange pump plugged into its heart which is connected to an energy supply on the left hand side! This vehicle runs on alien jelly juice! Either that or it's milking the jelly in some equally disturbing fashion. How amoral is that! I know there's been debate about this - the jellys aren't innocent, they're evil energy crystal thieving maniacs etc - but I find it a bit odd that the humans respond by chaining the jelly up to the bowels of their mining vehcile and suck energy from its heart. People debate about violence in Lego as represented by realistic minifig weapons, but I think the moral lesson here is even worse - it's OK to exploit foreign life forms for our own gain if they treat us badly first! (Who-fans, I think the Ood should have a word with the jelly Commander ) That aside, this set is well-designed and fairly good value at $AUD79.95. It's definitely a notch above last year's Mars Mission sets overall, with improved detailing and more useful functions. The holo-stickers are fab and it's nice to have an alien commander, even if he is a bit bulky and his fingers are identical to his toes. However, if all these reasons by themselves weren't reason to recomend this set, the following is.... Part 4: Power Functions The best part of this set - and the reason I bought it, really - is the integration of Power Functions. Bizarrely this isn't mentioned at all on the box and I only found out about it from the instructions when they were posted on Eurobricks! (Instructions for book 2 which has the Power function stuff available here.) This is a great idea and hopefully we will see more new sets take this kind of approach (especially with the new Train sets). Luckily I got Monster Dino 4958 on sale for half price earlier this year so already had most of the necessary motors etc - the only one needed was an extra small one. What you need is listed in the instructions below with redirections to Shop @ Home to buy the motors. Note there's actually a mistake on this page. The 2 small motors you need are both 8883 not 8882 (which is the large XL motor). Way to confuse the kids there, Lego! Attaching them was a dream and only took a few minutes (In contrast to 4958 where it was almost impossible to remove motor elements without dismantling the model). Basically the back platform and some plates and orange slopes come off, you attach the motors, and then the smaller plates go back on. These parts are now left loose: Overall the look of the Reaper isn't badly effected as you're mainly viewing from the front anyway: Sadly I can't show you how it moves, you'll just have to trust me that it does ! The way it is steered is demonsrated in the instruction pages above. Basically each motor is controlled by a corresponding switch on the remote. Move them both forward to move forward, move one right to turn right, move both back to move back etc. It zips along! It's a speedy little thing! Personally I wouldn't want to be in it's path as it comes roaring down the Martian canyon! (My cat was scared as it was.) It is oodles of fun and definitely worth trying if you have the motors or can get them cheaply, and adds a whole new dimension to the 'play' aspect of 'playset'. It is also as I said very quick to switch between modded and non-modded Reaper in contrast to the more fiddly Dino creations. The only problem I had is that if it moves too fast, the weight of the battery box at the back tends to pull the whole thing back and it rears up. It does correct itself though. I only trialled this on carpet last night so it may behave differently on other surfaces - I will need to experiment! Part 5: Summation This is a great set made even better with the addition of Power Functions. At $AUD79.95 it's well-priced. Buy it! Buy the motors as well (K-Mart still has stock of 4958 at $89, wait for a 15% off sale)! You won't regret it. Buy 2 and make competing battle machines! The only thing is... just don't torture that poor jelly Edited by Sinner, 24 June 2008 - 03:25 AM.	positive
Another great review. I'm looking forward to getting this set sometime soon. I wasn't aware of the power function aspect, similar I suppose to the old technic sets which had an additional instructions for those with the relevant motors. I knew those dino's I got at clearance would come in useful. Nice to see the recent "bulldozer" treads appearing in black. Grey seemed a slightly unusual colour choice.	positive
nice review the power functions is a nice idea and i ownder if it will appear in any other new sets? regarless if i get this (i decided to just to get what ever looks good in the shops from now on ) im defianltey picking up some of the white visors off bricklink	neutral
Thank you for that fine review, svelte_corps. That´s a pretty cool set, much more solid than the Armoured Drilling Unit, with a nice little transporter and some for sure pretty interesting additional power functions. A very smart idea indeed! Did I miss something or is there really only one (and probably improved) shooting device? And there´re even some levers to control the vehicles.... wow. A matured MarsMission on indeed! Now let´s get rid of these poor utilized jellies and we´re right on the way....	positive
Isn't it a lovely set? I too have one. (modded, of course )	positive
Iron Moose, on Jun 4 2008, 11:28 AM, said: So, is there some way to get all those motor bits at once, or do you have to buy them on their own? I don't think I've ever seen them in a store here... Only from S@H so far, or if you buy sets which they come in. All the ones you need (apart from one additional small motor) are available in the 4958 Monster Dino set (which I got half price). I ordered the extra from S@H at the same time I bought the set - but only because I had already looked at the instructions and knew what I needed. (If people have the Ferris Wheel set as well I think the small motor comes in that.)	neutral
This should be reported to the news .	neutral
Well I guess its nice that they're making the story background a little more clear. With that jelly plugged into the power cable... Hmmh, both Jellies and crystals can be used as power sources, think theres a connection? both of them are transparent and greenish... Maybe Jellies hatch from crystals like eggs? or need them as food? or something important like that? Yay for evil humans.	positive
Thanks for the great review Sveltecorps. I bought some of the MM last year and ended up selling them off for SW. This new set has got me interested in MM again, partly due to your cool review! One question though, Did you get this set in Aust shops or S@H, just wondering if i should be looking for it yet? EDIT: sorry just saw your other post saying it was ordered from S@H Cheers ISC Edited by I Scream Clone, 04 June 2008 - 08:08 AM.	positive
Excellent review. Loving. This. Set. I mean, come on, it's a flipping tank! Awesomeness is written all over this - from all those blades and scoops at the front to the mini rover. And yes, you can even turn it into a motorized battle tank! Reminds me of the old technic days when they advertised in the manuals how to hook up the kits with separately sold motors. Another day, another review of an awesome set. Yes, this is sure TLC's year!	positive
Really Nice review! I love those sweet looking power functions on it, if only the orange bits could be replaced, then you could have a futuristic and motorized Jungle Cutter Anyway, the alien bit was disturbing, but the overly-tall new commanders look very, very cool! All in all, a great set, but I won't be able to buy it, because, in a few days, S@H will become 600$ richer and my wallet will writhe around in pain on the floor.	positive

Thanks for the review. I really like all the Mars Mission sets this year. The usage of the big wing is a bit annoying, but you can't blame LEGO for re-using the mold. I've been considering doing the same with mine! Mr. Mandalorian, on Jun 4 2008, 02:19 PM, said: So, that's all folks. Shall I include one last "bar" joke? I wouldn't have a bar of it...	neutral
Thanks for the review, Mr. Mandalorian! This is an, er, interesting set. Lots of frontal fire-power. Very big too, and I like the idea of those two little craft that attach on the sides. Sort of like little escape pod things. Anywho, not one of the things on my to buy list, but I do like that radio-active sticker, that could come in use. Looking forward to seeing your modifications, too! ~Peace	positive
Thanks for the great and very detailed review. I love the new holostickers! I'm still not sold on this set though. I'm not sure why... I think it's the big wing piece and the too-technicy build (from looking at the instructions). The platform seems kind of out of place. And for the size of the set, the functionality doesn't seem as good as it could be. It reminds me of 7699 Armored Drilling Unit - looks impressive but doesn't seem to do that much. I do think Mars Mission has improved this year though. Bar none, this is the weakest of the new MM sets I think.	negative
Mr. Mandalorian, on Jun 4 2008, 01:19 AM, said: And then we have this thing. What is it? Defense laser? Communications array? Satellite T.V.? That certainly feels like an homage to the Deep Freeze Defender... which itself feels like an homage to the Galaxy Commander. Is there some way to centre one of the cockpit units without massive de- and re- construction?	neutral
Thanks for the review Mr. Mandalorian. The Alien craft is a bit small in my opinion could have done with being just a little bit larger. The main craft however despite its few minor flaws looks very good. While space isn’t my normal theme I’m certainly being tempted this year.	positive
Iron Moose, on Jun 4 2008, 02:34 AM, said: That certainly feels like an homage to the Deep Freeze Defender... which itself feels like an homage to the Galaxy Commander. Thats the observation I had when I saw the first pictures of this set online a few months ago. I am a proud owner of the 6973 Deep Freeze Defender and 6980 Galaxy Commander, so I'm looking forward to see how the 7644 stacks up next to them. There is a definite lineage here, and these sets clearly demonstrate the evolution of Lego set design over the years. The MX-81 may not have the most playability out of all the new MM sets (although it has ALOT from what I can tell), but its hard to beat the look of a large sleek space cruiser sitting on your shelf or dresser, at least for myself. Anyhow, this is my first post to the forum and hope my welcome won't wear out here anytime soon. Edited by Spacefan, 04 June 2008 - 06:43 PM.	positive
Thanks for the review. I have to concede this does appear to be the weakest set of the summer MM lineup. I've noticed a trend that the larger sets have plenty of parts potential but when assembled the model is not more than the sum of the parts... Eagle Base certainly didn't seem worth the asking price, at least this is one large model. On a positive note the lame aero tubes, darts and martian carrier pods have disappeared. Don't get me wrong, I love MM and most of the lineup is great, this one just seems to fall a little short of the BAR.	neutral
I don't understand why there's so much negativity... this is actually my favorite of the new MM sets. The finished look is very sleek and not very gappy at all. The deployable landing pad is great, and it'll make it easy to put on a shelf without taking too much room. Lots of greebles... although I will concede that it's just begging to be modded. Still, though, I'm definitely buying this one. :) It has a really great look to it!	positive

Two more questions: 1 - how stable is the entire craft when balanced on the platform? Is there a chance that it will just collapse? 2 - what are the total wingspan, height and depth measurements of the model?	neutral
Hm, needs more firepower.	negative

Iron Moose, on Jun 4 2008, 02:15 PM, said: Do tell. (I'm being curious, not confrontational. ) Well, first and foremost like many other people I'm no fan of those dreaded unprinted minifig torsos and stickers. But also the cost to piece ratio of the set, it just seems too expensive for everything that you get, such as too many small parts and a lighter than usual piece count for the price. Though if it had included printed minifigs and other elements, I maybe would of been able to swallow its 100 USD cost a little easier. But Star Justice is still Lego SPACE in the most classic sense thats available today, and I will probably pony it up just because... Anyway, I hope were not breaking Forum protocol by not discussing the 7644 review of the original poster or that particular set in general.	neutral
Thanks for the review. I actually quite like this. I can't afford it, so I'm not getting too attached to it, but in its own way, it's great. It's certainly reminiscent of Space sets of the past, as others have said, and the drop-down ramp section is just really cool. As an idea, you understand. Sure, the lab is a little crap, but at least the effort was made (sort of ). The sheer fact that it's so big though, really makes me like this. There's just something appealing about large spaceships. Not capital ships, just big space ships. With lots of guns! Spacefan, on Jun 4 2008, 10:34 PM, said: Anyway, I hope were not breaking Forum protocol by not discussing the 7644 review of the original poster or that particular set in general. Hey, it's no worse than Batbrick and I. No, really, it isn't even in the same league!	positive
Thank you for that nice review, Mr. Mandalorian. Wow. Somehow it´s almost like Classic Space´s back indeed.... It´s a great star ship. It looks stream lined, original and impressive and even the huge plane wing part looks rather cool and smooth on it. It´s equipped at least with some kind of engines on top of the wings and although they´re made with only two a little 'juniorized' parts it´s better than nothing. There´s a lab or some sort of engine room with enough space inside to allow one or two MFs to play Scotty.... yeah! The two cockpits´re nicely detailed with a cool use of these orange 1x1 round plates and to detach one or all two of them reminds a lot of the playability of the good old Space sets. It seems even like it´s easy to attach them to some kind of Cloud City Twin-Pod Car thanks these hinged wings. Looks like some solid fun to me. Of course.... the cockpits aren´t airtight and even this reminds unfortunately of the post blue, grey and trans yellow era of CS. Anyway, there´s no real fun without some MODing I guess. Another great advantage of the set´s that it´s not overpacked with shooting things. One technic shooter, cool in grey and only one trans orange prison pod too. Well, I can surely live with that especially since it´s nicely asymmetrical. The drill rover´s very charming, a little like a rebuilt Oldsmobile Convertibe stranded on Mars. Sweet! And that platform feature´s plain nifty and well done too, very playable and useable for a lot of things. Hmm.... recently I complained a lot about the dense use of studless technic beams for the inner structure of vehicles like these ExoForce tanks par exemple which makes MODing (in an economical way) pretty frustrating.... but the beams here´re used in a very proper way. It should be fairly easy to MOD, let´s say, the back of that lab section up to perhaps even the cockpits to create a larger airtight area that could be boarded from the platform.... just to fit this certain spacers need for, um, realism.... There´re many more nice details too like that 'satelite t.v.' thingy and that cylinder with trans blue 2x2 dish for the knob or these cylinders with cones on that handle, and that Alien craft´s pretty nice and detailed as well. Like I said before.... I really feel like Classic Space´s back.	positive
Hey, thanks guys. So you tolerated the bar jokes and faded lighting? radiant7, on Jun 3 2008, 09:01 PM, said: I appreciate your review Mr. Mandalorian, but why the negativity?. I'd try to find more positives about the set instead of kinda criticizing it after each picture. I personally think it looks freakin' awesome!. The size is very impresive and I nearly fell of my chair when I saw the first pics earlier this year. It's quite unlike anything I've ever seen from Lego.

That said, having grown up with Lego during the 80's this set has a certain nostalgia factor in its overall look and feel that harkens back to that earlier period in my life which I fondly remember. Aside from the Factory Star Justice set (elements of which I loathe), I expect the 7644 to be the closest thing to a Classic Space revival that we'll ever see again from the Lego Group, but I hope to be pleasantly suprised someday. Though I'm not living in the past, and do appreciate everything Lego is doing now and will do, and has done since. And, like you, I'm one who's definitely buying this set. No matter how few of us there may be. I'm sorry you guys thought I was being negative- I actually love the set. It brings a real feel of Classic Space to MM (No, I'm NOT talking in the third person. ). However, it does have its own small issues, which are nothing, really. I said that there's not much of a lab- but that's the beauty of lego. There's a lot of room in the ship, so it should be a piece of cake to mod to a bigger lab. Too many bars? I'll take them off. I really like the set, I just want to change it to suit my tastes. It looks beautiful- It will find a home among my other MM sets as a favorite. Iron Moose: Good question. It's about 17 inches wide, 11 inches tall (with ramp down), and 16 inches wide. As for the platform, it's pretty stable. It tilts back a small degree so it doesn't collapse when tapped on the nose, but I wouldn't leave it on the edge of a table while in that position.	neutral
I think this thing is compensating the poor lab with the bar army.	positive
Hello SheFOLS and AFOLS, as well as TFOLS, welcome to EB News Reviews, I am your host...For tonight anyway... Shadows will take over after this episode, if we make more... Today we are reviewing Mars Impulse sets 5616 and 5617. Starting with 5617 Alien Jet, I must say it is a small and quick build, the jellie, is made of hard plastic, which surprised me, as I had expected Jellies to be a soft plastic. The jet is mainly 2x4 plates, some swingy hinges, the "seatbelt" and a thing which I cannot seem to name My one gripe about it is that the Jelly cant see where he is flying, it looks better with a MF in it. There was a red 1x1 as a spare part. We move on to the 5616 Mini Robot, which is basically a "safe" brick, with binoculars, soem cheese slopes, little arms, and legs. The best part i must say was the metal detector and "safe" brick, as these seem to be quite rare in sets (By my knowlage anyway). The austronaut has a face, shown in Dr. Sinsters review. The set also comes with a pick-axe and lime green gem. Extra peices where a cheese slope, a green 1x1 and a white droid arm. That concludes these mini-reviews. I also will use this opportunity to show my photo setup. Both sets are reccomended, if you either need a army, or are just trying to get a variaty of figs like myself.

I didn't see this one coming... Probably because that huge white beard got in the way! Was this "Shadows impersonates Aluvar" week or something? Ok, this wasn't the worst thing I've ever seen. We can try a real one in the future. The not too near, but maybe not too far future. I guess. Where is that a map of, anyway?	negative

Hello all Eurobricks members, I will be presenting my first review on one of the Harry Potter's set. Firstly, I must emphasize that I am not a very big Harry Potter fan or owned many Harry Potter sets. For this review, I will be highlighting what is the beauty of this small little set, and the reasons to own multiple sets of it. Comments and critics are strongly welcomed. This set is featured in the Harry Potter movie, Prisoner of Azkaban. This set is orignally released in 2004, align with the Harry Potter's movie. This was actually one of the movie scene where Buckbeak the griffin is appeared in the movie. The group of students are supposed to be having up close and personal with him. However, Draco decided to disturb our lovely Buckbeak. Enough of this movie synopsis, I am sure fans of Harry Potter will know this better. Box art Featured mini-fig/creature Background scene The scene is a simple garden, which had a very good mixture of spare parts for your MOCs building. On its own, there is nothing outstanding about this set, except for the griffin. You can buy multiple sets for the griffin alone and for Draco mini-fig. Well, you don't need lots of Draco. But for Castle lovers, black cap are exceptionally useful, at least from my view. Now, I will point out the following why this sets is so great for other reasons. Hidden cover Note that, this is the only mechanism which you can find in this set. It looks rather simple but quite useful. There are some little things hide in it too. Greens, Foilage and Brown parts Needless to say much, it offer 3 foilage, a green plant, 3 brown slopes, 2 ideal bricks and 1x1 brown brick for building a tree. Great for jungle building, forest building and etc. I am sure there are many builders will look out for these. Interesting parts It comes with a wizard book, owl, 2 printed tiles with a spider and stone prints on it. The far right, seriously I don't find any good use for it. Can any EB members enlighten me on that gray thing on the right? Grey parts It comes with a good 10 x 4 green plate. Useful for adding as a platform. Some more grey slopes for your MOCs. There you have it, Draco encounter with Buckbeak comparing with Deep Forest Ambush As you may remembered recently, there was an impulse set competition. One of my entries, which is under the History theme. The Deep Forest Ambush was firstly inspired by this set, and made an improvement out of it. Look at the improved tree compared with the orignal. Summary review Playability: 4/10 (Not much to play with, except swooshing around the Griffin) Design: 5/10 (Too simple and its defintely not related with the movie scene) Parts: 10/10 (Great for parts, explained by the review. A great deal of green and brown parts) Price: 9/10 (An inexpensive set based on the 2004 pricing) Overall: 7/10 (A must have for all Harry Potter fans and collectors whom needs a great use of green and brown parts) Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. More pictures can be found in My Brickshelf (When moderated) Let the Potter magic begans! Edited by WhiteFang, 09 June 2008 - 02:45 PM.	neutral
A very nice little review of a pretty nice little set that I wish I'd bought between 1 and 10 of. Just for the griffin. Oh well. Your review has shown me that it's useful for more than just that, so maybe I'll try to pick one up someday. Can't have too many black capes, books, or printed things. Speaking of which: WhiteFang, on Jun 9 2008, 09:41 AM, said: Interesting parts It comes with a wizard book, owl, 2 printed tiles with a spider and stone prints on it. The far right, seriously I don't find any good use for it. Can any EB members enlighten me on that gray thing on the right? The gray thing is technically a plume, like any castle plume, except in this case it's a feather (presumably from the griffin), and made from the mold to the old Indian feathers in the Wild West sets. It's a case of an old part coming back for a slightly new use, in a new colour. Beyond that, the "stone print" tile is a bundle or rolled up blanket or package, depending on where it's used. I don't think it's ever meant to be a stone. It was used as a rolled up pack on the back of the Star Wars speederbikes, for example. Nice pics, plenty of useful information. I'd give this review an A+ Thanks for doing it!	neutral
I own about 6 copies of this set!	positive
Thanks for the review, you made me very jealous... I want it also in multiple... But I don't own any of it. Oh, well for later then...	neutral
Thanks for that nice review of a really interesting and pretty cool set. At least, a Griffin, I guess, is pretty close to an unicorn or a dragon, huh?	neutral
Thanks for the nice review - it was one of the first ones I got when emerging from my dark ages . I bought two of these, just for Buckbeack - I thought he would make a good statue in a Persian temple type MOC. I also liked the minifig head pumpkin and plant part in bright green - both new pieces to me at the time. All in all, it was a good castle or forest building set with a nice selection of pieces for rocks, grass, plants and trees. The dark bley plume piece also now appears in the 10185 Green Grocer set as detailing on the roof of the turret.	positive
great review. nice set for plants, huh? too bad i didnt get thus set... but luckily my neighbor did! that griffin is nice for castle MOCs, and that orange head (pumpkin, i know) seems rare to me. not much else to say...	positive
Ohhh great idea to review the "old" Potter sets! Especially the line from Prisoner of Azkaban... I was in my Dark Ages then. Luckily I was able to catch up on the missed figs with one internet order. This Draco is the best TLC has made, if you ask me. The new one (also doubling for Belloq and "guards" in the Indy line) doesn't look quite as hautain as this one. Buckbeak looks cool. Looks like his neck/head can be moved, right? Rather similar to LEGO horses. Well designed. The orange brick doesn't have a pumpkin face on it, right? Unlike the one from Philosopher's Stone in the set with the troll. I'm looking forward to more reviews by you, sir WhiteFang! Good work	positive

I strongly agreed with you, that this Draco is the best TLC made. I pretty like the face compared to others. Furthermore, I used my multiple Dracos, for my castle armor guards instead. One could not have too many Dracos. Buckbeak design is well made. The head can be moved upwards and downwards. The mechanism is similar to the horse design. In addition, Buckbeak wings can be removed. Similar to the typical green or black dragon wings that we used to see in the past. Well, the main reason for me to buy this set was in fact Buckbeak. You don't often find a griffin lying around except in Harry Potter sets. Mr Spielbrick, on Jun 12 2008, 12:28 AM, said: The orange brick doesn't have a pumpkin face on it, right?

Hello EB! Yes, I'm cranking out the reviews! The other day I picked up this gem for an okay sales price at Devonport, Tas, while searching for the new Batsets. I informed iamded of this as he is a Spidey-suckup ( ) and he informed me this was the only set he didn't have of the Wave 2 of this theme. So I ask you great EB members to please remind him of this when commenting! Here we go with the review of Doctopus' lair: Anyway, unlike other reviews, this stars more people, the Batbrick-iamded-dragonator-Daisy review! (Daisy is the mouse that came in the set) First up re the figs, and I must say they are great. I love fleshies and these are excellent to expand my Batman world, plus having a Spiderman to beat up is good too Doctopus is great, though his tentacles are annoying to keep in order. Peter Parker is a nice addition, I love that torso. Eve though Harry Osborn was totally absent from this scene, I welcome him as he is a good fig also. Best of all is Mary Jane, fleshie females are hard to come by and I love that hair, my very first one! Oh, and even better is bley Daisy on the far right: Another fantastic thing is that by mixing MJ with Doctopus you get a far more deadly and real villain than anyone could've forseen - The Hippy! Oh c'mon, tell me that ain't cool? Anyhoo, here is a pic of Doctopus showing his might: Random fact: Did you know I influence both dragonator and iamded in their sigfigs? dragonator adapts his from my IA series while iamded added Mutt hair when I had him like that in a pic I posted. Now onto the box, sorry about the lighting. The art is good and the cartoon spidey in the corner may have beenthe inspiration for a similar style in the new Batsets: Back of the box. Again, sorry about the lighting and blur, it was gtting late and these were the last pics: Finally we get to the first part of the set: The catapult. Is that movie accurate or what? I love the part in SM2 when he uses his homemade genetic spider powered catapult to launch himself to the scene! Oh well, it does comes with a cool spider web an trans blue spider, so it gets some points: And it is really fun! I launched spidey several metres once, I don't think he ever recovered. Infact, he almost certainly webbed himself Slightly cooler extras are these two. This awesome little boat is great for city, as is the simple but nice bouy, Daisy approves: Naturally dragonator ruins everything when he found out the "dragon" that would be riding with him was our nickname for Daisy Now finally, the main attraction - Coctopus' Dock. iamded and I threw dragonator in the water to see if he could swim. He er, couldn't One Sweeney todd later, we continue! The overall construction of the building is very good. I know a lot of people hated stickers and i hated applying these, but they do look spectacular and perfect for any City setting, like a bank, a Gotham Bank As iamded has already noted below me the black lifesavers a very cool as are the web piece and log pieces: The inside contains the neutron copperplate triple bypass humdrum holy hum 5000, which does does, see movie. Anyhoo, it is very cool, and includes a little control thingy on the yellow brick next to it. Unfortunately, the inside is plain but for that: The other side has no wall too which is a bit of a letdown really, but atleast it allows Daisy easy access. one gripe is those yellow 1x1 bricks, they serve no purpose and break up the colour scheme: Better shot of the thingy thing. I quite like it, the use of technic parts actually works, and the whole set is worth it for those purple flames and dishes alone It closes up pretty well too, unable to hit the dish which is a nice feature: Me and iamded liked it so much we threw a revived dragonator into it. Unfortunately it disagreed with him, but it was fun: Another shot of the dock. I like how they have gaps in the jetty, I know the movie version was pretty wack, and although the set isn't very faithful to it (looks more like a seaside library to be frank) it still is very nice. This is my first large blue baseplate too which is wonderful, though funny how the set only uses about half of it: The roof is a well designed and fun feature, it uses some technic connections to render it flexible of any degree, as you can see here by my opening of it: Better shot of the roof design, it can lie flat or at any angle. I might use the design myself in the future: As much as I love the building this feature bugs me, for in order for it to work this wall has to stick out, which not only looks ugly but makes you be able to see through the corners. Still, easily modded, and log pieces are fantastic for mocing. It also means that there are 7 windows all up for a good, sizeable building: By pulling out the piece in the center the walls both collapss sideways outwards, which is actually pretty fun and works everytime: Overall view of the set including characters: Now for the story that makes no sense....at all: Spiderman is dead after falling down the wall mechanism (see above): Only Daisy can save the day! For dragonator is being held by the evil Doctopus! And iamded and dragonator are too busy not caring! And Brainbox is too busy complaining that this goes against all Marvel continuity! Unfortunately Daisy is on a lunchbreak so tough luck dragonator: And Daisy goes on a search for fortune and glory: Okay, this is what I think of the set: Build: 3/5 - Fun, but those stickers ruin the experience somewhat, and if you don't apply them the instructions are a bit hard to follow. Playability: 4/5 - Great little gizmos and bits, not the kind that keep you going like with the 2007 Aquabase, but good fun still. Design: 4/5 - Not very movie faithful no, but still a great little building and a smart design for certain aspects. Minifigs: 5/5 - Great figs with all different faces and very useful bits. Price: 2/5 Far, FAR overpriced even on sale sadly Total: 18/25 - A good set that could've been better with a few minor changes. Nothing wrong with it, but it doesn't really cross the line to greatness. That said, it has a lot going for it and definitely worth buying or atleast a look! Thanks for reading Batbrick Away!

Lookin' good so far! Though I must say it's Doc Ock, not Dok Ock... The catapult is, well, ridiculous, but the boat is very spiffy, and the buoy is a nice addition! I actually like the stickers on the window pieces, perfect for this building, and great for post-Apoc scenes. Black life-saver rings are a nice addition too.Anyway, hurry up dragonator and Batbrick!

I got this set in 2006 in a 'Byrnes World of Wonder' toy shop. I dont remember how much, but it was a deal. The box was all battered but it had everything. Good review Batbrick.	neutral
Thanks for the review, even if it is a number of years late. I picked this up whn it came out, and thought it was a rather cool set (besides the catapult). Plenty of cool pieces, and the baseplate has found a use in the Batcave. Although I think my dad managed to spill some beer on it at one point. That was awful to clean off...

Great review Batbrick, I was curious as to what the interior of the building looked like, I still think that there should have been a few random chains or something lying around as they may add to the abandoned feeling that the ware house had. Though I have to admit that I really like the roof dock and minifigs as some of them make good average civilians that are somewhat hard to come by in todays sets . Great comic as well it seemed to add a lot to your review, hope you can review another Spider man set soon . BTW as Adam mentioned I believe you owe me a bar of soap, for reading your review ...

Great review. The hippy and the "story" at the end were hilarious. I think this was easily the best of the Spiderman 2 sets. You're right though - it wasn't movie acurate, as the actual movie dock was far shabbier and more trashed than this. Ah well, I guess TLC couldn't do everything.	positive

Plenty of cool pieces, and the baseplate has found a use in the Batcave. Although I think my dad managed to spill some beer on it at one point. That was awful to clean off...

Thanks for the detailed review valentin it had good picture quality and a nice little comic near the end. Although this is a slightly older set it still was a good one, I remmeber that I bought two of them to build up a small airforce for the Republic, and if I see another one I may buy it for use in the Starwars Comic game.

Thanks for another great review. I remember getting a few V-Wings cheaper because the boxes had been crushed on their way to the store. Not an "all-that" set, but still a fine parts pack with a decent design. KimT	positive

It's from the container that can hold 100 CD-Rs. Hi WhiteFang, can't deny that they were once my fav. hunts for lego, and yes, that price tag is a tad hard to remove. Well, while am delighted at the V-wing, I still kinda wish it had come with a printed brick for its instruments panel.	neutral

Nice review, but I have to correct something for you: valentin, on Jun 15 2008, 09:53 AM, said: One thing is that there's no known release of the V-wing starfighter by hasbro, nor the other well-known brands. The other thing is that being a star wars vehicle collector, I would really loved to see a replica toy of the V-wing.

Here's the 3rd of the whole batch of complete reviews done back in 2006. Hope you guys enjoy them so far. Product: 6206 Tie Interceptor Theme: Star Wars No of pieces: 212 Release Date: February 2006 RRP: SGD39.90/USD19.90 Availability: Lego Shop@Home, Target, Toys 'R' Us (US & Europe), Bricksworld (SG). Lego.com said: Challenge the Rebels! Blasting out of Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, the TIE Interceptor is the fastest fighter in the Imperial fleet! Open the cockpit canopy and fold down the instrument panel to put the TIE pilot inside and recreate your favorite classic Star Wars battles! Includes TIE fighter pilot! Cockpit opens and instrument panel folds down! It does seem to have more pieces than the average tie fighter, but this is actually cheaper than the 7263 TIE Fighter. Of course, there's no light-up feature in this set. :sweat: YesH!! Finally... A... Tie Interceptor!! This is probably the most anticipated for all set for all lego tie collectors worldwide, since the fighter, bomber, advanced, and even the Expanded Universe droid fighter had been released by the Lego Group. This set is near movie-accurate, since the bottom part of it ain't. :p The cockpit and pylons uses the same design as that of the tie advanced piloted by Darth Vader. Except for one minor change, that is the aft interior of the cockpit is strengthen this time. And this is indeed good news, since the older models had a problem of hard hinge and loose brick connection. There's no landing gear for this set, but it doesn't require it anyway. This tie interceptor balances perfectly on its wings. Standard instruments panel and, of course, standard imperial pilot. The "swoosh-able" or play factor of this set is definitely very high... Just take a look. :D *Camera view from own craft* *Camera view from Tie-Advanced* *Combat simulation of Endor's Battle from the archives* No bomber, since I started late in re-collecting. :p To conclude, for a typical lego fan, this set is a 60/40, 60 due to it's good design, and for a typical star wars fan, this is a must-get. The only flaw for this set is the same flaw for any lego set in SG, the price. :doh: Comment(Current in 2008) Being a starwars fan... no... being a typical toy collector, space is definitely a premium... so much so that I turned to lego starwars to sate my appetite for more starwars products when I already have no more display space. For the next few non-lego pictures, they are the crown of my starfighter collection in 1/18 scale. So just view them for fun, eh? And no, I haven't had the chance nor the time to do up a scene of my lego starfighters blowing up spectacularly since the pieces would be very hard to put back... Hmm... then again, isn't that what lego is about. "doH".	positive

I picked up this set mainly because of the many (5+spare) glow in the dark parts and the promise of 2 racers and one helicopter for the price of a little more than two racers (90kr. vs. 2x40kr.) The box The back of the box shows the two alternate models you can build if the polybags rip. There are 3 cheese slopes and two 1x2 tiles that glow in the dark, where the tiles are exclusive for this set. The total parts count is high at 142, but there are no really big pieces among them. Inside the box you will find the building instructions, a sheet with some odd sticky labels (thrown away) and 3 polybags marked by the bag building difficulty. The models The lime colored car doesn't bring out anything new. We have seen racers built like that before, but it does contain some nice bricks for the collection. The police cruiser surprises with an interesting design along the sides as seen here. It is harder to build because of the greater level of details: The helicopter is without doubt the hardest vehicle to build in a bag. I can't finish it because it's larger than the bag. You can't put on the top blades nor the tail of the thing, so it beats the forklift from 7733 where the top bar is the new kind that doesn't completely fit. There is also instructions for the alternate models, but it requires the bags to be opened... The vehicles are pretty standard for the racers theme with the police car being the highlight of the set Conclusion I like the difficulty curve between bag 1 and 2, but the last bag should be labeled 1000000 instead of 3. It requires some inhuman skills to build that helicopter in the bag... ? Lime colored car: 3 - We have seen it before, but it has some nice pieces... and lime. Police Cruiser: 9 - It has a massive diffusers, rare parts and a high level of details. It is a shame LEGO relies so much on stickers. Helicopter: 6 - if you see it as a set for one fourth of the price of the cars, it is quite amazing, but you can't bag build it and I would personally prefer some more detail instead of the big size. Overall it is a nice little set, but the police car is the main attraction. I wouldn't get the other vehicles if they were sold separately.

why didn't you open the bags?????	neutral
it's called challenging one's self :-P plus you can resell it as MISB since it's still sealed in the polybags lol	neutral
Ahhh bag building... that takes me back. I suspect that if I didn't do my bag building topic my EB life would have turned out very differently. For the negative nancies, I suggest you try it. I bought a set just so I could, and I found it fun. (Not fun enough to do it again though!) Thanks for the interesting review.	neutral
adik_sa_lego, on Jun 17 2008, 10:02 AM, said: now now, don't judge people who do this. there have been bigger sets that were done in the bag. to each his own :) You make it sound like I did something deeply socially deviating... like being an adult playing with LEGO But back on topic. Open the bags? If they were meant to be opened, why did LEGO close them in the first place? Bag building is not for everybody. Some might become very frustrated with it and let their anger out on the set by lining it up on a mini golf course.	neutral
Nice review. But I think bag building is a boring way to build.	neutral
I bought a Tiny Turbos set(A No-No for me) after I saw this "Bag Building." It's actually pretty fun. I built it faster than I would if I had opened the bags!	neutral
Great review Indexing it, as I write this. How come You think the CTT is the AT-ATs predecessor? Do you mean the motorized AT-AT or AT-AT's in general?

10143 Death Star II Production year: 2005 Pieces: 3441 Minifigs: 0 Price: 299 USD peeron.com 10143 Gallery The Review Ph4tDuD3:"DS review!!!?!!! - u 2 kewl 2 do diz" Me:"Yes" Ph4tDuD3:"Kewl..do u have pix of the minifigs?" Me:"Erhm..what minifigs?" Ph4tDuD3:"The ph4t figs from the DS!!1" Me:"This is the other Death Star" Ph4tDuD3:"OMFG there's more than 1" Me:"Yes" Ph4tDuD3:"keeeeewl. must have!!" Me:"Goodbye" [pushes the incinerator button] Ph4tDuD3:"wut?! nooooooooooooooooooo..........." and on that note, let's start the reivew of the UCS DEATH STAR II. Now this is an older set (2005) and I've only gotten around to buying it a short while ago. It took me around 2 evenings to build it and I must say that I am fairly impressed by this set. Time for a box pic: The Build: Since I started building this huge (small moon size) set at Morten's appartment, I wanted to keep as few polybags open at any given time as possible. With this set it is actually possible to have a minimum of bricks scattered over a table or two while building. Not sure why, but the division of bricks in the different polybags just work very well. And that is great with a set this size - 3441 bricks. The building of the set is divided into several "Build this times x". For example the upper and lower part of the "unshielded" DS are completely alike. This is difficult to see when looking at the model, but heaven when building it: And this is how they solved the problem of having the wings connected to the buttom of the Death Star - geniously done IMO: Note that in the first pic the "skeleton" is easily seen. "The skeleton" holds the X to which both the upper and lower part is "clicked" on with technic pins. Also there's a steering wheel (I'm sure there's a pirate name for that ) like the one in the bottom, in the top of the model to hold the upside "wings". So after having build duplicate wings (upper and lower), the "belt" (all the way around the star) and the upper and lower part of the "unshielded" side, it was time to step back and watch the Death Star II in all it's glory: Such a great UCS set. Now I did have a few "huh's" during the build: HUH! #1 In the instruction the technic lesser-dragon-head should be dark grey, but I got it in light gray. Go figure and thank you replacement parts. I've experienced this before and apparently TLG uses different colours when "out-of-stock". All one has to do is call them and ask for the right colour and it's on it's way Still a HUH! experience. HUH! #2 Again it appears that TLG changed the design of the technic axleholed 1x2 bricks. The bottom has changed and I got the set where it was mixed up between "old" and "new" version. Not that annoying, but still got me perplexed as to: "Am I doing this right?" Kinda stressing to consider taking most of the star apart to check the remaining 231 technic bricks 1x2 with axlehole. Now for a verdict: : 1: looks great 2: even my "wife" likes it - female appeal 3: it's a great build 4: the polybags work for you 5: it's Star Wars 6: the design is awesome : 1: it wobbles if you touch it 2: very small parts come off, if you touch it 3: parts come off when you try to move it somewhere safe 4: zero swooshability So in short (yes even shorter]: The DSII is a well designed UCS set that has a great design. Like most other UCS sets, it is not meant for play - hence don't play with it. UCS verdict (the numbers) 5/10 (design++/instructions+-/bricks+-/sturdiness--/colourscheme+-) design: awesome look and great greeble set instructions: easy to follow steps with bricks mentioned hard to see wether it's black or dark grey bricks: loads of great bricks a zillion bricks of the same type sturdiness: DON'T TOUCH colouscheme: grey in grey with a little touch of black Need a missing instruction? Then click the logo	positive
Thanks for the review KimT - it comes at a... confusing time You can take off the top disk and lift it like the Millennium Falcon from the top Now. I actually don't like this set that much. It takes about 5 hours and 15 minutes to build if you do it in one go, but the repeating sections makes this built the most tedious I have experienced. It has way too many holes from which you can see the colorful skeleton and is overpriced compared to the older 10030 ISD. I remember thinking it was too expensive when it was 50% off at S@H! Even the Snowspeeder was "kewler" to less than half the price:	negative
Thanks for the review. Eh, honestly, I though this was awful ever since I first saw the pictures. To me, an incomplete grey ball doesn't really work as a special UCS kit, for the sole reason that it's BORING. Extremely so. Now, the new Death Star playset is a whole different story. They should have done that in the first place. Edited by Grevious, 24 June 2008 - 09:12 PM.	negative

Not comparative. Here are some advantages that makes ISD win for me: - A lot more fun to build with less repetitions - It is easier to build alternate models from it! (How many alternate models of the DS2 have you seen?) - The bricks are more varied. - You get magnets! - It is a larger set if you look at the size	positive

Dang! So much negativity on a such spectacular set! This baby provides an amazing backdrop to any Lego inspired Star Wars diorama. And lets face it Lego tends to be a rectangular brick and somehow we now have a sphere!!! Guys... its a UCS. It accurately depicts the on screen icon and put plain and simple is a wonderful sculptural piece of work in its own right. I agree with KimT in that the removal of the laser and Super Star Destroyer gives it more authenticity but to call it a gray golf ball or ignore its inherent accuracy is simply to miss the point. It proved to be the best build to share with someone, be it family or friend due, to its repeated sections and impressive finish. Its a clever build and to criticize it for lack of playability or (I suspect for many) its absence of minifigs is just absurd and possibly why Lego has not released a proper UCS in nearly two years. I reckon many out there would love a UCS Tyderium, Imperial Walker or Slave 1 with a spectacular piece count be it minifig scale or just darn impressive in its own right. Sadly for those who love these sculptural masterpieces we're stuck with simple toys with 'play features' and cute minifigs. Clever in their own right but lacking the clout and purity of the old UCS line. Let's hope some diversity of product is just around the corner else 10179 was the last of the truly brave financial gambles of the Star Wars line....	positive
I decided to re-read this review because I just got this set today. I dont really have a concern over the design or repeating build process because owning this set was never an option for me as I collect UCS sets... But I am surprised to see an almost total lack of positive posts. I really hope that I enjoy this build.	neutral

7656 General Greivous's Starfighter Release: 2007 Number of Pieces: 232 Minifigs: 1 Brickset Welcome! This is my first review, so contstructive critisism is very much appreciated! On to the review: First, we start out with the box: The box art is the same as always since 2006. nothing special. Then we start the build. The build is fairly easy, and will take the seasoned builder about 15-20 min to complete. Here is the finished model: and bird's eye view: As you can see, this ship is very sleek. The fins or "wings" each have an outer slope and an inner one, with the guns in between. There are also cones on the front of the fins, which give the ship an even more sleek look. In the middle of the wings there is the main body, with a big slope and stripes decorating it. This set has a very good playability factor, as I'm about to show you now. The guns on the ship are pretty cool looking to begin with; a bley slope attaching a lightsaber hilt and a trans-neon green stud to the fin on each side. But theres more than what meets the eye: Yes, the guns flip up! ...and they can flip all the way back to hide them, for whatever case they need hiding. Lets have a look at the back, there is a tail fin used as landing gear and some lightspeed boosters: But wait... The tail fin can flip up for flight thanks to a hinge attached to the back of the cockpit. Heres another playability factor: The cockpit can slide open very smoothly and easily. Heres how this is possible: A clever system under the hood allows the cockpit to open. See those two bley pieces on the black ones? Those bley ones attach to the tan plates under the hood, and the hood and windsheild attach to the black peices. The black and bley pieces work together as a sliding system, so the cockpit opens. Viola! And then the cockpit snaps in place thanks to the red hook and clip. Its a very accurate system, and works very well. You'll want to open and close it over and over again! Now, finnaly to the fig: The General himself. A very impressive fig, with a new head and torso mold. In this set, (which is one of only two with Greivous in it) he comes with 2 green and two blue lightsabers, all with bley hilts ( ). I was hoping for chrome hilts, but its a minor fault. Grievous also comes with a new mold pistol blaster (not pictured). Heres the General in the cockpit (sadly a weak cockpit, no details): He just half lays down on a small slope. In this set, he doesnt come with a cape beacuse with it on, the cockpit doesnt close. Thats about it, heres the... FINAL VERDICT: Build: 7/10 Fairly easy but fun. A little bit weak. Playability: 8/10 Many playability factors, but some are boring or pointless. Swooshability: 8/10 very fun to fly around, sometimes pieces break off. Minifigs: 10/10 one amazing fig with 4 lightsabers and a new blaster. what more could you ask for? Design: 9/10 very sleek, but hardly any real texture. i like it, but others might want greebling. Price: 10/10 Overall Score: 9/10 A very cool ship with a very cool minifig and accessories. One of the best SW sets I have ever seen for its small price I highly recommend it to any kind of SW, LEGO, or SW LEGO fan. Hope you enjoyed my review, please leave feedback!

nice review, i bought a couple of these for parts, the only thing i dont like about the ship itself (not the lego version, it does fine) is why is the Grand Droid General flying around in in a small fighter like this, i prefer the battlefront interpretation witch uses it as a bomber. anyway, great review! -York	neutral

Great set, great review! I have it too and I am very glad to own it! It will probably be the cheapest and best way to get a Grievous fig for a while (even though it doesn't come with a cape ). You guys know that you can use the new robot/skeleton arms from the Castle sets to make him hold his lightsabers horizontically, right? I always have him with two of each kind of arm.	positive
It's all good... BUT!(I know, you expected a but ) It's a rat.	positive
Thanks for the review. Bearing in mind that the whole point of this set is to get a cheap troll warrior, I actually quite like it. The cart isn't brilliant, but for 13 pieces it's not that bad. The troll fig is great as always, and I guess the rats are always nice to get (not so much in real life though). The sets that contain the trolls have a fairly solid number each (I mean, Tower Raid has three!), but nevertheless I think I may have to pick up a few of these. WhiteFang, on Jul 2 2008, 02:49 PM, said: In addition, the flick missile really works. Use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it, the missile will fly. Well, it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature. The troll's hands are going to get quite sore then aren't they?	positive
Its a good review but you forgot another thing. THE Troll needs a shiled like they used to in the 2007 castle line the sets always had shields for the minifigs and it could be better if it was 3.00 instead of 3.50 but yes it is a good impulse great army builder.	positive

Guys, thanks for your kind comments. It seemed most of us here love this impulse set, mainly to build army. Guess, I am a little bit too critic in my review. I was expecting a little bit more! Nevertheless, I intend to buy multiple sets of this and build on my orc armies and split them into different battalions. This is indeed one of the better ways to acquire orcs. Wilhelm screamer, on Jul 3 2008, 11:30 AM, said: I got two of these in the mail today and was so eager to do a review of it. Thanks for saving me the work. Opps, I was eager to do a review as well, when I bought these sets. I hope you enjoyed reading this comprehensive review. Nikola Bathory, on Jul 3 2008, 04:08 PM, said: Hey, your review is great (as usual!!) As for the set itself - well, it's an impulse set after all - small and cheap, nothing special. Well, the rat is special, hehe, for me the rat is the most interesting in the set (cause I don't have a rat). I don't have a troll warrior either, but I'm not very interested. Give the new theme a chance. I feel TLG have made an effort to revive certain elements that are present in past castle themes. Although it is not as good as the past, but it is certainly better than the recent castle themes. Shoc, on Jul 4 2008, 01:00 AM, said: Why is mouse friendlier than rat? Well, mouse sounded more friendly, because it can associate with Tom and Jerry. But, calling it a rat equal calling it a pest.. It's just a matter of putting it in different terms. That's all. Edit: Instead of posting another post to explain why I used mouse. I will write it here. Tom and Jerry is reflected as a cartoon. Children associate Jerry as a mouse, since its supposed to be heart-warming and make us laugh. In real life, there are many different pets we raised. One of the possible pets we considered is a mouse. Mouse are supposed to be shy and friendly creatures that live in harmony. While rats lived in packs, hunt food in the dark and is widely regarded as a "pest". In this review, I am trying to illustrate rat and associate it with mouse by presenting it in a much friendly approach. There is no right or wrong answer. It's just making use of different words to represent how I feel towards a particular thing. Edited by WhiteFang, 04 July 2008 - 08:08 AM.	positive

This is a nice way of building up orc armies, but I do wish it was designed like the Knight impulse set. There you have a minifig, enough weapons and armor for two figs and a weapons rack made out of basic pieces. Add a generic fig from your collection and you have two knights and the pieces from the rack can be easily used in MOCs. The pieces that make up the siege weapon in the Orc impulse are not as easy to use in other creations. I'd rather have seen a "Orcish" weapons rack (different from the Knights rack, but like it, using basic elements) with a second helmet, another weapon, the Orc armor and a shield to put on it. Still, although not as good as the Knight impulse, it's a nice little set. WhiteFang, on Jul 4 2008, 03:43 AM, said: Tom and Jerry is reflected as a cartoon.

While rats lived in packs, hunt food in the dark and is widely regarded as a "pest". Where I come from people keep both as pets. However, if either are found in the house uninvited, they are considered pests. And if you look at the Chinese zodiac, rats are very well thought of and are symbols of prosperity.

Hello all Eurobricks members, I will be doing a continuation of my Impulse set reviews. I was pretty excited when I laid my hands on these new impulse sets yesterday. Hope to give most of you a good insight for this set. Name: Street Cleaner Theme: LEGO System / Town / City Year: 2008 Pieces: 22 Minifigs: 1 An image of a 5620, Street Cleaner Let the cleaning begin The Street Cleaner has a job to do. It is to clean the rubbish on the streets, after a New Year Countdown. It seemed the cleaning agency have a new equipment to use. It's not as big as the previous street sweeper machine. The cleaner will need to operate the equipment manually, by pushing it. Look at the mess After sorting out Look at the pieces offered. It's not a very complicated set, since it's an impulse set. There are some pretty useful parts lying around such as the broom, spade. However, I was quite surprised when I could not find the lid of the rubbish bin. I can't used this rubbish bin to place it around my town, without a lid on top of it. I believed it is not a norm, by not including the lid. Look at that bin Well, that rubbish bin seem to be containing his equipment in it, instead of the rubbish. The cleaner's face looks pretty sad. I think he wants to have a change of job. Front View I love that blue brush very much. Quite fun to play with, especially pushing the rubbish aside. That's why a spade is there to help him to dig out the litter and the broom to brush it away. Ok, now I know why his face looks so sad! Where is that Street Sweeper machine? Summary review Playability: 6.5/10 (Not bad to play with) Design: 7.5/10 (The design is relatively interesting, with the use of the technic part, to be its foundation.) Price: 8/10 (An inexpensive set to get another cleaner and some neat accessories.) Overall: 7/10 (Not a bad set after all. Pretty average, but still quite good to buy if your towns required more cleaners.) Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed. Pictures can be found in My Brickshelf(When moderated) Edited by WhiteFang, 04 July 2008 - 03:44 PM.	positive
Thanks for the review . Not a bad price (of course, its impulse) for a fig, a little cleaner thing, and two accesories. The brush, fig, and spade i dont have yet, so i might just pick this up.	positive
Looking at this is making me want to build one of the favourite sets of my childhood, 6649 Street Sweeper (might do that today actually). Cheap. good pieces (despite the lack of a bin lid... that's just inviting disaster isn't it?), nice fig, and one of those blue brushes, which I've always loved but never managed to use. Thanks WhiteFang.	positive
Thank you for the nice review. This set looks good. I have too many of the blue sweepthings, but the fig is nice and I didn't have this face, so I will pick up one some day.	positive
Wow, what a great little impulse set! I relly dig the face as well as a chance to get some cool accessories like a broom, bin (no lid....sigh) and a mushroom top (Hat). A really nice review and story too Whitefang, i think this guy will be joining my set of Lego when he shows up in Australia. Cheers ISC	positive
WhiteFang, on Jul 3 2008, 03:18 AM, said: This set is simply wonderful. You know, that's exactly what I thought. I love it! It's simple, well designed, and cute. There are some nice pieces in there as well, and I really do quite like the fig- the new coastguard torso looks great. Thanks!	positive
Excellent review; I like how the new coast guard sets blare out NEW when you see them.	positive
Thank you for the nice review. The set is nice, the pieces are nice. And the grey helmet is great for an additional Star wars rebel technician.	positive
I really enjoyed your review of the kayak! So many little things in one set that aren't currently in my collection. I didn't even realise it came with a buoy! Cool helmet, lifejacket, face, and oar, I will definitely need one of these! Cheers ISC	positive
One of the better impulse sets IMO.	positive
Thanks for pics. The Hawk, it seems to me, lacks a cockpit, theres not even a seat to keep the pilot from falling off. Perhaps it they'd redesigned it to be a backpack jetpack sort of unit using similar pieces, it'd at least make some sense? Based on the other MM impluses, Can we assume this goes for 3.5$USD? at that price it seems to me, that the Astro Fighter at 5$USD was already a superior impluse set. Guess I'd buy one on clearance, for the minifig.	neutral
Thanks for another review WhiteFang! This is quite a nice set actually. It evokes some of the design elements of the MX-11, while looking different enough to justify me buying it. The head on the astronaut is one I like, so even better. I hadn't realised it was that one actually. Does 26 pieces make it one of the bigger impulses sets? I think I may have to get one, if not two... Plus it's called 'Crystal Hawk'. How can that not be considered cool?	positive
Nice Review good little set probable one of the only impusle sets i will be geting untill/if they make Agents Theme impulse sets And i like the neat double-sided face Edited by Darth_Legois_619, 03 July 2008 - 10:35 AM.	positive

IMO, Impulse set total piece count should be 30 or less. It will be ideal and more ways to construct a much better impulse sets such as past impulse sets that we came across. I may be wrong, on the 30 piece count thing. But, this is how I view Impulse sets. Brainbox, on Jul 3 2008, 06:11 PM, said: Plus it's called 'Crystal Hawk'. How can that not be considered cool? Do you know I bought this set, mainly because it have such a cool name attached with it. "Crystal Hawk", I simply fell in love with that name.	positive
Thank you for the nice review. This set has a very classic space feeling, so I don't care about the lack of cockpit. A nice little set with a nice minifig.	positive
I really like the look of this Impulse set! even though i sold off my MM sets to buy SW i kept my Astro fighter and this impulse set really appealed from the moment i laid eyes on it. I feel the swooshability and cool extras like the double sided face far outweigh the lack of cockpit. Thanks for another great review Whitefang!	positive
I like this one aswell, It has a couple of parts i need for an MOC train locomotive and I don't have any of those space guys yet. and a double faced guy is always a winner in my book	positive
Once again, another outstanding review by svelte_corps! I am not a very big fan of Agents, but this theme defintely offer plenty of useful parts. This Volcano Base is simply fanastic for parts usage, especially in doing up landscaping, with mountains, by making use of the brown BURPS. I must admit that the exterior looks real cool, but the interior looks rather empty. These orange slopes certainly make a great illustration of the larva, which gives the Agents a hard time to infiltrate within its compound to save his comrade. I am quite sure, this set will defintely attracts lots of kids to coax their parents to buy it, since the bright colors will defintely caught their attention. With all those hi-tech, sleek weaponary, I am sure this is the next big thing for kids out there. Well, I am not sure if this theme works for me as well. But this set defintely works well for landscaping project.	positive
Thanks for another great review! I definitely like this set. Sure, the interior might be a bit bare, but I think that the outside of the base with all of the great lava and rocks more than makes up for it. It is a bit weird that on the one side there is nothing on the inside. But that's easy to fix. Anyone know when this will be out in the U.S.? Thanks again for the fantastic review!	positive
droool Must buy!!!!!! To Svelte_corps: How on this wonderful planet, did you get that??? I thought it was coming in september!!!	positive
Darth_Legois_619, on Jul 7 2008, 11:33 PM, said: and thats not including 2 other sets that i dont want Yeah, Break jaw sets are generally worse than the other ones. Anyway, the review was great. Can we have a close-up of Fire-Arm's face?	neutral
Excellent review SC. Thanks for sharing. The figs are awesome. I really like the female villain - an excellent face. I also like the agent uniforms. The laser gun is perfect. It has that Peter Sellers/Pink Panther dooms day device look that I envision when I think of laser destruction. The volcano has some neat features as well, like the trans. red/orange lava. It is a bit heavy on stickers though, as are many new sets/themes. But overall, I think this set will really appeal to the kids. - A great review of a neat set.	positive
Honestly I'm too much of a Space fan to be interested in this set. I'd rather have the sub. Good review though. :D	negative
Nice Set Review I really liked the narrative for the Review. I must have missed your Custom Base back in June, also well constructed and great story too!	neutral
Thanks for the step-by-step!! Set looks great! Mmmmm, Clawdette....	positive

GREAT REVIEW!!! Realy Thank you svelte_corps! Maybey you can put al the Agents villains round Dr. Disco Like a sort of dicussionroom or something...Just an idea Undersigned MoWo	neutral
Thanks for the review svelte_corps, I have yet to purchase an Agent set but I think that will change shortly. I am not a big fan of the stickers but the huge laser gun, the unique minifig design, and beaucoup trans-orange pieces have me sold.	positive
I know the word "Secret" base but whats this! The Base is hardly secret with a massive laser gun and wide screen sticking out It looks good, Lots and lots of Orange! Woo!	positive
I'm still keeping my money payments until July 26th ...So I won't be able to buy this set unless I get some money prize or something However, I appreciate the review, and hopefully I will get this set sometime in the near future. I just love these new cybernetic arms	positive
Cool set. I got that firearm thing straight away lol. I might get a few of these sets and combine into mustafar. Great review	positive
I didn't exactly know where this belongs the best but i think it fits the best in here cause it's somewhat space related. I got this nifty little set yesterday from an auction ebay, new and sealed! I think the rock raiders theme was a great theme, and i wish they would have continues id back then. But anyway, let's see what we got here: Set Nr.: 4910 Name: Hover Scout Number of minifigs: 1 Number of pieces: 39 Release Year: 1999 First, a picture of the little box & instructions: A general overview of the set: And here we have the lovely (?) Miss Jet! (yes, the minifigures had odfficial names in this theme ) The little vehicle: And finally the Crystal Analysis Station. i like that very much, even if it's simple, but it does a good job and the amount of equipment also is cool: That's it, little set, little review, but big fun. I can recommend that to everybody, it's great for the parts, and the minifig is lovely. Gets a 10/10 from me	positive
OMG Iamded's torso! [ spoiler] OH MY GOD!![ /spoiler]	positive
When I got this set, my first Rock Raiders set, I thought it was the best set I ever had. Maybe that was a little bit of an overstatement, but I like a lot, the pieces mainly, and this is a nice little review! Are92 RoWar, on Jul 10 2008, 08:22 PM, said: OMG Iamded's torso! [ spoiler] OH MY GOD!![ /spoiler] What would be more appropriate is commenting on Iamded's torso saying "OMG Jet's torso!"	positive
Great review . Man, this brings me back! I still have like 5 of those rock monsters. In response to your statement, Rock Raiders does belong in this forum, being everything space related. 1) It's on an alien planet 2) In the computer game's start and in the story (yes, there was a computer game-my cousin has it) they are in a space ship 3) There are huge alien rock monsters trying to kill them.	positive
Great review and such a nice figure! I consider Rock Raiders space too. I also consider many of the diver themes space as well... I've yet to own a Rock Raiders set. I have tried to buy a few off eBay, but they always went too high...	neutral
Sinner, on Jul 20 2008, 04:56 PM, said: I consider Rock Raiders space too. I also consider many of the diver themes space as well... Me too. The Rock Raiders are very sci-fi, with the best Lego Space storyline. The Aquazonies would be inner space rather than outer space though, but they look very 'spacey'.

7663 Sith Infiltrator Year: 2007 Number of Pieces: 310 Number of Minifigs: 1 Price: 29.99 USD Brickset Hello everyone, and welcome to my second review on Eurobricks, the Sith Infiltrator! Lets start with a pic of the box, shall we? As you can see, its a Limited Edition set, meaning the fig and set could be worth a lot in the future. This set takes about 20 minuets for the seasoned builder. An overview of the Infiltrator (also know as the Scimitar): As seen in the picture, this ship is very sleek, with very few studs on top (SNOT= Studs Not On Top). Basically, Its the cockpit with two wings (with two "fins" on each wing), attached to the hull. Heres a side view of the Scimitar: Very cool- looking! It lands on two "feet" in the front while the cockpit rests on the ground. Rear view: The back. The outer cockpit is beautiful, a printed piece on the back (no dreaded sticker sheet! (DSS)) and a large printed disc on top: Heres a look at the middle: There is a flick-fire missile (trans-red cone attach to Technic pin) on the inner wing, a trans-red lightsaber blade in the back of the hull, and a trans-red lightsaber blade in between the fins on either side. All of those lightsaber blades may come in handy... Hey, look: the fins open from the wings!: The fins open due to double hinges on each fin. Unfortunately, you have to hold the ship up in order for the bottom fins to open. Now, lets have a look inside the cockpit: To open, you lift the back printed part, which is attached to the printed disc on top, which is attached to a hinge. It opens pretty smoothly, but is somewhat loose, so sometimes it closes on its own. Also, the disc isnt secured well enough to the door, and often breaks off, even with the smallest movement to it. Inside, there is an elevated control panel and two sliding pieces near the floor. This ship also comes with a small speeder bike: Its very cleverly built, and is a really neat addition. See that clear disc on the bottom? It fits perfectly into the sliding pieces in the cockpit: Hmm... whats this?: A hidden compartment! Now this was a very cool idea by TLG, a secret compartment found by taking off the top slope of the hull contains Darth Maul's weapons and tools which include: A (CHROME!) lightsaber hilt, a pair of electrobinouculars, and three probe droids. A closeup of a probe droid: Just a plain, black minifig head with a black lever on top. Finally, the fig: Darth Maul in the flesh plastic. A good fig altogether, with a black hood and lightsaber blades taken from the ship. He did come with a crisp, new black cape (packaged in a small, white cardboard box), but I am currently using it for another fig. Note that this is a limited edition fig, so stock up. A comparison pic of the two Mauls: The 2007 version is on the left, and the 1999 version on the right. Note a few key differences between the two: the new one has smaller red tattoos and a smoother torso. Also, the new one has bigger eyes and a more cartoony look. Maul on the speeder bike: Of course, he fits perfectly in the cockpit wile sitting on the bike, and he can reach the controls: Well, thats about it, here is the... FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, easy and fun, breaks every once in a while. Playability: 7/10, this set has many features, but is very fragile between the cockpit and hull and between the two cockpit pieces. Swooshability: 1/10, too fragile to fly around, plus the flick fire missiles fall out. Minifigs: 9/10, a great fig with a chrome hilt and a double sided blade. A little cartoony. Design: 7/10, very clever techniques, very sleek, but very fragile. Price: 8/10, fair enough, could be a few dollars cheaper. Overall Score: 6.5/10, a very sleek ship with clever building and play techniques, but very, very fragile, and shouldnt be picked up off of the shelf too often. And with that, my review is over, but all of yours are not: comments and thoughts very welcome!! Edited by JimButcher, 15 September 2008 - 02:59 AM. indexed	neutral

I'll be honest - I don't like this ship at all. It's one of my least favourite ships in the PT and I have to yet buy either one of those sets. I also found it funny that this set was meant to be a Walmart exclusive yet never appeared on the shelves at my Walmart. Anyhow, thanks for the review!	negative

I got this set last year. And I think you made a mistake when you have remove a piece to access the probe droids and equipment, you just have to slide the entire main part. And I have a question, is this equipped with the new flick-fire missiles that don't fall off?	neutral

Thank you for the nice review. I like the design, although I didn't want to buy it. The new little speeder is very nice, but maybe a little to small.. Darth Mauls eyes are looking a bit more dangerous now.	neutral
A very neatly designed Sith Infiltrator, though I think it lacks the size of the older version. A fine ship, but not what I would call a Sith Infiltrator. It should be bigger. Thanks for another fine SW review KimT	negative
Hey all! So I purchased the remaining three Agents sets I needed, and saw that there was no review up yet for this set! Heres the first batch of parts, and the first instruction bits. The mini figures. The first small vehicles. Heres a mistake that I found in the instruction booklet. There is no difference between steps 2 and 3. The team Inferno boat. This is a nice chunky boat, that looks fairly heavy duty and evily. Its nice to see the smooth disks on the bottom, that LEGO seemingly havnt done in recent boat/plane sets. And the Agents Submarine! This is a nice build aswell. Nice and long, with a few hidden compartments. One for missiles. A place to put the treasure! Some final shots of the completed set! The spare bits! Another special mention has to go out to Slime Face. I think he is my favourite ever LEGO character. The detail on his unique torso is brilliant! His head is fantastic! And his costume just looks great, with the black and green (Plus green is my favourite colour!) Check out the back of his torso, with the slime pouring down! Deep Sea Quest was £34.99 Price ; 9/10 - This is a pretty reasonable price for a fairly substantial set. Parts ; 8/10 - A lot of nice bits, few nice boats bits, and a lot of smooth disk things. Minifigures ; 10/10 As I said Slime Face is my favourite LEGO character, and the details brilliant! Vehicles ; 8/10 Both very good, with some interesting features. Build ; 8/10 A pretty fun build. Overall ; 9/10 Its gotta be, if just for Slime Face alone, but this really is a great set!	positive
He does look a bit different though...although it hasnt come out well on the photos, there is some green printed slimey bits on his head aswell. He honestly is amazing.	positive

Nice review, thanks! TLC is really going all-out with the Agents theme. I wonder if it will last longer than one year (unlike other recent one-and-done themes). My only real criticism of the theme is those freaking stickers. My god, look at the size of that DSS in this set!	positive
Great review. This set totally OWNS Alpha Team Deep Sea. The sub design actually LOOKS like a sub, the figures are way better, the acessories are better - everything is better! Agents may have my vote for the best theme of the year. Quote I wonder if it will last longer than one year (unlike other recent one-and-done themes). Oh don't worry - a second wave will be coming next year. This was confirmed by both legomilk and in an interview with an Agents designer.	positive
I forgot to comment on this review! Great job ReZourceman, like svelte-corps said your pics really show off the set and what there is to it. I just ordered this and the volcano base off S@h and I can't wait for them to come, so I'll comment on these reviews I forgot about I love the Inferno boat, as you say in your review it looks very heavy duty and ready to take on the Agents. The sub I quite like from the look of it, though there is the problem of too little space I will try and correct that. The dark blue is especially good. And I love Slime Face, his torso is very cool. svelte_corps, on Jul 11 2008, 09:14 AM, said: I can't say this is my favourite Agents set; the boat is a little oddly proportioned and the sub, although retro looking, has practically no interior and would be difficult to customise to put more in (unlike, say, the clever job Batbrick did with the Penguin sub in his review). Wow, thanks for that little mention Is it impossible or just very hard to mod? svelte_corps, on Jul 11 2008, 09:14 AM, said: I do agree with you about Slime Face - he has a fantastic torso with all the slime dripping down which is a bit obscured by the air tank. It's really encouraging that in the last 2 Missions we've had great extra villains added in. The only thing I would add about the octopus is that the glow in the dark plastic is mixed in unevenly with the aqua blue, so it doesn't glow in the dark evenly - it's kind of like the Mars Mission jellies in that respect though much cooler! The octopus sounds great, thanks for that, is he meant to be on any side? I'm guessing he's a mutant Inferno creature. About Slime Face, is his head much different to the Joker bombs? I know he has slime marks on his head, are they very apparent? Thanks again for the review! Batbrick Away!	positive
Batbrick, on Jul 19 2008, 09:53 AM, said: Is it impossible or just very hard to mod? Nothing is impossible to mod! Probably the easiest part to change would be the front where the missiles are and the treasure chest slides out - you could make a sizeable compartment there. However the middle section is so narrow and the end fins are just that - fins - that it might be harder to expand without changing the shape of the sub. You'll find out soon when yours arrives!

Great looking set. And that glowy blue octopus is really cute, I might just get it for that. Be great in a Space moc.. Wondering, from the pdf instructions I saw, it wasnt clear what the Agent in the sub is sitting on, hows his seat work? and it looks like theres a compartment below him...	positive
6927 All Terrain Vehicle Year Released: 1981 Piece Count: 167 Minifigs: 2 List Price: $14.50 A very unique vehicle in the Classic Space collection was this "All-Terrain Vehicle" which I always considered more along the line of a Mobile Lab. The set introduced/infused white and black bricks with classic blue space pieces. The result was this great classic vehicle. The set includes two figs (still red and white): Here's a view of the vehicle which is really two components, the vehicle itself and the lab section: I absolutely loved the the blue windshield slopes (2 included), and the unique upside-down large blue slope: In the back of the vehicle is the blue lab: The back section of the vehicle has hinges that allow the jets sections to open: The brick design fits perfectly into the lab, and when opened, the lab falls to the ground: NOTE: the little round trans. red 1x1s allow the lab to slide up and forward when the jet sections are closed. I tried taking off the red 1x1s and the lab does not lift as easily with them. The design is very clever, esp. for a classic set. Here's a shot of the stand-alone lab: Unlike earlier Classic Space windows, this set has train window frames with yellow windows. The top of the lab lifts up for playability: Inside the lab are several computers and a swivel chair: Back to the vehicle, here's a shot of the cockpit with white steering wheel: The left side has an upside-down wrench and black antenna: The right side, a walkie-talkie and another antenna. The antennas can be used as breaks to keep the middle wheels from moving: Here's ashot of the under carriage: And a final shot of the complete set: For those of you following my Classic Space reviews, this is review number 9 of 10. My final review of an-all time favorite will be coming soon. Hope you enjoyed this review. Comments are always welcome.	positive

This looks like a good set and I'd better catch up with the rest of your reviews, ASAP!	neutral
Thanks for the review. This is one of my favorite space sets of all time. I even had 2 of them back in the days. My only complain about this set was that I found that the wheels where too small , I had some trouble passing the rover over the little "craters-mountains" of the space plates	positive
This is a great little set. I like how it combines two very different color schemes for different parts of the model. I have made some slight modifications to mine, adding a roof on the vehicle and a back wall on the outpost. Also, those white 1x1 headlight plates at the front are thinner than the modern kind and seem to be quite weak. I got this set off ebay a while ago and one of them was broken in shipping, even though the set was otherwise in display model condition, and the other one broke off while I was building the set. I replaced them with the newer variety. mutex, on Jul 10 2008, 11:37 PM, said: My only complain about this set was that I found that the wheels where too small , I had some trouble passing the rover over the little "craters-mountains" of the space plates The only bad thing about this set is the name.

Thanks for another informative review of the best Lego theme ever, and not in attempt to hijack your thread but to add to it, here's a pic of my blacktron 1 version of this beautiful set. the 6927 has to rate as one of the best 5 classic space sets ever along with 918, 6970 and 928.	positive
Quote Great buy on this one. What did it cost you? It was $30, which was a pretty good price given the condition. It had no box or instructions though. This set is actually fairly common on ebay though, considering how old it is. I see them pretty frequently on there. Quote It's a real nice set. However, there is one thing I don't understand about this design. Why is the driver seat has a wide back with no cover behind? And, the command center has no door at the back? I understand that these Space guys are always carrying their helmet around, for oxygen supply. I wonder if there is a better answer to it. I just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed: Edited by CP5670, 11 July 2008 - 06:39 PM.	neutral
This set never got me as a kid. I suspect it was because of the wheels; I had mostly Basic sets so it would have been more of the same. Looking at it now I can see I have misjudged it, and I love the lab-lift method. I'm going to have to build this to see it in action! Thanks for another great review.	positive
Awesome review Brickster! I didn't you are also a Space fan Oh how I love Classic Space The all time perfect LEGO space related theme Everytime I see one I want to buy them more and more, when compared to modern fang dangled sets with detailed figs and cool new accessories, they have nothing on Classic Space, simple beauty Maybe its the blue/grey/trans yellow color scheme Classic Space Forever Edited by Piranha, 30 August 2009 - 07:51 AM.	positive
Wow! That brings back memories. I have that model too (in storage somewhere). The pictures are great. I will definitely be checking out more of your reviews.	neutral
Yeah, first time that I am getting a set before everyone.^^ First of all: The package The european version has no "Limited Edition" button. Hooray!!! Sorry for the blurry back-shot. We see the hospital back, a few bubbles with set functions and a little comic. Comic: Bubbles: The figures are injured Spongebob, Patrick and the new Fish Doctor. Spongebob has a headprint... ...and a backprint (other than the normal Spongebob). Spongebob and injured Bob: The set comes with two litters. The ambulance car is a bit extraordinary. I don´t know how the car is like in the show (and I saw a lot of episodes) but it looks a bit strange, mostly because the weehls are too small. Of course we get another SS (not so D this time). The litter fits in the back, with help of this lid. I wish it would be the hinge-lid from before 2004... Now we come to the meanpart of the set: The hospital! The entrance has got babyblue traindoors and a hudge sign that shows "Emergency". The tubes are nearly everywhere in this set. I was getting insane when I came to the part, where I must put the stickers on the tubes. This parts are very usefull, but I wanted that the set looks good, because I will display it. So I stickered just two of the parts and not all four. Now we come to the interroir: The doctor has a desk with computer. Sadly it´s not very well placed and he must duck because of his fin. Next to the door, we get this little case, wash basin and two drawers. Again we get stickers... Not that I don´t like stickers. It´s just: Everytime I get to the part where I must put the stickers on, I think how I can re-use the model and if I rebuild the model, later and and and... I hate it to deside! A few posters are in it, too. The set is a great addittion to your own Bikino Bottom, but the playability is not very big for the kids. They can just play that Patrick steals the ambulance car, like shown on the package, and is hitting Spongebob. Than the drive back, the doctor gives Spongebob two medicines and let him go. I bought the set mostly because of the parts (tubes in lightbley and a few woodpieces). But I am thinking about let it stand in my little Bikini Bottom (just consist of Crusty Crab and Chum Bucket). Playability: 3/10 Figures: 10/10 Price: 8/10 Design: 9/10 TOTAL: 30/40	positive
Thanks for the review, looks like a great set. I'm surprised that spongebob's bandage has a full body headprint so kudos to lego for that	positive
oh so spongebob was the injured one. I thought this set depicted the episode wherein Mr. Krabs was the one rushed to the hospital.	neutral
I love the Sponge Bob sets, I have all of them! Nice review.	positive
Great review. As much as I hate spongebob LEGO, I just might get this set. It has a good number of useful parts, like the computer and keyboard, and all of the brown pieces. How much does this set cost in USD?	neutral
How much euro did you pay for it? It looks a great set, great interior, nice figures and funny posters. :) It's also nice: the newest Spongebob sets are now also available in our stores and they are the coolest (Belgium)!	positive

I ordered the set via S@H and it cost 34.99€ in Germany, 37.99€ in Belgium and 50$ in Australia. It looks like it´s a exclusive set, but without the 2limited edition" sticker on the package. In the USA it´s not aviable, now. I think it costs as much as the rocket ride (30$). @ Mrs Pegleg: He has the same, short pants, like in the other sets.	neutral

I never have buy a Sponge Bob set but this looks so cool so maybe... (Just maybe) I will buy it . I am curious of why TLC haven´t done the Flying Dutchman ship, it was in the first rumor list of Sponge Bob sets, that surely will be a must .	neutral
The official name for this Lego set is "The Emergency Room". I have all the other SpongeBob sets, including three Krusty Krabs, two Bikini Bottoms, as well as one of everything else , now all I need to do is wait until next month to buy this set if I find it at my local Toys "R" Us. That SpongeBob minifig looks cute.	positive
I'm not a huge fan of spongebob, but this set I might want also have. Maybe I can combine it with the city hospital.	positive
This set doesn't have much playability, but the hospital is better than the one released by lego recently. it has more detail. i like it.	neutral
Thanks Navy Trooper Fenson for the review - good one ! I really like that SB is printed! I will need to get this one when I go to the US in two weeks. CopMike	positive
Nice review, NFT! I´m not that much into SpongeBob, but these two pieces just for themselves are interesting to get: container cupboard 4532 and cupboard drawer 4536 the latter not being sold for the last 6 years! Both together are an excellent way to create detailed interiors. 6 of those for me, please!	positive
My fish doctor has the torso from 7902 Doctor's Car, which is unfortunate, because the other torso is more stylized and cartoonish, I think. However, I did have that mad scientist lab set, so a bit of digging through my old collection will hopefully yield the better torso.	neutral
mommy and daddy are naughty!	neutral
Yay! It's good to see your kids get to build some stuff too, Sinner . All through the review I was thinking 'This was a present - but who actually put it together?' so I'm glad the last pic cleared things up As for the set - it looks much bigger than I expected - I think it does make a good sized dollhouse. There are a stack of nice pieces in there - cupboards, oven, trans-blue 2x5 bricks, all the accessories, plants, flowers, food, the light-up brick, the pink roof slopes - but not enough to justify the $AUD129 retail price. Maybe on sale I'd pick it up and resell the Belville figs but David Jones hasn't even had a regular 20% off Lego sale for the whole of this year that I've seen. I think the Playful Puppy set is a horrendous ripoff for $AUD20 though. I agree with the baby catapult - the range is terrible. Lego just isn't trying any more, is it? At least they've moved on from throwing cats off three storey buildings. 2 questions though. 1) Was it a fun build? 2) Are those large figs anatomically correct under their frou-frou finery? If not, what the hell are they doing in the second pic whilst baby Sylvia explores the oven?	neutral
Excellent review! It's nice to see how... it's nice to see how ... ... it's nice ... Okay, I can't get over the sex in the bedroom and the unattended baby crawling into the oven. I didn't read anything else except, where does the puppy sleep and my daughter made me build this. You are sick and twisted and that's why I love you! It seems you are coining the Belville edge. Now will you please stop sitting around eating clams and get that baby out of the oven or make the fun in the bedroom a three-way? Please! Thank you PS. OK, I read it. I want the baby toilet and I think the jellyfish is supposed to be a jello-mold. I bet you knew that. The fireplace lattice look like the Harry Potter one and not the Fabuland one. Boo!! Wienies. When your daughter outgrows it, will you turn it into a Belleville Star Wars MOC please? Thank you in advance	positive
Baby catapult you say? Puts a basenet to shame! Top review by the way, lego drink bottles for the win! Edited by Mrs Pegleg Blockbeard, 12 July 2008 - 06:37 AM.	positive
Great review, and i note something like a bucket in the dog set... shame its not blue... As for the fire place piece i love it and i want one, ever since finding it on MLcad!!! I love the BBQ, it looks so good!, you know i might even buy this, it it was not so pink! Now as for the kiddies, in ovens, make sure they are not over cooked they can be stringy , and as for the couple up stairs, now we at least know what you do with your mini figs when no one is looking/ lego sets in public places , just following your name sake i guess And i must say Lego, shame, shame, that catapult needs reviwing, hardly even make a dent in a castle wall! Regards Cpt. PB	positive
I was sort of hoping for a flick-fire baby. Still, this looks decent, for what it is, I guess. Obviously, it really is all about the accessories, and it's got 'em, but not enough to make me spend that kind of cash, and I don't even mind having a pile of pink parts around. If you throw in a complete turkey or some birthday cakes, it's a slam dunk, but as it is... eh. Thanks for the review, though, it's very nicely presented and leaves no doubt in my mind as to just how easy this set would be to misuse for other purposes.	neutral

Sinner!!! You know, I had never seen a BELVILLE set in any review with such great pictures before! I just can't take my eyes off, in the Master Bedroom. The scene is quite, a little hot. Enough of me, peeping up there. Let's take a look at the interior. I am very surprised by its construction of the house. It's quite big and is nice of you to buy a great sweet gift for your daughter. I am very sure, she will enjoyed playing with it. Somehow, it reminded me of Barbie Doll products. Maybe, its too pinkish for me. The accessories is the "plus factor" in any BELVILLE sets. It offered quite a handful of great accessories to add into any types of MOCs construction to add in the plus factor in it. Sinner, you are a very nice Dad! I like how parents, buy educational toys for their children to expand their imaginations instead of sitting in a couch playing video games and etc.	positive

If your daughter is anything like mine, you will definitely get your money's worth out of it. However ... as soon as my daughter says she's done with it, I plan on raiding the sets for all those great food and accessory bits. Patience .... Great review, by the way. The Belville sets are indeed overpriced, but they're probably Lego's best attempt at wooing the girl audience (I still hate the fact that TLC thinks they need separate "boy" themes and "girl" themes, but whatever). They're a very nice alternative to Barbie -- you get posable figures with realistic body proportions, plus some creativity and building aspects thrown in.	positive

Love this set! Nice review also.. I had the set in my hands a few times but never bought it, though I drooled at it, I remember. I guess I didn't get pocket money at that time, it was not that common around europe in the 80s I guess. So better to say that no one bought it for me.. A few years later I got the safari truck, which is also really sweet. I like the colors of this model and the detail of it. The minifig is really classic, made only for this set (appears in some later train sets as well) and shows the exact image of the truck on the shirt, including the motor piece. One of the most detailed and loveliest little sets from a sweet era of Legoland city! PS Voted "O" for Outstanding. Edited by Zzz, 14 July 2008 - 09:50 AM.	positive
hmmm.... i probably would not have bought this as a kid in 1987, unless i had money to spare or the shop had no other set from space or castle, the two other big lines in 1987, and no better set in the town section. i think it's a great parts pack, but the model itself does not look very attractive. I never really liked those wheels, honestly. They're from the basic sets, mostly, and they work pretty well in those, but i'm just not a fan... the roof, on the other hand, was very popular and the blue modified bricks at the front were quite rare in those days, but generally speaking, this was not the star of 1987. gave it a "3"	negative

I had saw the earlier image just now. It looks very nice. Just to share some information with you guys. Vestas, an global company which is an expert in "Wind Energy" This is a tie-up with LEGO. I feel its an illustration on how our world will benefit by applying and believing its technology to make use of re-useable natural resources.

I recently got a few still sealed and new sets from the 90' on ebay, and after the Rock Raider's Hover Scout this isthe second one i'll review. I really like the space port theme, even if the sets may be more simple than earlier space city sets, i like the overall look and the color scheme. But enough of that, let's go on with the pictures! Set Nr.: 6455 Name: Space Simulation Station Number of minifigs: 3 Number of pieces: 240 Release Year: 1999 First again a few pics of the boxes and the instructions: The main box: This theme had a kinda strange seperation of the pieces, the parts for the control center and the shuttle are in seperate little boxes, and the others are in polybags with the models printed on them. Also seperate instructions for each step: A general overview: We got 3 lovely minifigs here, from left to right the control engineer, the mechanic and the astronaut: The -i dont know the english word for it- testing-thing, the astronaut is being tested to hard nerves there The mechanics little car, on the back an extinguisher and a radio device is attached: the take-off station for the little shuttle with the shuttle itself on it: And without it: Tools, tools, tools! The shuttle as stand-alone: i think that would be fuel tanks, i like this little detail: And finally we have the controll room, would have been better with seats, but it's alright: A really sweet mid-sized set if you ask me, a few juniorized parts, but it fits perfectly with the set. The theme itself is also great, and i wish that TLG brings it back, i could see stunning sets with the quality city sets have right now!	positive
you just bring memory's back i never had one of the space port sets, but i know that as a little boy i visited my toy store and kept on looking to the boxes. on BL those sets cost too much for what ist worth today. really, TLC should bring this theme back! Space port ON!	positive
My sister got this from our grandparents once when she was interested with space but it fell into my hands later. I had a lot of fun with that. By the way, the name for the test thing is called a centrifuge. It tests a person's ability to withstand high g-forces. Edited by filefolders, 15 July 2008 - 03:55 PM.	positive
*mini-bump* Wow, I'd completely forgotten about this theme, which is suprising since I absolutely loved this theme as a kid (minus the sound n' light brick, which I thought was pretty big and ugly). Sure brings back memories of looking at those little catalogue booklets that came with the sets.	positive
I had never seen this set or this theme before. It was released during my dark age, and I had missed it. It's nice to see such sets, surface once again, to educate members like me that there are some good sets we had missed during the dark age. And, I must admit that this is a very good set. It's comes with 3 mini-figs and Staudie with it. Geez, I never thought he was an astronaunt back then. The testing facility is great, and I love to see it spin, by putting Staudie in it for a "test-run". The buggy is cute as well, but somehow, I don't really like the white frame at the back. It looked a little odd to me. The tools, are simply wonderful to have. Furthermore, these are grey tools. The last time, we had so many tools are the aeroplane mechanic. The shuttle is nice, but does the shuttle supposed to come with a cover as well? I guess, since this is a simulator, they must have cut down the budget for it. The control room is good, and it will be even better with chairs included. metalandi, thanks for the wonderful review!	neutral
Thank you very much for the review. NOW I remember! I got Mission Control when I was only 5 and built it with the help of my older sister. I loved it so much, I never rebuilt it but now... I just have to! Space Simulation was one I never got but looks to be a great set.	neutral

UPDATE: I WILL BE MERGING REVIEWS AS THEY GO IDLE, THIS IS NOW THE DINO ATTACK REVIEW THREAD "What, Jay's not doing Viking reviews!?" Nope, I think Christopher110 took care of those just fine. Instead, I have brought you what is most possibly the HIGHEST-ANTICIPATED set of the year (;) :D) - the T1 Typhoon. And I gotta say - Dinos apart, it's actually really cool. The Dinos Let's get the worst over with. Yes. Those are ALL the parts in that 'dino'.	negative
The Figs They're possibly the best part of the entire set, all in all. Nice new head, although the glasses limit its usability. I am in LOVE with the head on that fig. It's perfect for any number of figures - a good 'scarred hero' face has always been on my want list. I'm turning him into my Viking warlord after I post this review. Again, a new head. Great stubbly beard thing going on. My second-favorite head of the lot. Great for warriors, especially with helms. The torsos are fantastic for special forces figures, if anyone's planning to do something like that. Not TOO fond of the lime green on there, but it's still extremely usable. This is actually a really cool machine gun. I like it. I think this would be a good point to note that ALL designs you see - outside the figures and dinos - are stickers. That means a crapload of stickers. If you can't stand stickers at all in a set, don't buy this.	positive
The Copter This is one BIGASS copter. The photos really don't do the size justice. Lower cockpit with cool computer. Too bad it's a sticker, although I'll definitely leave this one on. Upper cockpit with cool computer. See above. Awesome gatling gun. Yes, even the TECHNIC BEAMS have stickers. I'm actually really fond of that little canister thing. I can see using it elsewhere. Yes - that's a sticker. The rope and hook. I forgot to mention it before, this set comes with two accessories besides the machine gun - binocs and one of those little things to slide down the rope. Also, the thing that 'extends' the rope turns. The other side, because they're slightly asymmetrical. One of my favorite stickers. The door says 'SURVIVAL EQUIPMENT'. It's on both sides. Definitely a keeper.	positive
As unexpected as it was, this was very helpful! ;) Three questions, though: 1. Is the front green rubber missle a traditional launchable missle, or does it have another firing mechanism? 2. Concerning the guns on the side, are they fixed in one postition, or does it have any functions? 3. Why did you decide to buy this set? (Just curious!)	neutral

In response, it's an upside-down launcher, so the switch is on the underside. So no, no special mechanism. 2. The gatling guns can be raised, but not turned. 3. I found it in Toys R Us, and was after a few of the figs, but after seeing the box up close and personal, decided 'what the heck! It's a good break from Vikings!' :-D	neutral

Hmmmm . . . . interesting. It's a shame though, because I really like the guns. Any idea when it should come to Europe? EDIT: I've just scene the Official DINO Attack site, which says they're coming to Europe in October.	neutral

I guess we'll have to wait for the photos! Officially announced by LEGO, the Dino Attack line is going to be made available in Europe in October 2005... EDIT: Check out the official Dino Attack site here!	neutral
Yeah, I picked up another one. I really liked the chopper! Let's cut straight to the chase. Dinos: First the worst, of course. These things are so horrible, they don't deserve more than one photo. They're rubbery, one piece, and the only things that remotely indicate that they're made by LEGO are the holes on the bottom of their feet. They're unrealistic to an extreme unmatched by even the previously reviewed Dinos, in that they are waaaaaaaay too thin, one is pink, and they're all grinning. Fig: One interesting thing to note is that this one has the same torso as the iron-masked dude in the chopper, not his own bare-arms torso. Pic for the sake of comparison. Now, I don't consider this fig as good as the others because the other heads are useful for Vikings and assorted castle-type people, but this has sunglasses. All in all, you'll probably find it useful, but I don't. Still, great torso for special ops stuff. Hummer: Those headlights - while stickers (yes, all prints are again stickers, although there are much less than the chopper) - are great pieces. I can see using them as furnace covers or stove burners. The windshield/hood area. Not much to say about this one. Driver's side. My question? When this is brought to Europe, will the steering wheel switch sides? ;) Seriously though, I love that little steering wheel piece more than I love taffy. And I'm a man who enjoys his taffy. Left side in its entirety. ... and the right side. View through the right side - no seat here. Could've done with another fig to fill the nonexistant seat, as well.	positive
The... weapon. Whatever it's called. This uses the same mechanism as the longboat (for those that don't have either, you snap the little sports stand thing, which hits the 'missile', which fires, and since there's nothing holding the technic beam up to that height any more, it drops down so that the next missile drops into place. Pretty cool, if unrealistic.). The two on the side do NOT fire, I think they're mainly there for 'extra ammo'. My biggest problem with this set. Open bed. This could have easily been remedied with a few plates. Interior opened. The Fire Hammer next to the T1. They look very cool together, don't they? You can also see my curio shelf. FINAL SCORE: 7.4/10 Dinos: 1/10 Fig: 8/10 (but that's just me) Hummer: 8.5/10 Parts: 9/10 I'm a harsh reviewer. I still think that if space/vehicles are your thing, you should buy this. However, if you're a bigger castle fan, or just like to get all sorts of LEGO, I would still suggest buying the Viking Catapult before this. However, I do think that these are some of the coolest sets of 2005. This is something you will eventually want to get. Until next time, Bloody Jay	positive

Wow, i think this is the first time i'm the first to have a new set (at least here) and review it. Got it 2 days ago, thanks to a fast shipping from S@H this time, and i found time now to review it now. Enough of the babbling, let's let the facts and pictures speak, which actually turned out pretty well this time. Set Nr.: 4210 Name: Coast Guard Platform Number of minifigs: 4 Number of pieces: 469 Release Year: 2008 A few shots of the box first: 2 Books of Instructions we got here, first one for the helicopter second one for the rest and the platform itself: A general overview of the platform from above: The 4 minifigs, 3 rescue guys and one oil rig worker (?). The pilot seems not very happy that he has to work in the middle of nowhere at sea Right beside the entry of the tower we have the diving equipment holder: Next, the guy can jump in this little speedboat... ...and another guy brings it down to water with the crane: If somebody is rescued from the air, he arrives here and is brought to the tower with the little moving platform than runs on "rails": Down under we got a buoy and several life belts and extinguishers: With the lift somebody who is rescued by the boat can be brought up. I think it would been better if they would have made a mechanism there to bring it up, but it's okay: A few floors higher the sea is being observated and watched: On the ground level we have the medical station/warm-up room: The helicopter as stand-alone: All in all for me this is besides the police station THE city set of this year. It's got great features, and looks fantastic and also has many useful pieces. You can't do anything wrong with buying it, 10/10 for me! That's all for now, hope you liked my review. Edit: Oh damn, i forgot to write "review" in the topic title, can a mod please add this? Thanks!	positive
Thanks for the awesome review, metalandi! Your pics are very clear and you go into detail about all the functions of the set. I agree, this is a great set - one of the best of the CG line for sure, way better than the boat set with the tower on the Bionicle baseplate, and cheaper too. I even like the helicopter better than the oversized version. Lots of great parts and a really nice build by the looks of it too. I can't wait for this to be released in Oz!	positive
Seeing the pictures in this review certainly reinforce my original thoughts on this set: Here's an oil-rig mod waiting to happen...	neutral
Very nice review and nice set to boot. Lots of little features that increase the playability. Great pics too (i remember you had trouble before with the Tower Raid castle set, as i just got mine and was looking to review it, but saw your review in archives.....shakes fist at how slow aussies get sets ) Great Reviews On!	positive
Good review ;) I will buy it this year :)	positive
TheBrickster, on Jul 18 2008, 02:35 PM, said: Excellent review Metalandi. It's always great to see early pictures of new sets. This set really reminds me of an oil rig, and could probably be easily modified as one (if one wanted an alternate model). The two components that I like most are the boat crane and the control room, but other sections are pretty slick as well. Are those printed pieces in the control room, or stickers? I'm really starting to gain an appreciation for these new coast guard sets. They've come a long way over the years: http://www.majhost.c...Guard/09set.jpg 575 Coast Guard Station -Released 1978. I picked up the Control Boat & Tower (7739) a few weeks ago but haven't opened it yet). In any case, thanks for taking the time to review this set and share it over EB. First, thanks to all your great response for my review, i'm glad you like this set aswell. As it comes to stickers, the tiles ant slopes in the control room are printed pieces! The rest as coast guard logo patterns and so on are stickers. I forgot to make a photo of the sticker sheet unfortunately	neutral
I It!! I dont think i'm gonna buy it but i LOVED the review Nice Oil Rig worker; he looks so ROUGH Undersigned MoWo	positive
Thanks for the great review. I'm loving this set a lot - it looks well designed, and the helicopter is awesome! Plus, I love the new worker figure with the beard. Quote I agree, this is a great set - one of the best of the CG line for sure, way better than the boat set with the tower on the Bionicle baseplate I wouldn't say that at all - true, this base is bigger, but the other set was well designed as well - plus the included boat is wonderful.	positive

I think it looks good on the real set. I thought, the darker glass might be good on the ground level so the rescued guy has it nice and dark in there	positive
Nice review! This is just the "Crown Jewel" for the Coast Guard theme. I love the layout of its platform. It looks real neat to have it placed it in the midst of the deep blue sea, awaiting of any emergency rescue. Sometimes, I feel that this set can used it to merge with my Aqua Raiders sets. I thought of using it as a land base, for the raiders to dock in their stuff before submerge into the ocean. Ok, it's just a wierd idea of mine. Just feel that Aqua Raiders and Coast Guard can work hand in hand, since they are naval expertise! It seemed, I can't view all the pictures somehow. Nevertheless, I can still view some of it quite well. I love the command center. The amount of computer printed pieces simply make me smile, with the monitor, keyboard, radar screen and etc. The helicopter is cute too. However, I pity the victim that is loaded at the back. It seemed a little bit too dangerous. In addition, this set seemed to have quite alot of stickers, which can be quite discouraging. I do hope to see this set soon. So far, I quite like the Current Coast Guard sets.	positive
I agree with both of you. First, i have to add, that a few of the stickers were a bit annoying as it comes to put them on espacially the ones on the helicopter, where you have to put them on round parts. But i didn't really see this at a bad point, i really can live with it. Second, it was a very hard decision, believe it or not, on which new set to buy, cause i got a huge 2008 set-wantlist. I guess it'll take some time before i can get most of the other sets i want	neutral

Paramedic Unit Set #: 6364 Year Released: 1980 Piece Count: 140 Minifigs: 2 List Price: unknown Well, let me first say that the English name, "Paramedic Unit" is not really a good name for this set. The function of a paramedic is to take a patient from an emergent situation, and deliver them to a hospital for treatment, generally an Emergency Room. This is a rather small "clinic" that I would imagine is more for family care than an Emergency Room. In addition, the car looks more like a doctor/nurse's car rather than an Ambulance or Emergency Response Vehicle. I would call this a "Clinic" rather than a Paramedic Unit. In any case, it's a great set, esp. for Table Towns that need medical services. What I like is that this set is small enough to place anywhere in your Lego City or Town. Starting with the instructions: Like all the classic town sets, alternate models are pictured, although i never tried building one: I like the little medical bus/van. The set includes two minifigs, that include a female Doctore or Nurse, and what I presume is a patient, based on the torsos: I really like the vehicle. It's a 4-stud wide two seater: The colors work well and I like the use of the white bar between the seats (and the 1x1 blue plates for lights). Unfortunately, the emblems are stickers. Here's a shot of the neat little "Clinic": I like the use of the blinds for the exam room. It shows that Lego considered patient privacy when making this set. The interior includes an exam room, desk, and two blue swivel chairs: And a neat little eye chart: Although the letters L E G O would have made a nice touch. Lastly, a picture of the complete set: I must admit that I remember buying this set back in the 80s and I regreted it after taking it home. I'm not sure what I didn't like about it (perhaps the "girl" back then), but now I really think it's a neat set. Well, there's a line of patients waiting to have their eyes checked... Comments welcome.	neutral
Thanks a lot for the review, Brickster! I never had the chance to get some classic town sets, but I wish I couldve! I just wonder why Lego cant release sets like this anymore....	neutral

Thank you for all these reviews, TheBrickster! And: The idea with the polls is a very nice and interesting idea. (It will only take a while until I will have commented on all - so please give me some time. ) I gave this set a four: The vehicle, the minfigs and the design of the house are excellent - only the interior could be a bit spiced up (telephone, some other equipment).

WhiteFang, on Jul 18 2008, 09:11 PM, said: Paramedic Unit, does not seem to suit well for this set's name. It should be named as Clinic, Outpatient Treatment, Family Doctor and etc. The definition of a paramedic is "...someone who assists physicians in providing medical care..." I think in more modern times a paramedic is generally thought of as a more qualified and experienced ambulance technician but the dictionary definition would seem to fit with the Lego model quite well. Cheers Rog	neutral
Wow! Old thread. Just for the record, so long as it is here. Paramedic's are advanced Ambulance technicians. Unlike standard EMT's they are trained for Advanced Cardiac Life Support. They can push drugs, defibrillate, place a breathing tube etc. in the 1980's when the set was made, it was quite common for Paramedics to respond to calls in "fly cars" or special response units. They would join up with Ambulances at the scenes that required their skills. If you ever watched the old American TV show "Emergency", Johnny Gage And Squad 51 were one of these response units. They were mostly phased out in the 90's in favor of simply putting the Paramedics and ALS gear in the ambulances.	neutral
Cool review! I've always loved these "hard" looking tyres, i never understood why they don't make them anymore. They looked way more off-roadish.	neutral

Another great review, Whitefang. This is a wonderful 80's vehicle - and I think it might be one of the first - if not THE first - that had the spring suspension system. I know of at least one other set that had that: the biggest Extreme Team set from 1998 had a vehicle with those pieces. Quote This tow truck is pretty useful. As you can see, current City sets hardly have any tow trucks available to tow new cars design. This tow truck is catered for 4-studs vehicles for Classic Town. Can you imagine yourself this truck towing a Speed Racer car? I think it looks really out of proportion. Firstly, Speed Racer cars are out of scale even with City vehicles. Also, I have hope that in the next few years we will get more Octan sets to go with the wonderful gas station - and I suspect that a 6-wide tow truck will be at the top of the list. It wouldn't be a hard set to make, and I bet it would sell well. Edited by Grevious, 19 July 2008 - 05:31 PM.	positive
Oh! Never seen that set before! Fun and strange that wheel supension system. Has it ever been used in any other sets?	neutral
Indeed they have; they've appeared in 15 different sets, in total. They also have an identical width with the wide 2x2 wheels holder which is used on cars today. They are still excellent today, since retrofitting these suspension parts onto today's off-roader trucks won't give them weird proportions or any problems, and it looks perfect. Plus they are useful if you're lazy and don't feel like constructing the pin-suspension used in the early 90's for truck-trailers, altough stability probably will suffer.	neutral
4/5. I've had this set since I was young. Never understood why a tow truck needed to be an off-roader; maybe it was used to tow the other off-road vehicles. The suspension made the truck too tall to tow some cars, so I often took the hook out and use the truck as just an great off-road truck like 6672 (which also had the suspension wheels). Other tow truck sets better filled their roles better, but that doesn't diminish this set at all. WhiteFang, on Jul 18 2008, 09:19 AM, said: I think it looks really out of proportion. No, for 25-odd years this vehicle was perfectly proportioned with all others in the town/city line. It's all these new 6 and 8 and 20 wide vehicles that are ignoring convention and making it look out of proportion. Granted speed racer sets are more of their own line, but 6660 is smaller than most of the cars produced in the last few years.	positive
How would this one look compared to the new GV Pickup Tow Truck? I would like to see that one tow this one.	neutral
Exxon Gas Station Set #: 6375 Year Released: 1980 Piece Count: 254 Minifigs: 3 List Price: approx. $20 One of the gems of my sets from 1980 has to be the Exxon Gas Station. It has very nice colors, lots of great details, and a high level of playability. Starting with the instructions: The backside with a great picture of the complete set: The set includes three minifigs including two gas station attendants and my favorite, the Urban Cowboy: One of the best things about this set is that it includes not one, but two very detailed 4-stud wide vehicles. Here's a picture of the red one which is a two-seater: The car has two working doors, a hood that opens, and a little holed brick on the other side for pretending to "fill 'er up". Here's another image at an angle: Isn't she a nice set of wheels! Here's the yellow car. I always liked this one better, perhaps it was the color with the black pieces in the back, although it is a one-seater: The set includes four fuel pumps that are numbered (with decals) and included a string as the hose: Here's a little accessory rack for oil and tools: And another rack for tires: The set had a nice Exxon logo on three 1x6 bricks: A large jack allows the cars to be lifted high into the air for tire and under engine repairs: I love the office with its large 5x6 window. Inside is a chair and desk. And the entire set: Happy Motoring in Legoland!	positive
Cool set I really loved the classic town sets. This set has lots of detail, great reveiw. Do you know what is Exxon?	positive

Nice it's like an alternative to the Shell petrol company sets we had over here in the UK. (or did you have them to?) Edited by Skipper 24, 19 July 2008 - 04:21 PM.	neutral
i think we only got Shell stations in europe in the 80s... Never got this one, but it looks like a typical Lego gas station ... once again, i just don't know how you were able to keep stickers and prints in such a great condition! i am sooooo jealous! the tires of the cars are a problem though... it was difficult and painful to put them off the wheel and back on later... the black hat... g... i would have looooooved to have that when i was a boy...	negative
I much prefer the Shell version of that station which had the full awning over the roadway, and the special road plate with the extra lane to pull into to fill 'er up...	neutral

Great review of a classic set. Man, this is sure a wondeful kit, even today. The level of detail is astounding for the time, and the whole kit is really cute. You know, I honestly don't get why some people have complained about the CITY gas station's figure count - the majority of lego gas stations had no more than three figures - including this one and the wonderful Gas and Wash Express (which I actually own!). I also don't get why people complain about the stickers so much - because even older kits often had a lot. Personally, I think stickers are okay, because printed pieces can't be used in as many places if the stickers are really specialized.	positive
I love this set, it's nice and simple. Maybe it's because I build this set by myself by ordering all parts and buildinginstruction. And I made one extra tanktransporter :	positive
Thanks for the fantastic review of the Esso Petrol( ) station! I like this set, a nice contrast to the shell ones, it adds a bit of variety to a Lego town. The cowboy hat is a nice addition too.	positive
Brickster You need your own sticky review section, I love looking at all of these old sets, As I have said before you take me back to a much simpler time. Thank You And on to the set. I love this gas station Lego really needs to look to it's past on some of these sets for the time the level of detail is great. I wish I still had this one in one piece as well.	positive
Brickster, once again, this is another excellent Gas Station, awaiting to be in the limelight! I don't understand why I always loved these Classic Gas station such as Shell, Exxon and Octan. They just look so lovely. No City or Town could ever survive without these important key installations around, to pump gas/petroleum for all vehicles, that depend it for fuel consumption. As always, all Gas Station will always inculde a road plate, and I am glad I am still seeing roads included in such sets, such as the recent 7993, Service Station. However, Town Plan's Gas Station, did not include a baseplate though. Nevertheless, let me continue with this review. 3 Lovely mini-figs, included in this set. It's not common to see Exxon torsos these days. I just love that lady staff very much, especially with its classic hairdo. 4-studs car just simply rocks, with such fabulous simple design. Furthermore, it gave you 2 cars instead of one. What more can you ask? You don't see TLG giving more cars in recent sets these days. What surprise me about this cars, is the ability of opening the front engine column. I remembered vividly that only trucks or massive vehicles, does have this playing feature. Nevertheless, it's an excellent addition. For a 1980 Gas Station set, this is a perfect set, even when it's going to fit into my current Town buildings. I am sure, it won't have a hard time to match with the rest of the facade. I can use this gas station and stationed it near the country side. This set is so hard to resist, with such elegant design of its fuel pump. There are a total of 4 pumping stations. The vehicles won't be fighting against each other, for slots then. The reparing area is very nice, it will be even better if it include a shelter on top of it. The office is simple and nice. I had never expect an office to exist in Gas Station. Most of the time, there are groceries stores, for the consumers to get off, buy off some stores and load it in the car. No major complains from me. I am not trying to be selection bias. I had demostrated key points which is good enough to justify my score. And, I gave it a "5". Outstanding Classic Gas Station set.	positive
Okay guys, I have built the set! So let's review! Set Name: 7649 MT-201 Ultra Drill Walker Price: $69.99 Pieces: 759 Bought from: Tor R Us in Michigan, US. The Box: First we have the front. It shows the Set, it's functuns, and the Limited edition sign. The box is huge, about the size of the Dino Attack chopper set or the Mars Mission Base. Nowadays, most set that are $50.00 or more have a flap displaying the sets functions. Opening theflap on this box Reveals a GIGANTIC picture of the set. And the back. The bags, numbered: Next, the manuals. They have piece call outs, page numbers, etc. There are 2 manuals with this set. Sticker Sheets: They actually aren't all that bad. Random Manual image: Build: First, we open bag 1. This will build the Alien Craft and the minifigures. Now here we have some interesting parts. A green spine from Exo-force, and a black rim for the set Container Stacker. Next we start the build on the alien craft. It is pretty sturbdy, but has no cockpit for the alien. The alien stickers are really cool. They are rainbow-ish, and has a silver back. Next come the build on the wings: And the finished craft. It is pretty good, and has a nice sleek design. However, I think I will use the large ship for the commander out this year to fight the driller instead. Next is bag 2, which builds the rover and Astro Ship. First is the Ship. It starts off with Doctor Inferno's colors. It builds up very nice, and the detail is absolutley amazing. Next the roof is built. It has some speed racer slopes. The hinge piee now has a hole through it. Sorry for the blurry pic: More is added: Then comes the bottom piece. The detail is very nice, and the hinge piece has a use later on. Then you build the crates. Each one holds two crystals. Added to the ship, also a pic of the finished ship. Here we start the rover. It sports anice detail- The orange studs get coveded by the grill to look more like an engine. The detail in this thing is pretty good. It has a gun and shovel. Here is how it fits into the ship: It slides in... And is secured thanks to the hinge. Okay, so next we open the number 3 bag, which builds the body. Here are some interesting pieces: Then we start the build. It begins nice and study: I just love these stickers with the bulldogs on them: More of the build, with the stickers added: Next we add in the front part. The detail is again, outstanding. With the turntable added. It can move down as well. The next step is to build the water tank. It utilizes the bionicle boosters(big white things) And added to the walker: Then we build that drill. It uses a lot of rims and such. With the gears added: The front part uses a lot of those new droideka 3-prong things. And bionicle eyes. The drill can spin thanks to the gears. And added to the vehical: Next is the cockpit. It has a nice space for the Astro's bckpack. Added: The final stage is the legs. Thank god they aren't like Striking venoms. They are all the same, however. See those two rubber parts? Those keep it in place when on surfaces like glass. Next come the large part of the legs. These are similar to the Assault Tiger's legs. The final result is very sturdy, thanks too... Notice the amazing classic space sticker? So we finally come down to this: The final result is amazing. It is sturdy, and has great detail. It is very realistic. And, when the ship is removed, the drill goes down, and the turret is aimed up... Hope you all enjoyed the review!	positive

Wonderful review. I'd die if I had to upload that many pictures... Man, this is it: the pinacle of Mars Mission's second and final year. Man, this baby is flawless. There are so many indications that the designers took care in designing this kit - like the space for the pilot's backpack, the compartment for the mini flier, the sturdy leg design - etc etc etc. Kudos to TLC for making Mars Mission go out with a bang.

OK, minus ten for the placeholder, but plus about ten million for the review. This set is just amazing. It's really earned it's colors, and I'm sure no Classic Space fan can complain, even Snefroe . I didn't know it had the tilting function for the drill- S@H is so pathetic with its pictures, and they really missed this amazing function. The detachable ship is so cute, it's almost Classic Space in it's design. Major thumbs up to TLC. Hell, make it a hug, even.	positive

Nice review! I don't mind the set, but, at the same time, I'm not particularly fond of it.	negative
Looks like a great set, i may consider making this the first mars mission set i buy. Nice review also. But Quote Lol, thanks. I just wanted to claim my place for the review. Personally i don't think you had a place to claim. Somebody else could have also gotten this set and had a proper review ready before yours but felt it was wrong to post because you had posted a placeholder ( ClubNinja in this case). I think placeholders should be banned and if you are not ready to post a full review you should not post anything. Simple really. Either that or what is the policy on here regarding more than one review of a set being posted - then you could have both posted reviews and it wont really matter i guess. Just my 2 cents worth Thanks for the review though.	positive
Today i'm gonna review the bigger of the 2 castles from the fright knigh theme. I got this one last week at a pretty fair prive at ebay, new and still sealed. I love opening boxes that had been lying arounf for years and being the first to build an old set. Since i know this castle theme is not liked so much by the general public, i'll try here and change their minds, cause i really think this is a great set. This time i have to say my pictures turned out pretty amazing, even if i am still using just my cellphone cam, but i'm really pleased now with the quality. Here we go! Set Nr.: 6097 Name: Night Lord's Castle Number of minifigs: 7 Number of pieces: 598 Release Year: 1997 Let's start with a few box & instructions pictures: The inside od the box, with a few alternate models: The back, with another possibility how to assemble the 3 main parts: Instructions: Next, the 6 minifigs, starting with the witch on her black dragon: All 5 figures of the fright section: And the poor royal knight: We go on with the set itself, first a general overview (it's really high!): On the "first floor" there's a trap with which you can drop stones or other things down on unliked guests, the pot comes originally from fabuland i think, i love this thing: In the same floor there is a second trap, if you pull the bar, the door opens: We move on to the tower itself (did i mention it's really high?), on the ground level there's the place for the witch to do her spells: The wall is a secret door, which reveals a skeleton when turned over: on the next level there is this little thingy, first it only seems like a barrel.... ...but when you pull the two 1x4 tiles on the back, a skull is being revealed, scary, huh : I don't really understand what this is for but i assume it's a telescope to watch and observate the dragons, i do find that a bit senseless since there haven't been telescopes in medieval times (or have there been): The back of the tower with the prison and the room for the treasure chest: The prison opened. It's secured with a chain, which i like very much cause you really can lock it with that: Treasure chest: From the highest peak we now go down to the very ground level, at the back of the castle there is another secret wall-door, flanked by two shields: At the back half of the inside there is the throne hall for the Bat Lord, with a nice warm fireplace in the back (this is, where the secret door is placed): The second half is pretty empty, except for these two baskets. i don't know exactly what they are for, but i ike the idea for using them as water places for the horses: One thing that might be a bit stupid is that 2 of the 4 side entrances do not have doors, so they are open and a guard would have to stand there the whole day. You can see it in his face he isn't very happy with that : That was my last review of the sets i got the last weeks, but i'm looking forward to make much more in the future. Overall this is a pretty good set, i don't know any other one with so much details and playability. The minus point is, as already said, that it is too open on the sides, but that can be solved easily with a bit of modding. Also i must say, this set isn't that much juniorized as many might have thought, though the design is a bit unconventional, but exactly that's what i like most about it. All in all it gets a 9/10 for me hope you enjoyed the reading and the pictures, can't wait to see your response. Edit: Oops, i forgot to put one figure of the fright knight faction on the photo, but it's the one in the last picture. Edited by KimT, 10 August 2008 - 01:28 PM.	positive
Sweet review, metalandi! This set always looked a bit too busy for my liking, I guess I just didn't expect to see a set so tall. After seeing your review though, it is growing on me. I like all the play features, and at the very least it's a great parts pack. Two things I'm confused about though. In this pic, is that dragon being used as a swing set? And I don't get why the area where the witch casts her spells on the second floor is green. Green in Castle means grass (or Forestmen... ), and having grass on the second floor of a building is just weird. I understand that it's modular and thus it would make sense if it were placed on the ground, but dark grey would make just as much sense, and would look much better than the green there IMO. Anyway, I'm just fussy. Thanks again for the cool review, will we be seeing any more? ~Peace	negative
@iamded: yes it seems the dragon is used as such in the picture of the alternate model, but i guess bad and evil knights also wanna have some fun sometimes you are right with the green plate on the second floor, it does look a bit disturbing. but that can	negative

Metalandi, thanks for doing this Fright Knights review, by opening up a MISB set which you have bought recently. I am very sure the feeling is very nice, especially touching the bricks which is preserved for 11 years sealed in bags. I am quite fond of the Fright Knights theme. Unfortunately, this theme was released during my dark age. I never really bought sets from Fright Knights. Instead, I bought plenty of minifigs to build an army. If I could turn back time or find another MISB set with a reasonable price, I am very sure I will get it. My soldiers need a castle to stay in. I will be looking forward to your next review. Keep up the good job	neutral
I read this review not long after you posted it, but I'm not sure why I didn't comment... If Dragonator is the one to post everytime he sees a dragon related topic, I would be the one to post if I see a Fright Knights topic. Fright Knights is one of my favourite Lego themes, and this review is really good! I got both of the castles in the theme and loved them, and your review presents Basil the Batlord's castle well. I too thought it was a bit weird that there is a green base when it could be grey, but I guess it's a useful piece to use in other things. Fright Knights On!	positive
Ah this brings back memories, i have this set and i loved the playabilaty factor opposing to older castle sets i have! In medieval times there actually were primitive telescopes, you can read about it here. Thanks for this review, great storie, great pics!	positive
Wow, what a cool castle and set in general! I had no idea that this set existed (long dark ages) Thanks to you metalandi for such a great review! The figures look really nice and the set is full of lots of little trinkets , details, traps etc! I have already had a look on ebay for this set. Looks like a great set for parts too. I give the review 4.5/5 evil witches. Cheers ISC	positive
Sandy, on Aug 5 2008, 06:21 PM, said: My first post in this topic looks foolish now that I bought this set from Ebay. I just really wanted the minifigs (although I already had the Batlord and the black dragon) and the parts. They will help me greatly in building the Impenetrable Fortress of the Dragonwarriors for my Princess Quest comic. By the end of this week, this set will be in my clutches! Great! Can't wait for the next installment! Good review, the pieces are so shiny and new... All my Space sets aren't shiny... Or new... This is an excellent castle, I got it the day it came out, it has a lot of playability.	positive
metalandi, on Aug 6 2008, 01:40 PM, said: Well, that the bricks look new comes from that they ARE new. I got this set new and unopened I know, pretty good deal!	positive
I got a couple of the small sets from this line when it came out. Recently, I acquired several more from Bricklink because I just really love the way they look. This theme really had good intentions, but the execution was flawed. I hope one day Lego returns to a darker tone, but maybe next time it could be more Castlevania inspired. That would really turn some heads! Plus, vampires and gothic aesthetics are really popular now. It will probably have run its course by the time Lego would be able to develop a theme around them, though.	negative
Fire Station Set #: 6382 Year Released: 1980/1981 Piece Count: 368 Minifigs: 4 List Price: approx. $20 Lego's third fire station was this little gem, 6382. The set offered new design elements not previously offered in previous sets. What really stands out for me is 1x3 car doors and torsos with printed designs. A decal was used for the large sign on the building and the #1 on the hood of one of the vehicles. I think this was also the first set to offer the sliding garage mechanism, a feature that added a great amount of realism and playability. The set also included two blue doors and the new fire hose with pre-connected faucet/spicket. Getting on to the pictures. I saved the cover of the box for this set but lost the instructions over the years. I was able to download some instructions from the web. Here's a shot of the box cover: And the back of the box: The set includes four figs, three of which are fireman, and a lady who can serve as a dispatcher. As mentioned above, the torsos are printed on: My favorite of the two vehicles included, I love the design of Fire Engine #1: I always loved the fire hoses included in this set. No string to have to tie or freyed ends: Engine #2 is this much larger engine with ladder. I like how it contains an oxygen tank and fire axe: On the other side of the engine are two shutter doors that reveal the hose and ladder controls. These are stickers: The ladder is much wider than previous Lego ladders and extends a good length: I like the baseplate of this set which has the numbers ONE and TWO marking each garage: The building is simple but has a nice design. I love the sliding garage doors: NOTE: Notice the two windows of the 2nd floor. The actual set should have blinds on these windows. I've lost one of the stickered windows, so placed the single blinded window on the 1st floor. Each of the two sides of the garages are the same. Here's a shot of the right side: On the first floor is the dispatch area and a classic blue Space computer: The 2nd floor has a bed and a chair: Here's a shot of the entire backside: And lastly, a shot of the entire station: This set is one of my favorite fire stations that offers a great amount of playability. Hope you enjoyed the review.	positive
This is a great set and a great review - Thanks for doing these! I remember my brother getting this set (I got the police station 6384 on the same day). Truly classic sets - It's a shame that I don't have them anymore although I do have the two immediate descendants of the sets... Cheers Rog	positive
Great review again it's nice to see old sets reviewed. I love the control stickers there's a great level of detail this is really the second best fire station in my opinion.	positive
Lovely!! I can't stop making comparisons between this fire station and last year's, which is also very well detailed, with great features and awesome playability. The concept design of the second one it's very much like the one reviewed here. This is good as TLG is taking back those great values to make the new excellent sets we all are enjoying by now!	positive
I have a slightly different version of this set, and i must say it is great! Boy to these reviews bring back memories, thanks!	positive
Great review. I love tis set too, the best firestation ever made by lego. Mainly because the '80s sets are the favourite with me. Only I miss a helicopterplatvorm, well I made a little modification:	positive
I must agree great fire station, I love the fact that in the classic sets you were given a base plate and some other great idea's. I do miss the addition of base plates and alternate building idea's.

Fire Copter 1 This is FC-1, OVER. I'm making my way to Main Street now. The smoke is coming from the Legoland Hotel, OVER. That's a roger. I'm going to shoot the 500 gallon now, OVER... Fire in your Tabletown? No problem. Lego's set 6685 Fire Copter is sure to put it out - classic style. Set #: 6685 Year Released: 1982 Piece Count: 99 Minifigs: 1 List Price: unknown Here's a great fire-themed addition to your classic Legoland display. Starting with the instructions: The set includes one classic fireman with a nicely printed fireman torso: What a great little detailed helicopter. I love the use of the red and yellow colors: The front opens to allow your fireman to quickly climb in: In the back are two round yellow 2x2 bricks for the water supply and a hose connected on each side. Unfortunately, I lost one of the hoses. And the entire set. Isn't she a beauty? 6685 Fire Copter 1 is a great supplement to set 6382 Fire Station released one year earlier. After buying this great little set, I had fun puting out fires all over my Tabletown. Oops, I think I smell one now...	positive
TheBrickster, thank you so much for all these reviews of classic Town sets!! OMFG, this set was released in 1982 and I was born 1 year earlier, hehe :) Nice little heli!	neutral
Good, but I like the heli of set 6571 better: Another "4" from me.	positive
A nice little model with some neat features for it's age plus the all-yime classic fireman as a bonus. However, this design of chopper (the police station around the same time was the same design) I think dated very quickly. While is was good to use the hinged car roof - which was relatively new at the time - together with the inverted screen it was superceded very quickly by designs that stood the test of time far better (for example 6657). Also, I don't think I could everbuy a Lego fire helicopter because it is not something we have in the UK/Eire. Police, Coast Guard, Ambulance, military, etc, etc but no fire helicopters. Not something I would therefore want in my Lego Town. Great review though. Many thanks again for doing these. Cheers Rog	negative
Well its ok but its not great voted 3 Seems the classic town hater has voted a 1 AGAIN!!!! Will the madness ever stop!?!	neutral
I vote outstanding because it makes excellent use of the pieces that were available at the time. That cockpit makes excellent use of an inverted windshield.	positive
Hello all Eurobricks members and Town Lovers, Today, I will be doing up a review on Snorkel Squad, one of the most important and basic vehicle in any Fire Department. Snorkel Squad, in simple english terms, it refers to Fire Engine, fighting fire, always on standby, ready to save the citizens from crisis. Trust me, you will understand why this Snorkel Squad is superb impressive by the end of this review. On a side note, there is only part that is replaced by another color. Can you find the difference? Name: Snorkel Squad Theme: LEGO System / Town Year: 1987 Pieces: 151 Minifigs: 2 Price: USD$13.50 An image of a 6358, Snorkel Squad Looking smart on their stand-by This snorkel squad is a fanastic fire engine, that is ready to save people from the fires. It's primary color "red" is used in all fire emergency department and vehicles. In case of any emergency, this snorkel squad will be activated and arrived at the scene as soon as possible. No time to waste! Personally, this is the best fire engine that I had ever seen. Meet the Fire Fighters It comes with two brave fire fighters. Both of them wear the standard fire fighter outfit that is present in almost all Fire Station sets in Classic Town. The torso is very nice and formal, and looks real impressive onto them. I love the buttons on them. Furthermore, these white helmets are a symbol to the world of Fire Fighting. These are the people whom save lives by risking their own lives in dangerous situations. Water Hose compartment The water hose is a string that is stored in the front. It can be rolled out, and the fire fighters are able to use it without much difficulty. They will just pull out the hose and spray onto the fire. The next picture, shows a much clearer look in its interior. In addition, the fire logo that is on the compartment, is actually printed. Yes, it's not a sticker, and that is great news for us! Interesting features These clamps on both sides, is supposed to stablise the fire engine when the ladder is heading upwards. It is a simple mechanism, which illustrate clearly what it does. This feature is recently seen in Construction vehicle such as the Mobile Crane. Of course, it is not a complicated feature. It just made use of three quite common white parts. Swivel Mechanism These swivel mechanism, in my opnion are very fun to play with. These connectors on the front and the back, enable the long fire engine, to make sharp turns on any junctions, arriving at the scene fast enough. This is not a fire engine that only travel straight roads. Try it onto your base plates, and you will be surprised, how well it can turn. Best Playable mechanism in 6358 The driver will be activating the ladder at the back of the vehicle. In order, to adjust the height and making sure that the ladder do not fall short, the tiles on the plates are acting like a stoppage. The ladder are able to rotate 360 degree without much problem, if you removed the driver out of the control panel. It goes up as tall as 30cm! Look at that amazing height. Too bad, I have not constructed my Cafe Corner yet. Otherwise, I can give you a better feel of how amazing this baby can go. I used the old road baseplate as a guide, and roughly it can goes as tall as 30 to 35cm. Look at the black hinges below. By shifting it to the last, that was the maximum height it can move. This is a very good way to adjust the height. Oh, and I forget to mention that there are 2 storage compartments for the fighters to place their equipments behind. Quite easy to access. No doors? Apart from the standard roof top on the driver's seat, there is no doors present at both side. I am quite sad to see that there are no doors. Maybe, these fighters are supposed to jump off the seat, instead of opening the doors? Well, I guess this is the only major flaws that I had found in this set. Heading off *Got you* Meet the Model 6358 Fire Engine Summary review Playability: 10/10 (Superb fun. The ladder and swivel mechanism is really very fun to play with.) Design: 9.5/10 (Excellent design. It got an almost full 10. The lack of doors, dropped my ratings slightly.) Price: 8/10 (A very mid range price. I don't think it cost very expensive. But, I am not sure how much it cost now.) Overall: 9.2/10 (Best Fire Engine ever, and one of the great looking one too. Get this model now.) I gave it a "5" based on my Review Score Card. What about yours? Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed. Pictures can be found in My Brickshelf (When moderated)	positive
A truly great set. I always loved the mobile crane and was gobsmacked when this popped up using some of the great features from the crane but also making it an emergency vehicle too! Great classic firemen and - in your version - a suspiciously blue fire extinguisher Great review of a great set - Just a pity I no longer have it... So many sets I used to have got lost during the period at the end of my childhood before I rescued what was left from my Dad's house once I realised what I had left behind!! Hindsight is a great thing?? Cheers again Rog	positive
A great review, I like this set it captures the classic town feeling well, and the ladder is cool! I can't help but feel thought that these reviews are being churned out to quickly, you should leave a gap, I am being flooded with all these great reviews!	neutral

Guys, thanks for all of your wonderful and encouraging comments, towards this set. This was one of my most favourite set in the late 1980s, and I am glad to restore it somehow, with a small little part missing, which could not be that hard to replace. BerndDasBrot, on Jul 22 2008, 12:06 AM, said: But this review induced me to get over this humiliation from my childhood ( ) and check ebay for the 6358. Bernd, I am glad reviews like these, mananged to change your perception towards this set. Honestly, this is a very good set to pass by, and I hope I had highlight the key features in this set. Hope you will have an easy time, getting it from eBay or Bricklink. rriggs, on Jul 22 2008, 12:31 AM, said: Great classic firemen and - in your version - a suspiciously blue fire extinguisher Good job, by spotting the replacement part, which is hiding among them.

You should really take some time off, and sit in front of the Town and Trains forum, looking through at your childhood memories, where classic reviews like this are released in this forum. I am leaving some gaps in between my reviews now. I supposed Brickster will slow down soon. Captain green hair, on Jul 22 2008, 02:07 AM, said: This definitly is a nice set, i think this was also the first set to use that white basket CGH, you are absolutely right. This is the first set that made use of the white basket component. In fact, there is only 2 sets in the entire LEGO theme which have make used of the white basket. It is the 6477 which is released in 2000. I am quite surprised after 13 years, they are able to produced it again. TheBrickster, on Jul 22 2008, 10:10 AM, said: What an awesome little set! I really like this engine but don't remember seeing it during the late 80s. It must have been out during my Dark Ages. I love the basket/section for the firemen. Equally nice is the fire hose which extends a good length. The color combination of red with white and the trans. blue windshield looks goos as well. This is a great engine and one that would look perfect in a classic tabletown - and it's 4-studs wide! Very nice review WhiteFang. I look forward to seeing more of your Classic Town reviews. You shared the same sentiments as I do. It's a pity that set was released during the Dark Age of yours. On the other hand, these sets are my childhood sets which I grew up with. More Classic Town reviews, all the way! Edit: This is my 1000th Eurobricks post since I joined! It has been another great milestone for me, in Eurobricks! Edited by WhiteFang, 22 July 2008 - 06:46 AM.	neutral
That's a great review/poll, WhiteFang! I gave this set a 5: It's simply ! The only thing which I miss are the respirators for the firemen since they already own air tanks. But otherwise this set is brilliant! I like it much more than the new one from 2007 since it's not that big and juniorized. Klaus-Dieter	positive
Quote I am not against with the newer sets. It just that, part of the reasons which reflected in the review had fufill the basic key factors of a typical Fire Engine. In addition, it was my all-time favourite under the "Fire-Fighting" theme. Yes, I agree! This set is wonderful even today, and is one of the best fire kits ever release. And actually, realistic scale is not really a necessity in lego - it's just my personal taste. For example, I've never liked the tiny planes in the old airports that much, but I can see why a lot of people like them better than the new ones. Edited by Grevious, 28 July 2008 - 03:17 PM.	neutral
One of my all time favourite I still love it even after all these years, though it did always seem a bit out of place as when I was a child I’d never seen a similar looking fire appliance in the UK.	positive

I just got this set Sunday, and it's so HUGE that I can't put it anywhere. It is pretty sturdy and heavy, that's where the handle comes in. I'm pissed that you only get 2 clones. Rex has to fight on the ground while you need more clones to man the guns/cockpit. The legs were the most annoying and time consuming part of the build. And yea I agree, that if TLG had made numbered bags, it would have taken only 2 hours rather than 4. Edited by iH Master 13uilder17, 14 October 2008 - 11:38 PM.	negative
I bought this a few weeks ago and absolutely loved making it. It's amazing how the paneling comes together to make such a tight fit, but can easily open up. The legs could have been a bit more poseable, and the guns don't launch easily unless you push hard and fast. I'd like the firing mechanism to launch more smoothly. But it looks absolutely amazing. About price, it was ¥13,000 where I am, but I'm used to Lego being expensive in Japan, so it was good value.	positive

Exactly Kim, that's what I meant. I pondered and wondered that for a long time :) I decided to ask here when a friend wondered the same thing. I hope it fits with the new droship. It would be really cool. And it's also great that TLG knows what they'll be prodcuing a year later..	neutral

I got this set in the spring during my "buy every new Castle set available"-season. Granted, I couldn't afford all of them, but I do have most of them now. Anyway, I love the action elements to this set, and the siege tower really does look wicked. I'd like to attach the Crownie tower to the King's Castle to see how it fits, but I unfortunately don't own that set (yet). I also love the turning head of the soldier, and I've used it in my Princess Quest-comic as well, along with the turning head of the princess. The Troll Leader brings good variety to the army of trolls, but they still could use another face type and more torso options. It's a nice review, in any case, although the set pretty much speaks for itself.	positive
Hey, good review and good photos. I also got this set just recently, and I wasn't very enthusiastic about it at the beginning, but after I built it I could appreciate it. The siege engine is very nice, but my complaint has do with the proportions of the knight's tower in respect to the trolls' machine - it's a bit smaller, and less bulkier. That complaint has to go with some other sets too. For example the troll warship is really humongous - it feels like it can load the evil wizard's tower and sail off. Other than that - a good set, I like it, 4/5 from me.	positive
Excellent review and your pictures are very good, I look forward to seeing more review. I really like this set I got it some time ago and keep meaning to post some pictures of it going up against some of the older castles.	positive
Very nice review Pedro! You beat me to it. There was a review done about January, but i wanted to have a go, just haven't opened the box yet..... Great pics and well demonstrated action elements too. I rate this as one of the coolest Castle sets just for its playability and 5 figures. This will def add to my Orc army, and i may purchase more of this set if they dont release a Orc BP.

Great review! This is an awesome set. Besides knocking down the wall at the side, can the battering ram do any other damage to the tower (ex, reducing it to rubble bricks)? And why can't the orc just jump out of the hole in the back? Do they need to do that much unnecessary damage to the tower?	neutral

Pedro, for your first review, you have amaze me with your photo session and the strucutre of your review. I am very impressed by your high quality pictures. You have done an excellent job! I love the Tower Raid very much, as it offers high playability. With the wall and flooring, falling down, when the ram hits the wall, it's quite interesting to play with. The mechanism of the ram is very fun to play with as well. I will try and pull back and released it, to knock a row of soldiers. This is one of my favourite sets in Castle 2008. Well done.	positive

You have done an excellent job! I completely agree. This is an amazing review - bits of humor, great photography, and detailed descriptions/photos. Based upon this review I've placed an order for this set (along with some convincing from Amazon's 20% sale ). The only drawbacks in this set that I can see concerns the tower with it being 1) small compared to the seige tower and 2) missing a few walls. However, this is also the joy of LEGO as one can simply purchase a few bricks and build their own walls and/or expand the tower's size (or even attach it to a castle). Of course, this increases the price of the set, but considering how cheap bricks are on BrickLink, Tower Raid is still a very good value. I hope you continue doing reviews, pedro.	positive

Name: Jungle Duel Set ref: 7624 Number of minifigs: 3 Number of pieces: 90 Price: $9.00 A basic review of 7624 (my apologies for the blurry and grainy pictures my camera is acting up ): The build is nothing speicial on to the figs Indiana Jones, Mutt Williams and Irina Spalkoi, nice array of minifigs although I think they should have included a russian soldier or two. If you look to the right on Mutts jacket it has his name in script, the tent is great aside from the fact that the fabric bends easily a nice amount of speicial pieces the weapons rack is pretty nifty so is the table when you swap the white piece with a black one overall it is a very nice set, the $10.00 price tag isnt so bad either, thanks for reading.

The Coast Guard quad, because I live in the Netherlands, and we don't have the 'dino attack theme', we have dino 2010, which have a diffrent quad. So I would like to chose the Dino Attack one, but as I don't one him, Goast Guard. though. But I also don't have the coast guard one, but I like him, but I also don't have the coast quard one as well. Greets The-Force! Edited by THE-FORCE, 01 August 2008 - 11:18 PM.	positive
, that was a weird race! Anyway, I love the look of both sets, but i'll have to go for the Dino Attack Quad for a couple of reasons: It is post-apoc, which I love, features tan and dark red colours which are far more useful than yellow, you get more "bang for your buck" with the Dino set, you get a little dino (sure you can hate it but better than not having one right?), and the fig has much more useful pieces and a better face. Thanks for the face off TheBrickster! Batbrick Away!	positive
that was an intresting race And i was split between the two until i saw whitefang`s reply and the fact you can use the sprinter as a militery thing(which you could do for both but sprinter just pulls it off better) and i like the radar on the back of it so i`ll have to go with the street sprinter. thanks for the nice topic brickster	positive
I've got to go with the town one, since you have to stand on the dino one. Steve	positive
I like the Coast Guard one, but Dinos eat Coast Guard people, so Dinos ftw. And I think the dino bike would fit in with my collection pretty well.	positive
i like the dino thingy because of the pieces and the dino is a lot of fun on its own (i know, thats akward)...	positive
Dino Attack for me! You just cant say no to a huge Bazooka! Though the tan and dark red works for me too	positive
The Rancor, on Aug 2 2008, 09:39 AM, said: I wish I had that but I'll have to make do with the much less violent European Version (Dino '2010' not 'ATTACK') Here's a comaprison... European Version: USA etc. version: There's a subtle difference, but I prefer the US one I did not know that Europe had a different quad (or at least one without the bazooka). Interesting that the gun was removed from the European sets, or added to the US sets. I sort of like the chain. I also notice a big difference in the boxart. Destroyed city to prehistoric volcano. I wonder if the story was different as well? Thanks for sharing a good picture. ----------------------------------------- Well, it does look like the Dino Quad has the upper hand; almost double the votes.	positive
ooooooh! this is a very hard choice,i like this new coast guard theme but i LOVED! Dino Attack.The Dino Attack set has a weird looking gun,but IMO the Coast Guard set looks.........cleaner if you get what i mean.The little Dino/lizard thing is practically worthless (thats why i have a bin full of those little guys).I want to keep liking Dino Attack i just can't.So i know your like "just get to the point already!" so i guess i have to go with coast guard.

Price: 569 kr Minifigs: 2 Pieces: 592 Stickers: 9 (My sticker sheet wasn’t curled up) Overview: Before I start I will apologize for the bad quality of the pictures. It is getting dark here right now, so some of the pictures are a bit dark. 1) Minifigs: The set comes with two of the new Clone Wars clone troopers, which in my opinion are pretty cool. It also comes with two short blasters and a bag of clone accessories. Figs with helmets: Figs without helmets: 2) The tank: This thing is HUGE (25cm long and 22cm wide), and far oversized in my opinion, but looks great nonetheless. I very much like the white and dark red color scheme, mixed with a bit of lime green (even though there is no lime green bricks ;) ). Left side: Right side: Back side: Both of the wings contain a hidden compartment to store the blasters and a part that rotates to reveal three flickfire missiles. The front opens up as well to reveal the engine. The side guns and the gun on the top rotate. Inside the cockpit is space for two figs; one seated in front of two computer screens and one placed in a moveable seat, which moves up and down, allowing the fig to pop up the top hatch and staying hidden while the hatch is closed. This function is triggered by opening the backdoor. Hidden compartment and missiles: Engine: Top hatch (open/closed): Interior: 3) Rating: Build: 9/10 Not much to say here. Minifigs: 7/10 An extra fig or two would have been great; eventually a Jedi or a commando. Design: 8/10 This only looses a couple of points for being oversized, but it’s a great looking model. Parts: 10/10 At 592 parts, this is one of the CW sets with the best parts/price ratio. Price: 8/10 Sure this thing is great, but I think its overpriced at 569 kr. (approx. $120). When build it feels more like a 450 kr. Set. Final verdict: 9/10 Despite some flaws this thing is definitely recommended, and it looks great on your shelf, too ;)	positive
I know it would really go well with the RGS but it is not enough for £50. Ill wait for the Sales at Christmas.	negative
Nice review , for Portugal it costs 60€. I also consider it oversized, it shold be the third of that size... Portugal and Spain may have good prices but 90€ for the V-19 must be a tippo.	negative
Finally a review of this, thanks! 120 bucks? This tank looks tiny and though it's amazingly detailed it should have been smaller and only 40/50 bucks at most. It just doesn't play that big a part man. Good pieces and mechanisms but no one's going to both buying a 120 buck tank, no offence, not unless it it's the AT-TE.	negative
Im really mad. This isn't even out in the US. I want this set really bad.	negative
Thanks for the review! I think this is my favourite Clone Wars set, behind the Republic Gunship.	positive
One question... Do the top panels on the rotating rocket assembly mounted in the skids pop off regularly when you flip them back and forth? The ones on the version I built from the instructions posted online seem to eject with the slightest provocation	neutral
I'll probably get this in Hong Kong where LEGO is cheap next time I go there to visit my relatives. Also pretty nice review, a few more pics couldn't hurt. Also are there just two of the same white control computers for the controls? That's what it looks like in the instructions. Edited by Skipper 24, 01 August 2008 - 08:41 PM.	positive
You lucky turd. Seriously, good job with the review.	neutral
Thanks for the review, Christian, I was hoping for one soon . This set really looks good, but as you said, rather big. The figs are good, and I agree that Ki-Adi Mundi should be included. I like the hidden compartments for the blasters and missiles, and the cockpit is really cool, considering it seats two (I thought only one). I will surely pick this up sometime.	positive

Great review! I really like the look of this set, and having played a lot of battlefront I am quite keen to pick one up in Australia when it comes out (after the DS is paid off) Looks like some nice greebling and cool colour scheme too.	positive
Must buy now!!!! totally sweet! Not available in canada yet Well designed and cheap (for clone wars!) I'm going to mod it so that it looks like the imperial version	positive
I am 100% going to get this set! It should be about $55 and if it is, i'll get it without a doubt! I just hope that this set is $50-$60. If it isn't, then we have a problem...	positive
Thanks for posting the review, I’ve been wondering about this set. To me it does feel a bit fig light, for £50 I’d expect maybe one or two more clones. I’m not to sure about the oversized issue, it seems to me it’s better to have something a bit to large and have a better level or features than something smaller will less.	negative
This set costs a S$100 in singapore.I went to Hng Kong too see lego and the shops there are more expensive by a few dollars.However,I went to Australia before and everything there is the same price but when there is a sale it becomes very cheap!Anyway, thanks for the review!I was wondering about the details of this set.The clone's faces look a lot like anakin's face.Why is that so?I thought it is supposed to look like jango's?	neutral
I personally think this is a great set, but a little pricey. I wish it was available in the US though.	positive
4478 Geonosian Fighter review Parts:169 Figs:4 Price:?15.00 (I think) Here is a review of the amazing Geonosian Fighter set, it was my first ever Star Wars LEGO set! Here go's... 1. Manual Not much here although it's an old style manual cover. Random shot. Back. 2. General set and minifigs A pic of the entire set, it has 2 reddish tan Battle Droids Geo pilot, Geo soldier, Geo Star Fighter and Geo turret. The 4 figs, the droids come with backpacks. Geo soldier. I prefer this gun. Give him a cane to become Poggle the Lesser the Geo leader. Detailed legs are always nice. The bodies are a little fat for Geonosians I guess but nice printing on them. The head. The wings. 1. 2. 3. Voila! All done 3. The Star Fighter It has a landing gear type thing. The detail on those plates. The pilot in the cockpit. Cockpit with canopy. 1 of 2 ball joint things, this is the engine. 2nd ball joint which is the front gun. 4. The turret The turret by itself. Turret with the soldier. A printed round plate. 5. Overall Build: 7/10 A little repetitive but enjoyable. Minifigs: 9/10 4 that's pretty good for a set this size. Design: 6/10 The fighter dosen't really look right nor does the turret but they are both strong. Parts: 8/10 Lot's of interesting parts and comes with two of the ball joint things as well the minifig parts being good. Price: 10/10 Cheap (for the UK) considering the amount of minifigs and parts. Playability: 5/10 not much but you can have mini battles with the turret and starfighter. Overall: 8/10 I gave it 8 because of the design which was not accurate and the low number of parts. Thanks for reading and hope you liked it as much as I did . Edited by KimT, 04 August 2008 - 11:42 AM. indexed	positive
Good review. I would get this set, but sadly they don't have it anymore.... I wish they did to get those sweet figs! The battle droid colors are sweet! The only set with geonosians....	neutral
Great review! Man doI wish I had those red droids. I'm using the Dell XPS-1, and holy crap is it clear. Those pics were beautiful!	positive
I always thought this looked liek a cool set, with lots of nice (and sadly unique) pieces. Unfortunately the only Attack of the Clones sets I got were the Jedi Starfighter and Yoda vs Dooku. Amazing sets, but I would love to have owned them all. I'd never really looked into this set very much, so thanks for the review!	positive
This is actually one of my favorite Star Wars sets. Awesome rare pieces, and excellent construction. Geo figs are a plus too. Best of all, it's nice and cheap.	positive
Good review! I really liked the detailed geonosians, and I hope theyre in a later set so i can get more. Knowing lego they'll release a huge arena playset with a few geos and sand red droids so people will buy the set just for them. jifel	positive
I am fairly confident that something involoving geonosis will be released in 2010 but any way I had this set ( one of my first ones) but i droped the ship and it blew up. I found all the pieces but in never rebuilt the ship. Although I still have the figs ant the canon. Overall this set was above average in my opinion. Great review!!!	positive
7263 TIE Fighter Review Parts: 159 Figs: 2 Price £20.00 (not sure) My 2nd review today! This set came out about the same time as the ROTS sets and included the first minifig to have a LUL. 1. Box & Manual This is the front of the box, it has a try me slot for the LUL Vader. A close up of the try me slot. Luckily I got mine form Argos so no little kids have been playing around with it. The manual cover. I'm not quite sure why it has a pic of the figs on the front but it doesn't deface it so I don't mind. Random manual shot. ROTS set preview at the back of the manual. 2. General set and figs The contents of the set. # The minifigs. A normal TIE pilot and the first ever LUL fig DV. (Also my only LUL fig) No helmets. TIE Pilot torso. The LUL is made of 3 parts. Lighted up. The LED for the blade. 3. The TIE Fighter Just a pic of it. Cockpit with controls. TIE pilot sitting in the cockpit. By the way the hinge brick is the wrong color it is supposed to be grey. The cockpit shut. I wonder why TLC never printed those cockpit glass things correctly. Jet out the back. Top plate has some nice printing. 5. Overall Build: 5/10 very repetitive...well the ships symmetrical! Minifigs: 4/10 1 TIE pilot which is okay but a LUL Vader he can't even fit in the ship. Design: 6/10 strong but the wings are all wobbly if that makes sense. I don't like the blue either. Parts: 6/10 Lots of blue grills thingy's not much else but it got 6 because of the wings plates. Price: 5/10 Could have been more expensive. At least it had 2 figs. Playability: 1/10 Can't do much as a stand alone set. Overall: 4/10 There just isn't enough here. It could at least have a better color scheme and instead of DV it could come with a Stormie like the old one did.	negative
Great review! Really shows off the main aspects of the set. Wish I had picked up a TIE when they were around... DSR	positive
This set was on my wanted list for a long time and the sales at S@H came just in time I also loved the set, and like you only put the stickers on the toll both (it looks great on a town layout with almost no modifications). The racers are great. The trucks and the limo are the best in my oppinion. The sticker sheet is huge, but I've seen bigger. Stickers over multiple pieces are the worst The slammers are ok, but not great. I played with my 4 years old son and we tryed to do what shows in the box (the cars passing the toll, jumping the ramps and crashing the trucks) but it is very difficult to get it right. But the crashes are very fun.	positive
Thanks for the review. I'll definately get this set sooner or later. IMO the Tiny Turbos are awesome. I actually bought nearly every set so far, built the models, added the stickers and packed them away in zip-lock bags in the attic. Sadly I don't have display room for them (yet). A fine set, carwise.. Dump the slammers and buildings into the spare bag and keep the cars. KimT TINY TURBOS ON!	positive
Tiny Turbos are good for parts, but I'm not so keen on them as they have no minifig drivers. So, I wasn't sure about this set. But your review has made me like them more, I probably won't buy the set but I appreciate it more. Thanks for the review!	positive

As my summer holiday was kinda wet for 2 weeks, I decided to shop some sets. I crossed the German border and bought me this one mainly for the parts. To get time going, I built the models and made this small review for you to enjoy (or hate) High resolution pics can be found here when public. Set# 4994 Title: Fierce Creatures Price: 9.99 EURO / 12.99 USD Pieces: 193 Minifigs: 0 The Box: The box looks awesome! It has some great animations of the 3 models in the instruction. The rear of the box shows some nice up-close-and-personal drawings of each model. I think it works better having the models drawn instead of a mere photo of them. Somehow it allows the great colour-scheme to really show. The Instructions: The instruction is easy to follow and shows which pieces are used in each building step. That makes it all a lot easier, especially with so many small pieces as in this set. The bricks are divided into 3 polybags and the instruction is a fine small book, which can be easily stored along the rest of your ever-growing amount of booklets and pamphlets printed by TLG. The models: Model 1 is a spider and it’s nasty. The 2x2 modified brick with the hole would allow one to hang it from a string. This beast is sure to give you several nightmares, were it hanging from a string in your bedroom. – So I wouldn’t do that (plus the fact that my wife threw away the box and ordered me to take the spider apart when she saw it – She’s an arachnophobian and does not take spiders lightly). It looks real, in a brickish-non-real-way. Model 2 is a snake. There’s not much to say other than the head is awesomely designed and the rest is bad. The body is poorly designed and does not live up to the coolness of the head. Build the head, ignore the rest. Model 3 is a flying scorpion or something. Not as realistic as the spider, but still a great model with a cool head. The tail is a bit poorly designed, but it’ll do and it does offer some good ideas on how to use bricks. All in All Verdicts: This is an ok Creator set. It holds a lot of fine pieces and the models are an ok inspiration. Given its size, it’s an ok set. But it’s nothing more than that. I’ll give it an average score. I enjoyed building the models and fumbling with the bricks in the shade during a “siesta” on my vacation. And that’s what it is, an enjoyable build and a little inspiration on a hot day with a Erdinger Dunkel Weissbier in my other hand. KimT Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 06:29 PM. Indexed	positive
4500 Rebel Snow Speeder review Parts: 214 Figs: 3 Price: £20.00 EDIT: New box pics added sorry they're a bit blurry because of the light I took them in. This is the original trilogy edition version of this set but there aren't any differences to the normal one. 1. Manual & Box The front of the OTE box The minifgs on the box top. The back of the box with some alternate models and overview of some of the functions. The manual cover. You can see it is the OTE version of the set. Random shot. 1 of 2 posters in the instructions. The second poster. 2. General set and minifigs The built set contents. The three figs with the included weapons. How I like to customize the pilots helmets. Luke from 4500 and Luke from 10178 Motorized AT-AT. The three helmets included with the set. 3. Turret Here's the turret with the Rebel gunner standing next to it. The controls for the turret . The turret can rotate and tilt two fire at those pesky AT-AT walkers. I put a spider web sort of radar dish thing on like on the original 7130 to make it look more like the one from TESB. 4. The Speeder A front view of the speeder. The pilot controls with a AT-AT print. The seats for the pilot and rear gunner. The rear gunner's tow cable. A detailed printed plate next to the engines. Printed plates under the air-brake things. More printed parts, there is no DSS with this set. Got tie up those walkers. We might need some more tow cable . 5. Overall Build: 7/10 Pretty symmetrical build but it's fun. Minifigs: 8/10 3 figs in a £20 set is pretty good I think. Design: 9/10 Very strong and close to minifig scale. The turret could have some work though. Parts: 8/10 lot's of variety and includes some interesting ones such as the cockpit and rear air vent. Price: 7/10 3 figs and 214 parts not to bad I guess. Playability: 6/10 Could be better if it came with a Snow Trooper. Overall: 8/10 The set comes with 3 figs that only come with more expensive sets, also it has a variety of different parts as well as the build being enjoyable.

Thanks for the review. This is another good SW set. A true classic. I especially like the colourscheme of this set. The rebel gun is crappy though, but overall the set rocks. KimT	positive
I once bought a entire Lego collection including this set. However, I never have build it. Seeing this fine review has given me new motivation to do so. Nice work again Skipper!	positive
My review gave you motivation to build a set. My review was better than I thought.	positive
Skipper, thanks for doing up all these SW Reviews. It certainly had given me some valuable insights on these sets especially on the Snowspeeder. It kind of making me regret to pass off this set. However, I had bought the hoth base instead but had never built it. I am just wondering if the snowspeeder had any difference? Keep up the good work and always strive your best to make each upcoming review a better one.	positive
Great review! I bought this set when it came out but sold it a couple years later for some extra cash. I have no regrets selling this one, as I was never really impressed with it (different story for the 4483 AT-AT - oh how I wish I still had that one). The snowspeeder was alright, just didn't have any sort of "wow" factor to it. The best part of the set is probably the Rebel Trooper. Looking at the last photo in your review, looks like you're about to have a major battle in your hallway. Apart from the snowspeeder & motorized AT-AT, I see the ARC-170 Fighter, Grievous's starfighter, and is that a podracer I see -- and what is the set with the treads? It's not Star Wars, but looks like a pretty cool set (maybe a Mission Mars vehicle).	positive
Skipper 24, on Aug 4 2008, 12:52 PM, said: Podracer not sure where you got that from (I didn't have them out)? I noticed the minifig between the Grievous starfighter & the mod-Dino2010 vehicle and it looked like a little person sitting in the pod of his podracer. Guess my eyes are playing tricks on me -- my eyesight is shot & my wife keeps pushing me to go visit the optometrist.	neutral
Nope there is a guy sitting there. He's there because on Dine 2010 there were no guns like on Dino attack, so so I made a big gun like on the Dino attack set. I can see where you got the pod racer idea from now.	neutral

Thanks for the rewiev! A nice set indeed, to bad i din´t buy it when it still was in the stores.	positive
This is one of my favorite SW sets. It is a good size to the HOTH base and the AT_AT.	positive
I had this set (£15 RRP actually ;-)) and agree mostly with your review, although on the wheel bike itself two legs can be placed at the front end and two at the back to enable it to 'roll' properly. Boga is very juniorised, and the set itself is very simple and contains many large pieces. The minifigures are good though (I traded my GG however ). Just to offer my personal thoughts; Build: 5/10 Minifigs: 10/10 Parts: 3/10 Price: 7/10 Playability: 10/10 Overall 7/10 -- (not an average) TK	neutral
My brother had this set, and I think it isn't the best set, but great minifigs. Could use a Star Corps Clone or 2 from the BP.	neutral
7153 Jango Fett's Slave 1 Review Parts: 358 Figs: 2 Price: £20.00 (I got it on offer I think the RRP was £40) The only set to include Jango Fett and young Boba. Also the decals on Jango are from Fine Clonier. (I'm trying to say they don't came with the set) 1. Manual Worn manual. Random page. Another random page. Looking at this page you can that this set has numbered bags. Back cover. Look how old Yodas computer looks . 2. General set and Minifigs The sets contents. Jango With his hair on. Jango with helmet on with front view of face. Twist Jango's head to initiate super bounty hunter mode. Jango's doubled sided head. Boba. Nothing to special although I think the torso and head are exclusive to the set. 3. The Ship Not really scaled up right as you can see. The guns can rotate. The central sections interior. Not sure what this is. Is it a hyperdrive or a bomb or something? There are these side panels on both sides. Behind the panels. A secret compartment. Trans orange minifig heads in the compartment. I think they're supposed to be saturnic charges. Side storage compartment. The back of the ship. How those trans orange minifig heads fallout. There is a magnet on the inside of the ship. But for what... The secret prison which also has a magnet on the top so it can stay on but easily come out. The doors on it can lift up to put prisoners inside. 1 of 2 identical wing things. They can fold for flight mode. The controls. Bottom jet thing. LET ME OUT OF HERE! The prison is great for capturing small children. 4. Overall Build: 7/10 Impossible to build without a hard stable surface. Minifigs: 10/10 2 Exclusive figs. Design: 7/10 Nowhere near to scale but has some nice features. Parts: 8/10 Good parts like that big cockpit canopy. Price: 9/10 For the price I got it was pretty good especially with the figs it comes with. Playability: 7/10 Lots of features but it would be better if it came with a JSF. Overall: 9/10 Lots of features and comes with exclusive minifigs.

Thanks again Skipper for producing yet another review to go into the index. I like this Slave1, but sadly I must admit that I like the really old version better. Boba Fett's Slave1 that is, even though is grossly undersized I think it's better than this one belonging to his father Jango. KimT	neutral
I have all three of the Slave I ships, and I agree with KimT...although it is a very small, compact ship, the first Slave I (Boba Fett) is still the sturdiest. The newest Slave I (Boba Fett) is not bad, and is of much better construction than this Slave I from Jango Fett. Even though I like the size and scale of the Jango Slave I and the newest Boba Fett Slave I...when you pick that very first one up, it had the feeling of....."You can throw me against the wall, drop me off the roof of your house, or let 4 two year olds play with me...I'M NOT GONNA BREAK!" At least thats's my opinion. Good review	positive

I never got the original Boba fett's slave 1. I wish they would make one to scale with the minifigures. I would be so cool. I am also putting up a review of the Clone Turbo Tank probably tomorrow. It is a different variation to the one in the index. Edited by Skipper 24, 03 August 2008 - 07:12 PM.	neutral

Very good review! There's only one thing you did wrong: [quote name='Skipper 24' post='337180' date='Aug 3 2008, 08:46 AM']The controls. I got this set for a very low price as well, and for that, it's a very nice parts pack with 2 neat, exclusive figs!	neutral
Nice Review! I will say i like the latest Slave I the best as it is longer than Jango's. I haven't seen the first one so i cant really comment.	neutral
That was indeed a set that never appealed to me. Its build was just plain wrong and awful. I only bought it because I found it on clearance at around 15€ (and they had 4 of them. If I had known better then, I'd have bought all 4; Seeing how much that Jango Fett minifig is worth now... ) But I ended up heavily modifying it in its propoions and now it looks ok next to the new Slave One (which is the best one of its 3 incarnations, I think)	negative
I got the Original JSF for Christmas, which I might buy and review. Wonderful set, the Obi in this one is really awesome and it's really just a great ship, sticker free. Probably my favourite, I'd fly it if any ship from Star Wars. Maybe I should get it and the Slave I from Episode II... after all, I like Jango despite having a crap story.	positive
Very good review! I have he newest Slave I and I like it more than this one. DSR	neutral
I really want one of these, if only it wasn't expensive. I probably won't buy it because it'd be scraped for parts too quick. Great review though.	neutral
Good review. I always wanted to know how it was different to the Boba Fett Slave I. I would probably only get this though for Jango Fett. The newer one looks sturdier and proportioned better IMO.	neutral
A very nicely done review. I remember getting this Slave I - it was my first large Star Wars set.	positive
Outback Desert Racer G'day Mates! Today from the Legoland's Desert Down Under, I'll be sharing an image review of Outback Set #6550, Desert Racer Set #: 6550 Theme: Outback Year Released: 1997 Piece Count: 48 Minifigs: 1 List Price: $4 (USD) Starting with an image of the box: And the back side with three alternate models: Instructions and decals: The pieces: A side view of the vehicle: Diagonal view: One minifig: And the complete set: PROS: - Price is under $5 ($4 USD retail) - good impulse set - Goes well with other Outback sets - Combination of yellow and green pieces - Working doors and liftable top for playability CONS: - Stickers on doors, hood, and 1x4 tile. No printed pieces - No accessories (a wrench, gas can, and other extras would have added to the set) - No extra tire for blow outs SUMMARY: I picked this set up new a number of years ago as a true "Impulse Buy", after buying one of the larger Outback sets (Amazon Crossing or Outback Airstrip). It's a neat little addition to the theme with its working doors and playability factor. Although I only built it once before today, I would buy again if I had the opportunity. Hooroo for now! Some good Aussie music to leave you with: Down Under	positive
I remember having this set (actually i even still have it, at least the pars are SOMEwhere ) when i was a child, and i used it for making races, as it is there for. All these many reviews let me think again at that i also planned to make some reviews for the town section. I got your message TheBrickster, don't worry! I got a lot to do at the moment, but i should find some time this upcoming week.	neutral

7261 Clone Turbo Tank Parts: 801 Figs: 8 Price: £70.00 (ouch! ) EDIT: new box pics added. My version of the set comes with a normal Mace Windu figure and an extra clone trooper. Also the Mace Windu, BARC trooper and jet trooper minifigs were exclusive to the set (Well you could make the jet trooper yourself) . Also my set came with 4 extra blasters (you'll see them later) and Baby blue vent things instead of trans blue. 1.Manual & Box The front of the box. The box compared to the motorized AT-AT and the hailfire droid and dwarf spider droid. Minifgs. The back which has pics of the sets functions and alternate models. Inside the box it has a white cardboard divider probably for strength seeming as the box it so flimsy. Pretty hefty manual. The TT manual compared to the one of the AT-AT ones. Random shot. Another random shot. Poster at the back of the manual 2. General set and minifigs The whole set. I accidentally left one of the plates up when I took the pic. Close up of the figs. Two battle droids come with blasters and a mini turret. The republic. From L-R: Jet Trooper, Mace Windu (not LUL), BARC Trooper, Normal Clone, The Commander, Look out. Jet pack. Mace's torso. BARC trooper legs. BARC trooper torso. He has got to be my favorite clone trooper by TLC. The mysterious commander. On LSW he was called Cody (right) but he has star corps Armour making him commander Bly (left) . Normal Clone and the look out Clone with electro binoculars. 3. Speeder Bike Side view of the BARC Speeder. Menacingish front view. (is menasingish a word?) Printed back engine piece. One of my shield things came with a crumpled handle it is worse than it looks in the pic. 4. The turret The turret. It can rotate and point upwards. But what if you want to blast all those Battle droids that are shorter than the height of the turret blasters... add another hinge in! That extra hinge in action. 5. The Tank It's to big to get a decent side view pic Johnny the cabin boy on the crows nest. Front 2 seater cockpit. The 2 seats. Better be careful you don't fall off your seat there are some pretty big gaps down the sides. Back cockpit with dual missile launchers. The back seat. The engine. The large central storage. The turret controls fold down to lock into place so it doesn't fall out when driving. You can put 2 minifigs up top. Mace and a Clone driving. you can see those 4 extra blasters, 2 orange at the front of the pic and 2 between the chairs. The turret and jet trooper. BARC trooper on the BARC speeder. The commander on the lift chair in the back cockpit. Another shot of that chair. 6. Overall Build: 8/10 Quite enjoyable because it incorporates Technic and system parts. Minifigs: 9/10 On a set this size it has quite a lot including some exclusives such as the BARC trooper but it could of had a droid or 2 more. Design: 7/10 way out of scale but generally pretty strong due to the technic frame. Parts: 7/10 Lots of plates and nice minifig parts. Price: 6/10 Justifiable because of the amount of figs in the set. Playability: 7/10 Includes some CIS units to fight the clones. Overall:8/10 Needs more droids and it could be bigger. I will also probably have a break form reviewing for now seeming as I have just put out a whole load of reviews. Edited by KimT, 09 August 2008 - 08:51 PM. indexed as 7261 Review 2	positive
Thanks for the review, I'll index it later. I've added a poll, so that members can vote their opinion and refrain from useless comments like "awesome!!" (This has been done to all reviews in the SW review index). Keep up the good work. This is one of my favourite sets - I have both versions and as it is known, the only difference is the minifigs. I really like the tank, it has great playability and if it had wings, I'd definately swoosh it. KimT	neutral

Skipper 24, on Aug 4 2008, 04:04 PM, said: Did your version without the LUL mace have trans blue grill things (like the ones on the back of the speeder) ? Or was my set a one off. I bought mine online, thinking it was the new version but I ended up with that very lame LUL fig. I just hate that fig... It's completely useless, we can't use any part of it for anything (although, I only discovered yesterday that the lightsaber blade was a standard one and not glued, as I always believed, so all isn't completely lost) In the end I still was rather disappointed by the set. It's too full of holes ( Hum; I think there's kind of a paradox in that sentence...)... But the BARC Speeder and green clone are indeed fantastic. Oh, and yes, mine came with sand blue grill parts instead of the trans-yellow ones... didn't realise it at first, and I spent half an hour cursing, thinking they forgot to put them in the box. But in the end, I don't know if the replacements are any better , since they're supposed to represent some kind of thruster light or something... All in all, I think it's my worst set... Not necessarily for the set itself which is OK, but psychologically, there's too many things that went wrong with it...	neutral

Nice review AGAIN, Skipper. I passed on this one because of the price, but it's a nice set. Good for you for getting the newer version with non-LUL Mace and an extra clone. That purple blade sure is a beauty. The tank itself is alright, just an AT-AT on wheels, in my opinion. The turret is great, though, and so is the speeder bike. I didn't realize that the jet pack had two "nailguns" (harpoon guns) on it. I thought that the nailgun was a new piece... but the jetpack is very cool.	positive
The Kid, on Aug 4 2008, 08:20 AM, said: I got the original version of this set with the LULS Mace Windu figure. When TLC released the non-LULS version I managed to swap - they sent me the new version (and a Clone Trooper IIRC) and I mailed them back the old version. This was a great set; the suspension worked great and it rolled magnificently. Nice review with good photos, but again your price is a little off: £69.99 is the RRP (unless the price you paid was £80). TK That was a great idea. I never even thought to send it back and get the new one with the other clone and the non LUL Windu.	positive
I voted "above average" as well, but back in 1983, I would have probably gone much lower. Sadly, I wasn't as interested in minifigs at the time. I appreciated the ones I had, but I really just wanted ships or bases, and would have gladly passed this by for something with one or two figures and a small moon rover. I skipped all of the classic minifig sets, space, castle and town. It was only upon coming out of my dark ages that I went minifig crazy. For me, this is above average because of the accessories. Without them, it's an average set. With a small brick built droid or a rover, it would be outstanding. That said, I'd buy at least 10 copies now, though I'd rather have a 4 figure set with one of each colour including blue. I never had blue back then. I think Castle lured me away. Thanks for an interesting review! It gives me a chance to further explore why I changed from ship/set to minifig fan and bore all of EB with it.	neutral
An ancient set revived from KimT's collection! Just take a look at the box art. This is one classic space minifig pack which deserve high rating, and I gave it above average. I never had any of these classic space figs before. If TLG could ever released this again, I am pretty sure I will grab multiple packs without a glimpse. You need to build your space agents/astronauts with a little bit of accessories added to explore the unknown space. I love this pack very much. Thanks for sharing!	positive
I wonder why this set had no blue or black astronauts? Whatever the case, I always loved the small minifig sets that Lego released, as I could never get enough astronauts. My favorite was the set of Futuron astronauts. Why would the yellow astronauts freak you out, Sinner? Is it because they look nekkid? ;-)	neutral
Pretty nice set, but the newer minifig packs had greater variety in both the figures and equipment. My favorite one among all of them is 6704, which is also the only instance of both Blacktrons appearing in one set. Quote I wonder why this set had no blue or black astronauts?

7674 V-19 Torrent Number of Pieces: 471 Number of Minifigs: 1 Price: £49.99 The V-19 Torrent starfighter was an assault fighter with exceptional speed and maneuverability used by the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars.It was a predecessor of the Alpha-3 Nimbus-class V-wing starfighter, in terms of purpose and usage. It first appeared in the Genndy Tartakovsky?€™s Clone wars 2D series. Basics Box front: The box art shows the torrent flying above Tatooine, with the new blue and white ?€œclone wars?€? style packaging, Box back: The back shows some of the features of the set including the lifting mechanism and adverts for 7679 Republic Gunship, 7675 AT-TE and the 7673 MagnaGuard starfighter Inside the box, there are 2 instruction books, a very small DSS and 9 bags that are not numbered. Bags: Instruction books Random manual shot Parts list Book one is mainly the construction of the body and one of the engines, Book 2 is the other engine and the wings. For better pics of the manual look on lego's website. Sticker sheet: A very small sticker sheet is included, which includes 2 republic insignias and a nose sticker. Minifigure One minifigure is included, a clone pilot. The whole "OMG only one minifigure in this set" and "Its not movie accurate, i hate you TLC!!!11one2" has been beaten to death, so please don't make this review turn into that and to be honest i don't care because its an awesome figure. TLC have made the effort to print the life support device onto the chest plate so props to them. He has the "clone head" like the rest of the clones have in the CW releases, there are no extra clone bits apart from a long blaster, that's not included here. Interesting/other pieces Printed piece! Rare/unusual pieces: there are 2 pistons included, as well as 2 weird looking technic pieces that serve as the landing gear during the build. which might explain why the set is quite expensive, it musn't have been cheap to manufacture them. The build It starts off relatively simple, the first 16 steps is getting the basic shape of the cockpit and the mechanism to make the middle wing move up and down. After that the next few steps are getting the landing gear/wing folding device done, it's actually the same thing so when the wings move into attack mode the landing gear retracts. This is then locked into place by the white beams that form the basic shape of the fuselage. Up to step 46 is the fuselage, as well as fitting the hydraulics. This is what it looks like when the fuselage is complete. The cockpit is not "air tight", there's is quite a big gap Top: Bottom: The final few steps of book 1 is the construction of one of the engines, here it is attatched : The yellow bar is not permanent, its used to keep the white bit at the top from moving downwards. The steps are repeated in the second book so that both engines are now in On to the wings! First one attatched, The middle one is attached now: and finally the last one: It is now finished! The pieces that are left: So, you're probably wondering, how does it enter attack mode? well can you see this bar? push that bar to the center, and pick it up, the hydraulics move the central wing downwards as well as the side wings to enter attack mode: The outer wings have flickfire missiles on them, they obviously don't work, but it increases the playability of the set. The cockpit opens in a similar way to General Grevious's starfighter released last year, using a sliding mechanism For other pics see here : http://s25.photobuck...eview/?start=20 and i'll be taking other requests for pics, maybe a video of it switching between modes. Build: 7/10 very symmetrical build, the mechanism to move the wings might annoy some people. Minifigs: 5/10 1 fig in a £50 set, however it is a starfighter Design: 9/10 very accurate to the source material, Lego have really made the effort to make the movement feature work. Parts: 8/10 lots of technic, white and dark red pieces Price: 7/10 could be slightly cheaper, Playability: 6.5/10 need to buy some enemy sets to get the most of it, flick fires don't work. comments, requests, questions and criticisms welcome.

Thanks for the review, simonjedi. This just re-affirms that the V-19 is my highest priority this fall. Behind the RGS, of course. Is that new printed piece a 2 x 2 Tile? It looks like an excellent detail part for MOCing. Those black pieces used on the landing gear look very Bionicle-like. If they haven't been used before, I'd suspect they will be. Not that I'm a Bionicle expert or anything. It is a shame that this set only includes one clone. That seems to be the only drawback to the set. Everything else looks spot on.	positive
First, thanks simonjedi for a great review. I'm interested in what you think of the hydrolics. I could spend hours just deploying and undeploying the wings and landing gear. I'm a little worried, the very first batch of the hydrolic piece for, umm, I think it was the off-road 4x4 Technic set, was very fragile and broke after a few uses. These seem to be holding up but I'm anxious to see if they hold up after 100-200 uses. quote name='Walter Kovacs' date='Aug 4 2008, 11:47 AM' post='337841'] Those black pieces used on the landing gear look very Bionicle-like. If they haven't been used before, I'd suspect they will be. Not that I'm a Bionicle expert or anything. [/quote] Right you are. They are Bionicle Bohrok head pieces. So pretty old in Bionicle terms and fairly useless in my opinion but they do make interesting looking landing gear as I deploy and redeploy the wings and landing gear. Hopefully, we'll get a pilot in the battle pack to help mitigate the fact we only get one here. -Tohst	positive
The printed part isn't new it came with 10178 motorized AT-AT walker. Also nice review, I would get the set if it was a little cheaper or came with more than 1 fig. Whyhas it got 2 instruction books the set isn't particularly big?	neutral
Thanks for the review. I've added it to the index and added a poll in which members can vote their opinion on this set. I think this is a very good set. I like the colours and the very playable feature that allows the wings to lock in attack formation. Now all I need is to buy this baby. Edit: I gave it an Above Average rating, since it's well designed, looks sturdy and fits the SW theme sets perfectly.	positive
Great review simonjedi -- I really like that you included lots of photos of your build. I put together my V19 Torrent last night, and I was surprised by how heavy the completed ship is. It has some real heft. Once it's finished, WOW! it is a really cool ship. I was disappointed that the central wing doesn't really lock into place once it flips down. It just kind of droops there, so I attached a technic pin to the locking arm so it could plug into the 2x4 brick that's on the underside of the starfighter (this brick can be seen in your photo of the bottom of the ship). Overall, the build is one of the more confusing that I've seen (I had to dismantle and re-build the first engine after I realized I'd left out a piece) and I kept thinking of the poor 7-year-old that gets this set as his/her very first LEGO set ever.	negative
The V-19 was my first TCW set. I buyed it, when i was visiting my father. I just wanted to build it there, and I do so. But how do you will get sth.big like this with in the train?? So I had to destroy him. When I was still home again, I had to build it 3 times, because the mechanic dont works I only can say that the V-19 is one of the best TCW Sets. Thanks to you for the review simonjedi , I just wanted to make one in German. But now I needn`t to make it	positive
pedro, on Aug 5 2008, 12:29 PM, said: It looks pretty big compared to other starfighters too. Did it take a long time to build? It took me 3 and a bit hours to build it, although i had some problems with the technic and i had to take pictures during the build.	neutral

Hydraulic wings! I am very impressed and am now considering getting this set purely because of this funciton. I am just curious as to know why are there sand green parts on the bottom of the V-19.

I love this set and I gave it "Outstanding". I might note though that the cylinder is just there as a dampener; when disenegaged the wing function still works, just not as smoothly. Interestingly though the cylinder is an old piece, (I have a few others) it's just that this is the first time it's been used without a spring... I had no problems assembling this set.	positive

Oh Ruben you lucky so and so this set is one of the most beautful i have ever seen!

I thought you meant the monorail set when you told me about this but guess i was wrong (don't laugh i've been away from lego for quite some time) and for 80 euros it was a real bargain from a great friend! Really nice review hope this sets brings you years of joy!	positive
It's great to see someone reviewing a TRAIN! This set is definately a FIVE! Lego hasn't made a complete train SET like this in a long time. The Metroliner is really a legend among classic trains. The great level of playability and detailing makes it a terrific model. Specifically, I was just noticing the details of the passenger car. It has a sink! - How cool is that? And 11 minifigs - when was the last time Lego included 11 figs in a single set? A truly outstanding train set. Thanks for sharing images as I've always wanted to see it up-close. It would be awesome if you could share some single side shots of the cars.	positive
I'm not normally that big into trains but this set has a real coolness factor that sets it apart from most of the others. The color scheme is the same one that Amtrak and many local subway systems use. I picked it up along with the club car expansion when they were re-released in 2001. I have made various modifications to mine, rearranging the car layouts and adding a second train motor into the rearmost car along with another set of lights, so that both ends light up. As you said, it would be great to have an 8-stud version of this, so you could fit in two rows of seats side by side. That might make a nice mod project at some point.	positive
Outstanding train set. The LEGEND of the entire train series, is the Metroliner. This is a "Super 5" set. The color, design, minifigs is just so perfect and lovely. It resemble the trains which we see on our rails in our daily life. I can't find any flaws on this at all. The only flaw I noticed is my mistake of not able to buy this set at all. In fact, I had never seen this set in the shops before in my entire life. TheBrickster, on Aug 5 2008, 09:23 AM, said: How cool is that?

Ahh, the good old train theme. How i wish TLG would make such great trains today, now that the quality of city sets has improved so much. That really brings back memories, even if i didn't have this one, but a cargo train that came out about the same time period, maybe plus a few years. I don't have any trains myself at the moment, mostly because i'm afraid i haven't got enough space to put in on display with all the rails and stuff.	positive
Really Nice Train, I always wished TLG would have made the passenger IR train longer and maybe used some of the nice features of this train, I still love that faucet piece.	positive
This is a great review of a great set, Hairy Ruben! I voted for Outstanding since the only thing you can say about this train set is that it is outstanding. It has been the best passenger train in all the time from Lego's beginning on until now. I bought the rereleased version of it in 2003 - and I really, really do not regret it! Klaus-Dieter	positive
I also voted "Outstanding", for the simple reason that I've owned this set for a long time, but for most of the time it's been an anonymous heap of bricks mixed with all the other bricks I have. So about a year ago I started rebuilding it, and it now sits proudly next to (also rebuilt) 2150 on my shelf. IMO; It's an excellent set, best of the 9V passenger trains, no doubt. And it combines the best of the 80's trains with that of the 90's - it's not some futuristic panorama-glassed low-slung train, but an honest, realistic-looking train that captures many of the features that passenger trains used to (and in some cases; still) have.	positive
Hairy Ruben, on Aug 5 2008, 12:00 AM, said: The interior of the two however is laid out a bit differently. The space in the front carriage is occupied by a cockpit (or whatever it is called in trains) and some space to store your cable connecting the front lights with the engine. I can imagine it must get quite cramped and dangerous for the minifig driver with all the cabling. Further back we have a quite random, weird looking engine. One part reminded me rather of a jet engine on a commercial airplane. The engine is accessible by means of the two side cargo doors. At the end of our first carriage we hit what looks like the train's restaurant, two tables and no chairs. There shouldn't be so much of the light cable in the front section or "cockpit." Most of the cable should be in the central part of the train. Then it is not so crowded for the engine driver. I have never had a problem with the cable and the space available for it. The only problem I had was that the cable had a loose contact after some time. When the train went into a curve (can't remember if it was a left or right curve) the light went off. I have now got the same problem with the cable that I put into my Santa Fe Super Chief. Always when the engine turns into a right curve, the light goes off. My dad could repair the cable for the metroliner. Even though he is quite skilled at repairing electronic things, he found it very difficult to repair since there were no screws to open the electronic plate. It annoyed him a lot. So I've been asking myself if I should really bother him with a second cable with the same problem. The train set itself is outstanding (and that's what I voted for). I only have the legend 10001, but it's 99% identical to 4558. I also have club car 4547. I don't have the legend club car 10002. The reason for this is I always had the choice between one big LEGO set or several small ones for Christmas when I was a child. I always went for several small ones. Metroliner 4558 would have been a big train set, but I really wanted a passenger car. So I bought 4547 with my savings without having the metroliner. I was quite happy when the metroliner was re-released. I bought it with my own money. Then I could finally use the club car with the train it was created for.

Panda9001100, on Aug 16 2008, 07:37 AM, said: Only strange they named it metroliner. In Holland when we speak of a metro, I need to think at short distance trains only used in big cities like Rotterdam. It was only named Metroliner in the US, because of the color scheme is similar to the real-life Metroliner. I believe in EU it was called the Euro-Express, and probably just "passenger train" wherever that would be suitable. The product-number 4558 is universal, though. Hairy Ruben, you don't have a review of the double-decker/club car on the way, do you? I myself never got it, and I am seriously considering buying one from Bricklink, plus it is more-or-less an requirement for this train (one of very few double-decker cars to actually stay within the general outer dimensions of the train).	neutral

I got one for christmas when it was rereleased in 2003 and another one in a charity shop a few months later for €5. I love the minifigs even if they all have smileys, and having two sets of them can really fill up a town. 5euro! wow I didn't know charity shops sold Lego. I'm in Dublin, is the shop near me?

I got my Indy exclusive in the mail today. Packaging Front: Back: Instructions: Mini-figs This set comes with 1 mini-fig, the standard Indy with hat and whip-no satchel: The build I am really happy with the amount of frown headlight bricks that come with this set. 12 in all: The mudguards are cleverly built with 1 x 2 panels and 1 x 1 panel corners in dark green. In the first 2 pages of the instructions, there are a lot of great pieces. This set would sell like mad if it were released for sale. Parts monkeys alone would go insane buying these up for the dark green and frown pieces: The body of the car consists of black plates, brackets and modified bricks with curved tops that allow the dark green mudguards to just peak out. Cool technique: The grill looks cool using only six pieces. I wish all small sets were this unique and cool: Here's the completed jeep. It looks a little small for an actual jeep, but for a brickmaster set, it's awesome, IMO: Some more detail shots of the set with Indy in the driver's seat: I hope they take BrickMaster exclusives overseas because it'd be awesome if everybody could get these. My buddy CopMike would probably love to be the first to review this set, so I've dedicated my review comic to him: My rating Playability: 8/10 (You need to add some other sets and characters to really play with this set) Design: 9/10 (Great techniques and inclusion of rare parts, but loses a point for being an unrealistic size for a jeep) Price: 10/10 (Part of the BrickMaster package, it is a reasonable prize for an exclusive set and everything else that comes with the subscription) Overall: 9/10 (Great, but not perfect and definitely needs to be offered overseas. LEGO would make a ton of money releasing this for sale, IMO as it really is a terrific small set.)	positive
Thanks for the review Hinckley! I love this set! I still haven't renewed my BM subscription, but i'm sure I can find this on ebay or bricklink. And what an addition this would be to my army. Edited by ~VBBN~, 05 August 2008 - 01:32 AM.	positive
Nice review Hinckley. I just got mine as well by paying quite a high price for it since its exclusive to US. However, I had not opened it yet and I left it in my friend's car. I gave it for an above average for that cool little jeep. For an exclusive BrickMaster set, this is certainly one of the best vehicles I had ever seen. I like its construction built. If this is ever released in the main stream, I am sure it will be a hit to get a small sized Indiana Jones set.	positive
Outstanding set and review, thanks for presenting it! I've had this since it first came out, but didn't think it would be that impressive, so I didn't bother opening it. Now, I'm tempted. Aside from the slight size issue, I can't find anything here to gripe about, except for the limited availability. I want 5. I think that makes me a parts monkey. Eek eek. You're exactly right about this selling like mad. It's another one of those missed opportunities for TLG. Sure, it's nice to get people to subscribe by offering it as part of BrickMaster, but in the long run, put it in the stores for $6 and sell a million. Just give us Indy's manbag, we need it for postal employees and such. As is the running joke whenever I comment on one of your reviews, I'd give this a solid 985. Not out of anything, just 985. Or, in clearer terms: + 1/2 (though I voted 5)	positive
Nice review! I would like to get this set... unfortunately I don't get Brickmaster mag, and the prices on BL/ ebay will most likely be ridiculous. I wonder why Indy doesn't come with his murse (man purse) in this set? Thats the best part of the fig. The jeep itself is very nice, especially with the dark green. By the way, what is frown? Brownish... something, I guess. Oh yeah, and funny comic.	positive

I really enjoyed getting this set in the mail. Its such a great small set and a good example of how smaller vehicles can have great details on them too. The only drawback is that I didn't get another satchel for my various uses for them.	positive
Thanks for the cool review, Hinckley. When I saw the picture originally I thought it looked good, but not that good. But seeing the pictures in your review, I love this, I voted it as outstanding because it has great parts, and a brilliant construction, ingenious perhaps!

6804 Surface Rover Review Set#: 6804 Set Name: Surface Rover Released: 1984 Pieces: 16 Minifigs: 1 (white classic space minifig) Brickshelf Gallery Peeron.com Bricklink Brickset.com Introcomment: I have to keep my fondness for space going and since I'm no fan of the still "new" Life On Mars Mars Mission theme, I've decided to give you another review of a small Classic Space set. More to come in the following days. The Box. Unfortunately I haven't got the box for this set. But peeron.com was kindly enough to support me with a proper pic. And as usual this is a small easily brought home sized box. Oddly TLG doesn't add the "flip" on top anymore. I remember standing in toystores, pulling 6 or more sets down from the hanger before accesing the one I wanted. It gave buying LEGO sets that threasure hunting touch. [snaps out of his daydreaming]... A small box with a picture of what you get. I've got no rear pic, so I can't tell if TLG did the same as on the 6701 set (split up the inventory). The fig: One single white classic space minifig. This is the worst one in my opinion. I never liked those white guys. And they get easily damaged by the sun. Nah! Give me a red or yellow instead (later blue or black). The Surface Rover: BOTH I am the lucky owner of two of them. (Yes this is a small showoff ) SIDE Though small, I still think this is a neat little set. Compared to the modern "impulse" sets, this is high competable. I like the simplicity of the small classic space sets and this is no exception. The SR is made from very usable bricks, that can easily be used for making ship/base/craft MOCs. REAR As you can see, one of them has been used for surface exploration for many years. It could do with some replacements, but I haven't had the time, yet. The verdict: A fine little classic set. Not much more than that. It holds some useful bricks and worked fine as an "impulse" back then. The classic children's birthday presents during the early 80's. I got quite a few space and town sets back then. Remember to vote your opinion on this set. I gave it "average" for the bricks, the price (back then) and as an all in all conclusion. KimT	positive
This set easily is above average for me. I had this as a little child, and whenever any of my relatives came to visit us, they brought me some Lego. Usually it was either this set or 6844 The really nice thing about this set are the alternate builds. For the low price you got a nice range of parts and cool ideas what to build with them. You could build a fleet of Rovers, or the alternates, and everytime it was huge fun :)	positive
I voted Average. It's a cute set, and one which I built from parts many times as a kid. (I didn't own the set though.) Thanks for the review!	neutral
Outback Amazon Crossing G'day Mates! Another fine review from the Legoland's Desert Down Under. This set makes for an excellent addition to your jungles, deserts, outbacks, or other wild and untamed places. Set #: 6490 Theme: Outback Year Released: 1997 Piece Count: 117 Minifigs: 1 List Price: $15 (USD) Starting with an image of the box, one can conclude that this doesn't look like the Amazon at all, but rather the Outback: On the back of the box are some great alternate models, including a creative idea for a crocodile zoo scene: The instructions have the same images on the front and back: The set comes with one Outback fig, a man dressed in green with a bright red cap - I call him the Crocodile Hunter. Also included in this set is a crocodile, some bones, a skull, backpack, pan, and a few extra trans. round 1x1s. The tools are pictured on the truck: Now here's a great desert/rugged terrain truck: Ready for some 4-wheel'n fun. I love the liftable top window/sun roof and the windshield. I like the use of these colored trans. blue pieces that contrast against the yellow, rather than hide like regular clear pieces: The truck has a few hooks/clips to attach a pick, rifle, antena, and camera. Also attached is a water/oil can and an extra tire that just rests in the back section: The front end of the truck has a great winch and hook to help the truck out of hard places: Working suspension helps the vehicle travel on rough terrain: The truck is just half the fun. This set also offers a nice bridge/creek bed for the truck to drive across: I like the use of six fence/ladder pieces for the bridge. The two in the center have double open sides. Here's the left side: And the right side with a single burp as a mountain/hill: I really like the use of the tan and brown baseplates representing desert and water. The complete set as the Crocodile Hunter tries to climb back into the truck after attaching the winch: Final Thoughts: I've always liked this little set. It offers a great amount of playability with the wonderful little 4-stud wide truck and bridge scene. A few years ago, Playmobil offered a Desert Racing Theme and had this set as my favorite of the collection: Desert racing and adventures through dry creeks and rough terrain make for a great theme. Hope you enjoy this review and consider picking up an Outback set (or two) if you can still buy at a reasonable price. Happy Outbacking!

Thanks for this review, if you'd only know what memories you brought back! I think i remember this set better than any other i had, when i was a child. Some time after i got it, i decided to disassemble it and combine it with the jeep from 6552 Rocky River Retreat. It came out pretty good, though. As it became the main attraction point of my town (beeing the car of my favourite minifig back then, and, and, and... looong story ), i kept it assembled that way from this day on until earlier this year, when i finally disassembled it because i needed the parts. Edited by metalandi, 06 August 2008 - 03:57 AM.	positive
A nice set to go with the outback theme. I am kind of dissapointed they they didint continue the theme, as I only managed to grab 6487 and 6550, none the less, this set is very interesting as it's one of the few to feature working suspention. Stauder.	positive
Great review Brickster Why exactly did the outback, Adventure etc. themes never quite catch on......Just a thought. What a great set! I wish I had it, But in 1997 I was just back from my whirl wind trips around the world and had drifted away from Lego I don't know why. But I will say this I love the actual suspension that came with this set and the trains sets I have been trying to buy up as much of it as I can, And now I see I need to add one more set to the "I need to get that"	positive

Great story. I enjoy hearing people reminisce about the fun they had with certain sets. I always wanted Rocky River Retreat but never picked it up. That's a great adventure set as well. I had never thought about mixing the two sets, but they do have components that would compliment one another nicely. If you still have the pieces, you should try restoring the sets - it's a lot of fun. simonwillems, on Aug 6 2008, 04:37 AM, said: This is by far my favourite Outback series set! I loved the fact that you can bend the bridge in different directions so that the suspension of the car really worked to keep the car levelled, like you placed it in your last picture. I had lots of fun with this when it came out eleven years ago in 1997, the bridge scene could also be used in the Adventurers serie of 1998. I think I may like the Outback Airstrip a little better, but it's close. I agree with you about the bridge. The moving pieces are a nice feature, and makes it harder for the jeep to cross. The bridge does make a nice addition to Adventurers. I added it to my Jungle Adventure Diorama a few months ago: Stauder, on Aug 6 2008, 05:27 AM, said: I am kind of dissapointed they they didint continue the theme, as I only managed to grab 6487 and 6550 At leat you were able to pick up two of the sets.

Stauder, on Aug 7 2008, 06:17 AM, said: The great thing about the copter was it had 2 suitcases, which as far as I can tell ain't a common part, not rare, but still nice to have. And it had the guy with the green jacket. The winch wasn't bad either, the only flaw was it was a "standard" lego copter, meaning similar ones where avalible in quite a few sets. Do you plan to review it? Oh, I wish I had it. I don't recall seeing 6487 in the stores back when I purchased the other Outback sets. I'd love to see a review.	positive
nice review. This set looked very nice for it's time.	positive
Oh I loved this set when I was young! I think I got it for my birthday, and it was one of my favourite sets at the time. Funnily enough, I was thinking about it the other day, and how I really should build it again... Thanks for the nostalgic review.	positive
Ok, this is the big one. The controversial one. The one everyone either hates or defends... What do I think? Read on. The Figs: Bandana Man Masked Dude Dude with Shades Good figures, I miss Scarface. Comes with his torso, though, which is my favorite (the one with the ammo strap across the chest). One figure short of the figure-to-price value, but we can deal with that. The Dino: The Dino. It's the one that comes with the chopper, in green. Any questions? The Tank: And so it begins. I think it looks a lot better in person than on the box. The left side. Good time to mention that the treads run pretty easily, and this is a very playable set. Right side. Keep an eye on that flap in the center... ... and we have a folding ladder! The back. Probably the weakest point of the set, apart from the dino. The turret, turned and tilted. The mechanism works extremely well, and the gun seems to work better than others for some reason (or maybe it just seems that way). The front of the cockpit. I'm at a loss trying to figure out how those TINY windshields defend them against 40-foot mutant tyrannosaurus rexes with radioactive breath, laser eyes, and what have you... Anyway, another one of those neat steering wheels, some Viking horns, and some stickered control panels (oh yeah, this set has a good amount of stickers. Probably around 20-ish.). The back of the cockpit. I love the little gun, it turns 360 degrees and tilts up. Oh yeah, and those green barrels they've been using are awesome, I can think of tons of uses for them. The Verdict: 7.6/10 Playability: 9.4/10 Pieces: 7.5/10 Figures: 8.8/10 Dino: 3/10 Value: 4/10 The MAIN DOWNFALL of this set is the price. I would easily pay $30 for this, no questions asked. But $40 was a hard sell for me - I gave in merely to see what I would think of it, and also to help you guys find out the same. This is a great display set, and a great play set. The pieces are good - lots of nice blay beams used in the construction. But the price, people. That's the killer. Pick this up only if you have everything else or you find it on clearance. And thus ends my Dino Attack review series. Hope you enjoyed them! Until next time, Bloody Jay	neutral
Very interesting indeed! I especially like the folding ladder. I never thought of making such a clever function. I might have to use it in my future LEGO models. Another great reveiw Bloody Jay! ;)	positive
Tks for the review once more Jay ;) I totally agree with you Jay !!! This set has very nice details suche as the mini gun, movable ladder, green barrels and great figs !!!! However, it is very expensive for what it is and I don't think there are that many very usefall parts in there !!!! (well, I could use those treads !!!). If I ever buy this set, its really not for the design, which I totally dislike...	positive
Thanks for the reviews once again. It looks like qite a nice set to me, although the European version will lose the big gun. I like some of the stickers (although I wish they were printed), and I actually quite like the dinosaur. I probably won't get it though, the set I'm most likely to get is the Fire Hammer.	positive

This is my first review, so I thought: the smaller (the set), the better! 6626 Snowmobile Year: 2000 Subtheme: Arctic Pieces: 20 (+1 extra) Note: Polybag; 6577 is the boxed version Price: €.1 + S/H on eBay MISP (Mint in Sealed Polybag!) Building time: less than 2 minutes. If it came out in the last months, if would be called an Impulse set. It actually came out a few years ago; being those my "dark years", I missed the Arctic line. Now that I'm back into business, I wanted some! But not all of the sets were good (or easily available). I had the chance to buy this one, and I0'm happy with it. As you can see below, it consists of a figure on a scooter; the only accessories are those chainsaws that lie on the sides (unless you take the skis from the scooter and have the minifig wear them!). The extra piece is a TransYellow 1x1 round plate. According to Brickset and Peeron, the difference between box and polybag is the sticker "sheet". You choose whether the nose is better with or without the sticker: I'd say "with". The judgement: it's cheap, it has a cool minifig with a cool head accessory and a nice torso. I don't think I like that orange colour that much (and I can't understand why those blue pieces have to be... blue; I guess it's beacuse the whole line uses blue with orange!), but I have to say this is definetely a good set. I'd give it a 4 out of 5 in its category. If you want to own at least a set per every theme, this could be your Arctic one.

Nice review Cobra. Thanks for sharing. I think Arctic was one of those neat themes that never really took off. I like these little poly-bag sets as they make great starters/introduction sets for themes (or) serve as a nice supplement or add/on to an existing collection. I've always liked the thick green hood piece used in the Arctic theme and have thought about using it in a SW Hoth scene. In any case, nice review! I've got an Arctic set that I built recently and will share a review soon.	positive
Here we are, my first Clone Wars set, and my first Star Wars review. Here we have the wonderful Droid gunship, one of the cheaper of the Clone Wars sets. This set is exclusive to Wal-mart, and its one of the better Exclusives out there (I'm looking at you, Twilight ). First off we have a Shot of the entire set with the Box. A random Page shot, along with pics of the Parts list. The build is split up into three sections: The Back, The cockpit, and The Missles. The back has a lot of nice dark blue plates, and is the only part of the set which uses stickers. The bottoms shows Various technic systems, which I'll get to later The cockpit has many details (Mostly guns), and the Rotating Guns are a nice touch. The cockpit can fit a battle droid, but not a Minifig. I'm not sure why a Droid would want leather though The last part is loading this baby with the missles There are four Black(small) and two Dark Bley (large) missles which are loaded in groups of three as SLS. the middle mechanism is for the missiles, and the back part with the Bionicle teeth are used ad landing gear The knob on top turns... to release the missiles on the Clones ... Leftover bits and the used SS(not so D this time around) The gunship versus a time traveling Agent Charge . OVERALL Build: 8/10 A basic build, but at some points repetitive. Minifigs: 10/10 Just your basic droids, you can't go wrong. Design: 7/10 A basic design, with some Interesting techniques. Pieces: 9/10 A mix of old and new pieces, along with the return of THIS lovely piece which hasn't been seen for almost 10 years Price: 8/10 $30 for a Gunship? I'll take it! Final Verdict: 8/10 A great price for a small set like this, and It has a great bit of Swooshability	positive

I got this yesterday on sale (only 5500 yen>>>$60 American) and was a little disappointed. I'd avoided it, but all the new sets are at least a month away here. It looks a little weird in photo, and the actual build is worse, just a flat little disc with a cockpit. Only special points for the color, which will probably just look better with those 2009 sets.	negative

I am a proud owner of this set. Like others, I got it discounted and couldn't resit the parts pack. This is the type of lego sets that bothers me. When you look at it now, you'd be tempted to say "hey not bad", but at the same time, some years ago, it wasn't good enough to buy it full price. I was kinda disappointed because usually sets using that kinda baseplates are excellent (castle, paradisa), and this one is just "ok". One really minus point would be the lack of any opponent faction in the set	negative
That's IT! Thanks for the review but now you make me want to build my own one! THANKS A LOT! ON a more serious note, I really like this set and have always wished to aquire it. I have two broken Tie Interceptors, so this should be a easy build. And as someone in the pirate forum, I think, said, It would be a great baseplate for building cave to hide the booty! Thanks PMG and welcome!	positive
Thanks for the welcome everyone! Though I'm still wondering where the Drone Minion/Commander idea came from.	neutral
Thanks for the review PMJ . I like the play value in this set even if I don´t own it . The way the orbs are put into the rocket is awesome and I really like it, but at the end the set have some lack of detail .	neutral
Another outstanding review by the "awesome set reviewer"! I enjoyed reading this review very much and I felt that you have redress Twilight in an approriate manner. I have very mixed feeling about this set especially with its design. It seemed I will need to watch the Clone Wars movie in the theatre before I compared with it. Most of the time, when this LEGO set is used in a movie, you will tend to compare it and what is the actual purpose for Twilight, same as the rest of the SW vehicles and aircraft. For a high price like this, I can actually top up a little more and get the AT-TE, with the same batch of minifigs plus Commander Rex. If there is a special figure such as the V19 Torrent (Clone Pliot), it will be a much ideal scenario. At the moment, I have not bring in any Clone War sets into my collection, and I am quite sure Twilight is not in my priority list especially when I am not a full-pledged Star War collectors or I have strong intentions to complete the entire range in this recent release. Therefore, I need to prioritise my purchase, and likely to get two RGS, since that is my favourite ship in Clone War era. I am not comparing it with RGS. Both sets defintely have their pros and cons. Oh, I love that postcard you made. Certainly looks very nice! svelte_corps, thanks for doing up this superb detailed review which had given "Twilight" the neccessary attention it should have.	neutral
Really awesome review svelte_corps . You did a really complete and in-depth review of this beast and with your nice pics is really enjoyable reading your review, so congrats . I like this ship even if it looks so bulky but I need to buy first other sets, so maybe this beast will be landing in my collection the next year (Or this one if I am lucky ). I can just ask for something, can you post a pic of all your clone wars sets together with this one (all the sets in one pic, not many pics with this an each set ) please .

Thanks for the review. Now I thinnk I will buy this set. BTW, I really like what you did to the back. I might do the same to mine....	positive
Wow certainly much bigger than I would have thought, thanks for the great review and pictures =] Well for some reason i was drawn to this set, but with the lack of interior and quite a bit of technics, i think I'll pass, or at least get the At-te first! Thanks again!	neutral
I read the Visual Guide recently and learned a bit more about the Twilight. I won't get into spoilers but it seems that the ship becomes a sort of endearing family van for the characters which is neat. Big bulky, uncool, but it gets you from one place to another. If it factors into more than just the 90 minute film, I may pick this up. It seems that there's room for a lot of personality in this ship once you see the film. It is a Corellian freighter smuggling spice for the Hutts. That's cool right?	neutral

Oh no! Anakin has gone over to the green side of the force! Well, I guess someone had to review the Clunkadunk eventually. And you did a good job at it, svelte corps! I liked the punchline with the Ahsoka-hairpiece swapping. The "Ugha warrior upgrade" is an interesting way of creating male Togrutas. And Ahsoka looks even hotter with Inferno's hair!

Thanks a lot for a very nice and entertaining review! Your photos were really nice and there have been some reviews lately that have such blurry pics... cough.. cough... it was a pleasure to see you can 1. put lego bricks together 2. write a review 3. handle your camera! I think this ship is underrated, it is really nice! I love the playing features like landing gear and back door, perhaps just cause I had to get along with so called landing gears in the past, that did not work at all (7140 for example..). And I simply LOVE that there is space inside. You said there is not really some cause of the landing gear mechanism, but it seems it should be easily fixed. Do you think there is enough space to put some plates over the landing gear and add some beds, kitchen und TV? I think this set is so perfect to mod it into a Clone Wars mobile home, your back garden ist just perfect for this. I prefer this over the AT-TE and over a 2nd gunship! Thanks a lot for the review!	positive

There is room inside with technic beams to lay plates etc on, the only issue is that it's kind of fiddly to access. You could do it from either the side door or rear door though, maybe move that tow line at the back. I have to say, it is a set that grows on you	positive
Thank you svelte_corps for the review! I like the inside, nice and cosey! I also like your little garden! For me, this put the twilight different in a better perspective than my first perspective of the twilight. I voted outstanding. Greets The-Force!	neutral
I will not be picking this one up. The main thing is that it simply looks akward. It is big and bulky, and seems to have random pieces on it with not reall streamline feel to it. I also agree that for an exclusive that it $100, it needs more than just 3.5 mini figures. Anikan and Ashoka and Rotta already come in the AT-TE, which is cheaper and has more figures. R2-D2 is a figure that I am sure everybody has at least 4 or 5 of. For that kind of money, I expect something with at least one unique figure, and more than 4. I also want just a cleaner and better designed set. This is probably the letdown of the collection so far. Every collection needs one.	negative

Thanks for yet another awesome review. Quote Seems like TLC has done a pretty accurate representation of the ship. The real fault for the ship's messy design has to go to Lucasfilm, not TLC. My guess is Lucasfilm is trying to recapture that "what a piece of junk!" magic of the Millennium Falcon. I guess we'll have to wait to see the movie to see if they succeeded or not. This sums up my opinion exactly. I can easily admit that the design of the kit is spot on - but unfortunately, the actual design of the ship in the new movie is garbage. Actually, despite the Millennium Falcon's odd design, I really think it's a pretty appealing ship - and its really cool! I can't say the same for the Twilight, though.	negative

Thanks for the review. I for one will get this set. I collect and therefore I need it. I vision something like this: A: I buy the set B: I built the set C: Pics for my BS account D: Set taken apart. Sad, but true. It's not much, but super for parts. I agree (from what your review showed me) that this set is a little too much technic. A thing that's been invading our beloved brick built sets in the past years. I really have no need for a retractable front or functioning landing gear. What I need is a kick-ass ship with neat design and cool interior. The Twilight does not offer that. "Look at the size of that thing"	negative

Good review there! My daughter loves the backyard garden of the Twilight My opinion of the ship has changed after reading this, thanks!	positive
[/quote] Part 3: A Closer View[/b] Close-up of the main body of the ship: Front-on. It is well-designed how the figs appear in line of sight (unlike the 6211 where Jabba and Leia were photoshopped in to the box art). Don't ask what Rotta is doing out of the line of vision there. Some things are better left unsaid. [/quote] Rotta: Can I get on your knee to look outside? Anakin: No! Rotta: Can I pull this lever? Anakin: Don't touch it! Rotta: I want to drive! Anakin: If your not quitting I will get you back to that mean white woman. Rotta: I need a clean diaper! Anakin: Ashoka, Get of the toilet! It's my turn to get some rest. Ashoka: I thought I would become a padawan, not a babysitter! [/quote] [The rear deck is so large that it is wasted just being used so Ahsoka can bungee-jump. I came up with a much better use for it. Outdoor garden! Despite having one roboticised hand, Anakin was still quite the green thumb. And his light-saber was very useful as a hedge trimmer. So much so that he set up a side business between Rotta-rescue missions. Here's a promotional postcard: And to finish on a light note, I'd like to remind you that you do get another Ahsoka hairpiece, which can be used for all sorts of things. Ugha warrior upgrade: Dr Inferno hair transplant: And finally, attack of the deadly blue-ringed octopus, native to Australia's beaches and oceans! Thanks for reading!

Having plenty of time on my hands this summer I did some reviews. Yes, I'm aware this has already been done, but I'll just do it once more. No harm there Set# 5615 Set title: The Knight Price: 2.99 Euro / 3.49 USD Pieces: 21 (yes a whole 21 bricks) Release: 2007 The Box: A neat little box that has a great size for dropping into your shopping cart. For once TLG didn't shove the bricks into an oversized cardboard box ;) The Knight: This is a great minifig. Though he looks a little unsatisfied...might be because his head isn't put on "all the way". A great army builder fig. The only thing that I find a little annoying is that the "collar" isn't completely rounded. It looks too much like an animation and left-hand work. The Weapon Rack: YES! Thumbs up for this. Plate mail, sword, shield and jousting helmet. Plus the spear and open helmet on the fig. So many great additions to put into use. Bring it on pesky skeleton army. The all in all verdict: A great set. A little too expensive compared to the Crossbow Attack in which one gets 2 knights and a skeleton plus bricks for 5.49 EURO / 5.99 USD. But still a great army builder set. And the 7090 set, does not have the same Knight fig. KimT	positive
I bought four of these sets. I guess this was the best selling Impulse set so far. Great idea to have weapons and helmet choice. As for the price, I'd say 7090 is surprisingly cheap!	positive
Hard to find (in Italian shops); I had a friend buying one for meas soon as the set was available. I always wanted another one, so while in Switzerland (see KimT's 7009 review for the full story), I bought two. For 5 €uros you get two knights, a skeleton and a skeleton horse, some hand weapons and a shooting device (please remember, don't aim at the eyes!) Just great.	positive
This little bugger brought me back from my Dark Ages! As a movie fan, I just couldn't resist the thought of making an animation with living LEGO skeletons (I'm referring to Ray Harryhausen's work on the classic Jason and the Argonauts here). Buying the Indy sets stopped me from getting a lot more Castle sets. Though in time I added the Final Joust, the Wizard and the impulse Knight to my collection, as well as buying more unique figs (King, Princess) from expensive Castle sets off Bricklink. So yeah. Great little set. Two crownies, a skeleton and a skeletal horse, you just cannot resist that! Even if you hadn't been buying LEGO for 5 years. As far as I'm concerned, this set is One For The Ages! I love it!	positive
I've been waiting to hold this set in my hands for about a year and a half. Thanks to a silly TLC decision, 7009 was not available in Italian stores. I finally decided to buy it on the net (2x , plus some other sets) and those morons at the Custom charged me quite a lot. After I bought it, while waiting for it to arrive, I found out it was available in a store in Switzerland, not far away from home... That's for the storytelling. As for the set, I thought it was great, and still think so. A good army builder (as quite a few sets in the 2007/2008 castle line), and a time traveller (6021 being my first Lego Castle set ever). Rating? 5/5! Edited by The Cobra, 13 August 2008 - 09:04 PM.	positive
Lovely set. Nice collection of weapons. Cool horse-accesoires for the white knight, cool black skeletal horse on the dark knight's side. Loving the printed armours of both knights! And, as opposed to KimT apparently, I really dig the black helmet. I feel there's a Lord of the Rings-flavour to it with those curves. Well designed!	positive
Another small set my local Target doesn't have. They don't have the best castle selection, they only really have dwarven mines and Castle Seiges. I'll buy this if I see it there though, because it looks like a great little set. I could use the awesome knight, and a skeleton that has a regular body so he looks like he is in armor!!!!!	positive
I should really get one more of these for the figures, shields, and weapons. This set is the only one with the scythe in pearl-grey, by the way. "The only thing that puzzles me is; why would a Crown Knight joust a Skeleton?" Good question. For a joust to make sense, this set should contain two human knights instead -- which would be fine with me so long as they had differing armour and colours. Edited by Tenorikuma, 13 August 2008 - 03:51 AM.	neutral
I'm not a huge fan of this set but it is a great way to nab a fully mounted knight complete with a very attractive barding. Given that in prior years it wasn't possible to get a barded horse in such a small set, this set is actually a decent way to build a mounted cavalry for your kingdom. Looking at bricklink, it would probably cost as much to buy the Knight, horse and weapons separately, and that doesn't take into account the skeleton or the extra bricks. Despite my indifference to this set, I actually have purchased four of them in the past year simply because there isn't a cheaper way to acquire a mounted knight.

KimT, on Aug 13 2008, 05:00 AM, said: The quality of the set. Feel free to comment on the review and/or set also. Thanks . The set is average. It's useful for picking up a few knights, but I'm not really partial to the skeleton. The idea of a knight and a skeleton tilting just strikes me as being odd. My biggest issue with the current castle line is that most sets force you to purchase a mixture of skeletons/knights orcs/knights orcs/dwarves etc.. This is fine for those of you who love your fantasy, however it makes the line a bit underwhelming for the rest of us. Still, as mentioned earlier the set does have an upside so it is worth a purchase. The review on the other hand is aces with great photos and a detailed description of the set and its contents. Nice work.	neutral

dj2005, on Aug 29 2008, 11:26 AM, said: I'm a bit curious, does the knight's helm have a hole for plume? I can answer on behalf for KimT, if memories served me right. Yes, there is a hole for placing the knight's plume. Do correct me wrong, if I had answered wrongly. It's been awhile since I last touched my castle sets. Thanks KimT for this fine review. This is one of the castle sets which I had bought high volume, mainly for its horses, barding and the weapons. A great army builder and accessories for your castle armies. This is an instant "5".	positive
First things first. The knight's helm does have a spot for a plume. Now, I really like this set and it was the first one I dug into when I got my collection in the mail. It has a great selection of equipment for good or evil figures and the barding for the horse is outstanding. My only wish was for one of the long chrome swords for the knights. I think the new knights with the tall shield and chrome sword look excellent on foot and on horseback. It would definitely be neat to revisit this set with another human knight instead of the skeleton. Make that change and add a lady to joust for and it'd be bang on.	positive
This looks like a really great set! I wasn't around in '88 to get it but I like it! It actually has things inside the interior! Thanks for the review.

Thanks for the wonderful review. This is really a beautiful set - I love the old lego houses from the 80's and 90's - they were always very quaint and well designed. Actually, I like the old car designs too, but only for their nostalgic value (in reality, they are very unrealistic and look more like go carts). That said, not all four wide cars are silly looking - the 4-wide cars in these city sets are awesome and fit in with the modern CITY style great.	positive
I just bought this! It's truly a wonderful set and I love the houses from that era as well. Very charming. Great review!	positive
This is an awesome set, man... and a great review. Just too bad it is so rare! I voted 5. By the way, does anyone know if there is a review for this? Or other sets that come with a camper, perhaps?

Hello all Eurobricks members and Town Lovers, Today, I will be doing up the third item in the SHELL Promotional series in 1998. Three out of the eight promotional sets are under Town theme. The third in the line is the Exterme Team sub theme which is promoted in 1998. Extreme Team is a bunch of adventurous, daring, breath taking individuals that risk their lives for an unforgettable excitement of the lifetime. Their vehicles range from land, air and sea type of extreme taking types. Extreme Team is one the unknown themes ever released in my "Dark Age". I only had this small lovely set in my Entire Extreme Team collection. Hope we are able to see more interesting reviews under Extreme Team as well. Name: Extreme Team Raft Theme: LEGO System / Town / Promotional / SHELL Year: 1998 Pieces: 19 Minifigs: 1 Price: USD$2.00 An image of a 2537, Extreme Team, Raft This will be an exciting water adventure! This is another great addition to your female population count. She is one of thhe daring individuals in the Extreme Team, that take her raft beyond limit, into the rough waters where she might face possible dangers. Look how confident she is, with those witty eyes of her. I am very sure she will survived the course of her entire journey. Raft's Design This is a very simple design, with just a big piece of wooden plank and a couple of logs tied together on the side, and it is ready to take it down to the water. Speaking of some real adventure, do you dare to take this raft in the unknown waters? There is a small holding area, where she is able to place her critical equipment to ensure her safety throughout the journey. Bottom of the raft Excellent range of equipment This set actually provides very good range of equipment. There is a pair of oars, hammer, life vest and backpack. The most wonderful piece of equipment is the pair of dynamites. First of all, they are printed. Next, they can be used in Wild West or any playing possibilites which involved in explosives. This is a very good impulse set to stock up these accessories. I wondered what she need to use these dynamites for? Her Extreme Team black jacket is very nicely designed, with their logo "X" or another way of saying "Xtreme". I find the green arms and black jacket matched pretty well, with that blue cap. Front view Relaxing herself, listening to the calm sea To summarise, this is one of the better impulse sets ever produced. It comes with a simple raft with tons of good accessories, and a very cheap way to obtain dynamites. In fact, these are my only 2 piece in my entire collection. Somehow, this set managed to find its way to my collection in my Dark Age, and I am very pleased to have this. No major flaws on this set, it fufill the conditions of an excellent impulse set! Summary review Playability: 9.5/10 (High playability involved. You can used it as an Indy, Adventurers or whatever purpose for the raft) Design: 10/10 (Very very simple design with superb great accessories. For a promo/impulse set, it's very good) Price: 9.5/10 (A very inexpensive set based on the 1998 pricing. Great way to buy this to add in some adventures of your own) Overall: 9.7/10 (This is a fanastic set, mainly for its accessories. Get it if you still see any of these. It's defintely worth the money, if its reasonable) I gave it a "5" based on my Review Score Card. What about yours? Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed. Pictures can be found in My Brickshelf (When moderated)	positive
Overall, an excellent set concerning the price range. Nice review, WhiteFang!	positive
Good set, I laughed at the dynamite, but not as much as that axe... not many trees on the rapids. Looks like she's got more than dynamite to cause havoc in the harbour...	positive
Again a great review, WhiteFang! I voted for Average: The minifig and the accessoríes are excellent - but the raft itself is very poor. Klaus-Dieter	neutral
Glad some of you like this set for the wide variety of good accessories. It seemed some are unfavour of the raft's design. Well, I think for an impulse set. The raft's design is quite good. At least, it took care of the color scheme well. It's just a simple raft for the adventurer to move onto the river stream and throw some dynamitte to blow some obstacles away. Cpt. Pegleg Blockbeard, on Aug 14 2008, 03:29 PM, said: This would be great for any Pirate fan, the extraback pack for the soldiers, some spare owes for the row boats, a female face for a wench, and a rather simple raft for that unlucky pirate lost at sea!

Aerial Recovery Set #: 6462 Theme: Town Res-Q Year Released: 1998 Piece Count: 201 Minifigs: 3 List Price: $25 (USD) My personal favorite of the Res-Q theme released in 1998 was this helicopter, 6462 Aerial Recovery. The set offered a pretty modern helicopter, raft, three-wheeler, rescue gurney and net, and three figs including a diver. The set is action-packed and offers a high degree of play value. Starting with the box, front side and back: Front Back I always liked the rough ocean/sea water pictured in the boxart. The same image from the front of the box appears on the cover of the instructions: But the back of the instructions picture a plain view of the copter: One sticker sheet with a few "Res-Q" stickers is included, mainly for the tail section of the helicopter: Interestingly, the set includes three figures, one being a diver. What I always found strange is the inclusion of an "X-Treme Team" Diver who has the logo on his torso (although it's a very nice fig): Back shot: I think this was my first set with a Lego three-wheeler. I always liked it a lot: The set includes a yellow raft (also found in the Divers sets) and some scuba gear: NOTE: the raft has a black piece in it's center for lifting up by the helicopter For sea and emergent rescue, a gurney can also be lifted by the helicopter: The set also includes a net with hook to lift the three-wheeler and other items. An extra string pulls the net closed: Here's a shot of the helicopter: The front section has a large trans. blue piece enclosing the cockpit: Inside is a printed radar slope: A smaller trans. blue piece appears a bit higher for access to the middle section of the helicopter and/or a small storage area: In the middle section is an place for the gurney and a box for storing some of the adventure gear: Here's a picture showing the gurney: On the side is a pulley mechanism that swings to the right when not in use: On the opposite side is the winch to raise and lower the grappling hook: Here's a picture of an open storage box: I like the tail section with propeller: Decal is not shown Here's another shot of the copter from a different angle: And the final image, the entire set: Final Thoughts Personally, I think this is pretty nice set. I like the thought of using the helicopter to rescue people at sea using the working winch. Extras like the trike/three-wheeler and the rescue net make the set even more fun. Hope you enjoy this Res-Q review.	positive
Thanks for this review TheBrickster, i also have this set and think it's one of the best helicopters TLG made in the 90's. It's quite big and has got place for 2 minifigs in the cockpit. I also like the fact that there's a victim included in form of the x-treme diver, which also is a theme i always loved as a kid. Do you have any other Res-Q sets left to review? It would be an honour for me to also do a review of one or more sets which are left, but unfortunately i got not much time at the moment.	positive
I got this set as well as a Res-Q hovercraft. This set is cool because of all the accessories and it come with a X team guy. Your set is also in much better condition than mine. You have made me decide to rebuild it. Another great review TheBrickster. Keep up the good work.	positive
Looks like a nice helicoptor, I love the 2 cockpits. I love the diver's head, I really need one of those.	positive
This helicopter is so cool and I agreed with you that this is a high playablity set. It's not common to see such a big scale helicopter which has two cockpits back then. The color scheme works well for me. With so much features such as the lowering of the grappling hook, storage box, storing of the gurney and etc. One thing which can be improved onto the helicopter is the rotors. It could be extended a little longer as the size of the helicopter is too big. It makes the rotors rather weak as it is not able to support the weight. I am confused why there is an extreme team personnel there. I thought he was supposed to be recovered from the Res-Q team? Although there is so many questions in my head such as why include the black tri-cycle bike, Extreme Team, and etc but this is still one very good set to play with. Too bad, I had never seen this before. Somehow, through your review, I like it very much. The only big scale helicopter which I owned is the 7738 Coast Guard Helicopter and Lift Raft. Neverthless, I gave this a "4". Thanks Brickster.	positive
The helicopter looks nice and the RESQ minifigs were nice. The diver minifig had once been a personal favorite of mine.	positive
Thanks for the review brickster, I do own this set in it's original form, The only drawback that I have noted previously is the lack of rotor's and the cobraesq of the copter body I wish it had a larger fuselage but I still have it and I still like it despite my criticism....Which I am sure is in my eyes only. Thanks again Brickster. I wish I had bought some of the other Res Q sets but of course I only bought three.	neutral
I think the set is too unrealistic, I like the new ResQ sets better (and I'm somewhat a Lifeboat freak so I'm always following such a sets with interest). I would like to see some rigit inflatable boats some day ;) but about the chopper, I like the accessoiries.	negative
What exactly makes you feel this set isn't realistic? It has got nothing what wouldn't be on a real helicopter, imo. and for the futuristic design, yes, it looks modern, but it works. And actually, most of today's real helicopters also don't look like in the 70's anymore.	positive
metalandi, on Aug 24 2008, 04:17 PM, said: What exactly makes you feel this set isn't realistic? Since the question was asked... 1) tiny rotors 2) dual cockpits (only seen on a few military copters) 3) stretcher extends beyone edges of fuselage when inside the vehicle 4) Extra long canopy (really only seen on military helicopters), and "military" design. 5) Black colorscheme for rescue vehicle. The the stretcher, minifig designs and rescue logo are the only things about this copter that really suggest that it is a civilian rescue aircraft. It's a toy set with alot of play value, but I agree with Karto that these kind of desgins really turned me off to alot of the TOWN and CITY sets of the 90's. On the positive side, the new CITY sets, with thier realistic non-futuristic designs have really tempted me to buy more vehicles.	neutral
It took quite some time, but now i'm finally continuing with city reviews. This one beeing about a really good set of the RES-Q theme, and also one of my favourites of this theme. It brings a lot of playability and an incredible amount of useful pieces, even with only 145 bricks in complete. Set Nr.: 6451 Name: River Response Number of minifigs: 3 Number of pieces: 145 Release Year: 1998 Price: ~20 USD (Back then, when it was new) Unfortunately i haven't got the box of this set anymore, but the instructions are still there in good condition: We get 3 RES-Q minifigs in this set, from which i really love the detailed torso's: A shot of the complete set with both the boat and the little car off board: The before mentioned car is really, really little, but it still got enough space to transport 2 minifigs: A closeup of the rubber dinghy: The speed boat as stand-alone: As already said before, this set brings a big count of equipment and accesoires with it, which is really good for a set this size: In the middle section of the boat there is enough space for a minifig to sit in and put on his diving equipment: And last but not least, a shot from the whole set wirh everything attached, at the front section you can see a wench which also adds a lot to the set: When i got this set back in the day, i was really happy about it and for sure spent a lot of tie playing with it, because of it's great features as the wench in the front of the boat, or the car the boat can transport. I hope you like my little review, stay tuned for more in the next days! edit: I forgot the poll, can sombody add it please? I don't know how to do or if it is possible to do that myself Edited by metalandi, 15 August 2008 - 03:59 PM.	positive
This is one of my favourite sets. I remember getting it in Tesco soon after it was released. Those were the days... The res-q line was good, and this set made it better.	positive
wow. I loved this set, I still have it actually... in pieces though, i took it apart quite soon after i got it, then managed to lose the instruction manual	positive
If you still have all the parts, try to rebuild it, you'll see that it's a great feeling!	positive
Very nice review. This is another set which I had never seen before when I am in my dark age. Quite an useful set, especially with the accessories and the minifigs' torsos. The speedboat is able to hold the car and the rubber rescue boat. How can the driver steer this boat with so many things blocking the way? I can't seemed to find its control though. Thanks for doing this review.	neutral
Nice review. I always wanted this set. The speed boat makes the set. Thanks for sharing.	neutral
Well I for one really like this set it has to be one of the nicer ribbies that TLG has made tons of playability and nice options for redesign, Great set overall. Thanks for the review.	positive
Nice review I collect castle too and the ghost isn't really rare (I have one too) but it's not really found anymore so It would be a good thing to keep it. anyway great review Edited by mammymarf, 15 August 2008 - 08:48 PM.	neutral
About the rarest one up there is that black ninja. I only have one ninja and he is dark grey. I also have five samurai. The witch may be fairly rare but I am not sure. I didn't really collect much in the Fright Knight era.	neutral
Very nicely done - this cart is a striking resemblance to the crossbow cart we got in 2007.	positive
Nice review I agree with Thok it’s quite similar to the more recent crossbow attack, though this one has the added benefit of two shields. This set would I fleet be more useful to army builders than most of the modern castle sets, even though many people don’t like frightknights.	neutral
Quote even though many people don’t like frightknights. I don't really like Fright Knights either I just happened to have this set.	neutral
Thanks for the review. I've added it to the index. I'm not a fan of this theme. But I have to say that this is a neat little set, that does hold some good things. Figs and weapons are always welcome and one can never have to many wheels. So I rate this "Average."	neutral
This is a pretty nice set. I really like the torso and its "genericness" so it can be used for other factions. And at least this set has 2 shields (althought I prefer the triangular ones) instead of just 1 shield you get from crossbow attack (from the wrong fraction, I'd have liked a crown knights shield 100x better). Some improvements for this set would be a normal bow and a sword instead of 2 of the 3 crossbows, smaller wheels and triangular shields. 4/5 from me (actually 3,5 but I'll round it up)	positive
Great Review! This set has cool features. I just wish that Lego would release this as a Lego Legend and release it to Australia too, since this is a set about Australia. I would've bought two if this were a Lego Legend. That is how good it is. I like the building with latticed window and windmill. I also like the cargo airplane, windsock, and radios. Plus it looks like it's got great minifigs.	positive
This was a cool set I thoght of it as i was building The post plane.	positive

I suppose it's the yellow. The plane in this set is much different than most of the other Classic Town airplanes in that it has the double tail section. Here's a shot of the new 7732 Air Mail set - definately a nice set:	positive
I have had this on my Bricklink wanted list for ages, and yet noone with my criteria has it. Nice review and brilliant set.	positive
Whats wrong with another yoda and some nice light blue bricks? I probably would destroy this set, and keep the minifigs intack tough, chrome lightsabers on!	neutral
Thanks for the review KimT! Oldies reviews(old sets ) Are always appreciated. I feel this set isn't that great. 1- Yoda: He is by far the best part of the set. Although, is his weapon blue? 2-Lord Tyrannus: Pretty nice! I feel the middle part of his torso is a bit bland, but that isn't a problem. I wish they would make a fleshie one too. 3- Speeder bike: I always hated this design. The back looks terrible to me. Way too bulky in my opinion. It jusn't give me the image that it's the same as the movie. The lightsaber is amazing! Why is it only in this set? 4-Yoda-Lifter: What? That is terrible. But at least it has some nicely colored parts.... A fine set, but not the best IMO.	negative
You think it's not a great thing that we get a Yoda fig in an affordable set like this?!? That was the main reason why I got this set! And what do you mean by "another"? Wasn't this the only one that was ever released except for the one in the Dagobah/X-Wing set? Sure, he is not the best fig with the unmovable legs and all, but still: It's Yoda! Besides, he doesn't move his legs a lot in "real" life either. Nice review, though, and thanks for telling me what that liftarm-thingy was meant to be for. I never got that and thought it was supposed to lift up the speeder for some reason. I got two of this set, and the printing on those blue parts were off in the second one I got. Edited by Oky Wan Kenobi, 18 August 2008 - 08:45 PM.	positive
No, Yoda was released in no less than 3(4) sets. Ok, so I remembered wrong. I just have plenty Yodas and one is more than enough For the set list click here Thanks for pointing that out.	neutral
Nice review I realy like this set, two nice minifigs in an affordable set and i do like the speeder but that lift thing is strange, but now at least i know what it is, thanks for letting me know!	positive
Thanks for the nice review KimT . I like this set especially by the fact that it is the only set containing the Dooku minifig and the curved lightsaber , I also think that the minifig is cool but I also own the Dagobah x-wing and the wookiee catamaran sets so I have enought minifigs (A clone wars version would be very cool ) and the extra-thingy is well, just OK. The bad part is that I don?t buy the set when it is out and now is go for $40 on ebay and bricklink . Edited by darkrebellion, 18 August 2008 - 09:51 PM.	neutral
I think this is a pretty lame set. It came with Dooku, who I think only came in this set, plus a unique Lightsaber. Still, they could have made it much bigger, added Anikan and Obi-Wan, and added structures and made it more like the scene from the movie. Also, the speeder doesn't seem very accurate.	negative
I wonder how expensive this set would be on Ebay. (Shop Victoriously)	neutral
I missed this set.But i reallly like the yoda and count dooku.I especially like count dooku's lightsaber.One thing though,is it me oris yoda's lightsaber blue in the picture? Edited by pr0visorak, 20 August 2008 - 12:21 PM.	positive
I was very lucky to get this set and I love it, I dont have it built cause i bought it for parts but it was fun while it lasted. .	positive
I got this set a long time ago. The review pretty much says all there is to say about it. (Never knew what the red/brown thing was anyway, I used it as a canon.) Isn't this also the only set up until now that had Count Dooku in it?	neutral
Great review, KimT! At that time, it was still in my dark age and I hated myself not to get this set earlier. This is quite inexpensive and you are able to get two greatest characters especially Count Dooku. The minifigs are excellent, especially the unique design of Count Dooku's lightsaber. I have no problem with the speedbike, as it looks quite alright to me. As for the elevation of Yoda's jump adds some playabilty, but that does not work well for me. Nevertheless, the main attractive factor is Count Dooku and I have to rate it a "5". I never own a Yoda, except for the magnet version.	positive
Cheers for the review KimT! Of the initial Episode II Lego releases this set was the least inspiring, but the minifigs were must-haves. You can't go wrong with Count Dooku and Yoda! I like the design of Dooku's speeder in the movie but Lego missed the mark a bit with it here and gave him a dodgy flying boat instead! The speeder cradle/Yoda jumping mechanism was just a waste of parts unfortunately. I'd like to see Dooku's speeder re-imagined by Lego. They've come a long way in the way they design a lot of the new Star Wars sets	neutral
I know we have another review of this set, but since I just got it, I thought I would share my comments on it. Set Name: Droid Gunship Platform Number: 7678 Pieces: 329 Price: $29.99 Before we begin I will say that I like having a droid gunship, but I still hope we get a MAF: HMP Droid Gunship: MAF Droid Gunship: On to the review. Here we have the box. It is really shiny, and smooth, and fits the set's size okay. It has a clean, bright look, and is truley outstanding. The back of the box, which has the features of the set, as well as the other three CW sets. The contents The siticker sheet. No to bad, and the stickers have clear backs, which is always nice. Instructions Here we have the figs(two new droids and one older armed droid for the cockpit), and the extra parts. The build starts with the flat base. Pretty simple. The bottom. The side lasers. Next is the head: It starts pretty soild. The side buble laser turrets. Loveing the detail. On the ship: The "lid" and eyes. The finished cockpit. Cozy interior... Would have had more room if it were the MAF though. The front landing gear. Simple and effective. The back landing gear. The rockets. The clips are annoying. But it make the rockets work so, I guess it was nessecary. Mounted on the bottom. Not very secure, but that's why they are meant to be dropped on the clones.... The finished ship. --------------------------------------------- Let me say that the droid gunship is a nice set indeed. Final rating: 86% Hope you enjoyed the review! Please, if you have a ny questions, pic requests, etc, then by all means, ask! Best Regards, VBBN	neutral
Very nice review. One thing you have to consider: when lego sees pics of the star wars universe, they have to decide which would be the easiest set to make with the most playibility. Therefore, they chose the HMP. Quote Thanks for the review. It's always good to have a 2nd opinion on a set. I've added the usual poll and I'll index it tomorrow (must sleep). Super pics and great to have "in-build" pics default_thumbup.gif A fine set which I'll surely buy when I find it. default_hmpfbad.gif Where? Edited by Lt. Col.

It took a long time, but now here it is, the Review of the X-Treme Team Set 6584 Extreme Team Challenge. TheBrickster asked me a few weeks ago to do this, since he unfortunately never owned this great set, so here we go! First i have to say, that i really love this late 90's Town Theme, and i wish there would have been produced more sets. This is the only one i own, well, beside that i also still have 6572 Wind Runners, but the car is missing. Anyway, let's face the facts and let the pictures speak for themselves! Sub-Theme: X-Treme Team Set Nr.: 6584 Name: Extreme Team Challenge Number of minifigs: 4 Number of pieces: 354 Release Year: 1998 Let's start off with a few quick shots of the box & instructions: Inside of the box: We got some ideas for alternative models on the backside (the same ones are also on the backside of the instructions): Instructions: Here's an overall view of this huge set: We get 4 minifigs, each with different heads and color patterns, which i really like: ...and also a good amount of equipment for them: Let's move on with the cool vehicles, there are 3 (!) completely different ones in this set, first is the neat little trike: Next, the not less neat "4-wheeled off-road-thing" (don't know what's it called really ): And finally the huge Monster truck, i love the chrome sidepipes and the wench with the hook in the back, which adds a lot of playability: Oh, i almost forgot our brave adventurers also have got a raft to ride the wild mountain waters: Now let's focus on the many details of the mountain base. We got a bridge over troubled waters, but be aware, it's very unstable! Love the wood patterns on the yellow 1x6 tiles: On a corner a camera is mounted to document the wild life: For the evenings we also got a little campfire: Down by the river sits a grey falcon and watches the guys on their challenges: What's that? Seems not very safe, to be honest..be aware when you pass by these rocks.... ....cause it will collapse! Let's move up again where the tent is placed, inside is plenty of space to take a rest for the figs and to store their equipment: But i think they should have built the tent on another place cause the ground isn't very good there: When you pull the mechanism, a trap door opens: Will the guys all come back home safe and not injured? You decide! All in all this is a really great set, ome may say it is a bit juniorized because of the baseplate, but it really isn't. It's got a LOT of playability and some rare parts, the biggest beeing the baseplate which is only available in this set. I hope you liked my review, let me know your opinions! Edited by metalandi, 23 August 2008 - 12:56 PM.	positive
I remember getting this for christmas, and despite the earthy grey parts I relly enjoyed it, and it is nice to see pictures of it again- Thanks.	positive
Excellent review Metalandi! I really think this looks like a fun set. I esp. love the mountain, bridge, and baseplate. It has adventure fun written all over it. Thanks for taking the time to review this set. I've always seen it in pictures, but never close-up.	positive
Metalandi, thanks for doing up this review! This is a chance for me to gain some insight for Extreme Team theme. This is a very interesting set that can be used for so many purposes. 3 different vehicles, wide range of accessories and nice minifigs. What I love the most, is the mountain, bridge and tent. It provided so much playability. I am very impressed with it. Thanks for sharing.	positive
Cool set! I like the tent and monster truck the most.	positive
When I first saw this review title, I thought it said "Rapid River Review" thinking it was an Indian set (6766). Nice review though. I never got into Rock Raiders. I would have loved the large drill bit piece for set #s 4970 and 4940. This set looks like a little boulder hawler, and a nice set to introduce someone unfamilar with the theme. I esp. like the fig and the little 2x2 drill bit tile. The overall set looks like it has some very useful mining-type pieces. Nice review and thanks for sharing.	neutral
I have never seen this set before but the minifig head would be perfect for a Solid Snake from MGS 2!	positive
Rock Raiders was the shit back in the day. Awesome theme! I had this set as well as the Tunnel Transporter, which was amazing.	positive
Thanks for the review! Rock Raiders was one of the last new themes i knew as a kid before my dark ages came. Unfortunately i never managed to get any sets from it, beside a few months ago the 4910 The Hover Scout, which i review a while ago. Wish i can get some of the bigger sets in the future.	neutral
I always thought that this set was under-rated. It contains a really interesting collection of parts, a decent fig, and introduces an odd theme in only one set. Very well designed for one of the 'not greats'. God Bless, Nathan	positive
Hello all Eurobricks members and Classic Town Lovers, *** Editor's Note: To mark the celebration of Classic Town, this set which is released in 1994 and re-released as a LEGEND in 2002. Pizza to Go Review, is dedicated to Classic Town's opening cermony and members such as Hinckley, Brickster, ImperialShadows, Sinner and many others whom have contributed to the final success of Classic Town! Thank you so much for inviting me to be part of this wonderful project, and I wish all the best to the success of Classic Town! I urge everyone of you to check out Classic Town and take alook at the cool stuff we have done! *** Today, I will be doing up a review on Pizza To Go set. This outlet is one of the most favourite eatery for any LEGO citizens living in their town. When they are driving on the road, they are sure to look out "PIZZERIA" signage. They offer the best pizza in town. No one in town can resist the delicious aroma of Pizza, coming out from the red chimney. Let us find out why is this shop so popular among so many LEGO citizens and was one of the famous sets that is re-released under the "LEGEND" theme. Pizza To Go is my favourite set of all time. I believed there is no other pizza outlet lying around in any LEGO city apart Pizzeria. It seemed there are the sole outlet that is selling pizza for many years. This set was re-released in 2002 and it is part of the LEGEND theme. This is one of the few sets that are highly demanded to be brought back by many fans of LEGO around the world. I owned the 6350. Any members whom had owned both sets before? Is there any difference between these two? Because when I searched through Peeron, it shown 144 pieces instead of 194 pieces for the 1994 set. Name: Pizza To Go Theme: LEGO System / Town Year: 1994 (Re-release: 2002) Pieces: 194 Minifigs: 3 An image of a 6350, Pizza To Go Let the delivery begins! Pizza To Go is the regular pizza outlet that sells nothing but pizza. They deliever pizza to every household in town, with their trusty delivery van. Walk-in are welcomed too. There is a stand for customers to dine in their pizza quickly before making their way to their next destination. In my opnon, no town can ever survive without the Pizza Tradition! Devoted "PIZZERIA" staff Every outlet comes with 3 dedicated staff, making sure that operations will run smoothly. On the left, we will have the Pizza Boy, whom is wearing the regular blue dungarees and its white cap. I wonder who is that boy? On the middle, we will have the Pizza Girl. She looks like any typical sweet girl in town that the boys will look at. She is wearing a suntop strapless on her. She reminded me of one person though, I think her name is called Alice. Taking a careful look, I wonder if ImperialShadows is the Pizza Boy back then, without that black patch on its left eye? On another note, this mini-figure was my favourite. Female mini-figures are very uncommon back then. I am glad I have this figure, adding to my town population. On the right, we will have the hardworking chef, preparing the pizzas in the oven. He wears the regular white chef outfit, but he wear a grey pants instead of the usual full-white outfit in most resturants such as Breezeway Cafe (6376). Let's take a closer look at the Pizza Boy's van! This van is very very small looking and very fuel efficient. It is able to cut lanes very fast due to its small size. The pizza van is made up of 4-studs wide design. No doors by the side. However, in this vehicle, I think the doors is not a must to be included in this design. Our Pizza Boy will need to leave vehicle pretty fast, and ensuring that the pizza delivery is on time. Common mechanism This van has the regular rooftop that can be lifted up to place the Pizza Boy into the driver seat. There is a sun roof on its top, which enable him to let him have some sunlight from above! The logo on the side of it, is actually a transparent sticker, which have the PIZZERIA itallian logo and a tasty looking pizza on both sides of its van. I like that sticker very much. Mine looks quite worn out over time. If its a printed piece, It will be a terrific bonus. Nevertheless, I can still accept the sticker. Our pizza van can deliever up to 2 pizza at a go! At every trip, 2 piping hot pizza will be stored at the back of the van. The pizza is fitted in perfectly in each compartment. Furthermore, the white window shutter, is terrific in this design. You don't see this kind of design anymore. I think, I have not seen much delivery vans on the street anymore too. Base of the van From the base, you can see that it is using of the regular red car base that is common in most 4-studs vehicle design. In fact, this car base served as a foundation for its vehicle design. Back of PIZZERIA Alice and the Chef will be showing you around at the back of the kitchen. There is an oven on the left, a water tap and a holder for the oar stick. Looks pretty empty right? Look below for a surprise! My favourite feature! This oven can be used to heat up 2 pizzas at a go. Now, I understand why, this set is named "Pizza To Go". I have been using their slogan unknowingly. This feature is superb nice. Now, we know that the pizza is prepared from the outlet instead of using delivery van to collect it from a factory. Alice, what are you waiting for? Help the Chef quickly! PIZZERIA! The signage sure looks big from far and catches their attention easily too with its pleasnt looking design. As you have already noticed, this is made up of sticker. I don't mind, for this set, it contains sticker. Sometimes, I do hope they can give us spare sticker for us to change, after a long period of time. Distinct red chimney This is the front of the oven, and that is where the smoke comes out. Using only bricks to construct this, is simply wonderful. I like the use of their white bricks to construct the wall layout, and a combination of red parts, especially on the top. I like the look of this very much. Another picture on its side Printed parts In this set, you will get a total of 5 pizzas! And, I believed no other sets offer so many pizza. You can placed up to 4 pizzas in the van and oven. Alice will be carrying the last pizza around. The green and red round dish is a printed part. Most Exclusive part in 6350/10036 The most unique and important printed parts that is only exclusive in this set. It's at the front of the Pizza van. It is none other, but the Pizzeria logo, standing at the front of the delivery van. (Forgotten to take a picture of this piece, took it from Peeron.) Different views of Pizza To Go outlet Another bright sunday day in Pizza To Go! Summary review Playability: 10/10 (A lot of playing by doing up the pizza process. From preparing to delivery) Design: 9.5/10 (Outstanding design, with great use of bricks. I like the structure of it very much) Price: 9.5/10 (An inexpensive set based on the 1994 pricing. It comes with 3 mini-figs, shop, a van, and a exclusive printed piece) Overall: 9.7/10 (I am not trying to be bias. In fact, this set is absoultely filled with minimum flaws. Look at my review again, if you are not satisfied with it, or tell me what you don't like!) I gave it a "5" based on my Review Score Card. What about yours? Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed. Pictures can be found in My Brickshelf(When moderated)	positive
Easily one of the best town sets ever (and pretty expensive for its size too, is/was it that rare?). I hope I still have all the pieces from mine, unfortunately, my stickers are in pretty bad shape (took them off because I needed the bricks, stupid stickers covering multiple parts , only downside to this set). The design is simple, yet so detailed, and the pizza van looks great. 5/5	positive
I rate it a full 5 too. And I wish Lego would make a set like this in 2010. A town needs pizza! Edit: don't always trust Peeron. Sometimes they miss some pieces, and sometimes they just can't count them! Edited by The Cobra, 24 August 2008 - 11:41 AM.	positive

Sandy, on Aug 24 2008, 07:33 PM, said: For the review, I just have to point out a few things, to give you constructive criticism: first of all, it's chef, not "chief" (entirely different professions), and secondly, the scale you give in the poll isn't very even. "Above average" jumps to "outstanding", which is a too big of a gap in my opinion. You should've used "Good" or "Great" in between them. But these are only minor faults, this is a good review anyway! Sandy, I appericate your constructive comments in order to improve the quality of my review. I had amended the word "chief" to "chef". You might want to check it. I did not notice that I was using the wrong word. As for the poll definitions which have been used, for 1 to 5. We used "Poor" to represent value "1" while "Outstanding" to represent value "5". We need to use clear definitions to illustrate and demostrate non-bias towards the review for the readers to cast their vote depending on their individual liking. Therefore, we used a common word which is known as "Average". In surveys, for measuring its sample size's liking, we have to use words which is neutral such as Strongly agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly disagree. That's why, we used this rating approach to represent the terms. The Cobra, on Aug 24 2008, 07:37 PM, said: I rate it a full 5 too. And I wish Lego would make a set like this in 2010.

nice review,3 or 4 years ago my Dad picked up two large boxes full of classic era legos (classic town,some pirate,and alittle episode 1 star wars etc)i couldn't find the building in this set but i had the little van from this set.Its very sturdy, i should know my idiot friend dropped this from my second floor window and it styed togethersure the pizzas fell out and they probably got cold thanks for the review!	neutral
Great review! I really like this set and plan on getting it on bricklink. It would certainly add something to my collection!	positive
Wow. Great review!	neutral
I got the original version as a surprise one Christmas. My parents liked the design so much they got it for me. This is one of the best town sets. If it didn't have the delivery van it would have been on par with 6683 Hamburger Stand, a great set in its own right. The van, and they way the back holds the pizzas, is ingenious and bumps this set up to the highest levels.	positive
I remember having this set when it was originally released a good few years back, but I don't think I have it anymore. I remember I thought it was really awesome though. I thought the oven and pizza storage in the back of the car were the greatest parts, the little sink on the inside was cool too. Didn't realise they had made a Legends set out of it... I'd love to own this set again, but MISB examples on Bricklink go for an extortionate amount of money. Ah well, se la vie...	positive
Thanks for all of your kind words and great support for this once famous LEGEND set, which got a second chance to be re-released again for people whom had missed it before. Indeed, this is the kind of LEGO sets which is great addition for any LEGO Town or City.

Nice review. I have this set, and I like it alot. Its a master peice!	positive
INDEXED Allright, hi everybody again! Today, i'm gonna review the biggest set of the RES-Q Subtheme, 6479 Emergency Response Center. With this one i think, the reviews of all the RES-Q sets are complete now, and while i'm in a reviewing mode right now i thought i'd bring that up. This set hast got many nice aspects and also some very rare pieces, and comes with a wonderful amount of vehicles, including a speedboat, a tow truck, a helicopter, and a trike which can pull a little boat. So sit down, get your popcorn and beer, we're off to stormy weather at the coast! Sub-Theme: RES-Q Set Nr.: 6479 Name: Emergency Response Center Number of minifigs: 5 Number of pieces: 420 Release Year: 1998 Unfortunately i don't have many of the boxes of my res-q sets anymore, so i'll start right off with the instructions this time: On the backside there is no alternate model as usual this time, but only a different shot of the whole set: Next, a general overview, sorry about the slightly bad picture quality on some pics this time: Originally this set has 5 minfigs (which all are really nice!), but the guy who drives the tow truck has been lost in the flood Here's a picture of the missing fig: Let's move on to the vehicles, we have something for the water, the ground and the air in this set, first the great tow truck: I love the mechanism with the hooks in the back: Next on, da Speedboat! At the rear, it's got a stretcher and a wench, which adds a lot of playability: If there's a a little accident near the coast, the trike comes to appearance: For more complicated stuff, we have a little helicopter (i broke the rotating piece at the top yesterday, ouch! : ) No space for a victim you say? Well, not really, but the helicopter also got a wench with a hook in the back: Now it comes to the station itself, at the docks a neat life belt sign is mounted (remember, at this time there weren't real ones as today): A little more right an equipment holder is placed, with various tools on the front... ...and fire fighter equip at the back: At the very front a little lighttower secures the shelter: I haven't quite found out what this thing is supposed to be, maybe somebody knows Another equipment holder, this time with all the stuff you need for diving: More equipment... ...and even MORE! We come to the hear piece of the station, the control room with lots of buttons and scrrens: Last but not least, a quick shot of all the accesoires and tools that you get, which really is an A-MA-ZING amount! This set might have a few junioriced pieces, as the big window in the front or the "briedge" on the roof, but that doesn't matter, because there is nearly one other set in which you get so much rare pieces and such an overwhelming amount of accesoires, so i can recommend that for everybody who is a pieces-fanatic. Not to forget the playability, the great figs and the, in my opinion very good color scheme. Once again thanks for taking the time reading and looking at my review, i hope you liked it. Edited by TheBrickster, 31 December 2009 - 09:19 PM.	positive
I own this set and it's one of my favourites, simply because of the cool colour scheme which you mention, plus all the vehicles and accessories. The Res-Q theme is one of my faves of all time actually, I own nearly all of them (missing a small set that was only available in the US or Japan, I think). Dr. S.	positive

bad quality pictures? What's wrong with them? This is a great review and thanks! I was planning on buying this set and no others but the price stunned me. Thus I bought the AT-TE and the RGS.... The set is better than I thought though; I might do as Mutley did and make my own!	positive
Thank you KimT for adding the poll. Hehe. This is my first review so, I'm not so confident about the pictures. Thank you guys for viewing and commenting.	neutral
Baby, I will like to take a moment to said "Outstanding piece of review for your first attempt!" You have done well with the pictures and its flow. I have to admit that I love this Fighter Tank very much. The downside of it which is overpriced, and two Clone troopers do not really justify the purchase. Well, if I have the spare cash, I will defintely get one of this. Keep it up.	positive
It's a shame it only comes with two figs. It would be great for my ancient Middle-East project.	negative
Thanks for the pics so far. Will you have high-res pics of the other sets in the instructions?	positive
MattZitron, you have done well to display images of the Dung Stain hull... Its a darn shame that it can't be extended. However, I see no reason why LEGO couldn't produce a special middle hull piece that is compatible. Although the way they've made the hull is a bit stupid. The old system was a lot more flexible. Better still why can't LEGO design a hull that can be extended in length and width... Then they could be as made as long or wide as desired and that would be great!	negative
They have made a special middle piece in this 4+ set: http://www.brickset....aspx?Set=7075-1 The only problem is that it's red.	negative

I received this set with a $25 gift card, so It was a great buy. It follow with a similar build to the 2007 trucks, but has a few improvements. Of course, the name of the set could have been a bit more creative... And yes, this was an academy review. Set name: Truck and Forklift Number: 7733 Pieces: 343 Theme: City Year Released: 2008 Price: $25.00 USD, ?19.99 GBP, 24.00 Euro 1/Box Now the box follows a design similar to most other City sets. It has the set information and photo of the set on the front, (sorry for it getting cut off, I will remake it). Now the back of the box shows what each bag builds. Bag 1 is for the forklift, bag 2 is for the cab, and bags 3 and 4 are for the containers. It also has the set's features. 2/Contents The instructions: There are 2 books included with the set: One for the forklift, and one for the truck. Minifigure(1) The first minifig you build is a simple cargo worker. Interesting/new parts: Here we have some interesting and new parts. They include a yellow seat, a 1x2 plate with clips, and a 1x4 slope. 3/The build Cargo1 The first cargo palette has a few crates on it. I really like the sticker on the small box. Forklift: The forklift is a very fun extra to build, and it is probably the best forklift that we have had so far. It is very realistic and is very strong. Cargo2 The next piece of cargo is some Octan barrels on a meter. I am not sure what It is supposed to be, but it is still a nice addition to the set. Minifgure(2) The second minifigure is a classic driver with sunglasses and a coffee mug. Very nice. New piece! This is a very nice new piece that is included in the set, a hollow canopy. I believe it is also in White with the police mobile command station. Truck: Now anyone who has had one of the Lego City Harbor sets from last year, then you will probably find this build to be very similar. Mostly in the cab part of the truck. The trucks build is very solid, and very realistic. I sense ths will bring the ratings up quite a bit. Mystery Cargo: For some time specualtion has been going around, what exactly is this? It seems like nuero poison.. I am very happy with those 2x2 cylinders in trans-yellow. In fact, you can join in and guess what it may be in this topic. Containers: The first container is built to hold one palette. It fits onto the truck. It produces a very pleasing result, and has a better look to it than the Containers from last year had. The second container has the ability to hold two palettes, and has a design similar to the first. Then, you build on the wheels. The back ones have beautiful mudflaps! Finshed set: ---------------------------------- Parts: 10/10 (lots of useful pieces, great colors, and some very cool new pieces.) Minifigs: 8/10 (I would have liked another but it was $25, so I guess its okay.) Price per part: 10/10 (almost 350 pieces for $25. ) Playability: 8/10 (Forklifts are always fun, and there are lots of things to do with this set.) Overall: 36/40 90% A- This is truley an outstanding set, and It will make a great addition to anyones collection. Mocers would aslo like this, due to the fact that it has some really nice parts. It has a great build, and utilizes some awesome new techniques. It also has details, something you might look for in a set. Highly Recommended. Hope everyone enjoyed the review! If you have any pic requests, questions, etc., please ask! I look forward to hearing your comments, and the judges comments as well. 7733 Peeron.com 7733 Bricklink Catalog 7733 Shop At Home	positive

Didn´t you have one already or what made you think it´s new? The big letdown on this set is the big canopy. I would have preferred single bricks for that. And for this truck there is no real need for a hollow canopy - it could as well have been made of solid bricks. Maybe we get another set with different use of the canopy. This is one of the reasons I didn´t buy it so far. And I´m especially NOT interested in another forklift, I have plenty of those... I agree it´s the best one we have seen so far though. Thanks! I have a yellow seat, but I just thought it was interesting. As for the canopy, it really looks good on the finished truck; I like it. And that forklift could be the official one, and the rest could become parts...	positive
Nice work VBBN I'm not really into technic myself, but you've definately done a fine review on this set Funny that it actually fits a minifig. Perhaps we'll see fans design forklifts with technic and having it minifig sized	positive

The Y-wing is the work horse of the Rebel Alliance. It’s well armed and heavily armoured, but you’ll need it because you’ll be moving like a sleepy hut! – General Rieekan Set Name: Y-wing Starfighter Set Number: 7658 Number of Pieces: 454 Figures:2 Released: 2007 List Price: £39.99 Lets us begin with the box. The front shows it in all it’s swooshing glory. http://tdy.org.uk/images/7658-02.jpg The back shows some of the many features of the set and also others you might like to buy in the Star Wars range. After opening the box we find a single instruction booklet Now we come to an important aspect of any Star Wars set the figure, here we’re provided with an anomalous rebel pilot and his faithful R5 droid. The pilot comes with the fairly standard Lego Star Wars non-hero helmet printing. What’s he going to do with the blaster taken on the entire Empire? One of the more interesting parts is the assembly of the engine, which if like me you don’t pay enough attention to the instructions when building you can end up getting wrong. The key detail I got wrong. Just before fitting the last engine. If we look carefully on the side we can see a missile launcher. I didn’t think torpedoes or concussion missiles were fired from there but I may be wrong. After fitting the engine the models looks like this. In all it’s glory. Manning one of the Alliance’s fighters. Not so ready to take on the empire was he? So overall we have a well designed model, which is in my opinion far superior to the original we were offered with Darth Vader way back when Lego Star Wars was new. This Y-wing is sleek and looks great in my opinion, the firing missiles are also a great touch. The Rating System Figures: 5/10 (for the same price the last X-wing had far more figures) Parts 6/10 Swooshability 9.5/10 Design 9/10 Price 3/10 Grand Total 32.5/50 Not to shabby. Conclusion. So finally the answers to the questions you’ve no doubt want to know is the set worth the price. I’ll be frank £39.99 is too much for this set. Despite this I currently have a squadron of three Y-wings, the reasons is this set has been on sale a number of times at £30 it’s certainly worth the money. Lego recently placed them online with a price of £20, this I think was a great price for the set and well work picking one or more up if you wanted to start your own rebellion.	neutral
Thanks for the review. I'll add it to the index. The Y-wing is one of my favourite Rebel fighters and this set justifies the coolest fighter	positive
A wonderful set and a really charming design, well detailed and pretty smooth at the same time. Perhaps that small gap at the cockpit´s an a little weak point, but we can always MOD a little. Thanks for that very neat review, Cardinal Brick!	positive

I've built the Y-Wing and the Imperial Landing Craft (7659) more or less at the same time and, for about the same prices, I think the Imperial Landing Craft (ILC) is much superior to the Y-Wing. The Y-Wing doesn’t have much functionality besides an awkward dropping bomb device and a moving cannon. The missiles firing system is … your fingers. The ILC has an awesome missiles firing system (I wish I could get it individually for MOCs), a clever bomb dropping mechanism, 5 minifigures with weapons, the wings fold up together and the “cargo” can be detached as a play set. I’ve built the ILC first so I got quite disappointed with the Y-Wing.	neutral
I like the model, it is one of the best rebel sets out there. But I don't like it that there is no landing gear. When you set this one on the floor/ your rebel base it looks like it crashed or something and looses its look of superiority actually quite fast. It needs to be at least 2 studs high, if not more, from the ground. TLC is in these days afraid of flimsy landing gear, as they gave to us in the early SW time. Now they want something sturdy for playability. But I think there should have been some details on the bottom, especially a landing gear that unfolds. I also don't like the mistake of TLC (that they changed this year with the release of Indy hopefully) to give the pilot a usual smile face. The old yellow version of Gold Leader even had a headgear. I hope TLC realised this year that we want more detailed faces. Well, the licenced sets we got proved that, but who knows. The upsides of this set are the amount of pieces and detail, especially the engines were fun to build and perhaps the most interesting construction I have seen in years. Also it is big, bulky and looks sleek at the same time, just wonderful. And next to the 4502 X-Wing it looks in the perfect size! I gave this the highest rating, even if the underside disappoints.

I came here to look at the review even though it is a few years old. No images to go with the review. Bummer. I'd like to see a more friendly tolerance on dated threads being bumped. Again, we know next to nothing about the new Y-wing. It wouldn't be possible to say whether 7658 is worth the money relative to the new one until we know what the new one looks like, what its minifigures look like, how much it will cost, etc. Also, note that yodalikespie has been banned.	negative

Maybe the thread should be locked or taken down since the pics consist of broken links. Kind of a pointless review without the pics. And for the record, there are other websites with preliminary images of some the new 2012 sets that are not on the Eurobrick Star Wars 2012 rumors thread. Perhaps that banned fellow was hoping some of the Lego insiders had some knowledge about it. I guess we'll never know now. Edited by sharky, 22 September 2011 - 09:22 PM.	negative
And lo! It came from the east (Denmark) the set which had been foretold the cheap army builder and there was much rejoicing amongst the castle fans. The Cardinal then asked was all the rejoicing justified….. Set Name: The Knight Set Number: 5615 Number of Pieces: 21 Figures:1 Released: 2008 List Price: £2.00 Lets us begin with the box. The front shows us are knight and his rack of arms. The back shows us two sets from the Castle range. Moving inside the box now. The contents of the box, it doesn’t look like much. The instructions to help you through the build. Now the reason you probably bought the set, well at least why I did the Knight. This features the new torso for 2008 and is the height of fashion. This brings the number of printed torsos from the Crown Knights to three, which allows for a greater variety in building your armies. A new fashion sensation and all the must have accessories for this season. With a more heavily armoured look he’s ready for anything. The rest of the set is a weapons rack, I assume that once you’ve got a few of these set you’ll probably like me give up building them and part them out. But anyway here are some pictures of what the rest of the elements are spent on. A long and complex build begins. After 360 hour finally it’s finished sadly five minfigs were hurt in the construction of this rack. Now the money shot, where we can see it all come together. It looks great even the rack doesn’t look to bad. Sadly are hero wasn’t ready for other themes just yet. In total we have a good army builder which castle fans have wanted. However there remains a question in my mind as to if this set is good enough on it’s own. Without any other castle sets I can’t see it being to much fun so it’s not a good present. The Rating System Figures: 9/10 (Great new fashion for this season ) Parts 8/10 (Shield, sword, spear, helmet and armour what more could I want? Well two shields.) Fun Fun Fun 3/10 (Sadly it’s rather dull on it’s own I can’t think or to much else to do.) Design 7/10 (Yes it’s the army builder I’ve wanted design, well apart from that Pirate one.) Price 9/10 (At £2.00 what more can I say.) Grand Total 36/50 (Let down by being to small to stand alone..) Conclusion. So let’s answer the question, is it the army all castle fans have wanted? Well yes and no is the answer. While it is a great set and at the now reduced UK price of £2.00 amazing value. I still think it’s inferior compared with the army building capability of Cross Bow attack, I much prefer army building both factions at once.	positive
Thanks for sharing this review with us. I'll add it to the index. One of my favourite impulse sets along with the Troll Warrior (or is that Orc warrior)	positive
Nice review and I especially enjoyed the ending. I personally think it is quite a good set for the price considering it comes with a fully armed minifig along with enough stuff to suit up another. I just wish Amazon carried this set.	positive
Do we really need more construction works? Legoland is just one huge building site. Theme: City Set Name: Mini Digger Set Number: 7246 Number of Pieces: 36 Figures:1 Released: 2005 List Price: $3.50 (USD) 7426 Peeron.com 7246 Bricklink Catalog Diving right in let get some photos of the box The digger at work. The back just has more of the same not to inspiring. Once we open the box we find two poly bags and some instructions The total contents of the box, well minus the air Instruction booklet short and simple. Now the single minfig of the set, nothing new of special that I can see. …got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company. Moving onto the digger itself, it’s one of those builds where all you really need is a quick glance at the instructions and off you go. Side view of the finished product. Alternative view, it doesn’t look to bad. Now lets add our construction worker. Looks rather good, though the lifting action isn’t smooth. It’s nothing special, it’s not the greatest construction set that Lego have ever produced but I think it is worth the money. The arm action really does bug me though. The Rating System Figures: 5/10 (Just another construction peon.) Parts 4/10 (Nothing novel and I dislike the new digger arm system.) Fun Fun Fun 7/10 (I think the playability is high and you can get a good load of bricks in the bucket.) Design 6/10 (Not the best designed digger but not the worst.) Price 7/10 (A reasonable price for what you get) Grand Total 29/50 Still halfway decent but nothing to write home about Conclusion. This set is yet another in a long line of Lego digger and to be honest it’s not the best in my opinion. I still hold nostalgic memories for 6504 which I still think is a great digger. From my point of view the set sits to high off the ground and make me wonder how the worker gets in. I really don’t like the digging arm action it will never be smooth and while it poses better I just think it’s inferior. Despite this I still think it’s not a bad set, I’d just like it to be so much more.	negative
Another fine review! I love the last (action) picture. Thanks for sharing! Btw, I am so looking forward to that 384 London Bus review.	positive
Thanks for the review, ~VBBN~. I have to say, EF has never really caught my attention, but this set seems alright. To be honest, when I saw the topic title, I was expecting a tiger- looking mech. The mech itself is cool, except for the huge leg pieces. I think the minifigs are great in EF sets, with the dark colored outfits, like dark red or dark green.	positive
Thanks for that good review, ~VBBN~. That´s really a fine and pretty solid looking mecha. I think that the designers did a good job on this last wave of EF sets, and the inclusion of these mini robots was also a pretty smart idea!	positive
Nice to see a well done review. This set is one of the few Exo-Force sets I haven't built myself yet, but I will get it on sale, guess soon. I'm do not like the use of Slizer-style ball-joints in Exo-Force, even though they are modified to 2x2 bricks. In this particular set I think the arms look weak, and they lack elbow joint like the "green 2008 mech" set. (forgot name of this years green mech). Quite a shame, I find it really hurts the functionality of that "green" set and could imagine the same with the "Tiger". I guess with the new pyramide brick as cockpit, the cockpit is still open from the sides and the back. I modified my "green 2008 mech", which use the same cockpit design, with a few green bricks, and it is now completely closed from all sides. I rate the Tiger at average, but I may change my mind when I get to build it myself. Front	positive
Since my last post I've had the chance to build the Tiger, and I was surprised in a good way. A much better set than I actually thougth. Front	positive
I just bought 2 of them since they were 5$ each from lego. I really wish they did not cancel this series.	positive
I voted "average". I think this is the least attractive among the 2008 Exo-Force sets. I saved my money to buy some of the 2006 Mechas.	negative
Best Impulse set so far. Thanks for sharing your thoughts and yes, someone should look into that rodent issue. I'll add this to the index within long	positive
Good review. I got 2 of those. Wheels are very useful, especially if you don't have any :) As for shields - I don't imagine trolls use them too much. I think that they fight berserk style - all out assault. One complaint is the piece that the wheels are attached to - its a single piece, with smaller than the standard pin connection. So you cant change the width of the cart for your MOCs using the wheels. I don't know if a piece with such a connection only on one side exists though ....	positive
Thanks for the interview, i nearly forgot this set is out yet. Maybe i'll grab one off my local store tomorrow.	neutral
wait a second, a "troll"?? Isn't that an orc? I thought that this is a troll:	neutral
Wow. I like this set. But have no money to get it. Guess I need to be fast and get it before it was sold out.	positive
Nikola Bathory, on Aug 28 2008, 11:47 PM, said: wait a second, a "troll"?? Isn't that an orc? I thought that this is a troll: Those are Giant Trolls. The regular sized green guys (such as is included with this set) are Trolls. Yes, they look like Orcs but LEGO calls them Trolls.	neutral
I'm not really impressed by this set as much as other impulse sets. The Knight impulse set #5615 offers more in my opinion since it gives two helmets, two weapons, a shield and an armor piece along with the weapon rack. I'm not a fan in the slightest of flickfire missles and projectiles like on the cart, and the previously mentioned one piece axle limits the wheel usage in other MOCs. I would've liked to see an added chest armor piece at the very least and a shield would've made this great. Those things are so rare and it would've bumped the piece count up to 21 to match the Knight set. Since both are showing the same price on S@H(in US dollars at least), it would've made sense.	negative
Thank you for the nice review. The set is not that bad, but a shield would be a nice addition. I also don't like the flickfire missile. A camp site with a fire and a chickenleg would also be nice about the rat; Isn't it just foodsupply for the troll? The only problem would than be that the food is running away.	negative
More firefighter, there must be a pyromaniac in Legoland somewhere! Theme: City Set Name: Firefighter Set Number: 5613 Number of Pieces: 25 Figures:1 Released: 2008 List Price: £2.00 (GBP) $3.50 (USD) 2.99 (EURO) 5613 Peeron.com 5613 Bricklink Catalog 5613 Shop At Home Starting as always with the box I didn’t know red cylinders were flammable. Interestingly an action shot and not other sets you might like to buy. The contents of the box. Looks much like every other impulse set. Firefighter, not sure there’s much else to say apart from I wish they’d included breathing equipment. Looking pretty pleased with himself if you ask me. The equipment rack is fairly standard and easy to build, it does however include a fire hydrant. Inbuild shot, will I be able to finish this complex build.[/. Unsurprisingly I did. I nice selection of kit is provided. All together, I think the fire is a bit odd but it does add playability. If you want to increase the number of your firefighter and their equipment this is a great way, though there is something missing in my mind. The Rating System Figures: 5/10 (Fairly standard I already have a fair few) Parts 6/10 (Good selection of tools, but lacks the breathing apparatus I’d expect in a set like this) Fun Fun Fun 5/10 (There’s clearly something to do even if you just own this set.) Design 5/10 (Not going to win any awards but it’s robust) Price 8/10 (Nothing to complain about, you get a lot of accessories for the price.) Grand Total 29/50 (Reasonable design and good accessories a good set to improve any fire department.) Conclusion. This isn’t a set I’d necessarily buy, but while I was at Bluewater today I decided I should try to review every impulse set myself, so that why I bought it. Still I think it has some good playability and a good set of accessories if you need more firefighting kit, I just can’t get passed the lack of breaking apparatus, that would have made it a better set in my view.	negative

Brick built robot, surely we?€™re getting near classic space now? Theme: Space, Mission Mars Set Name: Mini-Robot Set Number: 5616 Number of Pieces: 24 Figures:1 Released: 2008 List Price: £2.50 (GBP) $3.50 (USD) 2.99 (EURO) 5616 Peeron.com 5616 Bricklink Catalog 5616 Shop At Home Let look at the box first. Space man approaching the robot from behind. I?€™m not sure you can still buy the base easily anymore. The contents of the box. The contents of the box, it?€™s rather white. Fairly standard Mission Mars spaceman, he?€™s got printing front and back but sadly no air tank! How does he breath? *As has been pointed out he does have a printed tank but I'd rather a physical one* Note the megaphone is in flashlight mode not weapon mode, that?€™s important.. The robot itself feels a bit clumsy the metal detector is never going to touch the ground and it feel a bit wide. I don?€™t like the look of him something in the eyes. The reason why so we can have a box to put crystals in. Both together and ready to explore new worlds etc. Sadly the robot was homicidal, remember in space no one can hear you scream. It?€™s not a bad impulse set and if it marks the return of brick built robots to Space then it?€™s a good thing. I just feel the robot could have been better built. The Rating System Figures: 6/10 (Not to bad but nothing wonderful) Parts 6/10 (Lots of white and not much orange, but where?€™s the air tank!) Fun Fun Fun 6/10 (Probably the best impulse set as a stand alon toy lots to do with a robot and his human boss) Design 5/10 (The robot feels clumsily put together I think it needs work) Price 8/10 (Can?€™t fault the impulse price.) Grand Total 31/50 (Not well designed but does have more play value than other impulse sets.) Conclusion. I was surprised that Mission Mars got impulse sets as it didn?€™t seem to sell as well as other lines last year. However I think this is a fairly good set, it has more playability than other sets and does come with a metal detector been a while since I?€™ve seen one (though I could be wrong) sadly the robot isn?€™t as good as it could be.

I wasn't all that impressed with what you get in this set for the price. But you have an interesting point; that the robot can be considered a reference to the Classic Space bots. Makes me think I ought to try modding the robot later...	negative

The default model isn't that great but you get a few nice wing plates to work with (after rearranging it looks pretty good). I guess this one though, is good for some nice parts, tho its pretty limited in what you can rebuild it into, and it seems less value because the astronaut has no vehicle... Best impulse set has to be the Troll Warrior... feels very 'complete', and Space Orcs are always nice to have...	positive
This here was a set that I new I had to get. A beautiful minfig, amazing minfigs, what more could you want? So was this set worth it? I guess you will just have to read the review to find out! Set name: The Batcycle: Harley Quinn's Hammer Truck Number: 7886 Pieces: 267 Theme: Batman Year: 2008 Price: 35.00 USD, 44.96 EURO 1/Box The new box art for batman is pretty stunning. It's clean, and really sells the set. For this set, Harley Quinn's truck is pictured attacking Batman, with the set information. The back of the box shows a nice little comic, the other sets, as well as the set functions. 2/Contents The instructions: The instructions for the set are, as always, clear and straightforward. They display the colors well, and have what we expect in an instruction book. 3/Build Minifigs: The stars of the set! Batman is back with a new torso, much more metalic than before. Harley had all new printed torso, legs, a new head, and that sweet new hat. Batcycle: The bottom part is very sturdy thanks to a small bit of Technic. The red throws it off a bit, but it isn't seen once the top part is put on. It has a nice use of the smoke stacks, and looks very nice in the end. The top part is simple, but suits the purpose well. It has handle bars, and a nice motor. The blue is a little strange though. Hammer Truck: The hammer truck begins with a very sturdy base. It has lots of detail, and really looks cool. Rims Added: Lego did a very nice job at giving it a checker board appearence. The only problem here is that you stick a sticker over two bricks, multiple times. Jewels: Inside of the crate are these shining jewels. Look how they illuminate the darkness in Gotham... More Added: Then, we add on a spoiler and the crate. Looking very nice now. The detail is again, outstanding, and It has a good amount of smoothness to it. The infamous Hammer! Okay, I haven't said this yet, but the square pieces need to stop. First on those SW backta tanks, now on the hammer? It creates a sloppy look for the hammer. Still, this is the ultimate wacking weapon. Added to the truck: On the truck it works pretty well. But the handle is to short, and it's near impossible to smash Batman. The finished truck: The finished truck is really nice. The big wheels give it the monster truck feel, and the way that Lego alternated the colors works well. The cockpit is a little palin, but that's not a major issue. The "I love Joker" sticker is one of the best stickers I've seen. It's simply a classic. The finished set: ---------------------------- Parts: 9/10 (Lot's of good mocing pieces, and red and black are always usefull.) Minifigs: 10/10 (Awesome!) Playability: 9/10 (the hammer is a little short) Price-per-part: 8/10 (It's a liscensed theme, so meh.) Set 7886 is a very nice set, and has some great details in it. The minifigs are very cool as well. However, their are some flaws. First, the hammer is two short, and is kind of square. The Batcycle has a few awkward colors in it, which throws it off a bit. This set is definatly worth the money. Batman fans will love it. And also wacking fans will like it, for that hammer... And if you would like to buy this set, Here are a few useful links: S@H link Peeron link Please let me know your comments. And pic requests and questions are welcome!	positive

Cues the Indy theme song Let's follow Indy on his pursuit on the stolen ark. Indy rides full speed ahead on his white horse, but the Nazis are pulling away! Will Indiana Jones be able to grab on to the truck and reclaim the treasure? Or will the Nazis and their high-powered Mercedes trucks prevail? Let's find out! 7622 Race for the Stolen Treasure Set Info Set Name: 7622 Race for the Stolen Treasure Theme: Indiana Jones Released: 2008 Price: 29.99 USD 34.95 Euro 24.99 GBP Pieces: 272 Minifigs: 4 Price Per Piece: About 11 cents And now, the main event! First, the box shots The front shows a nice image of Indy on his horse, trying to make it on to the truck, and the attack truck taking aim. The back This side shows some of the features of the set, in little pictures on the left. Instruction manual Not much to say here, as it's the same picture as on the box. Inside the manual On one of the last pages we have a nice picture like the one on the back of the box, showing some features of the set. Random manual pic Here we have the nice piece call-outs that we have come to expect lately. The bags were numbered as well. The pieces A nice selection here, especially if you like black, dark bley and bley. "Cool" pieces The golden treasure chest has a really nice sparkle to it. The set also has a good assortment of coins and jewels, and some wonderful silver 1x1 dots. The canvas covering This is quite nice. It has a nice dark tan color, and some nice detail on it as well. The minifigs First comes Indy's beautiful white horse. I always like LEGO animals and this one is no exception. Here are the figs On the left Indiana Jones, and his nice stubble, printed legs, side bag and the best LEGO hat in history. And the Nazis, Peter, Hans, and Klaus. Their torsos are very nice and the hats are amazing. They look really nice with all of their tan. The extra parts Here you get two of the nice silver 1x1s, some clear 1x1s, and the usual technic pins and levers. Now the finished set! First we have the attack truck The truck looks very good. It looks very military like with the colors and the design. It is designed wonderfully with really nice mudguards and a well-detailed front. The only fault of this is I think the top part where the gunner stands is a bit bare. The front Here you can see the front, which has a nice smooth look with some nice details as well. The front ridged piece works well here. The gun This is well made. It is built by attaching a lightsaber hilt in a sort of videocamera piece. The actual area where the guy stands is pretty bare, but not too bad. Backside of the truck The spare tire here is a simple, but nice touch. A side view The mudguards are smartly built by clipping wing flaps on to handle plates. This part gets a bit tedious, but the end result is worth it. The big boy cargo truck! This is another really well built truck. It has a lot of the same design elements as in the smaller truck, such as the mudguards. Front view The front of this truck is as nice or better than the other truck. It uses good SNOT building, and everything fits in well. A close-up view of the tire area Just behind the tire you can see those silver 1x1s being used as the suspension. This is a really nice addition and it looks great. NOTE: It's only visual suspension. It is not supposed to work. The canvas cover in action Now the canvas attaches by putting the holes in the canvas, on some little blue technic pins and then clamping them down with the hinged pieces. It looks really nice and curves nicely. The windscreen Treasure! My favorite piece in action. I took this picture with the flash on, so you can see how it sparkles. I think we have waited far too long for this great piece. The complete set! Everything all together. Indy is chasing fast! Indy's got it! Brickshelf Folder Now, for the ratings! Price: 9/10 (Not bad, but could have slightly more pieces. At least it has 4 minifigs and that makes up for it.) Parts: 9/10 (A nice selection of parts, lots of greys and black.) Design: 10/10 (The trucks are really well-designed, the mudguards are excellent.) Playability: 8/10 ( I always like rolling the trucks across the floor. ) Build: 9/10 (Pretty good, but gets a bit repetitive in some parts.) Overall: 45/50 Brickset Bricklink Entry Peeron Lego S@H Even after intense fighting, everyone always gets along when there's food to be eaten... "Hey Indy! Vant some mustard?" "How about some Ketchup?" Summary This, and all of the other Indiana Jones sets are some of my favorites. They all have nice colors, good design, and great minifigs. Although I need Indy in a different outfit pretty soon. His outfit is starting to smell a bit ripe . This set in particular is very well designed, and I can't wait for some more Indy next year. Thanks, and happy building! Edited by Erdbeereis1, 29 August 2008 - 03:47 AM.	positive

Nice review. I like this little set. Some how it reminds me now of "Postman Pat" in dutch "Pieter Post", an english childrens tv series about a postman in a little village somewhere in Yorkshire. Aah, sweet memories I would rather have seen a postoffice released (with some women minifigs) instead of the green post bigplane. But maybe in a couple of years.	positive

I don't hate the piece, but I did object to the way this set fills in the middle recessed area with a 2 x 2 plate that is nearly impossible to get out again without doing some damage to it. What's more, if you fill in the recessed area, you've eliminated the only rationale for using the car base in the first place.	negative
Welcome to another sunny day in LEGO city! The sun is shining, the birds are singing, minifigs are drowning.... Wait? What?! The Coast Guard rushes to the scene and deploys the Coast Guard 4WD & Jet Scooter to save the poor minifig from drowning. Let's take a look at the Coast Guard's buggy! 7737 Coast Guard 4WD & Jet Scooter Set Info Set Name: 7737 Coast Guard 4WD & Jet Scooter Theme: City-Coast Guard Released: 2008 Price: 9.99 USD-9.95 EUR-7.99 GBP Pieces: 130 Minifigs: 1 Price Per Piece: About 8 cents Now, the review! The Box Here is the front. It shows a nice image of the buggy on the beach with the ocean in the background. The Back The back shows some of the features in the set, such as the extra equipment. Manual The picture on the manual is the same as on the box as usual. The Parts The set has great colors. I love how the orange, blue and white look together. The part selection is quite good, but unfortunately uses the large car base. Coast Guard Minifig This is a great fig. The torso print is very nice and matches the buggy's colors well. New Tire Mold Here are the new tires. They look very good. In-Manual Shot Color separation is not a problem here, and since it is a small set, the piece call out is not a necessity. Extra Parts It is always nice to get extra cheese slopes. The Finished Set! The design of the trailer and jetski is great. The jetski is very smooth looking and the color scheme is fantastic. The sticker on the roof is nice, but it's actually too big for the piece. The corners of the sticker flap where the piece curves. Jetski Close-up Here you can see how it attaches to the trailer. I didn't add the sticker that goes on the front which is a little sign that says BB-03 or something. Attaching The Trailer This is where the trailer connects to the main car. It attaches simply with a ball joint. Car Front View The license plate is a nice sticker, and the top lights look nice. Say cheese driver! The Back The back is very similar to the front, it has the same sticker. The Equipment Rack A very welcome addition to the set. It adds quite a bit of playability. The orange fins are great. All Decked Out He looks pretty spiffy in his diving suit doesn't he? Brickshelf Folder The Ratings! Price: 10/10 (You can't get much more in here for $10) Parts: 9/10 (Nice selection and great colors. The big car base is a bit annoying) Design: 9/10 (The jetski is a prime example of something with a small amount of pieces that still looks amazing) Playability: 9/10 (You can drive the car, go diving, and jetski across the bay) Minifig: 7/10 (The one it comes with is great, but it could have come with one more. Perhaps a citizen of some sort) Build: 8/10 (Simple, but looks great) Overall: 42/50 LEGO S@H Brickset Peeron Bricklink Even in the face of danger, this member of the Coast Guard always has a smile on his face... Summary Simply put, for $10 you have to buy this set. It is one of the better sets in this price range you can buy, and one of the best small city sets. The colors are great, the design is great, and the fig is great. I don't normally think small sets are worth heavy praise, but this one definitely deserves it. Thanks, and happy building!	positive
Great job! I will want to get this set soon. It's a lovely set, with some coast guard saving on the jet ski. What I don't like about this set, is the lack of doors. Everything about this is nice, but I still have to give it a "4". As for the entire flow of review, I agreed with Brickster that your introduction is very good. With the little amends I had added earlier, it turns out to be very good. Keep it up.	positive
A very good review of an especially charming and lovely set, thanks! The whole CG theme looks very nice to me with a good and detailed set design, and this one´s no exception. Although it would be nice to see more car doors and some new MF faces, though.	positive
Thanks for this review. I was thinking of getting this set and having read your review went out today and got it. What a great little set. What I particularly like: Very sturdy build. Feels very solid as you build the pickup (compared to the Fire pickup & trailer I also have) The orange pieces (my first pieces in this colour!) The tyres which give the smoothest ride of any Lego Town/City vehicle I've ever built The raised suspension and side runners The Coast Guard dude (again a first for me) and his mega-cool flippers and aqualung The jetski controls - The handlebars actually move left to right which is a great detail Little details that Lego didn't have to do (the grey handle by the ball joint; moving handlebars; the new tyres) As you can probably guess, I have voted Outstanding for this set!

Thanls for the review, I was looking at this set last time I went to the Lego store, but in the end decided not to get it. Now you’ve made me really doubt my decision. One question though do you think the jet ski is as good as previous ones?	positive

Nice set, nice review, I already have one coastguard set (that truck) but I like the idea very much. However, the Rigid Inflatables could be much improved (see the real ones at www.rnli.co.uk or www.knrm.nl)	positive
The Coast Guard sets are very eye catching. The color scheme is making me want to pick up the entire line, although the off-shore platform hasn't been released State-side yet. I've had my eye on this particular set for a few weeks now and is near the top of my To Buy list. With instructions provided on LEGO.com, I build a Dr. Infero version of the jet ski to replace the one used in Mission 2: Swamp Raid. It's a very sturdy design, bulky enough to make it feel like a real vehicle. Great review, too. Thank-you for the closer look at the set.	positive
Arrgh me hearties! Let's join the Pirates as they try to steal the sacred treasure from the Islanders' hands. It won't be easy, King Kahuka and his loyal warriors closely guard the treasure 24 hours a day. Will the Pirates with their trusty pistols and cutlasses be able to defeat the Islanders' spears, pet alligator and powerful leafy skirts? We will find out! 6262 King Kahuka's Throne Set Info Set Name: 6262 King Kahuka's Throne Theme: Pirates-Islanders Released: 1994 Price: ??? (I don't know the original price. I got it from Bricklink with no box for $17. Unfortunately, I was not able to locate the Euro or Pounds price.) Pieces: 123 Minifigs: 5 Off we go! Unfortunately, I don't have the box because I didn't like the idea of spending over $50 for a set with under 200 pieces. So sorry, no box pics. Instructions I think the image on the front is very good. It seems less setup somehow than the instructions these days. It looks more like someone snuck up on them while they were going about their duties and snapped away rather than something that was planned. The Parts A nice selection here. There is a pretty good amount of printed pieces in this set which is always nice. For example, the zebra print tile, as well as the pirate flag nowadays would almost certainly be stickered. The set also comes with a nice dark grey BURP and a red boat for the Pirates. The Minifigs The main buying point of this set for me were the minifigs. This set comes with 5 of them which is quite good for a small set like this, especially when compared to the sets of today. The set comes with 1 alligator, 2 Pirates, 2 Islander Warriors and King Kahuka himself. I really like the Islanders' torso and leg prints. The leafy skirts are a nice touch and the make-up on the faces is superb. Some Parts I Liked These shields have a nice design on them and I always like the treasure chests. A Picture Inside The Manual This is a feature that I liked in the manual, it shows an overhead view of the baseplate so it's much easier to find where to put the piece. I certainly could have used this feature in last year's Aquabase Invasion set. A Close-Up Of The King The face print is nice. I wonder who Kahuka's make-up artist is.... The finished set! First, The Pirates' Boat The boat is really nice. The sail is made out of a nice cloth, and connects simply to the mast. And now, the main part of the set, the throne! This is a really nice model. I think the colors and the design make it really feel like a different part of the LEGO world. The rock sculpture looks fantastic as well. The throne, which is sort of a stretcher thing attaches here. It connects on a 1x2 tile with a stud in the middle for easy removal Here is the treasure that the Pirates seek The treasure rests on tiles inside of the rock. The zebra print tribal drum This is simple but nice. One thing that's great about this which I mentioned earlier, is that this and all of the other pieces with designs on them are printed. That's right, no stickers to be found here! I have used these zebra-print tiles many times for MOCs, as they make a great exotic detail piece. The lovely rock head I think this is wonderful. It really adds a lot to the set. It is well built with grey slopes, curved pieces for the mouth and nose, headlight bricks for the eyes and feathers and horns for detail. The backside The complete set! Overall, this looks great in my opinion with great landscaping and some fun parts. Well, it looks like the Pirates walked all over the Islanders and stole their treasure... In fact, it looks like it was pretty brutal. Brickshelf Folder Now, for the the ratings! Price: 8/10 (for $17 not a great price per piece value. But when you add 5 figs in, it makes it a decent price. Plus this set hasn't been in stores for 14 years so that adds some cost) Parts: 9/10 (The set has some really nice printed parts, as well as a baseplate, which in my opinion, is great) Design: 9/10: (No flaws that I can think of right away. The rock face is very well built) Playability: 8/10 (Not really anything to play with, although you can sail the ship and steal the treasure) Build: 9/10 (Rock face uses nice techniques and the rest of the set is simple but looks good) Minifigs: 10/10 (The minifigs are just fantastic. Great prints, and just overall fun. Overall: 53/60 Bricklink Entry Peeron Brickset It looks like the Pirates have picked up a new recruit from the island... Summary The older LEGO sets have a really different look to them than the new sets, and I think it's nice to have a mix of new and old. This is definitely a great set with a nice build and great minifigs. Add to this the great printed pieces and that old Pirate charm, and you get a very nice set that I can certainly recommend. Thanks, and happy building! Edited by Erdbeereis, 17 August 2009 - 02:39 AM.	positive
As I've already said somewhere on this forum, this is the largest Islander set I own and therefore my favourite. Thankyou for your great review. I picked mine up for only 5 pounds along with Crocodile Cage and King Kahuka, but I can't help you with the original price. I would search the web but I'm too tired right now...	positive
I feel the same way about the Islanders sets Brickster. They are a nice change from the regular pirate versus soldiers that is the norm. I think it would be interesting to see some new Islanders sets released in the new pirate line to see how TLC would make them.	neutral
What a wonderful review with smart (showing the right parts) and clear pictures. Fantastic job Erdbeereis1! This set is interesting for several reasons. First of all it contains a large amount of (very) useful minifigs. Not many sets of this size contain so much figs. Secondly, the throne itself can be easily combined with the other Islander sets or even with other pirate and non-pirate sets. I'm going to see if I can get this one for a reasonable price on eBay.	positive
Great review, well done for sure!! I love these reviews of old set, and this one is especially unique. I must agree with you the color scheme is magnificent. Makes me want to go to ebay and buy it now! To bad for Spongebob though, he got in with a real bad crowd...	positive
Thanks for the great review. This set is pretty standard as Islanders go, but it is such a cool subtheme that I don't care a bit. I totally agree with your comment about old and new sets. I don't think I would enjoy Lego as much if I didn't have a decent amount of kits from pre 1999.	negative
Another very nice review, and im glad to see it has some nice pieces as well as characters too. Looks to me that no one on BL has it in Australia for sale so I may pass on this beauty. Though I did pick up King Kahuka recently. He makes an appearance in my Medium entry	neutral
An outstanding set because who doesn't love islanders. Outstanding review as well.	positive
An outstanding set, too bad that I couldn't get this set set when it came out ...	positive
Very solid set. 5 minifigs and plenty of weapons to go around, adding up to great playability, what more could you want? (aspecially from a set this size) Only I would have liked another cutlass, a musket (instead of 1 of the pistols) and for 1 of the pirates to have another head, but those things are no big deal, it is still a lot better than sets nowadays.

Well, for some weird reason I missed this before, so I tell you now: very good review (as we are used of you, Erdbeereis1). I like all the Islander sets, and own quite a few myself! For people that don't own any of the Islander sets yet, the 6262 King Kahuka's Throne is a great way to start! Lots of minifigs and accessories!	positive
Well, this is a not so old set and i bet most of you already have it. So here is another review from me. As usual, let us start off with the box art. Box art: I like the box art. They put a nice background for the AT-AP. At the side we have the minifigs scale and at the back there is the function shown and advertisement for other set. The content: The content is consist of 6 packets of bricks and a instruction book. Yeap, no sticker sheet. Instruction book: The instruction books not only show us the steps but also show us all a clear pictures of the January release sets and some sets show with their function. Well, this includes the AT-AP functions as well. Besides, there are bricks checklist as well and the how do you start off before assemble your sets and a little poster where the clones with their AT-AP battling the Droids. Here's a random page. New pieces (to me): I never see both of this piece before so I assume it is a new pieces. Anyone have any idea is there any other sets that contains this piece? The blasters: We are given a 2 long blasters which is great. Which I it is more accurate as most of the Clone troopers use a long blaster. The minifigs: The minifigs is 2 Shock Trooper but is different with #7655 clone troopers battle packs's Shock Trooper. The leg is different in colour, we are given white hip while the one in the battle pack are given a black hip. Furthermore, we get a new printed headgear, which I think they have improve it, check out the mouth printing, the colour is brighter. So here is the headgear: The headgear limit itself from turning to the side this is because the front part it is too low until it block by the torso. The Shock Troopers: Without helmet on: We are given a black stud, no face printed. How I wish that I have extra. With helmet on: Comparison with Shock Troopers from Battle Pack: The AT-AP: Here's the AT-AP. It looks ugly at a certain angle and looks great in a certain angle. Anyway I still like the set. I like the walker vehicle. Below are the pictures taken randomly: Top view: Side view: Without stabilizer leg: With stabilizer leg: Rear view: The Functions: Well, the functions are not so impressive. Just something turning around, open here and there. The only function that is say as special is the retractable stabilizer leg. The cockpit: The cockpit can fit two Clone Troopers but too bad we are only given two and is not enough as there is no gunner on top. Inside it there is a guns holders, which can hold two guns but fall off easily when you are trying to remove the guns. Well the other side have some speedometre thing and a controller. To reveal the cockpit, you have to open the top hatch. Look below: so you can see what's inside: Oops, the side hatch and back hatch as well: Open and close: I think this pieces is use not to let you open the hatch but to make some design, I mean make it able to move inside. With Clones: Beneath: So this is the pieces that hold the stabilizer leg when is not in use. This is how the stabilizer leg move: At last~ And of course the revealing cockpit from below and at the back. Guess the droids have alternative way to take this things down faster. The leg: There are pieces blocking the leg to go to the front I mean overhead and lose balance. The base in not movable The side armor: The side armor has door and this is how it is attach. It is very flimsy, when you want to adjust it to be a little steep to creat the shape, they might just fall off. So it is connected to the body with just a technic pin. and to hold it properly, here is the support: The side hatch: It open and close easily, very loose, nothing to hold it tight. Here's some view when the side hatch is open. The cannon: The cannon on top is movable and adjustable. The big cannon can move up and down while the smaller one can cove sideways. But the smaller one tend to lose balance when it is without minifigs, means the one on top and below will not b align. This is the pieces that only enable it to move up and down. To prevent it from moving freely, LEGO put two pieces to block it. Completion: I try to make the sets looks great. I think this angle is right. Spare parts: It is so few compare with #7673 Magna Guard Starfighter and it is more expensive. Overall: This set is not really a good set. The hatch is quite flimsy, top and the side since there is nothing to hold them tight. Besides, it is lack of one clone. But to complete your walker collection, you must have it. Pros: -no sticker needed -new improved headgear -long balsters Cons: -lack of clone -flimsy -expensive as few pieces are given] Hope you guys like it.

I do not like the fact that the clones have pure white legs. It looks weird to me. It was also weird that they included Shock Troopers, but it was probably a way to get people to buy it. This set also seems like one of those that was kind of thrown in with a mix of other sets like the Tie Crawler. I never picked it up, and with the new Clone Wars sets out, I won't.	negative

Did anyone encounter the problem with the main turret? Apparently, the very tip of the piece (cone shape) can't be put onto the "pole" piece. I check the instructions 2 times and still can't find what i'm doing wrong. Is it just me or did anyone else got this problem as well?	neutral

I seem to recall having a problem with the largest turret as well. I forget how the instructions look though, but the bar not fitting in the cone sounds familiar. I just checked mine and what I did was I took the red bar and stuck it into the round piece with the fins and then attached the cone to the stud on top of the round part. Worked fine for me.

I could have gotten this set if I wanted to but it seemed like a waste of money to me. I don't like the shock troopers helmets that much. I feel they should have printed visors instead of cut out ones like they have in my opinion it would make it look a lot better. The AT AP itself sounds like it has a lot of holes in its cockpit which drags the set down and make it seem like they haven't exactly put a lot of effort into it. Great review!	negative
Wow talk about a bumper! Nice Review baby! This set is quite nice, I would have goten it if I had had the money but didn't back then so didn't get it. It has a nice parts selection! Why did Lego do the shock troopers with White hips? And the BP ones have Black hips. Confusers me. CommanderFox	positive
I did enjoy it Thanks for sharing your thoughts in this set and reviewing it. I'll add it to the index. Maybe you should consider joining the Reviewers Academy and rule the Galaxy (or something )	positive

Valentin, nice review! I was thinking of doing this review, and realised there were 3 reviews being done for this lovely set.

Alakazam! The good wizard is the wisest minifig in all of LEGOland. He is a master of the wand and can see the future. With these abilities, he helps the knights predict where the Trolls will strike next. Because this set is not in stores in the U.S., I was luckily able to buy this set on my vacation to Germany. It is interesting that it is a Euro exclusive. 5614 The Good Wizard Set Info Set Name: 5614 The Good Wizard Theme: Castle Released: 2008 Price: EUR 2.95-GBP 1.99 Pieces: 16 Minifigs: 1 The Review Unfortunately I don't have the box, because in got smushed in my suitcase on the plane, so needless to say, it was not in top condition... The Manual The manual is an extremely small fold-out. But the image on the front is nice. On the back of the manual, there is a picture of some of the 2008 impulse sets. This is a nice feature. The Parts For an impulse set this has a pretty good selection. A very nice owl, and an interesting clear ball piece. All built This set took me forever to build. I had to take numerous breaks as it was the toughest, longest build I have ever faced! For an impulse set, this actually looks pretty good. The owl perch is nice, also the crystal ball table. The wizard is a very nice fig, with great printing on the legs and hat, and I love his beard. Brickshelf Gallery The Ratings Price: 8/10 (Not bad, but I feel that impulse sets are slightly overpriced) Parts: 7/10 (Impulse sets are focused around the minifig, but the parts in this set are pretty good) Design: 7/10 (The crystal ball is a good idea, and the owl perch is simple but nice) Playability: 6/10 (There is not much to play with here) Build: 8/10 (As I said before, it took forever. Really it took all of 1 minute) Minifig: 10/10 (The wizard is fantastic) Overall: 46/60 Bricklink LEGO S@H Brickset Abracadabra, blades of four... You are now a dinosaur! Summary For an impulse set, this is very nice. The wizard is an excellent fig, and getting an animal in a cheap set is always great. I would definitely recommend this set. Thanks, and happy building!	neutral
Good review for a simple set. While it does come with the basics for an impulse set, I just feel that it lacks something though I am not sure what. Perhaps a printed magic scroll? I am still not a fan of the printed cap (especially the stars), but I do like the printed pants displaying his various goodies hanging from his belt. The plain torso is to be expected from a wizard minifig I suppose. Overall, it's not a bad set but it certainly feels to be lacking something, IMO.	neutral
Thanks for the review. I love this impulse set, I bought two of them so I could make a Wizard and his apprentice. I didn't have an owl either so an extra is pretty cool, and I like the trans globe piece. Batbrick Away!	positive
Kudos on a well presented and written review. I think the reason this set didn't release in US was because it didn't have any warnings about choking anywhere on the box, therefore no lawsuits in US for LEGO. Cheers ISC	neutral

I'm sure you'll get this set eventually. As for the box, well, there's always been 2 box-designs - one for the US and one for EU (actually there's an Asian one as well). The EU doesn't have the box count or the don't swallow (we know that). The US version has the brick count and don't swallow warning (typical US). Thanks for a super review strawberry-ice-man. I like the wizard, I'm only sorry they put him in an impulse set. Who'd want an army of medium blue wizards? So it's the worst army builder, but a cool wizard. Does that make sense?	neutral
The next in my attempt to review every impulse set single handed Theme: Space, Mission Mars Set Name: Alien Jet Set Number: 5617 Number of Pieces: 21 Figures:1 Released: 2008 List Price: £1.99 (GBP) $3.50 (USD) 2.99 (EURO) 5617 Peeron.com 5617 Bricklink Catalog 5617 Shop At Home As always we begin outside of the box It looks rather exciting at first glance. Set that cost a lot more than this one. Now for what?€™s inside. The contents of the box, the impulse sets never look that inspiring. Now for the alien, I have to say I?€™m not impressed. I?€™m not a big space fan and I only bought this due to my impulse review challenge, but as the main point of the impulse sets is the alien is a little hard to build a good set round something with one point or articulation. It lacks what make Lego minfigs so great their articulation. Now for the space vehicle, as always with impulse a short and easy build ensues. Took maybe 2 mins at the most. Time to mount the alien in his craft. The craft looks a little wide for him. Slightly better from this angle but still not winning any awards. I?€™m disappointed of the impulse sets I?€™ve reviewed so far this is clearly the weakest of them, but what really disappointing is the other seem so good and useful. The Rating System Figures: 3/10 (The alien is not a good minfig) Parts 6/10 (Some interesting parts but nothing that special.) Fun Fun Fun 2/10 (I can?€™t think of anything to do with this set to be honest.) Design 4/10 (Poorly designed the box makes it look much better.) Price 6/10 (Despite the impulse price tag I?€™m still unhappy about the price.) Grand Total 21/50 (Less than half marks the lowest I?€™ve given so far.) Conclusion. In many ways I?€™m annoyed, from the outside of the box this set looks quite interesting and certainly appears to be well designed. The idea of a small alien fighter/flying craft is in my opinion a good one, but sadly when you?€™ve got the finished product in your hand it looks nothing like the box art. While I think Mission Mars had some interesting sets and I might still get some of them this one will not be a repeat purchase for me.	negative
Well set out review with alot of great content! Gotta ask you though, how does the set look nothing like the box art? With so few pieces I'd have thought one could mentally put it together given the box front.	neutral
I’m not a great communicator but what I was trying to say was that on the box the sets looks quite exciting and well made and that the Alien fits much more snugly than it does. So I was a bit disappointed that it seemed wider and less compact and certainly less exciting when I opened it,	negative
Worst set of the year? Worst set of all time? The pictures say it all, no ratings necessary. A waste of paper for box and instructions, and waste of plastic for bag and jelly alien. The little alien ship that comes with the Switch Fighter beats this one hands down, as well as any other LEGO spaceship I have ever seen and I have seen many. Thankfully this set isn't available in my country, which is something I never thought I would say. Anyway, I hope TLG makes these awful jelly aliens disappear forever after this year.	negative
Thanks for this review. As for the set? Well, I am not to crazy about this set, But I want some sort of small alien fleet vehicals, and this would work well. But I would rather ave my money to buy classic town. Edited by ~VBBN~, 01 September 2008 - 02:48 AM.	negative
To be honest, I am going to give this set a "1"... That is my lowest rating I will ever give to a set in Eurobricks. In fact, this is the only impulse set which I do not have it at all. After looking at your wonderful review, I am going to give it a "2" and actually consider it to buy at least one to complete the entire impulse set series. I don't really like the design and the alien at all. In fact, I prefer the Mars Mission astronaunt more than the aliens. I don't really like the set but I like your review.	negative
I already don't liked the aliens, but if the fighter was better I would already bought him. Now I will maybe buy one of it just for the 2 limegreen pieces.	negative
Impluse sets are made good by using parts well and minifigs. This has either. I give a low score. I really dislike the alien figs. Worst Lego fig ever.	negative
Sets we miss include minfig sets like this one?€? Theme: Space Set Name: Space Mini-figs Set Number: 6703 Number of Pieces: 30 Figures: 6 Released: 1988 List Price: ? (unknown) 6703 Peeron.com 6703 Bricklink Catalog Lets begin by admiring the outside of the box. Wow 6 figs and all equipped, I was four more of these. We don?€™t get instructions so the back show how to put the figs together. Now for the men themselves. The complete line up, of all six figs, it seems strange half are in black. A closer look at our four Futrons. A look at the Blacktrons looking like nice guys with their visors raised. Time for a closer look at the range of tool these good men received from the Lego Company. Yep one accessory per person. The question is what could you do with this set, I mean it?€™s just spacemen in a line? Do you see the man who mugged you ma?€™am?. A good set from an age when we could look forward to every few years a new set of minfigs and just a box of them The Rating System Figures: 10/10 (An excellent selection for the time) Parts 4/10 (Good accessories but nothing else.) Fun Fun Fun 7/10 (I can see lots of opportunity for fun with this set..) Design 8/10 (Well it?€™s not really designed much but it?€™s a great idea.) Price ?/10 (Unknown at this time though mine was from Woolworths!) Grand Total 29/40 (A good mark for a great set.) Conclusion. Until the Castle Battle Packs came out this year we?€™ve been suffering from a lack of minfig based sets, and from this review I think you can see why. For many of us and I include myself here Lego minifig are one of the best parts of the hobby and sets like these allowed you to build up a much larger number of figs. Lego did well with this set a nice range of figure and also a good selection of accessor	positive

That's probably enough for now Seriously, I love all the sets of minifigs from all the different themes and this is a great one. I always wanted them when I was a kid but never did. My focus always was on Town sets (petrol stations and police sets please stand up) and there was never enough pocket money left over for space. Sigh! You are so lucky to have this great set!

7670: Hailfire Tank and Spider Droid Number of Pieces: 249 Number of Minifigs: 4 Price: 19.99 USD/ 25.99 EUR/ 19.99 GBP Brickset Hello everyone, today I will review the extremely underrated Hailfire Tank and Spider Droid set. I hope this review does it justice. So, let's start with the box: NOTE: This picture is not mine. Standard box for Star Wars in that time. The background on the box looks like it's from Geonosis, indicating that this set is from Episode II, and not III or the Clone Wars. The back of the box (not shown) shows the playability functions and some other sets that were released at the same time as this. Overview Here is an overview of the whole set. It comes with one construction manual and no sticker sheets ( ). This is a very simple set, but with not much to it, it is still a very important part of the CIS army, especially if you are interested in army building. I like to call this set a "super battle pack", and you'll find out why soon. Let's get right to it, and look at the feature of the set: the Hailfire Tank. Front A front view of the very cool tank. Here you can see two triangular shields on the hull. The main body is very simple, but altogether very effective and clever, and making it really look like a hailfire tank, although a little bit sized down from it's movie version. The trans-red stud used as the "eye" makes the tank look more menacing. Side The side view. The wheels are very easy to make, but it's a real pain to connect all of those chain links together. I don't see what you could use the links for, except for another tank, but maybe someone creative will find something for these. The dark tan is nice though. The wheels are held on by Technic poles, and the tank rolls on the wheels fairly well on carpet or a hard surface. Back This is the back of the tank. Here you can see eight flick-fire missiles (four on each side) of the new type, so they don't easily fall out. Also note the modified 2x2 with extended hole piece sticking out of the back. This may be used to easily push around the tank. I just wish you could fit a droid in the body for the cockpit... Now we move on to the Spider Droid, or what I like to call "The Dwarf Spider": The front. This one is also simple, but very cleverly built. The main body is two semi-spheres connected together for rotation, and an antenna, a cannon, four legs, and eyes made out of a useful telephone piece. The picture speaks for itself as far as how the gun and eyes are built. Side A side view. You can now see the legs better, which are more sturdy then you would think. Each one is made out of two pearl bronze Exo-force robot arms, a useful bley handgun piece, and a dark bley battle droid body, all connected to the under body (a big knob-like piece). Back The back. Not much to say here. I like this spider droid because it is very sturdy, and the legs are easy to adjust. Finally, we look at the minifigs: There are four minifigs in this set, which is quite generous for a set of this size. It comes with a yellow battle droid commander (I really like this one), two battle droids, and a super battle droid. All three battle droids have the new blaster pistols and one twisted arm. That's about it for the review, so here is the FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, Very fun and easy, besides the chain links. Should take the seasoned builder less than 20 minutes. Playability: 7/10, the flick-fire missiles are fun, as well as just zooming around the tank. Could use some clones for a battle. Swooshability: 8/10, you can roll around the hailfire fairly well. Minifigs: 9/10, a generous amount of figs, and all are pretty good. Design: 9.5/10, a really simple and clever set, although a little too small for the movie version. Price: 10/10, a very fair price considering the price-per-parts ratio and the coolness of the set. Overall Score: 8.5/10, a very neat set to have, a great army builder, and great for display next to all of the other CIS sets. The price is fair, the figs are good, and the build is very clever. That's all for now, folks. Please feel free to give some feedback! Edited by JimButcher, 15 September 2008 - 03:08 AM.	positive
KimT, on Aug 30 2008, 04:21 PM, said: Thanks for sharing this review with us. I think this one of the sets. In Europe this thing is waaaay overpriced and thus makes it a crappy set. We pay nearly double the US price. So I rated it poor. Also because the figs included does not make it great. The Hailfire is well designed and looks great, but that's just about all there is worthy of a positive mentioning. Sorry. [on a side note: As a bronze-awarded student, where's the price in EUR and GBP? And where's the poll?] [Nevermind the poll, I've added that one for you ] Oh yes, I will add the other prices, and I was going to make a poll for it (I made one for the Homing Spider review), but you beat me to it. Thanks!	negative

Thanks for the review, JimButcher. I really like that set. It combines interesting and good design with some awesome cool parts and a neat amount of charm.	positive
This is a great set, I have 2 of them now, and I plan to get more. It is much better than the droid battle pack. For 10 bucks more, you get better battle droid arms and some canon "vehicles", good enough for me.	positive
Thanks for the review. Is a great one. This set is not really a good set but i like the Spider Droid. The Hailfire Droid scale is not right, i think it is suppose to be even bigger. anyway, this is the first set that re-release the Commander Droid. So i grab it.	negative
Thanks for the cool review JimButcher . Actually, I really like this set, it is small but very clever and even if the hailfire droid is undersized, what in the whole line is not under or oversized . The new spider droid is the best small build I have ever done in a set and the droid commander is pretty cool . I am happy with the set and I will get another with my comic-con exclusive .	positive
This is a must have set for AOTC fans and I really love the hailfire droid but it costs like $80 or more now that its discontinued.	neutral
I just bought this set the other day and I must admit that it gets a "Below Average" from me. The price is not corresponding with what you get. Which would be implied, had Jim added the EUR or GBP price in the info[hint hint ] The spider droid is flimsy at best. Making it stand or even move without tumbling over is hard. Also why the brown cylinders on the legs? Keep the colourscheme clean, please. The figs are fine, except that I dislike the clone headgear and the fact that the helmets now have holes in the sides, allowing the flesh head to show within = Goofy looking. I am soo replacing the clone heads with black ones. Great review of an acceptable set	negative
Thank you for that good review, JimButcher. I think that this is really a pretty interesting and original looking set. Maybe it´s not very stable, but it owns some special 'War Of The Worlds' charm for sure...	positive

mass-manufactured and designed to withstand extreme amounts of punishment... It's an Iron drone, and it's marching on its Sentry! Set data 7711: Sentry Year: 2006 Theme: Exo-Force Subtheme: Robots Pieces: 74 (+4 extra) <- both counting Hinge control stick and its base as two separate pieces Price: Euro 7 circa, MISB, including S/H, on eBay; RRP was Euro 5 circa / 5 USD. Probably 5 UKP. Building time: 20/25 minutes (10 minutes building, the rest of the time placing stickers!) More info: Brickset - Peeron Being 2006 my last dark year, I wasn't a big ExoForce fan but they were ok. I tought 2007 models were better, and still think 2008 models are the best. That basically means 1) It's a shame that there will be no more of this line and 2) this is my first 2006 model, yet I bought in in July 2008. Ok, let's do this one. Box front: box was battered due to Italian Post; they'll do their best to give Lego boxes a "war" outlook. Close-up: the Japanese katakana read "tokushu butai" -> special (military) force(s) Box back: amazing alternate model; some like it more than the original design. Box content: a small but capable sticker sheet, two bags and instructions. Sticker sheet: and they're numbered! Random instructions page: connecting legs to the body Instructions page - sticker detail: that's why they're numbered. Instructions page - parts inventory: does anybody check if they're all there before building? Surely not me. Loose pieces: nothing rare, I think; small Techinc parts come in different colours, as usual (you often don't see them when the model is complete, but sometimes you do) The Iron drone: "strong and durable" (and much better looking than those crappy MM jelly aliens) Building starts. The open cockpit - front and rear view Left leg - front and rear view; right leg is built of the same pieces. Left arm - with laser cannon The cannon - great use of the hollow studs with the "Plant Tree Palm Top" Right arm - with twin missiles Complete model - front view Complete model - side view and rear view Rating and review. Parts and building: nothing new, but both models are O.K. Instead of waiting the last page of the manual, you'd better put the stickers in place while building. Looking at the box you'd tell stickers background is (trans) purple. It actually is trans clear (excpet for the yellow and black stripes - warning: hazard!). Try not to put your fingerprints on the sticky side! Consider using tweezers. Posability: both legs and both arms feature three joints; and that's good, so that the weight doesn't have the Sentry falling down. Final model: smaller compared to 2007 Claw Crusher and 2008 Batlle Arachnoid, but cheaper and surely worth the money. The "minifig" is just another Iron drone, not much to say. Final rating: 3,5/5 Edited by Sinner, 01 September 2008 - 02:22 AM.	neutral
Thanks for the review. I really do like the first year of EF. Nowadays they mecha are perhaps more cleverly designed, and use ball joints for playability. But I really love the blocky bulky look of the first Drone's machines. And somehow the older ones seem a better value of parts. I'm more inclined to buy duplicates of them than the newer models.	neutral
Thanks for the review. This is one of the few first wave sets that I didn't get. I'm not really sure why as it wasn't too expensive.	neutral
This is Polar-1, OVER... It's day 5 at Arctic Research Base 76. We are experiencing radio difficulties since discovering a number of strange radioactive arctic life forms which seem to be effecting our signal, OVER. We have encountered a large polar bear which by all account appears to be friendly and playful. Our food supply; however, has diminished quickly, and we have to venture North from the base to a frozen lake in search of fish. Our cordinates are currently 46Â°45â?²4â?³N, 741Â°21â?²7â?³W. We do plan to take the snowmobile to the lake after we get our provisions in order. This is Polar-1, OUT. Polar Explorer Bonus Pack Set #: 6569 Theme: Arctic Year Released: 2000 Piece Count: 76 Minifigs: 2 List Price: $10 (USD) In 2000, Lego introduced a new theme called Arctic. It was something completely new and different for Lego as no mini-fig scale sets and/or adventurers had ever ventured to the Arctic. The set offered new orange pieces and combined elements of blue and white pieces to provide a number of sleds, vehicles, a mobile outpost (6520), and even a large polar base (6575). The theme was unfortunately short lived and did not see 2001. This particular set is a "value pack" that combines sets 6578 (Polar Explorer) and 6586 (Polar Scout) at a reasonable price of $10 (USD). I may have even paid a few dollars less at a discount toy store back in the early 2000s. A picture of the "Bonus Pack" with the two sets combined within the box: The backside features an advertisement for the Lego Club and pictures of other Arctic sets: Starting with the smaller set, The Polar Explorer (just a tip of the iceberg ): Instructions Front of Box Back of Box Both sets include the same minifig, an Arctic fig with glasses and a thick arctic coat: Here's a shot of the fig with his hood on. I always thought the hood is a nice piece that would work well for Hoth Rebel snow scenes. The set includes a few nice accessories: The set actually creates a small ice/snow formation that can even be placed on water to represent an iceberg: Here's a close-up with the blue ice spider: The complete set: Next, the Polar Scout: Front of Box Back of Box The Polar Scout instructions picture the same image as the box: But I really like the real arctic imagery on the backside: The set includes a small sheet of decals: Included are some great arctic accessories: And some interesting arctic creatures, like this neon orange scorpion in a ball of ice: I love the polar bear, a great addition to snow scenes: But the best part of this set is the orange and black sled: The back sled attachment (U-Haul) has some tools and a removable storage cover: The top comes off easy to store tools and equipment: Here's the arctic fig with a great metal detector (or other snow research device): And the sled itself: Lastly, a picture of the complete Polar Scout: Final Thoughts: I'm a little disappointed that Arctic was a short-lived theme. At the time, I wasn't too interested in the Arctic, but I still regret not buying the large Polar Research Base after seeing it at a discounted price. I was able to pick up this set and the Mobile Outpost that I never opened. I'd be interesting in reading your thoughts in regard to this set and the Arctic Theme.	neutral
Thank you for that fine review, TheBrickster! I really like how this two small sets create an intense and adventurous atmosphere against the backdrop of a pretty exotic region. The sets´re well designed and very nice with a fine amount of rather unique and well fitting gear. The whole theme offers a lot of playability in a set-up that´s a little different to TLC´s standard sceneries for sure. And... it always reminded me of 'Who Goes There?', too...	positive
Hi! Great review on one of my favourite themes! I never realized how cool it was until just now, when you did your review. Anyways, I remember my one set of the arctict expedition, The Arctic Expedition pack	positive
A nice set review. As for the theme itself, I though it was a very interesting theme. Sadly I don’t think Lego put enough effort into it, I was personally upset not to se a second year even if I didn’t buy any of the sets. It reminds me of the artic theme Playmobil did at one point in the distant past to be honest. I think a number of good artic scenes were missed, when it came out a really wanted to get a ski plane but it never came, I built it myself in the end but I don’t know how Lego missed that one. On a slightly random note I do know that at least one Lego minifig did make it all the way to the real artic with a research team, sadly I don’t have any pictures to offer you.	negative
I find it amusing that the numbers on the decal (for the flag) were chosen so that it wouldn't look stupid if you put it on upside-down by accident.	neutral
46Â°45â?²4â?³N, 741Â°21â?²7â?³W??? Those are some wierd coordinates.	neutral
Nice review Brickster! The Arctic theme is very nice. The minifigs have a great look to them especially with the hoods. The colors for the Arctic sets I have always liked, and somehow the idea of minifigs exploring the arctic is fun to me.	positive
Thanks very much for this great review TheBrickster! I love the Arctic sub-theme, but unfortunately i never got my hands on any of the sets, since this theme had its time during my dark ages. This one is a really neat little set with a great amount of accesoires, especially these snow shoes and the backpack which i love	positive
Great review, I hope TLC does another. I rember reading a book once based on the theme which stated the scorpions and thespiders and such were aliens .	positive
Wasn't there some years back a film based on aliens in the arctic? Can't remember the name and i think it was really old, but there certainly was going on something with strange creatures and a polar base	neutral

You already know how I feel about the review. As for the set, I'm not entirely sure. It's a fine witch, but you've already gotten her in the Witch's Windship and a few other sets. I vote average on this. A good minifig (though one does not have the need for more than one witch) and some fine additional parts.	neutral
This is a very good review, no doubt about it. About this set, this is a cheap way to buy this set with a witch and some nifty accessories such as the black cat. In fact, I think this is the first time I had ever seen a black cat. It's simple, but not very useful in my collection. Because other Fright Knight sets also offer the witches too. I don't need many witches. Overall, I feel that this is an average set.	neutral
Yay, another Fright Knights review! Odd comic at the end. Skipper 24, on Sep 1 2008, 07:05 PM, said: Ever wanted to turn into a animal, wanted to curse your enemy or just wanted to be rich beyond your wildest dreams. You should go visit the Witch and her Fireplace. She can brew you up a potion for any occasion or purpose. So head down to see the Witch right now. Sounds like a song or nursery rhyme, somehow. Anyway, to the review, it is a great review, such a small set but you've summed it up well. This is one of the few unpromo Fright Knight sets I didn't get, sadly. Not 'sadly' because of Willa the Witch, I have about four of her, but the special cat, and the other bits (one can never have too many Lego bats). I voted the set outstanding, I think it is for its size. KimT, on Sep 1 2008, 08:16 PM, said: You already know how I feel about the review. Good or bad feelings?

Huzzah! The King has declared a royal tournament pitting the brave knight in his shining armour, against the feared skeleton warrior and his shadow horse. The jousting arena is set up so let the joust begin! 7009 The Final Joust Set Info Set Name: 7009 The Final Joust Theme: Castle Released: 2007 Price: USD 7.99-GBP 5.99-EUR 7.95 Pieces-62 Minifigs: 2 figs 2 horses Price Per Piece: About 13 cents Let the games begin! Box Shots The front has an image of the knight and skeleton jousting with lightning in the background. The Back show the two now fighting with an ax and ball and chain. I don't really like the box image, as I think the background looks too dark. Manual The front has the same picture as on the box. On the back some of the other 2007 castle sets are displayed. This is better than the usual sweepstakes image that we get. The Pieces Nothing really special here. But you at least get a good assortment of weapons. Shields I always like LEGO shields and these are no exception. The patterns are great. Minifigs First the horses. These are great, the knight's horse's coverings are really nice. Now, the minifigs. The knight and skeleton both have nice armor. The torsos are plain black for the skeleton and bley for the knight. The Finished Product In the middle is the jousting barrier which is simple, but serves its purpose. On the left we have the weapon rack which is good. It would have been nice if TLG had included a rack for the skeleton as well though. Extra Parts Only two extra white parts here. You can use them if your knight's horse wants to retire and look like a normal horse again. Oh! That has to hurt! It seems that the skellie has won this round! Poor knight... Brickshelf Folder Now, For The Ratings! Price: 7/10 (Not a very good price per piece ratio, however at least 2 figs and 2 horses are included) Parts: 7/10 (The shields and log bricks are nice, but most of the others are nothing spectacular) Design: 8/10 (Relatively well designed, but a bit boring) Playability: 8/10 (You can joust with it and that's about all) Build: 8/10 (Short and easy) Overall: 38/50 Brickset LEGO S@H Peeron Bricklink Strike! It seems that the horses have rebelled against their riders... Summary This set although not amazing, is still a very solid set. The minifigs are great and so are the horses, but the rest of the set kind of feels like an afterthought. Even with its negative aspects I still recommend it, especially if you are a Castle fan. Thanks, and happy building! P.S. If you want to see how I made this set a bit more fun, check out this Click	positive
Nice review. I can tell that you put some effort into it. The MOC is a nice design. Your reviews are getting better and better!	positive
Outstanding. This is (as many of the new Castle sets) a super set. You get loads of great parts, a horse barding, a black skeleton horse and for a fair price. I just love this set and I've bought quite a few of them to build my army. A "must have" - and your great review serves it well	positive
Review of 7670 Hailfire Droid and Spider Droid *Updated* Theme: SW Episode II / Clone Wars Parts: 249 (- figs) Figs: 4 Price: £20.00, $20.00, ?‚?25.99 Year: 2008 I think many people were deterred from this set because of the low piece count and a high price for it although it does come with 4 minfigures. 1. Overall set and figs Official box pic. This indicates it is a Geonosis set from the background but it is no different from any other set same old brown separatist ship/s. The whole set. Some red tan droids would have been nice like in the Geonosian fighter set. All the minifigs. The super battle droid body is slightly different to the one in the BP. It looks more grainy and silver. I doubt this has any relevance for it being a geonosis set but I like them better how they were in the BP's The Super Battle droid body dwarfing the commander droids body. I think that the new Commander droids body is better than the old one with just the yellow strip even though it is less accurate. New twisted Battle Droid arm, each droid has one of these. I don't really like having droids with these new guns I think the older guns suited them much better. 2. Hailfire Droid Hailfire droid by itself. It is certainly smaller than the original. Seeming as this is the main part of the set I was hoping it would be bigger but I don't mind it being this small too much. Wheels and rockets can fold outwards and inwards The wheels which spin round two large clear discs and made from loads of these tiny links. This is probably the best way to make the wheels on this small scale. The only other alternatives I can think of are using the tracks from the Wookiee Attack set or catterpilla tracks, both of which wouldn't look right. One of the missile pods. These use the new flick-fire missiles which don't fall out are an excellent idea. They should have come with the purple cones like on the Magna guards staffs instead of red though because in the film the missiles are purple. One of the new flickfire missiles that don't drop out when the model is tilted forward. I don't know what the holes in them are for though. The 3 "eyes" are made up of 2 trans red cheese bricks for the sides and 1 trans red stud for the center.You can also see how the missile pods are attached to the side of the body. This is the back of the Hailfire Droid. There is a plate with a hole in, I have found only one purpose for this. The Hailfire Droid is the Commander droids war chariot! What do you use the plate for? 3. Spider Droid The Spider Droid. The design has been greatly improved from the Wookiee attack set. Not only is it more accurate but also more poseable which is useful when setting up battle scenes. The ball joint provides the place to put the antenna which isn't long enough but the dome form the old set looks more like the droid form Star wars Episode II. The eyes are made of a telephone piece with 2 trans red studs on. In the original it had orange studs. The eyes can be seen in action 2 pics down. I told you it was a telephone. 1 of 4 identical legs. These are very easy to adjust into what ever position you want and are much better than the originals. But a word of warning never pull them apart as I did they become very loose when put back together so I put some blue tack in the holes. 4.Overall Build: 7/10 A little to repetitive for my liking. Minifigs: 8/10 4 figs for £20 isn't too bad plus they come with new guns. Design: 9/10 Both vehicles are very well designed but the hailfire's small size let the set down. Parts: 8/10 Comes with lots of useful (maybe not ) Brown track links. Price:7/10 Not too bad with 4 figs and loads of little brown links. Playability: 6/10 Not to much on it's own Overall: 7/10 If it came with some clones and tan red droids it would be better. Afetr Jar Jar wiped out a small droid patrold he realized he was being watched Mesa in big dodo this time...	neutral

6205: V-Wing Fighter Number of Pieces: 118 Number of Minifigs: 1 Price: 9.99 USD/ 13.99 EUR/ 8.99 GBP Theme: Star Wars/ Episode III Year Released: 2006 Brickset Folder Bricklink Catalog Welcome to this review of the V-Wing Fighter. This will be my eighth review on the boards. Strangely enough, there was another set called the V-Wing Fighter that came out in 1997 for the Space theme. Note that I am missing several small pieces to this set, but they are mostly insignificant to the overall look. The Box This is the standard box type for all 2005-2006 Star Wars sets. I can't say that I like it as much as the 2007 or 2008 box types, but it'll do. It features a profile view of Darth Vader and silver text. Overview This is the whole set. This ship is meant to protect the Chancellor at all costs. They are usually found in groups of three or four. Front This ship is very sleek, and you'll notice that it's colors are dark red, light bley, and dark bley with a touch of black. It starts at the nose very narrow, but as the body progresses to the back, it gets wider, like a "V" (hence the name). Back Here is a view of the rear. Note the trans-neon green discs used to represent the boosters. Also notice the dark red R4 astro droid and the hinges used as aromor. Flight All four wings (two on each side) can open up for flight/ attack mode. They can open even farther then the pic shows, but it's not an intended function. The wings a great, but it's a real pain to position them correctly, and the bottom wings close when you set the ship down. Tail fins This is what the tail fins look like on each side, with two flaps attached to the top and bottom. If you look closely, the tail fins and wings look a little bit like a mini ship themselves, maybe controlled by remote. No, this is not an intended function, either. Guns, side The guns are very simple but very clever, using a double Technic hole piece, two black bars, and two Technic pins. Also note the landing gear. Minifig Finally, here is the minifig: a clone pilot. It has light blue arms and legs, white hands, a helmet with black markings and Republic insignia on it, and a double-sided torso. The front of the torso is great, featuring shoulder straps, armor plating, and a life support system. While this minifig is not altogether accurate to the movie, it has still been one of my favorite Star Wars figs. Back The back of the fig that can double as the front of clone marines. This side features shoulder straps and armor plating. Cockpit Lastly, here is the pilot seated in the cockpit. He fits perfectly, although it is not air-tight. We wouldn't want the poor guy to suffocate, now would we? That wraps up the review, here is the FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, a nice, easy, build, and the last of the small SW ships ($10 or less). Playability: 6/10, pretty fun to swoosh around, but that's about it. Could use a vulture droid, but that would take away the 'small' factor. Swooshability: 10/10, very fun and easy to swoosh around endlessly, without fear of it breaking. Minifigs: 9/10, there really is no need to have more, although a Palpy fig would be outstanding. The pilot is a great figure though. Design: 9/10, extremely accurate to the movie, but the cockpit is not airtight. Price: 10/10, you couldn't ask for a better deal! Overall Score: 8.6, an excellent set. Unfortunately, this is the last of the small SW ships currently. The fig is great, and the sleek design is accurate. That just about sums it all up, feel free to leave your comments! Edited by JimButcher, 15 September 2008 - 03:11 AM.	positive
Yeah this was an ok set. I remember getting a few of these at TRU. The boxes were smashed up and I got some 30 percent off. (Still not as cheap as regular US price ) Some ok bricks and a great minifig. Thanks for sharing your thoughts and opinions on this set I'll rate this set as average. Oh, yeah I've added the review to the index.	neutral
SWMAN, on Sep 1 2008, 05:08 PM, said: This was a great set for the price. Ten dollars for a cool minifigure and a decent sized ship is great. Indeed, it is.

Is your knight army feeling short? Do your knights get consistently run over by the skeletons? If so, this is the set for you! 852271 Knights Battle Pack Set Info Set Name: 852271 Knights Battle Pack Theme: Castle Released: 2008 Price: USD 12.99-GBP 6.49-EUR 9.95 Minifigs: 5 It's army building time! Packaging The figs come in a plastic box with a slide out tray. To open, you slide out a tab on the bottom, and pull the tray out. The Weapons One plus of this set is the good weapon selection. You get a whopping 5 shields, a spear, a lance, acrossbow, a pointed lance thing and a lovely chrome sword Minifigures Now the main focus of this set, the figs! One thing that's nice here is that you get a good selection of different knights. The figs are quite nice, with different faces and helmets for almost every one. Minifig Backsides! I really like the archer's quiver. Two sided head The Archer has a scared head on the other side. Brickshelf Folder And now, the ratings! Price: 6/10 (Certainly a bit overpriced. It should have been $10. The Star Wars battle packs have only 1 less fig plus some parts for $5 less) Parts: 8/10 (No bricks, but a nice selection of weapons) Minifigs 9/10 (The figs are great) Overall: 23/30 LEGO S@H Brickset Bricklink Even with a bigger army, the poor knights are no match for modern technology... Summary Even though the pack is a bit overpriced, it is still great for increasing your army's size. I would get this set if you are a Castle fan looking to expand your army, otherwise don't worry if you pass on this set. Thanks, and happy building!	positive
Nice review, which reminds me I must order some more of these battle packs at some point. Are you going to also review the skelton battlepack? Also I hope this is a start of a running joke about castle sets being stomped by SW sets	neutral
I love this battlepack! I bought two last time I went to Legoland California, and it certainly gave the knights a good variety of new troops. However, I have one complaint, and that is the guy with the lance. I am wondering why he has a lance while fighting on foot. If TLG really wanted to give him a lance, they should have given him a horse.	positive
Great set, but with two HUGE cons. - Availabilty: only on S@H? Well, surely not in Italian stores. - Why are the figures already built? Are today's kids SO dumb? Let's go back to those old minifig packs!	neutral
ImperialShadows, on Sep 2 2008, 08:46 AM, said: ... with that lovely new barding. Nobody would complain about the price then, even if it was $15. I sure wouldn't... especially if it was the silver chainmail barding.	neutral
The Cobra, on Sep 2 2008, 11:33 AM, said: - Why are the figures already built? Are today's kids SO dumb? Let's go back to those old minifig packs! Probably to reduce the size/complexity of the package, thus, saving TLC money. I don't see it being a big deal as customization is always an option. Concerning the set: Not much to say other than it does what it's suppose to do: build up one's army of knights. The variance of faces and accessories are great. I especially love the chrome sword. The price isn't bad either since the package comes with five nice figs and some great equipment. Edited by dj2005, 03 September 2008 - 06:46 AM.	neutral
After reading your review I might buy me one of these. At first I thought it was quite useless, but I must admit that your review kinda changes my mind on this BP. I've added it to the index	neutral
SWMAN, on Oct 6 2008, 07:27 AM, said: How were you able to get three small shields. I only got two in mine. I am going to check the trash just in case. I think it only comes with two. The extra one probably slipped in from another set. Sorry for any confusion!	neutral
And another great review from one of our Academy teachers, I always look forward reading them ! I think the Battlepacks for Castle are a great initiative from TLC. I like this one, but also the one with the Skellies, you get some different looking soldiers and a few weapons and shields, so that's cool. The low prices make it so that most people could build a large army/battle if they want to. A big for your review and another for TLC for making these.

I love this set. I bought one when I went to the Lego Store at Downtown Disney, and went home and bought another online. I love that it gives you a variety of weapons and figures. I like using the Bowl Helmet guy to man my catapults and crossbows.	positive
Great review! I still don't plan on getting this set. I want to get more important stuff like the new Medieval Market... Edited by lego12, 07 October 2008 - 12:19 AM.	positive
It's an ok set, but it's extremely overpriced where I live. I simply couldn't justify paying $17.99 +tax for 5 minifigs. The fact that these figures are featured prominantly in other sets makes this set a difficult purchase. Given the price, I find it hard to look at this set with much enthusiasm.	neutral
it's way to expansive for what you get, besides you pay more for the package then its containts...	negative
Dear all, I found this to be a very usefull army building set. At 2 euro per minifig it is relatively cheap in my book, so i bought 4 battle packs recently. Although, it could be difficult to integrate all of them in your army. Personally, I reshuffled some of the weapons as to integrate them better. But that is a personal preference ofcourse. Kind regards, Teddy	neutral
Today we will be joining Mr. Brickop and his dog Stud on the tough job of being a police officer. Let's join them now! 5612 Police Officer Set Info Set Name: 5612 Police Officer Theme: City Released: 2008 Price: USD 3.49-GBP 1.99-EUR 2.95 Minifigs: 2 Let's Begin! The Box A very nice small square box with the policeman and his dog on the front. And the back which shows the officer running to the scene of the crime, walkie-talkie in hand. Instruction Manual The back of the manual has the 2008 Police sets and impulse sets pictured. It is interesting that the Good Wizard is on here even though I bought this set in the U.S. On this side you see how to build the model in 8 grueling steps... The Parts Not much out of the ordinary here except for the lovely printed road sign. Minifigs Here are the 2 figs, Stud and Mr. Brickop! They make a great team don't they? Extra Parts This set comes with a surprisingly large amount of extras for such a small set. All Built After it's all built, you get a pretty nice set. The road sign looks nice, but it is a bit strange seeing that arm stick so far out. The little equipment rack is pretty nice. Brickshelf Folder The Ratings Price: 8/10 (Decent price, but could be 50 cents cheaper) Parts: 8/10 (Nothing special except for the road sign which is a big plus) Minifigs: 10/10 (You can't wish for more than 2 in an impulse set!) Overall: 26/30 LEGO S@H Brickset Bricklink Mr. Brickop has finally put LEGOland's most notorious criminal behind bars... Summary This is a great impulse set. Having 2 minifigs really sets it above some of the other ones. The set make a great gift, or a good cheap present to yourself. It is great if you need to expand your police force as well. I would definitely recommend it. Thanks, and happy building!	positive
I really love these Impulse sets at a low price point for lots of minifigs This Police one doesn't appeal too much to me at the moment, but who knows, with your reference I may need it with a future project! Hmm... It's actually a good way of getting those dogs cheaply	positive
I also love the impulse sets, but we have already too many policemen (although I actually bought this one). Our bobby isn't looking very nice is he?! We normally but policemen in a pool or sea with sharks at events like LEGOWorld, so maybe that's because of me Edited by JopieK, 02 September 2008 - 11:00 PM.	neutral
Good set, but I would have about 4 by now if it came with handcuffs though the roadsign is good.	positive
I bought this set for 2,14€ yesterday and I have to admit that for that price i'm veerryy satisfied ! I bought it especially for the dog (my first one) and for the road sign. During the construction (short!) of the set, I was wondering something... Does the speed limit has a signification in every country or some variant exists? In my country (France), the speed limit in town is 50 km/h so I understand the road sign in this set. But in other country, and especially the country were the speed limit is not in km/h, does this set had another road sign?	positive
Not a bad set altough the radar is a little weird looking.	neutral
A very nice set, but one of my least wanted impulse sets. I eventually bought it, and looky here, I got an extra doggy!	positive
Thanks for this fine and elaborate review on the 2nd best impulse set there is. (Yes the Troll Warrior wins by a zillion miles) I've added it to the index	positive
Set Name: Crossbow Attack Set Number: 7090 Theme: Castle Pieces: 54 Minifigs: 3 Released: 2007 Price: 5.99USD, 3.99 EUR, 7.99 CDN Legoshop.com description: Ready, aim, fire!It's a battle of brave knights against the evil skeleton rider! Includes 2 knights, skeleton and a skeleton horse! Rolling wagon has a launcher that really fires! Bricklink Inventory Peeron Inventory Brickshelf Gallery Now, On to The Review! The Box As you can see, the front of the box illustrates the set very nicely, showing the skeleton warrior attacking and the knights firing their crossbow. The Back The Back of the box shows a small battle happening between a knight and a skeleton, as well as the main feature of the set, the firing crossbow (more on that later.) The Instructions Not much to say here, its the same as the front of the box. The Back of The Instructions This merely shows pictures of other sets in the castle line. Random Instruction page This set does not use piece callouts to tell you what parts you will need in each step. However, the set is so small you should never have trouble finding a piece. The Minifigures This is the main reason I bought this set. You get two knights, one with a standard helmet, and the other one with a new mold. You also get a skeleton warrior. The Horse The set comes with a skeleton horse that looks great. However, it is a single molded piece that has no articulation. Close-up of the Warrior riding his horse Here you see the brave skeleton riding in on his...ah......er......um......noble steed! The Accessories/Weapons For Minifigure Accessories, you get an axe, a skeleton sword, and a skeleton shield. Extra Pieces I was left with one skeleton arm and one leg when I was finished the build. The Crossbow Wagon and now, to the main part of the set, the crossbow wagon. It is really just a plate with some whells attached and a lot of those cheese wedge pieces to create the track for the projectile. Back View This view shows the mechanism that makes the crossbow fire. It is powered by a rubber band. You pull back on a technic piece, which creates tension in the elastic band. When you let go, the elastic pushes the piece forward, which in turn hits the projectile and makes it fire! It works fairly well, but I would have prefered it fired farther. Entire Set The Skeleton charges at his adversaries! The knights prepare to counterattack! Overall Build: 10/10 The build is simple, easy and quick. Set design: 7/10 The crossbow could have worked a bit better. Playability: 8/10 The crossbow is fun to shoot. Minifigs: 10/10 It doent get much better than this. I love that domed helmet mold! Price: 8/10 The set is very affordable and worth the price. Overall Score:43/50 Conclusion Overall, this is a great set and a solid army builder. You get three minifigures for a fair price and the crossbow wagon adds some much-needed playability. I bought two of these to bolster my army and to stock up on those rare domed helmet pieces. Basically, get this set! Thank you for taking the time to read my review. I hope you liked it!	positive
I agree that this set is worth the price considering the amount of minifigs and even a skeletal horse. It also comes with a lot of blue 1x1 slopes that are always useful and quite rare to obtain. Another weapon for the soldier operating the catapult (or a shield for the other soldier) would have been great, but that is pushing it. The crossbow itself is quite nice and is better than what most $6 sets come with, IMO. Overall, a good set indeed. Thank you for the review and the other review concerning The Knight, of which I hope to buy in the near future as it looks like it comes with a great deal of goodies. The weapon rack is useful, too.	neutral
Thanks for the input!	positive
Nice review, to start off. You got all the details someone could possibly need, in my opinion at least. I do enjoy this set as well, and I've bought only one to keep my minifigs as unique as possible. Despite my personal preference, I still find this a nice army builder. Good amount of minifigs for the price, as mentioned earlier, with each being different from the other. Though I would like the catapult manager to be armed with at least something, I still feel that he can just flee if he's ever in trouble. He's a good guy to use for the Castle gimmics if you have it. One more small comment. I also love those domed helmets, even if they aren't actually new. My favorite of them all, being followed up by the racer helmet.	neutral
Nice review . I still thing sets like this are the reason castle has done so well, it allows you to collect a large number of minfig for not very much cash, which I certainly indulged in. My only complaint is that you end up with the evil skeletons out numbered, however heard of the good guys winning with the numbers in their favour.	neutral

You're really rolling these reviews out, huh? I am not sure how I feel about this set. While it does include five figs, three are skeletons and are generally worth much less than say three trolls/orcs (I know they didn't exist at this point in time so this is understandable). The amount of horses is nice, but I'm not a big LEGO horse fan. What this set does have is a great appearance and brings atmosphere to the table. $20 is an affordable amount for those of us who do not wish to splurge too much on a toy while being enough to actually get a large enough set to create something out of. Personally, I'd rate it in between average and above average. Like another Castle set (I can't remember which), I just feel this one also lacks something.	neutral
I really like this set, and it's probably my next purchase from a store (if I can still find it). There's alot of great pieces (I especially like the spiked thingy on the front), and it makes a great addition for any skeletal army. Above all, I just love the spine-chilling feeling of it. If I were a minifig in a Legoland, I'd be scared out of my pants-piece if I saw a carriage like that rolling towards me in a dark night.	neutral
one of the best sets from the new castle theme. we havent seen a carriage in a long long time. and it looks so spooky and sceary! lots of minifigs new skeleton horses (3!) this was the first set i got from the new castle theme!! outstanding!	positive
That’s a nice review, though I do feel the price was a little high but as you said you get so much in it. Last year Argos in the UK reduced it to £7.99, which was a true bargain and sent me all over London looking for a store with more in stock. Again as with all the Lego castle sets I think what makes it work so well is that Lego are now providing a much larger number of minfigs and that’s often what makes a set.	neutral
I bought this set to have the scared minifig, but I found a lot of cool pieces and stuffs... I love this set ^^	positive
That's a super review Erdbeereis1, as usual and as we can expect from one of the Academy teachers. I gave the set a 4 (above average) because I think there are quite some minifigs included for its price (which is, I think, not that expensive at all) I also like the parts that are included, like the sceleton horses and weapons, wheels,... IMHO this set is a great armybuilder ! BTW: In Belgium I have seen this set being sold for 15,99 Euros.	positive
What an amazing review! I actually have this set and I decided to take it apart. It has a brown horse and a lot of useful pieces, so taking it apart was a good idea. Now I have three LEGO horses! Hoorah! The end of the review was the funniest... Lego12	positive
Other than the minis, accessories and animals, this set is 'Meh' at best.	negative
I really do love this set. It has 5 figures, which is unheard of for a $20 set. It comes with plenty of weapons and accessories and has a great design. The detail is really well done and for anyone who wants to just buy one set, this set allows for hour of fun just by itself. I already have one of these, and hopefully will be getting a second.	positive
My first fantasy era set.. and now I have 5 of them.. really good set..	positive
This set is alright but it doesnt have that pizzaz feeling you know what I mean. I would prefered a knights carrage realy but the design is ok.	neutral
I'm a little late in the coming (okay, a lot ), but regardless, I'd applaud you for another fantastic and insightful review, Erdbeereis. Out of all the castle sets, this one remains one of my favorites. I got it for Christmas in 2007, before I intended to spend much money on the new Castle theme (that changed once I managed to get the King's Castle Siege for a very good price). It's really a wonderful set all around - the design accomplishes the spooky undead feel very well, and it contains a good piece selection and a phenomenal amount of minifigs. Seriously, this set is almost unrivaled in modern lego in the final area - I'm still amazed at how many minifigures TLC put in the kit. I also appreciate that the carriage has a far more realistic horse arangement - after all the sillyness of the one-horse pulled siege engines in KK, it's good to finally see a carriage pulled by multiple horses again. All in all, an excellent set, and well worth $20 IMO.	positive
Great review! This is my 2nd favorite lego castle set (tied with Skeleton Tower) that I own. My first favorite is Drawbridge Deffense.	positive
Great review, Erdbeereis1 this really is a fantasic set. let's hope Lego makes more sets like these (with 5 minifigs+4 horses at a price of $19.99? ) actually, it's about RM200 here. and it's not even price-to-piece count. anyways, amazing review, ad if i could get more Castle sets this year, i might even join the Reviewer's Academy	positive

7990 Cement Mixer Theme: Town Released: 2007 Price: 15 USD Pieces: 209 (1 minifigure) Introduction: Need a skyscraper built? A mother-in-law buried? A treasure kept? No problem, here I come ! Only one booklet for instructions without any alternative model: It's divided into two sections for two seperate baggies which the parts come in. Parts come in two big bags: A few big pieces and the stickers are loose in the box. Extra parts and sticker sheet: Dark bluish gray 1x1 round plates are meant to be used as cement. Sticker sheet is neat. A standard worker with helmet: He comes with a shovel. Colour scheme makes it easy to understand the instructions: It's easy for younger Lego enthusiasts to build the model. Building in progress: Chassis of the truck is really sturdy. Drivers seat is on the left: I wish we had a real seat instead of a modified tile. Working drum mechanism: You can turn the cement drum from a handle on the front right. Nice details on the front: Rearview mirrors are great. I love the SNOT front panel too. Control panel on the left: Cement hose hardly fits its place and the hose is too thick. Don't forget the shovel: SNOT technique is used on the back panel as well. Long & wide truck with 8 wheels: I love the 6-stud-wide design of new town series. Cement drum actually works: If you place a couple of 1x1 plates in the drum and turn the handle it pours out the little cement parts! Man at work: All this hard work gave me wrinkles on my face :( Folder when public: Brickshelf Rating: -Figures: 6/10 Nothing special with the figure but what did I expect? At least we have a face expression. -Parts: 6/10 Standart parts for a truck but the big blue drum is new. -Price: 8/10 Very nice and detailed truck for 15 USD. -Design: 9/10 It really does look great, doesn't it? -Building: 8/10 Easy to build and it's fun with a little use of SNOT. -Total: 37/50 It's a must for every town. But other players should find it attractive as well. Conclusion: I occasionally order Town sets but I felt a great urge to build this when I first saw it on Brickshelf. When it was released I ordered it right away. Ten days later I was amazed looking at this beauty by my table. We didn't have a cement mixer for ages and I'm sure every Town builder will have this set. And I have no doubt non-Town enthusiasts, like me, will consider getting this.

Thanks for the great review! This is one of my favorite CITY kits from 2007. I think it's a lot better than the cement mixer from the classic town theme - and it has some cool pieces too.	positive
I voted outstanding, because i think this is the best cement mixer TLG ever made, also love the 6-stud wide based vehicles, as you mentioned. I both bought and sold it again this year, and i already regret it, but i had to sell some stuff because of a loss of space	positive
7040 Dwarves' Mine Defender Theme: Castle Released: 2008 Price: 10 USD Pieces: 73 (3 minifigures) Introduction: Here I am, with one of the newest Castle sets realeased in early 2008. It's a small battle wagon with blades on the front, probably to demolish rocks in mines. But in this case, our hero dwarf has to use his machine against the evil trolls who want to destroy his happy kingdom. There is only one small booklet for instructions, no alternate model: Parts come in two bags, one for small pieces and one for bigger ones: Apart from the lovely figures, the brown parts will be quite useful for any castle builder. Extra parts are not even worth mentioning, there are no stickers: Figures are detailed enough, dwarf is lovely with his beard but his legs won't move because he is short: Figures are the main attraction for adult players. We haven't seen castle army builder sets for a long while and this is closest we've got in recent years. The dwarf is a little taller than it should have been but it's not possible to do so without creating a completely new mould for figures and that would be expensive. Its beard is oversized as well but that gives him a Legoish look which I like a lot. The trolls - that's what everybody calls them but I say they are orcs - are obviously evil but they are friendly enough not to scare our munchkins. But I wish they had different torsos or at least different faces like crownies. There are not enough weapons to arm everyone but the flag pole is really nice: Unlike the Star Wars army builders, this set has very little weaponry. Only one sword and one pike creates scarcity for 3 figures - Star Wars sets had 4 figures for same price! So I hope our middle age warriors don't come across any stormtroopers :) Building in progress: When you pull the chain the catapult fires a round brick: The set has quite good playability, moving blades and firing catapult should be fun for little children. I wouldn't expect more functions for such a small sized model, it hardly covers my hand. The blades move with the front wheel on the right: There is only one little downside, there is too much friction for the wheel and blades won't move synchronized. You may come over this problem by adjusting the blade height and lining them with the wheels. Mow the little buggers! You can adjust the blade height: There isn't enough room for the dwarf: Folder when public: http://www.brickshel...ry.cgi?f=338578 Rating: -Figures: 8/10 Dwarf is amazing, trolls are great too but I wish they had different faces. -Parts: 7/10 Brown slopes are new, rest is ok too. -Price: 7/10 Acceptable but we have seen sets with more figures for less. -Design: 6/10 It looks kind of steampunkish but could be better with a little detail. -Building: 6/10 Not repeating itself, still nothing exciting. -Total: 34/50 Castle fans will definetely order this one but average Lego player may not be interested. Conclusion: Overall, it's a nice set and I'd recommend it if you like the castle theme. You'll find some good use for the figures and this is the cheapest figure set of the year - at 3.33 USD each. It could have more armory and weaponry but otherwise it's quite alright. Skip lunch today and order this little set! Links: Brickset Reviews Bricklink Entry Peeron Inventory	positive
Lovely review, really. But the sad fact is we've seen it before, twice. http://www.eurobrick...showtopic=20293	positive
Tacitus, on Sep 4 2008, 09:57 AM, said: Lovely review, really. But the sad fact is we've seen it before, twice. http://www.eurobrick...showtopic=20293 Jeez your comments are getting on my nerves. More than one review per set is allowed here. Thanks for sharing your thoughts on this set with us. A great set now has (another ) great review. I'll add it to the index. As soon as the poll on "how the index is to look", is over (phew...long sentence) Oh yeah and I'll rate this as above average. I think it needs at least one minifig more than there is.	positive
A great review of a very good set, I must echo KimT though (I seem to be doing it an awful lot) it would be improved by the addition of one more fig to the set, as it’s the same price band as last years catapult.	positive
I've skipped a few lunches on behalf of this set. It's a great army builder, but so are many of the new castle sets. What makes this great in my opinion is the figs - 2 orcs and 1 dwarf - what else could one want? Thanks TLG for making this set and thank you for reviewing it for us Review added to the index	positive
Nice review! I just recently purchased it for our future son and had to break into to it to get a first hand account of the merchandise! I am not that big into the castle theme...being a city/town person myself but I must say that this set is awsome!	positive
INDEXED Going through the boards I was amazed to find out that no one ever attempted to review one of the best Lego classics, the 6399 Airport Shuttle. While I was studying for exams a few weeks back I decided to take a break, built the monorail and take some pictures of it. Resulting in the present review. Along with this I made my first ever poll. Here we go: First, some data: Setnumber: 6399 Setname: Airport Shuttle Released in: 1990 in Holland, though Bricklink says 1991 Number of parts: 731 Number of figs: 9 Price: unknown, prices on Bricklink vary from $261 up to $2300 (!) but this was an expensive set even in the nineties The box: Mine is a bit battered by the owner before me, but there's still plenty to see. This is one of the largest boxes I have (look at the minifig in the down-right corner for the comparision) and it is a really neat storing facility for many sets. The box shows the set, and in the background the silhouet of the set that is to accompany this one: the airport from 1990. I like the angle of the box, showing the two stations, track and train in one picture. The back of the box shows some really nice ideas for other setups, why oh why has Lego abandonned this kind of showing what's possible with one set...? Inside flap of the box, showing details of the set and the functions, Detail on the front of the box, displaying the dimensions, it really is a huge track layout for one set! The instructions: there is a nice little booklet showing the same picture as the box art with the figures lined up underneath. The last page nicely folds out to show the entire setup of the tracks, The figures: A brilliant selection of minifigs including airport people and a cook. All figures that are supposed to go on the shuttle carry a ticket and there are also some suitcases (tickets fit inside, of course) Station # 1: The set includes two stations. Here is the first, depicting the airport. There are lots of details: a phonebooth, two seats, some flowers, a map, luggagelockers and of course the streetlights. A detailed shot of the station showing the luggagelockers and ticket-validating machine, Part of the beauty of this set is the fact that it is so extremely detailed, just look at the signs to show where to go next (stickers), and the scenery opposite the street... The station has the same shape as the Airport Shuttle logo, how sweet is that? The station pictured as part of the layout. The stations ends are made with airplane wings to smoothen the arrival of the shuttle. Station # 2: Here is the second station, my personal favorite: An elevated stop with a little snackbar underneath and stairs leading to the platform. Some chairs and streetlights here as well plus two old fashioned trees, The part of the set that can be used in any layout: the snackbar with hamburger sign (sticker). Yes, those hamburgers look tasty indeed! Also notice the lights hanging from the platform overhead and the ticket-validating machine at the bottom of the stairs. Here we have the platform with information panels and seats. Also notice the two trafficlights for the train. Here's how it works: the train will travel in the direction the arrow is pointing. When turning the knob the two grey blocks will move towards or away from the track-center, activating a button on the centerpiece of the train (the motor) which makes the train start it's journey around the track. There is only one speed and the train can only be put to a stop or change direction at stations. The station as part of the layout. The Shuttle: Now on with the train: There are two carrriages connected to a centered motor. the power is provided by means of a batterybox containing a 9v battery. The batterybox is in one of the carriages and displays: Airport Shuttle. A total of five passengers can be seated inside leaving room for their luggage and two drivers. The front carriage with the button for the batterybox showing. The underside showing the gearwheel (metal) that brings the power from the motor onto the geared track. The black pointy things alongside the gear-wheel react with the direction knobs at stations. This is how the shuttle negociates with height differences, everything hinges and rotates, making the shuttle capable of performing steep climbs. The motor is powerful enough to not slow down at such a climb! Detailed shot, showing the first set of covered wheels in hinged position. The shuttle on the layout. The full layout: This layout is quite huge, involving lots of track pieces, ramps, ten large stanchion-poles and the two stations. To show the movement of the shuttle I have made a 20 second movie, which can be seen in My Brickshelf gallery of this set. Conclusion: Well, to conclude the review, some final thoughts: This truly is one of the more detailed sets around (at least from the nineties) and one of the largest in dimensions. The monorail system is cleverly thought out and works excellent. Track extensions are hard to get however and very expensive nowdays (especially the switchpoints and long straight track pieces). The tracks included with this set will provide you with hours of fun though, because there are a lot of them. It can be quite hard to incorporate the monorail in your town without having a clearly-based-on-the-monorail-alone town. I tried to incorporate it some years ago (link here), posing a real challenge. The Ratings: Price: 8/10: this is an expensive set, if you can get it for under $200 get it!), this set is rare in any condition. Parts: 10/10: lots of rare pieces, cool minifigs, 9v system, roadplates, lots of minifigseats en red trainwindows. Originality: 10/10: there are very few monorails released, this one being the only town set. Compatibility: 8/10: can be a bit hard to incorporate in a town, but hey: you got the monorail so no complaining here! Total: 36/40: I can only reccommend this set to anyone, It is my personal favorite set upto this present time! If there are any questions, ask them, all comments are welcome of course!	positive
I got this set last month and I can definitely say that even if you think it is one of the best sets ever, you won't fully appreciate it until you build it yourself. The elevated city station is much more complex than it looks, and the whole set is extremely detailed. The good: - As stated in the review, there's a lot of track, roughly twice as much as the last monorail made, 6991. 5 long straights too! - the designers didn't need to put in the hamburger stand or the ticket readers, but they did and made it even better - Great figure selection; airport workers as well as civilians The bad (if you can call it that in such a great set): - Hard to incorporate into an existing town if using the default track layout. The center loop would be inaccessible to vehicles and the layout is very large. - The monorail needs nearly a full straight section on either side of the city station or it will impact the corner of the station and stall if a curve is too close. - As far as I know the only town set with road plates that doesn't have a wheeled vehicle. A car would have been nice, a bus would have been incredible. But these small things in no way diminish from the fact that this is one of the best sets ever. Edited by Section8, 05 September 2008 - 01:17 PM.	positive
Best. Set. Ever. I got my copy years ago from a guy on the old rec.toys.lego newsgroup (anybody here still remember that newsgroup??). I traded him a Guarded Inn, a Black Falcon's Fortress, and a couple other small castle sets for it. No regrets on that trade. It is hard to incorporate a monorail into a town, especially if you have a bunch of trains too! I ended up making my entire monorail system elevated. There's just no easy way to make a monorail / road crossing. I also gave up on having it run in a loop. Instead, it runs back and forth between two endpoints.	positive
An excellent review of one of the jewels in the crown of the Lego town range, to answer one of your question I think the lack of people owning this set is one of the reasons that its yet to have a review. Personally I’ve only seen this set in the flesh once in my life when I was a child just before it was withdrawn from sale. It is a lovely set, well made and well produced though I think there is a flaw and that’s when the passages get of the other end of their train ride what picks them up, a bus set for the airport would have been a good addition. Apart from that I can’t really fault it and that fact it comes with three female minifigs is just stellar. As for incorporation, keeping it elevated seems the most sensible suggestion. I’ve always thought it I have it and wanted to integrate the set to a town to use it in the style of the DLR in London, but that’s just a thought.	positive
Yes, this is one of the best town sets ever.	positive
Thanks for that splendid review, Simonwillems! I clicked on "outstanding," of course! I also like those little details, especially the ticket validating machines. You're very fortunate to own this wonderful set! I hope you have an airport to go with it. Edit: And bricklink is wrong giving 1991 as the release date. You're right; it was 1990.

An aweome review of an Outstanding set.	positive
Sets like this just don't come around too often do they... I didn't realize exactly how much detail really was in this set. TLC should bring back the monorail! Great review of an amazing classic town set!	positive
This remains the definitive city set in my eyes. I never managed to get one but from the instructions it seems to be perfect in just about every way. I got the two space monorails a while ago but the much higher prices on this one have kept it out my reach. This set is a lot bigger than either of those though. I always liked the monorail system a bit better than the trains because you could easily incorporate height into the tracks and spread them out in all three dimensions. Quote Edit: And bricklink is wrong giving 1991 as the release date. You're right; it was 1990. It was apparently released in 1990 in Europe and 1991 in North America, going by some US and German catalogs I have from that time period. Edited by CP5670, 06 September 2008 - 06:06 AM.	positive
Thanks for all the nice comments! Holodoc, on Sep 5 2008, 11:05 AM, said: I had to laugh when reading your comment on the minifig seats. Don?t you own many of those? I don?t know where to put mine... Well, of course I do have quite some seats (a drawer full actually), but this was my first set that had them in black... When I was young however (long time ago, you know ) I always had a short supply of seats, so that's why I noticed and mentioned it....

judging from videos i've seen it seems that the monorail does very well on slopes. i wonder why there haven't been more or at least an updated set? i also wonder why the trains can't incorporate some slopes like the monorail.	negative
INDEXED Name: Refuse Collection Truck Set No.: 6693 Theme: LEGO System / Town Year: 1987 Pieces: 103 Minifigs: 2 Price: unknown Special parts: 4215ap08 (Yellow Panel 1 x 4 x 3 with Recycling Pattern), just occurs in this set (2x). 4598 (Red Bracket 2 x 3 - 2 x 2), occurs only in this set and only one other set. This truck was introduced in the same year that LEGO came up with the garbage bins that of course also appear in this set. Have you ever wondered why most of the time the streets of LEGO City are so clean and neat? No litter, no garbage everywhere, no chewinggum on the streets. Even with so many different inhabitants, it seems to always stay that way. However, the older AFOLs amongst us, have experienced totally different situations: rubbish everywhere, smelly and dirty looking pavements, minifigs that were losing their standard grin. That is why LEGO came out with this magnificent truck back in 1987. Before that, people needed to put there garbage in bags or maybe barrels. From that year on, every miniman and miniwoman is happily using a trash bin. The minifig civil servants never seem to become tired and the Garbage truck comes every other day to collect the rubbish and keep the city clean. The secret behind the clean LEGO city and the always happy 'standard grin' of our minifolks are the anti-litter warriors that use their powerful machines and handy tools to just get the job done! So if you don't own a garbage truck, better try to get one, before your standard grins also fade and your streets become as dirty as Naples (where the garbage collectors recently had a strike for quite some time). An overview of the set including instructions (actually one is included in the set). Unfortunately I afraid we don't have any boxes of this set left. Another image of the LEGO items in the set. It shows the truck, two civil servants to perform the waste collection duties, two garbage bins and a broom and shovel. The two chaps that always seem to smile, even when the litter that they collect really stinks. The accessories that accompany the set. A broom and a shovel to help cleaning up in case a dustbin tips over. A very nice feature of the set is that the elevator at the back can be lifted in more or less the same way that real garbage trucks do. As you can see here, the dustbin is emptied through a red 'train window'. (It seems to be that the hinges of my version will need some 'revision'.) Panels inside the back of the truck maximize waste capacity for this 4 stud wide truck. It is nice that the designers added this simple red round brick on a clip. Presumably it should depict cylinders to let the back compartment tip for emptying or otherwise it might be gastanks. Again the complete set. It is very complete set but some additions could make it even more playable: - garbage (e.g. a green flower bottom or some round plates 1 x 1) - a place for the second worker to position himself on, when the trucks needs to drive to the dumpsite or an other street and also vertical bars for that second worker to hold himself by. This is what the truck will look like when dumping the litter at the recycle plant or dump site, the whole back nicely tilts, so that all the litter will fall out of the truck. A view on the back of the truck. Quite a small but yet effective opening. The front of the truck. Only one seat for just the driver, but I personally prefer that to a 6 wide truck that fills the total width of the streets and has problems with corners. Of course set 7991 (The orange garbage truck of last year) is also nice, we also own some of those but we never put them in our LEGO Town since they take too much room and the color scheme of 6693 is also more preferable to us. The two panels with the printed recycling pattern are a bit worn so we might recreate the recycle logo and put it on a sticker some day. Playability: 8/10 (Like I mentioned it is too bad that the set doesn't have any litter [however LEGO also saw that and has put litter in the 6693 set]) Design: 9/10 (a really nice truck with two minifigs and very nice details) Price: -/10 (I was not able to get any price information, at bricklink one can still obtain a 2nd hand one for about 25$.) Overall: 8/10 (a set that should be entitled a 'classic' in the same list as the pizza restaurants, the 7750 and the blacksmith shop) That was all the pictures I was allowed to take since it seems that those brave man still have quite some trash cans to empty. Thanks guys for doing the dirty work so our minifigs stay happy and our streets stay clean! Peeron Lugnet Brickset: Bricklink entries Additional notes on the review: My brother has always been keen on garbage trucks. However when he became aware of this truck it wasn't available in the stores anymore. Newer sets that had the 'recycling theme' we not that good. They didn't have the emptying mechanism. So after our dark ages, one of the first sets we bought, were some of those nice refuse collection trucks. Although the new orange truck has the desired mechanisms and thankfully is a decent garbage truck, we more like 4 wide trucks than 6 studs wide trucks, so for the years to come our LEGO town inhabitants will still be seeing this great truck to control their waste problems.	positive
Definitely the best garbage truck ever, the color scheme is great and the design is awesome. Outstanding, without a doubt. I must have it sometime	positive
This truck is simply beautiful! It's on my brickset wanted list! I love the colour scheme. Red and yellow are the right choice for this vehicle! The back part of the truck can be opened, so it can discharge the rubbish like real garbage trucks. You've also mentioned that in your review, and I find it a wonderful detail! Thanks for the review, JopieK!	positive
Tenorikuma, on Sep 7 2008, 08:30 AM, said: It would be cool to see a review comparing this set with the newer orange garbage truck. Well I might want to do that, but then in a different way as the railroad maintenance: I will then review the orange one and make comments on it compared to this one.	neutral
Yeah its very nice along with all the older sets. I've got the Cement Mixer that was released around about the same time as this.	positive
Thanks for the review. Like many such town sets, I would characterise it as cute. Contrasting it to the new bin lorry, it's nice that this set has two minfigs (more realistic) and two bins. Those bins are a great addition to Lego, although wheelie bins would be nice now (need some kind of 2x2 container you can clip a plate onto as a hinging lid, and clip mini-wheels under the back two studs). Having two minifigs is a superior point for this earlier Lego rendition of a bin lorry. In fact, even though our bins are now emptied by a private company rather than the local council (as was the case up till the mid 90s), and of course for the last two decades there have been wheelie-bins, bin lorries have three guys - the driver and two collectors. However, our bin collectors for sure don't use a broom or shovel! Indeed on occasion they've befouled the street themselves if something goes wrong with hoisting the bin on the mechanism! The shape of the lorry in the set is still quite accurate, pretty good for a four-wide vehicle (I must admit to preferring the newer vehicles).	positive
Thanks so much for the great review, I love that truck! I hadn't realized there was a real 4-wide recycle truck out there. I must get it one day to replace this abomination currently doing garbage duty in my town: I think that truck has seven pieces total in it. I do like the blue color though ...	positive
Greetings! Just looking through the review index when I came across this one. I recently acquired this set through ebay which came with a practically perfect box and instructions. I would almost say that no one played with it much as all of the parts were brand new. Anyway, I just wanted to say that this is a great set that was worth the $14.99!	positive
Great to find this review of a classic set and it's far better than any yuk set from 1997 OMG what were they thinking ! I prefer the six wide for trucks, but for the 80's it was perfect and even today still holds it's own !	positive
Great review, and I love the soft yellow effect to the pics IMO, the most recent garbage truck should've used the same piece for lifting the cans into the big bin instead of the droid arms	positive
6206: TIE Interceptor Number of Pieces: 212 Number of Minifigs: 1 Price: 19.99 USD/ 17.99 EUR/ Theme: Star Wars: Episode VI Year Released: 2006 Brickset Folder Bricklink Catalog Welcome to my ninth review the boards, today's review is the long awaited TIE Interceptor. But does it live up to expectations? Well, let's find out. I believe this is the first and only time TLG made this set. So, let's begin the review. The box The box is standard for it's time, with silver font. The background on the front has some planets and the Death Star II, clarifying that this set is from episode VI. Overview This set comes with the Interceptor model and one fig. The Interceptor has a very sleek, futuristic design, with four wings and a ball-shaped cockpit. The TIE Interceptor is a stealthy, speedy vehicle in the Imperial fleet. It is used for scouting missions, and not meant for attacking due to it's weak structure and low arsenal. Front This version of the TIE group is very attractive and cool-looking. It has an aerodynamic shape, giving it looks and speed. While not accurate to the movie's grey and black colored TIEs, the blue in place of the grey is just fine, and does not alter the "coolness" of the design. Thankfully, there are no stickers in this set. Cockpit Here you can see the ball-shaped cockpit. Be very, very careful when opening it; it's very flimsy and breaks off almost every time. Fortunately, both the windshield and the dish on top are printed, and not stickers. Please don't mind the dust. Cockpit Interior This is the inside of the cockpit. It is very roomy, airtight, and one of the few cockpits in SW sets that are this good. It makes up for lack of detail by giving the pilot plenty of room, so you should have no trouble there. It is also very smooth in the back and where the windshield folds down. This is by far the best SW cockpit I have ever seen done by TLG, good job! The only bad thing is the two tan bricks that clash with the rest of the color. Wing attachment This is how the wings are attached to the cockpit on each side. Unfortunately, the design on this part is not so good, and sometimes the wings break off. Plus, this part is very blocky, and there is a big juniorized piece on the base of the wings. Wings Here is what each wing looks like. There are three parts on each wing: a middle and two fins. The wings are very aerodynamic, with a diamond-like design. Note the Imperial insignias and the blue tiles lining the wings. Wing attachments cont'd Here, again, you see how the middle wing part is attached to the base (juniorized piece), and the fins attached to the base by hinges. The hinges allow the fins to fold in and out a bit, but again, this is very fragile, and the fins often break off. Gun placements This is an example of four guns on the ship, one on the tip of each fin. The guns consist of a tile with a Tenic tunnel hole on the bottom attached to a Technic pin, which is attached to a black bar. A good design altogether. Back Here you see the rear of the cockpit. You can see why the opening mechanism is so flimsy: the whole top and front is connected to the body only by a weak hinge system, as seen in the picture. Also note the small, trans-blue dish and the four trans-red studs. Minifigure Finally, here is the single figure that comes in this set, a TIE Pilot. It is an all black figure, with a life support system decal on the front and a helmet with silver Imperial insignias. An overall good minifig, with a different helmet mold than the Stormtrooper or Shadowtrooper. Well, I suppose that's about all, let's get to the FINAL VERDICT: Build: 6/10, a little difficult due the flimsiness of the ship, but should only take the average builder no more than 30 minutes. Playability: 7/10, it's fun to fly around ( ), but has no real functions. Swooshability: 7/10, you can swoosh it around fairly well, just be careful not to accidentally break it. Minifigs: 8/10, a good fig, although having only one leaves something more to be desired. Design: 4/10, very, very flimsy with the wings, windshield, and fins, but good for display. Price: 7/10: I think it was actually 30 USD when I got it, but I'm not sure... Overall Score: 6.5, an average set. Very delicate, so much that you can hardly pick it up, but good for display. The minifig is okay, and having no stickers is good. I would recommend this to a hardcore OT fan. That wraps it all up, please vote your opinion on this set in the poll, and I'll see you next review!

A nice set, my brother used to have this. I wish the pilot's helmet had a little printing on it, looks messed up to me.	positive

In reality, I am in the Aviation line, especially aviation safety. Therefore, you re-entact the scene very well. To be honest, I have never seen this set before. This AES (Airport Emergency Service) Fire Truck is certainly unbelievable. I love it very much. It's a pity I never owned this. This is a set which give me a "5". Thanks of course for the flattery but, do you then from your profession understand what the purpose is of the front 'spouts' that even can be hide, since that puzzles me. It can be that the LEGO designers thought it was a nice touch and didn't bothered about the realistic value of such a feature but I don't suppose that that is the case here.	positive

I remember my cousins having this set. Both are in their permanent dark ages now but are not willing to give their Lego to me If you have one of those old airports, then this set is what you need to have even more fun since it makes a great addition to the airport. Excellent review! 10/10.	positive

Somehow, I had just noticed your reply. To be honest with you, the AES in my country does not have front spouts in their fire engine. I do not remember seeing this feature before. It is a possibility that this feature is included in some models or an imaginative addition from our LEGO designers. I will need to check this out.

Sometimes there's no need for a big ambulance; sometimes you only need a doctor to get there. Fast! Set data 7902: Doctor's car Year: 2006 Theme: City Subtheme: Emergency Pieces: 66 (3 extra) Price: 6 USD / EUR / 4 UKP (UK price may have been higher in the past) Building time: less than 10 minutes More info: Brickset - Peeron Box front: no frills, just the set. Box back: no alternate models, but "Designed for easy building and istant play". I still wonder if today's kids are lazier or dumber than my generation... Box content: 2 bags, loose car base, instructions, stickers. (not so) Random manual page: the evolution of SNOT tecnique on car lights. Set inventory: split into 2 pages! Stickers: Red Cross has gone a long time ago; here's Caduceus. Loose pieces: we're ready to start! Minifig and accessories: "What's up, Doc?" M.I.P. (Most Interesting Piece): it's SNOT time! Building starts: and it's fast and easy Notes: car has doors! and that black plate with rail helps so that the roof doesn't only weight on the windscreen. Complete model: top view "Container Cupboards": that's where Doc puts its accessories when driving. Sticker time: see the difference, with and without. Review and rating. Do you remember when Lego cars had doors? It seems so long ago... The car is simple; but as well as a set can be designed, this one doesn't look so realistic (isn't it what Lego has been doing over the last few years? Going realistic?) Doc is OK, but I guess many people would have wanted a female fig (and: brown eyebrows with black hair? that's odd ) As I said, no Red Cross, but a politically correct Caduceus on the roof and sides. Extra pieces: 1 small antenna and 1 1x1 decorated tile. Overall, a cheap way to own a doctor minifig and a nice vehicle to add to your town. Just above average. Rating: 3.5/5	neutral
I was going to get this, but instead I got someting else (Firetruck I think) Nice review!	positive

Nice review Cobra. Thanks for sharing. I esp. like the doctor's torso. I rate this little set a 4 based on the design of the vehicle and the classic doors. BLOGGED!

Name: Cargomaster crane Set No.: 6352 @ Peeron.com Theme: LEGO System / Town Year: 1991 Pieces: 133 Minifigs: 1 Price: USD $26.00 / GBP unknown / EUR €19,95 Aargh stupid tree! for more than fourty years this 'megabrick' has tormented our town! we need some help! Long before my dark ages LEGO released this relatively small set. since they didn't have a construction site like nowadays, they released these small road-works. I was only six years old and really into small sets since my ADHD didn't allow me to sit and build for long periods of time. So these smaller sets were ideal for me. The instruction booklet. The complete set. The set itself is not really a surprise to set up and play with. First you'll build the smaller parts of the set like the container and the small verhicle. No real surprises there, except for the smaller car that fits perfectly in the cargo container. Just pull off the seat and steering wheel, and the car just fits. The crane itself is just as easy to build as the smaller parts. just place bricks on top of eachother. Although you'll still have the wire to connect and pull through a diversity of bricks and plates. The carco container and small car. Being out of my dark ages really tunnelled my vision toward bigger sets and completing my town. This set really comes in handy if i need construction or traffic workers in my town, I can just MOC a few containers for tearing down trees, fixing traffic lights, and so on. Behold the mighty cargomaster crane! It's pretty easy to say that a set as simplistic as this one is not much fun to play with. However if you see the bigger potential in your town this one could be of great value to any city. Playability: 7/10 (with only one container it gets a bit boring) Design: 9/10 (it's small, and fits perfectly) Price: 7/10 (Average, but not really cheap.) Overall: 7.7/10 (a nice overall set if you're building on minifig scale) Gimme my pizza!

Information Name: Fire Control Center Set No.: 4953 @ Peeron.com Theme: LEGO, Legoland Year: 1991 Pieces: 516 Minifigs: 4 Price: USD $85.00 / GBP unknown / EUR unknown Bricklink search results Brickset Lugnet Introduction This week I got the flu. so since I have to stay home and get better, I might as well make a review. It's one of the most amazing older city sets, thus making it a really valuable review. This is the story about four handsome firemen living in one of the most amazing city structures out there. The 6389 Fire control center. The box I actually didn't remember the box to be that small. (Borrowed from Peeron) The four hunky firemen Oh jeah what women doesn't like a man in a uniform The manual Even the manual is aging... but then again it's 17 years old! Review As you all know a city must have some standard civil services, like a hospital and a police station. A fire house also is a must for any lego city. This particular fire house is one of the most amazing sets ever to be released. In this cool set you get 4 minifigs, all fire fighters, two verhicles, and a helicopter Firefighters have to move around The futuristic fire truck is definately my favourite! Chief's car The smallest verhicle of the set, it's a small all-terrain jeep for the fire chief. pretty much a standard car in those days. a real simple layout, and a trunk which holds a small fire hose. It's lucky to be in this set, because it complements the whole thing The car Luckily it's red and it has de cool signs on the side. Helicopter Another great addition to the whole set is the helicopter. Again in a basic setup for that kind of verhicle at the time. This one has the nice addition of two hoses to put out the fires raging in lego city. The chopper No, it doesn't really fly Really cool fire truck thingy This fire truck is definately the best of the verhicles in this set. It's actually a futuristic model of fire trucks. I haven't seen any other fire truck like this. I saw a police truck like it though. but we're talking fire fighters right? Actually the whole thing han open up to reveal a number of fire fighting appliances such as a hose, a computer, and a oxygen tank. The fire truck click for bigger version! The main building actually looks kinda empty when the trucks and chopper are gone. However, this still is realistic compared to a real fire house. Also the front has those amazing sliding doors, which make this thing really look cool and clean. Off to fight a fire Main structure, with the slinding doors pulled down Actually those sliding doors are also the hard part of the model. Since all the bricks must be perfectly aligned, or else the doors will stutter. But if you're a little familiar with lego then you don't need to worry. From the back Enough room to play with I'm going to give my perspectives on each of the sides On the left we have the garage for the bigger fire truck. The only real flaw about this set is that this garage isn't long enough for the fire truck. This could have been solved by making it two or three studs longer. Notice the cool sunroof! In the middle we have the chief's office. complete with coffee machine, a diversity of computers, and a tape recorder, most likely to tape any incoming calls. A lot of details are crammed up in there. just like in the rest of the set. To the right is the helicopter platform. I really like the grey-blue-yellow of the platform because it doesn't look so red anymore. Don't get me wrong, red is a cool color, but not too much red! And the helicopter actually fits, and stays in place during playtime. The baseplate filled up This picture says it all. Again the four lego hunks are greeting all the ladies The minifigs are from a classic series, this happens with more of my lego sets. Bottom line is that this set is one of the best fire houses lego created. Verdict The build is pretty easy but takes a while to really see where you are with your building. It's nice to have a hospital from the same era, this create a more uniform look to your city. once you completed the model your baseplate is pretty filled up but still has a lot of opportunities. Playability: 10/10 (cool trucks, a chopper, and sliding doors, nuff said!) Design: 9/10 (insanely good design) Price: 10/10 (couldn't get better than this) Overall: 9.6/10 with a score like that one can only say... get one... NOW! Time to go home The trucks and chopper back on their rightful spots	positive
I have this one. The newer 6571 station is better in some ways, but I always liked the big airport-style fire engine in this and the windows covering the garages. One mod project I have in mind is to expand the base, adding a second room in the area beneath the control center. Interestingly, this set had two different box pictures. There was the original 1989 yellow Legoland box and a 1991 blue System box, and the blue box has the vehicles in different places. Quote Price: USD $85.00 / GBP unknown / EUR unknown If this is referring to the original price, it wasn't that much. $50 is more like it.	neutral
I think the 6382 Fire Station is the better one from the 80ies.	neutral
Big Supie, on Sep 7 2008, 08:46 PM, said: I think the 6382 Fire Station is the better one from the 80ies. I have 6382 and agree that it is a great set. It doesn't have a chopper like this set and the fire engine is not as flash. It does have a downstairs in the building though (at least a door and a front wall anyway!). It's nice to see a review of this set as it's one that I often looked at in the catalogue and thought of getting but never did. It's great to see the details that I otherwise would not have seen. I don't like the firemen with hair though! They should have helmets or caps IMHO! Thanks for the review! Cheers Rog	positive
This looks like a great set, I like the futuristic fire truck. That might be what I do with my Imperial Shuttle's glass cockpit.	positive
From memory Argos sold it originally for about £21 GBP. I seem to remember this as I could not afford the airport released the same year as this was about £29.99! Seems such a small amount of money now, Now have 2 copies of this set, only 1 boxed :-)	positive
Found this set on a flea Market in Munich, yesterday. Just 25 years after its release. The instructions for a total of five models, two of them printed, the other 3 are just photo instructions in the book. It still has the box in good shape, despite some wear from the age. Sadly five little pieces were missing, and 5 wrong pieces inside instead (2 complete wheels and a classic 80s-90s plane wing (dumped into my bricks). But I was able to replace the missing Minifig torch and the 4 missing plates with identical pieces from my collection. The Box and Contents The set still has the original box. Inside the pieces, plastic insert, instructions and a 1987 Technic catalogue, imagine that set livespan today. Four years and the 8841 is still in the catalogue. Classic technic design from early 80s showing a function drawing of the Steering and the main model A small set, but with a flap shoeing the contents. All pieces in the inner box and the papers included. 5th Model: Soapbox Racer This is more or less a soapbox racer with working steering, but no engine. It's got a rather blocky design, but still looks sleek enough and is a simple build little over 100 pcs out of 180. The Soapbox at step 2 Just included the steering at step 6 Completed and ready to race downhill. Total: 7/10 Simple, but effective 4th Model: Simple Chassis very simple and boring alternate using just 1/3 of the 180 pieces in the set. It even hasn't got a seat construction. It's just a plain steering mechanism attached on wheels with a spartan chassis of just a few pieces. This is the whole model at step 5 Just attach the steering mechanism and wheels and you're done Total: The worst alternate model of the complete set. Just a boring 4/10 3rd Model: Balance Very original small model. It's a small model of a working classic Balance. And it works with small parts laid on the scales, altough they've got just a 4x4 Footprint. IT's a fast build. just 15 minutes and you've done it. The model as it looks at step 3 Finished. Easy build with just 63pcs out of 180 Total: Very original model, it actually works with small weights, but a very simple build. Still a 7/10 Alternate Model: Tractor with equipment This is the second model. It's a simple but boxy design featuring a harrow and a plough. The tractor has a similar design to the very first tractor set, but much smaller. The plough is about 24-wide and the harrow is completely SNOTTED even back in 1983. Has two functions: Working steering and the coupler for the equipment. Uses almost all pieces of the set. The tractor at step 8, the steering isn't completely attached now This is the completed tractor The complete harrow Finished alternate with the plough attached. Total: Nice, but quite ugly and boxy design for a tractor with 4 wheels of the same size. Takes me to a 6/10 Main Model: Desert Racer This is the main model, with a nice (for early 80s) but boxy design. It has two functions. Steering and a working 1-cylinder rear engine, which is of the old 2x2 piston type, since the small piston design wasn't invented back then. This is the only model of the set, which has piece callouts in the instructions. The printed alternate model has no callouts, they weren't invented on both models back in 1983. The three smaller photo instruction alternates have a piece callout at the beginning showing all needed pieces. The seat is a nice, but blocky design and use a primitive SNOT technique. This is the model at step five. The piston is already attached. Imagine this state on step 5 in modern sets. Back then LEGO had challenging instructions, not the step madness like today This is the engine just made of plates with a hole in the middle for the piston Step 9. The piston engine is completed. On step 12 the roll bar and the seat are installed. Only the steering isn't completed yet. Front view of the finished model. Just 15 steps needed back then. Bird's eye view of the whole set Displayed on the box Model Verdict: Nice design, especially the colorful seat in SNOT technique, but quite boxy especially the engine, since there were only the huge pistons. Still a 9/10 Set Verdict: Design and Models: 7/10, very boxy designs, due to the age. The chassis alternate sucks Build: 9/10 Classic 80s technic building. Quite challenging but fun Sturdyness: 7/10: rear section damaged after the table fall, but rather easily fixed Fun: 9/10 Blast from the past.

Nice classic set. Are those hoses around the engine pneumatic tubes? That Technic catalog looks interesting too. I have the catalogs for the next several years but not that one. Quote This is the model at step five. The piston is already attached. Imagine this state on step 5 in modern sets. Back then LEGO had challenging instructions, not the step madness like today The most extreme example of this was the engine step in the 8865 set, which uses over 120 pieces by itself.	neutral

I have some decouplers but we don't use them because they are not really that reliable. LEGO just release a whole line of trains at the same time. I just discussed with my parents and they told be LEGO had those sets longer in store back then. I must have gotten the 7745 somewhere in 1983 or even 1984 although it was released in 1981. I started of with the 7710 (push along train) and then upgraded the tracks with current rails when I got the 7745. The 7745 was realsed in 1985 ;) Lego had 2 12V passengers trains between 1981 and 1984 (the 7740 & 7725) During the 80s the avergae life of a train was about 5 years.	neutral

That's not the one I was thinking of, it was the other two chairs towards the middle of the wagon that I was thinking of. If you try to seat a minifig in either of them, you'll quickly find that it's impossible, beacuse the door interferes with the figs' required personal space. If you move both of them one stud forward (so that the back of the seat lines up with the edge of the window), it'll solve the problem, and still leave space for a figs to be seated in the other chairs.	neutral

The best 12v legotrain is for me the 7740. The 7725 is still a goodlooking train and the only one with short wagons in a electric version. Before I started to with bricklink, I started to build this train in blue. I've build 4 trains of it and sold 2 of them. Still one for sale . You can also build this in other colors, like a yellow one: Or you can build a black version, which I made a death train of it. Driven by a skeleton .

Nice review. I got this set not long after my ending of the dark ages. It was even then already on slae for just 5 euro. I like the figs and the vehicles. It were some of my first orange pieces. The Hippie Guy is called " Snap Lockit" and the Pizza Guy is called " Pepper Roni". I think the legodesigners had a cosy evening with much beer when they thought about the names. I think this line was the only line which was made first as computergame and after that as a real line instead of the other computergames based on already existing lines.	neutral

Her name was Sky Lane. It's quite sad, though, to actually play the game--the "Xtreme Tower" is the only set that made it into the game itself, and it was a really watered down version of the Information Center from the first two games. But the island was, in the game, filled with incredible buildings that would have made really cool sets.	negative
Nice review. Is that one minifig breaking out of prison? (Just wondering about his clothing.) The worst thing is the name. Anything with Xtreme in the title almost deserves the lowest score possible on principle.	negative

It is not very often that I rate a Legoset 'poor' (it's the first time actually), but in this case I had no other option. The idea of this set is good, and I like the mostly yellow minifig, but the design of both the airplane (weird 'window'-piece, a propellor that is way too small, minimal skies underneath and a strange colourscheme) and the hangglider (two handlebars on the wings, too many colours) makes the set mark the essence of LEGO's downfall during those years. I really appreciate the fact that you made a review of this set, Brickster, it made me look into the details of 6735, but I am just as sure today as I was back then: I will never buy this. Anyway, thanks for the review, the quality of the set may be a disapointment your review certainly is not	negative

What would we do without the trucks of LEGOland to clean up our town? Well, I didn't want to find out, so I bought this set straight away! 7991 Recycle Truck Set Info Set Name: 7991 Recycle Truck Released: 2007 Theme: City Price: USD 14.99-GBP 12.99-EUR 14.95 Pieces: 206 Minifigs: 1 Review Time! Leading off, the box The front shows the recycle man loading up... The trash can? One thing here is really bizarre. On LEGO S@H and everywhere else, it says that this set is called Recycle Truck. Which makes sense as it has a recycle logo on the truck. However, on my box, it says the set is called Garbage Truck Has this happened to anyone else? Or is it just me... Here is the back of the box which shows some of the things you can do with this set. The Bags With this set you get 3 bags which are numbered. And do you see what I see? Yes, that's right, the DSS is in a bag so it doesn't get bent! Why TLG doesn't do this more often is beyond me... Bag #1 The set comes with a very nice selection of pieces. A large number of these are orange. Manual Silly me, I forgot to take a picture of the front of the manual. The picture is the same as on the front of the box. The back shows some of the 2007 city sets in a nice little scene. And inside. Minifig Here is the friendly garbage/recycle man. He looks nice but with the same head as so many other city figs before him. Come on TLG! Give us some new heads! The Sticker Sheet The stickers actually are pretty decent as far as stickers go. I like the recycle sign. After Bag #1 This is where we stand after the first bag is built. Bag # 2 The parts contained in the second bag. More nice orange pieces here. Extra Parts Some nice 1x1 slopes and 1x1 round plates. Everything Built Now that everything is built, let's check it out! The design of the set is very nice and the color scheme looks great. When you see it, you immediately know what it is. The back has a droid arm that acts as a handle to dump the trash/recycling in the truck. It's simple, but works well. Here you can see the dumping mechanism. It works by a sliding technic beam with a stopper On top of the truck you can store the worker's cart. This works really well. I think though that the top of the truck overall looks a bit jumbled up with a few too many different colors. The bottom. Trash dumping time! This is a good feature of the set. A very well built SNOT front section. This looks fantastic with the grills and number plate sticker. Someone has left a big mess on the street... Brickshelf Folder Ratings!

I would certainly recommend this set, no matter what it's really called Thanks, and happy building!	positive
Yeah, the name on this set is strange. I think all the boxes say Garbage Truck. I guess it's up to each builder to decide whether 1x1 round plates are recyclable material or not. It's a great model in any case. I love these highly detailed city trucks we've been getting during the last year or two. I used to have a preference for the late 80s/early 90s city line but some of these new sets have really surpassed them in detail and functionality.	positive
nice truck indeed, but the yellow one is better I think, at least if you put them on a roadplate it seems to me that those road plates are too small for that. Also it will not empty completely because of that panel. Well, for the rest it is a nice set and a fine review!	positive
I own this set and I think it's a really nice truck, but there is two little details that I didn't like : 1/ a recycle truck really Needs 2 minifig, one to drive, one to put the garbage on the back. 2/ the big hole behind the driver seat, it was easy to fill it Like this : with hole POUF ! no more little hole! but this is really a great set anyway. 4/5 for me ( above average )	positive
A good set, with a nice color scheme. I still prefer the last one that had a removable bin.	positive
This looks like a great set, and I'm happy you were dumping spongebob, he deserves that. This set looks very nice, and if I see it I will probably pick it up.	positive

I think the only improvement to this set would have been the use of chrome exhaust pipes and front grill. I bought this set with a lot of excitement, but unfortunately have not put it together yet. What are your thoughts on these larger 6-stud wide detailed vehicles as opposed to 4-stud wide classics? Here's an image of 6668 Recycle Truck released in 1992: PS. I like the use of "taking out" Sponge Bob in your review. It's hard to say... I think if the older 4 wide cars and trucks were as well-designed as the new 6 wide ones, I might prefer those.	negative
Thanks for this review. I really love this set. It's perfect for my town, and brings a sense of "classic" when I see it.	positive
That looks like one of those big strange recycle trucks from new york city, i like it!	positive
I like this set, but I can't give it a good grade for playability, as the rearmost hinging section is too stiffly hinged, so when you open it, it's likely to break if you hold it just over the shovel and broom. My truck thus has that function, and with it of course the whole container tipping, disabled. I also moved the cab a bit forward and the front axle rearward to give the cab the typical garbage truck look, as they are often very low slung. This also created space behind the cab for some equipment.	negative
It would be cool if someone made a MOC in which hippies steal the truck and cover it with flowers and bright colors and stuff!	neutral
