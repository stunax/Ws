306 lunar landing plates year released 1979 piece count 2 minifigs 0 list price unknown as part of the classic space collection lego offered two sets of moon plates one was a set of two crater plates and the other this very useful landing plate set not much to review but worth sharing a few images the landing plate and tplate the two plates connect to form this very nice classic space landing platform set 497 galaxy explorer included the landing platform but the one that i had was lighter in color than the one contained in this set at least the yellow circle future lego space sets could benefit by having similar road plates share your thoughts	neutral
these are my only space base plates from classic space actually with only 2 plates i could not do much serious expansion with it instead i merged it with my old city baseplates and used it as a docking station for scientific purposes or restricted facilities that is guarded by the police these baseplates are very useful and is suited for creating a space command center up in the space  	positive
these are pretty good but i think they look too much like the standard town roads from that period i like the black space plates from the early 90s better 6710	negative

these plates are great in setting up your space base and giving your ships a place to land my favorite though is the lunar crater plate which i use to death in my comic 	positive

great review sinner i own the later version 709 released in 1977 mine no longer has decals though the variations were minimal it looks like your boat is in really good shape considering its 30 years old excellent review	positive

nice review sinner the old sets i donÂ´t know  every old set especially equipped with the old nonmoveable arms minifigs look very odd nowadays i agree with you with the hull shape and its possibility to be extended but every other aspect the lack of detail the keel itself you canÂ´t float it in shallow water keeps me from rating it higher than 310 in my opninion the best police boat so far is 4021 click to enlarge	negative
i love those minifigs theyd go for alot on ebay i bet great boat as well i love the old hull design	positive
thank you for the nice review sinner holodoc on aug 1 2008 0859 am said nice review sinner the old sets i donÂ´t know  every old set especially equipped with the old nonmoveable arms minifigs look very odd nowadays i agree with you with the hull shape and its possibility to be extended but every other aspect the lack of detail the keel itself you canÂ´t float it in shallow water keeps me from rating it higher than 310 in my opninion the best police boat so far is 4021 click to enlarge well if youre meaning really old sets than i agree with you but a lot of the sets from the very late 1970s and onwards are still very nice this set just isnt a good example thats all oh and i also agree with you about that police boat however the newer one in the city line is also great imo the only thing that weighs against it is the giant size which makes it feel awkward in more classic towns edited by grevious 03 august 2008  0630 pm	negative

so youve been bitten by the classic bug too sinner great review but one would think arms would come in handy pun intended when you are a police officer right its a shame that many of the original figs must now be forced to stand looking like they have their hands in their pockets eh i have no idea where i was going with that last sentence	neutral
great review mariko this set is way before my time too i like how lego used to create simple one story houses instead of the really tall house that we see in todays town theme such as 8403 city house one story houses such as 345 just look more realistic to my eyes the simplistic minimalism vibe that i get with this set is something that is hard to find in todays much more detailed sets although trust me i love love love todays detailed sets  the brick is epic	positive
image link from brickset i thought i would do a pic review of the 1st lego castle the yellow castle 375 released in 1978 first let me say that this set was truly ahead of its time it introduced new building concepts such as the hinge and new figs most were still the armless faceless minifigs during this time this set introduced me to castle which was my first real favorite theme i enjoyed breaking it out from the garage and building it again the majority of the pieces are 1x1 1x2 1x3 1x4 1x6 and 1x8 standard yellow bricks the set also includes yellow 1x4 1x6x2 and 1x8x2 arches yellow 2x2 2x3 and 2x4 bricks various grey plates 1x2 black inverted slopes red drawbridge pieces two classic red castle doors 8 hinges 2 for each corner and a few other nifty pieces including six red 1x1 windows a complete inventory is available at peeron 375 inventory a view from the front the drawbridge is 6x8 the front tower stands 12 13 bricks high plenty of room for horses the drawbridge does work the string originally black is attached to the opposite side between a plate and the arches the right side of the castle identical to the left ive always loved the 2x2x3 sloped bricks and corner pieces the back i love these red doors a 1x4 brick attached to the other side of the baseplate keeps intruders out that banner was the original sticker piece notice the wear the rear tower largest of the towers and backside two hinges at each of the corners allow the corners to open for playability before opening open lots of arches add to the detail of the inner walls inner front this set included 14 figs how about that for quantity unfortunately i peeled off worn stickers from the shields and the breast plates years ago the blue castle guards and knights are the keepers of the castle i still think that these helmets are the best lego ever made they just look good the black and white knights and the red knights ive always prefered to use the black and red guards and flags from the knights joust sets conclusion the yellow castle is truly a classic set and im so glad i kept the pieces to this together after all these years if you have a chance to buy one or even obtain the set instructions its worth building and wouldnt be difficult to substitute grey or other colors i hope you enjoyed this review and feel free to share your comments	positive
nice review i havent built yellow castle for many years but i do remember the fun i had building it when i was young yellow castle just opened up an entire new world for me also i liked all the alternate models on the box od wish i still had that	positive
theres two alternates on the back of the instructions and as i recall some sort of bridge on the inner fold or back of box i threw away the box to this set years ago just lucky to still have all the pieces with standard pieces you can build all these alternates and many more thats why i dont particularly care for the new castles like vladeks they make building so difficult and duplicate pieces are so limited heres an old shot of the castle in the city that it use to guard we played for hours back in these days	neutral
great review it is nice to see an indepth photo review of this set i especially love the last picture of your old city it certainly does bring back memories	positive

theme hobby sets set name harleydavidson 1000cc set number 394 price new 260280  185200 euro price used 14175  10125 euro pieces 143 year of release 1976 links peeron bricklink and brickset looking at the release date of this set makes me remember the good old times when lego sets stayed in production and could be found in stores for long years yes i hear you younger fols say this meant we had less variety at the time but at least we did not have to go on a frenzy to get them all in just 1 or 2 years before they disappeared to reappear on the secondary market at crazy prices anyway i also realise this set is older than me by 5 years at least the first boxes of this set i think my parents bought it when i was something like 12 year old or even before as my father really liked the hobby set line and took any chance to get one you know for the kids when theyâ€™ll be old enough to play with themâ€¦ i am really happy my father did it too as a matter of fact this has always been one of my favourite nonminifigure scale sets i know younger eyes will look on it and wonder how we could love and enjoy a model like this so blocky and rough just remember this was the best tlg designers could do with the bricks available at the time enough about memories letâ€™s start with the review the box front the front of the box here cut and folded to save space shows the harley davidson 1000cc in all its glory upon a nice town landscape i really appreciate how tlg box designers used a real life photo of the model in a real life environment to give this hobby set a better background moreover the landscape does not distract the eye even with its lights since the focus is strongly set on the motorbike itself back and sides the back of the box shows the model on a more neutral background and from another angle we can see the stickers in place take a good look at them here because i did not apply them the right side we also see a pic of the set from the front and one with a child playing with it in this latter shot the model rests upon a nice black box with a harley davidson sign on it i frankly do not remember if this was some sort of tray or smaller box within the lego one or if it is meant for publicity only another thing we can notice on the rightmost side of the box is a white band right below the lego logo sporting the sign â€˜designed for experienced lego buildersâ€™ in various languages all in all a really well done and professional job contents inside this set includes a number of parts in mainly black white and light grey some blue and yellow add nice touches of colour to the total the partsâ€™ selection is not mindblowing as most of the pieces had been in production in these same colours for years anyway iâ€™d like to focus on a couple of details the milky white technic axles as well as the red technic bush old 2 are among my favourite parts the bushes in particular are quite useful to build more sturdy looking tubes than what can be achieved with the newer and slimmer ones it would seem that the tile pieces appeared in the â€˜without groveâ€™ version as a standard and in the â€˜with groveâ€™ version as alternates see bricklink inventory notice though that the box above and instructionsâ€™ below pictures all show the â€˜with groveâ€™ variety as said there are no recoloured parts in this set new pieces the few new molds used in this set are black and white slope inverted 45 2 x 2 old type with round bottom tube black technic brick 1 x 2 with hole type ii and red hinge plate 2 x 4 with articulated joint â€“ male and female the most interesting piece from this lot as many of you will have noticed is the technic brick 1 x 2 with hole type ii this kind of technic brick was use during 1976 and 1977 only it would seem tlg tried a new design variant which did not meet success and was later replaced with the standard bricks again nonetheless iâ€™m sure that people who own these bricks like them for the unusual design and the possibilities they offer into adding details to their creations instructions cover â€“ as usual the instructions are not organised in the form of a booklet but they consist of a folded double printed sheet the â€˜coverâ€™ shows again the same shot as the front of the box with bigger lego logo and set number and without the other additional information â€˜back coverâ€™ â€“ here we see the full name of the set harleydavidson flh 1200 this makes me wonder why is this set known as 394 harley davidson 1000cc when it is indeed a 1200cc anyway what really makes me love this page is the list of stats below the photo and in particular these two lines hp not given this calls for just one question why did harleydavidson not release this info my opinion is that since this is a motorbike built for the police they did not have permission to share the specifications on the motor which was probably customised either by harleydavidson upon request or by the police themselves â€˜random pageâ€™ â€“ as expected no callouts here but the build is pretty straight forward and does not need them apart for one passage weâ€™ll see later the colours are easy to tell apart in the end there is no dark grey in this set that could be confused with black again notice how the instructions include the â€˜with groveâ€™ tiles and not the older ones maybe this was changed during the long time this set stayed in production the â€˜last pageâ€™ shows other four models included in the hobby set line unfortunately i own only one of them the 396 thatcher perkins locomotive indeed i would have liked to have them all building start the handle bars look a bit too squared to me but itâ€™s just a minor feature and the overall shape is still good in my opinion notice the red hinge plate which will be almost totally hidden in the finished model see below and the blue tiles which work as indicators the first steps used to build the front wheel and windshield are really easy until you get to the wheel in facts the instructions do not show clearly all the pieces needed for it and i found myself with a â€˜floatingâ€™ wheel for the absence of one of the red technic bush old 2 on one side the one not visible on the instructions of course not a big deal but something that could have been done better motor and seat the second part of the build includes the motor seat and â€˜saddle bagsâ€™ the technique used for the motor or better the radiator is very clever to get the ridged feel tlg designers used 4 light grey plates stuck one on the other but not completely in contact this way the studs while keeping the plates in position keep them raised from one another at the same time the yellow round bricks add some details and colour touches to this predominantly light grey parts of the vehicle the use of the engine smooth small 1 x 2 side plates for the exhaust pipes while quite clever still looks a bit strange to me iâ€™m mostly used to see them in airplanes helicopters and spaceships â€˜saddlebagsâ€™ a simple build for one of the iconic parts of this motorcycle here you see them in place as well as get a look at the finished seat i like how lego designers managed to make its shape with just a few quite big bricks the â€˜saddle bagsâ€™ are a really nice touch and they work perfectly when compared to the original this is the rear wheel as said before only when you get to this passage in the instruction you get a real understanding of how the front wheel is supposed to be mounted as well careful readers will notice how this is not one of the original wheels in this set the original ones were mounted using the technic gear expert builder 9 tooth unfortunately i could only find one of them in my collection an itâ€™s used as the front wheel by adding the rear wheel which is shown from a better angle in the instructions we complete the model notice how the two technic bricks supporting the wheel are held in position by two 2x1 plates i think this was a bad case of â€˜building by compartmentsâ€™ mentality if tlg designers had considered this a bit more they would have used 2 4x1 plates instead of 4 2x1 on the other hand this is not the worst case i have seen in a lego set and they keep up the tradition nowadays too finished set front and here it is our fancy police harleydavidson indeed the front looks blocky and quite horrible to our eyes but again it was almost the best that could be done at the time i only wish they had made it a little less bulky even though this build is clearly thought to give better stability to the wheel the blue tiles work nicely to emphasise the indicators the slightly unsightly red plate is normally covered by the plate sticker and the windshield albeit being hard to see through is nicely shaped back the back side is less detailed than the front but shows the red light and antenna which are typical of the police motorbikes from this period how many times have we seen this angle in the chase scenes from tv shows like â€œchipsâ€ side all in all this model looks pretty sturdy apart for the antenna which falls off all too easily and detailed especially considering the limited variety of parts available and used at the time they even got so far to put a 2x2 tile as kickstand to display it without fear of it falling on the sides bonus images size comparison what i never understood about this set is what scale it is meant to be i mean it is clearly not minifigscale and it could not be technicfigscale those came later but it is not even miniland scale moreover the only other model with the same scale is the other hobby set motorbike as the cars have a scale of their own and the thatcher uses still another one final comments overall this is a great set for collectors of old models and motorbike fans or both it does not sport a huge variety of bricks but was a good choice at the time and even if the result is matteroffact blocky when compared to the original it implements some good solutions to minimise the lego brick appearance and maximise the similarity as much as possible design  colour scheme â€“ 910 the design is as accurate as possible apart for the front mudguard maybe and the colours are completely in line for a police vehicle the solutions and details included in this set justify the â€˜expert buildersâ€™ label and add to the appearance and why not playability of the model parts  810 not a huge selection and very few new molds nonetheless a good source of black and white standard parts for mocs and one of the few sources for the extra rare technic brick 1 x 2 with hole type ii pieces playability  910 a sturdy model which can take some serious play and swooshing without falling apart the easily detachable antenna and the lack of an appropriate scale interaction with most other models make it lose one point though build  710 pretty straight forward with few nice solutions and an already mentioned slightly obscure passage in the instructions price  510 like most older models especially the hobby set and model team ones this set can be found at reasonable prices only rarely most of the times people are asked shameful prices for such a smallish set overall 810 very good as always questions comments and pic requests welcome edited by whitefang 17 april 2011  0619 pm indexed	positive
great job on this review of a unique and rare set luxorv considering the year it was released this must have been a cool set back then even up to now with all the specialized pieces and advanced building techniques i could still appreciate the beauty of this brickbuilt harleydavidson police motorbike the various elements are instantly recognizable and it even has the unusual partlystacked plates technique for the motor overall id say this is an above average set that is a musthave for any hardcore lego collector	positive
great review the set is really nice i love that the front of the motercycle can turn and the engine is just beautiful with its half stacked bricks like kieldaman said the price used or new is quite a bit but there is a good variety of bricks here like the bricks inside the wheels did you get this set from your father great review luxorv	positive
thanks for the feedback guys indeed this is a great set and im very attached to it as far as i remember i got it for say my 2nd birthday i think but it is not my first lego set youll learn more on this in my next planned review	positive
thanks luxorv for this review of such a classic old lego set and i do remember seeing these in a catalogue years ago excellent brickbuilt police cycle i think its time lego did another one eh  brick on ride on everyone 	positive

theme hobby sets set name thatcher perkins locomotive set number 396 price new 369450  258314 euro price used 100355  45250 euro pieces 434 year of release 1976 links peeron bricklink and brickset my father assures me this is the very first lego set i ever got in facts he gave it to me as a present for my first half year of course that is to say he bought it for himself and used me as the official excuse when i grew up at first i found it to be quite boring no minifigures limited play features in the end it was just a locomotive it soon went to forgottenland then when i was about 10 years old i one day found again the instructionsâ€™ â€˜bookletâ€™ and saw this bright coloured big steam engine and i suddenly wanted to build it again it would seem i finally got to the right age at least for me to appreciate the design of this great set but enough about memories letâ€™s start with the review the box front the front of the box here cut and folded to save space shows the thatcher perkins locomotive in all its glory upon a nice countryside landscape i really appreciate how tlg box designers used a real life environment made of sand gravel and pebbles to give this hobby set a better background moreover the landscape does not distract the eye since the focus is strongly set on the locomotive itself the box measures about 395 x 245 x 55 centimetres or 1556 x 965 x 217 inches this is more or less the size of the 4840  the burrow or the advent calendars back and sides the back of the box shows the model on a more neutral background and from another angle we can see the stickers in place take a good look at them here because i did not apply them the right side we also see a pic of the set from the 34 back and one with a child playing with it in this latter shot the model rests upon a nice black box with a thatcher perkins sign on it unlike the harley davidson 1000cc set the thatcher perkins does not have the sign â€˜designed for experienced lego buildersâ€™ for some reason contents inside this set includes a large number of parts mainly black blue and red with some nice yellow to lighten it up more parts of interest the partsâ€™ selection is not exceptional but weâ€™ll see this set includes some unique pieces which have not been in lego sets for long years since the 1980s like the very nice black plate modified 1 x 2 with steam engine cylinder flat surfaces black train wheel spoked for motor and the red train steam drive rod holder  train steam drive rod group the wheel spoked large as beautiful as they were saw the light from the production line for the last time in 1976 the only new mold used in this set is the black and blue slope inverted 45 2 x 2 old type with round bottom tube as you can see in the above picture this locomotive was designed to work well be played with on all kind of surfaces so the wheels sport tyres in this picture you can see how they look without the tyres of course builders can use the thatcher perkins on their brickbuilt tracks another group of interesting parts are shown in this pic red wheel spoked 2 x 2 with stud and tyre black brick modified 2 x 4 with wheels holder old clear bottom and yellow minifig head plain  stud solid many newer fans will not be familiar with the last two parts they were standard fare in a number of sets between the 1960s and early 1990s but then unfortunately they were taken out of production to be fair the replacement of the black brick modified 2 x 4 with wheels holder old clear bottom with the standard technic parts was probably due to the fact that the metal pin used to connect the wheels to these bricks had a shameful tendency at getting off the wheel too bad it could not be fixed and these parts kept in production for those interested here is a picture of the dss courtesy of peeron instructions cover â€“ as usual the instructions are not organised in the form of a booklet but they consist of a folded double printed sheet the â€˜coverâ€™ shows again the same shot as the front of the box â€˜back coverâ€™ â€“ here we see the name of the set and some additional information like the year when the first thatcher perkins started working 1863 and the type 460 of this locomotive which as shown in the image is related to the number and position of the wheels on a side note the pencil signs on the sides of the sheet were made by my father while counting the parts in the set â€˜random pageâ€™ â€“ as expected no callouts here but the build is pretty straight forward and does not need them the colours are easy to tell apart full page â€“ as you may have noticed all the building steps are drawn on one side of the â€˜bookletâ€™ making it more properly an instructionsâ€™ sheet what really makes this â€˜instruction bookletâ€™ stand out in my eyes is the fact that it is indeed a poster the building steps are all on one side while the other is a bigger image of the completed set with the name thatcher perkins in yellow enclosed in an old styled red tag building start the build starts with the base of the locomotive putting the 10 wheels in place and strengthening the engine notice the use of this â€˜illegalâ€™ technique to build the bumpers lego as we all know can be a tricky medium to build with and some details need special solutions to be completed we then start building the boiler and cabin going up fast and steady in the penultimate step we build the chimney and cow catcher iâ€™d like to spend a few more words on the chimney and how it is attached to the main body as you can see in the left picture the 3x3 base of the chimney is asymmetrical with a 3x2 base on one side and a combination of a 1x2 and a 1x1 plates on the other in the right picture you see the top of the main body where the chimney will be attached it is made of a 1x2 base and 1 1x2 tile using another â€˜illegalâ€™ technique or at least one lego designers do not like much nowadays the holes of the 3x2 plate of the chimney will connect with the studs of the 1x2 plate on the main body giving a well centred and quite sturdy build finished set front the front of the model sports 3 big headlights a nice cow catcher and the nicely detailed engine front i can almost hear it whistle side and here it is our good old thatcher perkins locomotive indeed it looks like a classic and powerful engine form one of those spaghetti western films doesnâ€™t it what i found strange in the beginning is the choice of colours i was convinced steam engines were all black at the time then i checked some pictures of the original and i must admit the resemblance is almost perfect back the back side is less detailed than the front with cabin almost devoid of details i think lego could have done a better job on it 34 front and â€¦ just see how good it looks from this angle with all the tubing moving parts and the lovely 3 headlights â€¦ 34 back the back view is not as impressive but grants us a good look at the big posterior wheels and the bumpers bonus images size comparison as i stated elsewhere i never understood what scale these hobby sets are meant to be they are clearly not minifigscale and they are not technicfigscale either but they are not even miniland scale moreover they use different scales between locomotives cars and motorbikes amongst the hobby set line as i said before the set comes with tyres on the wheels to allow a wider playing experience not limiting this model to tracks nonetheless builders can assemble their own track maybe using the vintage blue 45v tracks and make the thatcher perkins run its proper environment final comments overall this is a great set for collectors of old models and steam engines fans or both it does not sport a huge variety of bricks but was a good choice at the time and even if the result is matteroffact a bit blocky when compared to the original it implements some good solutions to minimise the lego brick appearance and maximise the similarity as much as possible design  colour scheme â€“ 810 the design is as accurate as possible and the colours are completely in line for the thatcher perkins locomotive the solutions and details included in this set justify the â€˜expert buildersâ€™ label and add to the appearance and why not playability of the model though i still wish tlg had included more details in the cabin parts  1010 quite a big selection but only one new mould nonetheless a good source of black blue and red standard parts for mocs and one of the few sources for the extra rare black plate modified 1 x 2 with steam engine cylinder flat surfaces black train wheel spoked for motor red train steam drive rod holder  train steam drive rod group and wheel spoked large playability  910 a sturdy model which can take some serious play and swooshing without falling apart the somewhat easily detachable chimney and the lack of an appropriate scale interaction with most other models make it lose one point though build  710 pretty straight forward with few nice solutions price  510 like most older models especially the hobby set and model team ones this set can only rarely be found at reasonable prices most of the times people are asked shameful prices for such a smallish set overall 810 very good more pictures can be found in this brickshelf gallery as always questions comments and pic requests welcome edited by rufus 10 july 2011  0705 pm

rare classic sets are always a priceless part of any lego collection and its a good thing you still have this first set of yours luxor or did you purchase a new one excellent review btw its always a pleasure getting a closer look at these classic sets which i wouldnt have known to exist had i not seen this review overall i think its a really good set at that time of course judging this one by modern standards wont be fair but at the time im pretty sure it was a cool set to have though less cooler than having the harley davidson set	positive

indexed 410 â€“ payloader theme legolandvehicle piece count 28 year released 1973 msrp  links brickset lugnet peeron bricklink note this set was released under the number 604 outside of the us ah classic legoland a time before minifigs ever existed and cars and buildings could be made with just a few bricks the part selection was pretty basic bricks plates slopes windows and wheels were all you needed to construct an entire town heavy machinery could be modeled in 4wide and be just a few bricks tall for this review we will be taking a look at the 410 payloader one of legoâ€™s first sets of a bucket loader so grab a hard hat we are heading to the construction yard box image courtesy of bricklink box contents here we have our instructions which are obviously the older style of lego instructions the steps used much simpler imagery but they get the job done they show how to build the payloader in seven steps this small set has all of 28 parts in it the more interesting parts of note are the red digger arm the bucket the blue 1x2 brick with arm holes and the blue 2x2 brick with the classic lego logo printed on it construction in the first few steps we start building up the base then add the arms and start building the cab add the bucket the trailer socket and finish the cab throw on some wheels completed set and with that we are finished with our nice small model here is the back right side notice how the back of the cab was left with an empty spot here is the left side notice how on the top of the arm they made it so you could just push down on the tips it to make the arm lift instead of having to grab by the arm itself on the front we have the nice lego logo shown to remind the forgetful of what they were playing with you can also see how much space is in the bucket itself which cant hold more than a few small plates finally on the back we have the trailer socket this was a nice addition to make it able to tow trailers from other sets like 685 just donâ€™t try to bring it into your layout populated by minifigs they may have a problem trying to get in other thoughts considering this set is nearly 37 years old i myself am still surprised by how well the bricks have held up i purchased this set from a thrift store a year ago for a mere 25 cents normally when used lego is purchased you can expect to see scratches marks wearing discoloration etc but boy was i surprised to see how all these parts are in mint condition even the instructions still looked like they came from a new box and not all ripped up and tattered the pieces still connect to each other nice and tight and the metal pieces for the wheels havent rusted this just shows that with proper care these things can last a lifetime i really would like to get a small display case to show it off conclusion playability 810 in addition to the standard of having rolling wheels you also get a fully movable bucket assembly with it you can pick up smaller pieces and unload them into a dump truck design 710 like all other legoland vehicles it has a very basic design but you can still easily identify what it is simple yet effective parts 710 like most other older lego sets all you really get are a few basic bricks and plates however you do get a bucket assembly and the 2x2 brick with the classic lego logo on it is very cool it was also nice of lego to include the trailer socket so you could tow around your trailers price 810 bricklinks history shows them to sell for around 10 usd used while that is a bit much for a set this size it is pretty good considering this set is over 37 years old however if you are looking for a new boxed set be prepared to fork over about 50 usd overall 810 this small machine would make a nice addition to your collection as a reminder of legos past so what are your thoughts on this classic set edited by thebrickster 01 june 2010  0555 am	positive
thank you very much for this wonderful review this is the oldest lego set in my collection i received this model from my grand parents many years ago  im not exactly sure who in my family it used to belong to but it has a home with me now its a very simple but attractive looking vehicle and functions pretty well too overall very nice	positive
nice review great nostalgic set like you said it has nice designsimple yet effective i like construction vehicles so this set has even bigger impact on me	positive
ah the good old daysthanks for the review yoshi648  cute and cool at the same time its interesting to see that the same front end parts had been used from the early 70s up in to the late 90s  nice again to step back in time and keep on bricking everyone 	positive
i voted outstanding regarding this set i found mine at a consignment store it was inside of a larger set from the same time period	positive
woah 25 cents for a mint condition set thats amazing	neutral
its simply amazing how far lego has come in 30 years	positive
and again those tears in my eyes with original box i really love those classic space stuff looks like i need to clean my stuff this summer	positive
this classic space shuttle is simply superb i love the layout of this shuttle in fact it reminded me as one of the space fighter jet that roam around in space defending the boundaries from intruders i just love these old grey bricks very much and the printed computer brick is just lovely its such a pity that i did not grow up with classic space in my childhood these are actually great stuff and formed the base of the space theme in lego brickster thanks again for another outstanding classic review	positive
this was my first space set ever 1979 1980 dont know anymore but i do remember i got this together with 897 for my birthday when we where camping with a little luck i may even have an old film from my dad opening the boxes well what to say it looked soooooo aggressive with those two engines but i never knew why you needed two steering wheels on it they probably just thought a symmetrical model was better  i cant blame them what a nice set it would even sell today no doubt looooots of swooshability	positive
the computer is my favorite part sadly i dont own any classic spaceexept for some space police and a blue classic space man	positive
nice 442 is the lowest set number i have seen for any classic space set so it must been released with the first wave in 1978 its remarkable that a lego spaceship this old and small can seat more figs than the much bigger mx71 recon dropship of today anyway i just want to grab it out of the screen and swoosh it all over the place lol tlg please make these classic space sets again i promise ill buy many	positive
indexed everyone remembers their first time for me it was in 19coughsomethingsomethingcough we were at her house and her mother was gone for at least an hour she slowly unzi uhhh sorry wrong story um yeahh anyway i do remember my first time it was 1977 in late summer our neighbor who worked for a department store called famousbahr said that the main store had a travelling lego display so my family filed into the car and drove into downtown st louis to see this display to tell you the truth i dont remember much about the display itself but i do remember that my parents bought me my first lego set set  456 the spirit of st louis set  456 also sold as set  661 name spirit of st louis theme legoland  large vehicle year 1977 pieces 49 minifigs 0 price 500 usd bricklink misb start  17500 usd used complete 3500 usd links peeron bricklink brickset packaging box front the original box that my set came in was most likely trashed 5 minutes after returning home this image was lovingly stolen off of the peeron page for this set i feel lucky that i even got this much similarly i have no pictures of the plastic baggies the set came in truth be told i cant be sure that there even were plastic baggies that the parts came in the set side view well there she is my first set ever  actually i seem to recall the real spirit of st louis was silver colored not black and yellow if you need a history lesson the spirit of st louis was charles lindberghs plane when he made the first transatlantic solo flight more details can be found on the wikipedia page the overall shape is pretty close at least the cockpit window could stand to be moved forward one stud but everything seems to be relatively close the tail piece isnt the right shape but it is likely the only tail piece lego produced at the time if you look closely you can see the various bite marks that my brother and i inflicted over the years i know some people would be aghast that there are bite marks but brick separators wouldnt come out for another 10 years besides we were young we didnt know any better i certainly had no idea that it would become my obsession there are some interesting part choices here everything is brick and plate built as you might expect the same set nowadays would have lots of slope wedges and wedge plates to round things out but lego was all about the brick in 77 so bricks are what we got the black inverted slopes worked pretty well asthetically as the wing struts the wings are simple 4 x 10 plates nice and square there were no minifigs in this set if i remember correctly 1977 was just about the time when minifigs made their first appearance i know i have one other set from 77 that does include a minifg at least i dont have a lot of comments for the following photos ill let the pictures speak for themselves 34 view back back 34 top front parts interesting pieces i have no idea if there were any extra pieces that came with this set i kind of doubt it instead i took a photo of some of the interesting parts to the model that translucent white piece didnt photograph so well but it is a technic axle 8 thats right sets from 1977 contained technic elements the two black parts are the forerunners to the 1 x 2 technic brick as well everytime i hear someone on the forums complain about technic elements in system sets i think back to this set the round brick is special as well here is a closer view of it complete with bite marks  round brick as you can see the stud is closed it is only one of two closed stud 1 x 1 round bricks that i own they stopped appearing in sets in 1981 for those that are interested the dss you thought you were going to escape this heading didnt you surprise yes even in 1977 lego sets had stickers the oldest printed elements i can remember were in the classic space sets that started in 1979 again when people in the forums complain about dss in sets i can only help think of this set and chuckle to myself maniacally the sticker has held up really well considering its been stuck on the brick for 32 years no discoloration very little curling i think if all stickers held up this well over time there would be less dss complaints the ratings playability 610  the set is quite swooshable and the propellor spins outside of that though minifigs na design 610  the overall shape is quite good especially given the era the color choice leaves a lot to be desired price 110  its been retired for 30 years its going to cost you to get your hands on it overall 1330  this set is for true collectors only i cant imagine anyone wanting one because they want to play with it it was a great set back in the day but the design feels really dated and if youre wondering mine is not for sale ever all the photos plus more can be found in the gallery	neutral
very brave to give an impression about one of the oldest sets ever reviewed a lot members here are younger than the set itself i think you will have to have grown up with it to like it nowadays we have seen quite a few better airplanes than that one for example this years 7643  but thanks for letting us know btw the 1x1 round brick with the solid stud is no 3062a instead of 3062b with the hollow stud	positive
great review its good to see some of the old sets reviewed i think i learned something about the history of lego from this one	neutral
outstanding review of a very special set i actually remember seeing this set on the store shelves of local department stores can you believe it fantastic review walter i really enjoy looking at these vintage sets this one deserves a blog	positive
in 1977 trans or yellow slopes existed already and using them would have made the plane more realistic a third rear wheel would have enhanced playability and design rather than this ugly black round brick its the reason why i voted below average even considering 1977s standards however this set is nice and simple offering good playability	negative
daoudbazaar on jul 15 2009 0526 pm said  there is no 45Â° slope in the original plane design  and no front cockpit window  except that it wouldnt have been the spirit of st louis oooops youre completely right the spirit of stlouis didnt have any front window nor rear wheel anyway i think a standard ryan m1m2 plane would have been a better choice less a legend but more a flexible plan for multiple uses	negative
i really like the design it has an aesthetic value lacking from most official lego planes and follows closely to the real thing minus the colours something that cant really be claimed for more recent sets	positive
483 alpha1 rocket base year released 1979 piece count 170 minifigs 3 vehicles 1 two sections list price unknown despite the nuclear nonproliferation treaty of 1968 lego dared design a rocket base complete with a rocket system that may have had nuclear capability in 1979 luckily the rocket was defective having rather flimsy white bricks that did not stay together well during launch attempts lego scrapped its wmd program and the result was this classic blue era space set known as the alpha1 rocket base instructions on the backside of the instructions the set is featured with the space command center space cruiser and a few vehicle sets the set includes three figs and this great rocket fuel tanker heres the front section complete with computer and the rocket fuel section the set has some interesting features including the control section fuel control and launch pad on top of the control section is a nicely design radartracking system heres the open control room the launch pad and fuel control the fuel control includes two sink pieces and blue steering wheels and legos wmd weapon of mass destruction the alpha1 on the launch pad heres a shot of the launching mechanism unfortunately i have lost one of the blue sinkfaucet pieces as well as a black hose a closeup of the alpha1 rocket the white bricks never stayed together well often times coming apart within your hands the arming and guidance system was nicely designed a view of the complete set and another this is a great set the base fuel vehicle and launch platform offers a great amount of playability my only complaint is the rocket as mentioned above i dont think i ever played with it a sa kid because it always fell apart share your comments regarding this classic space set	positive
thebrickster on jul 4 2008 0414 am said a closeup of the alpha1 rocket the white bricks never stayed together well often times coming apart within your hands huh did they not think of putting a technic axle down the center of the rocket come to think of it when were technic axles invented its a neat little set makes me think i oughta make some similar kinda layout in ldd very elegant for playability	neutral
i always thought that that grey thing on top of the rocket was some kind of satelite xenologer on jul 4 2008 0525 am said huh did they not think of putting a technic axle down the center of the rocket come to think of it when were technic axles invented i had this set as a kid and i dont think there was a technic axle inside that rocket but if i remember correctly some of the later cs rockets did	neutral

nice rewiew the set is good too	positive
thanks i love the look of this set i love the mix of colours it breaks up the model rather than being a single monotone colour hes used several complimentary colours in order to make up the model i agree i think the chimneys on the flat roof is weird ontop of the garage but not so weird one you place it ontop of the building i guess hes done it to give us the choice of roofs and chimneys you can always remove the ones you dont like he also seems to have screwed up a bit on the tiling for the sidewalk on the side module on cafe corner and the building module of this set the sidewalk has the pattern light grey 1x6 at the front then dark grey 1x2 next then dark grey 2x2s however on this hes put the 2x2 tiles first then the 1x2s at the back easilly fixable though overall i love this set thanks for the pics compliments cafe corner perfectly	positive
thank you legocastlegirls for your quick review y its the first time i realize the back of the market street the tan bricks are a replacement for some windows id guess i do love that building especially the top floor with the neat balcony wub of course you are again left alone filling the interior but i just had some food parts ordered at bricklink xd one thing id like to know this is an onlineexclusive right can i order it at a legostore kln  oberhausen and get the sum rewarded on my voucher booklet sweet i heard it here but im not sure 8 if anyone is looking for how to fill it with interior go read the latest brickjournal 8 theres a whole chapter written about designing the rooms interior on	positive
hi thanks for posting those great pictures i got the cc some time ago and i really looking forward to get my hands on the market street i think the colour scheme of this set is great maybe because blue is my favourite colour just check my wardrobe i really like the design of the roof and the staircase i am not so sure if i like the gateways but i believe they will grow on me when i get the set myself snefroe1 on jun 20 2007 0902 am said 5 the white lamp and the the yellow cylinder are at the same level of the tiles imo it should be above the level of the tiles i am totally agree with snefreo1 the yellow cylinder and the lamppost should be on a level above the tiles actually i have put a 2x2 plat under the lamppost on my cc looks much better if you ask me unfortunately shop at home does not send to norway so i have to purchase this set in billund yes i am going to legoland this summer or on ebay	positive

ive searched high and low accross england to find thisand its nowhere im too stingy to buy off sh and so ill wait my turn ok now ot the set lets say i buy 3 for 12 thats 6 soldiers 3 skellies and 3 horses considering each fig is worth 1 and horses 75p that means 25p for the catapult awesome theres no lego castle anywhere in england 	neutral
iamded on nov 9 2007 0351 pm said it seems the catapult defence has been taken off sh for nz so i assume its out of stock for us its been off for a while you guys might want to check your countries too peace  catapult defense is still on for me but the final joust has disappeared all the sets are still in my stores though so no worry sweet batbrickismuchcoolerthaniamded away 	neutral
here is a review of the new monster dino creator set with power functions first lets start with the box which is much larger than it needs to be it is one of the new style recloseable boxes rather than the rip the sides style this set is typical of creator and comes with three sets of instructions the monster dino a kind of spider and a crocodile the set comes with two of the new motors one small and one large a sound module plus the new ir controler and receiver there is a mix of techniques in this set the core is mainly studless technic there are some studded technic parts and most of the details are standard creator style there are two mechanisms one to control the legs and one to control the head and arms the leg drive is from the large motor and the arm and head are operated from the small motor the completed mechanism will stand on its own without any detail added the detail is added to the base unit to complete the model the operation of the dino is very good the design for the motors and drives is very compact and well thought out the walking motion works well although there is no steering and it will fall over it it encounters obstacles the sound module is built into the head so when the mouth opens the dino roars sort of glyman made the comment that this set is ugly as sin and i tend to agree i think there are too many colour variations with different shades of grey black and that lime green p which confuses the look of the finished model but i guess it might apeal more to younger kids i also do not like the spikes along the back which glow in the dark because the are loose and keep falling off this set is not cheap at 70 but i guess this is because of the motors and ir controller while on this i was surprised how good the range was on the new controller it would still operate ever when not in direct line of sight i would give this set a 1010 for playabilityit has kept the kid amused for hours i would give it 610 for value for money it is a bit pricey overall 810 it took approx 3 hours to build and has been well played with i have posted some more images and some videos of the finished models on my brickshelf page here if you have any questions please ask pete edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0628 pm indexed	positive
thanks very much for that review i downloaded the instructions last week and i was largely impressed with what was in it however like holodoc i am waiting for the bulldozer i might have to settle with the dino though if lego charge australian some absurd price edit i just watched the videos thanks they are great the dino is better than i thought edited by sinner 10 july 2007  0229 am	positive
thank you very much for that interesting review ickelpete y well the color schemes pretty bad and the design of that dinos a bit to blocky for my liking but the two alternative models youve builtre quiet nice at least therere a lot of possibilities coming with that set 	neutral
ugly as hell but an awesome parts pack worthy of purchase	neutral
i bought this set last night and it is great my biggest surprise was the wheels that were included i didnt even know they existed and there arent even that new back to the set he is such a cute dinosaur d since he is so tubby i think he looks like a baby i suspect my wife wanted him more than me my biggest interest in the set was to have more motors and ir parts so i could make an ir car overall i highly recomend this set but as others have said be warned that the box is very oversized i wish lego would give up on this whole 11 picture thing wacko	positive
the box is has really strange dimensions  its very flat but has a large front  the 11 scale regarding the spines because theyre made of the softer nonabs plastic the stuff the 1994 cutlasses and brown muskets were made of they lose their shape a bit and so are hard to grip they simply fall off i suppose tlc use loads of different colours because a single or twocolour dino isnt very nice to look at especially when the surface isnt very smooth  it takes your eyes away from the surface and puts it on the colours someone should make an all terrain dino that can walk everywhere from this set  i dont have the skill with technic  i always end up layering and never finish any models 	negative
thanks for the nice review its butt ugly to me but the motors  ir control seem pretty neat  even at that high price it looks like a good parts pack  sweet	positive
i didnt spot this great review earlier thanks for the effort of posting all those pics and videos they helped me decide that this set is worth getting	positive
great review i must admit i didnt like mm at first site but seeing this review and looking at the mm boxes at stores appeal to me rather greatly i may get a couple of these sets great job y 	positive
ive got it also but i think ill replace the ball joint pieces with the kind of pieces that give the wings their angle	neutral
great review sweet maybe i will buy this one but not this month buying lego in billund has left me totally broke x 	positive
i like the dropship kit and got this now that i built it i see so many things i can do to tweak it to make it a moc i think this is a set everyone mm fan should get	positive
nice review	positive
of course right before i post this i see that ickelpete reviewed this set earlier in the week sorry for being redundant but it is already written so here ya go monster dino reviewed by dunamis set 4958 792 pieces 8995 from lego online store build time 35 hours here we go with another offering from the creator line im kind of fond of these sets as they are pretty imaginative and usually have instructions for multiple models i like the reusability of all the pieces and the varied things you can build the box the box that lego shipped this thing in was absolutely huge when i first got this in the mail i thought i had won the lottery and they had shipped the ucs falcon early once i opened the shipping box i was surprised to see an unusually large creator set box the box itself is pretty standard creator type box but this one shows off the power functions prominently on the right side of the box the back of the box shows some of the motorized features as well opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals were back to the reusable cereal box type tab system for those of you who stay up a night wondering about legos next box design inside the box we have a bunch of sealed bags immediately the power brick remote and motors stand out as they are each in individual bags also there are three manuals the manuals the three manuals are 76 76 and 56 pages in length they are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings  piece call outs for each step  parts inventory at the end of the primary model build  page numbers color separation in these manuals were fine for me interestingly the instructions for the primary build took a full manual plus about a quarter of another manual random manual photos parts list ill explain a bit more below but it would have been nice to have some written documentation on all the functions of the motors remote and receiver such as motor load guidelines and specific explanations of all the remote control functions it is severely lacking in this area the pieces obviously the pieces were most interested in are these new motors and wireless remote control note that before you fire this bad boy up you had better byob since this is prominently a european community i had better clarify my acronyms over here across the pond byob usually means bring your own beer in this case it still means bring your own beer im on my second heineken right now but in addition to numerous bottles of beer you will need a total of nine batteries to get through this set i kid you not anyway there are two motors a small and a large each with its own very unique name according to the manual the smaller one is called motor and the larger one is called xl motor very creative indeed the battery box takes six aa batteries and there are two compartments to hold them here is the first that seems pretty normal however the back side of it holds the other three batteries and it seems to be very poorly designed note in the photo above where the bottom battery is placed compare it to the previous photo and you will see the difference i played around with trying to get that bottom battery out and you better pack a lunch or byob because it is no small task why couldnt they make this compartment just like the other side there is a single power cord connector and a three position switch the middle position turns the power off and the other two positions seem to provide the same functionality in either position as far as i can tell perhaps a little blurb in the manual would have been nice to clear things up a bit the remote takes three aaa batteries it is fairly small and lightweight even with the batteries installed it has two thumb controls which could be levers if you insert technic bars or even pins the two controls are color coded and match the plugs on the receiver to control two separate motors in addition there is a four position switch which i assume changes the channel finally there are two tiny levers that seem to have no function im not sure if they are a trim control or variable speed control i messed with them and didnt notice any difference in the motor speed again some documentation from the incredibly verbose lego manual would have helped as far as the rest of the parts its really a mixed bag there are a lot of varied parts in this set to the point that there is almost one of everything lots of technic gears pins studded beams studless beams axles wheels etc also lots of little 1x1 slopes in various colors teeth horns etc you cant really say it is a parts pack because there is not enough of one thing to make it a parts pack a couple of notes it seems the quality control issue on the axles has been fixed i initially reported this back when i reviewed the 8285 about a year ago all the axles worked fine for me the color quality control issue is still alive check out the different shade of red in these two parts also included is the sound brick this looks just like the other sound or lightup bricks we have been seeing lately it does have a load dinosaur roar sound embedded in it though so hide the younglings if they are a bit on the skittish side finally ive never seen one of these before although someone will no doubt rattle off a dozen sets where you can find this part in about 5 seconds no i am not referring to the studded beam i put that in the photo for scale the build the build was fun and was fairly straightforward as i mentioned there is a lot of technic parts so if you are not a fan of the technic line you should run not walk away from this one there were no gotchas to speak of but you need to pay careful attention to the placement of the wires that go from the motors to the receiver they kind of sneak them around a bit so watch closely otherwise it was fine here is what is left over so far i have only built the primary model as seen on the box there are instructions for two more models both of the other models seem less complex than the primary model and are likely quicker builds the dino took me about 35 hours which included some time to screw around with the motors im an old school technic fan from way back in the 80s so i had some familiarity with the old technic motors obviously 25 years has improved some things and these seem much more powerful the design if you have built the 4507 prehistoric creatures then some of the design will feel familiar especially the head and tail it is almost like they took the dinosaur from that set and figured out how to motorize it this is not necessarily a bad thing just a comment the set does a good job of showing off the features of the new motors and remote it is nice to see how one motor can perform multiple functions in this case the small motor makes both arms move and opens and closes the mouth of the dinosaur when the mouth is completely open it pushes the activation switch on the sound brick which emits the roar sound pretty cool the xl motor handles the walking feature of the dinosaur there is both forward and reverse forward works really well while the reverse just makes the dinosaur look like he is doing a michael jackson moon walk wow i never thought i would use michael jacksons name in a lego dinosaur set review it is almost like the dinosaur cant get traction going in reverse however as noted previously forward works really well this guy actually gets going at a pretty good clip as you might expect he kind of waddles like a duck since there is no articulation in the knees it is a bit awkward but it works the xl motor seems to kick out plenty of power overall the design seems to be a mixed bag the way the tail is attached seems to be an afterthought the arms look to be too small however the walking mechanism and legsfeet are pretty cool as well as the head and mouth i guess it is a reasonable effort to get people introduced to the parts and well see designs improve as time goes on here are a few views of our new friend but what about the atat of course the real reason you are reading this is that you hope i will have some epiphany on how all this relates to the new walking atat judging from the box on the atat it looks like we get one motor i dont see the remote which is a disappointment as i hope it is not controlled by a switch on the body and you either turn the atat on or off if that is the case the first thing i am doing is scavenging the receiver and remote from this set to add to the atat granted it could be that it comes with a remote but is just not seen on the box also the atat box looks like one of the images shows that the head turns i sure hope this is controlled separately as it would be really lame to not be able to control this independently from the walking feature im kind of skeptical on the walking feature of the atat i suspect it will be rather cumbersome but hopefully i will be pleasantly surprised needless to say this is all speculation but those are my initial thoughts based on this set overall thoughts its an ok set kind of pricy but i suspect a large part of that is due to the motors and remote i havent built the other two models they seem less interesting to me but at least it has some variability also you get a ton of different parts which can either be a good thing or bad thing depending on what you are looking for the dinosaur is average the color selection is marginal black and lime green and the tail section is just lame i appreciate it more for the mechanical functions and how the motorized parts work it does do a good job of waking up my dog who seems pretty irritated by it it is a nice set to show off to the neighbors or the endless caravan of my wifes friends that seem to materialize out of nowhere people are quickly impressed by it and then promptly move along once you start trying to explain how it all works im a bit disappointed that the manual did not explain more about the remote and motor functions i suspect that there is more than meets the eye and ill just have to play around with it to find out it would be nice if lego had a website that showed all the cool functions of the motors and remotes so we fully understand the capabilities final rating 72 build 910 pretty quick and fun the mechanical part is cool functionality 610 it is a creator set so you have multiple builds as far as it being a dinosaur its just ok motorized parts are cool though design 610 partly cloudy some things are cool others are lame parts 810 new motors and remote are cool lots of varied parts included but nothing to write home about price 710 it is kind of expensive edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0623 pm indexed	negative
impressive review really clear photos too thanks dr s	positive
a very nice review thanks dunamis y i really dont understand that color scheme but the new motorsre very interesting well that dino is just mediocre to me i think that the new technic bulldozer is much more interesting	neutral
great review dunamis i hope you have as much fun with this as i have one point yes they are new axles they have appeared in a few sets this year	positive
i already made my 5 cents to this horrible colour bastard x x x in ickelpetes thread but i wanted to clarify about this dunamis on jul 13 2007 1041 pm said finally ive never seen one of these before although someone will no doubt rattle off a dozen sets where you can find this part in about 5 seconds heres one of the sets its included in it didnt even take me 5 seconds  p	negative
tks once again dunamis for a great indepth review  i really look forward to your supped up and moded atat p i am really not found of the design but i think its still a nice parts pack especially with all these nice power function elements  yoda	positive

oh is he ugly or what ive never seen a dino that needed to go on a diet more then him d but id get him for the pieces all those limegreen pieces drools but meh im not really in to mindstorms so i dont think id get this but anyway nice review i now know exactly what hes like kml	negative
wowthat set is really something but i prefer pehistoric power and triceratops or are they the same i can never tell	positive
awesome reveiw thanks i gotta get this one y wub	positive
paulc on nov 4 2007 0221 pm said i kind of like the design of this but more importantly i really want to get my hands on the power functions motors and ir control system id prefer the 8275 technic bulldozer but theres no way i can stretch to the 100 price tag so i was thinking i would have to see if i could get a 4958 monster dino cheap in the january sales if you really want the power functions the bulldozer is better value as you get two large motors two small motors and two receivers compared to the one in the dino set alos watch toysrus and argos both have had the bulldozer for 7075 in there pre christmas sales usually for a week only i am hopeing they will be on sale soon as i want a second bulldozer to get some more motors	neutral
ickelpete on nov 4 2007 0641 pm said if you really want the power functions the bulldozer is better value as you get two large motors two small motors and two receivers compared to the one in the dino set alos watch toysrus and argos both have had the bulldozer for 7075 in there pre christmas sales usually for a week only i am hopeing they will be on sale soon as i want a second bulldozer to get some more motors thanks for the tip but even 7075 is too much right now 55 was just about affordable but now my wifes buying for me its going to cost me zero zilch zip nada nothing which is even sweeter xd	neutral
i ended up buying both this and the dozer  i plan on using my dino for a ir car in a month or two	neutral
i ended up buying a misb set recently from a lego collector who is clearing up his collection excellent set to get the ir remote and ir receiver and other motors without paying insane amounts for the bulldozer now there is a quite a number of parts in power miner lime green and 1x1 white teeth plate for the mouth and claws the dino alone has 20 teeth in its mouth the glow in the dark antennas on the backbone of the dino is a nice touch as you can let him walk in the dark somewhat i do agree with the reviewer the box is insanely huge i dont think lego wanted to show a 11 scale dino they just wanted to promote the power function stuff as large as possible also the remote is smaller than shown in the picture as the hand holding it i think is smaller	positive
this is both my first set review and post about a star wars set even though i have been collecting them since 99 i got this one early this year so i thought i would post a review on it please bare with me i am not a great photographer so with that in mind here goes front of the box 75083 atdp boxfront by whitesidewjw on flickr back of the box 75083 atdp box back by whitesidewjw on flickr shot of the bags 75083 atdp bags by whitesidewjw on flickr the sticker sheet i normally dont apply them but for this i am going ahead and putting them on 75083 atdp sticker sheet by whitesidewjw on flickr minifigs i really like the two atdp pilots but the best agent kallus really does shine of course we get an extra stormtrooper 75083 atdp minifigs by whitesidewjw on flickr no new molds in this as far as i can tell however these printed 4x4 domes are really great i can see lots of uses for these in space mocs 75083 atdp new printed elements by whitesidewjw on flickr bag1 complete nothing earth shattering here an easy build 75083 atdp bag 1 complete by whitesidewjw on flickr bag 2 complete 75083 atdp bag 2 complete cockpit seats by whitesidewjw on flickr cockpit assembly 75083 atdp cockpit assembly by whitesidewjw on flickr bag 2 complete 75083 atdp bag3 complete by whitesidewjw on flickr foot assembly i like how they positioned the slopes 75083 atdp foot assembly by whitesidewjw on flickr complete atdp 75083 atdp complete by whitesidewjw on flickr complete atdpside view 75083 atdp side view complete by whitesidewjw on flickr complete atdp over view 75083 atdp complete overview by whitesidewjw on flickr complete atdp rear view 75083 atdp rear view by whitesidewjw on flickr extra pieces 75083 atdp extra pieces by whitesidewjw on flickr the verdict minifigs 55 we get a total of four figs i like the two atdp pilots and agent kallus is a well done minifig i can complain about another storm trooper either parts 35 other than the dome pieces i commented on before there is really not any new parts in this if you build space star wars or machinery this will still be a welcome assortment experience of build 45 this really was a fun build it came together fast but was challenging enough for its target age group playability 55 this thing is much more sturdy than it looks the legs take a little bit of effort due to the double locking hinges but hold together very wellthis is a very minor complaint value 45 typical 4999 for 500 pieces i must admit i paid a little more than msrp due to shipping but i cant complain about the value overall 2125 i really believe this is one of the best walkers that lego has designed the only changes i would make would be adding real control panels in the cockpit and it would be nice if lego made a real widow to fit in with these types of builds rather than a transparent tile over another plate all in all i would recommend this set and i hope the rest of the 2015 star wars sets are on par with this	positive
thanks for the early review i dont know much about the rebals show at all but i can say that the over all design of the walker really appeals to me and the minifigs look top notch i also like how the spring shooters are pretty much hidden in the frame nice job	positive
thanks for the review i have two questions  what is the driver standing on when the hatch is open and he is looking out  could you show the face of kallus without helmet please my only complaint is that the colours of both kalluss and the driverss uniforms are wrong kalluss uniform is way too dark and should be more dark olive than black and the driverss uniforms are too bright and should be more greyish compared to what we saw in the series	neutral
awesome i am really looking forward to buy this but is it really 5000 us i was hoping more around 3000 also i was wondering how the hip section for the legs work does it have a stiff turning axis to it	positive
namioik on 25 december 2014  0853 am said i mean it fits the 10 cents per piece count and has 4 figures so for a licensed theme you cant beat that but i guess lego can never satisfy everyone this is true i just had that price in mind when i saw the first images of it it did not appear to be this big or complex but new sets are getting so much more advanced than what they used to be	neutral
i built this set and i think the two rubber pieces holding the both sides of the face is a bit stretched out therefore making the set somewhat tight for entire top hatch to open and close does anyone have the same situation is this right  never mind i got it i built the back a stud too long edited by namioik 29 december 2014  0304 am	neutral
the legs are about 2 shorter than the atat its cockpit is a little larger than the atats head it doesnt look out of place as an escorttype walker or heavy walker especially as both are built in the same style although if scale differences really bother you the most recent atst is probably a better bet for you edited by hjmediastudios 29 december 2014  0432 pm	neutral
great reveiw shame on lego for forgetting that they already made a atdp pilot helmet ezras from the phantom set that didnt resort to needing a printed head	negative
its a different helmet ezras is an imperial cadet helmet the same one he wears in breaking ranks	neutral
hellbelly on 31 december 2014  1105 pm said its a different helmet ezras is an imperial cadet helmet the same one he wears in breaking ranks i meant the mold opposed to the paint job	neutral

brilliant review and thanks for plenty of detailed shots of the interior i may invest in this set but ill have to wait until 2015 star wars is sorted and budget for the arrival of pirates in april	positive
fantastic review could easily be the years best and its only january 1st youve got a duplicated picture in the bit where the candy is being moved from the outside and through the barber shop and i was expecting a final bw picture or two where the detective makes his report to the woman in red and gets his reward candy of course or she in turn reports back to her real boyfriend the candy smuggler edited by rollermonkey 01 january 2015  0408 pm	positive
wow that is the best start to a review i have ever seen great job oky amazing set ill be picking it up this weekend	positive
great review oky i managed to pick this set up a few days ago and i must say it might be my favorite modular yet for the feel alone the pool hall barbershop and the detectives office itself are all wonderfully designed	positive
nice review thanks a lot managed to improve my opinion of the set a bit but im still getting two to build larger buirldings as soon as we get the next 2x vip points special	neutral
thelazychicken on 01 january 2015  0614 pm said great review the intro was great but im still not convinced on this one the height seems too small for comparison with the rest of the modulars the play features are ok but i wish it would have been taller totally agree with you the height does seem rather small also 2x buildings on a 32x32 baseplate with a lots of spare studs behind the buildings are these buildings 12 studs in width it still looks great style wise however this might be a set i buy and look at it after i have built it  regret the amount of  i have spent on it 239 for us aussies  edited by snaplock 01 january 2015  0742 pm	negative
this modular building will be my next set thanks for the review	positive
thank you for the review it was very interesting and changed my opinion of the set im now considering a future purchase  just one question the mirror is on cardboard i was hoping for it to be a window piece with a mirror on one side i hope its not the same cardboard we had on some of the early harry potter sets or the element wont last long	neutral
thank you for the great review of this set im also curious for the backside of the mirror	neutral
amazing review very thorough with lots of details	positive
thanks for the review im a fan of the set but will be modding quite a bit have to get a small bar into the highlander and then turn the secondthird story above the barber shop into a proper apartment the detectives office is great and will stay as is	positive
thank you for the amazing and really wellreadable review makes me want to get the set even more	positive
awesome review okythanks for the cool writing and excellent photographyyour last photo could of had a cry ofyoull never take our candy well he does look mel gibson like  this set is a serious contender for best set for 2015 so much detail must buy one need to brainwash wife into buying me one 	positive
legos affiliation with six wheelers go back a long way i think the first one was released in 1981 more than 25 years ago this year lego added another one to the family mars missions rhino 1 as its title sounds its been a while since ive bought and opened a large box so maybe this isnt a surprise to most of you but the box does not open at the front as with many larger sw boxes but at the side the two printed sealsor whatever people call them have gone as well being replaced by one larger print in the middle of side the box also isnt as thick as a large sw box like the sandcrawler the general size is however still quite large pict0001jpg 28191k 102 downloads the back side shows the mars mission theme sets eccept the rhino i guess it shows this set will be released as a tru exclusive or something only to show up in legoland shops and maybe lego shops its a shame really because this is by far the best set of the theme pict0002jpg 28542k 89 downloads when you open the front cover you see a larger picture picture of the rhino obviously it seems to be some sort of multifunctional truck i think the basic function is to drive around and explore for that it has a drilling device and six giant wheels pict0003jpg 2737k 82 downloads the set comes with two instruction books im afraid to say they did not resolve the grayblack colors issue colorwise the real thing does not look like the instruction book because of it pict0004jpg 30263k 75 downloads the rhino looks really big because of the six giant wheels i guess its more or less the same size as mtrons magnetiser with the big difference between the two being that the wheels have been turned around creating a unique wheel design for a lego model pict0285jpg 29059k 83 downloads pict0277jpg 28626k 80 downloads the wheels look very cool even though the first couple of wheels stand a bit closer to each other dont know why that is hm  and they could have used a bit more body but the design is pretty good i know armagheddon isnt far away  pict0292jpg 21675k 70 downloads the suspension of the wheels is a bit flimsy sure it allows the truck to move around in a more realistic way than the old sets but its not as flexible as some older sets like sws ctt nor do the wheels have much body the black bars you see on top of the wheels are more window dressing then functional pict0293jpg 24478k 88 downloads the over all shape of the rhino is kinda bulky it looks more like a beatle than a rhino if youre asking me it has three major sections but i wouldnt call it a modular building though the cockpit is the first section its spacious and detailed pict0290jpg 26277k 0 downloads pict0291jpg 29975k 87 downloads the cockpit hangs down from a weird angle its attached to a large vertical technic brick that is part of the rhinos main structure so its not a seperate spaceship which is a shame oh well you cant have it all i guess pict0301jpg 29113k 78 downloads ah yes stickers all over the place but theyre cool the mid section of the rhino dominates the basic shape of the model its as if those two large white parts form a strong and thick shield protecting whatever is inside from whatever is outsde pict0007jpg 21322k 67 downloads unfortunately there is nothing inside its extra space needed to house the spaceship thats really a shame a command center of some kind could have given the rhino a bit more panache pict0286jpg 25135k 87 downloads however whats really great is the way in which they fit together one side has an orange 1x2 plate that fits in between two white 1x3 plates of the other side creating yet another unique shape for a lego model but again its a shame they didnt do more with this section xo pict0283jpg 28775k 82 downloads the third and last section is a platform for a space ship pict0299jpg 2895k 77 downloads pict0287jpg 19978k 75 downloads the platform itself isnt really special no details no stickers its just a skeleton to carry the spaceship nothing more nothing less no your space ship doesnt fall off even if you rotate the platform into a launch position pushing the weight of the ship backwards in fact the position of the ship onto the platform is so solid its kinda difficult to imagine how this ship flies off  the ship on the other hand is pretty cool its all sorts of things at the same time it seems it transports two aliens but also a small car

shuttle and i think it needs some modding but i do think it looks pretty nice sure the cockpit is a bit too low a pilot needs to lay down instead of sitting down and the dropping mechnism if there is one at all isnt all that brilliant either the main structure is a bit too technical for me i prefer actual parts with studs not these lego technic bars and pins pict0006jpg 22443k 74 downloads the crew pict0276jpg 23943k 70 downloads ah yes theres also this green plastic residu think they are supposed to be the aliens and theres also this weird alien craft but i didnt bother to build that sad good wub great innovative design lots of potential i even like the colors sweet lots of playability its a big attractive model i dont see any weak spots in the design that could compromise stability or structural integrity not so good  too many technic parts some sections on the model like the gun and the drilling device are a bit to flimsy id say 758510 price 750 danish crowns about 105euro	positive
thanks dude this is a great set can you please take more pictures thanks	positive
seems like they infuse system sets with more technic bars must be that technic isnt selling too well and they want to educate ppl how cool technic can be p its quite apparent when even the small bike needed technic frame	neutral
this is a great review and so is the set y i thought i would buy it but when i saw the price i changed my mind xd i always liked flying things better though like the dropship although that is a bit pricey too i guess xd	neutral
this set is truely incredible a must have but this set is also incredibly overpriced n  com on its only a big vehicle  nothing really special to justify the near 100 price tag this set is clearly worth something like 65 at max look at the incredible dropship for 34 thats a good value for money y edited by mutex 15 july 2007  0457 pm	neutral
thanks for that very interesting review snefroe1 y that vehicle looks really nice with a lot of playability but too much technic brick construction for my liking it seems like theres pretty much space wasted inside of it some kind of small laboratory or a room for the crew and at least a mining toolshed wouldve been cool	neutral

nice review y i have quick question though do the crystals fit into the aliens hands try and stick one in therebecuase the new catalog shows an image of an alien holding a crystal lastly lego should have made the aliens with movable arms and no hole in the middle  i dont want to waste any money so i am only going to grab 1 or 2 of the smaller sets piranha editimo the aliens would win becuase they have superior technology and all they do is have to cut the airtank line and the humans die edited by piranha 20 july 2007  0140 am	positive
say i was looking at your pics and then at the instructions and i just realised  havent you put the stikers on the shield thingies in the middle upside down i think you did d i dont know if i like those new sets though i mean they have great shapes and potential but at the same time they seem so holey theyre really huge and big but full of empty air and space as well well this one not as much and indeed it is the best looking set of the lot though but i dont think ill go into that line	neutral
snefroe1 on jul 16 2007 0719 am said ok then ill do that later on but i will not touch that plastic residu xd you touched them to put them in their holders in the ship so in theory you will not review them anyways nice review i dont think ill get this though im trying to decide between this moble devastator or anothe 90 set i need to get something large before my bday regards vbbn	positive
8 such a wonderful machine great review too bad all my money is going towards the castle theme  my wallet is planning to kill me	positive
great review wonderfully detailed dont care for the ship at all its that technic under a hollow shell thing like the ctt if it wasnt for the figures i would have hated it and nothing about these figures excites me ill end up finding the least number of sets possible to provide at least one of each figure for the general population collection and skip the rest unless they do as i expect and flop here thus leading to huge discounts i like this set  at half off 	positive
i agree iamded life on mars while not even that truly great was far better than this line  i am hoping the next space line lego does takes place in just that space  by the way iamded i continue to stalk you batbrick away 	negative
i think the life on mars series was great although i didnt click until the line was gone that the red hangar on the alien base was for the red mech and same with the blue one man i was gutted when i realised that i want those mechs however the base was great with the small mech and the flying crafts could the lom mechs have been the spark of life for exoforce 8 edited by iamded 31 august 2007  0515 am	positive
two of my daughters are building this as we speak i agree the design is a lot smaller than i would have liked but theyre loving it no question the figures are the real draw here and at 6 and almost five years old theyre doimg a good job building so far at least for the 46 range in my house this set is a home run thanks for the great review mostlytechnic	positive
i managed to get two sets for my twin girls for christmas and would have to agree with your ratings the anna and elsa figs are indeed excellent	neutral
isnt getting parts in new colors a good thing it is a shame there is only this one set i think tlg could make a whole subtheme out of frozen i do agree that they overuse lavender and magenta i dont see why every girl set has to have these sort of colors instead of what would be accurate to the source material 	negative
thanks for the review mostlytechnic i too wish they had done a real castle for this set it certainly deserved it my sons and i figure they could have used the old rock monster mold from rock raiders in white for the missing snow beast i will pick it up though for the figs and unique pieces	positive
thanks for the review i have the same opinion about the design looks like belville i bought it on legostore orlando december 30th it was impressive my wife saw them putting on shelf 8 or 10 boxes she ran and grabbed the last one the girls faces around it was indescribable mix of ecstasy and afraid to loose it it happened in less than 2 minutes my 7 yo girl didnt want it she likes the dresses but hates the movie prefers lego movie but my 2 yo girl who never saw the movie grabbed it for good and we bought it lego will sell it like water but i do not understand why a set so small it is the worst set design since the introduction of lego friends my 7 yo has more than 50 lego friends minifigures all the lego fiends stores and concluded that the castle had a terrible design she is 7 lets be honest lego should have released this sets months before this christmas and is loosing a perfect opportunity to sell a decent set with much more pieces i am wondering if they are going to make another set with the same characters at the end it is just for the minifigures	negative
i wish elsa had more of a white hairpiece rather than blonde but it could be worse not a bad set overall although olaf doesnt look right without the twigs on his head anna is a really nice and accurate fig	positive
the review is very well done thanks i dont know the movie my key question is whether the bricks in the set will allow to build my own snowice creations now with transglitter being part of the design approach i am not so sure can those who have already bought it tell me can transglitter be used as transparent with snow particles or is it just terrible i cannot really tell from the review pic above	neutral
im literally of the exact opposite opinion to op here i love the structure and the parts this is a fantastic little parts pack that ill be snagging more of when i find it againbut ive no use for the figures not a big disney princess fan its all about the parts this set is freaking amazing d	positive
well the good news for you is youre in luck whenever you find sets since the figs sell for a good bit of money  right now the bricklink value of the 3 figs is about 30	positive
very nice review indeed and i also cant wait for the release of this set it will be a superb wonderful addition to the lego disney princess theme	positive

there is a very simple reason for the flowers and greenleaved trees you should remember from the movie it was actually summer when elsa set of the eternal winter… the orange flowers do bother me from a design point of view i would have liked it better if they were a pinkpurplebluewhite color same goes for the leafy bits they could have used the pinkpurple ones they are gonna use in the elves sets it would have been fantastic if they had given us white leafy bits like snow covered branches im sure loads of us could use those in our mocs edited by bennemans 13 january 2015  0614 pm	neutral

hello everyone i am back to share with all of you another of my legends of chima polybags review it will be pretty comprehensive since the finished built will be quick and will be focusing more of what kind of fun that you can derive from there this polybag was bought in september 2013 when i visited legoland malaysia and i did not hesitate to put this in my shopping basket name 30253 leonidas jungle dragster theme lego system  legends of chima year 2013 pieces 30 minifigs 1 minifigure price usd na gbp na euro na sgd na resources brickset bricklink an original polybag image of the 30253 leonidas jungle dragster back view of the original polybag image of the 30253 leonidas jungle dragster the road scout of the lions tribe this polybag design is definitely plan to be the quickest and fastest dragster to recce enemy front by making a swift scout for the lions tribe i believe by the sound of the name jungle dragster it might just be suitable to use in jungle terrain well i dont quite agree that this is a dragster even though it has the kind of open view concept of rolling in fast but it does not have the length of a typical dragster similar to this town polybag design for example still it is nice to have smaller variants of their vehicular supremacy instruction manual front instruction manual back the lego building content with just 30 lego elements you can be pretty quick to be able to display these laid out content after the built is completed these are the remaining spare parts i am fond of the wheels which are some useful parts other than that there are nothing spectacular about it my name is leonidas and i belonged to the lions tribe do not be mistaken of his name leonidas to be the king of sparta who led the brave men of 300 spartans warriors to fight to the death against the persians instead this character is based on the bio resided in legocom you will realise that he is aligned with the lions tribe and is a proud lion footsoldier he may have that goofy idiotic look but he can be very serious in his commitment to discharging his duties you are able to observe his nice back view printing which reveal his black and blue sash leonidas has a dual facial feature to reveal his much serious appearance leonidas is one of the common characters available in the legends of chima universe it can be found in a total of five sets it is a great pity that there is no weapon being made for him in this polybag design which will certainly make a fine addition the completed built of the jungle dragster this is the main design of the jungle dragster which is very simple looking there is no distinct fighting capability from the vehicular design and it look just like a regular patrol vehicle one thing i like about this is the close distinct colour schema of the lions tribe other than that there is nothing special about it moving off with my jungle dragster to conclude this polybag is really meant for lego fans or collectors who appreciate legends of chima or wanting to sample the legends of chima theme it is a very simple built but yet could form a decent force size for recce purposes before sending in the big arsenals to whack their enemies either way i will only suggest you to buy it if you really love this theme at an inexpensive price otherwise it is perfectly alright to give this a miss summary review playability 410 you need to have more lions tribe vehicles in order to bring the best and fun out of it since this is more of a supporting vehicle design 410 simplistic built of the dragster and main focus is just acquiring the minifigure price 410 bought at about usd7 which is not an awesome price so get it if you can get it more than half of this price overall 410 if only you are a huge mega fan of the legends of chima then you need to get this i gave it a 2 based on my review score card what about yours i hope every one of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and criticisms are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my flickr	negative

out of nowhere this set appeared at my local tru hadnt been expecting this one for a while so a nice surprise sweet firstly the box nice pic on the front good selection of minifigs the officer and pilot look cool with their dark blue trousers a new r2 unit as well dont remeber this in the film but great to have one in a new colour wub back of the box shows some of the ships nifty features first thing you notice when you open the box is the awesome selection of bricks this makes a for a great parts pack loads of unusual red and dark red pieces its so refreshing to see a star wars set that isnt predominantly grey there are also two instruction booklets as soon as you open the first booklet you hit an error why would i want two obiwans  its also at this point that you come across a big disappointment on the box you get a flesh quigon what is actually in the box is an epiii obiwan come on lego  why change it  all the figures look impressive in the flesh despite the big mistake once i started the build it progressed rapidly red pieces seem to be a lot easier to find lots of clever techniques quite a few technic elements get used at the start it reminded me of building a technic set from the 80s at times here is the main body half way through the build the landing mechanism is a nice touch its not fully retractable but still folds away nicely you find the ship keeps tipping over as you build it despite the feet as its only at the end thay it all becomes evenly balanced at both ends here the feet are extended you can also see the yellow knob that rotates the radar on top of the ship landing gear up viewed from the front here are the radar a great collection of dishes they spin easily with little friction here is the ship at the half way point the front works well with the top flipping up to squeeze in the pilot more to come 	positive

brick miner on jul 31 2007 0746 pm said as for the set the thing that jumps out at me most is the use of dark blue for water im so used to seeing the classic blue for water that the dark blue seems weird i dont like it  bm indeed i only noticed this when i saw the sh images i guees that theyre on dark waters you can always put some trans blue and trans clear 1x1 round plates no i tried that technique to make the lava using trans red and trans orange plates it looks neat regarding the human soldier thing yoda mentioned its quite weird like him im going to swap the legs so theyre coherent with the soldiers from the other sets third note is it just me or did you attach the two black gate pieces too high shakar	neutral

asuka on aug 1 2007 0147 pm said no i think this is correct the upper plate with clip for the door is a little high on top of a dark gray 1x1 brick so if you want the door to operate well you have to place it like that i just put the clip under that brick a very easy fix so my door now is lower which looks better imho and no sneaky skelly can crawl along under it xd exactly asuka is correct also keep in mind that the picture was taken looking down on the model that is sitting on the carpet it makes the gap appear a little larger in addition for those of you that recommended ironing the sail it worked great i set the iron to low and used a tshirt to protect the sail it flattened it out perfectly in fact it worked so well that i did the same with my old ww weapons wagon cover that has gotten wrinkled over the years the iron worked perfectly	positive

excellent set the snowtroopers are just amazing most lego imperial troops are really good however its sad that except from luke all the rebels have the same face which is what is more the most unexpressive that you can find for the rest the quality looks excellent the snowspeeder is far better than the first they realized but only one thing it looks a bit too white to me i think i remember they were grey and orange rather than white in the film and the echo base door is really cool really nice set edited by lord beckett 02 august 2007  0414 pm	positive
nice review mutley y i agree with all your observations especially stickers versus printed parts  i get some of this and replace the snowspeeders with my v2s hoth on copmike	positive
great review  now i want it even more 40 that sounds reasonable in comparison to our recent experiences	positive
man the stickers on everything are really starting to irritate me a lot im not sure i like the white 3p0 in a set that is primarily made up of whites doesnt stand out enough the snowspeeder looks a lot shorter than previous versions steve	negative
jgw3000 on 12 march 2015  0546 pm said jim great review as always you convinced me to get this one of these days although not a to priority any comments on which functions can be converted to pf and how well they work actually yes i am in the midst of making a pf version i will post a picture of the setup i have so far this setup is for driving the chassis and it works pretty fine	positive
thanks for a great review ive got a pile of tru and lego credit i wanna spend and was thinking about getting this since i got a sneak peak of your review in the academy but its not here in the us yet too bad wonder when itll hit i do disagree about the manuals though i find the thinner stapled manuals easier to use than single large squarebound ones since they lay flatter when open have any links to the prelim photos of the front end i dont remember seeing that and was curious how different it looked	positive

great review jim and stunning pictures	positive
i think i read somewhere that the us will not get this set or the motorcycle until august 2015 that means the flagship most likely wont be in august but even later in the year nothing bricklink cant solve though	neutral
fantastic review jim from the quality of the review alone it is easy to see how much hard work you have put into it im with you on the instruction manual i much prefer one quality bound book over umpteen stapled booklets already have 2 of these sitting in the build queue one for display model as im a fan of this one and one to build the b model then dissemble for parts so im already sold on his set but still very much enjoyed taking the time it deserves to read through the review and ogle at your pro photography	positive
great review with fantastic pictures as for the model im glad that they chose to make it less pretty  real le mans prototypes are rarely a sight to behold it is function and aerodynamics over form i would however have preferred more realism for the sake of learning  the front shouldnt open like that  instead it should be easy to remove the whole front cover leaving the suspension easy to work on  the aero seems to be realistic except for the rear end where theres no indication of a venturi channel this should have been easy to include  there is no fuel tank nor fixed fuel connector right behind the cabin  there are no air jacks seriously this is one of the most unique features of a race car like this and lego forgot about them instead they automated two functions which are manual on a real race car  the top cars at le mans are hybrids with ingenious systems i would have loved to see the front wheels connected to some kind of spinning apparatus indicating a kinetic energy recovery system if i get this set im going to make some modifications	positive
im still not a huge fan of the model but this is one awesome review the effort and quality can be clearly seen and i hope you continue making reviews like this	positive
ted have you described your photography setup somewhere i love the crisp quality of your pictures	positive
great review i think it look like a great set both a and b however the panels are the only thing i would need but still a great looking set	positive
great review jim i have been sitting on the fence about if i will get this set for a while but i saw one built for the first time at a local brick show on the weekend it definitely looks better in real life than any pics i have decided to buy one	positive

i have been waiting for this set since the pictures for the toy fairs eirlier in the year and i am glad to say i am not disapointed first the price it is not cheap at 9999 but i guess that is typical for a set with this amount of electronics in itthere is no parts count and i have not had time to add up the 2 pages of contents to get a figure first the box standard flip top with large internal picture and rip to open lid inside there are no numbered bags in this set which i prefer i like to open all the bags and put all the parts in the box before building next is a picture on the electronics 2 xlmotors as lego describe them and 2 standard motors 2 ir receivers and 1 ir transmitter i know these have been discussed before but i really like the thought that has gone into the transmittersreceivers each receiver has 2 outputs to corespond with the 2 controls on transmitter they also have a choice of 4 channels so one transmitter can control up to 8 independant motors by changing the channel switch the transmitter also has a neat motor direction switch so you can configure the transmitter operation the set comes with three manuals 1 is the main drive mechanism 2 is the cab and engine and 3 is the attachments front and back there is also the now standard parts list in the back of the third manual there is no alternative model instructions despite the pictures of one on the box however there is a reference to the technic website on the back of the box but at the moment the page only has an advert saying the set is to be released on 1st september so i guess i will have to wait untill then to see if the instructions will be online the build is fairly straight forward the main chassis is studless the next picture shows the motors mounted into the chassis and the drive for the shovel and claw it also shows the v6 technic engine this next picture shows the ir receivers mounted on the back the battery box slots into the back and can be easily slid out with the removal of two pins which is useful because i can imagine i will need to change the batteries on a regular basis the next 2 picture are of the completed model overall i was very happy with the finished dozer the functions work really well and as i have the monster dino i have used a second transmitter so i dont have to touch the channel switch i have included some video on my brickshelf page unfortunately this set does suffer from some quality issues for example moulding marks on the plates colour diferences some of the pins not finished properly some pins were very stiff and quite hard to push into the holes but the worst issue was an axle that would not turn freely in a hole which just adds extra friction into the system i am glad to see some studded technic in this set i much prefer sets that use both varieties of technic beam there are only 2 fairings which is a great improvment over recent sets if tlc had tried to make the bulldozer shovel with fairings this would have been a complete disaster marks for the set 810 for price with the number of motors i expected it to be greater 910 for fun my kids love this type of set that does something when finished 610 for quality tlc really need to work on this one 810 overall i would definately get a second one if i see it in the sales feel free to post questions but i will be on holiday next week more pics and videos available here	positive

ah mani wanted to review it with mine oh well here in the us it cost 150 and has 1355 pieces total the pins and axles did seem a bit difficult in putting them into place a problem i have been having is the batterys are done after about 4 hours of play which i really wish they would last longer   overall it is a stupendous set and it is really nice to see our old friend the studs make a return	neutral

the new small technic sets have incredible functionality for their size and this one is no exception with only 106 parts this crane can roll extend rotate lift and hold in any position and has working stabilisers the boom extends the same as the other sets with this boom simply pull it it works surprisingly well and due to circular ridges inside the boom the extension which is just a standard beam will hold in place the gear at the back controls the height of the boom as you can see the boom is only half extended boom fully extended half down the cable is kept in place via two gears and a blue pin same as the 7905 crane even under decent weights this works well the stabilisers however cannot handle much weight once the load is moved off axis the stablilsers are a very simple but effective design another shot of the stablilsers this also shows how far the boom will decend the boom height mechanism works well also i love the cab design overall this is a remarkable achievement for the low price i bought it for the boom piece as i want to improve the crane that came with 7998 7898    i highly recommend it	positive

thanks for the review i cant help but think the minifigures are the weak part of the set snake and apu are great but the rest i dont know they kinda redundant now they could at least give us new torso printing like homer wearing his jacket or bart wearing his blue tshirt or marge wearing her coat or as i said in the discussion thread id have included jasper in cmf series 2 and a frozen version here overall the set looks kinda smaller than what i thought snakes bag needed a  symbol printed because it looks like he is stealing gargabe  pretty good review overall	positive

mestari on 14 april 2015  0115 pm said i have sooo mixed feeling about that i loved the simpsons house save for the terrible wall in the homer and marges room but this so far is inferior in almost every aspect the walls made of panels is a bummer i expect a d2c set to be better that this 60 stickers the same thing same price for less bricks and smaller build then the house strange coloured bricks on the outside wall some ugly mix of yellow  tan agreed glad my gf likes to do stickers 60 yikes but looking at it now i think the tanyellow is supposed to represent where the paint is fading on the back of the store i guess	positive

did anyone else have a problem with the piano against the wall of the simpsons house it just kept coming off way too easily and i was getting really frustrated with it sticking out and not fully going on so i had to put the two tiles that hold them one place over away from the wall for it to sit properly without falling out i think i might put snowball ii behind it since cats love to hide underneath or behind things lol but just curious to know if anyone else was encountering this problem with the previous set	positive
i recently acquired 90 of this set so i thought i would do a review of it please note that half of the minifigs are wrong and there are some part substitutions this is the only set that comes with this plate there is a depression under the grey plates to the back the pool depression can be easily covered by three quarter circle plates which just happen to be included in this set good set design lego the stairs are old fabuland ones and have been used in a few other sets this is the only one that has them in parapink however what is the difference between parapink and pink dunno the big windows are in only two other sets both of them dacta ones the smaller ones were in one other paradisa set the interior while simple works very well i love the coffee machine a cute car came with the set as well the bird house is a nice idea as well once the current visitors leave i will probably be breaking this set i wish lego would go back to these sets as they always had some great parts in them	negative
great review of a classic set y	positive
nice review of a surprisingly interesting set y those windows are great and no doubt difficult to get classic coffee maker simple yet exactly right that baseplate was in a few other sets but never with that pattern would have made a great base for some of the classic 80s houses lego used to treat us to in tan was part of the adventurers egypt sets as recently as 2001 it was a base for ogel versatile plate that hopefully hasnt disappeared completely parapink is apparently light pink on brickshelf so i guess its just lighter than normal pink and stopped appearing in 1995 just so you know that monkey is drinking too much and likely to fall in the pool  	positive

another great review thanks yoda man those smooth slopes really look like crap when on a roof  that was the whole reason they had texture in the first place  ill never liked those they feel so cheap the new sb head is great and can mrs puffs legs move i just ask since her feet are separate and in figs where the legs cant move theyre usually one piece at the bottom to keep them from breaking off the set looks great and seems to have a lot of playability	positive

yoda i dont thank you for this review and after the chump bucket review too because im so exited to have them that since i ordered them from sh i come back home aftre the work the faster i can with the hope to see a big box on my bed and this even if i know that it tooks more than 67 days to have my order this mrs puff figs is really really nice wub and this 3rd sb head too	neutral
man that spongebob head cracks me up hilaritythis is a cool set although i much prefer the chum bucket set i dont see whats wrong with the course then again i can see why afols wouldnt like it its just playability really i like the breakable wall though the building is cool a few modifications ie making it more realistic real chairs for a start and it would make a cool little wharf for your lego town and to sw4j mrs puffs legs are connected at the feet if you look closely so thanks for the great review yoda	positive
nice review mate the set looks great and a real must for all those sb fans out there the whole set scream playability thats for sure which is great because lets be honest theirs gonna be alot of kids and yoda out their playing with it p xd   geezzzzz what is it with all those bloody stikers this set would be soooooo much better with printed pieces instead of those still once your over that at least the rest is ok am i the only one who thinks mrs puff kinda looks like a kinder egg toy theirs nothing wrong with that mind you yes i have a kinder problem xd  just seems strange to me	positive

the set and the other designer sets that came out with it especially 4888 are incredibly well designed sets i wish lego would go back to doing sets like these as i loved the multitude of instructions and ideas the last batch of creator sets had zero ideas even though i know several were made  anyway less whining more review the lion is the main model his mouth doesnt fully close but it does open more the head works well from most angles i love the dark orange bricks great for rust he is quite solid but the joints take the weight well the neck goes side to side and rotates but doesnt go up and down the body is built in two parts and pinned in the middle with what is left you can make what i think is a hyena a silly plant moc and what i believe is a vulture there are also instructions for a few other models including a bat boar and a snake which i quite like he can be built at the same time as this cute little lizard overall this is a great set with an excellent blend of colours and pieces i wanted it for steampunk potentials sweet i hope you liked the review till next time	positive

thank you for the nice review sinner i also bought this set but in combination with 4883 when it was on sale 50  hurray at sh i made a short review of 4883 but wasnt really sure what to tell about 4884 so im glad you did that for me d i have different feelings about this set on the one hand i love the lion he is really impressive even my wife not known for being lego enthusiastic asked me if there were more animals of this kind the lion is  restricted  poseable and the colors used are fantastic wub 3 models can be built simultaneously  thats great on the other hand i still dont know what to do with these rotation joints wacko and the other models are somehow disappointing compared to the lion i seem to have missed the little lizard  i put it on my to dolist like all the creator sets great parts pack  but wait until they get on sale xd for me  i had a lot more fun with 4883 indeed roarrrr on 	neutral

lego 75915 pteranodon capture im glad to review this nice set 75915 pteranodon capture name pteranodon capture set number 75915 pieces 174 price 1999 minifigs 2 theme jurassic world year of release 2015 links box the front of the box has the jurassic world logo along with the set number piece count etc its a decent box size for a 20 set here it is compared to a minifigure heres the back of the box it shows all of the features from the set an ad for the video game the back also shows a small picture with a silhouette of the dinosaurs from the line along with their set numbers instruction booklet the booklet shows the same thing as the front of the box nothing more nothing less near the back of the booklet there is a picture with all of the characters from the sets the other page shows all the dinosaurs with a mini box that shows the size comparisons the minifigures the minifigures in this set are simon masrani and an acu both of them have excellent printing on the front and the back the gun is the same one from tlm that the ssp used simon masrani is the only one with a double sided face his second face shows a scaredworried expbbression he has a zipped up jacket or jumpsuit with a shirt underneath the acu trooper only has one face which is a scaredworried expbbression i would have a scared expbbression too if i was about to get eaten by a dinosaur he has great detail on his torso and legs lets take a look at the vest the vest is the same mold from the ssp in tlm i think it has the letters acu on the front too the back is nothing interesting pteranodon the pteranodon has great printing too the colors match the ones that the pteranodons from the movie have the wings mouth and head are a rubbery type of plastic and are easily bendable it uses the same mold from the pteranodon in the 2012 dino line heres a comparison between the two spare parts the spare parts arent many just a few extras the helicopter at first the helicopter was meh when i first saw it on the box now that ive built it ive got to say that i really like it its my favorite helicopter of all of the ones ive built its sturdy and sleek its not too bulky either the first play feature in this set is the net launcher it works pretty well not one of my favorite features but it does what its meant to do the other play feature is on the other side its a stud shooter which can be used by a minifigure you can put it on their hand or you can leave it there and let someone operate it the shooter can fold up inside the helicopter as well there are stickers on both sides of the helicopter and they also have the jurassic world logo with dino marks final verdict value 910  for 20 this set isnt that bad the parts count is a little low for a 20 set but the price is probably because of licensing other than that its a great deal i wouldve hoped for maybe some bait for the pteranodon but that can easily be fixed design 910  i really love the way this helicopter looks its sleekness and design is great the only flaw this has is the huge net launcher its too big in my opinion minifigs 1010b  the minifigures are extremely detailed and it even includes an exclusive minifigure playability 910  there are many things you can do with this set the swoosh factor is great and so are the play features parts 1010b  theyre useful parts and there isnt many huge specialized pieces in here either overall 910  this set is great for fans of jurassic world its also a nice parts pack theres one exclusive minifigure in here too which makes it even better having a little fun with the set hope you liked my first review here on eurobricks please leave any suggestions on what to improve thanks edited by thelazychicken 02 may 2015  1019 pm	positive
thanks for the review i really like this set i love the acu minifigures and the dinosaur is really nice i think the helicopter has great potential for a shield helicopter only suggestion is that some of your pictures are a little bit dark especially the box front one but really good for your first review thanks a lot	positive
i love the dinos in these sets but aside from that the builds imo kind of suck just like the last dino sets this just has a franchise connected to it and honestly i hope it does well enough to spark more dinojurassic parkworld interest because i want to see more dino minifigures maybe a brontosaurus or something i will most likely be buying many of the dinosaur minifigures here however i doubt ill buy the actual sets or the genetically altered dinosaur which can only work for jurassic world this set is imo average love the dinosaur	negative

yesterday i went to toys r us and bought the dilophosaur ambush beside that the shop had a display of the jw polybags for €349 i picked up two of them now here is my little review of this pretty nice set first some data line jurassic world year 2015 pieces 29 price €349 packaging polybag ok lets start with the polybag itself it is a standard size and had plenty of room for all the parts the front depicts the whole set with a little hexagon on the right with a seperate picture of the dinosaur and its name in this case the celophysis is called gallimimus weird choice next is the instruction sheet it is a doublesided paper with every building step in clear sight the part selection is nice there are only a few but all of them are pretty usefull for all kind of builds there are two parts which stoodout both are printed tiles the first one is the yellowblack warning tile in 1x4 you cant have enough of that the second one is a 2x2 tile with the jurassic world logo on it thats pure awesome the bigger sets seem to have only sticker for that so this little set is a perfect way to get hold of this nice tile the leftovers nothing special here is the complete trap it is a basic build and functions pretty well in the end the parts are more interesting as the build so it will definitely end up as a partspack now on to the star of this bag the celophysisgallimimus i dont know why lego decided to call this dinosaur mold any different but i think it has to do with movieconnection and the will to not produce a new mold nevermind this figure is great and the colour is very bright and totally stood out pretty beastie a comparison between the 2015 gallimimus and the 2012 celophysis the final set in all its glory final verdict it is a great little set the parts used a nice and usefull the printed tiles are the secret stars of this set and the dinosaur is fun two with a few packs of these you could easily build a celophysis pack with lots of jurassic world signs on their way highly recommended	positive

lego 31036 creator toy and grocery shop thanks to eurobricks for making this review possible for years lego has offered a house of some sort in the creator line each year  with the standard creator 3in1 instructions thats given us a very wide variety of housing in 2014 they added a business option with their 31026 bike shop and cafe set this continues into this years toy and grocery shop set these shops are smaller than the very detailed modular buildings but that should help them fit in better with the other city sets and this also lets them get into more kids cities with their lower pricetag name toy and grocery shop set number 31036 pieces 466 price 3999 minifigs 2 theme creator year of release 2015 links bricklink peeron brickset the box the front of the box shows the a version model out of the three plus insets of the b and c versions i like the sortaeuropean looking backdrop it goes well with the styling of the buildings interestingly the main model is shown opened up for play while the two insets show those versions folded the box top on the top of the box lego helpfully shows that with 3 of these sets you can make a whole street the box back on the back you get to again see all three versions together but this time folded its a little creepy though with those clones running around  the manuals yep three actual printed manuals theres nothing indicating them as being a b and c models but its pretty obvious looking at the designs which is the main model and which are the alternates the contents bags of parts and two plates nothing terribly exciting to see here the minifigs nothing new here but two nice figs nonetheless well bricklink does say that both figs are unique to this set but theres not any new parts to them the closest thing to rare is the female head  its only in this set 2013s dragon mountain castle set a uk store grand opening set and one of the 2014 holiday freebie sets the faces arent that unique but i guess this exact combo of two faces on the head is i love the kid torso with the spaceman on it the minifig backs no back printing on anything here except for an alternate female face sorry i do like that her two faces are so different though thats much better than when a head has a scared and a more scared face the c build enough with the basics lets build im going to review them in the same order i built them backwards since you can tell immediately looking at the 3 designs that theyre going to use different numbers of pieces and so forth i figured id build the smallest first lest it seem like a letdown all three have some basic similarities  the two plates are hinged to give a building that opens for play they also do have interiors which you can see starting to form here the c build front its a pretty quick build so its done already heres the front of the building with it opened up like this it appears to be two separate stores a newsstand and some sort of shop you can enter all the printed tiles help give the newsstand a detailed appearance but im not sure why theyve got a 100 bill lying on the ledge the c build rear from the back side the interiors are pretty plain the shop half has a plant in a jar and a weird chair and the newsstand just has a register the c build sides heres the two sides of the folded building on the hinge side theres a bunch of windows in a disjointed wall with random colors on the other why did they put in a huge window when the set does include a transclear door that could have gone there and you get a small patch of plants like so many sets seem to have these days the c build extras thats a lot of leftovers there and not just little stuff  multiple doors stairs etc and unused sand green is always a little sad the b build 1 a pretty similar start with the hinge and little garden and some tiles along the ground the b build 2 now we see a big windowed wall some details like lights and how it has the usual alternate model weird part usage  like a 1x4 brick with side studs being used over the doorway even though those side studs will not get used the b build front the finished building gives us a nice little post office with a lettercarrying bird on the roof hope thats not their normal method of delivery something about the colors just doesnt work for me though the combo of white  light grey  dark grey  black  sand green plus tan is just too much the tan window and door frames i dont like the b build inside on the inside things are weird the counter on the left is ok but the light above the door with a yellow clip ugly is too big and everything else over there by the door doesnt make much sense either the b build sides i like the front side here except the colors are still too much the bench greenery mailbox on the corner and streetlight are all nice the boy is a little creepy though  binoculars in hand plus a telescope on the roof of the post office why the hinge side shows more of the weird colors you get in the wall but thats going to be hidden when the set is open plus we even see that on big modulars at times so its not so terrible the b build leftovers again a lot of leftover parts its obvious this was another alternate but itd be nice to see more of them used to make a bigger building but lets move on to the model that does use them all the a build 1 the first half starts like this maybe its just my bias but it already feels like a more detailed build bottles on the wall the yellow and red awning over the window etc the a build 2 the other half starts off with detailed work too i think thats a red vending machine the stairs are also very solidly built i also appreciate the effort to get that diagonal base where a door will be  its such a nice touch to have sections of a building that arent right angles the a build 3 not too much has been added but i wanted to showcase the tiny toys before they get hidden by a wall that robot and train are just fantastic little micro builds the a build 4 things are coming together quickly the walls windows and doors get the first floor nearly done im still not big on the sand green and tan combo but i do really like the red and yellow awnings the a build 5 it appears the shop owner lives upstairs since weve got a bedroom forming here the bed is a little plain but the table and lamp on the other half are great and my big fingers did not like putting all those railings on the balcony with the telescope posts and tile tops knocked quite a few off before i got them all done the a build front and its done all the details make this set really feel like a minimodular the roofline has great greebling and the shop contents and on and on its not perfect though the tiny car above the toy store door isnt nearly as good as the toys inside and the kids yellow scooter the wheels arent even on the ground much less able to roll the scooter looks decent though so that counts for something well at least as long as you are at this angle since the boys only got 1 foot on the 1 stud wide scooter the a build inside most of the interior has been seen already the roof though does a nice job of being interesting for a roof a skylight the edge rails etc and you can see theres not much wrong color in the walls the a model sides an interesting building when folded up very tall and skinny you can tell its not really meant to be displayed this way  its meant to be open the good  lots i like the awning the diagonal door the flowerbox under the upper window the folding gate on the balcony that lets it be used in open or closed mode and the green  white  blue colors the bad  well the stairs end short of the upper door i still dont really like the tan doorframes i think black would have been better and why dont the upper floors match up in size the a model leftovers ah thats more like it just a few small pieces left as spares the errors you might have to click through to the fullsize versions but i did catch a few weird errors in the manuals first in the photo of the newsstand the map in the front corner is on there sideways the map does have a clear north arrow printed on it on the second image the boys feet are hanging off the edge just unusual to see an alignment error in the manual like that the comparison here are this set and the modular detective office side by side theres a huge difference  as youd expect but is the difference more than youd expect this set is 466 parts 40 the do is 2262 pieces and 160 5 times the parts 4 times the price looking at them side by side id expect a bigger difference in both the conclusion so whats my conclusion on this model i love the main model but the alternates are meh its a nice set for someone looking for a town building other than police and fire stations but who isnt ready to move to the modular line compared to the modulars though it seems overpriced part of that is because the huge modulars are actually a great deal compared to other lego sets im also a little surprised that its so small when you compare it to the city sets like a police station those are generally designed with much more open space letting them be more of a playset this one is small and cramped so itd be tougher to play in its not really a city set though the ratings value 710  its under the 10 cents a part mark but thats largely due to having a ton of tiny parts all those flowers and decorative 1x1 round studs add up quickly design 710  good and bad on the colors and theres a big difference between the quality of the main vs alternate models having so many leftover pieces is one thing when the creator set makes 3 very different models ie a boat plane and truck when its 3 buildings it seems wasteful to have so many parts leftover minifigs 610  im not sure they both fit the set i suppose the boy is going to the toy store and the woman is going to the grocery but theres no storekeeper in either the woman doesnt look like a storekeeper to me so thats why i assume shes another shopper i love the boy but the woman is just soso  except that i do appreciate the head having two very different expressions but again that doesnt fit the set i cant see her scared face being used playability 610  the shops are detailed with registers and so forth but its all so tiny itd be hard to play with the figs in it parts 910  tons of windows and doors plus nice sand green bricks but some things the large blue curves used on the roof for example are weirdly specialized and would be hard to use in another building design overall 710  id recommend doing what i did  build the alternates first then the main since thats how youll want to leave it id really like to see the price a little lower compared to other sets again the part count is inflated due to so many tiny parts and the finished building is tiny but its loaded with neat details	positive
great review very thorough its not a set which makes me run to tye store but it definitely has some fun elements i do like your new grey background your pictures look great	neutral
any chance you have a picture of the news stand next to the detectives office building as i would love to see the scaling for that	neutral
nice review mostlytechnic i particularly like the use of grey background surface for the pictures it somehow makes the building stand out more good job	neutral
a terrific very comprehensive review  but im not at all impressed with this set it feels like a mishmash of bricks with no clear design aesthetic and as such blatantly underdeveloped ie designed to hit a pricebrick count point rather than provide a solid set in the creator town tradition compared to other creator sets at this price point 31025  mountain hut for example it feels utterly uninspired and ugly edited by johnny6666 04 may 2015  1002 am	negative

lightningtiger on 04 may 2015  1255 pm said thanks mostlytechnic for this review i only brought this set to continue the shop series from creator in my opinion its only half as good as the bike shopcafe one plus it doesnt fit the same as that pair of shops oh well maybe next year lego creator will have a better one brick on review on mostlytechnic  well it is only half the price of the bikecafe one too  but i agree it seems odd that theyve made a couple shop creator sets that dont fit together in style like this i guess theyve done that for years with the creator houses though  none of those really work together david thomsen on 04 may 2015  0133 pm said reviews for this set really should picture them next to the bike shop  cafe which its intended to be compatible with right down to the size of the baseplates and grey tiles around the edge it doesnt look that great on its own but if you add the two sets together you get something that begins to look like a street scene interesting to get two comments right in a row with opposite opinions  i dont have the bikecafe set but to me they dont looks like theyd really go together theyre the same concept two buildings that fold in half but the sidewalk is different size and they just feel differently styled to me	negative
this seems like half of a set compared to the previous bike shopcafe as i like many of the elements i will probably buy a second one and build a mirror image version making one entirely a toy shop and the other a book storenews stand and adjust the sidewalks to work with the previous model then i think they will work well together i remember a little area in copenhagen that had this sort of architecture i would hope the subsequent models are better deigned to create more complex alternatives but these are both good starting points for original or enhanced models	neutral
as a fan of creator houses i really want to like this set however i think that creator houses have long filled a niche thats neglected elsewhere residential houses we havent had a larger residential house since 2013 im not sure if these sets have anything to do with that but it seems like they may be the replacement for larger houses and id much rather have a larger house set than a set like this i also agree with many others here something about it just feels incomplete i think that the various city business buildings weve gotten in recent years including those in this years city squarewhich is much more expensive than this but also contains much more make for better buildings at this scale	positive
thank you andy for your speed review y so theres nothing left to open while advent  i like all the tiny sets it neednt be another police and fireman   but well what would an advent calendar be without them d one thing about the train traffic lights tlc used to give us similar lights but you could show either of the lights with the other one being covered that one was waaay better  just a little piece more would have done the thing and i wont mention the radarcrapdish x let me quote franz beckenbauer is denn scho weihnacht legendary quote from an promotional job he did years ago  is it xmas already	neutral

im a big fan of anime and have watched some mechas like full metal panic neon evangelion genesis it is a mecha and chobits well she is a robot so i was curious to see what this new exo force line was all about the colorful sets and mangalike characters didnt persuade me right away but the urgent need for a couple of white 3x3 wing plates made me purchase this little thing it cost me 70 dkr as you can see on the box this is 930 euro or about the same an american has to pay for the new republic cruiser pretty expensive for so few pieces 90  a spare technic pin the box an actionpacked box with one of the sides being oddly empty except from the legologo whats inside there is a small building instruction two polybags no bag building here and a sticker sheet with alarmingly many stickers the build it takes so little time to build this set that i didnt get to take any pictures of the process every step was accompanied by an element description although i doubt most of you will need that with so few pieces to keep track on most of the dark green bricks have a sticker  even the slopes where the rough surface makes stickers fall off easily there should also have been a sticker on the windshield but i wanted to keep that piece clean for better usage later im one of those who keeps stickers on the bricks the model you want to see this model from the front as the back is pretty much neglected there isnt much for the pilot to grab a hold on either he is pretty much a sitting duck up there with the screen giving him only partial cover there is a huge wrench next to him which kind of symbolizes the crudeness of the mech the set isnt called cyclone defender for nothing the right arm might hold an ordinary light assault riffle but the other has a spinning disc with samurai swords which you can turn with the yellow knob on the backside those of you who have seen robot wars might remember the incredible power of this melee weapon from a robot named hypnodisc it would have been nice had there been a pullback motor to power the disc im sure lego has a lot of these in stock but the simple mechanism still works reasonably well the riffle comes off and a pin makes it easy to hold with the hand but the disc is fixed to the arm it is also a problem that the swords get misaligned quickly during play the minifig i really like this minifig because of the neat idea with an expression on each side that lego has made a standard for exo force posability most mechmocers show off their creations using gundamlike poses with two joints per leg one being the ankles and one for an arm i thought of some less serious poses crawling silent like a ninja belly gliding kick off upside down final rating i have to disappoint you here this is my first set in this line and i have absolutely no idea of how good it is the last robot i bought was the awesome 6889 spyrius recon robot for the same price but it is in a completely different genre the set had what i expected two white wings and is as such a nononsense set i guess it would be of more use if you have some more exo force which i dont 610 ups has great minifig weapons and is easy to build downs crude design and a bit too expensive for what you get brickshelf gallery	neutral
930 euro is msrp here in denmark 7 euro would have resulted in a nicer reception from my part but the strong marked position of lego in its homeland together with the general high prices because some of us are supposedly rich makes the prices less bearable it is funny you should mention germany i thought the prices for lego were even higher there im sure i paid more than msrp last time i bought lego from from your country on the other hand the last thing i bought was the 5521 model team sea jet from 1993	neutral

i couldnt find a review of this wonderful set in here so here it goes i got the set for msrp 180kr  24 euro which is a fair price here in denmark as all other creator sets there are instructions for several models 3 in this case the box the box is a little larger than city sets in the same price range the primary model is shown on the front while you see the secondary ones on the back what you get 312 pieces in 5 polybags and two building instructions one for the primary model and the other for the rest the built it was impossible for me to speed build this model because of the nifty functional details from the retractable landing gear to the wings that can turn by means of the handle in the back of the model it took me a full hour to build it because i had to test how it all works together the finished model the landing gear isnt fully enclosed when retracted and the models are subminifig scale but i still love the design of the models the doors for the rear wheels open as you pull the wheels down and the final piece of functionality comes from the wings that can either tilt the horizontal stabilizers or have elevators wing in wings out wings in wings out ratings as a whole i actually like this set even more than the big rig the models are just as diverse but the added functionality makes the plane more fun to play with than the rig price 710  a good price but not a bargain as the big rig design 910  there could have been a sligtly higher level of details in the main model but all models are really good looking and i especially like the design of the hovercraft functionality 1010  i guess you could ask for working rudders opening cockpit and so on but the plane is really filled with movable parts and the turning of the wings works really well secondary models 710  a hovercraft how awesome is that if only the last model was just as inventive instead of a standard helicopter modifiability 810  the bricks are in ordinary colours and there is a good variety of them giving you plenty of possibilities for mocing you can easily make the main model into something that looks more like an f14 910 probably as good as it gets for a creator set in this price range it is entertaining to both build and play with looks good and the secondary models are worth building as well brickshelf gallery	positive

it is no secret that marvel is one of the most successful companies right now from the avengers to the xmen and down to even the most obscure characters like antman every one of their movies has been a big hit until now the latest marvel movie fant4stic was released last month and while i have not seen it yet im sure its just as great as their other movies i mean it has the word fantastic in the title after all and being the smart business that they are the lego company decided to get in on the hype early and capitalize on this movies undoubtful success two years in advance by making a set featuring fant4stics main villain dr doom now thats what i call forward thinking but did they do a good job with it or were they being overhasty lets find out set number 76005 name spiderman daily bugle showdown theme marvel super heroes subtheme ultimate spiderman year of release 2013 pieces 476 minifigs 5 price 4999 usd sh description quote swing into the daily bugle and stop dr doom™ dr doom™ and his henchman beetle™ are attacking the daily bugle in their speedy jet to steal spidermans™ secret identity its up to spiderman™ and nova™ to swing in and stop them trigger the daily bugles explosion functions to cause destruction as the jet fires missiles stop dr doom™ from hitching the jets anchor hook to the safe with spidermans secret inside knock beetle™ off the building with the swinging web attack and drop dr doom™ inside with the rooftop trapdoor then fly nova™ in through the broken window with the dumpster catapult function and send those villains back to where they came from includes spiderman™ nova™ dr doom™ beetle™ and j jonah jameson™ with accessories and weapons the first thing that comes to mind after reading this description is wow thats a lot of tms anyway here are some resource links for this set brickset bricklink rebrickable the box since this set is based on the ultimate spiderman cartoon the box has the usual usm design with the red marvel super heroes background an illustration of spidey in the upper right corner and the usm logo in the lower right as usual there is a minifig line up in the lower left and since this was before the terrible redesign you can see the full body of the minifigs i really miss this type of line up there is quite a lot going on here doctor doom attacking the daily bugle in his jet while simultaneously reaching for j jonah jameson below with his jets claw spiderman reluctantly swings in to save him while nova fights off the beetle its a pretty cool scene even though its not very accurate to the show in beetle mania the episode that this set is based on the beetle was indeed out to kill jjj but it was in order to stop him from exposing his identity not spidermans although spidey was next on jjjs list and while he is a recurring villain on the show doctor doom had nothing to do with this plot and didnt even appear in the episode aside from a brief cameo its awesome that they included him anyway though so im not gonna complain note that the tower is so tall that it wraps around the top of the box there you can also see a scale reference with the spiderman minifig on the back of the box you can see the interior of the bugle and all of its play features which there are quite a few of since this is a playset its all illustrated pretty well although legos choice of sound effects is still a mystery to me i dont get why they dont go for spidermans signature fwip instead of fazzing and i didnt know that a breaking window made the sound btoom but i digress contents inside the box you will find three instruction booklets one smaller than the others a comic book a fairly large sticker sheet five numbered bags and two loose pieces a white string piece and a gray 16x8 plate there arent really any notable pieces and nobody cares about the comic bock no offense to the artist so lets get right to the instructions they are pretty straight forward and easy to follow some of the pages have a ghostly image of spidey nova and dr doom in the top right corner which is fitting since these are all minifigs that appear in this set which is strangely not something that can be said for many other super heroes instructions with this type of artwork minifigures as with most super heroes sets most people will get this set mainly for the minifigs so without further ado lets talk about them spiderman is the same old bootless one you get in almost every usm set not much to say about him some might complain that we dont get spideys alter ego peter parker in this set but in the usm cartoon mj is actually the one who works at the daily bugle not peter curse the creators of this cartoon for ruining our chances of getting a new peter parker minifig by trying to mix things up next we get j jonah jameson he appeared in a spiderman 2 set before but this is a complete redesign he now has a blue suit with a red tie a unique face print and that combedback hair in dark gray this new hairpiece doesnt suit him at all and the old flat top hair was perfect for him in my opinion so i dont know why they changed it the good thing about this change however is the fact that this piece is exclusive to this set in that color nova on the other hand is spoton he comes with a new helmet mold and some nice torso printing however he too is missing his boots tlc should have started making dualcolored legs a long time ago here are some reference images to compare them to okay so jjjs hair may not be completely black in the show but i still think they should have given his minifig a black hairpiece his suit is also not quite the right color he rarely appears in person in the show including the episode this set is based on and is usually seen on screens around new york so this is the best picture of him i could find i guess i should be happy they included a minifig of him at all in the episode it was actually mary jane who was at the bugle during beetles attack so it would have made more sense to include her but we got her in the spidercopter set one year later so thats ok all three of them have back printing in jjjs case im using that term loosely since it is only comprised of two lines but its nice that they went through the trouble of adding them both jjj and nova come with angry alternate faces it almost looks like theyre trying to outangry each other who do you think looks angrier let me know in the comments section below now lets talk about the bad guys even though he would be better off in a fantastic four set its great to finally get victor van doom one of the greatest marvel villains ever and in comics in general he comes with a dark green hood which was new and exclusive in that color at the time and he is the only minifig in this set that has leg printing beetle is a regular minifig with wings the metallic printing on his face and torso is pretty nice but i wish it would have continued onto his legs as well the beetle looks quite accurate to his onscreen counterpart the only thing that could have improved him is a new helmet mold with pointy eyebrowsantennae doctor doom however looks nothing like he does in the movie i just dont understand how lego could have messed him up so badly maybe they were working off of early concept art or something here is a back view of doom and beetle beetle would be a pretty boring minifig if it wasnt for his wings which are awesome with their holographic texture they are so mesmerizing i could look at those things all day this piece also appeared in trans light green in the galaxy squad sets which came out at the same time here they are without their gear as you can see they both have back printing as well and no doctor doom does not come with an alternate facial expression which is fine since you cant see much of his expressions due to his mask anyway heres a look at dr doom and nova without their headgear some say that dooms face looks too cartoony but i think it looks fine nova is wearing stylish goggles as a way of explaining his white eyes its a far better explanation than the batsweatband they did the same thing with the masked wolverine later here are all the figs with their accessories jjj comes with a camera so that he can take more pictures of spiderman beetle comes with one of those overused adu guns which is a very poor representation of his wristmounted blasters i hate to say it but even those bulky new stud shooters would have been a better representation of his weapons spidey comes with his usual string of webbing and nova comes with some iron man style translucent studs the weird thing is that they are red while his powers have a blue glow in the show doctor doom sadly doesnt get any accessories but who needs weapons when you have a jet with a claw and flickfire missiles the build the first bag contains spiderman a brick separator and the parts to build the ground floor of the dbc building after a quick and straightforward build you get this the dumpster and street lamp are separate from the building and since the lamp post is not built onto any baseplate and is quite topheavy it gets knocked over pretty easily maybe its meant to be that way but i would have preferred it if you could stick it onto the baseplate of the building on which there is unfortunately not enough space to do so as you would expect the second bag has the parts for the first floor of the building this is also the bag that contains beetle after another fairly simple build youll find yourself with a two story building with a spiderweb one side and a fire escape on the other however you have to apply three stickers during this section of the build which is never fun can you guess whats in bag number 3 yup the second floor of the building you dont need superpowers to predict that one also this bag contains nova and jameson the build of this section is a bit repetitive since the second floor is mostly the same as the first and it takes slightly longer to build since you have to build the rooftop as well also in addition to the two window stickers you have to apply ten 2x2 tile stickers trying to do this without having any of them being crooked is a real pain in the megablocks the next bag contains doctor doom and the cockpit of his jet dooms cape is in the usual square white box and the string for the claw is folded up in a piece of tape heres what you get at the end of this section looks more like an escape pod than a jet at this point the final bag is the smallest as it only includes the few parts needed to finish the doom jet once you build the wings and tail you stick them onto the cockpit via technic pins and youre done spare parts these are the parts that are left over after the build there is the brick separator of course an extra antenna and the usual little bits and bops whats really awesome though is that they give you an extra pair of beetles wings considering what a neat piece this is and that this is the only set in which it comes in transblack make this a very welcome spare that you can use in your customs the finished set here is the complete set the dbc building looks quite tall especially when you count the antenna comparing it to a screenshot from the episode the general look of the building is there although there are some inaccuracies aside from the fact that it is obviously way downscaled the screens that show jjj ranting about spiderman should have been hexagonal not square and should have wrapped around the building however considering how many stickers you would have had to apply if they would have made it accurate im actually glad they kept the screen mercifully small much like doctor doom himself the doom jet didnt actually appear in the beetle mania episode however it did appear in a later episode titled not a toy in which spiderman plays around with captain americas shield accidentally drops it in doctor dooms latvarian embassy and has to try to retrieve it and yes that episode was as godawful as it sounds heres a screenshot of the jet from that episode like with the dbc they managed to capture the general shape of the vehicle although it doesnt look quite as good as in the show the color scheme is too dark and it looks kind of blockier lets take a closer look at the jet there is no real way to reel the claw in unfortunately however there is a stud on the back of the jet that you can stick it onto needless to say this is not the ideal way of storing it i would have much preferred it if they would have attached it onto winch instead the engines on the wings can be turned even though they dont turn in the show and there is a flickfire missile on each side even if its not much to look at at least its a very swooshable vehicle on top of each wing there is a tile with the emblem of latvaria there was no such emplems on the jet in the cartoon but they are useful pieces that make it clear whose jet it is so im glad they included them there is nothing inside the cockpit except for a seat and unless you want to ruin dr dooms nice dark green cape i wouldnt put him inside of it they could have at least printed a control panel onto that empty 2x2 tile play features since this is a playset lets look at all the play features it has to offer like all playsets the building is open in the back so you can play inside on the ground floor there is a potted plant and nothing else seriously is this all they could come up with for this floor they could have included a security desk a lounge a second plant or anything else as it is its just a boring empty lobby the first floor is a bit more interesting there is a safe a swiveling chair and a pin board with various pictures of spiderman there is one tile that reads the true identity of spiderman which is supposedly what the villains are after i wonder how jameson got this information in the first place speaking of jameson the second floor is devoted to his office where he can sit and yell at his nonpresent employees demanding more pictures of spiderman it also has a swiveling chair as well as a desk with a lamp and a computer there is a technic beam connecting his desk with the ceiling of the first floor which you can remove in order to take off the upper half of the building but its difficult to do so i dont recommend it as you may have noticed in the picture above there are a few red pegs sticking out of the building these are for triggering the play features most of them are on the roof there is one on what looks like an air conditioning unit if you place spiderman holding is webstring on the jumper plate in front of it and push the peg spidey goes bungeejumping off the building wee there is also one that sticks out of the side of the building which when pulled triggers a trap door the third red peg on the roof can be used to pop off the dbc sign why is it called the dbc you ask it stands for daily bugle communications since in this version of spiderman the daily bugle is not only a newspaper but a news tv station as well one that promotes its own highly biased views so basically the fox news of the marvel universe i guess if youre an old school spiderman fan you could just leave off the c and have it just stand for daily bugle the sign above the main entrance wont be so easily modified however there is also a peg between the first and second floor which when pushed pops out one of the windows on the first floor the safe is only attached to a couple of jumper plates and has some jumper plates on top of it as well so you can easily attach the doom jets claw to it and rip it out of the building as seen on the back of the box there are also some snot bricks on the corners of the building that you can attach spiderwebs or spidey himself onto for some wallcrawling and webslinging action this is not so much a play feature as it is just a feature but as i mentioned earlier there is a fire escape on the left side of the building this was a neat idea as it helps it feel like a building in new york city but it is executed very poorly there is no hole big enough for the minifigs to climb down through so they would have to climb down the ladders from the outside which makes no sense no wonder spiderman always needs to rescue people from burning buildings there is one more play feature in the form of the dumpster you can open the lid put a minifig inside and make them jump by hitting a tab in the back remember this is before the introduction of super jumpers but nevertheless its a pretty strange place to launch minifigs out of i guess even super heroes like to do some dumpster diving you dont think this was funny no well me neither but thats the type of humor that this show loves to use sigh anyway lets get on to the ratings ratings design 25  the set looks ok despite many inaccuracies the dbc building and the jet somewhat resemble their onscreen counterparts and dont look too bad but they definitely could be better build 15  a mostly unchallenging and repetitive build with an attrocious amount of stickers minifigs 45  definitely the strongest point of the set some of the figs could be better but four out of five of them are exclusive to this set doctor doom is easily the best and probably the most desirable one  unless the fant4stic movie portraits him so badly that nobody will be interested in him but thats impossible playability 45  as you would expect from a playset the playability is quite high although i still feel like there could have been more parts 35  not many rare parts if youre looking for parts for building your own skyscraper with tan walls and lots of doors and windows though this set is for you price 35  at 476 parts for 50 this set is a bit pricey but it is somewhat justified by all the large window and wall pieces overall 35  this set is mediocre at best playsets are always a good choice for spiderman sets since they give spidey something to swing from but unfortunately they are rarely pulled off well the jet is blocky the building is barebones and the price feels too high the only reason to get this set are the four exclusive minifigs this set was discontinued early this year but if you still see it on clearance somewhere go ahead and get one for the minifigs and parts or buy multiples and use the parts to build a better dbc building i hope you enjoyed this review it is part of the reviewers academys 7th anniversary were not doing a big celebration this year due to other commitments but look out for more reviews with the 7th anniversary banner soon now if youll excuse me i am off to see fant4stic i hope its as fantastic as it promises to be 2 hours later i was wrong i was horribly horribly wrong	positive

personally i thought your review was spot on and i very much enjoyed your tone im not usually much of a minifig person but i will admit i bought this set mostly for dr doom and considered nova a bonus growing up i was a big fan of the fantastic four and an even bigger fan of dr doom i hope that someday the film rights will revert to marvel and well finally get a ff film that respects the original source material and features a dr doom worthy of the name as for the set itself i dont have much use for playsets not that theres anything wrong with them i think the marvel lego line could use more of them in fact and i didnt even realize it was linked to a specific show as ive fallen a bit out of touch with the franchise of late i bought it i built it it sat a shelf for a while i scrapped it for parts i think most of it wound up as a greenhouse for my winter village setup its not a bad set but i think you summed things up nicely when you called it mediocre thanks for the entertaining review	neutral
thanks for the reviewim not a big fan of spider man sets but this set really impressed me this must because of the design of this set and the minifigures that included in this set	positive
i think im the only person in the world who likes fant4stic was it the best superhero movie not even close but i didnt think it deserved the hate it got it was just incredibly and clumsily mishandled anyways great review i might pick this one up if only for the beetle fig	negative
this set seems to appeal more to the non superhero crowd it is one of the only marvel sets i bought mainly because i thought that the building was a nice return to the old style of city sets i would love to see this sort of backdrop for a more realistic agents theme i also liked that most of the figs in this set were easier to merge into other nonsuper uses thanks for the review god bless nathan	neutral

tks for that comparison pic dunamis  ok the box is big  i pictured it a tad smaller though  i know what i dont like its the fact that it has the regular lego star wars logo on top with vader ucs sets should have a different iconography like they did in the past sure its a trivial detail but it adds to the fact of owning something special  after all its the most expensive set ever as of now  happy building  and well wait patiently for some cool pics later on p yoda	negative
the manual the gigantic manual measures 17 x 12 and is almost an inch thick it is spiral bound with a cardboard like front and back and it is 314 pages interesting decision not to break it up into multiple manuals it is almost unwieldy at this size and thickness unfortunately the manual is not available electronically from the lego website hopefully it will be soon missing were the little instructions at the beginning telling you to not build this beast on shag carpet and to sort out the 5000 pieces before you get started i guess they figure if you got 500 to spend on this thing you can build it however you want as usual we get the regular lego manual features  piece call outs for each step  parts inventory at the end of the manual  page numbers  photos of all the other 2007 sets at the end of the manual manual paperback book provided for scale various manual photos 8x8 plate provided for scale im about 2 hours into building and sorting im trying to stay a day ahead in my posting the build has been easier than i thought so far despite the massive number of pieces it has not been too hard to sort and find what you need build photos will start appearing in tomorrows entry	positive
wow i never thought id be impressed by a box but i certainly am now any chance of seeing all 5000 bricks in a big pile vader on sep 28 2007 1014 am said my gawd that manuel is huge thats enough to put a sane man off of buying this setthank gawd none of us are sane thats all i can say xd too true never had i imagined thinking about buying a 350 lego set beforechristmas is soo close yet soo far	positive
nice idea reviewing the set while constructing it this is the top of the bill for any legocollector also financially speaking and i like the look of all those thousands of pieces the manual is incredible i thought i had a really thick manual coming with set 8479 but this one exceeds it with ease review on	positive
xwingyoda on sep 28 2007 0734 am said tks for that comparison pic dunamis  ok the box is big  i pictured it a tad smaller though  yoda i dont have the ucs isd but from the pic i can see that it is about the same thickness slightly shorter but much wider than the mf so this leads me to believe that dimensionwise the ucs mf is more compact also notice how in the content the parts fit in just nice without additional spare space for anything else strange isnt it that when tlc is responsible for the shipping we see optimum usage of box spaces xd imagine if all boxes were this efficient 499 sets would be no bigger than a match box xd xd the mtt would be reduced to 14 its current size xd xd xd	neutral
great review so far i am looking forward to additional posts as for the number of pins  from the peeron inventory for the set there are over 400 technic pins of various lengths insert the my fingers hurt from building emoticon keep the pictures coming	positive
the build the build is going quicker than i thought i am sorting as i open the bags that i need some bags are in multiples so it is easy to pick them out the build is a tad repetitive as the framework of the ship is somewhat symmetrical here are some progress shots note that two plates 1x4 and 1x8 are stacked in between technic beams then the part below is assembled to hold the structure together this took about an hour of sorting and building ill post another update tomorrow	positive
the minifigs as you can see the minifigs are really nice they even throw in an extra fleshie head no doubt these will fetch quite a bit on the bricklink and ebay markets im keeping mine continuing the build this photo shows how well this model is put together notice that they use four of the threehole beams per side to hold this together i remember reading that you can hang this model from the ceiling i dont doubt it these right angle technic pieces are used to reinforce the structure of the model you can see them used here i was shocked at how many light gray plates are in this set i have two tubs full of these the infrastructure is now complete i got hung up for about an hour looking for one of these turns out lego gave me an extra left wedge and shorted me a right wedge so frustrating i had to stead one off my 6211 star destroyer it is not a very common piece by the way	neutral
hey nice review im up to about the same point as you page 70 to be exact  tho i didnt have that missing piece thankfully i think lego have done a much better job at packing the lego this time i remember it taking me much longer to find pieces on the ucs isd build	positive
so i see they even do mistakes on these  that beast looks really sturdy  that is great  are these yellow parts new  i am not a technic fan and never saw these before another question for you is the instruction book easy to follow especially regarding the colours does the black rally stands out comparing to the dark bley and so on  i sure hope so  cant wait to see moer hehe yoda	neutral
xwingyoda on sep 30 2007 1157 am said are these yellow parts new  i am not a technic fan and never saw these before you dont have the building crane 7905 either same color same shape there piece no 32555 four of them included i assume youre not a town fan p 	neutral
i have been taking photos for this review for a few months and i finally took the rest of the photos last night all the parts if you want tan this is the set to get main model the garage is a great addition but the car only just fits the main house is very nice looking the windows extend to the sides but not the back the chimney and drainage work very well and i love the basement i think the front works very well when i was making this i was multitasking doing weight training do a set do a step do a set and i ended up missing one of the row paths i discovered this after i finished the basement  the removable roof reveals byo floors probably why this is called a model house the roof was quite interesting to build this is my first large house set so it all was very new to me i love the garage door more nice pipework this photo i misfocused but there isnt much to see anyway the door is a nice touch the grill to the right on both sides is not just decoration as it hides the hinges for the door i also made one of the submodels i was considering keeping this but i decided against it once again the sides have windows but the back doesnt the truck is there to make the photo more worthwhile the roof to this one doesnt come off easily as all the tiles are used for the front just to clarify these houses arent attached so you can arrange them however you want the fronts are quite elaborate and it seems that lego were trying to make this almost like a simpler market street the truck is too small for a minifig but it probably was my favourite car thoughts i highly recommend this set in most countries it is good value for money including australia the design is excellent and three instructions are included the third is a school if anyone has made it and wants to post photos feel free at least one person at eb has made it i love how each house has its own car due to the way the primary model is made it is a bit weak at the corner but that was a design choice my only real complaint about this set is how lego is going though a mould transition and thus some roof slopes are rough others are smooth i can accept either and lego has been moving to smooth slopes for years now but to have a set with about 5050 is annoying the mtt was the same but that is my only gripe with this excellent set wub	positive
thanks for the review and tons of pics ive been wanting to pick this one up since i saw it i thought the 4956 creator house was nice but this model town house is in a completely different league i also like the alternate models that you can see in the catalogues	positive
thank you for the review sinner at first i wanted this set for the 4 blue 1x1 slope tiles but i can see there is much more into it than that it sure is a great value compared to what you get in the building bonanzas no cars and less detail it was funny to see the little side story in your pictures would it be hard to modify the cars to fit minifigs better	neutral
a beautiful and humorous review with very fine pics y a fantastic set full of neat details and in a wonderful color scheme great for every city builder for sure i guess we waited for sets like that we dreamed about them im glad we got them now  edit congrats it seems youve got your bucket back p	positive
i found the use of parts well done by the designers i made a car and then tried to make a house from a different instruction book i could not as several pieces were already used in the car nice to see them using all the parts like that rather than having a lot of extra bits moral of the story one instruction book at a time sweet	neutral
lasse d on sep 28 2007 0803 am said it sure is a great value compared to what you get in the building bonanzas no cars and less detail i was all for the white house until i saw this set i still wouldnt mind it though d lasse d on sep 28 2007 0803 am said would it be hard to modify the cars to fit minifigs better the problem with the blue truck is a lack of headroom however the truck is quite low and i cant see it being too hard to change and still have it looking good asuka on sep 28 2007 0830 am said great for every city builder for sure i guess we waited for sets like that we dreamed about them im glad we got them now  i think lego were really listening with this years creator sets wub with the exception of the ferris wheel they are all sets that you could buy 10 of and not have too many hard to use parts asuka on sep 28 2007 0830 am said edit congrats it seems youve got your bucket back p well in this reality anyway xd who knows what goes on in the wacker and walrus world but i do seem to be a tormented soul 	neutral
awesome review luckily you have two cute little friends and one beautiful lady to help you out p i likewise love wub this set and your review does it credit i laughed outloud a lot as i read it i especially love you trying to look through the windowless back d d d great job now sort that out and start building for our competition xd	positive
thanks for the review sinner y  although we had a not very detailed one already p i bought this set at tru with 20 off resulting in 54 xd definitely a must buy for every townie you get tons of useful parts to build other buildings as well shameless selfpromotion off  you have to love tan bricks though 8 moc on	positive
i too have bought this set and the only thing i notice which is a bit odd with the exception of there being no floors in the house is the lack of a steering wheel in the car	negative
thanks for the review sinner i definitely want this set now the mixed rough and smooth roof bricks would annoy me on a model like the mtt but here it looks as is if the roof is quite old with some parts being worn and pitted and some parts being replaced with new roof tiles i quite like the effect i agree on which is the best vehicle and if it doesnt fit minifigs just mod the heck out of it xd	positive
sinner you have convinced me i bought this set yesterday when it was on sale at international lego weekend in skrbk	positive
sweet looks like an awesome set i might get it i have to see looks like it has a lot of good parts zots	positive

sinner thanks for this outstanding review i am glad that i had read this review in advance before making my purchase on this set earlier with my girlfriend we built this set for a total of 3 hours to complete this beauty in about 2 hours ago there are stars circling around my head at this very moment when i post this reply i must admit from the bottom of my heart that this is an wonderful piece of house that simply shows the beauty of it with the european kind of houses where there is a garage furthermore there is a lovely blue car i am seeing stars right now in the middle of the night and i must drop a thanks to you personally as well although it is empty from its interior unlike the 4996 beach house but this set has the majestic look which simply place a wow factor in front of it upon completion at the moment we had plans for getting the second set next month to build the other design as well hopefully i will be able to share with you guys all of my different creators sets with its alternate designs as well in the near future	positive

its that time of year again when the days get shorter the nights get colder and children all around the world stare longingly into warmly lit toy shops and prepare their wishlist to send to santa this is also the time when the lego group releases their latest winter village set which has been an annual tradition for the past seven years these sets have been very popular especially among afols and are always highly anticipated however while some entries in this series have been more popular than others none has been as controversial as this years set the winter toy shop which is a rerelease of the first winter village set 10199 winter toy shop from 2009 it seems that many think that this set didnt need to be remade and would have preferred a new set instead or that it is not different enough from the original and will be redundant in a completionists collection does it deserve all the hate lets find out disclaimer i dont own the 2009 version so i cant compare them visually but i will do my best to let you know what is different in this version if you do need a visual reference you can refer to sveltes excellent review of the original set number 10249 name winter toy shop theme creator year of release 2015 pieces 898 minifigs 8 price £5999  7999  6999€ sh description quote welcome to the winter toy shop the holiday season has arrived and the toymaker is busy finishing off his latest creations outside children ski and snowboard and a freshly built snowman sparkles in the light that shines from the toyshop tower help decorate the huge tree that stands at the center of the square play with the curious kitten on the cozy wooden bench or join in with the carolers beneath the ornate streetlamp this charming set also features a ladder trees in various sizes jackinthebox a toy biplane helicopter rocket train race car truck robot tugboat teddy bear and a wrapped gift have fun building this enchanting winter wonderland includes a snowman and 8 minifigures with assorted accessories a male caroler female caroler a woman 2 men 2 boys and a girl sh bricklink brickset the box the box art of this set is similar to that of the original but there are some notable differences the christmas tree is on the right side of the image this time while the park bench is on the left and of course it features this years design for creator boxes with the dark blue stripe along the right side and the expert logo in the top right corner theres also a small picture of the back of the toy shop and the background looks less cartoony than on the original the back is also very similar showing a different angle of the toy shop along with some closeups although this time there is no minifig lineup instead the minifig lineup is on the right side of the box it also includes the accessories that each minifig comes with and some of the toys on the left side of the box there is a thumbnail of the box art and the set name in six different languages they also want to make sure that you know that there are batteries included by saying it in dozens of languages the top of the box features the inventory and a 11 scale reference with the female caroler on the bottom there is a picture that reminds you that there is a light brick included in this set in case that wasnt clear from the front of the box and it confirms that yes it is a bad idea to put it in water in case you were planning to go swimming with your winter toy shop the contents inside the box there are two instruction booklets and two groups of bags one for each instruction booklet while two groups of bags is not as many as there usually are in other sets of this size its still better than the first version of this set where the bags werent numbered at all so this makes the build a bit easier the large bag in group 1 and the two large bags in group 2 have a white stripe going down the middle of the bag and only have one group number printed on it along with some other number and some kind of scan code i have no idea why they made this distinction for these bags or what that code is for so if any of you know the purpose of this please let me know in the comments below here is a random instructions page as you can see the building steps can get quite challenging as they sometimes include many different pieces in one step especially when it uses a lot of brown pieces which are very dark and hard to see in the instructions living up to the sets status as an expertlevel set most of the time though the instructions are pretty clear and easy enough to follow there are some parts in new colors in this set that werent in the first version or any other set until now such as that large flat technic arch in dark green the jester hat in orange and blue one of those new 2z2 round jumper tiles in brown a golden frog and a snowboard in dark blue there are also some rare friends parts that make their creator debut here such as the skis in azure and that new clear 1x1 round tile with a tiny tube coming out of it which is usually used as a stand for friends accessories and is a very useful piece especially for snot techniques and no im not talking about the type of snot that many people usually have stuck in their nose around this time of year there are some printed parts as well such as the clock tile the letter tile and the register slope like in the first version of the set we also get a new face print for the white cat which is more in line with other modern cat designs but the best part is the shop sign which is printed this time around it features a lovely wood pattern the words toy shop and a toy soldier on both sides of the sign which is ironic since the shop doesnt seem to sell any toy soldiers like this but it looks so good on the sign that i wont sue them for false advertising the minifigs lets start with the most unique figures in this set the carolers these two were also the highlight in the first version of the set but in the original they both had the same head this one   which featured a very questionable facial expression that could easily be taken out of context in this version they have unique faces which look much better and help distinguish their gender the male caroler uses lord vampyres torso which looks quite snazzy on him maybe this is lord vampyre before he became a vampire the female caroler is easily the best minifig in the set though because in addition to her exclusive head she also gets an exclusive torso and skirt print a huge improvement over the generic unprinted one in the original she also gets the queen hair in dark brown and aragorns lined cape instead of two combined regular capes this set truly is the return of the queen the snowman is technically not a minifig but as you can see here he is exactly as tall as one and he is the first thing you build after the minifigs so i included him here he has mostly the same design as before except this time he has robot claws for arms instead of levers which is good since they allow him to hold accessories such as his broom his carrot nose is included separately again the carolers both have back printing while the snowman looks no different from the back than he does from the front here you can see the black side of the females cape this lined cape is so much nicer than the solution they used in the original next up we have what i assume is a married couple who are likely the parents of at least one of the kids as well as the toymaker who i will call geppetto the man in the pinstripe suit was not included in the first version of the set so hes a bonus minifig these guys are fairly generic but they have some detailed torso prints so they look pretty nice geppetto seems to have gotten younger since the release of the original set since his gray hair has now turned dark tan and he doesnt seem to need glasses anymore the men both have back printing but the woman is the only one in this set who doesnt get a back print why you gotta be so discriminating against women lego last but not least there are the kids one of the boys wears dark blue pants a green jacket and a wool cap he looks a bit like a lumberjack so lets call him lumberjack boy or jack for short the little girl wears an outfit that wouldnt look out of place in the friends theme with a lavender scarf and pants ill call her lavender the second boy is wearing an octan jacket and a sports helmet which makes it ironic that he is the one not doing any winter sports on the box art ill call him president business junior or pbj for short all of the kids have fairly detailed back printing which makes up for the fact that much like the adults they are made out of mostly common parts pbjs helmet and scarf cover up the back of his head nicely which is important as you will see in the next picture whats also great about these figs is that half of them have a doublesided head here you can see pbj doing his best macaulay culkin impression i also removed his scarf so you can see the printing on his torso better but hes not the only one who seems to be easily scared the mother also has a very alarmed expression maybe she got surprised by the jackinthebox or maybe she just realized how expensive toys are nowadays you can see the female carolers back printing here her alternate expression is a nonsinging face which is very nice to have and i wish the male caroler could have one too she looks quite cute with those rosy cheeks but the most adorable out of all of them has to be the little girl she comes with a pouting sad face that will melt your heart please dont cry ill buy you any toy you want just stop looking at me like that the build the first half of the build is dedicated to the surroundings of the toy shop it includes the christmas tree the park bench the snowman the toys the carolers jack and lavender the large bag contains two smaller bags with small pieces a white box that contains the carolers cape and the jester hat in its own little bag the first thing you build after the minifigs and the snowman is the toys this version of the set has a lot more toys than the original which is good because i always felt that the first toy shop was a bit light on toys also the ones that were in the original have been updated for example instead of the two pairs of skis you now get one pair of skis that use the new ski mold and a snowboard the jackinthebox is mostly the same except it now has an orange and blue color scheme instead of the red and blue from the original this change was probably not necessary but hey at least we get a new jester hat out of it and instead of the brickbuilt teddy bear you get the new teddy bear mold i have mixed feelings about this change because i actually kinda liked the brickbuilt teddy design and using a specialized mold seems to be going against the spirit of creator sets but on the other hand i cant deny that the molded teddy looks better than the blocky old one meh the new toys include a tugboat which has some rounded technic pieces as its hull a biplane a rocket a helicopter and a truck that cleverly uses roller skates for its wheels these are all quite brilliant designs that feel like micro versions of lego city sets and make a great addition to the set here is a back view of some of the more complex models as you can see the friends accessory stand has been cleverly used to hold the biplanes fin in place and to provide a stand for the helicopter the jackinthebox has a hinged lid the only thing that bugs me a bit is the tpiece on top of the helicopter that holds the rotor in place but i cant think of any better way they could have done it next is the ladder that is used to decorate the tree which is exactly the same as the first version the supports are on a clickhinge so they can be adjusted or folded away then you build the tree itself you begins of course with the stand which is mostly the same design as before but this time the plates at the bottom are brown instead of white and have golden studs as feet next you build the first layer of branches the main difference in this version of the tree is that this one actually has a brown stem rather than just a technic axle on which you stack the layers of branches one by one you wont be able to see the stem in the final result but i like this change as it makes the tree more realistic then you add the second layer of branches this one doesnt have lightscandles and attaches to the lower layer at an angle using the four transyellow studs close to the stem the third layer is added this one has lights again each layer is similar in that they are all made out of green plates that are built around a 4x4 ring plate but they get smaller each time and are constructed differently enough for the build not to feel repetitive with the addition of the fourth layer we get close to finishing the tree lastly you add one more layer and the tip of the tree now its time to decorate the tree however its not as fun as it sounds since that requires you to add lights to the two chainsropes first which can get a bit repetitive the clips holding the lights to the chain were white but this time theyre pearl gold which looks much nicer in my opinion the next part of the build is the park bench with the streetlamp and the little tree this is a fairly quick build with not much to it the fishbowl helmet parts are a useful piece that you dont see too often so its nice to get them again in this remake the design is pretty much the same as in the original set except for the wreaths on the streetlamp which use a green life preserver instead of a round 2x2 plate this is another instance where they use a specialized piece instead of a brickbuilt solution but im okay with that because unlike with the teddy bear this part was not originally intended to be a wreath so its still nice part usage the second half of the build is dedicated to the toy shop itself and includes the couple geppetto and pbj please note that there is a fourth 6x10 plate burried under the parts you begin by tiling the floor setting up the walls and adding the interior items such as the fireplace the cash register and the toy displays next you add the walls windows and the door and the ground floor of the shop is finished so far the build is the same as the old toy shop except this time they decided to have the white stripes on the marquees be the longer ones instead of the dark red ones for some reason i dont know why they did this and kinda would have preverred to get dark red 1x1 plates instead of white but it doesnt detract from the look of the shop so i dont really care now we begin with the upper floor this is where things start to look a little different can you tell the difference the difference is that this time they attach the roof using cliphinges instead of bulky technic constructions which gives you more space on this floor and allows it to look more like an actual attic they even tile the floor next to the frog clock aftter adding the roof the build is finished the main roof feels a bit loose since its only attached to the building by one side im not sure if this was an issue in the old toy shop but its not a big deal i just wouldnt pick the set up by the roof what i do like is that they used double cheese slopes on the awning on the outer wall of the tower instead of singles which makes it a bit easier to build i like how the supports under the tower roof now match those of the main roof the wreaths have also been updated like the ones on the streetlamp and those technic arches under the roof look a lot more like garlands now on the original they were dark gray so i didnt even know they were supposed to be garlands and assumed they were part of the architecture the shop sign looks a lot better now that it is printed the old one just looked like a white flag i also like how the small plates under the marquee give it a wavy look and they included two trees in different sizes on the right side of the shop the back is nice and open and allows you to see the rest of the toys the robot train and race car all of which have just as much of a simple and clever design as the other toys the clock looks much nicer with the new golden frog because golden frogs make everything better spare parts there are quite a few small parts left over including a roller skate and one of those friends accessory stands which will come in handy the complete set here you can see the full set together it looks quite nice and festive with all the little details and there are many scenes that you can play out with it you can have the minifigs decorate the tree have the kids play in the snow have the carolers sing by the bench have the toymaker build some toys in his workshop or have the parents buy presents for their kids its a festive toyfilled winter wonderland the fireplace looks cozy and i like the brick pattern going up the chimney the entrance of the shop looks a bit empty aside from the cash register i feel like they could have displayed some more toys here but oh well being a set targeted at teens and adults there arent really any play features aside from the light brick which is attached to a hinge so you can either activate it by pressing the button with your finger or tilting the brick upward so that the button is pressed against the roof however since the roof is not connected in the middle and only attached on the sides it tends to split open a bit when you do that so im not sure if attaching the roof this way here was such a good idea nevertheless it looks quite nice when the light is lit ratings design 55  this set is as gorgeous as it was back in 2009 the small updates that they made are mostly good ones although the absence of a brickbuilt teddy is a bit disappointing and the new way the roof is attached while not as bulky as before makes the roof slightly unstable but those are just nitpicks build 55  there are some interesting building techniques here such as those on the tree the roof and the toys the fact that the parts are only split into two groups and the part callouts can get fairly complex makes it a challenging enjoyable build minifigs 55  they did a great job updating the figs in this set while only 3 of the torsos in the original had any printing all of the torsos have printing front and back in this set even the skirt and cape of the female caroler you get two exclusive heads and half of the heads are doublesided plus you get 8 instead of 7 minifigs you really cant ask for more in a creator set playability 45  this set is more meant to be displayed than to be played with but there are plenty of things to play with if you want all the different minifigs accessories and set pieces make for endless possibilities for play its especially fun to swoosh the micro vehicles around parts 35  there are lots of good parts here most of them are fairly common but there are some rare parts and some even in exclusive colors price 45  this set costs 20 more than the original but considering that this set has nearly 900 pieces including some rare and exclusive ones as well as more minifigs with much better printing i think 80 is still a fair price overall 55  so whats my opinion of this set for a remake i think its great they managed to make a good set even better are the changes minor yes are they an improvement mostly yes were they necessary perhaps not but its good that they made them instead of just rereleasing the exact same set so if you didnt get the first winter toy shop i can highly recommend getting this one if you do already have the old version this one might still be worth picking up for the hugely improved minifigs and rare parts alone as for the controversy over rereleasing the winter toy shop i can see where the haters are coming from but i find their complaints to be quite petty i can understand if youre disappointed because you already have the first winter toy shop and were looking forward to a new set this year but theres always next year if youre a completist and feel like tlg is forcing you to buy a set you dont need youre wrong nobody is forcing you to buy anything but yourself if you decide to buy every set in a theme no matter what it is thats your problem not legos so put down your torches and pitchforks and just be glad that they improved the set design and gave us another chance to buy this classic set there are far worse things that can happen in this world than lego rereleasing one of their most popular sets sorry for that little rant so what is your opinion on rereleases like this please cast your vote in the poll above i hope you enjoyed this special eurobricks reviewers academy review and would like to thank the lego group for the opportunity to review this set happy holidays everyone battoys by okay yaramanoglu on flickr	positive
great review you almost make me want to buy one i dont know what it is with these sets on the one hand they are so nicely designed and cute on the other side i never seriously consider buying one i cant explain what it is that holds me back	positive
great review i just built the original and this one has clear advantages over the original though i wish lego would stop putting torsos with defined breasts and curves on children i really like pretty much every change i wont be getting it and id be lying if i said im not a little disappointed for the first four years my motherinlaw got me the new winter village set for christmas after the last two which didnt really fit thematically in my display i had hoped for a new oneparticularly since my daughter is getting to be around the age where she can play with them i mention her specifically because ive seen lots of people dismiss those who are a bit disappointed as rabid adults who dont care about kids getting cool sets and i dont think thats fair i may have to see how much some of the parts go for on bricklink the rerelease is better than the original but not good enough that id want to spend 80 to get a set thats nearly identical to one i have edited by tea weevil 29 november 2015  0431 pm	neutral

great review thanks oky imo the only significant improvements over the 2009 version are the figures toys and printed shop sign as i already have the older one ill have to give this one a pass	neutral
regarding the reason for the different designs on the inner bags i think that the white stripe is the new version with the nonstripe version being old i suspect the reason some sets have both versions is simply that theyre still using up some of their supply of older bags good review i didnt realise there were quite as many changes as you highlighted tree roof etc	positive
thanks for the excellent review unfortunately it only highlights how minimal the upgrades are though they are nice definitively a pass for me lets hope lego does continue to make the more realistic winter village sets versus santa im not opposed to a rehash the post office could use some improvements for example but this one is just a wee bit minimal	negative
i missed out on the first one but i love the improvements made in this version like the tree having an actual brown trunk so it looks less like an artificial one and the carolers as well i may pick this up but im sorry to those of you who already have one	positive
thanks for the review they definitely improved upon the original but since i already own the original i cant justify this set also unfortunately it seems to be the trend but im sure there are a lot of first timers out there too that will snatch this up since it is a really lovely building and the updates make it better for sure	neutral
thanks oky for this fine review i agreed with your sentiments on the unnecessary rants i also owned the 2009 version and even though there are minor improvements there must be a logical reason for its release again but is not entirely the same i felt is an excellent opportunity for others to acquire this design especially after six years ago as for myself i will probably buy this if my spare funds allow me to own this set	neutral
i didnt own the original toy shop so i bought it this time around i just finished building it saturday and i love it however i wish they had both rereleased this one and came out with a new addition to the village 	positive
review  42044  display team jet introduction the smallest of the 2016 sets is the display team jet it doesnt seem to have lots of functionality but maybe the landing gear is retractable this set kind of reminds me to the 9394  jet plane although its obviously a lot smaller as you can read in my review of the 42052  heavy lift helicopter basically anything flying is 1 for me so lets find out if this set also fits the bill note all images can be clicked for hires versions set information number 42044 title display team jet theme technic released 2016 part count 113 box weight 193 gr box dimensions 154 cm x 138 cm x 59 cm set price msrp € 999 price per part € 0088 links brickset bricklink the box being a small set it obviously comes in a small box the display team jet is an aerobatics jet used in air shows on the box its flying rather high but at least its at a safe distance from the crowd front side shows the main model together with a small section indicating you can use digital building instructions to build this model back side the back side shows the bmodel a stunt plane and again a reference to the apps for digital building instructions more on the stunt plane later content of the box the box contains 2 instructions booklets a and bmodel 1 sticker sheet 3 technic liftarms 2 bags instruction booklets both the instructions for the a and bmodel are included in the box sticker sheet a lot of stickers for such a small set apparently no panel is left untouched liftarms three liftarms unsealed nothing out of the ordinary for a small set bags two bags containing the rest of the parts highlighted parts this section describes the new andor otherwise interesting parts yellow 5l axles the 5l axle in yellow has never been released before so its one of the new parts for this year black 7l flex axles for the layman this seems a common part but the 7l soft axle actually has never been released in black before combined with the rerelease of the 19l soft axle in black this will open up lots of possibilities for those of you thinking youve read this text before you are right the new drag racer contains these new 7l flex axles too white panels this small set comes with a whopping 10 panels great for the ones who like panels not so great if you think tlg is using too much panels lately rudder this part the small bionicle wing is the same as the one used in last years 42033  record breaker part list this set contains 113 parts all listed below the build this is the collection of parts used to build the jet it sure looks like we are getting a landing gear the build is fun but pretty straightforward there arent any special or cool techniques used in this set it almost took me more time to apply all the stickers than to build the actual model finished model the finished jet does look cool though the white and yellow color scheme combined with the stickers work really well i have seen people refer to the plane as being orange but its definitely yellow technic or lego in general tends to have some color variation when it comes to yellow i do concur this is the warmer variant of yellow but its not orange the back of the plane looks nice too although i am not a big fan of the rudder part it looks too detailed compared to the other panels its not a big deal though and maybe its just me parts left only three common parts left features and functions this set has a single feature and that is a retractable landing gear its operated by the black 12t double bevel gear near the cockpit in the following picture you can see the landing gear retracted this image shows the landing gear when the plane is ready for landing hopefully the pilot will roll the plane before landing but you probably know what i mean video heres s short video demonstrating the display team jet bmodel this set also includes the building instructions for the bmodel a stunt plane the building experience for the stunt plane is more or less the same as for the jet well what do you expect when both models are planes with a limited number of parts for an alternative model the stunt plane looks fine theres not a lot of functionality in this plane but its worth mentioning that the tail wheel allows the plane to roll on a flat surface the plane also has working propellors both functions are demonstrated in the video unfortunately the landing gear of the stunt plane is not retractable parts left a couple of extra leftover parts but its nice to see that most of the parts have been used in the bmodel as well actually theres probably an extra yellow technic smooth 12 bush left i just found it on my desk but it could belong to one of the other sets video heres a video demonstrating the stunt plane summary two nice planes for 13 bucks thats basically what you get both models look good and the set has some interesting new parts especially the 7l flex axle will be very popular it comes with a decent collection of white panel although they are very common nowadays both models have limited functionality but each of them has at least one function to give the model some playability for kids other than the swooshability that is okay it might lack some proper functions but i still think kids will love this set i can see kids running around with one of the planes in their hands all in all i think this set delivers what youd expect score lets see how this set flies remember that the grades are based on it being a small set obviously a set like this cannot be compared with a mercedes flagship 8 design for a small set the model looks very authentic 7 building experience no surprises 7 features just the retractable landing gear 8 playability it has swooshability so i see kids running around with this model 7 parts lots of panels if you are into that 8 value for money cant go wrong with these small sets 75 fun for kids more image can be found on my flickr page thank you for reading i hope you enjoyed it	positive
very nice little set and a lot of those new white small panels its a need	positive

hi there nice model great review i almost reverse engineered this model but used wrong parts for landing wheels didnt know how to fix the nose proper and so on so i was very interested in this model and i like playing with it i love the reviews but i think i have to mention that the yellow axle must be a 5l the picture shows a 5l and a 5l would fit the size of the model the cart has also a 5l in yellow what sitze is the yellow axle in this seit really 4l as written in the text greetings robert	positive

i seem to have been messing up axle lengths in various reviews its indeed 5l my bad thanks for pointing it out	neutral
good review as always jim when i first saw this set i thought that it would make a great parts pack for me as that i have about 20 white pieces in my technic collection all from 42043 and this set has some really useful ones all for a cheap price those 7l flex axles will be extremely useful in my current build im doing	positive
nice review even with the missing demonstration video of the amodel looks like this is an excellent panel pack for the price and those soft axles will go down a treat will this set be the dark horse of 1h 2016	positive
i am definitely getting set for the panels	positive

set is only interesting for the panels thats all it is to me	neutral
i just built the a model and i rather like it it is much bigger than it looks from the box  about 30 studs long there is only one function  the landing gear  but it works very nicely apart from that its a very solid build and achieves an elegant shape with an absolute minimum of parts i dont usually get excited about small sets but this one appeals to me i like the feeling that every single piece has a purpose	positive
i got this little set for xmas and i noticed all the gaps and decided to fix them so here it is img5344 by jj2sam on flickr first i added some beams to the wings and top to make it less hollow second i put some navigation lights on it i made the nose a bit wider and added a control panel and lastly i changed out the landing gear wheels to more appropriate ones img5349 by jj2sam on flickr more pictures are here	neutral
got this at the weekend mainly for the parts but built it first agreed with other comments  awesome swooshability	positive
review  42046  getaway racer introduction starting with the 42010  offroad racer and 42011  race car in 2013 tlg released two sets in the first half of each year using a pullback motor the pullback motor allows the model to be pulled back followed by forward motion usually theres no apparent relation between the two set other than the ability to combine them into an alternate build this year there seems to some sort of cops and robbers scene going on a getaway racer and a police interceptor that cant be a coincidence makes you wonder who will be victorious the good guys or the bad guys lets find out note all images can be clicked for hires versions set information number 42046 title getaway racer theme technic released 2016 part count 170 box weight 302 gr box dimensions 260 cm x 138 cm x 59 cm set price msrp € 1999 price per part € 0118 links brickset bricklink the box the box has the same dimensions as previous years pullback motor sets in the lower right corner theres a visual explanation of the pullback mechanism the dark model with its decals sure looks like a cool hot rod content of the box the box contains 1 instructions booklet 1 sticker sheet 2 technic liftarms 1 pullback motor 3 bags instruction booklet just a single booklet unfortunately no booklet for the alternate model sticker sheet the sticker sheet contains a lot of cool stickers with flames and skulls etc pullback motor and liftarms the pullback motor and two liftarms are found unbagged bags a total of three bags containing the majority of the parts highlighted parts this section describes the new andor otherwise interesting parts actually this set is the only set of 1h 2016 which doesnt use any new parts not even parts in a new color tires the getaway racer uses four low profile tires tire 37 x 22 zr rims the rims are wheel 304mm d x 20mm in pearl gold found in 12 other sets panels this set contains three 3 panelsand three 4 panels in black part list this set contains 171 parts all listed below the build this being a small model i wont show any building steps lets skip right to the finished model below you can see the end result in my opinion the model looks great its got that hot rod vibe going on and the stickers add darkness to the vibe slight problem with this set is that it really needs the stickers to finish the look otherwise its quite dull with black and dark grey liftarms and panels the rear view shows the pullback motor connected directly to the rear axle in this image you can also clearly see the exhaust pipes on the side which are very well executed the 3x3 technic discs with stickers used in the rim result in only seeing a part of the rim this works very well with the golden rims the bottom view shows the chassis of the car nothing really noteworthy as you would expect from a pullback set video the following video gives you an overview of the finished model parts left these six parts are left after building the model seems about right features and functions this being a pullback motor set it only has a single feature the video below demonstrates the acceleration of the vehicle my girlfriend was kind enough to catch the model before it fell to the ground or did it hit something before it fell to the ground video this video shows the pullback functionality bmodel the alternate model is a combined build with the police interceptor which you can see on the back of the box unfortunately the instructions for the combined bmodel are not included so i didnt get a chance to build it this would make for a fun challenge building the bmodel without the instructions summary pullback sets are not the most technically advanced models so you cant expect any other functionality than hitting the walls in your house however i think they are very appealing to kids the fact that this years pullback sets form a duo adds to the fun in my opinion tlg hit the nail on the head with the getaway racer and police interceptor the getaway racer looks very badass which is something you dont see every day in a technic set score how do i grade the bad guy in this years duo 8 design it looks so cool but it does need the stickers 7 building experience nothing out of the ordinary 7 features limited to the pullbackanddrive functionality 7 playability combined with the police interceptor kids will love it it does need its nemesys though 7 parts collection of common parts gold rims could be interesting 8 value for money pullback sets always deliver a certain value 73 hit it more image can be found on my flickr page thank you for reading i hope you enjoyed it	positive

theitalianbrick on 01 december 2015  0932 am said jim great reviews but can i suggest you one thing take some pics before you apply the stickersand some with the stickers on it helps to have a comparison you are right i came to the same conclusion when writing the review i tell you it doesnt look that good without stickers but i dont have a picture to prove it to be honest i compared it to the model posted in the 2016 topic a few days ago i applied the stickers before building the model so i wasnt able to make a proper comparison i will keep it in mind for future reviews thanks for the suggestion	neutral

lego 42049 mine loader thanks to lego and eurobricks for making this review possible this was supposed to be a previewreview before the dec 1 release date for the set but it got stuck in customs or something and didnt arrive in time well id rather do a good late review than a rushed review so here it is name mine loader set number 42049 pieces 476 i think price 3999 i think minifigs 0 theme technic year of release 2016 links bricklink brickset the box another standard technic box not that theres anything wrong with that it is a littler weird that the mine loader is shown outside the mine but whatever the back of the box again very standard its oddly technical showing the exact angle of the machine when turning but thats the sort of nerdy detail that technic people like the alternate mine cutting machine model looks interesting and unusual as well the 11 part the 11 part on the top of the box is especially helpful with this set these mining machines are very oddly proportioned since they need to fit in mine tunnels so its hard to judge the model size based on the wheels or seat like you can an ordinary set the contents you get manuals for both models a single book for the b and two books for the main a medium size sticker sheet 4 bags and 4 loose tires the special parts this set has 4 of the new mudguard panels in yellow two cylinder halves in red a new color some of the new color red and yellow axles a couple of the newish technic spacers some of the axlepin combination pieces and a couple swords im pretty sure thats an antenna and a spare the start of the bmodel since i like the main model better im building the alternate first so thats how ill write the review theres power for something probably the engine being taken off the one axle here overall a pretty standard technic frame beginning with some structural beams a frame and using liftarms to support axles out to the sides more of the frame the far end of the model has some obvious steering mechanism being formed as well as a pivoting arm right in the center thats probably the connection from the hand of god knob the steering yup called it oddly there is a different turning radius between right and left right now i wonder if thatll get fixed more mechanisms thats looking more technic now sad to see a ujoint being used just as a fixed straight connection like that but it is the alternate model the engine block because all engines should be enclosed in a red cylindrical housing am i right the chassis its definitely coming together now and yes the bmodel instructions tell you to put the stickers on it doesnt matter whether you build the main or alternate first youll get the stickers on almost  there were a couple leftover that didnt get used in the bmodel almost done with the rest of the body done and the wheels on you really get the scale of this machine that blue seat is tiny compared to the rest of it and yes the uneven steering lock got fixed after putting the wheels on you add a couple of pin with ball pieces to the underside to restrict the steering they didnt do that at first so that you could turn the axles sharper while putting the wheels on which made it easier to do the grinder keeping in mind the scale of the machine this thing looks terrifying the tan gear at the back drives the spinning blade up front the red bushes near the turntable let you adjust the angle all done the arm quickly attaches to the body and its done sadly that tan gear doesnt connect to anything  its just a knob so you can spin the blade by hand raise your hand if youre sure i think im dating myself with that title this thing has massive reach im imagining this inside a mine grinding away the rock overhead pretty viciously effective machine the crank on this side of the model is used to raise and lower the arm works well and the grey spacer makes it nice to use since it spins freely the leftovers not much left for a bmodel nice usage starting the main model the main model starts similarly to the alternate with a frame some axles and a drive connection from one axle to something later getting complicated already were only a few pieces in and we already have three separate gear trains going on theres the axle driving the tan beveled gears inside the frame at the bottom theres more tan gears in the middle and theres also a black gear sticking up as a knob that turns the grey connector in the center the body is done i skipped ahead quite a bit but it was a bunch of standard technic building youve got a fake engine with fan at the back driven by one of the rear wheels a knob sticking up for steering and an axle coming forward to open and close the claw the claw i like that they used a link system to open and close the claw instead of just gearing it the axle comes forward from the chassis its the red axle with a couple ujoints for flexibility and drives a worm gear that rotates a gear below with a 2 stud liftarm on each side those arms have pin with towball in them and then a link going from that short liftarm to the claw its a small rotation of the liftarm but makes the claw open widely and works very well raising the claw a few black liftarms join the claw to the body of the loader and allow it to move up and down its a simple mechanism there  one yellow beam goes back and connects to a lever that lets you raise and lower the claw when raised as shown the lever locks in place by going just slightly past the centerline and its done add some wheels a cab and some wheel arches and were done its a great looking machine pretty unique and looks like the real thing the main difference from reality is these usually have a scoop for moving loose rock since weve had so many scooping vehicles in the past tracked loaders the volvo l350f excavators etc the claw here is a fun change and adds to the playability for kids like the real thing the body stays very low so the cab only has to stick up a little bit for the driver to see all around because mines are cramped and busy areas from the rear this angle is great i love the use of the new mudguard panels to make a nice curve to the back of the loader the antenna is a little weird but perhaps they had a big pile of flat silver fencing swords to use up the black gear just to the left of the antenna is the claw control rotating that gear opens and closes it the back end is a little lighter than a real machine would be but lego wanted to leave the engine exposed so you can see the cylinders moving the conclusion so whats my conclusion on this model i like it a lot its simpler than a big set would be but its got lots of design and playability crammed in a midsized set its a unique vehicle however it does have a few flaws the steering on the main model needs some drag added as is you basically have to drive by holding the steering knob since itll bend if you push it from behind i dont like the use of pin with pin hole as mounting points for the orange and red trans plates for lights since they can turn slightly and be at weird angles the antenna is unnecessary and in the way but none of these flaws are dealbreakers or even big deals theyre minor the ratings value 1010  less than 10 cents a piece lots of useful liftarms and such nothing too weird or singleuse design 910  looks very realistic for the size of the set good functionality not too dependent on stickers minifigs na  na playability 910  controls arent perfect loose steering small knob for claw control but very functional and cleverly done parts 910  nice selection although heavy on the standard yellow and black almost zero studded parts overall 9510  its a great intro to technic set  a unique vehicle good functionality nice part selection and decently priced i like it a lot and plan to keep it around as a finished set	positive
great review with high quality pictures well done im glad you took the time to do it properly cool that you have built both models i agree with the mudguards they sure look good on this model	positive
i was waiting especially for review of this set let me add few things about this thing it all will be complainging of person who works with these type of machines so if you just want a unusual machine in your collection ignore my complaining  i see underground loaders almost every day and believe me this model would now work in the underground mine first of all its cab should stick out more from the frame each loader has cab placed out of the chassis to provide better view for the driver in this class of machine it would help a bit but in low loader ones it is extremely important this is the view from the cab of a low profile loader looking at front  and yes front of the machine is where engine is placed because at least at kghm all machines drive engine forward another thing about that cab is that seat and steering wheeljoysticks are placed perpendicularly to the machine chassis to provide same view for driving forward and backwards so another weak spot of the set the model lacks of trans clear lights on the engine part because all machines that work underground have same lamps on front and back another thing that comes to my mind is that warning light and antena would not live too long in the mine becuase it could be torn apart by ramming into tunnels roofs it does resemble shape of underground machine but not a loader only machine that comes to my mind is something that are used for movingplacing hydraulic support jacks in tunnels sorry for poor quality i didnt find better picture of it it does have claw four wheels and articulated chassis but have much greater range of movement of the arm anyway id give it at least 35 for overall look model itself as a set looks unfinished or cut down on pieces after visit of an accountant for me it looks like engine part was built differently with knobs for steeringclaw operating sticking out from back claw needs almost seven full turns of the worm gear to close from opened position and is rather annoing to use it in way it is built in this model bracket that holds bevel gears responsible for steering is rather loose being hold in place by single 34 pin on the other hand the steering works very well it seems that lack of differential will be more common in lego sets becuase it is another model that have fake engine driven by single wheel like in old russian rc cars i am ok with that but it is a pitty that this model has only r2 engine thing that i do not like the most in this model is how the claw arm works first of all it barelly lifts the claw of the ground the movement could be much better and it has major design flaw  universal joints are not placed in line with articulation points and this is main reason of 5l axle not being suported on both sides under the turntable while rainsing the arm it bends a little i really would like to see this model built differently with normal bucket and better range of movement edited by mlonger 05 december 2015  1108 pm	negative
thanks for the thorough comments i agree that the set has some limitations both in construction and realism but i think theyre acceptable given the pricepoint and size the antenna is definitely ludicrous  i really do suspect they had a surplus of the swords to use up and yes the way the steering knob is mounted is loose i also noticed that the ujoints to the claw are not in the right spot like you mentioned but didnt include it since it still works fine that axle coming forward to the claw has a very long unsupported section that does bend a bit when you raise and lower the claw it works but is a bit of a cheat that im kinda surprised they let through i just checked and the bucket from 8043 is a couple studs too wide for this set im betting that was seriously considered but itd have meant scaling the whole thing up and that would have put it into a higher price point or they could have pulled the mold for the 8x14 bucket back out and remade it for this set i really like the model you built and thats interesting about the cabs being basically flush with the top but sticking out the side in image searching as part of my research i found both that style and ones like this with the cab sticking up more like the photo of the caterpillar one in my review i wonder if thats a useuropean difference or different types of mining or what because both styles definitely exist in the real world	neutral

technic year of release 2016 links bricklink brickset the box standard technic box action photo 2in1 logo inset of functions and the new try our app logo in the corner the box back more standard stuff with the bmodel and a larger app ad the contents 3 bags two manuals yes despite all the ads for their instructions app they included printed manuals for both the main and b models a big sticker sheet and two loose black beams the interesting parts theres a lot of panels in this set some are new colors the blue curved panel and the lshaped blue panels are a new mold i see them being used as mudguards on future sets or maybe even this year i havent looked at the other 2016 technic sets in detail yet the hose soft axle 7 long in black is new as well the normal 7 axle in yellow is a new color too and i have no idea why its in this set both models use it in invisible places so theres no reason other than making it easier to grab the right length axle to have it i assume other sets this year are using it but im not sure the manual and the dumbingdown continues now they have to show people to compare axle lengths to the 11 prints on the page that have always been there but how does the 11 work on the app might have to look into that for the record i pulled out my phone and tried to find the app in the google store couldnt find it so then i went to the lego website shown on the page and it had a link to it turns out it wasnt showing up because its tablet only so google wasnt showing it to me on my phone ill try again later with a tablet starting the build two technic standards a bunch of pieces linked together to make a specific pattern of holes and an engine block some weirdness this felt very weird to me  making the crankshaft for the engine they have you build it right to left i dont know if its because im a lefty or what but it felt awkward i need to look in some old manuals and see if its always been this way nope i randomly looked at 2013s set 42000 racer and it builds it left to right assembling the core heres the core of the racer upside down the engine block some gears at each end and a couple boat studs for smooth gliding and yes they cheated and those are only attached on two studs instead of all 4 im always amazed at how lego geometry keeps finding interesting ways that it works like here with those boat studs they fit perfectly into the bottom of the brick and against the beam the front end up front we get a standard blue seat with a couple hidden wheels behind it a boat doesnt typically have wheels but these will drive the mechanisms of this model so well let it slide an odd part choice here though  in the very front there are two tan axle pin without friction parts holding that 3 long liftarm on why theres no need in either model for the nonfriction pin and theres lots of the normal blue axle pins in the set so why include these two different pins and all done it looks like a huge jump here but its really not the front and rear connect to each other and then a bunch of big panels are added that make the model look way bigger the stickers on this set really make it work without them its pretty bland and boring so i recommend using them from the rear at the back we have a fan to propel the boat thats not so accurate all the images i can find of reallife boats use props in the water but since this is a nonfloating model we have to make some tweaks i guess there also should be fins going down into the water for stability and hydroplaning but again had to drop that heres an example of a real boat you can see they nailed the overall look quite well the underside for those that want to see the mechanicals heres the underside of the model minifig scale technic nope not quite a fig will fit the seat but sticks out of the cockpit and cant fit a helmet at all so close starting the b model again with the engine block but this time an opposing 4 instead of inline an odd part its rare for lego to include parts specific to the bmodel so i was curious when i found this 2axle with pin a fairly new part in the main model its used in a place that a normal 3 pin would have been fine and its the only one of these in the whole set so it obviously must be needed in the bmodel sure enough theres an assembly here that needs it the front of the boat more upsidedown building and that silver piston is basically only there as a spacer it has no real function yet it turns out later an axle goes into it so its a support for one end of the axle adding the wheels we keep building around the engine this model uses the same wheel setup as the main model taking shape the bmodel instructions tell you to put the stickers on in case you havent  they actually did a good job making the sticker work on either model but the silver piston used as a crossbrace is a bit weird it can spin so that axle hole on the side ends up facing whatever way it wants the back end the flex axles are used here under the panels just for appearance and to support the exhausts at the right angle same fan propulsion as the main model and just as wrong here  worse the gearing is switched in the main model the pistons and fan spin pretty quickly as you push the boat across the floor in this one they turn very slowly more instruction weirdness im always curious at how lego decides to do instructions heres how the panels on one side of the boat are assembled for the mirror image on the other side they tell you to put all 3 pins into the short panel as step 1 2 black and a blue add the white piece as step 2 and then add teh second panel and stickers as step 3 why two different ways all done heres a similar angle as most of the official images looks ok i noticed though how obvious the wheels are the back of the box image is a lower angle that hides them more and i like the mudguard panels as seats pretty clever from the side im not fond of the profile it doesnt sit level like i think it should the wheels are a stud too low sticking out of the bottom the underside like most bmodels there are compromises theres pins and axles sticking out but thats what you do when faced with a limited piece selection minifig scale yet nope not quite a bit too big this time i think the driver is supposed to sit in the seat with knees over the front of the guard where the grey pin is so the minifig is way too small spare pieces very few leftovers in this bmodel the conclusion so whats my conclusion on this model the bmodel is fairly meh and too similar to the main model however i love the hydroplane racer itself it looks great and is very swooshable for the price its surprisingly large thanks to the big panels on the sides yes this is one set that really needs the stickers to look good but they look great and are well worth putting on the ratings value 910  close to 10 cents a piece and a fairly large model for the price design 910  looks great other than the tiny fan on the back minifigs na  i was tempted to give a score since a minifig almost fits but thatd be cheating playability 810  not much functionality other than the engine and fan spinning but very swooshable and sturdy enough to be played with parts 910  a bunch of panels including some new ones just about every kind of technic pin and quite a few thin liftarms  overall 910  the set is a solid winner as long as your satisfied with the main model	positive
again great review with superb pictures the white and blue certainly works very well with your dark backdrop thorough review for such a small model small in size but great as a set tell me why did i let you review this one	positive
quote and the dumbingdown continues now they have to show people to compare axle lengths to the 11 prints on the page that have always been there but how does the 11 work on the app might have to look into that for the record i pulled out my phone and tried to find the app in the google store couldnt find it so then i went to the lego website shown on the page and it had a link to it turns out it wasnt showing up because its tablet only so google wasnt showing it to me on my phone ill try again later with a tablet funny thing is that they changed colour of 7l axle to yellow and on that picture it still is in lbg	neutral
nice review thanks nice little set i might buy me one	positive
very timely review jim my wife has just surprised me by giving me this set a few days ago and i have just built the a model two days ago and b model yesterday i agree with all that you wrote above i dont have tumbler tires but i have 9398 tires driving is smooth but steering  suspension will be bad as you said due to negative caster and tires hitting the chassis anyway tonight i will destroy the b model and rebuilt this httpwwwbusterhau8cmodelhtml	positive
the set is a looker youve got to admit it but what it gives in looks does not make up for what it lacks in functions i really wanted this set badly even when i restarted my adventure with technic about a month ago than i learned more and more about what a good model can do mostly thanks to this forum and yt right now im a bit disappointed with the arctic truck  smaller sets offer more functions and teach you much more jim it was a great review nevertheless edited by pgplay 14 december 2015  1122 am	negative
great review i bought this model several weeks ago and the box has sat on my shelf so i think after this i will be digging it out for christmas and i expect my son will have a lot of fun with it when its built ps these tumbler tyres look amazing on this model and indeed amazing in their own right	positive
i think this model is more or less supposed to be a version of this thing a pretty obscure topic but also very interesting	neutral
how about this one ps i somehow didnt find this picture when i wrote my review	neutral
you switched the sides for the panel with the unsymmetrical sticker otherwise you would see that the cut off part is where theres a beam in front of the panel thats probably done because the beam could possibly damage the sticker either while building or while placed against it for a long time or its simply omitted because it wouldnt be completely visible	neutral
great review and pictures as always its an odd combo but i agree that the b model looks good with tumbler tires therize on 14 december 2015  0932 pm said i could be wrong but i am 100 sure that ive seen this review before i believe jim posted the same one in the reviewers academy	positive
another great review i like this set very much both models look good to me and its a great part pack for me the long list in the high light parts session tells everything as for the real world counter part of the a model how about this try googling snocat and there a lots of such things	positive
until i saw photos of this set i wasnt convinced i wanted it now after seeing all the combinations ab and tumbler tires i am definitely buying two copies i need orange parts and black treads anyway the only problem i have with this is that its going to encourage me to buy many copies of the drag racer just to get enough wheels to play with	positive

jimanyonei built this set a few days ago i dont like the way the crane arm section has no knob to turn the mini turntable you see the 20 tooth gearthere is a pinhole located next to thisi would like to add something here to make it easier to turn the winch section	negative
i have the 42038 nice set but i found the tipping of the bed clumsy it was a pleasure to build and i do like the build with the tumble wheels	negative
thank you jim nice review it´s a great set a lot unique parts and not just pins axles and beams i bough it to bring me back to lego from my da 10 years ps soon i will post an alternative model	positive
review  42001  mini offroader introduction technic mini models are sometimes regarded as models not worth buying i dont agree with this opinion whether its a special part or innovative building technique almost every mini model has something that makes the set worthwhile this time i will be reviewing the 42001 mini offroader this model is not a smaller version of an existing model so theres no real comparison with a bigger brother or sister if you will nor does the model resemble a real life brand or vehicle so it is what it is a mini offroader note all images can be clicked for hires versions set information number 42001 title mini offroader theme technic released 2013 part count 100 box weight 165 gr box dimensions 155 x 140 x 42 cm set price msrp 999 eur de  799 gbp  1299 usd price per part de 0100 eur  uk 0080 gbp  usa 0130 usd links brickset bricklink the box the box measures 155 x 140 x 42 cm which is obviously not very big the weight of the box is approximately 165 grams frontside the front of the box shows a though four wheel drive offroader challenging a fierce rocky mountain trailnow does it what the box actually shows is mini offroader challenging a small foam rock formation much like rocks used in star trek the original series yet smaller the box also states that this model is for the age of 7 till 14 more importantly the 2models in1 logo is clearly visible which means this set can be used to build two different models backside the backside shows a picture of the alternate model and a smaller version of the original model the conversion arrow and the 2in1 are printed to clarify that the main model can be converted into a secondary model sides one of the sides shows the 2in1 logo and a picture of the main model another side shows a picture of one of the wheels in actual size and again a picture of the main model contents of the box the box contains 2 booklets 2 bags 4 tires booklets this set contains two booklets which is not very common for a set this size both models share the same chassis which is why the build has been divided over two booklets one for the chassis 8 pages with 10 steps and one for the bodywork 34 pages with 23 steps for the main model and 20 steps for the alternate model bags the box contains only 2 bags which is to be expected from a set consisting of 100 parts one of the bags is filled with liftarms panels rims and two elastic bands the other bags contains all the other parts like pins axles connectors etc opening the bags results in the following collection of parts with the exception of the tires no abundant number parts that will add real value to your collection nevertheless there are some interesting orange parts and elastic bands tires the tires are provided seperately ie not contained in the bags from the picture you can see that these tires have a front and a back side so you should pay attention when fitting them to the rims which have two different sides as well highlighted parts this section describes the unique andor highlighted parts very small smooth technic panel 21 and 22 these two small technic were new at the time of release and this set was only one of two sets containing them in orange the other set is the 42007  moto cross bike at the moment of writing theres a third set containing these parts the black champion racer side a side b small rubber band i was under the impression that these white rubber bands werent that common but it seems that these bands are as common as dirt but hey you cant have enough rubber bands thin liftarm 1x5 with axle holes like the panels these liftarms were also new at the time of release looking at the the frequent usage in other sets this part has proven to be a most useful mammal thin liftarm 1x3 not a very rare piece per se but if you are not into bionicle this liftarm part can be hard to find your other option would be to buy the 9390  mini tow truck or the 8305  dual bikes from a while ago 2000 long pin with center pin hole this relatively new kid on the block is currently used in many technic and nontechnic sets and has well proven its worth axle pin connector hub with 2 axles like the previous part this newish part is also quite helpful in certain situations part list heres the complete list for all 100 parts building experience the build starts with the chassis of the offroader after connecting some liftarms two elastic bands one on each side are attached to the towball pins this is all there is to the suspension plain and simple the two elastic bands contract the lshaped liftarms which results in the long ends swiveling downwards the video below demonstrates the suspension the simplicity doesnt do it justice because it works like a charm the suspension is very smooth with the right amount of stretch and resistance this great working suspension adds a lot of value to this set to quote john hurt in the movie contact why build one when you can have two at twice the price i have purchased two sets so we can simultaneously see both models and make a proper comparison below you can see two identical chassis which will be used for both versions of the build at this stage we have arrived at the end of the first booklet which only took about ten minutes not surprising since the first booklet only has 10 building steps progressing to the second booklet you need to choose between building the main and alternative model thats a choice i dont need to make for this review so lets start with the main model main model when building the bodywork theres a rather peculiar building technique which you wouldnt expect in an official lego set the axle and pin connector hub with 2 axles only protrudes halfway into the double bent liftarm the thin 1x4 liftarm which is added in one of the following steps makes sure the hubs stay perfectly in place but i was still surprised to see this technique the finished bodywork for the main model looks likeuhhwelli dont know exactly it doesnt bear any resemblance to a real life model which makes it hard to judge one things for sure its not the best looking technic mini model the bodywork can be attached to the chassis by using a 7l axle and two bushes one on each side of the chassis alternate model unfortunately the alternate model doesnt look much better than the main model its even a stud less wide while you would like to see slightly more body matching the size of the tires and chassis attached to the chassis the body is even more out of proportion its not really ugly and the color scheme is great obviously this goes for the main model as well but the body simply doesnt match the chassis i can only imagine that this model is supposed to have a chibi look much like the microfighter star wars models comparison the following section shows a selection of images from different angles to compare the main and secondary model the main model has a bit more volume while the alternate model has a more sporty look front view the main model has headlights which are attached at a higher point while the alternate model has headlights which are placed more closely next to each other rear view a slightly different setup in both models where the main model again has higher placed rear lights side view the side view shows that the panels are used differently in both models the main models uses them as doors while the alternate model uses them as engine cover bonnet top view the top view reveals that the main model might have room for a minifig parts left the left image shows the parts which are left after building the main model while the second image shows the parts left after building the alternate model as you can see the main model uses slightly more parts than the alternate model features besides the awesome suspension which we already have discussed there arent a lot of features in this set theres actually a single feature which is only present in the main modelopening doors wow impressive well maybe we cant expect too much functionality in such a small model summary the offroader is a fun model which is fairly easy to build the suspension is simple yet very effective the model could do better in the design department but the suspension offers great playability and that is what this set is all about the orange parts are not very common so they are an added bonus all things considered this set is definitely worth the few bucks you need to spend on it pros great suspension fun to play with some semi rare orange parts great color scheme cons no resemblence to an actual offroader not the best looking model score below are my scores based on different categories 6 design not the best looking technic model 7 building experience the suspension makes it fun to build 7 features the suspension makes up for the lack of functionality 8 playability the model has carswooshability 7 parts some interesting orange parts 8 value for money great present for the younger builders 71 elastic hope you enjoyed it thanks for reading and please rate this set at the top of this topic	positive

here is the reviewfor broadsides brig 6259 a set from 1991 with a handsome count of 64 pieces 3 figures and a sale price of 875 the buildingand parrot well start off with the front it looks like a good solid building to hold those scurvy dogs we yonder over to the left side and see a nice open back and yonder to the plain right side back to the left we find the corner with a nice area to rest your tired soldiers we see the platform in the corner a lovely place for soldiers to stand on its a bitskimpy so watch your step the middle is blocked by some stones assuring security but still open enough to stand in the jail is cramped and fits only two people but we only need one prisoner in this set   moving up is the watch tower a place for your soldier stand and stand watch or for silly parots to sit on heres the front middle part again those stones blocking the way figures and accesories we have a delightful number of a soldier a sailor and a scurvy pirate a lovely parot and a generous assortment of weapons that concludes our review overall its a fantastic little set and great for army and supplies and bricks gathering i cant find any faults with this set its just the neatest little thing youve seen in a port wub highly recomended y  and to end our review a comic	positive
a fine little set with 64 pieces and 3 figures for under 10 may have seemed a bit steep in 1991 but i wouldnt know id passed into my dark ages already so alas i havent a copy of this set looking at the parts list i could build one out of my current inventory though issued today for 10 id buy no less than 14 of them even though it does lack the obligatory rowboat for the pirate to make his escape in very nice review and comic thanks for doing them y edited by imperialshadows 20 october 2007  0610 am	positive

during the annual thanksgiving road trip to the relatives i stopped by the tru in portland or lo and behold the new mars mission sets obviously i bought them  the box not much to say standard box art for mm sets nothing new the parts some good parts here even if you dont like the set which i highly doubt after ive had my say p  its a decent parts pack i noticed that some old parts have been renewed i know the wheel has been used in the 07 sets but the cockpit and hitch i havent seen in a while the vldss very large dss grr new part at least i think it is someone slap me if it isnt wacko the figs i know ive seen that head before but i have no idea where does anyone know i was hoping that the aliens would have new arms at least i was sadly mistaken on the upside i finally discovered that they glow in the dark  the alien has a jetpack if thats not the silliest thing ive ever seen i dont know what is the build simple build a block so easy a caveman cou oh never mind geicos used that one enough then we have this jobber right here not sure what it is but it looks like some crystal scanning device its starting to look pretty nice it almost looks practical the cockpit is suffering from a bad dose of overstickering on the upside we have a new piece there to hold the cockpit on part 1 complete it has a nice little radio antenna which is ruined by the use of a random missile that looks like its going to shoot the antenna before it shoots the alien still i never say no to a good missile i can use for something else the trailer fairly simple but it works it features stabilizing arms a handheld saw and an extremely random minibot whos purpose escapes me the whole meal deal erm general pics overall i thought this was a good set in fact it reminds me of this	positive

a wonderful set and perhaps as close to classic space as possible y also theres a great amount of very useful and interesting parts too like these round stabilizer parts with clip  theres a complete different feeling with this new sets compared to the first mm ones 8 beside the a little more realistic aspects of it with the more enclosed cockpit nearly with some controls   its the overall more solid feeling i guess the other sets look pretty neat and fashionable at the surface but their internal structure is much more hollow and useless with some studless technic beams and such stuff very shining but hard and boring to mod just aimed for maximal cool looking box art and the rest went down for saving costs beside that already pretty good 7692 dropship that is the only thing i dont get with that is why the minirobots a onearmed one ach pirates on mars i suppose xd	positive
great review but am i the only one who thinks this is a pretty homely looking vehicle the small exploration robot is cool but the large windscreen on the main vehicle reminds me about jack stone i also think the bases of the vehicle parts are very basic and look almost unfinished with the holes and such i think i will pass this one even though the alien has a jet pack and there is the nice mini vehicle	negative
ah thanks so much again mr m this set looks great i probably wont get this though i hat mm as far as it goes i agree with xwingyoda on this one does the minibots wheels move edited by vbbn 26 november 2007  1034 pm	negative

thanks for another 08 review y this set is an attempt of a classic but has failed part pack on d piranha jelly jetpack  	negative
mr mandalorian on nov 26 2007 0520 pm said come on you have to admit that a jelly with a jetpack is funny pathetically so any way i might make a vig of this involving a brick wall and plenty of transgreen peices xd d hilarious actuallyhowever its imapled to it so i guess its a suicide mission d piranha	positive
thanks for posting the picture of this new mm set when i first saw the mars mission sets i was a little apprehensive about the design and the aliens they could have at least make movable arms  but anyways when i bought the small fighter i was totally hook my fave set from the line is the mech	positive
during the annual thanksgiving road trip to the relatives i stopped by the tru in portland or lo and behold the new mars mission sets predictably i bought them i present to you the mx41 switch fighter man what a long name the box standard mm on the front it shows the fighter in flight mode and a yellow note telling you that it transforms the back shows three pictures showing it happen the parts once i open the box the first thing that comes out is a bent and rolled up instruction booklet and i was forced to put it under a stack of beer books for an hour then theres the dss yes two of the stickers do feature a cobra i wonder why because this sets decal should be a beatle xd decent parts nothing too special then i noticed this little part its used for the flickmissiles but i have no idea what else it would be used for  the build the alien ship when i looked at the box art for this set i was releived to see that the aliens dont have another curvedforward wing ship instead they have this little beauty which appears to be the alien mini cooper small and hot wub anyway partially completed even if you dont like the set it has some nice green flame peices which work nicely for space laser swords fully completed the only annoying bit about it is that the crystalholding thing in front wobbles all over the place the alien fits into it by way of impalement it must hurt getting in and out switch fighter cockpit the set makes good use of the alpha team cockpit for controls it has a meagre handlebar that the astronaught cant even reach the rear shell of the fighter starts out around the alien containment chamber its a bit odd that the containment chamber has an alien sticker because the instruction booklet lists it as holding crystals the crystal canister is held back by a technic pin this is without a doubt the ugliest color arrangment ever warning mass stickers x the cockpit fits into grooves in the shell then it clicks into place in a 1x1 brick with a horizontal clip the wing mechanism the wing for some reason the body of the mechanism has a blue brick wacko the wing and mechanism connect to prevent the fighter doing a nosedive while in tank mode the wing mechanism completed the underside the body and wing connect by way of a miscolored red brick i have no idea why its red black would bave been much much better completed tank mode all in all this looks pretty neat the wheel base is pretty short but its not bad transform the set transforms neatly if ungainly without antigrav support it would fall forward on its nose each time it transformed jet mode its all right but it could be a bit better the shell keeps slipping back forward to the tank mode because theres nothing to stop it sliding spare parts overall i thought this set was great it could do with some fixing such as the mismatched colors but it should be a definate buy for mm fans brickshelf gallery when available	positive
cool review im actually liking that new missile part as it seems to combine a bar with a pin but its a real eyesore if you ask me	positive
wub thanks for another great review sweet i am also glad that it is a very different alien fighter design as i already have three varients of the old type the fighter transforms better than i thought it would i was expecting just the wings i should be buying this set as well mr mandalorian on nov 26 2007 0345 pm said without antigrav support it would fall forward on its nose each time it transformed well since antigrav doesnt exist and will never exist there has to be another option looking at it in tank mode it does have a vague aerofoil shape so i think it should be able to work as a lifting body all it needs to do then is move fast enough to start taking off and then it can extend the wings 8	neutral
hmm its actually a nice bit better than i expected and great review thanks but think ill pass on this one i quite like the alien fighter though heh and loved the way you described how he sat in the cockpit	negative
very cool review mr mandalorian this isnt a bad set the alien craft is very sleek if only theyd gone with the old alien body in transgreen and the transforming is alright the tank mode looks sweet sweet peace	positive
thanks for a very thorough review i might think about getting this i really like the mini alien fighter and the transformation idea is always a welcome one both modes look pretty good despite the some of the odd coloured bricks which id mod out you know what it reminds me of some of the futuristic designs in the gerry anderson series	positive
hmmm i doubt ill be getting this set good review though	negative
i really like the transforming aspect of this the one thing i wish mm sets would include would be baseplates i liked that about the classic space stuff because it really helped create the environment some red rock orange mars baseplates would be great	positive
hmmm great review for a great set y	positive
thanks guys lasse d on nov 26 2007 0854 am said wow this is actually quite a neat set it is definitively my favorite in the line after the big drilling unit begingeek im not sure it would nose dive when transforming from tank mode i guess it would pick up speed and transform quickly since it doesnt seem to have any downwards pointing thrusters endgeek i dont think that tank is very fast maybe if it drove off of a crater commander andrew of 501 st on nov 26 2007 0903 am said friggin sweet thank you mr mandy for the reveiw of this sweet ship y wub i see you know imperialshadows  	positive
great review mr mandalorian y im not a fan of mm and dont like this set much but it has some neat features but the only way i can see it transforming is by racing off a cliff and swinging its wings out wacko to the brickmobile 	negative
and another tks and congrats mm on that review  like the oher post i think that this set is a wastre of time and money and shelfspace its such a ripp off from that ugly alfa team crapjet i do not like the design of the jet itself the small flags as front is so lame  and i dont like those orange wheels as engines  furthermore i dont like the rover mode either  the only cool thing about it is the special martian jet which they should ahve sold separatly p at least some interesting parts but that far from saving that set imo  money saved on once again p yoda	negative
great review mr m y i wub those green flames and the design of the ship is pretty good thanks for the review and great pictures they are clear big and describe the set just the way they should	positive
mr mandalorian on nov 26 2007 0929 pm said 1 thanks guys 2 i dont think that tank is very fast maybe if it drove off of a crater 1 there will always be kudos for a good review at eb  2 yeah it does look quite slow and tanklike it is a shame lego didnt make a more obvious way shoving what goes on brainbox on nov 26 2007 1015 pm said the one thing youd have to make sure of though is that it was fairly light and the wheel base had a fairly large surface area actually thats two things so as to make sure it didnt dig into the soil if that happened transformation would be harder as the wheels would dig into the ground and drag through the soil then itd nose dive you mean the ungainly way in which the wheels have to turn in order to change from tank mode i think you are right as well on the other hand if it has antigrav then it doesnt really make sense to have wheels as well i mean if the power goes then the wheels cant turn anyways	negative

sweeeet wub its nice to finally see a set thats not bipedal or  tripedal quote exoforce is an anomaly in my lego interests i dont know why i like it so much or why i keep buying it but i do that would be a problem wouldnt it p quote the cockpit itself is constructed very well but the canopy seems like an afterthought closing on to the robots head and leaving his back and sides completely exposed i dunno at least it has a canopy unlike past sets	positive
thanks hinckley its always nice to see your reviews and i cant wait to see the story mode from the pic i guess it will include sinner and hinckley instead of bianca and gavin right 8  luxorv	positive

great almost finished review y thanks for doing these since you are probably busy however my favorite part is missing the comic d interesting set however i never liked exoforce but i like the parts wait on piranha	neutral
another great review hink looks like a great set quote the cockpit isnt sealed and is actually aggravatingly unrealistic as it leaves the drivers chest vulnerable to enemy fire actually the cockpit lacks any controls as seen here where it looks like keiken is simply pounding a counter demanding food d gimme food or else my friend up there willl shoot your punk  into mars well i guess that explains why there are no robot snipers in ef if there were well wouldnt be much of a story would there xd	positive
darnit hinckley  you always make us wait for the comic which is almost everyones favorite part   xd i just noticed ryos uniform had a camo pattern with all the orange he has its kinda pointless edited by lt veers 28 november 2007  0448 am	neutral
john cleese on nov 27 2007 1126 pm said this designers were on a roll with this one until it came to the flying unit it looks like a shambles epecially the guns looking rather simplistic although they used something similar to the light and sound globe peice which is kind of neat i dont think ill be buying this but your review almost talked me into it cool but my reviews are not meant to sway anyone they should just inform people further as if they want to buy it or not i am not necessarily for encouraging anyone to buy every set i review d but im glad you liked it thank you and actually i did feel the same way you did about the flying module until i put sinner in it and started to play heres a sneak peek of the comic and a cool feature of ryos shipit can be configured in a lot of different ways	neutral
this one is much better than i thought i didnt expect the gun and the turret to be geared i agree that a lot of the details sux hollow inside lame cockpits but as an overall package it looks quite good the best part is no shooter is the nightmare finally over  the bonus robot is a much better idea the large amount of blue pieces make this a must buy for me as impartial needs more raw materials p how well do the tracks work the last tank was too light and it didnt roll well at all  thanks for these photos as well hinckley wub so far the 08 exoforce sets are looking good sweet hinckley on nov 28 2007 0448 pm said and actually i did feel the same way you did about the flying module until i put sinner in it and started to play p wow its big enough for my big walrus head wub	positive
sinner on nov 28 2007 1253 am said how well do the tracks work the last tank was too light and it didnt roll well at all  its similar in weight but i didnt have to press down so hard to get the treads to move barely at all really i think the mobile defense tank although a better overall design suffered from the odd angle of the treads and that was mostly why the treads didnt turn well plus what was with those weird exhaust pipes anyway they are both cool tanks although i like the mobile defense tank better 	neutral
thank you for the glimps at the new set hinckley y  i saw this set today at my local tru store the new slope 1x2 pieces look very sweet  i definitly see great potential for these pieces on locomotives i hope these are going to be bountiful in the 2008 lines model on	positive
fantastic great review thanks a bunch for all the pics theyve shown me how in my opinion bad this set is p i just expected it to be more bricky rather than technicy oh well i wasnt planning on buying it anyway xd i noticed you spelt minifigs minifgis in the first paragraph in case you wanted to know xd so again thanks and im looking forward to seeing the rest of them and the comics peace	negative
hinckley on nov 28 2007 0648 am said cool but my reviews are not meant to sway anyone they should just inform people further as if they want to buy it or not i am not necessarily for encouraging anyone to buy every set i review d but im glad you liked it thank you oh i know but without the info i definately wouldnt buy it now im considering it hinckley on nov 28 2007 0648 am said and actually i did feel the same way you did about the flying module until i put sinner in it and started to play heres a sneak peek of the comic and a cool feature of ryos shipit can be configured in a lot of different ways xo  sinner fits in there well im sold xd	positive
thanks for this great review hinckley  i know youre loving this attention xd p i actually like this set and like it a lot more now that ive seen this review ill most likely get mostly for the figs and parts i reckon it would look a lot better alongside the rest of the 2008 ef mechs anyway thanks for the review to the brickmobile 	positive
thanks for that good review hinckley y a really interesting set and a turning point for lego minirobots instead of shooting crap pretty cool i hope the kidsll like it too for the design i love that asymmetrical look of the front part and the sleek guns of the flyer its smart that the gatling gun moves along with the tank too the set idea with two vehicles in ones not new but very play able and the treadsbig wheel designs cool i dont like the use of studless technic beams but well they do their job i guess and keikens cockpit should be easy to improve	positive
asuka on nov 28 2007 0241 pm said for the design i love that asymmetrical look of the front part and the sleek guns of the flyer the asymmetry reminds me of the wookie vehicles in starwars battlegrounds y and i see they changed back to the first color schemes for minifig suits which i think where better than the dark suits of 2007 except for hikarus wub  luxorv	neutral

some of you might know that im not a big fan of exoforce but this set is an exception this looks like a futurist tank my kids would love this if i should have any d as always very professional review hinckley	positive
i think this is probably my least favourite set of next years selection but i still might get it partly because of this review thanks btw i quite like the minirobot and while there are a few problems the front cockpit the exposed axles i relish the idea of moding them out and correcting them and the change back to the original figs is welcome i didnt really get any of this years sets only last years makes it easier from a mocing potential anyway	neutral

here is my review of the set 6265 sabre island overview sabre island was release in 1990 an it contained 92 pieces and its retail price was 1550 it comes with 3 imperial blue coats and a nice outpost for them the pictures  full review anyway you can see here a picture of the box the model shown on the box differs from the actual model slightly and the back of the box which shows some nice alternative models from the pieces provided a close up of two or three of the alternative models and now for the minifigs i prefer the red coats over the blue coats but these minifigs are nice and for the number of pieces one gets a fair amount of them the set itself makes a nice small outpost it comes complete with a palm tree a cannon with ammo on a turntable a small tower a nice large imperial flag and a little red row boat here is a shot from ground level showing the cannon and blue coat patrolling the out post the rowing boat was a nice touch and it comes with a small flag too no pirates will avoid the wrath of myself and my mighty island the top of the tower is rather plain and simple which in some ways is good as it keeps the whole set detailed yet not crowded but i feel a little something should of been added to the top though the back is lacking any type of walls so one can play with the minifigs inside yet their are also no stairs or any other ways for the blue coats to climb up their tower either the rag tag pirates attack sabre island but never fear the lord of pies is here me throwing a pie at captain ironhook from another angle overall i think this is a very good if somewhat simple set and makes a great cheap imperial set comments thoughts and opinions are welcome and sorry about the darkness in some photos i have not had time to take photographs when it is till light recently for when i return home it is dark   edit fixed thank you edited by phred 12 april 2015  0514 am	positive

i gave this one a 5 its one of the little pirate sets i had during my youth and i loved it for several reasons first of all it contains 2 of my favorite minifigs it can be used as a small independent base or in combination with one of the bigger sets eldorado or trading posts as a lookup or outer defense besides all that this set just looks beautiful i love the colors blue baseplate and the whiteyellow tower one of the best littlemedium sized sets ever made by lego	positive

oky wan kenobi on dec 16 2007 0846 am said lol those star wars heiroglyphics are awesome were those in the movie or is this just a joke by the lego designers that would be the first time tlc showed any kind of reference humor the rest of the set is great too even the skeleton and the stickers yes thats right i actually like those things i like the new skellies because of their posability im a big supporter  user of stopmotion and i think theres nothing wrong with stickers i mean seriously why does everybody hate stickers so much  sure they are a pain in the megablocks to put on and sure they come off after a while and are never usable again but hey you dont have to put them on even better you can save them like i do and use them for your mocs could somebody tell me please im just curious however as i said nice set i might even get one gotta love that marion with the carot torch xd and that arc is neat too by the way are all parts on it golden some more pics on it would be nice as soon as your camera is recharged  thanks peace out as far as i know those insignias on the arc are in the movie too but i dont remember if they actually were on the arc or somewhere else there are a lot of star wars references in all the indiana jones movies looking at your name you might find it funny to know that the asian club of lao che in temple of doom is called club obiwan the plane in the first indy has the callsign cpo which i just found out the other day 	neutral
this and motorcycle chase were the two sets ive wanted from the start i like how you get lots of snakes and ill add my snakes in too for a brickfilm sometimes i like the stickers but all my world city ones got hard and fell off  i like the r2d2 could you take a pic of any hieroglyphics in this setnot the ones on the sticker sheet thanks i want to decode them	positive
my 2nd review what a veteran  again found this set via a shop assistant in my local tru portsmouth uk this evening comes in at 4499 which is pretty steep but you get quite a bit for your money front of the box  back of the box  back of the box closeup  contents  it was a nice surprise to get numbered bags  not had a large set with numbered bags for quite a while at least in none of the sets ive bought recently didnt take a close up of the stickers but i was quite disappointed that the curved pieces had stickers  if they could print the att curved pieces why not these minifigs  oh  and theres a nice backprint on the pilot figure  now the build was pretty good  you build the plane first after the minifigures quite an interesting build in a way becayse for a while you think the back is the front  and then you realise heh now  ive not seen the film in a while but i dont recall a guy flying a plane with a fishing rod  dont flame me if this is what happens see earlier point regards not seeing the film in ages p after that you build the temple in stages starting with the entrance first and then the holey floor section with the spears these spears are just loosely placed into technic holed bricks quite easy to make em flick out but they can go anywhere hehe entrance  holey floor  spears  these two parts are hinged and on an angle to each other and the gap makes for a handy bottomless pit complete with pole for indy to swing over with his whip after that you create the door and the ratchet mechanism to keep it raised after that you add the runners for the ball and the swinging knives trap swords trap  before  after  finally you build the statue that holds the efigy nice bit of construction here especially the way that everything falls over once the efigy is removed do be careful when putting the curved bits on though  it appears one of the edges on mine has slightly bent when putting it on  nowt noticable though temple  preparing to steal  run you can see that the temple has toppled and debris has fallen all around  and then as he goes through the door the door falls he gets his hat and then the rock ball starts a rolling ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun the stickers were a pain though  theres no room for a border around the sticker here beware after all that is done you join all the pieces together and it makes more a really good playset plenty of opportunity for recreating scenes here idol closeup  total set  spares  yet more spare stickers sorry ive already put the spares in my box of bits overall 8 out of 10  lots of play value and a pretty nice build too many stickers though  and defo poor arms for the skeletons edited by imperialshadows 01 june 2008  1218 pm	positive

i just noticed another inconsistency between box art and the actual set  on the box the biplan has white wing supports theyre just plane windows without glass in them and yet the set they are dark grey or is it bley  can never tell the difference without careful study add to that  the outer of the engine at the front is white on the box and black in the set we dont normally have this many inconsistencies do we 	neutral
this set is so cool and another must buy  im in trouble next year it seems the figs are great wub i think the plane is only ok perhaps they should have made that in a separate set as it needed to be a certain size to fit the figs but that meant that the tail is way too short here is a picture of the actual plane so you can see what i mean notice the pilot is fishing   the temple is another story i think lego have done an incredible job with this fitting in the key parts of this sequence without making an absurdly large model addtionally there are many parts in this set that i havent got so it shouldnt be too hard to justify xd thanks for another great review sweet i love the photo of indy running with the idol and the boulder close behind p naith on dec 16 2007 1020 pm said lol is it just me or in the earlier concepts of this set we saw a native on the box i wonder why they removed it  wacko i recall that too  edit yes there was one big pete on dec 16 2007 1128 pm said we dont normally have this many inconsistencies do we  quite annoying ones too i think the plane looks better with those being white	neutral
looks like a nice set i like the tiny turbos and have most of the older individual cars but i am put off by the ever increasing price of the large sets with lots of extra parts that im not really interested in i wish these were available as individual vehicles as well	neutral

picked up from the lego shop in bluewater yesterday front of box back of box price 250 gbp contents a very small instruction manual instructions front intsructions back 25 pieces 23 used in the model regular construction mini fig start of the assembly roll in the drum just attach the drum a little tap with the hammer hammer not included wheel it into position time to start mixing also time for a well earned tea break the cement is all ready now and the 2 left over bits extra cement is always useful and not really wasted overall a nice little set and i am pleased to see little sets appearing again at long last the only negative is with the drum of the mixer although the angle can be adjusted you cannot tip the contents out of the mixer all in all i would say 810 for a good little set comments   edit by hobbes replaced pictures with clickable thumbs and corrected set number	neutral

heres all the parts in assorted baggies and the horribly messed up instructions four astronauts and four aliens with an extra gold visor yay not bad the base of the horribly unstable alien craft the wings move up and down aswell as back and forth the purpose i know not next we build the nerf section of the base basically technic and the rest of the tube connectors heres the farthest i got the little missle to go its fairly dissapointing good thing i didnt expect much from this portion of the set heres the start of the command base more of the main structure will be adding lots of things to all the little beams heres a storage container and the surprisingly not flimsy radar on this side we see the alien elevator it uses a horribly long technic rod i have not seen one of this proportion its like a foot and a half long more of the inner base where all the little tubes shall go all the connected tubes and such i also encountered a problem in the instructions it says for the end of the elevator prong to be touching the tube connector where it is shown here but mine has a 1x space inbetween no matter heres the completed base  my knee again onto the spaceship the bulk of it is just technic supporting beams with some large slope peices covering it all up more on that later the white coverup the middle section lifts up to store the overly large jetpack as you see the storage containers take up most the bulk in the back and you can see the jetpack on the ground aswell as the trigger hand hold thing that allows you to swoosh it look in the back lego greebles despite the large cockpit it only holds one person laying down the wings are really the saving grace  double layered with a nice two toned effect kitty nudged me this picture so its abit blurry my apologies  extra peices and or peices i have no idea where the hell they go p overall the set is quite fun i must admit full price i probably would not go for it but i got it for just under 70 dollars for that price i can confidently say its quite worth it many useful peices nice figures other than the aliens and the tube things are quite fun to boot even though i liked the life on mars system more which i also have none the less its very fun to make them shoot around alright so its not much of a command base either and it looks abit bare but its still fun even if you ignore the nerf section overall i give it a hardy 35 out of 5 the openness and epic fail of a missile launcher are hard to get by but overall its a dandy set d merry christmas wub	positive

happy new year everyone i went to my local walmart looking for an exclusive bionicle set yesterday but was amazed to find everything there sw bionicle ef indie the works i nabbed the jsf and the rogue shadow and scampered home to take pics with my new camera wub the box the same as the other 07 boxes nothing new the back shows the various features with pop out r2  luckily the intruction booklet and the dss were intact not folded like the last mm set i got  the dss not too bad but printed parts would have been great the figs anakin is amazing imo wub fits the cw anie great i noticed on the sh reviews the kiddies were saying how ugly he looked  they need to see the cw cartoon for the sake of my health i should probably stop reading those d the build i wont go too indepth on the build since vader posted a very indepth review here the start of the build the body of the fighter starts out long and skinny the jsfs landing gear allows it to sit comfortably without getting in the way while swooshing r2d2s launching device r2 in position when launched he often gets stuck if you dont press the button hard enough  looks like r2 needs to lay off whatever it is robots eat so far the flag stickered its a big sucker sticker completed i forgot to add the nose stickers before i took the pic warning the nose cone sticker is actually two stickers i thought it was one peeled of one of the stickers and put it on the middle of the two 1x8 plates and didnt notice the other sticker wacko various completed shots i think this was a beautiful little set r2s launching unit and the flick missiles are annoying but easily fixed i plan to add proper cannons in place of the flick missiles anakin is a great minifig but he doesnt look so well standing next to my other figs the brickshelf gallery when public will	positive

okie guys and gals here s time for some droid exploration with my review of set 7670 as a general statement i have to say its really a neat set that is not that expensive for what it holds 1 box art like always i will start with pics of the box art btw notice anything guys  no bloody crappy dss yes finally a set without stickers and that feels great d 2 the mfs nothing really spectacular there the only novelty lies within the inclusion of the new commander yellow torso bd apart from that there are 2 bds and unfortunately yet another sbd i like those but i have a huge amount of them and i would rather had something different you have 3 short blasters and a couple of extra parts 3 the spider droid i think its a pretty cool little buggar its a rather simple yet classic construction i think it has sweet parts such as the bd body in dark bley it really has a spider feel unlike the previous ep3 one 4 the hailfire droid this baby represents the pice de resistance of this set i truly love it  sure its a bit under scale but i dont really mind that its conception is superb even if i totally dislike assembling those technic treads especially 80 of those small things the ellipse of the treads is well balanced and that trans disc is a brilliant idea the great thing is those new flick fire missiles they dont fall unlike the other ones and they do look good on this baby also you can put the wheels together and the missiles to gain some shelf space easy storage on d  in conclusion those druids re really sweet and are perfect target practice for the upcoming rgs hehe  i hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any  yoda	positive

i got this set for a few months 1 or 2 and i agree that it is small but still it looks great on plates clone troopers just for fun 	positive
ah i finally got the 2 city sets i really wanted  i am so happy that lego went postal on us p  since they are rather small i shall do a mix review of these 2 sweet sweet sets 1 mail van 7731 like always ill start with shots of the box art and bloody dss now here are the extras of that set i really love the new torso of the postal worker my huge grip lies on the mail box that mail logo is a freaking sticker  for that part i was so expecting a printed part that is really really bad  apart from that the design is pretty cool the van is quite simple but i think its pretty cute i love the fact that the rear is a window 2 air mail 7732 like always ill start with shots of the box art and bloody dss the extras are ok another great postal worker you also have yet another red trolley with a package that is a bloody sticker yet again  g tlc should have more printed parts  that plane for me is a classic thing of beauty  really is consistent with the fantastic planes of the 80s thats the kind of lanes tlc should produce instead of those huge playmo planes actually i am happy that tlc released that one  for once its not a bloody airline exclusive promo set  here are general pics i love the engines of the plane simple yet superb also the top hatch opens to insert mail and packages the front control panel is a printed part  i love the classic double train windows and here is a poc of the undeneath of the set in conclusion i truly love these small sets they are the perfect size 4 wide car yeay  and the colour pattern is amazing as well i hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any  yoda	positive
i havent spotted these in the us yet im looking forward to finding them overall the 2008 lineup is a excellent and its going to be difficult for me to decide which themessets to pursue theres a lot to choose from	positive
thanks for the great review yoda  im definitely going to get that plane ive sadly only owned one of the many lego planes there is  thebrickster on jan 5 2008 1123 am said i havent spotted these in the us yet im looking forward to finding them overall the 2008 lineup is a excellent and its going to be difficult for me to decide which themessets to pursue theres a lot to choose from really where do you live	positive
thanks for the takes on these two sets yoda stickers or not i still think these are charming sets with all the essence and nostalgia of the older sets back in the 8090s am i the first one to notice the new doors used in the back of the van not only is it using the popular new frame but the old container doors have been redesigned to fit with the new frame as well pity theyre not yellow though	positive
very nice cheers yoda ill definitely be getting the post van not sure about the plane though both are awesome but i think i have enough planes can you tell me though the wheels on the van are they rubber or plastic they look a bit tacky	positive
thank you for the nice review pity of the stickers but the design is nice 80ies on	positive
great review yoda i find myself saying that line alot d  i love these two little sets wub tlc continues the great city line that started in 07 and continues into 08 its also nice to have other sub lines besides fire and police  p i hope there are many more postal sets like a post officethat would be sweet hope these are mainstream and not those damn exclusives  postal on p	positive
thanks for the review i was always going to get these two sets so you havent swayed me at all xd i reckon lego could enhance this subtheme by releasing a post motorbike with or without a sidecar and post office obviouly the office would be the hub of all the activity while the post bike would take care of the postal run this would free up the van to take or recieve bulk mail or parcels to or from the airport it could then also do the parcel deliveries around the city the office would also serve as the reciever for all the parcels the new goods truck might deliver just some thoughts thats all sweet	neutral
i need to do some catching up here p matn on jan 5 2008 0516 pm said could you tell me how much you payed for them i think im gonna buy them tomorrow if they have it already or if i dont see any cooler sets i paid a tad more than the sh price i paid 15 for the plane and 8 for the van sure its a tad more expensive but i didnt want to wait for tru to get them freddie on jan 5 2008 0610 pm said am i the first one to notice the new doors used in the back of the van not only is it using the popular new frame but the old container doors have been redesigned to fit with the new frame as well pity theyre not yellow though great remark there i guess i totally missed that one  and i agree that yellow doors would have been better but those dark bley do not look that bad  mr hobbles on jan 5 2008 0910 pm said can you tell me though the wheels on the van are they rubber or plastic they look a bit tacky rubber off course  they do look a tad tacky but its because they are the thin type like with the racers and i am not a fan of those  phoinix on jan 5 2008 0935 pm said cant wait for your next one tks  me neither though p marvinblue on jan 6 2008 0331 am said i reckon lego could enhance this subtheme by releasing a post motorbike with or without a sidecar and post office obviouly the office would be the hub of all the activity while the post bike would take care of the postal run this would free up the van to take or recieve bulk mail or parcels to or from the airport it could then also do the parcel deliveries around the city the office would also serve as the reciever for all the parcels the new goods truck might deliver so true 8 at one point i was thinking of a impulse set with a yellow bike postman post and letters that would rock  i hope tlc adds to this sub theme and keeps that retro feel wub a yellow dirtbike with sidecar would be a sweet 5 set  also a small town feel post office would be so cool like a 2030 set  we can be sure of one thing though this years advent calendar will have a postamn and small post office  post on  yoda	neutral
thanks for the review  i was actually considering getting these but i saw they were overpriced for my tastes  too bad theyre nifty lil things wub	positive
while the plane does look nice i dont particularly care for the van but the van does have some good parts which is the only reason i would by one yellow mud guards the new windshield and the small door on the rear	neutral
5150 lego on jan 7 2008 0608 am said and the plane hm this has a cute factor and all but i mean comon you have to open a hatch on the roof to get your packages in and what about getting them out you have to flip the plane upside down  weak they should have had a hinged rear end or a hatch on the side yes this is the lego charming no stairs in buildings cars with just one minifig all those things that make lego what it is thanks yoda for your review those posts sets will be mine but i will wait to find them in my supermarket even if i have to wait 2 or 3 months i know that i will save some money so i will buy more lego d there are simple designed sets but we dont need more two nice litle sets that are not oversized and too expensive	positive
thebrickster on jan 5 2008 1012 am said i wasnt real fond of the postal truck at first its so different than those in the us good point b this design is just too foreign to my eyes for me to enjoy i dont like either of these sets very disapointing  the postal theme has so much potential i dont really like the torsos either  too plaincheap as kanal suggested and i will agree that the wheels on the van look cheap i was sooooo impressed with city 2007 this is a real let down though i am happy to see a small set with a postal box so even though all that aside ill probably buy 6 of the van  just for the yellow mudgards postal box and stickers to populate my city and i think this set will provide some excellent piece to moc a yellow civillian convertable with sweet  bm	neutral

beach house reviewed by dunamis set 4996 522 pieces 2995 from target build time 90 minutes yet another interesting creator theme house this one comes fresh of the 2008 line of sets and promises 3 different models packing 522 pieces albeit a lot of 1x1 plates for only 2995 it was hard to pass this one by as i was foraging for the new 2008 star wars sets at the local target plus i was itching to do another review since i had finally fully recovered from my marathon ucs falcon review which took the better part a month to complete the box the box is pretty standard creator type box which shows off the three models beach house caf and towering apartment building the back of the box shows some of the features of the three models interesting features of the three models prominently displayed on the back include  food counter complete with coffee espresso maker and food warmer with chicken leg  home office complete with laptop and the ubiquitous coffee cup  flip up roof granting access inside of beach house note the satellite tv dish and even rain gutters along the roofline opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals were back to the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets note the parts inventory is on the side of the box as well this is a nice feature once inside the box we are greeted by eight sealed bags plus two yellow 16x2 plates and a green 32x16 baseplate thank goodness there is no dss dreaded sticker sheet but alas there are no minifigs in addition there are the three manuals one for each model and they were stuffed into my box with the care of kid trying to put 10 gallons or liters if you prefer of candy in a 5 gallon bucket but hey were not collecting manuals here so who cares if the manuals are all bent and warped the manuals the three manuals are 74 72 and 48 pages in length they are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings  piece call outs for each step  parts inventory at the end of the primary model build  page numbers color separation in these manuals were fine for me plus we get the usual verbose lego instructions on not dumping all your pieces outside in the grass and not to dump all your pieces into a single pile thanks for the tip tlg parts list the pieces pretty standard stuff here and as i mentioned lots of 1x1 plates and tiles at least 100 however we do get quite a few windows and a couple of doors a majority of the color is black and yellow i did see a few pieces that i was not familiar with so im going to show them below keep in mind im not a parts jockey so bear with me if i think a part is brand new for 2008 and it was actually released with the classic space line 2x2 window fixed and 4x3 window that opens the follow photo shows the window glass same as in corner caf door glass and new black parts turns out these black parts are used as wheels i showed the window glass because it still contains the molding circle just like they did before it is hard to see from the photo but it is there the door glass i think might be new i dont recall seeing these 2x2 round plates with clips before and i thought i would show the mail only because it is printed and not a sticker i know these are common but didnt they have four studs on top these only have two how about this sloped 4x3 window that opens overall a nice assortment of parts with nothing juniorized the build the build was fun and was fairly straightforward once you figure out which of the three models to build it goes pretty quick here are a few shots see how the inside is made look at the detail with the flowers and even the outside water faucet outdoor seating area upstairs being built upstairs with opening roof notice the satellite tv dish check out the patio on the upstairs complete with outdoor light and rain gutters heres my favorite the bbq grill at least we know where those new parts go finally check out the tree no juniorization here here is what is left over so far i have only built the primary model the others look interesting especially the caf the design the design was well done very rich in detail i love how there are no juniorized parts the house is accessible by taking off the top floor like caf corner and market street there is an internal staircase as well there is no interior to speak of in the beach house but there is in the other two models the only real negative is that it is kind of small when you get it done it would be nice if it was about 50 bigger here are a few views of the beach house with a few minifigs thrown in check out the closeup of the caf which i think looks great also here is a photo of the interior of the apartment building where you can see the office and computer overall thoughts it is a really nice set a tad on the small side but it has some great detail and lots of features quick enough to build all three models and would fit real nice into an existing town plan is minifig scale but does not come with any lots of window parts and black slopes is a nice diversion from the onslaught of clone wars ships that we cant remember seeing from the movies final rating 84 build 910 pretty quick and fun functionality 910 it is a creator set so you have multiple varied builds diverse enough to keep the kids entertained design 1010 excellent and well thought out outstanding detail for such a small model parts 610 fair nothing earthshattering but lots of slopes and windows price 810 price ratio is good but you get a lot of little parts would be better with minifigs edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0638 pm indexed	positive

am i the only that one that thinks it is not so badwhat i am trying to say is wouldnt planes be this big in real lifei know it has a lot of big pieces but how would they make them any smalleror how would they the big pieces into a bunch of tiny pieceswell any way i do think in some cases that if there is any juniorized involved it should be with duplo complaning off	neutral
thanks for the review unfortunately the pictures did not load for me i have to say having seen other images i do agree with your comments the plane is far to big and not enough details that sums it up for me	negative

hello and welcome to another redman set review well actually the first redman set review im your host redman and today i adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the impulse set simply titled the knight this is a great set with 14 pieces 2 of which are spare and a minifig with 2 weapons 2 helmets and some shiny armour all this is packaged in a tiny box just short of 10 cm or 3 inches with a neat little instruction manual that folds up to the size of the weapons rack included in the set as you can see this set only costs a measly 7 nzd disclaimer redman not included here we see the box clearly showing what the box holds on the top we see a 11 scale picture of a minifig for those new to lego or who have forgotten how big a minifig is i guess  xd the instruction manual showing the nice and easy built with me for size comparison d sorry about the dark image i had to lean over the light to get a birds eye pic  here we see the 2 different soldiers you can make with the set a knight and a guard or standard troop or soldier or whatever you want to call him note each set comes with only 1 minifigure and additional accessories of course you know im in the picture just for the sake of it im not really one of the soldiers xd the neat little weapons rack or rather equipment rack as it holds not only a weapon but a shield except the ovoid ones helmet and armour nice and easy storage so your equipment wont get dirty lying around on the ground d one of the spare parts is another of those robot hands so you can stick that in place of the shield and allow the rack to hold 2 weapons just thought youd like to know that  and here we see the nifty little structure of the thing it can even support a whole minifig note the grey stud on the bottom bar is a spare part i just find it better used there to hold the armour  huh i dont remember this picture 8 it appears i drifted off and these guys dont look too happy i overtook their weapons equipment rack  i should go xd so in conclusion this is a great set for army building at a reasonable price with nice equipment and it can be picked up as a little extra with your normal shopping xd thats all for today folks sweet redman so what do you think should i continue with these redman reviews  p or just stop now xd comments and criticism welcome  peace	positive
great review iamded lots of pics all the details wish i could find some of these sets locally but so far no luck  i fully intend to steal your use of a character to do the reviewing should i ever do one like this xd oh and if eb news presents ever needs someone to do a commercial well be sure to get in touch with you y batbrick on jan 18 2008 0736 am said btw is it just me or does my new avatar make me seem a bit creepy 8 are you sure its the avatar doing it 8 d 	positive
very good reviews i think that redman is really ok a very little cute curious fig sadly he is not in the impulse set  i wish to see redman still around about your creepy avatar yes it look a bit creepy skull nausicaakro this impulse set is storage in 8 copies with 8 wizard set 16 city set 2x 16 mission to mars set so if you want buy 10 of this like me you must find 2 different toy center	neutral
you should continue with these redman reviews there great	positive
thanks everyone for your positive feedback its really appreciated d youd be surprised how long that redman presents thing up the top took me to make xd so it appears people do like redman expect him to be reviewing the good wizard and battle arachnoid in near future i know those have already been reviewed but new zealand never gets sets first so ill just be reviewing the sets i get xd thefrisian on jan 19 2008 0444 am said nice review very detailed y as for the spare parts mine didnt come with any both dark grey 1x1 round plates are used on the weapons rack one for the armour one for the helmet and i only got one robot hand for holding weapons thats strange maybe im just lucky xd i also got 2 spare orange viking horn pieces in my battle arachnoid d peace	positive
thanks agentrick actually redmans based on the wrestling costume version of spiderman as seen in this set sweet peace	positive

well today i finally got my hands on set 7038 now since the moment i first saw pics of this set i knew it was for me so lets start with the new troll helmet and torso these are both great this troll really stands out as a leader when next to the usual trolls in the dwarf mining set ok so heres a few shots of the front of the set now one thing i really like about this set is the way that lego have placed the back wheels higher than the front this allows the set to really appear to being pulled here we have a shot at the missiles on the wagon these are better than some around i have to say if you look just behind the bottom missile you will see a simple firing device simply push it down and then let it go to see those missiles fire the troll flag is moved behind the missiles for firing one thing that does bother me about this set is the lack of anything on the rear ok its easy to fix with a little mocing so its not the end of the world but i would of liked something placed there now lets move on to the crownies wagon this is simple yet good for holding weapons as for the crown knights themselves well there the ones from the impulse sets which is great imo heres a few quick shots of the 2 larger trolls we have so far i prefer the sand green one what about you well thats the end for now requests for pics and comments are welcome overall i rate this set as a must for anyone whos a fantasy castle fan i know ill be getting more of this set as for the new wagon well its joined up with the other trolls i do hope the impules crownies i bought today can handle them oh and yes i did change the knights heads xd  fantasy war on vader	positive

this is fantastic i love the new helmets for the goblins sweet ive always loved the chicken leg thing really screams lego to me at least how lego used to be  great little bit the goblins are awesome too and the sand green one should look good next to the tan onesgives a nice feeling of a real species in reality not all members of a species are identical its great seeing them in different colors great review xd	positive
thank you for the review vader that set looks worth buying 8 i think you gave me a good reason to buy it 	positive
great review vader  as ive said before this is a nice set but doesnt really come with anything that doesnt come with the other sets of the line for this reason it will be somewhere at the bottom of my list for 2008 also i like torso and helmet of the dwarf mining orcs much better the colours make the torso look rather dull and boring while the other more brown one looks much clearer and more exciting i think i like the knight helmet better too looks more covering and threatening than this one although ill save my judgement until i have one in my hands thanks again vader  edit forgot to mention hilarious pic in your sig vader d edited by tinypiesrus 19 january 2008  0828 am	negative

a troll driven by a turkey leg what a wonderful little detail d d thanks for the review vader very clever using a flag to hide that crazy firing device i find it rather odd they used blue pins for this black or gray wouldve been alot more discrete about the big trolls i think using different colours is good i dont think a troll force would be very organized so different colours would make the effect complete y  as for your troops looks quite fearsome definitely compared to my pathetic number of soldiers  a nice set but i would rather get the attack on tower though no matter about the price difference	negative

lego city truck  forklift set  7733 pieces 343 price 2499 usd store of purchase toys rus release date january 2008 after discussion of the mysterious yellow cargo contained in this new city transport set and a visit to my local tru i purchased this set i was immediately pleased with the pricepiece which i think is pretty reasonable 343 pieces for 25 starting with the box great city artwork boasting special edition tha backside of the box no alternate models comes as no surprise the dreaded decals i was looking for the skull and bones for radioactive but no such luck my favorite part of the set a very clever forklift side view and the backside what i like about the forklift is the bars across the top giving the vehicle a reallife design the double wheels in the front with two pieces that can hold the wheels also adds to a clever design i like the figs although not much new  perhaps ill make the driver into a werewolf later the set includes three cargo pallets the first some sort of fuel with gauge the 2nd two indy containers and a square 2x4 brick i have not put the decals on yet and the mysterious yellow cargo your guess is as good as mine   on to the truck the front section the front grill another angle the back i like the opening mechanism that is very simple but works well also is the large plate tile piece inside i like this because the entire interior has no studs and the trailer section of the truck orange and yellow tail lights and the rear trailer open the complete set summary this is a neat set that reminds me a bit of classic lego city but larger it is very playable and has a lot of accessories adding to the value the build was very simple and enjoyable took me about an hour it is a great addition to a number of city sets including the cargo ship container stacker the world city cargo train and the new cargo plane as i mentioned previously i have not yet put on the decals that im sure will really add to the overall look of the set the forklift is awesome and i like the cargo containers the truck could have benefited from a few additional details chrome smokers and an undercarriage box that really opens considering everything i would buy this set again hope you enjoy and perhaps this mysterious cargo will make its way into a brickster mystery y	positive
question whats different with this special edition btw nice shots	neutral
brickmaster on jan 19 2008 1227 am said its either that or its a toysrus exclusive set as my armoured drilling unit box also had special edition on it special edition mean that its a store exclusive set the cargo theme is a tru exclusive and another example is thr tie crawler is exclusive to target also can th doors be opened on either side	neutral

some guy on jan 19 2008 1117 pm said i think the special edition is just for making people intrested and make them want to buy that set or something hmm thats a thought but why would they pick this particular set i would expect theyd do that with a slightly bigger set like the heavy hauler perhaps why do you think theyde pick this one	neutral
mr tiber on jan 19 2008 0246 pm said hmm thats a thought but why would they pick this particular set i would expect theyd do that with a slightly bigger set like the heavy hauler perhaps why do you think theyde pick this one good question maybe its merely a gimick to help push the city sets with all the other competing themes the cement mixer is a special edition as well	neutral
this set looks pretty good to me it is six wide isnt it that is nice for a truck like this	positive
5150 lego on jan 20 2008 1150 am said great review my only grip with this set is you can only fit one pallet in the truck it should have been the same size as the trailer so you can at least fit 2 pallets seems like alotof wasted space if im going to transport cargo i want to use the maximum amount of space aviable xd thats a fair gripe someone else mentioned it above as well i thought the same thing when i went to load it	neutral
i got this set last week and just to add a few of my own points cons  the forklift spring feels a bit flimsy  i dont know how long it will last or how much stress it would take  and the end coil isnt really heavily secured to the lift mechanism time will tell on that one  30 stickers its the exoforce of city sets the truck set does look less plain with them on though i would reccomend lining them up with the green brick in the second container rather than applying the first lot without a guide or they may end up uneven  its very hard to put the minifig in the forklift without dismantling or breaking open the set slightly  the cargo box attached to the main cabin of the truck doesnt hold very strongly  minifigs are dull  that dark blue torso with pattern is way overused  green stickers are a different green to the bricks themselves pros  lots of nice pieces including the large white panels and cargo pieces and i like the green white colour scheme  the cargo doors open well and the hingeing mechanism doesnt stand out to the detriment of the rest of the set as some people have complained about the mail airplane  studless floor in cargo containers makes it easy to move pallets in and out  fits in better than the heavy hauler to a minifig sized city  new 1x1x4 slope at least i hadnt seen it before overall  nice set with some good pictures although a bit flimsy and way too many stickers  the same issues i have with the cargo plane as well although that had more colour issues	positive
hey thanks for the review the brickster i was just wondering if you could possibly upload a picture of the instructions for the forklift and if possible tell me the piece  of the 1x4 slope bricks to bricklink them thanks	neutral

well since noone seems to have done one for this set here we go heres the complete set in all its glory yes i really like it but then tabletown has the capacity to support it and my green army have their eyes on it as a potential military transport as well  ill start out with the little airport ground car thingy  very neat and functional here are views front and back next up the steps which allow the plane crew to embark and disembark and to round off this little trio the cargo loading platform here in its lowered position note the prong thingy sticking out from the rear and here raised the prong thingy is now hinged up to support the back of the platform and keep it level heres a slightly different angle so you can see the pieces under there the allimportant cargo itself hmmmnot much for a plane this size the cargo pallet slots neatly onto the loading platform heres the complete set of ground equipment  all attached and so onto the plane itself note that unlike the other large planes the main wing sits at the top of the row of bricks making up the side of the fuselage i took it apart a little so you can see the internal construction of the fuselage note that the cargo area is really small right at the back what else is this thing carrying illegal immigrants  a picture of the rear of the fuselage just because i like the sticker front landing gear way better than on the other large planes i dont know if this is a new piece or what but ive had no problems with it at all and my kids have been playing with it as well the rather sexy rear undercarriage  this area reminds me of one of those giant russian transport planes  wicked those angled grey slopes atop each side of the rear undercarriage annoy the heck out of me as they keep coming off whenever i pick the plane up i think a 1x4 plate on top to bind them together might solve that a slightly blurry view sorry from underneath the gear looks like it might be capable of retracting internally but alas no this is a shame as theres certainly enough room in there and its a wasted opportunity imo might have to modify that a view of one of the four engines i personally think they look too small and should have something under the wing as well to make them rounder cockpit crew door open i love the smooth action of these doors and the way they seal flush against the fuselage when closed cargo door open crew door with docked ladder cargo door with docked loading platform cargo slots inside and locks into place the same way it sits on the loader neat the minifigs sorry this one is a bit blurry and that concludes this weeks show and tell dr s	positive

thank you very much for a good and informative review doc sinister y this looks like the best of the bigplanes to me very nice and smoother than the rest  although like youve said what the heckre they transporting diamonds and pearls so much wasted space and the landing gear should really fold in n	neutral
i loved the pics in the catalogues but was a bit disappointed by the build and end result my own thoughts cons  as noted the cargo space is really small considering the size of the plane although i can see this is restricted due to playability  without the barrier in the middle the cargo would slide all over the place while the plane was being swooshed  the cargo lift im not sure how else to describe it is very weak and snaps off although it is a clever design i think its badly implemented  there is nothing to hold the cargo pallet to the cargo lift truck so it tends to slide off all over the place as soon as the truck moves  colour issues  i had at least 3 shades of green with the larger plane pieces and noticeable variances even with identical cargo hatch pieces at least one of them also came quite scratched which was a little disappointing  at 7995 aud its 10 more than the passenger plane was with less pieces and figs and no printed pieces whatsoever more  for less methinks pros  lots of nice cargo crate pieces and even the stickers for these are pretty good  landing gear piece adjusts very well to height differentials so the plane doesnt lose its gear as often as the earlier passenger planes  the hinging mechanism works very well to open the cargo holds  opens very smoothly and is not noticeable  id definitely like to see more of this technique  the little vehicles work well chained together and are all good small designs overall  i really like the large planes since 06 but i dont think theyve still quite hit the nail on the head whereas the earlier planes were a little flimsy this one is sturdier but has its own issues the look of the cargo plane is nice and the new landing piece and cargo hatch pieces are really great but some design weaknesses and colour issues detract from the overall product its a shame as with a bit of tweaking this could have been a musthave set	negative
wow thats a great review of a great set dr s y as you yourself have already noted this has the potential to be a fantastic military moc with a bit of modification you can get the engines to be rounder or perhaps do away with them completely and replace them with jet engines sweet though i cant think of a system to retract the undercarriage at the top of my head it seems like theres indeeed more than enough potential to do so it reminds me rather of an ilyushin il76 one of my favourite cargo planes 	positive

nice review dr s i have been thinking long and hard about the scale of the planes in my town i would like to keep my passenger planes in their classic 4wide fuselage style but i really dont mind the new plane hull pieces if they are used as an enormous transport plane like the ilyushin76 unfortunately i cant afford this lovely new green one at the moment which would be perfect to go with my green army as i took too much of a hit buying the new 2008 star wars sets but i have modified my white one to take huge cargo loads in fact my apc is designed specifically to fit inside unfortunately im a bit busy to take pics at the moment but hope to put some up soon	neutral
if i do end up geting this set it will be for my slowly growing army btw nice review y	neutral
thank for the review doc the only thing i like in this set is the small car so i will not buy this set just for it i really dislike those new planes toooo bbiiiigggg with this size this cargo plane can carry just fiew things what a shame i think that the way tlc has made the wings is not very good like the rest of those big pieces just my thought the positif point of this its that it makes me saved some money d	negative

hello and welcome to another oh wait first batbrick and iamded review today us two sworn enemies will be reviewing the creator cargo chopper here is the front of the box and while pushing iamded to his doom here is the back haha ouch oh dearhere are the parts anyway here is the instruction of the first model the cargo chopper i love creator sets for the different models they always excite me just ignore me finishing off my nemesis in the background something very interesting that i liked in the instructions was this step where you must add those three 2x2 yellow rounded pieces under the chopper this is for support while you build which is handy and later you take it off and even later use it as the cargo i found that to be rather innovative and clever as well as  hey what are you hitting me for both instruction booklets have the same back now heres the chopper itself i love the design of it it isnt quite minifig scale but its great all the same this is my first nonxpod or house creator set and it sure is fun here me and iamded go for a dizzy ride i love the nose of the copter and the landing gear is fantastic a shot from the other side oh dear it seems weve been a bit sick from that ride and were vomiting transgreen 1x1s the cargo itself is nicely made though i forgot to put on two tiles here   it fits in real well with the chopper to and the line is great for giving iamded the wedgie he deserves this is my first power function set so i was pretty excited the motor is intergrated really well into this set and is activated by pushing that little 3x2 plate with the 1x1 slopes on it forward until it hits the motor button that orange knob another point of interest is the use of bley barrels on each side i like this as i dont have those pieces in that colour a shot of the motor its really simple all you do is pull the hook out to any length that allows then press the orange button and it will wind it back up this makes the chopper pull the cargo up into its bay and iamded pull me here reluctantly to a whacking a top view is that my head a view of the chopper without the cargo in it i love the lowered cockpit the leftover pieces from building note iamdeds head does not count as set piece and a final shot of the set with me and iamded oh it appear were dead oh dear hope you enjoyed this review soon i will post the two alternate models i loved this chopper its great to play with and has nice construction it also has some handy pieces too the motor function sounds like a gimmick but is well intergrated into this model well worth the price so far this is another win for creator i say so far i recommend this model but later well see if the alt models are up to scratch also since this is my first review comments and criticism welcome on everything batbrick away  edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0637 pm indexed	positive

thanks everyone heres part 2 the second instruction booklet includes instructions for both alternate models which is good i hate having too many manuals here she is the plane its very nice and well proportioned but where did iamded get that laser overview the landing gear is very sturdy and nice and the wings are surprisingly good top view iamdeds head fell into the propellers i was trying to save him honest a view of how the motor on this one works by pushing the orange button you can make the prop spin it is well integrated like the chopper though the prop only spins for about 2 12 seconds still its a nice feature the tail is also well made simple but lovable oh and check out that tank the prop spinning agh is that my hand final view there seems to be some sort of explosion here 8 well i think i got iamded more than me atleast the second model is also great though not as good as the chopper the lack of space to fit something into the cockpit brings it down a bit but it is a very nice model overall i recommend it though unlike the chopper it will be hard to mod into minifig scale so far so good with 4995 here are the leftover pieces from the model enjoy batbrick away 	positive

6258 smugglers shanty overview smugglers shanty was released in 1992 it consisted of 69 pieces 3 minifigs two pirates one imperial and it cost 925 usd the set itself is a small but rather sturdy den for the pirates review the minifigs consist of two pirates and one imperial the minifigs are not all that rare which is disappointing i would of liked a rarer fig but still it is a good cheap source of pirate and imperial figures here is an overall shot of the set which includes the three figs the shanty which is made using palm leaves pieces and a nice grey shark nibbling at the soldiers oar a close up of the soldier rowing hard in his boat i would have preferred to have a normal soldier with shako hat as i have more officers than normal soldiers now and a close up snap of the main structure note the wine glass which was a nice touch funnily enough only 4 pieces of treasure were included in this set compared to the usual 8 gold coins in other sets a view from the back which also gives a good view of the pieces used to construct the shanty mainly simple black 1 by 1 bricks the shanty looks good from most angles but their are a few where the roof construction looks rather odd but that is just a minor nitpick yet another view from the front this time at a slightly different angle the yellow base plate looks rather nice too i prefer it over the tan pieces we trend to get nowadays attack the stupid drunk pirate in the background does not even notice overall i think this is a rather good set despite some shortcomings such as the lack of treasure and odd roof from some angles the shark imperial soldier and useful parts make up for it and of course the price is cheap on most auction sites i got mine for a mere 5 10 with the cheapest price on bricklink being 8 rate the set then leave your comments thoughts and opinions	positive
first ill comment on the review and at a later date ill comment on the set youve done a top job lord of pies y youve captured the set from a variety of angles and posed the minifigures interestingly	neutral
very nice review lord of pies thanks for taking the time to put this together and especially for all the detailed pics y i very much regret that my dark ages occured when they did basically i missed out on all the cheap and easy troop building sets and this one is certainly no exception the big sets are nice but these are the ones that always make me wish just a little harder for a return of lego pirates  i gave it a 4 out of 5 just because id buy 4 out of 5 sitting on the shelves today were it possible	positive
great small set that can help you add to you minifig count the little boats are always cool and the den isnt that bad either	positive
another firstrate review its a nice little set with a big number of minifigs and 2 flintlock guns is also a nice bonus	positive
a very nice review of a pretty and neat little set thanks lord of pies guess it´s a 3 for me with strong tendencies to 4	positive
first of all excellent review 55 for me i have yet to attain one of these sets it has a nice trio of men including a redcoat and a nice assortment of weapons the rest such as the leaves is great for mocing imperialshadows on feb 19 2008 0841 pm said i gave it a 4 out of 5 just because id buy 4 out of 5 sitting on the shelves today were it possible if i saw 5 of these sitting on a shelf i would certainly buy all 5 then i would ask to speak with a manager to see if there is any way i can attain more pirate lego stuff simonwillems on feb 19 2008 0847 pm said nice poll as well but you made sure nobody can give this set a 1 which is very nice but probably a little mistake d  i gave it the toprating one should not step into the pirates domain and give a mere 1 to any non4 pirate set duke	positive

laurinator i dont mind an occassional old review coming back to life for discussion but it seems youve replied to many old reviews that have been stagnant for years please try to refrain from bumping a lot of old topics as it pushes down new content that should really be the focus of discussion now	neutral
well since this topic has resurfaced i would add my 2 cents about my appreciation of this set it was the first and unfortunately the largest pirate set i owned as a kid but i played the wazoo out of it some of the minifigs have lost almost all their face printing after so many play sessions theres just something about the hut that appealed to me more than the cheesy skullface islands we keep gettingprobably that it wa kind of neutral good for my pirates settlers or islanders though the palm leaves were rather fragile and used to break off the studded parts it would be nice to get more of these beach village army builder sets edited by ardelon 21 september 2014  0340 pm	neutral

so here it is finally my first ever review of a lego setoh wait its actually 2 sets so i dont really know how to do it right but ill try the best sorry if some pictures are a litte bit dark but im not really into photography and i got bad light here lets start with the dwarfs mine defender theme castle 2008 set name dwarfs mine defender number 7040 pieces 86 price 999 eur first as always the box the back a few instructions on how the defender works for those how dont know   and the instructions we continue with the minifigs sorry i forgot to make a closeup of the dwarf and finally the mine defender itself i personally think it isnt as bad as maybe some people think the chain for the catapult is great i think i kinda love those controls the mechanism with the rubbe rband actually works pretty well but only on a notglossy underground thats pretty much all of it its small but i like it a lot so lets go on to the tower raid now which would be my absolute favorite of those new sets  theme castle 2008 set name tower raid number 7037 pieces 364 price 2999 eur again first the box  instructions we got 2 sets of instructios here one for the tower and one for the siege tower the minifigs we got one archer and one soldier here both with the torsos of the 2007 sets now thw orc side starting with the great leader with the new armor and the golden helmet i love those pieces closeup of the armor  helmet then we got another orcknight and the prisoner with handcuffs the crownie tower looks great overall though there is something i dont really like about it but later on that now the back and that is what really bothers me there areno walls on the first floor except the one with the wallpiece and the door and theprison also is open at the back the orc easily could jump out there not sure what these are all about they really dont add much to the set enough rant now lets go on with a pretty sweet detail the golden crystal on the little table the wall piece on the first floor you can ram in and finally the very best thing of this set the amazing orc siege tower from the front the great working ram you can pull it back very far and it got pretty much power here we got another sweet detail the siege platform that moves out by pulling a cord in the back of the tower finally a picture of a bit siege action if you ram in the lower wallpiece the brown shelfs of the prisonfloor collapse and the prisoned orc is finally free summary likes as i mentioned before i really think thats the best ever produced siege tower its got so mich details and works extremely well also the overall look of it is magnificant the destroymechanism of the tower is pretty cool too the brown door is a fine detail too nothing much to say about the mine defender i like this little set and theres nothing really to bother about it dislikes the back of the tower thats really the only thing thats a bit bad imo they could have put there 2 more walls on the first floor and something to lock the prison easily final thought the tower raid for me personally is the best of the 2008 sets so far its got great playability and looks simply good my opinion buy it	positive
tks for these cool reviews metalandi  i love these orc sets  i am so going to get these  im happy to see that scared face again i love it really  and the use of that handculfs  that new armour looks really cool that tower is really nice and i wont mod it that much which os cool and the battle ram is freaking sweet  tks again for sharing  yoda	positive
great review pictures and all thanks for showing all the mechanisms of the tower i didnt notice them from either the pics we had or the instructionsit didnt hit me that when you knock down the wall the second floor breaks that is a genius idea this looks like a superb set unfortunately my priority right now is the troll warship still if that really is us 80 i might skip it and go for this instead which is only 20 us one note though i think there might not be a back cage on the second floor of the tower so that the mechanism can work did you try to see if the second floor ground still falls if you add it a fourth cage wall also you could just pretend that the tower is built against a mountainside it would fit perfectly and add more defense to the knights great review  vk	positive
thanks for these fantastic review its the first time i take a good look at these sets there is a good chance ill buy the dwarfs mine defender especially for that price	neutral
this set didnt come with the new jail door piece id have guessed it would have since there is an orc in prison nice review im looking forward to picking up these sets steve	neutral
thank you for these fine reviews metalandi y therere really some nice playable features in the tower raid set and all these great orc torsos just sweet and it even looks like that black orcarmors a new piece lovely 	positive

the tower raid has the best price per piece ratio in the whole 2008 line thanks for the review 	positive
thanks metalandi these are 2 great sets im definately looking forward to seeing these in new zealand stores the collapsing floorprisoner freeing mechanism on the tower is wonderful a great touch some slight modifications like some walls will make this perfect and the dwarfs mine defender is a sweet little set with some neat minifigs thanks for the reviews y peace	positive
sweet wow another excellent review haha that tower does reminds me of kk ii of mistland tower x well overall i love these 2 sets very very much sweet	positive
thank you for the nice review pity the tower is not designed better but i still want to buy these 2 sets if only there were 2 dwarves in the dmdefender	neutral
i got myself today 3 dwarfs mine defender and i have to say that sets does suck big time the plastic rubber band doesnt do squat and 3 wheels i really not enough i only built 2 of those and changed the front of it with 4 wheels and no plastic rubber band and i changed the 2x2 dark bley plate its still looks good but the crappy rubber band system is really not well thought off anyhow my orc army is growing  yoda	negative
xwingyoda on mar 1 2008 0632 am said its still looks good but the crappy rubber band system is really not well thought off yoda i totally agreed with your comments the rubber system is not effective at all i bought 2 defenders recently and i found out that when the wheels move the rubber just stuck there without rotating the blades at the front  i have not really found a solution for mine yet so far i only took out the rubber band placing the blades on the ground removing of the red technic part on the left side in this way when the defender is moving on smooth ground the blades will move too 	negative
thanks for the great review y the siege tower does look great ill have to look out for these sets edited by zouave 14 march 2008  0724 pm	positive
hello eurobricks my first post yesterday i will buy this two sets im waiting for the packs sorry but my english isnt good	positive

yeah the open towers are kinda funny although they were also typical of for instance 90s pirate sets the trolls vehicles are cool though they look evil i cant wait to start collecting 08 castle setsi didnt buy any castle in 07 i only got one set for xmas so im catching up on the 07 stuff first before its all sold out	neutral
now that this topic has been brought up again i just want to say that the rubber band on my dwarf mine defender actually works	positive

green grocer reviewed by dunamis set 10185 2352 pieces 14995 from the lego store glendale ca build time 65 hours holy guacamole almost exactly one year after caf corner was released we get the third installment in the increasingly popular lego exclusive town series combined with the famous 10182 caf corner and its trusty companion 10190 market street this trio makes the foundation for an amazing city block of lego goodness for those new to this series of sets check out my reviews of the two previous sets in this line cafe corner market street i would not necessarily recommend reading too many of my reviews in one setting as you might experience loss of brain cells andor drowsiness you have been warned so how does green grocer stack up to the two previous sets you ask well follow along kind reader and i shall attempt to unravel this question the box the gigantic box is pretty standard and looks amazingly similar to the caf corner box the back of the box shows some of the features of the green grocer as well as a lot of the cool interior that was absent from the previous sets in addition we are shown an image of the three sets together and a small insert image showing how they connect together as if we could not master that difficult maneuver opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals as it seems to be the norm now we have the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets however upon opening the tabs we are pleasantly surprised to find a cardboard tray have not seen one of those in a while as you can see in the photo we have two 32x16 green base plates three instruction manuals and a bunch of bags that are broken into four groups group 1 has 12 bags and goes with the first manual and builds the first floor group 2 has 9 bags and goes with the second manual to build the second floor group 3 has 14 bags and goes with the third manual for the top floor and roof and one bag that is not numbered and hence you can open it whenever you feel like it there are no stickers  yay moving right along we get to the three instruction manuals the manuals the three manuals are 55 47 and 47 pages in length they are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings  piece call outs for each step  parts inventory at the end of the second manual  page numbers color separation in these manuals was fine for me except dark bley and black we get a nice photo of all three sets together plus we get a nice tip showing how to split up the bags and what goes where those additional pieces you see in the photo just below the numbered bags are the pieces that come from the single unnumbered bag along with the base plates parts list random manual shot the pieces upon opening the first set of bags one thing is clear there are a ton of little tiny pieces the minifigs are included in this first section as well interesting to note that there are a handful of printed pieces and as i mentioned previously no stickers we also get a host of new and exciting pieces to add to our collection keep in mind my scope of lego sets is generally centered around star wars technic creator and the occasional racer set so what is new to me might have been around 15 years at any rate here are some of the more interesting pieces again note the printed tiles this time around lego has decided to include 33 more minifigs than the caf corner and market street sets yes we get four minifigs instead of three here are the cast of characters pictured left to right is sir top hat miss jenny blue overalls patti o furniture and little timmy cub scout ill leave it up to the minifig aficionados to decipher which torsos are new and to tell us all about the hairpieces i can say with reasonable certainty that the four yellow smiley heads are not new somebody check that dont forget the lovable little cat named tom he is the archrival of the mouse jerry that lives downstairs overall there are a lot of pieces large variety and wide range of colors the build if you have either of the two previous sets you will feel right at home here just like in the previous builds it seems like the first ten build steps are consumed with laying a bunch of 1x1 1x2 and 2x2 tiles everywhere almost feels like 30 of the pieces are used up right away see below there are several sections where you build various parts of the interior take a look at the cash registercounter below and the beverage cooler and the produce stand and everything that goes in it looks like someone has mail looks like someone just had a baby this set is incredibly well done and gives inspiration to go back and add similar items to caf corner and market street as before the average builder is introduced to some new building techniques like using the hinge plates to make the angles on the front of the building as shown below also the top of the roof shows some interesting ideas overall it is a really fun build that kept me entertained the whole way the design this is a great set with lots of little details i especially like the little mouse hole in the wall leading to the jerry the mouses area they even included a little slice of cheese it seems the designers cant get away from the usual staircase which i always feel is way too big maybe future designs can incorporate a spiral staircase to save room for other things in the model one welcome addition is the fire escape as seen below im going to show a bunch of examples of various items in the set so you can get the feel of the amazing detail in this design take a look at the lamps torches just outside the door and the streetlight with fire hydrant brickwork and archway awning here is the back side of the building note the trashcans and yard tools here is a closeup of the railings on the second story balcony and the second photo is the finished product with curtains in the window nice use of cups to make the banister on the second floor here is the fireplace on the second floor second floor staircase with toms hiding spot check out the radiator on the third floor more third floor nice grandfather clock and rug third floor check out the deck that is up on the roof complete with two chairs table umbrella flower pots and grill interesting use of minifig hammers on the roof finally here is what is left over when were done a couple of shots of the front a shot of the back and here are all three together overall thoughts this is an incredible set and the best of the three in my opinion it is hard to top caf corner but i believe green grocer just did i absolutely love all the details and building techniques that went into making this set there is a ton of different parts and wide color selection as usual we get a bunch of tiles and small plates but that goes with the series also we get four minifigs and lots of minifig accessories im giving this set a score of 100 i thought about it and i really dont know how they could have made it any better in short run dont walk to go pick this set up final rating 100 build 1010 excellent  lots of nice interiors details and accessories to build functionality 1010 outstanding raises the bar with interior and detail think caf corner on steroids design 1010 excellent  cant say enough good things about it parts 1010 great selection and diverse colors great minifigs price 1010 price ratio is excellent but lots and lots of little parts well worth the price as alway feel free to comment complain and question what you see here id like to hear your feedback on this amazing set	positive
wow thats a great review im glad you took so many pictures this set is far better than i ever expected it to be the detail inside is great is it the first set youe given 100 to	positive
a great reveiw dunamis y  you have only backed up what i thought when the pictures first appeared if you are a lego fan there is no excuse not to buy this set it is a must have i love the mouse hole and the mouse and his cheese wub 	positive
very nice very nice indeed lots of lovely little details even at the back this review hasnt changed my opinion one bit im still looking forward to when i can finally pick up mine at the post office im crossing my fingers that there will be more buildings following after this one im guessing that legos just testing the waters to see how far afols are willing to go regarding price vs details green grocer is still epic though	positive
for some silly and quite delusional reason i thought that i had a chance to review this first d but yours is at your house and mine is hopefully winging its way to me  thanks for the review it will help me survive until mine arrives i love this set wub hopefully there will be many more stunning sets like this to come sweet xwingyoda on mar 8 2008 0803 pm said i didnt know green grocer had a rodent infestation  neither did i and i have looked through the instructions at least three times 	positive

what a beautiful set tlc give the designer a pay rise immedietly i was lucky to order one of these while they were on sale to us aussies  but dont worry lego the 100 you saved me will be spent on more sets like this carnt wait to watch my kids rescue residents in distress from those upper level windows with the fire fighters	positive

great review great set i cant mine until after easter weeps	positive
this is a nice review thanks for all the great pictures	positive
truly an awesome review thanks dunamis i ordered my two copies one to build one to store in the vault last week cant wait to get this one the attention to detail here is what makes the set great theres nothing to criticize about this set its really the closest thing to perfection that i have seen from tlc the difference between this set and cc is the interior detail and because of that gg now become in my opinion the best set ever released by tlc do the ccggms sets fit well with the 50th anniv town plan my impression is that out of the box at least they dont which is too bad however i dont think it would be hard to mod the town plan so it looks like it belongs in the same town as ccggms these sets to me are what i have always wanted from tlc as an adult i hope they keep up the line and add more elements to this excellent lineup	positive
wow thanks for the nice review i have the other 2 sets and waiting for this to come to our shores stupendous design and details i really like the hammerrails on the roof cant wait wub	positive
thanks for all the feedback as you can tell i really enjoyed building it cardinal brick on mar 8 2008 0926 am said is it the first set youe given 100 to yes it is i gave cafe corner a 96 and i felt this was a better set and improved on the things that i dinged cafe corner on lack of minifigs was one thing thats why i enjoy reading the comments so i can see if my ratings are in line with what everyone else thinks and to see if i missed anything i cant wait for some of you to build it and share your thoughts as well	positive
a very informative review indeed thank you so much for doing so now i know that the price is worth every penny leaving my pocket  what do you guys think is tlc putting up as the next modular set is it asking too much of tlc to produce 1 modular set each quarter 4 times a year	positive

wow another old technic set review by you nice set and thanks for that review	positive
looks like you have the original 1989 version with the yellow top cylinders  i got one too several years ago although i probably paid too much for it p on a side note if that pneumatic tubing feels harder and stiffer than the modern type i highly recommend that you dont use it and buy some of the newer stuff off bricklink instead tlc originally used a different material for the tubes and this stuff degrades the nozzles on pistons switches and so on over time the old tubes also grip the nozzles much more firmly and if you arent careful when removing them its actually possible to rip off the nozzles completely xo i had this happen a few years ago although tlc replaced my broken pistons for free i got rid of that stuff for good after that although the pistons on my power crane still have slightly discolored nozzles edited by cp5670 10 march 2008  0457 am	neutral
cp5670 on mar 10 2008 0553 am said the old tubes also grip the nozzles much more firmly and if you arent careful when removing them its actually possible to rip off the nozzles completely xo i actually noticed that while taking it apart but didnt really pay any attention i just thought thats because its an old part well thanks for the information	neutral
great pictures especially the perspective from overhead this is one of my favorite technic models because it packs so many features in a relatively small space and im working on documenting this one in technicopedia right now thanks for the photos eric	positive
simonwillems on mar 10 2008 0132 pm said that threaded axle never stopped intriguing me it was use in so few sets i believe 8851 contained one as well and i still dont know why its better than any other axle the purpose of the threaded axle is to carry tension regular axles are used primarily for carrying torsion for gears sometimes for compression 8855 landing gear helicopter skids and sometimes just for looks roll cages canopies but used in tension connectors will usually just pop off with the threads and the corresponding nuts this part can be used to squeeze parts together like the pen in the plotter of 8094 or to hold heavy assemblies onto turntables like 8862 and 8851 with the power crane 8854 reviewed here that is the complete list of sets which used this part i wrote about it here httpwwwericalbre1984htmlparts eric	neutral

hi this is my third oldschool technic set review i dont want to talk much please enjoy just the pictures 1 the parts 2 building the two axles you can see in the middle are not connected and dont belong to each other the axle on the left side is for the steering on the right side for the engine the darkgray technic gear 16 tooth with clutch allows the connection from the differential gear to the engine trough the axle for the steering the v6engine the winch thats a part you dont see everyday a 1x2 rack it only reappears in 2 sets from 2001 and 2004 the rebel wrecker has been released in 1994 the front double wishbone with antisway barsuspension yeah i got it from technopedia xd  the finished model 3 random shots i really like this picture authoritative isnt it 8 d thanks for viewing the pictures please comment if you want to	neutral
thanks for reviewing all these old sets will you be doing any more	positive
yeah if i rebuild and wash a model i will record it glad to see you liked it	positive
this set is really cool i might actually get it	positive
nice pictures i also sort out the pieces the same way if im rebuilding a model y this set packs a lot of functionality into a fairly small size but was rather expensive for its size 70 when it was still available compared to other sets of that time you can also rig up the technic flag sticker that it comes with to the main model ive done that on mine you may want to reinforce it with tape if youre going to leave the model on display though as it will break up over time due to uv exposure like many stickers do i had to do that with mine after it started to crack although it still looks pretty good	positive
the only original stickers are the front headlightpatterns on the 2 red 1x2 bricks the others have been destroyed  must have been the bad decaying sticker quality that breaks when youll remove it  so i printed them i didnt print the flag for only the alternate model needs it although its a neat idea and lordgalewind clickey i keep that in mind one of my 8880 is already dusty enough	negative
thanks for reviewing this classic set i got it when it first came out and still love it the suspension steering and robust look of the model havent been done that well ever since this set puzzled me though back in the days the rear suspending part containing the differential and some gears was shown different on the box from the instructions in the instructions it showed that the grey part of the suspension in the back had to be made using a 1x2 smooth tile and 4 cornerplates 2x2 in grey the box however showed a much sturdier solution using a 1x8 tile and a 1x8 plate it is also visible on the cover of the instructions the pieces i mean are in this picture bernddasbrot on mar 9 2008 0705 pm said otherwise great set	positive
hmm seems like the wheels are recycled into the harley truck in the 2008 batman set	neutral
ive seen a few cases like this where the box pictures are slightly different from the actual model the airtech claw rig compressor is another one that comes to mind the changes sometimes seem pointless and make you wonder why they bothered p quote the only original stickers are the front headlightpatterns on the 2 red 1x2 bricks the others have been destroyed  must have been the bad decaying sticker quality that breaks when youll remove it  so i printed them i didnt print the flag for only the alternate model needs it although its a neat idea the other stickers on mine have held up pretty well although i didnt try to remove them after i put them on the flag started to break after a year or so and just fell off its axle at one point i taped over it and its holding up well now although its a little frayed along one edge this is actually the earliest set ive seen that uses this crappy sticker material which is unfortunately very common today even other technic sets had good stickers for many years after that	negative
bernddasbrot on mar 10 2008 0556 pm said youve just motivated me to go on a senselesspreliminarydesignerrorshunt man this set is a disaster what were they thinking d p i just remembered one other fun aspect of this set the crane hook can be attached to the underside of the rear bumper to hold it in position while driving along but when things are like this and you try and wind up the cable the winch is strong enough to break the original provided lego rope it worked with my copy d so this set is capable of demolishing itself but still one of the best technicsets i have with all stickers intact im not so sure about that flag though must check on that	positive
blakbird on mar 10 2008 0935 pm said hey why do you only review sets which are red d i exactly thought that today as i made the pics for my signature xd at my school leaving examination i made a model in blender3d and explained to the board of examiners how to build a car and how to animate it it needed a color so i took red because all beautiful and fast cars are red my physics teacher contradicted 	neutral

reread your review today great pictures this is a fabulous model got this model a few months ago for just € 25 it is small and has great working parts i love the way the frontsuspension is made epic i only had the lightstickers replaced with transclear bricks btw the gear rack has been used in this years 8048 buggy	positive
i also happened to receive this set this weekend virtually misb the seals on the side of the box were loose however everything inside was untouched this little beast a joy to build and even more so to play with as indicated by eric on the technicopedia page its crammed with functions for a mediumsized set i think i love it even more than my son does	positive
i read blackbirds technopedia page on this truck the other week went onto ebay and picked up a misb copy for £25 gbp bargin great to get old sets unopened peeling the plastic off of the specialist parts was always cool love the front suspension	positive
that price is exceptional its less than what i paid for mine 9 years ago and is even less than the original price of the set note that the stickers in this set are the bad variety that will crack and peel over time if you want to preserve them the technic flag in particular you will need to tape over it	neutral
grepin on mar 24 2010 1237 am said  the only flaw i noticed was weak support of the rear drivetrain which was easily corrected with a few extra plates huh like where dont have that much problems with that rear train at least if i you dont trow the model down the stairs or something like that	neutral
junkstylegio on mar 23 2010 1117 pm said huh like where dont have that much problems with that rear train at least if i you dont trow the model down the stairs or something like that maybe its unusual but this section of the drive train didnt hold that well on my model this is how it looks now the parts made redundant were left in the built model thats why theres that useless 8tooth gear there p	neutral

a nice review well done y the set itself doesnt look quite interesting to me compared with some of the newer ones like 7647 or 7648 the way the driver fits into the cockpit looks not very clever and pretty uncomfortable as well xd	negative
thanx for the review i have one question do these aliens have moving arms as far as the set goes i think lego did a bad job on the alien ship i dont think any of the alien ships look good in mars mission the human fanction got a lot better this year and i would have bought this buggy if it came by its self	negative
sweet first pic review y i got this set for a birthday present last year and it is pretty fun overall the alien ship in this set is actually one of my favorites it just looks cool and the way you can fold it out is really clever the only negative for me is the cockpit of the mining unit not really because it isnt detailed but because mine is top heavy and keeps falling forward its kinda funny if you think about him driving along and then falling forwardbut not funny at all when youre playing 	positive

hi this is my forth oldschool technic set review since blakbird pointed out that all my technic reviews are red i chose a yellow dune blaster for today just kidding this set is red as it should be dont worry my next reviews will be yellow and black uhhh forshadowing   i will start with some facts 277 elements and released in 1994 thats enough 1 the box 2 the parts 3 building instructions and catalogues wow no folds no wear marks  simply wub was lesen coole kids  klick das super magazin fuer coole kids how obvious 4 building no differential i really love the way the 1x8 technic bricks on the sides will be positioned later fun fact the engine contains no 2ltechnic axle and finished a real quick build 5 spare parts for the alternate model the yellow technic handle should be from 8412 maybe a bonus feature from the seller 6 random shots 7 final thoughts this is my second 8829 and i also noticed that the engine turns very hard the alternate model is really sorry to all those of you who like it crappy i mean a nice idea but not with this wheels  anyway a really beautiful technicset reminiscing this word exists does it thanks for viewing the pictures i hope you enjoyed it please comment if you want to edited by bernddasbrot 21 march 2008  0209 pm	positive
that looks like a very nice set  in your opinion how does it compare to the current dune buggy toa of justice	positive
i dont own the 8296 but what i can see from the pictures i would say that 8296 is very similar to 8829 the only things that are different ist that 8296 is studless and features a steering wheel for the seat but 8829 has got bigger wheels  it also would have been nice if the wheels from 8296 could have the same tread	neutral

blakbird on mar 22 2008 0949 pm said one thing i noticed is that a bunch of your pictures are missing the beam that goes over the left hand wheel as a fender oh no i forgot to put it back i wanted to make a photo with this beam alone 8 blakbird said what kind of camera do you use the pictures have very good depth of field meaning that both the foreground and the background are in good focus this is usually hard to do without a very small aperture the camera belongs to my dad its a panasonic lumix dmcfz30eg blakbird said one of them works well mated with an 8 tooth on parallel axles and the other one doesnt the difference is only supposed to be longer teeth so it really should not matter but it does if your set works bad try switching the crown gear to one of the other variety worked for me wow youre right never thought of that thanks i made a scan  of those two gears you can notice the longer teeth first pic edited by bernddasbrot 23 march 2008  0303 pm	neutral
blakbird on mar 22 2008 0356 pm said imho 8829 is much better than 8296 first 8829 is a lot bigger i really like the huge rear balloon tires they both have rack and pinion steering and they both have trailing arm rear suspension with a v2 engine i think the body on 8829 is a little more well done for 8296 i think the alternate tractor model is much better for more comparisons see technicopedia eric wow 8 thanks for that cool link blakbird xd i agree that 8829s body is better i especially like 8829s rear spoiler and its angled side beams  toa of justice	positive
hello all apologize for digging out a such old post recently i got a bag of lego technic parts where there have been mixed three sets 8858 8829 and 8235 the resurrection of 8858 has been described by me in a separate post going back to the dune buggy – when i saw it for the first time back in 1994 i did not like it as i was always big fan of 8840 which i consider to the day the best looking buggy and set 8829 looked to me ugly so there were those all parts in the bag… then i though why not build it  and i started to do it when i finished i was very surprised how the final look of this set is really taking my words back unfortunately in the bag there were missing some parts and i could not rebuild the back spoiler so i made some changes to it and make it from spare parts that i have and it came out acceptable i also added some additional parts such as “fake” steering wheel “rally” logo antennas i have also reverse mounting of the rear tires – why lego did them like that i never know – as i think they look better this way set well the review has been already made by owner of this post so i will only add few things into it engine – v2 aired cooled is driven by 4 gears  from the single wheel no differential as in 8840 using two old school z14 tooth bevel  then by z24 tooth crown and z8 tooth type 1 actually the as in most old sets the pistons are moving very fast not as in current sets and smooths – i needed to extra clean all engine parts as there was a lot friction suspension – set has “engine bay” working using two old gray shock absorbers 65l – the movement is not big but works very nice better then in 8840 in my opinion steering – this is a bit odd as there is no direct connection to hog as in most old sets but first the gear rack is moved by z8 then two z14 tooth where reverse movement is taking place later connection of two old school z14 tooth bevel goes to hog details – this is the most that i like in this set specially how the use of axle pin connector perpendicular and 1x10 bricks with 3x3 cut corners and plate 1x5 toothed ends 2 studs with center axle hole are making the body shape – is just wonder tires – the balloon rear are pretty nice the front is a new version of those that were in 8840 what i do not like 1 missing of technic figure 8840 had it 2 no steering wheel in the original set 3 no differential – but having in mind that lego has introduce 2412 teeth would be difficult to build the transmission in such small space where the engine is i will shortly upload new pictures and post them here later on  over all – i think it is worth buying it as it is very payable  actually very payable and runs smoothly  the steering suspension – perfect thank you and regards	positive
pictures of my restored set 8829 i was almost 96 complete and for missing parts i add of my own the seat is black and not blue as one was missing in my 8858 the spoiler is different steering wheel added not connected to wheels and some additional items to make it look better this is how i change the tire orientation the new rear spoiler i still need to clean front rims edited by aow 26 november 2015  1232 pm	neutral

thanks for the review it looks beautiful my father was a backhoe driver so understandably i used to drool over this set in the catalogs i never did get it though as lego was so expensive in australia then i had around 2000 pieces and i thought i had loads d anyway last year i bought 8455 which i love it works great with a compressor i made too sweet i wish mine had a real cab though  do you have 8455 as well id love to see how they compare side by side it looks bigger than 8455 but i dont own any of the big old chuncky tires so i find it so hard to tell by the way i have been reading all of your reviews but i have been a bit busy of late so i havent had time to comment i hope you have more planned any chance of a supercar one	positive
another nice review the slow shutter speed pictures are great i think that was the only set with 8 distinct functions for a very long time and was only displaced by the 8455 backhoe in that respect the turntable on the back doesnt turn very well though as the weight is all distributed on one side the screw axle prevents it from popping off but there is still a lot of friction in it i dont have mine built anymore but it might be worth trying to put a weight brick or something on it quote do you have 8455 as well id love to see how they compare side by side it looks bigger than 8455 but i dont own any of the big old chuncky tires so i find it so hard to tell yeah its quite a bit bigger when everything is fully extended it becomes something like 26 long although the 8455 actually has morebetter functionality edited by cp5670 24 march 2008  0815 am	positive
thanks for your feedback i like both but i would say 8455 is far more than just a studless version with 10 pneumatic cylinders and 2 pneumatic pumps its a wonderful set for every pneumatic freak unfortunately i dont own the 8455  yet  sinner said i hope you have more planned any chance of a supercar one i foreshadowed a black review a few days ago guess which one xo xd	positive
a great review for a great set it even had the old technic tpieces and bevels which i actually prefer to their modern counterparts cp5670 on mar 24 2008 0814 am said the turntable on the back doesnt turn very well though as the weight is all distributed on one side the screw axle prevents it from popping off but there is still a lot of friction in it i got mine for £20 in a second hand shop it said complete but one of the screw knuts was missing xo so its practically impossible to keep the back arm on with only one  and theyre rather rare on bl too 	positive
bernddasbrot on mar 24 2008 0508 pm said there are 324 axle nuts on bricklink with an avg price of 089 but i wants it cheap sing and i would still call 324 quite rare and i also want to just tack it onto another order sad	negative
yeah i meant theyre rare  but i can imagine that a normal axle with the old half bushes will help sometimes these are really strong if you put 23 in a row edit i just tried it a normal 10l axle with 2 interlocking old half bushes type 1 on each end i chose those who only can be moved very hardly along an axle i slewed the bjst  back arm a few times tried the pneumatics parallel to it and it didnt loose edited by bernddasbrot 24 march 2008  0606 pm	neutral

bernddasbrot on mar 23 2008 0232 pm said hi this is my forth preoldschool review as promised a yellowset  my 8862 arrived today survived the washing machine coaster and actually was real fun to build the finished “boom  jib  scoop thing” bjst  xd thanks for viewing the pictures i hope you enjoyed it another great review and a wonderful set of pictures i like your nomenclature for the bjst acronyms always sound nicely scientific much better than digger no one would know you made it up until they found out what it means i also really like what i will call your kinetic photos they convey a sense of motion and show the range of the mechanism without the big file sizes of animations how long of a shutter speed did you use the secret to not getting too much friction in the turntable is using extra nuts and jamming them together you dont want to actually clamp the nuts tight across the turntable you want to jam two nuts tightly together at each end which prevents them from unwinding but still leave a little free play gap this way it will hold the assembly together but not prevent it from moving mine moves quite easily this same concept is used on the pen plotter or 8094 slewed i think thats a word how about slewn or slain or slewifacated i think rotated is best sweet eric	positive
wow thanks for putting up this thread that reminded me that i own that one too sweet and i loved it as a kid	positive
by the way dont forget to build the alternate model of 8862 it is a combine farm equipment which is just as good as 8274 i liked it so much that i bought two copies of this set so i could display both my favorite alternate model not counting universal sets is the 8480 submarine maybe it is time for a white set review skull white is pretty rare for your blue set i recommend you review 8462 there are only a couple of green sets and 8479 is the best and then of course 8458 is silver i think we all know what the best black set is and according to your photography you have lots of them but dont forget 8868 eric	positive
bernddasbrot on mar 25 2008 0346 am said 15 seconds wow thats a long exposure i would think you would get way too much light and overexpose the image the aperture must have been tiny quote i will review it too and post it in this topic cool i am also planning to write about the combine on technicopedia combine quote actually i took it from your site xd i thought that word sounded familiar quote unfortunately i dont own 8480 but i think 8824 is also a very good though small white set 8462 rocks as a blue set i just got it a few weeks ago lets see 8462 also is one of the last technic sets i would call oldschool 8479 okay too but 8458 is imho not 8868 and the totally mysteriously black set will follow you dont own 8480 that is unacceptable it is imperative that you put a mortgage on your house immediately to get it sweet yes 8824 is a good white set i also see from your room photos that you have the 8839 supply ship which has lots of white this is a really nice set 8462 is hard to call old school but at least it uses regular beams the air tanks are the best part of the set i wish lego had used them more often especially on the highly pneumatic sets the tank makes all the difference on 8459 you are right 8458 is certainly not old school but it is a great set with wonderful suspension it is of the same era as the super street sensation with all of the panels for body contouring 8868 is technic at its best there is nothing else like it especially with the compressor quote did you had something like this in mind if the toothed 10l axle rotates the axle nuts want to rotate too but they cant because of that 2x4 technic plate so theyll decide to move along the axle the 1x6 bricks on each end make sure that the axle wont move in or out thanks for your feedback while the assembly you have drawn would work as a linear actuator i would not recommend it the torsional stiffness and strength of an axle are proportional to the polar moment of inertia a section property most of the stiffness comes from the outside of the cross shaped axle but in the threaded axle you lose all the stiffness of the outer area because it is not continuous this means you only get stiffness and strength from the small core i think the threaded axle would bend and break very easily if subjected to much torque eric	neutral
quote 8462 rocks as a blue set i just got it a few weeks ago lets see 8462 also is one of the last technic sets i would call oldschool 8479 okay too but 8458 is imho not yeah the tow truck was the last set that still used mainly studded beams they made many changes to technic the following year with models becoming predominantly studless and making heavy use of the flexible axleshoses and decorative panels the technic logo and box art style was also changed a lot i really like the overall construction of that set the model is fairly lightweight but extremely sturdy it must be one of the strongest large sets theyve released quote did you had something like this in mind thats basically the idea as blakbird said though it wouldnt be very powerful and would put the axle under some stress the linear actuators theyre bringing out this year do the same thing and should work much better	positive
a great review i only have new sets so looking at old ones like this is great i would suggest multiple pictures blended together afterwards instead of the long exposure pictures bernddasbrot on mar 23 2008 1132 pm said now you can recognize the backhoes real shape only with a little violence it’s possible to lift the bonnet  through the pneumatic pump arent you supposed to fit the bonnet over the pump and then attach it to the main frame  front	positive

some time ago i sort of complained about the fact that there was not much technic represented in the eurobricks community this was the topic if someone is interested i am glad to see someone took that complaint serious and started reviewing technic sets on large scale to show us how fascinating the theme really is this review is once again an excellent one i really enjoyed reading it i must buy this set sometime soon because i always liked the threeway pneumatic system it came with and the overall look of the machine for many years it seemed out of reach much to expensive and hard to come by as a kid now as an adult there are many ways to acquire this wonderful set keep on reviewing y	positive

thanks for the review and for giving me directions p i think the design of these two cars looks to be better than in the other set the drivers are positioned lower compared to the windscreen and the design of the front on th red car is really nice im missing details of motors and cars this big could use a working steering mechanism	neutral
thanks for the review mate i may get this as well so i can get racer x axctually i see what tlcs done here splitting up the two more wellknown characters speed and racer x so you have to get both sets matn on mar 25 2008 0809 am said lego should have used this for their helmets you can put a protectingglassesdont know the name in front of it visor id have to agree with you with regards the helmet i wouldve preferred this especially for speed interestingly my pocket knife is the same as that one i didnt count its appearances though	neutral
speaking of pocket knives i just got speed racer and snake oiler at kmart and might mod the helmet so it actually looks like the cartoon the problem is  i dont want to shell out two bucks for a clear visor  by the way i know transclear visors are nonproduction but where did they come from a pickabrick if so what store well at least if i do go through getting the elusive clear visor its not as bad as the insane 25 red vader helmet this set is great i would have gotten this along with the one i purchased but i didnt have enough dough with me to get both	positive
crap now i want these sets great review	positive
as promised and with only a single day of delay is my review of the 2008 set 4994 creator fierce creatures this small set is the same size and price range as last years 4939 cool cars reviewed by prateek and dillthepill the box general info you get 193 pieces vs 206 for cool cars which is quite a lot but most of them are small there are a lot of hinges and some good slopes and wings the building instructions contains three models but no further ideas for inspiration primary model spider the first model is a big spider which shares some similarities to the secondary model of 4895 power in the design the legs each have 3 joints where the ones in the middle have stud joints to be moved sideways while the rest use hinges for all joints there are 8 of them and it does get a little tedious with all the repetitive building in this relatively small model i like the design of the face with a lot of eyes and a big and ugly mouth but the real gem is the xpattern on the opisthosoma made using doubleinverted slopes it is poseable and i think it looks more fierce when inverted secondary model snake the face of the snake is nicely detailed with a splitting tongue and a mouth than can move a little there is a problem with the construction it uses stacked hinges for some of the joints which are hard to pull apart without stressing the pieces tertiary model fly im not completely sure what this insect is i will say its a fly although the tail and head are too pointy this is a neat little thing conclusion primary model 8 it is a good design but lacks some sturdiness in the legs they fall off a little too easily secondary models 6 they are pretty good when you look at the bricks that are available but they dont wow you in any way and they suffer from the same issues as the primary model regarding sturdiness alternate models 3 it is hard to come up with alternate models with so many small pieces and plates that are only 1 stud wide the colors might make you want to build a spyrius space ship playability 8 the models have many movable joints and you can put quite a scare into your minifigs when their town gets attacked by these creatures unless some en forces are there to protect them price 6 creator sets are known for their great price to bricks ratio but this set doesnt quite measure up to sets like cool cars pieces 7 the pieces arent great by themselves but who doesnt need a fist full of hinges slopes and basic plates in standard colors i dont think this is a musthave set like the big rig was last year the pieces are great and it has a nice primary model but the set lacks a bit when it comes to the usual strong creator qualities like alternate models and price brickshelf gallery edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0630 pm indexed	positive
a fine review of a fine set thanks lasse d y	positive
enchanted island 6278 pictorial review original price 66 pieces 412 figures 7 this 1994 set marked the beginning of a new era for lego pirates  it became a theme more centralised around playability and not so much grand ol ships 6278 enchanted island was the flagship set of the islanders subtheme heavily based around polynesian and native american concepts in fact tlc was successfully sued by a number of tribes for using bastardised maori names such as kahuka it was released as a legend set in 2001 but due to poor sales was discontinued again the largest of the islander sets enchanted island is a portion of an island with a river running through the left hand side features some sturdy buildings built into a treelike structure on a rocky outcrop whilst the left hand side features a tower built out of wooden posts and a large tribal statue the box cover shows all the details it does however differ from the instructions finished product in that it has been more aesthetically arranged  bushes etc have been moved to fill in gaps and to not obscure other things the sides of the box show nothing particularly special although in one scene it depicts the islander canoe chasing the pirate boat with the treasure just one way to play with the set the back of the box however is superb featuring a large number of alternative models a toothy statue a pirate tree think wolfpack with an islander base kahukas throne a firebreathing statue and a soupedup boat for the pirates these and many more can be easily made because of the large diversity of pieces the set has a huge number of minifigures for its size the third highest number in the pirate range the ses and the bsb being first and second respectively  a whopping 7 5 islanders including the alltoocommon king kahuka the elusive islander babe and 3 standard warriors  this set alone will never leave you short of enemies 2 pirates ironhook in his standard attire with a scurvy dog at his side attack the island although they are only moderately armed  2 cutlasses and a pistol between them a musket wouldve been nice the islanders on the other hand have 4 shields a bow and quiver and 6 spears not to mention the big pokey thing with horns on top weapon idol staff a monkey parrot and crocodile provide the obvious creature features with a fair amount of gold to finish off in the instructions the goblet does not have the lid although it does on the box its a nice touch anyway  adding a little more diversity to the monotonous treasure stashes the pirates boat is a nice 2 sail vessel with oars for when the wind stops and a treasure map the sails are similar to those in lagoon lockup but with an extra front sail its an awesome little boat better for raids than a rowing boat but not too big that it cant sail up rivers it can comfortably fit 2 men and at a squeeze 5 the sails are expensive if you buy them seperately normally this wont be a problem but they can cost aroun 5 each the islanders boat is a canoe with a sail and an outrigger to stabilise it the sail is beautifully done with 2 spars taughtening it there is a clip for the rower to leave his weapon when at se and the mast can turn to get as much wind as possible its quite a topheavy boat but it doesnt look hideous and without the mastsail it looks great 3 islanders can fit in it and more if they sit on the outrigger the markings on the canoe are stickers but they look fine and are probably more robust than markings for their job furthermore theyre waterproof sing kahukas throne can be carried by 2 loyal subjects or strapped to his pet crocodile the clips on the side can be used to rest his weaponry or hold spears for battle the throne looks nice although im not too sure about the blue against the red  id have prefered white as it would clash less an overview of the island it is built in 2 halves  left then right and then joined together loosley so it can be seperated for transporting around the back to the left and right there are large open spaces that are great for battles  this set isnt so much about a large solid build but creating a village  smaller structures linked by bridges and the back to the far left is a platform built onto the rock with access from the river via a ladder theres the standard islander drum with the lovely zebraskin part where did they get that ive never understood the white flag  i was under the impression it was used for surrender further along the rocky bank there are some hinged palm leaves that swing upwards to reveal the treasure its an ok hiding place not the best place to hide it right where the pirates sail past but it feels fabulous it fits right in above it on the rocky bank is the main structure it looks very disjointed when you build it bricks all over the place but once its done it looks nice and rural with leaves everywhere and the balcony where kahuka is standing you get a nice roof made from 2 large palm leaves tilting down around the back theres a slight shelter a table for picnics and a ladder to access the upstairs i was rather annoyed that it is so open but the set is designed from just one perspective to the left is the bridge to the other building a nice one piece bridge made of the softer plastic used for muskets and the post1991 cutlasses it looks good but be warned it tilts when you pull a pin sending the pirates flying this contraption is a good idea but it is very stiff and so doesnt swing even when burdened by a minifigure  youll want to modify this bit if you get it the other building looks like it is made out of posts and beams they are all red brown would have been better but it would have added too many colours to the range just like the use of black for trees in some forestmen sets there are 3 clips for spare weapons only 2 of these will ever be used when all the islanders are armed but it gives the pirates scope once theyve been disarmedtheres another nice palm tree roof on top 2 ladders give accesstheres a total of 4 in this set  worth getting eh although theyre 5p on bricklink for a kabob theyre like gold at the top theres another hidey hole the palm leaves lift up on hinges to show the treasure or hiding islander it can be seen from behind but this set is designed from one perspective only nice cattlehorns tooalongside the slats you can see in the floor  5 years later and it wouldve been a solid plate the big statue is one of the main selling point of this set alongside the tilting bridge  theyre the action features shown in every catalogue at the time but it is not really special just original the statue fits in with the theme perfectly  kahukas mask his shield and this statue all depict the same deity which is a nice collectible idea the back is rather plain except the angled 1x1 bricks  a good touch im not sure why theres a black brick in the back of the head but this is easily remedied it could even be done with a brick from this same set just swapping the two over aside from the head turning the back can open to store sacred objects or in my opinion prisoners hence the gaps for breathing either way its a lovely piece of architecture and deservedly a flagship element of the set theres your standard cooking pot floating around although a 1x1 yellow stud as human flesh remember minifigs are yellow no matter what the licensed themes say is a superb finish this set is a stunning set for both kids and afols who are just getting back into legopirates  it is a great army builder and due to its release as a legend is extremely cheap on ebay  you should be able to pick one up for £18 or £15 if youre lucky for that you get a lifetimes supply of islanders 4 ladders some wall panels 2 baseplates one raised and both with rivers and printed vegetation around the edge a ton of weapons a fair quantity of standard bricks but most of all a heap of vegetation this is an easy to buy set with normally around 5 on ebay at any time and is well worth it for the parts the play and the nostalgia it can be easily modified when used in conjunction with any other outpost a much larger fortress can be made especially if more rope bridges are used if you pick 2 of this fine set off ebay itll still be less than the original price a huge complex can be constructed giving you an instantaneous village for around £35 other information lugnet rating

excellent review y getting a better chance to look at this set actually makes me interested in it i was in my dark ages throughout the islander days though i have built up a small force of them 10 from ebay buys but no actual sets if this is really as reasonable as you say there i may just have to pick one up soon oddly i do own the baseplates to this set having also picked them up in a lot on ebay so i might be able to recreate it manually but i think id rather pick one up whole it looks like a great mix of parts and makes a decent looking display piece thanks again for the fine review y	positive

everytime i saw this at a toy store i always cried to my parents for one but never got it i got the smaller islander sets but the more i see this now i dont want it i could buy it but naahh i am hoping lego does an updated version of the islanders with this new pirates line one can hope right xd	neutral
hello eldiano although the review is fine and you have memories related to that set please have in mind that the post you were replying to was in fact some 7 years old this is what we call bumping of old topics and it shouldnt be done you might want to take a look at our faq posting tips and etiquette edited by phred 06 april 2015  0347 am by phred read next post please	neutral
eldiano thank you for posting about your desire to have this set i do own the set and i do recommend it to others if they somehow find a used one the bricks are kind of sparse but the the bricks it does come with are really nice i love the figs and the base plates are by far my favorite made by tlg captain braunsfeld i suggest that you read through the link that covers topic bumping more clearly i apologize for the confusion eldiano i do believe that i have found a way to remove the confusion of posting in old topics soon among the pirate staff and to the other members of eb please stay tuned sinner on 18 july 2010  0316 am said 3 lego reviews dont date thus if you have something relevant to say then feel free to post in a topic but if its more than a few months old please make sure its good and if its been a few years it better be really good for example if you liked the review or set and want to say so you probably shouldnt if youve got an answer to a question such as does anyone have pictures of the alternate model then by all means post what you shouldnt do is ask questions to the original poster heshe may not even visit eb any more	positive
i realized that building the chess set from the new pirates theme they are two grey heads that reminded me of the king kahuna throne which goes to say that i am hoping they bring back new sets i just wish they were bigger i would love to build the old ones but i would side more towards the newer model if they ever released them	negative

sorry to bump such an old thread but i´ve just discovered this set is on sale at amazonde  for a mere 25 euros i am tempted not because i like the set or the models but because of the parts as most of you might know i´m especially into exoforce so would you recommend to get this set just for the parts are they a good choice to combine with efsets would anyone of you be interested in obtaining the fleshieparts of the minifigs from me as i totally don´t need those	neutral
i picked up this set a few weeks ago along with the smaller sets that come with the mach 5 and racer xs car and i was pleasantly surprised the commentators stand is nothing to write home about but the assortment of figs is great numerous new face prints in flesh i believe and in spite of the large amount of stickers the three cars are each unique and very welldesigned my only gripe about them is that cannonball taylors car the black and yellow one was a missed opportunity as in the movie its yellow and purple i know tlc is dropping purple for the future and had a bunch of problems with it in the past but it would have made for a great looking car imo	positive

hi ive promised a lot lately ill review 8868 8880 space police ii blacktron ii and i will its just the time that is blocking me and my university and the fact that i just picked up 8460 in original box for only eur 3650 sweet the other reviews will follow  please bear with me and this set review is also a gift to this nice fellow who gave me the title thats what im talking about 1 useless information with high numbers this set contains 841 parts and was released in 1995 in the technic  tech build  advanced sub theme the bricklink price guide displays for “used” a qty avg price of 12585 and for “new” a qty avg price of 21282 i got it for 5698 still can’t believe it  this set was rereleased two times 8431 in 2002 and 8438 in 2003 2 the box front back open the box is higher than other technic boxes why i don’t know 8460 doesn’t have any real large parts whatever inlay i wonder why tlg doesn’t make inlays anymore… they’re noisy and brake easily but are great for pre sorting 3 building instructions i will quote myself from the 8862 review quote wow these instructions are used im not used to this after all this sets with unread instruction booklets triplewow ‘nuff said this is the “first” page fortunately peeron offers scans the last step for the alternate model and a few nice photos showing how the pneumatic pump will be erm pumped yeah random page i forgot the overall thoughts to the instructions these are technic instructions as we’re used to them part count easy to understand okay the string part at the end was too much for me and the color distinction is okay too 100 pages long and if i can trust my eyes the pneumatics page can be fold out i don’t have this page but i assume it 4 the parts 5 building an easy and fun build okay this could take some time my longest building review up to date the front steering the rear steering the axle pin between the rear steering is for the axle which rotates the crane the two worm screws in the front are for the outriggers they’re not linked one for each side the small wheel in the back is for the rotation adjusting front and rear steering outriggers are finished you can notice a 8 tooth gear that will rotate the technic turntable a steering wheel has been added could be the same stickers like the alternate 8880 used to have the steering can be operated with both actinic lights  no we’re far from finished i’ve got a lot of parts left at this point wow a 4x4 corner plate pneumatics and a winch if you can’t recognize it on the photo the technic beams are the erm wrongother side up the 1x6 technic beams on the left side are normal the axle that will extend the crane 7 gear racks 1x4 the 1x6 technic plate will keep the two pneumatic cylinders straight sad 8 huh did you blink you missed a special part the whole rotatable thing will be attached to the technic turntable using two long technic pins the pin on the right side should be in the middle of the three “turntable holes” on the right side it’s the first hole asymmetric why because we’ll add a cute cab 6 functionality you can find the features in comparison to other technic cranes here technopedia of course i made one sentence out of it please don’t find any mistakes p “two axle rack and pinion steering pneumatic luffing and gear driven telescoping via crank for the boom which can slew 360° on turntable driven via gear crank driven hoist and gear driven outriggers at four corners which snap over center” 7 random shots comparison to 8854 uuuh… once again a depth of field i tried to make it look authoritarian like 8858 but i failed somehow 8460 looks cute 8 comparison to 8421 mobile crane  crane truck i feel that a question concerning this will be asked so i deal with it right now first of all i don’t own 8421 yet i know a technic freak really should own it anyway 8421 has more than twice as much parts as 8460 is motorized features a v6engine and a very neat mechanism to extend the craneboom twice using a braided string with end studs try to find out how of course 8421 features far more than 8460 imho 8421 should have been a copy of 8460 a set so successful that it has been rereleased two times but the designers overshoot the mark 8421 is a breathtaking monster compared to it 8460 looks cute  not pale 9 final thoughts i got it on ebay in kind of good condition for about 50 dollars i know that it has been worth the money in any point of view wub i didn’t use the word “oldschool” for now i’ll change that 8460 belongs to the favored few of oldschool technic sets thanks for reading and viewing the pictures i hope you enjoyed it please comment if you want to	positive

a great review thank you i do not know these old sets like this one but it is very cool to see how they were made i have an unopened 8421 maybe i should do a small review of that when i get to build it btw boxes are expensive so at a given price point its a choise between more bricks or nicer boxes i have no doubt what most people would chose front edited by front 06 april 2008  1021 pm	positive

simonwillems on apr 7 2008 1201 am said somehow i competely missed your review when you first made it i saw your pics on brickshelf and wondered about the review you have managed to review my all time favourite technic set yeah somehow i wonderd why only vbbn thanks responded but i learned from yodas sig patience  for a jedi it is time to eat as well  eat eat  hot  good food  d simonwillems said it was the first large technic set i was given by my parents when it first came out in 1995 i played for hours with this set making minifig seats in it it was so huge there was room for four minifigs to sit next to eachother in front i made various applications for it a bungeejump system with a large rubber band and lots of containers to be lifted the first changes i made included the inverting of the wheels and the disabling of one of the flashlightsteering wheels because they obstructed eachother by the way the nob for your winch is yellow instead of black i know this set by heart so watch out p  i always liked those nobs and people think you cant play  moc with technic at all xd about the nob erm yeah i only found 3 black ones in the box and so i took the yellow one that i got as an extra with 8829 simonwillems said the alternate model was great fun too the pump is cleverly hidden and the crane folds up great between the cab and the loading platform you could easily mod it with a pneumatic claw on the crane a motor to turn it and a compressor the only flaw was the loading platform which had no floor only some axles another reason for the 8460 as favorite set its got a real alternate model not just a different erm crane simonwillems said thanks so much for reviving my memorie concerning this great set youre welcome i consider this as my job  cp5670 said but i keep all of them there was actually a time when the boxes used to be even stronger i have an old 8859 set and the outer box is made of a hard styrofoam material although they probably stopped using that for environmental reasons thats the spirit i got more than hundred boxes and my 8848 box came with styrofoam too	positive
great review while i admit i wasnt into technic at the time this came out i was a mere child give me a break d i can see now why it was featured so much from the booklets to display stands at toy stores and at my local lego center when it was still around this thing was everywhere with your review i can now truly appreciate all the details of the set i got to admit i can see the appeal now that comparison shot you took is amazing i love not only just how it included the little details such as the stabilizers but also looks incredibly fun to play around with great set and an even greater review	positive
thanks guys  sinner i hope you refered to 8285 so my answer will match 8285 is interesting main model american styled truck alternate model european styled truck i dont think tlg produced many european styled truck edit i just found a wonderful mocalternate on brickshelf 8436 by industrialdesigner if i got him right he designed a few offical technic sets for tlg  all promises promises promises hm and again its ebay thats blocking me i want to foreshadow my next review although itll take some time to make it i know you know but please act inconspicuous until youll can act very astonished edited by bernddasbrot 09 april 2008  0325 pm	neutral

ok i think its a nobrainer that this is a musthave for pretty much anyone who likes lego its cheap and a great minifigs  parts pack ill be getting at least 1 of these here is what i like about it 1 great minifigs with nice torsos sweet faces and awesome hair gotta ask em where they get it done  2 golden katana 3 chicken leg yum 4 nice campfire and this is what i dont like about it 1 dark bley knife seriously they could have at least made it silver like the sword if not chrome 2 rehashed tent 3 spiders with 6 legs i actually dont really care about the tent and the multilegged creatures those go straight into the sorting boxes perhaps i might use the tent someday for a steampunk moc of some kind or a stopmotion film or maybe some kind of contest anyway whats up with that thing that holds the katana the sword and the saber its in the airplane set too is it perhaps one of the treasures of the new movie or is it something indy takes with him everywhere in this film 44however nice pics nice review thanks dude edited by oky wan kenobi 16 april 2008  0938 am	positive

merci beaucoup for the great review alex  where did you get the sets  that set is called river chase this is a great set  i love the amphibious vehicle with all the darj green part  i agree with you that the the dark green croc is fantastic  im also happy to have a dark bley zodiac and a new marion torso that tree hut is a fun feature where the playability doesnt screw the design  i really love the commies  its fun how lego reuses those fleshie heads and i really dont mind at all so its evil for evil since one of the commie has the zazi face i also love the ptrol cans  ingenious  i still have rants on that set  why oh why another similar indy  arghhh i cant stand it   why oh why the same marion head  cant wait to have those sets 	positive
good	positive
a very fine review of a really great set thanks alex this set has everything a croc very nice mfs a neat tree trap a cool zodiac and a marvelous and very detailed amphibious car in a beautiful color scheme the only thing i´m not colpletely sure is the design of that jerrycan thanks for the right word and the interesting link kingboy  although the use of the revolver´s pretty clever indeed and fits well too it´s still clearly well a revolver very unusual and interesting for an official tlc design	positive
this set looks good about the jerry cans i like how they give me more pistols this may be the only indy set i get from this batch ill just have to deal with the fleshie heads exchange them for yellow like stealth hunter said this will be good for army building silent help	positive

wow in the protype pics i kept thinking this thing looked lame a boat on treads with saw blades but this is definetly something i want now lots of great plant and animal parts and looks like plenty of wheels with those treads its just begging to be made into a propor tank	positive
great review thanks a lot for all the pics i agree that this is probably the nicest set of the indy 4 wave so much dark green and i love all the plant pieces its been ages since weve had enough pieces in a regular release to build nice forests so its great to see 11 of the dark green leaves in one set and all the vines the design of the cutter looks very solid and brick built as well giant ants are great looking too	positive
a great detailed review for an excellent set i love the jungle cutter vehicle itself and all the dark green its great to have the trees and cave entrance you can never have enough extras the figs are nice too two russian soldiers the coollooking general i think his name is dovchenko or something and the repeatedbutstillnice indy with rpg thanks again looks like ill be picking this up along with jungle duel by the way i think this set is called jungle cutter	positive

ahhhhh now this swamp vehicle looks great to me when i first heard lego were making it i was worried that it would be a poor version however im pleased to see that its not even though im not a great fan of those treads the trees dont really add anything to the set which is a shame still the parts are welcome at least the entrance is good though it could do with being bigger but i guess we can moc that i really like the commie general he looks like a real bad megablocks	positive
great review again alex  same question in case you didnt se it in my reply to the other set where did you get those new sets  i really love that set  its called jungle cutter the trees are really cool and make a great adition to it imo that temple entrance or monument is really cool  those bionicle parts do make fantastic vegetation  i totally forgot about that green frog  thats cool  those are so cute  5 more ants is great  the vehicle look really sharp ah ah ah 2 more commies yeay  that officer is really freaky actually  could have been a high rank under pol pots regime in the s21 yeay looks more asian than russian imo now its time for my grips  same bloody rant about indy   i havent read the instructions before but once again there are so many parts in crap colours that need to be changed look at all the crap red and yellow in there  i will need to look for those parts before buying the set like i always do  mod while building on  i am really soimpressed with that indy line  i sincerely hope it will have a long and healthy life 	positive

this is the 3rd review that i had read its very tempting to fly over and get those sets from there because i may need to wait for some months before it arrived it seemed we will have a new small little creature to add into the ranks these red ants is cute and of course looks nasty too haha i love those trees foilage and plants very very much it can be used for my moc and is good for any green project related expansion i love it about the vehicle i find it abit wierd it seemed too big in the setup hehe but still i love this set mainly i will get it for the green parts	positive
ah the wonderful dragon knight or was it dragon masters sets i personally preferred the black knights but these guys still had some awesome sets thanks for this review this looks like a neat little set although those modern stairs look a little out of place that tree design is indeed a neat one i remember having that in one dark forestmen set i got the interior sure is roomy may i suggest for future review you photograph the set on a cleared table that way you wont get distracted by the clutter in the background and can focus on the main part of the image the set peace	neutral
this is probably one of my favourite sets andor one of the sets which i wish i ownedthe 90s was probably my favourite castle era tobad i was to young to buy this set when it came out man i wish i had one of those dragons they were one of the best type i reckon although all the dragons are good thanks for the reveiw edited by hollisbrick 16 april 2008  0741 am	positive
yay go dragon masters i have to agree with iamded i do like the black knights sets better for their design  betrayal  however the dragon knights are just awesome cause they have dragons this is a nice set with some awesome minifigs and a nice overall design i wish i had it go masters	positive

this was the last castle set i got before my dark age really liked it although the big rock parts looked really bad  i am kind of used to them now unfortunately i lost the little wand and i never understood who is good and who is bad does the wizard own the dragon well they dont seem to be enemies but isnt the dragon supposed to be evil	positive

i own this set and i think its a great for a smaller fortress building there is a good selection of mini figs the burps do detract somewhat from the set but they do make it feel as if its in a large cave the cloth flags that are included are really nice and mine have lasted a long time	positive
the 8291 dirt bike comes from a long line of technic bikes and i think its the best ever it looks great and its fun to ride around in the house i hoped to find a figure the right size for it but none of mine would fit unlike a lot of technic models it looks good from all angles considering the size of the model it has a complicated way of connecting the engine to the wheel the rear shocks are just the right stiffness and they have a good amount of travel i thought these shocks were new i need to get out more functions shocks two front one stiffer one in the rear drivetrain 2 piston engine linked to the rear wheel via gears and a chainlink steering yes it does stand retractable for the price size and subject what else could be added 1010 parts considering that it has three shocks and a 40 chainlinks its a great set for parts some hard to use large parts are included but they are not overused the usage of the green does limit part usage somewhat though and ill be struggling to find a use for those wheels for anything other than a motorbike 810 price at 3999 aud for 248 parts it isnt the best value set the us price is 2500 which is somewhat better it does have some more complicated parts however 710 looks lego seems to be moving away from the seethough look for technic sets and this is a good example of it im not a big fan of fairings but i think they work great in this set as a fuel tank 810 fudge this set was great for me as i have never had a technic bike however for those that want this for just parts or have other bikes it could be a hard sell the alternate model a chopper is a complete rebuild which i didnt make and its great that lego have been including these most of the time lately 710 overall recommended 810	positive
i think the green motocross bike looks great i like the use of fairings on this bike the only thing i really dont like about the technics bikes in general is the clumsy design of the chaindrive it sticks way to much out to the side if they made a really big bike model it would be more in place with this chain drive im not sure if it wouldnt be possible to design a shaft drive to the rear wheel ala bmw style but the green kawasaki look great with the front and rear suspension i have the street bike 8420 a somewhat larger and more complicated set and will probably add the motocross bike to my collection soon it would be great if lego could make a line of bikes like they do the ferrari line front	positive
a very good review thanks sinner that´s really a pretty cool model very detailed with useful parts too hmm perhaps that one´s gonna get the first technic set i´ll buy beside that 4481 hailfire droid um thank you sinner	positive
i have just finished building this set i was a bit disappointed with the amount of bricks when they were out on my table but the final model is really nice and totally makes up for that i like the small details like on the handles and fuel tank and the only real negative thing i can say is that the cog seems a bit oversized in the rear i dont know if the designer frequents this forum but im sure he will be happy about how much you like it  it took quite some timeprototypes to get to this design sorry about the size of the picture  it isnt mine	positive
how did i manage to miss this review i must have overlooked it somehow thanks for making this one sinner its always nice to see reviews of technic sets im not so sure whether i like this set i am not that much into motorbikes but lego did a good job on this one it looks a lot like an upgraded version of one of the first bikes lego made namely the 8838 shock cycle i also believe the back gearwheel is somewhat oversized it looks better with the smaller one you attached it is good to see that lego is back to making the technic sets the way they were except for the green that is 	neutral

looks like an interesting set i didnt realize the motor controlled two functions through a transmission switch thats always good to see ill probably pass it up though until the price falls a bit the overall design is a bit too studless for my liking i think the 8275 bulldozer has a much better balance of studded and studless pieces and the wheels somehow look too small to me i also have something of a backlog at the moment i still need to pick up that bulldozer along with the 8421 mobile crane on ebay	neutral
wow its a smarty set with drive shafts we are everybody and technical junk the specs and stuff kind of lose me but the walrus looks really cute in the cherry picker i imagine hes saving a kitten but really this is a great review and has a wealth of detail and knowlege for techniphiles thanks for providing such a cool resource for eb i really did enjoy delving in to the world of technic for a few moments the walrus rides it  oh hes so smart	neutral
thanks for reading my review guys vbbn on apr 20 2008 1058 pm said great review i never have been interested in this set i am saving my money for a grey technic set or thatt technic ferrari set if you mean 8145 ferrari 599 gtb then i recomend it but i think it is overpriced mine was almost half price and about to fall in the sorting bin holodoc on apr 21 2008 0423 am said i´m not that much into technic building because i´m lacking the inspiration to build something different with all those technic elements so i´ll pass on this one and stay to classic bricks i have enough now to be able to build something and i really should soon or im going to find it hard to justify to my wife buying the other 2008 sets imperialscouts on apr 21 2008 1258 pm said thanks for the review i think i am going to get this set for its many technic pieces i could really use those for a rig im going to build i didnt know you liked technic i look forward to seeing this rig cp5670 on apr 22 2008 0235 am said the overall design is a bit too studless for my liking i think the 8275 bulldozer has a much better balance of studded and studless pieces and the wheels somehow look too small to me i also have something of a backlog at the moment i still need to pick up that bulldozer along with the 8421 mobile crane on ebay id buy the bulldozer or mobile crane over this set as i own both already i bought this i tend to agree with the wheels but i think it doesnt detract from the model hinckley on apr 23 2008 0814 am said wow its a smarty set with drive shafts we are everybody and technical junk the specs and stuff kind of lose me but the walrus looks really cute in the cherry picker i imagine hes saving a kitten thanks for your foray into technic land i tried to fit him in the cab as well but he kept falling over	neutral

sveltecorps on apr 30 2008 1044 pm said and what everyones been waiting for the skullies  three of em and a conquistador skellie  very cute note the backs of the crystal head have a plumesized hole  or maybe thats just where they injected the blue brainplastic spooky i love these skulls i wasnt sold from the initial pics but they have a very creepy smile and the head shape is just weird with the large eyes its kind of homer simpsonesque they reminded me more of the movie coneheads but i think your description is more accurate looking forward to the rest of the review	positive
the figs look great the natives and the skeleton conquistador are my favorite figures in the set the set itself is very good the interior sort of reminds me of an older style lego set for some reason it could be just me but it has a classic feel this will a great set to add to my list great review so far anyway i only saw the back of the box edited by general zen 01 may 2008  0217 am	positive
tinypiesrus on may 1 2008 1218 pm said i was really hoping that the conquistador helmet would end up being silver in the final set but i suppose its good to know that the helmet is being porduced again anyway and is the armour the skellie is wearing pearl gold hi tinypiesrus  i love that helmet too if only we had plumes again soon hopefully the armour is pearl silver not gold	neutral
sveltecorps on may 1 2008 0243 pm said hi tinypiesrus  i love that helmet too if only we had plumes again soon hopefully the armour is pearl silver not gold oh sorry my mistake so is it pearl silver as opposed to metallic silver that sure is an odd little vehicle the engine looks nice enough and the rubber treads are always good to have but other than that it really just looks thrown together thanks again svelte edited by tinypiesrus 01 may 2008  0258 am	negative
brilliant review and great pics thanks hmmmmm i would actually like one of these now where before i was unsure	neutral
thanks for the great review sveltecorps ive been wanting to see this set in detail since it debuted at the conventions i have to say that on the one hand i agree that the minifigures the crystal skulls and the colors are great i even like the waterfall but on the other i kind of think that the set itself is a disappointment it looks like they tried to accommodate design and playability needs but really didnt come through on either so as you pointed out the mid section doesnt really fit in with the other parts and the trap sequence doesnt really flow either but perhaps your right and all will be answered in the film i was surprised at just how empty the temple looked in the photo taken from above they really should have gone the extra mile and made the temple look more like a temple and not worry so much about the action features eh but so it goes but i too am a sucker for tombs and temples so i wont be able to pass it up archaeology on	negative
outstanding review your efforts have totally convinced me to get this set no matter what it really looks very great and funz reading that review i will be looking forward to the new addition of those minifigs just love the layout of this temple a great addition indeed	positive

i know that alex54 had already reviewed this set beforehand but i wanted to give my 2 cents it is really more like 150 on this set i bought from toys r us on friday guess what the price had not been increased by a dollar like all other sets  this is my first review of a set ever dont be too mean 1 box it captures the potential i dont know how the scene plays out for now  action of the scene nicely and is very pleasing good job tlc  on the back it shows some of the play features of the set and a net little comic indiana jones seems to be surprisingly calm considering that he is about to be captured under a net and attacked by a snake the thing he fears most 1a comic not much to say on this 1b screw up at the top of the box both russian guards have the same grining face in the set one has the generic bad guy face from 7620 2 contents the box opens up to reveal a quartet of bags an uncrumpled manual yay and a sticker sheet boo 2a dss yoda said every for of rambling imaginable about this accursed item i have nothing to say meh 3 minifigs the only thing that has not really been discussed about the figs that you get in this set is that marion has a slightly new torso 4 parts of interest when i opened up the baggies these were the components that grabbed my attention a dark green alligator a net piece that i know has appeared in sets before hand  i needed it for a moc i am working on some raft part that is probably very old a ladder with two pairs of hindges and a dark brown version of this part 4 build amphibious vehicle this i one of the more enjoyable builds of the new line but that is just my opinion you start of with some thing very simple by the end of the next page it starts to bulk up more detail beginning to look like a car 4a build rear attachment bulk it up and add taillights done slap it on to the main vehicle 4b build front attachment i am running out of things to say bulk it up add some detail add a gun and headlights and attach to the rest to get the completed vehicle add stickers i honestly think that the amphibious vehicle looks much better with the stickers than without 5 build boat this build goes by rather quickly and adds to the playability of the final set base apply clamps add more to engine build more detail and a gun base finished boat plus stickers i love how lego slips in the product number into their stickers 6 build tree fort this is the weakest part of the whole set but i find my self liking it more and more for some odd and inexplicable reason that tan 6x6 will most likely see use in a pirate themed vinigete soon not mine  install netlauncher you spend the next two pages building this and putting it on a tree branch that is an ugly mix of brown dark brown and frown our commie friend seems to like coffee a lot second branch 3rd a wee bit to much on the coffee there dont you think final step the only redeeming value of this section is how well the net launcher works fantastically the rest is just utter fail 7 spare parts very little in terms of what is left over finished set all in all this set is a fine build and an excellent parts pack for dark green components i recommend this set strongly despite its few weaknesses	positive
great review thanks as i thought amazon did send out my preordered sets not until yesterday evening so i should receive them hopefully on monday or tuesday cant wait for them btw i wonder whats up with all these sticker leftovers in the indy setsthis hasnt been the case in any other set with stickers right edited by metalandi 03 may 2008  0156 pm	neutral
i brought this set a few days ago and agree with everything you say i would have never noticed that the boat sticker is the set number unless you pointed it out glad to see that one set of fuel can stickers was extra i spent ages looking for a place to put them cool review btw	neutral
nice review although you need to use the macro settingaka the flower setting for better pics are you using a digital camera you really need macro the idea is turn it on and hold down on the take picture button halfway until the pic focuses then press it down all the way to take the pic im glad this one also comes with the new uzi i wanted an extra	neutral

very good for a first review i bought this set and jungle duel at target the other day i was going to wait and buy them when i go to downtown disney this summer but how could i pass up saving four bucks that i can spend on storeexclusives  and i have to say i absolutely love them the amphibious vehicle dont they call it a duck in the movie is definitely my favorite lego vehicle ive ever built everything about it is wonderful the size the colour scheme and its accurate to the one in the movie and irina spalkos hair is to die for on a side note i dont get why they made marions arms white in the set the shirt underneath her vest in the movie is obviously blue i switched the arms out for light blue ones and it looks a lot better and it makes marions eyes look great ryan	positive
an extremely thorough review  you definitely do this set justice looks like a fairly interesting set and that comes from someone who isnt particularly a fan of lego indiana jones tom	positive
what a fantastic set im overwelmed with feelings of nostalgia by seeing this review the playability factor of this set is as high as it can be thanks for making and sharing this awesome review 	neutral
thanks for this review you have reviewed my most favourite town set of all times i am so happy to own this one i actually is a story to go along with it in the summer of 1998 i went on holiday with my parents to the country of luxembourg in the city of wiltz we encountered a small toystore which still had this set for sale 9 years after the release i did not had the sufficient amount of money to buy the set and had to leave it at the store i was practically in tears four years later we passed through luxembourg and i remembered the city and the store we made a detour and stopped by the same store every other old set was sold the only one remaining was this one i bought it immediately and treasured it ever since i use the baseplates a lot in my cities they serve well as roads with parking spaces next to them this was the first set i owned which had the huge 6x24 plates in them i remember my surprise when seeing plates of such enourmous lenght i recently made an entire racetrack together with this set and to promote myself i will place a link here	positive
metalandi thanks for this wonderful lovely review i enjoyed myself very much when i am looking through at the lovely pictures i must admit this is what i called a real classic race prix i miss those cute sweet little race cars which is able to contain a minifig furthermore this set offers 4 race cars and 13 minifigures in addition if town collectors remember the car number tiles are printed instead of using stickers this is the other set i owned which holds the similarity above 6381 motor speedway overall great review simonwillems on may 9 2008 0220 am said i recently made an entire racetrack together with this set and to promote myself i will place a link here i saw your entire racetrack it looks real exciting and i love your layout real nice edited by whitefang 15 may 2008  0956 am	neutral

ahhhh back in the days when shell was the racing fuel of choice before that octan company came to town bought off the old shell execs and ran them out of town on a rail but i digress i always liked the look of the set but at the time could not work out where i would be able to fit it into my town	neutral

i can remember when i saw this set in lego catalogues looking at it dreamin to have it like so many other sets and this one is still a dream i really like the design of this set it looks really complete with some nice details there are no lost place the strairs withe the foot bridge add a lot to it imo looking at the pics ive got a question  is the rescue rig trailer one piece or is it brick build	positive

hello all i dont believe there has been a review of this set yet so i wanted to take this opportunity up for review today is 8160 cruncher block and racer x as part of batbrick and iamded reviews here is the box i have to say i love the art on it its very colourful and makes the truck look a lot less crap than it does on the box plus you have to love the missile launching action bit right am i right why are you all staring at me and here is the back pretty generic but shows some nice details and so forth oh dear in turning around the box have i killed myself and iamded okey dokey up first is the best part of the entire set the minifigs racer x is wonderful though coming with a boring bruce wayne face but it is cruncher block his lady driver taejo that really shine look at those awesome suits the cool faces taejo has a ripped shirt now up is the first building part of the set with me and iamded looking rather slick in xs car while im not a big fan of yellow it is very nice and slopes in an underused colour is better than no slopes at all front view the new windshields are fantastic while a very cool car it is rather silly of tlc to give us the exact same one we got in the smaller set i didnt get the smaller set with this car so im still happy but it is a bad marketing move sorry iamded i know its your birthday butvroom now for the second part of the build and my favourite the front of the truck annoyingly enough this part opens up to shoot a pointless rubber projectile to do this you open the roof a nice detail btw and pull back the mechanism here thus blowing the front part open and launching itwell not far really the wheels and covers are pretty cool and the front is nicely designed the red looks good and the rear vision mirrors are a great touch and now for the most disappointing part  step three the trailer note  clicky joint piece not part of set just used to hold it up thats right almost the entire thing is open even the filled in side has holes id certainly be cared to be back there one bumpy hill and back you go i didnt put the lame computer stickers on and the control area is pretty lame in general not to mention taejo who is depicted on the boxart as standing at the desk would most likely just be sucked out the back at those speeds there are some pluses too though like the ridiculously awesome minifig paintings ill be using for wayne manor also note the control on crunchers desk that when turned turns the gun at the bottom its an alright feature here is an example ive shot iamded on his birthday what its a love ray havent you seen the care bears and though im not a massive fan of stickers this is just too cool the little aquarium is very simple but very clever using a printed piece between two clear windows to create the illusion of a tank it looks much better in real life trust me and here is a side view to better explain now to connect the two is a good thing i like the way a simple technic piece assumes the job oh and behold my hand the completed truck which while a mixed bag still doesnt look too bad i guess now the completed set which despite its unbelievable large flaws still looks cool warning the kickass iamded and batbrick figures do not come with this set more pics here httpwwwbrickshelycgii3147324 all in all minifigs 55  racer x is beautiful cruncher block and the driver too and taejo has a ripped shirt damn design 25  pretty poor considering the best part is available in a cheaper set and only the front part of the truck looks cool but still not truly awful build 35  despite having a bad trailer it was a fun build and sometimes you need something that doesnt take ages to make price 25  overpriced easily but rogue shadow is worse fun 35  the mere concept of such an open truck kept me playing with this baby for hours total 1525 not as bad as it would seem overall im really glad i bought it as the minifigs are fantastic and the paintings and fish tank are cool its fun stupid and downright ridiculous but while not a great set by any means certainly isnt as bad in the brick as it looks in photos until next time batbrick away edited by batbrick 13 june 2008  1220 pm	negative
awesome review batbrick i dont see any appeal at all really in this set but thats okay as i want to stick to castle anyway the car is the best part imo which you can get in a different set with another cool car and for a cheaper price but the main downfall to this set is the fact that the trucks trailer is half blown up and the survivors are magically staying inside and not being sucked right out of there as you have mentioned i would have thought tlc would at least included some sort of cover that you could take on and off easily kind of like the modular buildings having said all that though the front of the truck does look incredibly cool and those minifigs are sweet too bad they all have flesh tone printed on them so while this may not be my set of choice i can see the appeal well really i cant but its just my opinion im sure there are plenty others who would love to scoop this set up peace	negative
thanks for that fine review batbrick the most interesting part of the set for me are the neat mfs the trailer looks really pretty skeletal however it´s a nice little play set and´ll fit its purpose i guess	neutral
nice review good pictures thanks i think i may get a couple of the smaller sets as i think these will become collectors sets in years too come not sure this range will be that popular love the minifigs though	neutral
thanks for the review my wife wanted me to buy this for the fishtank and i came close untimately this set didnt offer many good part to me so i bought the smaller set with the same car the trailer is just too insubstantial	negative

thanks for the great review it seems like the most awesome part of the set is the sticker sheet which is a reversal of the usual situation	positive

i really like this set my favorite parts are the minifigs and xs car vrooom	positive
i enjoyed the review some cool fleshie heads and parts but it does seem a bit lamer even than i imagined from the box the airy truck is rather slyly disguised on the box art i would like to get it if it is ever on sale 50 off would be nice  speed racer lego doesnt seem to be selling too well in local shops here	neutral

nice review brickbitz i actually think this kit is really very nice for the size true you only get three figures but it seems thats a norm in most batman sets besides everything else is great the tumbler looks like an amazing build  they really nailed this tank of a ride and the ice cream truck plus this set does seem to have some neat pieces in it trans green popsicles and lime hubcaps anyone i think this far beats the rest of the batman lineup this year which seems quite disapointing overall edited by grevious 16 may 2008  0812 pm	positive

thanks for that interesting review brickbitz the alien fighter looks pretty nice nothing special but streamlined and fast nevertheless that transforming feature´s a nice addition for sure and these new flicker missile with its launch apparatus hmm i hope i won´t spend quite some time in search of that little rocket piece however there´s still something i miss with these alien crafts i don´t know i like some more organic looking design and they even come in some nice and different shapes but still perhaps a real space fighter just needs a solid cockpit cool windscreens and controls to satisfy my odd likings that exo suit looks really good and i wonder why it´s a little underrepresented on the box art the jet packspace scooter´s a really good idea and the only thing i hate´re those darned studless technic beams it could look so much better with a studded version of these parts but of course that´s only due to my personal preferences	positive

hi yall guess what happened today when walked into my toys r us in fullerton ca just to buy a simple tiny turbo racer what do i see all the agents sets sitting on the shelf ready for the taking i didnt have too much money with me so i just got 2 of 8631 mission 1 jetpack pursuit its a really cool little set so i thought id review this puppy for you i shall proceed in the order of the instructions so lets get started the minifigs lets begin with the minifigs saw fist and agent chase they are really cool some of the coolest minifigs i have seen in a while i took off saw fists wig  chainsaw so you can see his head and cybernetic arm better here is a back view of saw fist and  surprise agent chase has a double sided head one side with his cool mission face with sunglasses and headset and one with his casual bruce wayne type face note though that it is not really the bruce wayne face his wig btw is mutts hairpiece in black very neat poor saw fist seems to be forced to always drag his chainsaw around for it is way too long to just hang down from his shoulder like a normal arm the snowmobile next up we have the snowmobile a sleek little vehicle with only minor design flaws the container with the jewel is attached to the vehicle by a single stud so it doesnt fall off but is easy to pick up in the pic below you can see the only two tiny design flaws thanks to the exhaust pipes the laser cannon or whatever its supposed to be cant be lowered any further than this also the corners of that slopeish piece that the handle bar rests on are sticking out a little at the sides other than that its pretty well done the jetpack finally there is the jetpack imo a name like autogyropack or something would make more sense but whatever although a little bulky the jetpack is very well designed the rotor can be tilted back and at the lower back of the jetpack there is hook with which you can grab the container with the jewel from the snowmobile what i like best about the jetpack is that although it is attached to the minifig in kinda the same way as that of the riddler this one doesnt rotate around so the agent is being held in place steadily see ya later chainsawcyborgdude stickers this set comes with a surprisingly large sticker sheet the reason is that half of it are extra stickers there are two large agents logos and one inferno logo  perfect for agents mocs there are also a star and a small round sticker portraying the number of the mission the star seems to be part of some kind of game where you collect the stars from all sets on an agents id that you get from the mission 5 set i dont know though if you get any gain from this except for becoming a fullstatus lego agent below you can find the list of parts from this set click here for a better quality pic thats pretty much it i hope you liked this review and will run straight to your next toy store to get one or more of this set this was my very first set review so any questions comments or requests any more pics you want me to take would you like me to exchange the chainsaw with something else or do you want me to try the agents new hairpiece out on another fig if so just tell me see ya edited by oky wan kenobi 25 june 2009  0821 pm	positive
thats a great review for your first one i think the jet pack if far to bulky it could do with some minimising but that’s life i assume that you can’t fit a standard hand in the chainsaw arms are the hole would be to large but would you be so good as to confirm this for me overall i quite like the jet ski and the ability to lower the arms to much doesn’t both me how much was it just so i can get an idea of the price finally thanks for posting this review so quickly	neutral
thanks for the great review oky wan the two vehicles look quite nice for a small set and the minifigs look great the two sided head is nice although it wouldve been nice if it was a new head rather than the standard frowning face the cyborg looks good nice and cartoony i like the printing on his back the belt on the hips should be useful not to mention the robotic hand i assume that anything that fits into a 1x1x1 cylinder can fit in it i hope so thanks again oky any chance you can get any more sets	positive
thanks for the review im looking forward to some of the new parts and ideas in this line the figures look great the actual sets themselves dont really appeal though	neutral
huhm  i like the idea of the agentid  but offcourse all they want with that is that you buy all six sets  but it can be a good idea for children they wouldnt think of hey they get all money only because i have a little card with stars or something well not to rant i think its good also can you make that name yourself maybe set 5 comes with a extra stickersheed with all letters that would be nice agent rupee a very nice review oky wan kenobi rupee	neutral
thanks guys i really tried to make it a good first review now to answer your questions the robot arm can fit ef robot claws and anything that a minifig can hold in his hand or that would fit into a 1x1x1 cylinder so normal minifig hands are too small to fit tlg is using the robot claw idea for the main villain of the agents line do you still want me to try it out and take pics the price was 1099 usd at the tru i bought it at i bet itss be a dollar less on sh and im sorry but i probably wont get any more sets any time soon i have to save my money for all the other good set that are to come but if i would get another set it would just be the one with the helicopter and the allsilver car if anyone gets this set can heshe please review it thanks any other questions i can answer for you guys edited by oky wan kenobi 18 may 2008  0859 am	neutral
nice first review oky wan  i´d say this is better than we first thought the minifigs looks cool and the overall look is ok and the excaustpipe is a new peace also i think agents on copmike	positive

is there any chance u could post pics of the comic and the box i love legos box art and instruction art	neutral
i love the way the bad guy has a special attachment on the jewel case just to allow the agent to grab it with his hook its like the two of them sat down beforehand and drew up the plans for the vehicle together cyborg ok and then ill make my getaway in the special snowmobile and you can follow me agent and ill scoop up the jewel and return it to foil your plan cyborg perfect see you tuesday dr s	positive
good review thanks oky wan hmm although i really like the villain not just the new arm i think the color is very villanous as all bondvillains with class have minions in uniforms its even possible to fill out their numbers with exoforce grunts of the same color im not that hot for the agent himself his uniform nah it doesnt even look like clothes just give the man a suit or some nifty leather i think ill try to grab some sets from the agents line just for the new parts to begin with mocs may follow who knows when they are available in stores here in sweden havent seen them yet though indiana jones just got here so there might be some further waiting for me now i want to see reviews of the other sets 	negative
thanks for a very good review agent line seems better all the time looking forward in seeing review on mission 2 gold chase and new pictures of the jet really soon	neutral

thanks for the review this set is wonderful u love the two dark green crocodiles and awesome minifigs especially break jaw that bike is awesome and the base like all agents sets comes with great pieces like the barbed wire orange anything leafy pieces and brown log pieces thanks for the review ill definitely get this one batbrick away	positive
wow great review for a really great looking set the pieces like the minifigs and crocs are very nice but that map is reeaally cool for an aztecmayainca fan like me i will definately buy this set when it is available in england grevious on may 21 2008 1004 pm said btw anyone else notice the possibly accidental reference to alpha team agent charge is back it looks yeah i thought that then i thought nah he looks different but i remember that the characters in alpha team did change their looks a lot throughout the years being spies and that edited by shoc 26 may 2008  1037 am	positive

great little set nice to have a small building instead of all vehicles plant pieces and dark green crocs always welcome good parts selection for the price thanks for the review cant wait till we can get our hands on these	positive
nice set im definately gonna pick it up when i see it i like the design of the base and it comes with lots of usefull an neat pieces	positive
great looking set i’m determined to get all the agent sets this summer comments swamp towerthe barbed wire is cool but it seems like it’s only for looks bikecool looking but doesn’t seem to have any controls cybercrocswow haven’t seen any of these pieces for a while and in dark green awesome agent chargesweet head definitely cool break jawhe looks like the result of some animal testing on humans gone horribly wrong i hope they come out near me soon	positive
wow thanks for the great review sirnadroj the overall set is what attracted me in the first place that elevated hut and swampy setting just sucked me right in it all looks really nice to me a definite buy that agents head would make a great indy for those opposed to fleshies and that monobrow i mean villain guy looks very er well the monobrow is unique thought i noticed the suit looks a bit skin tight in the crotchal area dont look at me like that you saw it too anyway the helmets the best part about the villain great for warhammer 40000 orks peace	positive
very useful pieces that new agent head i think its new could be used for a gordon freeman minifigure and break jaws head for otis the security guard when you take his donuts away from him	positive
i always joked that our house would have a moat around it with mechanical alligators now i can build the house in lego thanks sirnadroj for the review and pictures this is definitely my favorite agents set	positive
great review and a good confirmation of exactly what i suspected this is a parts line for me much like exoforce before it this will be the theme i pick up when im out of other things or its on sale plus those dark green alligators bring tears of joy to an old pirate alice on may 22 2008 1243 am said i always joked that our house would have a moat around it with mechanical alligators you were joking what about the monkeys and the miniature golf course dont ruin my dreams 	positive

why do all of the reviews that we have for agents sets have the agents getting hurt is this a new trend plus unibrow man doesnt have a unibrow his eyebrows are really close together and bushy	neutral
agentrick57 on may 23 2008 0917 am said why do all of the reviews that we have for agents sets have the agents getting hurt is this a new trend no its an old trend and its because villains are cooler actually it could be longsimmering resentment towards the nothighlyregarded alpha team dino attack sets bubbling forth see dr luckys hilarious post here for an example of what i mean im sure the new agents will learn to fight back soon	negative
does anyone know if the turbo car chase is out yet	neutral
ive copied another thing because i dont know how i must do a review and i cant do long reviews set ref 7884 name the buggy the escape of mr freeze number of minifigs 2 number of pieces 76 price 1395€ front of the box back of the box the comic very close whats in the box without the set the set with the box the time wow this is a funny set but its a little expensive and a little to small but i like some pieces like the fire and the mr freeze gun and the best of all here it comes no stickers thats one of the greatest things but i understand why lego has made this set some people want batman lego and they are most of the time expensive and the mr freeze set is also expensive but this set not if you want more pics you msut ask for exaple for the minifigs or the mr freeze and the blaster ask it and this is my first review and sorry for the great and blurry pics the final verdict 7510 figures 810 playability 610 build 710 pieces 7510	positive
as others have said this really is a set for those that didnt buy the batcave thus i want it the cars are pretty horrid though thanks for the review theriddler	neutral
wowie im glad you like it maby il do the tumbler also but soon the batcycle and the scuba also come	neutral
pretty nice review for a first time theriddler next time though if your camera has it use the macro function little flower icon and perhaps a tripod that should get rid of any blur and provide you with better pictures apart from that a good little review keep up the good work	neutral
thanks for the reveiw the figs are bloody great but those cars are a bit well ill put it blantly retarded although they shall be good after some modding and whats with that grapple hook does it even have a rope so i guess batman will hokk it to mr freeze so his ride looks more ugle anyway can you pleese take some pics of the figs	neutral
thank you the riddler  for this highly informative review despite the fact that i still consider it to be one of the weakest sets in all batman line i guess that now i may even get more than one of these for the same reasons as batbrick  good day gentlemen 	neutral
thanks the penguin and more pics on monday	neutral
thanks for the review this set was poorly design when i first heard of it i think it was like a car with a much better design than this one i think i will get it for the minifigs	negative
the pics as promised extra part	neutral
thanks for the extra pics i dont think you could have gone into much more detail than that nice pics of the joker van too will you do a review of that one batbrick away	positive
in actuality i think that this may be my favorite batman set of all time i know i know  its a small set with crappy tiny vehicles so it probably sucks for the fan who likes to display sets but look at the mocing side and you see this set has a ton of potential new batman fig well mainly the torso but it looks nice sleek and armored a definite plus whether youre a mocist or batfan mr freeze because nobody bought the batcave when they should haveand by nobody i mean me plus i love that head cheapest way to amass the lightning piece the other sets that have it are lolhueg well not really but i dont have 50 to toss around on a little skeleton tower and its a great piece two little blue gems i may be alone on this but those are my favorite parts the gems and thats my favorite color for them 3 3 3 several other useful parts including a o piece in black some lightmedium blue bits from mr freezes kart the oddly placed grappling hook and some cheap wheels now i dont know about you guys but this is as close to a batman battlepack as were going to get lol  im buying at least three maybe more once i get my summer job  oh and the fact that the us price is only 10 helps a little but this year you guys cant complain  you got practically every set first especially the new castle tt trexxen	positive
thanks for the review i dont know if i would get this set though the cars are not that great and the price is a little too high	negative
i got this yesterday and built it this morning apart from the figs it is very crappy mr freezes buggy is ok but the bat buggy is easily the worst vehicle ive seen for years colours are all over the place the grappling hook feels cheaply made the inclusion of those odd pearl silver parts which have been in the exoforce sets seem especially random here the terrible bionicle flame piece its the first lego vehicle ive built where ive immediately had the urge to disassemble it and pretend i never bought it really i only got it for mr freeze so i shouldnt complain but still its a real step backwards the comparable catwoman dragster set was heaps better the penguin sub is sweet though thanks for the review anyway	negative
coming in at around 50 us turbo car chase is one of the bigger of the new agents sets a big box with a helicopter car and gate in it seems like a winner but how good is it really and is it worth the cash lets start with the minifigs this set comes with a standard inferno henchman spy clops and agent chase the henchman is you basic lego criminal type with a gun and a jumpsuit nothing real groundbreaking here spy clops on the other hand is very cool for technically half of a minifig his head has a neat electronic goggle print and the rest of him is a torso mounted onto a set of six legs made from exoforce robot arms the whole thing is really well done and neat as hell agent chase turbo car chase  seems to have a standard agent body and a doubleprinted face with one side a sunglasses and headset print the other face is a determined agent look the set also includes a laptop with doctor inferno wallpaper the laptop is a new piece and works like the lego books that are in a lot of harry potter sets molding on the keyboard is really well done and the thing can be held by a minifig along either corner but not in the middle and not while closed the gate in the set is nothing revolutionary by itself and i sort of get the feeling that it was included to drive up the piece count and the set price point that being said there are some things to like here for instance the gate has four wheels of barbed wire attached to it the barbed wire is new and makes me want to start building some world war i trench mocs the rest of the gate is fairly big and it has a handy ramp attached so that vehicles can roll through it easily the main feature of the gate is a sound brick its much better then lego sound and light units of the past when the gate is opened it depresses a button and an alert klaxon blares that sounds every bit like a prisonbeak in progress the triggering action works surprisingly well and its pretty much for this feature alone that im not going to immediately break the gate back down and add it to my parts bin the designers did make an effort to create more then just a fence though a nice control panel connected to a big spotlight crowns the piece and a pair of cameras watch the opening its really hard to mess up a lego helicopter and this set is no exception the inferno chopper is a nicely proportioned and well built machine it looks properly menacing and has the uniform orange and black of other inferno property its armed with a set of four technic pegs cleverly used as guns on outriding mounts as well as a pair of the newerstyle flickfire missiles i personally dont care for flickfiring missiles but these look decent enough and seem to stay put so i really cant complain about them along the fuselage are a pair of intake pieces that ive never seen before and im guessing are new theyre pretty well designed and will come in handy for mocing down the road the action feature of the aircraft is the wench system this is very different then other lego wenches in that you build the entire mechanism and housing you can then use it to raise spy clops up and down from the bottom of the chopper using the rotor now this also keeps you from sitting there and just giving the rotor repeated spins to simulate flight im not too thrilled with that but there are a hundred other lego helicopters out there with fully rotating rotors so i guess i can let it by just this once as youd suspect the bottom of the cockpit is completely open which makes this a vehicle pretty much solely for spy clops sorry henchman but there is plenty of room beneath the body to attach a plate with some seats on it to accommodate another pilot without drastically altering the design or even removing existing pieces the turbo car is a slick little honey of a lego car and the silver pieces that make up the body work contribute a lot to that fact the front license plate appears to be an exofore code brick but it also hides the activation lever for the passenger ejector seat the seat works about as well as the spruce goose which is to say not well at all but here its the thought that counts the interior of the car is really well done theres even a radar screen for keeping track of pesky helicopters but the bondlike features dont end there a lever in the compartment raises pair of guns in the hood and a knob on the rear deploys a quad rocket system with more flickfire missiles this is a car that wont be stopped easily the rear has two cones sticking out id like to think theyre smoke nozzles or oilslick sprayers allinall this is a really good set the car is pure lego vehicle love and looks fantastic the silver pieces are very nice and its a shame lego doesnt use metallic colors in system sets more often there are however a lot of sticker for this set and i know how much that bugs a lot of people i personally like how much detail the stickers add to these sets and dont mind them so much the set also comes with an agents id card for chase which you can put little star stickers on from other sets as you get them its printed on a real nice piece of sturdy plastiboard and would be cooler if you could put your own picture and name on it instead of pretending to be chase sold by themselves the car and chopper would be musthaves all tossed together with the gate sort of makes the set a little less then the sum of its parts and with 498 parts most of them small thats not so hot its only slightly overpriced in my opinion but if you do shell out the money you wont regret it im very comfortable recommending this set to anyone close to perfect but the price and some minor flaws bring it back just a little id say 433 but out of 5 is close enough	positive
looks cool one of the best in this line cant wait for review	positive
yay cant wait for your review i plan to get this and the giant truck the brick rat on may 23 2008 0731 pm said 2this set contains the best lego sound brick ever its just begging to be incorporated into my arkham asylum what is a sound brick	neutral
mr mandalorian on may 24 2008 1158 am said what is a sound brick ditto maybe its like the exoforce lightup brick only with sound instead of light that would kick innapropriate word deleted	neutral
wow thanks deino for this great review i cant wait to get this myself but right now i gotta save for the cw sets the car is with no doubt one of the most mind blowing things tlg has come up with and we can only hope that there will be more models made out of almost only metalic colors the spider cyborg while not as innovative as some of the other cyborgs is a very nice fig and his head will be very usefull for splinter cell mocs and those intake pieces are only relatively new btw they are in almost all of the current 10 racers sets any chance of you taking a pic of a lineup of all the silver parts in this set edited by oky wan kenobi 24 may 2008  1132 pm	positive
great review deino man that car is just so beautiful and the helicopter is nice too unfortunately this seems pretty pricy and i hardly think ill be getting it any time soon what with my limited budget and all still its great to see how well agents is shaping up	positive
thanks for the review deino i love going back through the old agents thread just to see how wrong we were about these awesome sets i actually really like the gate those portcullis pieces people may know i always find nice uses for and i really really really want that awesome sound brick the figs are a bit disappointing in numbers but agent chase is very cool generic henchman are great and spy clops is one of my favourite minifigs ever the helicopter is wonderful too i love that it is customised for spy clops to winch him down the colours as usual for these sets are fantastic the dark blue orange and chrome silver the car is the best though i love all the functions how does the ejector seat work though batbrick away	positive
wow thanks for the great review deino this set is really a must have for me the sound brick seems great the helicopter looks very nice and the car is superb all of the james bond features are really cool though im very interested in how the ejector seat works or doesnt work the car itself is very sleek and full of beautiful silver and the inclusion of the new rims and windshield mean that i wont have to buy many speed racer sets as for the minifigs they all look great especially spyclops though it looks rather easy for him to fall off of his spider legs can you confirm this a great review of a great set thanks deinonychus	positive
deinonychus on may 23 2008 0912 pm said the rear has two cones sticking out id like to think theyre smoke nozzles or oilslick sprayers according to page 14 of my brickmaster magazine the left cone is for smoke screen and the right cone is for oil slick	neutral
thanks deinonychus for another great review i must say i do look forward to people uploading reviews of new sets it really helps me decide if i want it or not if its a good set imo then it adds to the excitement of picking up one myself this i must say is one of those sets the only concern for me like alot of others is the price i will just have to wait and see and continue to look at these photos deinonychus has provided for us so much for thinking the agent line was going to be weak i wonder if the exoforce style code brick number plate is a hint from tlc as to what will replace exoforce at the end of this year jb	positive
thanks for your great review it looks very nice indeed the gate have very interesting mechanism the car looks very slick and cool it looks like those typical kind of james bond car this review gives me very good insights	positive
great review deinonychus i really like it can someone record the sound os the sound brickmaybe on youtube i really want to hear it this sets are really cool deino can you post a picture of the agent card it comes with	positive
great review and fantastic pics deinonychus and a big thank you to whoever pointed out that you could use the sound brick for arkham asylum my addled brain didnt make the connection the car is just beautiful and with a good use for the most expensive part of the gate this is on my wish list for sure just have to see how much cash is left over after buying the new death star in a month or two agents has to be the biggest surprise from lego for ages without any pics it sounded soso but theyve done a brilliant job with it love those metallic coloured pieces	positive
great w im totaly gonna buy this set	positive
hello all eurobricks members i will present to you a very short review on the recent castle battlepacks this time i will be reviewing skeleton battlepack and i hope everyone of you do enjoy viewing it this was a request that put up by hollisbrick in the castle thread initally i thought it was a very simple set to do a review however for the love of castle i decided to whip this up for every castle fan out there this is an image of how the skeleton battlepacks look like i have bought 12 last packs of these in total so far but none of the crown battlepacks yet there were snapped much faster that i imagined do pardon me for the poor lightning today is a bad weather its hard to get natural light the skeleton gang for a single battlepack like this with an attractive reasonable price you obtained a series of 5 skeleton minifigs with tons and tons of useful castle accessories to me its a very very great buy and its a must to stock up for my army building some addons however i was not very satisfied with my skeleton armies standards therefore i decided to make some slight modifications with some additional castle accessories that is stocked in my castle warehouse after the makeover ok this is what i called a real skeleton army this is mainly my opnion and it have to be aligned with my standards i felt this improved battlepack gives a punch to the exisitng battlepack the two soliders on the right is able to align with the rest of my castle chess sets armies while the one on the left it gives me a great archer back up with the quiver and helmet attached to him the ones on the center especially the armored guard which equipped with the black nose cone helmet is my fave it is able to illustrate the elite among the rest of the guards with its armor and helmet which was featured in my castle deep forest expansion moc promotion on in addition the one which was hastly done with a modify mace it looks rather simple in time to come i will change it and gives a better equipment and look these are the remains i can use the axe for my dwarf in my dwarf mine defender in that set there is no weapon for my dwarf and i have to get it from other sets the rest of the accessories makes a very good stock up for future upgrading overall 910 this is not a playset it is mainly bought for its abilty to mass recurit any armies and is a main love for all castle army builders such as me this set mainly have no major faults and i love it so much although i have done some slight modifciations but this set is a must for me to buy more and more meanwhile i will need to wait for the next shipment hope everyone have enjoying viewing this simple review of mine edited by whitefang 25 may 2008  1252 pm	positive
dragonator on may 25 2008 0821 pm said thanks for the review whitefang i love these sets and i wish they were available in nz so far it seems they may never come here but i can sit and hope i like the look of them after your makeover a real skeleton army there did you say youve bought 12 thts lots of skelies are you planning a big moc or something no problem i had bought it last month i thought it was so simple to do a review for this was looking through the thread then i realised there is a request for it it was an unexpected shipment that send to singapore it came in very limited quantity most of the battlepacks were snapped within a day or two when it arrived well i am thinking of building something big in the future its just a plan that i have not decided yet for me i always love to see the beauty of a big army with different battalions forming a kingdom thats why i always buy many many sets that have figures that attracts me and for this battlepack it served a very good purpose for it	neutral
thanks for the review it wasnt really a request but more of an imply to do it anyway great review cant wait til these come to aus probably when the rest of the castle comes out in september though	positive
thanks for the review i wanted to see what was in this set looks good is it sold in stores edited by mammymarf 25 may 2008  0338 pm	positive

no offence make this 799 can too expensive to be coming with only a few figures 20 earns you the same amount of figs plus a catapult barricade two horses and a jousting divider	negative
sdpirate on may 26 2008 1040 am said no offence make this 799 can too expensive to be coming with only a few figures 20 earns you the same amount of figs plus a catapult barricade two horses and a jousting divider are you refering to these following sets both these sets adds up to 1800 cad and the skeleton pack have the same price of 1800 cad prices quoted from sh i understand that 7009 and 7090 offers more pieces horses and same amount of minifigs compared to a typical battlepack imo i feel that all 3 sets are all army building sets 7009 offer small catapult 3 minifigs a skeleton white horse 7090 offer a joust divider weapon rack good accessories 2 minifigs a horse with barding and a skeleton black horse these sets have different purpose for me buying multiples of 7009 is to build its catapult white skeleton calvaries while 7090 is to build on crown calvaries and black skeleton calvaries however battlepacks have a different agenda it offered some castle accessories that is not available commonly for a castle army builder like myself castle accessories are always in demand the black robe silver armor silver shortaxe are not very common castle accessories it can be used as a good stock up too i am not saying this battlepack is an one way solution to solve everything thats why different sets are released to target on different purposes	neutral
whitefang although i realize that the battle packs are great specifically for building armies and castle accessories which is why its such a shame that i wont be able to buy these things  while sdpirates sets are more for a catapult calvary whatever the fact to the matter is with the battle pack you get 5 minifigs with lots of accessories while with the sets that sdpirate showed us you get 5 minifigs with an okay amount of accessories 3 horses including two skeleton ones a ballista a weapons rack and a jousting barricade you cannot say that the battle pack contains the same amount of stuff that the other two sets have and therefore should be priced the same it just seems that lego is ripping off canadian army builders to me if the battle pack contained a small catapult or wall so that it contained about the same amount of stuff that the other sets had it would be fair it seems stupid that you will only get minifigs from one set while you can get about the same amount of minifigs plus a bunch of other stuff from two other equally priced sets that’s why to me these battle packs are a rip off because of what they contain imho the battle packs seem to be only worth about 10 dollars	neutral
thanks for the review whitefang your additions look great i like your mace much better than the use of a small technic cog your looks much sturdier and that helmet looks really great on skellie soldiers i never thought to use that before very cool indeed peace	positive

sorry to be going a little off topic here but personally i have just bought 40 crowny battle packs for the only reason that i am running out of space to store the left over blocks about 500 of my crownies came from sets mentioned above on sale which would have been cheaper than the battle packs thanks for the review whitefang but i dont think i will be buy any skeleton battle packs that army is large enough	neutral
for those of you who buy so many of this and the other battle pack with crownies what do you do with all of them is this simply to create a largescale army or do you plan to build large castle scenes with all the figs id love to see some pictures on the share your castle army thread	neutral

hi gang as you all know indiana jones iv has just debuted and tlg has released a set depicting the incan temple 7627 from the films climax but lego beat harrison ford george lucas steven spielberg and company to the punch by nine whole years with johnny thunders adventures in the amazon ancient ruins the vitals year of release 1999 parts count 453 msrp 8000 the set included eight figures from left two skeletons dr lightning gail storm gabarros achu johnny thunder and señor palomar on the far right is my new sigfig el conde voltio villar construction begins with dr lightning and his jeep its a sturdy adventurersstyle vehicle with fatter tires at the rear for better traction next is gabarros and his unusual boat the hull is from bellevilleparadisa sets where it is usually pink or white tlg ought to have put it in the pirate theme as it is a nice intermediate size in this set it is a small steamship the temple is built on modular 8x8 green bricks which fit into square holes in the baseplate this is the treasure room this square has a nasty doublespear trap careful this is the top section of the temple crowned by achu the mummified incan more modular sections these are from the front of the temple site across the river from the main building el conde you are too beautiful a woman to be wandering alone in the jungle miss storm please allow me to accompany you gail storm im with johnny and i have a cutlass el conde ill be on my way heres the finished temple with all parts in place now for the traps hmm a giant ruby to bring home to the king ¡uf that was embarassing miss storm saw me fall and now ive fallen again i had better rest here before something worse happens ¡chispas thats it im leaving this place why me why the verdict this is a fine set a set whose bare partsprice ratio does not accurately reflect the intricacy of its design nor the rarity of its parts i had to buy replacements for some of them and let me tell you they are pricey that green baseplate 14 the little dark gray saucepan near the fire not available on bricklink at any price the brown boat hull vhtf with this set parts quality trumps parts quantity and the minifigures are wonderful theres not a dud in the bunch with the possible exception of the very common dr lightning and even he is not bad when you factor in the coherence of the color scheme and the brilliant traps it is obvious that 5986 is a classic 1010 edited by whitefang 27 november 2008  0533 am this review is added to the index	positive

great review for a great set man i loved the adventurers although the new indy sets are good they will never match up to johnny thunder most of all no stickers great review	positive

ive always wanted this set ever since it came out in 99 i have never seen it close up unless you count driving over it in lego racers 2 so thanks for the pictures and the great review voltio on may 26 2008 0443 am said el conde you are too beautiful a woman to be wandering alone in the jungle miss storm please allow me to accompany you gail storm im with johnny and i have a cutlass el conde ill be on my way hehe	positive
a real classic thanks for that nice and funny review voltio a well designed set very playable with a lot of nifty traps a very good use of that raised baseplate and really nice crafts the mf characters´re excellent too and although the color scheme´s great and original especially with all these neat printed pieces it´s perhaps the only part of that set that looks a little out of date today nevertheless the set´s plain charming and shows clearly that tlc don´t need licenses to do some distinct adventurer sets	positive
thanks for reviewing this rare set since it came out in 1999 i have only seen this set in a toystore one single time one single copy as well it was in the summer of 1999 in belgium arlon in a store called maxi toys belgiums tru i think they had the three biggest junglesets for sale there these ancient ruins the set with the beautiful black boat and the zeppelin being into adventurers at that time i had never seen the entire jungle theme not even in a leaflet or catalog and surprised as i was i bought all three sets that was one happy dutch boy in belgium surprisingly the two smallest sets made it in very small quantities to my local stores in holland except for the pontoon plane and small raft which was my very first shop at home order the spiders secret i bought off bl which makes me the proud owner of the entire jungle serie back to the set this was the first time in a long history of collecting lego that i had a deformed piece an 2x8 red plate was twisted i twisted it back and it still serves its purpose i loved the whole steamidea in this jungle serie the two boats both including the one in this set had nice steamengines and a very cool mechanic yours has the wrong hathair btw to come along with them the skeleton falling down on the end of a chain was the most intriguing part of this set for me it worked really well and when you were done scaring minifigures you could winch it up again ready for the next go the only thing i did not really like about this set was the difference in wheelsize on the car front small back large and the way the palmtree consisted out of just three parts all in all a great set that is becoming more rare and expensive as we speakpost get it edited by simonwillems 26 may 2008  0759 pm	positive
great review i just barly missed the jungle series growing up with half a year of jungle and mainly orient expedition and dino island i like egypt more but this set despite the 4x4 palm tree is practically perfect i love the detail and vibrant colours gotta say ive got a thing for pippin reed myself by the way what does vhtf mean edited by sdpirate 28 may 2008  0106 am	positive
vhtf very hard to find to answer some earlier replies no there are no stickers in this set while some adventurers sets of the era had stickers the 5956 zeppelin had tons all of the interesting mesoamerican designs from this set are printed also simonwillems was correct my mechanic is missing his hat which should be a black kepi theyre extremely expensive on bl though proving once again that this set has some awesome parts so i ordered a replacement from lego its in the mail and should come soon	positive
the printed pieces are the real gems of this set beyond them there isnt much to this set though the boat hull is nice the model itself isnt all that great the new akator temple is definately a superior model at least in piece count but those printed pieces are hard to resist steve	negative

welcome to cardinal bricks review of 7736 its a small set but as i bought it the other day i felt that it probably did merit a short review the box is ofcourse far larger than necessary theres plenty of air inside the contence is one bag and the instruction booklet you could proably build it inside the bag if the desire took you we have one new coastguard with the slightly stubly head found in the castle range and a transclear visor the build was challanging and arduious the final product is quite nice at one 300 its a good set only 50p more than an impulse set and with enough extra parts to justify the increase in the price a good set for a little gift or so on the buggy moves well theres not that much to say really for i cant really think of additional models to build with the parts but then what do you expect for the price edited by cardinal brick 26 may 2008  0647 pm	positive

thank you very much for the nice review 5150 lego the helicopter is  apart from that it is very very big and that it does not include any interior  a very nice set  the most i like the life raft becuase it is simply  nevertheless i dont know if i buy it probably not  but its very nice two questions  where can you fasten the stretcher on to haul it up and down is the motor working with batteries klausdieter edited by klausdieter 28 may 2008  0919 pm	neutral
great review 5150 although you might want to resize your pictures before posting them so they dont take forever to load quote wow i was skeptical of this coast guard line i was actually the complete opposite ever since i saw the first pictures i fell in love with the whole line the helicopter looks to be one of the two best in the line right up with the 4wd and jetski great job tlc and i do hope you have something equally as great planned for next year	neutral

nice review the helicopter reminds a sikorsky chopperisnt it	positive
i could tell from the pictures that a lot maybe all the designs on the raft were stickers in the whole set are there any printed parts besides the torsos or is it all stickers	negative
all stickers im afraid though imnot a fan of stickers myself some sets like ferrari for example take longer to put on than building the actual set this one is not as sticker heavy as it seams though and the ones that areon there really give the set that extra touch printed would have been preffered of course but in this case i didnt mind it	negative

oky wan kenobi on may 30 2008 0919 pm said but i have some questions about the grey new parts in the life raft are they 1x1 like their counterparts with the clips or 1x2 and can they be held by a minifig by the handle  btw which jedi has an orange eta 2 i guess it should work with mfs hmm i think it´s count citrus	neutral
im rather fond of helicopters and have built many different types this doesnt really remind me of any particular model other than perhaps an eh 101 merlin and even that resemblance is very superficial just for the record this is a sikorsky sea king and this is a sikorsky mh53 a derivation of the ch53 the only resemblance i see with the former is the colour scheme and with the latter the fact that its got a fat rearend sponsons and six blades it doesnt matter though because i really like it the colour scheme is great the shape is nice its got quite a bit of detail and i just have to get my hands on the cockpit window and those new rotor blades when i first saw the large aircraft pieces a few years ago i figured they were very much singleuse parts but the tail end doesnt look too bad pretty clever i like the raft too it really does look like the real deal that the helicopter cant lift it really isnt an issue because in real life they wouldnt lift the raft either theyd use the rescue hoist to lift the occupants of the raft into the helicopter one by one or perhaps in pairs imagine a storm with a helicopter hovering over tall waves with a big fat raft strung from a cable underneath it the raft would catch a lot of wind and flop around quite a bit causing it to loose all its occupants and also yanking the helicopter around possibly causing the pilot to loose control and crash bad idea cheers ralph edited by ralphs 30 may 2008  1109 pm	negative

thank you for clearing that up i felt that it was ok to review an old topic as stated rather than just go ahead and start a new one a shame that this set as all other batman sets have gone up so highly in value but still all things considering general after market lego price hikes it is still a wonderfull set even with its market value today that is if you can ignore the mrsp	positive
i too thought the jokers van was the pleasant surprise of this set the tumbler looks good yes until you see it in person its grossly oversized they should have made it closer to a regular car size like the movie because this one is a monster	neutral
i bought this off ebay while not having been collecting space as a child it was mainly wild west and city i have decided upon reading kdogs mtron bar brawl mania strip in his space comic to buy as many mtron sets and figures i could find except i got distracted and bought some different sets as well to start off with heres a picture of the box heres a general shot showing the entire set a front view the buggy another shot of the buggy without the minifig the flyer the flyer without the minifig mtron crate with some equipment and hoses i dont know the use of the hoses though  the cockpit open the cockpit closed with the crew the magnetic crane another shot of the crane rear view with hatch open one of the side slots that can carry either the buggy or the flyer top view of this excellent vehicle excellent for getting spyrius or blacktron out of your way  final shot excellent set one of the biggest space ground vehicles and one of the best sets made by lego undoubtably better than its newer counterpart the mt101 armored drilling unit a great addition to any collection and has a lot of cool neat features that make it have a lot of playability simply excellent five out of five	positive
great review of a great set i always figured the hoses were welding torches attached to jetpacks yeah as the whole thing had the vibe of a mobile repair center much like many of my favorite sets this one has a base of simple bricks and plates and then from that solid foundation the rest is built out to be decorative or have the action features this gives sets a very solid feel as demonstrated in this set the first snowspeeder and galaxy explorer the mm armored drilling unit has a more technic base giving it a less solid appearance and though i like the set that jet that luanches from the back is horrible partially because of the useless orange containment things the mega core has a nifty crane instead of a big useless jet tohst	positive
sinner on may 28 2008 0235 pm said care to explain why the mcm has a pure weight of parts that i find hard to quantify but love it is just so dense when you build it full of nice surprises no technique required and a wonderful stearing mechanism that i rank as more important than the suspension of the mars version this thing was meant to crush anyway who needs suspension i also like the way you never felt that the mtrons deserved a base after building this it was that good the colour scheme was perfect its space and i like it enough said great review btw god bless nathan naturally youre entitled to your inferior opinion	positive

fun review thanks kinda sad to think that with tlcs recent ban on magnets in their products well never see an mtron revival 	neutral
i love the design of the front canopy of this set but i always felt that they could have done more with the rest of the model this set is good candidate for customization though there is quite a bit on unused space inside especially in the middle section i want to try putting a technicstyle engine into mine at some point along with the necessary gearing i got my mcm brand new off ebay some years ago for a pretty good price but the box was very worn out and the big transneon panel which floats freely inside the box was a bit damaged as for the hosejetpack things i always assumed that they were either welding torches or flamethrowers take your pick quote kinda sad to think that with tlcs recent ban on magnets in their products first time ive heard of that what are they going to do for the train couplings	neutral
thanks for the review maybe i can pick one off ebay	neutral
it looks like youre right about the old magnets i got a few off pab two months ago but they no longer have them i guess i should grab some while theyre still widely available on bricklink as they can be useful in a number of situations on a side note one interesting thing about this set is that it seemingly had two uscanada names mega core magnetizer and multi core magnetizer brickset lugnet and all the other sites ive seen call it mega but i have some north american catalogs from that time period that call it multi and the box also says multi on it i actually didnt know the mega name at all until many years after the mtron line	neutral
this does look alot better than the new mm drilling tank great work	positive
inertia on may 29 2008 0844 am said i just thought that the mt101 was very skeletal and couldnt really steer that well although i do like it also the mcm has a better design in my view as the wheels are closer together making it look a lot more tankish than the mt101 also space in the rear isnt wasted on having a shuttle thanks for an answer ill shut up now so we can focus on your review	neutral
sinner on may 29 2008 0520 pm said no but we especially imperialshadows are working on new indexes supposedly the space one was my job okay just dont forget this when it goes up i like self promotion i have about 10 old space sets coming in from ebay and gonna review them soon as well so that should be some good additions to the index when it goes up thanks	neutral
asuka on may 30 2008 0217 am said of course i don´t want to offend some technic lovers and although i always was more the system kind of guy why can´t they just use some technic beams with studs at least thats because of cost the older beams needed a four sided mold and the newer ones need only a two lego do seem to be using both types more as of late though asuka on may 30 2008 0217 am said i grew up with just imagine with pictures of alternative models on the box and i don´t think it´s that easy especially for younger kids to mod some of these terrific blownup sets like it once was with sets like this one here implosion off ive never heard an official word perhaps i should raise a topic but i think that they dont show them any more because it became a support nightmare what do i mean i bet tlg was tired of letters and calls saying timmy cant make this model shown on the box can you send instructions and the extra parts i know that for some recent models they were designed but not published how do i know this the creator said so	neutral

asuka on may 30 2008 0117 am said thanks for that fine review of a really classic and impressive mtron set inertia i was in debt to the set its so good i just had to make a review it got here i built it then took pictures maybe i should buy another sinner on may 30 2008 0838 am said ive never heard an official word perhaps i should raise a topic but i think that they dont show them any more because it became a support nightmare what do i mean i bet tlg was tired of letters and calls saying timmy cant make this model shown on the box can you send instructions and the extra parts i know that for some recent models they were designed but not published how do i know this the creator said so hmm i think my parents probably contributed to that when i was younger  anyway now because of the glorius creation of the internet we can share the instructions or make them iron moose on may 30 2008 1000 am said ive heard that the alien moon stalker was called the thunderfoot launcher somewhere ah yes here httpnewslugnetcn51449tiva ah thats interesting i wonder why they do that	positive
this super set contains many of the city sets you can get for your mini city hospital the smallest set is the 7902 car with a doctor i thought it looked a bit too slow here is a car you can build with the same bricks the instruction manual for the ambulance does contain a picture of an alternate model but it is actually quite hard to build something significantly different this sets lacks some snotbricks so i had to be a little more creative and came up with this ambulance it is more a hearse than an ambulance the helicopter has a lot of slopes so i built a speed boat for those special emergencies unlike the first two sets i used far from all the bricks in this this set does really have some great parts the brickshelf gallery with some more pictures is anyone up to the challenge and build some alternate models of the last set in the super pack  the hospital	positive
thank you very much asuka but i get the hint last	neutral
these are great i especially love the speed boat and your ambulance reminds me of ecto 1 i would take you up on your challenge but i dont own the hospital it seemed overpriced to me	positive
harley  mistah j i want to preface my review by admitting that i’m an unrepentant harley quinn fanboy i’ve been enamored with the character since she first appeared in batman the animated series back in the 90’s and i’ve since followed her misadventures through her introduction into the regular batman series during no man’s land into her own series and even on the shortlived and notsogood birds of prey tv show so please excuse any proharley bias so down to business the 267 piece set retails for 30 us 35 at toys r us and builds up very fast and easy it consists of batman’s bat cycle harley’s hammer truck and brand new batman and harley quinn minifigs there is also no lack of weapons in addition to the usual bag of bataccessories and guns the set also comes with a pair of gray revolvers batman in this set has the new “armor” torso print and the hips are the same color as the legs hinting that this is supposed to represent the movie style batsuits more so then the traditional comic book “underwear over tights” look harley quinn is a very cool looking minifig and i haven’t grinned so much at a new batman character figure since my first batman minifig a couple years ago the figure is very true to the character and the torso has been accented with a few shape lines to try and distinguish her as a female despite the boxy body harley’s jester cap is an interesting new piece it seems to me at least to be made of a slightly different grade of plastic then we’re used to it’s molded in red and painted with black and white and it comes packed in its own separate little baggie i expect that this piece may have cost lego a little more then usual to produce harley also has a buildable accessory a giant mallet sure she can’t stand up all that well unless it’s held in specific ways but it’s neat and most importantly it’s funny it’s especially fun for smacking the everloving crap out of other minifigs with the bat cycle is in bag number one and is a very fast build this isn’t some little japanese sport bike like nightwing’s cycle this monster is almost a car and seems to pack just the right amount of intimidation for the caped crusader to exploit thanks to the thick tires two in front one in back it stands up just fine on its own and rolls very well the huge exhaust pipes are a nice touch and give the thing a look of engine power the only real flaw is the inclusion of the flickfire missiles mounted on the sides but as with any lego model they can be easily left out without hurting the look of the vehicle the hammer truck is the bulk of this set and a lot more fun then it looks of the monster truck persuasion the vehicle is designed and built with a surprising level of solidity the axle mounts are particularly impressive the big wheels and tires just beg you to drive this thing right over the bat cycle or batman the megamallet gimmick is also a surprise not so much for its technical complexity there isn’t any really but for the fact that once you start turning the knob at the rear to swing the mallet back and forth it’s really a lot of fun there are some low points to the truck design again the flickfire missiles are tacked on and there’s a cargo cratebed set into the back for harley’s loot of jewels the crate would have looked a lot better molded in black in brown it breaks up the look of the truck a little speaking of which the look of the truck is very pleasing the red and black harley quinn color scheme works really well on the vehicle there are a few stickers here and unfortunately the diamond patterned ones are applied over multiple bricks the rest however are great not only does she have an “i love joker” bumper sticker but she has a joker playing card taped to her dash i guess serving as a picture of her beloved puddin’ there is also a sticker for activation of the hammer which boldly shouts hit me this is a fun set a neat new batman vehicle and a big truck with lots of playability the harley minifig is a musthave for any batfan and if you only get one of the batman sets this year i’d recommend this one the price versus piececount on this set is a little bit of a deterrent though this might not be the best set for collectors on a budget or people looking for something completely new and innovative but anyone buying this for a child can rest assured that the kid will get your money’s worth out of the set through its play value when added together and averaged out the pros and cons of this set combine to give it a score of out of 5 even if harley herself is a clean 6 out of 5	positive

hi all so i was at the walmart yesterday and had the munchies and was looking for something to eat somewhere along the line i stopped caring about food and decided to browse the toy department to see what they had legowise usually they have jack squat but on this particular day they had a lot of new sets i impulsively picked this set up along with harley quinns hammer truck and the new little campsite from the indy 4 line i must say when i first saw images of this set i wasnt exactly thrilled or anything i mean i didnt really see anything particularly special about it but after purchasing it i must admit that i would consider it a must buy for any lego fan but enough babbling about myself onward with the review my first of an official set in this picture you can see everything you get with the set i thought the boxart was pretty nice looking the manual on the other hand took somewhat of a beating within the box a common problem with most more recent sets i do have to say that i wish they would at least make some effort in fixing this they could just make a little thin cardboard folder to minimize bending and tears for batman minifig collectors the highlight of this set are the robin and penguin figs previously you could only get them in the pricey batcave set but this set provides a much cheaper alternative one thing you will notice however is that robins hairpiece is a new mold as it is actually a black version of mutts hair from the indy 4 line personally i think it actually looks better than the hairpiece used on the older version of robin as the batcave had before it this set comes with some bricks to make two cute but deadly penguins they help add more charm to an already charming set when youre finished building youll end up with a nice little assortment of extra parts 1 black cheese slope 3 1x1 tile black yellow and white a revolver a technic pin and a 1x1 red round plate heres robins scuba jet its nice and sleek looking notable parts of interest would probably be the green turbine engines my only complaint on this one would have to be the use of decals on the 2x2 round yellow tiles for that type of a part printing seems as though it would have been the best way to go now for in my opinion the best part of the setthe penguins sub this set has more decals than robins scuba jet but they seem more necessary in this case i actually wanted to put the decals on the sub as i think the it looks great with them obviously it looks like a penguin but wow does it ever do it with style it has a lot of interactive features the first of which i will mention being the periscope which raises up and down and for the collectors of parts in new colors it has a few parts in medium orange such as 2x2 tile heres a shot of the bottom of the sub another nifty little feature is how you can lift the top off and fit the penguin inside and there is enough room inside so that you can firmly place top on again and without interference to the movement of the periscope another little feature is the rear springloaded missile you just tilt the small lever toward the front of the sub and it fires and the last small feature are the flickmissiles on each side overall this is a great set with a lot to offer for a decent price a lot of fans might view the only drawback to it as being the use of decals but if you plan on keeping the kit together they make it look really fantastic buy it if you can matt edited by imperialshadows 01 june 2008  1142 am	positive

you know i like many had doubts about these sets when they were first mentioned but ive decided i want the whole line now this set is the créme de la créme just beautifully stunning that is a great review sveltecorps you have gone into fantastic detail and description of all the elements really it is this review that has persuaded me to buy this set i blame you the minifigs are great the vehicles are better and the truck and interior is awesome the few minor draw backs are far outweighed by the attention to detail and the many unique and cool elements used in this set and printed pieces that is even better great job you have obviously put a tremendous effort in making this review and i for one definitely appreciate it i am looking forward to these sets being available in new zealand	positive

sveltecorps a fanastic review of this biggest agents set at first i was not very keen to have this set however after reading your review you have make me swing up and down its simply fabulous thanks for your hard work i am sure its not easy to do this review i love that female minifig she looks awfully sweet especially with her new hair great job	positive

thanks for another wonderful review sveltecorps a very fine set indeed i absolutely love the way all of the vehicles fit into the command centre very clever the projector is really cool it looks very nice its great to see these light and sound bricks in the agents sets all of the little nooks and crannies in the centre are great too i really love the amount of detail featured mixed with all of the playability of this set the minifigs  as usual  are brilliant the uniforms look fantastic dr inferno looks especially great i love his white suit with hints of orange and who can forget his hair im really tempted to buy this beast now though im not sure my wallet will forgive me for it i suppose ill have to cut back on indy and castle multiples for now thanks for the truly great review sveltecorps nice work	positive
wow this set looks so amazing amazing genius davinci art i say youve done an excellent job reviewing and really this is the review ive been waiting for so cool so classy i love the mission briefing feature to think that lego could go so high as to put something ingenious like that in there too bad lego figures dont have fingers to make shadow shows eh genius the jet lauching feature is pretty slick and they even put a control center in there too thats beast loving that the bottomi dont see how that big buggy can get out or in there but awesome too the back of the truck could use more detailing i think but the jail popopen feature is pretty cool as is the speed boat storage rack cabin its great that roof opening feature is a great part of this set also i think you can have multiple figures up theremaybe you can mod it to put a bed in there it certainly looks big enough inferno plane wow that think is smooth baby i love how the wings contain rotors inside of them thats awesome detail right there that is a sweet ship thingy so slick the rest of the command center is pretty awesome too we get a 4x4 wheeler and a crane and lots of room wow just wow great review great set you are well worthy of your custom title im gonna go buy this for only 90 woot	positive
great review thanks thats one hell of a set i think lego has reached a certain kind of peak with the design cleverness and fun of this one im so relieved that agents seems to be shaping up to be even better then i thought it was going to beand i thought it was going to be cool to begin with agent charge not only does he look like dash justice but he has the name of one of dashs alpha team squadmates i call shenanigans	positive
wow excellent review thanks that set sure looks fantastic its incredible how much features theyve managed to pack in while keeping it roomy im really impressed by the quality of the design tlc is sure getting back on track with great design ow 2008 is going to be expensive	positive

7645  mt61 crystal reaper piece count 600 price aud7995 4995 euros in most countries 3999 gbp usd 4999 its happened in the wider world and it had to happen to lego  yes the 80s are back space invaders holograms compulsory seatbelt wearing legislation and the return of classic space ok we dont have a fully fledged classic space theme back yet but if 7645 is the way of the future i think lego is ready to do it properly i wasnt a huge fan of last years mars mission sets and only picked up a few on clearance but this set is light years excuse the pun ahead of 2007s offerings this mining vehicle is solid compact and welldesigned it looks impressive and even better it has fantastic power functions operability behold 7645  mt61 crystal reaper ps i wasnt joking about the holograms or seat belts part 1 box instructions dsss dreaded sticker sheets parts front of box back of box 2 x instruction booklets dss numero uno  for the reaper dss number two  apologies for the blurry pic but i wanted to capture the sweet shimmy of the metallic holographic background on this sheet the way it catches the light really makes a difference to the small alien craft and makes it look much more interesting from the plain stickers of last year theres heaps of spare silvery stuff once the stickers are applied for those who use the leftover sticker material for customising parts bags  4 numbered with one extra with larger pieces parts everywhere  woo i know the lego instruction books scold me if i mix bags but im a devilmaycare kind of guy in your face tlc i love mixing all the parts together before i build it reminds me of my youth when the days were long anything was possible and i didnt need strict instructions not to build on grass or poke my eye out with a technic shooter interesting parts  these may or may not be new my technic knowledge is not that detailed the little scoop parts are so cute and have a heap of potential uses i love em theyre like smurf hats at miniland scale these technic wheel things in orange are also cute they kind of remind me of marigolds giant fabuland marigolds the track pieces  you get 70 of these  heres the section of track for one side  as you can see its about 52 studs long these hold together better than the small ones on the hailfire droid jungle cutter part 2 minifigs small mining transport alien ship i have to confess  i forgot to take an individual snap of the astronauts  its the usual bunch though  scaredy face guy sunglasses in space man and a third one i cant remember you dont really care though youre only interested in the alien commander and his matching arms legs combo deal as brickbitz noted in his review of the smaller set the glowy eye is just a 1x1 cylinder the set also comes with 2 normal jellies  one pictured here for size youll see what happened to the other one soon enough the alien craft is nothing exciting apart from the gorgeous glinting stickers heres the road safety angle the commander actually clips onto a 1x2 plate with handle so he cant fall out then the lime tentacle thing descends on top of him to keep him firmly there like a baby seat not very brave for an alien commander is he i mean did darth vader ever use a seatbelt tssk with cradle up this part of the build also includes the small astronaut mining buggy  small and effective please note in this build ive applied stickers to everything bar cockpit pieces this comes with radio and saw piece part 3 the reaper the first part of the build is the detachable shuttle i really like the retro aesthetic of this with the angled wings and the side hoverpod things it is much better than the comparable vehicle from 7699 the new flickfire piece is a waste of space  its fairly limp i prefer the simple flickfire technic pin to be honest theres also a very nice little side workshop as you can see i really like how the control unit is plugged into the wall via 5 1x1 round plates third pic its a bit dark great detail the technic pins on the back are there to connect the power functions battery box its odd theyre included at this stage of the instructions  maybe the intention was to release it originally with all the necessary motors etc but the price point was too high and they scaled it back the base the shuttle sits on that bley technic axle in the middle when the reaper is fully assembled the little vehicle scoots down the ramp at the rear which folds up to hold it in place when the reaper is in motion you can see theres a crystal container here as well  another nice small detail which i found the 2007 sets lacked theres also an alien here  thankfully not in those horrendous transorange tubes so prevalent last year the complete assembly isnt it snug its just the right size too  not massive but large enough to be a serious mining vehicle the ominous black treads contrast nicely with the white orange colour scheme of the vehicle itself the trans detailing  blue for weapons neon green for energy  is carried nicely through the whole set the blades and the scoops whirl nicely as the machine trundles along top down view tread detail whirling blades of death the buggy descends probably the most disturbing aspect of the whole set is this pic the jelly has an orange pump plugged into its heart which is connected to an energy supply on the left hand side this vehicle runs on alien jelly juice either that or its milking the jelly in some equally disturbing fashion how amoral is that i know theres been debate about this  the jellys arent innocent theyre evil energy crystal thieving maniacs etc  but i find it a bit odd that the humans respond by chaining the jelly up to the bowels of their mining vehcile and suck energy from its heart people debate about violence in lego as represented by realistic minifig weapons but i think the moral lesson here is even worse  its ok to exploit foreign life forms for our own gain if they treat us badly first whofans i think the ood should have a word with the jelly commander  that aside this set is welldesigned and fairly good value at aud7995 its definitely a notch above last years mars mission sets overall with improved detailing and more useful functions the holostickers are fab and its nice to have an alien commander even if he is a bit bulky and his fingers are identical to his toes however if all these reasons by themselves werent reason to recomend this set the following is part 4 power functions the best part of this set  and the reason i bought it really  is the integration of power functions bizarrely this isnt mentioned at all on the box and i only found out about it from the instructions when they were posted on eurobricks instructions for book 2 which has the power function stuff available here this is a great idea and hopefully we will see more new sets take this kind of approach especially with the new train sets luckily i got monster dino 4958 on sale for half price earlier this year so already had most of the necessary motors etc  the only one needed was an extra small one what you need is listed in the instructions below with redirections to shop  home to buy the motors note theres actually a mistake on this page the 2 small motors you need are both 8883 not 8882 which is the large xl motor way to confuse the kids there lego attaching them was a dream and only took a few minutes in contrast to 4958 where it was almost impossible to remove motor elements without dismantling the model basically the back platform and some plates and orange slopes come off you attach the motors and then the smaller plates go back on these parts are now left loose overall the look of the reaper isnt badly effected as youre mainly viewing from the front anyway sadly i cant show you how it moves youll just have to trust me that it does  the way it is steered is demonsrated in the instruction pages above basically each motor is controlled by a corresponding switch on the remote move them both forward to move forward move one right to turn right move both back to move back etc it zips along its a speedy little thing personally i wouldnt want to be in its path as it comes roaring down the martian canyon my cat was scared as it was it is oodles of fun and definitely worth trying if you have the motors or can get them cheaply and adds a whole new dimension to the play aspect of playset it is also as i said very quick to switch between modded and nonmodded reaper in contrast to the more fiddly dino creations the only problem i had is that if it moves too fast the weight of the battery box at the back tends to pull the whole thing back and it rears up it does correct itself though i only trialled this on carpet last night so it may behave differently on other surfaces  i will need to experiment part 5 summation this is a great set made even better with the addition of power functions at aud7995 its wellpriced buy it buy the motors as well kmart still has stock of 4958 at 89 wait for a 15 off sale you wont regret it buy 2 and make competing battle machines the only thing is just dont torture that poor jelly edited by sinner 24 june 2008  0325 am	positive

i was going to buy this set anyway but now im even more excited d my favorite part of this set is the bay that holds the little cart vehicles	positive
thank you for that fine review sveltecorps that´s a pretty cool set much more solid than the armoured drilling unit with a nice little transporter and some for sure pretty interesting additional power functions a very smart idea indeed did i miss something or is there really only one and probably improved shooting device and there´re even some levers to control the vehicles wow a matured marsmission on indeed now let´s get rid of these poor utilized jellies and we´re right on the way	positive
isnt it a lovely set i too have one modded of course 	positive
so is there some way to get all those motor bits at once or do you have to buy them on their own i dont think ive ever seen them in a store here	neutral
this should be reported to the news 	neutral
well i guess its nice that theyre making the story background a little more clear with that jelly plugged into the power cable hmmh both jellies and crystals can be used as power sources think theres a connection both of them are transparent and greenish maybe jellies hatch from crystals like eggs or need them as food or something important like that yay for evil humans	positive
thanks for the great review sveltecorps i bought some of the mm last year and ended up selling them off for sw this new set has got me interested in mm again partly due to your cool review one question though did you get this set in aust shops or sh just wondering if i should be looking for it yet edit sorry just saw your other post saying it was ordered from sh cheers isc edited by i scream clone 04 june 2008  0808 am	positive
excellent review loving this set i mean come on its a flipping tank awesomeness is written all over this  from all those blades and scoops at the front to the mini rover and yes you can even turn it into a motorized battle tank reminds me of the old technic days when they advertised in the manuals how to hook up the kits with separately sold motors another day another review of an awesome set yes this is sure tlcs year	positive
algernon on jun 5 2008 0203 pm said why is it that agents and star wars get their own news articles but this fantastic set is totally ignored i think maybe theres a bit of star wars excitement on the front page which has probably got a few members frothing with excitement not every review needs to be frontpaged anyway 	neutral
no but this is one of the most anticipated sets of 08	neutral
well title says it the description youll understand later i ordered this off of sh last tuesday and oddly enough its listed on sh as mx81 hypersonic airplane id like to apologize for the random horrible faded pics i took the review outside and the clouds kept shifting changing the lighting and then i had to go inside because it started raining its been raining for a week its raining now as i type this so i foolishly went outside to take pics the front of the box not bad as far as boxes go it features a liftup tab which shows the various functions back of the box still not much to say two manuals i think this is just right not too thick but not too many manuals either oddly enough the box came with a little folded up piece of paper telling us not to mix the bags it comes sorted into 4 bags by the way minifigures the set features 3 normal mm figs 1 normal jellie and one of the new commanders i really like this guy he has a few issues like his hands being stuck sideways and still being hollow but still a great improvement hell make a lovely addition to any halloween moc stickers the set comes with a fairly big dss for the spacecraft pretty normal but i do like the dragon sticker then suprises of suprises a technicolor sticker sheet for the aliens how cool is this huh the tops of the actual stickers are shiny which is hard to see in the pic even the bottom is shiny who said stickers cant be cool the mining craft the little guy is pretty cute and well built my only gripe is that theres nowhere to spin the drill it seems so lifeless without a feature the alien craft youd think a commander would be important enough to have a seatbelt rather than be stabbed with a clip and stuck on the ship like those other grunt aliens i think this thing has some potential shiny stickers different body shape and when you look at those engines this thing could be an alien corvette but then you look at the back pretty bare no flares or anything its a cool little craft but it justlacks the modules these things have some potential as well with some modding they could be pretty cool unfortunetly its pretty boxy there are no engines and the wings are too small the top is pretty nice though the greebles are all right the controls as usual are a sticker pretty spacious mind you the cockpit doesnt stay flush with the body though the front plate underneath it can be easily replaced with a brick to fix that im not gonna comment on this the main body too bad the labratory isnt much of a lab a transred panel and some tray thing are all that compose the lab i was expecting more but true to form this mars mission set has no impressive interior to speak of there is a lot of space though so it shouldnt be hard to mod phew the lab folds up like so pretty simple and would allow access to the lab if there was one and then we have this thing what is it defense laser communications array satellite tv the modules connect like so sorry out of place too bad the pins stick out various pics as you can see this thing has more of those bars than an att commercial there you understand the topic description now  the rear it uses a white city plane wing for thewings when i first saw the prototype pics i thought they slanted downwards that wouldve been really cool ah now to the platform from the position of the drill i think this could be a really cool turret location when i mod it to more military space back to the bars if we had space monkeys theyd love this this set has more bars than a jungle gym  here we see the button that drops the platform pretty clever and its not in the way best of all it really works really well actually good job tlc 2 more bars and a shooter mechanism jeeze this is really setting itself up for a joke a shooter mechanism walks into a bar never mind here we have the handle that allows you to pick it up safely a good idea but its placed waaaay to far back way off the center of balance you have to hold on to it pretty well to keep it angled up though it does stop your hands from getting in the way of the platform ah the platform in action this is really a neat little feature not only can the ship land in a reduced footprint but it also prevents the nice white paint job from getting red dust all over it its centered pretty well too and you dont have to worry about knocking it over just dont shove it back at all here we have the latch when the button on top is pushed this gets pulled inward which pulls out of this hole and allows it to swing neatly down good luck and happy mining again sorry for the lack of inprogress review i wouldve liked to take pics of the mechanism and so on but typical of the mm sets you cant really take it apart well this is really a nice set which can hopefully be upgraded with a better lab with little difficulty some of my military mod plans include strip the lab and install a command center get rid of lots of bars the thing has more bars than alcatraz install some turrets this is a big command ship so why all the forwardfacing weapons itll need some aa defense mod the landing platform to be a troop dropper with installable aa turret mod the cockpit pods to be more aerodymic so thats all folks shall i include one last bar joke	neutral
thanks for the review i really like all the mars mission sets this year the usage of the big wing is a bit annoying but you cant blame lego for reusing the mold ive been considering doing the same with mine mr mandalorian on jun 4 2008 0219 pm said so thats all folks shall i include one last bar joke i wouldnt have a bar of it	neutral
thanks for the review mr mandalorian this is an er interesting set lots of frontal firepower very big too and i like the idea of those two little craft that attach on the sides sort of like little escape pod things anywho not one of the things on my to buy list but i do like that radioactive sticker that could come in use looking forward to seeing your modifications too peace	positive
iron moose on jun 4 2008 0234 am said that certainly feels like an homage to the deep freeze defender which itself feels like an homage to the galaxy commander thats the observation i had when i saw the first pictures of this set online a few months ago i am a proud owner of the 6973 deep freeze defender and 6980 galaxy commander so im looking forward to see how the 7644 stacks up next to them there is a definite lineage here and these sets clearly demonstrate the evolution of lego set design over the years the mx81 may not have the most playability out of all the new mm sets although it has alot from what i can tell but its hard to beat the look of a large sleek space cruiser sitting on your shelf or dresser at least for myself anyhow this is my first post to the forum and hope my welcome wont wear out here anytime soon edited by spacefan 04 june 2008  0643 pm	positive

i dont understand why theres so much negativity this is actually my favorite of the new mm sets the finished look is very sleek and not very gappy at all the deployable landing pad is great and itll make it easy to put on a shelf without taking too much room lots of greebles although i will concede that its just begging to be modded still though im definitely buying this one  it has a really great look to it	positive

great review mr boba fett i really like this set a lot some of the features may not be as good as i hoped they would but overall this looks to be a really nice set im so happy that the giant spacecrafts are finally back quote ive noticed a trend that the larger sets have plenty of parts potential but when assembled the model is not more than the sum of the parts eagle base certainly didnt seem worth the asking price at least this is one large model on a positive note the lame aero tubes darts and martian carrier pods have disappeared hm actually i dont see the comparison eagle base looked terible to me right from the start so it was no suprise when it ended up being the weakest kit in the first year this big ship on the other hand looked great as soon as i saw it and still looks good	positive
wow ill definately have to check this one out i always tried making a big mining deployment ship but it always turned out crappy edited by maiq the liar 04 june 2008  1052 pm	neutral
thanks for the review i actually quite like this i cant afford it so im not getting too attached to it but in its own way its great its certainly reminiscent of space sets of the past as others have said and the dropdown ramp section is just really cool as an idea you understand sure the lab is a little crap but at least the effort was made sort of  the sheer fact that its so big though really makes me like this theres just something appealing about large spaceships not capital ships just big space ships with lots of guns spacefan on jun 4 2008 1034 pm said anyway i hope were not breaking forum protocol by not discussing the 7644 review of the original poster or that particular set in general hey its no worse than batbrick and i no really it isnt even in the same league	positive
i think this thing is compensating the poor lab with the bar army	positive
sorry mr mandalorian i guess i was just getting a bit defensive because when this set first appeared here there were literally 2 pages of people just bagging out the new mm sets but then the thread took a turn and people started to warm to them much like the agents i do agree that it definitely needs some mocing but with that work i think it has the potential to be a really amazing set in terms of what you could cram into it the lab is a little disappointing ive always wanted an enclosed cabin space in a vehicle this size because then all the little space guys can have a true meeting place the dropdown landing ramp is my favourite part it has lots of potential uses maybe its even possible to integrate pneumatics d	positive
hello shefols and afols as well as tfols welcome to eb news reviews i am your hostfor tonight anyway shadows will take over after this episode if we make more today we are reviewing mars impulse sets 5616 and 5617 starting with 5617 alien jet i must say it is a small and quick build the jellie is made of hard plastic which surprised me as i had expected jellies to be a soft plastic the jet is mainly 2x4 plates some swingy hinges the seatbelt and a thing which i cannot seem to name my one gripe about it is that the jelly cant see where he is flying it looks better with a mf in it there was a red 1x1 as a spare part we move on to the 5616 mini robot which is basically a safe brick with binoculars soem cheese slopes little arms and legs the best part i must say was the metal detector and safe brick as these seem to be quite rare in sets by my knowlage anyway the austronaut has a face shown in dr sinsters review the set also comes with a pickaxe and lime green gem extra peices where a cheese slope a green 1x1 and a white droid arm that concludes these minireviews i also will use this opportunity to show my photo setup both sets are reccomended if you either need a army or are just trying to get a variaty of figs like myself next weecamera fades edited by sinner 24 june 2008  0417 am	neutral

thanks for that nice review of a really interesting and pretty cool set at least a griffin i guess is pretty close to an unicorn or a dragon huh	neutral
guys thanks for your kind comments i am glad that you have enjoyed this review for this set i think i bought about 7 to 8 sets all for the griffins its used for my griffin riders in my castle collection now the green and brown parts come in very handy for castle mocs too imperialshadows on jun 9 2008 1113 pm said a very nice little review of a pretty nice little set that i wish id bought between 1 and 10 of just for the griffin oh well your review has shown me that its useful for more than just that so maybe ill try to pick one up someday cant have too many black capes books or printed things speaking of which the gray thing is technically a plume like any castle plume except in this case its a feather presumably from the griffin and made from the mold to the old indian feathers in the wild west sets its a case of an old part coming back for a slightly new use in a new colour beyond that the stone print tile is a bundle or rolled up blanket or package depending on where its used i dont think its ever meant to be a stone it was used as a rolled up pack on the back of the star wars speederbikes for example nice pics plenty of useful information id give this review an a thanks for doing it i am very happy that you enjoyed and find my review useful thanks for enlighten me now i know where is the origin of that gray plume i wonder if i can use it to match with my castle knights as its plume in addition i mistook the rolled up pack as the stone print tile why didnt i think of it i must have overlook it and used it as a stone tile instead nevertheless i am glad you have give me some good insights on the parts that i am not familar with sveltecorps on jun 10 2008 1049 am said thanks for the nice review  it was one of the first ones i got when emerging from my dark ages  i bought two of these just for buckbeack  i thought he would make a good statue in a persian temple type moc i also liked the minifig head pumpkin and plant part in bright green  both new pieces to me at the time all in all it was a good castle or forest building set with a nice selection of pieces for rocks grass plants and trees the dark bley plume piece also now appears in the 10185 green grocer set as detailing on the roof of the turret i never thought of using buckbeak as a statue for worship i find this concept very interesting yes i agreed that this set offers new parts at that time personally i pretty like the green plant good for any kind of terrain settings i did not realise that the dark bley plume piece appear in the green grocer thanks for pointing out edited by whitefang 10 june 2008  0339 am	positive
guys thanks for your comments glad you find this review useful and be sure to watch out for more old sets reviews mr spielbrick on jun 12 2008 1228 am said this draco is the best tlc has made if you ask me the new one also doubling for belloq and guards in the indy line doesnt look quite as hautain as this one buckbeak looks cool looks like his neckhead can be moved right rather similar to lego horses well designed mr spielbrick thanks for pointing out some important highlights for the review i have overlooked it earlier i strongly agreed with you that this draco is the best tlc made i pretty like the face compared to others furthermore i used my multiple dracos for my castle armor guards instead one could not have too many dracos buckbeak design is well made the head can be moved upwards and downwards the mechanism is similar to the horse design in addition buckbeak wings can be removed similar to the typical green or black dragon wings that we used to see in the past well the main reason for me to buy this set was in fact buckbeak you dont often find a griffin lying around except in harry potter sets mr spielbrick on jun 12 2008 1228 am said the orange brick doesnt have a pumpkin face on it right unlike the one from philosophers stone in the set with the troll sorry to said there is no print on that pumpkin face its pure orange	positive
im looking forward to getting this set as well the hippogriff will become the valiant steed to my princess minifig for her comic adventures im really annoyed that the harry potter sets were released during my dark age i so wouldve wanted all of them	neutral

very cool review 	neutral
hello eb yes im cranking out the reviews the other day i picked up this gem for an okay sales price at devonport tas while searching for the new batsets i informed iamded of this as he is a spideysuckup   and he informed me this was the only set he didnt have of the wave 2 of this theme so i ask you great eb members to please remind him of this when commenting here we go with the review of doctopus lair anyway unlike other reviews this stars more people the batbrickiamdeddragonatordaisy review daisy is the mouse that came in the set first up re the figs and i must say they are great i love fleshies and these are excellent to expand my batman world plus having a spiderman to beat up is good too doctopus is great though his tentacles are annoying to keep in order peter parker is a nice addition i love that torso eve though harry osborn was totally absent from this scene i welcome him as he is a good fig also best of all is mary jane fleshie females are hard to come by and i love that hair my very first one oh and even better is bley daisy on the far right another fantastic thing is that by mixing mj with doctopus you get a far more deadly and real villain than anyone couldve forseen  the hippy oh cmon tell me that aint cool anyhoo here is a pic of doctopus showing his might random fact did you know i influence both dragonator and iamded in their sigfigs dragonator adapts his from my ia series while iamded added mutt hair when i had him like that in a pic i posted now onto the box sorry about the lighting the art is good and the cartoon spidey in the corner may have beenthe inspiration for a similar style in the new batsets back of the box again sorry about the lighting and blur it was gtting late and these were the last pics finally we get to the first part of the set the catapult is that movie accurate or what i love the part in sm2 when he uses his homemade genetic spider powered catapult to launch himself to the scene oh well it does comes with a cool spider web an trans blue spider so it gets some points and it is really fun i launched spidey several metres once i dont think he ever recovered infact he almost certainly webbed himself slightly cooler extras are these two this awesome little boat is great for city as is the simple but nice bouy daisy approves naturally dragonator ruins everything when he found out the dragon that would be riding with him was our nickname for daisy now finally the main attraction  coctopus dock iamded and i threw dragonator in the water to see if he could swim he er couldnt one sweeney todd later we continue the overall construction of the building is very good i know a lot of people hated stickers and i hated applying these but they do look spectacular and perfect for any city setting like a bank a gotham bank as iamded has already noted below me the black lifesavers a very cool as are the web piece and log pieces the inside contains the neutron copperplate triple bypass humdrum holy hum 5000 which does does see movie anyhoo it is very cool and includes a little control thingy on the yellow brick next to it unfortunately the inside is plain but for that the other side has no wall too which is a bit of a letdown really but atleast it allows daisy easy access one gripe is those yellow 1x1 bricks they serve no purpose and break up the colour scheme better shot of the thingy thing i quite like it the use of technic parts actually works and the whole set is worth it for those purple flames and dishes alone it closes up pretty well too unable to hit the dish which is a nice feature me and iamded liked it so much we threw a revived dragonator into it unfortunately it disagreed with him but it was fun another shot of the dock i like how they have gaps in the jetty i know the movie version was pretty wack and although the set isnt very faithful to it looks more like a seaside library to be frank it still is very nice this is my first large blue baseplate too which is wonderful though funny how the set only uses about half of it the roof is a well designed and fun feature it uses some technic connections to render it flexible of any degree as you can see here by my opening of it better shot of the roof design it can lie flat or at any angle i might use the design myself in the future as much as i love the building this feature bugs me for in order for it to work this wall has to stick out which not only looks ugly but makes you be able to see through the corners still easily modded and log pieces are fantastic for mocing it also means that there are 7 windows all up for a good sizeable building by pulling out the piece in the center the walls both collapss sideways outwards which is actually pretty fun and works everytime overall view of the set including characters now for the story that makes no senseat all spiderman is dead after falling down the wall mechanism see above only daisy can save the day for dragonator is being held by the evil doctopus and iamded and dragonator are too busy not caring and brainbox is too busy complaining that this goes against all marvel continuity unfortunately daisy is on a lunchbreak so tough luck dragonator and daisy goes on a search for fortune and glory okay this is what i think of the set build 35  fun but those stickers ruin the experience somewhat and if you dont apply them the instructions are a bit hard to follow playability 45  great little gizmos and bits not the kind that keep you going like with the 2007 aquabase but good fun still design 45  not very movie faithful no but still a great little building and a smart design for certain aspects minifigs 55  great figs with all different faces and very useful bits price 25 far far overpriced even on sale sadly total 1825  a good set that couldve been better with a few minor changes nothing wrong with it but it doesnt really cross the line to greatness that said it has a lot going for it and definitely worth buying or atleast a look

where is my soap haha anyway nice review as always batbrick i too have the set and hate the wall jutting out catapult and missing wall but hey review	negative
great review batbrick i was curious as to what the interior of the building looked like i still think that there should have been a few random chains or something lying around as they may add to the abandoned feeling that the ware house had though i have to admit that i really like the roof dock and minifigs as some of them make good average civilians that are somewhat hard to come by in todays sets  great comic as well it seemed to add a lot to your review hope you can review another spider man set soon  btw as adam mentioned i believe you owe me a bar of soap for reading your review  edited by mack 14 june 2008  1259 am	neutral

batbrick on jun 13 2008 0944 pm said for dragonator is being held by the evil doctopus and iamded and dragonator are too busy not caring wait dragonators not caring that hes being held by doc ock what are you doing a very nice finish to the interview now i really want this set the story at the end was neat except for spidey dieing  but my favourite part was the exploding dragonator nothing personal mate it just looks cool when people are thrown into fusion reactors peace	neutral

i picked up this set mainly because of the many 5spare glow in the dark parts and the promise of 2 racers and one helicopter for the price of a little more than two racers 90kr vs 2x40kr the box the back of the box shows the two alternate models you can build if the polybags rip there are 3 cheese slopes and two 1x2 tiles that glow in the dark where the tiles are exclusive for this set the total parts count is high at 142 but there are no really big pieces among them inside the box you will find the building instructions a sheet with some odd sticky labels thrown away and 3 polybags marked by the bag building difficulty the models the lime colored car doesnt bring out anything new we have seen racers built like that before but it does contain some nice bricks for the collection the police cruiser surprises with an interesting design along the sides as seen here it is harder to build because of the greater level of details the helicopter is without doubt the hardest vehicle to build in a bag i cant finish it because its larger than the bag you cant put on the top blades nor the tail of the thing so it beats the forklift from 7733 where the top bar is the new kind that doesnt completely fit there is also instructions for the alternate models but it requires the bags to be opened the vehicles are pretty standard for the racers theme with the police car being the highlight of the set conclusion i like the difficulty curve between bag 1 and 2 but the last bag should be labeled 1000000 instead of 3 it requires some inhuman skills to build that helicopter in the bag  lime colored car 3  we have seen it before but it has some nice pieces and lime police cruiser 9  it has a massive diffusers rare parts and a high level of details it is a shame lego relies so much on stickers helicopter 6  if you see it as a set for one fourth of the price of the cars it is quite amazing but you cant bag build it and i would personally prefer some more detail instead of the big size overall it is a nice little set but the police car is the main attraction i wouldnt get the other vehicles if they were sold separately brickshelf gallery edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0703 pm indexed	negative
yknow you can open the bag	neutral
its called challenging ones self p plus you can resell it as misb since its still sealed in the polybags lol	neutral
now now dont judge people who do this there have been bigger sets that were done in the bag to each his own 	neutral
ahhh bag building that takes me back i suspect that if i didnt do my bag building topic my eb life would have turned out very differently for the negative nancies i suggest you try it i bought a set just so i could and i found it fun not fun enough to do it again though thanks for the interesting review	neutral
adiksalego on jun 17 2008 1002 am said now now dont judge people who do this there have been bigger sets that were done in the bag to each his own  you make it sound like i did something deeply socially deviating like being an adult playing with lego but back on topic open the bags if they were meant to be opened why did lego close them in the first place bag building is not for everybody some might become very frustrated with it and let their anger out on the set by lining it up on a mini golf course	neutral
nice review but i think bag building is a boring way to build	neutral
seeming as there were no reviews of this set in the index i have uploaded mine from jabbas hutt  here is my review for lego set 10178 motorized walking atat because i live in the uk i got this set with 6 free duracell batteries which was great its just twice as expensive as the us heres the basic set that is from the instructions this is the cockpit but please note after i took this photo i realised it was slightly built wrong heres one of the feet in proportion to a minifig to give you a general size this is luke skywalker swinging on a wire trying to destroy the atat i really wish lego didnt make so many lukes because i want differnt minifigs it would also be nice for a thermal detonator piece underneath the atat you can see the shaft that moves the back legs the motor and squeezed in on the righ t the massive battery box a load of cogs that move the legs these are the included figures snowtrooper general maximilian veers atat driverpilot or whatever you want to call him and luke all whithout there wepons please note veers should have a dark stone snowtroooper torso with 4 red and blue badge things not 3 these are the figures with weapons i gave them and the included ones snowtrooper has new style blaster veers has standard light grey pistol like the ones from the old adventure sets atat driver has old style blaster which i call heavy blaster and luke has shiny handle blue light sabre  the shiny blue light sabre was included with the set which is a bonus because i really dont like the grey ones httpwwwbrickshelsc00521jpgjpg this is the switch which is attached to the battery box on either side of the atat underneath the lift up side panels you push the forward to walk forward and backward to walk backwards simple eh  a front veiw with the the panels open here are the drivers controls which are simply a cotrol panel and 2 exoforce robot hands which are joystick things seen in the film if you look closley the almost useless carry handle this is the weird back piece looking down the atat from the back where you can see the the battery box and switch troops decending from ropes and cables and vader leading the assult for this i hadnt got any more imps so i used clones pilots i now have a whole load more snowtroopers solo and chewie sabotaging more troops to squash rebel scum huzahh a very bad picture of everyone packed up inside the size incomparison to its predecessor overall i would give this set 910 because it should come with more snowtroopers or it could be and endor version with loads of strormies and scout troopers aswell as this you can really sit any one down because of the battery box but i stilll find space to put all the shown figures on this review in the interior as you can see on the above image the chains and ropes are hanging down a bit tjis set is now limited to 5 per customer in the uk and now no longer comes with free batteries the walking on this is a bit wonky and dosent really walk like they do in the film as it moves two legs at a time i am currently attaching a motor to the head to make it move independently	negative
nice review i have the original atat and i like it a lot considered buying this one but it being motorized made me not also i think a set this size could really come with some more snowies benny	negative
great review indexing it as i write this how come you think the ctt is the atats predecessor do you mean the motorized atat or atats in general i think this is a great set and i am very fond of mine its one of the few sw sets of mine that is on parade at all times most are packed away in the attic kimt btw its not alone the older version of the atat is keeping it company	positive

i mean by the clone turbo tank turned into the atat i think in the films when they changed all there technology and vehicles when they became the empire	neutral
as far as i know the atat was a invention by general veers himself benny	neutral
nice job with this review skipper	neutral
nice review  the driverpilot whatever you call him   s helmet looks kind of odd and why does have a long red pole instead of a kickbutt lightsaber	negative
smithboy on jun 20 2008 0601 pm said i doubt that the atat was used in the clone wars well you never know maby veers was around then just because it was used in the clone wars dosent mean that veers didnt design it to wookiepedia	neutral
vader had a red pole because i think it makes him look bigger and in the films i doubt it is but i think his saber might be bigger	neutral
i never got the set it looked way to skinny i came close to buying it for the figs but then decided not to if you compared this one to the later one there is a big difference this one just didnt seem proporshined with the legs and its body	negative
thank you for the review skipper i never got this set because it was too expensive and motorized it completley reminded me of the old robotic toys called zoids or maybe even gundum at least the figs are great a chrome lightsabe hilt for luke ecxellent and the pilot is cool too and another snowie doesnt hurt and i didnt even know about the commander guy whatever you call him so people could have made a custom ds this whole time thanks again	positive
thanks for the review eh honestly i though this was awful ever since i first saw the pictures to me an incomplete grey ball doesnt really work as a special ucs kit for the sole reason that its boring extremely so now the new death star playset is a whole different story they should have done that in the first place edited by grevious 24 june 2008  0912 pm	negative
even though i never liked ucs i absolutley hate this one sure its great on display but the build looks extremley boring to me just stacking plate after plate and as you said its going to break a little if you touch it the only intersting part for me is the firing laser although i do have to say the proce isnt too bad i still wouldt buy it and no minifigs so thanks for the review but ill pass on this one the new minifig scale ds looks awesome though and this might have hyped some up who are buying the new ds	negative

great review kimt  i like this set even if i don´t own it because it looks simple fantastic to display i just have one question the mini executor can be moved around the death star ii or its attached to that place thanks for the review 	positive
darkrebellion on jun 25 2008 1239 am said great review kimt  i like this set even if i don´t own it because it looks simple fantastic to display i just have one question the mini executor can be moved around the death star ii or its attached to that place thanks for the review  its attached to the ds and cannot move as such though there is 4 spots where it can be attached to the ds reading your comments on this set i can see why tlg has been forced to put it on sale on the us sh i dont agree that the isd is better  imho theyre exactly them same  big and grey this is a question of personal liking  which is the coolest ds or isd not comparative id still call this an ok ucs when looking at it individually but there sure is a lot other ucs sets that would get a better score than 510 kimt	positive
i also dont feel this is a very good set but is that old grey in which case it would be a nice part pack dr brick	negative
thanks for the review kimt honestly like the others have said i dont find any appeal in ucs sets especially this one its just a big incomplete grey ball	negative
the build was a bit boring and i suppose a big grey ball isnt all that interesting but since the death star ii in the movie is a big grey ball too i dont see the problem i didnt think it was particularly fragile i dont care about minifigs or playability either a few plusses in my opinion it looked pretty damn impressive sitting in my lego room and the construction is really clever all in all i actually liked this one but perhaps i have a different expectation of sets than most of you sets are mainly parts packs and would you look at the quantity of grey plate in this thing its new grey btw i paid half price for it at shophome uk which is still a lot more than half price from the us and i didnt regret it for a second cheers ralph	negative
wow what a letdown i recently picked up this set and i looked up this review to see what i was getting into not good news the silver lining is that it was a damaged box deal at brickworld so it only cost me 100 half off the already lowered price so it was definatley worth it as a parts pack if nothing else its the last unopenedunbuilt large kit in my collection so even if it is repetetive i am going to build it anyway it is likely however that i may substitute pieces to do away with the colored interior ive already determined that after it sits on display for a while i want to do a zepplin as an alternate build looking at the parts list it looks like its the perfect set for such an undertaking	negative
id love to get my hands on one of these but youd need about three jobs to justify the prices of this guy on ebay fantastic review kimt	neutral
kimt on jun 24 2008 0322 pm said 4 zero swooshability i think its very swooshable assuming you swoosh it at the same speed it moves in the movie d while i would never do something like this i bet if you packed this sucker with a bunch of m80 firecrackers it would make for a fantastic end to a stop motion movie with it being as delicate as you say it is i bet you wouldnt destroy any parts edited by gotoandlego 03 april 2010  0257 pm	positive
dang so much negativity on a such spectacular set this baby provides an amazing backdrop to any lego inspired star wars diorama and lets face it lego tends to be a rectangular brick and somehow we now have a sphere guys its a ucs it accurately depicts the on screen icon and put plain and simple is a wonderful sculptural piece of work in its own right i agree with kimt in that the removal of the laser and super star destroyer gives it more authenticity but to call it a gray golf ball or ignore its inherent accuracy is simply to miss the point it proved to be the best build to share with someone be it family or friend due to its repeated sections and impressive finish its a clever build and to criticize it for lack of playability or i suspect for many its absence of minifigs is just absurd and possibly why lego has not released a proper ucs in nearly two years i reckon many out there would love a ucs tyderium imperial walker or slave 1 with a spectacular piece count be it minifig scale or just darn impressive in its own right sadly for those who love these sculptural masterpieces were stuck with simple toys with play features and cute minifigs clever in their own right but lacking the clout and purity of the old ucs line lets hope some diversity of product is just around the corner else 10179 was the last of the truly brave financial gambles of the star wars line	positive
neoconagenda on 24 june 2015  1129 pm said i decided to reread this review because i just got this set today i dont really have a concern over the design or repeating build process because owning this set was never an option for me as i collect ucs sets but i am surprised to see an almost total lack of positive posts i really hope that i enjoy this build hi you may find this thread interesting i really enjoyed bricklinking it	neutral
ive just ordered the bits for this from bricklink im awaiting the final order now so im interested in these comments i can see that since ill be building it with the kids ill have to plan in plenty of breaks and do lots of parallel building to keep us all from getting bored	positive
7656 general greivouss starfighter release 2007 number of pieces 232 minifigs 1 brickset welcome this is my first review so contstructive critisism is very much appreciated on to the review first we start out with the box the box art is the same as always since 2006 nothing special then we start the build the build is fairly easy and will take the seasoned builder about 1520 min to complete here is the finished model and birds eye view as you can see this ship is very sleek the fins or wings each have an outer slope and an inner one with the guns in between there are also cones on the front of the fins which give the ship an even more sleek look in the middle of the wings there is the main body with a big slope and stripes decorating it this set has a very good playability factor as im about to show you now the guns on the ship are pretty cool looking to begin with a bley slope attaching a lightsaber hilt and a transneon green stud to the fin on each side but theres more than what meets the eye yes the guns flip up and they can flip all the way back to hide them for whatever case they need hiding lets have a look at the back there is a tail fin used as landing gear and some lightspeed boosters but wait the tail fin can flip up for flight thanks to a hinge attached to the back of the cockpit heres another playability factor the cockpit can slide open very smoothly and easily heres how this is possible a clever system under the hood allows the cockpit to open see those two bley pieces on the black ones those bley ones attach to the tan plates under the hood and the hood and windsheild attach to the black peices the black and bley pieces work together as a sliding system so the cockpit opens viola and then the cockpit snaps in place thanks to the red hook and clip its a very accurate system and works very well youll want to open and close it over and over again now finnaly to the fig the general himself a very impressive fig with a new head and torso mold in this set which is one of only two with greivous in it he comes with 2 green and two blue lightsabers all with bley hilts   i was hoping for chrome hilts but its a minor fault grievous also comes with a new mold pistol blaster not pictured heres the general in the cockpit sadly a weak cockpit no details he just half lays down on a small slope in this set he doesnt come with a cape beacuse with it on the cockpit doesnt close thats about it heres the final verdict build 710 fairly easy but fun a little bit weak playability 810 many playability factors but some are boring or pointless swooshability 810 very fun to fly around sometimes pieces break off minifigs 1010 one amazing fig with 4 lightsabers and a new blaster what more could you ask for design 910 very sleek but hardly any real texture i like it but others might want greebling price 1010 overall score 910 a very cool ship with a very cool minifig and accessories one of the best sw sets i have ever seen for its small price i highly recommend it to any kind of sw lego or sw lego fan hope you enjoyed my review please leave feedback edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0301 am	positive
very nice review jim i havent bought this set yet but am planning to just to get a gg fig as i dont have one already bought an imperial landing craft instead this week as it was on sale but after this review ggs fighter is sure to follow soon benny	neutral

does the sliding cockpit come off easily my friends brothers breaks everytime you touch it but he may have built it wrong it put me off the set	negative
jameseh on jun 28 2008 0824 pm said does the sliding cockpit come off easily my friends brothers breaks everytime you touch it but he may have built it wrong it put me off the set im very sad to say that sometimes it does but thats only if you hold it from the top and bottom with your fingers and thumb respectivly but if you hold it in your palm or from the sides it wont break emphasis on sometimes but dont try to mess around with it by removing its pieces or adding new one or modding it in any way because the sliding mechanism wont agree with the mods and break but this hardly takes away from anyone liking this set because imo its perfect just how it is	negative

hey your review is great as usual as for the set itself  well its an impulse set after all  small and cheap nothing special well the rat is special hehe for me the rat is the most interesting in the set cause i dont have a rat i dont have a troll warrior either but im not very interested	neutral

guys thanks for your kind comments it seemed most of us here love this impulse set mainly to build army guess i am a little bit too critic in my review i was expecting a little bit more nevertheless i intend to buy multiple sets of this and build on my orc armies and split them into different battalions this is indeed one of the better ways to acquire orcs wilhelm screamer on jul 3 2008 1130 am said i got two of these in the mail today and was so eager to do a review of it thanks for saving me the work opps i was eager to do a review as well when i bought these sets i hope you enjoyed reading this comprehensive review nikola bathory on jul 3 2008 0408 pm said hey your review is great as usual as for the set itself  well its an impulse set after all  small and cheap nothing special well the rat is special hehe for me the rat is the most interesting in the set cause i dont have a rat i dont have a troll warrior either but im not very interested give the new theme a chance i feel tlg have made an effort to revive certain elements that are present in past castle themes although it is not as good as the past but it is certainly better than the recent castle themes shoc on jul 4 2008 0100 am said why is mouse friendlier than rat well mouse sounded more friendly because it can associate with tom and jerry but calling it a rat equal calling it a pest its just a matter of putting it in different terms thats all edit instead of posting another post to explain why i used mouse i will write it here tom and jerry is reflected as a cartoon children associate jerry as a mouse since its supposed to be heartwarming and make us laugh in real life there are many different pets we raised one of the possible pets we considered is a mouse mouse are supposed to be shy and friendly creatures that live in harmony while rats lived in packs hunt food in the dark and is widely regarded as a pest in this review i am trying to illustrate rat and associate it with mouse by presenting it in a much friendly approach there is no right or wrong answer its just making use of different words to represent how i feel towards a particular thing edited by whitefang 04 july 2008  0808 am	positive

looking at this is making me want to build one of the favourite sets of my childhood 6649 street sweeper might do that today actually cheap good pieces despite the lack of a bin lid thats just inviting disaster isnt it nice fig and one of those blue brushes which ive always loved but never managed to use thanks whitefang	positive

thanks for the review poor little minifig this guy has to haul the heavy machine all the way from the depot onto the littered streets to locate some trash but when he has finally found some and switches on the machine everything will be launched towards his pants no wonder hes looking sad a nice set though and inventive too when it comes to streetsweepers i remember getting the first of its kind on my birthday in 1991	positive
hello all eurobricks members i will be doing a continuation of my impulse set reviews this will be the third review at a go hope everyone of you will find this review useful in a way name coast guard kayak theme lego system  town  city year 2008 pieces 21 minifigs 1 an image of a 5621 coast guard kayak roll roll roll your boat it seemed the coast guard has a kayak of his own roaming in the sea making sure that swimmers will be safe in the beach now i am illustrating him as a life guard instead this set is simply wonderful among the 4 new impulse sets coast guard kayak is the best looking set in my opnion the kayak design is very simple but looks realistic  furthermore if you dont need it to be a coast guard kind of stuff use it as a leisure water spot instead down in the marina i will think any lego citizen will love to have some water spot in their busy life so come down here and wind down with this new sport bits and pieces kayak and the bouy the bouy is very useful to position it at the coast of your water to highlight the boundaries in the sea and warning incoming ships or vessels oh i did not make it tilted purposely there is a white round base which allow it to tilt on both ends useful parts these parts are useful to add on in your city somehow when i see that red cone i can use it as a police stop to inspect vehicles on the road or form a barricade with it the bouy base shape is unique too i like it very much it is great to attached it by the side of the boat as a life bouy the coast guards life vest and helmet are very useful for water activites the life vest was produced in past sets and now it resurfaced again i am glad these vests made their way back a look of him without the life vest summary review playability 7510 fun to play with especially the bouy when you see it moving up and down design 8510 design is simple but straight to the point especially the kayak design price 810 an inexpensive set to get more coast guards and more kayaks overall 8510 a very good set to have in your lego town the kayak is simply so lovely to me hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated	positive

thanks for pics the hawk it seems to me lacks a cockpit theres not even a seat to keep the pilot from falling off perhaps it theyd redesigned it to be a backpack jetpack sort of unit using similar pieces itd at least make some sense based on the other mm impluses can we assume this goes for 35usd at that price it seems to me that the astro fighter at 5usd was already a superior impluse set guess id buy one on clearance for the minifig	neutral

thanks for another review whitefang this is quite a nice set actually it evokes some of the design elements of the mx11 while looking different enough to justify me buying it the head on the astronaut is one i like so even better i hadnt realised it was that one actually does 26 pieces make it one of the bigger impulses sets i think i may have to get one if not two plus its called crystal hawk how can that not be considered cool	positive

thank you for the nice review this set has a very classic space feeling so i dont care about the lack of cockpit a nice little set with a nice minifig	positive
i really like the look of this impulse set even though i sold off my mm sets to buy sw i kept my astro fighter and this impulse set really appealed from the moment i laid eyes on it i feel the swooshability and cool extras like the double sided face far outweigh the lack of cockpit thanks for another great review whitefang	positive
i like this one aswell it has a couple of parts i need for an moc train locomotive and i dont have any of those space guys yet and a double faced guy is always a winner in my book	positive
thanks for another great review i definitely like this set sure the interior might be a bit bare but i think that the outside of the base with all of the great lava and rocks more than makes up for it it is a bit weird that on the one side there is nothing on the inside but thats easy to fix anyone know when this will be out in the us thanks again for the fantastic review	positive

i didnt exactly know where this belongs the best but i think it fits the best in here cause its somewhat space related i got this nifty little set yesterday from an auction ebay new and sealed i think the rock raiders theme was a great theme and i wish they would have continues id back then but anyway lets see what we got here set nr 4910 name hover scout number of minifigs 1 number of pieces 39 release year 1999 first a picture of the little box  instructions a general overview of the set and here we have the lovely  miss jet yes the minifigures had odfficial names in this theme  the little vehicle and finally the crystal analysis station i like that very much even if its simple but it does a good job and the amount of equipment also is cool thats it little set little review but big fun i can recommend that to everybody its great for the parts and the minifig is lovely gets a 1010 from me	positive

when i got this set my first rock raiders set i thought it was the best set i ever had maybe that was a little bit of an overstatement but i like a lot the pieces mainly and this is a nice little review are92 rowar on jul 10 2008 0822 pm said omg iamdeds torso  spoiler oh my god spoiler what would be more appropriate is commenting on iamdeds torso saying omg jets torso	positive
woo rock raiders only the best theme ever thats right possibly even better than castle 07 cheers for the review metalandi hopefully you can inspire others to see the greatness of rock raiders too i love how everything was so simple yet so effective it was loads of fun to play with and build the alternate models when i was younger as well and probably still is  do you plan of doing any other reviews or do you have any other sets rapid rider is another great small one adding a bit of diversity with a waterbased vehicle and you get the bandit minifig or you could get the rock raiders set and get all of our spelunking friends dont make me name them all  or if you want a slightly bigger set loader dozer could be the way to go axles a pretty cool minifig too and you get a rock monster sorry if the last comments were detracting from your review dont think i didnt like it becuase it was great i really hope you can do more oh and yes my torso does come from a female fig peace	positive
unfortunately i dont have any other sets yet i think i got one of the bigger vehicles back in the time but i dont have any sets from this time anymore but i certainly plan to get the loader dozer andor the chrome crusher soon i found an ebay auction where somebody is selling the sets 4940 4950 and 4970 new  sealed hopefully i have luck with that its only at 4 euros right now but its still running 6 days httpcgiebaydewtaitih005	neutral
great review  man this brings me back i still have like 5 of those rock monsters in response to your statement rock raiders does belong in this forum being everything space related 1 its on an alien planet 2 in the computer games start and in the story yes there was a computer gamemy cousin has it they are in a space ship 3 there are huge alien rock monsters trying to kill them	positive
sinner on jul 20 2008 0456 pm said i consider rock raiders space too i also consider many of the diver themes space as well me too the rock raiders are very scifi with the best lego space storyline the aquazonies would be inner space rather than outer space though but they look very spacey edited by shoc 20 july 2008  0745 pm	neutral

jimbutcher on jul 10 2008 0944 pm said a hidden compartment now this was a very cool idea by tlg a secret compartment found by taking off the top slope of the hull youre supposed to slide the front of the hull off rather than lift the top piece off	neutral
ill be honest  i dont like this ship at all its one of my least favourite ships in the pt and i have to yet buy either one of those sets i also found it funny that this set was meant to be a walmart exclusive yet never appeared on the shelves at my walmart anyhow thanks for the review	negative
nice review jim i think i would only buy this for darth maul though you definitely showcased all the cool features really well	neutral
i got this set last year and i think you made a mistake when you have remove a piece to access the probe droids and equipment you just have to slide the entire main part and i have a question is this equipped with the new flickfire missiles that dont fall off	neutral

hey all so i purchased the remaining three agents sets i needed and saw that there was no review up yet for this set heres the first batch of parts and the first instruction bits the mini figures the first small vehicles heres a mistake that i found in the instruction booklet there is no difference between steps 2 and 3 the team inferno boat this is a nice chunky boat that looks fairly heavy duty and evily its nice to see the smooth disks on the bottom that lego seemingly havnt done in recent boatplane sets and the agents submarine this is a nice build aswell nice and long with a few hidden compartments one for missiles a place to put the treasure some final shots of the completed set the spare bits another special mention has to go out to slime face i think he is my favourite ever lego character the detail on his unique torso is brilliant his head is fantastic and his costume just looks great with the black and green plus green is my favourite colour check out the back of his torso with the slime pouring down deep sea quest was £3499 price  910  this is a pretty reasonable price for a fairly substantial set parts  810  a lot of nice bits few nice boats bits and a lot of smooth disk things minifigures  1010 as i said slime face is my favourite lego character and the details brilliant vehicles  810 both very good with some interesting features build  810 a pretty fun build overall  910 its gotta be if just for slime face alone but this really is a great set	positive

sveltecorps on jul 11 2008 0914 am said i would have liked it if theyd gone all the way and made it some kind of giant robot jellyfish or squid coughalphateamcough anyway i was about to reply earlier and say  great review svelte then i realised it was not you nice reveiw anyway the only reason i would get this set would be if i got all the other agents sets  all the sw cw sets  all the pieces i need on bl  all the new city ect setsthen i would think about geting it	neutral
darthlegois on jul 11 2008 1028 am said color0000ff coughalphateamcough id forgotten about ogels mutant vehicles i guess i meant a bigger cross between the 8636 sub and the big squid from 7775 aquabase invasion  that is such a great design sort of keep the retro feel but make it bigger with the 8636 sub theres really only room for one agent to sit and despite its size theres just a few not amazingly great functions such as the hidden chest and missiles	positive

great review this set totally owns alpha team deep sea the sub design actually looks like a sub the figures are way better the acessories are better  everything is better agents may have my vote for the best theme of the year quote i wonder if it will last longer than one year unlike other recent oneanddone themes oh dont worry  a second wave will be coming next year this was confirmed by both legomilk and in an interview with an agents designer	positive
i forgot to comment on this review great job rezourceman like sveltecorps said your pics really show off the set and what there is to it i just ordered this and the volcano base off sh and i cant wait for them to come so ill comment on these reviews i forgot about i love the inferno boat as you say in your review it looks very heavy duty and ready to take on the agents the sub i quite like from the look of it though there is the problem of too little space i will try and correct that the dark blue is especially good and i love slime face his torso is very cool sveltecorps on jul 11 2008 0914 am said i cant say this is my favourite agents set the boat is a little oddly proportioned and the sub although retro looking has practically no interior and would be difficult to customise to put more in unlike say the clever job batbrick did with the penguin sub in his review wow thanks for that little mention is it impossible or just very hard to mod sveltecorps on jul 11 2008 0914 am said i do agree with you about slime face  he has a fantastic torso with all the slime dripping down which is a bit obscured by the air tank its really encouraging that in the last 2 missions weve had great extra villains added in the only thing i would add about the octopus is that the glow in the dark plastic is mixed in unevenly with the aqua blue so it doesnt glow in the dark evenly  its kind of like the mars mission jellies in that respect though much cooler the octopus sounds great thanks for that is he meant to be on any side im guessing hes a mutant inferno creature about slime face is his head much different to the joker bombs i know he has slime marks on his head are they very apparent thanks again for the review batbrick away	positive
sveltecorps on jul 19 2008 1020 am said nothing is impossible to mod probably the easiest part to change would be the front where the missiles are and the treasure chest slides out  you could make a sizeable compartment there however the middle section is so narrow and the end fins are just that  fins  that it might be harder to expand without changing the shape of the sub youll find out soon when yours arrives thanks for that info i will definitely try anyway when i get the set see if i cant loosen up a few dark blue bricks at the same time sveltecorps on jul 19 2008 1020 am said its not really clear but since all the other mutants are evil or at least controlled by dr inferno its probably a safe bet the squid is too slime faces head is different to the joker bombs  different eyes and teeth although the smile is similar i guess and the slime marks are much more apparent in the flesh or abs although they dont photograph that way joker bomb face below for contrast ah thanks for that info i see that they are more different than i thought now i hope the slime looks good when i get him batbrick away	neutral
wow thanks for the review that is one awesome set slime face is excellent i must add him to the collection i think we need some new agents theres so many inferno minifigures now maybe next year thanks again	positive
inertia on jul 21 2008 1229 pm said wow thanks for the review that is one awesome set i think we need some new agents theres so many inferno minifigures now maybe next year theres only 2 infernos out of 8 sets which is pretty good theres way more agent chases and break jaws i agree though next year hopefully well have some new figs	positive
great looking set and that glowy blue octopus is really cute i might just get it for that be great in a space moc wondering from the pdf instructions i saw it wasnt clear what the agent in the sub is sitting on hows his seat work and it looks like theres a compartment below him	positive
6927 all terrain vehicle year released 1981 piece count 167 minifigs 2 list price 1450 a very unique vehicle in the classic space collection was this allterrain vehicle which i always considered more along the line of a mobile lab the set introducedinfused white and black bricks with classic blue space pieces the result was this great classic vehicle the set includes two figs still red and white heres a view of the vehicle which is really two components the vehicle itself and the lab section i absolutely loved the the blue windshield slopes 2 included and the unique upsidedown large blue slope in the back of the vehicle is the blue lab the back section of the vehicle has hinges that allow the jets sections to open the brick design fits perfectly into the lab and when opened the lab falls to the ground note the little round trans red 1x1s allow the lab to slide up and forward when the jet sections are closed i tried taking off the red 1x1s and the lab does not lift as easily with them the design is very clever esp for a classic set heres a shot of the standalone lab unlike earlier classic space windows this set has train window frames with yellow windows the top of the lab lifts up for playability inside the lab are several computers and a swivel chair back to the vehicle heres a shot of the cockpit with white steering wheel the left side has an upsidedown wrench and black antenna the right side a walkietalkie and another antenna the antennas can be used as breaks to keep the middle wheels from moving heres ashot of the under carriage and a final shot of the complete set for those of you following my classic space reviews this is review number 9 of 10 my final review of anall time favorite will be coming soon hope you enjoyed this review comments are always welcome	positive

this is a great little set i like how it combines two very different color schemes for different parts of the model i have made some slight modifications to mine adding a roof on the vehicle and a back wall on the outpost also those white 1x1 headlight plates at the front are thinner than the modern kind and seem to be quite weak i got this set off ebay a while ago and one of them was broken in shipping even though the set was otherwise in display model condition and the other one broke off while i was building the set i replaced them with the newer variety mutex on jul 10 2008 1137 pm said my only complain about this set was that i found that the wheels where too small  i had some trouble passing the rover over the little cratersmountains of the space plates the only bad thing about this set is the name it cant even roll over a single plates height not very all terrain at all edited by cp5670 11 july 2008  0743 am	positive

oh man this review takes me back i got this set when i was 8 years old and loved it i remember modding it to remove the lab in the back and i put in a giant laser cannon instead cause when youre 8 years old everything needs a giant laser cannon cp5670 on jul 11 2008 1243 am said the only bad thing about this set is the name it cant even roll over a single plates height not very all terrain at all ha very true the vehicle is built so low to the ground that the front end catches on everything	positive
quote great buy on this one what did it cost you it was 30 which was a pretty good price given the condition it had no box or instructions though this set is actually fairly common on ebay though considering how old it is i see them pretty frequently on there quote its a real nice set however there is one thing i dont understand about this design why is the driver seat has a wide back with no cover behind and the command center has no door at the back i understand that these space guys are always carrying their helmet around for oxygen supply i wonder if there is a better answer to it i just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed edited by cp5670 11 july 2008  0639 pm	neutral

ive always associated this set with 6929 the voyager theyre of the same timeframe and more or less the same style 6927 is without any doubt my favourite ground vehicle of space it was pretty simple but it was such a creative set the stories you could tell with this model g most defenitely in my top 5 of space sets	positive

my fish doctor has the torso from 7902 doctors car which is unfortunate because the other torso is more stylized and cartoonish i think however i did have that mad scientist lab set so a bit of digging through my old collection will hopefully yield the better torso	neutral
i recently bought this set for my daughters birthday its the first belville set that ive bought for her so its a bit of an experiment the house is 5 rooms and its made up of mostly large pieces there still is a decent amount of normal lego in it though the doorways in the house align when it is opened out starting with the bathroom included is a shower toilet sink with vanity and a baby potty the mirror sticker is one of the few that i put on the open plan loungekitchendining room is well appointed as well and it has a nice glass table and coffee machine the kitchen chairs are fabuland parts and dont work really well it seems they are having jellyfish for dinner the clock is the only printed part in the set upstairs is a baby room and the master bedroom the radio and the tv not shown were stickers to my disappointment up top is an extra room suitable for reading those antenna things were made from spare parts by my daughter i have no idea what they are supposed to be  there are some stickers that go on the back but i didnt put them on as it is the set looks ok this way but since it is a dolls house it doesnt really matter i do think though that the fireplace should have been given a back the bbq is made from normal parts and is quite effective i think it uses the same light brick thats in the 4998 stegosaurus set my kids were using it as a torch before my grumbling ruined their fun like all belville sets the highlight is arguably the accessories ill be borrowing a few of these from time to time here is the controversial baby catapult as you can see it works ok but lego probably should have tried a bit harder we also bought for her 7583 playful puppy it also comes with some nice accessories but not enough to justify buying unless you want the rest of the parts poor puppy where does he sleep here is my daughter assembling it she made me make the house though as she wanted to play a game we bought her note the lego drink bottles  i didnt take any photos of the figures as they dont seem to be anything new but i can if people want me to at the time i was in bit of a hurry as i took these before bed so i wouldnt be stressed if the kids broke it the next day overall these sets seem overpriced to me and hard to justify unless you actually want a buildable dolls house which we did its still too early to tell if my daughter likes it or not but at this stage it seems she lost interest in a few days she does tend to go back to toys though edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0703 pm indexed	negative

yay its good to see your kids get to build some stuff too sinner  all through the review i was thinking this was a present  but who actually put it together so im glad the last pic cleared things up as for the set  it looks much bigger than i expected  i think it does make a good sized dollhouse there are a stack of nice pieces in there  cupboards oven transblue 2x5 bricks all the accessories plants flowers food the lightup brick the pink roof slopes  but not enough to justify the aud129 retail price maybe on sale id pick it up and resell the belville figs but david jones hasnt even had a regular 20 off lego sale for the whole of this year that ive seen i think the playful puppy set is a horrendous ripoff for aud20 though i agree with the baby catapult  the range is terrible lego just isnt trying any more is it at least theyve moved on from throwing cats off three storey buildings 2 questions though 1 was it a fun build 2 are those large figs anatomically correct under their froufrou finery if not what the hell are they doing in the second pic whilst baby sylvia explores the oven	neutral
excellent review its nice to see how its nice to see how   its nice  okay i cant get over the sex in the bedroom and the unattended baby crawling into the oven i didnt read anything else except where does the puppy sleep and my daughter made me build this you are sick and twisted and thats why i love you it seems you are coining the belville edge now will you please stop sitting around eating clams and get that baby out of the oven or make the fun in the bedroom a threeway please thank you ps ok i read it i want the baby toilet and i think the jellyfish is supposed to be a jellomold i bet you knew that the fireplace lattice look like the harry potter one and not the fabuland one boo wienies when your daughter outgrows it will you turn it into a belleville star wars moc please thank you in advance	positive
i was sort of hoping for a flickfire baby still this looks decent for what it is i guess obviously it really is all about the accessories and its got em but not enough to make me spend that kind of cash and i dont even mind having a pile of pink parts around if you throw in a complete turkey or some birthday cakes its a slam dunk but as it is eh thanks for the review though its very nicely presented and leaves no doubt in my mind as to just how easy this set would be to misuse for other purposes	neutral
nice review good to see your almost letting your kids play with your lego i like the functionality of the baby catapult its good that they include some working features in a build this big are you not showing the figures because its really hugh hefners playboybelville mansion i dont see the grotto though must be an add on set like the poor puppy its just so darn pink	positive

sinner on jul 25 2008 0947 pm said im still undecided on if it was a smart buy she played with it a lot this week but last week she ignored it and i had to fix it twice my daughter is 12 and she still plays with all her belville stuff mostly the fairy princess castle sets if your daughter is anything like mine you will definitely get your moneys worth out of it however  as soon as my daughter says shes done with it i plan on raiding the sets for all those great food and accessory bits patience  great review by the way the belville sets are indeed overpriced but theyre probably legos best attempt at wooing the girl audience i still hate the fact that tlc thinks they need separate boy themes and girl themes but whatever theyre a very nice alternative to barbie  you get posable figures with realistic body proportions plus some creativity and building aspects thrown in	positive

7655 clone battle pack year 2007 number of pieces 58 number of minifigs 4 price 999 usd brickset welcome to my third review on eurobricks i hope you enjoy while at any store that sells lego target walmart tru etc you will notice that the clone battle packs on the shelf are way fewer in number than the droids battle pack as you might guess the clones are way more popular and finding them gets harder and harder as the release date of this set goes farther into the past so stock up alright heres a pic of the box a small box as expected for inexpensive sets like these note the build your army button on the front tlg obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples and with good reason which will be explained later in this review well lets get straight to it the contents of this set you will notice a speeder bike a gun turret and some clones looking good so far lets have a look at the turret an excellent star wars element to have around especially for mocing it is very cleverly built using a tire guard from city sets for the general shape of the turret mount all you have to do is attach the new mold explained later gun to the 2x1 plate with the center stud and presto i wonder how the clones build these turrets to fast in the middle of battle a rear view with a clone mounted my only gripe about the turret is that you have to take off the gun in order for every clone to have a gun now we move on to the vehicle of the set the speeder bike a rather sleek and good looking bike with some useful pieces on it as well such as the blue cones the megaphones and the engines some say it looks bare without the figs mounted on it but i think it looks just fine the commander drives while a trooper shoots on the back a side view and a rear view my only gripe is the same as the turret you have to remove the back gun for all the clones to have weapons while on foot the back pistol attaches to a 2x2 round studded plate with a technic hole in the middle finnaly here are the new guns this set comes with 1 new blaster rifle and three new pistols it could have included one more rifle for the turret and of course the figs includes 1 yellow commander lovely fig 1 shocktrooper comes with a pair of elctrobinouculars and two regular troopers so clean and white the figs are excellent all that any sw or lego fan should want it could have maybe included one more regular trooper but that might be pushing it thats all for now folks here is the final verdict build 810 extremely easy should take the seasoned builder about 5 minutes to complete a fun build though playability 510 i guess you can get this with the droid battle pack and make them battle but this set has no real play features of its own but it is good for collecting troops and using them for mocs swooshability 910 i guess you can zoom the speeder bike around minifigs 1010 four great figs that should be bought in multiples a great army builder design 1010 a clever turret an awesome speeder and four great clones what more do you need in a 10 dollar set price 810 not bad i suppose but if you calculate a dime for each piece this set should come out to 56 dollars but still billions of these are being sold worldwide and tlg is making a ton of money off of them overall score 9510 a truly memorable set one that will be a favorite for ages to come and very popular a great army builder for a small price plus vehicle and turret with only a few very minor flaws this set is one of the best of star wars and this concludes my review and as always comments are most welcome	positive
i got like 5 of theses hope we get the new clone battlepack do you ever think we will we will only get 5 clones if you buy all the new republic sets	positive

7654 droids battle pack year 2007 number of pieces 102 number of minifigs 7 price 999 usd brickset hi everybody and welcome to my fourth review on eurobricks today i will review the droid bttle pack set note this set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid but i replaced them along with the crooked arms with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms a picture of the box as it is on the shelves of majorretail stores a small box as expected for inexpensive sets like these note the build your army button on the front tlg obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples and with good reason which will be explained later in this review an overview of the sets content you can see a droid carrying vehicle a stap and some battle super battle droids a look at the carrier a light tank note the guns on the front the guns and cockpit can turn a little bit left and right from the main body also the guns can move up and down free from the cockpit and check out the cockpit two 2x1 center studded plates side by side for the pilot to stand on now moving on to the stap a small very useful vehicle in the sw universe these are seen frequently in both the movies and games as well as other multimedia the design is very clever using vertical building and a clear stand rear view the guns handlebars can go this far back and finally the figs the figs are very good but very common we havent seen sbds in a while and now instead of metallic blue they are metallic dark grey the worst part of this set is that the battle droids have the old arms and guns while the droids in the mtt and clone pack both of the same year as this have the new ones i wonder why tlg decided to do that again this set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid but i replaced them along with the crooked arms with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms so thats about it heres the final verdict build 810 very easy should take the seasoned builder about 510 minutes playability 610 has a few play feature but nothing exciting is good for mocs and army building swooshability 810 i suppose you could fly around the stap minifigs 710 the battle droids are good but very common and the dont come with new arms or guns the sbds are very nice and in a new color all figs are great for army building design 810 the stap was clever but the carrier was a little bulky price 1010 as fair as it gets overall 7510 the figs are great to have and make mocs and armies and the vehicles are pretty cool the carrier is a little lame the main problem with this set is that the bds dont get the new guns or arms so they dont fit in with all the new sets also droids arent as cool as clones but the price is very fair and now my review has ended unfortunately i believe this will be my last review for a long time for two reasons one the remaining sets that arent done according to kimts index i either dont have or are broken or have missing pieces and two my budget is low right now and i wont be able to get the clone wars sets right when they are released so someone will probably beat me to reviewing them too bad because i would love to do an rgs review well as always comments very welcome	positive

whitefang on jul 13 2008 1125 am said the wheels are pretty different i dont remember seeing these wheels in many other vehicles maybe some members can help me on this first of all another great review thanks for doing these as for the wheels these were primarily technic wheels but did find their way into some other models in white i can only find a handful of minifig sets that they are included with theres half a dozen space sets but apart from the 4wheelin truck the only other town set appears to be the 6524 blizzard blazer tractor with snow plough the wheels were also in a train set called 4549 road  rail hauler where they were the wheels on a big forklift cheers rog	neutral
love this set nice review also i had the set in my hands a few times but never bought it though i drooled at it i remember i guess i didnt get pocket money at that time it was not that common around europe in the 80s i guess so better to say that no one bought it for me a few years later i got the safari truck which is also really sweet i like the colors of this model and the detail of it the minifig is really classic made only for this set appears in some later train sets as well and shows the exact image of the truck on the shirt including the motor piece one of the most detailed and loveliest little sets from a sweet era of legoland city ps voted o for outstanding edited by zzz 14 july 2008  0950 am	positive

whitefang on jul 13 2008 0137 pm said swoosh it around i will prefer to use it to vrooom it around on my road baseplates only vrooom it around your cars cant fly i just building my 6641 while im writing this and i have to say that its really really great	neutral

i now found pics too thats absolutely  after 10188 town plan this is the best city set ever i really like the neat landscape with the little hill there are a bench and some flowers on it too  and this brilliant cottage  great idea with that power function that the wind mill turns and then enable the lights of the cottage  concerning the city theme i must say in the last time tlg comes up with one great surprise after the other does anyone know where and when itll be available this year i think  otherwise there wouldnt be already pics would they and how much itll cost i think about 70 euros what do you think i only hope that itll be available in germany too otherwise i would be really if i am not able to get it since it is a must for every city and environment fan klausdieter edited by klausdieter 14 july 2008  0649 pm	neutral

i recently got a few still sealed and new sets from the 90 on ebay and after the rock raiders hover scout this isthe second one ill review i really like the space port theme even if the sets may be more simple than earlier space city sets i like the overall look and the color scheme but enough of that lets go on with the pictures set nr 6455 name space simulation station number of minifigs 3 number of pieces 240 release year 1999 first again a few pics of the boxes and the instructions the main box this theme had a kinda strange seperation of the pieces the parts for the control center and the shuttle are in seperate little boxes and the others are in polybags with the models printed on them also seperate instructions for each step a general overview we got 3 lovely minifigs here from left to right the control engineer the mechanic and the astronaut the i dont know the english word for it testingthing the astronaut is being tested to hard nerves there the mechanics little car on the back an extinguisher and a radio device is attached the takeoff station for the little shuttle with the shuttle itself on it and without it tools tools tools the shuttle as standalone i think that would be fuel tanks i like this little detail and finally we have the controll room would have been better with seats but its alright a really sweet midsized set if you ask me a few juniorized parts but it fits perfectly with the set the theme itself is also great and i wish that tlg brings it back i could see stunning sets with the quality city sets have right now	positive
you just bring memorys back i never had one of the space port sets but i know that as a little boy i visited my toy store and kept on looking to the boxes on bl those sets cost too much for what ist worth today really tlc should bring this theme back space port on	positive
in the catalog images i thougt that the base was on a 1616 baseplate i have some sets of spaceport and like them but i would want real town sets in 1999 edited by lord santos 15 july 2008  1058 am	neutral
the spinning machine is a centerfuge not sure of the spelling  i remember wanting this set because my friend had the larger station with full rocket seeing this makes me want it again	positive
minibump wow id completely forgotten about this theme which is suprising since i absolutely loved this theme as a kid minus the sound n light brick which i thought was pretty big and ugly sure brings back memories of looking at those little catalogue booklets that came with the sets	positive
thank you very much for the review now i remember i got mission control when i was only 5 and built it with the help of my older sister i loved it so much i never rebuilt it but now i just have to space simulation was one i never got but looks to be a great set	neutral

update i will be merging reviews as they go idle this is now the dino attack review thread what jays not doing viking reviews nope i think christopher110 took care of those just fine instead i have brought you what is most possibly the highestanticipated set of the year  d  the t1 typhoon and i gotta say  dinos apart its actually really cool the dinos lets get the worst over with yes those are all the parts in that dino	negative
the copter this is one bigass copter the photos really dont do the size justice lower cockpit with cool computer too bad its a sticker although ill definitely leave this one on upper cockpit with cool computer see above awesome gatling gun yes even the technic beams have stickers im actually really fond of that little canister thing i can see using it elsewhere yes  thats a sticker the rope and hook i forgot to mention it before this set comes with two accessories besides the machine gun  binocs and one of those little things to slide down the rope also the thing that extends the rope turns the other side because theyre slightly asymmetrical one of my favorite stickers the door says survival equipment its on both sides definitely a keeper	positive
the base of the propeller it wobbles a bit but doesnt fall off very sturdy right side of the rear propeller and the left and better side the tail it uses construction similar to the xwings nose but on a larger scale definitely cool a very neat part of the copter the guns are constructed so that  they turn without turning the cockpit the interior is rather blase though	positive
mr legobildur on jul 24 2005 0935 pm said as unexpected as it was this was very helpful  two questions though 1 is the front green rubber missle a traditional launchable missle or does it have another firing mechanism 2 concerning the guns on the side are they fixed in one postition or does it have any functions 3 why did you decide to buy this set just curious 1 oh i overlooked that didnt i in response its an upsidedown launcher so the switch is on the underside so no no special mechanism 2 the gatling guns can be raised but not turned 3 i found it in toys r us and was after a few of the figs but after seeing the box up close and personal decided what the heck its a good break from vikings d	neutral
i really want those figsdamm you bloody jay	positive
great review jay  tks a lot  i am not that of the big fan of the copter due to its proportions  but i admit its really asome looking better as i expected od the best are those mfs  they are truly awsome  i wiil but some of the smaller sets just for the figs hehe too bad that my favorite  your second best  dont come in the smallers sets   are you going to review the other sets as well  that could be cool 	positive
sam89 on jul 25 2005 0111 pm said that looks like a really great set although i dont think id have anywhere to put it i dont think ill ever be able to get the set anyway since it doesnt come out over here sam missing your point the set should come to europe as 7298 but without guns large crate instead	neutral
does anyone have photos of the ones being released in europe id like to compare the ones here in the us to the ones in europe	neutral
no there arent any pictures yet	neutral
photos are not available but basically it is guns chains ropes crates	neutral
thats interesting news about the european release id definitely be interested to see how they modify the set  chains ropes and crates are definitely useful pieces cant wait for pictures to everyone looking for just the figures  dont skip out and get the smaller set and the tank spend the extra 20 and get the t1 its well worth it i might pick up the steel sprinter and the fire hammer myself still trying to decide if i do ill review them	positive
yeah i picked up another one i really liked the chopper lets cut straight to the chase dinos first the worst of course these things are so horrible they dont deserve more than one photo theyre rubbery one piece and the only things that remotely indicate that theyre made by lego are the holes on the bottom of their feet theyre unrealistic to an extreme unmatched by even the previously reviewed dinos in that they are waaaaaaaay too thin one is pink and theyre all grinning fig one interesting thing to note is that this one has the same torso as the ironmasked dude in the chopper not his own barearms torso pic for the sake of comparison now i dont consider this fig as good as the others because the other heads are useful for vikings and assorted castletype people but this has sunglasses all in all youll probably find it useful but i dont still great torso for special ops stuff hummer those headlights  while stickers yes all prints are again stickers although there are much less than the chopper  are great pieces i can see using them as furnace covers or stove burners the windshieldhood area not much to say about this one drivers side my question when this is brought to europe will the steering wheel switch sides  seriously though i love that little steering wheel piece more than i love taffy and im a man who enjoys his taffy left side in its entirety  and the right side view through the right side  no seat here couldve done with another fig to fill the nonexistant seat as well	positive
the weapon whatever its called this uses the same mechanism as the longboat for those that dont have either you snap the little sports stand thing which hits the missile which fires and since theres nothing holding the technic beam up to that height any more it drops down so that the next missile drops into place pretty cool if unrealistic the two on the side do not fire i think theyre mainly there for extra ammo my biggest problem with this set open bed this could have easily been remedied with a few plates interior opened the fire hammer next to the t1 they look very cool together dont they you can also see my curio shelf final score 7410 dinos 110 fig 810 but thats just me hummer 8510 parts 910 im a harsh reviewer i still think that if spacevehicles are your thing you should buy this however if youre a bigger castle fan or just like to get all sorts of lego i would still suggest buying the viking catapult before this however i do think that these are some of the coolest sets of 2005 this is something you will eventually want to get until next time bloody jay	positive
thanks bloody jay any chance you could be reviewing the other dino attack sets	neutral
mr legobildur on jul 25 2005 1011 pm said thanks bloody jay any chance you could be reviewing the other dino attack sets possibly the steel sprinter and urban avenger but i can say with finality that i will not buy the tank until i find it available for 30 or less on that note if anybody does find it for 30 or less shoot me a pm 	neutral

wow i think this is the first time im the first to have a new set at least here and review it got it 2 days ago thanks to a fast shipping from sh this time and i found time now to review it now enough of the babbling lets let the facts and pictures speak which actually turned out pretty well this time set nr 4210 name coast guard platform number of minifigs 4 number of pieces 469 release year 2008 a few shots of the box first 2 books of instructions we got here first one for the helicopter second one for the rest and the platform itself a general overview of the platform from above the 4 minifigs 3 rescue guys and one oil rig worker  the pilot seems not very happy that he has to work in the middle of nowhere at sea right beside the entry of the tower we have the diving equipment holder next the guy can jump in this little speedboat and another guy brings it down to water with the crane if somebody is rescued from the air he arrives here and is brought to the tower with the little moving platform than runs on rails down under we got a buoy and several life belts and extinguishers with the lift somebody who is rescued by the boat can be brought up i think it would been better if they would have made a mechanism there to bring it up but its okay a few floors higher the sea is being observated and watched on the ground level we have the medical stationwarmup room the helicopter as standalone all in all for me this is besides the police station the city set of this year its got great features and looks fantastic and also has many useful pieces you cant do anything wrong with buying it 1010 for me thats all for now hope you liked my review edit oh damn i forgot to write review in the topic title can a mod please add this thanks	positive
excellent review metalandi its always great to see early pictures of new sets this set really reminds me of an oil rig and could probably be easily modified as one if one wanted an alternate model the two components that i like most are the boat crane and the control room but other sections are pretty slick as well are those printed pieces in the control room or stickers im really starting to gain an appreciation for these new coast guard sets theyve come a long way over the years 575 coast guard station released 1978 i picked up the control boat  tower 7739 a few weeks ago but havent opened it yet in any case thanks for taking the time to review this set and share it over eb	positive

thanks for the great review im loving this set a lot  it looks well designed and the helicopter is awesome plus i love the new worker figure with the beard quote i agree this is a great set  one of the best of the cg line for sure way better than the boat set with the tower on the bionicle baseplate i wouldnt say that at all  true this base is bigger but the other set was well designed as well  plus the included boat is wonderful	positive

nice review this is just the crown jewel for the coast guard theme i love the layout of its platform it looks real neat to have it placed it in the midst of the deep blue sea awaiting of any emergency rescue sometimes i feel that this set can used it to merge with my aqua raiders sets i thought of using it as a land base for the raiders to dock in their stuff before submerge into the ocean ok its just a wierd idea of mine just feel that aqua raiders and coast guard can work hand in hand since they are naval expertise it seemed i cant view all the pictures somehow nevertheless i can still view some of it quite well i love the command center the amount of computer printed pieces simply make me smile with the monitor keyboard radar screen and etc the helicopter is cute too however i pity the victim that is loaded at the back it seemed a little bit too dangerous in addition this set seemed to have quite alot of stickers which can be quite discouraging i do hope to see this set soon so far i quite like the current coast guard sets	positive
i agree with both of you first i have to add that a few of the stickers were a bit annoying as it comes to put them on espacially the ones on the helicopter where you have to put them on round parts but i didnt really see this at a bad point i really can live with it second it was a very hard decision believe it or not on which new set to buy cause i got a huge 2008 setwantlist i guess itll take some time before i can get most of the other sets i want	neutral

thats a great review of a great city set thank you very much metalandi first of all i wanted to buy the 7999 cg petrol boat  tower but now i surely will buy this amazing platform instead of the 7999 if my local toy seller sells the 4210 reason 4210 is something very unusual set i think we wont get a set similar to that in the next 20 years and because of i dont like the petrol boat inside no backwalls  nearly no interior  klausdieter	positive
thanks a lot for the review brickster i never had the chance to get some classic town sets but i wish i couldve i just wonder why lego cant release sets like this anymore	neutral

paramedic unit does not seem to suit well for this sets name it should be named as clinic outpatient treatment family doctor and etc from what i understand parmedic unit is a standalone unit that is on standby 247 ready for any emergency rescue in lego town ambulance with a group of paramedics will be ideal for this kind of situation i love female doctors especially with that lovely hairpiece the cruiser is a neat 4studs wide design just love these small car designs back then i wonder what can be used at the back of its boot the clinic is neat maybe we can send holodoc for some medical audit to make sure that this clinic is up to standard what surprised me the most is the neat little eye chart you dont see such details in any regular lego set the red and white color combination for the building works well for me most of the hospital buildings and vehicles always revolved in red and white i gave this a 4 thanks you so much brickster	positive
thebrickster on jul 19 2008 0230 am said i just cant believe someone would rate this set a 1 it appears to be a trend among these classic reviews never with a comment of why maybe a tfol it is our destiny to show them that lego existed before 1997 and was imho way better than today we need more classic reviews i hope i can continue with technic sets	neutral
people giving this 1 g id give it a 4 id give it a 3 but added a point out of nostalgia i think its a nice town set from the old days the only problem i always had is the lack of an ambulance and we got a female doctor 	neutral
brickster strikes again with another awesome review ah one of the few hospital related kits lego made wasnt this the first hospital with modern minifigs because i seem to remember seeing an even older hospital online that had the armless faceless figs regardless this would be great as a little doctors office in someones town layout  although the vehicle is a little silly and that eye chart sticker has to be the coolest decal ever quote maybe a tfol well it sure isnt me i personally love older kits even though im only a teen i like a lot of the newer sets a bit more than some of the classic stuff but i have always agreed that the 70s and 80s were an extremely high point in legos time even though i dont really own any kits from the period edited by grevious 19 july 2008  0505 pm	positive

hello all eurobricks members and town lovers today i will be doing up a review on hook  haul wrecker this name is quite wierd to me i will prefer to call it the regular tow truck this is one of the service and repair vehicle that are always ready 247 on standby for any emergency towing in our towns name hook  haul wrecker theme lego system  town year 1989 pieces 44 minifigs 1 price usd600 an image of a 6660 hook  haul wrecker let the towing begins hook  haul wrecker is the typical 4studs wide vehicle that takes care of broken vehicles that is left stranded on the roads this tow truck is pretty useful as you can see current city sets hardly have any tow trucks available to tow new cars design this tow truck is catered for 4studs vehicles for classic town can you imagine yourself this truck towing a speed racer car i think it looks really out of proportion in addition the minifig which is included in this set has the regular truck print on its torso i am very sure they must be a fan club for trucks otherwise they should really need a change of clothes nevertheless in my honest opnion i really love this torso very much somehow it makes them look tough even though their face looks very friendly side view this vehicle has a combination of two primary colors which is white and red this color combination looks very good you cannot mistook it for an ambulance since they made use of this two colors too in most emergency vehicles this is my guess i supposed the designer will have tow truck concept as a form of emergency and considered red and white as its combinations this vehicle setup has the typical sunscreen on the top of the vehicle frame however this baby has more unique features installed in it these are the source of its brutal strength allterrain vehicle this tow truck equipped with the best wheels in fact these wheels offer suspension on the roads even when its travelling uphill the truck will move accordingly with its tyres when you act pressure on the top of the vehicle it will either be shifted leftwards or rightwards closeup of these unique tyres take a careful look these wheels have springs installed in it that is the magic of these vehicle and is defintely suited to run on any rough roads with least problems if any eb members know which other vehicles has this unique features please highlight it to me because if i remembered correctly i only remember seeing this pair of tyres in this great set he is ready for some serious towing the driver had finished hook up the pizza van on its back its pretty simple you just have to lift the back of the vehicle and placed it onto the hook presto the van is ready to go this vehicle provides so much fun you can really tow any 4studs vehicle in your town and here we go to the service station poor pizza guy summary review playability 1010 superb fun you will love to use this truck and tow any vehicles design 9510 excellent design especially with the use of the suspension tyres price 910 an inexpensive set based on the 1989 pricing this set is made up of less than 100 pieces overall 9510 every town must need a tow truck if a vehicle breaks down whom will be ready to tow i gave it a 5 based on my review score card what about yours hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelfwhen moderated	neutral

another great review whitefang this is a wonderful 80s vehicle  and i think it might be one of the first  if not the first  that had the spring suspension system i know of at least one other set that had that the biggest extreme team set from 1998 had a vehicle with those pieces quote this tow truck is pretty useful as you can see current city sets hardly have any tow trucks available to tow new cars design this tow truck is catered for 4studs vehicles for classic town can you imagine yourself this truck towing a speed racer car i think it looks really out of proportion firstly speed racer cars are out of scale even with city vehicles also i have hope that in the next few years we will get more octan sets to go with the wonderful gas station  and i suspect that a 6wide tow truck will be at the top of the list it wouldnt be a hard set to make and i bet it would sell well edited by grevious 19 july 2008  0531 pm	positive

exxon gas station set  6375 year released 1980 piece count 254 minifigs 3 list price approx 20 one of the gems of my sets from 1980 has to be the exxon gas station it has very nice colors lots of great details and a high level of playability starting with the instructions the backside with a great picture of the complete set the set includes three minifigs including two gas station attendants and my favorite the urban cowboy one of the best things about this set is that it includes not one but two very detailed 4stud wide vehicles heres a picture of the red one which is a twoseater the car has two working doors a hood that opens and a little holed brick on the other side for pretending to fill er up heres another image at an angle isnt she a nice set of wheels heres the yellow car i always liked this one better perhaps it was the color with the black pieces in the back although it is a oneseater the set includes four fuel pumps that are numbered with decals and included a string as the hose heres a little accessory rack for oil and tools and another rack for tires the set had a nice exxon logo on three 1x6 bricks a large jack allows the cars to be lifted high into the air for tire and under engine repairs i love the office with its large 5x6 window inside is a chair and desk and the entire set happy motoring in legoland	positive
skipper 24 on jul 19 2008 0725 am said cool set i really loved the classic town sets this set has lots of detail great reveiw do you know what is exxon thanks skipper exxon is a big fuel company here in the us theres a lot of exxon gas stations throughout the country	positive
i think we only got shell stations in europe in the 80s never got this one but it looks like a typical lego gas station  once again i just dont know how you were able to keep stickers and prints in such a great condition i am sooooo jealous the tires of the cars are a problem though it was difficult and painful to put them off the wheel and back on later the black hat g i would have looooooved to have that when i was a boy	negative

brickster you need your own sticky review section i love looking at all of these old sets as i have said before you take me back to a much simpler time thank you and on to the set i love this gas station lego really needs to look to its past on some of these sets for the time the level of detail is great i wish i still had this one in one piece as well	positive
brickster once again this is another excellent gas station awaiting to be in the limelight i dont understand why i always loved these classic gas station such as shell exxon and octan they just look so lovely no city or town could ever survive without these important key installations around to pump gaspetroleum for all vehicles that depend it for fuel consumption as always all gas station will always inculde a road plate and i am glad i am still seeing roads included in such sets such as the recent 7993 service station however town plans gas station did not include a baseplate though nevertheless let me continue with this review 3 lovely minifigs included in this set its not common to see exxon torsos these days i just love that lady staff very much especially with its classic hairdo 4studs car just simply rocks with such fabulous simple design furthermore it gave you 2 cars instead of one what more can you ask you dont see tlg giving more cars in recent sets these days what surprise me about this cars is the ability of opening the front engine column i remembered vividly that only trucks or massive vehicles does have this playing feature nevertheless its an excellent addition for a 1980 gas station set this is a perfect set even when its going to fit into my current town buildings i am sure it wont have a hard time to match with the rest of the facade i can use this gas station and stationed it near the country side this set is so hard to resist with such elegant design of its fuel pump there are a total of 4 pumping stations the vehicles wont be fighting against each other for slots then the reparing area is very nice it will be even better if it include a shelter on top of it the office is simple and nice i had never expect an office to exist in gas station most of the time there are groceries stores for the consumers to get off buy off some stores and load it in the car no major complains from me i am not trying to be selection bias i had demostrated key points which is good enough to justify my score and i gave it a 5 outstanding classic gas station set	positive
again great topicpoll thebrickster i gave this set a 3 which is on the one hand negative is that its really oldfashioned for today  which is on the other hand positive is that it includes very nice and authentic details like e g doors in the cars  which is imo for that time a feat  klausdieter	neutral
okay guys i have built the set so lets review set name 7649 mt201 ultra drill walker price 6999 pieces 759 bought from tor r us in michigan us the box first we have the front it shows the set its functuns and the limited edition sign the box is huge about the size of the dino attack chopper set or the mars mission base nowadays most set that are 5000 or more have a flap displaying the sets functions opening theflap on this box reveals a gigantic picture of the set and the back the bags numbered next the manuals they have piece call outs page numbers etc there are 2 manuals with this set sticker sheets they actually arent all that bad random manual image build first we open bag 1 this will build the alien craft and the minifigures now here we have some interesting parts a green spine from exoforce and a black rim for the set container stacker next we start the build on the alien craft it is pretty sturbdy but has no cockpit for the alien the alien stickers are really cool they are rainbowish and has a silver back next come the build on the wings and the finished craft it is pretty good and has a nice sleek design however i think i will use the large ship for the commander out this year to fight the driller instead next is bag 2 which builds the rover and astro ship first is the ship it starts off with doctor infernos colors it builds up very nice and the detail is absolutley amazing next the roof is built it has some speed racer slopes the hinge piee now has a hole through it sorry for the blurry pic more is added then comes the bottom piece the detail is very nice and the hinge piece has a use later on then you build the crates each one holds two crystals added to the ship also a pic of the finished ship here we start the rover it sports anice detail the orange studs get coveded by the grill to look more like an engine the detail in this thing is pretty good it has a gun and shovel here is how it fits into the ship it slides in and is secured thanks to the hinge okay so next we open the number 3 bag which builds the body here are some interesting pieces then we start the build it begins nice and study i just love these stickers with the bulldogs on them more of the build with the stickers added next we add in the front part the detail is again outstanding with the turntable added it can move down as well the next step is to build the water tank it utilizes the bionicle boostersbig white things and added to the walker then we build that drill it uses a lot of rims and such with the gears added the front part uses a lot of those new droideka 3prong things and bionicle eyes the drill can spin thanks to the gears and added to the vehical next is the cockpit it has a nice space for the astros bckpack added the final stage is the legs thank god they arent like striking venoms they are all the same however see those two rubber parts those keep it in place when on surfaces like glass next come the large part of the legs these are similar to the assault tigers legs the final result is very sturdy thanks too notice the amazing classic space sticker so we finally come down to this the final result is amazing it is sturdy and has great detail it is very realistic and when the ship is removed the drill goes down and the turret is aimed up hope you all enjoyed the review	positive

i thoroughly enjoyed your review metalandi thank you especially for taking photos of all the contraptions and detailing exactly how they work as a member of classiccastle the census always seemed to be that fright knights were a class 410 or 610 but as sandy stated above it is one of the closest you can get to an evil faction by todays standards the contraptions seen here are much much more sophisticated and well thought out and are definitely missing in 2007s kings castle siege i enjoy the design of this castle much more even if the towers are taller simply because the design in the kings castle siege left builders with an empty space right in the courtyard without even a base plate and its nearly impossible to get your hands in and play in the enclosed space why would anyone unless youre simply posing figs and even that was difficult this castle instead had a variety of trap doors and surprises so despite the varied colors used here its not that hard to realize that the designers for this castle really took time to think things out and tried to make the castle enjoyable for the children that will play with it whereas our 2007 castle was strictly built to give kids the impression of an enormous magnificant castle with little to nothing inside its like comparing beauty 2007 to brains this castle edited by legobear 20 july 2008  0132 am	positive

i read this review not long after you posted it but im not sure why i didnt comment if dragonator is the one to post everytime he sees a dragon related topic i would be the one to post if i see a fright knights topic fright knights is one of my favourite lego themes and this review is really good i got both of the castles in the theme and loved them and your review presents basil the batlords castle well i too thought it was a bit weird that there is a green base when it could be grey but i guess its a useful piece to use in other things fright knights on	positive

good review  the photo from above shows off the scale of the castle much better than the box photo i was one of those who always thought this set looked lame ever since first seeing it in the catalogue a couple of my siblings had smaller bat lordfright knight sets and enjoyed the accessories and style of the minifigs etc so last year having not only ended my dark ages but done so for some of the rest of my family i got this set off ebay for my sister for christmas i of course had to build it to make sure all parts were there before leaving ebay feedback and ending the transaction first impressions were of how much brick there was to the set as well as really useful large structural elements and to be honest while perhaps a bit childish theres no doubt the style of the minifigs is kinda cute and useful for customs it was really enjoyable building this set and the scale is impressive when built empty spaces notwithstanding but hey lego has always had buildings with no back etc  just use your imagination and enjoy the access to playspace offered the traps etc are neat and more like the kind of action features modern sets come with i for one am in favour of these for kids they are fun and i think for builders they give ideas cause they are often done with minimal parts or impact on the set design anyways needless to say my sister loved the set indeed shes currently rebuilding it for the second time if i see it as cheap again i will pick up one for myself i got the first one at €30 incl postage i believe	positive
i got a couple of the small sets from this line when it came out recently i acquired several more from bricklink because i just really love the way they look this theme really had good intentions but the execution was flawed i hope one day lego returns to a darker tone but maybe next time it could be more castlevania inspired that would really turn some heads plus vampires and gothic aesthetics are really popular now it will probably have run its course by the time lego would be able to develop a theme around them though	negative
fire station set  6382 year released 19801981 piece count 368 minifigs 4 list price approx 20 legos third fire station was this little gem 6382 the set offered new design elements not previously offered in previous sets what really stands out for me is 1x3 car doors and torsos with printed designs a decal was used for the large sign on the building and the 1 on the hood of one of the vehicles i think this was also the first set to offer the sliding garage mechanism a feature that added a great amount of realism and playability the set also included two blue doors and the new fire hose with preconnected faucetspicket getting on to the pictures i saved the cover of the box for this set but lost the instructions over the years i was able to download some instructions from the web heres a shot of the box cover and the back of the box the set includes four figs three of which are fireman and a lady who can serve as a dispatcher as mentioned above the torsos are printed on my favorite of the two vehicles included i love the design of fire engine 1 i always loved the fire hoses included in this set no string to have to tie or freyed ends engine 2 is this much larger engine with ladder i like how it contains an oxygen tank and fire axe on the other side of the engine are two shutter doors that reveal the hose and ladder controls these are stickers the ladder is much wider than previous lego ladders and extends a good length i like the baseplate of this set which has the numbers one and two marking each garage the building is simple but has a nice design i love the sliding garage doors note notice the two windows of the 2nd floor the actual set should have blinds on these windows ive lost one of the stickered windows so placed the single blinded window on the 1st floor each of the two sides of the garages are the same heres a shot of the right side on the first floor is the dispatch area and a classic blue space computer the 2nd floor has a bed and a chair heres a shot of the entire backside and lastly a shot of the entire station this set is one of my favorite fire stations that offers a great amount of playability hope you enjoyed the review	positive
this is a great set and a great review  thanks for doing these i remember my brother getting this set i got the police station 6384 on the same day truly classic sets  its a shame that i dont have them anymore although i do have the two immediate descendants of the sets cheers rog	positive
lovely i cant stop making comparisons between this fire station and last years which is also very well detailed with great features and awesome playability the concept design of the second one its very much like the one reviewed here this is good as tlg is taking back those great values to make the new excellent sets we all are enjoying by now	positive

great review i love tis set too the best firestation ever made by lego mainly because the 80s sets are the favourite with me only i miss a helicopterplatvorm well i made a little modification	positive
i am a proud owner of this set this is one of the best fire stations ever what amazes me is what the designers made with only 368 pieces you get a very nice looking building in good size a good baseplate 2 cars 4 minifigs accessories and great alternative ideas in the back of the box like the fire boat or helicopter this is a great example of lego design	positive

i must agree great fire station i love the fact that in the classic sets you were given a base plate and some other great ideas i do miss the addition of base plates and alternate building ideas the only newer set i have seen with any alternate build photos is the 7239 fire engine i miss back when	positive

a truly great set i always loved the mobile crane and was gobsmacked when this popped up using some of the great features from the crane but also making it an emergency vehicle too great classic firemen and  in your version  a suspiciously blue fire extinguisher great review of a great set  just a pity i no longer have it so many sets i used to have got lost during the period at the end of my childhood before i rescued what was left from my dads house once i realised what i had left behind hindsight is a great thing cheers again rog	positive

nice review whitefang with lots of photos  exactly as a good review should be as for the set  i own it and its a very good one the fire squad vehicle is a nice addition to my other fire dept vehicles it offers very good playability and this ladder is so long you can have so much fun with it	neutral
thats a great reviewpoll whitefang i gave this set a 5 its simply  the only thing which i miss are the respirators for the firemen since they already own air tanks but otherwise this set is brilliant i like it much more than the new one from 2007 since its not that big and juniorized klausdieter	positive
thanks for the review this set was outstanding for its time with all the features and detail the extending basket is just wonderful however i honestly wouldnt consider it the best firetruck ever i actually like the one from 2005 even better  becasue like most of the city vehicles it adds the needed bulk big engines like fire trucks need many of the older kits while awesome were honestly a little too skinny imo	positive

i have a question what is the door above the gun for pic	neutral
this sounds very similar to the first one im glad im saving this one till later in my purchasing cycle all the sw walkers have a skeletal fram with almost nothing inside its very disappointing but i guess filling them in would up the piece count considerably does this beast have any good handholds for picking it up i seem to recall a handle or something coming out of the top in the prerelease pics	negative
so basically you cited as faults what everybody had been complaining about since the first information of the set arrived skeletal interior and lack of clones although i didnt realize it didnt have numbered backs that really is just ridiculous lego finally comes up with a very intelligent solution to the frustration seen when building large sets but then they neglect to implement it wtf lame still this may be the only clone wars set i buy besides the exclusives the exterior which imo is the only part that matters looks so fantastic i dont care about clones i have enough of those already and at 90 its still a better buy than the rgs the torrent is cool but not as cool as the fighter tank or dgs imo awesome inconstruction pics	positive
just picked this set up and just took a break from building to go to football practice i have just finished building all of the legs and so far it looks like it is going to be a great set i would have like it if more clones were included but whatever i find it interesting how many clone accessories they give you i dont like it only because i cant decide what i want to use i find it interesting that at lease 2 people are missing pieces i have had multiple times where i thought i was missing pieces only to find that they were in the bag somewhere other than the fact that there is a lack of minifigures i love this set and cant wait to finish it later tonight edited by swman 04 august 2008  0833 pm	positive
i just got this set sunday and its so huge that i cant put it anywhere it is pretty sturdy and heavy thats where the handle comes in im pissed that you only get 2 clones rex has to fight on the ground while you need more clones to man the gunscockpit the legs were the most annoying and time consuming part of the build and yea i agree that if tlg had made numbered bags it would have taken only 2 hours rather than 4 edited by ih master 13uilder17 14 october 2008  1138 pm	negative
i bought this a few weeks ago and absolutely loved making it its amazing how the paneling comes together to make such a tight fit but can easily open up the legs could have been a bit more poseable and the guns dont launch easily unless you push hard and fast id like the firing mechanism to launch more smoothly but it looks absolutely amazing about price it was ¥13000 where i am but im used to lego being expensive in japan so it was good value	positive

7676 republic attack gunship number of pieces 1034 number of minifigs 5 price 11999 usd brickset hey everyone i just got the rgs yesterday at tru after i came home from camp i saw all of the topics that i missed and noticed a minireview and a review with one pic so i thought id make a huge shiny new review that has lots of pictures and all of the requirements of kimts index note i did not apply any stickers to it as a personal liking so lets start by looking at the box a shiny clean and futuristic box quite different from the other star wars box designs before this there was so much clone wars merchandise with this font and design in the huge display at the front of my local toys r us store and not just lego it so beautiful with the white and sky blue anyways for some reason the boxes of the new clone wars sets seemed more shiny than usual maybe its because they were just shipped but once you pick up the boxes they will feel really good in your hands despite the fact that only about half of the space in the boxes are used the back of the box the back shows all of the main features of the set plus pictures of the three other clone wars sets meant to be released alongside this one although i did spot the twilight and homing spider droid which were supposed to be released in september or october so on to the gunship built straight from the bags it took me about 4 12 hours with breaks it has an overall great design but somewhat fragile especially when building it the cockpits always fall apart when opened as well as the bubbles on the wings which i will get into more later the color scheme is very well done you can always find the piece youre looking for thanks to the color diversity red dark red lime green ooh blue black tan light bley dark grey yellow and white also split down the middle vertically the ship is almost all symmetrical front side now lets start with the many features that this set is hiding the front has lots of lime green a rare color but more importantly a rotating gun is found on each side they rotate in a pretty wide range although fragile cockpits there are two main cockpits right next to each other not very detailed and are the same and for some reason the whole cockpit element flips up to reveal nothing just the skeleton of the ship probe droid storage above the cockpit lies a plate that can be flipped up to reveal a storage area that holds two of these probe droids at least thats what i think they are hull in this pic two features are hidden mobile command center the first of the two is a mobile command center but essentially just a hover chair it is found by flipping up the two panels on either side of the hull bacta tank the second is the bacta tank found by just sliding it out of the storage area behind the mcc one half of the tank opens so a minifigure can go inside and heal hisher wounds obtained in battle cargo hold now this is probably the main feature for this set the two sliding doors two on each side slide open thanks to a clever technic mechanism not much in here just a gun holder and a place where the passengers wait to be dropped off in battle speeder bike i guess you guys saw it the speeder bike it is found by opening the rear flap the bike is very cleverly designed by using a brown trike body its only a few centimeters shorter than the bike found in the clone battle pack rear gun just a gun similar to the front ones engines huge engines or are they cannons that are really fun to build they really give that cartoon feel to this set missiles in between the engines are two sets of four flickfire missiles bubble cockpits there is one bubble cockpit on each wing that supposedly control the turrets at the front very fragile storage containers two storage containers on each side hold the clone accessories but i wouldnt recommend putting them in there because the antennae can fall out or you might forget about them sticker sheet the dreaded sticker sheet dss has all of the stickers you need for this set unfortunately mine was crunched up i dont like stickers much anyways but i might still apply some note the republic symbol stickers why couldnt tlg just use that printed piece from a few years back also you get to choose between a birdrat thing or a sleeping twielk as your hull decal what theyre for i dont know looks like the movie or show will explain it though minifigs finally the five minifigs of this set they are all great figs including commander cody amazing especially with the gear the orange is nice but i thought he was yellow clone trooper again amazing the gear is great and the new helmet and torso are great all of the clones in the clone wars line have the same heads also you can see the flesh beneath the helmet asaaj ventress not so happy about this one the torso and dark blue legs are cool but the dress is pretty ugly the head is alright but could do without the cartoony face yeah i know its from a cartoon also has purple markings on back of head obiwan kenobi pretty cool besides the face cool hair and torso though plo koon beautiful the true gem of this set in my opinion the head is the same material as kit fistos and the tosro is awesome good for making a custom kiadi mundi well thats about it here is the final verdict build 810 very fun and easy should take the seasoned builder about 4 hours somewhat fragile playability 9510 lots of fun features although some can break easily swooshability 310 i wouldnt recommend flying it around much as you can barely pick it up safely but with two hands gripping the bottom firmly it can be moved around but not spun or swooshed etc minifigs 810 all very great figs especially plo koon but could have included more clone troopers design 7510 some excellent ideas included in here although some spots are very fragile price 710 should have been only 100 usd if not for the new molds plus at tru it was 130 usd overall score 8510 a great set to have for your star wars clone wars collection with some flaws save up for this one so how did you like my review your feedback is much appreciated jimbutcher out edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0306 am

swman on jul 29 2008 1033 pm said i really like the new gunship different enough from the old one to be better but similar enough that they dont look totally weird together really like the new minifigs didnt think i would like the new clone troopers at all the accessories are fine i would never use them on the regular clones but to each their own everything is perfect except the rear of troop cabin  seems so flimsy with only 2 2x1 white brick holding everything together 	positive

hey everyone my wife took me to legoland for my birthday just last week we had a fantastic time and it gave me the chance to pick up some of the new castle sets and battlepacks i was really impressed by the sets i bought and decided to do my first review let battle commence set name tower raid set number 7037 price gbp £1999 pieces 364 the models heres a shot of the complete set the set is made up of two models the crown knights tower and the orcs siege tower lets start with the crown knights tower a knight readies himself for battle my favourite model from the set the wicked orcs siege tower please note that for the purposes of display i mounted the orcs banner onto a small cone set on the top platform of the siege tower this doesnt come with the set but saves any orcs having to hold onto it all he time there are other areas it can be placed without using extra parts features both models look great and have excellent features the set as a whole has great playability and seems to have been concieved with a storyline the crown knights have a captured orc within the walls of their tower so the orc army has been sent out to recover him or are they merely after the gold the knights keep horded away the orcs siege tower has a powerful ram  springloaded by the simple arrangement of an elastic band  so pulling it back sends it flying out the front knocking down the wall on the side of the knights tower and releasing the captive orc the floor panels inside the prison are laid over a lip on the inside of the collapsible wall so fall in when theyre not supported theres a string at the rear for extending the boarding ramp and letting a fearsome orc warrior charge across flickfire action the battle heats up as the orcs close in the minifigures the crown knights i really like the crown knights theyre metallic helmets look great and they come with nice accessories the archer has a double printed head with a frightened look on the other side too im not surprised id be frightened when staring over the ramparts at these the orcs these guys really do look the part worthy advesaries to the crown knights the details are superb the printed elements weapons and helmets all set the orcs aside on the battlefield the set comes with a great new molded armour neckpiece too the mighty orc leader looks wicked in his full battlegear overview theres so much to this set its hard not to be impressed the orcs siege engine is a thing of beauty or terror and would look great on any battlefield the crown knights tower although basic looks good and has great playability im a big fan of the new castle knights and fantasy minifigures and the inclusion of five of them is just enough for this set and as a booster to any army at £1999 in the uk this set is well worth the money for content and quality id highly recommmend this set as a musthave purchase for anyone a final shot of the siege tower with a host of orcs ready for battle i hope you enjoyed my review ill be posting my next one for 7040 dwarves mine defender soon	positive
hey good review and good photos i also got this set just recently and i wasnt very enthusiastic about it at the beginning but after i built it i could appreciate it the siege engine is very nice but my complaint has do with the proportions of the knights tower in respect to the trolls machine  its a bit smaller and less bulkier that complaint has to go with some other sets too for example the troll warship is really humongous  it feels like it can load the evil wizards tower and sail off other than that  a good set i like it 45 from me	positive
very nice review pedro you beat me to it there was a review done about january but i wanted to have a go just havent opened the box yet great pics and well demonstrated action elements too i rate this as one of the coolest castle sets just for its playability and 5 figures this will def add to my orc army and i may purchase more of this set if they dont release a orc bp keep up the good work	positive

thanks for the review from this set i prefer the crown knights tower  its a very goodlooking structure	positive
pedro for your first review you have amaze me with your photo session and the strucutre of your review i am very impressed by your high quality pictures you have done an excellent job i love the tower raid very much as it offers high playability with the wall and flooring falling down when the ram hits the wall its quite interesting to play with the mechanism of the ram is very fun to play with as well i will try and pull back and released it to knock a row of soldiers this is one of my favourite sets in castle 2008 well done	positive
whitefang on jul 30 2008 1256 am said pedro for your first review you have amaze me with your photo session and the strucutre of your review i am very impressed by your high quality pictures you have done an excellent job i completely agree this is an amazing review  bits of humor great photography and detailed descriptionsphotos based upon this review ive placed an order for this set along with some convincing from amazons 20 sale  the only drawbacks in this set that i can see concerns the tower with it being 1 small compared to the seige tower and 2 missing a few walls however this is also the joy of lego as one can simply purchase a few bricks and build their own walls andor expand the towers size or even attach it to a castle of course this increases the price of the set but considering how cheap bricks are on bricklink tower raid is still a very good value i hope you continue doing reviews pedro	positive
th set was fantastic becuase it was cheap and supplied a very good amount of pecies and had rather good minifigures	positive
name jungle duel set ref 7624 number of minifigs 3 number of pieces 90 price 900 a basic review of 7624 my apologies for the blurry and grainy pictures my camera is acting up  the build is nothing speicial on to the figs indiana jones mutt williams and irina spalkoi nice array of minifigs although i think they should have included a russian soldier or two if you look to the right on mutts jacket it has his name in script the tent is great aside from the fact that the fabric bends easily a nice amount of speicial pieces the weapons rack is pretty nifty so is the table when you swap the white piece with a black one overall it is a very nice set the 1000 price tag isnt so bad either thanks for reading playability1010 price810 figs810 build510 overall rating810 i recommend this set to all indiana jones and lego fans edited by wulf 29 july 2008  0250 pm	positive

hmm a tougie i really like the world city one yet the dino one is a better deal ill vote for the dino because i regretably dont even have the world city one	positive
the coast guard quad because i live in the netherlands and we dont have the dino attack theme we have dino 2010 which have a diffrent quad so i would like to chose the dino attack one but as i dont one him goast guard though but i also dont have the coast guard one but i like him but i also dont have the coast quard one as well greets theforce edited by theforce 01 august 2008  1118 pm	positive
 that was a weird race anyway i love the look of both sets but ill have to go for the dino attack quad for a couple of reasons it is postapoc which i love features tan and dark red colours which are far more useful than yellow you get more bang for your buck with the dino set you get a little dino sure you can hate it but better than not having one right and the fig has much more useful pieces and a better face thanks for the face off thebrickster batbrick away	positive
i like the coast guard one but dinos eat coast guard people so dinos ftw and i think the dino bike would fit in with my collection pretty well	positive
i like the dino thingy because of the pieces and the dino is a lot of fun on its own i know thats akward	positive
the rancor on aug 2 2008 0939 am said i wish i had that but ill have to make do with the much less violent european version dino 2010 not attack heres a comaprison european version usa etc version theres a subtle difference but i prefer the us one i did not know that europe had a different quad or at least one without the bazooka interesting that the gun was removed from the european sets or added to the us sets i sort of like the chain i also notice a big difference in the boxart destroyed city to prehistoric volcano i wonder if the story was different as well thanks for sharing a good picture  well it does look like the dino quad has the upper hand almost double the votes	positive
ooooooh this is a very hard choicei like this new coast guard theme but i loved dino attackthe dino attack set has a weird looking gunbut imo the coast guard set lookscleaner if you get what i meanthe little dinolizard thing is practically worthless thats why i have a bin full of those little guysi want to keep liking dino attack i just cantso i know your like just get to the point already so i guess i have to go with coast guard thebrickster on aug 3 2008 0941 am said i did not know that europe had a different quad or at least one without the bazooka interesting that the gun was removed from the european sets or added to the us sets i sort of like the chain i also notice a big difference in the boxart destroyed city to prehistoric volcano i wonder if the story was different as well thanks for sharing a good picture  well it does look like the dino quad has the upper hand almost double the votes wow i would have so much wanted the european one more than the us one i mean that bazooka or as they called it a sonic screamer looks very silly	positive
price 569 kr minifigs 2 pieces 592 stickers 9 my sticker sheet wasn’t curled up overview before i start i will apologize for the bad quality of the pictures it is getting dark here right now so some of the pictures are a bit dark 1 minifigs the set comes with two of the new clone wars clone troopers which in my opinion are pretty cool it also comes with two short blasters and a bag of clone accessories figs with helmets figs without helmets 2 the tank this thing is huge 25cm long and 22cm wide and far oversized in my opinion but looks great nonetheless i very much like the white and dark red color scheme mixed with a bit of lime green even though there is no lime green bricks   left side right side back side both of the wings contain a hidden compartment to store the blasters and a part that rotates to reveal three flickfire missiles the front opens up as well to reveal the engine the side guns and the gun on the top rotate inside the cockpit is space for two figs one seated in front of two computer screens and one placed in a moveable seat which moves up and down allowing the fig to pop up the top hatch and staying hidden while the hatch is closed this function is triggered by opening the backdoor hidden compartment and missiles engine top hatch openclosed interior 3 rating build 910 not much to say here minifigs 710 an extra fig or two would have been great eventually a jedi or a commando design 810 this only looses a couple of points for being oversized but it’s a great looking model parts 1010 at 592 parts this is one of the cw sets with the best partsprice ratio price 810 sure this thing is great but i think its overpriced at 569 kr approx 120 when build it feels more like a 450 kr set final verdict 910 despite some flaws this thing is definitely recommended and it looks great on your shelf too 	positive
dovchenko on aug 1 2008 0747 pm said finally a review of this thanks 120 bucks this tank looks tiny and though its amazingly detailed it should have been smaller and only 4050 bucks at most it just doesnt play that big a part man good pieces and mechanisms but no ones going to both buying a 120 buck tank no offence not unless it its the atte 120 is the price here in denmark it will most likely be the same price as the v19 torrent everywhere else so you dont have to worry about that	neutral

ill probably get this in hong kong where lego is cheap next time i go there to visit my relatives also pretty nice review a few more pics couldnt hurt also are there just two of the same white control computers for the controls thats what it looks like in the instructions edited by skipper 24 01 august 2008  0841 pm	positive
thanks for the review christian i was hoping for one soon  this set really looks good but as you said rather big the figs are good and i agree that kiadi mundi should be included i like the hidden compartments for the blasters and missiles and the cockpit is really cool considering it seats two i thought only one i will surely pick this up sometime	positive
deinonychus on aug 1 2008 0806 pm said one question do the top panels on the rotating rocket assembly mounted in the skids pop off regularly when you flip them back and forth the ones on the version i built from the instructions posted online seem to eject with the slightest provocation they do fall off from time to time but not as easily as you describe skipper 24 on aug 1 2008 0813 pm said ill probably get this in hong kong where lego is cheap next time i go there to visit my relatives also pretty nice review a few more pics couldnt hurt also are there just two of the same white control computers for the controls thats what it looks like in the instructions yes its two identical white slopes decorated with computer screens	neutral

christian thanks for this outstanding review i have been waiting for this moment for someone to do up an excellent review like this republic fighter tank is my 2nd favourite set in my clone wars list the 2 clone troopers could be easily add up to your rgs since it offer only more trooper however i felt that this set is quite overpriced in fact all clone war sets are very expensive the fighter tank has a very great color combination of red and white to represent the republic the wheels below is the most impressive feature which enable the hovering feel the hatch is a neat feature as well however i noticed there is a rubber band within the control panel may i know what is it for i really enjoy viewing this review you had given the insight which will eventually determined whether to get it any sooner or later pr0visorak on aug 2 2008 0535 pm said this set costs a s100 in singaporei went to hng kong too see lego and the shops there are more expensive by a few dollarshoweveri went to australia before and everything there is the same price but when there is a sale it becomes very cheap hello pr0visorak you are from singapore as well welcome to eurobricks i hope you will do an introduction to the rest of the members in this forum in singapore it cost sgd10000 in fact that was the promotional price therefore there is no further discount for it	positive
i personally think this is a great set but a little pricey i wish it was available in the us though	positive

4478 geonosian fighter review parts169 figs4 price1500 i think here is a review of the amazing geonosian fighter set it was my first ever star wars lego set here gos 1 manual not much here although its an old style manual cover random shot back 2 general set and minifigs a pic of the entire set it has 2 reddish tan battle droids geo pilot geo soldier geo star fighter and geo turret the 4 figs the droids come with backpacks geo soldier i prefer this gun give him a cane to become poggle the lesser the geo leader detailed legs are always nice the bodies are a little fat for geonosians i guess but nice printing on them the head the wings 1 2 3 voila all done 3 the star fighter it has a landing gear type thing the detail on those plates the pilot in the cockpit cockpit with canopy 1 of 2 ball joint things this is the engine 2nd ball joint which is the front gun 4 the turret the turret by itself turret with the soldier a printed round plate 5 overall build 710 a little repetitive but enjoyable minifigs 910 4 thats pretty good for a set this size design 610 the fighter dosent really look right nor does the turret but they are both strong parts 810 lots of interesting parts and comes with two of the ball joint things as well the minifig parts being good price 1010 cheap for the uk considering the amount of minifigs and parts playability 510 not much but you can have mini battles with the turret and starfighter overall 810 i gave it 8 because of the design which was not accurate and the low number of parts thanks for reading and hope you liked it as much as i did  edited by kimt 04 august 2008  1142 am indexed	positive
good review i would get this set but sadly they dont have it anymore i wish they did to get those sweet figs the battle droid colors are sweet the only set with geonosians	neutral
nice review sadly my dark ages came right before this set was released	neutral
thanks for the review i love these affordable little sets not so affordable now because of the cool figs but im going to have a look on ebay and bricklink right now just in case an army of tan red droids would look great maybe well see some if geonosia appears in the new seires somehow unlikely since the confederacy was defeated at the battle of geonosis i wish i could have bought this set when it came out but id just left university so i was super skint and had to miss all the epii sets now they all cost loads even in used condition at least now there has been a redesign of the gunship and atte from the clone wars series that i can buy	neutral
vbbn the pics were 12 mega pixles which is quite a lot i think although i had to scale them down to 800x600 i used to dream that tlg would bring out these sets of the geonosis arena and you could join them together to make a massive arena but i doubt they would ever do that also look out for my forth coming reviews of 4500 snow speeder some tie fighter with a lul dv and gg wheel bike chase i have taken all the pics all i need to do is upload them also i would review the jango fetts slave 1 but i have customized it so much i dont really want to revert it back to its original state edited by skipper 24 02 august 2008  0718 pm	neutral

i always thought this looked liek a cool set with lots of nice and sadly unique pieces unfortunately the only attack of the clones sets i got were the jedi starfighter and yoda vs dooku amazing sets but i would love to have owned them all id never really looked into this set very much so thanks for the review	positive

jifel on aug 3 2008 0418 pm said good review i really liked the detailed geonosians and i hope theyre in a later set so i can get more knowing lego theyll release a huge arena playset with a few geos and sand red droids so people will buy the set just for them jifel that would be a great release but i doubt it kimt	negative
i am fairly confident that something involoving geonosis will be released in 2010 but any way i had this set  one of my first ones but i droped the ship and it blew up i found all the pieces but in never rebuilt the ship although i still have the figs ant the canon overall this set was above average in my opinion great review	positive
7263 tie fighter review parts 159 figs 2 price £2000 not sure my 2nd review today this set came out about the same time as the rots sets and included the first minifig to have a lul 1 box  manual this is the front of the box it has a try me slot for the lul vader a close up of the try me slot luckily i got mine form argos so no little kids have been playing around with it the manual cover im not quite sure why it has a pic of the figs on the front but it doesnt deface it so i dont mind random manual shot rots set preview at the back of the manual 2 general set and figs the contents of the set  the minifigs a normal tie pilot and the first ever lul fig dv also my only lul fig no helmets tie pilot torso the lul is made of 3 parts lighted up the led for the blade 3 the tie fighter just a pic of it cockpit with controls tie pilot sitting in the cockpit by the way the hinge brick is the wrong color it is supposed to be grey the cockpit shut i wonder why tlc never printed those cockpit glass things correctly jet out the back top plate has some nice printing 5 overall build 510 very repetitivewell the ships symmetrical minifigs 410 1 tie pilot which is okay but a lul vader he cant even fit in the ship design 610 strong but the wings are all wobbly if that makes sense i dont like the blue either parts 610 lots of blue grills thingys not much else but it got 6 because of the wings plates price 510 could have been more expensive at least it had 2 figs playability 110 cant do much as a stand alone set overall 410 there just isnt enough here it could at least have a better color scheme and instead of dv it could come with a stormie like the old one did	negative
thanks for the review i actually like the older tie better since it had a stand for the tie not really a fan of the lu figs either no matter  a tie is a tie and this is a must have fighter for any lego sw fan out there never can get enough ties except the tie advanced or vaders tiethey dont rock kimt	positive

and now for something completely different tiny turbos belonging to the racers line when i saw 8147 bullet run on sh for half the price i couldn´t resist buying it we had a lot of fun celebrating a bagbuild at our event using the 8150 zx turbo of that theme so i knew what would expect me with this extended set price normal 4999€ now 2499€ well i paid 3499€ in a lego store but that´s another story bricks 796 minifigs  hey this is tiny turbos stupid stickers don´t ask or read further the open box reveals seven polybags some with more smaller polybags inside the instruction booklet 2 ramps and the sticker sheet of course i put all of the bags on the table and not on the floor hey tlc didn´t print this on the first page of the building instructions and you won´t see any piece callouts as well on the other hand this is not adifficult build so why show them still there is an inventory list of all bricks at the end of the instructions note the giant sticker sheet we all now the dss but that is a new kind of extra super large sticker sheet it holds 82 stickers more to that later on the build is quite basic the only nonconventional parts of the build were the two slammers and the most annoying part was fiddling the rubber band of the holder without destroying it bag 1 easy beginning building the lime car the limo and the two slammers nothing exciting about the lime car but the limo was neat it´s an 18 studs long car the normal racers are abot 10 studs long nice way to put the horns on the back the slammers mmmmh nice invention if they would actually do something they are supposed to give the tubros a kick in the butt to speed them up but the result is a 80 cm long run and that´s it i had expected more acceleration from the slammers but it´s also fun to play with the cars without slamming them bag 2 convoy time the tow truck and the fuel truck the tow truck is a great idea and a good addition to the set the cars are supposed to crash  how do they get back home well here´s the answer quite american layout of the truck and it´s very well done horns 5 flashing lights and a right color choice you can move the arm up and down and pull out the hook note the metallic silver antennae the fuel tank has got a secret function it may break on the middle of the trailer therefore it has a hinge build in the bottom city fire mayhem and there´s no fire engine bag 3 long longer how long can a tiny truck be the pipe truck an unexpected buggy and the red racer 36 studs long the pipe truck breaks every convention the cabin is almost the same like the tow truck and the fuel truck and that is the good part of it the trailer has to carry pipes and is functional as well as it can commute sidewarts it looks quite unrealistic as well and you cannot drive this beast on tiny roads good for another crash but there are more cars in this bag now this was a surprise a buggy this is the only 6wide car but just because the wheels are large monster truck madness i don´t care for those cars personally a disappointment i would have preferred another racer  for variety though did i say another racer here we are the red devil great looking a real fast shape and red the best racer in this set vrooommm this is the most played with car of the set not only from me  as you may have noticed i didn´t put any stickers so far i don´t like stickers especially when placed over two or more bricks and here you are supposed to do it several times of course the cars look better with stickers on but they are also great without stickers only the fuel truck looks boring without my sons didn´t know there were supposed to be stickers and they didn´t ask for them so everything is allright here´s a closeup of the sticker sheet did i already mention it was 82 stickers  the only exception i made using sticker was for bag 4 bag 4 you go here you pay the highway toll booth the only immobile part of the set but great to brake though the barriers that is fun i only put on stickers on 2x2 plates where i had the idea to use those plates further on on different other mocs this looks a bit boring without the other stickers i admit but still no cut off to the playability there are also two ramps belonging to the set these only make sense if you are able to speed up the racers with the slammers and hit the ramps correctly i had problems with that so they are on the shelves now could be a lot fun making a contest though like this picture of the inventories frontpage all cars put together the usual leftovers all in all this is a great set to call ones own i did not regret buying it especially when it was 50 off even normal price would not have been too much build great for smaller children boring to afols 510 special brickscolors none all basics 310 design i love the tiny turbos´ size and design 910 playability 1 because of the slammers another 1 because no minifigscale but that is not the intention of the set still 910 pricepiece ratio dang it´s not on sale any more but if you hurry you could still grab one in the lego stores 1010 all in all 8510 and a clear recommendation it was and still is a set to play with your children the size fits perfectly to matchbox cars and that was exactly what my younger son did can you find all of the cars included in the set ps after buying this set i won an ebay auction with another tiny turbos set  8135 bridge chase this is even more fun i will soon care for a review with some never seen phototricks as well stay tuned edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0702 pm indexed	neutral
this set was on my wanted list for a long time and the sales at sh came just in time i also loved the set and like you only put the stickers on the toll both it looks great on a town layout with almost no modifications the racers are great the trucks and the limo are the best in my oppinion the sticker sheet is huge but ive seen bigger stickers over multiple pieces are the worst the slammers are ok but not great i played with my 4 years old son and we tryed to do what shows in the box the cars passing the toll jumping the ramps and crashing the trucks but it is very difficult to get it right but the crashes are very fun	positive
thanks for the review ill definately get this set sooner or later imo the tiny turbos are awesome i actually bought nearly every set so far built the models added the stickers and packed them away in ziplock bags in the attic sadly i dont have display room for them yet a fine set carwise dump the slammers and buildings into the spare bag and keep the cars kimt tiny turbos on	positive

as my summer holiday was kinda wet for 2 weeks i decided to shop some sets i crossed the german border and bought me this one mainly for the parts to get time going i built the models and made this small review for you to enjoy or hate high resolution pics can be found here when public set 4994 title fierce creatures price 999 euro  1299 usd pieces 193 minifigs 0 the box the box looks awesome it has some great animations of the 3 models in the instruction the rear of the box shows some nice upcloseandpersonal drawings of each model i think it works better having the models drawn instead of a mere photo of them somehow it allows the great colourscheme to really show the instructions the instruction is easy to follow and shows which pieces are used in each building step that makes it all a lot easier especially with so many small pieces as in this set the bricks are divided into 3 polybags and the instruction is a fine small book which can be easily stored along the rest of your evergrowing amount of booklets and pamphlets printed by tlg the models model 1 is a spider and it’s nasty the 2x2 modified brick with the hole would allow one to hang it from a string this beast is sure to give you several nightmares were it hanging from a string in your bedroom – so i wouldn’t do that plus the fact that my wife threw away the box and ordered me to take the spider apart when she saw it – she’s an arachnophobian and does not take spiders lightly it looks real in a brickishnonrealway model 2 is a snake there’s not much to say other than the head is awesomely designed and the rest is bad the body is poorly designed and does not live up to the coolness of the head build the head ignore the rest model 3 is a flying scorpion or something not as realistic as the spider but still a great model with a cool head the tail is a bit poorly designed but it’ll do and it does offer some good ideas on how to use bricks all in all verdicts this is an ok creator set it holds a lot of fine pieces and the models are an ok inspiration given its size it’s an ok set but it’s nothing more than that i’ll give it an average score i enjoyed building the models and fumbling with the bricks in the shade during a “siesta” on my vacation and that’s what it is an enjoyable build and a little inspiration on a hot day with a erdinger dunkel weissbier in my other hand kimt edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0629 pm indexed	positive
looks like a pretty good set with a some nice colors the spider is probably the best model in my opinion but i mean look at the wasp kinda weak it you ask me nice review 	positive
thanks for the review kim kimt on aug 3 2008 0101 pm said i crossed the german border and bought me this one mainly for the parts what parts were you looking for or just for all of the parts i like the story with your wife the spider is really cool nice photo shots on the grass kim too bad the other alternative builds are kinda odd always creators on	positive
4500 rebel snow speeder review parts 214 figs 3 price £2000 edit new box pics added sorry theyre a bit blurry because of the light i took them in this is the original trilogy edition version of this set but there arent any differences to the normal one 1 manual  box the front of the ote box the minifgs on the box top the back of the box with some alternate models and overview of some of the functions the manual cover you can see it is the ote version of the set random shot 1 of 2 posters in the instructions the second poster 2 general set and minifigs the built set contents the three figs with the included weapons how i like to customize the pilots helmets luke from 4500 and luke from 10178 motorized atat the three helmets included with the set 3 turret heres the turret with the rebel gunner standing next to it the controls for the turret  the turret can rotate and tilt two fire at those pesky atat walkers i put a spider web sort of radar dish thing on like on the original 7130 to make it look more like the one from tesb 4 the speeder a front view of the speeder the pilot controls with a atat print the seats for the pilot and rear gunner the rear gunners tow cable a detailed printed plate next to the engines printed plates under the airbrake things more printed parts there is no dss with this set got tie up those walkers we might need some more tow cable  5 overall build 710 pretty symmetrical build but its fun minifigs 810 3 figs in a £20 set is pretty good i think design 910 very strong and close to minifig scale the turret could have some work though parts 810 lots of variety and includes some interesting ones such as the cockpit and rear air vent price 710 3 figs and 214 parts not to bad i guess playability 610 could be better if it came with a snow trooper overall 810 the set comes with 3 figs that only come with more expensive sets also it has a variety of different parts as well as the build being enjoyable edited by skipper 24 04 august 2008  0310 pm indexed	neutral
i once bought a entire lego collection including this set however i never have build it seeing this fine review has given me new motivation to do so nice work again skipper	positive
my review gave you motivation to build a set my review was better than i thought	positive
skipper thanks for doing up all these sw reviews it certainly had given me some valuable insights on these sets especially on the snowspeeder it kind of making me regret to pass off this set however i had bought the hoth base instead but had never built it i am just wondering if the snowspeeder had any difference keep up the good work and always strive your best to make each upcoming review a better one	positive
there isnt much difference apart form it has stickers on and is grey also the guns and tow cable gun are different as well as the engines but if you look at pictures of the hoth base speeder not to much is noticeable	neutral
i have mixed feelings about this set its one of the sets that sent my into a dark age the birth of my son contributed heavily when i first saw this set i was convinced that the earlier snowspeeder 7130 was superior in every way i liked the look of the 7130 version better i liked the coloration of it better the turret was better it used a webbed 6 x 6 dish after seeing this review i realize i was wrong on some accounts the cockpit is much more movie accurate the 7130 version had two separate compartments this version also came with a tow cable something that was lacking from the previous set while i still am unimpressed with the overall look of this set it is much less blocky which is always a good thing overall i still prefer 7130 to the 4500 version but the 4500 isnt nearly as bad as i first assumed and i regret never buying one of these when i had my chance	neutral
great review i bought this set when it came out but sold it a couple years later for some extra cash i have no regrets selling this one as i was never really impressed with it different story for the 4483 atat  oh how i wish i still had that one the snowspeeder was alright just didnt have any sort of wow factor to it the best part of the set is probably the rebel trooper looking at the last photo in your review looks like youre about to have a major battle in your hallway apart from the snowspeeder  motorized atat i see the arc170 fighter grievouss starfighter and is that a podracer i see  and what is the set with the treads its not star wars but looks like a pretty cool set maybe a mission mars vehicle	positive
podracer not sure where you got that from i didnt have them out the set with treads is a dino 2010 thing which fits in well after a bit of modding also there are some of the old exoforce sets out there like the fire vulture because i always saw them fitting well with star wars	neutral
skipper 24 on aug 4 2008 1252 pm said podracer not sure where you got that from i didnt have them out i noticed the minifig between the grievous starfighter  the moddino2010 vehicle and it looked like a little person sitting in the pod of his podracer guess my eyes are playing tricks on me  my eyesight is shot  my wife keeps pushing me to go visit the optometrist	neutral

you have to love the originals well i didnt like the very first snowspeeder so this is the original to me i like it more then the new one that comes with the echo base beter color scheme and more realistic i think i got this set in stores and still love it to this day 	positive

i had this set £15 rrp actually  and agree mostly with your review although on the wheel bike itself two legs can be placed at the front end and two at the back to enable it to roll properly boga is very juniorised and the set itself is very simple and contains many large pieces the minifigures are good though i traded my gg however  just to offer my personal thoughts build 510 minifigs 1010 parts 310 price 710 playability 1010 overall 710  not an average tk	neutral

7153 jango fetts slave 1 review parts 358 figs 2 price £2000 i got it on offer i think the rrp was £40 the only set to include jango fett and young boba also the decals on jango are from fine clonier im trying to say they dont came with the set 1 manual worn manual random page another random page looking at this page you can that this set has numbered bags back cover look how old yodas computer looks  2 general set and minifigs the sets contents jango with his hair on jango with helmet on with front view of face twist jangos head to initiate super bounty hunter mode jangos doubled sided head boba nothing to special although i think the torso and head are exclusive to the set 3 the ship not really scaled up right as you can see the guns can rotate the central sections interior not sure what this is is it a hyperdrive or a bomb or something there are these side panels on both sides behind the panels a secret compartment trans orange minifig heads in the compartment i think theyre supposed to be saturnic charges side storage compartment the back of the ship how those trans orange minifig heads fallout there is a magnet on the inside of the ship but for what the secret prison which also has a magnet on the top so it can stay on but easily come out the doors on it can lift up to put prisoners inside 1 of 2 identical wing things they can fold for flight mode the controls bottom jet thing let me out of here the prison is great for capturing small children 4 overall build 710 impossible to build without a hard stable surface minifigs 1010 2 exclusive figs design 710 nowhere near to scale but has some nice features parts 810 good parts like that big cockpit canopy price 910 for the price i got it was pretty good especially with the figs it comes with playability 710 lots of features but it would be better if it came with a jsf overall 910 lots of features and comes with exclusive minifigs edited by kimt 04 august 2008  1144 am indexed	positive
thanks again skipper for producing yet another review to go into the index i like this slave1 but sadly i must admit that i like the really old version better boba fetts slave1 that is even though is grossly undersized i think its better than this one belonging to his father jango kimt	neutral
i have all three of the slave i ships and i agree with kimtalthough it is a very small compact ship the first slave i boba fett is still the sturdiest the newest slave i boba fett is not bad and is of much better construction than this slave i from jango fett even though i like the size and scale of the jango slave i and the newest boba fett slave iwhen you pick that very first one up it had the feeling ofyou can throw me against the wall drop me off the roof of your house or let 4 two year olds play with meim not gonna break at least thatss my opinion good review	positive

i got the original jsf for christmas which i might buy and review wonderful set the obi in this one is really awesome and its really just a great ship sticker free probably my favourite id fly it if any ship from star wars maybe i should get it and the slave i from episode ii after all i like jango despite having a crap story	positive
very good review i have he newest slave i and i like it more than this one dsr	neutral
okay i have fixed that pic thanks oky wan i have modified this but then yesterday i built it back to its original state to review it	neutral
you added some decals to the jango figure right  they seem to be suffering a little i remember buying this set from the discount tent after my first visit to legoland windsor i wasnt sure whether to buy it even in their sale  but i was glad i did once id built it 	neutral
i really want one of these if only it wasnt expensive i probably wont buy it because itd be scraped for parts too quick great review though	neutral
good review i always wanted to know how it was different to the boba fett slave i i would probably only get this though for jango fett the newer one looks sturdier and proportioned better imo	neutral
a very nicely done review i remember getting this slave i  it was my first large star wars set	positive
this set looks liek a good buy for 4 wish it was still around but like you said it needs accessories	positive
i remember having this set actually i even still have it at least the pars are somewhere  when i was a child and i used it for making races as it is there for all these many reviews let me think again at that i also planned to make some reviews for the town section i got your message thebrickster dont worry i got a lot to do at the moment but i should find some time this upcoming week	neutral

7261 clone turbo tank parts 801 figs 8 price £7000 ouch  edit new box pics added my version of the set comes with a normal mace windu figure and an extra clone trooper also the mace windu barc trooper and jet trooper minifigs were exclusive to the set well you could make the jet trooper yourself  also my set came with 4 extra blasters youll see them later and baby blue vent things instead of trans blue 1manual  box the front of the box the box compared to the motorized atat and the hailfire droid and dwarf spider droid minifgs the back which has pics of the sets functions and alternate models inside the box it has a white cardboard divider probably for strength seeming as the box it so flimsy pretty hefty manual the tt manual compared to the one of the atat ones random shot another random shot poster at the back of the manual 2 general set and minifigs the whole set i accidentally left one of the plates up when i took the pic close up of the figs two battle droids come with blasters and a mini turret the republic from lr jet trooper mace windu not lul barc trooper normal clone the commander look out jet pack maces torso barc trooper legs barc trooper torso he has got to be my favorite clone trooper by tlc the mysterious commander on lsw he was called cody right but he has star corps armour making him commander bly left  normal clone and the look out clone with electro binoculars 3 speeder bike side view of the barc speeder menacingish front view is menasingish a word printed back engine piece one of my shield things came with a crumpled handle it is worse than it looks in the pic 4 the turret the turret it can rotate and point upwards but what if you want to blast all those battle droids that are shorter than the height of the turret blasters add another hinge in that extra hinge in action 5 the tank its to big to get a decent side view pic johnny the cabin boy on the crows nest front 2 seater cockpit the 2 seats better be careful you dont fall off your seat there are some pretty big gaps down the sides back cockpit with dual missile launchers the back seat the engine the large central storage the turret controls fold down to lock into place so it doesnt fall out when driving you can put 2 minifigs up top mace and a clone driving you can see those 4 extra blasters 2 orange at the front of the pic and 2 between the chairs the turret and jet trooper barc trooper on the barc speeder the commander on the lift chair in the back cockpit another shot of that chair 6 overall build 810 quite enjoyable because it incorporates technic and system parts minifigs 910 on a set this size it has quite a lot including some exclusives such as the barc trooper but it could of had a droid or 2 more design 710 way out of scale but generally pretty strong due to the technic frame parts 710 lots of plates and nice minifig parts price 610 justifiable because of the amount of figs in the set playability 710 includes some cis units to fight the clones overall810 needs more droids and it could be bigger i will also probably have a break form reviewing for now seeming as i have just put out a whole load of reviews edited by kimt 09 august 2008  0851 pm indexed as 7261 review 2	positive

did your version without the lul mace have trans blue grill things like the ones on the back of the speeder  or was my set a one off	neutral
i got the original version of this set with the luls mace windu figure when tlc released the nonluls version i managed to swap  they sent me the new version and a clone trooper iirc and i mailed them back the old version this was a great set the suspension worked great and it rolled magnificently nice review with good photos but again your price is a little off £6999 is the rrp unless the price you paid was £80 tk	positive

good set but its flimsy as sin but that may have been my rush job building it mine got shoved off a bed oh and i lost my light up mace  propably somewhere within the blue bin o doom™ aka the brick bucket™ or blocknull™  edited by maiq the liar 04 august 2008  1015 pm	neutral

nice review simon jedi the v19 has been one of my favourite ships since the release of cwa and this is one of the sets ive been considering most about buying its great to see tlgs treatment of it it looks like no expense was spared making it as aesthetically and functionally accurate as possible  though i think the cockpit windshield could maybe have been slightly bigger but thats just me im sure it looks pretty big compared to other starfighters too did it take a long time to build	positive
great review simonjedi  i really like that you included lots of photos of your build i put together my v19 torrent last night and i was surprised by how heavy the completed ship is it has some real heft once its finished wow it is a really cool ship i was disappointed that the central wing doesnt really lock into place once it flips down it just kind of droops there so i attached a technic pin to the locking arm so it could plug into the 2x4 brick thats on the underside of the starfighter this brick can be seen in your photo of the bottom of the ship overall the build is one of the more confusing that ive seen i had to dismantle and rebuild the first engine after i realized id left out a piece and i kept thinking of the poor 7yearold that gets this set as hisher very first lego set ever	negative
pedro on aug 5 2008 1229 pm said it looks pretty big compared to other starfighters too did it take a long time to build it took me 3 and a bit hours to build it although i had some problems with the technic and i had to take pictures during the build	neutral
thanks for this excellent review simonjedi  this looks like an awesome set and this is the set i am most looking foward just as well as the separatist spider droid 7681 	positive
the ability for it to fold in and out of attack position has wowed me this is my top priority now thanks for making up my mind	positive
hydraulic wings i am very impressed and am now considering getting this set purely because of this funciton i am just curious as to know why are there sand green parts on the bottom of the v19 is it visible when the model is completed i am also pleased to see tlc giving us a printed cockpit computer this time around	positive

in addition to my last comment am i correct in saying that the left over yellow technic part was merely to hold parts together while building edited by skipper 24 10 october 2008  0910 pm	negative
daxflame680 on nov 30 2008 0103 am said i built mine today as soon as i tried to put it in attack position the thingy rotates the wrong way and it falls apart what a waste of 55 i suggest you to check again if you put the technic gear in the correct way cause if not than maybe that the problem  also i dont think it is a waste in my opinion the ship is very well designed and is actually pretty strong or at least mine  and the pilot minifig is fantastic even if there is just one of them edited by darkrebellion 30 november 2008  0317 am	positive

i love this set and i gave it outstanding i might note though that the cylinder is just there as a dampener when disenegaged the wing function still works just not as smoothly interestingly though the cylinder is an old piece i have a few others its just that this is the first time its been used without a spring i had no problems assembling this set	positive
having just bought myself a copy of the wonderful metroliner 4558 i felt like doing a review before we start id like to thank greenhair for selling me one of his metroliners for a mere 80 euros granted the motor trainstation and tracks werent included but i did get an extra railcar instead   please note that i have included the fourth wagon in the final pic but that the official set includes just three wagons the metroliner was released in 1992 and was extremely popular amongst lego fans the set a picture of the box showing the set completely pic taken from peeron and one of the minifigs and the accessories as you may notice tlc was extremely generous supplying us with a grand total of 11 minifgs amongst which no less than 4 female minifigs ah the population crisis is finally over we also have three suitcases three cups and a small freight parcel and freight handling thingy normally this would include two bicycles a red and a black one a general side view of the three carriages thanks to greenhair and the brickster and heres one of the extra carriage thanks to greenhair and the brickster moving onto the front and back carriage which are externally identical please note that greenhair changed my back carriages headlights these would be yellow in the normal set all the doors in the entire set are printed pieces sorry for the bad picture quality in this one the interior of the two however is laid out a bit differently the space in the front carriage is occupied by a cockpit or whatever it is called in trains and some space to store your cable connecting the front lights with the engine i can imagine it must get quite cramped and dangerous for the minifig driver with all the cabling further back we have a quite random weird looking engine one part reminded me rather of a jet engine on a commercial airplane the engine is accessible by means of the two side cargo doors at the end of our first carriage we hit what looks like the trains restaurant two tables and no chairs the two middle carriages are identical both have a small sink nicely hidden from the intervening and impolite looks of fellow passengers the carriage further contains two tables and four seats two cargo spaces are nicely tucked away from view below the tables our final carriage has a back cockpit as well but differs from the front carriage in the central cargo area  where our train employee is hard at work earning his lego nickels  and the rear sleeping area the bed is a double one the upper one able to be flipped up for somewhat difficult access to the lower one the train station i could not take photos off since it was not included in the purchase judging from the building plans however i feel it was thrown in at the end just to add something to the set its construction is very simple consisting of a few grey plates on top of a few pillars access is provided by a plate which is connected to the platform with a few hinges there are however two lamp posts a timetable and a few chairs so if you dont like the platform you can still use these parts in a variety of other constructios to end off i took a pic of the complete set with extra wagon and a friendly surprised train driver opening the door and greeting the camera man conclusion being a 90s set the train basically builds itself the entire build cost me two hours and a half i lost quite some time simply admiring the set and was extremely straightforward with no suprises at all but i need to admit it has its charm the exterior is simply amazing the sleekness of the design the colours it matches perfectly i believe however that a width of 8 studs would be more to scale but 6 wide still looks amazing the interior is somewhat simplistic but is easily moddeable with a few extra pieces i basically bought the train as a parts pack the standard set three wagons includes no less than 8 train doors with windows 14 train windows 4 smaller longer ones and 4 freight doors the front and back of course count as unique pieces as well one feature i am displeased with are the printed doors i like printed pieces and while the bluewhitered stripe looks beautiful on the side the printed doors kind of limit mocing capabilities to carriages with a stripe on the side i considered simply removing the stripe but i found out i could just get normal grey ones from bricklink for a fair price i am very pleased with the train but since you already know my opinion feel free to tell us yours of this fabulous set edited by thebrickster 09 july 2009  0151 pm poll question was not multiple choice switched to radio group	positive
i voted outstanding this is simply an amazingly good looking train and comes with indeed 11 minifigs i sold this one because i need a budget to build my ship but i kept one because i love it not bad for a first review ruben	positive

oh ruben you lucky so and so this set is one of the most beautful i have ever seen splendid looking build and 11 figures all the same faces like but still you get that old woman pigtail head piece which is just great i thought you meant the monorail set when you told me about this but guess i was wrong dont laugh ive been away from lego for quite some time and for 80 euros it was a real bargain from a great friend really nice review hope this sets brings you years of joy	positive
im not normally that big into trains but this set has a real coolness factor that sets it apart from most of the others the color scheme is the same one that amtrak and many local subway systems use i picked it up along with the club car expansion when they were rereleased in 2001 i have made various modifications to mine rearranging the car layouts and adding a second train motor into the rearmost car along with another set of lights so that both ends light up as you said it would be great to have an 8stud version of this so you could fit in two rows of seats side by side that might make a nice mod project at some point	positive
outstanding train set the legend of the entire train series is the metroliner this is a super 5 set the color design minifigs is just so perfect and lovely it resemble the trains which we see on our rails in our daily life i cant find any flaws on this at all the only flaw i noticed is my mistake of not able to buy this set at all in fact i had never seen this set in the shops before in my entire life thebrickster on aug 5 2008 0923 am said how cool is that and 11 minifigs  when was the last time lego included 11 figs in a single set there is another set fufil the criteria above which is also a well known legend it has 12 minifigs which is the 10159 city airport aka century skyway airport	positive
ahh the good old train theme how i wish tlg would make such great trains today now that the quality of city sets has improved so much that really brings back memories even if i didnt have this one but a cargo train that came out about the same time period maybe plus a few years i dont have any trains myself at the moment mostly because im afraid i havent got enough space to put in on display with all the rails and stuff	positive
this is a great review of a great set hairy ruben i voted for outstanding since the only thing you can say about this train set is that it is outstanding it has been the best passenger train in all the time from legos beginning on until now i bought the rereleased version of it in 2003  and i really really do not regret it klausdieter	positive
hairy ruben on aug 5 2008 1200 am said the interior of the two however is laid out a bit differently the space in the front carriage is occupied by a cockpit or whatever it is called in trains and some space to store your cable connecting the front lights with the engine i can imagine it must get quite cramped and dangerous for the minifig driver with all the cabling further back we have a quite random weird looking engine one part reminded me rather of a jet engine on a commercial airplane the engine is accessible by means of the two side cargo doors at the end of our first carriage we hit what looks like the trains restaurant two tables and no chairs there shouldnt be so much of the light cable in the front section or cockpit most of the cable should be in the central part of the train then it is not so crowded for the engine driver i have never had a problem with the cable and the space available for it the only problem i had was that the cable had a loose contact after some time when the train went into a curve cant remember if it was a left or right curve the light went off i have now got the same problem with the cable that i put into my santa fe super chief always when the engine turns into a right curve the light goes off my dad could repair the cable for the metroliner even though he is quite skilled at repairing electronic things he found it very difficult to repair since there were no screws to open the electronic plate it annoyed him a lot so ive been asking myself if i should really bother him with a second cable with the same problem the train set itself is outstanding and thats what i voted for i only have the legend 10001 but its 99 identical to 4558 i also have club car 4547 i dont have the legend club car 10002 the reason for this is i always had the choice between one big lego set or several small ones for christmas when i was a child i always went for several small ones metroliner 4558 would have been a big train set but i really wanted a passenger car so i bought 4547 with my savings without having the metroliner i was quite happy when the metroliner was rereleased i bought it with my own money then i could finally use the club car with the train it was created for edited by legotrainfan 15 august 2008  0755 pm	neutral
panda9001100 on aug 16 2008 0737 am said only strange they named it metroliner in holland when we speak of a metro i need to think at short distance trains only used in big cities like rotterdam it was only named metroliner in the us because of the color scheme is similar to the reallife metroliner i believe in eu it was called the euroexpress and probably just passenger train wherever that would be suitable the productnumber 4558 is universal though hairy ruben you dont have a review of the doubledeckerclub car on the way do you i myself never got it and i am seriously considering buying one from bricklink plus it is moreorless an requirement for this train one of very few doubledecker cars to actually stay within the general outer dimensions of the train	neutral
my favourite favourite favourite old set its too bad i was born 2 years after its release i would have had a major interest in classic town i might actually get this one on bricklink not that itll go for a good price ill only buy if it does you see an outstanding a highly useful and wellmade set that really just stands out from its counterparts edit nevermind edited by dovchenko 16 august 2008  1025 am	positive

super review thanks simply put id have to admit this is one of the best indy sets and in such a small package its a very detailed lil jeep and thats why i like it i have this too but i dont want to open it since its exclusive wait i thought we were calling it rown and not frown	positive
thanks for the review hinckley i love this set i still havent renewed my bm subscription but im sure i can find this on ebay or bricklink and what an addition this would be to my army edited by vbbn 05 august 2008  0132 am	positive
nice review hinckley i just got mine as well by paying quite a high price for it since its exclusive to us however i had not opened it yet and i left it in my friends car i gave it for an above average for that cool little jeep for an exclusive brickmaster set this is certainly one of the best vehicles i had ever seen i like its construction built if this is ever released in the main stream i am sure it will be a hit to get a small sized indiana jones set	positive
outstanding set and review thanks for presenting it ive had this since it first came out but didnt think it would be that impressive so i didnt bother opening it now im tempted aside from the slight size issue i cant find anything here to gripe about except for the limited availability i want 5 i think that makes me a parts monkey eek eek youre exactly right about this selling like mad its another one of those missed opportunities for tlg sure its nice to get people to subscribe by offering it as part of brickmaster but in the long run put it in the stores for 6 and sell a million just give us indys manbag we need it for postal employees and such as is the running joke whenever i comment on one of your reviews id give this a solid 985 not out of anything just 985 or in clearer terms  12 though i voted 5	positive
nice review i would like to get this set unfortunately i dont get brickmaster mag and the prices on bl ebay will most likely be ridiculous i wonder why indy doesnt come with his murse man purse in this set thats the best part of the fig the jeep itself is very nice especially with the dark green by the way what is frown brownish something i guess oh yeah and funny comic	positive
looks really nice if they keep making bm sets like this i might actually subscribe nice comic too remind me not to run into copmike and his gloveless hand	positive
thanks for the cool review hinckley when i saw the picture originally i thought it looked good but not that good but seeing the pictures in your review i love this i voted it as outstanding because it has great parts and a brilliant construction ingenious perhaps sirnadroj on aug 5 2008 0230 am said simply put id have to admit this is one of the best indy sets i agree its so sad we europeans cant get it	positive

thanks for the good review  i can´t wait for mine to arrive and just think how close paulc was in his reverse building of this which turned into a event exclusive in billund  he was just wrong on the color of the headlight bricks black instead of frown and the rear bumper stuff which couldn´t be seen on the bag picture kudos paulc as for my badass patrol car and the sop standard operation procedure of cavity searches there´s more to see here over at brickzone  here´s a teaser copmike	positive

this set easily is above average for me i had this as a little child and whenever any of my relatives came to visit us they brought me some lego usually it was either this set or 6844 the really nice thing about this set are the alternate builds for the low price you got a nice range of parts and cool ideas what to build with them you could build a fleet of rovers or the alternates and everytime it was huge fun 	positive

this is by far my favourite outback series set i loved the fact that you can bend the bridge in different directions so that the suspension of the car really worked to keep the car levelled like you placed it in your last picture i had lots of fun with this when it came out eleven years ago in 1997 the bridge scene could also be used in the adventurers serie of 1998 classic highest rating buy it if you dont already have it	positive
great review brickster why exactly did the outback adventure etc themes never quite catch onjust a thought what a great set i wish i had it but in 1997 i was just back from my whirl wind trips around the world and had drifted away from lego i dont know why but i will say this i love the actual suspension that came with this set and the trains sets i have been trying to buy up as much of it as i can and now i see i need to add one more set to the i need to get that	positive

here we are my first clone wars set and my first star wars review here we have the wonderful droid gunship one of the cheaper of the clone wars sets this set is exclusive to walmart and its one of the better exclusives out there im looking at you twilight  first off we have a shot of the entire set with the box a random page shot along with pics of the parts list the build is split up into three sections the back the cockpit and the missles the back has a lot of nice dark blue plates and is the only part of the set which uses stickers the bottoms shows various technic systems which ill get to later the cockpit has many details mostly guns and the rotating guns are a nice touch the cockpit can fit a battle droid but not a minifig im not sure why a droid would want leather though the last part is loading this baby with the missles there are four blacksmall and two dark bley large missles which are loaded in groups of three as sls the middle mechanism is for the missiles and the back part with the bionicle teeth are used ad landing gear the knob on top turns to release the missiles on the clones  leftover bits and the used ssnot so d this time around the gunship versus a time traveling agent charge  overall build 810 a basic build but at some points repetitive minifigs 1010 just your basic droids you cant go wrong design 710 a basic design with some interesting techniques pieces 910 a mix of old and new pieces along with the return of this lovely piece which hasnt been seen for almost 10 years price 810 30 for a gunship ill take it final verdict 810 a great price for a small set like this and it has a great bit of swooshability	positive

i got this yesterday on sale only 5500 yen60 american and was a little disappointed id avoided it but all the new sets are at least a month away here it looks a little weird in photo and the actual build is worse just a flat little disc with a cockpit only special points for the color which will probably just look better with those 2009 sets	negative
emergency evac set  6445 theme town resq year released 1998 piece count 97 minifigs 1 list price 8 usd in 1998 lego introduced a new theme called resq the theme was really a quasicoast guard subtheme of classic town the theme included boats helicopters emergency vehicles and even a water hovercraft most notable was the black and yellow color combination that predominated the sets i only picked up a couple of sets from the theme including this emergency evacuation vehicle that i consider a van i never got into the theme but looking back at these sets i have gained a better appreciation for their value in classic town lets take a look at 6445 in greater detail starting with the box the back of the box providing a few alternate models and similar imagery on the instructions the set includes one small sheet of decals for the van 6445 has one resq minifig that i find pretty nice i like the neon orange reflectors he has a nice printed backside with the word resq prominently displayed this little set includes an abundance of tools a black walkietalkie is not pictured heres the emergency van i like the back section that has a nice winch with turning wheel and a few hooks for tools heres the minifig pulling the grappling hook for some resq action this is my favorite part of this set the van isnt too fancy but has some neat features while i like the blue windshield piece for maybe space sets im not really fond of its use for the van the van has no steering wheel but rather two levers for steering on the top of the vehicle are two emergency alarms and some extra lights the back of the van has a large opening piece that allows wide access to the back section it comfortably fits a long gurneystretcher heres the driver resting on the gurney he should never have tried to pick up the gurney without a 2nd resq minifig and a shot of the back section without the gurney lastly a picture of the complete set final thoughts resq is really a neat theme that has great play value for kids while its not one of my more favorite town subthemes it does offer some nice pieces and an abundance of black and yellow pieces i think a few of the resq sets go nicely with the divers theme released one year earlier in 1997 i had a chance to purchase the largest set of the theme 6479 emergency response center at half the price but passed back in the late 90s id be interested in finding out what other eb members think of this set and the resq theme	positive
wow and people complain that a military type line would be to violent here we have half dead soilders and a space shuttle bombing people with severed skeleton heads i have to say this is the first time ive heard of this theme i like the colors as most have pointed out the base plate is preety cool two could use it to moc up some garages	positive
i am a proud owner of this set like others i got it discounted and couldnt resit the parts pack this is the type of lego sets that bothers me when you look at it now youd be tempted to say hey not bad but at the same time some years ago it wasnt good enough to buy it full price i was kinda disappointed because usually sets using that kinda baseplates are excellent castle paradisa and this one is just ok one really minus point would be the lack of any opponent faction in the set	negative
thats it thanks for the review but now you make me want to build my own one thanks a lot on a more serious note i really like this set and have always wished to aquire it i have two broken tie interceptors so this should be a easy build and as someone in the pirate forum i think said it would be a great baseplate for building cave to hide the booty thanks pmg and welcome	positive
thanks for the review pmj  i like the play value in this set even if i don´t own it  the way the orbs are put into the rocket is awesome and i really like it but at the end the set have some lack of detail 	neutral
really awesome review sveltecorps  you did a really complete and indepth review of this beast and with your nice pics is really enjoyable reading your review so congrats  i like this ship even if it looks so bulky but i need to buy first other sets so maybe this beast will be landing in my collection the next year or this one if i am lucky  i can just ask for something can you post a pic of all your clone wars sets together with this one all the sets in one pic not many pics with this an each set  please  edited by darkrebellion 12 august 2008  0220 am	positive

i read the visual guide recently and learned a bit more about the twilight i wont get into spoilers but it seems that the ship becomes a sort of endearing family van for the characters which is neat big bulky uncool but it gets you from one place to another if it factors into more than just the 90 minute film i may pick this up it seems that theres room for a lot of personality in this ship once you see the film it is a corellian freighter smuggling spice for the hutts thats cool right	neutral

this is probably the best review ive ever seen why it put the set in context with peoples changing thoughts about it it commented on the box why do such expensive sets have such ordinary boxes the photography was outstanding every issue that a builder could have with it was discussed in a calm and rational manner i have the same issues with technic structured sets and sveltecorps summed up my feelings on this beautifully this was an even handed review so thoughtful finally you gotta love a bit of humour in a review that gardenis brilliant i was probably never going to get this set anyway but it sets a new worlds best standard for reviews i strongly encourage anyone thats going to review a set to have a good look at this to see how well it can be done thanks for the magnificent review	positive
oh no anakin has gone over to the green side of the force well i guess someone had to review the clunkadunk eventually and you did a good job at it svelte corps i liked the punchline with the ahsokahairpiece swapping the ugha warrior upgrade is an interesting way of creating male togrutas and ahsoka looks even hotter with infernos hair matteo kenobi on aug 11 2008 0930 pm said if i am really impressed with it in the film i suppose that would change things but i will have to see  i wouldnt count on it spoiler after its first flight the twilight will crash and burn wookieepedia says so and you can see it in one of the trailers so i guess the twilight will stay mostly unbought poor clunkadunk	positive
thanks a lot for a very nice and entertaining review your photos were really nice and there have been some reviews lately that have such blurry pics cough cough it was a pleasure to see you can 1 put lego bricks together 2 write a review 3 handle your camera i think this ship is underrated it is really nice i love the playing features like landing gear and back door perhaps just cause i had to get along with so called landing gears in the past that did not work at all 7140 for example and i simply love that there is space inside you said there is not really some cause of the landing gear mechanism but it seems it should be easily fixed do you think there is enough space to put some plates over the landing gear and add some beds kitchen und tv i think this set is so perfect to mod it into a clone wars mobile home your back garden ist just perfect for this i prefer this over the atte and over a 2nd gunship thanks a lot for the review	positive
zzz on aug 12 2008 0900 pm said and i simply love that there is space inside you said there is not really some cause of the landing gear mechanism but it seems it should be easily fixed do you think there is enough space to put some plates over the landing gear and add some beds kitchen und tv i think this set is so perfect to mod it into a clone wars mobile home your back garden ist just perfect for this it does have that homely feel there is room inside with technic beams to lay plates etc on the only issue is that its kind of fiddly to access you could do it from either the side door or rear door though maybe move that tow line at the back i have to say it is a set that grows on you	positive
thank you sveltecorps for the review i like the inside nice and cosey i also like your little garden for me this put the twilight different in a better perspective than my first perspective of the twilight i voted outstanding greets theforce	neutral
i will not be picking this one up the main thing is that it simply looks akward it is big and bulky and seems to have random pieces on it with not reall streamline feel to it i also agree that for an exclusive that it 100 it needs more than just 35 mini figures anikan and ashoka and rotta already come in the atte which is cheaper and has more figures r2d2 is a figure that i am sure everybody has at least 4 or 5 of for that kind of money i expect something with at least one unique figure and more than 4 i also want just a cleaner and better designed set this is probably the letdown of the collection so far every collection needs one	negative
thanks for yet another awesome review quote seems like tlc has done a pretty accurate representation of the ship the real fault for the ships messy design has to go to lucasfilm not tlc my guess is lucasfilm is trying to recapture that what a piece of junk magic of the millennium falcon i guess well have to wait to see the movie to see if they succeeded or not this sums up my opinion exactly i can easily admit that the design of the kit is spot on  but unfortunately the actual design of the ship in the new movie is garbage actually despite the millennium falcons odd design i really think its a pretty appealing ship  and its really cool i cant say the same for the twilight though	negative
dovchenko on aug 13 2008 1229 pm said looks fine but still that designs quite a downer but look at that wing design its lovely looks exactly like the b29 bombers wings look like	negative
thanks for the review i for one will get this set i collect and therefore i need it i vision something like this a i buy the set b i built the set c pics for my bs account d set taken apart sad but true its not much but super for parts i agree from what your review showed me that this set is a little too much technic a thing thats been invading our beloved brick built sets in the past years i really have no need for a retractable front or functioning landing gear what i need is a kickass ship with neat design and cool interior the twilight does not offer that look at the size of that thing	negative
good review there my daughter loves the backyard garden of the twilight my opinion of the ship has changed after reading this thanks	positive
quote part 3 a closer viewb closeup of the main body of the ship fronton it is welldesigned how the figs appear in line of sight unlike the 6211 where jabba and leia were photoshopped in to the box art dont ask what rotta is doing out of the line of vision there some things are better left unsaid quote rotta can i get on your knee to look outside anakin no rotta can i pull this lever anakin dont touch it rotta i want to drive anakin if your not quitting i will get you back to that mean white woman rotta i need a clean diaper anakin ashoka get of the toilet its my turn to get some rest ashoka i thought i would become a padawan not a babysitter quote the rear deck is so large that it is wasted just being used so ahsoka can bungeejump i came up with a much better use for it outdoor garden despite having one roboticised hand anakin was still quite the green thumb and his lightsaber was very useful as a hedge trimmer so much so that he set up a side business between rottarescue missions heres a promotional postcard and to finish on a light note id like to remind you that you do get another ahsoka hairpiece which can be used for all sorts of things ugha warrior upgrade dr inferno hair transplant and finally attack of the deadly blueringed octopus native to australias beaches and oceans thanks for reading quote lol the garden would be lovely to see in gardeners world never thought patrick star also liked gardening	neutral
hard to find in italian shops i had a friend buying one for meas soon as the set was available i always wanted another one so while in switzerland see kimts 7009 review for the full story i bought two for 5 €uros you get two knights a skeleton and a skeleton horse some hand weapons and a shooting device please remember dont aim at the eyes just great	positive
this is an awesome set in my opinion i scraped my crossbows for mocing recently but the set is still an amazing army builder for the price for the sw battlepacks which have 4 minifigs and a cheap vehicle you get 4 knights  this is 2 sets to equal the price of a bp  2 skellys and 2 skelly horses plus 4 crossbows 4 good wheels and some other good dark blue and brown pieces for my ever expanding castle town great buy	positive
lovely set nice collection of weapons cool horseaccesoires for the white knight cool black skeletal horse on the dark knights side loving the printed armours of both knights and as opposed to kimt apparently i really dig the black helmet i feel theres a lord of the ringsflavour to it with those curves well designed	positive
i should really get one more of these for the figures shields and weapons this set is the only one with the scythe in pearlgrey by the way the only thing that puzzles me is why would a crown knight joust a skeleton good question for a joust to make sense this set should contain two human knights instead  which would be fine with me so long as they had differing armour and colours edited by tenorikuma 13 august 2008  0351 am	neutral
im not a huge fan of this set but it is a great way to nab a fully mounted knight complete with a very attractive barding given that in prior years it wasnt possible to get a barded horse in such a small set this set is actually a decent way to build a mounted cavalry for your kingdom looking at bricklink it would probably cost as much to buy the knight horse and weapons separately and that doesnt take into account the skeleton or the extra bricks despite my indifference to this set i actually have purchased four of them in the past year simply because there isnt a cheaper way to acquire a mounted knight a quick question about the poll are we voting on the quality of the set or the quality of the review later edited by blueandwhite 13 august 2008  0550 am	neutral
blueandwhite on aug 13 2008 0549 am said a quick question about the poll are we voting on the quality of the set or the quality of the review later the quality of the set feel free to comment on the review andor set also	neutral
this set is a great little bundle the kitted out knight skellie knight weapons and the few bricks for the fence and weapon rack the castle 07 barding here is very nice indeed the colour scheme of the new castle guys is great imo the light blue and blue work nicely together and against the grey background i dont really like the pearl grey helmet  it would be nicer in metallic silver like the visor i think interesting comment re the skellie helmet  i guess black normal knights helmet with visor would be quite nice for him i got this set as part of the complete castle collection from sh however i have extras of all the smaller sets and skeleton tower except i dont have another one of this set its on my list of sets to buy unfortunately it wasnt on sh for ireland when i was making later orders  quite an odd omission also last year castle 07 was exclusive to argos uk catalogue retailer who only had three sets not the joust i should see if the local toy store has it now though as they did stock some 07 castle in addition to 08 at the start of the year i think small sets like this should be well stocked in shops for a year or two  it surely doesnt do their sales much good to be so sporadically available sorry turned into a bit of a ramble anyways the point is that this set is good enough id pick up another the cobra that sucks about customs i try to keep my orders to within the €23 dutyfree limit for here in ireland if your imports are waylaid you pay 20 import duty 21 sales tax and a postage fee for the diversion to customs nasty edited by brickzone 13 august 2008  1115 am	positive
kimt on aug 13 2008 0500 am said the quality of the set feel free to comment on the review andor set also thanks  the set is average its useful for picking up a few knights but im not really partial to the skeleton the idea of a knight and a skeleton tilting just strikes me as being odd my biggest issue with the current castle line is that most sets force you to purchase a mixture of skeletonsknights orcsknights orcsdwarves etc this is fine for those of you who love your fantasy however it makes the line a bit underwhelming for the rest of us still as mentioned earlier the set does have an upside so it is worth a purchase the review on the other hand is aces with great photos and a detailed description of the set and its contents nice work	neutral
tenorikuma on aug 13 2008 0348 am said i should really get one more of these for the figures shields and weapons this set is the only one with the scythe in pearlgrey by the way except its just plain darkgrey you must have gotten this set mixed with another though ive never heard of a pearlgrey scythe	neutral
perhaps he meant the pearl light grey lance which is not that common	neutral
brickzone on aug 14 2008 0742 pm said perhaps he meant the pearl light grey lance which is not that common could be its not that uncommon its in several sets now red is uncommon	neutral
good review kimt pictures are clear and show each of the pieces in great detail i agree with your comments as well im a bit curious does the knights helm have a hole for plume ive been debating whether to purchase this set or not im not a big fan of horses so ill likely barely use them but i do like the unique minifigs weapon rackweapons and the fact that the divider has a few useful pieces that can be added to other sets however i just dont feel the set is worth 8 when compared to crossbow attack and the knights catapult unless the buyer is really wanting some mounted minifigs luckily amazon just lowered their price of this set from 8 to 6 along with another 20 if using bill me later just in case anyone was also in the same situation i was in at that price its damn well worth it	positive
dj2005 on aug 29 2008 1126 am said im a bit curious does the knights helm have a hole for plume i can answer on behalf for kimt if memories served me right yes there is a hole for placing the knights plume do correct me wrong if i had answered wrongly its been awhile since i last touched my castle sets thanks kimt for this fine review this is one of the castle sets which i had bought high volume mainly for its horses barding and the weapons a great army builder and accessories for your castle armies this is an instant 5	positive
first things first the knights helm does have a spot for a plume now i really like this set and it was the first one i dug into when i got my collection in the mail it has a great selection of equipment for good or evil figures and the barding for the horse is outstanding my only wish was for one of the long chrome swords for the knights i think the new knights with the tall shield and chrome sword look excellent on foot and on horseback it would definitely be neat to revisit this set with another human knight instead of the skeleton make that change and add a lady to joust for and itd be bang on	positive
indexed name holiday villa theme lego system  town year 1988 pieces 197 minifigs 2 price usd  there were quite a few sets in the 1980s that werent sold in the us i remember reading once that it was because they contained wine glasses and tlg felt they wouldnt be able to market a toy that encourage the drinking of alcohol this set was one of them i remember seeing this in a catalog that came with a fabuland set and wondering what it was and where i could get one i wrote to lego and got an overseas catalog which had the futuron 6990 monorail transport system in it before it was available in the us i was amazed i ended up buying 6349 holiday villa from that catalog but for some reason gave it to my best friend for his birthday ive always wanted this set and finally bought it from bricklink this year my purchase included everything except the box i really like the boxes but in lieu of a boxshot here is the instruction manual i imagine this was the image on the front of the box the parts one of the things that appealed to me about this set is its abundance of rare parts this base plate is an excellent piece and was only available in two sets classic lego telephone technically these blue windows 1 x 4 x 5 windows are only available in this set according to bricklink it was available in different form with and without fixed glass trans blue glass in other sets regardless this size and color window is rare and the blue door was only available in 4 sets this was a huge selling point for me as im a window monkey never heard that term its like a parts monkey a collector who buys mulitples of sets just for parts or large lots of bulk from bl and sorts them into bins but just for windows tell your friends i coined the term these sloped windows have endless possibilities in many themes maybe not with the curtain decals applied but are another great rare part that appears in this set the build remember this piece id like to see a badass agents car built on this car base  i am a fan of the sixwide car but i see the appeal of the four wide it has a very nostalgic feel to it theres no denying that this is a beauty of classic lego 4wide cars this set comes with two minifigures one of which appears to be a painter classic vintage lego figs onto the house which begins with the basic floorplan a kitchen thats open to the rest of the house and a little oven and hood vent is one of my favorite touches its one thing to throw an oven into a house set but the designer of this set made it a cool part of the architecture of the house which gives it a unique feel the completed first floor and carport i do wish the sides of the roof were white with a little overhang like an actual roof this method of white on bottom red on top looks more like a childs drawing than a real house this is easily fixed with some modifying still you get a lot of roof pieces in this set here we have the completed set the husband cleans the yard while the wife gets plastered on wine dont tell the american kids another angle working in the kitchen getting smashed before dinner i think she may have a serious problem the bedroom a little stark but the bed looks comfy overall shot of the interior rating playability 910 the possibilities are endless with drunky mcwinewine and husband really playability is up to the imagination of the player its a house not really very actionpacked design 9510 great design with plenty of rare parts love the classic car too loses half a point for the all red roof price na i believe this was inexpensive but since i have no proof i will have to leave this factor out of the overall rating overall 92510 classic sets like this all deserve 10s in my book but looking at it with an objective eye its excellent but not perfect	positive
this looks like a really great set i wasnt around in 88 to get it but i like it it actually has things inside the interior thanks for the review hinckley on aug 13 2008 0611 pm said there were quite a few sets in the 1980s that werent sold in the us hooray sort of in england we dont get in normal shops batman and spongebob sets and not at all  avatar sets and brickmaster but america gets all of these maybe its revenge for americas lego neglect in the 80s hinckley on aug 13 2008 0611 pm said i remember reading once that it was because they contained wine glasses and tlg felt they wouldnt be able to market a toy that encourage the drinking of alcohol this set was one of them they didnt want to encourage the drinking of alcohol in america but were fine encouraging it in other places maybe thats why my country has such a big problem with binge drinking or maybe not	positive
thats a great review of a great set hinckley i voted for outstanding  this set is simply amazing i regrettably dont own this set since its very hard to find on ebay andor the stickers are missing but nevertheless i hope that i one day will be able to get this awesome set  or even better  see tlg releasing a new city villa in a style similar to that brilliant set  klausdieter edited by klausdieter 13 august 2008  0630 pm	positive
nice set what a great find this is one thing i think the tlg has forgotten about the creator houses are nice but they are not really geared toward a town them no mini figs cars etc these sets were and that adds so much to a town layout it cant be overlooked i really like this i may have to start my ebay searching thanks hinckley	positive

this is my favourite house which i owned during my childhood although its in the crypt but i hope to build it back one day looking at your review makes me so envy of you to own a complete set the baseplate is very unique especially for its stoned pattern classic lego telephone is just so lovely especially when its printed the entire house layout is simple and very nicely constructed in fact the simplicity just showed how much lego could do with such parts there are many nice furnitures included in this set such as the little ovenstove dining table bed and car porch the little black car is a classic example of a true 4studs car i love this house very much and my verdict is a full 5 no doubt about it thanks hinckley for this lovely review	positive

this would be great for any pirate fan the extraback pack for the soldiers some spare owes for the row boats a female face for a wench and a rather simple raft for that unlucky pirate lost at sea over all a nice set i am a little confused by the dynamite though perhaps an easy way to go fishing or perhaps to clear a rock in the forseen future or is it that she is just a suicide bomber attacking the white house water joke not ment to be tasteless or offensive to those lost in the act of terrosim greatest respect to those who have lost loved ones great review regards cpt pb	positive
overall an excellent set concerning the price range nice review whitefang	positive

glad some of you like this set for the wide variety of good accessories it seemed some are unfavour of the rafts design well i think for an impulse set the rafts design is quite good at least it took care of the color scheme well its just a simple raft for the adventurer to move onto the river stream and throw some dynamitte to blow some obstacles away cpt pegleg blockbeard on aug 14 2008 0329 pm said this would be great for any pirate fan the extraback pack for the soldiers some spare owes for the row boats a female face for a wench and a rather simple raft for that unlucky pirate lost at sea your comments make me feel like i has just done a pirate review instead of an extreme team review	positive

aerial recovery set  6462 theme town resq year released 1998 piece count 201 minifigs 3 list price 25 usd my personal favorite of the resq theme released in 1998 was this helicopter 6462 aerial recovery the set offered a pretty modern helicopter raft threewheeler rescue gurney and net and three figs including a diver the set is actionpacked and offers a high degree of play value starting with the box front side and back front back i always liked the rough oceansea water pictured in the boxart the same image from the front of the box appears on the cover of the instructions but the back of the instructions picture a plain view of the copter one sticker sheet with a few resq stickers is included mainly for the tail section of the helicopter interestingly the set includes three figures one being a diver what i always found strange is the inclusion of an xtreme team diver who has the logo on his torso although its a very nice fig back shot i think this was my first set with a lego threewheeler i always liked it a lot the set includes a yellow raft also found in the divers sets and some scuba gear note the raft has a black piece in its center for lifting up by the helicopter for sea and emergent rescue a gurney can also be lifted by the helicopter the set also includes a net with hook to lift the threewheeler and other items an extra string pulls the net closed heres a shot of the helicopter the front section has a large trans blue piece enclosing the cockpit inside is a printed radar slope a smaller trans blue piece appears a bit higher for access to the middle section of the helicopter andor a small storage area in the middle section is an place for the gurney and a box for storing some of the adventure gear heres a picture showing the gurney on the side is a pulley mechanism that swings to the right when not in use on the opposite side is the winch to raise and lower the grappling hook heres a picture of an open storage box i like the tail section with propeller decal is not shown heres another shot of the copter from a different angle and the final image the entire set final thoughts personally i think this is pretty nice set i like the thought of using the helicopter to rescue people at sea using the working winch extras like the trikethreewheeler and the rescue net make the set even more fun hope you enjoy this resq review	positive
thanks for this review thebrickster i also have this set and think its one of the best helicopters tlg made in the 90s its quite big and has got place for 2 minifigs in the cockpit i also like the fact that theres a victim included in form of the xtreme diver which also is a theme i always loved as a kid do you have any other resq sets left to review it would be an honour for me to also do a review of one or more sets which are left but unfortunately i got not much time at the moment	positive
metalandi on aug 15 2008 0716 am said do you have any other resq sets left to review it would be an honour for me to also do a review of one or more sets which are left thanks metalandi this and the emergency evac set are the only req sets i have i would encourage you to share a review as you have done some very nice reviews	neutral
i got this set as well as a resq hovercraft this set is cool because of all the accessories and it come with a x team guy your set is also in much better condition than mine you have made me decide to rebuild it another great review thebrickster keep up the good work	positive
this helicopter is so cool and i agreed with you that this is a high playablity set its not common to see such a big scale helicopter which has two cockpits back then the color scheme works well for me with so much features such as the lowering of the grappling hook storage box storing of the gurney and etc one thing which can be improved onto the helicopter is the rotors it could be extended a little longer as the size of the helicopter is too big it makes the rotors rather weak as it is not able to support the weight i am confused why there is an extreme team personnel there i thought he was supposed to be recovered from the resq team although there is so many questions in my head such as why include the black tricycle bike extreme team and etc but this is still one very good set to play with too bad i had never seen this before somehow through your review i like it very much the only big scale helicopter which i owned is the 7738 coast guard helicopter and lift raft neverthless i gave this a 4 thanks brickster	positive
the helicopter looks nice and the resq minifigs were nice the diver minifig had once been a personal favorite of mine	positive
a neat set with lots of accessories but i never liked any of the lego helicopters with long streamlined canopies as they are obviously more influenced by military helicopters and space ships than by real civilian transport helicopters id give it a 3 at best very good and thourough pictorial review though	positive
ive always wanted this set and the hovercraft too bad i never did great set	positive
i stopped collecting lego sets in the early 90s because of this kind of sets ive always been a classic town fan and i really didnt liked the futuristic design of tlcs newer sets	negative
i think the set is too unrealistic i like the new resq sets better and im somewhat a lifeboat freak so im always following such a sets with interest i would like to see some rigit inflatable boats some day  but about the chopper i like the accessoiries	negative
metalandi on aug 24 2008 0417 pm said what exactly makes you feel this set isnt realistic since the question was asked 1 tiny rotors 2 dual cockpits only seen on a few military copters 3 stretcher extends beyone edges of fuselage when inside the vehicle 4 extra long canopy really only seen on military helicopters and military design 5 black colorscheme for rescue vehicle the the stretcher minifig designs and rescue logo are the only things about this copter that really suggest that it is a civilian rescue aircraft its a toy set with alot of play value but i agree with karto that these kind of desgins really turned me off to alot of the town and city sets of the 90s on the positive side the new city sets with thier realistic nonfuturistic designs have really tempted me to buy more vehicles	neutral
it took quite some time but now im finally continuing with city reviews this one beeing about a really good set of the resq theme and also one of my favourites of this theme it brings a lot of playability and an incredible amount of useful pieces even with only 145 bricks in complete set nr 6451 name river response number of minifigs 3 number of pieces 145 release year 1998 price 20 usd back then when it was new unfortunately i havent got the box of this set anymore but the instructions are still there in good condition we get 3 resq minifigs in this set from which i really love the detailed torsos a shot of the complete set with both the boat and the little car off board the before mentioned car is really really little but it still got enough space to transport 2 minifigs a closeup of the rubber dinghy the speed boat as standalone as already said before this set brings a big count of equipment and accesoires with it which is really good for a set this size in the middle section of the boat there is enough space for a minifig to sit in and put on his diving equipment and last but not least a shot from the whole set wirh everything attached at the front section you can see a wench which also adds a lot to the set when i got this set back in the day i was really happy about it and for sure spent a lot of tie playing with it because of its great features as the wench in the front of the boat or the car the boat can transport i hope you like my little review stay tuned for more in the next days edit i forgot the poll can sombody add it please i dont know how to do or if it is possible to do that myself edited by metalandi 15 august 2008  0359 pm	positive
this set was my first set ever from the resq series and i loved it entirely ofcourse i modded it slightly here and there after hours and hours of fun and excitement it has great play value even for a set in this size	positive

6004 crossbow cart review because i may start collecting castle here is a review of one of my few castle sets please note i hurriedly put his together meaning some parts are the wrong color look out for them this review will also be done in my star wars review style the lighting is also particularly bad in the pics on with the review parts 20 figs 1 price  1overview and fig the whole set the fright knights knight the disemboweled knight the head printing is just longer then the helmet visor 2 the cart the cart has 3 crossbows and 2 norman type shields the carts advanced defense and weapons systems all the parts from the cart forgot to add the fig in 3extras  overall here are all my castle figs remember i dont collect castle yet  oh yeah i forgot to put one of the old skellies and a ghost on there could a castle fan tell me if any of these minifigs are rare i have no idea because i dont collect castle build 610 pretty standard for a impulse minifigs 710 nice minifig with lots of accessories design 810 this set made way for some of the new castle carts of similar size parts 1010 3 crossbows 2 shields arrow quiver and spear as well as cool minifg in a 20 piece set price 1010 well i dont know but lego was cheaper in 97 so it gets 10 playability 55 pretty much standard for a impulse set overall 810 good parts and price as well as minifig scores this set an 8 thanks for reading	positive
nice review i collect castle too and the ghost isnt really rare i have one too but its not really found anymore so it would be a good thing to keep it anyway great review edited by mammymarf 15 august 2008  0848 pm	neutral
about the rarest one up there is that black ninja i only have one ninja and he is dark grey i also have five samurai the witch may be fairly rare but i am not sure i didnt really collect much in the fright knight era	neutral
very nicely done  this cart is a striking resemblance to the crossbow cart we got in 2007	positive
thanks for the review ive added it to the index im not a fan of this theme but i have to say that this is a neat little set that does hold some good things figs and weapons are always welcome and one can never have to many wheels so i rate this average	neutral
this is a pretty nice set i really like the torso and its genericness so it can be used for other factions and at least this set has 2 shields althought i prefer the triangular ones instead of just 1 shield you get from crossbow attack from the wrong fraction id have liked a crown knights shield 100x better some improvements for this set would be a normal bow and a sword instead of 2 of the 3 crossbows smaller wheels and triangular shields 45 from me actually 35 but ill round it up	positive
i gave it above average it was a nice set and included some nice pieces but it is only an impulse set after all edited by newright 19 august 2008  0106 pm	neutral
originally shared in the history  adventure forum for its adventure attributes heres my favorite of the outback collection first let me say that this little set is one of my alltime favorites because it can be used to sumplement a number of different themes 1 the set makes a great little adventure airstrip for adventurers and more recent the indiana jones theme see also german headquarters and port adventure ive also used the set as an addition to my wild west town the tan baseplate and windmill works great just subtract the plane modern equipment and figs and lastly as the set was intended as an outbackdesert airstrip set description outback airstrip set  6444 pieces 157 minifigs 3 release date 1997 original price 20 usd starting with the box and the backside notice the alternate models i love the swamp boat the building is my favorite part of the set it is simple has a little detail two great roof pieces and a single green window great piece check out the great windmill piece its my only one and makes a great part for wild west and that farm you always wanted to build i used it for the barnhouse of barnabas higgens and spring valley ranch on the side of the building is a great radio and a clear glass unfortunately no furniture can be found within the building and now the airplane front view i love the twin propellors side view and the rear section the back has a small cargo hold for some boxesfreight or some gear needed in the outback the set includes three figs two with cool shades and some great equipment i love the boom box a shot of the whole set and another summary as i mentioned above this set is very versatile and can suplement a few different themes its my personal favorite of the outback collection and im really glad i was able to find the set in the late 90s i almost didnt buy sets like this are timeless and so much fun to build and display hope you enjoy the review edit additional reviews review by agentrick57 december 24 2007 outback airstrip review in history  adventure forum february 10 2008	positive
this is really an ideal small set in spite of its size it has nearly everything • three minifigs • a vehicle • a building • numerous minifig accessories • numerous rare and useful parts • nice model design especially for the time period too bad outback came out during my dark years	positive
the building is great and detailed with a few mods it could be added to my castle town i dont really like the plane though seems kind of abstract not really good in my opinion but i bet it would be easy to mod to look better	positive
legoman132 on aug 18 2008 0936 pm said this was a cool set i thoght of it as i was building the post plane interesting thought i have the post plane but i havent opened it yet i suppose its the yellow the plane in this set is much different than most of the other classic town airplanes in that it has the double tail section heres a shot of the new 7732 air mail set  definately a nice set	positive
whats wrong with another yoda and some nice light blue bricks i probably would destroy this set and keep the minifigs intack tough chrome lightsabers on	neutral
thanks for the review kimt oldies reviewsold sets  are always appreciated i feel this set isnt that great 1 yoda he is by far the best part of the set although is his weapon blue 2lord tyrannus pretty nice i feel the middle part of his torso is a bit bland but that isnt a problem i wish they would make a fleshie one too 3 speeder bike i always hated this design the back looks terrible to me way too bulky in my opinion it jusnt give me the image that its the same as the movie the lightsaber is amazing why is it only in this set 4yodalifter what that is terrible but at least it has some nicely colored parts a fine set but not the best imo	negative
no yoda was released in no less than 34 sets ok so i remembered wrong i just have plenty yodas and one is more than enough for the set list click here thanks for pointing that out	neutral
nice review i realy like this set two nice minifigs in an affordable set and i do like the speeder but that lift thing is strange but now at least i know what it is thanks for letting me know	positive
thanks for the nice review kimt  i like this set especially by the fact that it is the only set containing the dooku minifig and the curved lightsaber  i also think that the minifig is cool but i also own the dagobah xwing and the wookiee catamaran sets so i have enought minifigs a clone wars version would be very cool  and the extrathingy is well just ok the bad part is that i dont buy the set when it is out and now is go for 40 on ebay and bricklink  edited by darkrebellion 18 august 2008  0951 pm	neutral
oky wan kenobi on aug 18 2008 0241 pm said wasnt this the only yoda that was ever released except for the one in the dagobahxwing set sure he is not the best fig with the unmovable legs and all but still its yoda edit im pretty sure we got a yoda in the wookiee catamaran set from revenge of the sith runs to check brickset yep theres a yoda in that set as well but the jedi duel is the only reasonably priced set with the green forceguru nevermind looks like a couple of other members already covered yodas availability in other sets back on topic great review and a real blast from the past i never did get this set just didnt care for the speederbike or the weird piece of equipment thanks for explaining that its supposed to be used to forcejump  spin yoda all over the place i never knew thats what it was for anyway wish i had known yoda and dooku were going to be impossible to get later i mayve picked this set up just for the minifigs edited by bamaker 18 august 2008  1039 pm	neutral
i missed out on this set but it looks pretty good imo thanks for clearing up what that thing was i thought it was something they flung at eachother in the movie i like the lightsaber also but why did they stop making chrome ones	neutral
i wonder how expensive this set would be on ebay shop victoriously	neutral
i missed this setbut i reallly like the yoda and count dookui especially like count dookus lightsaberone thing thoughis it me oris yodas lightsaber blue in the picture edited by pr0visorak 20 august 2008  1221 pm	positive
i was very lucky to get this set and i love it i dont have it built cause i bought it for parts but it was fun while it lasted 	positive
i got this set a long time ago the review pretty much says all there is to say about it never knew what the redbrown thing was anyway i used it as a canon isnt this also the only set up until now that had count dooku in it	neutral
great review kimt at that time it was still in my dark age and i hated myself not to get this set earlier this is quite inexpensive and you are able to get two greatest characters especially count dooku the minifigs are excellent especially the unique design of count dookus lightsaber i have no problem with the speedbike as it looks quite alright to me as for the elevation of yodas jump adds some playabilty but that does not work well for me nevertheless the main attractive factor is count dooku and i have to rate it a 5 i never own a yoda except for the magnet version	positive
cheers for the review kimt of the initial episode ii lego releases this set was the least inspiring but the minifigs were musthaves you cant go wrong with count dooku and yoda i like the design of dookus speeder in the movie but lego missed the mark a bit with it here and gave him a dodgy flying boat instead the speeder cradleyoda jumping mechanism was just a waste of parts unfortunately id like to see dookus speeder reimagined by lego theyve come a long way in the way they design a lot of the new star wars sets	neutral
i know we have another review of this set but since i just got it i thought i would share my comments on it set name droid gunship platform number 7678 pieces 329 price 2999 before we begin i will say that i like having a droid gunship but i still hope we get a maf hmp droid gunship maf droid gunship on to the review here we have the box it is really shiny and smooth and fits the sets size okay it has a clean bright look and is truley outstanding the back of the box which has the features of the set as well as the other three cw sets the contents the siticker sheet no to bad and the stickers have clear backs which is always nice instructions here we have the figstwo new droids and one older armed droid for the cockpit and the extra parts the build starts with the flat base pretty simple the bottom the side lasers next is the head it starts pretty soild the side buble laser turrets loveing the detail on the ship the lid and eyes the finished cockpit cozy interior would have had more room if it were the maf though the front landing gear simple and effective the back landing gear the rockets the clips are annoying but it make the rockets work so i guess it was nessecary mounted on the bottom not very secure but thats why they are meant to be dropped on the clones the finished ship  let me say that the droid gunship is a nice set indeed final rating 86 hope you enjoyed the review please if you have a ny questions pic requests etc then by all means ask best regards vbbn	neutral

hello all eurobricks members and classic town lovers  editors note to mark the celebration of classic town this set which is released in 1994 and rereleased as a legend in 2002 pizza to go review is dedicated to classic towns opening cermony and members such as hinckley brickster imperialshadows sinner and many others whom have contributed to the final success of classic town thank you so much for inviting me to be part of this wonderful project and i wish all the best to the success of classic town i urge everyone of you to check out classic town and take alook at the cool stuff we have done  today i will be doing up a review on pizza to go set this outlet is one of the most favourite eatery for any lego citizens living in their town when they are driving on the road they are sure to look out pizzeria signage they offer the best pizza in town no one in town can resist the delicious aroma of pizza coming out from the red chimney let us find out why is this shop so popular among so many lego citizens and was one of the famous sets that is rereleased under the legend theme pizza to go is my favourite set of all time i believed there is no other pizza outlet lying around in any lego city apart pizzeria it seemed there are the sole outlet that is selling pizza for many years this set was rereleased in 2002 and it is part of the legend theme this is one of the few sets that are highly demanded to be brought back by many fans of lego around the world i owned the 6350 any members whom had owned both sets before is there any difference between these two because when i searched through peeron it shown 144 pieces instead of 194 pieces for the 1994 set name pizza to go theme lego system  town year 1994 rerelease 2002 pieces 194 minifigs 3 an image of a 6350 pizza to go let the delivery begins pizza to go is the regular pizza outlet that sells nothing but pizza they deliever pizza to every household in town with their trusty delivery van walkin are welcomed too there is a stand for customers to dine in their pizza quickly before making their way to their next destination in my opnon no town can ever survive without the pizza tradition devoted pizzeria staff every outlet comes with 3 dedicated staff making sure that operations will run smoothly on the left we will have the pizza boy whom is wearing the regular blue dungarees and its white cap i wonder who is that boy on the middle we will have the pizza girl she looks like any typical sweet girl in town that the boys will look at she is wearing a suntop strapless on her she reminded me of one person though i think her name is called alice taking a careful look i wonder if imperialshadows is the pizza boy back then without that black patch on its left eye on another note this minifigure was my favourite female minifigures are very uncommon back then i am glad i have this figure adding to my town population on the right we will have the hardworking chef preparing the pizzas in the oven he wears the regular white chef outfit but he wear a grey pants instead of the usual fullwhite outfit in most resturants such as breezeway cafe 6376 lets take a closer look at the pizza boys van this van is very very small looking and very fuel efficient it is able to cut lanes very fast due to its small size the pizza van is made up of 4studs wide design no doors by the side however in this vehicle i think the doors is not a must to be included in this design our pizza boy will need to leave vehicle pretty fast and ensuring that the pizza delivery is on time common mechanism this van has the regular rooftop that can be lifted up to place the pizza boy into the driver seat there is a sun roof on its top which enable him to let him have some sunlight from above the logo on the side of it is actually a transparent sticker which have the pizzeria itallian logo and a tasty looking pizza on both sides of its van i like that sticker very much mine looks quite worn out over time if its a printed piece it will be a terrific bonus nevertheless i can still accept the sticker our pizza van can deliever up to 2 pizza at a go at every trip 2 piping hot pizza will be stored at the back of the van the pizza is fitted in perfectly in each compartment furthermore the white window shutter is terrific in this design you dont see this kind of design anymore i think i have not seen much delivery vans on the street anymore too base of the van from the base you can see that it is using of the regular red car base that is common in most 4studs vehicle design in fact this car base served as a foundation for its vehicle design back of pizzeria alice and the chef will be showing you around at the back of the kitchen there is an oven on the left a water tap and a holder for the oar stick looks pretty empty right look below for a surprise my favourite feature this oven can be used to heat up 2 pizzas at a go now i understand why this set is named pizza to go i have been using their slogan unknowingly this feature is superb nice now we know that the pizza is prepared from the outlet instead of using delivery van to collect it from a factory alice what are you waiting for help the chef quickly pizzeria the signage sure looks big from far and catches their attention easily too with its pleasnt looking design as you have already noticed this is made up of sticker i dont mind for this set it contains sticker sometimes i do hope they can give us spare sticker for us to change after a long period of time distinct red chimney this is the front of the oven and that is where the smoke comes out using only bricks to construct this is simply wonderful i like the use of their white bricks to construct the wall layout and a combination of red parts especially on the top i like the look of this very much another picture on its side printed parts in this set you will get a total of 5 pizzas and i believed no other sets offer so many pizza you can placed up to 4 pizzas in the van and oven alice will be carrying the last pizza around the green and red round dish is a printed part most exclusive part in 635010036 the most unique and important printed parts that is only exclusive in this set its at the front of the pizza van it is none other but the pizzeria logo standing at the front of the delivery van forgotten to take a picture of this piece took it from peeron different views of pizza to go outlet another bright sunday day in pizza to go summary review playability 1010 a lot of playing by doing up the pizza process from preparing to delivery design 9510 outstanding design with great use of bricks i like the structure of it very much price 9510 an inexpensive set based on the 1994 pricing it comes with 3 minifigs shop a van and a exclusive printed piece overall 9710 i am not trying to be bias in fact this set is absoultely filled with minimum flaws look at my review again if you are not satisfied with it or tell me what you dont like i gave it a 5 based on my review score card what about yours hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelfwhen

great review i really like this set and plan on getting it on bricklink it would certainly add something to my collection	positive
i got the original version as a surprise one christmas my parents liked the design so much they got it for me this is one of the best town sets if it didnt have the delivery van it would have been on par with 6683 hamburger stand a great set in its own right the van and they way the back holds the pizzas is ingenious and bumps this set up to the highest levels	positive
i remember having this set when it was originally released a good few years back but i dont think i have it anymore i remember i thought it was really awesome though i thought the oven and pizza storage in the back of the car were the greatest parts the little sink on the inside was cool too didnt realise they had made a legends set out of it id love to own this set again but misb examples on bricklink go for an extortionate amount of money ah well se la vie	positive
i used to want this set so badly and i almost got it when it was rereleased i still wonder why i didnt because with a building van 5 pizzas and a then very rare female fig this set would have been perfect for someone with a smaller collection like i had then what surprised me the most is how well this set still holds up to others today off to bricklink	positive
definitely one of my favorite sets from my childhood i still remember my sister getting it for me for my birthday and me building it that same day too bad i had it displayed all these years on my windowsill so the pizza delivery van and pizzeria have become yellowed	positive

indexed allright hi everybody again today im gonna review the biggest set of the resq subtheme 6479 emergency response center with this one i think the reviews of all the resq sets are complete now and while im in a reviewing mode right now i thought id bring that up this set hast got many nice aspects and also some very rare pieces and comes with a wonderful amount of vehicles including a speedboat a tow truck a helicopter and a trike which can pull a little boat so sit down get your popcorn and beer were off to stormy weather at the coast subtheme resq set nr 6479 name emergency response center number of minifigs 5 number of pieces 420 release year 1998 unfortunately i dont have many of the boxes of my resq sets anymore so ill start right off with the instructions this time on the backside there is no alternate model as usual this time but only a different shot of the whole set next a general overview sorry about the slightly bad picture quality on some pics this time originally this set has 5 minfigs which all are really nice but the guy who drives the tow truck has been lost in the flood heres a picture of the missing fig lets move on to the vehicles we have something for the water the ground and the air in this set first the great tow truck i love the mechanism with the hooks in the back next on da speedboat at the rear its got a stretcher and a wench which adds a lot of playability if theres a a little accident near the coast the trike comes to appearance for more complicated stuff we have a little helicopter i broke the rotating piece at the top yesterday ouch   no space for a victim you say well not really but the helicopter also got a wench with a hook in the back now it comes to the station itself at the docks a neat life belt sign is mounted remember at this time there werent real ones as today a little more right an equipment holder is placed with various tools on the front and fire fighter equip at the back at the very front a little lighttower secures the shelter i havent quite found out what this thing is supposed to be maybe somebody knows another equipment holder this time with all the stuff you need for diving more equipment and even more we come to the hear piece of the station the control room with lots of buttons and scrrens last but not least a quick shot of all the accesoires and tools that you get which really is an amazing amount this set might have a few junioriced pieces as the big window in the front or the briedge on the roof but that doesnt matter because there is nearly one other set in which you get so much rare pieces and such an overwhelming amount of accesoires so i can recommend that for everybody who is a piecesfanatic not to forget the playability the great figs and the in my opinion very good color scheme once again thanks for taking the time reading and looking at my review i hope you liked it edited by thebrickster 31 december 2009  0919 pm	positive
i own this set and its one of my favourites simply because of the cool colour scheme which you mention plus all the vehicles and accessories the resq theme is one of my faves of all time actually i own nearly all of them missing a small set that was only available in the us or japan i think dr s	positive

baby i will like to take a moment to said outstanding piece of review for your first attempt you have done well with the pictures and its flow i have to admit that i love this fighter tank very much the downside of it which is overpriced and two clone troopers do not really justify the purchase well if i have the spare cash i will defintely get one of this keep it up	positive

right so heres my review finally the whole gallery of box parts minifigs and finished model is here over 2 pages so on with the show minifigs httpwwwbrickshelycgii1340864 in the set you get krakaroff i dunno how to spell it and victor krum the figs are exactly the same bar their heads these are two fantastic figures the expression on krakaroffs face is priceless judging by the design i think we might get a yellow krakaroff cropping up somewhere which would make me a happy bunny hed make a fantastic viking ideally id have liked more than 2 figures for my money three would have done it i think 2 is too few piece count httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344573 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344571 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344572 for a 40 set the piece count is quiet good i dont know the exact number but when building it i didnt feel short changed bar the exception of the hull now i dont hate the hull my problem is that is doesnt connect with bricks like the old pirate ships there are pros and cons to this on the plus side its more secure and your whole ship doesnt need to be taken up with support structure the negative side being you cant really make it bigger as theyve only released a megablocking 4 set with the right piece and its the wrong color i also like how its wide meaning you can fit loads of minifigs on the main deck overall though i liked the pieces of note are gold studs httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344510 5 in total you get one spare the return of the black falcon shields httpwwwbrickshelycgii1340835 and the new drumstrang shields the construction a simple fun build nothing too fiddly the finished model httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344474 big picture i really like this set theres no bones about it it seems lego with the latter half of 2005 have given people who loved their original pirate ships hope for the future with this and the fantastic viking longboat even with the two 4 pieces the hull and front of the ship i wasnt put off httpwwwbrickshelycgii1340841 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344461 the front of the ship is a nice piece and can be used for stuff like castles httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344490 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344491 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344492 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344494 and the hull isnt all bad what i really liked was the little cargo hold at the moment i have a treasure chest in there but there space for about eight of them i reckon playability wise it does make alot of sense and as you can see you can imprision minifigs below deck httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344484 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344488 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344506 httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344500 the quarters are great as well you can comfortably fit about six minifigs in the main gally three by the steering wheel and a couple up above the top cabin you could fit more but itd look strange my only gripe is the design of the top cabin when you want to open it up you have to remove the mast i know its simple enough but i think that it wouldnt have taken much for tlc to design it better but saying that its easily done and i like how the cabin can be lifted with ease from the steering deck httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344540 the final play feature is the plank you can while away the hours murdering hapless minifigs whove displeased the cabin a really nice addition for pirate fans the final verdictb playability 9510  lots to do for all the kids piece count 910 a great selection loses one for the hull figures 810  just needs one more construction 910  nice and simple value 8510  let down a bit by lack of minifigs and the cons of the hull boverall 8810 overall this is a set worth getting especially if you miss proper pirates it wouldnt take much to turn this into an amazing pirate ship moc hope you liked my review matt	positive
i received this set with a 25 gift card so it was a great buy it follow with a similar build to the 2007 trucks but has a few improvements of course the name of the set could have been a bit more creative and yes this was an academy review set name truck and forklift number 7733 pieces 343 theme city year released 2008 price 2500 usd 1999 gbp 2400 euro 1box now the box follows a design similar to most other city sets it has the set information and photo of the set on the front sorry for it getting cut off i will remake it now the back of the box shows what each bag builds bag 1 is for the forklift bag 2 is for the cab and bags 3 and 4 are for the containers it also has the sets features 2contents the instructions there are 2 books included with the set one for the forklift and one for the truck minifigure1 the first minifig you build is a simple cargo worker interestingnew parts here we have some interesting and new parts they include a yellow seat a 1x2 plate with clips and a 1x4 slope 3the build cargo1 the first cargo palette has a few crates on it i really like the sticker on the small box forklift the forklift is a very fun extra to build and it is probably the best forklift that we have had so far it is very realistic and is very strong cargo2 the next piece of cargo is some octan barrels on a meter i am not sure what it is supposed to be but it is still a nice addition to the set minifgure2 the second minifigure is a classic driver with sunglasses and a coffee mug very nice new piece this is a very nice new piece that is included in the set a hollow canopy i believe it is also in white with the police mobile command station truck now anyone who has had one of the lego city harbor sets from last year then you will probably find this build to be very similar mostly in the cab part of the truck the trucks build is very solid and very realistic i sense ths will bring the ratings up quite a bit mystery cargo for some time specualtion has been going around what exactly is this it seems like nuero poison i am very happy with those 2x2 cylinders in transyellow in fact you can join in and guess what it may be in this topic containers the first container is built to hold one palette it fits onto the truck it produces a very pleasing result and has a better look to it than the containers from last year had the second container has the ability to hold two palettes and has a design similar to the first then you build on the wheels the back ones have beautiful mudflaps finshed set  parts 1010 lots of useful pieces great colors and some very cool new pieces minifigs 810 i would have liked another but it was 25 so i guess its okay price per part 1010 almost 350 pieces for 25  playability 810 forklifts are always fun and there are lots of things to do with this set overall 3640 90 a this is truley an outstanding set and it will make a great addition to anyones collection mocers would aslo like this due to the fact that it has some really nice parts it has a great build and utilizes some awesome new techniques it also has details something you might look for in a set highly recommended hope everyone enjoyed the review if you have any pic requests questions etc please ask i look forward to hearing your comments and the judges comments as well 7733 peeroncom 7733 bricklink catalog 7733 shop at home	positive

nice work vbbn im not really into technic myself but youve definately done a fine review on this set funny that it actually fits a minifig perhaps well see fans design forklifts with technic and having it minifig sized	positive

the ywing is the work horse of the rebel alliance it’s well armed and heavily armoured but you’ll need it because you’ll be moving like a sleepy hut – general rieekan set name ywing starfighter set number 7658 number of pieces 454 figures2 released 2007 list price £3999 lets us begin with the box the front shows it in all it’s swooshing glory httptdyorgukimages765802jpg the back shows some of the many features of the set and also others you might like to buy in the star wars range after opening the box we find a single instruction booklet now we come to an important aspect of any star wars set the figure here we’re provided with an anomalous rebel pilot and his faithful r5 droid the pilot comes with the fairly standard lego star wars nonhero helmet printing what’s he going to do with the blaster taken on the entire empire one of the more interesting parts is the assembly of the engine which if like me you don’t pay enough attention to the instructions when building you can end up getting wrong the key detail i got wrong just before fitting the last engine if we look carefully on the side we can see a missile launcher i didn’t think torpedoes or concussion missiles were fired from there but i may be wrong after fitting the engine the models looks like this in all it’s glory manning one of the alliance’s fighters not so ready to take on the empire was he so overall we have a well designed model which is in my opinion far superior to the original we were offered with darth vader way back when lego star wars was new this ywing is sleek and looks great in my opinion the firing missiles are also a great touch the rating system figures 510 for the same price the last xwing had far more figures parts 610 swooshability 9510 design 910 price 310 grand total 32550 not to shabby conclusion so finally the answers to the questions you’ve no doubt want to know is the set worth the price i’ll be frank £3999 is too much for this set despite this i currently have a squadron of three ywings the reasons is this set has been on sale a number of times at £30 it’s certainly worth the money lego recently placed them online with a price of £20 this i think was a great price for the set and well work picking one or more up if you wanted to start your own rebellion	neutral

ive built the ywing and the imperial landing craft 7659 more or less at the same time and for about the same prices i think the imperial landing craft ilc is much superior to the ywing the ywing doesn’t have much functionality besides an awkward dropping bomb device and a moving cannon the missiles firing system is … your fingers the ilc has an awesome missiles firing system i wish i could get it individually for mocs a clever bomb dropping mechanism 5 minifigures with weapons the wings fold up together and the “cargo” can be detached as a play set i’ve built the ilc first so i got quite disappointed with the ywing	neutral

i like the model it is one of the best rebel sets out there but i dont like it that there is no landing gear when you set this one on the floor your rebel base it looks like it crashed or something and looses its look of superiority actually quite fast it needs to be at least 2 studs high if not more from the ground tlc is in these days afraid of flimsy landing gear as they gave to us in the early sw time now they want something sturdy for playability but i think there should have been some details on the bottom especially a landing gear that unfolds i also dont like the mistake of tlc that they changed this year with the release of indy hopefully to give the pilot a usual smile face the old yellow version of gold leader even had a headgear i hope tlc realised this year that we want more detailed faces well the licenced sets we got proved that but who knows the upsides of this set are the amount of pieces and detail especially the engines were fun to build and perhaps the most interesting construction i have seen in years also it is big bulky and looks sleek at the same time just wonderful and next to the 4502 xwing it looks in the perfect size i gave this the highest rating even if the underside disappoints but whatever it is lego you can add some landing gear on your own thanks for the review your pics were really really good next time make more of them please	positive

yodalikespie on 03 september 2011  0721 pm said is it worth the money since the new ywing comes out next year please check the date prior to asking questions in old topics three years ago in this case its rude to expect people to answer questions like that especially since its such a generic question besides how is he supposed to answer the question without knowing a lot more about the new ywing	neutral
etav8r on 19 september 2011  0316 am said is that a threat is it fair to ban someone on the forum because they revived an old thread and made inquiries thought this was a forum to discuss lego and that is what he was prompting i dont really care why he was banned but this isnt the only time ive seen this type of behavior and discourse here on eb not a threat at all  i was simply pointing out that yodalikespie made the mistake of inquiring about the new ywing before we had any information on it to my understanding its not so much the fact that he bumped the thread as the fact that he bumped it for no good reason im not certain where the moderators stand on this issue but i feel that yodalikespies question would have been better received had he posed it after a substantial amount of information had been gathered on 9495  as ive said there simply isnt much one can go off of at this point to determine its value relative to 7658	negative
fallenangel309 on 19 september 2011  0343 am said not a threat at all  i was simply pointing out that yodalikespie made the mistake of inquiring about the new ywing before we had any information on it to my understanding its not so much the fact that he bumped the thread as the fact that he bumped it for no good reason im not certain where the moderators stand on this issue but i feel that yodalikespies question would have been better received had he posed it after a substantial amount of information had been gathered on 9495  as ive said there simply isnt much one can go off of at this point to determine its value relative to 7658 roger that sad that the original review pics arent available any longer would be nice once the new set is released for comparisons	neutral
maybe the thread should be locked or taken down since the pics consist of broken links kind of a pointless review without the pics and for the record there are other websites with preliminary images of some the new 2012 sets that are not on the eurobrick star wars 2012 rumors thread perhaps that banned fellow was hoping some of the lego insiders had some knowledge about it i guess well never know now edited by sharky 22 september 2011  0922 pm	negative
and lo it came from the east denmark the set which had been foretold the cheap army builder and there was much rejoicing amongst the castle fans the cardinal then asked was all the rejoicing justified… set name the knight set number 5615 number of pieces 21 figures1 released 2008 list price £200 lets us begin with the box the front shows us are knight and his rack of arms the back shows us two sets from the castle range moving inside the box now the contents of the box it doesn’t look like much the instructions to help you through the build now the reason you probably bought the set well at least why i did the knight this features the new torso for 2008 and is the height of fashion this brings the number of printed torsos from the crown knights to three which allows for a greater variety in building your armies a new fashion sensation and all the must have accessories for this season with a more heavily armoured look he’s ready for anything the rest of the set is a weapons rack i assume that once you’ve got a few of these set you’ll probably like me give up building them and part them out but anyway here are some pictures of what the rest of the elements are spent on a long and complex build begins after 360 hour finally it’s finished sadly five minfigs were hurt in the construction of this rack now the money shot where we can see it all come together it looks great even the rack doesn’t look to bad sadly are hero wasn’t ready for other themes just yet in total we have a good army builder which castle fans have wanted however there remains a question in my mind as to if this set is good enough on it’s own without any other castle sets i can’t see it being to much fun so it’s not a good present the rating system figures 910 great new fashion for this season  parts 810 shield sword spear helmet and armour what more could i want well two shields fun fun fun 310 sadly it’s rather dull on it’s own i can’t think or to much else to do design 710 yes it’s the army builder i’ve wanted design well apart from that pirate one price 910 at £200 what more can i say grand total 3650 let down by being to small to stand alone conclusion so let’s answer the question is it the army all castle fans have wanted well yes and no is the answer while it is a great set and at the now reduced uk price of £200 amazing value i still think it’s inferior compared with the army building capability of cross bow attack i much prefer army building both factions at once	positive

do we really need more construction works legoland is just one huge building site theme city set name mini digger set number 7246 number of pieces 36 figures1 released 2005 list price 350 usd 7426 peeroncom 7246 bricklink catalog diving right in let get some photos of the box the digger at work the back just has more of the same not to inspiring once we open the box we find two poly bags and some instructions the total contents of the box well minus the air instruction booklet short and simple now the single minfig of the set nothing new of special that i can see …got a job working construction for the johnstown company moving onto the digger itself it’s one of those builds where all you really need is a quick glance at the instructions and off you go side view of the finished product alternative view it doesn’t look to bad now lets add our construction worker looks rather good though the lifting action isn’t smooth it’s nothing special it’s not the greatest construction set that lego have ever produced but i think it is worth the money the arm action really does bug me though the rating system figures 510 just another construction peon parts 410 nothing novel and i dislike the new digger arm system fun fun fun 710 i think the playability is high and you can get a good load of bricks in the bucket design 610 not the best designed digger but not the worst price 710 a reasonable price for what you get grand total 2950 still halfway decent but nothing to write home about conclusion this set is yet another in a long line of lego digger and to be honest it’s not the best in my opinion i still hold nostalgic memories for 6504 which i still think is a great digger from my point of view the set sits to high off the ground and make me wonder how the worker gets in i really don’t like the digging arm action it will never be smooth and while it poses better i just think it’s inferior despite this i still think it’s not a bad set i’d just like it to be so much more	negative
another fine review i love the last action picture thanks for sharing btw i am so looking forward to that 384 london bus review	positive
cardinal brick on aug 27 2008 1002 pm said …got a job working construction for the johnstown company one of the greatest songs ever written but now onto the review i really like your pictures the quality and lighting is amazing i never gave this set much attention but now it looks pretty good to me also cant wait for your next review i have never seen this bus before	positive
finaly we get a new mech for takeshi and yes its yellow it brings back some flashbacks of supernova good times anyways i recieved this set at christmas last year with 3 other ef sets set name assault tiger number 8113 pieces 163 theme exoforce year released 2008 price 1500 usd 1895 eur 1box the boxes this year are much different than those from previous years it has some gaps in it and has a cardboard backround inside of it the box itself shows assault tiger and the set information the back shows a combiner the cardboard backdrop a very nice jungle look to it it has lots of fog as well creating a pale effect 2contents the instructions the instructions are clear and straightforward also included is a lego blooper the remains of the sticker sheet the stickers arent too bad i didnt apply the saw sticker as i wanted it to be left plain the buzzsaw a very cool piece mocists will love this 3build the figures the figures included are takeshi who features a nice new torso also included is the mini robot his is a very neat little guy but sadly he doesnt really become a weapon more of a block of red and black bricks the torso now the torso design for assault tiger is very different from the past years it now uses a castlelike piece as the main structure also of note is that he has a mini throne no controls sadly and with the orange cockpit piece its impossible to see takeshi when looking at the at close on see the third pic the legs the legs are slightly similar to the mt201 ultra drill walkers but have been modified to fit the at they are quite large and suit their purpose the arms the arms follow a new design but the only problem is they have no elbow or hand articulation nice weapons though the finished product  parts 1010 lots of useful pieces great colors and some very cool new pieces minifigs 810 a robot would have been nice and a better weapon mode for the minirobot would have been good price per part 710 a stretch playability 810 the lack of elbow and wrist articulation isnt the greatest overall 3340 825 b assault tiger is a nice set but some of those small little things can truly take a toll on the final rating i think that i would only recommend this set to anyone who wants the yellow and hardcore exoforce fans sh link peeron link i hope you enjoyed the review and if you have any pic requests or questions please ask edited by sinner 01 september 2008  0152 am	positive
thanks for that good review vbbn that´s really a fine and pretty solid looking mecha i think that the designers did a good job on this last wave of ef sets and the inclusion of these mini robots was also a pretty smart idea	positive
nice to see a well done review this set is one of the few exoforce sets i havent built myself yet but i will get it on sale guess soon im do not like the use of slizerstyle balljoints in exoforce even though they are modified to 2x2 bricks in this particular set i think the arms look weak and they lack elbow joint like the green 2008 mech set forgot name of this years green mech quite a shame i find it really hurts the functionality of that green set and could imagine the same with the tiger i guess with the new pyramide brick as cockpit the cockpit is still open from the sides and the back i modified my green 2008 mech which use the same cockpit design with a few green bricks and it is now completely closed from all sides i rate the tiger at average but i may change my mind when i get to build it myself front	positive
the assult tiger is pretty cool	positive
since my last post ive had the chance to build the tiger and i was surprised in a good way a much better set than i actually thougth front	positive
i just bought 2 of them since they were 5 each from lego i really wish they did not cancel this series	positive
i voted average i think this is the least attractive among the 2008 exoforce sets i saved my money to buy some of the 2006 mechas	negative
what do you mean the troll’s should outnumber the crown knight how are you going to manage that well here’s the answer theme castle set name troll warrior set number 5618 number of pieces 19 figures1 released 2008 list price £250 gbp 350 usd 299 euro 5618 peeroncom 5618 bricklink catalog 5618 shop at home lets us begin with the box the troll warrior and his might cart set sets for children to pester for at christmas now for what’s inside the contents of the box it doesn’t look like much now for the troll himself i’m glad they selected this troll torso rather than the other one for the impulse set i think this one is the superior one also he comes well armed with a spear and sword but no shield sadly someone really needs to look at the rodent problem in the castle sets now the cart nice easy construction as with all impulse sets i’m still not convinced by the flicking missiles a line of those would do some damage what an oncoming army can expect to see all together now and it looks rather good so there we have it a cheap way of bolstering the troll army and outfitting them with some more weapons also for anyone planning a pied piper moc another set with a rat in it the rating system figures 810 preferred troll torso and helmet style  parts 710 two spears and a sword but sadly lacking that all important shield fun fun fun 410 somewhat more to do on it’s own that other impulse at least the troll can fight the rat design 710 well designed even the flicker missile doesn’t look bad price 810 at £250 more than the other castle impulse grand total 3450 lack of a shield and to small to stand alone for my rating system conclusion castle fans got a great army builder with the knight and they’ve been lucky enough to receive another one with this set i’m glad we’ve got a troll impulse as it allow for enlarging the armies of evil some the crown knight don’t totally outnumber all their opponents	positive
best impulse set so far thanks for sharing your thoughts and yes someone should look into that rodent issue ill add this to the index within long	positive
good review i got 2 of those wheels are very useful especially if you dont have any  as for shields  i dont imagine trolls use them too much i think that they fight berserk style  all out assault one complaint is the piece that the wheels are attached to  its a single piece with smaller than the standard pin connection so you cant change the width of the cart for your mocs using the wheels i dont know if a piece with such a connection only on one side exists though 	positive
kimt on aug 29 2008 0655 am said best impulse set so far agreed i love this little sets i cant wait for it to hit shops here the rodent problem is funny but i lov always getting more animals so that is a plus the cart is a nicely formidable machine that i will keep together so i can maximise their fire power the troll figure is one of my favourite ever too i love that torso and helmet and i want that sword in grey i only have it in bronze thanks for the review batbrick away	positive
thanks for the interview i nearly forgot this set is out yet maybe ill grab one off my local store tomorrow	neutral

nikola bathory on aug 28 2008 1147 pm said wait a second a troll isnt that an orc i thought that this is a troll those are giant trolls the regular sized green guys such as is included with this set are trolls yes they look like orcs but lego calls them trolls	neutral

brick built robot surely we€™re getting near classic space now theme space mission mars set name minirobot set number 5616 number of pieces 24 figures1 released 2008 list price £250 gbp 350 usd 299 euro 5616 peeroncom 5616 bricklink catalog 5616 shop at home let look at the box first space man approaching the robot from behind i€™m not sure you can still buy the base easily anymore the contents of the box the contents of the box it€™s rather white fairly standard mission mars spaceman he€™s got printing front and back but sadly no air tank how does he breath as has been pointed out he does have a printed tank but id rather a physical one note the megaphone is in flashlight mode not weapon mode that€™s important the robot itself feels a bit clumsy the metal detector is never going to touch the ground and it feel a bit wide i don€™t like the look of him something in the eyes the reason why so we can have a box to put crystals in both together and ready to explore new worlds etc sadly the robot was homicidal remember in space no one can hear you scream it€™s not a bad impulse set and if it marks the return of brick built robots to space then it€™s a good thing i just feel the robot could have been better built the rating system figures 610 not to bad but nothing wonderful parts 610 lots of white and not much orange but where€™s the air tank fun fun fun 610 probably the best impulse set as a stand alon toy lots to do with a robot and his human boss design 510 the robot feels clumsily put together i think it needs work price 810 can€™t fault the impulse price grand total 3150 not well designed but does have more play value than other impulse sets conclusion i was surprised that mission mars got impulse sets as it didn€™t seem to sell as well as other lines last year however i think this is a fairly good set it has more playability than other sets and does come with a metal detector been a while since i€™ve seen one though i could be wrong sadly the robot isn€™t as good as it could be edited by sinner 01 september 2008  0130 am	positive
cardinal brick on aug 28 2008 0636 pm said fairly standard mission mars spaceman he’s got printing front and back but sadly no air tank how does he breath parts 610 lots of white and not much orange but where’s the air tank as you said he has printing on the back if you look closley you wil lsee a tank printed on his back with oxygen written on it stauder	neutral

nice review and quite funny now ill never turn my back on a robot again poor set i find this set bad even for an impulse the robot is poorly designed and without any use the space minifig is ok id rather get another impulse set than this except the other life on mars mars mission impulse sets	negative
kimt on aug 28 2008 0952 pm said id rather get another impulse set than this except the other life on mars mars mission impulse sets actually i kinda like the crystal hawk impulse the default model isnt that great but you get a few nice wing plates to work with after rearranging it looks pretty good i guess this one though is good for some nice parts tho its pretty limited in what you can rebuild it into and it seems less value because the astronaut has no vehicle best impulse set has to be the troll warrior feels very complete and space orcs are always nice to have	positive

another great review erdbeeries i have to give it a i have thought about this set long and hard and your review might just force me to pick it up the vehicles look nice and the nazis are great figs bravo	positive
this set is nice it looks like a dhl van	positive
good review thanks for the mail van while it certainly adds interaction and fun to a lego town it alone lacks details and playability and thus not a good set especailly taking its price into consideration its value is pretty much just like if not less than some impulse sets in my opinion	negative
legoman132 on aug 29 2008 0635 am said this set is nice it looks like a dhl van makes you wonder if there was some kind of promo or hookup in the pipeline that never happened i have this set and i really like it it works well with either the new city sets or with my older 1980s1990s sets i actually like the use of the old style car base and mourned the day that these became exitinct the first time round c1990 thanks for the review cheers rog	positive
nice review i like this little set some how it reminds me now of postman pat in dutch pieter post an english childrens tv series about a postman in a little village somewhere in yorkshire aah sweet memories i would rather have seen a postoffice released with some women minifigs instead of the green post bigplane but maybe in a couple of years	positive
rriggs on aug 31 2008 0255 am said i actually like the use of the old style car base and mourned the day that these became exitinct the first time round c1990 i dont hate the piece but i did object to the way this set fills in the middle recessed area with a 2 x 2 plate that is nearly impossible to get out again without doing some damage to it whats more if you fill in the recessed area youve eliminated the only rationale for using the car base in the first place	negative
welcome to another sunny day in lego city the sun is shining the birds are singing minifigs are drowning wait what the coast guard rushes to the scene and deploys the coast guard 4wd  jet scooter to save the poor minifig from drowning lets take a look at the coast guards buggy 7737 coast guard 4wd  jet scooter set info set name 7737 coast guard 4wd  jet scooter theme citycoast guard released 2008 price 999 usd995 eur799 gbp pieces 130 minifigs 1 price per piece about 8 cents now the review the box here is the front it shows a nice image of the buggy on the beach with the ocean in the background the back the back shows some of the features in the set such as the extra equipment manual the picture on the manual is the same as on the box as usual the parts the set has great colors i love how the orange blue and white look together the part selection is quite good but unfortunately uses the large car base coast guard minifig this is a great fig the torso print is very nice and matches the buggys colors well new tire mold here are the new tires they look very good inmanual shot color separation is not a problem here and since it is a small set the piece call out is not a necessity extra parts it is always nice to get extra cheese slopes the finished set the design of the trailer and jetski is great the jetski is very smooth looking and the color scheme is fantastic the sticker on the roof is nice but its actually too big for the piece the corners of the sticker flap where the piece curves jetski closeup here you can see how it attaches to the trailer i didnt add the sticker that goes on the front which is a little sign that says bb03 or something attaching the trailer this is where the trailer connects to the main car it attaches simply with a ball joint car front view the license plate is a nice sticker and the top lights look nice say cheese driver the back the back is very similar to the front it has the same sticker the equipment rack a very welcome addition to the set it adds quite a bit of playability the orange fins are great all decked out he looks pretty spiffy in his diving suit doesnt he brickshelf folder the ratings price 1010 you cant get much more in here for 10 parts 910 nice selection and great colors the big car base is a bit annoying design 910 the jetski is a prime example of something with a small amount of pieces that still looks amazing playability 910 you can drive the car go diving and jetski across the bay minifig 710 the one it comes with is great but it could have come with one more perhaps a citizen of some sort build 810 simple but looks great overall 4250 lego sh brickset peeron bricklink even in the face of danger this member of the coast guard always has a smile on his face summary simply put for 10 you have to buy this set it is one of the better sets in this price range you can buy and one of the best small city sets the colors are great the design is great and the fig is great i dont normally think small sets are worth heavy praise but this one definitely deserves it thanks and happy building	positive
what an outstanding review of a great set i esp like your intro i have this set but have not opened it yet it looks like a fun little beach set the new coast guard theme is very nice edit this set could almost pass for classic town except for the use of orange and the lack of opening doors on the car 5 stars	positive
great job i will want to get this set soon its a lovely set with some coast guard saving on the jet ski what i dont like about this set is the lack of doors everything about this is nice but i still have to give it a 4 as for the entire flow of review i agreed with brickster that your introduction is very good with the little amends i had added earlier it turns out to be very good keep it up	positive
i am not a fan of citytowntrainstuff but this is a very good review that almost makes me wish i had the time read money to purchase some of the coastguard sets	positive
a very good review of an especially charming and lovely set thanks the whole cg theme looks very nice to me with a good and detailed set design and this one´s no exception although it would be nice to see more car doors and some new mf faces though	positive
thanks for this review i was thinking of getting this set and having read your review went out today and got it what a great little set what i particularly like very sturdy build feels very solid as you build the pickup compared to the fire pickup  trailer i also have the orange pieces my first pieces in this colour the tyres which give the smoothest ride of any lego towncity vehicle ive ever built the raised suspension and side runners the coast guard dude again a first for me and his megacool flippers and aqualung the jetski controls  the handlebars actually move left to right which is a great detail little details that lego didnt have to do the grey handle by the ball joint moving handlebars the new tyres as you can probably guess i have voted outstanding for this set erdbeereis1 on aug 29 2008 0602 am said color separation is not a problem here and since it is a small set the piece call out is not a necessity you do get a piece call out with this set i did anyway its on the back of the small poster that is included in the set thanks again cheers rog edited by rriggs 02 september 2008  0253 pm	positive
thanls for the review i was looking at this set last time i went to the lego store but in the end decided not to get it now you’ve made me really doubt my decision one question though do you think the jet ski is as good as previous ones	positive
erdbeereis1 on sep 2 2008 0915 pm said i meant the piece call outs during the build that show which pieces you need for that step oh cardinal brick on sep 2 2008 0905 pm said one question though do you think the jet ski is as good as previous ones i have to agree that the jetski is an awesome little piece of design apart from the handle bars it has a really cool orange piece on the front a piece ive never seen before  the 4x3 wheelarch sort of thing cheers rog	positive
nice set nice review i already have one coastguard set that truck but i like the idea very much however the rigid inflatables could be much improved see the real ones at wwwrnlicouk or wwwknrmnl	positive

i had to vote outstanding on this set because it simply is great minifigs a cool head sculpture and a nice little boat means unlimited playability great review though man	positive
what a great review of an excellent set i love the islanders and that drum outstanding i think these islander sets never got the credit they dserved i really like this set and its a great addition to the pirate collection	positive
i feel the same way about the islanders sets brickster they are a nice change from the regular pirate versus soldiers that is the norm i think it would be interesting to see some new islanders sets released in the new pirate line to see how tlc would make them	neutral
what a wonderful review with smart showing the right parts and clear pictures fantastic job erdbeereis1 this set is interesting for several reasons first of all it contains a large amount of very useful minifigs not many sets of this size contain so much figs secondly the throne itself can be easily combined with the other islander sets or even with other pirate and nonpirate sets im going to see if i can get this one for a reasonable price on ebay	positive
great review well done for sure i love these reviews of old set and this one is especially unique i must agree with you the color scheme is magnificent makes me want to go to ebay and buy it now to bad for spongebob though he got in with a real bad crowd	positive
thanks for the great review this set is pretty standard as islanders go but it is such a cool subtheme that i dont care a bit i totally agree with your comment about old and new sets i dont think i would enjoy lego as much if i didnt have a decent amount of kits from pre 1999	negative
another very nice review and im glad to see it has some nice pieces as well as characters too looks to me that no one on bl has it in australia for sale so i may pass on this beauty though i did pick up king kahuka recently he makes an appearance in my medium entry	neutral
17 for an old set is good i may hunt for it on ebay 	neutral
very solid set 5 minifigs and plenty of weapons to go around adding up to great playability what more could you want aspecially from a set this size only i would have liked another cutlass a musket instead of 1 of the pistols and for 1 of the pirates to have another head but those things are no big deal it is still a lot better than sets nowadays edited by fluyt 23 december 2008  0950 pm	positive

i do not like the fact that the clones have pure white legs it looks weird to me it was also weird that they included shock troopers but it was probably a way to get people to buy it this set also seems like one of those that was kind of thrown in with a mix of other sets like the tie crawler i never picked it up and with the new clone wars sets out i wont	negative

valentin nice review i was thinking of doing this review and realised there were 3 reviews being done for this lovely set i must admit this is an amazing set after buying it in tru for sgd4990 15 discount i like the comparison of both spider droid even though one is not lego thanks for doing this lovely review its enjoyable to read	positive

alakazam the good wizard is the wisest minifig in all of legoland he is a master of the wand and can see the future with these abilities he helps the knights predict where the trolls will strike next because this set is not in stores in the us i was luckily able to buy this set on my vacation to germany it is interesting that it is a euro exclusive 5614 the good wizard set info set name 5614 the good wizard theme castle released 2008 price eur 295gbp 199 pieces 16 minifigs 1 the review unfortunately i dont have the box because in got smushed in my suitcase on the plane so needless to say it was not in top condition the manual the manual is an extremely small foldout but the image on the front is nice on the back of the manual there is a picture of some of the 2008 impulse sets this is a nice feature the parts for an impulse set this has a pretty good selection a very nice owl and an interesting clear ball piece all built this set took me forever to build i had to take numerous breaks as it was the toughest longest build i have ever faced for an impulse set this actually looks pretty good the owl perch is nice also the crystal ball table the wizard is a very nice fig with great printing on the legs and hat and i love his beard brickshelf gallery the ratings price 810 not bad but i feel that impulse sets are slightly overpriced parts 710 impulse sets are focused around the minifig but the parts in this set are pretty good design 710 the crystal ball is a good idea and the owl perch is simple but nice playability 610 there is not much to play with here build 810 as i said before it took forever really it took all of 1 minute minifig 1010 the wizard is fantastic overall 4660 bricklink lego sh brickset abracadabra blades of four you are now a dinosaur summary for an impulse set this is very nice the wizard is an excellent fig and getting an animal in a cheap set is always great i would definitely recommend this set thanks and happy building	neutral
good review for a simple set while it does come with the basics for an impulse set i just feel that it lacks something though i am not sure what perhaps a printed magic scroll i am still not a fan of the printed cap especially the stars but i do like the printed pants displaying his various goodies hanging from his belt the plain torso is to be expected from a wizard minifig i suppose overall its not a bad set but it certainly feels to be lacking something imo	neutral
thanks for the review i love this impulse set i bought two of them so i could make a wizard and his apprentice i didnt have an owl either so an extra is pretty cool and i like the trans globe piece batbrick away	positive

i scream clone on aug 31 2008 0227 am said kudos on a well presented and written review i think the reason this set didnt release in us was because it didnt have any warnings about choking anywhere on the box therefore no lawsuits in us for lego cheers isc no thats not the reason im sure youll get this set eventually as for the box well theres always been 2 boxdesigns  one for the us and one for eu actually theres an asian one as well the eu doesnt have the box count or the dont swallow we know that the us version has the brick count and dont swallow warning typical us thanks for a super review strawberryiceman i like the wizard im only sorry they put him in an impulse set whod want an army of medium blue wizards so its the worst army builder but a cool wizard does that make sense	neutral
worst set of the year worst set of all time the pictures say it all no ratings necessary a waste of paper for box and instructions and waste of plastic for bag and jelly alien the little alien ship that comes with the switch fighter beats this one hands down as well as any other lego spaceship i have ever seen and i have seen many thankfully this set isnt available in my country which is something i never thought i would say anyway i hope tlg makes these awful jelly aliens disappear forever after this year	negative
thanks for the review considering the price i give it below average i didnt buy any of the space impulse sets as i dont think they are good value	negative
to be honest i am going to give this set a 1 that is my lowest rating i will ever give to a set in eurobricks in fact this is the only impulse set which i do not have it at all after looking at your wonderful review i am going to give it a 2 and actually consider it to buy at least one to complete the entire impulse set series i dont really like the design and the alien at all in fact i prefer the mars mission astronaunt more than the aliens i dont really like the set but i like your review	negative
i rated this poor due to the fact the set is unimaginative looks like a bunch of plates where thrown together and it just isnt worth the money lego is asking for it imo ive never been a fan of the nonarticulated jellies so ill leave my disgust for them out of this post however unlike the set the review is a fine work of art that clearly depicts the goods and provides valuable insightopinions about the sets playability usefulness and overall value	positive
sets we miss include minfig sets like this one€ theme space set name space minifigs set number 6703 number of pieces 30 figures 6 released 1988 list price  unknown 6703 peeroncom 6703 bricklink catalog lets begin by admiring the outside of the box wow 6 figs and all equipped i was four more of these we don€™t get instructions so the back show how to put the figs together now for the men themselves the complete line up of all six figs it seems strange half are in black a closer look at our four futrons a look at the blacktrons looking like nice guys with their visors raised time for a closer look at the range of tool these good men received from the lego company yep one accessory per person the question is what could you do with this set i mean it€™s just spacemen in a line do you see the man who mugged you ma€™am a good set from an age when we could look forward to every few years a new set of minfigs and just a box of them the rating system figures 1010 an excellent selection for the time parts 410 good accessories but nothing else fun fun fun 710 i can see lots of opportunity for fun with this set design 810 well it€™s not really designed much but it€™s a great idea price 10 unknown at this time though mine was from woolworths grand total 2940 a good mark for a great set conclusion until the castle battle packs came out this year we€™ve been suffering from a lack of minfig based sets and from this review i think you can see why for many of us and i include myself here lego minifig are one of the best parts of the hobby and sets like these allowed you to build up a much larger number of figs lego did well with this set a nice range of figure and also a good selection of accessor	positive
you you got it mint in sealed box it indeed is a nice set i am not into space but nevertheless this set is a good addition if you need to get your space environment a little bit more crowded lego however is planning to release a minifig set again next year city and of course the advent calendars are also quite nice to get some figs with accessories	positive
fantastic review this is one of the classic minifigs pack which is so great for gathering massive number of minifigs i miss those days where they sell 5 minifigs together in a set thanks for this lovely review	positive
nice set lucky you the only reason i buy the mm impulse sets is lack of good space minifig packs like this nowadays 	positive

thanks for the review jimbutcher i really like that set it combines interesting and good design with some awesome cool parts and a neat amount of charm	positive
thanks for the cool review jimbutcher  actually i really like this set it is small but very clever and even if the hailfire droid is undersized what in the whole line is not under or oversized  the new spider droid is the best small build i have ever done in a set and the droid commander is pretty cool  i am happy with the set and i will get another with my comiccon exclusive 	positive

7681 homing spider droid limited edition number of pieces 206 number of minifigs 5 price 3499 usd 2999 eur 1999 gbp theme star wars episode ii year released 2008 brickset folder bricklink catalog welcome to my sixth review on these boards of the mighty homing spider droid at first glance this ball on legs may not seem like much but hopefully this review will change your mind the box this box is the standard for all of the new clone wars sets sleek shiny and a rightoutofthefactory look the blueandwhite color scheme is fantastic and portrays that the sets are based off of a cartoon well this box has a limited edition in spanish too  seal slapped on the front although you wont have trouble finding this in your local toys r us because of the big clone wars display in the front of the store that you cant miss overview in this picture you can see the contents of the whole set minus the instruction booklet built you can spot five minifigures which ill get to later and a very tall cis weapon known as the homing spider droid this weapon of destruction is a musthave for your cis army although the color scheme mostly dark bley and light bley is a change up from the regular colors brown or blue of the cis this may have something to do with the blended armies of the trade federation and corporate alliance but i dont know for sure the instruction manual is very thin only about twenty pages homing spider droid this is the main part of the set four huge legs two mounted guns and a red sensor eye are the highlights of this artillery unit theres not many playability factors to this one but sometimes its just fun to squash the little clones a changeup of the contrary it also looks good next to all of the other cis sets but you might want to clear some room in your display area the legs take up a lot of room this thing is also massively tall about the same height as the republic cruiser main body this is the main body of the spider which has no cockpit and is remote controlled this spherical body not in that sort of way is a very quick build and features a big red eye connected by a red stud and hinge top gun here is the top gun not with tom cruise which is connected to the body using a clever technic system pun not intended as you can see from this picture you can see that it can rotate a full 360 degrees but only if you remove the eye also the gun can be pulled back and if you let go it will snap back like the a gun does when fired due to the force of the shot im not sure this was intended by tlg because it wasnt showed anywhere on the box or in the manual lower gun here is the gun attached to the under body of the main part it is attached using a hinge which allows it to move up and down i also like the cord that presumably transfers power included on both guns hips here is one of the hips attaching the legs to the body there is one on each side with two legs each the are attached to the body and legs with technic pieces legs you can see the tall legs in this pic they are basically just technic poles and connectors feet this is one of the feet the essential to balancing the whole vehicle these and the legs are repetitive so i suggest doing them all at the same time to avoid flipping back in the manual and repeating the process three more times the picture speaks for itself for the design of the feet all are connected to the legs using a doubleholed technic piece one massive son of a gun this thing is so tall it frightens the skin off of even the toughest most experienced soldiers run for your lives look at how much havoc and fear it causes family photo enough of the battle scenes here is a shot of this spider with its smaller cousin the dwarf spider droid minifigs finally here are the minifigs that come with this set there are five in all which include battle droid nothing special but still an addition to your army commander battle droid i love that yellow torso super battle droid again nothing special clone trooper im glad they gave us one in this set i can add it to to my other phase 1 clones commander fox i love it everything from the dark red markings to the accessories are fantastic the head is just the regular anime style clone wars face this set comes with two flashlights two antennae one visor one pauldron and one kama closeup of fox here is a closeup of fox so you can see the detailed insignia of the republic guard that wraps it up for the review here is the final verdict build 810 very easy and straightforward a little repetitive with the legs should take the seosoned builder around 20 minutes playability 610 not many play factors but its fun to just squash puny clones with this giant arachnid swooshability na minifigs 1010 you really cant ask for more in this sort of set design 810 not very sturdy but it is altogether clever price 510 yes it is limited edition but pumping up the price fifteen dollars more than it should be is a little ridiculous overall score 8510 an excellent set for display although not very sturdy minifigs are superb but the price could be better in the end i would highly recommend this to any prequel trilogy fan looking to build up his her army well thats about it for this review please feel free to leave your opinions edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0309 am	positive
i just bought this set the other day and i must admit that it gets a below average from me the price is not corresponding with what you get which would be implied had jim added the eur or gbp price in the infohint hint  the spider droid is flimsy at best making it stand or even move without tumbling over is hard also why the brown cylinders on the legs keep the colourscheme clean please the figs are fine except that i dislike the clone headgear and the fact that the helmets now have holes in the sides allowing the flesh head to show within  goofy looking i am soo replacing the clone heads with black ones great review of an acceptable set	negative
thank you for that good review jimbutcher i think that this is really a pretty interesting and original looking set maybe it´s not very stable but it owns some special war of the worlds charm for sure	positive

massmanufactured and designed to withstand extreme amounts of punishment its an iron drone and its marching on its sentry set data 7711 sentry year 2006 theme exoforce subtheme robots pieces 74 4 extra  both counting hinge control stick and its base as two separate pieces price euro 7 circa misb including sh on ebay rrp was euro 5 circa  5 usd probably 5 ukp building time 2025 minutes 10 minutes building the rest of the time placing stickers more info brickset  peeron being 2006 my last dark year i wasnt a big exoforce fan but they were ok i tought 2007 models were better and still think 2008 models are the best that basically means 1 its a shame that there will be no more of this line and 2 this is my first 2006 model yet i bought in in july 2008 ok lets do this one box front box was battered due to italian post theyll do their best to give lego boxes a war outlook closeup the japanese katakana read tokushu butai  special military forces box back amazing alternate model some like it more than the original design box content a small but capable sticker sheet two bags and instructions sticker sheet and theyre numbered random instructions page connecting legs to the body instructions page  sticker detail thats why theyre numbered instructions page  parts inventory does anybody check if theyre all there before building surely not me loose pieces nothing rare i think small techinc parts come in different colours as usual you often dont see them when the model is complete but sometimes you do the iron drone strong and durable and much better looking than those crappy mm jelly aliens building starts the open cockpit  front and rear view left leg  front and rear view right leg is built of the same pieces left arm  with laser cannon the cannon  great use of the hollow studs with the plant tree palm top right arm  with twin missiles complete model  front view complete model  side view and rear view rating and review parts and building nothing new but both models are ok instead of waiting the last page of the manual youd better put the stickers in place while building looking at the box youd tell stickers background is trans purple it actually is trans clear excpet for the yellow and black stripes  warning hazard try not to put your fingerprints on the sticky side consider using tweezers posability both legs and both arms feature three joints and thats good so that the weight doesnt have the sentry falling down final model smaller compared to 2007 claw crusher and 2008 batlle arachnoid but cheaper and surely worth the money the minifig is just another iron drone not much to say final rating 355 edited by sinner 01 september 2008  0222 am	neutral
thanks for the review i really do like the first year of ef nowadays they mecha are perhaps more cleverly designed and use ball joints for playability but i really love the blocky bulky look of the first drones machines and somehow the older ones seem a better value of parts im more inclined to buy duplicates of them than the newer models	neutral
i like the theme very much but sadly i dont own any sets of it it brings such a great feeling its fresh and has great parts and sets and it brought the polar bear your review is very good and informative thanks i voted wrong i meant above average but i clicked below average 	positive
thank you for that fine review thebrickster i really like how this two small sets create an intense and adventurous atmosphere against the backdrop of a pretty exotic region the sets´re well designed and very nice with a fine amount of rather unique and well fitting gear the whole theme offers a lot of playability in a setup that´s a little different to tlc´s standard sceneries for sure and it always reminded me of who goes there too	positive
hi great review on one of my favourite themes i never realized how cool it was until just now when you did your review anyways i remember my one set of the arctict expedition the arctic expedition pack	positive
a nice set review as for the theme itself i though it was a very interesting theme sadly i don’t think lego put enough effort into it i was personally upset not to se a second year even if i didn’t buy any of the sets it reminds me of the artic theme playmobil did at one point in the distant past to be honest i think a number of good artic scenes were missed when it came out a really wanted to get a ski plane but it never came i built it myself in the end but i don’t know how lego missed that one on a slightly random note i do know that at least one lego minifig did make it all the way to the real artic with a research team sadly i don’t have any pictures to offer you	negative
a very nice review i really miss the arctic theme i didnt own any of the sets but after looking at the pictures in this review and reading the instructions on brickleys words and brickfactory i want them	positive
i find it amusing that the numbers on the decal for the flag were chosen so that it wouldnt look stupid if you put it on upsidedown by accident	neutral

thank you very much for this review thebrickster i voted both times for outstanding because i really the arctic theme i only bought the ice sailor but otherwise no sets because of money and place reasons and because i already collect four themes city older castle western and star wars old triology but a comeback of the arctic theme  perhaps as addition to a winter sports and winter rescue theme would be very welcome i really all sets  the little and the big ones in my opinion they all were very well designed not too big vehicles not too little and not minimalitic great minifigs and very nice and lovely details and accessory klausdieter	positive
great review i hope tlc does another i rember reading a book once based on the theme which stated the scorpions and thespiders and such were aliens 	positive
wasnt there some years back a film based on aliens in the arctic cant remember the name and i think it was really old but there certainly was going on something with strange creatures and a polar base	neutral
its amazing its stupendous its almost like whitefang is a reviewer with previous experience its almost like i wrote all of shadows lines its almost like staudie is being as annoying as ever oh wait thats all true great review of a neat little set i used mine as the air conditioning unit on the roof of my chinese restaurant then some dork told me it didnt look believable or something i liked it um so great review thanks for presenting it i give you a and lets just take a moment to get sentimental a year ago today staudie had a lame idea interview the members of eb he flailed around with it for a few interviews including the infamous one where hinck attention whored sinner into a corner and sinner were featured reprising their roles from the whacker and the walrus it was quite memorable but then a short time later someone new joined the team bringing it to a new level of polish and bad jokes still this tribute isnt dedicated to that genius of the written word nay its dedicated to the whole staff including the new guy who is still a secret so dont bother asking im not telling ha i salute you eb news its been a damn fine year i hope i can survive another	positive

2872 witch and fireplace review theme fright knights parts 18 figs 1 price unknown bricklink 500 year 1997 brickset peeron brickshelf bricklink ever wanted to turn into a animal wanted to curse your enemy or just wanted to be rich beyond your wildest dreams you should go visit the witch and her fireplace she can brew you up a potion for any occasion or purpose so head down to see the witch right now although this set is from the fright knights theme it can easily fit in with any other castle theme due to the lack of specialised fright knight parts and printings the set comes with no astounding parts but looks like the source for our good magician impulse set from the current castle theme i think i got this as a promo set official pic the box art for the set has the standard fright knight background and lego system logo followed by the set number down the left hand side of the box a cat is attempting a head stand also i think this box display the contents of the set in an attractive set up as usual 1 the whole set minifigs and all here is the witch on the torso there is a spider amulet which is a little hard to make out due to the low res of the image the witches wand is the same as the bellville fairy wands except in trans red like a lightsaber blade although it is completely useful as a lightsaber as you have probably noticed the witch has no legs instead she has a slope brick with the dress pattern printed on witch get it witchwhich looks better than asajj ventress from the new clone wars sets in my opinon for this anyway the fairysaber new word duel this is the old run down fireplace of the witch at the base there are two smouldering coals instead of fire witch its not funny any more is it doesnt make that much sense seeming as it is a fireplace the little triangular brick on top doesnt really do anything i also accidentally put the wrong one on while building it should be a sloping brick here are the coals the old trans orange studs are less translucent than the new ones i like how they have places them above the main baseplate on a 1x2 plate so they are in line with the rest of the fire place other wise it would look wrong here is everything else i havent covered yet the crystal ball the pets and the magical potion vial the crystal ball is identical to the one included with the good wizard impulse form the current castle theme i like the molds for the cat and the bat although if the cat had some yellow printing for the eyes like the white cat had black for the eyes it would be much better i think the trans green tube things are a little uncommon but im not worried about that 2 overall build 610 extremely puzzling and difficult do not attempt alone  its pretty simple but seeming as it has a load of stuff you can move around it is good minifigs 910 i really like the witch and it couldnt have really come with anyone else also it came with the wand which is really good too design 810 it should have come with some fire and maybe some more orange bricks to put at the base parts 810 the minifigure isnt bad nor are the animals or the trans green part price 1010 i am guessing this was pretty good seeming as i think i got this as a promo i gave it 10 because it was free playability 710 as wth all impulse sets there isnt much here but at least it comes with some animals to have a fight with or give the witch rabies overall 810 if it came with some more stuff for the fire place and the cat was more detailed it would have scored higher but because this set can easily be intergrated with other castle sets it got a mighty 8 3 mini comic  hocus pocus magic shocus turn my pets into dinosaurs not to catchy is it poof oh know i think i might drink my magical potion glug glug glug oh my	positive
thank you very much for this review skipper 24 i voted for outstanding since this set is a little but very lovely set i really it although i dont own it yet  since its very similar to todays impulse sets a minifig and some nice additional stuff and i like the black cat which gives the set a more gloomy atmosphere hopefully tlg will include a black cat and a chimney like in this set in the new advent calendar too klausdieter	positive
i chose above average it has a great minifigure i wish i had itsomeday i will	positive
you already know how i feel about the review as for the set im not entirely sure its a fine witch but youve already gotten her in the witchs windship and a few other sets i vote average on this a good minifig though one does not have the need for more than one witch and some fine additional parts	neutral
this is a very good review no doubt about it about this set this is a cheap way to buy this set with a witch and some nifty accessories such as the black cat in fact i think this is the first time i had ever seen a black cat its simple but not very useful in my collection because other fright knight sets also offer the witches too i dont need many witches overall i feel that this is an average set	neutral
yay another fright knights review odd comic at the end skipper 24 on sep 1 2008 0705 pm said ever wanted to turn into a animal wanted to curse your enemy or just wanted to be rich beyond your wildest dreams you should go visit the witch and her fireplace she can brew you up a potion for any occasion or purpose so head down to see the witch right now sounds like a song or nursery rhyme somehow anyway to the review it is a great review such a small set but youve summed it up well this is one of the few unpromo fright knight sets i didnt get sadly not sadly because of willa the witch i have about four of her but the special cat and the other bits one can never have too many lego bats i voted the set outstanding i think it is for its size kimt on sep 1 2008 0816 pm said you already know how i feel about the review good or bad feelings edited by shoc 02 september 2008  1145 am	positive

review of 7670 hailfire droid and spider droid updated theme sw episode ii  clone wars parts 249  figs figs 4 price £2000 2000 ‚2599 year 2008 i think many people were deterred from this set because of the low piece count and a high price for it although it does come with 4 minfigures 1 overall set and figs official box pic this indicates it is a geonosis set from the background but it is no different from any other set same old brown separatist ships the whole set some red tan droids would have been nice like in the geonosian fighter set all the minifigs the super battle droid body is slightly different to the one in the bp it looks more grainy and silver i doubt this has any relevance for it being a geonosis set but i like them better how they were in the bps the super battle droid body dwarfing the commander droids body i think that the new commander droids body is better than the old one with just the yellow strip even though it is less accurate new twisted battle droid arm each droid has one of these i dont really like having droids with these new guns i think the older guns suited them much better 2 hailfire droid hailfire droid by itself it is certainly smaller than the original seeming as this is the main part of the set i was hoping it would be bigger but i dont mind it being this small too much wheels and rockets can fold outwards and inwards the wheels which spin round two large clear discs and made from loads of these tiny links this is probably the best way to make the wheels on this small scale the only other alternatives i can think of are using the tracks from the wookiee attack set or catterpilla tracks both of which wouldnt look right one of the missile pods these use the new flickfire missiles which dont fall out are an excellent idea they should have come with the purple cones like on the magna guards staffs instead of red though because in the film the missiles are purple one of the new flickfire missiles that dont drop out when the model is tilted forward i dont know what the holes in them are for though the 3 eyes are made up of 2 trans red cheese bricks for the sides and 1 trans red stud for the centeryou can also see how the missile pods are attached to the side of the body this is the back of the hailfire droid there is a plate with a hole in i have found only one purpose for this the hailfire droid is the commander droids war chariot what do you use the plate for 3 spider droid the spider droid the design has been greatly improved from the wookiee attack set not only is it more accurate but also more poseable which is useful when setting up battle scenes the ball joint provides the place to put the antenna which isnt long enough but the dome form the old set looks more like the droid form star wars episode ii the eyes are made of a telephone piece with 2 trans red studs on in the original it had orange studs the eyes can be seen in action 2 pics down i told you it was a telephone 1 of 4 identical legs these are very easy to adjust into what ever position you want and are much better than the originals but a word of warning never pull them apart as i did they become very loose when put back together so i put some blue tack in the holes 4overall build 710 a little to repetitive for my liking minifigs 810 4 figs for £20 isnt too bad plus they come with new guns design 910 both vehicles are very well designed but the hailfires small size let the set down parts 810 comes with lots of useful maybe not  brown track links price710 not too bad with 4 figs and loads of little brown links playability 610 not to much on its own overall 710 if it came with some clones and tan red droids it would be better afetr jar jar wiped out a small droid patrold he realized he was being watched mesa in big dodo this time	neutral
skipper 24 on sep 1 2008 1221 pm said this is the back of the hailfire droid there is a plate with a hole in i have found only one purpose for this the hailfire droid is the commander droids war chariot what do you use the plate for the plate with the hole in it is for an easy grip when you push it around i think nice review by the way i think the telephone piece is great if a little bit oversized	neutral
jimbutcher on sep 1 2008 0753 pm said the plate with the hole in it is for an easy grip when you push it around i think nice review by the way i think the telephone piece is great if a little bit oversized i never thought f that but i guess thats what it is for unless it is for a trailer	neutral

6205 vwing fighter number of pieces 118 number of minifigs 1 price 999 usd 1399 eur 899 gbp theme star wars episode iii year released 2006 brickset folder bricklink catalog welcome to this review of the vwing fighter this will be my eighth review on the boards strangely enough there was another set called the vwing fighter that came out in 1997 for the space theme note that i am missing several small pieces to this set but they are mostly insignificant to the overall look the box this is the standard box type for all 20052006 star wars sets i cant say that i like it as much as the 2007 or 2008 box types but itll do it features a profile view of darth vader and silver text overview this is the whole set this ship is meant to protect the chancellor at all costs they are usually found in groups of three or four front this ship is very sleek and youll notice that its colors are dark red light bley and dark bley with a touch of black it starts at the nose very narrow but as the body progresses to the back it gets wider like a v hence the name back here is a view of the rear note the transneon green discs used to represent the boosters also notice the dark red r4 astro droid and the hinges used as aromor flight all four wings two on each side can open up for flight attack mode they can open even farther then the pic shows but its not an intended function the wings a great but its a real pain to position them correctly and the bottom wings close when you set the ship down tail fins this is what the tail fins look like on each side with two flaps attached to the top and bottom if you look closely the tail fins and wings look a little bit like a mini ship themselves maybe controlled by remote no this is not an intended function either guns side the guns are very simple but very clever using a double technic hole piece two black bars and two technic pins also note the landing gear minifig finally here is the minifig a clone pilot it has light blue arms and legs white hands a helmet with black markings and republic insignia on it and a doublesided torso the front of the torso is great featuring shoulder straps armor plating and a life support system while this minifig is not altogether accurate to the movie it has still been one of my favorite star wars figs back the back of the fig that can double as the front of clone marines this side features shoulder straps and armor plating cockpit lastly here is the pilot seated in the cockpit he fits perfectly although it is not airtight we wouldnt want the poor guy to suffocate now would we that wraps up the review here is the final verdict build 810 a nice easy build and the last of the small sw ships 10 or less playability 610 pretty fun to swoosh around but thats about it could use a vulture droid but that would take away the small factor swooshability 1010 very fun and easy to swoosh around endlessly without fear of it breaking minifigs 910 there really is no need to have more although a palpy fig would be outstanding the pilot is a great figure though design 910 extremely accurate to the movie but the cockpit is not airtight price 1010 you couldnt ask for a better deal overall score 86 an excellent set unfortunately this is the last of the small sw ships currently the fig is great and the sleek design is accurate that just about sums it all up feel free to leave your comments edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0311 am	positive
swman on sep 1 2008 0508 pm said this was a great set for the price ten dollars for a cool minifigure and a decent sized ship is great indeed it is kimt on sep 3 2008 0111 pm said yeah this was an ok set i remember getting a few of these at tru the boxes were smashed up and i got some 30 percent off still not as cheap as regular us price  some ok bricks and a great minifig thanks for sharing your thoughts and opinions on this set ill rate this set as average oh yeah ive added the review to the index thanks for the index kimt by the way a certain someone recommended that i should change the fig pics so i did that edited by jimbutcher 05 september 2008  0135 am	neutral

very good review i enjoyed reading this i want to buy these battlepacks until now my country has not restocked these battlepacks i wonder will they ever arrived again i want to build massive armies with this outstanding battlepack set hope it will arrived soon	positive
i love this battlepack i bought two last time i went to legoland california and it certainly gave the knights a good variety of new troops however i have one complaint and that is the guy with the lance i am wondering why he has a lance while fighting on foot if tlg really wanted to give him a lance they should have given him a horse	positive
great review of a neat way to bulk up your castle guards and their associated weapons and shields i hope we continue to see sets like this in the future they have to be a good money maker for tlg and they always please the fans francis marion on sep 2 2008 1039 am said they should have given him a horse  with that lovely new barding nobody would complain about the price then even if it was 15	positive

the cobra on sep 2 2008 1133 am said  why are the figures already built are todays kids so dumb lets go back to those old minifig packs probably to reduce the sizecomplexity of the package thus saving tlc money i dont see it being a big deal as customization is always an option concerning the set not much to say other than it does what its suppose to do build up ones army of knights the variance of faces and accessories are great i especially love the chrome sword the price isnt bad either since the package comes with five nice figs and some great equipment edited by dj2005 03 september 2008  0646 am	neutral
i was going to get this but when i rang up sh apparently theyd sold out already price is a little on the steep side as well and i can only see it going up on sites such as amazon as the number of people wanting them goes up which it will it its anything based on the star wars battle packs	neutral
after reading your review i might buy me one of these at first i thought it was quite useless but i must admit that your review kinda changes my mind on this bp ive added it to the index	neutral
swman on oct 6 2008 0727 am said how were you able to get three small shields i only got two in mine i am going to check the trash just in case i think it only comes with two the extra one probably slipped in from another set sorry for any confusion	neutral
and another great review from one of our academy teachers i always look forward reading them  i think the battlepacks for castle are a great initiative from tlc i like this one but also the one with the skellies you get some different looking soldiers and a few weapons and shields so thats cool the low prices make it so that most people could build a large armybattle if they want to a big for your review and another for tlc for making these edited by zorro3999 06 october 2008  0540 pm	positive

i like your review on this battle pack but i think that this battle pack was over priced 12 for this i am not paying that much for 5 knights	negative
dear all i found this to be a very usefull army building set at 2 euro per minifig it is relatively cheap in my book so i bought 4 battle packs recently although it could be difficult to integrate all of them in your army personally i reshuffled some of the weapons as to integrate them better but that is a personal preference ofcourse kind regards teddy	neutral
yeah i have to admit you expect it to be wayyy cheaper since a no packaging to pay forbaggies and such b no liscensing feeslike sw so why isnt this set a better deal than sw battlepack dont look at me look at tlche he it rhymed	negative

i really love these impulse sets at a low price point for lots of minifigs this police one doesnt appeal too much to me at the moment but who knows with your reference i may need it with a future project hmm its actually a good way of getting those dogs cheaply	positive
i also love the impulse sets but we have already too many policemen although i actually bought this one our bobby isnt looking very nice is he we normally but policemen in a pool or sea with sharks at events like legoworld so maybe thats because of me edited by jopiek 02 september 2008  1100 pm	neutral
good set but i would have about 4 by now if it came with handcuffs though the roadsign is good	positive
i bought this set for 214€ yesterday and i have to admit that for that price im veerryy satisfied  i bought it especially for the dog my first one and for the road sign during the construction short of the set i was wondering something does the speed limit has a signification in every country or some variant exists in my country france the speed limit in town is 50 kmh so i understand the road sign in this set but in other country and especially the country were the speed limit is not in kmh does this set had another road sign	positive

i agree that this set is worth the price considering the amount of minifigs and even a skeletal horse it also comes with a lot of blue 1x1 slopes that are always useful and quite rare to obtain another weapon for the soldier operating the catapult or a shield for the other soldier would have been great but that is pushing it the crossbow itself is quite nice and is better than what most 6 sets come with imo overall a good set indeed thank you for the review and the other review concerning the knight of which i hope to buy in the near future as it looks like it comes with a great deal of goodies the weapon rack is useful too	neutral
thanks for the input	positive
i like this set mostly because it has some very usable pieces but also because of the amount of minifigures in the set which is a whopping three and one large animal skeleton horse the one thing however that i dont like about it is that one of the catapult operators isnt armed in my opinion this would have been a good time for tlg to release a suitable dagger piece not the kitchen knife for its castle line great review by the way it captured the key elements of this fantastic small set	neutral
nice review to start off you got all the details someone could possibly need in my opinion at least i do enjoy this set as well and ive bought only one to keep my minifigs as unique as possible despite my personal preference i still find this a nice army builder good amount of minifigs for the price as mentioned earlier with each being different from the other though i would like the catapult manager to be armed with at least something i still feel that he can just flee if hes ever in trouble hes a good guy to use for the castle gimmics if you have it one more small comment i also love those domed helmets even if they arent actually new my favorite of them all being followed up by the racer helmet	neutral
nice review  i still thing sets like this are the reason castle has done so well it allows you to collect a large number of minfig for not very much cash which i certainly indulged in my only complaint is that you end up with the evil skeletons out numbered however heard of the good guys winning with the numbers in their favour	neutral
millacol88 on sep 6 2008 0155 am said ive experienced that problem too i find my knights outnumber my skellies about 31 a crownie dies easyer than a skeleton its so hard to perforate the lungs or pierce the heart on a skeleton with a spear or crossbow bolt isnt it a great set with a reasonable price thanks for sharing it with us added to the index	neutral

nice review it seems that you really covered all aspects of this fantastic set my favorite part about it is probably the fact that you can give almost every included minifig a mount except for one poor knight  however another part i like is that the horse includes a plain saddle which is a nice relief after the overabundance of the goldplate barding which is nice but overused in the early sets also the sw jokes are hilarious i particularly the running gag with the walker but i like this one too reason for edit i made a mistake due to a loss of internet and an accidental post edited by francis marion 03 september 2008  0332 am	positive
i really like this set and its probably my next purchase from a store if i can still find it theres alot of great pieces i especially like the spiked thingy on the front and it makes a great addition for any skeletal army above all i just love the spinechilling feeling of it if i were a minifig in a legoland id be scared out of my pantspiece if i saw a carriage like that rolling towards me in a dark night	neutral
one of the best sets from the new castle theme we havent seen a carriage in a long long time and it looks so spooky and sceary lots of minifigs new skeleton horses 3 this was the first set i got from the new castle theme outstanding	positive
that’s a nice review though i do feel the price was a little high but as you said you get so much in it last year argos in the uk reduced it to £799 which was a true bargain and sent me all over london looking for a store with more in stock again as with all the lego castle sets i think what makes it work so well is that lego are now providing a much larger number of minfigs and that’s often what makes a set	neutral
thanks for the great review i was going to buy this set this saturday and after reading this review i am twice as likely to buy it	positive
what an amazing review i actually have this set and i decided to take it apart it has a brown horse and a lot of useful pieces so taking it apart was a good idea now i have three lego horses hoorah the end of the review was the funniest lego12	positive
other than the minis accessories and animals this set is meh at best	negative
i really do love this set it has 5 figures which is unheard of for a 20 set it comes with plenty of weapons and accessories and has a great design the detail is really well done and for anyone who wants to just buy one set this set allows for hour of fun just by itself i already have one of these and hopefully will be getting a second	positive
my first fantasy era set and now i have 5 of them really good set	positive
yaaaay this set is outstanding it was first set i have bought for pieces seriously if you like skellies its mustbuy for you	positive
this set is alright but it doesnt have that pizzaz feeling you know what i mean i would prefered a knights carrage realy but the design is ok	neutral
im a little late in the coming okay a lot  but regardless id applaud you for another fantastic and insightful review erdbeereis out of all the castle sets this one remains one of my favorites i got it for christmas in 2007 before i intended to spend much money on the new castle theme that changed once i managed to get the kings castle siege for a very good price its really a wonderful set all around  the design accomplishes the spooky undead feel very well and it contains a good piece selection and a phenomenal amount of minifigs seriously this set is almost unrivaled in modern lego in the final area  im still amazed at how many minifigures tlc put in the kit i also appreciate that the carriage has a far more realistic horse arangement  after all the sillyness of the onehorse pulled siege engines in kk its good to finally see a carriage pulled by multiple horses again all in all an excellent set and well worth 20 imo	positive

7040 dwarves mine defender theme castle released 2008 price 10 usd pieces 73 3 minifigures introduction here i am with one of the newest castle sets realeased in early 2008 its a small battle wagon with blades on the front probably to demolish rocks in mines but in this case our hero dwarf has to use his machine against the evil trolls who want to destroy his happy kingdom there is only one small booklet for instructions no alternate model parts come in two bags one for small pieces and one for bigger ones apart from the lovely figures the brown parts will be quite useful for any castle builder extra parts are not even worth mentioning there are no stickers figures are detailed enough dwarf is lovely with his beard but his legs wont move because he is short figures are the main attraction for adult players we havent seen castle army builder sets for a long while and this is closest weve got in recent years the dwarf is a little taller than it should have been but its not possible to do so without creating a completely new mould for figures and that would be expensive its beard is oversized as well but that gives him a legoish look which i like a lot the trolls  thats what everybody calls them but i say they are orcs  are obviously evil but they are friendly enough not to scare our munchkins but i wish they had different torsos or at least different faces like crownies there are not enough weapons to arm everyone but the flag pole is really nice unlike the star wars army builders this set has very little weaponry only one sword and one pike creates scarcity for 3 figures  star wars sets had 4 figures for same price so i hope our middle age warriors dont come across any stormtroopers  building in progress when you pull the chain the catapult fires a round brick the set has quite good playability moving blades and firing catapult should be fun for little children i wouldnt expect more functions for such a small sized model it hardly covers my hand the blades move with the front wheel on the right there is only one little downside there is too much friction for the wheel and blades wont move synchronized you may come over this problem by adjusting the blade height and lining them with the wheels mow the little buggers you can adjust the blade height there isnt enough room for the dwarf folder when public httpwwwbrickshelrycgif338578 rating figures 810 dwarf is amazing trolls are great too but i wish they had different faces parts 710 brown slopes are new rest is ok too price 710 acceptable but we have seen sets with more figures for less design 610 it looks kind of steampunkish but could be better with a little detail building 610 not repeating itself still nothing exciting total 3450 castle fans will definetely order this one but average lego player may not be interested conclusion overall its a nice set and id recommend it if you like the castle theme youll find some good use for the figures and this is the cheapest figure set of the year  at 333 usd each it could have more armory and weaponry but otherwise its quite alright skip lunch today and order this little set links brickset reviews bricklink entry peeron inventory	positive
tacitus on sep 4 2008 0957 am said lovely review really but the sad fact is weve seen it before twice httpwwweurobrickshowtopic20293 jeez your comments are getting on my nerves more than one review per set is allowed here thanks for sharing your thoughts on this set with us a great set now has another  great review ill add it to the index as soon as the poll on how the index is to look is over phewlong sentence oh yeah and ill rate this as above average i think it needs at least one minifig more than there is	positive
a great review of a very good set i must echo kimt though i seem to be doing it an awful lot it would be improved by the addition of one more fig to the set as it’s the same price band as last years catapult	positive
ive skipped a few lunches on behalf of this set its a great army builder but so are many of the new castle sets what makes this great in my opinion is the figs  2 orcs and 1 dwarf  what else could one want thanks tlg for making this set and thank you for reviewing it for us review added to the index	positive
this set pulled me out of my dark ages thanks lego	positive
i got this set last month and i can definitely say that even if you think it is one of the best sets ever you wont fully appreciate it until you build it yourself the elevated city station is much more complex than it looks and the whole set is extremely detailed the good  as stated in the review theres a lot of track roughly twice as much as the last monorail made 6991 5 long straights too  the designers didnt need to put in the hamburger stand or the ticket readers but they did and made it even better  great figure selection airport workers as well as civilians the bad if you can call it that in such a great set  hard to incorporate into an existing town if using the default track layout the center loop would be inaccessible to vehicles and the layout is very large  the monorail needs nearly a full straight section on either side of the city station or it will impact the corner of the station and stall if a curve is too close  as far as i know the only town set with road plates that doesnt have a wheeled vehicle a car would have been nice a bus would have been incredible but these small things in no way diminish from the fact that this is one of the best sets ever edited by section8 05 september 2008  0117 pm	positive
best set ever i got my copy years ago from a guy on the old rectoyslego newsgroup anybody here still remember that newsgroup i traded him a guarded inn a black falcons fortress and a couple other small castle sets for it no regrets on that trade it is hard to incorporate a monorail into a town especially if you have a bunch of trains too i ended up making my entire monorail system elevated theres just no easy way to make a monorail  road crossing i also gave up on having it run in a loop instead it runs back and forth between two endpoints	positive
an excellent review of one of the jewels in the crown of the lego town range to answer one of your question i think the lack of people owning this set is one of the reasons that its yet to have a review personally i’ve only seen this set in the flesh once in my life when i was a child just before it was withdrawn from sale it is a lovely set well made and well produced though i think there is a flaw and that’s when the passages get of the other end of their train ride what picks them up a bus set for the airport would have been a good addition apart from that i can’t really fault it and that fact it comes with three female minifigs is just stellar as for incorporation keeping it elevated seems the most sensible suggestion i’ve always thought it i have it and wanted to integrate the set to a town to use it in the style of the dlr in london but that’s just a thought	positive
thanks for that splendid review simonwillems i clicked on outstanding of course i also like those little details especially the ticket validating machines youre very fortunate to own this wonderful set i hope you have an airport to go with it edit and bricklink is wrong giving 1991 as the release date youre right it was 1990 edited by legotrainfan 05 september 2008  0657 pm	positive

this remains the definitive city set in my eyes i never managed to get one but from the instructions it seems to be perfect in just about every way i got the two space monorails a while ago but the much higher prices on this one have kept it out my reach this set is a lot bigger than either of those though i always liked the monorail system a bit better than the trains because you could easily incorporate height into the tracks and spread them out in all three dimensions quote edit and bricklink is wrong giving 1991 as the release date youre right it was 1990 it was apparently released in 1990 in europe and 1991 in north america going by some us and german catalogs i have from that time period edited by cp5670 06 september 2008  0606 am	positive

gasp blasphemy someone voted this set below average brings out hunting rifle ahem back on topic i remember wanting this set badly for years and i still want it just no as much because its expensive and as this review proves takes up a lot of room ive already got my trains to think about and i wont be getting this set anytime soon i also have a faint memory of this set being featured in one of legos advertisements more specifically someone narrowly missing it hitches a ride races the monorail to the airport and catches the plane i am yet to find it on the net as old lego adverts are hard to come by especially the european ones now to more important matters starts hunting edited by freddie 07 september 2008  1003 pm	positive

indexed name refuse collection truck set no 6693 theme lego system  town year 1987 pieces 103 minifigs 2 price unknown special parts 4215ap08 yellow panel 1 x 4 x 3 with recycling pattern just occurs in this set 2x 4598 red bracket 2 x 3  2 x 2 occurs only in this set and only one other set this truck was introduced in the same year that lego came up with the garbage bins that of course also appear in this set have you ever wondered why most of the time the streets of lego city are so clean and neat no litter no garbage everywhere no chewinggum on the streets even with so many different inhabitants it seems to always stay that way however the older afols amongst us have experienced totally different situations rubbish everywhere smelly and dirty looking pavements minifigs that were losing their standard grin that is why lego came out with this magnificent truck back in 1987 before that people needed to put there garbage in bags or maybe barrels from that year on every miniman and miniwoman is happily using a trash bin the minifig civil servants never seem to become tired and the garbage truck comes every other day to collect the rubbish and keep the city clean the secret behind the clean lego city and the always happy standard grin of our minifolks are the antilitter warriors that use their powerful machines and handy tools to just get the job done so if you dont own a garbage truck better try to get one before your standard grins also fade and your streets become as dirty as naples where the garbage collectors recently had a strike for quite some time an overview of the set including instructions actually one is included in the set unfortunately i afraid we dont have any boxes of this set left another image of the lego items in the set it shows the truck two civil servants to perform the waste collection duties two garbage bins and a broom and shovel the two chaps that always seem to smile even when the litter that they collect really stinks the accessories that accompany the set a broom and a shovel to help cleaning up in case a dustbin tips over a very nice feature of the set is that the elevator at the back can be lifted in more or less the same way that real garbage trucks do as you can see here the dustbin is emptied through a red train window it seems to be that the hinges of my version will need some revision panels inside the back of the truck maximize waste capacity for this 4 stud wide truck it is nice that the designers added this simple red round brick on a clip presumably it should depict cylinders to let the back compartment tip for emptying or otherwise it might be gastanks again the complete set it is very complete set but some additions could make it even more playable  garbage eg a green flower bottom or some round plates 1 x 1  a place for the second worker to position himself on when the trucks needs to drive to the dumpsite or an other street and also vertical bars for that second worker to hold himself by this is what the truck will look like when dumping the litter at the recycle plant or dump site the whole back nicely tilts so that all the litter will fall out of the truck a view on the back of the truck quite a small but yet effective opening the front of the truck only one seat for just the driver but i personally prefer that to a 6 wide truck that fills the total width of the streets and has problems with corners of course set 7991 the orange garbage truck of last year is also nice we also own some of those but we never put them in our lego town since they take too much room and the color scheme of 6693 is also more preferable to us the two panels with the printed recycling pattern are a bit worn so we might recreate the recycle logo and put it on a sticker some day playability 810 like i mentioned it is too bad that the set doesnt have any litter however lego also saw that and has put litter in the 6693 set design 910 a really nice truck with two minifigs and very nice details price 10 i was not able to get any price information at bricklink one can still obtain a 2nd hand one for about 25 overall 810 a set that should be entitled a classic in the same list as the pizza restaurants the 7750 and the blacksmith shop that was all the pictures i was allowed to take since it seems that those brave man still have quite some trash cans to empty thanks guys for doing the dirty work so our minifigs stay happy and our streets stay clean peeron lugnet brickset bricklink entries additional notes on the review my brother has always been keen on garbage trucks however when he became aware of this truck it wasnt available in the stores anymore newer sets that had the recycling theme we not that good they didnt have the emptying mechanism so after our dark ages one of the first sets we bought were some of those nice refuse collection trucks although the new orange truck has the desired mechanisms and thankfully is a decent garbage truck we more like 4 wide trucks than 6 studs wide trucks so for the years to come our lego town inhabitants will still be seeing this great truck to control their waste problems	positive

great to find this review of a classic set and its far better than any yuk set from 1997 omg what were they thinking  i prefer the six wide for trucks but for the 80s it was perfect and even today still holds its own 	positive

i have this one the newer 6571 station is better in some ways but i always liked the big airportstyle fire engine in this and the windows covering the garages one mod project i have in mind is to expand the base adding a second room in the area beneath the control center interestingly this set had two different box pictures there was the original 1989 yellow legoland box and a 1991 blue system box and the blue box has the vehicles in different places quote price usd 8500  gbp unknown  eur unknown if this is referring to the original price it wasnt that much 50 is more like it	neutral

found this set on a flea market in munich yesterday just 25 years after its release the instructions for a total of five models two of them printed the other 3 are just photo instructions in the book it still has the box in good shape despite some wear from the age sadly five little pieces were missing and 5 wrong pieces inside instead 2 complete wheels and a classic 80s90s plane wing dumped into my bricks but i was able to replace the missing minifig torch and the 4 missing plates with identical pieces from my collection the box and contents the set still has the original box inside the pieces plastic insert instructions and a 1987 technic catalogue imagine that set livespan today four years and the 8841 is still in the catalogue classic technic design from early 80s showing a function drawing of the steering and the main model a small set but with a flap shoeing the contents all pieces in the inner box and the papers included 5th model soapbox racer this is more or less a soapbox racer with working steering but no engine its got a rather blocky design but still looks sleek enough and is a simple build little over 100 pcs out of 180 the soapbox at step 2 just included the steering at step 6 completed and ready to race downhill total 710 simple but effective 4th model simple chassis very simple and boring alternate using just 13 of the 180 pieces in the set it even hasnt got a seat construction its just a plain steering mechanism attached on wheels with a spartan chassis of just a few pieces this is the whole model at step 5 just attach the steering mechanism and wheels and youre done total the worst alternate model of the complete set just a boring 410 3rd model balance very original small model its a small model of a working classic balance and it works with small parts laid on the scales altough theyve got just a 4x4 footprint its a fast build just 15 minutes and youve done it the model as it looks at step 3 finished easy build with just 63pcs out of 180 total very original model it actually works with small weights but a very simple build still a 710 alternate model tractor with equipment this is the second model its a simple but boxy design featuring a harrow and a plough the tractor has a similar design to the very first tractor set but much smaller the plough is about 24wide and the harrow is completely snotted even back in 1983 has two functions working steering and the coupler for the equipment uses almost all pieces of the set the tractor at step 8 the steering isnt completely attached now this is the completed tractor the complete harrow finished alternate with the plough attached total nice but quite ugly and boxy design for a tractor with 4 wheels of the same size takes me to a 610 main model desert racer this is the main model with a nice for early 80s but boxy design it has two functions steering and a working 1cylinder rear engine which is of the old 2x2 piston type since the small piston design wasnt invented back then this is the only model of the set which has piece callouts in the instructions the printed alternate model has no callouts they werent invented on both models back in 1983 the three smaller photo instruction alternates have a piece callout at the beginning showing all needed pieces the seat is a nice but blocky design and use a primitive snot technique this is the model at step five the piston is already attached imagine this state on step 5 in modern sets back then lego had challenging instructions not the step madness like today this is the engine just made of plates with a hole in the middle for the piston step 9 the piston engine is completed on step 12 the roll bar and the seat are installed only the steering isnt completed yet front view of the finished model just 15 steps needed back then birds eye view of the whole set displayed on the box model verdict nice design especially the colorful seat in snot technique but quite boxy especially the engine since there were only the huge pistons still a 910 set verdict design and models 710 very boxy designs due to the age the chassis alternate sucks build 910 classic 80s technic building quite challenging but fun sturdyness 710 rear section damaged after the table fall but rather easily fixed fun 910 blast from the past overall 810 mfg widdi edited by widdi 07 september 2008  0411 pm	positive
nice classic set are those hoses around the engine pneumatic tubes that technic catalog looks interesting too i have the catalogs for the next several years but not that one quote this is the model at step five the piston is already attached imagine this state on step 5 in modern sets back then lego had challenging instructions not the step madness like today the most extreme example of this was the engine step in the 8865 set which uses over 120 pieces by itself	neutral

freddie on sep 7 2008 1152 pm said a very nice review jopiek you know i was wondering how lego could justify having two 12vpowered passenger trains at the same time but after reading the review and seeing the lack of figures and accessories i guess i understand why plus the train is rather compact oh and i cant help but think that the chairs in the middle carriage are somewhat oddly placed because those placed next to the door are unusable because the door takes up room needed for figs arms also it appears that your set also has the newer couplers ie theres no hooks for the decoupling rail to grab hold of with the light assembly it really wont matter playwise or if you dont have any decouplers but its still a bit of a bummer the chair was just loose so it should be placed on the 2x2 plate that is also visible in the picture of the middle car btw the front magnet is the old type i have some decouplers but we dont use them because they are not really that reliable lego just release a whole line of trains at the same time i just discussed with my parents and they told be lego had those sets longer in store back then i must have gotten the 7745 somewhere in 1983 or even 1984 although it was released in 1981 i started of with the 7710 push along train and then upgraded the tracks with current rails when i got the 7745	positive

a great review for a great set thanks for sharing it with us a like the older lego trains btw i think you need to fix this quote name jetport fire squad light and sound series	positive
a set from the golden age of lego it brings back a lot childhood memories seeing this review i was 5 and just starting to play with lego around that time i could look for hours the lego catalogs dreaming of sets like this one thanks for this wonderful review	positive
the best 12v legotrain is for me the 7740 the 7725 is still a goodlooking train and the only one with short wagons in a electric version before i started to with bricklink i started to build this train in blue ive build 4 trains of it and sold 2 of them still one for sale  you can also build this in other colors like a yellow one or you can build a black version which i made a death train of it driven by a skeleton  edited by panda9001100 17 may 2009  0801 am	positive

beach cruisers set  6445 theme island xtreme stunts year released 2002 piece count 97 minifigs 2 list price 7 usd during a trip to legoland california in 2002 their big store had a neat little display of some new sets and themes including island xtreme stunts the new theme offered great colors including orange tan and light blue which immediately caught my eye the theme focussed on island fun with some adventure and included some great figs like the brickster i had to buy at least one set choosing truck  stunts trike review coming soon at the time the theme was short lived and many of the sets were on sale at discount toy stores not too long after their initial release i picked up this set 6445 beach cruisers for 333 usd which will be my first of three island xtreme stunt reviews starting with the box a race between the street surfer and skate boarder the back shows some alternate models including a sail boat and jet ski same image on the instructions as the box but the backside shows the island xtreme stunts video game for different platforms the set includes a small decal sheet for the skateboard i love the two figs included within this set one is a hippietype with shades and leafed muscle short and the other pizza boy skateboarder check out the pizza boy on his skateboard two green brackets are included for attaching each fig to the long grey bar using this piece one can make the skateboarder do tricks and flips the street surfer vehicle is pretty nice to the sail is placed on a black bar and lance then attached to the vehicle heres a picture of the vehicle to me it has that old soap box derby look to it  like something kids would create to race down a hill the vehicle doesnt have a steering wheel but rather two levers which i think work well in the cockpit heres the underside the set has three neon orange wheels that attach to technic axle pins to attach to the vehicle lastly the entire set with a few extra pieces final thoughts while island xtreme stunts is not the best citytown subtheme esp for the traditional lego classic town fan it does have some fun sets like this little beach cruiser good figs a skateboard and a very rollable fun word equivalent to swooshable but for vehicles with wheels vehicle you can even blow on the sail to get it to roll across the floor this set is a lot of fun	neutral
like whitefang i too only remember this line in computer game form i used to love that game i actually have never seen a review for an xtreme stunts set so this was nice to see as for the set i think it looks pretty good i really like the hippie guy the windboard thing is nice as well but looks a bit strange somehow i give this set a solid 3 out of 5 thanks for the nice review edited by erdbeereis1 08 september 2008  0405 am	positive
nice review i got this set not long after my ending of the dark ages it was even then already on slae for just 5 euro i like the figs and the vehicles it were some of my first orange pieces the hippie guy is called  snap lockit and the pizza guy is called  pepper roni i think the legodesigners had a cosy evening with much beer when they thought about the names i think this line was the only line which was made first as computergame and after that as a real line instead of the other computergames based on already existing lines	neutral
her name was sky lane its quite sad though to actually play the gamethe xtreme tower is the only set that made it into the game itself and it was a really watered down version of the information center from the first two games but the island was in the game filled with incredible buildings that would have made really cool sets	negative
air chase woosh the bricksters seaplane flies over the beach quickly hippie dude is in close pursuit on his hang glider fuel is running out for the bricksters plane can hippie dude catch him before he either gets away or crash lands in the water you decide with island xtreme stunts air chase set  6735 theme island xtreme stunts year released 2002 piece count 83 minifigs 2 list price 10 usd a nice addition to the island xtreme stunts theme air chase includes two air vehicles a seaplane and hang glider the set has nice island colors inclusing white light blue and orange also includes in the set are some great chrome pieces for the bricksters airplane wings starting with the box you can see hippie dude in close pursuit the back of the box depicts some nice alternate jet skis same front box picture on the instructions and on the backside pictures of the video game air chase includes two nicely detailed figs hippie dude for lack of his official name and the brickster heres a picture of the orange hangglider and the underside unfortunately the hangglider is too heavy to be held up by a minigig while i like the brickbuilt glider for the extra pieces the plastic wing pieces from the ninja theme would have worked effectively and be a lot lighter i think the seaplane is the best part of the set heres a shot of the front end i like the skeletal sharkfish design whats great is none of the pieces use stickers they are all printed including the tail end although the cockpit has no steering wheel or lever piece it does have a very nice printed 1x2 tile the wings of the airplane have hinges to allow them to fold inward slightly also notice the nice chromesilver pieces heres a shot of the underside of the seaplane and lastly the complete set final thoughts air chase is another one of those fun island sets two figs with two vehicles make a perfect combination for creating some dogfights in the air at the same time the bricksters plane can land in the water to explore other adventure play opportunities this set is also a nice addition to the island xtreme stunts truck  stunt trikes 6739 the seaplane can be hauled by the large semitruck included within 6739 hope you enjoy this review	neutral
nice review is that one minifig breaking out of prison just wondering about his clothing the worst thing is the name anything with xtreme in the title almost deserves the lowest score possible on principle	negative

this is a really nice small set i think it fascinates me that those are actual printed parts thats something we dont see too often anymore the figures are very good although i must say i like the name hippie dude better than snap lockitt does anyone know why the brickster has one blue hand thanks for the great review edited by erdbeereis1 09 september 2008  0645 pm	positive
it is not very often that i rate a legoset poor its the first time actually but in this case i had no other option the idea of this set is good and i like the mostly yellow minifig but the design of both the airplane weird windowpiece a propellor that is way too small minimal skies underneath and a strange colourscheme and the hangglider two handlebars on the wings too many colours makes the set mark the essence of legos downfall during those years i really appreciate the fact that you made a review of this set brickster it made me look into the details of 6735 but i am just as sure today as i was back then i will never buy this anyway thanks for the review the quality of the set may be a disapointment your review certainly is not	negative
hello all eurobricks members and town lovers today i will be doing up a review on glade runner set this is a very small set which is slightly bigger than the current impulse set its part of the race theme which involved in land and sea racers back in the early 1990s i just love these orignal race themes which is produced back then name glade runner theme lego system  town  race year 1993 pieces 29 minifigs 1 price usd325 an image of a 6513 glade runner swamp race shall begins this glade runner is pretty nice looking with its sleek sports look well for a glade runner in the water it certainly looks much impressive somehow i felt that the 6513 is aligned with the 6514 trail ranger i always had that perception that both vehicles are brothers and was released under the same year in fact glade runner was released in 1993 based on peeron information i always felt that this set is used for investigators or police to used for tracking or search purposes in the swamp areas instead of using it for a race i will place this set in the jungle somewhere like bricksters jungle settings although it looks too bright for such serious agenda but i think its pretty useful to use it this way they can rent it from the nearby shop and used it to search it kind of reminded me of the movie us marshals which acted by tommy lee jones and wesley snipes meet the ace please pardon his trousers i did not bleach it earlier it was caused overtime without adequate caring to the minfig look at this great article on how to protect your lego the driver wears a green vest with patch pockets on both sides this is my favourite design during that period it comes with a yellow lifevest too as for the 1x4 printed tile with 3 stars shining in front of the runner its a very nice printed tile that can be used for other racing purposes in other sets as well overall design the built is very simple and yet so realistic making use of the aeroplane tailhead to add as the holder for the rotor is smart the white bricks acting as a platform for both sides to hold the driver to sit onto the centre with the steering wheel at the front i am very happy with this design place the glade runner in front of the fan with a reasonable fan speed you will see the rotor runs like a charm different angles of the vehicle close encounter with the swamp sharks coined by brickster see you later to conclude this is a very nice little set that can provide much fun i dont really used it to race in the waters instead i leave it to my imagination and used it for police investigation purposes such as air crash excerise search and rescue operations and etc i think it can provides quite a fun loving experience although the set might not be very appealing to some people but i find it very fun to play around and is one of my favourite sets in the 1990s where i placed it with my 6514 trail ranger together summary review playability 8510 i leave it to your imagnination design 910 very simple yet realistic design price 1010 a very inexpensive set great way to buy such small sets at a low price overall 8510 glade runner is not common in town and city theme its not a must to have it but if you ever come across it do get it i gave it a 4 based on my review score card what about yours hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated	positive
thanks erdbeereis1 for your kind words glad you liked this set just wondering whom has rated poor and below average i will like to know why you voted this way perhaps you could share with me and the rest on your thoughts and views	neutral

what would we do without the trucks of legoland to clean up our town well i didnt want to find out so i bought this set straight away 7991 recycle truck set info set name 7991 recycle truck released 2007 theme city price usd 1499gbp 1299eur 1495 pieces 206 minifigs 1 review time leading off the box the front shows the recycle man loading up the trash can one thing here is really bizarre on lego sh and everywhere else it says that this set is called recycle truck which makes sense as it has a recycle logo on the truck however on my box it says the set is called garbage truck has this happened to anyone else or is it just me here is the back of the box which shows some of the things you can do with this set the bags with this set you get 3 bags which are numbered and do you see what i see yes thats right the dss is in a bag so it doesnt get bent why tlg doesnt do this more often is beyond me bag 1 the set comes with a very nice selection of pieces a large number of these are orange manual silly me i forgot to take a picture of the front of the manual the picture is the same as on the front of the box the back shows some of the 2007 city sets in a nice little scene and inside minifig here is the friendly garbagerecycle man he looks nice but with the same head as so many other city figs before him come on tlg give us some new heads the sticker sheet the stickers actually are pretty decent as far as stickers go i like the recycle sign after bag 1 this is where we stand after the first bag is built bag  2 the parts contained in the second bag more nice orange pieces here extra parts some nice 1x1 slopes and 1x1 round plates everything built now that everything is built lets check it out the design of the set is very nice and the color scheme looks great when you see it you immediately know what it is the back has a droid arm that acts as a handle to dump the trashrecycling in the truck its simple but works well here you can see the dumping mechanism it works by a sliding technic beam with a stopper on top of the truck you can store the workers cart this works really well i think though that the top of the truck overall looks a bit jumbled up with a few too many different colors the bottom trash dumping time this is a good feature of the set a very well built snot front section this looks fantastic with the grills and number plate sticker someone has left a big mess on the street brickshelf folder ratings price 1010 for 15 this is a very good deal at 206 pieces parts 910 lots of orange design 910 a very well designed set especially the front playability 910 the trash dumper is fun and the added broom and cart make for good play value build 810 simple but stayed interesting overall4550 brickset lego sh bricklink peeron taking out the trash summary this is a great small set for the price with fun features nice colors and good design i would certainly recommend this set no matter what its really called thanks and happy building	positive
this is one of those sets that make me really want to start building up a city its a great value has a lot of useful pieces and is just plain fun to play with i do miss vehicles having doors though great review i was a bit curious as to how the dumping mechanism worked as well as the sticker count	positive
i own this set and i think its a really nice truck but there is two little details that i didnt like  1 a recycle truck really needs 2 minifig one to drive one to put the garbage on the back 2 the big hole behind the driver seat it was easy to fill it like this  with hole pouf  no more little hole but this is really a great set anyway 45 for me  above average 	positive
nice review this is a very nice vehicle one of my favorite of the newer city ones jopiek there are two generations of road plate that are wide enough for sixwide vehicles like this the current plates are dark grey with plain white printing and look not great in my opinion the previous ones are imo the best road plates of all time  green with dark grey road white dotted linezebras drain covers and yellow verge markings just like we really have here in ireland for urban area i would still choose the greenedged plates and just cover up the green  the markings are so much better than the current plates	neutral

jopiek on sep 10 2008 0145 am said also it will not empty completely because of that panel actually it does the back part of the truck with the panel hinges up so that when you want the truck to dump it doesnt get in the way	positive
a good set with a nice color scheme i still prefer the last one that had a removable bin	positive
what a great set and a very nice review erdbeereis i think the only improvement to this set would have been the use of chrome exhaust pipes and front grill i bought this set with a lot of excitement but unfortunately have not put it together yet what are your thoughts on these larger 6stud wide detailed vehicles as opposed to 4stud wide classics heres an image of 6668 recycle truck released in 1992 ps i like the use of taking out sponge bob in your review	positive

thanks for the review this is one of the few city sets that i own despite loving the theme so much most of my town is either custom or classic and its about as beautiful as a big garbage truck can ever be quote nice truck indeed but the yellow one is better i think at least if you put them on a roadplate it seems to me that those road plates are too small for that also it will not empty completely because of that panel well for the rest it is a nice set and a fine review well the truck barely fits onto the old roadplates not on curves though so if you put it in a display it probably wont look bad i think from what i see this and all the other 6 wide vehicles will fit much better on the newer roadplates which are four studs wider than the old ones	positive
hi i bought this set a while ago and have since remodeled it into a larger 8 wide truck now it can hold a driver and passenger its kind of boxy i may redesign it in the future	neutral
thats a really nice mod badsneaker the added bulk serves it well	positive
nice review i realy need to pick up this set and the cement truck too	positive
it would be cool if someone made a moc in which hippies steal the truck and cover it with flowers and bright colors and stuff	neutral
