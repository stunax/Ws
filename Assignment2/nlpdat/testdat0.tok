unknown
as
part
of
the
classic
space
collection
lego
offered
two
sets
of
moon
plates
one
was
a
set
of
two
crater
plates
and
the
other
this
very
useful
landing
plate
set
not
much
to
review
but
worth
sharing
a
few
images
the
landing
plate
and
tplate
the
two
plates
connect
to
form
this
very
nice
classic
space
landing
platform
set
497
galaxy
explorer
included
the
landing
platform
but
the
one
that
i
had
was
lighter
in
color
than
the
one
contained
in
this
set
at
least
the
yellow
circle
future
lego
space
sets
could
benefit
by
having
similar
road
plates

said
actually
with
only
2
plates
i
could
not
do
much
serious
expansion
with
it
instead
i
merged
it
with
my
old
city
baseplates
and
used
it
as
a
docking
station
for
scientific
purposes
or
restricted
facilities
that
is
guarded
by
the
police
you
make
a
very
good
point
there
ive
used
these
plates
to
represent
restricted
areas
and
even
as
simple
airport
runways
beyond
their
space
uses
i
never
liked
the
black
plates
they
were
during
my
dark
ages
anyway
so
ive
never
really
seen
one
up
close
but
i
have
seen
them
used
in
a
death
star
display
as
suggested
and
it
turned
out
fairly
well
quote
oh
how
i
love
these
plates
afew
years
ago
i
found
a
local
retail
store
with
about
67
sets
of
these
in
their
basement
warehouse
i
was
given
special
access
to
along
with
many
other
old
space
goodies
hehe
i
love
the
things
i
have
loads
and
ive
used
them
for
multiple
space
bases
and
battles
along
with
afew
grey
crater
plates
and
the
large
grey
plates
15x
the
size
of
a
normal
baseplate
you
can
get
quite
a
monorail
layout
going
sigh
i
should
really
clean
up
and
get
one
set
up
again
so
i
can
take
some
pictures
wow
nice
you
probably
have
enough
to
make
that
scene
on
the
box
picture
i
got
one
pack
off
ebay
a
while
ago
and
have
another
octagon
plate
from
the
blacktron
6988
base
im
building
my
carrier
moc
around
one
but
dont
have
anything
planned
for
the
others
these
baseplates
are
still
relatively
common
on
ebay
for
their
age
i
see
misb
packs
on
there
every
few
weeks
and
they
tend
to
sell
for
around
20
the
older
kind
in
the
op
are
much
harder
to
come

said
by
looking
at
the
pictures
used
to
display
this
set
ive
a
sneaky
suspicion
it
did
not
come
with
instructions
but
meant
for
the
pictures
to
be
ideas
the
whole
set
was
suppose
to
teach
children
to
use
their
imagination
giving
them
instructions
would
somewhat
defeat
this
while
trying
to
figure
how
to
build
things
from
looking
at
pictures
would
be
a
much
better
educational
experience
but
i
dont
wan
na
use
my
imagination
great
review
sinner
i
own
the
later
version
709
released
in
1977
mine
no
longer
has
decals
though
the
variations
were
minimal
it
looks
like
your
boat
is
in
really
good

its

my
parents
always
needed
to
keep
my
quiet
during
the
3day
trip
and
the
best
way
to
do
that
was
to
buy
me
a
lego
set
this
still
works
nowadays
quote
i
often
saw
large
quantities
of
lego
sets
in
those
gas
stations
though
i
remember
seeing
yellow
castle
and
the
galaxy
explorer
standing
on
a
shelf
these
were
the
times
although
i
donÂ
´
t
recall
lego
sets
in
fuel
stations
in
the
past
i
would
appreciate
to
see
lego
on
the
go
now
itÂ
´
s
holiday
time
and
i
have
two
sons
you
know
nice
review
mariko
this
set
is
way
past
my
time
the
baseplate
is
okay
though
i
hate
those
dots
the
car
is
pretty
cool
too
great
review
i
never
had
this
set
but
it
looks
nice
i
really
like
the
checker
pattern
near
the
big
window
theres
two
alternates
on
the
back
of
the
instructions
and
as
i
recall
some
sort
of
bridge
on
the
inner
fold
or
back
of
box
i
threw
away
the
box
to
this
set
years
ago
just
lucky
to
still
have
all
the
pieces
with
standard
pieces
you
can
build
all
these
alternates
and
many
more
thats
why
i
dont
particularly
care
for
the
new
castles
like
vladeks
they
make
building
so
difficult
and
duplicate
pieces
are
so
limited
heres
an
old
shot
of
the
castle
in
the
city
that
it
use
to
guard
we
played
for
hours
back
in
these
days
great
review
it
is
nice
to
see
an
indepth
photo
review
of
this
set
i
especially
love
the
last
picture
of
your
old
city
it
certainly
does
bring
back
memories
yup
that
is
very
very
nicei
wish
i
had
been
alive
back
then
d
well
ill
never
have
a
chance
to
own
something
like
this
so
this
is
as
close
ill
get
to
it
thanks
for
showing
me
the
greatness
toothbrush
and
mild
soap
and
lots
of
time
gently
scrubbing
a

from

i
opened
the
shield
images
then
copied
and
pasted
them
into
powerpoint
they
do
need
to
be
resized
in
us
i
converted
them
to
59
inch
width
you
could
do
the
same
in
cm
by
converting
to
15
cm
wide
i
did
the
same
with
the
torso
stickers
same
ratio
i
ended
up
with
a
powerpoint
sheet
of
multiple
shields
and
torso
designs
printed
on
sticker
pages
from
a
good
quality
photoprinter
gives
you
very
nice
stickers
the
hard
part
is
cutting
them
the
results
are
the
four
knights
pictured

the
web

also
has

and
custom

looking
at
the

date
of
this

makes
me
remember
the
good
old
times
when
lego
sets
stayed
in
production
and
could
be
found
in
stores
for
long
years
yes
i
hear
you
younger
fols
say
this
meant
we
had
less
variety
at
the
time
but
at
least
we
did
not
have
to
go
on
a
frenzy
to
get
them
all
in
just
1
or
2
years
before
they
disappeared
to
reappear
on
the
secondary
market
at
crazy
prices
anyway
i
also
realise
this
set
is
older
than
me
by
5
years
at
least
the
first
boxes
of
this
set
i
think
my
parents
bought
it
when
i
was
something
like
12
year
old
or
even
before
as
my
father
really
liked
the
hobby
set
line
and
took
any
chance
to
get
one
you
know
for
the
kids
when
theyâ
$
™
ll
be
old
enough
to
play
with
themâ
$
¦
i
am
really
happy
my
father
did
it
too
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
has
always
been
one
of
my
favourite
nonminifigure
scale
sets
i
know
younger
eyes
will
look
on
it
and
wonder
how
we
could
love
and
enjoy
a
model
like
this
so
blocky
and
rough
just
remember
this
was
the
best
tlg
designers
could
do
with
the
bricks
available
at
the
time
enough
about
memories
letâ
$
™
s
start
with
the
review
the
box
front
the
front
of
the
box
here
cut
and
folded
to
save
space
shows
the
harley
davidson
1000cc
in
all
its
glory
upon
a
nice
town
landscape
i
really
appreciate
how
tlg
box
designers
used
a
real
life
photo
of
the
model
in
a
real
life
environment
to
give
this
hobby
set
a
better
background
moreover
the
landscape
does
not
distract
the
eye
even
with
its
lights
since
the
focus
is
strongly
set
on
the
motorbike
itself
back
and
sides
the
back
of
the
box
shows
the
model
on
a
more
neutral
background
and
from
another
angle
we
can
see
the
stickers
in
place
take
a
good
look
at
them
here
because
i
did
not
apply
them
the
right
side
we
also
see
a
pic
of
the
set
from
the
front
and
one
with
a
child
playing
with
it
in
this
latter
shot
the
model
rests
upon
a
nice
black
box
with
a
harley
davidson
sign
on
it
i
frankly
do
not
remember
if
this
was
some
sort
of
tray
or
smaller
box
within
the
lego
one
or
if
it
is
meant
for
publicity
only
another
thing
we
can
notice
on
the
rightmost
side
of
the
box
is
a
white
band
right
below
the
lego
logo
sporting
the
sign
â

in

really
well

contents
inside
this

a
number
of
parts
in
mainly
black
white
and
light
grey
some
blue
and
yellow
add
nice
touches
of
colour
to
the
total
the
partsâ
$

selection
is
not
mindblowing
as
most
of
the
pieces
had
been
in
production
in
these
same
colours
for
years
anyway
iâ
$
™
d
like
to
focus
on
a
couple
of
details
the
milky
white
technic
axles
as
well
as
the
red
technic
bush
old
2
are
among
my
favourite
parts
the
bushes
in
particular
are
quite
useful
to
build
more
sturdy
looking
tubes
than
what
can
be
achieved
with
the
newer
and
slimmer
ones
it
would
seem
that
the
tile
pieces
appeared
in
the
â
$
˜without
groveâ
$

version
as
a
standard
and
in
the
â

though
that
the

the

this

success

with

bricks
again
nonetheless

m

that
people

``
here
we
see
the
full
name
of
the
set
harleydavidson
flh
1200
this
makes
me
wonder
why
is
this
set
known
as
394
harley
davidson
1000cc
when
it
is
indeed
a
1200cc
anyway
what
really
makes
me
love
this
page
is
the
list
of
stats
below
the
photo
and
in
particular
these
two
lines
hp
not
given
this
calls
for
just
one
question
why
did
harleydavidson
not
release
this
info
my
opinion
is
that
since
this
is
a
motorbike
built
for
the
police
they
did
not
have
permission
to
share
the
specifications
on
the
motor
which
was
probably
customised
either
by
harleydavidson
upon
request
or
by
the
police
themselves
â
$
˜random
pageâ
$
™
â
$
``
as
expected
no
callouts
here
but
the
build
is
pretty
straight
forward
and
does
not
need
them
apart
for
one
passage
weâ
$
™
ll
see
later
the
colours
are
easy
to
tell
apart
in
the
end
there
is
no
dark
grey
in
this
set
that
could
be
confused
with
black
again
notice
how
the
instructions
include
the
â
$
˜with
groveâ
$
™
tiles
and
not
the
older
ones
maybe
this
was
changed
during
the
long
time
this
set
stayed
in
production
the
â
$
˜last
pageâ
$
™
shows
other
four
models
included
in
the
hobby
set
line
unfortunately
i
own
only
one
of
them
the
396
thatcher
perkins
locomotive
indeed
i
would
have
liked
to
have
them
all
building
start
the
handle
bars
look
a
bit
too
squared
to
me
but
itâ
$
™
s
just
a
minor
feature
and
the
overall
shape
is
still
good
in
my
opinion
notice
the
red
hinge
plate
which
will
be
almost
totally
hidden
in
the
finished
model
see
below
and
the
blue
tiles
which
work
as
indicators
the
first
steps
used
to
build
the
front
wheel
and
windshield
are
really
easy
until
you
get
to
the
wheel
in
facts
the
instructions
do
not
show
clearly
all
the
pieces
needed
for
it
and
i
found
myself
with
a
â
$
˜floatingâ
$
™
wheel
for
the
absence
of
one
of
the
red
technic
bush
old
2
on
one
side
the
one
not
visible
on
the
instructions
of
course
not
a
big
deal
but
something
that
could
have
been
done
better
motor
and
seat
the
second
part
of
the
build
includes
the
motor
seat
and
â
$
˜saddle
bagsâ
$
™
the
technique
used
for
the
motor
or
better
the
radiator
is
very
clever
to
get
the
ridged
feel
tlg
designers
used
4
light
grey
plates
stuck
one
on
the
other
but
not
completely
in
contact
this
way
the
studs
while
keeping
the
plates
in
position
keep
them
raised
from
one
another
at
the
same
time
the
yellow
round
bricks
add
some
details
and
colour
touches
to
this
predominantly
light
grey
parts
of
the
vehicle
the
use
of
the
engine
smooth
small
1
x
2
side
plates
for
the
exhaust
pipes
while
quite
clever
still
looks
a
bit
strange
to
me
iâ
$
™
m
mostly
used
to
see
them
in
airplanes
helicopters
and
spaceships
â
$
˜saddlebagsâ
$
™
a
simple
build
for
one
of
the
iconic
parts
of
this
motorcycle
here
you
see
them
in
place
as
well
as
get
a
look
at
the
finished
seat
i
like
how
lego
designers
managed
to
make
its
shape
with
just
a
few
quite
big
bricks
the
â
$
˜saddle
bagsâ
$
™
are
a
really
nice
touch
and
they
work
perfectly
when
compared
to
the
original
this
is
the
rear
wheel
as
said
before
only
when
you
get
to
this
passage
in
the
instruction
you
get
a
real
understanding
of
how
the
front
wheel
is
supposed
to
be
mounted
as
well
careful
readers
will
notice
how
this
is
not
one
of
the
original
wheels
in
this
set
the
original
ones
were
mounted
using
the
technic
gear
expert
builder
9
tooth
unfortunately
i
could
only
find
one
of
them
in
my
collection
an
itâ
$
™
s
used
as
the
front
wheel
by
adding
the
rear
wheel
which
is
shown
from
a
better
angle
in
the
instructions
we
complete
the
model
notice
how
the
two
technic
bricks
supporting
the
wheel
are
held
in
position
by
two
2x1
plates
i
think
this
was
a
bad
case
of
â
$
˜building
by
compartmentsâ
$
™
mentality
if
tlg
designers
had
considered
this
a
bit
more
they
would
have
used
2
4x1
plates
instead
of
4
2x1
on
the
other
hand
this
is
not
the
worst
case
i
have
seen
in
a
lego
set
and
they
keep
up
the
tradition
nowadays
too
finished
set
front
and
here
it
is
our
fancy
police
harleydavidson
indeed
the
front
looks
blocky
and
quite
horrible
to
our
eyes
but
again
it
was
almost
the
best
that
could
be
done
at
the
time
i
only
wish
they
had
made
it
a
little
less
bulky
even
though
this
build
is
clearly
thought
to
give
better
stability
to
the
wheel
the
blue
tiles
work
nicely
to
emphasise
the
indicators
the
slightly
unsightly
red
plate
is
normally
covered
by
the
plate
sticker
and
the
windshield
albeit
being
hard
to
see
through
is
nicely
shaped
back
the
back
side
is
less
detailed
than
the
front
but
shows
the
red
light
and
antenna
which
are
typical
of
the
police
motorbikes
from
this
period
how
many
times
have
we
seen
this
angle
in
the
chase
scenes
from
tv
shows
like
â
$
œchipsâ
$
side
all
in
all
this
model
looks
pretty
sturdy
apart
for
the
antenna
which
falls
off
all
too
easily
and
detailed
especially
considering
the
limited
variety
of
parts
available
and
used
at
the
time
they
even
got
so
far
to
put
a
2x2
tile
as
kickstand
to
display
it
without
fear
of
it
falling
on
the
sides
bonus
images
size
comparison
what
i
never
understood
about
this
set
is
what
scale
it
is
meant
to
be
i
mean
it
is
clearly
not
minifigscale
and
it
could
not
be
technicfigscale
those
came
later
but
it
is
not
even
miniland
scale
moreover
the
only
other
model
with
the
same
scale
is
the
other
hobby
set
motorbike
as
the
cars
have
a
scale
of
their
own
and
the
thatcher
uses
still
another
one
final
comments
overall
this
is
a
great
set
for
collectors
of
old
models
and
motorbike
fans
or
both
it
does
not
sport
a
huge
variety
of
bricks
but
was
a
good
choice
at
the
time
and
even
if
the
result
is
matteroffact
blocky
when
compared
to
the
original
it
implements
some
good
solutions
to
minimise
the
lego
brick
appearance
and
maximise
the
similarity
as
much
as
possible
design
colour
scheme
â
$
``
910
the
design
is
as
accurate
as
possible
apart
for
the
front
mudguard
maybe
and
the
colours
are
completely
in
line
for
a
police
vehicle
the
solutions
and
details
included
in
this
set
justify
the
â
$
˜expert
buildersâ
$
™
label
and
add
to
the
appearance
and
why
not
playability
of
the
model
parts
810
not
a
huge
selection
and
very
few
new
molds
nonetheless
a
good
source
of
black
and
white
standard
parts
for
mocs
and
one
of
the
few
sources
for
the
extra
rare

pieces
playability
910
a
sturdy
model
which
can
take
some
serious
play
and
swooshing
without
falling
apart
the
easily
detachable
antenna
and
the
lack
of
an
appropriate
scale
interaction
with
most
other
models
make
it
lose
one
point
though

pretty
straight
forward
with

nice
solutions
and
an
already
mentioned
slightly
obscure
passage
in
the
instructions
price
510
like
most
older
models
especially
the
hobby
set
and
model
team
ones
this
set
can
be
found
at
reasonable
prices
only
rarely
most
of
the
times
people
are
asked
shameful
prices
for
such
a
smallish

great
job
on
this
review
of
a
unique
and
rare
set
luxorv
considering
the
year
it
was
released
this
must
have
been
a
cool
set
back
then
even
up
to
now
with
all
the
specialized
pieces
and
advanced
building
techniques
i
could
still
appreciate
the
beauty
of
this
brickbuilt
harleydavidson
police
motorbike
the
various
elements
are
instantly
recognizable
and
it
even
has
the
unusual
partlystacked
plates
technique
for
the
motor
overall
id
say
this
is
an
above
average
set
that
is
a
musthave
for
any
hardcore
lego
collector
luxorv
this
is
an
awesome

the
classicness
of
this

is
just
lovely
its
so

with
this

far
as
i
remember
i
got

my
2nd
birthday
i
think
but
it
is
not
my

youll

more
on
this
in
my
next
planned
review
thanks
luxorv
for
this

my
father
assures
me
this
is
the
very
first
lego
set
i
ever
got
in
facts
he
gave
it
to
me
as
a
present
for
my
first
half
year
of
course
that
is
to
say
he
bought
it
for
himself
and
used
me
as
the
official
excuse
when
i
grew
up
at
first
i
found
it
to
be
quite
boring
no
minifigures
limited
play
features
in
the
end
it
was
just
a
locomotive
it
soon
went
to
forgottenland
then
when
i
was
about
10
years
old
i
one
day
found
again
the
instructionsâ
$
™
â
$
˜bookletâ
$
™
and
saw
this
bright
coloured
big
steam
engine
and
i
suddenly
wanted
to
build
it
again
it
would
seem
i
finally
got
to
the
right
age
at
least
for
me
to
appreciate
the
design
of
this
great
set
but
enough
about
memories
letâ
$

s
start
with
the
review
the
box
front
the
front
of
the
box
here
cut
and
folded
to
save
space
shows
the
thatcher
perkins
locomotive
in
all
its
glory
upon
a
nice
countryside
landscape
i
really
appreciate
how
tlg
box
designers
used
a
real
life
environment
made
of
sand
gravel
and
pebbles
to
give
this
hobby
set
a
better
background
moreover
the
landscape
does
not
distract
the
eye
since
the
focus
is
strongly
set
on
the
locomotive
itself
the
box
measures
about
395
x
245
x
55
centimetres
or
1556
x
965
x
217
inches
this
is
more
or
less
the
size
of
the
4840
the
burrow
or
the
advent
calendars
back
and
sides
the
back
of
the
box
shows
the
model
on
a
more
neutral
background
and
from
another
angle
we
can
see
the
stickers
in
place
take
a
good
look
at
them
here
because
i
did
not

them

we
also
see
a

from
the

and
one

with
it
in
this

the
model
rests
upon
a
nice
black
box
with
a
thatcher
perkins
sign
on
it
unlike
the
harley
davidson
1000cc

the

this

a
large
number
of
parts

black
blue
and
red
with
some
nice
yellow

it
up
more
parts
of
interest
the
partsâ
$

selection
is
not
exceptional
but
weâ
$

ll
see
this
set
includes
some
unique
pieces
which
have
not
been
in
lego
sets
for
long
years
since
the
1980s
like
the
very
nice

2
x
2
old

with
round
bottom
tube
as
you
can
see
in
the
above
picture
this
locomotive
was
designed
to
work
well
be
played
with
on
all
kind
of
surfaces
so
the
wheels
sport
tyres
in
this
picture
you
can

how
they
look
without

of

can
use

many

two
parts
they
were
standard
fare
in
a
number
of
sets
between
the
1960s
and
early
1990s
but
then
unfortunately
they
were
taken
out
of
production
to
be
fair
the
replacement
of
the
black
brick
modified
2
x
4
with
wheels
holder
old
clear
bottom
with
the
standard
technic
parts
was
probably
due
to
the
fact
that
the
metal
pin
used
to
connect
the
wheels
to
these
bricks
had
a
shameful
tendency
at
getting
off
the
wheel
too
bad
it
could
not
be
fixed
and
these
parts
kept
in
production

we
all
know
can
be
a
tricky
medium
to
build
with
and
some
details
need
special
solutions
to
be
completed
we
then
start
building
the
boiler
and
cabin
going
up
fast
and
steady
in
the
penultimate
step
we
build
the
chimney
and
cow
catcher
iâ
$
™
d
like
to
spend
a
few
more
words
on
the
chimney
and
how
it
is
attached
to
the
main
body
as
you
can
see
in
the
left
picture
the
3x3
base
of
the
chimney
is
asymmetrical
with
a
3x2
base
on
one
side
and
a
combination
of
a
1x2
and
a
1x1
plates
on
the
other
in
the
right
picture
you
see
the
top
of
the
main
body
where
the
chimney
will
be
attached
it
is
made
of
a
1x2
base
and
1
1x2
tile
using
another
â
$
˜illegalâ
$
™
technique
or
at
least
one
lego
designers
do
not
like
much
nowadays
the
holes
of
the
3x2
plate
of
the
chimney
will
connect
with
the
studs
of
the
1x2
plate
on
the
main
body
giving
a
well
centred
and
quite
sturdy
build
finished
set
front
the
front
of
the
model
sports
3
big
headlights
a
nice
cow
catcher
and
the
nicely
detailed
engine
front
i
can
almost
hear
it
whistle
side
and
here
it
is
our
good
old
thatcher
perkins
locomotive
indeed
it
looks
like
a
classic
and
powerful
engine
form
one
of
those
spaghetti
western
films
doesnâ
$
™
t
it
what
i
found
strange
in
the
beginning
is
the
choice
of
colours
i
was
convinced
steam
engines
were
all
black
at
the
time
then
i
checked
some
pictures
of
the
original
and
i
must
admit
the
resemblance
is
almost
perfect
back
the
back
side
is
less
detailed
than
the
front
with
cabin
almost
devoid
of
details
i
think
lego
could
have
done
a
better
job
on
it
34
front
and
â
$
¦
just
see
how
good
it
looks
from
this
angle
with
all
the
tubing
moving
parts
and
the
lovely
3
headlights
â
$
¦
34
back
the
back
view
is
not
as
impressive
but
grants
us
a
good
look
at
the
big
posterior
wheels
and
the
bumpers
bonus
images
size
comparison
as
i
stated
elsewhere
i
never
understood
what
scale
these
hobby
sets
are
meant
to
be
they
are
clearly
not
minifigscale
and
they
are
not
technicfigscale
either
but
they
are
not
even
miniland
scale
moreover
they
use
different
scales
between
locomotives
cars
and
motorbikes
amongst
the
hobby
set
line
as
i
said
before
the
set
comes
with
tyres
on
the
wheels
to
allow
a
wider
playing
experience
not
limiting
this
model
to
tracks
nonetheless
builders
can
assemble
their
own
track
maybe
using
the
vintage
blue
45v
tracks
and
make
the
thatcher
perkins
run
its
proper
environment
final
comments
overall
this
is
a
great
set
for
collectors
of
old
models
and
steam
engines
fans
or
both
it
does
not
sport
a
huge
variety
of
bricks
but
was
a
good
choice
at
the
time
and
even
if
the
result
is
matteroffact
a
bit
blocky
when
compared
to
the
original
it
implements
some
good
solutions
to
minimise
the
lego
brick
appearance
and
maximise
the
similarity
as
much
as
possible
design
colour
scheme
â
$
``
810
the
design
is
as
accurate
as
possible
and
the
colours
are
completely
in
line
for
the
thatcher
perkins
locomotive
the
solutions
and
details
included
in
this
set
justify
the
â
$
˜expert
buildersâ
$
™
label
and
add
to
the
appearance
and
why
not
playability
of
the
model
though
i
still
wish
tlg
had
included
more
details
in
the
cabin
parts
1010
quite
a
big
selection
but
only
one
new
mould
nonetheless
a
good
source
of
black
blue
and
red
standard
parts
for
mocs
and
one
of
the
few
sources
for
the
extra
rare
black
plate
modified
1
x
2
with
steam
engine
cylinder
flat
surfaces
black
train

spoked
for
motor
red

steam
drive

rod

wheel
spoked
large
playability
910
a
sturdy
model
which
can
take
some
serious
play
and
swooshing
without
falling
apart
the
somewhat
easily
detachable
chimney
and
the
lack
of
an
appropriate
scale
interaction
with
most
other
models
make
it
lose
one
point
though
build
710
pretty
straight
forward
with
few
nice
solutions
price
510
like
most
older
models
especially
the
hobby
set
and
model
team
ones
this
set
can
only
rarely
be
found
at
reasonable
prices
most
of
the
times
people
are
asked
shameful
prices
for
such
a
smallish
set
overall
810
very
good

you

excellent

btw
its
always
a

getting
a
closer
look
at
these
classic
sets
which
i
wouldnt
have
known
to
exist
had
i
not
seen
this
review
overall
i
think
its
a
really
good
set
at
that
time
of
course
judging
this
one
by
modern
standards
wont
be
fair
but
at
the
time
im
pretty
sure
it
was
a
cool
set
to
have
though
less
cooler
than
having
the
harley
davidson
set
thanks
kiel
i
can
grant
you
thats
the

old
one
i
got
as
my

this

was

under
the
number

outside
of
the
us
ah
classic
legoland
a
time
before
minifigs
ever
existed
and
cars
and
buildings
could
be
made
with
just
a
few
bricks
the
part
selection
was
pretty
basic
bricks
plates
slopes
windows
and
wheels
were
all
you
needed
to
construct
an
entire
town
heavy
machinery
could
be
modeled
in
4wide
and
be
just
a
few
bricks
tall
for
this
review
we
will
be
taking
a
look
at
the
410
payloader
one
of
legoâ
$
™
s
first
sets
of
a
bucket
loader
so
grab
a
hard
hat
we
are
heading
to
the
construction
yard
box
image
courtesy
of
bricklink
box
contents
here
we
have
our
instructions
which
are
obviously
the
older
style
of
lego
instructions
the
steps
used
much
simpler
imagery
but
they
get
the
job
done
they
show
how
to
build
the
payloader
in
seven
steps
this
small
set
has
all
of
28
parts
in
it
the
more
interesting
parts
of
note
are
the
red
digger
arm
the
bucket
the
blue
1x2
brick
with
arm
holes
and
the
blue
2x2
brick
with
the
classic
lego
logo
printed
on
it
construction
in
the
first
few
steps
we
start
building
up
the
base
then
add
the
arms
and
start
building
the
cab
add
the
bucket
the
trailer
socket
and
finish
the
cab
throw
on
some
wheels
completed
set
and
with
that
we
are
finished
with
our
nice
small
model
here
is
the
back
right
side
notice
how
the
back
of
the
cab
was
left
with
an
empty
spot
here
is
the
left
side
notice
how
on
the
top
of
the
arm
they
made
it
so
you
could
just
push
down
on
the
tips
it
to
make
the
arm
lift
instead
of
having
to
grab
by
the
arm
itself
on
the
front
we
have
the
nice
lego
logo
shown
to
remind
the
forgetful
of
what
they
were
playing
with
you
can
also
see
how
much
space
is
in
the
bucket
itself
which
cant
hold
more
than
a
few
small
plates
finally
on
the
back
we
have
the
trailer
socket
this
was
a
nice
addition
to
make
it
able
to
tow
trailers
from
other
sets
like
685
just
donâ
$
™
t
try
to
bring
it
into
your
layout
populated
by
minifigs
they
may
have
a
problem
trying
to
get
in
other
thoughts
considering
this
set
is
nearly
37
years
old
i
myself
am
still
surprised
by
how
well
the
bricks
have
held
up
i
purchased
this
set
from
a
thrift
store
a
year
ago
for
a
mere
25
cents
normally
when
used
lego
is
purchased
you
can
expect
to
see
scratches
marks
wearing
discoloration
etc
but
boy
was
i
surprised
to
see
how
all
these
parts
are
in
mint
condition
even
the
instructions
still
looked
like
they
came
from
a
new
box
and
not
all
ripped
up
and
tattered
the
pieces
still
connect
to
each
other
nice
and
tight
and
the
metal
pieces
for
the
wheels
havent
rusted
this
just
shows
that
with
proper
care
these
things
can
last
a
lifetime
i
really
would
like
to
get
a
small
display
case
to
show
it
off
conclusion
playability
810
in
addition
to
the
standard
of
having
rolling
wheels
you
also
get
a
fully
movable
bucket
assembly
with
it
you
can
pick
up
smaller
pieces
and
unload
them
into
a
dump
truck
design
710
like
all
other
legoland
vehicles
it
has
a
very
basic
design
but
you
can
still
easily
identify
what
it
is
simple
yet
effective
parts
710
like
most
other
older
lego
sets
all
you
really
get
are
a
few
basic
bricks
and
plates
however
you
do
get
a
bucket
assembly
and
the
2x2
brick
with
the
classic
lego
logo
on
it
is
very
cool
it
was
also
nice
of
lego
to
include
the
trailer
socket
so
you
could
tow
around
your
trailers
price
810
bricklinks
history
shows
them
to
sell
for
around
10
usd
used
while
that
is
a
bit
much
for
a
set
this
size
it
is
pretty
good
considering
this
set
is
over
37
years
old
however
if
you
are
looking
for
a
new
boxed
set
be
prepared
to
fork
over
about
50
usd
overall
810
this
small
machine
would
make
a
nice
addition
to
your
collection
as
a
reminder
of
legos
past

are

this
little

was
my
smallest
classic
space
set
believe
it
or
not
i
still
have
the
box
heres
the
back
the
instructions
are
pretty
tattered
and
missing
a
section
i
had
to
download
some
from
the
web
but
the
ship
is
again
intact
missing
only
one
grey
1x3
plate
ive
always
liked
this
computer
piece
heres
the
under

this
set
included
the
small
classic
jet
engines
a
closeup
of
the
sloped
printed
space
brick
and
the
complete
set
with
minifig
this
set
was
a
great
little
space
ship
that
made
a
nice
addition
to
the
blue
space
theme
as
small
as
it
was
it
could
hold
twothree
figs
one
standing
up
i
dont
even
think
the
mars
mission
recon
drop
ship
holds
three
figs
in
any
case
it
was
a
musthave
for
blue
space
fans
and
probably
only
a
few
bucks
back
in
the
day
swoosh
this
classic
space
shuttle
is
simply
superb
i
love
the
layout
of
this
shuttle
in
fact
it
reminded
me
as
one
of
the
space
fighter
jet
that
roam
around
in
space
defending
the
boundaries
from
intruders
i
just
love
these
old
grey
bricks
very
much
and
the
printed
computer
brick
is
just
lovely
its
such
a
pity
that
i
did
not
grow
up
with
classic
space
in
my
childhood
these
are
actually
great
stuff
and
formed
the
base
of
the
space
theme
in
lego
brickster
thanks
again
for
another
outstanding
classic
review
this
was
my
first
space
set
ever
1979
1980
dont
know
anymore
but
i
do
remember
i
got
this
together
with
897
for
my
birthday
when
we
where
camping
with
a
little
luck
i
may
even
have
an
old
film
from
my
dad
opening
the
boxes
well
what
to
say
it
looked
soooooo
aggressive
with
those
two
engines
but
i
never
knew
why
you
needed
two
steering
wheels
on
it
they
probably
just
thought
a
symmetrical
model
was
better
i
cant
blame
them
what
a
nice
set
it
would
even
sell
today
no
doubt
looooots
of
swooshability
indexed
everyone
remembers
their
first
time
for
me
it
was
in
19coughsomethingsomethingcough
we
were
at
her
house
and
her
mother
was
gone
for
at
least
an
hour
she
slowly
unzi
uhhh
sorry
wrong
story
um
yeahh
anyway
i
do
remember
my
first
time
it
was
1977
in
late
summer
our
neighbor
who
worked
for
a
department
store
called
famousbahr
said
that
the
main
store
had
a
travelling
lego
display
so
my
family
filed
into
the
car
and
drove
into
downtown
st
louis
to
see
this
display
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
dont
remember
much
about
the
display
itself
but
i
do
remember
that
my
parents
bought
me
my
first
lego

the

that

came

side
view
well
there
she
is
my
first

ever
actually
i

to
recall
the
real
spirit
of
st
louis
was
silver
colored
not
black
and
yellow
if
you
need
a
history
lesson
the
spirit
of
st

was
charles

plane
when
he
made
the
first
transatlantic
solo
flight

at
least
the
cockpit
window
could
stand
to
be
moved
forward
one
stud
but
everything
seems
to
be
relatively
close
the
tail
piece
isnt
the
right
shape
but
it
is
likely
the
only
tail
piece
lego
produced
at
the
time
if
you
look
closely
you
can
see
the
various
bite
marks
that
my
brother
and
i
inflicted
over
the
years
i
know
some
people
would
be
aghast
that
there
are
bite
marks
but
brick
separators
wouldnt
come
out
for
another
10
years
besides
we
were
young
we
didnt
know
any
better
i
certainly
had
no
idea
that
it
would
become
my
obsession
there
are
some
interesting
part
choices
here
everything
is
brick
and
plate
built
as
you
might
expect
the
same
set
nowadays
would
have
lots
of
slope
wedges
and
wedge
plates
to
round
things
out
but
lego
was
all
about
the
brick
in
77
so
bricks
are
what
we
got
the
black
inverted
slopes
worked
pretty
well
asthetically
as
the
wing
struts
the
wings
are
simple
4
x
10
plates
nice
and
square
there
were
no
minifigs
in
this
set
if
i
remember
correctly
1977
was
just
about
the
time
when
minifigs
made
their
first
appearance
i
know
i
have
one
other
set
from
77
that
does
include
a
minifg
at
least
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
comments
for
the
following
photos
ill
let
the
pictures
speak
for
themselves

interesting
pieces
i
have
no
idea
if
there
were
any
extra
pieces
that
came
with
this
set
i
kind
of
doubt
it
instead
i
took
a
photo
of
some
of
the
interesting
parts
to
the
model
that
translucent
white
piece
didnt
photograph
so
well
but
it
is
a
technic
axle
8
thats
right
sets
from
1977
contained
technic
elements
the
two
black
parts
are
the
forerunners
to
the
1
x
2
technic
brick
as
well
everytime
i
hear
someone
on
the
forums
complain
about
technic
elements
in
system
sets
i
think
back
to
this
set
the
round
brick
is
special
as
well
here
is
a
closer
view
of
it
complete
with
bite
marks
round
brick
as
you
can
see
the
stud
is
closed
it
is
only
one
of
two
closed
stud
1
x
1
round
bricks
that
i
own
they
stopped
appearing
in
sets
in
1981
for
those
that
are
interested
the
dss
you
thought
you
were
going
to
escape
this
heading
didnt
you
surprise
yes
even
in
1977
lego
sets
had
stickers
the
oldest
printed
elements
i
can
remember
were
in
the
classic
space
sets
that
started
in
1979
again
when
people
in
the
forums
complain
about
dss
in
sets
i
can
only
help
think
of
this
set
and
chuckle
to
myself
maniacally
the
sticker
has
held
up
really
well
considering
its
been
stuck
on
the
brick
for
32
years
no
discoloration
very
little
curling
i
think
if
all
stickers
held
up
this
well
over
time
there
would
be
less
dss
complaints
the
ratings
playability
610
the
set
is
quite
swooshable
and
the
propellor
spins
outside
of
that
though
minifigs
na
design
610
the
overall
shape
is
quite
good
especially
given
the
era
the
color
choice
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
price
110
its
been
retired
for
30
years
its
going
to
cost
you
to
get
your
hands
on
it
overall
1330
this
set
is
for
true
collectors
only
i
cant
imagine
anyone
wanting
one
because
they
want
to
play
with
it
it
was
a
great
set
back
in
the
day
but
the
design
feels
really
dated
and
if
youre
wondering
mine
is
not
for
sale
ever
all
the
photos
plus
more
can
be
found
in
the
gallery
im
sorry
you
had
to
move
this
topic
white
fang
when
it
was
in
the
reviewers
academy
the
teachers
agreed
it
belonged
in
other
themes
shrug
i
guess
it
ended
up
where
it
belonged
eventually
great
review
its
good
to
see
some
of
the
old
sets
reviewed
i
think
i
learned
something
about
the
history
of
lego
from
this
one
here
is
the
spirit
of
st
louis
just
go
there
washington
and
have
a
look
of
this
legend

trans
or
yellow
slopes
existed
already
and
using
them
would
have
made
the
plane
more
realistic
i
dont
think
so
there
is
no
45Â
°
slope
in
the
original
plane
design
and
no
front
cockpit
window
quote
a
third
rear
wheel
would
have
enhanced
playability
and
design
rather
than
this
ugly
black
round
brick
except
that
it
wouldnt
have
been
the
spirit
of
st
louis
this
set
is
a
great
one
and
i
wish
id
bought
it
in
77
it
is
the
spirit
of
the
70ties
i
always
thought
that
that
grey
thing
on
top
of
the
rocket
was
some
kind
of
satelite

am
said
huh
did
they
not
think
of
putting
a
technic
axle
down
the
center
of
the
rocket
come
to
think
of
it
when
were
technic
axles
invented
i
had
this
set
as
a
kid
and
i
dont
think
there
was
a
technic
axle
inside
that
rocket
but
if
i
remember
correctly
some
of
the
later
cs
rockets
did
im
loving
that
transyellow
plate
on
top
of
the
roof
great
review
wooow
what
a
set
not
all
that
large
most
defenitely
not
as
sophisticated
as
the
message
intercept
base
from
10
years
later
but
in
those
this
was
all
a
kid
need
to
have
hours
of
fun
soooo
many
great
parts
on
this
one
technic
hoses
computers
rocket
parts
trans
yellow
parts
the
perfect
outpst
really
it
was
actually
my
sister
who
got
this
one

it

took
an

for
the
great
review
sweet
now
that
ive
seen
the
set
im
afraid
im
a
bit
disappointed
8
1
the
color
combination
doesnt
really
do
it
for
me
blue
dark
blue
grey
black
tan
white
theyre
all
mixed
together
without
any
over
all
design
2
is
there
any
interior
it
doesnt
look
like
it
and
in
any
case
you
can
only
reach
it
if
you
remove
the
modules
hm
now
it
looks
too
much
of
a
box
3
there
are
most
certainly
some
nice
ideas
in
this
model
and
some
great
parts
the
best
part
of
the
model
is
the
staircase
4
i
dont
think
he
spent
much
time
in
thinking
about
the
design
as
apo
said
the
chimneys
on
top
of
a
garage
is
kinda
weird
theres
also
a
gate
next
to
another
gate
which
is
weird
as
well
also
if
this
is
supposed
to
ba
a
grocery
then
the
owner
has
done
a
lot
to
hide
it
the
croissant
is
nice
but
next
to
the
brown
box
with
vegies
theres
nothing
that
suggests
this
is
a
shop
5
the
white
lamp
and
the
the
yellow
cylinder
are
at
the
same
level
of
the
tiles
imo
it
should
be
above
the
level
of
the
tiles
6
imo
not
worth
the
90
euro

hi
thanks
for
posting
those
great
pictures
i
got
the
cc
some
time
ago
and
i
really
looking
forward
to
get
my
hands
on
the
market
street
i
think
the
colour
scheme
of
this
set
is
great
maybe
because
blue
is
my
favourite
colour
just
check
my
wardrobe
i
really
like
the
design
of
the
roof
and
the
staircase
i
am
not
so
sure
if
i
like
the
gateways
but
i
believe
they
will
grow
on
me
when
i
get
the
set
myself

the

i
have

on

looks
much
better
if
you
ask
me
unfortunately
shop
at

does
not

to

this

i

with
a

and
some

side
feeling
indeed
sweet
im
not
much
of

fan
but
this
looks
great
i
guess
this
is
the
closest
we
can
get
to
legoland
miniland
quality
sets
and
considering
this
is
a
three
floro
small
structure
and
its
over
1000
parts
just
imagine
pun
not

how
many
peices
are
in

californias
empire
state
building
or
wtc
freedom
tower
models
both
are
large
and
in

over

thats
a

of
bricks
anyways
ive
got
a

who
loves

im
sure
this

would
make
a
great
addition
to

nonsense
sandra
tks
for
sharing
these
cool
pics
its
also
a
nice
hommage
to
erik
brok
i
really
like
this
set
i
think
its
really
well
designed
with
great
ideas
such
as
the
dual
stairs
the
balconies
the
croissant
insignia
the
market
entrance
design
with
the
horns
whip
and
owl
8
i
like
the
color
combination
and
the
mosaic
design
just
in
front
of
the
entrance
the
only
terrible
flaw
is
that
yellow
cinlinder
that
is
just
awful
for
a
flower
pot
x
i
dont
mind
at
all
having
that
lamp
post
at
the
same
level
since
it
would
be
normal
to
have
the
base
of
the
lamp
at
the
level
of
the
tile
but
i
agree
that
is
just
pickering
about
an
insignificant
detail

a

the

yeay
that

just
brilliant
all

this

heres
the
text
from
the

of
the

quote
for
much
of
the
galactic
civil
war
a
mysterious
agent
of
palpatine
codenamed
blackhole
carefully
sifted
through
countless
streams
of
data
distilling
it
into
useful
information
for
imperial
intelligence
blackhole
had
an
impressive
amount
of
resourses
available
to
him
including
a
entire
star
destroyer
and
its
complement
of
troops
and
fighters
per
his
orders
the
stormtroopers
under
his
command
had
their
armor
cast
in
black
to
match
his
own
particular
eccentricities
the
armor
modification
had
practical

as

well
it
has
taken
me
over
2
years
but
i
have
finally
bought
this
maquette
its
a
real
beauty
just
dont
ask
what
it
cost
my
set
of
maquettes
is
finally
complete
you
did
it
i
´
m
so
glad
i
hope
it
didn
´
t
cost
you
1230
which
is
the
cheapest
right
now
for
all
five
on
bl
but
still
cheap
compared
to
this
one
well
here
are
mine
i
´
ll
hang
on
the
my
extra
blackhole
stormie
a
while
more
if
morten
doesn
´
t
come
here
and
break
it
that
is
well
now
that
i
have
some
money
a
trip
to
toysrus
was
obviously
in
my
future
especially
since
my
local
tru
has
much
of
the
summer
2007
lineup
when
i
got
there
almost
all
the
smaller
castle
sets
had
been
sold
out
but
there
was
one
left
the
one
i
am
now
reviewing
for
both
eurobricks
and
bzpower
the
box
well
for
starters
the
castle
theme
boxes
are
beautiful
the
blended
clear
and
stormy
skies
give
a
great
clash
of
the
titans
effect
and
the
action
poses
help
as
well
the
back
is
equally
nice
featuring
a
photo
showing
kids
how
to
use
the
crossbow
and
the
brave
axe
wielder
taking
a
swipe
at
the
skeleton
foolish
soldier
that
wont
work
on
skellies
see
later
on
in
the
review
to
find
out
why
and
of
course
we
have
a
small
box
with
the
link
to
the
official
lego
website
where
tlc
can
advertise
even
more
lego
sets
p
the
contents
after
opening
the
box
a
single
bag
of
pieces
with
a
couple
loose
ones
the
instruction
manual
and
necessary
catalog
p
and
a
new
wider
rubber
band
holder
spilt
out
the
instruction
manual
is
clear
as
a
bell
no
color
trouble
here
folks
also
its
worth
mentioning
the
nice
background
with
the
mountain
and
kings
castle
silhouettes
sorry
that
theres
no
picture
but
ill
take
one
if
someone
wants
to
see
it
the
pieces
for
being
a
5
dollar
set
well
seven
in
my
case
darn
your
above
average
prices
tru
crossbow
attack
features
a
lot
of
nice
pieces
as
does
the
entire
castle
lineup
notable
elements
include
two
large
brown
spoked
wheels
two
brown
modified
1x1s
a
pearl
gold
slope
end
and
six
dark
blue
modified
1x1x23
slopes
the
bulk
of
the
pieces
however
are
nothing
special
ill
let
the
picture
do
the
talking
for
this
the
accessories
are
by
far
the
best
parts
in
this
kit
two
different
helmets
in
a
beautiful
shiny
silver
are
my
favorite
but
i
also
really
like
the
scythe
looks
good
for
mocing
and
the
round
shield
wub
which
are
both
brand
new
parts
and
can
anyone
not
love
the
classic
axe
and
crossbows
oh
and
theres
a
black
lightsaber
too
but
thats
rather
boring
compared
to
the
other
parts
p
the
minifigures
can
you
say
four
figures
including
the
horse
that
has
to
be
a
record
for
a
regular
5
dollar
set
at
least
in
the
present
age
of
limited
figures
per
set
well
start
out
with
the
two
crown
militia
a
regular
soldier
and
an
archer
both
have
old
faces
but
they
look
spiffy
with
the
shiny
helmets
and
the
superb
torsos
ill
name
the
soldier
bravo
the
stout
and
the
archer
angler
the
precise
for
future
references
now
we
come
to
the
skellie
although
some
people
dislike
the
new
skeleton
design
i
personally
prefer
it
to
the
old
ones
since
the
arms
are
now
poseable
and
the
face
much
meaner
the
only
problem
is
that
the
arms
hang
too
low
but
its
not
too
noticeable
when
they
have
weapons
in
their
hands
and
last
but
not
least
heres
the
elusive
skeleton
horse
i
for
one
am
very
happy
that
tlc
took
advantage
of
that
awesome
prototype
piece
and
made
it
into
an
official
massproduction
mold
however
the
horse
is
unfortunately
one
piece
but
since
regular
lego
horses
are
as
well
i
dont
have
a
problem
with
it
i
do
have
a
problem
with
the
pose
however
the
legs
are
in
quite
an
odd
position
and
i
wonder
why
tlc
didnt
make
the
front
and
back
leg
poses
symmetrical
ah
well
the
finished
set
i
have
only
two
pictures
here
since
this
set
is
so
small
first
heres
the
completed
crossbow
i
must
say
finally
no
more
ridiculous
horse
mounted
catapults
or
crazy
fire
wheel
launchers
now
we
have
realistic
siege
weapons
including
the
one
included
with
7090
plus
it
actually
launches
okay
although
not
the
best
heres
the
other
main
attraction
the
completed
skeleton
rider
and
horse
i
think
its
rather
dramatic
with
that
pose
and
the
dark
background
dont
you
think
playability
okay
so
theres
not
much
in
this
set
but
a
bit
of
imagination
brings
plenty
of
possibilities
to
show
you
what
you
can
do
heres

i
recommend
it
to
any
lego
fan
whether
they
are
a
castle
nut
or
just
want
a
cheap
change
of
pace
tlc
has
a
knack
with
making
great
small
kits
these
days
and
i
more
than
ever
support
them
in
their
amazing
rebound
from
their
dark
ages
between
1997
and
2004

thanks
for
this
review
and
that
great
little
comic
about
the
skellies
though
xd
you
have
to
admit
that
besides
their
long
arms
making
the
skellie
legs
look
out
of
proportion
that
theyre
just
made
poorly
theyre
sticking
straight
out
as
opposed
to
every
other
fig
which
have
a
slight
bend
to
make
them
look
more
natural
also
as
im
sure
youve
noticed
the
pegs
are
on
angles
that
makes
it
impossible
for
them
to
hold
their
weapons
straight
and
they
cant
even
put
their
arms
over
their
heads
without
stressing
the
plastic
some
i
mean
theyre
dead
well
at
least
undead
theyre
not
supposed
to
be
stiff
and
personally
i
like
the
ragdoll
look
more
it
makes
them
seem
more
dead
p
a
very
nice
review
with
good
pictures
thanks

awesome
theres
no

anywhere
in

argos
have
exclusive
rigts
for
selling
them
at

but
you
can
also
get
them
from
the

at

i
have

any
either
that
was
a

very

tks
a

for
your
review
ickelpete
i
saw
that
set
at
tru
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
but
was
really
not
interested
due
to
the
design
i
am
not
a
fan
of
those
motorized
lego
sets
i
guess
the
lime
colour
is
to
please
kids
as
well
as
the
general
design
far
from
a
real
dino
i
am
sure
that
its
going
to
sell
well
to
a
younger
croud
let
me
quote
you
here
quote
the
walking
motion
works
well
although
there
is
no
steering
and
it
will
fall
over
it
it
encounters
obstacles
hum
i
really
hope
it
works
welll
because
i
will
have
to
buy
that
motorized
atat
and
i
dont
want
it
to
crash

big
my

nice
review
y
as
for
the
set
i
dont
like
the
colors
myself
surprised
xd
and
it
seems
a
little
blocky
otherwise
the
set
is
cool
i
really
like
the

thanks
for
the
nice
review
its
butt
ugly
to
me
but
the
motors
ir
control
seem
pretty
neat
even
at
that
high
price
it
looks
like
a
good
parts
pack
sweet
i
didnt
spot
this
great
review
earlier
thanks
for
the
effort
of
posting
all
those
pics
and
videos
they
helped
me
decide
that
this
set
is
worth
getting
i
like
the
dropship
kit
and
got
this
now
that
i
built
it
i
see
so
many
things
i
can
do
to
tweak
it
to
make
it
a
moc
i
think
this
is
a
set
everyone
mm
fan
should
get
a
very
nice
review
thanks

y
i
really
dont
understand
that
color
scheme
but
the
new
motorsre
very
interesting
well
that
dino
is
just
mediocre
to
me
i
think
that
the
new
technic
bulldozer
is
much
more
interesting
i
already
made
my
5
cents
to
this
horrible
colour
bastard

quote
in
case
you
dont
know
the
atat
in
the
dark
side
development
kit
had
a
single
motor
and
a
moving
head
it
worked
by
the
head
simply
swinging
from
side
to
side
due
to
balence
shifts
i
suspect
the
atat
will
be
same
i
also
think
that
there
will
be
no
remote
for
it
either
thanks
that
makes
sense
and
you
are
probably
right
i
do
have
the
dark
side
development
kit
but
i
have
not
built
that

we
will
get

i
kind
of
like
the
design
of
this
but
more
importantly
i
really
want
to
get
my
hands
on
the
power
functions
motors
and
ir
control
system
id
prefer
the
8275
technic
bulldozer
but
theres
no
way
i
can
stretch
to
the
100
price
tag
so
i
was
thinking
i
would
have
to
see
if
i
could
get
a
4958
monster
dino
cheap
in
the
january
sales
if
you
really
want
the
power
functions
the
bulldozer
is
better
value
as
you
get
two
large
motors
two
small
motors
and
two
receivers
compared
to
the
one
in
the
dino
set
alos
watch
toysrus
and
argos
both
have
had
the
bulldozer
for
7075
in
there
pre
christmas
sales
usually
for
a
week
only
i
am
hopeing
they
will
be
on
sale
soon
as
i
want
a
second
bulldozer
to
get
some
more
motors
pretty
good
first
review
this
looks
pretty
great
i
probably
wont
be
getting
it
due
to
budget
constraints
bionicle
but
still
very
nice
set
to
me
it
kinda
looks
like
the
missing
link
between
when
the
atst
evolved
into
the
atat
also
i
know
the
rebels
stormtroopers
get
a
lot
of
hate
but
i
really
like
them
thanks
for
the
review
i
built
this
set
and
i
think
the
two
rubber
pieces
holding
the
both
sides
of
the
face
is
a
bit
stretched
out
therefore
making
the
set
somewhat
tight
for
entire
top
hatch
to
open
and
close
does
anyone
have
the
same
situation
is
this
right
never
mind
i
got
it
i
built
the
back
a
stud
too
long

seems
like
they
infuse

sets
with
more

bars
must
be
that
technic
isnt
selling
too
well
and
they
want
to
educate
ppl
how
cool
technic
can
be
p
its
quite
apparent
when
even
the
small
bike
needed
technic
frame
my
guess
its
less
expensive
and
complicated
to
produce
theyre
also
using
these
parts
in
other
themes
so
in
the
end
theyre
producing
a
smaller
catalog
of
bricks
but
every
part
gets
produced
in
larger
quantities

build

i
have

though
do
the

try
and
stick
one
in
therebecuase
the
new

shows
an

lastly

should
have
made
the
aliens
with
movable
arms
and
no
hole
in

i
dont

to
waste
any
money
so
i
am
only
going
to
grab
1
or
2
of
the
smaller
sets
piranha
editimo
the
aliens
would
win
becuase
they

i
was
looking

then
at

and
i
just
realised
havent
you
put
the
stikers
on
the

thingies
in
the
middle
upside
down
i
think
you
did
d
i
dont
know
if
i
like
those
new
sets
though
i
mean
they
have
great
shapes
and
potential
but
at
the
same
time
they
seem
so
holey
theyre
really
huge
and
big
but
full
of
empty
air
and
space
as
well
well
this
one
not
as
much
and
indeed
it
is
the
best
looking
set
of
the
lot
though
but
i
dont
think
ill
go
into
that
line

ok
then
ill
do
that
later
on
but
i
will
not
touch
that
plastic
residu
xd
you
touched
them
to
put
them
in
their
holders
in
the
ship
so
in
theory
you
will
not
review
them
anyways
nice
review
i
dont

ill
get
this
though
im
trying
to
decide
between
this
moble
devastator
or
anothe
90
set
i
need
to
get
something
large
before
my
bday
regards
vbbn
i
think
the
life
on
mars
series
was
great
although
i
didnt
click
until
the
line
was
gone
that
the
red
hangar
on
the
alien
base
was
for
the
red
mech
and
same
with
the
blue
one
man
i
was
gutted
when
i
realised
that
i
want
those
mechs
however
the
base
was
great
with
the
small
mech
and
the
flying
crafts
could
the

mechs
have
been

am
i
managed
to
get
two
sets
for
my
twin
girls
for
christmas
and
would
have
to
agree
with
your
ratings
the
anna
and
elsa
figs
are
indeed
excellent
thanks
for
the
review
mostlytechnic
i
too
wish
they
had
done
a
real
castle
for
this
set
it
certainly
deserved
it
my
sons
and
i
figure
they
could
have
used
the
old
rock
monster
mold
from
rock
raiders
in
white
for
the
missing
snow
beast
i
will
pick
it
up
though
for
the
figs
and
unique
pieces
thanks
for
the
review
i
have
the
same
opinion
about
the
design
looks
like
belville
i
bought
it
on
legostore
orlando
december
30th
it
was
impressive
my
wife
saw
them
putting
on
shelf
8
or
10
boxes
she
ran
and
grabbed
the
last
one
the
girls
faces
around
it
was
indescribable
mix
of
ecstasy
and
afraid
to
loose
it
it
happened
in
less
than
2
minutes
my
7
yo
girl
didnt
want
it
she
likes
the
dresses
but
hates
the
movie
prefers
lego
movie
but
my
2
yo
girl
who
never
saw
the
movie
grabbed
it
for
good
and
we
bought
it
lego
will
sell
it
like
water
but
i
do
not
understand
why
a
set
so
small
it
is
the
worst
set
design
since
the
introduction
of
lego
friends
my
7
yo
has
more
than
50
lego
friends
minifigures
all
the
lego
fiends
stores
and
concluded
that
the
castle
had
a
terrible
design
she
is
7
lets
be
honest
lego
should
have
released
this
sets
months
before
this
christmas
and
is
loosing
a
perfect
opportunity
to
sell
a
decent
set
with
much
more
pieces
i
am
wondering
if
they
are
going
to
make
another
set
with
the
same
characters
at
the
end
it
is
just
for
the
minifigures
i
think
the
transglitter
blue
panels
can
be
icy
or
snowy
just
fine
im
sure
thats
why
they
used
them
for
this
set
now
if
youre
looking
for
realism
like
the
photos
in
your
sig
seem
to
be
it
might
be
tougher
but
ive
been
thinking
about
using
those
big
glittery
panels
to
make
a
waterfalltype
scene
that
was
a
great
review
with
loads
of
excellent
pictures
the
set
is
better
than
i
thought
i
want
to
buy
one
of
the
new
sets
as
i
would
love
a
blue
batman
but
they
are
so
expensive
for
australians
i
love
the
new
pumpkin
heads
the
story
involved
more
minifig
cruelty
excellent
i
also
liked
the
scarecrowcrow
joke
d
one
request
please
dont
say
lines
like
to
the

next
time
that
is
the

im
retooling
it
right
now
because
i
was
identifying
a
lot
of
cliches
so
i
threw
a
lot
of
plots
out
the

and
revisited
my
whole

anyway
there
will
always
be
quick
wacky

comes

bought

for

tend

put
in
on

over
and
i

i
like

side
of

only
and
thus
anything
that
is
against

that

tomorrow
when

of

biplane
i
wasnt

if
i
liked
it
or
not

after
seeing
it
in
more
detail
i
got
ta
say
i
love
the
thing
wub
its
a
great
plane
with
so
many
good
aspects
its
also
the
perfect
counter
vehicle
for
the
new
batplane
for
me
though
the
best
part
of
the
set
has
got
to
be
the
new
pumpkin
heads
those
are
just
beautiful
and
i
cant
wait
to
get
lots
of
them
great
review
funny
as
allways
the
comic
was
just
a
hell
lot
of
fun
it
really
had
me
laughing
i
would
love
to
have
this
set
but
the
price
is
just
to
high
here
far
worse
than
i
had
expected
ill
be
better
off
buying
the
battank
which
is
much
better
priced
actually
there
is
almost
no
price
difference
between
the
batcopter
and
the
battank

wacko
450
and

indeed
you
should
just
buy
the
tank
comparing
the
price
of
the
tank
to
the
batwing
you
seem
to
be
getting
quite
a
good
deal
there
both
are
over
priced
for
australians
and
the
tank
is
twice
the
price
of
the
copter
they
are
60
aud
and
120
aud
i
am
still
not
sure
if
i
will
buy
either

youre
second
post
on
this
forum
and
already
you
bring
us
this
great
review
thanks
for
making
this
7665
review
part
2
the
second
half
of
the
build
goes
quicker
than
the
first
once
you
start
to
add
the
engines
the
ship
really
begins
to
take
shape
the
main
body
of
the
ship
has
a
few
surprises
hidden
away
under
a
removable
cover
inside
you
get
some
retracting
guns
a
storage
box
a
little
shuttle
and
space
for
a
droid
and
figure
here
is
everything
you
can
fit
inside
the
guns
are
concealed
behind
the
side
vents
pushing
them
forward
causes
the
vents
to
open
closed
and
open
the
final
feature
is
the
passenger
areaescape
pod
inside
is
plenty
of
space
for
two
figures
the
pod
cleverly
attaches
by
pushing
the
front
section
of
the
ship
forward
sliding
the
pod
in
then
returning
the
front
everything
locks
together
and
is
held
securely
in
place
by
an
elastic
band
heres
a
couple
of
pictures
of
the
final
model
its
not
the
most
beautiful
creation
ever
but
it
is
an
excellent
representation
of
the
ship
from
the
film
the
angular
shape
actually
suits
a
lego
build
well
theres
one
more
useful
feature
the
whole
ship
can
be
safely
and
comfortably
picked
up
by
two
ball
ended
technic
pins
towards
the
back
end
it
balances
well
at
this
point
and
does
allow
you
to
swoosh
the
ship
around
much
more
easily
this
was
the
most
enjoyable
star
wars
build
ive
had
in
a
long
time
everything
progresses
nicely
with
almost
no
repetitive
bits
the
ship
looks
good
and
is
also
huge
sweet
compare
it
to
the
6211
isd
and
youll
see
its
only
fractionally
smaller
when
i
first
saw
pictures
of
this
on
the
internet
i
thought
it
looked
ok
once
you
see
it
for
real
it
is
much
more
impressive
for
6999
in
the
uk
im
not
complaining
its
the
best
value
star
wars
set
of
the
year
so
far
to
conclude
pieces
910
minifigures
710
would
be
a
9
apart
from
the
stupid
quigonobiwan
head
error
playability
810
originality
910
set
design
810
overall
8210
the
box
says
this
is
a
limited
edition
set
whatever
that
means
so
if
youre
planning
to
get
it
id
suggest
you
grab
it
at
the
first
opportunity
im
glad
i
did
xd

excellent
review
this
looks
like
a
very
nice
piece
of
legoenginereing
y
like
you
i
think
it
looks
like
the
original
i
did
think
though
that
it
was
supposed
to
be
a
unarmed
ship
but
i
can
defenitly
live
with
that
xd
the
escape
shuttle
looks
roamy
enough
a
bit
dull
though
but
it
could
have
a
ps
iii
stached
away
somewhere
but
the
other
shuttle
come
on
is
it
for
minime
when
he
needs
to
go

at

as
for
the
set
the
thing
that
jumps
out
at
me
most
is
the
use
of
dark
blue
for
water
im
so
used
to
seeing
the
classic
blue
for
water
that
the
dark
blue
seems
weird
i
dont
like
it
bm
indeed
i
only
noticed
this
when
i
saw
the
sh
images
i
guees
that
theyre
on
dark
waters
you
can
always
put
some
trans
blue
and
trans
clear
1x1
round
plates
no
i
tried
that
technique
to
make
the
lava
using
trans
red
and
trans
orange
plates
it
looks
neat
regarding
the
human
soldier
thing
yoda
mentioned
its
quite
weird
like
him
im
going
to
swap
the
legs
so
theyre
coherent
with
the
soldiers
from
the
other
sets
third
note
is
it
just
me
or
did
you
attach
the
two
black
gate
pieces
too
high

with

high
on

of
a
dark

so
if
you
want
the

to
operate
well
you
have
to
place
it
like
that
i
just
put
the
clip
under
that
brick
a
very
easy
fix
so
my

now

exactly
asuka
is

also
keep
in
mind
that
the
picture
was
taken
looking
down
on
the
model
that
is
sitting
on
the
carpet
it
makes
the
gap
appear
a
little
larger
in
addition
for
those
of
you
that
recommended
ironing
the
sail
it
worked
great
i
set
the
iron
to
low
and
used
a
tshirt
to
protect
the
sail
it
flattened
it
out
perfectly
in
fact
it
worked
so
well
that
i
did
the
same
with
my
old
ww
weapons
wagon
cover
that
has
gotten
wrinkled
over
the
years
the
iron
worked
perfectly
yes
very
nice
review
mr
brickster
i
think
i
for
a
change
like
the
castle
part
better
the
ship
doesnt
look
quite
right
to
me
if
theyre
gon
na
make
a
pirate
theme
with
ships
like
this
i
wouldnt
be
very
happy
but
i
think
the
ship
brings
some
nice
accesories
like
the
anchor
a
black
mid
piece
steering
wheel
etc
i
think
ill
buy
it

had
to
restrain
myself
this
morning
they
had
all
the
new
star
wars
summer
sets
and
republic
cruiser
too
there
was
a
girl
unpacking

saying

and
this
one
d
showing

the

mtt
jedi
with
hyperdrive
ring
naboo
star

and
the

i
had
to

i
think
yep
very
reasonable
y
excellent
set
the
snowtroopers
are
just
amazing
most
lego
imperial
troops
are
really
good
however
its
sad
that
except
from
luke
all
the
rebels
have
the
same
face
which
is
what
is
more
the
most
unexpressive
that
you
can
find
for
the
rest
the
quality
looks
excellent
the
snowspeeder
is
far
better
than
the
first
they
realized
but
only
one
thing
it
looks
a
bit
too
white
to
me
i
think
i
remember
they
were
grey
and
orange
rather
than
white
in
the
film
and
the
echo
base
door
is
really
cool
really
nice
set

man
the
stickers
on
everything
are
really
starting
to
irritate
me
a
lot
im
not
sure
i
like
the
white
3p0
in
a
set
that
is
primarily
made
up
of
whites
doesnt
stand
out
enough
the
snowspeeder
looks
a
lot
shorter
than
previous
versions

42039
24
hours
race
car
introduction
when
the
preliminary
images
of
the
le
mans
racer
surfaced
somewhere
last
year
2014
it
got
a
lot
of
praise
this
changed
dramatically
when
the
final
images
of
the
24
hours
race
car
showed
up
the
front
side
of
the
car
especially
the
head
lights
and
the
curvature
of
the
side
of
car
had
changed
a
lot
the
car
obviously
still
resembled
the
prototype
but
the
new
design
raised
a
lot
of
eyebrows
the
new
design
was
considered
a
step
back
instead
of
forward
eventhough
i
still
liked
the
design
i
must
admit
i
liked
the
earlier
design
better
too
with
the
emphasis
on
past
tense
liked
i
am
not
sure
anymore
and
this
review
will
show
you
why
like
the
arctic
truck
this
set
has
a
bmodel
which
is
well
worth
checking
out
thats
why
this
review
includes
both
the
amodel
and
bmodel
for
people
who
are
on
the
fence
the
bmodel
might
actually
convince
them
to
buy
the
set
after
all
lets
see
what
this
set
is
all
about

gr
to
be

the
width
of
the
box
is
the
same
as
the
box
of
the
arctic

this
box
also
feels
like
its
filled
to
the
brim
the
front
the
front
shows
a
picture
of
the
main
model
in
action
with
radial
blurred
wheels
to
emphasize
the
motion
of
the
car
the
lower

shows
the
dimensions
of
the
model
upon
completion
it
will
measure
a
length
of
40cm
and
a
width
of
18

the
back
like
the
front
the
back
side
has
exactly
the
same
setup
as
the
box
of
the
arctic

the
top
shows
the
functions
of
the
model
while
the
lower
left
side
shows
the
bmodel
and
the
lower
right
side
shows
the

options
the
picture
of
the
bmodel
looks
so
cool
it
could
be
a
model
of
its
own
at
this
point
i
was
very
eager
to
build
both
models
and
compare
them
the
side
one
of
the
sides
usually
shows
a
part
in
11
scale
this
time
its

the
size
of
the
model
content
of
the
box
the
box
contains
1
booklet
1
sticker
sheet
13
bags
4
tires
instruction
booklet
since
i
own
two
copies
of
the
set
i
also
received
two
instruction
booklets
whats
catching
my
eye
is
that
my
second
copy
is
supplied
in
different
packaging
than
the
first
one
its
for
the
first
time
that
i
am
aware
of
that
the
instruction
booklet
and
stickers
come
in
a
sealed
bag
without
cardboard
back
hopefully
this
will
be
a
new
standard
for
all
sets
with
sticker
sheets
instead
of
multiple
booklets
this
set
contains
a
single
square
bound
book
in
earlier
reviews
i
have
epxressed
my
preference
for
a
single
book
i
dont
see
any
advantage
in
having
2
3
or
even
up
to
6
booklets
sticker
sheet
like
the
actual
model
the
sticker
sheet
looks
very
vibrant
the
bright
green
white
and
black
color
combination
has
found
its
way
to
the
stickers
as
well
either
you
love
em
or
hate
em
since
i
started
writing
reviews
i
have
been
applying
stickers
and
i
am
happy
i
started
doing
it
stickers
do
give
the
model
its
finishing
touch
bags
with
parts
thirteen
bags
with
a
total
of
1219
parts
give
or
take
a
few
are
supplied
in
the
densily
packed
box
the
rims
and
flex
are
sealed
in
a
bag
as
well
sometimes
looking
at
the
bags
makes
you
wonder
what
the
logic
is
behind
the
distribution
of
the
various
parts
across
the
different
bags
well
this
time
it
really
got
me
confused
take
a
look
at
two
of
the
bags
below
theres
a
bag
containing
all
the
3l
blue
pins
then
theres
a
bag
with
various
partsand
a
single
3l
blue
pin
i
figured
this
might
be
an
error
but
both
of
the
sets
have
the
same
anomaly
tires
the
tires
have
been
supplied
unbagged
as
usual
highlighted
parts
this
chapter
describes
new
and
interesting
parts
this
set
actually
contains
a
lot
of
them
this
set
also
contains
an
abundance
of
panels
if
you
arent
into
panels
this
isnt
the
set
for
you
changeover
catch
this
year
2015
the
new
changeover
catch
parts
were
released
its
a
combination
of
three
parts
the
advantage
of
the
new
parts
is
that
the
red
gear
is
the
same
on
both
sides
which
avoids
mounting
it
the
wrong
way
around
it
also
avoids
the
changeover
catch
slipping
out
of
the
driving
ring
like
it
used
to
do
you
can
apply
lots
of
pressure
but
the
catch
doesnt
slip
out
pins
some
of
last
years
new
pins
are
also
included
in
this
set
12
x
pin
with
pin
hole
and
21
x
3l
pin
with
1l
axle
securing
technic
beams
can
be
quite
simple
with
the
new
pin
with
pin
holes
the
new
3l
pin
with
1l
axle
gives
you
more
possibilities
when
connecting
beams
and
other
parts
below
are
two
example
situations
where
the
new
pins
have
been
used
granted
the
examples
below
can
be
accomplished
by
using
other
techniques
however
some
predicaments
from
the
past
can
be
easily
solved
by
using
these
new
parts
like
me
you
will
most
likely
appreciate
the
ease
of
use
engine
and
suspension
also
included
are
two
steering
portal
hubs
and
steering
portal
hubs
with
ball
joint
arms
and
four
steering
portal
axles
for
driving
and
steering
the
vehicle
these
parts
are
commonly
used
nowadays
the
picture
below
also
shows
some
other
parts
like
gear
rack
steering
arms
and
suspension
frames
this
set
comes
with
a
single
5x7
frame
and
three
5x11
frames
panels
this
set
contains
a
whopping
47
panels
in
three
different
colors
i
personally
like
panels
a
lot
and
i
do
appreciate
the
variety
we
have
at
our
disposal
lately
this
set
even
contains
a
new
13x3x2
curved
mudguard
panel
new
13x3x2
curved
panel
this
is
the
first
set
to
contain
the
new
13x3x2
curved
panel
looking
at
the
pictures
doesnt
do
these
panels
justice
in
real
life
they
are
actually
quite
big
i
figured
they
would
be
smaller
but
they
are
even
longer
than
the
11
x
5
frame
with
a
length
of
13
including
the
attachment
points
hopefully
this
part
will
be
available
in
other
colors
as
well
preferably
white
for
adding
variety
to
your
ev3
robot
19l
white
flexaxles
the
white
19l
flex
axles
have
only
been
released
in
a
single
set
the
8461
williams
f1
racer
in
2002
current
prices
on
bricklink
are
as
high
as
15
euros
needless
to
say
we
are
very
happy
with
the
return
of
these
white
axles
now
we
can
build
jeroen
ottens
awesome
alfa
romeo
4c
spider
for
a
decent
price
as
well
i
am
really
happy
that
useful
rare
parts
are
being
used
more
often
by
tlg
designers
part
list
heres
the
complete
list
for
all
1219
parts
as
you
can
see
in
the
highlighted
parts
section
this
set
contains
a
lot
of
interesting
and
useful
parts
if
you
dont
own
sets
like
the
8070
supercar
this
might
be
the
set
to
pick
up
if
you
want
to
start
building
your
own
supercar
the
build
enough
with
all
the
set
and
part
information
lets
build
the
model
rear
suspension
the
build
starts
with
the
rear
suspension
and
drivetrain
as
you
can
see
in
the
picture
below
the
length
of
the
axle
between
the
steering
cv
joint
is
4l
where
it
usally
is
3l
this
is
an
indication
that
the
finished
model
will
be
a
bit
bigger
than
usual
8070
for
example
the
finished
suspension
is
one
of
the
cleanest
suspension
setups
i
have
seen
in
an
official
model
its
pretty
basic
but
it
works
like
a
charm
this
setup
is
defintely
worth
using
in
your
moc
heres
a
video
after
attaching
the
suspension
to
the
frame
you
rotate
the
module
and
secure
it
at
this
stage
the
rear
section
of
the
chassis
with
suspension
is
almost
finished
v8
midengine
extending
the
chassis
forward
results
in
the
picture
below
where
the
front
spoiler
is
already
visible
whats
also
visible
is
the
v8
engine
placed
right
in
front
of
the
rear
axle
resulting
in
a
midengine
setup
perfectly
suited
for
sports
and
race
cars
two
exhaust
pipes
have
been
fitted
on
either
side
of
the
engine
together
with
two
hoses
attaching
them
to
the
engine
the
instructions
are
easy
to
follow
although
you
sometimes
you
need
to
bend
the
beams
a
bit
minor
improvements
are
possible
here
and
there
but
nothing
shocking
front
suspension
the
front
suspension
is
a
bit
more
complicated
than
the
rear
suspension
which
makes
sense
considering
the
fact
it
contains
the
steering
rack
the
shock
absorbers
are
placed
in
a
different
angle
than
the
rear
ones
resulting
in
a
somewhat
stiffer
front
suspension
all
in
all
the
front
suspension
is
well
designed
and
the
steering
rack
can
be
easily
powered
with
a
servo
motor
the
picture
belows
shows
the
front
suspension
attached
to
the
chassis
if
you
follow
the
official
instructions
to
motorize
the
model
the
area
in
front
of
the
suspension
is
used
to
mount
the
battery
box
when
you
are
modding
this
model
to
make
it
full
rc
this
area
can
be
used
to
mount
the
servo
motor
gearbox
like
the
gearbox
in
the
8070
its
not
used
to
switch
gears
powering
the
drivetrain
its
used
to
switch
between
two
functions
opening
the
doors
and
the
hoodbonnet
the
gearbox
is
located
at
the
left
of
the
vehicle
near
the
cockpit
the
mechanism
to
open
the
doors
is
located
on
the
left
side
while
opening
the
hoodbonnet
is
taking
place
at
the
right
side
to
accomplish
this
some
axles
traverse
under
the
cockpit
to
the
other
side
of
the
vehicle
following
the
axles
to
other
side
of
the
vehicle
and
adding
some
gears
results
in
the
situation
below
the
video
below
shows
the
gearbox
in
action
door
opening
mechanism
the
mechanism
to
open
the
door
is
comprised
of
some
knob
wheels
links
without
stoppers
and
pins
with
towballs
take
a
look
at
the
doors
opening
and
closing
the
front
using
the
new
mudguards
and
various
other
panels
you
finish
the
front
of
the
car
the
front
is
probably
the
most
controversial
part
of
the
car
this
is
caused
by
the
preliminary
pictures
shown
before
the
release
of
this
car
in
the
early
pictures
the
front
of
the
car
had
smooth
curves
and
beautiful
lines
while
the
final
car
lost
these
smooth
lines
and
got
a
more
blocky
look
in
return
i
must
admit
that
at
a
first
glance
the
new
design
lost
some
of
its
appeal
however
this
model
grew
on
me
pretty
rapidly
the
headlight
design
can
be
found
in
more
or
less
the
same
way
on
several
real
le
mans
type
race
cars
the
rear
the
rear
of
the
car
looks
great
with
the
stickers
continuing
from
the
mudguards
to
the
panels
underneath
the
spoiler
the
two
exhausts
sticking
out
give
some
details
to
the
back
i
absolutely
disagree
with
all
the
negativity
surrounding
this
car
maybe
its
one
of
those
models
which
needs
to
grow
on
you
finished
model
here
it
is
the
finished
model
i
know
some
of
you
dont
like
the
looks
of
the
car
but
i
think
it
looks
great
the
color
scheme
is
outstanding
the
new
for
technic
bright
green
parts
combined
with
white
and
black
make
this
car
look
very
vibrant
and
colorful
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
the
green
used
in
the
42008
service
truck
but
i
do
like
this
bright
green
a
lot
it
fits
perfectly
well
with
the
mindstorms
ev3
set
the
curves
on
the
side
of
the
car
are
not
as
smooth
as
some
of
us
hoped
but
i
still
think
the
car
looks
more
than
acceptable
from
the
side
the
stickers
add
some
nice
details
to
the
car
giving
it
that
characteristic
race
car
look
the
model
looks
great
in
pictures
but
it
does
even
look
better
in
real
life
i
love
this
picture
of
the
front
of
the
car
however
i
do
wonder
if
a
dedicated
24
hour
le
mans
racer
has
the
seat
and
steering
positioned
offcenter
using
the
good
ol
google
machine
i
come
to
the
conclusion
that
they
do
have
centered
seating
and
steering
at
least
the
majority
of
them
theres
ample
space
in
the
cabin
which
makes
me
wonder
why
tlg
decided
to
place
the
seat
offcentered
the
rear
view
looks
cool
too
with
some
of
the
suspension
showing
and
the
two
exhaust
pipes
clearly
visible
the
bottom
view
is
very
useful
to
determine
the
size
of
the
car
in
studs
it
measures
approx
59
x
27
studs
the
chassis
looks
organized
and
well
designed
the
engine
has
been
placed
close
to
the
ground
which
is
perfect
for
the
weight
distribution
a
low
center
of
gravity
improves
the
handling
of
the
car
i
really
enjoyed
building
this
baby
the
build
is
very
clean
and
organized
although
there
are
some
steps
where
you
need
to
bend
the
beams
a
bit
to
get
things
into
place
seeing
the
model
come
to
life
and
seeing
it
grow
to
pretty
impressive
proportions
is
very
satisfying
for
me
it
was
fun
but
i
reckon
kids
will
go
nuts
over
this
set
and
the
build
size
comparison
what
became
obvious
during
the
build
but
whats
emphasized
when
you
have
finished
the
model
is
that
its
quite
big
the
size
of
the
car
is
pretty
impressive
the
pictures
below
show
the
car
next
to
the
42030
volvo
l350f
the
side
view
emphasizes
the
size
of
the
car
its
even
longer
than
the
volvo
if
you
dismiss
the
bucket
parts
left
some
parts
left
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
features
and
functions
unlike
the
bmodel
this
model
doesnt
implement
any
unexpected
features
the
functions
it
does
implement
are
exactly
what
you
would
expect
from
any
car
steering
hog
working
fake
engine
suspension
opening
doors
gullwing
style
opening
bonnethood
opening
trunk
gearbox
for
switching
between
functions
unfortunately
the
steering
wheel
hasnt
been
linked
to
the
hog
hand
of
god
steering
mechanism
placing
the
seat
in
the
center
would
have
provided
an
easy
way
to
link
the
steering
wheel
to
the
steering
mechanism
its
a
shame
we
hardly
see
actual
steering
anymore
opening
the
hood
actually
opens
up
the
entire
rear
section
of
the
car
providing
you
with
easy
access
to
the
motor
compartment
the
mechanism
to
open
the
hood
works
properly
which
results
in
smooth
opening
and
closing
of
it
the
same
goes
for
the
gullwing
style
doors
both
functions
are
operated
manually
and
you
need
to
switch
with
the
lever
to
the
left
of
the
cockpit
these
two
functions
are
also
the
ones
which
can
be
motorized
by
placing
an
mmotor
near
the
cockpit
and
a
battery
box
in
the
trunk
all
things
considered
i
think
this
car
offers
lots
of
playability
the
model
is
solidly
built
and
the
functions
are
easy
to
operate
id
say
its
pretty
safe
to
let
your
kids
play
with
it
bmodel
unlike
the
amodel
the
bmodel
for
this
set
received
almost
universal
acclaim
and
i
can
see
why
often
the
bmodel
is
a
pale
shadow
of
its
part
donor
in
this
case
the
model
looks
so
good
it
could
be
a
model
of
its
own
it
even
incorporates
a
neat
feature
which
actually
deserves
to
be
in
the
amodel
theres
a
lot
a
variation
in
the
quality
of
digital
building
instructions
tlg
is
providing
but
these
ones
are
of
very
high
quality
the
picture
below
shows
most
of
the
chassis
with
suspension
fake
engine
and
gearbox
in
place
finished
model
some
concessions
have
been
made
but
overall
the
car
looks
fantastic
the
black
of
the
roof
has
been
extrapolated
from
the
hood
which
definitely
works
for
me
the
rear
section
of
the
car
feels
a
bit
empty
but
the
panels
do
cover
up
most
of
it
so
its
hardly
noticeable
the
v8
stickers
will
be
upside
down
if
you
use
the
parts
from
the
amodel
since
i
could
apply
new
stickers
i
have
placed
them
using
the
proper
orientation
the
bottom
of
the
car
shows
the
chassis
its
obviously
a
bit
smaller
than
the
amodels
chassis
features
and
functions
taking
the
functions
into
account
this
model
isnt
playing
second
fiddle
to
the
amodel
besides
the
obvious
functions
like
steering
opening
doors
and
hood
this
car
features
folding
fog
lights
which
deserve
a
better
podium
than
a
bmodel
steering
hog
working
fake
engine
suspension
opening
doors
manually
opening
hoodbonnet
manually
opening
trunk
operated
by
gear
folding
fog
lights
operated
by
gear
gearbox
used
to
switch
functions
fog
lights
one
of
the
most
interesting
features
of
the
bmodel
are
the
folding
fog
lights
it
almost
feels
a
bit
weird
that
a
feature
like
this
is
implemented
in
the
bmodel
instead
of
the
amodel
below
are
4
steps
showing
how
the
mechanism
works
i
have
also
included
a
video
the
mechanism
is
somewhat
reminiscent
of
fork
mechanism
used
in
the
8109
flatbed
truck
which
has
been
described
in
effermans
review
take
a
look
at
the
video
to
the
fog
lights
in
action
parts
left
a
fair
number
of
parts
left
which
isnt
uncommon
for
a
bmodel
summary
to
summarize
how
i
feel
about
this
set
you
need
to
take
a
look
at
the
picture
below
the
combined
image
reflects
the
quality
of
this
setor
better
yetsets
you
actually
get
two
great
models
for
the
price
of
one
you
dont
like
the
amodel
no
problem
you
can
have
lots
of
fun
with
the
bmodel
i
cant
stop
playing
with
the
fog
lights
its
mesmarizing
the
color
scheme
on
both
models
is
outstanding
i
simply
cant
emphasize
enough
how
well
this
color
scheme
pleases
the
eye
the
regular
green
is
dull
and
boring
but
this
bright
green
really
pops
out
especially
when
combined
with
black
and
white
and
possibly
some
red
details
black
white
and
a
little
red
sounds
familiar
yes
bright
green
can
easily
be
combined
with
your
ev3
robots
so
while
you
are
combining
the
bright
green
with
your
robot
why
not
use
the
great
new
curved
mudguard
panels
these
new
panels
are
introduced
in
this
set
and
they
look
great
they
open
up
a
lot
of
possibilities
in
the
design
department
the
build
of
the
amodel
is
outstanding
it
is
fairly
simple
but
since
its
so
clean
i
really
enjoyed
it
a
lot
i
think
the
build
should
be
entertaining
which
doesnt
mean
it
needs
to
be
a
real
challenge
and
lets
be
honest
when
is
a
build
really
challenging
the
rear
suspension
is
a
good
example
of
why
i
liked
the
build
its
very
simple
yet
very
effective
works
like
a
charm
the
same
goes
for
the
other
functions
in
both
models
and
the
star
of
the
entire
show
can
be
found
in
the
bmodel
hows
that
for
a
surprise
being
aware
of
the
fact
that
i
like
this
model
a
lot
better
than
most
of
you
seem
to
do
i
really
encourage
you
to
give
this
model
a
chance
the
sheer
size
is
impressive
the
color
scheme
is
awesome
and
you
get
a
bonus
model
which
is
actually
worth
building
score
okay
so
how
do
i
grade
this
set
8
design
open
to
debate
but
i
like
it
a
lot
8

experience

offer

you

outstanding
review
jim
congrats
love
the
pictures
so
clean
and
crisp
hope
to
see
many
more
of
your
reviews
as
for
the
set
after
seeing
this
review
i
kind
of
like
it
if
i
will
find
it
at
a
decent
price
i
will
get
it
for
sure
jim
great
review
as
always
you
convinced
me
to
get
this
one
of
these
days
although
not
a
to
priority
any
comments
on
which
functions
can
be
converted
to
pf
and
how
well
they
work
great
reviewi
am
still
undecided
whether
to
get
this
set
or
not
great
review
jim
and
stunning
pictures
i
think
this
set
will
be
my
next
purchase
i
love
the
color
scheme
and
indeed
it
looks
like
a
nice
set
also
1200
parts
for
eur
100
is
not
a
bad
deal
and
yes
the
looks
of
the
car
have
really
grown
on
my
since
the
first
official
pictures
appeared
im
curious
how
the
bright
green
will
work
combined
with
other
colors
than
white
i
really
hope
more
sets
in
the
future
will
use
the
color
so
that
more
different
parts
will
be
available
over
time
i
think
im
the
only
person
on
eurobricks
who
doesnt
like
the
looks
of
the
b
model
but
i
appreciate
the
extra
functionality
it
offers
besides
the
set
itself
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
best
reviews
i
have
read
in
a
while
great
job
on
the
superb
photographs
which
i
think
are
essential
to
a
review
and
the
extensiveness
of
it
all
you
really
touched
every
subject
which
is
great
d
i
think
i
read
somewhere
that
the
us
will
not
get
this
set
or
the
motorcycle
until
august
2015
that
means
the
flagship
most
likely
wont
be
in
august
but
even
later
in
the
year
nothing
bricklink
cant
solve
though
fantastic
review
jim
from
the
quality
of
the
review
alone
it
is
easy
to
see
how
much
hard
work
you
have
put
into
it
im
with
you
on
the
instruction
manual
i
much
prefer
one
quality
bound
book
over
umpteen
stapled
booklets
already
have
2
of
these
sitting
in
the
build
queue
one
for
display
model
as
im
a
fan
of
this
one
and
one
to
build
the
b
model
then
dissemble
for
parts
so
im
already
sold
on
his
set
but
still
very
much
enjoyed
taking
the
time
it
deserves
to
read
through
the
review
and
ogle
at
your
pro
photography
great
review
i
think
it
look
like
a
great
set
both
a
and
b
however
the
panels
are
the
only
thing
i
would
need
but
still
a
great
looking
set
a
great
review
jim
just
finished
building
this
set
a
couple
of
steps
required
abit
of
lego
stressing
to
get
together
when
there
was
an
easier
way
just
made
it
into
rc
almost
finished
it
in
ldd
which
was
easy
to
do
as
it
has
so
much
room
for
nearly
any
configuration
of
motors
and
not
have
them
showing
a
great
set

excellent
review
thanks
what
is
the
cost
in
us
not
released
in
my
area
the
shovel
is
obviously
my
favorite
area
it
looks
detailed
and
strong
i
love
the
treads
because
i
need
them
to
move
the
4
x
4
barrels
on
my
superscaled
turbolaser
turret
very
good
pics
too
what
color
are
the
treads
i
never
had
them
they
are
plastic
or
rubber
the
treads
are
dark
grey
i
not
too
good
with
naming
colours
the
treads
are
the
same
as
in
the
snowmobile
set
released
earlier
in
the
year
they
are
a
hard
plastic
thank
you
very
much
for
that
neat
review
ickelpete
y
your
picturesre
very
interesting
and
your
videos
really
good
that
set
looks
very
beautiful
to
me
a
formidable
new
technic
set
that
quicklyll
turn
into
an
everlasting
classic
for
sure
im
just
a
little
sorry
for
those
quality
problems
well
i
hope
that
tlcll
work
on
that
matter
and
fix
it
soon

thanks
for
that
awesome
review
it
makes
me
want
to
buy
this
set
i
think
itd
go
just
swell
with
the
mobile
crane
the
fact
that
it
has
all
the
motors
and
such
is
awesome
i
can
foresee
using
those
for
a
lot
of
other
functions
for
mocs
and
well
im
a
fan
of
treads
you
can
never
have
enough
treads
d
hm
would
you
be
able
to
tell
us
perhaps
after
a
test
or
two
what
kind
of
weight
this
beast
can
push
around
thank
you
hi
many
thanks
for
this
review
photos
and
videos
i
cant
wait
to
put
the
hands
on
mine
since
it
is
already
ordered
and
should
arrive
before
the
end
of
the
month
could
you
post
a
scan
or
photos
from
those
last
pages
in
the
building
instructions
where
the
parts
included
are
listed

nice
review
i
must
have
this
set
the
new
small
technic
sets
have
incredible
functionality
for
their
size
and
this
one
is
no
exception
with
only
106
parts
this
crane
can
roll
extend
rotate
lift
and
hold
in
any
position
and
has
working
stabilisers
the
boom
extends
the
same
as
the
other
sets
with
this
boom
simply
pull
it
it
works
surprisingly
well
and
due
to
circular
ridges
inside
the
boom
the
extension
which
is
just
a
standard
beam
will
hold
in
place
the
gear
at
the
back
controls
the
height
of
the
boom
as
you
can
see
the
boom
is
only
half
extended
boom
fully
extended
half
down
the
cable
is
kept
in
place
via
two
gears
and
a
blue
pin
same
as
the
7905
crane
even
under
decent
weights
this
works
well
the
stabilisers
however
can
not
handle
much
weight
once
the
load
is
moved
off
axis
the
stablilsers
are
a
very
simple
but
effective
design
another
shot
of
the
stablilsers
this
also
shows
how
far
the
boom
will
decend
the
boom
height
mechanism
works
well
also
i
love
the
cab
design
overall
this
is
a
remarkable
achievement
for
the
low
price
i
bought
it
for
the
boom
piece
as
i
want
to
improve
the
crane
that
came
with
7998
7898
i
highly
recommend
it
very
nice
review
sinner
y
wub
so
we
are
getting
more
and
more
reviews
with
figs
in
it
thats
great
i
actually
wanted
to
skip
this
technic
set
but
your
review
made
me
think
again
i
havent
seen
you
posting
a
price
so
i
will
do
that
for
you
p
its
just
999
in
germany
really
awesome
review
i
didnt
think
this
set
could
be
that
great
but
it
looks
very
nice
and
seems
quite
cheap

very

a
very
good

set

7998
that
is
the
new
heavy
loader
and
it
didnt
come

said
i
cant
help
but
think
the
minifigures
are
the
weak
part
of
the
set
snake
and
apu
are
great
but
the
rest
i
dont
know
they
kinda
redundant
now
they
could
at
least
give
us
new
torso
printing
like
homer
wearing
his
jacket
or
bart
wearing
his
blue
tshirt
or
marge
wearing
her
coat
or
as
i
said
in
the
discussion
thread
id
have
included
jasper
in
cmf
series
2
and
a
frozen
version
here
overall
the
set
looks
kinda
smaller
than
what
i
thought
i
agree
but
so
many
people
were
complaining
about
how
the
simpsons
house
should
have
included
the
most
common
versions
mostly
because
the
eyes
or
whatever
so
i
think
lego
played
it
safe
and
just
included
the
normal
versions
it
makes
sense
since
series
1
is
gone
forever
and
the
common
versions
were
in
there
and
this
set
is
bound
to
be
in
stock
for
a
very
long
time
like
the
death
star
i
never
really
agreed
when
people
were
complaining
about
the
alternate
eye
prints
personally
but
i
guess
this
is
a
good
business
choice
based
on
previous
feedback

am
i
have
sooo
mixed
feeling
about
that
i
loved
the
simpsons
house
save
for
the
terrible
wall
in
the
homer
and
marges
room
but
this
so
far
is
inferior
in
almost
every
aspect
the
walls
made
of
panels
is
a
bummer
i
expect
a
d2c
set
to
be
better
that
this
60
stickers
the
same
thing
same
price
for
less
bricks
and
smaller
build
then
the
house
strange
coloured
bricks
on
the
outside
wall
some
ugly
mix
of
yellow
tan
panels
again
with
their
fronts
facing
towards
the
inside
of
the
shop
so
we
and
up
with
those
squares
all
around
the
walls
are
yellow
this
was
so
nice
lost
opportunity
to
make
it
in
some
other
less
common
colour
then
again
the
set
overall
looks
is
good
the
roof
is
a
nice
detail
the
shop
looks
actually
like
a
real
one
not
just
an
approximation
of
one
the
roof
tiles
are
in
dark
orange
we
got
newrare
colour
here
the
car
looks
interesting
to
build
just
like
the
pink
one
from
the
house
lots
of
nice
references
to
the
show
its
the
simpsons
definitely
a
must
buy
but
for
a
discounted
price
ill
try
to
find
one
with
maybe
damaged
box
or

nice
review
but
i
have
one
question
is
the
transparent
dome
of
the
squishee
drink
removable
nopers
i
like
this
set
a
lot
better
than
the
simpsons
house
but
60
stickers
is
just
incredibly
disappointing
it
seems
quite
a
few
of
them
could
have
been
printed
parts
nice
review
im
building
it
need
to
finish
it
but
im
at
work
right
now
with
the
printed
piece
you
forgot
to
show
the
chocolat
milk
1x1
brick
which
is
exclusive
to
this
set
yet
it
isnt
referenced
on
bricklink
yet
only
the
blue
one
the
set
is
really
fun
to
build
with
a
lot
of
little
pieces
for
the
fridges
i
havent
put
the
stickers
yet
will
see
the
final
product
to
put
the
essentials
ones
i
recently
acquired
90
of
this
set
so
i
thought
i
would
do
a
review
of
it
please
note
that
half
of
the
minifigs
are
wrong
and
there
are
some
part
substitutions
this
is
the
only
set
that
comes
with
this
plate
there
is
a
depression
under
the
grey
plates
to
the
back
the
pool
depression
can
be
easily
covered
by
three
quarter
circle
plates
which
just
happen
to
be
included
in
this
set
good
set
design
lego
the
stairs
are
old
fabuland
ones
and
have
been
used
in
a
few
other
sets
this
is
the
only
one
that
has
them
in
parapink
however
what
is
the
difference
between
parapink
and
pink
dunno
the
big
windows
are
in
only
two
other
sets
both
of
them
dacta
ones
the
smaller
ones
were
in
one
other
paradisa
set
the
interior
while
simple
works
very
well
i
love
the
coffee
machine
a
cute
car
came
with
the
set
as
well
the
bird
house
is
a
nice
idea
as
well
once
the
current
visitors
leave
i
will
probably
be
breaking
this
set
i
wish
lego
would
go
back
to
these
sets
as
they
always
had
some
great
parts
in
them
nice
review
of
a
surprisingly
interesting
set
y
those
windows
are
great
and
no
doubt
difficult
to
get
classic
coffee
maker
simple
yet
exactly
right
that
baseplate
was
in
a
few
other
sets
but
never
with
that
pattern
would
have
made
a
great
base
for
some
of
the
classic
80s
houses
lego
used
to
treat
us
to
in
tan
was
part
of
the
adventurers
egypt
sets
as
recently
as
2001
it
was
a
base
for
ogel
versatile
plate
that
hopefully
hasnt
disappeared
completely
parapink
is
apparently
light
pink
on
brickshelf
so
i
guess
its
just
lighter
than
normal
pink
and
stopped
appearing
in
1995
just
so
you
know
that
monkey
is
drinking
too
much
and
likely
to
fall
in
the
pool
i
got
that
set
recently
as
well
bought
a
bulk
lot
and
there
was
all
but
1
minifig
in
there
gave
it
to
my
girlfriend
for
her
town
need
to
find
her
a
ristorante
now
nice
review

y
my
favorite
part
of
this
set
is

parrot

said
ok
its
time
for
me
to
make
a
conffesion
i
have
never
wathced
this
show
in
my
life
and
im
not
a
bit
curious
on
what
the
fuss
is
about
your
review
is
super
as
always
yoda
but
i
really
cant
say
anything
about
the
set
cause
i
dont
know
what
it
is
about
the
same
counts
for
me
i
have
never
seen
a
single
show
so
i
only
can
argue
about
the
bricks
as
are
i
dont
like
all
the
sb
sets
because
of
the
inflationary
use
of
stickers
more
to
that
see
below
there
are
some
bricks
that
are
really
cool
like
the
bun
disk
but
i
wont
buy
this
set
just
for
single
bricks
i
do
like
the
color
selection
because
of
the
comic
strip
relation
though

issue
i
so
agree
with
you

and
i

its

to
start
a
revolution
we
need
to
adress
this
thing
bigtime
thru
the
ambassadors
to
lego
and
go

on
thoso
stickers
yeah
revolution
on
if
someone
cares
for
the

ill
bring

what
is

you

from
this

in

as
for
the
review
if
it
actually
is
a
review
and
not
a
homage
cos
you
really
have
to
be
clear
about
that
on
these
boards
well
what
can
i
say
its
not

is
it

on

due
to
a

bl
order
in
the
us
i
couldnt
resist
to
add
two
hopper
waggons
to
my
train
layout
heres
a
review
of
this
fantastic
set
the
box
well
theres
nothing
really
special
about
it
the
open
box
with
three
polybags
note
that
there
are
only
three
different
colors
used
in
that
set
actually
there
are
4
but
you
cant
see
the
dark
grey
ones
great
color
composition
by
the
way
wub
and
no
stickers
d
oooops
i
opened
the
bags
too
fast
help
me
im
drowning
sing
not
following
the
instructions
i
built
the
wheels
first
to
get
the
larger
pieces
out
of
the
way
keep
on
rolling
this
is
the
load
of
the
hopper
waggon
11
round
bricks
altogether
when
i
opened
the
set
i
was
curious
if
it
was
a
new
colored
set
or
an
old
one
luckily
enough
it
was
an
old
one
with
old
dark
grey
i
dont
know
if
tlc
ever
produced
this
set
with
bley
from
the
following
pic
you
can
clearly
see
that
the
set
is
an
old
one
look
at
these
slope
bricks
see
what
i
mean
all
bricks
are
looking
exactly
the
same
buy
a
set
today
means
get
at
least
three
different
textures
on
the
slopes
and
maybe
even
more
shades
of
tan
x
i
have
said
that
in
many
other
threads
here
and
im
saying
it
again
back
to
the
roots
lego
you
were
able
to
produce
good
quality
show
us
you
can
still
do
it
sad
but
now
to
the
building
its
a
6
x
24
train
base
plate
youre
building
on
did
i
say
i
liked
the
colors
d
this
is
the
mechanism
to
unload
the
waggon
built
in
the
waggon
with
open
gates
and
with
closed
ones
almost
done
this
is
the
first
time
i
realized
that
minifigs
actually
can
step
on
those
ladders
a
short
lift
and
the
wheels
are
fixed
this
darn
mechanism
wait
im
coming
with
my
monkey
wrench
who
opened
that
door
again
do
i
have
to
do
it
all
on
my
own
finally
the
work
is
done
now
have
a
brake
one
shot
from
the
frontback
you
can
see
the
car
is
really
huge
8
i
put
it
behind
the
red
car
of
the
4512
that
sure
looked
very
strange
wacko
the
set
fits
a
lot
better
to
the
other
cars
of
the
my
own
train
theme
than
to
the
older
ones

you

morten
nice
review
about
a
nice

i
like
this

great

very

with

and
so
is
the

im
really
tempted
to
buy
a
second
set
just
to
complete
these
buildings
although
its
a
little
too
expensive
for
doing
so
and
it
wouldnt
even
fit
with
the
style
of
the
other

sb
on

nice
review
im
not
a
big
fan
of
those
spongebob
figs
however
this
set
has
some
very
useful
pieces
this
is
actually
the
first
time
i
took
a
decent
look
at
a
spongebob
set
thank
you
yoda
for
strike
2
its
sb
again
sticker
alarm
x
but
this
set
is
better
than
chum
bucket
there
are
far
more
interesting
parts
if
you
dont
like
sb
especially
the
light
house
and
the
little
hut
with
the
wooden
pontoon
y
and
yet
again
another
set
with
smooth
slopes
and
rough
ones
too
bad
too
bad
if
i
just
knew
the
person
who
is
responsible
for
that
nice
review
mate
the
set
looks
great
and
a
real
must
for
all
those
sb
fans
out
there
the
whole
set
scream
playability
thats
for
sure
which
is
great
because
lets
be
honest
theirs
gon
na
be
alot
of
kids
and
yoda
out
their
playing
with
it
p
xd
geezzzzz
what
is
it
with
all
those
bloody
stikers
this
set
would
be
soooooo
much
better
with
printed
pieces
instead
of
those
still
once
your
over
that
at
least
the
rest
is
ok
am
i
the
only
one

yoda
very
nice
review
yoda
though
i
think
you
should
review
the
course
because
it
looks
very
interesting
the
set
and
the
other
designer
sets
that
came
out
with
it
especially
4888
are
incredibly
well
designed
sets
i
wish
lego
would
go
back
to
doing
sets
like
these
as
i
loved
the
multitude
of
instructions
and
ideas
the
last
batch
of
creator
sets
had
zero
ideas
even
though
i
know
several
were
made
anyway
less
whining
more
review
the
lion
is
the
main
model
his
mouth
doesnt
fully
close
but
it
does
open
more
the
head
works
well
from
most
angles
i
love
the
dark
orange
bricks
great
for
rust
he
is
quite
solid
but
the
joints
take
the
weight
well
the
neck
goes
side
to
side
and
rotates
but
doesnt
go
up
and
down
the
body
is
built
in
two
parts
and
pinned
in
the
middle
with
what
is
left
you
can
make
what
i
think
is
a
hyena
a
silly
plant
moc
and
what
i
believe
is
a
vulture
there
are
also
instructions
for
a
few
other
models
including
a
bat
boar
and
a
snake
which
i
quite
like
he
can
be
built
at
the
same
time
as
this
cute
little
lizard
overall
this
is
a
great
set
with
an
excellent
blend
of
colours
and
pieces
i
wanted
it
for
steampunk
potentials
sweet
i
hope
you
liked
the
review
till
next
time
great
review
sinner
i
regret
not
buying
this
set
when
i
saw
it
cheap
in
a
local
sale
i
was
really
kidding
of
course
you
want
to
keep
it
who
wouldnt
i
was
going
to
buy
it
off
of
bl
anyway
xd
now

the

of
the

has
the
jurassic

logo
along
with
the
set
number
piece
count
etc
its
a
decent
box
size
for
a
20
set
here
it
is
compared
to
a
minifigure
heres
the
back
of
the
box
it
shows
all
of
the
features
from
the
set
an
ad
for
the
video
game
the
back
also
shows
a
small
picture
with
a
silhouette
of
the
dinosaurs
from
the
line
along
with
their
set
numbers
instruction
booklet
the
booklet
shows
the
same
thing
as
the
front
of
the
box
nothing
more
nothing
less
near
the
back
of
the
booklet
there
is
a
picture
with
all
of
the
characters
from
the
sets
the
other
page
shows
all
the
dinosaurs
with
a
mini
box
that
shows
the
size
comparisons
the
minifigures
the
minifigures
in
this
set
are
simon
masrani
and
an
acu
both
of
them
have
excellent
printing
on
the
front
and
the
back
the
gun
is
the
same
one
from
tlm
that
the
ssp
used
simon
masrani
is
the
only
one
with
a
double
sided
face
his
second
face
shows
a
scaredworried
expbbression
he
has
a
zipped
up
jacket
or
jumpsuit
with
a
shirt
underneath
the
acu
trooper
only
has
one
face
which
is
a
scaredworried
expbbression
i
would
have
a
scared
expbbression
too
if
i
was
about
to
get
eaten
by
a
dinosaur
he
has
great
detail
on
his
torso
and
legs
lets
take
a
look
at
the
vest
the
vest
is
the
same
mold
from
the
ssp
in
tlm
i
think
it
has
the
letters
acu
on
the
front
too
the
back
is
nothing
interesting
pteranodon
the
pteranodon
has
great
printing
too
the
colors
match
the
ones
that
the
pteranodons
from
the
movie
have
the
wings
mouth
and
head
are
a
rubbery
type
of
plastic
and
are
easily
bendable
it
uses
the
same
mold
from
the
pteranodon
in
the
2012
dino
line
heres
a
comparison
between
the
two
spare
parts
the
spare
parts
arent
many
just
a
few
extras
the
helicopter
at
first
the
helicopter
was
meh
when
i
first
saw
it
on
the
box
now
that
ive
built
it
ive
got
to
say
that
i
really
like
it
its
my
favorite
helicopter
of
all
of
the
ones
ive
built
its
sturdy
and
sleek
its
not
too
bulky
either
the
first
play
feature
in
this
set
is
the
net
launcher
it
works
pretty
well
not
one
of
my
favorite
features
but
it
does
what
its
meant
to
do
the
other
play
feature
is
on
the
other
side
its
a
stud
shooter
which
can
be
used
by
a
minifigure
you
can
put
it
on
their
hand
or
you
can
leave
it
there
and
let
someone
operate
it
the
shooter
can
fold
up
inside
the
helicopter
as
well
there
are
stickers
on
both
sides
of
the
helicopter
and
they
also
have
the
jurassic
world
logo
with
dino
marks
final
verdict
value
910
for
20
this
set
isnt
that
bad
the
parts
count
is
a
little
low
for
a
20
set
but
the
price
is
probably
because
of
licensing
other
than
that
its
a
great
deal
i
wouldve
hoped
for
maybe
some
bait
for
the
pteranodon
but
that
can
easily
be
fixed
design
910
i
really
love
the
way
this
helicopter
looks
its
sleekness
and
design
is
great
the
only
flaw
this
has
is
the
huge
net
launcher
its
too
big
in
my
opinion
minifigs
1010b
the
minifigures
are
extremely
detailed
and
it
even
includes
an
exclusive
minifigure
playability
910
there
are
many
things
you
can
do
with
this
set
the
swoosh
factor
is
great
and
so
are
the
play
features
parts
1010b
theyre
useful
parts
and
there
isnt
many
huge
specialized
pieces
in
here
either
overall
910
this
set
is
great
for
fans
of
jurassic
world
its
also
a
nice
parts
pack
theres
one
exclusive
minifigure
in
here
too
which
makes
it
even
better
having
a
little
fun
with
the
set
hope
you
liked
my
first
review
here
on
eurobricks
please
leave
any
suggestions
on
what
to
improve
thanks

i
love
the
dinos
in
these
sets
but
aside
from
that
the
builds
imo
kind
of
suck
just
like
the
last
dino
sets
this
just
has
a
franchise
connected
to
it
and
honestly
i
hope
it
does
well
enough
to
spark
more
dinojurassic
parkworld
interest
because
i
want
to
see
more
dino
minifigures
maybe
a
brontosaurus
or
something
i
will
most
likely
be
buying
many
of
the
dinosaur
minifigures
here
however
i
doubt
ill
buy
the
actual
sets
or
the
genetically
altered
dinosaur
which
can
only
work
for
jurassic
world
this
set
is
imo
average

am
said
nice
review
although
that
picture
of
the
ad
reminded
me
of
how
some
of
the
things
surrounding
jurassic
world
lego
that
is
seems
hastily
put
together
just
look
at
that
the
minifig
he
is
star
lords
head
and
hair
indiana
jones
torso
with
different
arms
and
city
legs
to
me
that
seems
a
bit
weak
especially
for
a
video
game
oh
yeah
i
just
noticed
that
thank
you
guys
im
glad
you
liked
this
review
its
a
nice
little
set
great
review
man
really
well
written
and
structured
hoping
to
go
on
a
hunt
and
see
if
this
is
available
in
uk
stores
soon
any
chance
you
have
a
picture
of
the
news
stand
next
to
the
detectives
office
building
as
i
would
love
to
see
the
scaling
for
that
as
a
fan
of
creator
houses
i
really
want
to
like
this
set
however
i
think
that
creator
houses
have
long
filled
a
niche
thats
neglected
elsewhere
residential
houses
we
havent
had
a
larger
residential
house
since
2013
im
not
sure
if
these
sets
have
anything
to
do
with
that
but
it
seems
like
they
may
be
the
replacement
for
larger
houses
and
id
much
rather
have
a
larger
house
set
than
a
set
like
this
i
also
agree
with
many
others
here
something
about
it
just
feels
incomplete
i
think
that
the
various
city
business
buildings
weve
gotten
in
recent
years
including
those
in
this
years
city
squarewhich
is
much
more
expensive
than
this
but
also
contains
much
more
make
for
better
buildings
at
this
scale
thanks
andy0306uk
your
very
clever
strategic
decision
to
serve
us
with
blurry
pictures
allowed
me
to
glance
at
this
review
without
ruinating
that
whole
wonderful
advent
surprise
too
much
p
y
but
although
i
loved
the
last
years
one
i
think
they
could
do
another
theme
or
perhaps
even
two
calendars
because
right
now
castles
pretty
hot
imo

really
hope
they
do
different
themes
next
year
but
not
sure
how
theyd
managed
24
different
minisets
for
castle
can
envisage
78
minifigs
but
what
else
yeah
i
guess
this
would
need
a
little
more
out
of
the
box
thinking
than
tlcs
doing
usually
for
their
castle
line
things
that
are
similar
to
the
city
theme
and
more
civil
life
based
like
some
blacksmith
equipment
market
place
bakery
farmer
and
so
on
but
a
wizard
workshop
a
hidden
treasure
and
some
medieval
furniture
would
also
work
fine
and
an
evil
santa
with
spiders
and
coal
pieces
as
gifts
and
a
sledge
pulled
by
a
dragon
of
course
d
no
girlsagain
and
no
santa
whats
up
with
that
sure
there
are
many
nice
pieces
to
give
life
to
every
city
layout
i
would
love
something
more
simple
a
girl
taking
her
dog
for
a
walk
a
boy
on
a
bicycle
simpler

those
mini

good
for

the

subtheme
sets
are
nice
but
the
others
not
so
good
the
05
version
waf
ok
the
06
version
was
better
with
bigger
sets
and
more
building
ones
and
the
07
is
poor
its
just
23
pieces
to
put
together
on
2x4
plates
where
are
the
gardening
accessories
where
are
some
nice
small
constructions
that
you
can
put
in
your
layout
like
a
mailbox
or
an
orodator

the

nice

i
personally
own
this

its
a
nice

could
have

hes
just
joking
about

im
glad
you
were
joking
about

im
not
that
big
of
a

but
i
had
the
need
to
correct
you
for
some
reason
with
that
said
i
bought
this

for

a

years
ago
looking
back
i
dont
really
care
about
the
figures
today
like
i
did

personally
i
thought
your
review
was
spot
on
and
i
very
much
enjoyed
your
tone
im
not
usually
much
of
a
minifig
person
but
i
will
admit
i
bought
this
set
mostly
for
dr
doom
and
considered
nova
a
bonus
growing
up
i
was
a
big
fan
of
the
fantastic
four
and
an
even
bigger
fan
of
dr
doom
i
hope
that
someday
the
film
rights
will
revert
to
marvel
and
well
finally
get
a
ff
film
that
respects
the
original
source
material
and
features
a
dr
doom
worthy
of
the
name
as
for
the
set
itself
i
dont
have
much
use
for
playsets
not
that
theres
anything
wrong
with
them
i
think
the
marvel
lego
line
could
use
more
of
them
in
fact
and
i
didnt
even
realize
it
was
linked
to
a
specific
show
as
ive
fallen
a
bit
out
of
touch
with
the
franchise
of
late
i
bought
it
i
built
it
it
sat
a
shelf
for
a
while
i
scrapped
it
for
parts
i
think
most
of
it
wound
up
as
a
greenhouse
for
my
winter
village
setup
its
not
a
bad
set
but
i
think
you
summed
things
up
nicely
when
you
called
it
mediocre
thanks
for
the
entertaining
review
thanks
for
the
reviewim
not
a
big
fan
of
spider
man
sets
but
this
set
really
impressed
me
this
must
because
of
the
design
of
this
set
and
the
minifigures
that
included
in
this
set
i
think
im
the
only
person
in
the
world
who
likes
fant4stic
was
it
the
best
superhero
movie
not
even
close
but
i
didnt
think
it
deserved
the
hate
it
got
it
was
just
incredibly
and
clumsily
mishandled
anyways
great
review
i
might
pick
this
one
up
if
only
for
the
beetle
fig
ooh
i
want
one
i
dont

i

sure
its

it
adds
to
the
fact

owning

notice
how
in
the
content
the
parts
fit
in
just
nice
without
additional
spare
space
for
anything
else
strange
isnt
it
that
when
tlc
is
responsible
for
the
shipping
we
see
optimum
usage
of
box
spaces
xd
imagine
if
all
boxes
were
this
efficient
499
sets
would
be
no
bigger
than
a
match
box
xd
xd
the
mtt
would
be
reduced
to
14
its
current
size

great
review
so
far
i
am
looking
forward
to
additional
posts
as
for
the
number
of
pins
from
the
peeron
inventory
for
the
set
there
are
over
400
technic
pins
of
various
lengths
insert
the
my
fingers
hurt
from
building
emoticon
keep
the
pictures
coming
the
minifigs
as
you
can
see
the
minifigs
are
really
nice
they
even
throw
in
an
extra
fleshie
head
no
doubt
these
will
fetch
quite
a
bit
on
the
bricklink
and
ebay
markets
im
keeping
mine
continuing
the
build
this
photo
shows
how
well
this
model
is
put
together
notice
that
they
use
four
of
the
threehole
beams
per
side
to
hold
this
together
i
remember
reading
that
you
can
hang
this
model
from
the
ceiling
i
dont
doubt
it
these
right
angle
technic
pieces
are
used
to
reinforce
the
structure
of
the
model
you
can
see
them
used
here
i
was
shocked
at
how
many
light
gray
plates
are
in
this
set
i
have
two
tubs
full
of
these
the
infrastructure
is
now
complete
i
got
hung
up
for
about
an
hour
looking
for
one
of
these
turns
out
lego
gave
me
an
extra
left
wedge
and
shorted
me
a
right
wedge
so
frustrating
i
had
to
stead
one
off
my
6211
star
destroyer
it
is
not
a
very
common
piece
by
the
way
hey
nice
review
im
up
to
about
the
same
point
as
you
page
70
to
be
exact
tho
i
didnt
have
that
missing
piece
thankfully
i
think
lego
have
done
a
much
better
job
at
packing
the
lego
this
time
i
remember
it
taking
me
much
longer
to
find
pieces
on
the
ucs
isd
build
thanks
for
this
review
sinner
i
love
this
house
with
the
nicely
made
tiled
corners
the
colorscheme
and
the
garage
the
only
thing
i
dislike
about
this
set
is
the
way
the
windows
are
attached
in
train
windows
so
they
turn
inwards
a
little
instead
of
the
usual
frames
with
shutterattachmentability
but
that
is
something
that
can
be
fixed
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
i
will
certainly
buy
this
house
some
day
when
i
find
it
at
reasonable
price
thank
you
for
the
nice
review
i
want
this
set
too
with
al
those
tan
bricks
and
black
slopes
and
the
cute
blue
car
wub
i
like
the
old
windows
more
i
hope
they
dont
stop
producing
them
sinner
thanks
for
this
outstanding
review
i
am
glad
that
i
had
read
this
review
in
advance
before
making
my
purchase
on
this
set
earlier
with
my
girlfriend
we
built
this
set
for
a
total
of
3
hours
to
complete
this
beauty
in
about
2
hours
ago
there
are
stars
circling
around
my
head
at
this
very
moment
when
i
post
this
reply
i
must
admit
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
that
this
is
an
wonderful
piece
of
house
that
simply
shows
the
beauty
of
it
with
the
european
kind
of
houses
where
there
is
a
garage
furthermore
there
is
a
lovely
blue
car
i
am
seeing
stars
right
now
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
i
must
drop
a
thanks
to
you
personally
as
well
although
it
is
empty
from
its
interior
unlike
the
4996
beach
house
but
this
set
has
the
majestic
look
which
simply
place
a
wow
factor
in
front
of
it
upon
completion
at
the
moment
we
had
plans
for
getting
the
second
set
next
month
to
build
the
other
design
as
well
hopefully
i
will
be
able
to
share
with
you
guys
all
of
my
different
creators
sets
with
its
alternate
designs
as
well
in
the
near
future
nice
pictorial
review
i
always
like
this
little
set
a
little
more
text
would
have
been
nice
but
that
is
ok
as
it
is
ps
you
should
have
mentioned
in
the
title
that
this
topic
is
picture
heavy
i
was
wondering
why
it
was
loading
so
slow
on
my
mobile
writing
a
decent
review
will
indeed
take
some
time
but
you
dont
need
to
do
it
in
a
single
session
if
each
time
is
45
hours
you
can
write
a
review
in
2
x
each
time
i
actually
bought
this
set
last
monday
as
it
was
reduced
to
1499it
actually
not
a
bad
little
set
considering
the
size
and
part
count
has
a
decent
array
of
functions
its
a
nice
little
setthe
b
model
looks
just
as
good
so
i
might
buy
a
second
set
as
you
get
the
bucket
left
over
and
i
need
that
bucket
for
another
set

remember
when
i
said
in
my
review
of
7090
to
expect
a
review
after
i
went
to
toysrus
well
somehow
things
didnt
work
out
but
fortunately
im
finally
reviewing
my
latest
purchases
starting
with
7091
catapault
defense
which
happens
to
be
one
of
the
best
sets
in
the
castle
line
the
box
and
instructions
lego
box
art
is
at
its
highest
point
ever
these
days
with
lots
of
special
effects
and
great
action
poses
the
castle
theme
is
no
exception
and
7091
isnt
either
ill
let
the
box
speak
for
itself
i
love
the
back
of
the
castle
boxes
as
well
since
they
give
another
action
scene
and
other
neat
info
like
a
layout
of
all
the
accessories
the
contents
only
the
bare
essentials
as
usual
piece
bags
and
instructions
i
seriously
wish
they
still
put
mini
catalogs
inside
sets
like
they
did
when
i
was
young
but
i
guess
they
are
too
expensive
to
make
or
something
ah
well
cant
have
everything
no
picture
of
the
instructions
this
time
but
since
that
isnt
necessary
ill
just
say
that
they
are
fine
and
do
not
have
a
problem
with
distinguishing
dark
gray
from
black
the
pieces
heres
your
basic
shot
of
every
piece
included
minus
a
few
extra
pieces
like
an
extra
viking
horn
and
black
skeleton
leg
not
too
shabby
for
a
10
usd
set
theres
a
lot
of
nice
pieces
in
7091
as
you
can
see
and
this
doesnt
include
the
accessories
or
minifig
parts
the
brown
plates
wheels
and
spoked
things
are
always
useful
and
the
dark
blue
and
gold
slopes
are
really
cool
however
theres
also
a
fair
amount
of
technic
in
here
so
be
warry
as
usual
for
the
castle
line
7091
has
a
heaping
helping
of
accessories
most
of
them
are
old
pieces
recolored
but
the
ball
on
chain
whats
the
actual
name
could
someone
tell
me
and
the
shields
are
brand
new
i
actually
like
the
new
skeleton
weapon
since
its
fairly
detailed
and
was
really
the
only
way
tlc
could
make
a
part
like
that
and
yes
the
shields
are
printed
quite
nicely
too
if
i
do
say
so
myself
plus
you
get
viking
horns
always
useful
to
have
a
grey
boulder
a
basket
and
3
helmets
not
a
half
bad
deal
eh
oh
who
am
i
kidding
its
awesome
minifigures
ah
yes
one
of
the
highlights
of
any
castle
set
you
get
2
soldiers
and
2
skellies
this
time
all
with
different
weapons
the
two
soldiers
are
just
regular
crown
troops
with
different
faces
nothing
special
except
that
they
are
awesome
anyway
the
skeletons
on
the
other
hand
are
much
more
interesting
an
archer
and
a
black
skellie
archers
cool
of
course
but
i
know
many
dont
like
the
printing
on
the
black
skeletons
well
let
me
say
that
i
dont
mind
it
so
much
the
only
real
problem
is
that
the
eyes
are
dark
red
instead
of
just
red
which
makes
the
printing
a
bit
less
noticeable
and
ive
been
through
it
before
that
the
new
skeleton
molds
in
general
dont
bother
me
at
all
go
skeletons
the
finished
set
alright
theres
two
builds
in
this
set
and
ill
start
with
the
smaller
the
skeleton
barricade
okay
so
its
nothing
special
but
its
cool
all
the
less
the
shield
on
the
front
and
the
slanted
spears
are
nice
touches
heres
just
how
the
skeletons
can
tower
over
their
own
barricade
with
a
little
step
ah
the
catapault
the
lovely
catapault
seriously
i
love
tlcs
design
very
effective
and
also
very
realistic
especially
compared
to
kk
love
the
side
details
and
the
swiveling
base
and
you
got
ta
love
the
clever
use
of
that
basket
playability
yes
ive
made
it
a
tradition
now
to
write
stories
for
any
castle
set
i
buy
and
this
isnt
the
last
one
you
can
be
sure
of
that
heres
one
featuring
everything
in
7901
oh
and
heres
a
small
ship
i
made
out
of
all
the
pieces
in
this
set
plus
a
couple
extra
figures
and
weapons
from
my
copy
of
7901
not
half
bad
imo
considering
what
i
had
to
work
with
overall
rating
presentation
910
pieces
810
minifigures
910
finished
model
910
playability
810
final
score
8610
once
again
i
highly
recommend
the
reviewed
set
castle
is
possibly
the
best
theme
this
year
and
this
set
is
one
of
many
that
prove
it
as
with
all
castle
sets
its
best
if
you
buy
several
if
you
want
to
truly
enjoy
it
but
this
set
alone
is
also
impressive
in
both
design
and
pieces
and
minifigures
get
at
least
one
if
you
have
even
a
slight
liking
for
castle

very
nice
review
i
like
the
amount
of
pics
and
that
alternate
model
i
wouldnt
have
thought
of
making
a
ship
from
those
parts
i
once
made
a
larger
crownieized
skellie
barrier
instead
a
very
nice
review
with
good
although
perhaps
a
little
too
big
pictures
y
now
i
realized
that
this
catapults
able
to
swivel
thats
neat
thank
you
xd
that
was
a
fun
review
i
picked
up
a
couple
of
these
on
holiday
in
france
and
it
was
one
of
the
main
reasons
i
went
allout
and
bought
the
rest
of
the
castle
range
dr
s
thats
a
superb
review
if
i
ever
saw
one
and
another
great
story
y
its
a
good
review
even
though
i
got
the
set
4
months
ago
p
this
just
reinforces
my
like
for
it
p
thanks
for
the
review
the
comic
was
great
d
your
alternate
model
is
great
as
well
i
would
never
have
thought
of
building
a
ship
out
of
a
catapult
p
lol
what
a
review
i
love
the
story
its
that
time
of
year
again
when
the
days
get
shorter
the
nights
get
colder
and
children
all
around
the
world
stare
longingly
into
warmly
lit
toy
shops
and
prepare
their
wishlist
to
send
to
santa
this
is
also
the
time
when
the
lego
group
releases
their
latest
winter
village
set
which
has
been
an
annual
tradition
for
the
past
seven
years
these
sets
have
been
very
popular
especially
among
afols
and
are
always
highly
anticipated
however
while
some
entries
in
this
series
have
been
more
popular
than
others
none
has
been
as
controversial
as
this
years
set
the
winter
toy
shop
which
is
a
rerelease
of
the
first
winter
village
set
10199
winter
toy
shop
from
2009
it
seems
that
many
think
that
this
set
didnt
need
to
be
remade
and
would
have
preferred
a
new
set
instead
or
that
it
is
not
different
enough
from
the
original
and
will
be
redundant
in
a
completionists
collection
does
it
deserve
all
the
hate
lets
find
out
disclaimer
i
dont
own
the
2009
version
so
i
cant
compare
them
visually
but
i
will
do
my
best
to
let
you
know
what
is
different
in
this
version
if
you
do
need

welcome
to
the
winter
toy
shop
the
holiday
season
has
arrived
and
the
toymaker
is
busy
finishing
off
his
latest
creations
outside
children
ski
and
snowboard
and
a
freshly
built
snowman
sparkles
in
the
light
that
shines
from
the
toyshop
tower
help
decorate
the
huge
tree
that
stands
at
the
center
of
the
square
play
with
the
curious
kitten
on
the
cozy
wooden
bench
or
join
in
with
the
carolers
beneath
the
ornate
streetlamp
this
charming
set
also
features
a
ladder
trees
in
various
sizes
jackinthebox
a
toy
biplane
helicopter
rocket
train
race
car
truck

tugboat
teddy

and
a

this
enchanting

and

a
male

female
caroler
a
woman
2
men
2
boys
and
a

sh
bricklink
brickset
the
box
the
box
art
of
this
set
is
similar
to
that
of
the
original
but
there
are
some
notable
differences
the
christmas
tree
is
on
the
right
side
of
the
image
this
time
while
the
park
bench
is
on
the
left
and
of
course
it
features
this
years
design
for
creator
boxes
with
the
dark
blue
stripe
along
the
right
side
and
the
expert
logo
in
the
top
right
corner
theres
also
a
small
picture
of
the
back
of
the
toy
shop
and
the
background
looks
less
cartoony
than
on
the
original
the
back
is
also
very
similar
showing
a
different
angle
of
the
toy
shop
along
with
some
closeups
although
this
time
there
is
no
minifig
lineup
instead
the
minifig
lineup
is
on
the
right
side
of
the
box
it
also
includes
the
accessories
that
each
minifig
comes
with
and
some
of
the
toys
on
the
left
side
of
the
box
there
is
a
thumbnail
of
the
box
art
and
the
set
name
in
six
different
languages
they
also
want
to
make
sure
that
you
know
that
there
are
batteries
included
by
saying
it
in
dozens
of
languages
the
top
of
the
box
features
the
inventory
and
a
11
scale
reference
with
the
female
caroler
on
the
bottom
there
is
a
picture
that
reminds
you
that
there
is
a
light
brick
included
in
this
set
in
case
that
wasnt
clear
from
the
front
of
the
box
and
it
confirms
that
yes
it
is
a
bad
idea
to
put
it
in
water
in
case
you
were
planning
to
go
swimming
with
your
winter
toy
shop
the
contents
inside
the
box
there
are
two
instruction
booklets
and
two
groups
of
bags
one
for
each
instruction
booklet
while
two
groups
of
bags
is
not
as
many
as
there
usually
are
in
other
sets
of
this
size
its
still
better
than
the
first
version
of
this
set
where
the
bags
werent
numbered
at
all
so
this
makes
the
build
a
bit
easier
the
large
bag
in
group
1
and
the
two
large
bags
in
group
2
have
a
white
stripe
going
down
the
middle
of
the
bag
and
only
have
one
group
number
printed
on
it
along
with
some
other
number
and
some
kind
of
scan
code
i
have
no
idea
why
they
made
this
distinction
for
these
bags
or
what
that
code
is
for
so
if
any
of
you
know
the
purpose
of
this
please
let
me
know
in
the
comments
below
here
is
a
random
instructions
page
as
you
can
see
the
building
steps
can
get
quite
challenging
as
they
sometimes
include
many
different
pieces
in
one
step
especially
when
it
uses
a
lot
of
brown
pieces
which
are
very
dark
and
hard
to
see
in
the
instructions
living
up
to
the
sets
status
as
an
expertlevel
set
most
of
the
time
though
the
instructions
are
pretty
clear
and
easy
enough
to
follow
there
are
some
parts
in
new
colors
in
this
set
that
werent
in
the
first
version
or
any
other
set
until
now
such
as
that
large
flat
technic
arch
in
dark
green
the
jester
hat
in
orange
and
blue
one
of
those
new
2z2
round
jumper
tiles
in
brown
a
golden
frog
and
a
snowboard
in
dark
blue
there
are
also
some
rare
friends
parts
that
make
their
creator
debut
here
such
as
the
skis
in
azure
and
that
new
clear
1x1
round
tile
with
a
tiny
tube
coming
out
of
it
which
is
usually
used
as
a
stand
for
friends
accessories
and
is
a
very
useful
piece
especially
for
snot
techniques
and
no
im
not
talking
about
the
type
of
snot
that
many
people
usually
have
stuck
in
their
nose
around
this
time
of
year
there
are
some
printed
parts
as
well
such
as
the
clock
tile
the
letter
tile
and
the
register
slope
like
in
the
first
version
of
the
set
we
also
get
a
new
face
print
for
the
white
cat
which
is
more
in
line
with
other
modern
cat
designs
but
the
best
part
is
the
shop
sign
which
is
printed
this
time
around
it
features
a
lovely
wood
pattern
the
words
toy
shop
and
a
toy
soldier
on
both
sides
of
the
sign
which
is
ironic
since
the
shop
doesnt
seem
to
sell
any
toy
soldiers
like
this
but
it
looks
so
good
on
the
sign
that
i
wont
sue
them
for
false
advertising
the
minifigs
lets
start
with
the
most
unique
figures
in
this
set
the
carolers
these
two
were
also
the
highlight
in
the
first
version
of
the
set
but
in
the
original
they
both
had
the
same
head
this
one
which
featured
a
very
questionable
facial
expression
that
could
easily
be
taken
out
of
context
in
this
version
they
have
unique
faces
which
look
much
better
and
help
distinguish
their
gender
the
male
caroler
uses
lord
vampyres
torso
which
looks
quite
snazzy
on
him
maybe
this
is
lord
vampyre
before
he
became
a
vampire
the
female
caroler
is
easily
the
best
minifig
in
the
set
though
because
in
addition
to
her
exclusive
head
she
also
gets
an
exclusive
torso
and
skirt
print
a
huge
improvement
over
the
generic
unprinted
one
in
the
original
she
also
gets
the
queen
hair
in
dark
brown
and
aragorns
lined
cape
instead
of
two
combined
regular
capes
this
set
truly
is
the
return
of
the
queen
the
snowman
is
technically
not
a
minifig
but
as
you
can
see
here
he
is
exactly
as
tall
as
one
and
he
is
the
first
thing
you
build
after
the
minifigs
so
i
included
him
here
he
has
mostly
the
same
design
as
before
except
this
time
he
has
robot
claws
for
arms
instead
of
levers
which
is
good
since
they
allow
him
to
hold
accessories
such
as
his
broom
his
carrot
nose
is
included
separately
again
the
carolers
both
have
back
printing
while
the
snowman
looks
no
different
from
the
back
than
he
does
from
the
front
here
you
can
see
the
black
side
of
the
females
cape
this
lined
cape
is
so
much
nicer
than
the
solution
they
used
in
the
original
next
up
we
have
what
i
assume
is
a
married
couple
who
are
likely
the
parents
of
at
least
one
of
the
kids
as
well
as
the
toymaker
who
i
will
call
geppetto
the
man
in
the
pinstripe
suit
was
not
included
in
the
first
version
of
the
set
so
hes
a
bonus
minifig
these
guys
are
fairly
generic
but
they
have
some
detailed
torso
prints
so
they
look
pretty
nice
geppetto
seems
to
have
gotten
younger
since
the
release
of
the
original
set
since
his
gray
hair
has
now
turned
dark
tan
and
he
doesnt
seem
to
need
glasses
anymore
the
men
both
have
back
printing
but
the
woman
is
the
only
one
in
this
set
who
doesnt
get
a
back
print
why
you
got
ta
be
so
discriminating
against
women
lego
last
but
not
least
there
are
the
kids
one
of
the
boys
wears
dark
blue
pants
a
green
jacket
and
a
wool
cap
he
looks
a
bit
like
a
lumberjack
so
lets
call
him
lumberjack
boy
or
jack
for
short
the
little
girl
wears
an
outfit
that
wouldnt
look
out
of
place
in
the
friends
theme
with
a
lavender
scarf
and
pants
ill
call
her
lavender
the
second
boy
is
wearing
an
octan
jacket
and
a
sports
helmet
which
makes
it
ironic
that
he
is
the
one
not
doing
any
winter
sports
on
the
box
art
ill
call
him
president
business
junior
or
pbj
for
short
all
of
the
kids
have
fairly
detailed
back
printing
which
makes
up
for
the
fact
that
much
like
the
adults
they
are
made
out
of
mostly
common
parts
pbjs
helmet
and
scarf
cover
up
the
back
of
his
head
nicely
which
is
important
as
you
will
see
in
the
next
picture
whats
also
great
about
these
figs
is
that
half
of
them
have
a
doublesided
head
here
you
can
see
pbj
doing
his
best
macaulay
culkin
impression
i
also
removed
his
scarf
so
you
can
see
the
printing
on
his
torso
better
but
hes
not
the
only
one
who
seems
to
be
easily
scared
the
mother
also
has
a
very
alarmed
expression
maybe
she
got
surprised
by
the
jackinthebox
or
maybe
she
just
realized
how
expensive
toys
are
nowadays
you
can
see
the
female
carolers
back
printing
here
her
alternate
expression
is
a
nonsinging
face
which
is
very
nice
to
have
and
i
wish
the
male
caroler
could
have
one
too
she
looks
quite
cute
with
those
rosy
cheeks
but
the
most
adorable
out
of
all
of
them
has
to
be
the
little
girl
she
comes
with
a
pouting
sad
face
that
will
melt
your
heart
please
dont
cry
ill
buy
you
any
toy
you
want
just
stop
looking
at
me
like
that
the
build
the
first
half
of
the
build
is
dedicated
to
the
surroundings
of
the
toy
shop
it
includes
the
christmas
tree
the
park
bench
the
snowman
the
toys
the
carolers
jack
and
lavender
the
large
bag
contains
two
smaller
bags
with
small
pieces
a
white
box
that
contains
the
carolers
cape
and
the
jester
hat
in
its
own
little
bag
the
first
thing
you
build
after
the
minifigs
and
the
snowman
is
the
toys
this
version
of
the
set
has
a
lot
more
toys
than
the
original
which
is
good
because
i
always
felt
that
the
first
toy
shop
was
a
bit
light
on
toys
also
the
ones
that
were
in
the
original
have
been
updated
for
example
instead
of
the
two
pairs
of
skis
you
now
get
one
pair
of
skis
that
use
the
new
ski
mold
and
a
snowboard
the
jackinthebox
is
mostly
the
same
except
it
now
has
an
orange
and
blue
color
scheme
instead
of
the
red
and
blue
from
the
original
this
change
was
probably
not
necessary
but
hey
at
least
we
get
a
new
jester
hat
out
of
it
and
instead
of
the
brickbuilt
teddy
bear
you
get
the
new
teddy
bear
mold
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
this
change
because
i
actually
kinda
liked
the
brickbuilt
teddy
design
and
using
a
specialized
mold
seems
to
be
going
against
the
spirit
of
creator
sets
but
on
the
other
hand
i
cant
deny
that
the
molded
teddy
looks
better
than
the
blocky
old
one
meh
the
new
toys
include
a
tugboat
which
has
some
rounded
technic
pieces
as
its
hull
a
biplane
a
rocket
a
helicopter
and
a
truck
that
cleverly
uses
roller
skates
for
its
wheels
these
are
all
quite
brilliant
designs
that
feel
like
micro
versions
of
lego
city
sets
and
make
a
great
addition
to
the
set
here
is
a
back
view
of
some
of
the
more
complex
models
as
you
can
see
the
friends
accessory
stand
has
been
cleverly
used
to
hold
the
biplanes
fin
in
place
and
to
provide
a
stand
for
the
helicopter
the
jackinthebox
has
a
hinged
lid
the
only
thing
that
bugs
me
a
bit
is
the
tpiece
on
top
of
the
helicopter
that
holds
the
rotor
in
place
but
i
cant
think
of
any
better
way
they
could
have
done
it
next
is
the
ladder
that
is
used
to
decorate
the
tree
which
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
first
version
the
supports
are
on
a
clickhinge
so
they
can
be
adjusted
or
folded
away
then
you
build
the
tree
itself
you
begins
of
course
with
the
stand
which
is
mostly
the
same
design
as
before
but
this
time
the
plates
at
the
bottom
are
brown
instead
of
white
and
have
golden
studs
as
feet
next
you
build
the
first
layer
of
branches
the
main
difference
in
this
version
of
the
tree
is
that
this
one
actually
has
a
brown
stem
rather
than
just
a
technic
axle
on
which
you
stack
the
layers
of
branches
one
by
one
you
wont
be
able
to
see
the
stem
in
the
final
result
but
i
like
this
change
as
it
makes
the
tree
more
realistic
then
you
add
the
second
layer
of
branches
this
one
doesnt
have
lightscandles
and
attaches
to
the
lower
layer
at
an
angle
using
the
four
transyellow
studs
close
to
the
stem
the
third
layer
is
added
this
one
has
lights
again
each
layer
is
similar
in
that
they
are
all
made
out
of
green
plates
that
are
built
around
a
4x4
ring
plate
but
they
get
smaller
each
time
and
are
constructed
differently
enough
for
the
build
not
to
feel
repetitive
with
the
addition
of
the
fourth
layer
we
get
close
to
finishing
the
tree
lastly
you
add
one
more
layer
and
the
tip
of
the
tree
now
its
time
to
decorate
the
tree
however
its
not
as
fun
as
it
sounds
since
that
requires
you
to
add
lights
to
the
two
chainsropes
first
which
can
get
a
bit
repetitive
the
clips
holding
the
lights
to
the
chain
were
white
but
this
time
theyre
pearl
gold
which
looks
much
nicer
in
my
opinion
the
next
part
of
the
build
is
the
park
bench
with
the
streetlamp
and
the
little
tree
this
is
a
fairly
quick
build
with
not
much
to
it
the
fishbowl
helmet
parts
are
a
useful
piece
that
you
dont
see
too
often
so
its
nice
to
get
them
again
in
this
remake
the
design
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
in
the
original
set
except
for
the
wreaths
on
the
streetlamp
which
use
a
green
life
preserver
instead
of
a
round
2x2
plate
this
is
another
instance
where
they
use
a
specialized
piece
instead
of
a
brickbuilt
solution
but
im
okay
with
that
because
unlike
with
the
teddy
bear
this
part
was
not
originally
intended
to
be
a
wreath
so
its
still
nice
part
usage
the
second
half
of
the
build
is
dedicated
to
the
toy
shop
itself
and
includes
the
couple
geppetto
and
pbj
please
note
that
there
is
a
fourth
6x10
plate
burried
under
the
parts
you
begin
by
tiling
the
floor
setting
up
the
walls
and
adding
the
interior
items
such
as
the
fireplace
the
cash
register
and
the
toy
displays
next
you
add
the
walls
windows
and
the
door
and
the
ground
floor
of
the
shop
is
finished
so
far
the
build
is
the
same
as
the
old
toy
shop
except
this
time
they
decided
to
have
the
white
stripes
on
the
marquees
be
the
longer
ones
instead
of
the
dark
red
ones
for
some
reason
i
dont
know
why
they
did
this
and
kinda
would
have
preverred
to
get
dark
red
1x1
plates
instead
of
white
but
it
doesnt
detract
from
the
look
of
the
shop
so
i
dont
really
care
now
we
begin
with
the
upper
floor
this
is
where
things
start
to
look
a
little
different
can
you
tell
the
difference
the
difference
is
that
this
time
they
attach
the
roof
using
cliphinges
instead
of
bulky
technic
constructions
which
gives
you
more
space
on
this
floor
and
allows
it
to
look
more
like
an
actual
attic
they
even
tile
the
floor
next
to
the
frog
clock
aftter
adding
the
roof
the
build
is
finished
the
main
roof
feels
a
bit
loose
since
its
only
attached
to
the
building
by
one
side
im
not
sure
if
this
was
an
issue
in
the
old
toy
shop
but
its
not
a
big
deal
i
just
wouldnt
pick
the
set
up
by
the
roof
what
i
do
like
is
that
they
used
double
cheese
slopes
on
the
awning
on
the
outer
wall
of
the
tower
instead
of
singles
which
makes
it
a
bit
easier
to
build
i
like
how
the
supports
under
the
tower
roof
now
match
those
of
the
main
roof
the
wreaths
have
also
been
updated
like
the
ones
on
the
streetlamp
and
those
technic
arches
under
the
roof
look
a
lot
more
like
garlands
now
on
the
original
they
were
dark
gray
so
i
didnt
even
know
they
were
supposed
to
be
garlands
and
assumed
they
were
part
of
the
architecture
the
shop
sign
looks
a
lot
better
now
that
it
is
printed
the
old
one
just
looked
like
a
white
flag
i
also
like
how
the
small
plates
under
the
marquee
give
it
a
wavy
look
and
they
included
two
trees
in
different
sizes
on
the
right
side
of
the
shop
the
back
is
nice
and
open
and
allows
you
to
see
the
rest
of
the
toys
the
robot
train
and
race
car
all
of
which
have
just
as
much
of
a
simple
and
clever
design
as
the
other
toys
the
clock
looks
much
nicer
with
the
new
golden
frog
because
golden
frogs
make
everything
better
spare
parts
there
are
quite
a
few
small
parts
left
over
including
a
roller
skate
and
one
of
those
friends
accessory
stands
which
will
come
in
handy
the
complete
set
here
you
can
see
the
full
set
together
it
looks
quite
nice
and
festive
with
all
the
little
details
and
there
are
many
scenes
that
you
can
play
out
with
it
you
can
have
the
minifigs
decorate
the
tree
have
the
kids
play
in
the
snow
have
the
carolers
sing
by
the
bench
have
the
toymaker
build
some
toys
in
his
workshop
or
have
the
parents
buy
presents
for
their
kids
its
a
festive
toyfilled
winter
wonderland
the
fireplace
looks
cozy
and
i
like
the
brick
pattern
going
up
the
chimney
the
entrance
of
the
shop
looks
a
bit
empty
aside
from
the
cash
register
i
feel
like
they
could
have
displayed
some
more
toys
here
but
oh
well
being
a
set
targeted
at
teens
and
adults
there
arent
really
any
play
features
aside
from
the
light
brick
which
is
attached
to
a
hinge
so
you
can
either
activate
it
by
pressing
the
button
with
your
finger
or
tilting
the
brick
upward
so
that
the
button
is
pressed
against
the
roof
however
since
the
roof
is
not
connected
in
the
middle
and
only
attached
on
the
sides
it
tends
to
split
open
a
bit
when
you
do
that
so
im
not
sure
if
attaching
the
roof
this
way
here
was
such
a
good
idea
nevertheless
it
looks
quite
nice
when
the
light
is
lit
ratings
design
55
this
set
is
as
gorgeous
as
it
was
back
in
2009
the
small
updates
that
they
made
are
mostly
good
ones
although
the
absence
of
a
brickbuilt
teddy
is
a
bit
disappointing
and
the
new
way
the
roof
is
attached
while
not
as
bulky
as
before
makes
the
roof
slightly
unstable
but
those
are
just
nitpicks
build
55
there
are
some
interesting
building
techniques
here
such
as
those
on
the
tree
the
roof
and
the
toys
the
fact
that
the
parts
are
only
split
into
two
groups
and
the
part
callouts
can
get
fairly
complex
makes
it
a
challenging
enjoyable
build
minifigs
55
they
did
a
great
job
updating
the
figs
in
this
set
while
only
3
of
the
torsos
in
the
original
had
any
printing
all
of
the
torsos
have
printing
front
and
back
in
this
set
even
the
skirt
and
cape
of
the
female
caroler
you
get
two
exclusive
heads
and
half
of
the
heads
are
doublesided
plus
you
get
8
instead
of
7
minifigs
you
really
cant
ask
for
more
in
a
creator
set
playability
45
this
set
is
more
meant
to
be
displayed
than
to
be
played
with
but
there
are
plenty
of
things
to
play
with
if
you
want
all
the
different
minifigs
accessories
and
set
pieces
make
for
endless
possibilities
for
play
its
especially
fun
to
swoosh
the
micro
vehicles
around
parts
35
there
are
lots
of
good
parts
here
most
of
them
are
fairly
common
but
there
are
some
rare
parts
and
some
even
in
exclusive
colors
price
45
this
set
costs
20
more
than
the
original
but
considering
that
this
set
has
nearly
900
pieces
including
some
rare
and
exclusive
ones
as
well
as
more
minifigs
with
much
better
printing
i
think
80
is
still
a
fair
price
overall
55
so
whats
my
opinion
of
this
set
for
a
remake
i
think
its
great
they
managed
to
make
a
good
set
even
better
are
the
changes
minor
yes
are
they
an
improvement
mostly
yes
were
they
necessary
perhaps
not
but
its
good
that
they
made
them
instead
of
just
rereleasing
the
exact
same
set
so
if
you
didnt
get
the
first
winter
toy
shop
i
can
highly
recommend
getting
this
one
if
you
do
already
have
the
old
version
this
one
might
still
be
worth
picking
up
for
the
hugely
improved
minifigs
and
rare
parts
alone
as
for
the
controversy
over
rereleasing
the
winter
toy
shop
i
can
see
where
the
haters
are
coming
from
but
i
find
their
complaints
to
be
quite
petty
i
can
understand
if
youre
disappointed
because
you
already
have
the
first
winter
toy
shop
and
were
looking
forward
to
a
new
set
this
year
but
theres
always
next
year
if
youre
a
completist
and
feel
like
tlg
is
forcing
you
to
buy
a
set
you
dont
need
youre
wrong
nobody
is
forcing
you
to
buy
anything
but
yourself
if
you
decide
to
buy
every
set
in
a
theme
no
matter
what
it
is
thats
your
problem
not
legos
so
put
down
your
torches
and
pitchforks
and
just
be
glad
that
they
improved
the
set
design
and
gave
us
another
chance
to
buy
this
classic
set
there
are
far
worse
things
that
can
happen
in
this
world
than
lego
rereleasing
one
of
their
most
popular
sets
sorry
for
that
little
rant
so
what
is
your
opinion
on
rereleases
like
this
please
cast
your
vote
in
the
poll
above
i
hope
you
enjoyed
this
special
eurobricks
reviewers
academy
review
and
would
like
to
thank
the
lego
group
for
the
opportunity
to
review
this
set
happy
holidays
everyone

by

yaramanoglu
on
flickr
thanks
for
a
great
review
first
of
all
i
do
like
the
upgrades
and
changes
made
from
the
original
2009
set
more
colours
and
parts
are
offcourse
available
today
than
back
in
2009
it
does
look
like
a
great
set
and
i
would
really
realy
have
loved
to
get
it
myself
if
i
had
the
funds
however
their
are
so
many
other
sets
thats
first
priority
for
me
this
december
and
next
year
so
sadly
i
might
have
to
pass
on
this
if
its
not
that
i
can
get
it
redicioulusly
cheap
at
some
point
and
yeah
we
should
appreciate
that
lego
does
keep
sets
coming
even
if
its
just
upgrades
from
earlier
releases
town
is
known
for
a
new
police
and
fire
station
every
year
cant
see
why
a
new
toyshop
is
so
upsetting
once
again
thanks
for
a
great
review
and
happy
holidays
to
you
as
well
nice
to
see
they
finally
updated
that
generic
screaming
face
from
the
2007
castle
line
awesome
review
oky
i
have
the
old
set
so
i
wont
be
picking
this
up
great
review
thanks
oky
imo
the
only
significant
improvements
over
the
2009
version
are
the
figures
toys
and
printed
shop
sign
as
i
already
have
the
older
one
ill
have
to
give
this
one
a
pass
thanks
for
the
excellent
review
unfortunately
it
only
highlights
how
minimal
the
upgrades
are
though
they
are
nice
definitively
a
pass
for
me
lets
hope
lego
does
continue
to
make
the
more
realistic
winter
village
sets
versus
santa
im
not
opposed
to
a
rehash
the
post
office
could
use
some
improvements
for
example
but
this
one
is
just
a
wee
bit
minimal
i
bought
it
and
im
very
happy
with
it
thanks
oky
for
this
fine
review
i
agreed
with
your
sentiments
on
the
unnecessary
rants
i
also
owned
the
2009
version
and
even
though
there
are
minor
improvements
there
must
be
a
logical
reason
for
its
release
again
but
is
not
entirely
the
same
i
felt
is
an
excellent
opportunity
for
others
to
acquire
this
design
especially
after
six
years
ago
as
for
myself
i
will
probably
buy
this
if
my
spare
funds
allow
me
to
own
this
set
thanks
for
the
kind
comments
everyone
i
like
hearing
your
opinions
on
this
set

am
said
pity
the
poll
has
no
option
yes
but
only
in
addition
to
new
sets
not
in
stead
of
new
sets
i
dont
think
that
would
be
a
realistic
option
as
that
would
mean
that
they
would
have
to
spend
twice
the
resources
on
this
theme
which
i
dont
think
they
are
ready
to
do
but
if
more
people
would
like
this
option
i
can
add
it
to

after
mocking
people
for
holding
a
particular

you
then
turn
around
and
ask

to
express

no
thanks
i
guess
ill
keep
my
opinions
to
myself
i
certainly
dont
want
to
be
labeled
a
hater
im
not
mocking
anyone
i
just
think
that
some
people
need
to
calm
down
a
bit
and
that
tlg
is
getting
more
hate
than
they
deserve
for
this
set
but
thats
just
my
opinion
and
youre
welcome
to
disagree
with
it
everyone
is
entitled
to
their
own
opinion
including
you
and
me
and
yes
i
would
love
to
hear
your
thoughts
on
this
matter
because
i
would
like
to
have
a
friendly
discussion
on
this
subject
thanks
for
the
nice
review
the
landing
mechanism
looks
quite
cute
arent
the
yellow
axles
5l
not
4l
very
strange
that
they
would
release
such
a
part
it
says
5l
in
the
parts
list
hi
there
nice
model
great
review
i
almost
reverse
engineered
this
model
but
used
wrong
parts
for
landing
wheels
didnt
know
how
to
fix
the
nose
proper
and
so
on
so
i
was
very
interested
in
this
model
and
i
like
playing
with
it
i
love
the
reviews
but
i
think
i
have
to
mention
that
the
yellow
axle
must
be
a
5l
the
picture
shows
a
5l
and
a
5l
would
fit
the
size
of
the
model
the
cart
has
also
a
5l
in
yellow
what
sitze
is
the
yellow
axle
in
this
seit
really
4l
as
written
in
the
text
greetings
robert
good
review
as
always
jim
when
i
first
saw
this
set
i
thought
that
it
would
make
a
great
parts
pack
for
me
as
that
i
have
about
20
white
pieces
in
my
technic
collection
all
from
42043
and
this
set
has
some
really
useful
ones
all
for
a
cheap
price
those
7l
flex
axles
will
be
extremely
useful
in
my
current
build
im
doing
set
is
only
interesting
for
the
panels
thats
all
it
is
to
me
review
42046
getaway
racer
introduction
starting
with
the
42010
offroad
racer
and
42011
race
car
in
2013
tlg
released
two
sets
in
the
first
half
of
each
year
using
a
pullback
motor
the
pullback
motor
allows
the
model
to
be
pulled
back
followed
by
forward
motion
usually
theres
no
apparent
relation
between
the
two
set
other
than
the
ability
to
combine
them
into
an
alternate
build
this
year
there
seems
to
some
sort
of
cops
and
robbers
scene
going
on
a
getaway
racer
and
a
police
interceptor
that
cant
be
a
coincidence
makes
you
wonder
who
will
be
victorious
the
good
guys
or
the
bad
guys

this

i
wont
show
any
building
steps
lets
skip
right
to
the
finished
model
below
you
can
see
the
end
result
in
my
opinion
the
model
looks
great
its
got
that
hot
rod
vibe
going
on
and
the
stickers
add
darkness
to
the
vibe
slight
problem
with
this
set
is
that
it
really
needs
the
stickers
to
finish
the
look
otherwise
its
quite
dull
with
black
and
dark
grey
liftarms
and
panels
the
rear
view
shows
the
pullback
motor
connected
directly
to
the
rear
axle
in
this
image
you
can
also
clearly
see
the
exhaust
pipes
on
the
side
which
are
very
well
executed
the
3x3
technic
discs
with
stickers
used
in
the
rim
result
in
only
seeing
a
part
of
the
rim
this
works
very
well
with
the
golden
rims
the
bottom
view
shows
the
chassis
of
the
car
nothing
really
noteworthy
as
you
would
expect
from
a
pullback
set
video
the
following
video
gives
you
an
overview
of
the
finished
model
parts
left
these
six
parts
are
left
after
building
the
model
seems
about
right
features
and
functions
this
being
a
pullback
motor
set
it
only
has
a
single
feature
the
video
below
demonstrates
the
acceleration
of
the
vehicle
my
girlfriend
was
kind
enough
to
catch
the
model
before
it
fell
to
the
ground
or
did
it
hit
something
before
it
fell
to
the
ground
video
this
video
shows
the
pullback
functionality
bmodel
the
alternate
model
is
a
combined
build
with
the
police
interceptor
which
you
can
see
on
the
back
of
the
box
unfortunately
the
instructions
for
the
combined
bmodel
are
not
included
so
i
didnt
get
a
chance
to
build
it
this
would
make
for
a
fun
challenge
building
the
bmodel
without
the
instructions
summary
pullback
sets
are
not
the
most
technically
advanced
models
so
you
cant
expect
any
other
functionality
than
hitting
the
walls
in
your
house
however
i
think
they
are
very
appealing
to
kids
the
fact
that
this
years
pullback
sets
form
a
duo
adds
to
the
fun
in
my
opinion
tlg
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
with
the
getaway
racer
and
police
interceptor
the
getaway
racer
looks
very
badass
which
is
something
you
dont
see
every
day

technic
set

am
said
you
are
right
i
came
to
the
same
conclusion
when
writing
the
review
i
tell
you
it
doesnt
look
that
good
without
stickers
but
i
dont
have
a
picture
to
prove
it
to
be
honest
i
compared
it
to
the
model
posted
in
the
2016
topic
a
few
days
ago
i
applied
the
stickers
before
building
the
model
so
i
wasnt
able
to
make
a
proper
comparison
i
will
keep
it
in
mind
for
future
reviews
thanks
for
the
suggestion
youre
welcome
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
stickers
for
2
reasons
i
do
reuse
all
the
parts
normallyand
also
i
believe
a
model
should
look
great
even
without
stickers
then
obviously
they
can
be
a
plus
but
only
afterwords
anyway
im
enjoying
the
reviews
as
usual
and
those

another

theres
anything

with
that
it
is
a
littler
weird
that
the

is
shown
outside
the
mine
but
whatever
the
back
of
the
box
again
very
standard
its
oddly
technical
showing
the
exact
angle
of
the
machine
when
turning

thats
the
sort

nerdy
detail
that
technic
people
like
the

as
well
the
11
part
the
11
part
on
the
top
of
the
box
is
especially
helpful
with
this
set
these
mining
machines
are
very
oddly
proportioned
since
they
need
to
fit
in
mine
tunnels
so
its
hard
to
judge
the
model
size
based
on
the
wheels

im
building
the
alternate
first
so
thats
how
ill
write
the
review
theres
power
for
something
probably
the
engine
being
taken
off
the
one
axle
here
overall
a
pretty
standard
technic
frame
beginning
with
some
structural
beams
a
frame
and
using
liftarms
to
support
axles
out
to
the
sides
more
of
the
frame
the
far
end
of
the
model
has
some
obvious
steering
mechanism
being
formed
as
well
as
a
pivoting
arm
right
in
the
center
thats
probably
the
connection
from
the
hand
of
god
knob
the
steering
yup
called
it
oddly
there
is
a
different
turning
radius
between
right
and
left
right
now
i
wonder
if
thatll
get
fixed
more
mechanisms
thats
looking
more
technic
now
sad
to
see
a
ujoint
being
used
just
as
a
fixed
straight
connection
like
that
but
it
is
the
alternate
model
the
engine
block
because
all
engines
should
be
enclosed
in
a
red
cylindrical
housing
am
i
right
the
chassis
its
definitely
coming
together
now
and
yes
the
bmodel
instructions
tell
you
to
put
the
stickers
on
it
doesnt
matter
whether
you
build
the
main
or
alternate
first
youll
get
the
stickers
on
almost
there
were
a
couple
leftover
that
didnt
get
used
in
the
bmodel
almost
done
with
the
rest
of
the
body
done
and
the
wheels
on
you
really
get
the
scale
of
this
machine
that
blue
seat
is
tiny
compared
to
the
rest
of
it
and
yes
the
uneven
steering
lock
got
fixed
after
putting
the
wheels
on
you
add
a
couple
of
pin
with
ball
pieces
to
the
underside
to
restrict
the
steering
they
didnt
do
that
at
first
so
that
you
could
turn
the
axles
sharper
while
putting
the
wheels
on
which
made
it
easier
to
do
the
grinder
keeping
in
mind
the
scale
of
the
machine
this
thing
looks
terrifying
the
tan
gear
at
the
back
drives
the
spinning
blade
up
front
the
red
bushes
near
the
turntable
let
you
adjust
the
angle
all
done
the
arm
quickly
attaches
to
the
body
and
its
done
sadly
that
tan
gear
doesnt
connect
to
anything
its
just
a
knob
so
you
can
spin
the
blade
by
hand
raise
your
hand
if
youre
sure
i
think
im
dating
myself
with
that
title
this
thing
has
massive
reach
im
imagining
this
inside
a
mine
grinding
away
the
rock
overhead
pretty
viciously
effective
machine
the
crank
on
this
side
of
the
model
is
used
to
raise
and
lower
the
arm
works
well
and
the
grey
spacer
makes
it
nice
to
use
since
it
spins
freely
the
leftovers
not
much
left
for
a
bmodel
nice
usage
starting
the
main
model
the
main
model
starts
similarly
to
the
alternate
with
a
frame
some
axles
and
a
drive
connection
from
one
axle
to
something
later
getting
complicated
already
were
only
a
few
pieces
in
and
we
already
have
three
separate
gear
trains
going
on
theres
the
axle
driving
the
tan
beveled
gears
inside
the
frame
at
the
bottom
theres
more
tan
gears
in
the
middle
and
theres
also
a
black
gear
sticking
up
as
a
knob
that
turns
the
grey
connector
in
the
center
the
body
is
done
i
skipped
ahead
quite
a
bit
but
it
was
a
bunch
of
standard
technic
building
youve
got
a
fake
engine
with
fan
at
the
back
driven
by
one
of
the
rear
wheels
a
knob
sticking
up
for
steering
and
an
axle
coming
forward
to
open
and
close
the
claw
the
claw
i
like
that
they
used
a
link
system
to
open
and
close
the
claw
instead
of
just
gearing
it
the
axle
comes
forward
from
the
chassis
its
the
red
axle
with
a
couple
ujoints
for
flexibility
and
drives
a
worm
gear
that
rotates
a
gear
below
with
a
2
stud
liftarm
on
each
side
those
arms
have
pin
with
towball
in
them
and
then
a
link
going
from
that
short
liftarm
to
the
claw
its
a
small
rotation
of
the
liftarm
but
makes
the
claw
open
widely
and
works
very
well
raising
the
claw
a
few
black
liftarms
join
the
claw
to
the
body
of
the
loader
and
allow
it
to
move
up
and
down
its
a
simple
mechanism
there
one
yellow
beam
goes
back
and
connects
to
a
lever
that
lets
you
raise
and
lower
the
claw
when
raised
as
shown
the
lever
locks
in
place
by
going
just
slightly
past
the
centerline
and
its
done
add
some
wheels
a
cab
and
some
wheel
arches
and
were
done
its
a
great
looking
machine
pretty
unique
and
looks
like
the
real
thing
the
main
difference
from
reality
is
these
usually
have
a
scoop
for
moving
loose
rock
since
weve
had
so
many
scooping
vehicles
in
the
past
tracked
loaders
the
volvo
l350f
excavators
etc
the
claw
here
is
a
fun
change
and
adds
to
the
playability
for
kids
like
the
real
thing
the
body
stays
very
low
so
the
cab
only
has
to
stick
up
a
little
bit
for
the
driver
to
see
all
around
because
mines
are
cramped
and
busy
areas
from
the
rear
this
angle
is
great
i
love
the
use
of
the
new
mudguard
panels
to
make
a
nice
curve
to
the
back
of
the
loader
the
antenna
is
a
little
weird
but
perhaps
they
had
a
big
pile
of
flat
silver
fencing
swords
to
use
up
the
black
gear
just
to
the
left
of
the
antenna
is
the
claw
control
rotating
that
gear
opens
and
closes
it
the
back
end
is
a
little
lighter
than
a
real
machine
would
be
but
lego
wanted
to
leave
the
engine
exposed
so
you
can
see
the
cylinders
moving
the
conclusion
so
whats
my
conclusion
on
this
model
i
like
it
a
lot
its
simpler
than
a
big
set
would
be
but
its
got
lots
of
design
and
playability
crammed
in
a
midsized
set
its
a
unique
vehicle
however
it
does
have
a
few
flaws
the
steering
on
the
main
model
needs
some
drag
added
as
is
you
basically
have
to
drive
by
holding
the
steering
knob
since
itll
bend
if
you
push
it
from
behind
i
dont
like
the
use
of
pin
with
pin
hole
as
mounting
points
for
the
orange
and
red
trans
plates
for
lights
since
they
can
turn
slightly
and
be
at
weird
angles
the
antenna
is
unnecessary
and
in
the
way
but
none
of
these
flaws
are
dealbreakers
or
even
big
deals
theyre
minor
the
ratings
value
1010
less
than
10
cents
a
piece
lots
of
useful
liftarms
and
such
nothing
too
weird
or
singleuse
design
910
looks
very
realistic
for
the
size
of
the
set
good
functionality
not
too
dependent
on
stickers
minifigs
na
na
playability
910
controls
arent
perfect
loose
steering
small
knob
for
claw
control
but
very
functional
and
cleverly
done
parts
910
nice
selection
although
heavy
on
the
standard
yellow
and
black
almost
zero
studded
parts
overall
9510
its
a
great
intro
to
technic
set
a
unique
vehicle
good
functionality
nice
part
selection
and
decently
priced
i
like
it
a
lot
and
plan
to
keep
it
around
as
a
finished
set
excellent
review
worth
waiting
for
the
set
itself
is
very
interesting
looks
like
it
may
have
one
interesting
build
techniques
thanks
for
the
review
andy
ad
think
this
is
the
only
1h
set
ill
be
getting
guess
im
waiting
for
2h
for
the
rest
of
the
construction
stuff
this
set
looks
okay
to
me
it
includes
the
instructions
for
both
models
which
is
cool
and
includes
some
great
parts
i
like
that
its
not
just
another
bucket
loader
and
that
it
actually
tries
something
different
too

great
review
and
great
pictures
many
thanks
for
talking
the
time
to
review
this
set
i
am
a
fan
of
lego
technic
construction
stuff
but
this
set
is
not
so
appealing
to
me
but
then
again
i
am
sure
some
people
will
love
it
indeed
very
good
review
and
also
good
points
pointed
out
by
mlonger
this
set
doesnt
appealing
to
me
neither
but
before
i
knew
what
it
was
i
was
thinking
it
was
interesting
but
now
its
so
simple
a
set
close
to
500
pieces
with
only
1
real
function
and
the
entire
rear
section
looks
unfinished
definately
a
quirky
set
i
think
id
have
prefered
a
bucket
on
the
front
with
a
complex
lift
and
tip
mechanism
but
a
grab
is
different
as
for
the
b
model
i
may
prefer
its
functions
to
the
a
model
certainly
something
different
we
have
not
seen
before
great
review
indeed
looks
like
its
using
the
z60
turntable
thats
on
the
mercedes
and
the
crawler
crane
42042
i
have
made
a
ldd
file
of
a
improved
version
again
great
review
with
superb
pictures
the
white
and
blue
certainly
works
very
well
with
your
dark
backdrop
thorough
review
for
such
a
small
model
small
in
size
but
great
as
a
set
tell
me
why
did
i
let
you
review
this
one
quote
and
the
dumbingdown
continues
now
they
have
to
show
people
to
compare
axle
lengths
to
the
11
prints
on
the
page
that
have
always
been
there
but
how
does
the
11
work
on
the
app
might
have
to
look
into
that
for
the
record
i
pulled
out
my
phone
and
tried
to
find
the
app
in
the
google
store
couldnt
find
it
so
then
i
went
to
the
lego
website
shown
on
the
page
and
it
had
a
link
to
it
turns
out
it
wasnt
showing
up
because
its
tablet
only
so
google
wasnt
showing
it
to
me
on
my
phone
ill
try
again
later
with
a
tablet
funny
thing
is
that
they
changed
colour
of
7l
axle
to
yellow
and
on
that
picture
it
still
is
in
lbg
excellent
review
i
am
glad
that
you
did
not
rush
this
or
the
mine
loader
review
could
it
be
that
the
fan
in
the
back
is
like
a
turbo
prop
propulsion
just
reaching
here
andy
d
thank
you
for
the
review
i
have
this
one
in
my
pile
to
build
i
wish
there
was
more
of
the
curved
blue
panels
though
great
review
im
a
bit
undecided
on
the
set
though
it
has
some
nice
parts
4
cil
engine
in
such
a
small
set
and
it
looks
good
but
also
a
bit
small
and
simple
not
sure
if
it
stands
up
to
the
standards
of
the
small
tracked
loader
or
similar
for
sets
of
this
size
and
as
a
parts
pack
for
panelsflaxles
the
display
team
jet
is
infinitely
better
ill
probably
pick
one
up
but
right
now
i
really
want
another
tracked
loader
last
one
was
sacrificed
to
the
mod
gods
great
review
i
bought
this
model
several
weeks
ago
and
the
box
has
sat
on
my
shelf
so
i
think
after
this
i
will
be
digging
it
out
for
christmas
and
i
expect
my
son
will
have
a
lot
of
fun
with
it
when
its
built
ps
these
tumbler
tyres
look
amazing
on
this
model
and
indeed
amazing
in
their
own
right
you
switched
the
sides
for
the
panel
with
the
unsymmetrical
sticker
otherwise
you
would
see
that
the
cut
off
part
is
where
theres
a
beam
in
front
of
the
panel
thats
probably
done
because
the
beam
could
possibly
damage
the
sticker
either
while
building
or
while
placed
against
it
for
a
long
time
or
its
simply
omitted
because
it
wouldnt
be
completely
visible

this

looking
at

sheet
i
also
believe
they
simply
didnt

the

on

for
a
symmetrical
solution
a

could
have

excellent
review
jim
than
you
for
not
skipping
this
small
but
pretty
great
set
i
also
got
two
of
this
and
i
have
to
say
i
really
admire
the
nifty
suspension
building
a
third
bodywork
for
the
same
suspension
system
is
still
on
my
backlog
the
suspension
is
indeed
awesome
for
its
size
this
is
a
great

looking
at
the
grades
i
seem
to
have
lowballed

is
the
reviewfor
broadsides
brig
6259
a
set
from
1991
with
a
handsome
count
of
64
pieces
3
figures
and
a
sale
price
of
875
the
buildingand
parrot
well
start
off
with
the
front
it
looks
like
a
good
solid
building
to
hold
those
scurvy
dogs
we
yonder
over
to
the
left
side
and
see
a
nice
open
back
and
yonder
to
the
plain
right
side
back
to
the
left
we
find
the
corner
with
a
nice
area
to
rest
your
tired
soldiers
we
see
the
platform
in
the
corner
a
lovely
place
for
soldiers
to
stand
on
its
a

so
watch
your

the
middle
is
blocked
by
some
stones
assuring
security
but
still
open
enough
to
stand
in
the
jail
is
cramped
and
fits
only
two
people
but
we
only
need
one
prisoner
in
this

moving
up
is
the

assortment
of
weapons
that
concludes
our
review
overall
its
a
fantastic
little
set
and
great
for
army
and
supplies
and
bricks
gathering
i
cant
find
any
faults
with
this
set
its
just
the
neatest
little
thing
youve
seen
in
a
port
wub
highly
recomended
y
and
to
end
our
review
a
comic
a
fine
little
set
with
64
pieces
and
3
figures
for
under
10
may
have
seemed
a
bit
steep
in
1991
but
i
wouldnt
know
id
passed
into
my
dark
ages
already
so
alas
i
havent
a
copy
of
this
set
looking
at
the
parts
list
i
could
build
one
out
of
my
current
inventory
though
issued
today
for
10
id
buy
no
less
than
14
of
them
even
though
it
does
lack
the
obligatory
rowboat
for
the
pirate
to
make
his
escape
in
very
nice
review
and
comic
thanks
for
doing
them

there

really
like
them
but
there
neat
not
my
thing
but
a
very
nice
review
thanks
for
sharing
it
i
was
seriously
considering
this
one
when
it
was
originally
announced
as
a
6212
copack
item
at
a
particularly
good
price
and
then
everything
changed
i
do
however
seriously
ache
to
get
my
hands
on
one
of
the
more
traditionally
lego
looking
2ft
vaders
they
use
in
the
official
stores
at
least
they
had
one
here
in
orlando
wub
nice
review
hows
the
head
made
attached
to
the
body
is
there
also
a
boba
fett
maquette
if
y
please
a
pic
thanks
while
it
isnt
my
style
it
looks
pretty
cool
thanks
for
sharing
sweet
if
you
have
other
heads
and
other
lightsaber
blades
yes
during
the
annual
thanksgiving
road
trip
to
the
relatives
i
stopped
by
the
tru
in
portland
or
lo
and
behold
the
new
mars
mission
sets
obviously
i
bought
them
the
box
not
much
to
say
standard
box
art
for
mm
sets
nothing
new
the
parts
some
good
parts
here
even
if
you
dont
like
the
set
which
i
highly
doubt
after
ive
had
my
say
p
its
a
decent
parts
pack
i
noticed
that
some
old
parts
have
been
renewed
i
know
the
wheel
has
been
used
in
the
07
sets
but
the
cockpit
and
hitch
i
havent
seen
in
a
while
the
vldss
very
large
dss
grr
new
part
at
least
i
think
it
is
someone
slap
me
if
it
isnt
wacko
the
figs
i
know
ive
seen
that
head
before
but
i
have
no
idea
where
does
anyone
know
i
was
hoping
that
the
aliens
would
have
new
arms
at
least
i
was
sadly
mistaken
on
the
upside
i
finally
discovered
that
they
glow
in
the
dark
the
alien
has
a
jetpack
if
thats
not
the
silliest
thing
ive
ever
seen
i
dont
know
what
is
the
build
simple
build
a
block
so
easy
a
caveman
cou
oh
never
mind
geicos
used
that
one
enough
then
we
have
this
jobber
right
here
not
sure
what
it
is
but
it
looks
like
some
crystal
scanning
device
its
starting
to
look
pretty
nice
it
almost
looks
practical
the
cockpit
is
suffering
from
a
bad
dose
of
overstickering
on
the
upside
we
have
a
new
piece
there
to
hold
the
cockpit
on
part
1
complete
it
has
a
nice
little
radio
antenna
which
is
ruined
by
the
use
of
a
random
missile
that
looks
like
its
going
to
shoot
the
antenna
before
it
shoots
the
alien
still
i
never
say
no
to
a
good
missile
i
can
use
for
something
else
the
trailer
fairly
simple
but
it
works
it
features
stabilizing
arms
a
handheld
saw
and
an
extremely
random
minibot
whos
purpose
escapes
me
the
whole
meal
deal
erm
general
pics
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
set
in
fact
it
reminds
me
of
this
cool
review
thanks
d
i
personally
think
the
minirobot
is
awesome
and
dare
i
say
cute
this
was
described
on
amazon
to
be
a
mobile
lab
im
not
seeing
that
i
do
however
see
a
crystal
hauling
vehicle
sweet
pretty
cool
not
as
bad
as
previous
sets
peace
very
cool
im
getting
this
one
as
soon
as
its
in
america
well
maybe
depends
on
how
much
money
i
have
i
got
most
of
the
sets
from
07
theyre
pretty
cool

still
will

this
set
speechless

it

not
actually
a
bad
set
not
high
on
my
to

definitely
a

somewhere
down

im
not
sure
it
would

dive
when
transforming
from

i
guess
it
would
pick
up
speed
and
transform
quickly
since
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
any
downwards
pointing
thrusters
the
one
thing
youd
have
to
make
sure
of
though
is
that
it
was
fairly
light
and
the
wheel
base
had
a
fairly
large
surface
area
actually
thats
two
things
so
as
to
make
sure
it
didnt
dig
into
the
soil
if
that
happened
transformation
would
be
harder
as
the
wheels
would
dig
into
the
ground
and
drag
through
the
soil
then
itd
nose
dive
great
review
mr
mandalorian
y
im
not
a
fan
of
mm
and
dont
like
this
set
much
but
it
has
some
neat
features
but
the
only
way
i
can
see
it
transforming
is
by
racing
off
a
cliff
and
swinging
its
wings

yeah
it
does
look
quite
slow
and
tanklike
it
is
a
shame
lego
didnt
make
a
more
obvious
way
shoving
what
goes
on
you
mean
the
ungainly
way
in
which
the
wheels
have
to
turn
in

to
change
from
tank
mode
i
think
you
are
right
as
well
on
the
other
hand
if
it
has
antigrav
then
it
doesnt
really
make
sense
to
have
wheels
as
well
i
mean
if
the
power
goes
then
the
wheels
cant
turn
anyways
it
must
have
antigrav
otherwise
none

great
review
as
always
hinckley
frankly
im
in
love
with
this
thing
so
much
so
in
fact
that
ive
been
calling
it
shadow
panther
for
weeks
but
never
mind
anyway
why
do
i
like
it
well
purple
is
such
a
fantastic
lego
colour
its
sparingly
used
which
makes
it
interesting
and
it
simply
looks
great
those
jetpackbackpack
things
the
robots
are
wearing
and
if
they
are
jetpacks
as
the
back
of
the
box
suggests
then
the
use
of
chaisaws
is
quite
nifty
and
innovative
the
minibot
is
cool
and
certainly
an
interesting
gimmick
sure
they
dont
look
quite
as
good
in
some
of
the
other
sets
but
here
it
looks
great
the
overall
structure
and
design
are
cool
too
its
always
nice
to
see
an
irregular
mech
and
this
is
no
exception
its
especially
cool
whee
the
spines
are
concerned
plus
on
top
of
all
that
its
got
a
nice
selection
of
parts
including
some
lovely
new
ones
and
the
inlaid
box
is
interesting
well
worth
getting
i
think
dont
forget
bianca

truly
another
excellent
review
the
pictures
are
absolutely
splendid

pieces
were
done
so
well
while
i
remain
skeptical
about
the
new
giant
spikes
youve
sold
me
on
this
set
i
cant

to
see
the

your

this
designers
were
on
a
roll
with
this
one
until
it
came
to
the
flying
unit
it
looks
like
a
shambles
epecially
the
guns
looking
rather
simplistic
although
they
used
something
similar
to
the
light
and
sound
globe
peice
which
is
kind
of
neat
i
dont
think
ill
be
buying
this
but
your

almost
talked
me
into
it

my

actually
i
did
feel
the
same
way
you
did
about
the
flying

until
i
put
sinner
in
it

started
to
play
heres
a
sneak
peek
of
the
comic
and
a
cool
feature
of
ryos
shipit
can
be
configured
in
a
lot
of
different
ways
this
one
is
much
better
than
i
thought
i
didnt
expect
the
gun
and
the
turret
to
be
geared
i
agree
that
a
lot
of
the
details
sux
hollow
inside
lame
cockpits
but
as
an
overall
package
it
looks
quite
good
the
best
part
is
no
shooter
is
the
nightmare
finally
over
the
bonus
robot
is
a
much
better
idea
the
large
amount
of
blue
pieces
make
this
a
must
buy
for
me
as
impartial
needs
more
raw
materials
p
how
well
do
the
tracks
work
the
last

was

light
and
it

awesome
set

the

used

gavin
jifel
yes
they
did
sweet
i
like
using
me
and
sinner
better
though
i
have
put
fabuland
housewives
on
the
back
burner
for
a
while
but
plan
to
revive
it
for
the
first
season
conclusion
in
january
its
nice
to
see
that
there
are
people
who
really
follow
it
out
there
thanks
hinkley
you
are
the
man
your
reviews
just
keep
on
getting
better
and
better
although
all
of
the
sets
this
year
are
great
and
i
love
them
all
to
bits
i
cant
say
there
was
one
that
i
absolutely
felt
like
something
id
buy
except
for
the
storm
lasher
but
with
this
review
i
think
this
will
be
the
first
purchase
of
2008
for
me
i
totally
agree
with
you
on
how
the
spider
looks
better
without
minirobot
but
from
looking
at
where
the
cockpit
is
placed
and
how
the
skull
on
the
cockpit
is
lodged
underneath
the
walker
maybe
the
minirobot
would
look
better
mounted
underneath
the
head
that
way
it
looks
more
even
and
even
gives
the
thing
a
nasty
set
of
teeth
i
got
ta
try
it
out
once
i
get
it
cant
wait
for
the
fabuland
comics
keep
it
up
hink
oh
i
just
wub
theat
minibot
creepy
but
strangely
cute
nice
piece
selection
and
the
idea
of
something
with
rotors
that
double
up
as
cutters
storming
no
pun
intended
through
the
jungle
ripping
it
apart
is
just
fantastic
to
me
anyway
im
liking
the
new
swords
as
rotors
blades
thats
pretty
innovative
and
the
exhaust
pipe
pieces
are
intriguing
nice

the
top
of
the
tower
is
rather
plain
and
simple
which
in
some
ways
is
good
as
it
keeps
the
whole
set
detailed
yet
not
crowded
but
i
feel
a
little
something
should
of
been
added
to
the
top
though
perhaps
a
catapult
steve
its
a
nice
set
i
would
not
mind
owning
one
just
for
the
minifigs
and
cannon
the
base
plate
is
pretty
cool
as
well
nice
review
i
gave
it
a
4
out
of
5

im
going
to
have
to
start
dodging
cannon
balls
soon
if
i
dont
start
making
some
pirate
mocs
pirate
anywayz
ive
had
my
shell
service
station
set
6378
built
exactly
by
the
book
and
sitting
around
for
the
longest
time
with
the
recent
twinning
of
my
town
with
dr
sinister
i
needed
a
gas
station
that
could
handle
a
lot
more
traffic
especially
military
traffic
and
these
new
6wide
vehicles
xd
here
be
a
thumblink
to
the
original
station
at
bl
i
love
this
station
so
much
but
it
really
needed
some
modernization
the
reopening
of
this
station
received
a
lot
of
attention
even
the
local
police
stopped
right
over
one
big
upgrade
to
this
station
is
the
selling
of
propane
tanks
which
is
generally
a
rare
commodity
from
the
lego
towns
ive
seen
xd
also
at
this
service
station
is
a
propane
tank
refilling
station
the
milkman
is
our
first
propane
customer
the
interior
has
also
had
an
addition
and
many
upgrades
for
instance
this
building
now
has
florescent
lighting
a
big
frig
in
the
back
and
more
shelf
space
y
oh
look
theres
the
officer
purchasing
a
mountain
dew
now
that
theres
more
shelf
space
we
can
sell
more
than
just
1x1
round
yellow
bricks
and
levers
we
now
have
available
1x1
round
plates
and
1x1
round
cones
available
in
multiple
colors
d
with
this
upgraded
gas
station
hopefully
this
town
will
bring
in
more
business
and
customers
into
my
small
town
xd
p
i
really
love
everything
you
did
with
this
gas
station
it
looks
very
cozy
amazing
how
you
said
you
built
it
by
the
book
does
that
mean
you
didnt
have
the
set
but
you
used
your
own
pieces
to
rebuild
the
thing
the
flourescent
lighting
is
genius
and
the
interior
space
looks
just
like
what
youd
see
at
those
little
shops
i
really
dig
the
moc
it
gives
me
good
ideas
and
now
i
want
a
gas
station
of
my
own
p
and
the
history
behind
how
it
was
rebuilt
and
how
it
will
improve
business
etc
is
so
cool

of
the

thanks
oh
and
the
inside
too
pleese
sweet
lol
those
star
wars
heiroglyphics
are
awesome
were
those
in
the
movie
or
is
this
just
a
joke
by
the
lego
designers
that
would
be
the
first
time
tlc
showed
any
kind
of
reference
humor
the
rest
of
the
set
is
great
too
even
the
skeleton
and
the
stickers
yes
thats
right
i
actually
like
those
things
i
like
the
new
skellies
because
of
their
posability
im
a
big
supporter
user
of
stopmotion
and
i
think
theres
nothing
wrong
with
stickers
i
mean
seriously
why
does
everybody
hate
stickers
so
much
sure
they
are
a
pain
in
the
megablocks
to
put
on
and
sure
they
come
off
after
a
while
and
are
never
usable
again
but
hey
you
dont
have
to
put
them
on
even
better
you
can
save
them
like
i
do
and
use
them
for
your
mocs
could
somebody
tell
me
please
im
just
curious
however
as
i
said
nice
set
i
might
even
get
one
got
ta
love
that
marion
with
the
carot
torch
xd
and
that
arc
is
neat
too
by
the
way
are
all
parts
on
it
golden
some
more
pics
on
it
would
be
nice
as
soon
as
your
camera
is
recharged
thanks
peace
out
this
and
motorcycle
chase
were
the
two
sets
ive
wanted
from
the
start
i
like
how
you
get
lots
of
snakes
and
ill
add
my
snakes
in
too
for
a
brickfilm
sometimes
i
like
the
stickers
but
all
my
world
city
ones
got
hard
and
fell
off
i
like
the
r2d2
could
you
take
a
pic
of
any
hieroglyphics
in
this
setnot
the
ones
on
the
sticker
sheet
thanks
i
want
to
decode
them
my
2nd
review
what
a
veteran
again
found
this
set
via
a
shop
assistant
in
my
local
tru
portsmouth
uk
this
evening
comes
in
at
4499
which
is
pretty
steep
but
you
get
quite
a
bit
for
your
money
front
of
the
box
back
of
the
box
back
of
the
box
closeup
contents
it
was
a
nice
surprise
to
get
numbered
bags
not
had
a
large
set
with
numbered
bags
for
quite
a
while
at
least
in
none
of
the
sets
ive
bought
recently
didnt
take
a
close
up
of
the
stickers
but
i
was
quite
disappointed
that
the
curved
pieces
had
stickers
if
they
could
print
the
att
curved
pieces
why
not
these
minifigs
oh
and
theres
a
nice
backprint
on
the
pilot
figure
now
the
build
was
pretty
good
you
build
the
plane
first
after
the
minifigures
quite
an
interesting
build
in
a
way
becayse
for
a
while
you
think
the
back
is
the
front
and
then
you
realise
heh
now
ive
not
seen
the
film
in
a
while
but
i
dont
recall
a
guy
flying
a
plane
with
a
fishing
rod
dont
flame
me
if
this
is
what
happens
see
earlier
point
regards
not
seeing
the
film
in
ages
p
after
that
you
build
the
temple
in
stages
starting
with
the
entrance
first
and
then
the
holey
floor
section
with
the
spears
these
spears
are
just
loosely
placed
into
technic
holed
bricks
quite
easy
to
make
em
flick
out
but
they
can
go
anywhere
hehe
entrance
holey
floor
spears
these
two
parts
are
hinged
and
on
an
angle
to
each
other
and
the
gap
makes
for
a
handy
bottomless
pit
complete
with
pole
for
indy
to
swing
over
with
his
whip
after
that
you
create
the
door
and
the
ratchet
mechanism
to
keep
it
raised
after
that
you
add
the
runners
for
the
ball
and
the
swinging
knives
trap
swords
trap
before
after
finally
you
build
the
statue
that
holds
the
efigy
nice
bit
of
construction
here
especially
the
way
that
everything
falls
over
once
the
efigy
is
removed
do
be
careful
when
putting
the
curved
bits
on
though
it
appears
one
of
the
edges
on
mine
has
slightly
bent
when
putting
it
on
nowt
noticable
though
temple
preparing
to
steal
run
you
can
see
that
the
temple
has
toppled
and
debris
has
fallen
all
around
and
then
as
he
goes
through
the
door
the
door
falls
he
gets
his
hat
and
then
the
rock
ball
starts
a
rolling
ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun
the
stickers
were
a
pain
though
theres
no
room
for
a
border
around
the
sticker
here
beware
after
all
that
is
done
you
join
all
the
pieces
together
and
it
makes
more
a
really
good
playset
plenty
of
opportunity
for
recreating
scenes
here

the
fact
i
dont

need
it
good
to
see
how
everything
works
but
those
damn
stickers
i
just
noticed
another
inconsistency
between
box
art
and
the
actual
set
on
the
box
the
biplan
has
white
wing
supports
theyre
just
plane
windows
without
glass
in
them
and
yet
the
set
they
are
dark
grey
or
is
it
bley
can
never
tell
the
difference
without
careful
study
add
to
that
the
outer
of
the
engine
at
the
front
is
white
on
the
box
and
black
in
the
set
we
dont
normally
have
this
many
inconsistencies
do
we
this
set
is
so
cool
and
another
must
buy
im
in
trouble
next
year
it
seems
the
figs
are
great
wub
i
think
the
plane
is
only
ok
perhaps
they
should
have
made
that
in
a
separate
set
as
it
needed
to
be
a
certain
size
to
fit
the
figs
but
that
meant
that
the
tail
is
way
too
short
here
is
a
picture
of
the
actual
plane
so
you
can
see
what
i
mean
notice
the
pilot
is
fishing
the
temple
is
another
story
i
think
lego
have
done
an
incredible
job
with
this
fitting
in
the
key
parts
of
this
sequence
without
making
an
absurdly
large
model
addtionally
there
are
many
parts
in
this
set
that
i
havent
got
so
it
shouldnt
be
too
hard
to
justify
xd
thanks
for
another
great
review

we
quite
annoying
ones
too
i
think
the
plane
looks
better
with
those
being
white
because
of
exams
and
other
obligations
i
havent
posted
this
sooner
seeing
that
noone
else
has
reviewed
this
set
i
thought
i
might
as
well
do
it
myself
the
set
in
its
entire
glory
minus
the
slammer
instructions
and
the
obviously
massive
sticker
sheet
the
four
cars
included
in
this
set
a
muscle
car
a
sports
car
a
roadster
and
the
police
offroader
because
the
police
obviously
have
no
clue
that
an
offroader
is
useless
for
catching
streetracers
no
less
a
batmobileish
sports
car
it
will
always
trail
behind
but
the
police
have
a
trick
up
their
sleeve
the
drawbridge
gotcha
and
the
mechanism
that
makes
it
all
tick
the
motor
is
nothing
more
than
a
slow
pullback
motor
push
down
the
bridge
the
latch
will
hook
on
to
the
gear
and
keep
it
in
place
until
the
latch
is
released
and
theres
the
new
gas
station
staying
within
theme
this
gasstation
is
like
the
tanker
in
8147
from
the
company
fuel
4
speed
theres
a
notable
presence
of
detail
here
such
as
the
sodadispenser
water
coolant
bottles
and
other
accesories
two
fuel
pumps
and
bumperlevel
railings
to
prevent
cars
from
crashing
into
them
theres
no
interior
however
and
as
demonstrated
here
by
a
loyal
octanemployee
and
a
pursuing
officer
the
gas
station
is
built
to
minifigscale
my
impressions
of
this
set
as
a
collector
of
tiny
turbos
and
yet
to
miss
a
set
i
got
this
one
regardless
of
what
it
included
the
gas
station
is
indeed
very
nice
and
the
minifigscale
accesories
were
unexpected
the
lack
of
interior
is
no
big
issue
and
the
both
the
station
and
bridge
can
with
ease
be
implemented
into
a
minifig
town
the
bridge
also
solidly
built
and
includes
the
ramps
in
its
design
so
it
can
be
lifted
with
ramps
attached
without
breaking
apart
the
slammer
included
in
the
set
is
identical
apart
from
the
white
color
with
those
in
8147
the
cars
are
also
very
nice
altough
i
am
yet
to
get
used
to
the
yellow
batmobile
as
ive
grown
accustomed
to
calling
it
i
also
love
the
offroaders
chunky
tires
they
make
perfect
wheels
for
the
newer
minifigscale
cars
i
never
consider
priceparts
ratio
and
here
it
would
for
me
be
irrelevant
because
it
will
never
be
demolished
for
parts
the
play
value
is
what
i
would
consider
pretty
good
and
while
the
bridge
wont
rise
with
a
car
on
it
its
still
strong
enough
to
stay
open
with
a
car
tipping
over
the
edge
hmm
every
nerve
in
my
body
is
saying
that
this
sets
is
worth
roughly
810
so
verdict
810

wacko
thanks
for
the
very
thorough

good
but
i
see
they
didnt
include
the
new
4x4x13
circle
piece
ah
well
did
you
seebuy
any
other
impulse
sets
peace
i
tink
its
better
if
you
resize
the
pics
before
uploading
to
ur
brickshelf
account
picasa2
is
a
good
tool
to
resize
ur
pics
use
the
export
function
anyway
nice
review
looks
like
i
will
be
getting
all
of
the
city
impulse
sets
except
for
the
fire
fighter
one
maybe
more
of
those
large
bin
sets
heh
thanks
for
the

it
possible
if
you
scan
the

of

d
thanks
for
the
review
brickmaster
this
set
looks
nice
i
really
like
the
orange
wub
and
white
colour
scheme
although
the
purple
of
the
lom
base
was
very
cool
too
i
only
have
the
lom
base
if
you
have
it
built
could
you
show
a
comparison
on
an
unrelated
note
by
the
time
i
realised
the
red
and
blue
hangers
on
the
lom
base
were
for
the
red
and
blue
mechs
the
mechs
were
no
longer
in
stores
i
was
a
bit
slow
huh
p
anywho
this
is
one
set
i
wont
be
buying
although
if
the
rocket
was
sold
separately
id
get
that
d
thanks
again

great
review

polizei
is
german
for

i
quite
like
it
but
i
feel
that
my
lego
city
is
getting
overrun
with
helicopters
and
planes
also
i
have
got
the
helicopter
from
the
7237
police
station
set
but
it
is
not
as
good
as
this
plus
iam
sooooo
dissapointed
that
the
x
stickers
x
are
blue
instead
of
black
and
green
as
they
will
not
fit
with
the
sets
i

i
think
this
is
a
very

little

but
the
biggest
reason
why
i
will
probably
get
this
is
for
the

are
the

good

i
enjoyed
seeing
this

nice
to
get
some
different
angles
on
the
components
sorry
to
disagree
with
anyone
however
but
this
was
not
a
great
review
i
appreciate
the
effort
sandra
made
but
a
great
review
would
include
more
details
such
as
what
are
stickers
and
what
are
printed
pieces
a
great
review
points
out
flaws
or
limitations
as
well
as
what
works
or
is
really
neat
a
great
review
would
have
analyzed
the
price
per
piece
and
compared
that
to
other
setsthemes
one
might
look
at
the
recent
reviews
of
the
indy
sets
or
the
new
spongebob
sets
as
examples
of
really
good
reviews
the
pictures
are
good
but
a
great
review
above
all
should
provide
the
reader
with
some
new
information
perhaps
even
answer
questions
posed
in
the
prerelease
discussion
thread
i
learned
nothing
new
about
the
set
from
this
review
that
said
it
was
a
good
review
for
someone
who
had
not
seen
the
prerelease
discussion
and
she
did
a
good
job
of
showing
said
person
what
they
could
expect
in
the

it

depends
on
what
you
are
after
kim
if
you
want
a
really
great
and
detailed
set
i
would
opt
for
the
cafe
corner
but
if
you
want
a
set
that
can
easilly
be
included
in
a
city
i
would
opt
for
town
plan
since
i
cant
afford
all
of
them
i
will
just
get
town
plan
because
i
lve
the
feeling
of
thge
set

definitely
the

corner
its
a
hard
desicion
between
coffee
corner
and
town
plan
because
they
are
both
really
great
sets
the
market
street
is
no
must
have
in
my
opinion
but
the
other
two
maybe
you
should
start
with
the
coffee
corner
its
the
older
set
the
town
plan
is
newer
and
will
be
available
longer
then
the
coffee
corner
i
hope
it
helped
you

i
was
fortunate
enough
to
get
one
along
with
the

train
they
are
the
first

i
have
ever
owned
mainly
by
virtue
of
them
having
been
half

its
a
fantastic
selection
of
parts
with
the
holiday
train
as
well

it
really
looking
the
part
as
a
set
im
happy
not
to
get
a
motor
as
i
think
the
9v
setup
would
prove
expensive
and
the

system
for
the

seems
a
bit
poor

got

review

thanks
for
sharing
i
wasnt
real
fond
of
the
postal
truck
at
first
its
so
different
than
those
in
the
us
but
after
seeing
your
closeup
images
esp
the
back
of
the
tuck
it
looks
really
neat
i
also
like
the
mail
box
a
lot
it
looks
good
in
red
too
bad
for
the
stickers
but
its
still
nice
the
plane
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
design
used
in
the
jurassic
park
set
as
youve
said
its
similar
to
80s
designs
i
really
like
the
brickbuilt
design
too
its
just
real
lego
thats
about
all
i
can
say
very
nice
sets
that
are
a
must
together
thanks
for
the
review
excellent
review
you
convinced
me
to
buy
these
two
could
you
tell
me
how
much
you
payed
for
them
i
think
im
gon
na
buy
them
tomorrow
if
they
have
it
already

if
i
dont
see
any
cooler
sets
nice
review

i
dont
think
i
have
ever
read
one
with
as
much
cursing
of
stickers
d
i
love
these
two
little
sets
the
colour
scheme
the
little
different
wheels
on
the
post
van
and
of
course
the
new
postmen
uniforms
would
have
been
nice
if
they
had
included
little
satchels
like
in
the
new
indiana
jones
sets
oh
well
postman
yoda
on
yoda
aww
man
is
tlc
really
getting
too
cheap
for
printed
parts
shame
on
you
tlc
despite
those
stickers
these
are
two
really
neat
sets
especially
the
airplane
classic
wub
reminds
me
of
that
little
plane
my
dad
bought
in
an
airplane
not
sure
whats
the
set
nr
the
window
at
the
rear
of
the
van
looks
like
a
normal
window
frame
without
the
clips
for
the
shutters
i
never
knew
those
existed

might
come
handy
for
ship

am
i
the

one
to

the

doors
used
in
the
back
of
the
van
not
only
is
it
using
the
popular
new
frame
but
the
old
container
doors
have
been
redesigned
to
fit
with
the
new
frame
as
well
pity
theyre
not
yellow
though
great
remark
there
i
guess
i
totally
missed
that
one
and
i
agree
that
yellow
doors
would
have
been
better
but
those
dark
bley
do
not

can
you
tell
me
though
the
wheels
on
the
van
are
they
rubber
or
plastic
they
look
a
bit
tacky
rubber
off
course
they
do
look
a
tad
tacky
but
its
because
they
are
the
thin
type
like
with
the
racers
and
i
am
not
a
fan
of
those

i
reckon
lego
could
enhance
this
subtheme
by
releasing
a
post
motorbike
with
or
without
a
sidecar
and
post
office
obviouly
the
office
would
be
the
hub
of
all
the
activity
while
the
post
bike
would
take
care
of
the
postal
run
this
would
free
up
the
van
to
take
or
recieve
bulk
mail
or
parcels
to
or
from
the
airport
it
could
then
also
do
the
parcel
deliveries
around
the
city
the
office
would
also
serve
as
the
reciever
for
all
the
parcels
the
new
goods
truck
might
deliver
so
true

at
one
point
i
was
thinking
of
a
impulse
set
with
a
yellow
bike
postman
post
and
letters
that
would
rock
i
hope
tlc
adds
to
this
sub
theme
and
keeps
that
retro
feel
wub
a
yellow
dirtbike
with
sidecar
would
be
a
sweet
5
set
also
a
small
town
feel
post
office
would
be
so
cool
like
a
2030
set
we
can
be
sure
of
one
thing
though
this
years
advent
calendar
will
have
a
postamn
and
small
post
office
post
on
yoda
thanks
for
the
review
i
was
actually
considering
getting
these
but
i
saw
they
were
overpriced
for
my
tastes
too
bad
theyre
nifty
lil
things
wub
well
first
off
thanks
yoda
for
the
great
review
hmmm
well
i
have
to
say
im
not
at
all
impressed
with
any
of
these
sets
i
mean
there
nice
and
all
but
the
van
just
seems
way
to
small
it
would
have
been
nice
if
you
could
fit
more
than
one
package
in
it
i
guessim
one
of
those
that
are
more
of
the
fan
of
the
6
wide
trucks
and
the
plane
hm
this
has
a
cute
factor
and
all
but
i
mean
comon
you
have
to
open
a
hatch
on
the
roof
to
get
your
packages
in
and
what
about
getting
them
out
you
have
to
flip
the
plane
upside
down
weak
they
should
have
had
a
hinged
rear
end
or
a
hatch
on
the
side

yoda
for
your

those

sets
will
be
mine
but
i
will

to
find
them
in
my
supermarket
even
if
i
have
to
wait
2
or
3
months
i
know
that
i
will
save
some
money
so
i
will
buy
more
lego
d
there
are
simple
designed
sets
but
we
dont
need
more
two
nice
litle
sets
that
are

i
wasnt
real
fond
of
the
postal
truck
at
first
its
so
different
than
those
in
the
us
good
point
b
this
design
is
just
too
foreign
to
my
eyes
for
me
to
enjoy
i
dont
like
either
of
these
sets
very
disapointing
the
postal
theme
has
so
much
potential
i
dont
really
like
the
torsos
either
too
plaincheap
as
kanal
suggested
and
i
will
agree
that
the
wheels
on
the
van
look
cheap
i
was
sooooo
impressed
with
city
2007
this
is
a
real
let
down
though
i
am
happy
to
see
a
small
set
with
a
postal
box
so
even
though
all
that
aside
ill
probably
buy
6
of
the
van
just
for
the
yellow
mudgards
postal
box
and
stickers
to
populate
my
city
and
i
think
this
set
will
provide
some
excellent
piece
to
moc

nevertheless
my
personal
preference
is
for
smaller
classic

city

the
mail
van
is
nice
and
small
and
should
fit
well
with
my

and
1990s
cars
from
the

note
did
anyone
notice
the
message
on
the

of
both
sets
boxes
designed
for
easy
building
and
instant
play
it
surprised
me
a
little
since
these
sets
seem
no
less
complex
than
any
other
city
set
of
late
they
look
like
quick
builds
sure
but
not
as
though
the
designers
went
out
of
their
way
to
simplify
them
thanks
for

the

looks
great

the

time
90
minutes
yet
another
interesting

theme
house
this
one
comes
fresh
of
the
2008
line
of
sets
and
promises
3
different
models
packing
522
pieces
albeit
a
lot
of
1x1
plates
for
only
2995
it
was
hard
to
pass
this
one
by
as
i
was
foraging
for
the
new
2008
star
wars
sets
at
the
local
target
plus
i
was
itching
to
do
another
review
since
i
had
finally
fully
recovered
from
my
marathon
ucs
falcon
review
which
took
the
better
part
a
month
to
complete
the
box
the
box
is
pretty
standard
creator
type
box
which
shows
off
the
three
models
beach
house
caf
and
towering
apartment
building
the
back
of
the
box
shows
some
of
the
features
of
the
three
models
interesting
features
of
the
three
models
prominently
displayed
on
the
back
include
food
counter
complete
with
coffee
espresso
maker
and
food
warmer
with
chicken
leg
home
office
complete
with
laptop
and
the
ubiquitous
coffee
cup
flip
up
roof
granting
access
inside
of
beach
house
note
the
satellite
tv
dish
and
even
rain
gutters
along
the
roofline
opening
the
box
is
a
matter
of
breaking
two
seals
were
back
to
the
reusable
cereal
box
type
tab
system
that
we
saw
so
often
in
2007
sets
note
the
parts
inventory
is
on
the
side
of
the
box
as
well
this
is
a
nice
feature
once
inside
the
box
we
are
greeted
by
eight
sealed
bags
plus
two
yellow
16x2
plates
and
a
green
32x16
baseplate
thank
goodness
there
is
no
dss
dreaded
sticker
sheet
but
alas
there
are
no
minifigs
in
addition
there
are
the
three
manuals
one
for
each
model
and
they
were
stuffed
into
my
box
with
the
care
of
kid
trying
to
put
10
gallons
or
liters
if
you
prefer
of
candy
in
a
5
gallon
bucket
but
hey
were
not
collecting
manuals
here
so
who
cares
if
the
manuals
are
all
bent
and
warped
the
manuals
the
three
manuals
are
74
72
and
48
pages
in
length
they
are
laid
out
well
and
are
pretty
standard
with
all
the
usual
trimmings
piece
call
outs
for
each
step
parts
inventory
at
the
end
of
the
primary
model
build
page
numbers
color
separation
in
these
manuals
were
fine
for
me
plus
we
get
the
usual
verbose
lego
instructions
on
not
dumping
all
your
pieces
outside
in
the
grass
and
not
to
dump
all
your
pieces
into
a
single
pile
thanks
for
the
tip
tlg
parts
list
the
pieces
pretty
standard
stuff
here
and
as
i
mentioned
lots
of
1x1
plates
and
tiles
at
least
100
however
we
do
get
quite
a
few
windows
and
a
couple
of
doors
a
majority
of
the
color
is
black
and
yellow
i
did
see
a
few
pieces
that
i
was
not
familiar
with
so
im
going
to
show
them
below
keep
in
mind
im
not
a
parts
jockey
so
bear
with
me
if
i
think
a
part
is
brand
new
for
2008
and
it
was
actually
released
with
the
classic
space
line
2x2
window
fixed
and
4x3
window
that
opens
the
follow
photo
shows
the
window
glass
same
as
in
corner
caf
door
glass
and
new
black
parts
turns
out
these
black
parts
are
used
as
wheels
i
showed
the
window
glass
because
it
still
contains
the
molding
circle
just
like
they
did
before
it
is
hard
to
see
from
the
photo
but
it
is
there
the
door
glass
i
think
might
be
new
i
dont
recall
seeing
these
2x2
round
plates
with
clips
before
and
i
thought
i
would
show
the
mail
only
because
it
is
printed
and
not
a
sticker
i
know
these
are
common
but
didnt
they
have
four
studs
on
top
these
only
have
two
how
about
this
sloped
4x3
window
that
opens
overall
a
nice
assortment
of
parts
with
nothing
juniorized
the
build
the
build
was
fun
and
was
fairly
straightforward
once
you
figure
out
which
of
the
three
models
to
build
it
goes
pretty
quick
here
are
a
few
shots
see
how
the
inside
is
made
look
at
the
detail
with
the
flowers
and
even
the
outside
water
faucet
outdoor
seating
area
upstairs
being
built
upstairs
with
opening
roof
notice
the
satellite
tv
dish
check
out
the
patio
on
the
upstairs
complete
with
outdoor
light
and
rain
gutters
heres
my
favorite
the
bbq
grill
at
least
we
know
where
those
new
parts
go
finally
check
out
the
tree
no
juniorization
here
here
is
what
is
left
over
so
far
i
have
only
built
the
primary
model
the
others
look
interesting
especially
the
caf
the
design
the
design
was
well
done
very
rich
in
detail
i
love
how
there
are
no
juniorized
parts
the
house
is
accessible
by
taking
off
the
top
floor
like
caf
corner
and
market
street
there
is
an
internal
staircase
as
well
there
is
no
interior
to
speak
of
in
the
beach
house
but
there
is
in
the
other
two
models
the
only
real
negative
is
that
it
is
kind
of
small
when
you
get
it
done
it
would
be
nice
if
it
was
about
50
bigger
here
are
a
few
views
of
the
beach
house
with
a
few
minifigs
thrown
in
check
out
the
closeup
of
the
caf
which
i
think
looks
great
also
here
is
a
photo
of
the
interior
of
the
apartment
building
where
you
can
see
the
office
and
computer
overall
thoughts
it
is
a
really
nice
set
a
tad
on
the
small
side
but
it
has
some
great
detail
and
lots
of
features
quick
enough
to
build
all
three
models
and
would
fit
real
nice
into
an
existing
town
plan
is
minifig
scale
but
does
not
come
with
any
lots
of
window
parts
and
black
slopes
is
a
nice
diversion
from
the
onslaught
of
clone
wars
ships
that
we
cant
remember
seeing
from
the
movies
final
rating
84
build
910
pretty
quick
and
fun
functionality
910
it
is
a
creator
set
so
you
have
multiple
varied
builds
diverse
enough
to
keep
the
kids
entertained
design
1010
excellent
and
well
thought
out
outstanding
detail
for
such
a
small
model
parts
610
fair
nothing
earthshattering
but
lots
of
slopes
and
windows
price
810
price
ratio
is
good
but
you
get
a
lot
of
little
parts
would
be
better
with
minifigs

even
in

city
airport
dont
worry
im
not
complaining
it
just
came
to
my

because
today
i
rebuild
my
7866
from
1983
which
had
2
of
these
babys

before
buying
even
if

are
really
not
mine
cup
of
tea
my
love
to
lego
is
firmly
frozen
somewhere
between
years
19801995
main
reason
to
buy
was
that
i
wanted
to
write
a
review
at
czech
afol
web
kostkyorg
i
bought
it
three
days
ago
via
web
advertising
price
was
35
usd
2
after
opening
the
box
as
presumed
some
very
big
parts
and
three
bags
and
as
an
additional
bonus
lot
of
danish
air
free
of
charge
first
sight
told
me
that
this
will
be
really
short
and
easy
building

impressions

building
and
it
was
really

minutes

lazy
building

bag
2
plane
gondols
with
supports
bag
3
wings
and
propellers
when
i
saw
the
way
how
is
this
plane
made
i
was
strongly
thinking
to
play
money
for
nothing
from
dire
straits
as
a
music
accordant
with
whole
set
4
impressions
after
building
lookout
juniorized
creeps
this
is
my
first
plane
in
this
scale
and
for
99
the
last
one
lack
of
details
lot
of
ugly
big
parts
from
whole
set
you
can
see
the
main
development
target
to
keep
rrp
at
some
certain
low
level
inner
space
of
airplane
absolutely
undone
no
details
no
luggage
no
computers
nothing
at
all
just
a
lot
lot
of
air
the
very
only
details
in
whole
plane
are
the
stickered
pilots
desk
and
some
kind
of
seat
constuction
5
impressions
after
building
playability
but
what
is
playability
at
this
set
hydroplane
which
can
not
float
as
seen
on
enclosed
photos
if
tlc
will
make
some
new
kind
of
big
parts
used
for
gondolas
to
make
the
plane
floating
they
will
for
sure
make
no
other
damage
juniorization
couldnt
be
higher
you
even
can
not
drive
across
the
carpet
with
the
plane
so
how
to
play
open
the
doors
open
the
cabin
part
and
turn
with
propellers
weak
weak
weak
6
resumed
impressions
sadly
i
must
say
that
at
limited
release
sets
tlc
boat
seems
to
sailing
to
the
worst
part
of
the
coast
after
quite
good
7344
perfect
7899
and
7900
strange
but
acceptable
7998
juniorization
came
back
with
7906
followed
with
this
ugly
playmobilized
7732
7
final
word
in
fact
even
15
usd
seems
to
be
too
much
for
this
kind
of
set
35
usd
expected
rrp
in
our
country
is
really
overpriced
to
hell
neither
set
nor
minifig
is
not
interesting
tlc
maybe
knows
about
juniorization
as
well
as
nowhere
on
the
box
the
number
of
pieces
isnt
written
if
you
my
afol
friends
want
to
spent
your
bucks
better
give
half
of
the
price
to
african
orphans
you
will
save
your
money
and
you
will
have
a
good
feeling
all
the
photos

ah
great
review
kanalk1
and
welcome
to
eb
d
i
was
waiting
for
one
of
this
set
not
that
i
was
expecting
anything
good
i
wont
buy
it
i
agree
with
thr
playability
it
does
seem
weak
what
can
you
do
with
it
swoosh
it
big
step
backwards
lego
dr
brick
i
think
this
is
one
to
leave
on
the
shelf
with
the
giant
dump
truck
of
2006
and
the
hovercraft
of
2007
i
have
the
big
passenger
plane
so
ill
be
passing
on
this
one
one
big
juniorised
plane
is
enough
for
me
if
i
didnt
have
the
passenger
plane
though
id
rather
get
the
cargo
plane
theres
enough
police
in
my
city
as
it
is

i
have
to
agree
with
almost
all
of
the
replies
here
that
this
set
is
the
most
ugliest
looking
lego
set
i
have
ever
seen
if
i
have
never
seen
this
set
and
ppl
showed
it
to
me
i
would
have
thought
it
would
be
some
little
kids
moc
or
something
no
offence
huge
juniorized
pieces
bad
color
theme
i
would
say
it
would
look
better
if
the
wing
is
white
no
interior
and
huge
dss
i
will
avoid
this
set
like
the
plague
i
own
the
entire
city
line
except
for
the
airport
and
planning
to
get
all
the
city
stuff
that
lego
releases
but
this
set
will
ruin
my
plans
coz
i
will
avoid
it
unless
someone
gives
it
to
me
for
free
haha
wacko
boo
lego
boo
x
ill
probably
get
the
nice
green
cargo
plane
but
not
this
how
can
the
same
hull
pieces
be
used
for
full
size
jets
and
whats
supposed
to
be
a
small
seaplane
what
i
dont
understand
is
what
sort
of
crime
this
seaplane
is
exactly
designed
to
fight
that
the
multitude
of
other
crimefighters
in
lego
city
cant
handle

which
is

considering

anyone

ace

thanks
for
that
vader
i
love
this
helmet
wub
it
will
certainly
work
great
as
an
asian
dynasty
war
helm
i
reckon
thanks
again
batbrick
is
back
yeah
its
alot
better
than
the
other
one
ill
have
to
buy
some
extra
ones
now
just
to
replace
the
old
ones
still
lets
hope
the
new
impulse
set
has
the
new
version
y
those
extra
helmet
pictures
just
seal
how
much
i
love
those
new
helmets
wub
they
look
so
great
thank
you
for
the
review
vader
that
set
looks
worth
buying
8
i
think
you
gave
me
a
good
reason
to
buy
it
great
review
vader
as
ive
said
before
this
is
a
nice
set
but
doesnt
really
come
with
anything
that
doesnt
come
with
the
other
sets
of
the
line
for
this
reason
it
will
be
somewhere
at
the
bottom
of
my
list
for
2008
also
i
like
torso
and
helmet
of
the
dwarf
mining
orcs
much
better
the
colours
make
the
torso
look
rather
dull
and
boring
while
the
other
more
brown
one
looks
much
clearer
and
more
exciting
i
think
i
like
the
knight
helmet
better
too
looks
more
covering
and
threatening
than
this
one
although
ill
save
my
judgement
until
i
have
one
in
my
hands
thanks
again

thanks
for
the
review
vader
very
clever
using
a
flag
to
hide
that
crazy
firing
device
i
find
it
rather
odd
they
used
blue
pins
for
this
black
or
gray
wouldve
been
alot
more
discrete
about
the
big
trolls
i
think
using
different
colours
is
good
i
dont
think
a
troll
force
would
be
very
organized
so
different
colours
would
make
the
effect
complete
y
as
for
your
troops
looks
quite
fearsome
definitely
compared
to
my
pathetic
number
of
soldiers
a
nice
set
but
i
would
rather
get
the
attack
on
tower
though
no
matter
about
the
price
difference
oh
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
the
dark
tan
troll
i
just
prefer
the
sand
green
one
your
right
about
trolls
not
being
organized
and
i
like
to
think
that
the
trolls
are
from
different
areas

heres
a
few
quick
shots
of
the
2
larger
trolls
we
have
so
far
i
prefer
the
sand
green
one
nice
comparison
shot
judging
from
these
pics
i
think
i
have
to
agree
with
you
that
green
suits
the
troll
better
especially
since
the
orcs
are
sand
green
as
well
indicating
some
relation
between
the
two
races
if
they
are
indeed
separate
races
great
review
very
detailed
and
with
lots
of
pictures
i
was
already
interested
in
this
set
but
after
reading
your
review
i
want
this
set
for
sure
y
tks
for
the
review
mate
now
i
have
to
bloody
wait
long
because
lego
france
has
this
line
available
in
freaking
march
pissed
yoda
on
d
i
love
the
new
goblin
p
that
helmet
is
really
cool
why
on
earth
tlc
didnt
include
that
one
in
the
dwarf
mine
such
another
idiotic
move
anyone
keeping
track
of
tlcs
stupidity
lately
that
would
be
interesting
i
clearly
want
a
huge
goblin
army
now
hehe
and
i
totally
agree
with
you
mate
the
troll
lokks
better
in
sand
green
the
cart
itself
is
pretty
lame
imo
just
a
sordid
excuse
to
include
yet
another
annoying
shooting
crappy
device
but
for
a
21
set
its
okie
i
say
need
my
bad
guys
on
yoda
the
forklift
is
amazing
and
nice
design
of
the
opening
side
doors
aswell
thanks
for
the

i
may
actually
pick
this

question
whats
different
with

the
main
difference
is
the
fact
that
the
box
says
special
edition

on
it
special

mean
that
its

the

is
a

exclusive
and
another
example
is
thr

crawler
is
exclusive

also
can
th
doors
be

on
either

the

good

nice
for
a
truck
like
this
yes
6wide
the
only
problem
with
these
big
trucks
is
how
they
look
on
the
city
roadplates
ive
always
thought
too
big
compared
to
classic
city
trucks
getting
off
topic
id
like
to
see
lego
make
a

transport
truck
i
dont

ive
ever
seen
one
in

it
would
definately
have
to
be
6wide

great
review
my
only
grip
with
this
set
is
you
can
only
fit
one
pallet
in
the
truck
it
should
have
been
the
same
size
as
the
trailer
so
you
can
at
least
fit
2
pallets
seems
like
alotof
wasted
space
if
im
going
to
transport
cargo
i
want
to
use
the
maximum
amount
of
space
aviable
xd
thats
a
fair
gripe
someone
else
mentioned
it
above
as
well
i
thought
the
same
thing
when
i
went
to
load
it
thats
fine
as
its
not
a
neccesity
and
thanks
for
the
piece

hmmthats
interesting
i
just
bricklinked
it
and
it

y
i
love
this

i

i
want
all
the

bits
in
a

as
well
nice
little
humorous

at

too
one
improvement
i

could

to

of
the

and
other

of
the

anyway
honestly
there
isnt

sometimes

view
of

to

no
one
seems
to
notice
so
its
okay
xd
and
i
didnt
include
pics
of
the
back

and
box
because
they
were
included
in
some
one
elses
knight

and
theres
no
change

i
will
include
them
in

in
case
someone
hasnt

we
have
two

already
done

that

its
just
expressing
my
opinions

sharing
my

giving

i

would
much
rather
have
a

right
you
are
i
dont
know
what
redman
was
thinking
p
hes
fixed
it
now
peace
well
since
noone
seems
to
have
done
one
for
this
set
here
we
go
heres
the
complete
set
in
all
its
glory
yes
i
really
like
it
but
then
tabletown
has
the
capacity
to
support
it
and
my
green
army
have
their
eyes
on
it
as
a
potential
military
transport
as
well
ill
start
out
with
the
little
airport
ground
car
thingy
very
neat
and
functional
here
are
views
front
and
back
next
up
the
steps
which
allow
the
plane
crew
to
embark
and
disembark
and
to
round
off
this
little
trio
the
cargo
loading
platform
here
in
its
lowered
position
note
the
prong
thingy
sticking
out
from
the
rear
and
here
raised
the
prong
thingy
is
now
hinged
up
to
support
the
back
of
the
platform
and
keep
it
level
heres
a
slightly
different
angle
so
you
can
see
the
pieces
under
there
the
allimportant
cargo
itself
hmmmnot
much
for
a
plane
this
size
the
cargo
pallet
slots
neatly
onto
the
loading
platform
heres
the
complete
set
of
ground
equipment
all
attached
and
so
onto
the
plane
itself
note
that
unlike
the
other
large
planes
the
main
wing
sits
at
the
top
of
the
row
of
bricks
making
up
the
side
of
the
fuselage
i
took
it
apart
a
little
so
you
can
see
the
internal
construction
of
the
fuselage
note
that
the
cargo
area
is
really
small
right
at
the
back
what
else
is
this
thing
carrying
illegal
immigrants
a
picture
of
the
rear
of
the
fuselage
just
because
i
like
the
sticker
front
landing
gear
way
better
than
on
the
other
large
planes
i
dont
know
if
this
is
a
new
piece
or
what
but
ive
had
no
problems
with
it
at
all
and
my
kids
have
been
playing
with
it
as
well
the
rather
sexy
rear
undercarriage
this
area
reminds
me
of
one
of
those
giant
russian
transport
planes
wicked
those
angled
grey
slopes
atop
each
side
of
the
rear
undercarriage
annoy
the
heck
out
of
me
as
they
keep
coming
off
whenever
i
pick
the
plane
up
i
think
a
1x4
plate
on
top
to
bind
them
together
might
solve
that
a
slightly
blurry
view
sorry
from
underneath
the
gear
looks
like
it
might
be
capable
of
retracting
internally
but
alas
no
this
is
a
shame
as
theres
certainly
enough
room
in
there
and
its
a
wasted
opportunity
imo
might
have
to
modify
that
a
view
of
one
of
the
four
engines
i
personally
think
they
look
too
small
and
should
have
something
under
the
wing
as
well
to
make
them
rounder
cockpit
crew
door
open
i
love
the
smooth
action
of
these
doors
and
the
way
they
seal
flush
against
the
fuselage
when
closed
cargo
door
open
crew
door
with
docked
ladder
cargo
door
with
docked
loading
platform
cargo
slots
inside
and
locks
into
place
the
same
way
it
sits
on
the
loader
neat
the
minifigs
sorry
this
one
is
a
bit
blurry
and
that
concludes
this
weeks
show
and
tell
dr
s
sweet
plane
looks
much
better
than
in
the
catalogs
sweet
thanks
drs
for
this
great
review
this
is
your
what
second
one
anyway
this
aint
half
bad
i
actually
kind
of
like
the
bigger
planes
despite
the
annoying
big
pieces
and
this
one
looks
to
be
the
best
yet

i
do
admit
the
amount
of
cargo
is
rediculously
small
but
it
still
looks
good
say
how
much
can
the
plane
hold
thanks
for
the
review
sweet
thats
all
the
space
you
get
now
it
might
be
possible
to
rip
out
that
rear
bulkhead
at
the
back
of
the
wing
and
fill
the
middle
area
with
tiles
so
cargo
pallets
could
slide
up
the
fuselage
but
that
would
definitely
prevent
the
undercarriage
folding
internally
if
thats
what
you
wanted
to
do
as
well
dr
s
wow
thats
a
great
review
of
a
great
set
dr
s
y
as
you
yourself
have
already
noted
this
has
the
potential
to
be
a
fantastic
military
moc
with
a
bit
of
modification
you
can
get
the
engines
to
be
rounder
or
perhaps
do
away
with
them
completely
and
replace
them
with
jet
engines
sweet
though
i
cant
think
of
a
system
to
retract
the
undercarriage
at
the
top
of
my
head
it
seems
like
theres
indeeed
more
than
enough
potential
to
do
so
it
reminds
me
rather
of
an
ilyushin

about
it
still
is
it

would
you
recomend
buying
it
well
i
can
only
speak
for
myself
i
like
it
worth
3500
well
its
a
big
box
for
that
amount
of
money
but
full
of
big
parts
of
course
i
dunno
could
do
with
being
cheaper
but
then
im
sure
we
all
think
that
of
our
favourite
hobby
3000
would
be
nearer
the
mark
imo
dr
s
nice
review
dr
s
i
have
been
thinking
long
and
hard
about
the
scale
of
the
planes
in
my
town
i
would
like
to
keep
my
passenger
planes
in
their
classic
4wide
fuselage
style
but
i
really
dont
mind
the
new
plane
hull
pieces
if
they
are
used
as
an
enormous
transport
plane
like
the
ilyushin76
unfortunately
i
cant
afford
this
lovely
new
green
one
at
the
moment
which
would
be
perfect
to
go
with
my
green
army
as
i
took
too
much
of
a
hit
buying
the
new
2008
star
wars
sets
but
i
have
modified
my
white
one
to
take
huge
cargo
loads
in
fact
my
apc
is
designed
specifically
to
fit
inside
unfortunately
im
a
bit
busy
to
take
pics
at
the
moment
but
hope
to
put
some
up
soon
at
my
local
walmart

of

i
must
say
the
designers
did
an
excellent
job
on
it
i
love
the
little
temple
design
with
skulls
as
well
as
including
indy
in
the
right
hand
corner
the
back
of
the
box
is
just
as
cool
showing
all
the
neat
play
features
of
the
set
as
well
as
an
advertisement
for
the
indiana
jones
game
figs
first
off
we
have
our
hero
indian
what
the
hell
why
is
there
a
freaking
cw
anakin
head
on
indy
there
was
a
production
slip
up
as
instead
of
indys
head
i
get
anakins
i
open
the
box
up
and
there
staring
me
in
the
face
is
his
ugly
face
tlc
is
defiantly
doing
to
here
a
gnarly
complaint
from
me
ok
now
here
we
have
the
real
indy
fig
that
is
supposed
to
come
with
the
set
d
i
just
noticed
that
his
fedora
hat
goes
down
in
the
back
bonus
picture
time
here
is
a
jacketless
indy
with
his
sleeve
torn
off
like
he
looks
in

the

up
is

lovely

plus
her

finally
we
have
our

with

poseable

the
set
itself
is
a
nice

and
playset
the
anubis
statues
are
very
cool
and
i
love
all
the
hieroglyphs
on
the
walls

here
is
the
sw

with
artoo
and
3p0
xd
the
ark
in
its
resting
place
the
ark
removed
its
very
cool
indeed
but
tlc
should
have
made
the
whole
thing
in
chrome
gold
not
metallic
gold
with
brown
and
yellow
the
closeup
of
the
anubis
statue
yes
the
eye
is
a
sticker
but
at
leasts
a
gold
color
playability
first
off
you
can
pull
the
pin
on
the
anubis
statues
which
send
them
falling
and
taking
out
the
walls
behind
the
wall
a
skellie
swings
out
there
is
a
lever
in
the
back
of
the
model
where
you
push
down
and
the
snakes
shower
down
upon
the
figs
hehe
with
the
snakes
all
around
marion
is
both
modeling
with
the
new
carrot
torch
and
fending
off
viscous
cobras
d
in
the
meantime
indy
uses
his
whip
to
scale
the
wall
and
avoid
all
the
snakes
which
he
is
afriad
of
in
the
meantime
leaving
marion
behind
to
fight
them
off
p
the
whip
is
bendable
but
it
will
always
snap
back
into
a

in
the
end
this
is
a
charming
set
and
could
easily
fit
in
with
the
adventurers
it
has
the
cool
anubis
statues
as
well
as
the
ark
plus
indy
marion
and
a
skellie
great
selection
of
figs
but
sallah
would
have
been
better
since
he
actually
removes
the
ark
with
indy
however
i
am
still
wondering
the
point
of
the
anubis
statues
this
set
does
seem
pretty
silly
p

thanks
for
a
nice
review
piranha
y
a
lovely
playset
with
a
classical
egyptian
adventurers
touch
although
im
not
completely
sure
for
the
robot
arms
for
the
statues
somehow
a
little
more
details
couldve
worked
well
for
that
set

wow
i
cant
believe
other
people
have
had
this
same
head
error
mistake
xo
i
thought
it
was
one
of
those
extreme
cases
of
production
slip
up
the
good
thing
is
i
will
get
a
replacement
indy
head
and
get
to
keep
that
anakin
head
i
forgot
to
mention
that
my
set
was
also
missing
1
black
ear
piece
for
the
anubis
statues
there
also
are
extra
stickers
for
my
set
i
cant
figure
out
what
they
are
for
though
hehe
i
too
like
my
tod

much

still
wont

for
the
great
review
batbrick
away
hello
and
welcome
to
another
oh
wait
first
batbrick
and
iamded
review
today
us
two
sworn
enemies
will
be
reviewing
the
creator
cargo
chopper
here
is
the
front
of
the
box
and
while
pushing
iamded
to
his
doom
here
is
the
back
haha
ouch
oh
dearhere
are
the
parts
anyway
here
is
the
instruction
of
the
first
model
the
cargo
chopper
i
love
creator
sets
for
the
different
models
they
always
excite
me
just
ignore
me
finishing
off
my
nemesis
in
the
background
something
very
interesting
that
i
liked
in
the
instructions
was
this
step
where
you
must
add
those
three
2x2
yellow
rounded
pieces
under
the
chopper
this
is
for
support
while
you
build
which
is
handy
and
later
you
take
it
off
and
even
later
use
it
as
the
cargo
i
found
that
to
be
rather
innovative
and
clever
as
well
as
hey
what
are
you
hitting
me
for
both
instruction
booklets
have
the
same
back
now
heres
the
chopper
itself
i
love
the
design
of
it
it
isnt
quite
minifig
scale
but
its
great
all
the
same
this
is
my
first
nonxpod
or
house
creator
set
and
it
sure
is
fun
here
me
and
iamded
go
for
a
dizzy
ride
i
love
the
nose
of
the
copter
and
the
landing
gear
is
fantastic
a
shot
from
the
other
side
oh
dear
it
seems
weve
been
a
bit
sick
from
that
ride
and
were
vomiting
transgreen
1x1s
the
cargo
itself
is
nicely
made
though
i
forgot
to
put
on
two
tiles
here
it
fits
in
real
well
with
the
chopper
to
and
the
line
is
great
for
giving
iamded
the
wedgie
he
deserves
this
is
my
first
power
function
set
so
i
was
pretty
excited
the
motor
is
intergrated
really
well
into
this
set
and
is
activated
by
pushing
that
little
3x2
plate
with
the
1x1
slopes
on
it
forward
until
it
hits
the
motor
button
that
orange
knob
another
point
of
interest
is
the
use
of
bley
barrels
on
each
side
i
like
this
as
i
dont
have
those
pieces
in
that
colour
a
shot
of
the
motor
its
really
simple
all
you
do
is
pull
the
hook
out
to
any
length
that
allows
then
press
the
orange
button
and
it
will
wind
it
back
up
this
makes
the
chopper
pull
the
cargo
up
into
its
bay
and
iamded
pull
me
here
reluctantly
to
a
whacking
a
top
view
is
that
my
head
a
view
of
the
chopper
without
the
cargo
in
it
i
love
the
lowered
cockpit
the
leftover
pieces
from
building
note
iamdeds
head
does
not
count
as
set
piece
and
a
final
shot
of
the
set
with
me
and
iamded
oh
it
appear
were
dead
oh
dear
hope
you
enjoyed
this
review
soon
i
will
post
the
two
alternate
models
i
loved
this
chopper
its
great
to
play
with
and
has
nice
construction
it
also
has
some
handy
pieces
too
the
motor
function
sounds
like
a
gimmick
but
is
well
intergrated
into
this
model
well
worth
the
price
so
far
this
is
another
win
for
creator
i
say
so
far
i
recommend
this
model
but
later
well
see
if
the
alt
models
are
up
to
scratch
also
since
this
is
my
first
review
comments
and
criticism
welcome

thank
you
for
your
wonderful
review
i
was
done
very
well
i
suggest
that
you
will
find
twofaces
escape
set
a
very
interesting
one
to
build
it
also
provides
great
playability
and
is
not
very
expensive
for
what
you
will
get
good
day
to
you
yes
twoface
escape
is
definitly
a
good
buy
i
suggest
you
get
it
it
is
a
tie
between
two
faces
escape
and
the
batcave
but
i
would
go
with
the
cave
over
1000
pieces
nifty
submarine

and
and
it

smugglers
shanty
overview
smugglers
shanty
was
released
in
1992
it
consisted
of
69
pieces
3
minifigs
two
pirates
one
imperial
and
it
cost
925
usd
the
set
itself
is
a
small
but
rather
sturdy
den
for
the
pirates
review
the
minifigs
consist
of
two
pirates
and
one
imperial
the
minifigs
are
not
all
that
rare
which
is
disappointing
i
would
of
liked
a
rarer
fig
but
still
it
is
a
good
cheap
source
of
pirate
and
imperial
figures
here
is
an
overall
shot
of
the
set
which
includes
the
three
figs
the
shanty
which
is
made
using
palm
leaves
pieces
and
a
nice
grey
shark
nibbling
at
the
soldiers
oar
a
close
up
of
the
soldier
rowing
hard
in
his
boat
i
would
have
preferred
to
have
a
normal
soldier
with
shako
hat
as
i
have
more
officers
than
normal
soldiers
now
and
a
close
up
snap
of
the
main
structure
note
the
wine
glass
which
was
a
nice
touch
funnily
enough
only
4
pieces
of
treasure
were
included
in
this
set
compared
to
the
usual
8
gold
coins
in
other
sets
a
view
from
the
back
which
also
gives
a
good
view
of
the
pieces
used
to
construct
the
shanty
mainly
simple
black
1
by
1
bricks
the
shanty
looks
good
from
most
angles
but
their
are
a
few
where
the
roof
construction
looks
rather
odd
but
that
is
just
a
minor
nitpick
yet
another
view
from
the
front
this
time
at
a
slightly
different
angle
the
yellow
base
plate
looks
rather
nice
too
i
prefer
it
over
the
tan
pieces
we
trend
to
get
nowadays
attack
the
stupid
drunk
pirate
in
the
background
does
not
even
notice
overall
i
think
this
is
a
rather
good
set
despite
some
shortcomings
such
as
the
lack
of
treasure
and
odd
roof
from
some
angles
the
shark
imperial
soldier
and
useful
parts
make
up
for
it
and
of
course
the
price
is
cheap
on
most
auction
sites
i
got
mine
for
a
mere
5
10
with
the
cheapest
price
on
bricklink
being
8
rate
the
set
then
leave
your
comments
thoughts
and
opinions
first
ill
comment
on
the
review
and
at
a
later
date
ill
comment
on
the
set
youve
done
a
top
job
lord
of
pies
y
youve
captured
the
set
from
a
variety
of
angles
and
posed
the
minifigures
interestingly
very
nice
review
lord
of
pies
thanks
for
taking
the
time
to
put
this
together
and
especially
for
all
the
detailed
pics
y
i
very
much
regret
that
my
dark
ages
occured
when
they
did
basically
i
missed
out
on
all
the
cheap
and
easy
troop
building
sets
and
this
one
is
certainly
no
exception
the
big
sets
are
nice
but
these
are
the
ones
that
always
make
me
wish
just
a
little
harder
for
a
return
of
lego
pirates
i
gave
it
a
4
out
of
5
just
because
id
buy
4
out
of
5
sitting
on
the
shelves
today
were
it
possible
wow
i
remember
this
set
from
when
i
was
a
kid
i
got
it
for
my
birthday
and
opened
the
package
first
sadly
i
had
to
go
to
school
so
i
had
to
leave
it
at
home
and
not
build
it
or
play
with
it
until
i
got
home
needless
to
say
that
was
one
of
the
longest
days
of
school
ever
good
review
great
set
great
small
set
that
can
help
you
add
to
you
minifig
count
the
little
boats
are
always
cool
and
the
den
isnt
that
bad
either
a
very
nice
review
of
a
pretty
and
neat
little
set
thanks
lord
of
pies
guess
it
´
s
a
3
for
me
with
strong
tendencies
to
4
first
of
all
excellent
review
55
for
me
i
have
yet
to
attain
one
of
these
sets
it
has
a
nice
trio
of
men
including
a
redcoat
and
a
nice
assortment
of
weapons
the
rest
such
as
the
leaves
is
great

nice
poll
as
well
but
you
made
sure
nobody
can
give
this
set
a
1
which
is
very
nice
but
probably
a
little
mistake
d
i
gave
it
the
toprating
one
should
not
step
into
the
pirates
domain
and
give
a
mere
1
to
any
non4
pirate
set
duke
woow
d
this
was
my
first
lego
set
ever
this
set
shows
the
awesomeness
of
classic
pirate
sets
i
really
have
to
get
me
some
more
xd
great
review
on
a
great
set
id
give
the
set
a
3
12
out
of
5
it
needed
1
more
imperial
to
get
a
4
a
bigger
basplate
would
have
been
nice
as
it
appears
to
hard
to
fit
all
the
minifigs
on
the
island
thanks
for
this
great
review
why
not
they
are
all
very
nice
i
have
all
six
of
them
especially
the
helicopter
my
least
anticipated
but
one
of
the
most
detailed
thanks
for
the
review
brainbox
thanks
for
that
very
fine
review
brainbox
y
lovely
little
creator
goodies
with
very
neat
alternative
models
as
well
mmmmh
i
wub
love
the
train
great
review
it
looks
like
each
model
can
be
connected
to
the
other
to
make
a
complete
train
y
y
it
makes
me
want
to
get
3
of
them
or
more
to
make
a
long
one
d
tks
for
these
cool
reviews
metalandi
i
love
these
orc
sets
i
am
so
going
to
get
these
im
happy
to
see
that
scared
face
again
i
love
it
really
and
the
use
of
that
handculfs
that
new
armour
looks
really
cool
that
tower
is
really
nice
and
i
wont
mod
it
that
much
which
os
cool
and
the
battle
ram
is
freaking
sweet
tks
again
for
sharing
yoda
great
review
pictures
and
all
thanks
for
showing
all
the
mechanisms
of
the
tower
i
didnt
notice
them
from
either
the
pics
we
had
or
the
instructionsit
didnt
hit
me
that
when
you
knock
down
the
wall
the
second
floor
breaks
that
is
a
genius
idea
this
looks
like
a
superb
set
unfortunately
my
priority
right
now
is
the
troll
warship
still
if
that
really
is
us
80
i
might
skip
it
and
go
for
this
instead
which
is
only
20
us
one
note
though
i
think
there
might
not
be
a
back
cage
on
the
second
floor
of
the
tower
so
that
the
mechanism
can
work
did
you
try
to
see
if
the
second
floor
ground
still
falls
if
you
add
it
a
fourth
cage
wall
also
you
could
just
pretend
that
the
tower
is
built
against
a
mountainside
it
would
fit
perfectly
and
add
more
defense
to
the
knights
great
review
vk
thanks
for
the
double
review
i
like
the
dwarf
catapult
but
the
real
deal
is
the
tower
raid
set
i
love
that
siege
tower
and
love
that
new
armour
cant
wait
to
get
it
thanks
for
the
review

am
said
its
still
looks
good
but
the
crappy
rubber
band
system
is
really
not
well
thought
off
yoda
i
totally
agreed
with
your
comments
the
rubber
system
is
not
effective
at
all
i
bought
2
defenders
recently
and
i
found
out
that
when
the
wheels
move
the
rubber
just
stuck
there
without
rotating
the
blades
at
the
front
i
have
not
really
found
a
solution
for
mine
yet
so
far
i
only
took
out
the
rubber
band
placing
the
blades
on
the
ground
removing
of
the
red
technic
part
on
the
left
side
in
this
way
when
the
defender
is
moving
on
smooth
ground
the
blades
will
move
too
thanks
for
the
great
review
y
the
siege
tower
does
look
great
ill
have
to
look
out
for
these
sets

the
open
towers
are
kinda
funny
although
they
were
also
typical
of
for

90s
pirate
sets
the
trolls
vehicles
are
cool
though
they
look
evil
i
cant
wait
to

plus
for

am
said
is
it
the
first
set
youe
given
100
to
yes
it
is
i
gave
cafe
corner
a
96
and
i
felt
this
was
a
better
set
and
improved
on
the
things
that
i
dinged
cafe
corner
on
lack
of
minifigs
was
one
thing
thats
why
i
enjoy
reading
the
comments
so
i
can
see
if
my
ratings
are
in
line
with
what
everyone
else
thinks
and
to
see
if
i
missed
anything
i
cant
wait
for
some
of
you
to
build
it
and
share
your
thoughts
as
well
a
very
fine
review
with
great
and
informative
pictures
thanks
dunamis
y
and
what
a
wonderful
set
a
masterpiece
and
far
beyond
everything
i
wouldve
expected
just
one
year
ago
the
amount
of
details
is
exceptional
from
the
different
railings
to
the
mousehole
and
the
radiator
sheer
brilliant
and
two
female
mfs
or
hippies
you
never
know
and
a
child
only
one
adult
male
character
who
nearly
looks
like
well
anyways
its
simply
a
milestone
and
a
very
creative
and
inspiring
beauty

will
you
marry
me
great
review
thanks
for
taking
the
time
to
do
this
this
has
been
a
great
line
at
the
risk
of
abandoning
my
castleadventurer
loyalties
ive
got
to
say
this
is
rapidly
becoming
my
favorite
line
and
this
set
looks
to
be
the
best
of
the
lot
while
it
still
hurts
to
shell
out
150
i
think
ill
still
be
happy
to
do
so

am
said
the
old
tubes
also
grip
the
nozzles
much
more
firmly
and
if
you
arent
careful
when
removing
them
its
actually
possible
to
rip
off
the
nozzles
completely
xo
i
actually
noticed
that
while
taking
it
apart
but
didnt
really
pay
any
attention
i
just
thought
thats
because
its
an
old
part
well
thanks
for
the
information
as
i
bought
it
i
didnt
even
know
i
would
also
get
a
box
it
just
said
all
parts
with
building
instructions
after
opening
the
parcel
i
was
like
woah
woooaaahhh
and
so
on
i
love
legoboxes
because
as
a
child
i
stood
in
the
toy
stores
starring
at
the
boxes
only
seeing
the
front
and
the
back
nothing
more
this
brings
back
some
memories

eric
thanks
for
that
information
it
opened
my
eyes
as
to
the
function
of
the
threaded
axle
thank
you
very
much
for
that
review
this
was
my
first
pneumatic
set
this
was
my
first
technic
set
aged
7
still
a
great
one
in
terms
of
function
density
and
a
great
bmodel
in
the
uk
im
certain
it
was
called
the
salvage
hoist
nice
pictures
i
also
sort
out
the
pieces
the
same
way
if
im
rebuilding
a
model
y
this
set
packs
a
lot
of
functionality
into
a
fairly
small
size
but
was
rather
expensive
for
its
size
70
when
it
was
still
available
compared
to
other
sets
of
that
time
you
can
also
rig
up
the
technic
flag
sticker
that
it
comes
with
to
the
main
model
ive
done
that
on
mine
you
may
want
to
reinforce
it
with
tape
if
youre
going
to
leave
the
model
on
display
though
as
it
will
break
up
over
time
due
to
uv
exposure
like
many
stickers
do
i
had
to
do
that
with
mine
after
it
started
to
crack
although
it
still
looks
pretty
good
hmm
seems
like
the
wheels
are
recycled
into
the

the

flaw
i
noticed
was
weak
support
of

drivetrain
which
was
easily
corrected
with

extra

where
dont
have

hello

heres
something
new
i

actually
making

yes
i
got
a
new

for
christmas
now
i
was
testing
to
see
how
the
camera
would
reflect
so
some
of
the
pics
are
a
bit
blurry
i
have
based
this
review
from

okay
so
as
you
can
see
below
the
box
is
pretty
simple
as
always
european
versions
wont
have
the

count
name
etc
just
the
number
i
believe
mine
having
the
american
version
has
the
info
on
it
as
you
can
see
it
has
the
classic
mm
logo
and
the
red
planet
as
well
as
the
set
in
a

itself
very
nice
i
linked

two

the
jeelies
are
fine
but
i
pefer
the
lom
ones
but
they
glow
those
new
alien

for

look
promising
though
the

is

too
overall
i
like
the
miner
and
it
is

i
feel
the

is
lacking
though
aliens
the
alien
vehical
is
the
main
part
of
the
set
this

shows
the
beginning

solid
and
sturdy
but
those
four

are
pointless
no

and
they
dont
get
used
at
all
nice
tlc
now
we
get
cooking
this
pic
shows
the
tail
added
on
and
the
more
bulk
being
built
we
get
a
little
repetitive
and
build
the
craft
up
in
this
pic
and
this
pic
from
the

shows
how
the

the

and
there
are
a

the
alien
falls
out
of
the
cockpit
when
turned
upside
down

this

i
think
lego
did
a
bad
job
on
the
alien
ship
i
dont

any
of
the

look
good

y
i
got
this
set
for
a
birthday
present
last
year
and
it
is
pretty
fun
overall
the
alien
ship
in
this
set
is
actually
one
of
my
favorites
it
just
looks
cool
and
the
way
you
can
fold
it
out
is
really
clever
the
only
negative
for
me
is
the
cockpit
of
the
mining
unit
not
really
because
it
isnt
detailed
but
because
mine
is
top
heavy
and
keeps
falling
forward
its
kinda
funny
if
you
think
about
him
driving
along
and
then
falling
forwardbut
not
funny
at
all
when
youre
playing
mine
doesnt
fall
forward
maybe
the
newer
ones
have
stronger
joints

things

that
i
was

how
big
the

was
in

perhaps
those
large
black

caused
it

for

everyone

agree
with

the
buety
of

imho
8829
is
much
better
than
8296
first
8829
is
a
lot
bigger
i
really
like
the
huge
rear
balloon
tires
they
both
have
rack
and
pinion
steering
and
they
both
have
trailing
arm
rear
suspension
with
a
v2
engine
i
think
the
body
on
8829
is
a
little
more
well
done
for
8296
i
think
the
alternate
tractor
model
is
much
better
for
more
comparisons

what
kind

do
you
use
the

have
very
good
depth
of
field
meaning
that
both
the

the
background
are
in
good

this
is
usually
hard
to
do

the

the
difference
is
only
supposed
to
be
longer
teeth
so
it
really
should
not
matter

it
does
if
your

bad
try
switching
the

all

sweet
i
definately
prefer
8159
in
terms
of
minifigs
and
useful
parts
colors
to
me
but
the
cars
are
all
the
same
basic
design
thanks
for
the

and
i
actually

this

i

if

i
can

thanks
for

the
pics
it
is
strange
that
you
didnt
know
about
that
zpiece
before
it
was
well
used
in
old
space
sets
the
cars
are
pretty
nice
but
i
think
the
people
sit
way
too
high
in
them
the
windscreen
gives
almost
no
protection
i
am
planning
on
modifying
them
to
7
studs
wide
since
thats
my
current
standard
for
this
kind
of
race
cars
seriously
looking
forward
to
the

the

good
as
the
crystal

and
there
colouring
mistake
with

is
just
well
bad
and
not
the

of

i

tlc
to
do
something
that
stupid

do

a
very
neat
and
useful
little
set
thank
you
for
the
nice

a
great
review
for
a
great

it
even
had
the
old
technic
tpieces

bevels
which
i
actually
prefer
to
their

the
turntable
on
the
back
doesnt
turn
very
well
though
as
the
weight
is
all
distributed
on
one
side
the
screw
axle
prevents
it
from
popping
off
but
there
is
still
a
lot
of
friction
in
it
i
got
mine
for
#
20
in
a
second
hand
shop
it
said
complete
but
one
of
the
screw
knuts
was
missing
xo
so
its
practically
impossible
to
keep
the
back
arm
on
with
only
one
and
theyre
rather
rare
on
bl
too
yesterday
while
building
i
accidentaly
dropped
a
axle
nut
of
course
im
working
in
a
total
mess
and
so
it
tool
some
time
til
i
found
it
again
there
are
324
axle
nuts
on
bricklink
with
an
avg
price
of

i
didnt
know
of
this

you

i

sing

i

quite

and
i
also
want
to
just
tack
it
onto
another
order
sad
yeah
i
meant
theyre
rare
but
i
can
imagine
that
a
normal
axle
with
the
old
half
bushes
will
help
sometimes
these
are
really
strong
if
you
put

in
a

i
just
tried
it
a
normal
10l
axle
with
2
interlocking
old
half
bushes
type
1
on
each
end
i
chose
those
who
only
can
be
moved
very
hardly
along
an
axle
i
slewed
the
bjst
back
arm
a
few
times
tried
the
pneumatics
parallel
to
it
and
it
didnt
loose

the
way
dont
forget
to
build
the
alternate
model
of
8862
it
is
a
combine
farm
equipment
which
is
just
as
good
as
8274
i
liked
it
so
much
that
i
bought
two
copies
of
this
set
so
i
could
display
both
my
favorite
alternate
model
not
counting
universal
sets
is
the
8480
submarine
maybe
it
is
time
for
a
white
set
review
skull
white
is
pretty
rare
for
your
blue
set
i
recommend
you
review
8462
there
are
only
a
couple
of
green
sets
and
8479
is
the
best
and
then
of
course
8458
is
silver
i
think
we
all
know
what
the
best
black
set
is
and
according
to
your
photography
you
have
lots
of
them
but
dont
forget

seconds
wow
thats
a
long
exposure
i
would
think
you
would
get
way
too
much
light
and
overexpose
the
image
the
aperture
must
have
been
tiny
quote
i
will
review
it
too
and
post
it
in
this
topic
cool
i
am
also
planning
to
write
about
the
combine
on
technicopedia
combine
quote
actually
i
took
it
from
your
site
xd
i
thought
that
word
sounded
familiar
quote
unfortunately
i
dont
own
8480
but
i
think
8824
is
also
a
very
good
though
small
white
set
8462
rocks
as
a
blue
set
i
just
got
it
a
few
weeks
ago
lets
see
8462
also
is
one
of
the
last
technic
sets
i
would
call
oldschool
8479
okay
too
but
8458
is
imho
not
8868
and
the
totally
mysteriously
black
set
will
follow
you
dont
own
8480
that
is
unacceptable
it
is
imperative
that
you
put
a
mortgage
on
your
house
immediately
to
get
it
sweet
yes
8824
is
a
good
white
set
i
also
see
from
your
room
photos
that
you
have
the
8839
supply
ship
which
has
lots
of
white
this
is
a
really
nice
set
8462
is
hard
to
call
old
school
but
at
least
it
uses
regular
beams
the
air
tanks
are
the
best
part
of
the
set
i
wish
lego
had
used
them
more
often
especially
on
the
highly
pneumatic
sets
the
tank
makes
all
the
difference
on
8459
you
are
right
8458
is
certainly
not
old
school
but
it
is
a
great
set
with
wonderful
suspension
it
is
of
the
same
era
as
the
super
street
sensation
with
all
of
the
panels
for
body
contouring
8868
is
technic
at
its
best
there
is
nothing
else
like
it
especially
with
the
compressor
quote
did
you
had
something
like
this
in
mind
if
the
toothed
10l
axle
rotates
the
axle
nuts
want
to
rotate
too
but
they
cant
because
of
that
2x4
technic
plate
so
theyll
decide
to
move
along
the
axle
the
1x6
bricks
on
each
end
make
sure
that
the
axle
wont
move
in
or
out
thanks
for
your
feedback
while
the
assembly
you
have
drawn
would
work
as
a
linear
actuator
i
would
not
recommend
it
the
torsional
stiffness
and
strength
of
an
axle
are
proportional
to
the
polar
moment
of
inertia
a
section
property
most
of
the
stiffness
comes
from
the
outside
of
the
cross
shaped
axle
but
in
the
threaded
axle
you
lose
all
the
stiffness
of
the
outer
area
because
it
is
not
continuous
this
means
you
only
get
stiffness
and
strength
from
the
small
core
i
think
the
threaded
axle
would
bend
and
break
very
easily
if
subjected
to
much
torque
eric
im
very
sorry
for
that

for
the
summary
this
set
is
an
excellent
buy
at
20
dollars
its
well
designed
and
has
lots
of
details
it
also
has
very
unique
minifigs
which
are
always
good
in
a
set
its
only
downfalls
are
the
lack
of
acessories
for
the
minifigs
and
that
there
are
no
cool
contraptions
on
the
cars
and
by
cool
i
mean
lethal
to
the
other
racers
now
to
the
scoring
of
the

have
been

except
for
the

on
the
cars
but
both
are
easily
modifiedfixed
hence
the

a
great

bonus
try
and
count
how
many

nope

and
thanks
hollisbrick
they
are
both
really
similar
so
it
really
depends
on
which
colors
you
use
more
in
mocing
or
which
characters
you
like
more
my
personal
choice
is
8159
as
it
has
cooler
minifigs
except
for
racer
xs
recycled
head
and
the
colors
are
more
useful
to
me
then
again
if
youre
like
batbrick
the
only
thing
that
matters
is
if
a
set
has
orange
in
it
p
regards

get
this
set

this
1994
set
marked
the
beginning
of
a
new
era
for
lego
pirates
it
became
a
theme
more
centralised
around
playability
and
not
so
much
grand
ol
ships
6278
enchanted
island
was
the
flagship
set
of
the
islanders
subtheme
heavily
based
around
polynesian
and
native
american
concepts
in
fact
tlc
was
successfully
sued
by
a
number
of
tribes
for
using
bastardised
maori
names
such
as
kahuka
it
was
released
as
a
legend
set
in
2001
but
due
to
poor
sales
was
discontinued
again
the
largest
of
the
islander
sets
enchanted
island
is
a
portion
of
an
island
with
a
river
running
through
the
left
hand
side
features
some
sturdy
buildings
built
into
a
treelike
structure
on
a
rocky
outcrop
whilst
the
left
hand
side
features
a
tower
built
out
of
wooden
posts
and
a
large
tribal
statue
the
box
cover
shows
all
the
details
it
does
however
differ
from
the
instructions
finished
product
in
that
it
has
been
more
aesthetically
arranged
bushes
etc
have
been
moved
to
fill
in
gaps
and
to
not
obscure
other
things
the
sides
of
the
box
show
nothing
particularly
special
although
in
one
scene
it
depicts
the
islander
canoe
chasing
the
pirate
boat
with
the
treasure
just
one
way
to
play
with
the
set
the
back
of
the
box
however
is
superb
featuring
a
large
number
of
alternative
models
a
toothy
statue
a
pirate
tree
think
wolfpack
with
an
islander
base
kahukas
throne
a
firebreathing
statue
and
a
soupedup
boat
for
the
pirates
these
and
many
more
can
be
easily
made
because
of
the
large
diversity
of
pieces
the
set
has
a
huge
number
of
minifigures
for
its
size
the
third
highest
number
in
the
pirate
range
the
ses
and
the
bsb
being
first
and
second
respectively
a
whopping
7
5
islanders
including
the
alltoocommon
king
kahuka
the
elusive
islander
babe
and
3
standard
warriors
this
set
alone
will
never
leave
you
short
of
enemies
2
pirates
ironhook
in
his
standard
attire
with
a
scurvy
dog
at
his
side
attack
the
island
although
they
are
only
moderately
armed
2
cutlasses
and
a
pistol
between
them
a
musket
wouldve
been
nice
the
islanders
on
the
other
hand
have
4
shields
a
bow
and
quiver
and
6
spears
not
to
mention
the
big
pokey
thing
with
horns
on
top
weapon
idol
staff
a
monkey
parrot
and
crocodile
provide
the
obvious
creature
features
with
a
fair
amount
of
gold
to
finish
off
in
the
instructions
the
goblet
does
not
have
the
lid
although
it
does
on
the
box
its
a
nice
touch
anyway
adding
a
little
more
diversity
to
the
monotonous
treasure
stashes
the
pirates
boat
is
a
nice
2
sail
vessel
with
oars
for
when
the
wind
stops
and
a
treasure
map
the
sails
are
similar
to
those
in
lagoon
lockup
but
with
an
extra
front
sail
its
an
awesome
little
boat
better
for
raids
than
a
rowing
boat
but
not
too
big
that
it
cant
sail
up
rivers
it
can
comfortably
fit
2
men
and
at
a
squeeze
5
the
sails
are
expensive
if
you
buy
them
seperately
normally
this
wont
be
a
problem
but
they
can
cost
aroun
5
each
the
islanders
boat
is
a
canoe
with
a
sail
and
an
outrigger
to
stabilise
it
the
sail
is
beautifully
done
with
2
spars
taughtening
it
there
is
a
clip
for
the
rower
to
leave
his
weapon
when
at
se
and
the
mast
can
turn
to
get
as
much
wind
as
possible
its
quite
a
topheavy
boat
but
it
doesnt
look
hideous
and
without
the
mastsail
it
looks
great
3
islanders
can
fit
in
it
and
more
if
they
sit
on
the
outrigger
the
markings
on
the
canoe
are
stickers
but
they
look
fine
and
are
probably
more
robust
than
markings
for
their
job
furthermore
theyre
waterproof
sing
kahukas
throne
can
be
carried
by
2
loyal
subjects
or
strapped
to
his
pet
crocodile
the
clips
on
the
side
can
be
used
to
rest
his
weaponry
or
hold
spears
for
battle
the
throne
looks
nice
although
im
not
too
sure
about
the
blue
against
the
red
id
have
prefered
white
as
it
would
clash
less
an
overview
of
the
island
it
is
built
in
2
halves
left
then
right
and
then
joined
together
loosley
so
it
can
be
seperated
for
transporting
around
the
back
to
the
left
and
right
there
are
large
open
spaces
that
are
great
for
battles
this
set
isnt
so
much
about
a
large
solid
build
but
creating
a
village
smaller
structures
linked
by
bridges
and
the
back
to
the
far
left
is
a
platform
built
onto
the
rock
with
access
from
the
river
via
a
ladder
theres
the
standard
islander
drum
with
the
lovely
zebraskin
part
where
did
they
get
that
ive
never
understood
the
white
flag
i
was
under
the
impression
it
was
used
for
surrender
further
along
the
rocky
bank
there
are
some
hinged
palm
leaves
that
swing
upwards
to
reveal
the
treasure
its
an
ok
hiding
place
not
the
best
place
to
hide
it
right
where
the
pirates
sail
past
but
it
feels
fabulous
it
fits
right
in
above
it
on
the
rocky
bank
is
the
main
structure
it
looks
very
disjointed
when
you
build
it
bricks
all
over
the
place
but
once
its
done
it
looks
nice
and
rural
with
leaves
everywhere
and
the
balcony
where
kahuka
is
standing
you
get
a
nice
roof
made
from
2
large
palm
leaves
tilting
down
around
the
back
theres
a
slight
shelter
a
table
for
picnics
and
a
ladder
to
access
the
upstairs
i
was
rather
annoyed
that
it
is
so
open
but
the
set
is
designed
from
just
one
perspective
to
the
left
is
the
bridge
to
the
other
building
a
nice
one
piece
bridge
made
of
the
softer
plastic
used
for
muskets
and
the
post1991
cutlasses
it
looks
good
but
be
warned
it
tilts
when
you
pull
a
pin
sending
the
pirates
flying
this
contraption
is
a
good
idea
but
it
is
very
stiff
and
so
doesnt
swing
even
when
burdened
by
a
minifigure
youll
want
to
modify
this
bit
if
you
get
it
the
other
building
looks
like
it
is
made
out
of
posts
and
beams
they
are
all
red
brown
would
have
been
better
but
it
would
have
added
too
many
colours
to
the
range
just
like
the
use
of
black
for
trees
in
some
forestmen
sets
there
are
3
clips
for
spare
weapons
only
2
of
these
will
ever
be
used
when
all
the
islanders
are
armed
but
it
gives
the
pirates
scope
once
theyve
been
disarmedtheres
another
nice
palm
tree
roof
on
top
2
ladders
give
accesstheres
a
total
of
4
in
this
set
worth
getting
eh
although
theyre
5p
on
bricklink
for
a
kabob
theyre
like
gold
at
the
top
theres
another
hidey
hole
the
palm
leaves
lift
up
on
hinges
to
show
the
treasure
or
hiding
islander
it
can
be
seen
from
behind
but
this
set
is
designed
from
one
perspective
only
nice
cattlehorns
tooalongside
the
slats
you
can
see
in
the
floor
5
years
later
and
it
wouldve
been
a
solid
plate
the
big
statue
is
one
of
the
main
selling
point
of
this
set
alongside
the
tilting
bridge
theyre
the
action
features
shown
in
every
catalogue
at
the
time
but
it
is
not
really
special
just
original
the
statue
fits
in
with
the
theme
perfectly
kahukas
mask
his
shield
and
this
statue
all
depict
the
same
deity
which
is
a
nice
collectible
idea
the
back
is
rather
plain
except
the
angled
1x1
bricks
a
good
touch
im
not
sure
why
theres
a
black
brick
in
the
back
of
the
head
but
this
is
easily
remedied
it
could
even
be
done
with
a
brick
from
this
same
set
just
swapping
the
two
over
aside
from
the
head
turning
the
back
can
open
to
store
sacred
objects
or
in
my
opinion
prisoners
hence
the
gaps
for
breathing
either
way
its
a
lovely
piece
of
architecture
and
deservedly
a
flagship
element
of
the
set
theres
your
standard
cooking
pot
floating
around
although
a
1x1
yellow
stud
as
human
flesh
remember
minifigs
are
yellow
no
matter
what
the
licensed
themes
say
is
a
superb
finish
this
set
is
a
stunning
set
for
both
kids
and
afols
who
are
just
getting
back
into
legopirates
it
is
a
great
army
builder
and
due
to
its
release
as
a
legend
is
extremely
cheap
on
ebay
you
should
be
able
to
pick
one
up
for
#
18
or
#
15
if
youre
lucky
for
that
you
get
a
lifetimes
supply
of
islanders
4
ladders
some
wall
panels
2
baseplates
one
raised
and
both
with
rivers
and
printed
vegetation
around
the
edge
a
ton
of
weapons
a
fair
quantity
of
standard
bricks
but
most
of
all
a
heap
of
vegetation
this
is
an
easy
to
buy
set
with
normally
around
5
on
ebay
at
any
time
and
is
well
worth
it
for
the
parts
the
play
and
the
nostalgia
it
can
be
easily
modified
when
used
in
conjunction
with
any
other
outpost
a
much
larger
fortress
can
be
made
especially
if
more
rope
bridges
are
used
if
you
pick
2
of
this
fine
set
off
ebay
itll
still
be
less
than
the
original
price
a
huge
complex
can
be
constructed
giving
you
an
instantaneous
village
for
around

a
great
and
informative
review
with
very
fine
pictures
thanks
slyowl
sweet
a
wonderful
set
this
is
indeed
full
of
nice
details
and
pretty
playable
and
a
cool
subtheme
that
offers
a
lot
of
fantasy
and
charming
characters
in
a
marvelous
layout
i
really
love
that
little
boat
with
the
outrigger
and
the
neat
buildings
and
sweet
landscaping
works
together
very
well
tlc
got
sued
for
using
some
names
of
native
sounding
origin
now
that
sounds
really
strange
to
me
such
names
´
re
widely
spread
within
novels
movies
and
such
stuff
i
didn
´
t
know
that
there
´
s
some
kind
of
copyright
on
them
8
good
review
mr
slyowl
and
good
pics
too
i
know
it
probably
deserves
better
but
i
only
give
him
a
3
ill
be
surely
the
only
saying
that
i
dont
like
this
set
but
i
remember
i
had
it
for
christmas
when
i
was
a
child
and
it
disappointed
me
very
much
because
i
expected
it
much
larger
after
seeing
it
in
the
lego
catalogs
well
its
just
a
little
trauma
i
had
p
lol
anyway
i
must
admit
its
an
interesant
set
specially
because
of
the
large
number
of
minifigures
and
accesories
it
brings
with
and
the
two
little
ships

am
yay
pictures
thank
you
for
the
review
you
made
me
actually
consider
looking
it
up
on
ebay
but
i
already
have
so
so
many
things
to
get
on
my
want
list
drat
my
easy
ability
to
get
sold
on
something
lego
slyowl
youre
a
legend
thank
you
for
taking
the
time
to
do
such
a
comprehensive
review
youve
captured
enchanted
island
in
impeccable
detail
and
anyone
who
doesnt
own
this
set
should
know
it
insideout
by
now
i
shall
write
my
thoughts
on
the
set
itself
directly
everytime
i
saw
this
at
a
toy
store
i
always
cried
to
my
parents
for
one
but
never
got
it
i
got
the
smaller
islander
sets
but
the
more
i
see
this
now
i
dont
want
it
i
could
buy
it
but
naahh
i
am
hoping
lego
does
an
updated
version
of
the
islanders
with
this
new
pirates
line
one
can
hope
right
xd
i
realized
that
building
the
chess
set
from
the
new
pirates
theme
they
are
two
grey
heads
that
reminded
me
of
the
king
kahuna
throne
which
goes
to
say
that
i
am
hoping
they
bring
back
new
sets
i
just
wish
they
were
bigger
i
would
love
to
build
the
old
ones
but
i
would
side
more
towards
the
newer
model
if
they
ever
released
them
what
an
amazing
old
set
i
loved
pirates
in
my
childhood
but
that
was
before
the
islander
and
spanish
stuff
mine
were
the
bsb
and
soldier
fortress
with
the
big
baseplate
as
im
now
returning
to
pirates
ive
tracked
down
most
of
the
2009
sets
and
of
course
bought
the
new
2015
sets
but
knowing
i
missed
this
middle
period
of
islanders
vs
pirates
makes
me
a
bit
sad
those
islanders
are
soooo
monkey
island
those
of
my
age
likely
feel
the
same
to
my
eyes
oh
for
a
lemonhead
minfig
im
curious
now
how
much
this
set
sells
for
given
it
was
apparently
one
of
very
few
lego
actually
rereleased
i
recently
bought
a
misb
bsb
that
was
an
early
2000s
rerelease
and
it
was
very
pricey
but
then
i
suspect
the
bsb
has
a
lot
more
of
a
nostalgic
following
these
days
than
this
set
can
anyone
give
me
a
rough
idea
what
this
set
goes
for
in
asnew
condition
these
days
regardless
a
fantastic
review
with
some
great
photos
of
the
whole
set
and
minifigs
even
though
this
is
an
old
thread
i
am
glad
someone
else
bumped
it
recently
so
i
can
add
my
thoughts
too
one
thing
ive
noticed
comparing
the
newest
pirates
sets
to
the
80s
ones
i
had
as
a
kid
and
these
from
the
90s
is
the
move
away
from
baseplates
and
big
panel
pieces
i
actually
like
that
in
a
lot
of
ways
whilst
i
miss
baseplates
being
included
as
they
are
a
great
starting
point
for
creating
new
things
and
make
the
sets
easier
to
play
with
visually
i
think
legodesigned
model
sets
look
better
without
them
here
is
a
preview
of
my
review
of
speed
racer
grand

judging
from
your
pictures
there
seems
to
be
many
interesting
torsos
and
new
fleshy
heads
but
i
dont
think
this
set
is
for
me
fueling
my
dismissal
of
this
set
is
that
i
saw
the
trailer
for
this
film
at
the
cinema
today
and
it
looked
pretty
terrible
x
thanks
for
taking
your
time
to
review
this
set
though
ricecracker
they
are
still
good
sets
even
though
the
movie
might
be
crap
geez
its
not
like
we
buy
swl
because
the
movie
is
good
xd
anyway
thanks
for
myour
time
rice
cracker
well
thanks
for
your
posting
but
i
couldn
´
t
care
less
about
fleshie
minifigs
or
movieaccurate
cars
or
the
cars
at
all
this
set
would
really
only
go
into
my
parts
bin
therefore
i
need
to
know
what
parts
are
in
there
and
if
they
are
cool
enough
to
go
into
an
exoforce
collectors
parts
bin
an
opportunity
has
come
up
to
buy
this
set
for
100
aud
just
wondering
whether
people
think
its
worth
buying
ive
heard
very
little
about
the

of
the
race
welcome
to
eb
i
dont
know
what
youre
trying
to
say
here
but
it
isnt
a
good
reason
to
bump
this
thread
either
so
dont
hi
ive
promised
a
lot
lately
ill
review
8868
8880
space
police
ii
blacktron
ii
and
i
will
its
just
the
time
that
is
blocking
me
and
my
university
and
the
fact
that
i
just
picked
up
8460
in
original
box
for
only
eur
3650
sweet
the
other
reviews
will
follow
please
bear
with
me
and
this
set
review
is
also
a
gift
to
this
nice
fellow
who
gave
me
the
title
thats
what
im
talking
about
1
useless
information
with
high
numbers
this
set
contains
841
parts
and
was
released
in
1995
in
the
technic
tech
build
advanced
sub
theme
the
bricklink
price
guide
displays
for
``
used
''
a
qty
avg
price
of
12585
and
for
``
new
''
a
qty
avg
price
of
21282
i
got
it
for
5698
still
ca
n't
believe
it
this
set
was
rereleased
two
times
8431
in
2002
and
8438
in
2003
2
the
box
front
back
open
the
box
is
higher
than
other
technic
boxes
why
i
do
n't
know
8460
does
n't
have
any
real
large
parts
whatever
inlay
i
wonder
why
tlg
does
n't
make
inlays
anymore
...
they
're
noisy
and
brake
easily
but
are
great
for
pre
sorting

building
instructions
i
will
quote
myself
from
the
8862
review
quote
wow
these
instructions
are
used
im
not
used
to
this
after
all
this
sets
with
unread
instruction
booklets
triplewow
`
nuff
said
this
is
the
``
first
''
page
fortunately
peeron
offers
scans
the
last
step
for
the
alternate
model
and
a
few
nice
photos
showing
how
the
pneumatic
pump
will
be
erm
pumped
yeah
random
page
i
forgot
the
overall
thoughts
to
the
instructions
these
are
technic
instructions
as
we
're
used
to
them
part
count
easy
to
understand
okay
the
string
part
at
the
end
was
too
much
for
me
and
the
color
distinction
is
okay
too
100
pages
long
and
if
i
can
trust
my
eyes
the
pneumatics
page
can
be
fold
out
i
do
n't
have
this
page
but
i
assume
it
4
the
parts

building
an
easy
and
fun
build
okay
this
could
take
some
time
my
longest
building
review
up
to
date
the
front
steering
the
rear
steering
the
axle
pin
between
the
rear
steering
is
for
the
axle
which
rotates
the
crane
the
two
worm
screws
in
the
front
are
for
the
outriggers
they
're
not
linked
one
for
each
side
the
small
wheel
in
the
back
is
for
the
rotation
adjusting
front
and
rear
steering
outriggers
are
finished
you
can
notice
a
8
tooth
gear
that
will
rotate
the
technic
turntable
a
steering
wheel
has
been
added
could
be
the
same
stickers
like
the
alternate
8880
used
to
have
the
steering
can
be
operated
with
both
actinic
lights
no
we
're
far
from
finished
i
've
got
a
lot
of
parts
left
at
this
point
wow
a
4x4
corner
plate
pneumatics
and
a
winch
if
you
ca
n't
recognize
it
on
the
photo
the
technic
beams
are
the
erm
wrongother
side
up
the
1x6
technic
beams
on
the
left
side
are
normal
the
axle
that
will
extend
the
crane
7
gear
racks
1x4
the
1x6
technic
plate
will
keep
the
two
pneumatic
cylinders
straight
sad

huh
did
you
blink
you
missed
a
special
part
the
whole
rotatable
thing
will
be
attached
to
the
technic
turntable
using
two
long
technic
pins
the
pin
on
the
right
side
should
be
in
the
middle
of
the
three
``
turntable
holes
''
on
the
right
side
it
's
the
first
hole
asymmetric
why
because
we
'll
add
a
cute
cab

you
can
find
the
features
in
comparison
to
other

here

of
course
i
made
one

of
it
please
do
n't
find
any
mistakes

random
shots
comparison
to
8854
uuuh
...
once
again
a
depth
of
field
i
tried
to
make
it
look
authoritarian
like
8858
but
i
failed
somehow
8460
looks
cute
8
comparison
to
8421
mobile
crane
crane
truck
i
feel
that
a
question
concerning
this
will
be
asked
so
i
deal
with
it
right
now
first
of
all
i
do
n't
own
8421
yet
i
know
a
technic
freak
really
should
own
it
anyway
8421
has
more
than
twice
as
much
parts
as
8460
is
motorized
features
a
v6engine
and
a
very
neat
mechanism
to
extend
the
craneboom
twice
using
a
braided
string
with
end
studs
try
to
find
out
how
of
course
8421
features
far
more
than
8460
imho
8421
should
have
been
a
copy
of
8460
a
set
so
successful
that
it
has
been
rereleased
two
times
but
the
designers
overshoot
the
mark
8421
is
a
breathtaking
monster
compared
to
it
8460
looks
cute
not
pale
9
final
thoughts
i
got
it
on
ebay
in
kind
of
good
condition
for
about
50
dollars
i
know
that
it
has
been
worth
the
money
in
any
point
of
view
wub
i
did
n't
use
the
word
``
oldschool
''
for
now
i
'll
change
that
8460
belongs
to
the
favored
few
of
oldschool
technic
sets
thanks
for
reading
and
viewing
the
pictures
i
hope
you
enjoyed
it
please
comment
if
you
want
to
im
in
the
same
situation
as
you
i
have
this
set
but
missed
out
on
the
newer
8421
this
was
a
great
set
for
its
time
but
the
8421
definitely
looks
better
to
me
ive
been
trying
to
find
a
good
deal
on
it
on
ebay
but
its
pretty
expensive
considering
that
it
only
went
out
of
production
last
year
quote
inlay
i
wonder
why
tlg
does
n't
make
inlays
anymore
...
they
're
noisy
and
brake
easily
but
are
great
for
pre
sorting
the
box
designs
in
general
are
crappier
these
days
than
they
used
to
be
10
years
ago
you
dont
see
the
old
featured
parts
trays
anymore
and
the
boxes
dont
have
the
different
sections
either
these
also
acted
as
internal
supports
for
larger
boxes
so
they
were
less
prone
to
being
crushed
the
cardboard
material
is
also
quite
a
bit
thinner
i
think
its
a
result
of
tlcs
overall
costcutting
moves
since
then
most
people
toss
the
boxes
and
probably
dont
care
but
i
keep
all
of
them
there
was
actually
a
time
when
the
boxes
used
to
be
even
stronger
i
have
an
old
8859
set
and
the
outer
box
is
made
of
a
hard
styrofoam
material
although
they
probably
stopped
using
that
for
environmental
reasons

am
said
somehow
i
competely
missed
your
review
when
you
first
made
it
i
saw
your
pics
on
brickshelf
and
wondered
about
the
review
you
have
managed
to
review
my
all
time
favourite
technic
set
yeah
somehow
i
wonderd
why
only
vbbn
thanks
responded
but
i
learned
from
yodas
sig
patience
for
a
jedi
it
is
time
to
eat
as
well
eat
eat
hot
good
food
d
simonwillems
said
it
was
the
first
large
technic
set
i
was
given
by
my
parents
when
it
first
came
out
in
1995
i
played
for
hours
with
this
set
making
minifig
seats
in
it
it
was
so
huge
there
was
room
for
four
minifigs
to
sit
next
to
eachother
in
front
i
made
various
applications
for
it
a
bungeejump
system
with
a
large
rubber
band
and
lots
of
containers
to
be
lifted
the
first
changes
i
made
included
the
inverting
of
the
wheels
and
the
disabling
of
one
of
the
flashlightsteering
wheels
because
they
obstructed
eachother
by
the
way
the
nob
for
your
winch
is
yellow
instead
of
black
i
know
this
set
by
heart
so
watch
out
p
i
always
liked
those
nobs
and
people
think
you
cant
play
moc
with
technic
at
all
xd
about
the
nob
erm
yeah
i
only
found
3
black
ones
in
the
box
and
so
i
took
the
yellow
one
that
i
got
as
an
extra
with
8829
simonwillems
said
the
alternate
model
was
great
fun
too
the
pump
is
cleverly
hidden
and
the
crane
folds
up
great
between
the
cab
and
the
loading
platform
you
could
easily
mod
it
with
a
pneumatic
claw
on
the
crane
a
motor
to
turn
it
and
a
compressor
the
only
flaw
was
the
loading
platform
which
had
no
floor
only
some
axles
another
reason
for
the
8460
as
favorite
set
its
got
a
real
alternate
model
not
just
a
different
erm
crane
simonwillems
said
thanks
so
much
for
reviving
my
memorie
concerning
this
great
set
youre
welcome
i
consider
this
as
my
job
cp5670
said

i

although

thats
the
spirit
i
got
more
than
hundred
boxes
and
my
8848
box
came
with
styrofoam
too
anger
the
woman
in
charge
and
thou
shall
have
no
dinner
great
review
the
sets
looks
good
and
the
retunr
of
the
tent
is
something
to
be
very
happy
about
and
also
those
giant
campattacking
ants
look
really
great
they
can
be
use
as
bugs

actually
they
are
ants
spiders
have
8
legs
while
ants
have
only
6
like
these
the
two
thing
that
look
like
legs
in
the
front
are
the
antennae
back
on
topic
i
think
this
set
looks
great
and
i
cant
wait
until
i
can
get
my
hands
on
it
and
the
other
new
ij
sets
they
must
be
ants
but
im
pretty
convinced
that
what
you
think
are
the
antennae
are
the
ants
mandibles
a
neat
little
set
front
another
great
review
alex
is
that
the
same
tentconstruction
as
the
tent
in
5978
sphinx
secret
surprise
id
buy
a
bunch
of
these
just
for
the
ants
to
make
an
ant
farm
i
also
like
the
bowl
cut
ok
i
think
its
a
nobrainer
that
this
is
a
musthave
for
pretty
much
anyone
who
likes
lego
its
cheap
and
a
great
minifigs
parts
pack
ill
be
getting
at
least
1
of
these
here
is
what
i
like
about
it
1
great
minifigs
with
nice
torsos
sweet
faces
and
awesome
hair
got
ta
ask
em
where
they
get
it
done
2
golden
katana
3
chicken
leg
yum
4
nice
campfire
and
this
is
what
i
dont
like
about
it
1
dark
bley
knife
seriously
they
could
have
at
least
made
it
silver
like
the
sword
if
not
chrome
2
rehashed
tent
3
spiders
with
6
legs
i
actually
dont
really
care
about
the
tent
and
the
multilegged
creatures
those
go
straight
into
the
sorting
boxes
perhaps
i
might
use
the
tent
someday
for
a
steampunk
moc
of
some
kind
or
a
stopmotion
film
or
maybe
some
kind
of
contest
anyway
whats
up
with
that
thing
that
holds
the
katana
the
sword
and
the
saber
its
in
the
airplane
set
too
is
it
perhaps
one
of
the
treasures
of
the
new
movie
or
is
it
something
indy
takes
with
him
everywhere
in
this
film

but
alex54
has
left
them
off
it
like
i
do
what
are
those

with
the

attached
supposed

on

am
said
yes
you
can
use
all
those
military
things
without
creating
an
army
in
a
layout
just
put
the
violent
parts
out
and
you
've
got
nice
things
like
a
biologist
car
in
the
case
of
the
amphibious
vehicle
without
the
gun
that
vehicle
is
a
nice
little
amphibious
car
with
a
tent
i
assume
strapped
to
it
some
tools
a
spare
tire
the
little
tree
hut
is
quite
cool
and
a
nice
touch
with
the
box
in
behind
there
i
love
the
design
for
those
gasoline
cans
too
thanks
again
alex
youre
lucky
to
be
getting
these
sets

did
you
get
the
sets
that
set
is
called
river
chase
this
is
a
great
set
i
love
the
amphibious
vehicle
with
all
the
darj
green
part
i
agree
with
you
that
the
the
dark
green
croc
is
fantastic
im
also
happy
to
have
a
dark
bley
zodiac
and
a
new
marion
torso
that
tree
hut
is
a
fun
feature
where
the
playability
doesnt
screw
the
design
i
really
love
the
commies
its
fun
how
lego
reuses
those
fleshie
heads
and
i
really
dont
mind
at
all
so
its
evil
for
evil
since
one
of
the
commie
has
the
zazi
face
i
also
love
the
ptrol
cans
ingenious
i
still
have
rants
on
that
set
why
oh
why
another
similar
indy
arghhh
i
cant
stand
it
why
oh
why
the
same
marion
head
cant
wait
to
have
those
sets
i
cant
wait
for
these
excellent
review
alex
thanks
for
sharing
i
cant
wait
to
buy
this
set
once
available
i
really
like
the
dark
green
leaf
pieces
i
like
the
cavetemple
which
will
look
great
in
my
jungle
diorama
blending
the
dark
green
and
light
green
works
well
for
the
vehicle
overall
a
neat
little
set
great
review
thanks
for
that
i
love
almost
everything
about
this
set
the
ants
commies
general
can
we
please
get
a
shot
of
his
face
dark
green
treads
foliage
and
other
creatures
great
stuff
ill
have
to
get
it
on
sale
though
batbrick
away
this
is
a
great
set
it
is
probably
my
favourite
indy
so
so
far
great
reveiw
although
the
set
is
great
the
price
is
greater
have
to
get
it
on
sale
wow
in
the
protype
pics
i
kept
thinking
this
thing
looked
lame
a
boat
on
treads
with
saw
blades
but
this
is
definetly
something
i
want
now
lots
of
great
plant
and
animal
parts
and
looks
like
plenty
of
wheels
with
those
treads
its
just
begging
to
be
made
into
a
propor
tank
thanks
for
the
review
alex
i
agree
that
this
is
the
best
set
of
kotcs
sets
although
the
airplane
comes
quite
close
although
im
not
too
fond
of
the
trees
the
cave
is
good
and
the
jungle
cutter
is
brilliant
plenty
of
great
features
and
very
detailed
with
much
of
the
engine
showing
and
a
decent
cockpit
if
thats
the
right
word
the
general
and
the
two
soviets
are
great
too
could
we
have
a
closeup
pic
of
them
please
good
to
see
that
neither
torso
has
exposed
fleshy
skin
like
the
nazis
as
said
though
it
is
quite
a
pricy
set
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
just
over
the
price
of
race
for
the
stolen
treasure
great
set
thanks
again
alex
here
some
closeup
pics
of
the
russian
soldiers
and
the
general
and
i
know
that
you
have
seen
that
i
dont
have
put
the
stickers
on
ahhhhh
now
this
swamp
vehicle
looks
great
to
me
when
i
first
heard
lego
were
making
it
i
was
worried
that
it
would
be
a
poor
version
however
im
pleased
to
see
that
its
not
even
though
im
not
a
great
fan
of
those
treads
the
trees
dont
really
add
anything
to
the
set
which
is
a
shame
still
the
parts
are
welcome
at
least
the
entrance
is
good
though
it
could
do
with
being
bigger
but
i
guess
we
can
moc
that
i
really
like
the
commie
general
he
looks
like
a
real
bad

said
whats
that
funky
name
lol
just
making
sure
your
yodaee
awesomeness
is
known
yep
indeed
and
i
have
that
set
if
i
remember
correctly
the
first
line
to
use
it
as
vegetation
is
aqua
raiders
tiger
shark
attack
7773
aha
it
was
in
aquaraiders
it
was
also
the
squids
intestines
or
whatever
lays
inside
his
baggy
head
why
its
just
a
flick
fire
missile
in
a
wrench
ill
use
my
brickarms
rgp
which
is
way
better
oh
yeah
i
forgot
that
ok
so
i
just
finished
reviewing
the
instructions
and
look
at
the
parts
you
need
to
just
change
the
horrendous
colours
damn
its
really
getting
worse
and
worse
ahh
thanks
im
definitely
changing
them
they
may
be
bearers
of
the
red
star
but
they
dont
need
red
lining
inside
their
vehicles
thanks
every
much
for
the
review
i
remember
having
this
set
and
making
really
terrible
stopmotion
movies
with
it
very
playable
this
brings
back
lots
of
fond
memories
thanks
majisto
on
this
was
the
last
castle
set
i
got
before
my
dark
age
really
liked
it
although
the
big
rock
parts
looked
really
bad
i
am
kind
of
used
to
them
now
unfortunately
i
lost
the
little
wand
and
i
never
understood
who
is
good
and
who
is
bad
does
the
wizard
own
the
dragon
well
they
dont
seem
to
be
enemies
but
isnt
the
dragon
supposed
to
be
evil
i
have
just
finished
building
this
set
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
with
the
amount
of
bricks
when
they
were
out
on
my
table
but
the
final
model
is
really
nice
and
totally
makes
up
for
that
i
like
the
small
details
like
on
the
handles
and
fuel
tank
and
the
only
real
negative
thing
i
can
say
is
that
the
cog
seems
a
bit
oversized
in
the
rear
i
dont
know
if
the
designer
frequents
this
forum
but
im
sure
he
will
be
happy
about
how
much
you
like
it
it
took
quite
some
timeprototypes
to
get
to
this
design
sorry
about
the
size
of
the
picture
it
isnt
mine

am
said
it
must
be
cold
in
that
room
nice
shirt
but
the
vertical
hold
is
broken
its
a
meeting
room
in
billund
the
temperature
is
usually
fine
there
according
to
my
memory
i
must
say
thats
a
nice
collection
of
motocross
bikes
the
employe
is
displaying
building
technic
is
such
a
specialist
dicipline
i
think
it
takes
a
lot
of
patience
to
finalize
the
design
of
a
model
even
such
a
relative
simpel
one
as
this
cute
bike
front
how
did
i
manage
to
miss
this
review
i
must
have
overlooked
it
somehow
thanks
for
making
this
one
sinner
its
always
nice
to
see
reviews
of
technic
sets
im
not
so
sure
whether
i
like
this
set
i
am
not
that
much
into
motorbikes
but
lego
did
a
good
job
on
this
one
it
looks
a
lot
like
an
upgraded
version
of
one
of
the
first
bikes
lego
made
namely
the
8838
shock
cycle
i
also
believe
the
back
gearwheel
is
somewhat
oversized
it
looks
better
with
the
smaller
one
you
attached
it
is
good
to
see
that
lego
is
back
to
making
the
technic
sets
the
way
they
were
except
for
the
green
that
is
thanks
for
the
review
i
bought
this
set
when
it
first
came
out
and
it
is
still
in
the
box
it
is
stuck
in
my
fairly
lengthly
backlog
but
after
seeing
your
review
ill
have
to
put
it
to
the
top
of
the
queue
thank
you
for
your
detailed
review
sinner
i
´
m
not
that
much
into
technic
building
because
i
´
m
lacking
the
inspiration
to
build
something
different
with
all
those
technic
elements
so
i
´
ll
pass
on
this
one
and
stay
to
classic
bricks
looks
like
an
interesting
set
i
didnt
realize
the
motor
controlled
two
functions
through
a
transmission
switch
thats
always
good
to
see
ill
probably
pass
it
up
though
until
the
price
falls
a
bit
the
overall
design
is
a
bit
too
studless
for
my
liking
i
think
the
8275
bulldozer
has
a
much
better
balance
of
studded
and
studless
pieces
and
the
wheels
somehow
look
too
small
to
me
i
also
have
something
of
a
backlog
at
the
moment
i
still
need
to
pick
up
that
bulldozer
along
with
the
8421
mobile
crane
on
ebay
wow
its
a
smarty
set
with
drive
shafts
we
are
everybody
and
technical
junk
the
specs
and
stuff
kind
of
lose
me
but
the
walrus
looks
really
cute
in
the
cherry
picker
i
imagine
hes
saving
a
kitten
but
really
this
is
a
great
review
and
has
a
wealth
of
detail
and
knowlege
for
techniphiles
thanks
for
providing
such
a
cool
resource
for
eb
i
really
did
enjoy
delving
in
to
the
world
of
technic
for
a
few
moments
the
walrus
rides
it
oh
hes
so
smart

i
own
both
already
i

i
tend
to

indiana
jones
temple
of
the
crystal
skull
pieces
929
price
aud14999
out
of
all
the
indy
4
sets
this
one
seems
to
cop
the
most
flak
which
may
account
for
the
fact
that
the
other
3
were
reviewed
weeks
ago
and
this
one
has
sat
unloved
and
alone
waiting
for
someone
to
turn
their
eye
upon
it
or
yknow
buy
it
luckily
im
a
sucker
for
spooky
old
temples
filled
with
devilish
traps
and
hidden
treasures
hissing
fountains
and
overgrown
foliage
creepy
skeletons
and
crumbling
stonework
so
here
it
is
indiana
jones
7627
temple
of
the
crystal
skull
part
1
the
figs
first
off
the
figs
6
humans
and
4
skellies
or
should
that
be
skullies
indy
mutt
irina
and
that
sneery
russian
guy
thats
in
the
2
smaller
sets
nothing
new
here
aha
what
have
we
here
two
natives
i
wonder
if
hair
is
a
sign
of
power
in
this
culture
since
one
guy
is
completely
bald
and
the
other
one
has
the
most
extraordinarily
luxurious
black
mullet
somehow
i
doubt
the
movie
will
answer
this
question
back
view
as
you
can
see
the
scalp
tattoos
are
also
popular
in
this
tribe
fashion
conscious
note
in
the
background
the
paws
of
the
fearsome
black
jungle
panther
ie
my
cat
curious
as
to
see
what
the
tribe
was
up
to
also
dont
ask
me
why
these
guys
are
carrying
axes
rather
than
say
spears
and
what
everyones
been
waiting
for
the
skullies
three
of
em
and
a
conquistador
skellie
very
cute
note
the
backs
of
the
crystal
head
have
a
plumesized
hole
or
maybe
thats
just
where
they
injected
the
blue
brainplastic
spooky
i
love
these
skulls
i
wasnt
sold
from
the
initial
pics
but
they
have
a
very
creepy
smile
and
the
head
shape
is
just
weird
with
the
large
eyes
its
kind
of
homer
simpsonesque
and
here
we
have
the
token
vehicle
in
the
set
a
weird
little
tank
thing
with
treads
kind
of
looks
like
a
cross
between
the
amphibious
boat
and
a
minitank
im
sure
theres
a
military
expert
around
here
who
can
tell
us
exactly
what
it
is
supposed
to
be
the
treads
are
nice
but
the
rest
of
it
is
a
bit
thrown
together
you
can
tell
they
wanted
to
keep
the
dark
green
colour
scheme
but
the
budget
only
allowed
them
5
parts
to
do
so
all
in
all
a
mixed
bag
with
the
figs
4
repeats
from
the
cheaper
sets
which
means
we
have
one
new
native
figure
and
the
crystal
skullies
there
are
heaps
of
the
oldskool
skele
heads
scattered
around
the
sets
so
those
that
prefer
can
replace
the
skullies
with
ordinary
skellies
bizarrely
the
top
of
the
box
which
has
the
line
of
11
figs
pic
you
know
what
i
mean
doesnt
have
names
for
any
of
the
characters
whereas
all
the
smaller
sets
do
part

this
set

come
under
criticism
for
being
overpriced
myself
included
but
the
official
piece
count
is
900
plus
which
is
pretty
good
considering
it
also
contains
the
baseplate

big
bags

the

baseplate
say
what
you
like
im
in
love
i
know
some
people
dont
like
these
but
they
were
such
a
staple
of
castle
pirates
for
so
many
years
that
i
dont
consider
them
a
juniorised
piece
at
all
this
one
recycled
from
the
05
police
hq
and
06
hospital
is
much
better
in
design
than
the
king
leos
castle
one
as
the
different
heights
and
asymmetry
make
it
look
much
more
like
a
natural
piece
of
ground
perfect
for
mocs
and
its
dark
tan
how
could
anyone
not
love
such
a
huge
slab
of
dark
tan
note
this
love
doesnt
extend
to
applying
the
stonework

are

crap

im
of
two
minds
about
this
i
kind
of
prefer
the
palette
to
be
a
bit
subtler
but
i
can
see
that
a
playset
designed
for
kids
isnt
going
to
sell
bucketloads
all
tastefully
done
in
shades
of
tan
with
lashings
of
darkgreen
foliage
theres
a
huge
amount
of
dark
red
in
this
set
which
is
always
a
welcome
colour
but
im
not
convinced
it
quite
works
with
the
2
shades
of
tan
on
offer
here
on
the
plus
side
theres
also
a
huge
amount
of
dark
tan
in
ordinary
2x2
bricks
tiles
plates
and
1x1
and
1x2x3
slopes
which
is
great
for
anyone
wanting
to
stock
up
lets
take
a
closer
look
ill
do
this
roughly
in
order
of
the
build
itself
a
the
big
scary
face
this
is
a
simple
fun
build
and
very
effective
at
projecting
menace
at
the
temple
entrance
it
actually
detaches
very
easily
from
the
temple
as
pictured
on
the
box
art
to
allow
easier
access
to
the
inside
the
eyes
are
flickfire
missiles
with
scary
faces
hair
conveniently
providing
ammo
refills
should
you
run
out
all
in
all
from
me
b
the
back
spin
the
skelly
head
and
stone
steps
appear
we
havent
seen
this
feature
in
a
while
nice
to
get
these
pieces
in
dark
bley
a
conquistador
hides
under
the
stairs
this
is
a
bit
useless
as
the
stairs
cant
fully
extend
while
hes
there
moving
right
a
trapdoor
what
could
possibly
be
behind
it
answer
not
much
really
a
little
red
stair
i
really
like
these
2
stickers
though
very
intricate
the
staircase
leads
to
what
i
like
to
think
of
as
the
crystal
skull
transmogrification
chamber
now
i
know
nothing
about
the
movie
except
that
its
supposed
to
be
have
a
kind
of
50s
bmovie
plot
rumoured
to
feature
look
away
spoilerhaters
aliens
these
weird
creepy
gold
chairs
look
made
from
the
bones
of
aliens
if
you
ask
me
with
their
strange
vertebrae
and
silver
claws
it
wouldnt
surprise
me
if
bringing
these
aliens
back
to
life
was
part
of
the
plot
of
the
movie
hence
the
crystal
skull
i
guess
well
find
out
may
22
in
any
case
transforming
aliens
clearly
like
a
disco
whirl
as
when
you
pull
the
handle
the
whole
of
this
assembly
spins
giddily
around
a
very
clever
and
simple
trick
its
basically
just
a
wheel
under
the
platform
but
the
effect
is
great
also
under
here
is
a
bottomless
pit
stickered
i
would
very
much
expect
a
villian
to
be
thrown
down
it
at
some
point
so
do
you
come
here
often
i
dont
know
who
designed
this
club
these
chairs
are
really
uncomfortable
nb
i
am
really
really
over
those
pearl
gold
1x2
roof
corner
slopes
which
started
popping
up
in
the
2006
castle
range
infected
exoforce
and
have
now
spread
here
can
we
please
have
these
in
a
different
colour
or
a
different
pearl
gold
piece
pretty
please
c
left
tower
looking
from
the
front
a
small
tower
with
a
trans
clear
gem
d
right
tower
waterfall
with
booby
trap
i
like
the
sticker
its
very
cartoony
which
fits
with
the
set
somehow
when
you
turn
the
wheel
flick
fire
missiles
spray
out
and
hit
whoever
is
on
the
stairs
both
towers
have
a
trap
where
if
you
move
the
skull
another
one
pops
out
from
the
dragon
mouth
e
central
turret
thing
this
thing
is
kind
of
annoying
and
doesnt
really
sit
or
work
well
its
kind
of
like
a
laser
beam
sending
messages
to
space
i
guess
as
the
central
dome
rises
the
two
plates
peel
away
i
find
it
is
a
little
bit
tight
to
work
smoothly
and
the
two
plates
doesnt
really
sit
well
together
at
the
top
maybe
i
just
need
to
rebuild
it
im
sure
this
will
also
be
explained
in
the
movie
f
final
trap
the
stair
that
isnt
there
the
final
trap
is
at
the
front
as
indy
goes
down
the
staircase
you
can
push
the
red
heads
and
all
the
1x8
bley
bricks
come
tumbling
down
simple
and
works
well
g
alternate
view
heres
how
it
looks
as
pictured
on
the
box
with
the
head
removed
as
you
can
see
this
allows
better
access
to
the
centre
of
the
temple
as
you
can
see
sadly
there
is
nothing
actually
interesting
there
except
a
staircase
to
the
turret
and
2
dark
tan
slopes
which
are
just
stuck
there
and
look
a
little
out
of
place
i
mean
come
on
everything
else
has
a
splash
of
dark
red
and
gold
your
destination
nowhere
part
4
in
conclusion
so
after
all
those
endless
pics
what
about
the
set
itself
consas
a
playset
7627
doesnt
quite
make
sense
admittedly
the
traps
that
are
there
are
welldesigned
and
unobtrusive
on
the
other
hand
theres
a
great
big
whopping
entrance
at
the
front
but
i
wasnt
sure
if
the
figs
are
supposed
to
sneak
in
through
the
backdoor
and
go
up
the
spiral
staircase
and
past
the
waterfall
as
shown
in
the
box
art
or
if
they
were
meant
to
end
up
in
the
golden
skull
room
the
middle
area
doesnt
really
connect
with
anything
nor
does
the
giant
space
turret
it
may
be
that
some
of
these
questions
are
answered
in
the
film
but
whereas
with
7624
7625
and
7626
i
could
at
least
picture
a
story
myself
eg
with
river
chase
is
fairly
obvious
whats
happening
a
chase
down
a
river
with
a
croc
and
a
communist
staking
them
out
the
temple
set
is
a
little
all
over
the
place
the
design
feels
a
little
off
to
me
not
really
bad
but
not
really
great
either
pros
on
the
plus
side
the
natives
and
crystal
skulls
themselves
are
great
at
900
pieces
this
is
also
a
great
parts
pack
for
dark
tan
dark
red
plant
pieces
gold
oddments
etc
i
especially
love
the
baseplate
in
that
shade
i
like
the
overall
shape
of
the
temple
a
big
staircase
with
secret
nooks
and
crannies
the
build
is
reasonably
interesting
and
there
are
some
clever
tricks
with
the
traps
but
upon
reflection
i
shouldnt
have
to
sell
this
set
it
should
be
able
to
sell
itself
as
i
said
before
im
a
huge
fan
of
dark
mysterious
old
temples
so
for
that
i
have
to
give
it
some
love
it
reminds
me
of
the
big
old
adventurers
sets
and
the
whiff
of
nostalgia
is
itself
a
powerful
intoxicant
however
for
the
price
lego
is
selling
it
in
australia
europe
canada
i
couldnt
recommend
it
as
a
mustbuy
for
full
price
when
the
smaller
sets
in
this
series
are
themselves
so
good
review
done
woo

i
was
really
hoping
that
the
conquistador
helmet
would
end
up
being
silver
in
the
final
set

i
suppose
its
good
to
know
that
the
helmet
is
being
porduced
again
anyway
and
is
the
armour
the
skellie
is
wearing
pearl
gold
hi
tinypiesrus
i
love
that

too
if

we

again
soon
hopefully
the

is

i
cant
wait
this
looks
like
a
great
set
for
me
at
least
i
too
am
a
great
fan
of
spooky
old
temples
they
are
such
fun
i
love
the
look
of
the
base
plate
but
the
stickers
dont
look
all
that
great
i
wish
they
printed
it
like
they
always
used
too
i
have
to
get
this
set
and
the
other
ones
too
thanks
again
you
have
brightened
this
sad
day
outstanding
review
your
efforts
have
totally
convinced
me
to
get
this
set
no
matter
what
it
really
looks
very
great
and
funz
reading
that
review
i
will
be
looking
forward
to
the
new
addition
of
those
minifigs
just
love
the
layout
of
this
temple
a
great
addition
indeed
nice
big
set
thanks
for
the
review
the
skellies
seem
to
me
as
the
only
really
big
plus
of
the
whole

agree
on
the
homer
simpsons
paternity
to
them

great
review
now
im
really
truly
convinced
that
im
gon
na
buy
this
set
my
faith
was
a
little
wobbly
but
its
benn
restored
anyway
i
just
wanted
to
point
out
that
the
temples
entrance
might
actually
be
the
turret
thing
if
you
watch
the
teaser
there
are
some
very
similair
stone
pillars
surrounded
by
sand
there
are
4
not
2
though
and
when
they
close
up
it
looks
like
all
our
characters
are
sucked
into
the
sand
and
magically
appear
underground
going
through
some
stone
plateswhich
act
like
steps
to
go
down
that
dissapear
so
in
theory
those
steps
beneath
the
turret
are
actualy
the
entrance
and
im
asumming
from
this
picture
that
the
steps
with
1x8
bricks
with
the
dragon
heads
at
the
end
lead
us
of
somewhere
else
all
in
all
this
temple
looks
like
a
mixed
up
version
of
the
real
temple
which
is
fine
by
me
sidenote
im
not
sure
but
based
on
minifig
inclusion
either
lego
was
cheap
or
colonel
dovchenko
is
dead
by
the
time
irina
and
her
goons
reach
the
temple
ill
wait
till
i
see
the
movie

absolute
hogwash
i
wouldnt
trust
anyone
on
a
forum
ive
never
heard
of
i
dont
believe
theyd
cancel
it
its
still
on
sh
right
well
the
people
there
are
quite
trustfull
but
i
looked
now
on
shophome
and
7624
i
posted
the
wrong
number
sorry
is
only
available
in
canada
and
the
united
states
so
i
hope
its
not
an
exclusive
thats
awesome
im
going
to
my
local
tru
today
to
see
if
i
can
find
the
two
smaller
sets
i
know
that
alex54
had
already
reviewed
this
set
beforehand
but
i
wanted
to
give
my
2
cents
it
is
really
more
like
150
on
this
set
i
bought
from
toys
r
us
on
friday
guess
what
the
price
had
not
been
increased
by
a
dollar
like
all
other
sets
this
is
my
first
review
of
a
set
ever
dont
be
too
mean
1
box
it
captures
the
potential
i
dont
know
how
the
scene
plays
out
for
now
action
of
the
scene
nicely
and
is
very
pleasing
good
job
tlc
on
the
back
it
shows
some
of
the
play
features
of
the
set
and
a
net
little
comic
indiana
jones
seems
to
be
surprisingly
calm
considering
that
he
is
about
to
be
captured
under
a
net
and
attacked
by
a
snake
the
thing
he
fears
most
1a
comic
not
much
to
say
on
this
1b
screw
up
at
the
top
of
the
box
both
russian
guards
have
the
same
grining
face
in
the
set
one
has
the
generic
bad
guy
face
from
7620

contents
the
box
opens
up
to
reveal
a

of

an

dss
yoda
said
every
for
of
rambling
imaginable
about
this
accursed
item
i
have
nothing
to
say
meh
3
minifigs
the
only
thing
that
has
not
really
been
discussed
about
the
figs
that
you
get
in
this
set
is
that
marion
has
a
slightly
new
torso
4
parts
of
interest
when
i
opened
up
the
baggies
these
were
the
components
that
grabbed
my
attention
a
dark
green
alligator
a
net
piece
that
i
know
has
appeared
in
sets
before
hand
i
needed
it
for
a
moc
i
am
working
on
some
raft
part
that
is
probably
very
old
a
ladder
with
two
pairs
of
hindges
and
a
dark
brown
version
of
this
part
4
build
amphibious
vehicle
this
i
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
builds
of
the
new
line
but
that
is
just
my
opinion
you
start
of
with
some
thing
very
simple
by
the
end
of
the
next
page
it
starts
to
bulk
up
more
detail
beginning
to
look
like
a
car
4a
build
rear
attachment
bulk
it
up
and
add
taillights
done
slap
it
on
to
the
main
vehicle
4b
build
front
attachment
i
am
running
out
of
things
to
say
bulk
it
up
add
some
detail
add
a
gun
and
headlights
and
attach
to
the
rest
to
get
the
completed
vehicle
add
stickers
i
honestly
think
that
the
amphibious
vehicle
looks
much
better
with
the
stickers
than
without
5
build
boat
this
build
goes
by
rather
quickly
and
adds
to
the
playability
of
the
final
set
base
apply
clamps
add
more
to
engine
build
more
detail
and
a
gun
base
finished
boat
plus
stickers
i
love
how
lego
slips
in
the
product
number
into
their
stickers
6
build
tree
fort
this
is
the
weakest
part
of
the
whole
set
but
i
find
my
self
liking
it
more
and
more
for
some
odd
and
inexplicable
reason
that
tan
6x6
will
most
likely
see
use
in
a
pirate
themed
vinigete
soon
not
mine
install
netlauncher
you
spend
the
next
two
pages
building
this
and
putting
it
on
a
tree
branch
that
is
an
ugly
mix
of
brown
dark
brown
and
frown
our
commie
friend
seems
to
like
coffee
a
lot
second
branch
3rd
a
wee
bit
to
much
on
the
coffee
there
dont
you
think
final
step
the
only
redeeming
value
of
this
section
is
how
well
the
net
launcher
works
fantastically
the
rest
is
just
utter
fail
7
spare
parts
very
little
in
terms
of
what
is
left
over
finished
set
all
in
all
this
set
is
a
fine
build
and
an
excellent
parts
pack
for
dark
green
components
i
recommend
this
set
strongly
despite
its
few
weaknesses
nice
review
got
this
set
yesterday
and
u
have
to
say
that
amphibious
vehicle
rocks
goodthorough
review
some
of
the
pictures
were
a
bit
blurry
though
thank
you
for
the
nice
indepth
review
i
have
to
say
lego
did
a
good
job
on
the
amphibious
vehicle
ps
if
you
need
photo
taking
help
pm
me
and
i
can
give
you
some
handy
tips
very
good
for
a
first
review
i
bought
this
set
and
jungle
duel
at
target
the
other
day
i
was
going
to
wait
and
buy
them
when
i
go
to
downtown
disney
this
summer
but
how
could
i
pass
up
saving
four
bucks
that
i
can
spend
on
storeexclusives
and
i
have
to
say
i
absolutely
love
them
the
amphibious
vehicle
dont
they
call
it
a
duck
in
the
movie
is
definitely
my
favorite
lego
vehicle
ive
ever
built
everything
about
it
is
wonderful
the
size
the
colour
scheme
and
its
accurate
to
the
one
in
the
movie
and
irina
spalkos
hair
is
to
die
for
on
a
side
note
i
dont
get
why
they
made
marions
arms
white
in
the
set
the
shirt
underneath
her
vest
in
the
movie
is
obviously
blue
i
switched
the
arms
out
for
light
blue
ones
and
it
looks
a
lot
better
and
it
makes
marions
eyes
look
great
ryan
an
extremely
thorough
review
you
definitely
do
this
set
justice
looks
like
a
fairly
interesting
set
and
that
comes
from
someone
who
isnt
particularly
a
fan
of
lego
indiana
jones
tom
what
a
fantastic
set
im
overwelmed
with
feelings
of
nostalgia
by
seeing
this
review
the
playability
factor
of
this
set
is
as
high
as
it
can
be
thanks
for
making
and
sharing
this
awesome
review
thanks
for
this
review
you
have
reviewed
my
most
favourite
town
set
of
all
times
i
am
so
happy
to
own
this
one
i
actually
is
a
story
to
go
along
with
it
in
the
summer
of
1998
i
went
on
holiday
with
my
parents
to
the
country
of
luxembourg
in
the
city
of
wiltz
we
encountered
a
small
toystore
which
still
had
this
set
for
sale
9
years
after
the
release
i
did
not
had
the
sufficient
amount
of
money
to
buy
the
set
and
had
to
leave
it
at
the
store
i
was
practically
in
tears
four
years
later
we
passed
through
luxembourg
and
i
remembered
the
city
and
the
store
we
made
a
detour
and
stopped
by
the
same
store
every
other
old
set
was
sold
the
only
one
remaining
was
this
one
i
bought
it
immediately
and
treasured
it
ever
since
i
use
the
baseplates
a
lot
in
my
cities
they
serve
well
as
roads
with
parking
spaces
next
to
them
this
was
the
first
set
i
owned
which
had
the
huge
6x24
plates
in
them
i
remember
my
surprise
when
seeing
plates
of
such
enourmous
lenght
i
recently
made
an
entire
racetrack
together
with
this
set
and
to
promote
myself
i
will
place
a
link
here
metalandi
thanks
for
this
wonderful
lovely
review
i
enjoyed
myself
very
much
when
i
am
looking
through
at
the
lovely
pictures
i
must
admit
this
is
what
i
called
a
real
classic
race
prix
i
miss
those
cute
sweet
little
race
cars
which
is
able
to
contain
a
minifig
furthermore
this
set
offers
4
race
cars
and
13
minifigures
in
addition
if
town
collectors
remember
the
car
number
tiles
are
printed
instead
of
using
stickers
this
is
the
other
set
i
owned
which
holds
the
similarity
above

am
nice
reveiw
i
would
fork
out
100
aud
for
that
set
its
just
so
bueatiful
if
only
tlg
rereleased
this
wow
simon
you
got
two
yummy
awesome
review
batbrick
i
dont
see
any
appeal
at
all
really
in
this
set
but
thats
okay
as
i
want
to
stick
to
castle
anyway
the
car
is
the
best
part
imo
which
you
can
get
in
a
different
set
with
another
cool
car
and
for
a
cheaper
price
but
the
main
downfall
to
this
set
is
the
fact
that
the
trucks
trailer
is
half
blown
up
and
the
survivors
are
magically
staying
inside
and
not
being
sucked
right
out
of
there
as
you
have
mentioned
i
would
have
thought
tlc
would
at
least
included
some
sort
of
cover
that
you
could
take
on
and
off
easily
kind
of
like
the
modular
buildings
having
said
all
that
though
the
front
of
the
truck
does
look
incredibly
cool
and
those
minifigs
are
sweet
too
bad
they
all
have
flesh
tone
printed
on
them
so
while
this
may
not
be
my
set
of
choice
i
can
see
the
appeal
well
really
i
cant
but
its
just
my
opinion
im
sure
there
are
plenty
others
who
would
love
to
scoop
this
set
up
peace
warning
this
reply
may
contain
several
minor
movie
spoilers
if
you
havent
yet
seen
the
movie
and
want
it
to
be
a
complete
surprise
do
not
read
batbrick

am
said
but
it
is
cruncher
block
his
lady
driver
taejo
that
really
shine
look
at
those
awesome
suits
the
cool
faces
taejo
has
a
ripped
shirt
i
was
originally
skepitcal
about
the
driver
figure
--
i
like
the
head
but
i
was
trying
to
figure
out
why
they
put
in
a
female
minifig
with
no
hairpiece
after
having
seen
the
movie
i
now
understand
why
crunchers
driver
is
a
fairly
manly
looking
woman
and
most
of
the
lego
hairpeices
would
make
the
minifig
look
too
girly
for
the
character
now
that
i
know
why
taejos
shirt
is
ripped
up
i
dont
mind
the
bits
of
fleshie
color
that
are
printed
on
it
but
i
do
wish
they
would
make
some
of
the
new
torsos
a
little
more
headcolour
agnostictheres
no
real
reason
why
cruncher
and
his
driver
couldnt
have
had
ties
that
came
all
the
way
up
to
their
necks
instead
of
having
those
little
wedges
of
flesh
showing
through
loose
collars
yeah
they
are
lowlevel
mafioso
type
scum
but
they
arent
complete
slobs

front
view
the
new
windshields
are
fantastic
they
are
indeed
very
nice
its
the
main
reason
i
started
looking
at
the
speed
racer
sets
in
the
first
place
batbrick
on
may
10 2008 0605
am
said
while
a
very
cool
car
it
is
rather
silly
of
tlc
to
give
us
the
exact
same
one
we
got
in
the
smaller
set
i
didnt
get
the
smaller
set
with
this
car
so
im
still
happy
but
it
is
a
bad
marketing
move
i
think
the
error
they
made
was
in
the
smaller
set
though
in
the
movie
the
only
time
we
see
crunchers
semi
is
when
hes
being
chased
by
racer
x
racer
x
and
taejo
do
end
up
on
the
same
team
for
a
cross
country
rally
race
along
with
speed
of
course
so
i
guess
thats
where
they
were
going
by
putting
those
two
together
in
the
smaller
set
but
it
would
have
been
much
more
interesting
for
them
to
have
made
up
a
set
with
taejo
and
one
of
the
cars
from
the
very
goofy
comic
bookgimmicky
teams
they
are
racing
against
especially
since
one
of
the
teams
that
is
chasing
taejo
specifically
is
a
bunch
of
armywannabee
loonies
--
im
sure
more
people
would
have
loved
some
sort
of
darksand
green
racer
with
one
of
the
ij
soviets
at
the
wheel
than
another
racer
x
to
summarize
two
racer
xs
is
bad
but
it
is
the
smaller
set
that
should
have
been
changed
imho
batbrick
on
may
10 2008 0605
am
said
annoyingly
enough
this
part
opens
up
to
shoot
a
pointless
rubber
projectile
thus
blowing
the
front
part
open
and
launching
itwell
not
far
really
as
much
as
i
normally
dont
like
the
stupid
techic
launcher
thing
and
would
rather
not
see
it
in
a
set
ever
again
although
one
of
these
days
i
will
make
a
giant
multilauncer
rig
out
of
them
just
for
fun
at
least
there
is
a
reason
for
it
to
be
in
this
set
as
crunchers
semi
has
a
missile
launcher
in
the
front
end
of
it
in
the
movie
i
think
youre
supposed
to
lift
the
panel
that
hides
the
missile
before
launching
it
similar
to
the
way
that
panels
slide
out
of
the
way
on
the
semi
cab
to
allow
for
firing
in
the
movie
batbrick
on
may
10 2008 0605
am
said
and
now
for
the
most
disappointing
part
step
three
the
trailer
thats
right
almost
the
entire
thing
is
open
even
the
filled
in
side
has
holes
id
certainly
be
cared
to
be
back
there
one
bumpy
hill
and
back
you
go
im
gon
na
chock
this
up
to
the
standard
lego
philosophy
of
playset
rather
than
model
design
for
a
lot
of
things
the
semi
rig
and
raver
xs
car
are
the
models
the
trailer
is
the
playset
seeing
as
how
the
trailer
is
crunchers
mobile
office
rather
finely
appointed
with
lots
of
paintings
and
his
pirahna
babies
in
their
tank
behind
his
desk
and
the
intent
seems
more
or
less
to
have
a
playest
bit
in
order
for
kids
to
reenact
the
scene
from
the
movie
im
not
going
to
give
them
too
much
grief
over
this
they
tried
to
capture
the
basic
bits
of
the
movie
set
which
we
see
mostly
from
the
inside
during
the
movie
and
translate
it
into
a
playset
type
environment
that
being
said
i
do
wish
the
back
walls
were
more
solid
as
i
see
no
reason
for
there
to
be
gaps
in
the
back
wall
when
the
front
wall
or
the
fourth
wall
as
the
case
may
be
here
is
already
conspicously
absent
batbrick
on
may

am
said
there
are
some
pluses
too
though
like
the
ridiculously
awesome
minifig
paintings
ill
be
using
for
wayne
manor
also
note
the
control
on
crunchers
desk
that
when
turned
turns
the
gun
at
the
bottom
its
an
alright
feature
could
have
been
a
little
better
but
its
such
a
minor
bit
of
this
scene
in
the
movie
that
i
can
see
why
they
didnt
spend
too
much
time
and
effort
on
it
it
would
have
been
nice
to
have
more
paintings
though
had
the
back
wall
been
more
complete
and
i
like
your
idea
of
how
to
use
them
batbrick
on
may
10 2008 0605
am
said
and
though
im
not
a
massive
fan
of
stickers
this
is
just
too
cool
the
little
aquarium
is
very
simple
but
very
clever
using
a
printed
piece
between
two
clear
windows
to
create
the
illusion
of
a
tank
definately
a
feature
which
is
not
showcased
nearly
well
enough
on
the
box
art
since
it
is
one
of
the
major
features
of
this
set
in
the
movie
its
nice
to
see
it
translate
rather
well
into
brick

design
25
pretty
poor
considering
the
best
part
is
available
in
a
cheaper
set
and
only
the
front
part
of
the
truck
looks
cool
but
still
not
truly
awful
that
may
be
a
bit
harsh
but
not
much
given
what
ive
said
further
up
this
post
but
it
probably
only
deserves
a
3
at
best
so
im
not
realy
going
to
quibble
the
point
i
still
think
that
racer
x
should
be
exclusive
to
this
set
and
a
different
car
should
be
in
the
smaller
set
with
taejo
which
would
have
improved
the
cachet
for
this
set
overall

price
25
overpriced
easily
but
rogue
shadow
is
worse
truethis
should
have
ideally
been
about
a
30
set
especially
given
the
general
awesomeness
of
the
ij
race
for
the
stolen
treasure
set
unless
they
made
the
trailer
a
bit
more
detailed
better
back
wall
perhaps
some
drop
down
gun
ports
like
in
the
movie
or
at
put
least
one
or
more
of
crunchers
goons
in
the
set
then
maybe
i
could
agree
more
with
the
msrp
on
that
note
if
i
remember
correctly
from
my
visit
to
my
local
tru
yesterday
in
search
of
the
new
ij
sets
since
local
targets
seem
determined
not
to
get
them
in
stock
yet
they
had
this
set
on
sale
for
around
35
along
with
an
offer
for
a
coupon
good
for
750
towards
the
purchase
of
a
ticket
to
the
movie
with
any
speed
racer
toy
purchase
over
25
i
may
be
wrong
on
the
sale
price
but
i
know
the
ticket
offer
was
there
so
if
you
havent
seen
the
movie
yet
and
are
interested
in
this
set
tru
may
be
the
place
to
go
right
now
to
get
both
at
a
slightly
cheaper
price

fun
45
the
mere
concept
of
such
an
open
truck
kept
me
playing
with
this
baby
for
hours
so
you
did
enjoy
the
playest
aspect
of
the
trailer
even
though
you
didnt
care
for
the
designlooks
like
they
didnt
do
too
badly
then
on
what
they
wanted
out
of
that
bit
batbrick
on
may

am

overall
im
really
glad
i
bought
it
as
the
minifigs
are
fantastic
and
the
paintings
and
fish
tank
are
cool
its
fun
stupid
and
downright
ridiculous
but
while
not
a
great
set
by
any
means
certainly
isnt
as
bad
in
the
brick
as
it
looks
in
photos
i
was
actually
thinking
about
going
and
getting
this
set
now
that
ive
seen
the
movie
and
i
understand
what
the
heck
is
going
on
here
more
your
review
has
definately
added
an
additional
impetus
to
that
notion
my
pocketbook
does
not
thank
you
thanks
for
that
fine
review
batbrick
the
most
interesting
part
of
the
set
for
me
are
the
neat
mfs
the
trailer
looks
really
pretty
skeletal
however
it
´
s
a
nice
little
play
set
and
´
ll
fit
its
purpose
i
guess
nice
review
good
pictures
thanks
i
think
i
may
get
a
couple
of
the
smaller
sets
as
i
think
these
will
become
collectors
sets
in
years
too
come
not
sure
this
range
will
be
that
popular
love
the
minifigs
though
thanks
for
the
great
review
it
seems
like
the
most
awesome
part
of
the
set
is
the
sticker
sheet
which
is
a
reversal
of
the
usual
situation
nice
reviewim
surprised
these
are
out
already
ill
probably
end
up
passing
on
this
one
even
with
the
surprise
that
is
a
very
nice
and
quick
review
thanks
for
giving
us
a
quick
summary
not
much
comments
on
this
set
as
i
do
not
really
go
into
batman
theme
yet
however
the
ice
cream
truck
in
the
set
interest
me
apart
from
that
nothing
much
yet
who
knows
maybe
i
will
change
my
mind
in
the
future
mustget
oh
wait
is
that
torso
dark
grey
or
light
grey
great
review
as
always
although
i
know
you
dont
take
many
pictures
in
your
reviewsimho
but
can
we
see
a
little
more
about
the
tumbler
is
that
little
windshield
down
near
the
bottom
front
a
third
seat
what
is
in
the
framework
of
the
back
behind
the
cockpit
i
know
theres
a
blunt
shooter
and
flick
fire
missiles
but
is
it
all
framework
thanks
a
lot
for
the
review
brickbitz
i
really
love
this
set
sure
the
figs
are
annoyingly
not
new
but
the
ice
cream
truck
is
fantastic
and
the
tumbler
is
a
marvel
of
black
slopes
i
see
now
that
it
is
far
too
huge
though
i
reckon
i
will
either
keep
it
that
way
as
a
mega
tumbler
mod
it
to
become
another
battank
keep
it
as
a
model
tumbler
or
pull
it
apart
and
use
the
bits
to
make
a
tumbler
like
wetwires
awesome
one
love
those
popsicles
though
and
those
wheels
are
very
nice
so
overall
as
a
loyal
batfan
i
love
the
set
even
though
it
couldve
been
better
batbrick
away
a
nice
review
of
an
interesting
set
thanks
brickbitz
a
great
new
batman
a
funny
ice
cream
truck
and
a
pretty
detailed
tumbler
and
although
i
wish
that
vehicle
would
be
just
a
bit
smaller
i
almost
wonder
that
it
´
s
not
even
bigger
compared
to
tlc
´
s
other
batvehicles
and
well
the
interior
could
be
better
too

ill
get
some
set
up
tomorrow
in
better
light
to
be
honest
there
isnt
a
lot
to
see
most
of
it
is
just
basic
technic
blocks
underneath
with
all
the
slopes
built
up

some
more

of
the

hey

i
love
how
your
review
is
not

10
ups
in
the
end
you
said
overall
slightly
disappointing
most
people
post
reviews
only
with
praise
but
im
glad
you
take
both
sides
enjoyed
the
review
just
like
others
have

so
much
thanks
so
much
dunamis
for
your
awesome
review
yeah
i
think
tlc
miss
the
cape
it
would
be
cool
to
own
one
but
when
we
were
talking
of
the
2008
sets
around
july
of
last
year
i
can
remember
someone
said
it
would
come
with
cape
finally
is
a
little
dissapoint
tlc
miss
it

studs
which
make
his
face
look
eerily
alive
and
very
close
to
his
screen
appearance
its
a
nice
little
detail
that
seems
to
not
show
through
on
pictures
ive
seen
of
the
set
the
legs
are
a
little
wobbly
im
scared
that
hell
be
leaning
too
far
forward
in
about
5
years
sure
ill
get
a
few
photos
tonight
and
post
them
the
eyes
are
a
nice
effect
you
are
right
about
the
legs
as
the
model
does
wobble
a
little
i
forgot
to
mention
that
the
base
does
turn
which
is
another
nice
feature
thanks
for
this
very
detailed
review
dunamis
didnt
think
that
gg
were
that
big
he
looks
pretty
good
to
me
but
ill
save
the
90
$
for
the
upcoming
cw
sets
ok
here
are
a
couple
of
shots
of
the
head
and
eyes

very
nice
effect

in
his
ribcage

carry
on
awesome
review
dunamis
thats
such
a
sweet
set
i
loved
it
as
soon
as
i
thoroughly
examined
the
online
instructions
it
looks
way
awesome
in
the
brick
my
favourite
part
has
to
be
the
eyes
very
cool
and
creepy
thanks
again
for
the
info
and
of
course

am
said
luckily
for
me
i
have
access
to
the
internet
to
read
this
review
in
the
first
place
lol
i
was
wondering
if
anyone
would
get
my
lame
attempt
at
humor
an
excellent
review
with
superb
presentation
dunamis
when
the
time
comes
i
hope
your
able
to
get
your
hands
on
the
other
new
sw
sets
and
review
them
just
as
good
thanks
for
the
great
review
sad
to
say
as
cool
as
he
looks
hes
a
saleonly
set
for
me
the
walker
reminds
me
of
the
old
kenner
cap2
captivator
which
is
good
thanks
very
much
for
the
review
brickbitz
i
love
this
years
mars
mission
line
and
though
this
is
the
weakest
set
it
is
still
a
major
improvement
the
mech
is
very
cool
and
well
made
and
the
commander
is
one
of
my
favourite
alien
figs
ever
the
alien
ship
is
pretty
good
better
than
last
years
ones
but
not
extremely
good
either
but
i
still
like
the
set
batbrick
away
thanks
for
the
sweet
review
brickbitz
that
really
is
a
neat
little
set
that
walker
is
fantastic
most
likely
the
best
part
of
the
set
though
the
alien
craft
does
also
look
neat
and
its
cool
how
it
can
fold
down
into
aa
walker
or
rather
a
sentry
turret
seeing
as
it
cant
really
move
while
in
that
mode
still
its
nice
my
favourite
part
is
the
mini
mining
robot
though
so
cute
peace
thanks
for
that
interesting
review
brickbitz
the
alien
fighter
looks
pretty
nice
nothing
special
but
streamlined
and
fast
nevertheless
that
transforming
feature
´
s
a
nice
addition
for
sure
and
these
new
flicker
missile
with
its
launch
apparatus
hmm
i
hope
i
won
´
t
spend
quite
some
time
in
search
of
that
little
rocket
piece
however
there
´
s
still
something
i
miss
with
these
alien
crafts
i
don
´
t
know
i
like
some
more
organic
looking
design
and
they
even
come
in
some
nice
and
different
shapes
but
still
perhaps
a
real
space
fighter
just
needs
a
solid
cockpit
cool
windscreens
and
controls
to
satisfy
my
odd
likings
that
exo
suit
looks
really
good
and
i
wonder
why
it
´
s
a
little
underrepresented
on
the
box
art
the
jet
packspace
scooter
´
s
a
really
good
idea
and
the
only
thing
i
hate
´
re
those
darned
studless
technic
beams
it
could
look
so
much
better
with
a
studded
version
of
these
parts
but
of
course
that
´
s
only
due
to
my
personal
preferences
thanks
for
the
review
im
looking
forward
to
some
of
the
new
parts
and
ideas
in
this
line
the
figures
look
great
the
actual
sets
themselves
dont
really
appeal
though
huhm
i
like
the
idea
of
the
agentid
but
offcourse
all
they
want
with
that
is
that
you
buy
all
six
sets
but
it
can
be
a
good
idea
for
children
they
wouldnt
think
of
hey
they
get
all
money
only
because
i
have
a
little
card
with
stars
or
something
well
not
to
rant
i
think
its
good
also
can
you
make
that
name
yourself
maybe
set
5
comes
with
a
extra
stickersheed
with
all
letters
that
would
be
nice
agent
rupee
a
very
nice
review
oky
wan
kenobi
rupee
i
kind
of
like
the
set
as
said
it
has
a
very
cartoonish
style
to
it
so
im
guessing
the
kids
are
going
to
love
it
and
as
a
parent
ill
love
it
if
the
construction
isnt
to
fragile
ill
probably
be
getting
a
few
for
myself
but

and
the
excaustpipe
is
a
new
peace
also
i
think
yeah
and
its

over
this
years
releases
from
what
ive
seen
so
far
its
found
in

speed
racers
mars
mission
and
exoforce
sets
i
just
wish
that
instead
of
a
2x1
plate
with
an
exhaustpipe
in
each
end
they
would
have
made
it
an
1x1
plate
with
a
single
exhaust
that
would
have
been
a
lot
more
useful
great
reviewthank
youvery
much
i
think
this

is
much
more
promising
than
most
orginally
thought
it
would

find

right
now
that
would

i
want

please
im
not

its
pretty

the

that

the

with

wow
this
is
a
funny
set
but
its
a
little
expensive
and
a
little

small
but
i
like
some
pieces
like
the
fire
and
the
mr

and
the
best
of
all
here
it
comes
no
stickers
thats
one
of
the
greatest
things
but
i
understand
why
lego
has
made
this
set
some
people
want
batman
lego
and
they
are
most
of
the
time
expensive
and
the
mr

is
also
expensive
but
this

not
if
you

you
msut
ask

like

pretend
this

never

the

is
indeed
terrible
the

and
hes
flatulent
this
third

isnt
really
doing
anything
for
me
ill
get
the
penguin
set
as
well
for
pretty
much
the
same
reason
although
the
sub
on
that
is
pretty
cool
but
skip
the
others
maybe
batbrick
can
make
us
all
nice
altmocs
to
improve
these
sets
thanks
for
the
review
though
hollisbrick
on

pm
said
thanks
for
the
reveiw
the
figs
are
bloody
great
but
those
cars
are
a
bit
well
ill
put
it
blantly
retarded
although
they
shall
be
good
after
some
modding
and
whats
with
that
grapple
hook
does
it
even
have
a
rope
so
i
guess
batman
will
hokk
it
to
mr
freeze
so
his
ride
looks
more
ugle
anyway
can
you
pleese
take
some
pics
of
the
figs
ill
do
and
do
someone
also
another
review
of
the
7888
the
tumbler
thank
you
the
riddler
for
this
highly
informative
review
despite
the
fact
that
i
still
consider
it
to
be
one
of
the
weakest
sets
in
all
batman
line
i
guess
that
now
i
may
even
get
more
than
one
of
these
for
the
same
reasons
as
batbrick
good
day
gentlemen
thanks
for
the
review
this
set
was
poorly
design
when
i
first
heard
of
it
i
think
it
was
like
a
car
with
a
much
better
design
than
this
one
i
think
i
will
get
it
for
the
minifigs
thanks
for
the
extra
pics
i
dont
think
you
could
have
gone
into
much
more
detail
than
that
nice
pics
of
the
joker
van
too
will
you
do
a
review
of
that
one
batbrick
away
coming
in
at
around
50
us
turbo
car
chase
is
one
of
the
bigger
of
the
new
agents
sets
a
big
box
with
a
helicopter
car
and
gate
in
it
seems
like
a
winner
but
how
good
is
it
really
and
is
it
worth
the
cash
lets
start
with
the
minifigs
this
set
comes
with
a
standard
inferno
henchman
spy
clops
and
agent
chase
the
henchman
is
you
basic
lego
criminal
type
with
a
gun
and
a
jumpsuit
nothing
real
groundbreaking
here
spy
clops
on
the
other
hand
is
very
cool
for
technically
half
of
a
minifig
his
head
has
a
neat
electronic
goggle
print
and
the
rest
of
him
is
a
torso
mounted
onto
a
set
of
six
legs
made
from
exoforce
robot
arms
the
whole
thing
is
really
well
done
and
neat
as
hell
agent
chase
turbo
car
chase
seems
to
have
a
standard
agent
body
and
a
doubleprinted
face
with
one
side
a
sunglasses
and
headset
print
the
other
face
is
a
determined
agent
look
the
set
also
includes
a
laptop
with
doctor
inferno
wallpaper
the
laptop
is
a
new
piece
and
works
like
the
lego
books
that
are
in
a
lot
of
harry
potter
sets
molding
on
the
keyboard
is
really
well
done
and
the
thing
can
be
held
by
a
minifig
along
either
corner
but
not
in
the
middle
and
not
while
closed
the
gate
in
the
set
is
nothing
revolutionary
by
itself
and
i
sort
of
get
the
feeling
that
it
was
included
to
drive
up
the
piece
count
and
the
set
price
point
that
being
said
there
are
some
things
to
like
here
for
instance
the
gate
has
four
wheels
of
barbed
wire
attached
to
it
the
barbed
wire
is
new
and
makes
me
want
to
start
building
some
world
war
i
trench
mocs
the
rest
of
the
gate
is
fairly
big
and
it
has
a
handy
ramp
attached
so
that
vehicles
can
roll
through
it
easily
the
main
feature
of
the
gate
is
a
sound
brick
its
much
better
then
lego
sound
and
light
units
of
the
past
when
the
gate
is
opened
it
depresses
a
button
and
an
alert
klaxon
blares
that
sounds
every
bit
like
a
prisonbeak
in
progress
the
triggering
action
works
surprisingly
well
and
its
pretty
much
for
this
feature
alone
that
im
not
going
to
immediately
break
the
gate
back
down
and
add
it
to
my
parts
bin
the
designers
did
make
an
effort
to
create
more
then
just
a
fence
though
a
nice
control
panel
connected
to
a
big
spotlight
crowns
the
piece
and
a
pair
of
cameras
watch
the
opening
its
really
hard
to
mess
up
a
lego
helicopter
and
this
set
is
no
exception
the
inferno
chopper
is
a
nicely
proportioned
and
well
built
machine
it
looks
properly
menacing
and
has
the
uniform
orange
and
black
of
other
inferno
property
its
armed
with
a
set
of
four
technic
pegs
cleverly
used
as
guns
on
outriding
mounts
as
well
as
a
pair
of
the
newerstyle
flickfire
missiles
i
personally
dont
care
for
flickfiring
missiles
but
these
look
decent
enough
and
seem
to
stay
put
so
i
really
cant
complain
about
them
along
the
fuselage
are
a
pair
of
intake
pieces
that
ive
never
seen
before
and
im
guessing
are
new
theyre
pretty
well
designed
and
will
come
in
handy
for
mocing
down
the
road
the
action
feature
of
the
aircraft
is
the
wench
system
this
is
very
different
then
other
lego
wenches
in
that
you
build
the
entire
mechanism
and
housing
you
can
then
use
it
to
raise
spy
clops
up
and
down
from
the
bottom
of
the
chopper
using
the
rotor
now
this
also
keeps
you
from
sitting
there
and
just
giving
the
rotor
repeated
spins
to
simulate
flight
im
not
too
thrilled
with
that
but
there
are
a
hundred
other
lego
helicopters
out
there
with
fully
rotating
rotors
so
i
guess
i
can
let
it
by
just
this
once
as
youd
suspect
the
bottom
of
the
cockpit
is
completely
open
which
makes
this
a
vehicle
pretty
much
solely
for
spy
clops
sorry
henchman
but
there
is
plenty
of
room
beneath
the
body
to
attach
a
plate
with
some
seats
on
it
to
accommodate
another
pilot
without
drastically
altering
the
design
or
even
removing
existing
pieces
the
turbo
car
is
a
slick
little
honey
of
a
lego
car
and
the
silver
pieces
that
make
up
the
body
work
contribute
a
lot
to
that
fact
the
front
license
plate
appears
to
be
an
exofore
code
brick
but
it
also
hides
the
activation
lever
for
the
passenger
ejector
seat
the
seat
works
about
as
well
as
the
spruce
goose
which
is
to
say
not
well
at
all
but
here
its
the
thought
that
counts
the
interior
of
the
car
is
really
well
done
theres
even
a
radar
screen
for
keeping
track
of
pesky
helicopters
but
the
bondlike
features
dont
end
there
a
lever
in
the
compartment
raises
pair
of
guns
in
the
hood
and
a
knob
on
the
rear
deploys
a
quad
rocket
system
with
more
flickfire
missiles
this
is
a
car
that
wont
be
stopped
easily
the
rear
has
two
cones
sticking
out
id
like
to
think
theyre
smoke
nozzles
or
oilslick
sprayers
allinall
this
is
a
really
good
set
the
car
is
pure
lego
vehicle
love
and
looks
fantastic
the
silver
pieces
are
very
nice
and
its
a
shame
lego
doesnt
use
metallic
colors
in
system
sets
more
often
there
are
however
a
lot
of
sticker
for
this
set
and
i
know
how
much
that
bugs
a
lot
of
people
i
personally
like
how
much
detail
the
stickers
add
to
these
sets
and
dont
mind
them
so
much
the
set
also
comes
with
an
agents
id
card
for
chase
which
you
can
put
little
star
stickers
on
from
other
sets
as
you
get
them
its
printed
on
a
real
nice
piece
of
sturdy
plastiboard
and
would
be
cooler
if
you
could
put
your
own
picture
and
name
on
it
instead
of
pretending
to
be
chase
sold
by
themselves
the
car
and
chopper
would
be
musthaves
all
tossed
together
with
the
gate
sort
of
makes
the
set
a
little
less
then
the
sum
of
its
parts
and
with
498
parts
most
of
them
small
thats
not
so
hot
its
only
slightly
overpriced
in
my
opinion
but
if
you
do
shell
out
the
money
you
wont
regret
it
im
very
comfortable
recommending
this
set
to
anyone
close
to
perfect
but
the
price
and
some
minor
flaws
bring
it
back
just
a
little
id
say
433
but
out
of
5
is
close
enough
chrome
cant
wait
for
the
review
deino
wow
thanks
deino
for
this
great
review
i
cant
wait
to
get
this
myself
but
right
now
i
got
ta
save
for
the
cw
sets
the
car
is
with
no
doubt
one
of
the
most
mind
blowing
things
tlg
has
come
up
with
and
we
can
only
hope
that
there
will
be
more
models
made
out
of
almost
only
metalic
colors
the
spider
cyborg
while
not
as
innovative
as
some
of
the
other
cyborgs
is
a
very
nice
fig
and
his
head
will
be
very
usefull
for
splinter
cell
mocs
and
those
intake
pieces
are
only
relatively
new
btw
they
are
in
almost
all
of
the
current
10
racers
sets
any
chance
of
you
taking
a
pic
of
a
lineup
of
all
the
silver
parts
in
this

i
love
it
fun
playable
cool
looking
and
killer
minifigs
sweet
wow
thanks
for
the
great
review
deino
this
set
is
really
a
must
have
for
me
the
sound
brick
seems
great
the
helicopter
looks
very
nice
and
the
car
is
superb
all
of
the
james
bond
features
are
really
cool
though
im
very
interested
in
how
the
ejector
seat
works
or
doesnt
work
the
car
itself
is
very
sleek
and
full
of
beautiful
silver
and
the
inclusion
of
the
new
rims
and
windshield
mean
that
i
wont
have
to
buy
many
speed
racer
sets
as
for
the
minifigs
they
all
look
great
especially
spyclops
though
it
looks
rather
easy
for
him
to
fall
off
of
his
spider
legs
can
you
confirm
this
a
great
review
of
a
great
set
thanks
deinonychus
looking
closely
at
the
red
cones
on
the
missles
and
grey
cones
on
the
cars
rear
these
appear
to
be
a
new
piece
note
how
there
is
a
slight
stopper
ridge
at
the
base
of
their
top
stud
interestingly
the
trans
green
cones
on
the
helicopter
seem
to
be
of
the
older
mould
style
great
review
and
fantastic
pics
deinonychus
and
a
big
thank
you
to
whoever
pointed
out
that
you
could
use
the
sound
brick
for
arkham
asylum
my
addled
brain
didnt
make
the
connection
the
car
is
just
beautiful
and
with
a
good
use
for
the
most
expensive
part
of
the
gate
this
is
on
my
wish
list
for
sure
just
have
to
see
how
much
cash
is
left
over
after
buying
the
new
death
star
in
a
month
or
two
agents
has
to
be
the
biggest
surprise
from
lego
for
ages
without
any
pics
it
sounded
soso
but
theyve
done
a
brilliant
job
with
it
love
those
metallic
coloured
pieces
thanks
for
the
review
whitefang
i
love
these
sets
and
i
wish
they
were
available
in
nz
so
far
it
seems
they
may
never
come
here
but
i
can
sit
and
hope
i
like
the
look
of
them
after
your
makeover
a
real
skeleton
army
there
did
you
say
youve
bought
12
thts
lots
of
skelies
are
you
planning
a
big
moc
or
something
thanks
for
the
review
it
wasnt
really
a
request
but
more
of
an
imply
to
do
it
anyway
great
review
cant
wait
til
these
come
to
aus
probably
when
the
rest
of
the
castle
comes
out
in
september
though
thanks
for
the
review
i
wanted
to
see
what
was
in
this
set
looks
good

in

at

and
could
not

i
wanted

im

are

i

thanks
again
for

thanks
for
the
nice

whitefang
i
got

just
for
the
scared

great
review
for
a
great
set
man
i
loved
the
adventurers
although
the
new
indy
sets
are
good
they
will
never
match
up
to
johnny
thunder
most
of
all
no
stickers
great
review
thanks
for
this
great
review
voltio
i
never
knew
of
this
set
till
now
and
it
really
looks
great
i
never
paid
much
attention
to
those
aztecincan
style
sets
which
i
now
regret
i
love
the
bright
colours
used
here
and
all
the
great
traps
theres
so
many
of
them
which
is
exactly
what
we
can
expect
from
an
old
incan
temple
like
this
one
im
surprised
theres
no
catapult
anyway
the
minifigs
included
are
also
great
and
am
i
right
in
guessing
those
bricks
are
printed
that
would
be
fantastic
as
they
look
amazing
that
boat
hull
is
new
to
me
too
although
i
guess
the
fact
that
its
mainly
in
belville
sets
explains
that
pretty
well
thanks
again
for
the
sweet
review
do
you
have
any
other
jungle
adventurers
sets
you
plan
to
review
peace
thanks
for
reviewing
this
rare
set
since
it
came
out
in
1999
i
have
only
seen
this
set
in
a
toystore
one
single
time
one
single
copy
as
well
it
was
in
the
summer
of
1999
in
belgium
arlon
in
a
store
called
maxi
toys
belgiums
tru
i
think
they
had
the
three
biggest
junglesets
for
sale
there
these
ancient
ruins
the
set
with
the
beautiful
black
boat
and
the
zeppelin
being
into
adventurers
at
that
time
i
had
never
seen
the
entire
jungle
theme
not
even
in
a
leaflet
or
catalog
and
surprised
as
i
was
i
bought
all
three
sets
that
was
one
happy
dutch
boy
in
belgium
surprisingly
the
two
smallest
sets
made
it
in
very
small
quantities
to
my
local
stores
in
holland
except
for
the
pontoon
plane
and
small
raft
which
was
my
very
first
shop
at
home
order
the
spiders
secret
i
bought
off
bl
which
makes
me
the
proud
owner
of
the
entire
jungle
serie
back
to
the
set
this
was
the
first
time
in
a
long
history
of
collecting
lego
that
i
had
a
deformed
piece
an
2x8
red
plate
was
twisted
i
twisted
it
back
and
it
still
serves
its
purpose
i
loved
the
whole
steamidea
in
this
jungle
serie
the
two
boats
both
including
the
one
in
this
set
had
nice
steamengines
and
a
very
cool
mechanic
yours
has
the
wrong
hathair
btw
to
come
along
with
them
the
skeleton
falling
down
on
the
end
of
a
chain
was
the
most
intriguing
part
of
this
set
for
me
it
worked
really
well
and
when
you
were
done
scaring
minifigures
you
could
winch
it
up
again
ready
for
the
next
go
the
only
thing
i
did
not
really
like
about
this
set
was
the
difference
in
wheelsize
on
the
car
front
small
back
large
and
the
way
the
palmtree
consisted
out
of
just
three
parts
all
in
all
a
great
set
that
is
becoming
more
rare
and
expensive
as
we
speakpost
get
it

i
absolutly
love
this
set
this
is
in
my
opinion
the
best
adventurers
set
it
has
it
all
the
falling
bridge
the
falling
skeleton
the
spear
trap
and
the
classic
trapdoor
it
is
a
musthave
set
thanks
for
providing
such
a
nice
review
this
set
is
awesome
gr8
wow
good
review
i
used
to
love
this
old
sets
as
i
was
greatly
fascinated
by
inca
and
aztec
cultures
and
the
mayans
technological
marvels
astounded
me
i
was
thrilled
to
death
when
lego
released
little
aztec
figures
so
of
course
i
jsut
had
to
buy
some
your
narration
with
the
sig
fig
was
hilarious
and
the
review
was
all
around
wonderful
keep
up
the
good
work
mate
i
got
this
as
a
birthday
gift
when
i
turned
7
years
old
or
so
i
can
still
remember
the
big
box
with
the
brown
bridge
in
its
display
so
many
hours
of
fun
one
of
the
most
amazing
sets
i
own
a
lot
of
play
value
a
true
classic
i
had
one
of
these
it
was
awesome
it
went
well
with
the
zeppelin
i
cant
remember
if
the
box
was
one
of
those
fold
up
the
lid
ones
though
cant
tell
from
the
picture
anyone
want
to
jog
my
memory
i
always
thought
the
sets
with
the
flap
lids
were
the
best
i
kept
those

5150
lego
the
helicopter
is
apart
from
that
it
is
very
very
big
and
that
it
does
not
include
any
interior
a
very
nice
set
the
most
i
like
the
life
raft
becuase
it
is
simply
nevertheless
i
dont
know
if
i
buy
it
probably
not
but
its
very
nice
two
questions
where
can
you
fasten
the
stretcher
on
to
haul
it
up
and
down
is
the
motor
working
with
batteries
klausdieter
there
is
no
real
way
to
lift
up
the
stretcher
due
to
the
crane
arm
being
in
the
way
there
really
isnt
any
room
for
any
kind
oflifting
straps
the
set
does
include
a
1x2
plate
with
a
hinge
for
the
diver
to
stand
on
so
at
least
he
can
hold
on
to
someone
the
crane
lifts
them
up
and
then
he
can
put
them
in
the
strechter
thats
my
guess
at
least
as
far
as
the
motor
i
dont
believe
it
uses
bateries
since
you
pull
out
the
motor
and
all
the
button
does
is
recoil
the
winch
line
back
in
i
have
to
say
it
does
a
very
good
job
of
that
and
is
very
smooth
as
long
as
you
dont
have
anything
to
heavy
one
detail
i
forgot
to
meation
is
the
shark
its
nothing
new
just
the
basic
shark
lego
has
had
around
for
nealy
2
decades
but
it
was
a
detail
nothing
less
all
stickers
im
afraid
though
imnot
a
fan
of
stickers
myself
some
sets
like
ferrari
for
example
take
longer
to
put
on
than
building
the
actual
set
this
one
is
not
as
sticker
heavy
as
it
seams
though
and
the
ones
that
areon
there
really
give
the
set
that
extra
touch
printed
would
have
been
preffered
of
course
but
in
this
case
i
didnt
mind
it
thats
a
very
nice
set
im
having
my
doubts
about
getting
it
though
still
the
overall
shape
and
size
of
the
helicopter
remind
me
of
the
reallife
ch53
military
cargo
helicopter
a
very
nice
review
youve
got
the
photography
down
very
well
i
feel
perhaps
a
bit
of
nitpicking
but
at
the
end
where
you
assign
a
rating
if
you
do
a
rating
with
faces
which
is
fine
by
me
you
may
want
to
seperate
the
faces
by
a
line
otherwise
it
may
become
too
crowded
to
the
eye
im
rather
fond
of
helicopters
and
have
built
many
different
types
this
doesnt
really
remind
me
of
any
particular
model
other
than
perhaps
an
eh
101
merlin
and
even
that
resemblance
is
very
superficial
just
for
the
record
this
is
a
sikorsky
sea
king
and
this
is
a
sikorsky
mh53
a
derivation
of
the
ch53
the
only
resemblance
i
see
with
the
former
is
the
colour
scheme
and
with
the
latter
the
fact
that
its
got
a
fat
rearend
sponsons
and
six
blades
it
doesnt
matter
though
because
i
really
like
it
the
colour
scheme
is
great
the
shape
is
nice
its
got
quite
a
bit
of
detail
and
i
just
have
to
get
my
hands
on
the
cockpit
window
and
those
new
rotor
blades
when
i
first
saw
the
large
aircraft
pieces
a
few
years
ago
i
figured
they
were
very
much
singleuse
parts
but
the
tail
end
doesnt
look
too
bad
pretty
clever
i
like
the
raft
too
it
really
does
look
like
the
real
deal
that
the
helicopter
cant
lift
it
really
isnt
an
issue
because
in
real
life
they
wouldnt
lift
the
raft
either
theyd
use
the
rescue
hoist
to
lift
the
occupants
of
the
raft
into
the
helicopter
one
by
one
or
perhaps
in
pairs
imagine
a
storm
with
a
helicopter
hovering
over
tall
waves
with
a
big
fat
raft
strung
from
a
cable
underneath
it
the
raft
would
catch
a
lot
of
wind
and
flop
around
quite
a
bit
causing
it
to
loose
all
its
occupants
and
also
yanking
the
helicopter
around
possibly
causing
the
pilot
to
loose
control
and
crash
bad
idea

i
noticed
that
you
said
the
torsos
are
the
same
as
the
last
line
the
last
line
had
orange
torsos
this
one
has
yellow
torsos
chuck
i
will
certainly
add
this
one
to
my
collection
i
already
own
every
other
rescue
helicopter
and
i
have
a
feeling
this
will
be
the
best
just
love
how
its
completely
enclosed
thanks
for
the
review
thanks
for
the
review
riddler
your
pics
are
a
bit
blurry
though
if
you
want
them
a
bit
better
you
should
sit
your
camera
on
a
hard
surface
so
you
dont
wobble
it
as
much
i
love
the
tumbler
though
it
is
quite
massive
but
either
way
ill
be
glad
to
get
it
the
figs
in
my
opinion
are
really
bad
joker
should
atleast
have
a
different
suit
oh
well
its
worth
it
for
that
awesome
van
and
instance
where
the
stickers
are
totally
worth
it
thanks
again
batbrick
away
thanks
all
but
so
little
replies
but
my

is
sent
now
ill
hope
and

the

bring
it
on
oh
mysterious
puzzler
perhaps
it
could
help
a
little
if
you
would
resize
the
pics
for
your
next
one
with
all
that
automatic
resizing
going
on
it
needs
quite
some
time
for
the
site
to
load
in
this
context
to
see
two
pics
of
your
clock
was
perhaps
a
little
odd
too
great
looking
set
loved
the
review
pictures
were
good
sometimes
blury
but
i
think
i
will
pick
this
up
after
i
get
the
rest
of
the
kotcs
sets
riddler
a
tip
i
learned
in
photoclass
is
to
take
a
breath
in
and
hold
it
while
pushing
the
shutter
so
you
dont
accidentally
move
while
breathing
i
thought
it
was
silly
but
it
does
work
again
great
review
looking
forward
to
more
oke
thanks
for
the
tips
but
you
see
that
not
blurry
pics
ive
taken
them
later
so
now
it
will
be
totaly
great

shame
that
most
of

nonetheless
just
wanted
to
say
that
out
of
all
my
lego
sets
this
one
7888
is
the
best
the
tumbler
is
so
cool
once
it
is
put
together
those
four
huge
wheels
at
the
back
make
it
quite
unique
if
you
do
not

its

great
review
of
a
great

i
always
figured
the
hoses
were
welding
torches
attached
to
jetpacks
yeah
as
the
whole
thing
had
the
vibe
of
a
mobile
repair
center
much
like
many
of
my
favorite
sets
this
one
has
a
base
of
simple
bricks
and
plates
and
then
from
that
solid
foundation
the
rest
is
built
out
to
be
decorative
or
have
the
action
features
this
gives
sets
a
very
solid
feel
as
demonstrated
in
this
set
the
first
snowspeeder
and
galaxy
explorer
the
mm
armored
drilling
unit
has
a
more
technic
base
giving
it
a
less
solid
appearance
and
though
i
like
the
set
that
jet
that
luanches
from
the
back
is
horrible
partially
because
of
the
useless
orange
containment
things
the
mega
core
has
a
nifty
crane
instead
of
a
big
useless

never

thanks
for

it

right
about

i
got
a

off

two
months
ago
but
they
no

have
them
i
guess
i
should
grab
some
while
theyre
still
widely
available
on
bricklink
as
they
can
be
useful
in
a
number
of
situations
on
a
side
note
one
interesting
thing
about
this

is
that
it
seemingly
had
two
uscanada
names
mega

magnetizer
and
multi

magnetizer
brickset
lugnet
and
all
the
other

ive
seen
call
it

i
have
some
north
american
catalogs
from
that
time
period
that
call
it
multi
and
the
box
also
says
multi
on
it
i
actually
didnt
know
the
mega
name
at
all

you
changed
your
mind
a
review
of
a
burger
wouldn

t
be
half
that
interesting
for

it
´
s
just
a
mediocre
set
to
me
but
of
course
it
´
s
always
cool
to
get
important
mfs
in
less
pricy
sets
i
like
the
penguin
´
s
sub
from
the
batcave
more
just
because
they
did
a
fine
job
on
resembling
a
penguin
without
using
a
sticker
robins
craft
looks
fairly
nice
but
the
most
useful
parts
of
the
whole
set
for
me
personally
would
be
those
indeed
very
neat
green
engines
yes
it
probably
would
have
been
nicer
if
they
would
have
at
least
done
a
brick
built
beak
for
the
front
of
the
sub
unfortunately
i
never
got
my
hands
on
the
batcave
set
so
i
never
was
able
to
build
the
original
sub
yay
another
technic
shooter
whew
i
need
a
spare
one
in
case
the
14348
other
ones
that
i
have
all
happen
to
break
seriously
do
lego
set
designers
get
some
sort
of
bonus
for
incorporating
catapults
technic
shooters
and
or
flickfire
missiles
anyway
thanks
for
the
review
looks
like
a
cute
set
thanks
for
the
review
i
love
this
set
i
didnt

it
was
much
at
first
either
but
i
really
love
it
another
cheaper
robin
and
penguin
is
great
and
those
nifty
mini
penguins
are
awesome
the
spare
pieces
are
even
nice
i

love
it
compactness
penguins
sub
is
even
better
at
first
i
was
annoyed
at
getting
two
subs
but
now
i
realise
it
means
i
can
have
a
fleet
of
them
ill
be
sure
to
mod
over
those
cannons
though
but
the
details
are
very
slick

am
man
tohse
mini
vehicles
and
minifigs
are
sexy
as
all
heck
i
love
drinferno
and
the
female
pattern
for
agent
trace
is
it
just
me
or
she
almost
busting
out
i
love
the
dr
inferno
hair
and
the
reappearance
of
spyclops
and
gold
tooth
is
simply
gold
yes
yes
pun
intended
i
have
to
say
this
is
shaping
up
to
be
one
of
my
favourite
sets
well
ever
batbrick
away
me
want
this
set
wow
like
others
have
said
i
was
unsure
about
these
when
i
first
heard
about
them
but
then
looked
at
the
first
leaked
pics
and
thought
they
actually
look
pretty
neat
now
i
have
seen
all
the
reviews
i
have
to
have
all
these
sets
at
first
i
was
thinking
they
would
be
great
as
parts
packs
but
the
more
reviews
i
see
the
less
i
want
to
use
them
as
part
packs
and
just
keep
them
as
built
or
buy
2
so
i
can
do
both
cant
wait
till
they
hit
the
shelves
in
the
uk
thanks
for
the
review
thats
an
awesome
review
and
a
great
set
it
seems
with
all
of
this
years
star
wars
i
still
havent
got
rogue
shadow
i
cant
afford
agents
too
which
is
a
shame
looking
at
this
thanks
for
another
wonderful
review
sveltecorps
a
very
fine
set
indeed
i
absolutely
love
the
way
all
of
the
vehicles
fit
into
the
command
centre
very
clever
the
projector
is
really
cool
it
looks
very
nice
its
great
to
see
these
light
and
sound
bricks
in
the
agents
sets
all
of
the
little
nooks
and
crannies
in
the
centre
are
great
too
i
really
love
the
amount
of
detail
featured
mixed
with
all
of
the
playability
of
this
set
the
minifigs
as
usual
are
brilliant
the
uniforms
look
fantastic
dr
inferno
looks
especially
great
i
love
his
white
suit
with
hints
of
orange
and
who
can
forget
his
hair
im
really
tempted
to
buy
this
beast
now
though
im
not
sure
my
wallet
will
forgive
me
for
it
i
suppose
ill
have
to
cut
back
on
indy
and
castle
multiples
for
now
thanks
for
the
truly
great
review
sveltecorps
nice
work
wow
this
set
looks
so
amazing
amazing
genius
davinci
art
i
say
youve
done
an
excellent
job
reviewing
and
really
this
is
the
review
ive
been
waiting
for
so
cool
so
classy
i
love
the
mission
briefing
feature
to
think
that
lego
could
go
so
high
as
to
put
something
ingenious
like
that
in
there
too
bad
lego
figures
dont
have
fingers
to
make
shadow
shows
eh
genius
the
jet
lauching
feature
is
pretty
slick
and
they
even
put
a
control
center
in
there
too
thats
beast
loving
that
the
bottomi
dont
see
how
that
big
buggy
can
get
out
or
in
there
but
awesome
too
the
back
of
the
truck
could
use
more
detailing
i
think
but
the
jail
popopen
feature
is
pretty
cool
as
is
the
speed
boat
storage
rack
cabin
its
great
that
roof
opening
feature
is
a
great
part
of
this
set
also
i
think
you
can
have
multiple
figures
up
theremaybe
you
can
mod
it
to
put
a
bed
in
there
it
certainly
looks
big
enough
inferno
plane
wow
that
think
is
smooth
baby
i
love
how
the
wings
contain
rotors
inside
of
them
thats
awesome
detail
right
there
that
is
a
sweet
ship
thingy
so
slick
the
rest
of
the
command
center
is
pretty
awesome
too
we
get
a
4x4
wheeler
and
a
crane
and
lots
of
room
wow
just
wow
great
review
great
set
you
are
well
worthy
of
your
custom
title
im
gon
na
go
buy
this
for
only
90
woot
splendid
review
i
love
everything
on
this
set
no
question
bout
it
somehow
i
knew
i
should
have
saved
up
and
buy
that
when
come
to
trubut
the
sight
of
turbocar
chase
and
jetpack
pursuit
was
to
tempting
to
pass
up
i
first
i
thought
the
whole
agents
line
would
not
be
very
good
but
boy
have
i
changed
my
mind
this
set
looks
amazing
as
do
all
of
the
other
sets
in
the
line
i
really
like
how
the
small
vehicles
all
fit
into
the
truck
i
dont
like
it
when
sets
come
with
smaller
vehicles
and
dont
have
anywhere
to
store
them
so
they
just
float
on
the
side
that
light
projector
is
fantastic
i
cant
believe
they
are
actually
printed
this
is
definitly
on
my
tobuy
list

for

its
happened
in

and
it
had
to
happen
to
lego
yes
the

are
back
space
invaders
holograms
compulsory

wearing
legislation
and
the
return
of
classic

ok
we
dont
have
a
fully
fledged
classic
space
theme
back
yet
but
if
7645
is
the
way
of
the
future
i
think
lego
is
ready
to
do
it
properly
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
last
years
mars
mission
sets
and
only
picked
up
a
few
on
clearance
but
this
set
is
light
years
excuse
the
pun
ahead
of
2007s
offerings
this
mining
vehicle
is
solid
compact
and
welldesigned
it
looks
impressive
and
even
better
it
has
fantastic
power
functions
operability
behold

apologies
for

but
i
wanted
to
capture
the
sweet
shimmy
of
the
metallic
holographic
background
on
this
sheet
the
way
it
catches
the
light
really
makes
a
difference
to
the
small
alien
craft
and
makes
it
look
much
more
interesting
from
the
plain
stickers
of
last
year
theres
heaps
of
spare
silvery
stuff
once
the
stickers
are
applied
for
those
who
use
the
leftover
sticker
material
for
customising

with

parts
everywhere
woo
i
know
the
lego
instruction
books
scold
me
if
i
mix
bags
but
im
a
devilmaycare
kind
of
guy
in
your
face
tlc
i
love
mixing
all
the
parts
together
before
i
build
it
reminds
me
of
my
youth
when
the
days
were
long
anything
was
possible
and
i
didnt
need
strict
instructions
not
to
build
on
grass
or
poke
my
eye
out
with
a
technic
shooter
interesting
parts
these
may
or
may
not
be
new
my
technic
knowledge
is
not
that
detailed
the
little
scoop
parts
are
so
cute
and
have
a
heap
of
potential
uses
i
love
em
theyre
like
smurf
hats
at
miniland
scale
these
technic
wheel
things
in
orange
are
also
cute
they
kind
of
remind
me
of
marigolds
giant
fabuland
marigolds
the
track
pieces
you
get
70
of
these
heres
the
section
of
track
for
one
side
as
you
can
see
its
about
52
studs
long
these
hold
together
better
than
the
small
ones
on
the
hailfire
droid
jungle
cutter
part
2
minifigs
small
mining
transport
alien
ship
i
have
to
confess
i
forgot
to
take
an
individual
snap
of
the
astronauts
its
the
usual
bunch
though
scaredy
face
guy
sunglasses
in
space
man
and
a
third
one
i
cant
remember
you
dont
really
care
though
youre
only
interested
in
the
alien
commander
and
his
matching
arms
legs
combo
deal
as
brickbitz
noted
in
his
review
of
the
smaller
set
the
glowy
eye
is
just
a
1x1
cylinder
the
set
also
comes
with
2
normal
jellies
one
pictured
here
for
size
youll
see
what
happened
to
the
other
one
soon
enough
the
alien
craft
is
nothing
exciting
apart
from
the
gorgeous
glinting
stickers
heres
the
road
safety
angle
the
commander
actually
clips
onto
a
1x2
plate
with
handle
so
he
cant
fall
out
then
the
lime
tentacle
thing
descends
on
top
of
him
to
keep
him
firmly
there
like
a
baby
seat
not
very
brave
for
an
alien
commander
is
he
i
mean
did
darth
vader
ever
use
a
seatbelt
tssk
with
cradle
up
this
part
of
the
build
also
includes
the
small
astronaut
mining
buggy
small
and
effective
please
note
in
this
build
ive
applied
stickers
to
everything
bar
cockpit
pieces
this
comes
with
radio
and
saw
piece
part
3
the
reaper
the
first
part
of
the
build
is
the
detachable
shuttle
i
really
like
the
retro
aesthetic
of
this
with
the
angled
wings
and
the
side
hoverpod
things
it
is
much
better
than
the
comparable
vehicle
from
7699
the
new
flickfire
piece
is
a
waste
of
space
its
fairly
limp
i
prefer
the
simple
flickfire
technic
pin
to
be
honest
theres
also
a
very
nice
little
side
workshop
as
you
can
see
i
really
like
how
the
control
unit
is
plugged
into
the
wall
via
5
1x1
round
plates
third
pic
its
a
bit
dark
great
detail
the
technic
pins
on
the
back
are
there
to
connect
the
power
functions
battery
box
its
odd
theyre
included
at
this
stage
of
the
instructions
maybe
the
intention
was
to
release
it
originally
with
all
the
necessary
motors
etc
but
the
price
point
was
too
high
and
they
scaled
it
back
the
base
the
shuttle
sits
on
that
bley
technic
axle
in
the
middle
when
the
reaper
is
fully
assembled
the
little
vehicle
scoots
down
the
ramp
at
the
rear
which
folds
up
to
hold
it
in
place
when
the
reaper
is
in
motion
you
can
see
theres
a
crystal
container
here
as
well
another
nice
small
detail
which
i
found
the
2007
sets
lacked
theres
also
an
alien
here
thankfully
not
in
those
horrendous
transorange
tubes
so
prevalent
last
year
the
complete
assembly
isnt
it
snug
its
just
the
right
size
too
not
massive
but
large
enough
to
be
a
serious
mining
vehicle
the
ominous
black
treads
contrast
nicely
with
the
white
orange
colour
scheme
of
the
vehicle
itself
the
trans
detailing
blue
for
weapons
neon
green
for
energy
is
carried
nicely
through
the
whole
set
the
blades
and
the
scoops
whirl
nicely
as
the
machine
trundles
along
top
down
view
tread
detail
whirling
blades
of
death
the
buggy
descends
probably
the
most
disturbing
aspect
of
the
whole
set
is
this
pic
the
jelly
has
an
orange
pump
plugged
into
its
heart
which
is
connected
to
an
energy
supply
on
the
left
hand
side
this
vehicle
runs
on
alien
jelly
juice
either
that
or
its
milking
the
jelly
in
some
equally
disturbing
fashion
how
amoral
is
that
i
know
theres
been
debate
about
this
the
jellys
arent
innocent
theyre
evil
energy
crystal
thieving
maniacs
etc
but
i
find
it
a
bit
odd
that
the
humans
respond
by
chaining
the
jelly
up
to
the
bowels
of
their
mining
vehcile
and
suck
energy
from
its
heart
people
debate
about
violence
in
lego
as
represented
by
realistic
minifig
weapons
but
i
think
the
moral
lesson
here
is
even
worse
its
ok
to
exploit
foreign
life
forms
for
our
own
gain
if
they
treat
us
badly
first
whofans
i
think
the
ood
should
have
a
word
with
the
jelly
commander
that
aside
this
set
is
welldesigned
and
fairly
good
value
at
aud7995
its
definitely
a
notch
above
last
years
mars
mission
sets
overall
with
improved
detailing
and
more
useful
functions
the
holostickers
are
fab
and
its
nice
to
have
an
alien
commander
even
if
he
is
a
bit
bulky
and
his
fingers
are
identical
to
his
toes
however
if
all
these
reasons
by
themselves
werent
reason
to
recomend
this
set
the
following
is
part
4
power
functions
the
best
part
of
this
set
and
the
reason
i
bought
it
really
is
the
integration
of
power
functions
bizarrely
this
isnt
mentioned
at
all
on
the
box
and
i
only
found
out
about
it
from
the
instructions
when
they
were
posted
on
eurobricks
instructions
for
book
2
which
has
the
power
function
stuff
available
here
this
is
a
great
idea
and
hopefully
we
will
see
more
new
sets
take
this
kind
of
approach
especially
with
the
new
train
sets
luckily
i
got
monster
dino
4958
on
sale
for
half
price
earlier
this
year
so
already
had
most
of
the
necessary
motors
etc
the
only
one
needed
was
an
extra
small
one
what
you
need
is
listed
in
the
instructions
below
with
redirections
to
shop
home
to
buy
the
motors
note
theres
actually
a
mistake
on
this
page
the
2
small
motors
you
need
are
both
8883
not
8882
which
is
the
large
xl
motor
way
to
confuse
the
kids
there
lego
attaching
them
was
a
dream
and
only
took
a
few
minutes
in
contrast
to
4958
where
it
was
almost
impossible
to
remove
motor
elements
without
dismantling
the
model
basically
the
back
platform
and
some
plates
and
orange
slopes
come
off
you
attach
the
motors
and
then
the
smaller
plates
go
back
on
these
parts
are
now
left
loose
overall
the
look
of
the
reaper
isnt
badly
effected
as
youre
mainly
viewing
from
the
front
anyway
sadly
i
cant
show
you
how
it
moves
youll
just
have
to
trust
me
that
it
does
the
way
it
is
steered
is
demonsrated
in
the
instruction
pages
above
basically
each
motor
is
controlled
by
a
corresponding
switch
on
the
remote
move
them
both
forward
to
move
forward
move
one
right
to
turn
right
move
both
back
to
move
back
etc
it
zips
along
its
a
speedy
little
thing
personally
i
wouldnt
want
to
be
in
its
path
as
it
comes
roaring
down
the
martian
canyon
my
cat
was
scared
as
it
was
it
is
oodles
of
fun
and
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
have
the
motors
or
can
get
them
cheaply
and
adds
a
whole
new
dimension
to
the
play
aspect
of
playset
it
is
also
as
i
said
very
quick
to
switch
between
modded
and
nonmodded
reaper
in
contrast
to
the
more
fiddly
dino
creations
the
only
problem
i
had
is
that
if
it
moves
too
fast
the
weight
of
the
battery
box
at
the
back
tends
to
pull
the
whole
thing
back
and
it
rears
up
it
does
correct
itself
though
i
only
trialled
this
on
carpet
last
night
so
it
may
behave
differently
on
other
surfaces
i
will
need
to
experiment
part
5
summation
this
is
a
great
set
made
even
better
with
the
addition
of
power
functions
at
aud7995
its
wellpriced
buy
it
buy
the
motors
as
well
kmart
still
has
stock
of
4958
at
89
wait
for
a
15
off
sale
you
wont
regret
it
buy
2
and
make
competing
battle
machines
the
only
thing
is
just
dont
torture
that
poor
jelly

with
the
power
functions
too
bad
ill
have
to
buy
some
extra
wow
this
thing
is
very
cool
definately
no
lack
of
details
and
is
quite
cheap
for
the
bang
of
the
set
that
you
get
for
some
reason
i
really
love
the
bay
in
the
back
of
the
detachable
ship
quite
an
improvement
from
last
years
line
thank
you
for
the
review
i
was
going
to
buy
this
set
anyway
but
now
im
even
more
excited
d
my
favorite
part
of
this
set
is
the
bay
that
holds
the

am
said
so
is
there
some
way
to
get
all
those
motor
bits
at
once
or
do
you
have
to
buy
them
on
their
own
i
dont
think
ive
ever
seen
them
in
a
store
here
only
from
sh
so
far
or
if
you
buy
sets
which
they
come
in
all
the
ones
you
need
apart
from
one
additional
small
motor
are
available
in
the
4958
monster
dino
set
which
i
got
half
price
i
ordered
the
extra
from
sh
at
the
same
time
i
bought
the
set
but
only
because
i
had
already
looked
at
the
instructions
and
knew
what
i
needed
if
people
have
the
ferris
wheel
set
as
well
i
think
the
small
motor
comes
in
that
this
should
be
reported
to
the
news

i
dont
realy

this

said
why
is
it
that
agents
and
star
wars
get
their
own
news
articles
but
this
fantastic
set
is
totally
ignored
i
think
maybe
theres
a
bit
of
star
wars
excitement
on
the
front
page
which
has
probably
got
a
few
members
frothing
with
excitement
not
every
review
needs
to
be
frontpaged
anyway
no
but
this
is
one
of
the
most
anticipated
sets
of
08
thanks
for
the
review
i
really
like
all
the
mars
mission
sets
this
year
the
usage
of
the
big
wing
is
a
bit
annoying
but
you
cant
blame
lego
for
reusing
the
mold
ive
been
considering
doing
the
same
with
mine

said
so
thats
all
folks
shall
i
include
one
last
bar
joke
i
wouldnt
have
a
bar
of
it
thanks
for
the
great
and
very
detailed
review
i
love
the
new
holostickers
im
still
not
sold
on
this
set
though
im
not
sure
why
i
think
its
the
big
wing
piece
and
the
tootechnicy
build
from
looking
at
the
instructions
the
platform
seems
kind
of
out
of
place
and
for
the
size
of
the
set
the
functionality
doesnt
seem
as
good
as
it
could
be
it
reminds
me
of
7699
armored
drilling
unit
looks
impressive
but
doesnt
seem
to
do
that
much
i
do
think
mars
mission
has
improved
this
year
though
bar
none
this
is
the
weakest
of
the
new
mm
sets
i
think
thanks
for
the
review
mr
mandalorian
the
alien
craft
is
a
bit
small
in
my
opinion
could
have
done
with
being
just
a
little
bit
larger
the
main
craft
however
despite
its
few
minor
flaws
looks
very
good
while
space
is
n't
my
normal
theme
i
'm
certainly
being
tempted
this
year

on

am
said
that
certainly
feels
like
an
homage
to
the
deep
freeze
defender
which
itself
feels
like
an
homage
to
the
galaxy
commander
thats
the
observation
i
had
when
i
saw
the
first
pictures
of
this
set
online
a
few
months
ago
i
am
a
proud
owner
of
the
6973
deep
freeze
defender
and
6980
galaxy
commander
so
im
looking
forward
to
see
how
the
7644
stacks
up
next
to
them
there
is
a
definite
lineage
here
and
these
sets
clearly
demonstrate
the
evolution
of
lego
set
design
over
the
years
the
mx81
may
not
have
the
most
playability
out
of
all
the
new
mm
sets
although
it
has
alot
from
what
i
can
tell
but
its
hard
to
beat
the
look
of
a
large
sleek
space
cruiser
sitting
on
your
shelf
or
dresser
at
least
for
myself
anyhow
this
is
my
first
post
to
the
forum
and
hope
my
welcome
wont
wear
out
here
anytime
soon

am
said
having
a
name
like
that
is
a
good
start
my
screen
name
largely
sums
up
my
interest
in
lego
but
is
not
soley
limited
to
space
thanks
for
the
warm
welcome
thanks
for
the
review
i
actually
quite
like
this
i
cant
afford
it
so
im
not
getting
too
attached
to
it
but
in
its
own
way
its
great
its
certainly
reminiscent
of
space
sets
of
the
past
as
others
have
said
and
the
dropdown
ramp
section
is
just
really
cool
as
an
idea
you
understand
sure
the
lab
is
a
little
crap
but
at
least
the
effort
was
made
sort
of
the
sheer
fact
that
its
so
big
though
really
makes
me
like
this
theres
just
something
appealing
about
large
spaceships
not
capital
ships
just
big

ships
with
lots
of
guns

i
hope
were
not
breaking
forum
protocol
by
not
discussing
the
7644
review
of
the
original
poster
or
that
particular
set
in
general
hey
its
no
worse
than
batbrick
and
i
no
really
it
isnt
even
in
the
same
league
thank
you
for
that
nice
review
mr
mandalorian
wow
somehow
it
´
s
almost
like
classic
space
´
s
back
indeed
it
´
s
a
great
star
ship
it
looks
stream
lined
original
and
impressive
and
even
the
huge
plane
wing
part
looks
rather
cool
and
smooth
on
it
it
´
s
equipped
at
least
with
some
kind
of
engines
on
top
of
the
wings
and
although
they
´
re
made
with
only
two
a
little
juniorized
parts
it
´
s
better
than
nothing
there
´
s
a
lab
or
some
sort
of
engine
room
with
enough
space
inside
to
allow
one
or
two
mfs
to
play
scotty
yeah
the
two
cockpits
´
re
nicely
detailed
with
a
cool
use
of
these
orange
1x1
round
plates
and
to
detach
one
or
all
two
of
them
reminds
a
lot
of
the
playability
of
the
good
old
space
sets
it
seems
even
like
it
´
s
easy
to
attach
them
to
some
kind
of
cloud
city
twinpod
car
thanks
these
hinged
wings
looks
like
some
solid
fun
to
me
of
course
the
cockpits
aren
´
t
airtight
and
even
this
reminds
unfortunately
of
the
post
blue
grey
and
trans
yellow
era
of
cs
anyway
there
´
s
no
real
fun
without
some
moding
i
guess
another
great
advantage
of
the
set
´
s
that
it
´
s
not
overpacked
with
shooting
things
one
technic
shooter
cool
in
grey
and
only
one
trans
orange
prison
pod
too
well
i
can
surely
live
with
that
especially
since
it
´
s
nicely
asymmetrical
the
drill
rover
´
s
very
charming
a
little
like
a
rebuilt
oldsmobile
convertibe
stranded
on
mars
sweet
and
that
platform
feature
´
s
plain
nifty
and
well
done
too
very
playable
and
useable
for
a
lot
of
things
hmm
recently
i
complained
a
lot
about
the
dense
use
of
studless
technic
beams
for
the
inner
structure
of
vehicles
like
these
exoforce
tanks
par
exemple
which
makes
moding
in
an
economical
way
pretty
frustrating
but
the
beams
here
´
re
used
in
a
very
proper
way
it
should
be
fairly
easy
to
mod
let
´
s
say
the
back
of
that
lab
section
up
to
perhaps
even
the
cockpits
to
create
a
larger
airtight
area
that
could
be
boarded
from
the
platform
just
to
fit
this
certain
spacers
need
for
um
realism
there
´
re
many
more
nice
details
too
like
that
satelite
tv
thingy
and
that
cylinder
with
trans
blue
2x2
dish
for
the
knob
or
these
cylinders
with
cones
on
that
handle
and
that
alien
craft
´
s
pretty
nice
and
detailed
as
well
like
i
said
before
i
really
feel
like
classic
space
´
s
back

i
appreciate
your
review
mr
mandalorian
but
why
the
negativity
id
try
to
find
more
positives
about
the
set
instead
of
kinda
criticizing
it
after
each
picture
i
personally
think
it
looks
freakin
awesome
the
size
is
very
impresive
and
i
nearly
fell
of
my
chair
when
i
saw
the
first
pics
earlier
this
year
its
quite
unlike
anything
ive
ever
seen
from

said
i
dont
understand
why
theres
so
much
negativity
this
is
actually
my
favorite
of
the
new
mm
sets
the
finished
look
is
very
sleek
and
not
very
gappy
at
all
the
deployable
landing
pad
is
great
and
itll
make
it
easy
to
put
on
a
shelf
without
taking
too
much
room
lots
of
greebles
although
i
will
concede
that
its
just
begging
to
be
modded
still
though
im
definitely
buying
this
one
it
has
a
really
great
look
to
it

i
dont
understand
the
negativity
either
one
mans
treasure
is
another
mans
trash
i
suppose
that
said
having
grown
up
with
lego
during
the
80s
this
set
has
a
certain
nostalgia
factor
in
its
overall
look
and
feel
that
harkens
back
to
that
earlier
period
in
my
life
which
i
fondly
remember
aside
from
the
factory
star
justice
set
elements
of
which
i
loathe
i
expect
the
7644
to
be
the
closest
thing
to
a
classic
space
revival
that
well
ever
see
again
from
the
lego
group
but
i
hope
to
be
pleasantly
suprised
someday
though
im
not
living
in
the
past
and
do
appreciate
everything
lego
is
doing
now
and
will
do
and
has
done
since
and
like
you
im
one
whos
definitely
buying
this
set
no
matter
how
few
of
us
there
may
be
im
sorry
you
guys
thought
i
was
being
negative
i
actually
love
the
set
it
brings
a
real
feel
of
classic
space
to
mm
no
im
not
talking
in
the
third
person
however
it
does
have
its
own
small
issues
which
are
nothing
really
i
said
that
theres
not
much
of
a
lab
but
thats
the
beauty
of
lego
theres
a
lot
of
room
in
the
ship
so
it
should
be
a
piece
of
cake
to
mod
to
a
bigger
lab
too
many
bars
ill
take
them
off
i
really
like
the
set
i
just
want
to
change
it
to
suit
my
tastes
it
looks
beautiful
it
will
find
a
home
among
my
other
mm
sets
as
a
favorite
iron
moose
good
question
its
about
17
inches
wide
11
inches
tall
with
ramp
down
and
16
inches
wide
as
for
the
platform
its
pretty
stable
it
tilts
back
a
small
degree
so
it
doesnt
collapse
when
tapped
on
the
nose
but
i
wouldnt
leave
it
on
the
edge
of
a
table
while
in
that
position
nice
review
just
one
little
point
since
there
is
no
sound
transmission
through
space
but
there
is
an
atmosphere
on
mars
through
which
this
this
thing
supposedly
flies
hypersonic
airplane
makes
far
more
sense
than
hypersonic
spacecraft
sorry
mr
mandalorian
i
guess
i
was
just
getting
a
bit
defensive
because
when
this
set
first
appeared
here
there
were
literally
2
pages
of
people
just
bagging
out
the
new
mm
sets
but
then
the
thread
took
a
turn
and
people
started
to
warm
to
them
much
like
the
agents
i
do
agree
that
it
definitely
needs
some
mocing
but
with
that
work
i
think
it
has
the
potential
to
be
a
really
amazing
set
in
terms
of
what
you
could
cram
into
it
the
lab
is
a
little
disappointing
ive
always
wanted
an
enclosed
cabin
space
in
a
vehicle
this
size
because
then
all
the
little
space
guys
can
have
a
true
meeting
place
the
dropdown
landing
ramp
is
my
favourite
part
it
has
lots
of
potential
uses
maybe
its
even
possible
to
integrate
pneumatics
d
hello
shefols
and
afols
as
well
as
tfols
welcome
to
eb
news
reviews
i
am
your
hostfor
tonight
anyway
shadows
will
take
over
after
this
episode
if
we
make
more
today
we
are
reviewing
mars
impulse
sets
5616
and
5617
starting
with
5617
alien
jet
i
must
say
it
is
a
small
and
quick
build
the
jellie
is
made
of
hard
plastic
which
surprised
me
as
i
had
expected
jellies
to
be
a
soft
plastic
the
jet
is
mainly
2x4
plates
some
swingy
hinges
the
seatbelt
and
a
thing
which
i
can
not
seem
to
name
my
one
gripe
about
it
is
that
the
jelly
cant
see
where
he
is
flying
it
looks
better
with
a
mf
in
it
there
was
a
red
1x1
as
a
spare
part
we
move
on
to
the
5616
mini
robot
which
is
basically
a
safe
brick
with
binoculars
soem
cheese
slopes
little
arms
and
legs
the
best
part
i
must
say
was
the
metal
detector
and
safe
brick
as
these
seem
to
be
quite
rare
in
sets
by
my
knowlage
anyway
the
austronaut
has
a
face
shown
in
dr
sinsters
review
the
set
also
comes
with
a
pickaxe
and
lime
green
gem
extra
peices
where
a
cheese
slope
a
green
1x1
and
a
white
droid
arm
that
concludes
these
minireviews
i
also
will
use
this
opportunity
to
show
my
photo
setup
both
sets
are
reccomended
if
you
either
need
a
army
or
are
just
trying
to
get
a
variaty
of
figs
like
myself

something

this

not

maybe
not

where

and
pretty
funny
i
don

like
that
little
alien
thingy
but
the
other
set
´
s
quite
nice
hate
to
admit
it
but
i
enjoy
staudies
humour
more
than
i
enjoy
shadows
highlights
include
the
inability
to
reach
the
cheese
and
the

luckily

for
belloq
and
guards
in
the
indy
line
doesnt
look
quite
as
hautain
as
this
one
buckbeak
looks
cool
looks
like
his
neckhead
can
be
moved
right
rather
similar
to
lego
horses
well
designed
the
orange
brick
doesnt
have
a
pumpkin
face
on
it
right
unlike
the
one
from
philosophers
stone
in
the
set
with
the
troll
im
looking
forward
to
more
reviews
by
you
sir
whitefang
good
work
no
printed
face
on
the
pumpkin
since
the
event
didnt
happen
on
or
near
halloween
unlike
the
whole
troll
situation
i
also
agree
that
this
draco
is
the
best
one
the
new
one
looks
too
much
like
a
draco
from
the
oldr
films
when
he
smirked
a
lot
more
but
since
very
character
got
a
redesignthey
had
to
tune
him
up
even
if
it
meant
changigng
him
for
the
worse
i
bought
about
5
or
6
of
these
sets
when
they
were
on
sale
in
mid
2006
i
still
have
a
few
of
them
laying
around
unopened
i
think
i
payed
like
under
5
for
each
and
thats
a
great
deal
for
all
the
variety
of
neat
parts
you
get
with
this
set
yay
the
monster
book
of
monsters
now
i
want
this
i
also
love
the
buckbeak
figure
it
looks
very
realistic
for
a
lego
version
of
something
usually
they
are
much
worse
look
at
the
goblins
for
example
very
cool
review
hello
eb
yes
im
cranking
out
the
reviews
the
other
day
i
picked
up
this
gem
for
an
okay
sales
price
at
devonport
tas
while
searching
for
the
new
batsets
i
informed
iamded
of
this
as
he
is
a
spideysuckup
and
he
informed
me
this
was
the
only
set
he
didnt
have
of
the
wave
2
of
this
theme
so
i
ask
you
great
eb
members
to
please
remind
him
of
this
when
commenting
here
we
go
with
the
review
of
doctopus
lair
anyway
unlike
other
reviews
this
stars
more
people
the
batbrickiamdeddragonatordaisy
review
daisy
is
the
mouse
that
came
in
the
set
first
up
re
the
figs
and
i
must
say
they
are
great
i
love
fleshies
and
these
are
excellent
to
expand
my
batman
world
plus
having
a
spiderman
to
beat
up
is
good
too
doctopus
is
great
though
his
tentacles
are
annoying
to
keep
in
order
peter
parker
is
a
nice
addition
i
love
that
torso
eve
though
harry
osborn
was
totally
absent
from
this
scene
i
welcome
him
as
he
is
a
good
fig
also
best
of
all
is
mary
jane
fleshie
females
are
hard
to
come
by
and
i
love
that
hair
my
very
first
one
oh
and
even
better
is
bley
daisy
on
the
far
right
another
fantastic
thing
is
that
by
mixing
mj
with
doctopus
you
get
a
far
more
deadly
and
real
villain
than
anyone
couldve
forseen
the
hippy
oh
cmon
tell
me
that
aint
cool
anyhoo
here
is
a
pic
of
doctopus
showing
his
might
random
fact
did
you
know
i
influence
both
dragonator
and
iamded
in
their
sigfigs
dragonator
adapts
his
from
my
ia
series
while
iamded
added
mutt
hair
when
i
had
him
like
that
in
a
pic
i
posted
now
onto
the
box
sorry
about
the
lighting
the
art
is
good
and
the
cartoon
spidey
in
the
corner
may
have
beenthe
inspiration
for
a
similar
style
in
the
new
batsets
back
of
the
box
again
sorry
about
the
lighting
and
blur
it
was
gtting
late
and
these
were
the
last
pics
finally
we
get
to
the
first
part
of
the
set
the
catapult
is
that
movie
accurate
or
what
i
love
the
part
in
sm2
when
he
uses
his
homemade
genetic
spider
powered
catapult
to
launch
himself
to
the
scene
oh
well
it
does
comes
with
a
cool
spider
web
an
trans
blue
spider
so
it
gets
some
points
and
it
is
really
fun
i
launched
spidey
several
metres
once
i
dont
think
he
ever
recovered
infact
he
almost
certainly
webbed
himself
slightly
cooler
extras
are
these
two
this
awesome
little
boat
is
great
for
city
as
is
the
simple
but
nice
bouy
daisy
approves
naturally
dragonator
ruins
everything
when
he
found
out
the
dragon
that
would
be
riding
with
him
was
our
nickname
for
daisy
now
finally
the
main
attraction
coctopus
dock
iamded
and
i
threw
dragonator
in
the
water
to
see
if
he
could
swim
he
er
couldnt
one
sweeney
todd
later
we
continue
the
overall
construction
of
the
building
is
very
good
i
know
a
lot
of
people
hated
stickers
and
i
hated
applying
these
but
they
do
look
spectacular
and
perfect
for
any
city
setting
like
a
bank
a
gotham
bank
as
iamded
has
already
noted
below
me
the
black
lifesavers
a
very
cool
as
are
the
web
piece
and
log
pieces
the
inside
contains
the
neutron
copperplate
triple
bypass
humdrum
holy
hum
5000
which
does
does
see
movie
anyhoo
it
is
very
cool
and
includes
a
little
control
thingy
on
the
yellow
brick
next
to
it
unfortunately
the
inside
is
plain
but
for
that
the
other
side
has
no
wall
too
which
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
really
but
atleast
it
allows
daisy
easy
access
one
gripe
is
those
yellow
1x1
bricks
they
serve
no
purpose
and
break
up
the
colour
scheme
better
shot
of
the
thingy
thing
i
quite
like
it
the
use
of
technic
parts
actually
works
and
the
whole
set
is
worth
it
for
those
purple
flames
and
dishes
alone
it
closes
up
pretty
well
too
unable
to
hit
the
dish
which
is
a
nice
feature
me
and
iamded
liked
it
so
much
we
threw
a
revived
dragonator
into
it
unfortunately
it
disagreed
with
him
but
it
was
fun
another
shot
of
the
dock
i
like
how
they
have
gaps
in
the
jetty
i
know
the
movie
version
was
pretty
wack
and
although
the
set
isnt
very
faithful
to
it
looks
more
like
a
seaside
library
to
be
frank
it
still
is
very
nice
this
is
my
first
large
blue
baseplate
too
which
is
wonderful
though
funny
how
the
set
only
uses
about
half
of
it
the
roof
is
a
well
designed
and
fun
feature
it
uses
some
technic
connections
to
render
it
flexible
of
any
degree
as
you
can
see
here
by
my
opening
of
it
better
shot
of
the
roof
design
it
can
lie
flat
or
at
any
angle
i
might
use
the
design
myself
in
the
future
as
much
as
i
love
the
building
this
feature
bugs
me
for
in
order
for
it
to
work
this
wall
has
to
stick
out
which
not
only
looks
ugly
but
makes
you
be
able
to
see
through
the
corners
still
easily
modded
and
log
pieces
are
fantastic
for
mocing
it
also
means
that
there
are
7
windows
all
up
for
a
good
sizeable
building
by
pulling
out
the
piece
in
the
center
the
walls
both
collapss
sideways
outwards
which
is
actually
pretty
fun
and
works
everytime
overall
view
of
the
set
including
characters
now
for
the
story
that
makes
no
senseat
all
spiderman
is
dead
after
falling
down
the
wall
mechanism
see
above
only
daisy
can
save
the
day
for
dragonator
is
being
held
by
the
evil
doctopus
and
iamded
and
dragonator
are
too
busy
not
caring
and
brainbox
is
too
busy
complaining
that
this
goes
against
all
marvel
continuity
unfortunately
daisy
is
on
a
lunchbreak
so
tough
luck
dragonator
and
daisy
goes
on
a
search
for
fortune
and
glory
okay
this
is
what
i
think
of
the
set
build
35
fun
but
those
stickers
ruin
the
experience
somewhat
and
if
you
dont
apply
them
the
instructions
are
a
bit
hard
to
follow
playability
45
great
little
gizmos
and
bits
not
the
kind
that
keep
you
going
like
with
the
2007
aquabase
but
good
fun
still
design
45
not
very
movie
faithful
no
but
still
a
great
little
building
and
a
smart
design
for
certain
aspects
minifigs
55
great
figs
with
all
different
faces
and
very
useful
bits
price
25
far
far
overpriced
even
on
sale
sadly
total
1825
a
good
set
that
couldve
been
better
with
a
few
minor
changes
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
it
doesnt
really
cross
the
line
to
greatness
that
said
it
has
a
lot
going
for
it
and
definitely
worth
buying
or
atleast
a
look
thanks

great
review
batbrick
i
was
curious
as
to
what
the
interior
of
the
building
looked
like
i
still
think
that
there
should
have
been
a
few
random
chains
or
something
lying
around
as
they
may
add
to
the
abandoned
feeling
that
the
ware
house
had
though
i
have
to
admit
that
i
really
like
the
roof
dock
and
minifigs
as
some
of
them
make
good
average
civilians
that
are
somewhat
hard
to
come
by
in
todays
sets
great
comic
as
well
it
seemed
to
add
a
lot
to
your
review
hope
you
can
review
another
spider
man
set
soon
btw
as
adam
mentioned
i
believe
you
owe
me
a
bar
of
soap
for
reading
your

am
great
review
the
hippy
and
the
story
at
the
end
were
hilarious
i
think
this
was
easily
the
best
of
the
spiderman
2
sets
youre
right
though
it
wasnt
movie
acurate
as
the
actual
movie
dock
was
far
shabbier
and
more
trashed
than
this
ah
well
i
guess
tlc
couldnt
do

i
really
want
this

the

at

was
neat
except
for

my
favourite
part
was
the
exploding
dragonator
nothing

just
looks
cool
when
people
are

into

sorry
to
all
for
the
delay
since
this
was
supposed
to
be
done
3
days
ago
anyway
to
get
on
with
it
quite
a
minimal
amount
of
baggies
for
this
set
as
noticed
and
the
best
thing
is
no
sticker
sheet
yippee
bounce
the
completed
vwing
though
not
really
a
complaint
it
would
be
nice
if
the
entire
astromech
body
was
provided
instead
of
only
the
head
dome
p
of
course
then
it
wouldnt
be
movieaccurate
since
the
q7
series
astromech
is
integrated
with
the
starfighter
lol
hes
definitely
wellpainted
for
a
simple
minifig
since
even
the
back
is
painted
too
i
have
to
assumed
this
is
the
same
minifig
provided
for
7259
arc170
starfighter
too
since
i
dont
have
that
set
anyway
this
minifig
is
much
more
accurate
for
this
vwing
since
his
suit
is
rated
against
vacuum
while
those
in
the
arc170
arent
p
one
thing
thats
lacking
is
the
instruments
panel
in
the
cockpit
its
totally
nonexistent
here
i
wonder
what
went
wrong
during
the
design
stage
personally
this
is
the
second
most
anticipated
set
for
2006
the
first
being
the
tie
interceptor
for
me
one
thing
is
that
theres
no
known
release
of
the
vwing
starfighter
by
hasbro
nor
the
other
wellknown
brands
the
other
thing
is
that
being
a
star
wars
vehicle
collector
i
would
really
loved
to
see
a
replica
toy
of
the
vwing
and
the
vwing
by
the
lego
group
does
not
disappoint
its
nearly
movieaccurate
except
for
the
cockpit
transparisteel
cover
which
could
used
some
paint
like
the
xwings
also
theres
a
permanent
landing
gear
that
quite
neat
since
it
allows
you
to
land
the
craft
on
uniform
surfaces
the
sfoils
on
the
other
hand
can
be
quite
a
pain
to
pose
into
flight
position
very
difficult
for
the
sfoils
to
remain
symmetrical
during
play
the
swooshable
or
play
factor
of
this
product
is
quite
good
just
check
out
the
pics
for
yourself
d
crackle
general
skywalker
we
have
incoming
to
conclude
the
vwing
starfighter
would
make
a
much
better
companion
to
the
eta2
actis
interceptor
jedi
starfighter
than
the
arc170
coz
the
arc170
seems
more
like
a
longrange
bomber
to
me
than
a
snubfighter

and

show
it
at
rest

for

just
an
updated

to

latest

hmm
off
the
record
i
do
understand
that
sometimes
reviews
by
most
tend
to
a
certain
set
of
guidelines
like
naming
the
set
and
showing
the
boxed
and
out
of
boxed
pics
and
of
course
the
grading
portion
regarding
my
review
i
prefer
not
to
grade
any
of
the
lego
sets
at
all
as
far
as
possible
because
to
each
hisher
own
my
reasons
to
put
up
a
review
is
not
to
belittle
the
efforts
of
tlg
in
coming
out
with
these
products
nor
to
help
them
market
them
but
to
show
my
appreciation
and
enjoyment
of
these
products
i
hope
noone
is
offended
by
this
and
would
like
to
apologise
for
any
misunderstanding
that
this
may
caused
for
those
who
do
not
understand
the
above
paragraph
care
not
for
it
and
play
on
like
me
thanks
for
the
detailed
review
valentin
it
had
good
picture
quality
and
a
nice
little

near
the
end
although
this
is
a
slightly
older

it
still
was
a
good
one
i
remmeber
that
i
bought
two
of
them
to
build
up
a
small
airforce
for
the
republic
and
if
i
see
another
one
i
may
buy
it
for
use
in
the

keep
up
the
good
work

more
pieces
than
the
average
tie
fighter
but
this
is
actually
cheaper
than
the
7263
tie
fighter
of
course
theres
no
lightup
feature
in
this
set
sweat
yesh
finally
a
tie
interceptor
this
is
probably
the
most
anticipated
for
all
set
for
all
lego
tie
collectors
worldwide
since
the
fighter
bomber
advanced
and
even
the
expanded
universe
droid
fighter
had
been
released
by
the
lego
group
this
set
is
near
movieaccurate
since
the
bottom
part
of
it
aint
p
the
cockpit
and
pylons
uses
the
same
design
as
that
of
the
tie
advanced
piloted
by
darth
vader
except
for
one
minor
change
that
is
the
aft
interior
of
the
cockpit
is
strengthen
this
time
and
this
is
indeed
good
news
since
the
older
models
had
a
problem
of
hard
hinge
and
loose
brick
connection
theres
no
landing
gear
for
this
set
but
it
doesnt
require
it
anyway
this
tie
interceptor
balances
perfectly
on
its
wings
standard
instruments
panel
and
of
course
standard
imperial
pilot
the
swooshable
or
play
factor
of
this
set
is
definitely
very
high
just
take
a
look
d
camera
view
from
own
craft
camera
view
from
tieadvanced
combat
simulation
of
endors
battle
from
the
archives
no
bomber
since
i
started
late
in
recollecting
p
to
conclude
for
a
typical
lego
fan
this
set
is
a
6040
60
due
to
its
good
design
and
for
a
typical
star
wars
fan
this
is
a
mustget
the
only
flaw
for
this
set
is
the
same
flaw
for
any
lego
set
in
sg
the
price
doh
commentcurrent
in
2008
being
a
starwars
fan
no
being
a
typical
toy
collector
space
is
definitely
a
premium
so
much
so
that
i
turned
to
lego
starwars
to
sate
my
appetite
for
more
starwars
products
when
i
already
have
no
more
display
space
for
the
next
few
nonlego
pictures
they
are
the
crown
of
my
starfighter
collection
in
118
scale
so
just
view
them
for
fun
eh
and
no
i
havent
had
the
chance
nor
the
time
to
do
up
a
scene
of
my
lego
starfighters
blowing
up
spectacularly
since
the
pieces
would
be
very
hard
to
put
back
hmm
then
again
isnt
that
what
lego
is
about
doh
great
set
but
i
scrapped
it
since
im
not
big
on
space
nice
set
though
and
a
good
review
jifel

review
thanks
for
posting

very
good
thanks

all
the
pics

want
to
buy

set
too
they
are
so
big
but
why
did
lego

these
strange
blackdblue
colors
this
set
is
very
old
i
saw
it
one
time
in
my
local
toyshop
for
69
euro
and

its
gone

will
look
on
ebay

69
euro
boy
be
happy
you
didnt

completely
insane
price

pm
i
picked
up
this
set
mainly
because
of
the
many
5spare
glow
in
the
dark
parts
and
the
promise
of
2
racers
and
one
helicopter
for
the
price
of
a
little
more
than
two
racers
90kr
vs
2x40kr
the
box
the
back
of
the
box
shows
the
two
alternate
models
you
can
build
if
the
polybags
rip
there
are
3
cheese
slopes
and
two
1x2
tiles
that
glow
in
the
dark
where
the
tiles
are
exclusive
for
this
set
the
total
parts
count
is
high
at
142
but
there
are
no
really
big
pieces
among
them
inside
the
box
you
will
find
the
building
instructions
a
sheet
with
some
odd
sticky
labels
thrown
away
and
3
polybags
marked
by
the
bag
building
difficulty
the
models
the
lime
colored
car
doesnt
bring
out
anything
new
we
have
seen
racers
built
like
that
before
but
it
does
contain
some
nice
bricks
for
the
collection
the
police
cruiser
surprises
with
an
interesting
design
along
the
sides
as
seen
here
it
is
harder
to
build
because
of
the
greater
level
of
details
the
helicopter
is
without
doubt
the
hardest
vehicle
to
build
in
a
bag
i
cant
finish
it
because
its
larger
than
the
bag
you
cant
put
on
the
top
blades
nor
the
tail
of
the
thing
so
it
beats
the
forklift
from
7733
where
the
top
bar
is
the
new
kind
that
doesnt
completely
fit
there
is
also
instructions
for
the
alternate
models
but
it
requires
the
bags
to
be
opened
the
vehicles
are
pretty
standard
for
the
racers
theme
with
the
police
car
being
the
highlight
of
the
set
conclusion
i
like
the
difficulty
curve
between
bag
1
and
2
but
the
last
bag
should
be
labeled
1000000
instead
of
3
it
requires
some
inhuman
skills
to
build
that
helicopter
in
the
bag
lime
colored
car
3
we
have
seen
it
before
but
it
has
some
nice
pieces
and
lime
police
cruiser
9
it
has
a
massive
diffusers
rare
parts
and
a
high
level
of
details
it
is
a
shame
lego
relies
so
much
on
stickers
helicopter
6
if
you
see
it
as
a
set
for
one
fourth
of
the
price
of
the
cars
it
is
quite
amazing
but
you
cant
bag
build
it
and
i
would
personally
prefer
some
more
detail
instead
of
the
big
size
overall
it
is
a
nice
little
set
but
the
police
car
is
the
main
attraction
i
wouldnt
get
the
other
vehicles
if
they
were
sold
separately

set
nice
review
but
i
think
bag
building
is
a
boring
way
to
build
seeming
as
there
were
no
reviews
of
this
set
in
the
index
i
have
uploaded
mine
from
jabbas
hutt
here
is
my
review
for
lego
set
10178
motorized
walking
atat
because
i
live
in
the
uk
i
got
this
set
with
6
free
duracell
batteries
which
was
great
its
just
twice
as
expensive
as
the
us
heres
the
basic
set
that
is
from
the
instructions
this
is
the
cockpit
but
please
note
after
i
took
this
photo
i
realised
it
was
slightly
built
wrong
heres
one
of
the
feet
in
proportion
to
a
minifig
to
give
you
a
general
size
this
is
luke
skywalker
swinging
on
a
wire
trying
to
destroy
the
atat
i
really
wish
lego
didnt
make
so
many
lukes
because
i
want
differnt
minifigs
it
would
also
be
nice
for
a
thermal
detonator
piece
underneath
the
atat
you
can
see
the
shaft
that
moves
the
back
legs
the
motor
and
squeezed
in
on
the
righ
t
the
massive
battery
box
a
load
of
cogs
that
move
the
legs
these
are
the
included
figures
snowtrooper
general
maximilian
veers
atat
driverpilot
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
him
and
luke
all
whithout
there
wepons
please
note
veers
should
have
a
dark
stone
snowtroooper
torso
with
4
red
and
blue
badge
things
not
3
these
are
the
figures
with
weapons
i
gave
them
and
the
included
ones
snowtrooper
has
new
style
blaster
veers
has
standard
light
grey
pistol
like
the
ones
from
the
old
adventure
sets
atat
driver
has
old
style
blaster
which
i
call
heavy
blaster
and
luke
has
shiny
handle
blue
light
sabre
the
shiny
blue
light
sabre
was
included
with
the
set
which
is
a
bonus
because
i
really
dont
like
the
grey
ones
httpwwwbrickshelsc00521jpgjpg
this
is
the
switch
which
is
attached
to
the
battery
box
on
either
side
of
the
atat
underneath
the
lift
up
side
panels
you
push
the
forward
to
walk
forward
and
backward
to
walk
backwards
simple
eh
a
front
veiw
with
the
the
panels
open
here
are
the
drivers
controls
which
are
simply
a
cotrol
panel
and
2
exoforce
robot
hands
which
are
joystick
things
seen
in
the
film
if
you
look
closley
the
almost
useless
carry
handle
this
is
the
weird
back
piece
looking
down
the
atat
from
the
back
where
you
can
see
the
the
battery
box
and
switch
troops
decending
from
ropes
and
cables
and
vader
leading
the
assult
for
this
i
hadnt
got
any
more
imps
so
i
used
clones
pilots
i
now
have
a
whole
load
more
snowtroopers
solo
and
chewie
sabotaging
more
troops
to
squash
rebel
scum
huzahh
a
very
bad
picture
of
everyone
packed
up
inside
the
size
incomparison
to
its
predecessor
overall
i
would
give
this
set
910
because
it
should
come
with
more
snowtroopers
or
it
could
be
and
endor
version
with
loads
of
strormies
and
scout
troopers
aswell
as
this
you
can
really
sit
any
one
down
because
of
the
battery
box
but
i
stilll
find
space
to
put
all
the
shown
figures
on
this
review
in
the
interior
as
you
can
see
on
the
above
image
the
chains
and
ropes
are
hanging
down
a
bit
tjis
set
is
now
limited
to
5
per
customer
in
the
uk
and
now
no
longer
comes
with
free
batteries
the
walking
on
this
is
a
bit
wonky
and
dosent
really
walk
like
they
do
in
the
film
as
it
moves
two
legs
at
a
time
i
am
currently
attaching
a
motor
to
the
head
to
make
it
move
independently
i
mean
by
the
clone
turbo
tank
turned
into
the
atat
i
think
in
the
films
when
they
changed
all
there
technology
and
vehicles
when
they
became
the
empire
nice
job
with
this
review
skipper
nice
review
i
echo
the
sentiment
that
more
snowies
would
have
been
better

said
i
doubt
that
the
atat
was
used
in
the
clone
wars
well
you
never
know
maby
veers
was
around
then
just
because
it
was
used
in
the
clone
wars
dosent
mean
that
veers
didnt
design
it
to
wookiepedia
i
never
got
the
set
it
looked
way
to
skinny
i
came
close
to
buying
it
for
the
figs
but
then
decided
not
to
if
you
compared
this
one
to
the
later
one
there
is
a
big
difference
this
one
just
didnt
seem
proporshined
with
the
legs
and
its
body
thank
you
for
the
review
skipper
i
never
got
this
set
because
it
was
too
expensive
and
motorized
it
completley
reminded
me
of
the
old
robotic
toys
called
zoids
or
maybe
even
gundum
at
least
the
figs
are
great
a
chrome
lightsabe
hilt
for
luke
ecxellent
and
the
pilot
is
cool
too
and
another
snowie
doesnt
hurt
and
i
didnt
even
know
about
the
commander
guy
whatever
you
call
him
so
people
could
have
made
a
custom
ds
this
whole
time
thanks
again
this
is
one
of
those
sets
that
you
just
have
to
have
i
mean
a
motorised
atat
is
a
dream
set
for
original
trilogy
fans
and
has
an
awesome
set
of
minifigures
thanks
for
the
review
kimt
it
comes
at
a
confusing
time
you
can
take
off
the
top
disk
and
lift
it
like
the
millennium
falcon
from
the
top
now
i
actually
dont
like
this
set
that
much
it
takes
about
5
hours
and
15
minutes
to
build
if
you
do
it
in
one
go
but
the
repeating
sections
makes
this
built
the
most
tedious
i
have
experienced
it
has
way
too
many
holes
from
which
you
can
see
the
colorful
skeleton
and
is
overpriced
compared
to
the
older
10030
isd
i
remember
thinking
it
was
too
expensive
when
it
was
50
off
at
sh
even
the
snowspeeder
was
kewler
to
less
than
half
the
price
good
job
kimt
it
´
s
a
really
nice
set
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
the
size
of
ds2
ucs
compared
with
the
new

i
was

as
for
the
review
thanks
the
build
was
a
bit
boring
and
i
suppose
a
big
grey
ball
isnt
all
that
interesting
but
since
the
death
star
ii
in
the
movie
is
a
big
grey
ball
too
i
dont
see
the
problem
i
didnt
think
it
was
particularly
fragile
i
dont
care
about
minifigs
or
playability
either
a
few
plusses
in
my
opinion
it
looked
pretty
damn
impressive
sitting
in
my
lego
room
and
the
construction
is
really
clever
all
in
all
i
actually
liked
this
one
but
perhaps
i
have
a
different
expectation
of
sets
than
most
of
you
sets
are
mainly
parts
packs
and
would
you
look
at
the
quantity
of
grey
plate
in
this
thing
its
new
grey
btw
i
paid
half
price
for
it
at
shophome
uk
which
is
still
a
lot
more
than
half
price
from
the
us
and
i
didnt
regret
it
for
a
second

here
are
some
advantages
that
makes
isd

for

a

more
fun
to

with
less

it
is
easier
to
build
alternate
models
from
it
how
many
alternate
models
of
the
ds2
have
you
seen
the
bricks
are
more
varied
you
get
magnets
it
is
a
larger
set
if
you
look

the
size
its
more
intresting

look
at
its

just
ordered
the
bits
for
this
from
bricklink
im
awaiting
the
final
order
now
so
im
interested
in
these
comments
i
can
see
that
since
ill
be
building
it
with
the
kids
ill
have
to
plan
in
plenty
of
breaks
and
do
lots
of
parallel
building
to
keep
us
all
from
getting
bored
very
nice

i
havent
bought
this
set
yet
but
am
planning
to
just
to
get
a
gg
fig
as
i
dont
have
one
already
bought
an
imperial

instead
this
week
as
it
was
on

but
after
this

is

to
follow

my

you
touch
it

he
may
have

put
me
off
the

great
set
great
review
i
have
it
too
and
i
am
very
glad
to
own
it

will
probably
be
the
cheapest
and
best
way
to
get
a
grievous
fig
for
a
while
even
though
it
doesnt
come
with
a

carrying

cart

with

flick
fire

marching
into
the
lands
of
the
crown
kingdom
crown
knights
must
be
ready
for
this
new
troll
addition
from
what
i
see
this
set
has
a
very
minimum
piece
count
since
its
an
impulse
set
there
is
no
unique
parts
found
in
this
set
however
this
set
has
a
couple
of
useful
accessories
such
as
2
spears
and
2
wooden
wheels
and
a
grey
mouse
running
around
this
set
is
another
alternative
for
castle
army
builders
to
buy
multiple
sets
to
build
a
massive
troll
armies
in
addition
the
flick
missile
really
works
use
a
little
bit
of
force
from
your
finger
and
flick
it
the
missile
will
fly
well
it
certainly
does
not
impress
me
at
all
with
such
playing
feature
base
of
the
cart
different
angles
there
is
one
thing
i
dislike
about
this
set
the
wooden
wheels
are
too
big
and
it
is
the
same
as
the
ones
in
the
crossbow
attack
i
prefer
the
smaller
wheels
that
exist
in
old
castle
sets
that
produced
smaller
cart
since
this
cart
size
is
similar
to
the
old
cart
size
the
old
wizards
cart
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
proposed
wheel

and
pieces

the
playability

is
not
fanastic
design
6510
design
is
adequate
if
the
wheels
is
much
smaller
and
the
flicking
thing
disappear
the
score
will
be
much
higher
price
810
an
inexpensive
set
to
get
a
troll
warrior
and
a
mouse
overall
610
to
conclude
this
set
is
good
only
for
army
builders
a
new
range
of
millitary

to
be
added
thats

i
only
owned
its

this

has

i

it

the

no
it

i
find
it
a

wierd
for
spacecraft
normally
i
thought
joystick
is
the
typical
navigation
controls
for
a
spacecraft
instead
of
a
steering
wheel
i
am
not
complaining
about
a
steering
wheel
in
a

to
me
its
quite
an
uncommon
sight
anyway
the

this
is
quite
a
nice

actually
it
evokes
some
of
the
design
elements
of
the
mx11
while
looking
different
enough
to
justify
me
buying
it
the
head
on
the
astronaut
is
one
i
like
so
even
better
i
hadnt
realised
it
was
that
one
actually
does
26
pieces
make
it
one
of
the
bigger
impulses

i
think
i
may
have
to
get
one
if
not
two
plus
its
called
crystal

how
can
that
not
be

kept

this

really
appealed
from
the
moment
i
laid
eyes
on
it
i
feel
the
swooshability
and
cool
extras
like
the

the

i
have
always
wanted

since

with

i
think
i
will
get

i
didnt

know
where
this

the

but
i

in
here
cause
its
somewhat

related
i
got
this
nifty
little
set
yesterday
from
an
auction
ebay
new
and

i

the

was
a

i
wish
they
would

any
different
in

design
to
the

i
got
this

last

and
i
think
you
made
a
mistake
when
you
have
remove
a
piece
to
access
the
probe
droids
and
equipment
you
just
have
to
slide
the
entire
main
part
and
i
have
a
question
is
this
equipped
with
the
new
flickfire
missiles
that
dont
fall
off
thank
you
for
the
nice
review
i
like
the
design
although
i
didnt
want
to
buy
it
the
new
little
speeder
is
very
nice
but
maybe
a
little
to
small
darth

eyes
are
looking
a

does

it

there
is

the

nice
review
rezourceman
i
wanted
to
see
one
of
this
set
it
seems
there
isnt
much
to
it
other
than
what
it
looks
like
in
the
official
pictures
but
i
may
well
get
it
i
like
slime
face
great
review
rezourceman
your
pics
really
show
off
the
sub
well
and
its
good
to
see
the
build
in
progress
i
also
have
this
set
but
i
didnt
apply
stickers
to
the
sub
as
i
was
planning
to
reuse
the
nice
dark
blue
pieces
however
as
shown
in
your
review
they
do
brighten
it
up
a
fair
bit
i
cant
say
this
is
my
favourite
agents
set
the
boat
is
a
little
oddly
proportioned
and
the
sub
although
retro
looking
has
practically
no
interior
and
would
be
difficult
to
customise
to
put
more
in
unlike
say
the
clever
job
batbrick
did
with
the
penguin
sub
in
his
review
the
sub
kind
of
looks
like
some
jules
verneish
sea
creature
i
would
have
liked
it
if
theyd
gone
all
the
way
and
made
it
some
kind
of
giant
robot
jellyfish
or
squid
i
do
agree
with
you
about
slime
face
he
has
a
fantastic
torso
with
all
the
slime
dripping
down
which
is
a
bit
obscured
by
the
air
tank
its
really
encouraging
that
in
the
last
2
missions
weve
had
great
extra
villains
added
in
the
only
thing
i
would
add
about
the
octopus
is
that
the
glow
in
the
dark
plastic
is
mixed
in
unevenly
with
the
aqua
blue
so
it
doesnt
glow
in
the
dark
evenly
its
kind
of
like
the
mars
mission
jellies
in
that
respect
though
much
cooler

the

that
is
such
a
great

sort
of
keep
the

make
it
bigger
with
the
8636

theres
really
only
room
for
one

to
sit
and
despite
its

theres
just
a
few
not

tlc
is
really
going
allout
with
the

i
wonder
if
it
will
last
longer
than

year
unlike

my
only
real
criticism
of
the
theme
is
those
freaking
stickers
my
god
look
at
the
size
of
that
dss
in
this
set

this

totally
owns

the

the
acessories

everything
is
better

may
have
my
vote
for
the
best
theme
of

year

i
wonder
if
it
will
last
longer
than

year
unlike
other

oh
dont
worry
a
second
wave
will
be
coming
next

this
was
confirmed
by
both
legomilk
and
in
an
interview
with
an

designer
great
looking
set
and
that
glowy
blue

is

i

and
black
bricks
with
classic
blue
space
pieces
the
result
was
this
great
classic
vehicle
the
set
includes
two
figs
still
red
and
white
heres
a
view
of
the
vehicle
which
is
really
two
components
the
vehicle
itself
and
the
lab
section
i
absolutely
loved
the
the
blue
windshield
slopes
2
included
and
the
unique
upsidedown
large
blue
slope
in
the
back
of
the
vehicle
is
the
blue
lab
the
back
section
of
the
vehicle
has
hinges
that
allow
the
jets
sections
to
open
the
brick
design
fits
perfectly
into
the
lab
and
when
opened
the
lab
falls
to
the
ground
note
the
little
round
trans
red
1x1s
allow
the
lab
to
slide
up
and
forward
when
the
jet
sections
are
closed
i
tried
taking
off
the
red
1x1s
and
the
lab
does
not
lift
as
easily
with
them
the
design
is
very
clever
esp
for
a
classic
set
heres
a
shot
of
the
standalone
lab
unlike
earlier
classic
space
windows
this
set
has
train
window
frames
with
yellow
windows
the
top
of
the
lab
lifts
up
for
playability
inside
the
lab
are
several
computers
and
a
swivel
chair
back
to
the
vehicle
heres
a
shot
of
the
cockpit
with
white
steering
wheel
the
left
side
has
an
upsidedown
wrench
and
black
antenna
the
right
side
a
walkietalkie
and
another
antenna
the
antennas
can
be
used
as
breaks
to
keep
the
middle
wheels
from
moving
heres
ashot
of
the
under
carriage
and
a
final
shot
of
the
complete
set

those

oh
man
this
review
takes
me
back
i
got
this
set
when
i
was
8
years
old
and
loved
it
i
remember
modding
it
to
remove
the
lab
in
the
back
and
i
put
in
a
giant
laser
cannon
instead
cause
when
youre
8
years
old
everything
needs
a
giant
laser
cannon

said
the
only
bad
thing
about
this
set
is
the
name
it
cant
even
roll
over
a
single
plates
height
not
very
all
terrain
at
all
ha
very
true
the
vehicle
is
built
so
low
to
the
ground
that
the
front
end
catches
on
everything

yes
the
extra
space
was
probably
for
the
oxygen
tanks
on
the
figs
it
makes
taking
them
off
a
lot
easier
as
for
the
labcontrol
center
i
never
had
an
issue
with
it
being
open
i
think
this
was
just
for
playability
one
could
always
pretend
that
some
sort
of
invisible
force
ray
closed
the
side
when
activated
invisible
force
fieldray
that
is
a
very
neat
idea
i
dont
have
much
problem
with
it
either
was
just
curious
about
the
design
as
i
am
not
very
familar
with
classic
space
i
supposed
the
oxygen
tanks
is
quite
big
to
carry
around
especially
when
the
vehicle
is
so
cramped
these
allowance
of
space
makes
them
much
mobile
to
move
about
in
the
vehicle

many
of

the
fish
doctor
is
supposed
to
have
a
new
torso
says
who
i
think
the
one
he
has
is
fine
i
never
have
buy
a
sponge
bob
set
but
this
looks
so
cool
so
maybe
just
maybe
i
will
buy
it
i
am
curious
of
why
tlc
haven
´
t
done
the
flying
dutchman
ship
it
was
in
the
first
rumor
list
of
sponge
bob
sets
that
surely
will
be
a
must
my
fish
doctor
has
the
torso
from
7902
doctors
car
which
is
unfortunate
because
the
other
torso
is
more
stylized
and
cartoonish
i
think
however
i
did
have
that
mad
scientist
lab
set
so
a
bit
of
digging
through
my
old
collection
will
hopefully
yield
the
better
torso
i
recently
bought
this
set
for
my
daughters
birthday
its
the
first
belville
set
that
ive
bought
for
her
so
its
a
bit
of
an
experiment
the
house
is
5
rooms
and
its
made
up
of
mostly
large
pieces
there
still
is
a
decent
amount
of
normal
lego
in
it
though
the
doorways
in
the
house
align
when
it
is
opened
out
starting
with
the
bathroom
included
is
a
shower
toilet
sink
with
vanity
and
a
baby
potty
the
mirror
sticker
is
one
of
the
few
that
i
put
on
the
open
plan
loungekitchendining
room
is
well
appointed
as
well
and
it
has
a
nice
glass
table
and
coffee
machine
the
kitchen
chairs
are
fabuland
parts
and
dont
work
really
well
it
seems
they
are
having
jellyfish
for
dinner
the
clock
is
the
only
printed
part
in
the
set
upstairs
is
a
baby
room
and
the
master
bedroom
the
radio
and
the
tv
not
shown
were
stickers
to
my
disappointment
up
top
is
an
extra
room
suitable
for
reading
those
antenna
things
were
made
from
spare
parts
by
my
daughter
i
have
no
idea
what
they
are
supposed
to
be
there
are
some
stickers
that
go
on
the
back
but
i
didnt
put
them
on
as
it
is
the
set
looks
ok
this
way
but
since
it
is
a
dolls
house
it
doesnt
really
matter
i
do
think
though
that
the
fireplace
should
have
been
given
a
back
the
bbq
is
made
from
normal
parts
and
is
quite
effective
i
think
it
uses
the
same
light
brick
thats
in
the
4998
stegosaurus
set
my
kids
were
using
it
as
a
torch
before
my
grumbling
ruined
their
fun
like
all
belville
sets
the
highlight
is
arguably
the
accessories
ill
be
borrowing
a
few
of
these
from
time
to
time
here
is
the
controversial
baby
catapult
as
you
can
see
it
works
ok
but
lego
probably
should
have
tried
a
bit
harder
we
also
bought
for
her
7583
playful
puppy
it
also
comes
with
some
nice
accessories
but
not
enough
to
justify
buying
unless
you
want
the
rest
of
the
parts
poor
puppy
where
does
he
sleep
here
is
my
daughter
assembling
it
she
made
me
make
the
house
though
as
she
wanted
to
play
a
game
we
bought
her
note
the
lego
drink
bottles
i
didnt
take
any
photos
of
the
figures
as
they
dont
seem
to
be
anything
new
but
i
can
if
people
want
me
to
at
the
time
i
was
in
bit
of
a
hurry
as
i
took
these
before
bed
so
i
wouldnt
be
stressed
if
the
kids
broke
it
the
next
day
overall
these
sets
seem
overpriced
to
me
and
hard
to
justify
unless
you
actually
want
a
buildable
dolls
house
which
we
did
its
still
too
early
to
tell
if
my
daughter
likes
it
or
not
but
at
this
stage
it
seems
she
lost
interest
in
a
few
days
she
does
tend
to
go
back
to
toys
though

am
i
was
sort
of
hoping
for
a
flickfire
baby
still
this
looks
decent
for
what
it
is
i
guess
obviously
it
really
is
all
about
the
accessories
and
its
got
em
but
not
enough
to
make
me
spend
that
kind
of
cash
and
i
dont
even
mind
having
a
pile
of
pink
parts
around
if
you
throw
in
a
complete
turkey
or
some
birthday
cakes
its
a
slam
dunk
but
as
it
is
eh
thanks
for
the
review
though
its
very
nicely
presented
and
leaves
no
doubt
in
my
mind
as
to
just
how
easy
this
set
would
be
to
misuse
for
other
purposes
nice
review
good
to
see
your
almost
letting
your
kids
play
with
your
lego
i
like
the
functionality
of
the
baby
catapult
its
good
that
they
include
some
working
features
in
a
build
this
big
are
you
not
showing
the
figures
because
its
really

im
still
undecided
on
if
it
was
a

buy
she
played
with
it
a
lot
this
week
but
last
week
she
ignored
it
and
i
had
to
fix
it
twice
my
daughter
is
12
and
she
still
plays
with
all
her
belville
stuff
mostly
the
fairy
princess
castle
sets
if
your
daughter
is
anything
like
mine
you
will
definitely
get
your
moneys
worth
out
of
it
however
as
soon
as
my
daughter
says
shes
done
with
it
i
plan
on
raiding
the
sets
for
all
those
great
food
and
accessory
bits
patience
great
review
by
the
way
the
belville
sets
are
indeed
overpriced
but
theyre
probably
legos
best
attempt
at
wooing
the
girl
audience
i
still
hate
the
fact
that
tlc
thinks
they
need
separate
boy
themes
and
girl
themes
but
whatever
theyre
a
very
nice
alternative
to
barbie
you
get
posable
figures
with
realistic
body
proportions
plus
some
creativity
and
building
aspects
thrown
in
i
bought
this
today
mainly
because
it
was
25
off
but
id
been
eyeing
it
for
a
long
time
the
accessories
truly
are
brilliant
theres
so
much
here
to
be
pillaged
for
other
uses
as
people
have
said
i
picked
up
heaps
of
new
parts
ive
never
had
or
rare
ones
in
even
rarer
colours
to
be
honest
i
was
surprised
and
impressed
by
the
range
and
versatility
of
the
regular
bricks
as
well
when
you
look
at
the
box
art
what
jumps
out
at
you
are
the
giant
pink
walls
and
curved
pieces
but
theres
a
nice
amount
of
white
arches
and
lime
green
bricks
not
to
mention
all
the
windows
and
the
trans
blue
1x2x5
bricks
and
plants
its
a
good
thing
the
target
audience
likes
stickers
though
theres
more
here
than
ive
seen
on
any
set
except
the
7709
sentai
fortress
i
think
they
were
aiming
for
one
sticker
per
page
of
instructions
i
hope
belville
returns
in
2010

welcome
to
my
third
review
on
eurobricks
i
hope
you
enjoy
while
at
any
store
that
sells
lego
target
walmart
tru
etc
you
will
notice
that
the
clone
battle
packs
on
the
shelf
are
way
fewer
in
number
than
the
droids
battle
pack
as
you
might
guess
the
clones
are
way
more
popular
and
finding
them
gets
harder
and
harder
as
the
release
date
of
this
set
goes
farther
into
the
past
so
stock
up
alright
heres
a
pic
of
the
box
a
small
box
as
expected
for
inexpensive
sets
like
these
note
the
build
your
army
button
on
the
front
tlg
obviously
is
encouraging
customers
to
buy
multiples
and
with
good
reason
which
will
be
explained
later
in
this
review
well
lets
get
straight
to
it
the
contents
of
this
set
you
will
notice
a
speeder
bike
a
gun
turret
and
some
clones
looking
good
so
far
lets
have
a
look
at
the
turret
an
excellent
star
wars
element
to
have
around
especially
for
mocing
it
is
very
cleverly
built
using
a
tire
guard
from
city
sets
for
the
general
shape
of
the
turret
mount
all
you
have
to
do
is
attach
the
new
mold
explained
later
gun
to
the
2x1
plate
with
the
center
stud
and
presto
i
wonder
how
the
clones
build
these
turrets
to
fast
in
the
middle
of
battle
a
rear
view
with
a
clone
mounted
my
only
gripe
about
the
turret
is
that
you
have
to
take
off
the
gun
in
order
for
every
clone
to
have
a
gun
now
we
move
on
to
the
vehicle
of
the
set
the
speeder
bike
a
rather
sleek
and
good
looking
bike
with
some
useful
pieces
on
it
as
well
such
as
the
blue
cones
the
megaphones
and
the
engines
some
say
it
looks
bare
without
the
figs
mounted
on
it
but
i
think
it
looks
just
fine
the
commander
drives
while
a
trooper
shoots
on
the
back
a
side
view
and
a
rear
view
my
only
gripe
is
the
same
as
the
turret
you
have
to
remove
the
back
gun
for
all
the
clones
to
have
weapons
while
on
foot
the
back
pistol
attaches
to
a
2x2
round
studded
plate
with
a
technic
hole
in
the
middle
finnaly
here
are
the
new
guns
this
set
comes
with
1
new
blaster
rifle
and
three
new
pistols
it
could
have
included
one
more
rifle
for
the
turret
and
of
course
the
figs
includes
1
yellow
commander
lovely
fig
1
shocktrooper
comes
with
a
pair
of
elctrobinouculars
and
two
regular
troopers
so
clean
and
white
the
figs
are
excellent
all
that
any
sw
or
lego
fan
should
want
it
could
have
maybe
included
one
more
regular
trooper
but
that
might
be
pushing
it
thats
all
for
now
folks
here
is
the
final
verdict
build
810
extremely
easy
should
take
the
seasoned
builder
about
5
minutes
to
complete
a
fun
build
though
playability
510
i
guess
you
can
get
this
with
the
droid
battle
pack
and
make
them
battle
but
this
set
has
no
real
play
features
of
its
own
but
it
is
good
for
collecting
troops
and
using
them
for
mocs
swooshability
910
i
guess
you
can
zoom
the
speeder
bike
around
minifigs
1010
four
great
figs
that
should
be
bought
in
multiples
a
great
army
builder
design
1010
a
clever
turret
an
awesome
speeder
and
four
great
clones
what
more
do
you
need
in
a
10
dollar
set
price
810
not
bad
i
suppose
but
if
you
calculate
a
dime
for
each
piece
this
set
should
come
out
to
56
dollars
but
still
billions
of
these
are
being
sold
worldwide
and
tlg
is
making
a
ton
of
money
off
of
them
overall
score
9510
a
truly
memorable
set
one
that
will
be
a
favorite
for
ages
to
come
and
very
popular
a
great
army
builder
for
a
small
price
plus
vehicle
and
turret
with
only
a
few
very
minor
flaws
this
set
is
one
of
the
best
of
star
wars
and
this
concludes
my
review
and
as
always
comments
are
most
welcome
when
i
saw
this
topic
i
was
like

god

set
is

since
2007
this
guy
is
so
late
but
i
read
your
review
and
this
idea
got
out
of
my
mind
thank
you
jim
i
have
2
of
these
and
i
even
have
twice
more
droids
than
clones
i
should
have
buy
more
but
its
sold
out
now
thanks
for
the
review
very
much
jim
sooner
or
later
ill
have
six

believe

another
set
that
has
star
corps
trooper
with
an
orange
pauldron
is

any
better
great
review
but
for
the

like
the
color
combination
of

great
review
of
a
lovely
set
thank
you
sadly
i
dont
see
my
6641
really
often
because
it
is
kind
of
in
the
back
of
my
shelf
but
i
might
get
it
and
swoosh
it
a
few
times
imho
i
think
6675
is
a
little
bit
more
aggressive

more

i

oh
well
gratz
on

one
of

im
looking

to
seeing

soon
do
the

just
dont

this
one
i
was
hoping
the

guards
would
be
what
they
looked
like
in

ohwell
one
more
set
i
dont
have
to
get
the
base
of
the
propeller
it
wobbles
a
bit
but
doesnt
fall
off
very
sturdy
right
side
of
the
rear
propeller
and
the
left
and
better
side
the
tail
it
uses
construction
similar
to
the
xwings
nose
but
on
a
larger
scale
definitely
cool
a
very
neat
part
of
the
copter
the
guns
are
constructed
so
that
they
turn
without
turning
the
cockpit
the
interior
is
rather
blase
though
as
unexpected
as
it
was
this
was
very
helpful
three
questions
though
1
is
the
front
green
rubber
missle
a
traditional
launchable
missle
or
does
it
have
another
firing
mechanism
2
concerning
the
guns
on
the
side
are
they
fixed
in
one
postition
or
does
it
have
any
functions
3
why
did
you
decide
to
buy
this
set
just
curious
i
really

sorry
for
the
double
post
but
i
just
had
another
question
in
mind
how
longhighwide
is
this
badass
copter
including
rotors
have
have
heard
of
as
long
as
25
inches
for
the
length
but
is
this
true
or
is
it
just
an
exaggeration
25
long
and
the
rotors
are
10
long
each
making
it
20
wide
hope
that
helps
i
love
this
set
and
i
wish
i
thought
of
the
bridge
piece
idea
the
only
part
i
dont
like
is
the
lift

excellent
review
metalandi
its
always
great
to
see
early
pictures
of
new
sets
this
set
really
reminds
me
of
an
oil
rig
and
could
probably
be
easily
modified
as
one
if
one
wanted
an
alternate
model
the
two
components
that
i
like
most
are
the
boat
crane
and
the
control
room
but
other
sections
are
pretty
slick
as
well
are
those
printed
pieces
in
the
control
room
or
stickers
im
really
starting
to
gain
an
appreciation
for
these
new
coast
guard
sets
theyve
come
a
long
way
over
the
years

i
picked

a

weeks

but
havent
opened
it
yet
in
any
case
thanks
for
taking
the
time
to
review
this
set
and
share
it
over
eb
first
thanks
to
all
your
great
response
for
my
review
im
glad
you
like
this
set
aswell
as
it
comes
to
stickers
the
tiles
ant
slopes
in
the
control
room
are
printed
pieces
the
rest
as
coast
guard
logo
patterns
and
so
on
are
stickers
i
forgot
to
make
a
photo
of
the
sticker
sheet
unfortunately
is
there
any
way
to
order
one
of
these
if
you
dont
live
in
france
or
one
of
the
countries
where
sh
sells
it
i
dont
know
really
in
which
country
do
you
live
i
havent
been
to
my
local
stores
for
a
while
now
so
i
dont
know
if
they
have
it
there
but
maybe
ill
find
some
time
tomorrow

the
awesome
review

your
pics
are
very

you
go
into
detail
about
all
the
functions
of
the
set
i
agree
this
is
a
great
set
one
of
the
best
of
the
cg
line
for
sure
way
better
than
the
boat
set
with
the
tower
on
the
bionicle
baseplate
and
cheaper
too
i
even
like
the
helicopter
better
than
the
oversized
version
lots
of
great
parts
and
a
really
nice
build
by
the
looks
of
it
too
i
cant
wait
for
this
to
be
released
in
oz
yea
great
review
metalandi
but
i
fail
too
see
how
this
will
be
in
my
budget
as
well
as
most
of
the
agents
sets
atte
rgs
v19
i
also
agree
with
svelte
i
like
this
little
chopper
better
then
the
big
one
and
it
actualy
has
a
place
to
stay
instead
of
the
big
one
theres
no
landing
pad
for
the
big
one

can
you

if
so
ill
get
my

to
buy
me
one
when
she
visits
the

down
under
next

well
some
sets
this
cg
platform
is
one
of
them
a
store
exclusive
to
toys

and
all
other
lego
can
be
found
in
shops
like
target

kmart
myer

david

then
there
is
toys
r
us
of
course
but
they
are
usualy
abit
more
expensive
then
other
retailers
but
they
usualy
have
the
exclusive
sets
like
this
one
and
its
funny
you
are
from
japan
because
iam
going
there
in
september
with
my
dad
hes
a
missionary
and
i
was
wondering
where
i
can
find
lego
in
japan
since
i
have
not
been
to
japan
since
2001
and
i
was
not
into
lego
much
then
im
sure
you
guys
have
a
toys
r
us
right
paramedic
unit
set
6364
year
released
1980
piece
count
140
minifigs
2
list
price
unknown
well
let
me
first
say
that
the
english
name
paramedic
unit
is
not
really
a
good
name
for
this
set
the
function
of
a
paramedic
is
to
take
a
patient
from
an
emergent
situation
and
deliver
them
to
a
hospital
for
treatment
generally
an
emergency
room
this
is
a
rather
small
clinic
that
i
would
imagine
is
more
for
family
care
than
an
emergency
room
in
addition
the
car
looks
more
like
a
doctornurses
car
rather
than
an
ambulance
or
emergency
response
vehicle
i
would
call
this
a
clinic
rather
than
a
paramedic
unit
in
any
case
its
a
great
set
esp
for
table
towns
that
need
medical
services
what
i
like
is
that
this
set
is
small
enough
to
place
anywhere
in
your
lego
city
or
town
starting
with
the
instructions
like
all
the
classic
town
sets
alternate
models
are
pictured
although
i
never
tried
building
one
i
like
the
little
medical
busvan
the
set
includes
two
minifigs
that
include
a
female
doctore
or
nurse
and
what
i
presume
is
a
patient
based
on
the
torsos
i
really
like
the
vehicle
its
a
4stud
wide
two
seater
the
colors
work
well
and
i
like
the
use
of
the
white
bar
between
the
seats
and
the
1x1
blue
plates
for
lights
unfortunately
the
emblems
are
stickers
heres
a
shot
of
the
neat
little
clinic
i
like
the
use
of
the
blinds
for
the
exam
room
it
shows
that
lego
considered
patient
privacy
when
making
this
set
the
interior
includes
an
exam
room
desk
and
two
blue
swivel
chairs
and
a
neat
little
eye
chart
although
the
letters
l
e
g
o
would
have
made
a
nice
touch
lastly
a
picture
of
the
complete
set
i
must
admit
that
i
remember
buying
this
set
back
in
the
80s
and
i
regreted
it
after
taking
it
home
im
not
sure
what
i
didnt
like
about
it
perhaps
the
girl
back
then
but
now
i
really
think
its
a
neat
set
well
theres
a
line
of
patients
waiting
to
have
their
eyes
checked
comments
welcome
thanks
a
lot
for
the
review
brickster
i
never
had
the
chance
to
get
some
classic
town
sets
but
i
wish
i
couldve
i
just
wonder
why
lego
cant
release
sets
like
this
anymore
paramedic
unit
does
not
seem
to
suit
well
for
this
sets
name
it
should
be
named
as
clinic
outpatient
treatment
family
doctor
and
etc
from
what
i
understand
parmedic
unit
is
a
standalone
unit
that
is
on
standby
247
ready
for
any
emergency
rescue
in
lego
town
ambulance
with
a
group
of
paramedics
will
be
ideal
for
this
kind
of
situation
i
love
female
doctors
especially
with
that
lovely
hairpiece
the
cruiser
is
a
neat
4studs
wide
design
just
love
these
small
car
designs
back
then
i
wonder
what
can
be
used
at
the
back
of
its
boot
the
clinic
is
neat
maybe
we
can
send
holodoc
for
some
medical
audit
to
make
sure
that
this
clinic
is
up
to
standard
what
surprised
me
the
most
is
the
neat
little
eye
chart
you
dont
see
such
details
in
any
regular
lego
set
the
red
and
white
color
combination
for
the
building
works
well
for
me
most
of
the
hospital
buildings
and
vehicles
always
revolved
in
red
and
white
i
gave
this
a
4
thanks
you
so
much
brickster
i
just
cant
believe
someone
would
rate
this
set
a
1
it
appears
to
be
a
trend
among
these
classic
reviews
never
with
a
comment
of
why
grevious
on

am
said
wasnt
this
the
first
hospital
with
modern
minifigs
because
i
seem
to
remember
seeing
an
even
older
hospital
online
that
had
the
armless
faceless
figs
youre
correct
this
was
the
first
hospital
555
thank
you
for
all
these
reviews
thebrickster
and
the
idea
with
the
polls
is
a
very
nice
and
interesting
idea
it
will
only
take
a
while
until
i
will
have
commented
on
all
so
please
give
me
some
time
i
gave
this
set
a
four
the
vehicle
the
minfigs
and
the
design
of
the
house
are
excellent
only
the
interior
could
be
a
bit
spiced
up
telephone
some
other
equipment

paramedic
unit
does
not
seem
to
suit
well
for
this

name
it
should
be
named
as
clinic
outpatient
treatment
family
doctor
and
etc
the
definition
of
a
paramedic
is
someone
who
assists
physicians
in
providing
medical
care
i
think
in

a
paramedic
is
generally
thought

as
a

the

i

building
this

good
set
ill
give

a

another
great
review
whitefang
this
is
a
wonderful
80s
vehicle
and
i
think
it
might
be
one
of
the
first
if
not
the
first
that
had
the
spring
suspension
system
i
know
of
at
least
one
other
set
that
had
that
the
biggest
extreme
team
set
from
1998
had
a
vehicle
with
those
pieces
quote
this
tow
truck
is
pretty
useful
as
you
can
see
current
city
sets
hardly
have
any
tow
trucks
available
to
tow
new
cars
design
this
tow
truck
is
catered
for
4studs
vehicles
for
classic
town
can
you
imagine
yourself
this
truck
towing
a
speed
racer
car
i
think
it
looks
really
out
of
proportion
firstly
speed
racer
cars
are
out
of
scale
even
with
city
vehicles
also
i
have
hope
that
in
the
next
few
years
we
will
get
more
octan
sets
to
go
with
the
wonderful
gas
station
and
i
suspect
that
a
6wide
tow
truck
will
be
at
the
top
of
the
list
it
wouldnt
be
a
hard
set
to
make
and
i
bet
it
would
sell
well

i
am
sooooo

but
these

are
in
pretty
bad
shape
esp
those
on

the

i
much
prefer
the

of

which
had
the
full
awning
over
the
roadway
and
the
special
road
plate
with
the
extra
lane
to
pull
into
to
fill

up
i
have
another
gas
station
but
i
think
its
an
octan
thanks
for
the
fantastic
review
of
the
esso
petrol
station
i
like
this
set
a
nice
contrast
to
the
shell
ones
it
adds
a
bit
of
variety
to
a
lego
town
the
cowboy
hat
is
a
nice
addition
too
again
great
topicpoll
thebrickster
i
gave
this
set
a
3
which
is
on
the
one
hand
negative
is
that
its
really
oldfashioned
for
today
which
is
on
the
other
hand
positive
is
that
it
includes
very
nice
and
authentic
details
like
e
g
doors
in
the
cars
which
is
imo
for
that
time
a
feat
klausdieter
cant
wait
vbbn
i
probably
wont
buy
it
but
itll
be
nice
to
see
a
review
well
the

set
was
matched
with
an

this

the

of

second

man
this
baby
is
flawless
there
are
so
many
indications
that
the
designers
took
care
in
designing
this
kit
like
the
space
for
the
pilots
backpack
the
compartment
for
the
mini

the
sturdy

design
etc
etc
etc
kudos
to
tlc
for
making

go
out
with

have
high

that

i

want
this

but
i

so
it

see
a

anyway
i
dont
normally
like
it
when
people
make
a
topic
to
say
theyll
review
a
set
soon
but
ill
let
you
off
since
this
is
one
of
the
few
mars
mission
sets
i
really
like
and
im
glad
to
know
somebody
has
the
set
and
will
be
reviewing
it
peace
i
feel
the
same
way
we
have
been
considering
closing
topics
like
this
in
vbbns
defense
he
was
fast
excellent
review
its
a
great
set
i
really
love
the
look
of
the
little
ship
would
it
be
possible
to
get
some
walking
pictures
of
the
walker
wooha
i
thought
i
never
would
see
a
nice
mars
mission
set
but
this
walker
ist
the
best
proof
i
was
wrong
it
really
looks
good
and
i
love
the
bricks
used
to
make
the
shape
the
airtank
is
cool
and
for
once
i
have
to
say
even
the
stickers
are
looking
good
man
did
i
really
say
that
normally
i
hate
stickers
nice
review
some
pictures
would
have
gotten
better
with
macro
on
but
as
it
seems
to
be
time
to
forgive
i
won
´
t
point
on
that
any
longer
thank
you
very
much
vbbn
nice
review
i
dont
mind
the
set
but
at
the
same
time
im
not
particularly
fond
of
it
sweet
review
metalandi
this
set
always
looked
a
bit
too
busy
for
my
liking
i
guess
i
just
didnt
expect
to
see
a
set
so
tall
after
seeing
your
review
though
it
is
growing
on
me
i
like
all
the
play
features
and
at
the
very
least
its
a
great
parts
pack
two
things
im
confused
about
though
in
this
pic
is
that
dragon
being
used
as
a
swing
set
and
i
dont
get
why
the
area
where
the
witch
casts
her
spells
on
the
second
floor
is
green
green
in
castle
means
grass
or
forestmen
and
having
grass
on
the
second
floor
of
a
building
is
just
weird
i
understand
that
its
modular
and
thus
it
would
make
sense
if
it
were
placed
on
the
ground
but
dark
grey
would
make
just
as
much
sense
and
would
look
much
better
than
the
green
there
imo
anyway
im
just
fussy
thanks
again
for
the
cool
review
will
we
be
seeing
any
more
peace
i
love
the
reviews
of
older
sets
that
i
never
had
also
tiny
thing
but
you
said
it
has
7
minifigs
but
the
group
shots
only
include
6
the
last
guy
isnt
shown
until
the
very
end
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
your
review
metalandi
thank
you
especially
for
taking
photos
of
all
the
contraptions
and
detailing
exactly
how
they
work
as
a
member
of
classiccastle
the
census
always
seemed
to
be
that
fright
knights
were
a
class
410
or
610
but
as
sandy
stated
above
it
is
one
of
the
closest
you
can
get
to
an
evil
faction
by
todays
standards
the
contraptions
seen
here
are
much
much
more
sophisticated
and
well
thought
out
and
are
definitely
missing
in
2007s
kings
castle
siege
i
enjoy
the
design
of
this
castle
much
more
even
if
the
towers
are
taller
simply
because
the
design
in
the
kings
castle
siege
left
builders
with
an
empty
space
right
in
the
courtyard
without
even
a
base
plate
and
its
nearly
impossible
to
get
your
hands
in
and
play
in
the
enclosed
space
why
would
anyone
unless
youre
simply
posing
figs
and
even
that
was
difficult
this
castle
instead
had
a
variety
of
trap
doors
and
surprises
so
despite
the
varied
colors
used
here
its
not
that
hard
to
realize
that
the
designers
for
this
castle
really
took
time
to
think
things
out
and
tried
to
make
the
castle
enjoyable
for
the
children
that
will
play
with
it
whereas
our
2007
castle
was
strictly
built
to
give
kids
the
impression
of
an
enormous
magnificant
castle
with
little
to
nothing
inside
its
like
comparing
beauty
2007
to
brains
this
castle

am
very
nice
of
a
very
nice

the
revolving
fireplace
i
wonder
what
movie
that
could
possibly
be
from
i
read
this
review
not
long
after
you
posted
it
but
im
not
sure
why
i
didnt
comment
if
dragonator
is
the
one
to
post
everytime
he
sees
a
dragon
related
topic
i
would
be
the
one
to
post
if
i
see
a
fright
knights
topic
fright
knights
is
one
of
my
favourite
lego
themes
and
this
review
is
really
good
i
got
both
of
the
castles
in
the
theme
and
loved
them
and
your
review
presents
basil
the
batlords
castle
well
i
too
thought
it
was
a
bit
weird
that
there
is
a
green
base
when
it
could
be
grey
but
i
guess
its
a
useful
piece
to
use
in
other
things
fright
knights
on
my
first
post
in
this
topic
looks
foolish
now
that
i
bought
this
set
from
ebay
i
just
really
wanted
the
minifigs
although
i
already
had
the
batlord
and
the
black
dragon
and
the
parts
they
will
help
me
greatly
in
building
the
impenetrable
fortress
of
the
dragonwarriors
for
my
princess
quest
comic
by
the
end
of
this
week
this
set
will
be
in
my
clutches
well
that
the
bricks
look
new
comes
from
that
they
are
new
i
got
this
set
new
and
unopened
great
review
again
its
nice
to
see
old
sets
reviewed
i
love
the
control
stickers
theres
a
great
level
of
detail
this
is
really
the
second
best
fire
station
in
my
opinion
lovely
i
cant
stop
making
comparisons
between
this
fire
station
and
last
years
which
is
also
very
well
detailed
with
great
features
and
awesome
playability
the
concept
design
of
the
second
one
its
very
much
like
the
one
reviewed
here
this
is
good
as
tlg
is
taking
back
those
great
values
to
make
the
new
excellent
sets
we
all
are
enjoying
by
now
i
must
agree
great
fire
station
i
love
the
fact
that
in
the
classic
sets
you
were
given
a
base
plate
and
some
other
great
ideas
i
do
miss
the
addition
of
base
plates
and
alternate
building
ideas
the
only
newer
set
i
have
seen
with
any
alternate
build
photos
is
the
7239
fire
engine
i
miss
back
when
great
review
of
a
great
set
sadly
i
dont
own
it
as
for
the
alternate
building
ideas
on
the
back
of

box
yes
i
miss
that
as
well
i
really
miss
it

thank
you
so
much
for
all
these
reviews

this

was
released
in

and
i
was
born
1
year
earlier
hehe
nice
little
heli
i
vote
outstanding
because
it
makes
excellent
use
of
the
pieces
that
were
available
at
the
time
that
cockpit
makes
excellent
use
of
an
inverted
windshield
i
owned
this
set
and
i
loved
it
great
idea
to
have
the
reversed
windshield
thanks
for
another
great
review
i
can
remember
the
6358
very
vividly
my
parents
bought
the
6340
for
me
and
a
girl
friend
got
the
6358
im
quiet
sure
its
my
envy
because
until
now
i
want
to
believe
that
the
6340
is
better
my
reasons
were
these
i
own
the
6340
and
on
the
instructions
of
the
6358
stood
legoland
which
i
thought
of
as
old
but
this
review
induced
me
to
get
over
this

from

a
truly
great

i
always
loved
the
mobile
crane
and
was
gobsmacked
when
this
popped
up
using
some
of
the
great
features
from
the
crane
but
also
making
it
an
emergency
vehicle
too
great
classic
firemen
and
in
your
version
a
suspiciously
blue
fire
extinguisher
great
review
of
a
great
set
just
a
pity
i
no
longer
have
it
so
many
sets
i
used
to
have
got
lost
during
the
period
at
the
end
of
my
childhood
before
i
rescued
what
was
left
from
my
dads
house
once
i
realised
what
i
had
left
behind

is
a
great
thing
cheers

guys
thanks
for

this
was

set
in
the
late

and
i
am
glad
to
restore
it
somehow
with
a

little
part
missing
which
could

cant
help
but
feel
thought
that
these
reviews
are
being
churned
out
to
quickly
you
should
leave
a
gap
i
am
being
flooded
with
all
these
great
reviews
you
should
really
take
some
time
off
and
sit
in
front
of
the
town
and
trains
forum
looking
through
at
your
childhood
memories
where
classic
reviews
like
this
are
released
in
this
forum
i
am
leaving
some
gaps
in
between
my
reviews
now
i
supposed
brickster
will
slow
down
soon

said
this
definitly
is
a
nice
set
i
think
this
was
also
the
first
set
to
use
that
white
basket
cgh
you
are
absolutely
right
this
is
the
first
set
that
made
use
of
the
white
basket
component
in
fact
there
is
only
2
sets
in
the
entire
lego
theme
which
have
make
used
of
the
white
basket
it
is
the
6477
which
is
released
in
2000
i
am
quite
surprised
after
13
years
they
are
able
to
produced
it
again

said
what
an
awesome
little
set
i
really
like
this
engine
but
dont
remember
seeing
it
during
the
late
80s
it
must
have
been
out
during
my
dark
ages
i
love
the
basketsection
for
the
firemen
equally
nice
is
the
fire
hose
which
extends
a
good
length
the
color
combination
of
red
with
white
and
the
trans
blue
windshield
looks
goos
as
well
this
is
a
great
engine
and
one
that
would
look
perfect
in
a
classic
tabletown
and
its
4studs
wide
very
nice
review
whitefang
i
look
forward
to
seeing
more
of
your
classic
town
reviews
you
shared
the
same
sentiments
as
i
do
its
a
pity
that
set
was
released
during
the
dark
age
of
yours
on
the
other
hand
these
sets
are
my
childhood
sets
which
i
grew
up
with
more
classic
town
reviews
all
the
way
edit
this
is
my
1000th
eurobricks
post
since
i
joined
it
has
been
another
great
milestone
for
me

am
great
set
i
found
only
one
major
fail
this
the
hands
of
robot
arms
gets
easly
broken
thanks
for
the
review
this
set
was
outstanding
for
its
time
with
all
the
features
and
detail
the
extending
basket
is
just
wonderful
however
i
honestly
wouldnt
consider
it
the
best
firetruck
ever
i
actually
like
the
one
from
2005
even
better
becasue
like
most
of
the
city
vehicles
it
adds
the
needed
bulk
big
engines
like
fire
trucks
need
many
of
the
older
kits
while
awesome
were
honestly
a
little
too
skinny

for

we
now
the
use

laatc
yeah
when
i
built
it
i
wondered
for
a
long

i
considered
many
possiblities
temporarily
like
either

hey
everyone
i
just
got
the
rgs
yesterday
at
tru
after
i
came
home
from
camp
i
saw
all
of
the
topics
that
i
missed
and
noticed
a
minireview
and
a
review
with
one
pic
so
i
thought
id
make
a
huge
shiny
new
review
that
has
lots
of
pictures
and
all
of
the
requirements
of
kimts
index
note
i
did
not
apply
any
stickers
to
it
as
a
personal
liking
so
lets
start
by
looking
at
the
box
a
shiny
clean
and
futuristic
box
quite
different
from
the
other
star
wars
box
designs
before
this
there
was
so
much
clone
wars
merchandise
with
this
font
and
design
in
the
huge
display
at
the
front
of
my
local
toys
r
us
store
and
not
just
lego
it
so
beautiful
with
the
white
and
sky
blue
anyways
for
some
reason
the
boxes
of
the
new
clone
wars
sets
seemed
more
shiny
than
usual
maybe
its
because
they
were
just
shipped
but
once
you
pick
up
the
boxes
they
will
feel
really
good
in
your
hands
despite
the
fact
that
only
about
half
of
the
space
in
the
boxes
are
used
the
back
of
the
box
the
back
shows
all
of
the
main
features
of
the
set
plus
pictures
of
the
three
other
clone
wars
sets
meant
to
be
released
alongside
this
one
although
i
did
spot
the
twilight
and
homing
spider
droid
which
were
supposed
to
be
released
in
september
or
october
so
on
to
the
gunship
built
straight
from
the
bags
it
took
me
about
4
12
hours
with
breaks
it
has
an
overall
great
design
but
somewhat
fragile
especially
when
building
it
the
cockpits
always
fall
apart
when
opened
as
well
as
the
bubbles
on
the
wings
which
i
will
get
into
more
later
the
color
scheme
is
very
well
done
you
can
always
find
the
piece
youre
looking
for
thanks
to
the
color
diversity
red
dark
red
lime
green
ooh
blue
black
tan
light
bley
dark
grey
yellow
and
white
also
split
down
the
middle
vertically
the
ship
is
almost
all
symmetrical
front
side
now
lets
start
with
the
many
features
that
this
set
is
hiding
the
front
has
lots
of
lime
green
a
rare
color
but
more
importantly
a
rotating
gun
is
found
on
each
side
they
rotate
in
a
pretty
wide
range
although
fragile
cockpits
there
are
two
main
cockpits
right
next
to
each
other
not
very
detailed
and
are
the
same
and
for
some
reason
the
whole
cockpit
element
flips
up
to
reveal
nothing
just
the
skeleton
of
the
ship
probe
droid
storage
above
the
cockpit
lies
a
plate
that
can
be
flipped
up
to
reveal
a
storage
area
that
holds
two
of
these
probe
droids
at
least
thats
what
i
think
they
are
hull
in
this
pic
two
features
are
hidden
mobile
command
center
the
first
of
the
two
is
a
mobile
command
center
but
essentially
just
a
hover
chair
it
is
found
by
flipping
up
the
two
panels
on
either
side
of
the
hull
bacta
tank
the
second
is
the
bacta
tank
found
by
just
sliding
it
out
of
the
storage
area
behind
the
mcc
one
half
of
the
tank
opens
so
a
minifigure
can
go
inside
and
heal
hisher
wounds
obtained
in
battle
cargo
hold
now
this
is
probably
the
main
feature
for
this
set
the
two
sliding
doors
two
on
each
side
slide
open
thanks
to
a
clever
technic
mechanism
not
much
in
here
just
a
gun
holder
and
a
place
where
the
passengers
wait
to
be
dropped
off
in
battle
speeder
bike
i
guess
you
guys
saw
it
the
speeder
bike
it
is
found
by
opening
the
rear
flap
the
bike
is
very
cleverly
designed
by
using
a
brown
trike
body
its
only
a
few
centimeters
shorter
than
the
bike
found
in
the
clone
battle
pack
rear
gun
just
a
gun
similar
to
the
front
ones
engines
huge
engines
or
are
they
cannons
that
are
really
fun
to
build
they
really
give
that
cartoon
feel
to
this
set
missiles
in
between
the
engines
are
two
sets
of
four
flickfire
missiles
bubble
cockpits
there
is
one
bubble
cockpit
on
each
wing
that
supposedly
control
the
turrets
at
the
front
very
fragile
storage
containers
two
storage
containers
on
each
side
hold
the
clone
accessories
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
putting
them
in
there
because
the
antennae
can
fall
out
or
you
might
forget
about
them
sticker
sheet
the
dreaded
sticker
sheet
dss
has
all
of
the
stickers
you
need
for
this
set
unfortunately
mine
was
crunched
up
i
dont
like
stickers
much
anyways
but
i
might
still
apply
some
note
the
republic
symbol
stickers
why
couldnt
tlg
just
use
that
printed
piece
from
a
few
years
back
also
you
get
to
choose
between
a
birdrat
thing
or
a
sleeping
twielk
as
your
hull
decal
what
theyre
for
i
dont
know
looks
like
the
movie
or
show
will
explain
it
though
minifigs
finally
the
five
minifigs
of
this
set
they
are
all
great
figs
including
commander
cody
amazing
especially
with
the
gear
the
orange
is
nice
but
i
thought
he
was
yellow
clone
trooper
again
amazing
the
gear
is
great
and
the
new
helmet
and
torso
are
great
all
of
the
clones
in
the
clone
wars
line
have
the
same
heads
also
you
can
see
the
flesh
beneath
the
helmet
asaaj
ventress
not
so
happy
about
this
one
the
torso
and
dark
blue
legs
are
cool
but
the
dress
is
pretty
ugly
the
head
is
alright
but
could
do
without
the
cartoony
face
yeah
i
know
its
from
a
cartoon
also
has
purple
markings
on
back
of
head
obiwan
kenobi
pretty
cool
besides
the
face
cool
hair
and
torso
though
plo
koon
beautiful
the
true
gem
of
this
set
in
my
opinion
the
head
is
the
same
material
as
kit
fistos
and
the
tosro
is
awesome
good
for
making
a
custom
kiadi
mundi
well
thats
about
it
here
is
the
final
verdict
build
810
very
fun
and
easy
should
take
the
seasoned
builder
about
4
hours
somewhat
fragile
playability
9510
lots
of
fun
features
although
some
can
break
easily
swooshability
310
i
wouldnt
recommend
flying
it
around
much
as
you
can
barely
pick
it
up
safely
but
with
two
hands
gripping
the
bottom
firmly
it
can
be
moved
around
but
not
spun
or
swooshed
etc
minifigs
810
all
very
great
figs
especially
plo
koon
but
could
have
included
more
clone
troopers
design
7510
some
excellent
ideas
included
in
here
although
some
spots
are
very
fragile
price
710
should
have
been
only
100
usd
if
not
for
the
new
molds
plus
at
tru
it
was
130
usd
overall
score
8510
a
great
set
to
have
for
your
star
wars
clone
wars
collection
with
some
flaws
save
up
for
this
one
so
how
did
you
like
my
review
your
feedback
is
much
appreciated

thanks
lots
of
useful
information
about
this
very
cool

very
good
review
i
just
checked
my
ep
ii
vehicle
encyclopedia
yes
im
a
total
sw
geek
and
tlg
got
it
pretty
accurately
with
the
rgs
whats
this
thing
on
the
clone
at
right
jimbutcher
finally
i
had
seen
something
that
is
worth
reading
and
viewing
imho
this
is
your
best
star
wars
review
i
had
ever
read
most
importantly
it
is
a
complete
review
which
has
substance
you
have
my
thanks
keep
up
the
good
job
back
to
the
rgs
this
is
the
next
star
wars
set
i
will
be
getting
i
cant
wait
to
lay
my
hands
on
this
set
and
start
building
basically
how
bad
this
set
can
be
it
cant
be
worse
republic
gunship
is
one
of
the
alltime
favourites
in
star
wars
prequel
and
ot
i
cant
find
any
faults
except
being
too
expensive
due
to
the
licence
cost
in
addition
the
minifigs
are
the
next
big
thing
seriously
i
am
quite
impressed
with
it
on
the
down
side
my
rating
will
go
up
if
there
is
an
additional
clone
trooper
instead
of
one
nevertheless
this
is
a
must
get
set
no
matter
what
i
got
this
set
in
the
spring
during
my
buy
every
new
castle
set
availableseason
granted
i
couldnt
afford
all
of
them
but
i
do
have
most
of
them
now
anyway
i
love
the
action
elements
to
this
set
and
the
siege
tower
really
does
look
wicked
id
like
to
attach
the
crownie
tower
to
the
kings
castle
to
see
how
it
fits
but
i
unfortunately
dont
own
that
set
yet
i
also
love
the
turning
head
of
the
soldier
and
ive
used
it
in
my
princess
questcomic
as
well
along
with
the
turning
head
of
the
princess
the
troll
leader
brings
good
variety
to
the
army
of
trolls
but
they
still
could
use
another
face
type
and
more
torso
options
its
a
nice
review
in
any
case
although
the
set
pretty
much
speaks
for
itself
hey
good
review
and
good
photos
i
also
got
this
set
just
recently
and
i
wasnt
very
enthusiastic
about
it
at
the
beginning
but
after
i
built
it
i
could
appreciate
it
the
siege
engine
is
very
nice
but
my
complaint
has
do
with
the
proportions
of
the
knights
tower
in
respect
to
the
trolls
machine
its
a
bit
smaller
and
less
bulkier
that
complaint
has
to
go
with
some
other
sets
too
for
example
the
troll
warship
is
really
humongous
it
feels
like
it
can
load
the
evil
wizards
tower
and
sail
off
other
than
that
a
good
set
i
like
it

from
me
thanks
for
the
positive
comments
everyone
i
'd
noticed
that
although
much
discussed
noone
on
eurobricks
had
written
a
comprehensive
review
for
it
i
thought
this
set
more
than
deserved
one
i
've
just
posted
my
newest
review
of
the
dwarves

here
httpwwweurobrickshowtopic19931
when
i
first
saw
this
topic
i
thought
oh
great
another
review
of
this
set
however
im
glad
you
posted
it
now
your
pics
are
great
and
well
it
was
just
a
generally
good
review
im
looking
forward
to
seeing
more
peace
pedro
for
your
first
review
you
have
amaze
me
with
your
photo
session
and
the
strucutre
of
your
review
i
am
very
impressed
by
your
high
quality
pictures
you
have
done
an
excellent
job
i
love
the
tower
raid
very
much
as
it
offers
high
playability
with
the
wall
and
flooring
falling
down
when
the
ram
hits
the
wall
its
quite
interesting
to
play
with
the
mechanism
of
the
ram
is
very
fun
to
play
with
as
well
i
will
try
and
pull
back
and
released
it
to
knock
a
row
of
soldiers

my
apologies
for
the
blurry

grainy

my

is
acting
up
the
build
is
nothing
speicial
on
to
the
figs
indiana
jones
mutt
williams
and
irina
spalkoi
nice
array
of
minifigs
although
i
think
they
should
have
included
a
russian
soldier
or
two
if
you
look
to
the
right
on
mutts
jacket
it
has
his
name
in
script
the
tent
is
great
aside
from
the
fact
that
the
fabric
bends
easily
a
nice
amount
of
speicial
pieces
the
weapons
rack
is
pretty
nifty
so
is
the
table
when
you
swap
the
white
piece
with
a
black
one
overall
it
is
a
very
nice
set
the
1000
price
tag
isnt
so
bad
either

end
of

and
the
other
in

then
to

all
you
do
is
push
the
original
placed
cone
down
and
put
it

in

build
time
810
i
took
my
time
on
this
and
enjoyed
the
techniques
the
designers
intricated
also
taking
pics
added
to
the
time
quite
a
bit
playability
710
the
main
playability
functions
are
the
missle
launchers
in
the
back
and
the
sliding
cockpit
my
only
gripe
with
these
is
they
dont
set
right
with
the
other
slopes
on
the
top
also
the
inside
of
the
cockpit
is
easily
modded
for
regular
size
minifigs
just
pop
a
handlebar
piece
in
the
already
provided
arm
in
the
cockpit
and
bam
your
favorite
figs
can
have
a
ride
it
also
helps
keep
the
magnaguards
in
place
if
they
hold
it
minifigs
1010
imo
the
new
molds
are
great
the
only
downfall
is
the
right
arm
on
both
is
less
moveable
due
to
the
hard
plastic
turbanthing
connected
to
the
head
swooshability
910
the
starfighter
is
pretty
sleek
and
very
swooshable
design
910
the
most
important
aspect
and
this
ones
a
winner
its
only
a
nine
because
it
needs
to
have
smoother
edges
in
a
few
spots
but
they
are
easily
modable
overall
score
87
i
think
its
an
awesome
set
very
satisfying

in

thank
you
for
the
first

review
of
the
fighter
tank
i
like
this
set
and
every
features
it
offers
but
i
think
that
the
engine
could
have
a
better
look
than
just
four
green
cylinders
in
a
grey
piece
i
am
100
going
to
get
this
set
it
should
be
about
55
and
if
it
is
ill
get
it
without
a
doubt
i
just
hope
that
this
set
is
5060
if
it
isnt
then
we
have
a
problem
thanks
for
posting
the
review
i
've
been
wondering
about
this
set
to
me
it
does
feel
a
bit
fig
light
for
#
50
i
'd
expect
maybe
one
or
two
more
clones
i
'm
not
to
sure
about
the
oversized
issue
it
seems
to
me
it
's
better
to
have
something
a
bit
to
large
and
have
a
better
level
or
features
than
something
smaller
will
less
thanks
for
the
review
i
love
these
affordable
little
sets
not
so
affordable
now
because
of
the
cool
figs
but
im
going
to
have
a
look
on
ebay
and
bricklink
right
now
just
in
case
an
army
of
tan
red
droids
would
look
great
maybe
well
see
some
if
geonosia
appears
in
the
new
seires
somehow
unlikely
since
the
confederacy
was
defeated
at
the
battle
of
geonosis
i
wish
i
could
have
bought
this
set
when
it
came
out
but
id
just
left
university
so
i
was
super
skint
and
had
to
miss
all
the
epii
sets
now
they
all
cost
loads
even
in
used
condition
at
least
now
there
has
been
a
redesign
of
the
gunship
and
atte
from
the
clone
wars
series
that
i
can
buy
vbbn
the
pics
were
12
mega
pixles
which
is
quite
a
lot
i
think
although
i
had
to
scale
them
down
to
800x600
i
used
to
dream
that
tlg
would
bring
out
these
sets
of
the
geonosis
arena
and
you
could
join
them
together
to
make
a
massive
arena
but
i
doubt
they
would
ever
do
that
also
look
out
for
my
forth
coming
reviews
of
4500
snow
speeder
some
tie
fighter
with
a
lul
dv
and
gg
wheel
bike
chase
i
have
taken
all
the
pics
all
i
need
to
do
is
upload
them
also
i
would
review
the
jango
fetts
slave

but
i
have
customized
it
so
much
i
dont
really
want
to
revert
it
back
to
its

any
way
i
had
this

one
of
my

ones
but
i
droped
the
ship
and
it
blew
up
i
found
all

in

i
still

great

adifficult
build
so
why
show
them
still
there
is
an
inventory
list
of
all
bricks
at
the
end
of
the
instructions
note
the
giant
sticker
sheet
we
all
now
the
dss
but
that
is
a
new
kind
of
extra
super
large
sticker
sheet
it
holds
82
stickers
more
to
that
later
on
the
build
is
quite
basic
the
only
nonconventional
parts
of
the
build
were
the
two
slammers
and
the
most
annoying
part
was
fiddling
the
rubber
band
of
the
holder
without
destroying
it
bag
1
easy
beginning
building
the
lime
car
the
limo
and
the
two
slammers
nothing
exciting
about
the
lime
car
but
the
limo
was
neat
it
´
s
an
18
studs
long
car
the
normal
racers
are
abot
10
studs
long
nice
way
to
put
the
horns
on
the
back
the
slammers
mmmmh
nice
invention
if
they
would
actually
do
something
they
are
supposed
to
give
the
tubros
a
kick
in
the
butt
to
speed
them
up
but
the
result
is
a
80
cm
long
run
and
that
´
s
it
i
had
expected
more
acceleration
from
the
slammers
but
it
´
s
also
fun
to
play
with
the
cars
without
slamming
them
bag
2
convoy
time
the
tow
truck
and
the
fuel
truck
the
tow
truck
is
a
great
idea
and
a
good
addition
to
the
set
the
cars
are
supposed
to
crash
how
do
they
get
back
home
well
here
´
s
the
answer
quite
american
layout
of
the
truck
and
it
´
s
very
well
done
horns
5
flashing
lights
and
a
right
color
choice
you
can
move
the
arm
up
and
down
and
pull
out
the
hook
note
the
metallic
silver
antennae
the
fuel
tank
has
got
a
secret
function
it
may
break
on
the
middle
of
the
trailer
therefore
it
has
a
hinge
build
in
the
bottom
city
fire
mayhem
and
there
´
s
no
fire
engine
bag
3
long
longer
how
long
can
a
tiny
truck
be
the
pipe
truck
an
unexpected
buggy
and
the
red
racer
36
studs
long
the
pipe
truck
breaks
every
convention
the
cabin
is
almost
the
same
like
the
tow
truck
and
the
fuel
truck
and
that
is
the
good
part
of
it
the
trailer
has
to
carry
pipes
and
is
functional
as
well
as
it
can
commute
sidewarts
it
looks
quite
unrealistic
as
well
and
you
can
not
drive
this
beast
on
tiny
roads
good
for
another
crash
but
there
are
more
cars
in
this
bag
now
this
was
a
surprise
a
buggy
this
is
the
only
6wide
car
but
just
because
the
wheels
are
large
monster
truck
madness
i
don
´
t
care
for
those
cars
personally
a
disappointment
i
would
have
preferred
another
racer
for
variety
though
did
i
say
another
racer
here
we
are
the
red
devil
great
looking
a
real
fast
shape
and
red
the
best
racer
in
this
set
vrooommm
this
is
the
most
played
with
car
of
the
set
not
only
from
me
as
you
may
have
noticed
i
didn
´
t
put
any
stickers
so
far
i
don
´
t
like
stickers
especially
when
placed
over
two
or
more
bricks
and
here
you
are
supposed
to
do
it
several
times
of
course
the
cars
look
better
with
stickers
on
but
they
are
also
great
without
stickers
only
the
fuel
truck
looks
boring
without
my
sons
didn
´
t
know
there
were
supposed
to
be
stickers
and
they
didn
´
t
ask
for
them
so
everything
is
allright
here
´
s
a
closeup
of
the
sticker
sheet
did
i
already
mention
it
was
82
stickers
the
only
exception
i
made
using
sticker
was
for
bag
4
bag
4
you
go
here
you
pay
the
highway
toll
booth
the
only
immobile
part
of
the
set
but
great
to
brake
though
the
barriers
that
is
fun
i
only
put
on
stickers
on
2x2
plates
where
i
had
the
idea
to
use
those
plates
further
on
on
different
other
mocs
this
looks
a
bit
boring
without
the
other
stickers
i
admit
but
still
no
cut
off
to
the
playability
there
are
also
two
ramps
belonging
to
the
set
these
only
make
sense
if
you
are
able
to
speed
up
the
racers
with
the
slammers
and
hit
the
ramps
correctly
i
had
problems
with
that
so
they
are
on
the
shelves
now
could
be
a
lot
fun
making
a
contest
though
like
this
picture
of
the
inventories
frontpage
all
cars
put
together
the
usual
leftovers
all
in
all
this
is
a
great
set
to
call
ones
own
i
did
not
regret
buying
it
especially
when
it
was
50
off
even
normal
price
would
not
have
been
too
much
build
great
for
smaller
children
boring
to
afols
510
special
brickscolors
none
all
basics
310
design
i
love
the
tiny
turbos
´
size
and
design
910
playability
1
because
of
the
slammers
another
1
because
no
minifigscale
but
that
is
not
the
intention
of
the
set
still
910
pricepiece
ratio
dang
it
´
s
not
on
sale
any
more
but
if
you
hurry
you
could
still
grab
one
in
the
lego
stores
1010
all
in
all
8510
and
a
clear
recommendation
it
was
and
still
is
a
set
to
play
with
your
children
the
size
fits
perfectly
to
matchbox
cars
and
that
was
exactly
what
my
younger
son
did
can
you
find
all
of
the
cars
included
in
the
set
ps
after
buying
this
set
i
won
an
ebay
auction
with
another
tiny
turbos
set
8135
bridge
chase
this
is
even
more
fun
i
will
soon
care
for
a
review
with
some
never
seen
phototricks
as
well
stay
tuned

the
review
i
have
quite
a
few
ttstiny
turbos
i
never
got
this
one
but
if
its
on

my
review
gave
you
motivation
to
build
a
set
my
review
was

podracer
not
sure
where
you
got
that
from
i
didnt
have
them
out
i
noticed
the
minifig
between
the
grievous
starfighter
the
moddino2010
vehicle
and
it
looked
like
a
little
person
sitting
in
the
pod
of
his
podracer
guess
my
eyes
are
playing
tricks
on
me
my
eyesight
is
shot
my
wife
keeps
pushing
me
to
go
visit
the
optometrist
nope
there
is
a
guy
sitting
there
hes
there
because
on
dine
2010
there
were
no
guns
like
on
dino
attack
so
so
i
made
a
big
gun
like
on
the
dino
attack
set
i
can
see
where
you
got
the
pod
racer
idea
from
now
i
find
myself
so
stupid
i
didnt
bought
this
set
it
was
30
euro
and
i
thought
that
it
would
be
for
sale
after
a
half
year
it
was
with
earlier
sw
sets
also
nice
review
i
had
this
set
#
15
rrp
actually
and
agree
mostly
with
your
review
although
on
the
wheel
bike
itself
two
legs
can
be
placed
at
the
front
end
and
two
at
the
back
to
enable
it
to
roll
properly
boga
is
very
juniorised
and
the
set
itself
is
very
simple
and
contains
many
large
pieces
the
minifigures
are
good
though
i
traded
my
gg
however
just
to
offer
my
personal
thoughts
build
510
minifigs
1010
parts
310
price
710
playability
1010
overall
710
not
an
average
tk
i
never
got
the
original
boba
fetts
slave
1
i
wish
they
would
make
one
to
scale
with
the
minifigures
i
would
be
so
cool
i
am
also
putting
up
a
review
of
the
clone
turbo
tank
probably
tomorrow
it
is
a
different
variation
to
the
one
in

personally
i
hated
that
set
i
fell
apart
way
to
easily
and
was
just
not
built
well
very
good
review
i
have
he
newest
slave
i
and
i
like
it
more
than
this
one
dsr
you
added
some
decals
to
the
jango
figure
right
they
seem
to
be
suffering
a
little
i
remember
buying
this
set
from
the
discount
tent
after
my
first
visit
to
legoland
windsor
i
wasnt
sure
whether
to
buy
it
even
in
their
sale
but
i
was
glad
i
did
once
id
built
it
i
really
want
one
of
these
if
only
it
wasnt
expensive
i
probably
wont
buy
it
because
itd
be
scraped
for
parts
too

am
said
i
remember
having
this
set
actually
i
even
still
have
it
at
least
the
pars
are
somewhere
when
i
was
a
child
and
i
used
it
for
making
races
as
it
is
there
for
you
should
look
for
them
and
resurrect
it
it
really
feels
good
after
youve
found
all
the
pieces
and
put
a
set
back
together
again
as
it
was
when
you
first
bought
it
i
can
prodly
say
i
own
this
little
bugger
its
not
much
but
it
is
a
nice
addition
to
the
series
they
are
also
easy
to
build
so
you
can
get
a
rally
going
quite
fast
stauder
i
hate
how
the
original
release
had
the
lightup
windu
which
was
really
lame
and
one
less
clone
trooper
i
bought
it
when
it
first
came
out
so
missed
out
on
a
good
windu
and
another
clone
trooper
did
your
version
without
the
lul
mace
have
trans
blue
grill
things
like
the
ones
on
the
back
of
the
speeder
or
was
my
set
a
one
off
i
got
the
original
version
of
this
set
with
the
luls
mace
windu
figure
when
tlc
released
the
nonluls
version
i
managed
to
swap
they
sent
me
the
new
version
and
a
clone
trooper
iirc
and
i
mailed
them
back
the
old
version
this
was
a
great
set
the
suspension
worked
great
and
it
rolled
magnificently
nice
review
with
good
photos
but
again
your
price
is
a
little
off
#
6999
is
the
rrp
unless
the
price
you
paid
was
#
80
tk
nice
review
again
skipper
i
passed
on
this
one
because
of
the
price
but
its
a
nice
set
good
for
you
for
getting
the
newer
version
with
nonlul
mace
and
an
extra
clone
that
purple
blade
sure
is
a
beauty
the
tank
itself
is
alright
just
an
atat
on
wheels
in
my
opinion
the
turret
is
great
though
and
so
is
the
speeder
bike
i
didnt
realize
that
the
jet
pack
had
two
nailguns
harpoon
guns
on
it
i
thought
that
the
nailgun
was
a
new
piece
but
the
jetpack
is
very
cool
i
wonder
why
this
set
had
no
blue
or
black
astronauts
whatever
the
case
i
always
loved
the
small
minifig
sets
that
lego
released
as
i
could
never
get
enough
astronauts
my
favorite
was
the
set
of
futuron
astronauts
why
would
the
yellow
astronauts
freak
you
out
sinner
is
it
because
they
look
nekkid
pretty
nice
set
but
the
newer
minifig
packs
had
greater
variety
in
both
the
figures
and
equipment
my
favorite
one
among
all
of
them
is
6704
which
is
also
the
only
instance
of
both
blacktrons
appearing
in
one
set

i
wonder
why
this

hadnt
yet

thanks
for

this
just
reaffirms
that
the
v19
is
my
highest
priority
this
fall
behind
the
rgs
of
course
is
that
new
printed
piece
a
2
x
2
tile
it
looks
like
an
excellent
detail
part
for
mocing
those
black
pieces
used
on
the
landing
gear
look
very
bioniclelike
if
they
havent
been
used
before
id
suspect
they
will
be
not
that
im
a
bionicle
expert
or
anything
it
is
a
shame
that
this
set
only
includes
one
clone
that
seems
to
be
the
only
drawback
to
the
set
everything
else
looks
spot
on
the
printed
part
isnt
new
it
came
with
10178
motorized
atat
walker
also
nice
review
i
would
get
the
set
if
it
was
a
little
cheaper
or
came
with
more
than
1
fig
whyhas
it
got
2
instruction
books
the
set
isnt
particularly
big
nice
review
simon
jedi
the
v19
has
been
one
of
my
favourite
ships
since
the
release
of
cwa
and
this
is
one
of
the
sets
ive
been
considering
most
about
buying
its
great
to
see
tlgs
treatment
of
it
it
looks
like
no
expense
was
spared
making
it
as
aesthetically
and
functionally
accurate
as
possible
though
i
think
the
cockpit
windshield
could
maybe
have
been
slightly
bigger
but
thats
just
me
im
sure
it
looks
pretty
big
compared
to
other
starfighters
too
did
it
take
a
long
time
to
build
great
review
simonjedi
i
really
like
that
you
included
lots
of
photos
of
your
build
i
put
together
my
v19
torrent
last
night
and
i
was
surprised
by
how
heavy
the
completed
ship
is
it
has
some
real
heft
once
its
finished
wow
it
is
a
really
cool
ship
i
was
disappointed
that
the
central
wing
doesnt
really
lock
into
place
once
it
flips
down
it
just
kind
of
droops
there
so
i
attached
a
technic
pin
to
the
locking
arm
so
it
could
plug
into
the
2x4
brick
thats
on
the
underside
of
the
starfighter
this
brick
can
be
seen
in
your
photo
of
the
bottom
of
the
ship
overall
the
build
is
one
of
the
more
confusing
that
ive
seen
i
had
to
dismantle
and
rebuild
the
first
engine
after
i
realized
id
left
out
a
piece
and
i
kept
thinking
of
the
poor
7yearold
that
gets
this
set
as
hisher
very
first
lego
set
ever

this

just
as
well
as
the

that
the

to

theres
only
one
fig
in
it
since
its
kind
of
expensive
though
thats
my
opinion
but
the
ship
is
really
awesome
its
too
bad
theres
not
a
battlepack
that
includes
clone
pilots

i
built
mine
today
as
soon
as
i
tried
to
put
it
in
attack
position
the
thingy
rotates
the
wrong
way
and
it
falls
apart
what
a
waste
of
55
i
suggest
you
to
check
again
if
you
put
the
technic
gear
in
the
correct
way
cause
if
not
than
maybe
that
the
problem
also
i
dont
think
it
is
a
waste
in
my
opinion
the
ship
is
very
well
designed
and
is
actually
pretty
strong
or
at
least
mine
and
the
pilot
minifig
is
fantastic
even
if
there
is
just
one
of
them

all
you
need
to
do
is
build
it
correctly
yes
yes
i
do
im
just
kind
of
lazy
it
just
didnt
work
out
for
me
is
all
i
love
this
set
and
i
gave
it
outstanding
i
might
note
though
that
the
cylinder
is
just
there
as
a
dampener
when
disenegaged
the
wing
function
still
works
just
not
as
smoothly
interestingly
though
the
cylinder
is
an
old
piece
i
have
a
few
others
its
just
that
this
is
the
first
time
its
been
used
without
a
spring
i
had
no
problems
assembling
this
set
outstanding
train
set
the
legend
of
the
entire
train
series
is
the
metroliner
this
is
a
super
5
set
the
color
design
minifigs
is
just
so
perfect
and
lovely
it
resemble
the
trains
which
we
see
on
our
rails
in
our
daily
life
i
cant
find
any
flaws
on
this
at
all
the
only
flaw
i
noticed
is
my
mistake
of
not
able
to
buy
this
set
at
all
in
fact
i
had
never
seen
this
set
in
the

before

how
cool
is
that
and
11
minifigs
when
was
the
last
time
lego
included
11
figs
in
a
single
set
there
is
another
set
fufil
the
criteria
above
which
is
also
a
well
known
legend
it
has
12
minifigs
which
is
the
10159
city
airport
aka
century
skyway
airport
this
is
a
great
review
of
a
great
set
hairy
ruben
i
voted
for
outstanding
since
the
only
thing
you
can
say
about
this
train
set
is
that
it
is
outstanding
it
has
been
the
best
passenger
train
in
all
the
time
from
legos
beginning
on
until
now
i
bought
the
rereleased
version
of
it
in
2003
and
i
really
really
do
not
regret
it
klausdieter
i
also
voted
outstanding
for
the
simple
reason
that
ive
owned
this
set
for
a
long
time
but
for
most
of
the
time
its
been
an
anonymous
heap
of
bricks
mixed
with
all
the
other
bricks
i
have
so
about
a
year
ago
i
started
rebuilding
it
and
it
now
sits
proudly
next
to
also
rebuilt
2150
on
my
shelf
imo
its
an
excellent
set
best
of
the
9v
passenger
trains
no
doubt
and
it
combines
the
best
of
the
80s
trains
with
that
of
the
90s
its
not
some
futuristic
panoramaglassed
lowslung
train
but
an
honest
realisticlooking
train
that
captures
many
of
the
features
that
passenger
trains
used
to
and
in
some
cases
still
have
i
dont
like
the
set
and
i
do
like
the
set
the
reason
why
i
like
it
it
looks
good
the
reason
why
i
hate
it
this
train
was
the
first
train
for
the
new
9v
system
and
it
means
to
me
the
end
of
the
beautiful
12v
series
for
this
last
reason
i
own
this
set
i
voted
average
only
strange
they
named
it
metroliner
in
holland
when
we
speak
of
a
metro
i
need
to
think
at
short
distance
trains
only
used
in
big
cities
like
rotterdam
and
your
minifigs
at
pic
aint
right

you
dont
have
a
review
of
the
doubledeckerclub
car
on
the
way
do
you
i
myself
never
got
it
and
i
am
seriously
considering
buying
one
from
bricklink
plus
it
is
moreorless
an
requirement
for
this
train
one
of
very
few
doubledecker
cars
to
actually
stay
within
the
general
outer
dimensions
of
the
train
i
wish
i
could
sadly
however
i
do
not
have
the
double
deck
carriage
if
i
happen
to
see
one
for
a
decent
price
i
will
most
definitely
pick
it
up
i
never
got
this
set
i
spent
a
long
time
after
one
christmas
trying
to
get
and
failed
miserably
admittedly
i
was
much
younger
then
it
has
however
remained
one
of
my
most
sought
after
items
but
i
've
still
never
got
around
to
getting
one
the
set
generally
makes
me
rather
nostalgic
for
a
time
when
the
trains
were
painted
in
simple
liveries
like
that
one
anyway
it
seems
an
excellent
set
from
what
i
've
seen
and
the
figure
selection
is
amazing
i
hope
lego
produce
something
as
good
as
this
when
the
new
trains
are
released
next
year
outstanding
set
and
review
thanks
for
presenting
it
ive
had
this
since
it
first
came
out
but
didnt
think
it
would
be
that
impressive
so
i
didnt
bother
opening
it
now
im
tempted
aside
from
the
slight
size
issue
i
cant
find
anything
here
to
gripe
about
except
for
the
limited
availability
i
want
5
i
think
that
makes
me
a

monkey
eek
eek
youre
exactly
right
about
this
selling
like
mad
its
another
one
of
those
missed
opportunities
for
tlg
sure
its
nice
to
get
people
to
subscribe
by
offering
it
as
part
of
brickmaster
but
in
the
long
run
put
it
in
the
stores
for
6
and
sell
a
million
just
give
us
indys
manbag
we
need
it
for
postal
employees
and
such
as
is
the
running
joke
whenever
i
comment
on
one
of
your
reviews
id
give
this
a
solid
985
not
out
of
anything
just
985
or
in
clearer
terms
12
though
i
voted
5
looks
really
nice
if
they
keep
making
bm
sets
like
this
i
might
actually
subscribe
nice

too
remind
me
not
to
run
into

his

for
the
cool
review

when
i
saw
the

originally
i

it
looked
good
but
not
that
good
but
seeing
the
pictures
in
your
review
i
love
this

it
as

simply
put
id
have
to
admit
this
is
one
of
the
best
indy
sets
i
agree
its
so
sad
we
europeans
cant
get
it
thanks
for
this
great
review
hinckley
i
agree
with
you
this
set
has
to
be
released
as
normal
set
i
just
recognized
how
clever
the
building
technique
is
you
couldnt
see
that
on
the
packaging
shots
we
got
before
hopefully
im
able
to
grab
this
off
ebay
or
somewhere
else
sometime
this
set
easily
is
above
average
for
me
i
had
this
as
a
little
child
and
whenever
any
of
my
relatives
came
to
visit
us
they
brought
me
some
lego
usually
it
was
either
this
set
or
6844
the
really
nice
thing
about
this
set
are
the
alternate
builds
for
the
low
price
you
got
a
nice
range
of
parts
and
cool
ideas
what
to
build
with
them
you
could
build
a
fleet
of
rovers
or
the
alternates
and
everytime
it
was
huge
fun
i
voted
average
its
a
cute
set
and
one
which
i
built
from
parts
many
times
as
a
kid
i
didnt
own
the
set
though
thanks
for
the
review
i
voted
below
average
since
im
not
a
big
fan
of
classic
space
a
nice
set
to
go
with
the
outback
theme
i
am
kind
of
dissapointed
they
they
didint
continue
the
theme
as
i
only
managed
to
grab
6487
and
6550
none
the
less
this
set
is
very
interesting
as
its
one
of
the
few

feature

if
youd
only
know
what
memories
you
brought
back
i

i
remember
this
set
better
than
any
other
i
had
when
i
was
a
child
some
time
after
i
got
it
i
decided
to
disassemble
it
and
combine
it
with
the
jeep
from
6552
rocky
river
retreat
it
came
out
pretty
good
though
as
it
became
the
main
attraction
point
of
my
town
beeing
the
car
of
my
favourite
minifig
back
then
and
and
and
looong
story
i
kept
it
assembled
that
way
from
this
day
on
until
earlier
this
year
when
i
finally
disassembled
it
because
i
needed
the
parts
great
story
i
enjoy
hearing
people
reminisce
about
the
fun
they
had
with
certain
sets
i
always
wanted
rocky
river
retreat
but
never
picked
it
up
thats
a
great
adventure
set
as
well
i
had
never
thought
about
mixing
the
two
sets
but
they
do
have
components
that
would
compliment
one
another
nicely
if
you
still
have
the
pieces
you
should
try
restoring
the
sets
its
a
lot
of
fun

am
said
this
is
by
far
my
favourite
outback
series
set
i
loved
the
fact
that
you
can
bend
the
bridge
in
different
directions
so
that
the
suspension
of
the
car
really
worked
to
keep
the
car
levelled
like
you
placed
it
in
your
last
picture
i
had
lots
of
fun
with
this
when
it
came
out
eleven
years
ago
in
1997
the
bridge
scene
could
also
be
used
in
the
adventurers
serie
of
1998
i
think
i
may
like
the
outback
airstrip
a
little
better
but
its
close
i
agree
with
you
about
the
bridge
the
moving
pieces
are
a
nice
feature
and
makes
it
harder
for
the
jeep
to
cross
the
bridge
does
make
a
nice
addition
to
adventurers
i
added
it
to
my
jungle
adventure
diorama
a
few
months
ago

unforutunaltey
the

are
mixed
in
a

as
i
never

to

out
my
parts
you
can

i
used
the
yellow

here

applied
the
great
thing
about
the
copter
was
it
had
2
suitcases
which
as
far
as
i
can
tell
aint
a
common
part
not
rare
but
still
nice
to
have
and
it
had
the
guy
with
the
green

the
winch
wasnt
bad
either
the
only
flaw
was
it
was
a
standard
lego
copter
meaning
similar
ones
where
avalible
in
quite
a
few
sets
do
you
plan
to
review
it

nice
review

i
have
a
query
anyone
know
why
it
is
actually
called
amazon
crossing
when
its
meant
to
be
in
australia
also
the

tks
for
the
review
once
more
jay
i
totally
agree
with
you
jay
this
set
has
very
nice
details
suche
as
the
mini
gun
movable
ladder
green
barrels
and
great
figs
however
it
is
very
expensive
for
what
it
is
and
i
dont
think
there
are
that
many
very
usefall
parts
in
there
well
i
could
use
those
treads
if
i
ever
buy
this
set
its
really
not
for
the
design
which
i
totally
dislike
quote
i
would
easily
pay
30
for
this
no
questions
asked
but
40
was
a
hard
sell
for
me
is
it
easier
for
you
to
eat
if
you
know
that
this
would
cost
you
around
60
if
you
live
in
denmark
so
it
comes
with
an
extra
gunholding
arm
it
looks
like
it
and
thats
great
that
way
you
can
make
all
of
the

lego
introduced
a
new
theme
called
resq
the
theme
was
really
a
quasicoast
guard
subtheme
of
classic
town
the
theme
included
boats
helicopters
emergency
vehicles
and
even
a
water
hovercraft
most
notable
was
the
black
and
yellow
color
combination
that
predominated
the
sets
i
only
picked
up
a
couple
of
sets
from
the
theme
including
this
emergency
evacuation
vehicle
that
i
consider
a
van
i
never
got
into
the
theme
but
looking
back
at
these
sets
i
have
gained
a
better
appreciation
for
their
value
in
classic
town
lets
take
a
look
at
6445
in
greater
detail
starting
with
the
box
the
back
of
the
box
providing
a
few
alternate
models
and
similar
imagery
on
the
instructions
the
set
includes
one
small
sheet
of
decals
for
the
van
6445
has
one
resq
minifig
that
i
find
pretty
nice
i
like
the
neon
orange
reflectors
he
has
a
nice
printed
backside
with
the
word
resq
prominently
displayed
this
little
set
includes
an
abundance
of
tools
a
black
walkietalkie
is
not
pictured
heres
the
emergency
van
i
like
the
back
section
that
has
a
nice
winch
with
turning
wheel
and
a
few
hooks
for
tools
heres
the
minifig
pulling
the
grappling
hook
for
some
resq
action
this
is
my
favorite
part
of
this
set
the
van
isnt
too
fancy
but
has
some
neat
features
while
i
like
the
blue
windshield
piece
for
maybe
space
sets
im
not
really
fond
of
its
use
for
the
van

has
no
steering
wheel
but
rather
two
levers
for
steering
on
the
top
of
the
vehicle
are
two
emergency
alarms
and
some
extra
lights
the
back
of
the
van
has
a
large
opening
piece
that
allows
wide
access
to
the
back
section
it
comfortably
fits
a
long
gurneystretcher
heres
the
driver
resting
on
the
gurney
he
should
never
have
tried
to
pick
up
the
gurney
without
a
2nd
resq
minifig
and
a
shot
of
the
back
section
without
the
gurney
lastly
a
picture
of
the
complete
set
final
thoughts
resq
is
really
a
neat
theme
that
has
great
play
value
for
kids
while
its
not
one
of
my
more
favorite
town
subthemes
it
does
offer
some
nice
pieces
and
an
abundance
of
black
and
yellow
pieces
i
think
a
few
of
the
resq
sets
go
nicely
with
the
divers
theme
released
one
year
earlier
in
1997
i
had
a
chance
to
purchase
the
largest
set
of
the
theme
6479
emergency
response
center
at
half
the
price
but
passed
back
in
the
late
90s
id
be
interested
in
finding
out
what
other
eb
members
think
of
this
set
and
the
resq
theme
wow
and
people
complain
that
a
military
type
line
would
be
to
violent
here
we
have
half
dead
soilders
and
a
space
shuttle
bombing
people
with
severed
skeleton
heads
i
have
to
say
this
is
the
first
time
ive
heard
of
this
theme
i
like
the
colors
as
most
have
pointed
out
the
base
plate
is
preety
cool
two
could
use
it
to
moc
up
some
garages
i
am
a
proud
owner
of
this
set
like
others
i
got
it
discounted
and
couldnt
resit
the
parts
pack
this
is
the
type
of
lego
sets
that
bothers
me
when
you
look
at
it
now
youd
be
tempted
to
say
hey
not
bad
but
at
the
same
time
some
years
ago
it
wasnt
good
enough
to
buy
it
full
price
i
was
kinda
disappointed
because
usually
sets
using
that
kinda
baseplates
are
excellent
castle
paradisa
and
this
one
is
just
ok
one
really
minus
point
would
be
the
lack
of
any
opponent
faction
in
the
set
thats
it
thanks
for
the
review
but
now
you
make
me
want
to
build
my
own
one
thanks
a
lot
on
a
more
serious
note
i
really
like
this
set
and
have
always
wished
to
aquire
it
i
have
two
broken
tie
interceptors
so
this
should
be
a
easy
build
and
as
someone
in
the
pirate
forum
i
think
said
it
would
be
a
great
baseplate
for
building
cave
to
hide
the
booty
thanks
pmg
and
welcome
another
outstanding
review
by
the
awesome
set
reviewer
i
enjoyed
reading
this
review
very
much
and
i
felt
that
you
have
redress
twilight
in
an
approriate
manner
i
have
very
mixed
feeling
about
this
set
especially
with
its
design
it
seemed
i
will
need
to
watch
the
clone
wars
movie
in
the
theatre
before
i
compared
with
it
most
of
the
time
when
this
lego
set
is
used
in
a
movie
you
will
tend
to
compare
it
and
what
is
the
actual
purpose
for
twilight
same
as
the
rest
of
the
sw
vehicles
and
aircraft
for
a
high
price
like
this
i
can
actually
top
up
a
little
more
and
get
the
atte
with
the
same
batch
of
minifigs
plus
commander
rex
if
there
is
a
special
figure
such
as
the
v19
torrent
clone
pliot
it
will
be
a
much
ideal
scenario
at
the
moment
i
have
not
bring
in
any
clone
war
sets
into
my
collection
and
i
am
quite
sure
twilight
is
not
in
my
priority
list
especially
when
i
am
not
a
fullpledged
star
war
collectors
or
i
have
strong
intentions
to
complete
the
entire
range
in
this
recent
release
therefore
i
need
to
prioritise
my
purchase
and
likely
to
get
two
rgs
since
that
is
my
favourite
ship
in
clone
war
era
i
am
not
comparing
it
with
rgs
both
sets
defintely
have
their
pros
and
cons
oh
i
love
that
postcard
you
made
certainly
looks
very
nice
sveltecorps
thanks
for
doing
up
this
superb
detailed
review
which
had
given
twilight
the
neccessary
attention
it
should
have
wow
certainly
much
bigger
than
i
would
have
thought
thanks
for
the
great
review
and
pictures
well
for
some
reason
i
was
drawn
to
this
set
but
with
the
lack
of
interior
and
quite
a
bit
of
technics
i
think
ill
pass
or
at
least
get
the
atte
first
thanks
again

i
read
the
visual
guide
recently
and
learned
a
bit
more
about
the
twilight
i
wont
get
into
spoilers
but
it
seems
that
the
ship
becomes
a
sort
of
endearing
family
van
for
the
characters
which
is
neat
big
bulky
uncool
but
it
gets
you
from
one
place
to
another
if
it
factors
into
more
than
just
the
90
minute
film
i
may
pick
this
up
it
seems
that
theres
room
for
a
lot
of
personality
in
this
ship
once
you
see
the
film
it
is
a
corellian
freighter
smuggling
spice
for
the
hutts
thats
cool
right
lol
the
minivan
of
the
galaxy
what
a
selling
point
if
i
am
really
impressed
with
it
in
the
film
i
suppose
that
would
change
things
but
i
will
have
to
see
thanks
a
lot
for
a
very
nice
and
entertaining
review
your
photos
were
really
nice
and
there
have
been
some
reviews
lately
that
have
such
blurry
pics
cough
cough
it
was
a
pleasure
to
see
you
can
1
put
lego
bricks
together
2
write
a
review
3
handle
your
camera
i
think
this
ship
is
underrated
it
is
really
nice
i
love
the
playing
features
like
landing
gear
and
back
door
perhaps
just
cause
i
had
to
get
along
with
so
called
landing
gears
in
the
past
that
did
not
work
at
all
7140
for
example
and
i
simply
love
that
there
is
space
inside
you
said
there
is
not
really
some
cause
of
the
landing
gear
mechanism
but
it
seems
it
should
be
easily
fixed
do
you
think
there
is
enough
space
to
put
some
plates
over
the
landing
gear
and
add
some
beds
kitchen
und
tv
i
think
this
set
is
so
perfect
to
mod
it
into
a
clone
wars
mobile
home
your
back
garden
ist
just
perfect
for
this
i
prefer
this
over

on

only
issue
is
that
its

to

you
could
do
it
from
either
the
side
door
or
rear
door
though
maybe
move
that
tow
line
at

i
have
to

good
review
there
my
daughter
loves
the
backyard
garden
of
the
twilight
my
opinion
of
the
ship
has
changed
after
reading
this
thanks
very
good
set
indeed
the
possibility
to
alter
the
knights
appearance
hugely
boosts
the
value
very
smart
thinking
of
tlc
got
one
of
these
so
far
but
if
i
ever
do
a
castlerelated
comic
or
animation
this
will
be
the
set
i
buy
tons
of
another
small
set
my
local
target
doesnt
have
they
dont
have
the
best
castle
selection
they
only
really
have
dwarven
mines
and
castle
seiges
ill
buy
this
if
i
see
it
there
though
because
it
looks
like
a
great
little
set
i
could
use
the
awesome
knight
and
a
skeleton
that
has
a
regular
body
so
he
looks
like
he
is
in
armor

the
quality
of
the
set
feel
free
to
comment
on
the
review
andor
set
also
thanks
the
set
is
average
its
useful
for
picking
up
a
few
knights
but
im
not
really
partial
to
the
skeleton
the
idea
of
a
knight
and
a
skeleton
tilting
just
strikes
me
as
being
odd
my
biggest
issue
with
the
current
castle
line
is
that
most
sets
force
you
to
purchase
a
mixture
of
skeletonsknights
orcsknights
orcsdwarves
etc
this
is
fine
for
those
of
you
who
love
your
fantasy
however
it
makes
the
line
a
bit
underwhelming
for
the
rest
of
us
still
as
mentioned
earlier
the
set
does
have
an
upside
so
it
is
worth
a
purchase
the
review
on
the
other
hand
is

with
great

there
were
quite
a
few
sets
in
the
1980s
that
werent
sold
in
the
us
i
remember
reading
once
that
it
was
because
they
contained
wine
glasses
and
tlg
felt
they
wouldnt
be
able
to
market
a
toy
that
encourage
the
drinking
of
alcohol
this
set
was
one
of
them
i
remember
seeing
this
in
a
catalog
that
came
with
a
fabuland
set
and
wondering
what
it
was
and
where
i
could
get
one
i
wrote
to
lego
and
got
an
overseas
catalog
which
had
the
futuron
6990
monorail
transport
system
in
it
before
it
was
available
in
the
us
i
was
amazed
i
ended
up
buying
6349
holiday
villa
from
that
catalog
but
for
some
reason
gave
it
to
my
best
friend
for
his
birthday
ive
always
wanted
this
set
and
finally
bought
it
from
bricklink
this
year
my
purchase
included
everything
except
the
box
i
really
like
the
boxes
but
in
lieu
of
a
boxshot
here
is
the
instruction
manual
i
imagine
this
was
the
image
on
the
front
of
the
box
the
parts
one
of
the
things
that
appealed
to
me
about
this
set
is
its
abundance
of
rare
parts
this
base
plate
is
an
excellent
piece
and
was
only
available
in
two
sets
classic
lego
telephone
technically
these
blue
windows
1
x
4
x
5
windows
are
only
available
in
this
set
according
to
bricklink
it
was
available
in
different
form
with
and
without
fixed
glass
trans
blue
glass
in
other
sets
regardless
this
size
and
color
window
is
rare
and
the
blue
door
was
only
available
in
4
sets
this
was
a
huge
selling
point
for
me
as
im
a
window
monkey
never
heard
that
term
its
like
a
parts
monkey
a
collector
who
buys
mulitples
of
sets
just
for
parts
or
large
lots
of
bulk
from
bl
and
sorts
them
into
bins
but
just
for
windows
tell
your
friends
i
coined
the
term
these
sloped
windows
have
endless
possibilities
in
many
themes
maybe
not
with
the
curtain
decals
applied
but
are
another
great
rare
part
that
appears
in
this
set
the
build
remember
this
piece
id
like
to
see
a
badass
agents
car
built
on
this
car
base
i
am
a
fan
of
the
sixwide
car
but
i
see
the
appeal
of
the
four
wide
it
has
a
very
nostalgic
feel
to
it
theres
no
denying
that
this
is
a
beauty
of
classic
lego
4wide
cars
this
set
comes
with
two
minifigures
one
of
which
appears
to
be
a
painter
classic
vintage
lego
figs
onto
the
house
which
begins
with
the
basic
floorplan
a
kitchen
thats
open
to
the
rest
of
the
house
and
a
little
oven
and
hood
vent
is
one
of
my
favorite
touches
its
one
thing
to
throw
an
oven
into
a
house
set
but
the
designer
of
this
set
made
it
a
cool
part
of
the
architecture
of
the
house
which
gives
it
a
unique
feel
the
completed
first
floor
and
carport
i
do
wish
the
sides
of
the
roof
were
white
with
a
little
overhang
like
an
actual
roof
this
method
of
white
on
bottom
red
on
top
looks
more
like
a
childs
drawing
than
a
real
house
this
is
easily
fixed
with
some
modifying
still
you
get
a
lot
of
roof
pieces
in
this
set
here
we
have

needed
inspiration
its
not

hey
nothing
is
perfect

brick
cool
review
i
never
knew
that
those
wineglasses
could
be
the
reason
for
this
not
being
sold
in
the
us
this
is
an
awesome
set
man
and
a
great
review
just
too
bad
it
is
so
rare
i
voted
5
by
the
way
does
anyone
know
if
there
is
a
review
for
this
or
other
sets
that
come
with
a
camper
perhaps
also
i
was
wondering
if
the
creator
houses
are
in
scale
and
could
be
used
with
minifigs
and
such
again
a
great
review
whitefang
i
voted
for
average
the
minifig
and
the
accessoríes
are
excellent
but
the
raft
itself
is
very
poor
klausdieter
glad
some
of
you
like
this
set
for
the
wide
variety
of
good
accessories
it
seemed
some
are
unfavour
of
the
rafts
design
well
i
think
for
an
impulse
set
the
rafts
design
is
quite
good
at
least
it
took
care
of
the
color
scheme
well
its
just
a
simple
raft
for
the
adventurer
to
move
onto
the
river
stream
and
throw
some
dynamitte
to
blow
some
obstacles
away

this
would
be
great
for
any

fan
the

for
the

some
spare

for

a

for
a

and
a
rather
simple
raft
for
that
unlucky
pirate
lost
at
sea
your
comments
make
me
feel
like
i
has
just
done
a
pirate
review
instead
of
an
extreme
team
review
water
and
lit
dynamite
isnt
a
good
match
cool
then
i
think
ill
do
a
review
of
6451
river
response
later
today
or
tomorrow
stay
tuned
looks
like
a
nice
helicoptor
i
love
the
2
cockpits
i
love
the
divers
head
i
really
need
one
of
those
this
helicopter
is
so
cool
and
i
agreed
with
you
that
this
is
a
high
playablity
set
its
not
common
to
see
such
a
big
scale
helicopter
which
has
two
cockpits
back
then
the
color
scheme
works
well
for
me
with
so
much
features
such
as
the
lowering
of
the
grappling
hook
storage
box
storing
of
the
gurney
and
etc
one
thing
which
can
be
improved
onto
the
helicopter
is
the
rotors
it
could
be
extended
a
little
longer
as
the
size
of
the
helicopter
is
too
big
it
makes
the
rotors
rather
weak
as
it
is
not
able
to
support
the
weight
i
am
confused
why
there
is
an
extreme
team
personnel
there
i
thought
he
was
supposed
to
be
recovered
from
the
resq
team
although
there
is
so
many
questions
in
my
head
such
as
why
include
the
black
tricycle
bike
extreme
team
and
etc
but
this
is
still
one
very
good
set
to
play
with
too
bad
i
had
never
seen
this
before
somehow
through
your
review
i
like
it
very
much
the
only
big
scale
helicopter
which
i
owned
is
the
7738
coast
guard
helicopter
and
lift
raft
neverthless
i
gave
this
a
4
thanks
brickster
the
helicopter
looks
nice
and
the
resq
minifigs
were
nice
the
diver
minifig
had
once
been
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
a
neat
set
with
lots
of
accessories
but
i
never
liked
any
of
the
lego
helicopters
with
long
streamlined
canopies
as
they
are
obviously
more
influenced
by
military
helicopters
and
space
ships
than
by
real
civilian
transport
helicopters
id
give
it
a
3
at
best
very
good
and
thourough
pictorial
review
though
i
stopped
collecting
lego
sets
in
the
early
90s
because
of
this
kind
of
sets
ive
always
been
a
classic
town
fan
and
i
really
didnt
liked
the
futuristic
design
of
tlcs
newer
sets
i
think
the
set
is
too
unrealistic
i
like
the
new
resq
sets
better
and
im
somewhat
a
lifeboat
freak
so
im
always
following
such
a
sets
with
interest
i
would
like
to
see
some
rigit
inflatable
boats
some
day
but
about
the
chopper
i
like
the
accessoiries
this
is
one
of
my
favourite
sets
i
remember
getting
it
in
tesco
soon
after
it
was
released
those
were
the
days
the
resq
line
was
good
and
this
set
made
it
better
nice
review
i
always
wanted
this
set
the
speed
boat
makes
the
set
thanks
for
sharing
nice
review
i
collect
castle
too
and
the
ghost
isnt
really
rare
i
have
one
too
but
its
not
really
found
anymore
so
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
keep
it
anyway
great

this
is
a
pretty
nice
set
i
really
like
the
torso
and
its
genericness
so
it
can
be
used
for
other
factions
and
at
least
this
set
has
2
shields
althought
i
prefer
the
triangular
ones
instead
of
just
1
shield
you
get
from
crossbow
attack
from
the
wrong
fraction
id
have
liked
a
crown
knights
shield
100x
better
some
improvements
for
this
set
would
be
a
normal
bow
and
a
sword
instead
of
2
of
the
3
crossbows
smaller
wheels
and
triangular
shields
45
from
me
actually
35
but
ill
round
it
up
originally
shared
in
the
history
adventure
forum
for
its
adventure
attributes
heres
my
favorite
of
the
outback
collection
first
let
me
say
that
this
little
set
is
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
because
it
can
be
used
to
sumplement
a
number
of
different
themes
1
the
set
makes
a
great
little
adventure
airstrip
for
adventurers
and
more
recent
the
indiana
jones
theme
see
also
german
headquarters
and
port
adventure
ive
also
used
the
set
as
an
addition
to
my
wild
west
town
the
tan
baseplate
and
windmill
works
great
just
subtract
the
plane
modern
equipment
and
figs
and
lastly
as
the
set
was
intended
as

starting
with
the
box
and
the
backside
notice
the
alternate
models
i
love
the
swamp
boat
the
building
is
my
favorite
part
of
the
set
it
is
simple
has
a
little
detail
two
great
roof
pieces
and
a
single
green
window
great
piece
check
out
the
great
windmill
piece
its
my
only
one
and
makes
a
great
part
for
wild
west
and
that
farm
you
always
wanted
to
build
i
used
it
for
the
barnhouse
of
barnabas
higgens
and
spring
valley
ranch
on
the
side
of
the
building
is
a
great
radio
and
a
clear
glass
unfortunately
no
furniture
can
be
found
within
the
building
and
now
the
airplane
front
view
i
love
the
twin
propellors
side
view
and
the
rear
section
the
back
has
a
small
cargo
hold
for
some
boxesfreight
or
some
gear
needed
in
the
outback
the
set
includes
three
figs
two
with
cool
shades
and
some
great
equipment
i
love
the
boom
box
a
shot
of
the
whole
set
and
another
summary
as
i
mentioned
above
this
set
is
very
versatile
and
can
suplement
a
few
different
themes
its
my
personal
favorite
of
the
outback
collection
and
im
really
glad
i
was
able
to
find
the
set
in
the
late
90s
i
almost
didnt
buy
sets
like
this
are
timeless
and
so
much
fun
to
build
and
display
hope
you
enjoy

great
review
this
set
has
cool
features
i
just
wish
that
lego
would
release
this
as
a
lego
legend
and
release
it
to
australia
too
since
this
is
a
set
about
australia
i
wouldve
bought
two
if
this
were
a
lego
legend
that
is
how
good
it
is
i
like
the
building
with
latticed
window
and
windmill
i
also
like
the
cargo
airplane
windsock
and
radios
plus
it
looks
like
its
got
great
minifigs
the
building
is
great
and
detailed
with
a
few
mods
it
could
be
added
to
my
castle
town
i
dont
really
like
the
plane
though
seems
kind
of
abstract
not
really
good
in
my
opinion
but
i
bet
it
would
be
easy
to
mod
to
look
better

i
remember
getting
this
set
solely
because
i
collect
star
wars
as
i
rebuild
it
and
took
pics
of
it
i
found
that
i
actually
like
this
set
for
different
reasons
dookus
speeder
is
pretty
cool
and
the
lightsabre
rocks
the
dooku
minifig
is
also
great
whats
not
so
great
is
the
flythingy
and
getting
another
yoda
though
thats
kinda
hard
not
to
get
in
a
set
focused
on
their
duel
you
cant
see
the
wires
because
they
digitally
removed
them
be
careful
or
ill
digidally
remove
your
head
steven
seagal
i
hope
i
quoted
that
one
right
so
to
get
the
review
on
the
move
ill
impress
you
all
with
a
box
picture
neat
huh
one
of
the
smaller
boxes
but
still
kinda
big
when
consider
that
you
only
get
74
pieces
and
2
minifigs
the
instruction
isnt
that
big
as
i
said
the
dooku
minifigs
is
awesome
i
love
the
print
on
his
torso
that
combines
the
brown
cape
with
the
torso
and
also
the
head
is
neatly
designed
not
a
fleshie
though
this
was
before
the
fleshlicensefacelift
a
sideview
of
the
light
blue
speeder
mmmm
that
crome
light
sabre
hilt
is
nice
the
design
of
the
speeder
is
also
ok
and
without
the
usual
offcolourscheme
bricks
no
tan
or
yellow
sticking
out
there
yeah
id
panic
too
if
this
came
right
at
mewho
wouldnt
when
noones
driving
and
a
rear
shot
i
think
the
design
is
a
little
off
the
shields
makes
it
all
a
little
too
open
in
my
opinion
the
printed
bricks
are
a
kick
and
thus
evens
the
score
here
this
hideous
design
is
meant
to
flip
yoda
around
the
air
put
him
in
this
funfair
from
hell
thing
and
give
him
a
twister
he
and
dooku
will
never
forget
my
guess
is
that
its
there
to
add
some
playability
but
its
just
odd
and
quite
useless
much
like
the
playability
soccer
thingies
in
the
ultimate
light
sabre
duel
the
verdict
ups
and
downs
this
set
offers
both
i
rate
it
as
average
since
the
size
and
price
of
the
set
make
it
acceptable
to
have
odd
things
confused
good
so
am
i
making
a
small
set
isnt
that
easy
and
remeber
this
set
is
from
2002
and
a
lot
has
happended
since
then
designwise
that
is
what
do
you
think
whats
wrong
with
another
yoda
and
some
nice
light
blue
bricks
i
probably
would
destroy
this
set
and
keep
the
minifigs
intack
tough
chrome
lightsabers
on
no
yoda
was
released
in
no
less
than
34
sets
ok
so
i
remembered
wrong
i
just
have
plenty
yodas
and
one
is
more
than
enough
for
the
set
list
click
here
thanks
for
pointing
that
out
thanks
for
the
nice
review
kimt
i
like
this
set
especially
by
the
fact
that
it
is
the
only
set
containing
the
dooku
minifig
and
the
curved
lightsaber
i
also
think
that
the
minifig
is
cool
but
i
also
own
the
dagobah
xwing
and
the
wookiee
catamaran
sets
so
i
have
enought
minifigs
a
clone
wars
version
would
be
very
cool
and
the
extrathingy
is
well
just
ok
the
bad
part
is
that
i
dont
buy
the
set
when
it
is
out
and
now
is
go
for
40
on
ebay
and

wasnt
this
the
only
yoda
that
was
ever
released
except
for
the
one
in
the
dagobahxwing
set
sure
he
is
not
the
best
fig
with
the
unmovable
legs
and
all
but
still
its
yoda
edit
im
pretty
sure
we
got
a
yoda
in
the
wookiee
catamaran
set
from
revenge
of
the

runs
to
check
brickset
yep
theres
a
yoda
in
that
set
as
well
but
the
jedi

is
the
only
reasonably
priced
set
with
the
green
forceguru
nevermind
looks
like
a
couple
of
other
members
already
covered
yodas
availability
in
other
sets
back
on
topic
great
review
and
a
real
blast
from
the
past
i
never
did
get
this
set
just
didnt
care
for
the
speederbike
or
the
weird
piece
of
equipment
thanks
for
explaining
that
its
supposed
to
be
used
to
forcejump
spin
yoda
all
over
the
place
i
never
knew
thats
what
it
was
for
anyway
wish
i
had
known
yoda
and
dooku
were
going
to
be
impossible
to
get
later
i
mayve
picked
this
set
up
just
for
the

i
missed
out
on
this
set
but
it
looks
pretty
good
imo
thanks
for
clearing
up
what
that
thing
was
i
thought
it
was
something
they
flung
at
eachother
in
the
movie
i
like
the
lightsaber
also
but
why
did
they
stop
making
chrome
ones
i
got
this
set
a
long
time
ago
the
review
pretty
much
says
all
there
is
to
say
about
it
never
knew
what
the
redbrown
thing
was
anyway
i
used
it
as
a
canon
isnt
this
also
the
only
set
up
until
now
that
had
count
dooku
in
it
cheers
for
the
review
kimt
of
the
initial
episode
ii
lego
releases
this
set
was
the
least
inspiring
but
the
minifigs
were
musthaves
you
cant
go
wrong
with
count
dooku
and
yoda
i
like
the
design
of
dookus
speeder
in
the
movie
but
lego
missed
the
mark
a
bit
with
it
here
and
gave
him
a
dodgy
flying
boat
instead
the
speeder
cradleyoda
jumping
mechanism
was
just
a
waste
of
parts
unfortunately
id
like
to
see
dookus
speeder
reimagined
by
lego
theyve
come
a
long
way
in
the
way
they
design
a
lot
of
the
new
star
wars
sets
thanks
for
the
review
its
always
good
to
have
a
2nd

on

ive
added

tomorrow

great
to

a

which
ill
surely
buy
when
i
find
it
very
nice
review
one
thing
you
have
to
consider
when
lego
sees
pics
of
the
star
wars
universe
they
have
to
decide
which
would
be
the
easiest
set
to
make
with
the
most
playibility
therefore
they
chose
the

unfortunately
never
owned
this
great
set
so
here
we
go
first
i
have
to
say
that
i
really
love
this
late
90s
town
theme
and
i
wish
there
would
have
been
produced
more
sets
this
is
the
only
one
i
own
well
beside
that
i
also
still
have
6572
wind
runners
but
the
car
is
missing
anyway
lets
face
the
facts
and
let
the
pictures
speak
for
themselves

lets
start
off
with
a
few
quick
shots
of
the
box
instructions
inside
of
the
box
we
got
some
ideas
for
alternative
models
on
the
backside
the
same
ones
are
also
on
the
backside
of
the
instructions
instructions
heres
an
overall
view
of
this
huge
set
we
get
4
minifigs
each
with
different
heads
and
color
patterns
which
i
really
like
and
also
a
good
amount
of
equipment
for
them
lets
move
on
with
the
cool
vehicles
there
are
3
completely
different
ones
in
this
set
first
is
the
neat
little
trike
next
the
not
less
neat
4wheeled
offroadthing
dont
know
whats
it
called
really
and
finally
the
huge
monster
truck
i
love
the
chrome
sidepipes
and
the
wench
with
the
hook
in
the
back
which
adds
a
lot
of
playability
oh
i
almost
forgot
our
brave
adventurers
also
have
got
a
raft
to
ride
the
wild
mountain
waters
now
lets
focus
on
the
many
details
of
the
mountain
base
we
got
a
bridge
over
troubled
waters
but
be
aware
its
very
unstable
love
the
wood
patterns
on
the
yellow
1x6
tiles
on
a
corner
a
camera
is
mounted
to
document
the
wild
life
for
the
evenings
we
also
got
a
little
campfire
down
by
the
river
sits
a
grey
falcon
and
watches
the
guys
on
their
challenges
whats
that
seems
not
very
safe
to
be
honestbe
aware
when
you
pass
by
these
rocks
cause
it
will
collapse
lets
move
up
again
where
the
tent
is
placed
inside
is
plenty
of
space
to
take
a
rest
for
the
figs
and
to
store
their
equipment
but
i
think
they
should
have
built
the
tent
on
another
place
cause
the
ground
isnt
very
good
there
when
you
pull
the
mechanism
a
trap
door
opens
will
the
guys
all
come
back
home
safe
and
not
injured
you
decide
all
in
all
this
is
a
really
great
set
ome
may
say
it
is
a
bit
juniorized
because
of
the
baseplate
but
it
really
isnt
its
got
a
lot
of
playability
and
some
rare
parts
the
biggest
beeing
the
baseplate
which
is
only
available
in
this
set
i
hope
you
liked
my
review
let
me
know
your
opinions

i
remember
getting
this
for
christmas
and
despite
the
earthy
grey
parts
i
relly
enjoyed
it
and
it
is
nice
to
see
pictures
of
it
again
thanks
excellent
review
metalandi
i
really
think
this
looks
like
a
fun
set
i
esp
love
the
mountain
bridge
and
baseplate
it
has
adventure
fun
written
all
over
it
thanks
for
taking
the
time
to
review
this
set
ive
always
seen
it
in
pictures
but
never
closeup
cool
set
i
like
the
tent
and
monster
truck
the
most
thank
you
for
that
very
interesting
review
metalandi
a
cool
set
with
a
lot
of
features
and
some
nifty
vehicles
very
playable
and
well
designed
indeed
perhaps
a
bit
too
colorful
for
my
likings
but
pretty
impressive
in
its
conception
for
sure
i
wish
we
could
see
some
more
landscaping
coming
along
with
todays
vehicle
sets
as
well
when
i
first
saw
this
review

thought
it

it
was

nice
review
though
i
never
got
into
rock
raiders
i
would
have
loved
the
large
drill
bit
piece
for
set
s
4970
and
4940
this
set
looks
like
a
little
boulder
hawler
and
a
nice
set
to
introduce
someone
unfamilar
with
the
theme
i
esp
like
the
fig
and
the
little
2x2
drill
bit
tile
the
overall
set
looks
like
it
has
some
very
useful

pieces

review
and

for

was
the
shit
back
in

was

for
the
review
i
just
have
to
point
out
a
few
things
to
give
you
constructive
criticism
first
of
all
its
chef
not
chief
entirely
different
professions
and
secondly
the
scale
you
give
in
the
poll
isnt
very
even
above
average
jumps
to
outstanding
which
is
a
too
big
of
a
gap
in
my
opinion
you
shouldve
used
good
or
great
in
between
them
but
these
are
only
minor
faults
this
is
a
good
review
anyway
sandy
i
appericate
your
constructive
comments
in
order
to
improve
the
quality
of
my
review
i
had
amended
the
word
chief
to
chef
you
might
want
to
check
it
i
did
not
notice
that
i
was
using
the
wrong
word
as
for
the
poll
definitions
which
have
been
used
for
1
to
5
we
used
poor
to
represent
value
1
while
outstanding
to
represent
value
5
we
need
to
use
clear
definitions
to
illustrate
and
demostrate
nonbias
towards
the
review
for
the
readers
to
cast
their
vote
depending
on
their
individual
liking
therefore
we
used
a
common
word
which
is
known
as
average
in
surveys
for
measuring
its
sample
sizes
liking
we
have
to
use
words
which
is
neutral
such
as
strongly
agree
agree
neutral
disagree
strongly
disagree
thats
why
we
used
this
rating
approach
to
represent
the
terms

dont
always
trust
peeron
sometimes
they
miss
some
pieces
and
sometimes
they
just
cant
count
them
i
am
hoping
to
see
a
pizza
outlet
again
maybe
in
2010
well
peeron
can
sometimes
be

it
can
served

rereleased

i
agreed
with

in

recently
there
was
a
hot
topic
created
by
kd
on
what
is
your
favourite
takeaway
look
at
here
for
more
discussions
and
views
i
used
to
want
this
set
so
badly
and
i
almost
got
it
when
it
was
rereleased
i
still
wonder
why
i
didnt
because
with
a
building
van
5
pizzas
and
a
then
very
rare
female
fig
this
set
would
have
been
perfect
for
someone
with
a
smaller
collection
like
i
had
then
what
surprised
me
the
most
is
how
well
this
set
still
holds
up
to
others
today
off
to
bricklink
definitely
one
of
my
favorite
sets
from
my
childhood
i
still
remember
my
sister
getting
it
for
me
for
my
birthday
and
me
building
it
that
same
day
too
bad
i
had
it
displayed
all
these
years
on
my
windowsill
so
the
pizza
delivery
van
and
pizzeria
have
become
yellowed
thanks
for
the
nice
review
of
this
great
set
whitefang
i
always
want
to
grab
one
but
the
price
to
buy
it
now
is
too
forbidding
i
also
always
think
the
girl
minifig
is
supposed
to
be
a
customer
lego
is
really
up
to
everyones

do
you
mean
this
one
httpwwwbricksetaspxset29621
i
would
also
like
to
get
that
alone
for
the
fact
that
its
the
only
resq
set
with
a
female
fig
i
have
this
set
and
its
pretty
nice
i
love
the
resq
theme
in
general
i
think
that
tow
truck
is
easily
the
highlight
of
this
set
and
is
probably
the
best
such
vehicle
ive
seen
in
any
city
set
the
other
vehicles
are
also
great
the
base
itself
is
lacking
though
as
it
basically
consists
of
one
room
that
doesnt
even
have
side
walls
it
does
include
a
cool
3x6
computer
sticker
and
a
vast
array
of
minifig
tools
and
equipment
though
i
have
some
plans
to
modify
the
building
and
make
it
larger
but
have
never
gotten
around
to
doing
it
thanks
for
this
great
review
baby
i
like
the
clarity
of
your
photos
and
the
description
is
well
written
ill
try
and
see
if
i
can
gather
the
money
for
this
one
fingers
crossed
luxorv
thanks
for
the
really
cool
review
baby
i
think
this
is
an
awesome
first
attemp
for
your
first
review
it
flows
well
really
good
pics
and
many
pics
in
the
set
i
think
this
is
a
good
purchase
i
will
buy
it
when
it
comes
out
in
the
us
and
i
think
it
is
cool
looking
and
the
fuctions
look
neat

thanks
for
the
pics
so
far
will
you
have
highres
pics
of
the
other
sets
in
the
instructions
they
have
made
a
special
middle
piece
in
this
4
set
httpwwwbricksetaspxset70751
the
only
problem
is
that
its
red
right
so
heres
my
review
finally
the
whole
gallery
of
box
parts
minifigs
and
finished
model
is
here
over
2
pages
so
on
with
the
show
minifigs
httpwwwbrickshelycgii1340864
in
the
set
you
get
krakaroff
i
dunno
how
to
spell
it
and
victor
krum
the
figs
are
exactly
the
same
bar
their
heads
these
are
two
fantastic
figures
the
expression
on
krakaroffs
face
is
priceless
judging
by
the
design
i
think
we
might
get
a
yellow
krakaroff
cropping
up
somewhere
which
would
make
me
a
happy
bunny
hed
make
a
fantastic
viking
ideally
id
have
liked
more
than
2
figures
for
my
money
three
would
have
done
it
i
think
2
is
too
few
piece
count
httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344573
httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344571
httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344572
for
a
40
set
the
piece
count
is
quiet
good
i
dont
know
the
exact
number
but
when
building
it
i
didnt
feel
short
changed
bar
the
exception
of
the
hull
now
i
dont
hate
the
hull
my
problem
is
that
is
doesnt
connect
with
bricks
like
the
old
pirate
ships
there
are
pros
and
cons
to
this
on
the
plus
side
its
more
secure
and
your
whole
ship
doesnt
need
to
be
taken
up
with
support
structure
the
negative
side
being
you
cant
really
make
it
bigger
as
theyve
only
released
a
megablocking
4
set
with
the
right
piece
and
its
the
wrong
color
i
also
like
how
its
wide
meaning
you
can
fit
loads
of
minifigs
on
the
main
deck
overall
though
i
liked
the
pieces
of
note
are
gold
studs
httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344510
5
in
total
you
get
one
spare
the
return
of
the
black
falcon
shields
httpwwwbrickshelycgii1340835
and
the
new
drumstrang
shields
the
construction
a
simple
fun
build
nothing
too
fiddly
the
finished
model
httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344474
big
picture
i
really
like
this
set
theres
no
bones
about
it
it
seems
lego
with
the
latter
half
of
2005
have
given
people
who
loved
their
original
pirate
ships
hope
for
the
future
with
this
and
the
fantastic
viking
longboat
even
with
the
two
4
pieces
the
hull
and
front
of
the
ship
i
wasnt

the
front
of
the
ship
is
a
nice
piece
and
can
be
used
for
stuff
like
castles

and
the
hull
isnt
all
bad
what
i
really
liked
was
the
little
cargo
hold
at
the
moment
i
have
a
treasure
chest
in
there
but
there
space
for
about
eight
of
them
i
reckon
playability
wise
it
does
make
alot
of
sense
and
as
you
can
see
you
can
imprision
minifigs
below
deck

the
quarters
are
great
as
well
you
can
comfortably
fit
about
six
minifigs
in
the
main
gally
three
by
the
steering
wheel
and
a
couple
up
above
the
top
cabin
you
could
fit
more
but
itd
look
strange
my
only
gripe
is
the
design
of
the
top
cabin
when
you
want
to
open
it
up
you
have
to
remove
the
mast
i
know
its
simple
enough
but
i
think
that
it
wouldnt
have
taken
much
for
tlc
to
design
it
better
but
saying
that
its
easily
done
and
i
like
how
the
cabin
can
be
lifted
with
ease
from
the
steering
deck
httpwwwbrickshelycgii1344540
the
final
play
feature
is
the
plank
you
can
while
away
the
hours
murdering
hapless
minifigs
whove
displeased
the
cabin
a
really
nice
addition
for
pirate
fans
the
final
verdictb

for

a

let
down
a

by
lack
of
minifigs
and
the
cons
of
the
hull
boverall

overall
this
is
a
set
worth
getting
especially
if
you
miss
proper
pirates
it
wouldnt
take
much
to
turn
this
into
an
amazing
pirate
ship
moc
hope
you

love

great

this
really
is
a

for

hopefully
therell
be
the

level
of
usefulness
in
the
others
thanks
for
taking

it
up
did
you
scan

i

this

so
it
was
a
great
buy
it
follow
with
a
similar
build
to
the
2007
trucks
but
has
a
few
improvements
of
course
the

the

minifig
you
build
is
a
simple

parts
here
we
have
some
interesting
and
new
parts
they
include
a

1x2

with

and
a
1x4

build
cargo1
the
first
cargo
palette
has
a
few
crates
on
it
i
really
like
the
sticker
on
the
small
box
forklift
the
forklift
is
a
very
fun
extra
to
build
and
it
is
probably
the
best
forklift
that
we
have
had
so
far
it
is
very
realistic
and
is
very
strong
cargo2
the
next
piece
of
cargo
is
some
octan
barrels
on
a
meter
i
am
not
sure
what
it
is
supposed
to
be
but
it
is
still
a
nice
addition
to
the
set
minifgure2
the
second
minifigure
is
a
classic
driver
with
sunglasses
and
a
coffee
mug
very
nice
new
piece
this
is
a
very
nice
new
piece
that
is
included
in
the
set
a
hollow
canopy
i
believe
it
is
also
in
white
with
the
police
mobile
command
station
truck
now
anyone
who
has
had
one
of
the
lego
city
harbor
sets
from
last
year
then
you
will
probably
find
this
build
to
be
very
similar
mostly
in
the
cab
part
of
the
truck
the
trucks
build
is
very
solid
and
very
realistic
i
sense
ths
will
bring
the
ratings
up
quite
a
bit
mystery
cargo
for
some
time
specualtion
has
been
going
around
what
exactly
is
this
it
seems
like
nuero
poison
i
am
very
happy
with
those
2x2
cylinders
in
transyellow
in
fact
you
can
join
in
and
guess
what
it
may
be
in
this
topic
containers
the
first
container
is
built
to
hold
one
palette
it
fits
onto
the
truck
it
produces
a
very
pleasing
result
and
has
a
better
look
to
it
than
the
containers
from
last
year
had
the
second
container
has
the
ability
to
hold
two
palettes
and
has
a
design
similar
to
the
first
then
you
build

it

aslo
like
this
due
to
the
fact
that
it
has
some
really
nice
parts
it
has
a
great
build
and
utilizes
some
awesome
new

thanksfor
this
review
i
also
got
this
set
recently
and
im
very
happy
about
it
i
live
the
design
of
these
new
trucks
and
the
forklift
is
also
great
not
to
forget
the
good
amount
of
cargo
btw
i
think
the
mysterious
cargo
only
are
normal
fuel
barrels
a
very
fine
set
indeed
and
something
at
least
a
little
different
to
the
more
usual
city
sets
sweet
and
it
could
even
be
a
little
sweeter
to
me
with

i
ask
whats
so
special
about
the
special
edition
hmmgood
question
lets
hope
our
reviewer
can
help
us
out
here
that
explains
why
it
isnt
in
our
local
stores
i
also
got
it
from
sh
but
my
box
hasnt
got
the
special
edition
printing
on
it
surprisingly
nice
review
vbbn
i
stumbled
upon
your
yellow
seat
as
well
didn
´
t
you
have
one
already
or
what
made
you
think
it
´
s
new
the
big
letdown
on
this
set
is
the
big
canopy
i
would
have
preferred
single
bricks
for
that
and
for
this
truck
there
is
no
real
need
for
a
hollow
canopy
it
could
as
well
have
been
made
of
solid
bricks
maybe
we
get
another
set
with
different
use
of
the
canopy
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
i
didn
´
t
buy
it
so
far
and
i
´
m
especially
not
interested
in
another
forklift
i
have
plenty
of
those
i
agree
it
´
s
the
best
one
we
have
seen
so
far
though
nice
work
vbbn
im
not
really
into
technic
myself
but
youve
definately
done
a
fine
review
on
this
set
funny
that
it
actually
fits
a
minifig
perhaps
well
see
fans
design
forklifts
with
technic
and
having
it
minifig
sized
as
ive
told
you
before
this
is
a
great
set
and
now
it
has
a
great
review
thanks
for
this
a
very
original
and
perhaps
even
a
little
weird
design
indeed
but
nice
and
creative
for
sure
thanks
for
that
good
review
thanks
for
the
review
ill
add
it
to
the
index
the
ywing
is
one
of
my
favourite
rebel
fighters

this

the

more

at

and
for
about
the

i
think
the
imperial
landing
craft
ilc
is
much
superior
to
the
ywing
the
ywing
does
n't
have
much
functionality
besides
an
awkward

and
a
moving

the

the

i
've
built
the
ilc
first
so
i
got
quite
disappointed
with
the
ywing
youve
got
to
be
kidding
the
ilc
is
bulky
and
doesnt
even
come
close
to
the
design

of
the

i

it
is
a
fair
to

here
with
the

i
came
here
to
look
at
the

even
though
it
is
a

no

bummer
id
like
to
see
a
more

tolerance
on
dated
threads
being
bumped
again
we
know
next
to
nothing
about
the
new
ywing
it
wouldnt
be
possible
to
say
whether
7658
is
worth
the
money
relative
to
the
new
one
until
we
know
what
the
new
one
looks
like
what
its

look

how

cost

am
said
not
a
threat
at
all
i
was
simply
pointing
out
that
yodalikespie
made
the
mistake
of
inquiring
about
the
new
ywing
before
we
had
any
information
on
it
to
my
understanding
its
not
so
much
the
fact
that
he
bumped
the
thread
as
the
fact
that
he
bumped
it
for
no
good
reason
im
not
certain
where
the
moderators
stand
on
this
issue
but
i
feel
that
yodalikespies
question
would
have
been
better
received
had
he
posed
it
after
a
substantial
amount
of
information
had
been
gathered
on
9495
as
ive
said
there
simply
isnt
much
one
can
go
off
of
at
this
point
to
determine
its
value
relative
to
7658
roger
that
sad
that
the
original
review
pics
arent
available
any
longer
would
be
nice
once
the
new
set
is
released
for
comparisons
nice
review
and
i
especially
enjoyed
the
ending
i
personally
think
it
is
quite
a
good
set
for
the
price
considering
it
comes
with
a
fully
armed
minifig
along
with
enough
stuff
to
suit
up
another
i
just
wish
amazon
carried
this
set
finaly
we
get
a
new

for
takeshi
and
yes
its

it
brings

the

also
included
is
the
mini

his
is
a
very
neat
little
guy
but
sadly
he
doesnt
really
become
a
weapon
more
of
a
block
of
red
and
black
bricks
the
torso
now
the
torso
design
for
assault
tiger
is
very
different
from
the
past
years
it
now
uses
a
castlelike
piece
as
the
main
structure
also
of
note
is
that
he
has
a
mini
throne
no
controls
sadly
and
with
the
orange
cockpit
piece
its
impossible
to
see
takeshi
when
looking
at
the
at
close
on
see
the
third

the
legs
the
legs
are
slightly
similar
to
the
mt201
ultra
drill
walkers
but
have
been
modified
to
fit
the
at
they
are
quite
large
and
suit
their
purpose
the
arms
the
arms
follow
a

the
only

is
they
have

b
assault
tiger
is
a

some
of
those
small

take
a

i

am
thanks
for
that
good
review
vbbn
that
´
s
really
a
fine
and
pretty
solid
looking
mecha
i
think
that
the
designers
did
a
good
job
on
this
last
wave
of
ef
sets
and
the
inclusion
of
these
mini
robots
was
also
a
pretty
smart
idea
nice
to
see
a
well
done
review
this
set
is
one
of
the
few
exoforce
sets
i
havent
built
myself
yet
but
i
will
get
it
on
sale
guess
soon
im
do
not
like
the
use
of
slizerstyle
balljoints
in
exoforce
even
though
they
are
modified
to
2x2
bricks
in
this
particular
set
i
think
the
arms
look
weak
and
they
lack
elbow
joint
like
the
green
2008
mech
set
forgot
name
of
this
years
green
mech
quite
a
shame
i
find
it
really
hurts
the
functionality
of
that
green
set
and
could
imagine
the
same
with
the
tiger
i
guess
with
the
new
pyramide
brick
as
cockpit
the
cockpit
is
still
open
from
the
sides
and
the
back
i
modified
my
green
2008
mech
which
use
the
same
cockpit
design
with
a
few
green
bricks
and
it
is
now
completely
closed
from
all
sides
i
rate
the
tiger
at
average
but
i
may
change
my
mind
when
i
get
to
build
it
myself
front
this
was
my
first
exo
force
set
and
i
was
quite
skeptical
towards
the
mecha
theme
so
i
got
it
because
it
seemed
to
have
nice
parts
it
turned
out
however
that
the
mechas
are
quite
nice
i
really
like
the
poseability
of
it
and
since
then
i
got
another
ef
set
the
assult
tiger
is
pretty
cool
i
just
bought
2
of
them
since
they
were
5
each
from
lego
i
really
wish
they
did
not
cancel
this
series
kimt
on
aug
29 2008 0655
am
said
best
impulse
set
so
far
agreed
i
love
this
little
sets
i
cant
wait
for
it
to
hit
shops
here
the
rodent
problem
is
funny
but
i
lov
always
getting
more
animals
so
that
is
a
plus
the
cart
is
a
nicely
formidable
machine
that
i
will
keep
together
so
i
can
maximise
their
fire
power
the
troll
figure
is
one
of
my
favourite
ever
too
i
love
that
torso
and
helmet
and
i
want
that
sword
in
grey
i
only
have
it
in
bronze
thanks
for
the
review
batbrick
away
im
not
really
impressed
by
this
set
as
much
as
other
impulse
sets
the
knight
impulse
set
5615
offers
more
in
my
opinion
since
it
gives
two
helmets
two
weapons
a
shield
and
an
armor
piece
along
with
the
weapon
rack
im
not
a
fan
in
the
slightest
of
flickfire
missles
and
projectiles
like
on
the
cart
and
the
previously
mentioned
one
piece
axle
limits
the
wheel
usage
in
other
mocs
i
wouldve
liked
to
see
an
added
chest
armor
piece
at
the
very
least
and
a
shield
wouldve
made
this
great
those
things
are
so
rare
and
it
wouldve
bumped
the
piece
count
up
to
21
to
match
the
knight
set
since
both
are
showing
the
same
price
on
shin
us
dollars
at
least
it
wouldve
made
sense
more

with

i
did

interestingly
an

and
not
other

you
might
like
to
buy
the
contents
of
the

looks
much
like
every
other
impulse

firefighter
not
sure
there
's
much
else
to
say
apart
from
i
wish
they
'd
included
breathing
equipment
looking
pretty
pleased
with
himself
if
you
ask
me
the
equipment
rack
is
fairly
standard
and
easy
to
build
it
does
however
include
a
fire
hydrant
inbuild
shot
will
i
be
able
to
finish
this
complex
build
unsurprisingly
i
did
i
nice
selection
of
kit
is
provided
all
together
i
think
the
fire
is
a
bit
odd
but
it
does
add
playability
if
you
want
to
increase
the
number
of
your
firefighter
and
their
equipment
this
is
a
great
way
though
there
is
something
missing
in
my
mind
the
rating
system
figures
510
fairly
standard
i
already
have
a
fair
few
parts
610
good
selection
of
tools
but
lacks
the
breathing
apparatus
i
'd
expect
in
a
set
like
this
fun

510
there
's
clearly
something
to
do
even
if
you
just
own
this
set
design
510
not
going
to
win
any
awards
but
it
's
robust
price

nothing
to
complain
about
you
get
a
lot
of
accessories
for
the
price
grand
total
2950
reasonable
design
and
good

a
good
set
to
improve
any
fire
department
conclusion
this
is
n't
a
set
i
'd
necessarily
buy
but
while
i
was
at
bluewater
today
i
decided
i
should
try
to
review
every
impulse
set
myself
so
that
why
i
bought
it
still
i
think
it
has
some
good
playability
and
a
good
set
of
accessories
if
you
need
more
firefighting
kit
i
just
ca
n't
get
passed
the
lack
of
breaking
apparatus
that
would
have
made
it
a
better
set
in
my
view
quote
if
you
want
to
increase
the
number
of
your
firefighter
and
their
equipment
this
is
a
great
way
though
there
is
something
missing
in
my
mind
whats
missing
nice
review
and
quite
funny
now
ill
never
turn
my
back
on
a
robot
again
poor
set
i
find
this
set
bad
even
for
an
impulse
the
robot
is
poorly
designed
and
without
any
use
the
space
minifig
is
ok
id
rather
get
another
impulse
set
than
this
except
the
other

was

that
i

i
had

what

could

was

the
instructions
for
the

they

in

the
stars
of
the

batman
is
back
with
a
new

much
more
metalic
than
before
harley
had
all
new
printed
torso
legs
a
new
head
and
that
sweet
new
hat
batcycle
the
bottom
part
is
very
sturdy
thanks
to
a
small
bit
of
technic
the
red
throws
it
off
a
bit
but
it
isnt
seen
once
the
top
part
is
put
on
it
has
a
nice
use
of
the
smoke
stacks
and
looks
very
nice
in
the
end
the
top
part
is
simple
but
suits
the
purpose
well
it
has
handle
bars
and
a
nice
motor
the
blue
is
a
little
strange
though
hammer
truck
the
hammer
truck
begins
with
a
very
sturdy
base
it
has
lots
of
detail
and
really
looks
cool
rims
added
lego
did
a
very
nice
job
at
giving
it
a
checker
board
appearence
the
only
problem
here
is
that
you
stick
a
sticker
over
two
bricks
multiple
times
jewels
inside
of
the
crate
are
these
shining
jewels
look
how
they
illuminate
the
darkness
in
gotham
more
added
then
we
add
on
a
spoiler
and
the
crate
looking
very
nice
now
the
detail
is
again
outstanding
and
it
has
a
good
amount
of
smoothness
to
it
the
infamous
hammer
okay
i
havent
said
this
yet
but
the
square
pieces
need
to
stop
first
on
those
sw
backta
tanks
now
on
the
hammer
it
creates
a
sloppy
look
for
the
hammer
still
this
is
the
ultimate
wacking
weapon
added
to
the
truck
on
the
truck
it
works
pretty
well
but
the
handle
is
to
short
and
its
near
impossible
to
smash
batman
the
finished
truck
the
finished
truck
is
really
nice
the
big
wheels
give
it
the
monster
truck
feel
and
the
way
that
lego
alternated
the
colors
works
well
the
cockpit
is
a
little
palin
but
thats
not
a
major
issue
the
i
love
joker
sticker
is
one
of
the
best
stickers
ive
seen
its
simply
a
classic
the
finished

lots

set
7886
is
a
very
nice
set
and
has
some
great
details
in
it
the
minifigs
are
very
cool
as
well
however
their
are
some
flaws
first
the
hammer
is
two
short
and
is
kind
of
square
the
batcycle
has
a
few
awkward
colors
in
it
which
throws
it
off
a
bit
this
set
is
definatly
worth
the
money
batman
fans
will
love
it
and
also
wacking
fans
will
like
it
for
that
hammer
and

small
remark

can
make
sure
it
isnt
going

disappear
in

near

i
keep
looking
at
this
set
to
buy
since
i
have
3
10
cards
now
maybe
i
will
go
pick
it
up

great
review
erdbeeries

have
to

i
have
thought
about
this
set
long
and
hard
and
your
review
might
just
force
me
to
pick
it
up
the
vehicles

makes
you
wonder
if
there
was
some
kind
of
promo
or
hookup
in
the
pipeline
that
never
happened
i
have
this
set
and
i
really
like
it
it
works
well
with
either
the
new
city
sets
or
with
my
older
1980s1990s
sets
i
actually
like
the
use
of
the
old
style
car
base
and
mourned
the
day
that
these
became
exitinct
the
first
time
round
c1990
thanks
for
the
review
cheers
rog
its
an
ok
set
i
just
dont
really
like
the
look
of
the
van
much
too
rounded
for
my
liking
what
happened
to
the
box
like
cars
thanks
for
that
very
nice
review
erdbeereis1
it
´
s
great
to
see
some
other
city
sets
beside
the
usual
hospital
police
and
firefighter
mayhem
and
this
is
a
really
nice
little
one
now
give
me
some
car
doors
and
a
kevin
costnerlike
mf
and
i
´
m
a
happy
camper
indeed
tlc
i
do
like
the
set
also
ive
bought
2
of
them
one
to
build
it
up
and
one
to
keep
it
misb
i
dunno
for
how
long
only
poor
things
is
that
the
wheels
are
too
wide
car
is
5nops
wide
instead
of
4
afterall
a
good
design
i
wonder
if
theres
a
post
office
coming
soon
by
the
way
great
review
i
am
not
a
fan
of
citytowntrainstuff
but
this
is
a
very
good
review
that
almost
makes
me
wish
i
had
the
time
read
money
to
purchase
some
of
the
coastguard
sets
thanls
for
the
review
i
was
looking
at
this
set
last
time
i
went
to
the
lego
store
but
in
the
end
decided
not
to
get
it
now
you
've
made
me
really
doubt
my
decision
one
question
though
do
you
think
the
jet
ski
is
as
good
as
previous
ones
rriggs
on

am
said
you
do
get
a
piece
call
out
with
this
set
i
did
anyway
its
on
the
back
of
the
small
poster
that
is
included
in
the
set
i
meant
the
piece
call
outs
during
the
build
that
show
which
pieces
you
need
for
that
step
and
cardinal
brick
im
not
quite
sure
what
you
mean
but
i
cetainly
think
that
this
jetski
is
wonderful
it
gets
placed
on
top
of
this
piece
arrgh
me
hearties
lets
join
the
pirates
as
they
try
to
steal
the
sacred
treasure
from
the

hands
it
wont
be
easy
king
kahuka
and
his
loyal
warriors

treasure

unfortunately
i

because
i

the
idea
of
spending
over

for
a
set
with
under
200
pieces
so
sorry
no
box
pics
instructions
i
think
the
image
on
the
front
is
very
good
it
seems
less
setup
somehow
than
the
instructions
these
days
it
looks
more
like
someone
snuck
up
on
them
while
they
were
going
about
their
duties
and
snapped
away
rather
than
something
that
was
planned
the
parts
a
nice
selection
here
there
is
a
pretty
good
amount
of
printed
pieces
in
this
set
which
is
always
nice
for
example
the
zebra
print
tile
as
well
as
the
pirate
flag
nowadays
would
almost
certainly
be
stickered
the
set
also
comes
with
a
nice
dark
grey
burp
and
a
red
boat
for
the
pirates
the
minifigs
the
main
buying
point
of
this
set
for
me
were
the
minifigs
this
set
comes
with
5
of
them
which
is
quite
good
for
a
small
set
like
this
especially
when
compared
to
the
sets
of
today
the
set
comes
with
1
alligator
2
pirates
2
islander
warriors
and
king
kahuka
himself
i
really
like
the
islanders
torso
and
leg
prints
the
leafy
skirts
are
a
nice
touch
and
the
makeup
on
the
faces
is
superb
some
parts
i
liked
these
shields
have
a
nice
design
on
them
and
i
always
like
the
treasure
chests
a
picture
inside
the
manual
this
is
a
feature
that
i
liked
in
the
manual
it
shows
an
overhead
view
of
the
baseplate
so
its
much
easier
to
find
where
to
put
the
piece
i
certainly
could
have
used
this
feature
in
last
years
aquabase
invasion
set
a
closeup
of
the
king
the
face
print
is
nice
i
wonder
who
kahukas
makeup
artist
is
the
finished
set
first
the
pirates
boat
the
boat
is
really
nice
the
sail
is
made
out
of
a
nice
cloth
and
connects
simply
to
the
mast
and
now
the
main
part
of
the
set
the
throne
this
is
a
really
nice
model
i
think
the
colors
and
the
design
make
it
really
feel
like
a
different
part
of
the
lego
world
the
rock
sculpture
looks
fantastic
as
well
the
throne
which
is
sort
of
a
stretcher
thing
attaches
here
it
connects
on
a
1x2
tile
with
a
stud
in
the
middle
for
easy
removal
here
is
the
treasure
that
the
pirates
seek
the
treasure
rests
on
tiles
inside
of
the
rock
the
zebra
print
tribal
drum
this
is
simple
but
nice
one
thing
thats
great
about
this
which
i
mentioned
earlier
is
that
this
and
all
of
the
other
pieces
with
designs
on
them
are
printed
thats
right
no
stickers
to
be
found
here
i
have
used
these
zebraprint
tiles
many
times
for
mocs
as
they
make
a
great
exotic
detail
piece
the
lovely
rock
head
i
think
this
is
wonderful
it
really
adds
a
lot
to
the
set
it
is
well
built
with
grey
slopes
curved
pieces
for
the
mouth
and
nose
headlight
bricks
for
the
eyes
and
feathers
and
horns
for
detail
the
backside
the
complete
set
overall
this
looks
great
in
my
opinion
with
great
landscaping
and
some
fun
parts
well
it
looks
like
the
pirates
walked
all
over
the
islanders
and
stole
their
treasure
in
fact
it
looks
like
it
was
pretty
brutal
brickshelf
folder
now
for
the
the
ratings
price
810
for
17
not
a
great
price
per
piece
value
but
when
you
add
5
figs
in
it
makes
it
a
decent
price
plus
this
set
hasnt
been
in
stores
for
14
years
so
that
adds
some
cost
parts
910
the
set
has
some
really
nice
printed
parts
as
well
as
a
baseplate
which
in
my
opinion
is
great
design
910
no
flaws
that
i
can
think
of
right
away
the
rock
face
is
very
well
built
playability
810
not
really
anything
to
play
with
although
you
can
sail
the
ship
and
steal
the
treasure
build
910
rock
face
uses
nice
techniques
and
the
rest
of
the
set
is
simple
but

it
looks
like
the
pirates
have
picked
up
a
new
recruit
from
the
island
summary
the
older
lego
sets
have
a
really
different
look
to
them
than
the
new
sets
and
i
think
its
nice
to
have
a
mix
of
new
and
old
this
is
definitely
a
great
set
with
a
nice
build
and
great
minifigs
add
to
this
the
great
printed
pieces
and
that
old
pirate
charm
and
you
get
a
very
nice
set
that
i
can
certainly
recommend
thanks

happy

am
as
ive
already
said
somewhere
on
this
forum
this
is
the
largest
islander
set
i
own
and
therefore
my
favourite
thankyou
for
your
great
review
i
picked
mine
up
for
only
5
pounds
along
with
crocodile
cage
and
king
kahuka
but
i
cant
help
you
with
the
original
price
i
would
search
the
web
but
im
too
tired
right
now
i
feel
the
same
way
about
the
islanders
sets
brickster
they
are
a
nice
change
from
the
regular
pirate
versus
soldiers
that
is
the
norm
i
think
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
some
new
islanders
sets
released
in
the
new
pirate
line
to
see
how
tlc
would
make
them
excellent
review
i
want
this
set
now
an
outstanding
set
too
bad
that
i
couldnt
get
this
set
set
when
it
came
out
i
do
not
like
the
fact
that
the
clones
have
pure
white
legs
it
looks
weird
to
me
it
was
also
weird
that
they
included
shock
troopers
but
it
was
probably
a
way
to
get
people
to
buy
it
this
set
also
seems
like
one
of
those
that
was
kind
of
thrown
in
with
a
mix
of
other
sets
like
the
tie
crawler
i
never
picked
it
up
and
with
the
new
clone
wars
sets
out
i
wont
stauder

anyone
noticed
the

includes
the
3rd

both
in

position
as
well
as
the
raised
one
stauder
its
not
the

its

zoom

take
a
closer
look
technic
rotation
joint

list
its
used
in
10
different
sets
so
far
not
exactly
a
new
piece
a
nice
review
with
many
good
comments
i
really
like
this
set
its
one
of
the
walkers
with
really
good
design
and
a
lot
of
playability
its
the
usual
issue
of
using
too
many
technic
pieces
to
make
a
moveable
feature
versus
minifigscaled
design
the
same
issue
concerns
for
example
the
atat
the
twilight
and
the
atte
plus
more
sets
what
annoys
me
in
this
set
is
the
use
of
the
2
tan
4x8
plates
they
stick
out
and
it
would
have
been
better
if
they
the
designers
had
used
dark
grey
or
light
grey
plates
also
ill
add
this
to
the
inventory
now
i
like
this
set
but
i
dont
like
the
pure
white
legs
for
the
shock
troopers
it
looked
better
with
the
black
leg
joint
piece
i
also
think
the
set
looks
like
half
an
atte
did
anyone
encounter
the
problem
with
the
main
turret
apparently
the
very
tip
of
the
piece
cone
shape
cant
be
put
onto
the
pole
piece
i
check
the
instructions
2
times
and
still
cant
find
what
im
doing
wrong
is
it
just
me
or
did
anyone
else
got
this
problem
as
well

having

with

as

i
forget
how
the
instructions
look
though
but
the
bar
not
fitting
in
the
cone
sounds
familiar
i
just
checked
mine
and
what
i
did
was
i
took
the
red
bar
and
stuck
it
into
the
round
piece
with
the
fins
and
then
attached
the
cone
to
the
stud
on
top
of
the
round
part
worked
fine
for
me

the

the

minifig
in
all
of
legoland
he
is
a
master
of

can

with

he

unfortunately
i

in

smushed
in

on

so
needless
to
say
it
was
not

the

the

is
an
extremely
small

the

on

there
is
a

of
some
of
the
2008
impulse

this
is
a
nice
feature
the
parts
for
an
impulse
set
this
has
a
pretty
good
selection
a
very
nice
owl
and
an
interesting
clear
ball
piece
all
built
this
set
took
me
forever
to
build
i
had
to
take
numerous
breaks
as
it
was
the
toughest
longest
build
i
have
ever
faced
for
an
impulse
set
this
actually
looks
pretty
good
the
owl
perch
is
nice
also
the
crystal
ball
table
the
wizard
is
a
very
nice
fig
with
great

on
the
legs
and
hat

i

good
review
for
a
simple
set
while
it
does
come
with
the
basics
for
an
impulse
set
i
just
feel
that
it
lacks
something
though
i
am
not
sure
what
perhaps
a
printed
magic
scroll
i
am
still
not
a
fan
of
the
printed
cap
especially
the
stars
but
i
do
like
the
printed
pants
displaying
his
various
goodies
hanging
from
his
belt
the
plain
torso
is
to
be
expected
from
a
wizard
minifig
i
suppose
overall
its
not
a
bad
set

it
certainly
feels
to
be

as

outside

it

at

set
that
cost
a
lot
more
than
this
one
now
for
what
$
™
s
inside
the
contents
of
the

the
impulse

never
look
that
inspiring
now
for
the
alien
i
have
to
say
i
$
™
m
not
impressed
i
$
™
m
not
a
big
space
fan
and
i
only
bought
this
due
to
my
impulse
review
challenge
but
as
the
main
point
of
the
impulse
sets
is
the
alien
is
a
little
hard
to
build
a
good
set
round
something
with
one
point
or
articulation
it
lacks
what
make
lego
minfigs
so
great
their
articulation
now
for
the
space
vehicle
as
always
with
impulse
a
short
and
easy
build
ensues
took
maybe
2
mins
at
the
most
time
to
mount
the
alien
in
his
craft
the
craft
looks
a
little
wide
for
him
slightly
better
from
this
angle
but
still
not
winning
any
awards
i
$
™
m
disappointed
of
the
impulse
sets
i
$
™
ve
reviewed
so
far
this
is
clearly
the
weakest
of
them
but
what
really
disappointing
is
the

useful

in

i
$

m
annoyed
from
the
outside
of
the
box
this
set
looks
quite
interesting
and
certainly
appears
to
be
well
designed
the
idea
of
a
small
alien
fighterflying
craft
is
in
my
opinion
a
good
one
but
sadly
when
you
$
™
ve
got
the
finished
product
in
your
hand
it
looks
nothing
like
the
box
art
while
i
think
mission
mars
had
some
interesting
sets
and
i
might
still
get
some
of
them
this
one
will
not
be
a
repeat
purchase
for
me
worst
set
of
the
year
worst
set
of
all
time
the
pictures
say
it
all
no

necessary
a
waste

the
little
alien
ship
that
comes

beats
this
one
hands
down
as
well
as
any
other
lego
spaceship
i
have
ever
seen
and
i
have
seen
many
thankfully
this

isnt
available
in
my
country
which
is
something
i
never
thought
i
would
say
anyway
i
hope
tlg
makes
these
awful
jelly
aliens
disappear
forever
after
this
year
thanks
for
the
review
considering
the
price
i
give
it
below
average
i
didnt
buy
any
of
the
space
impulse
sets
as
i
dont
think
they
are
good
value
thanks
for
the
review
the

minifig
sets
were
great
as
they
gave
a
nice
variety

men
id
love
this
one
nice
set
lucky
you
the
only
reason
i
buy
the

is
lack
of
good

minifig
packs
like
this
nowadays
thanks
for
sharing
this
review
with
us
i
think
this
one
of
the
sets
in
europe
this
thing
is
waaaay
overpriced
and
thus
makes
it
a
crappy
set
we
pay
nearly
double
the
us
price
so
i
rated
it
poor
also
because
the
figs
included
does
not
make
it
great
the
hailfire
is
well
designed
and
looks
great
but
thats
just
about
all
there
is
worthy
of
a
positive
mentioning
sorry
on
a
side
note
as
a

wheres
the

the

the

are

that

the

that
the

now
have
holes
in

allowing

to

in

lego
introduced
a
new
theme
called
arctic
it
was
something
completely
new
and
different
for
lego
as
no
minifig
scale
sets
andor
adventurers
had
ever
ventured
to
the
arctic
the
set
offered
new
orange
pieces
and
combined
elements
of
blue
and
white
pieces
to
provide
a
number
of
sleds
vehicles
a
mobile
outpost
6520
and
even
a
large
polar
base
6575
the
theme
was
unfortunately
short
lived
and
did
not
see
2001
this
particular
set
is
a
value
pack
that
combines
sets
6578
polar
explorer
and
6586
polar
scout
at
a
reasonable
price
of
10
usd
i
may
have
even
paid
a
few
dollars
less
at
a
discount
toy
store
back
in
the
early
2000s
a
picture
of
the
bonus
pack
with
the
two
sets
combined
within
the
box
the
backside
features
an
advertisement
for
the
lego
club
and
pictures
of
other
arctic
sets
starting
with
the
smaller
set
the
polar
explorer
just
a
tip
of
the
iceberg
instructions
front
of
box
back
of
box
both
sets
include
the
same
minifig
an
arctic
fig
with
glasses
and
a
thick
arctic
coat
heres
a
shot
of
the
fig
with
his
hood
on
i
always
thought
the
hood
is
a
nice
piece
that
would
work
well
for
hoth
rebel
snow
scenes
the
set
includes
a
few
nice
accessories
the
set
actually
creates
a
small
icesnow
formation
that
can
even
be
placed
on
water
to
represent

i
really
like
the

imagery
on
the
backside
the
set
includes
a
small
sheet
of
decals
included
are
some
great
arctic
accessories
and
some
interesting
arctic
creatures
like
this
neon
orange
scorpion
in
a
ball
of
ice
i
love
the
polar
bear
a
great
addition
to
snow
scenes
but
the
best
part
of
this
set
is
the
orange
and
black
sled
the
back
sled
attachment
uhaul
has
some
tools
and
a
removable
storage
cover
the
top
comes
off
easy
to
store
tools
and

heres
the
arctic
fig
with
a
great
metal
detector
or
other
snow
research
device
and
the
sled
itself
lastly
a

of

final
thoughts
im
a
little
disappointed
that
arctic
was
a
shortlived
theme
at
the
time
i
wasnt
too
interested
in
the
arctic
but
i
still
regret
not
buying
the
large
polar
research
base
after
seeing
it
at
a
discounted
price
i
was
able
to
pick
up
this
set
and
the
mobile
outpost
that
i
never
opened
id
be
interesting
in
reading
your
thoughts
in
regard
to
this
set
and
the
arctic
theme
i
like
the
theme
very
much
but
sadly
i
dont
own
any
sets
of
it
it
brings
such
a
great
feeling
its
fresh
and
has
great
parts
and
sets
and
it
brought
the
polar
bear
your
review
is
very
good
and
informative
thanks
i
voted
wrong
i
meant

average
but
i

hi
great
review
on
one
of
my
favourite
themes
i
never
realized
how
cool
it
was
until
just
now
when
you
did
your
review
anyways
i
remember
my
one
set
of
the
arctict
expedition
the
arctic
expedition
pack
a
nice
set
review
as
for
the
theme
itself
i
though
it
was
a
very
interesting
theme
sadly
i
do
n't
think
lego
put
enough
effort
into
it
i
was
personally
upset
not
to
se
a
second
year
even
if
i
did
n't
buy
any
of
the
sets
it
reminds
me
of
the
artic
theme
playmobil
did
at
one
point
in
the
distant
past
to
be
honest
i
think
a
number
of
good
artic
scenes
were
missed
when
it
came
out
a
really
wanted
to
get
a
ski
plane
but
it
never
came
i
built
it
myself
in
the
end
but
i
do
n't
know
how
lego
missed
that
one
on
a
slightly
random
note
i
do
know
that
at
least
one
lego
minifig
did
make
it
all
the
way
to
the
real
artic
with
a
research
team
sadly
i
do
n't
have
any
pictures
to
offer
you
i
find
it
amusing
that
the
numbers
on
the
decal
for
the
flag
were
chosen
so
that
it
wouldnt
look
stupid
if
you
put
it
on
upsidedown
by
accident

and
lets
just
take
a
moment
to
get
sentimental
a
year
ago
today
staudie
had
a
lame
idea
interview
the
members
of
eb
he
flailed
around
with
it
for
a
few
interviews
including
the
infamous
one
where
hinck
attention
whored
sinner
into
a
corner
and
sinner
were
featured
reprising
their
roles
from
the
whacker
and
the
walrus
it
was
quite
memorable
but
then
a
short
time
later
someone
new
joined
the
team
bringing
it
to
a
new
level
of
polish
and
bad
jokes
still
this
tribute
isnt
dedicated
to
that
genius
of
the
written
word
nay
its
dedicated
to
the
whole
staff
including
the
new
guy
who
is
still
a
secret
so
dont
bother
asking
im
not
telling
ha
i
salute
you
eb
news
its
been
a
damn
fine
year
that
is
some
fine
history
from
the

i
wonder
how
staudie
can
keep
up
with
his
sanity
asking

well
look
at
that
youve
been
blogged
this
is
a
very
good
review
no
doubt
about
it
about
this
set
this
is
a
cheap
way
to
buy
this
set
with
a
witch
and
some
nifty
accessories
such
as
the
black
cat
in
fact
i
think
this
is
the
first
time
i
had
ever
seen
a
black
cat
its
simple
but
not
very
useful
in
my
collection
because
other
fright
knight
sets
also
offer
the
witches
too
i
dont
need
many
witches
overall
i
feel
that
this
is
an
average
set
outstanding
this
is
as
many
of
the
new
castle
sets
a
super
set
you
get
loads
of
great
parts
a
horse
barding
a
black
skeleton
horse
and
for
a
fair
price
i
just
love
this
set
and
ive
bought
quite
a

of
them
to
build

and
your
great

fan
looking

otherwise
dont
worry
if
you
pass
on
this

thanks
and
happy
building
very
good
review
i
enjoyed
reading
this
i
want
to
buy
these
battlepacks
until
now
my
country
has
not
restocked
these
battlepacks
i
wonder
will
they
ever
arrived
again
i
want
to
build
massive
armies
with
this
outstanding
battlepack
set
hope
it
will
arrived
soon
nice
review
which
reminds
me
i
must
order
some
more
of
these
battle
packs
at
some
point
are
you
going
to
also
review
the
skelton
battlepack
also
i
hope
this
is
a
start
of
a
running
joke
about
castle
sets
being
stomped
by
sw
sets
i
love
this
battlepack
i
bought
two
last
time
i
went
to
legoland
california
and
it
certainly
gave
the
knights
a
good
variety
of
new
troops
however
i
have
one
complaint
and
that
is
the
guy
with
the
lance
i
am
wondering
why
he
has
a
lance
while
fighting
on
foot
if
tlg
really
wanted
to
give
him
a
lance
they
should
have
given
him
a
horse
great
set
but
with
two
huge
cons
availabilty
only
on
sh
well
surely
not
in
italian
stores
why
are
the
figures
already
built
are
todays
kids
so
dumb

how
were
you
able
to
get
three
small
shields
i
only
got
two
in
mine
i
am
going
to
check
the
trash
just
in
case
i
think
it
only
comes
with
two
the
extra
one
probably
slipped
in
from
another
set
sorry
for
any
confusion
i
think
this
battle
pack
is
a
little
expensive
but
the
minifig
their
heads
and
weapons
and
stuff
are
very
very
nice
but
because
of
the
price
ill
rate
it
average
i
love
this
set
i
bought
one
when
i
went
to
the
lego
store
at
downtown
disney
and
went
home
and
bought
another
online
i
love
that
it
gives
you
a
variety
of
weapons
and
figures
i
like
using
the
bowl
helmet
guy
to
man
my
catapults
and
crossbows
dear
all
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
usefull
army
building
set
at
2
euro
per
minifig
it
is
relatively
cheap
in
my
book
so
i
bought
4
battle
packs
recently
although
it
could
be
difficult
to
integrate
all
of
them
in
your
army
personally
i
reshuffled
some
of
the
weapons
as
to
integrate
them
better
but
that
is
a
personal
preference
ofcourse
kind
regards
teddy
yeah
i
have
to
admit
you
expect
it
to
be
wayyy
cheaper
since
a
no
packaging
to
pay
forbaggies
and
such
b
no
liscensing
feeslike
sw
so
why
isnt
this
set
a
better
deal
than

it

that
the

even
though
i

this

in

you
see
how
to
build
the

grueling
steps
the

not
much
out
of
the

here
except
for
the
lovely

minifigs
here
are
the
2

stud

make
a

dont
they
extra

this

comes
with
a
surprisingly
large
amount
of
extras
for
such
a
small
set
all
built
after
its
all
built
you
get
a
pretty
nice
set
the
road
sign
looks
nice
but
it
is
a
bit
strange
seeing
that

so
far

summary
this
is
a
great

having
2
minifigs
really
sets
it
above
some
of
the
other
ones
the
set
make
a
great

or
a
good
cheap
present
to
yourself
it
is
great
if
you
need
to
expand
your
police
force
as
well
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
thanks
and
happy
building
i
also
love
the
impulse
sets
but
we
have
already
too
many
policemen
although
i
actually
bought
this
one
our
bobby
isnt
looking
very
nice
is
he
we
normally
but
policemen
in
a
pool
or
sea
with
sharks
at
events
like
legoworld
so
maybe
thats
because
of
me

i
bought
this
set
for
214
$
yesterday
and
i
have
to
admit
that
for
that
price
im
veerryy
satisfied
i
bought
it
especially
for
the
dog
my
first
one
and
for
the
road
sign
during
the
construction
short
of
the
set
i
was
wondering
something
does
the
speed
limit
has
a
signification
in
every
country
or
some
variant
exists
in
my
country
france
the
speed
limit
in
town
is
50
kmh
so
i
understand
the
road
sign
in
this
set
but
in
other
country
and
especially
the
country
were
the
speed
limit
is
not
in
kmh
does
this
set
had
another
road
sign
i
agree
that
this
set
is
worth
the
price
considering
the
amount
of
minifigs
and
even
a
skeletal
horse
it
also
comes
with
a
lot
of
blue
1x1
slopes
that
are
always
useful
and
quite
rare
to
obtain
another
weapon
for
the
soldier
operating
the
catapult
or
a
shield
for
the
other
soldier
would
have
been
great
but
that
is
pushing
it
the
crossbow
itself
is
quite
nice
and
is
better
than
what
most
6

come
with
imo
overall
a
good
set
indeed
thank
you
for
the
review
and
the
other

which
i
hope
to
buy
in
the
near
future
as
it
looks
like
it
comes
with
a
great
deal
of
goodies
the
weapon
rack
is
useful

many
of

are

the

is

of
greys
and
black

with
this
set
comes
a
whopping
5
minifigs
which
is
amazing
for
a
20

the
knights
are
very
nice
and
one
has
a

the

adding
to

are
the

horses
3
skeleton

the

we
have
the

on

the
horses
head

very

the
knight
gets
a
nice
long
pointy

the
main
event
the
prison
carriage
the
design
of
this
is
excellent
with
the
bionicle
piece
and
the
white
horns
it
looks
very
spooky
the
tower
this
part
is
one
of
my
favorites
it
uses
white
horns
to
give
it
a
great
creepy
look
one
problem
is
that
there
is
barely
enough
room
for
the
2
skeletons
the
driver
here
you
can
see
the
driver
and
his
whip
you
can
also
see
the
bionicle
spine
a

when
you
look
from

you
can
see
the

looks

i
would
certainly
recommend
this
set
to
anyone
that
remotely
likes
lego
sets
thanks
and
happy
building
nice
review
it
seems
that
you
really
covered
all
aspects
of
this
fantastic
set
my
favorite
part
about
it
is
probably
the
fact
that
you
can
give
almost
every
included
minifig
a
mount
except
for
one
poor
knight
however
another
part
i
like
is
that
the
horse
includes
a
plain
saddle
which
is
a
nice
relief
after
the
overabundance
of
the
goldplate
barding
which
is
nice
but
overused
in
the
early
sets
also
the
sw
jokes
are
hilarious
i
particularly
the
running
gag
with
the
walker
but
i
like
this
one
too
reason
for

i
made
a

i
really
like
this
set
and
its
probably
my
next
purchase
from
a
store
if
i
can
still
find
it
theres
alot
of
great
pieces
i
especially
like
the
spiked
thingy
on
the
front
and
it
makes
a
great
addition
for
any
skeletal
army
above
all
i
just
love
the
spinechilling
feeling
of
it
if
i
were
a
minifig
in
a
legoland
id
be
scared
out
of
my
pantspiece
if
i
saw
a
carriage
like
that
rolling
towards
me
in
a
dark
night
this
was
one
of
the
first
sets
i
bought
from
the
new
castle

and
i
love
it
so
many
figs
and
awesome

thats
a
super
review
erdbeereis1
as
usual
and
as
we
can
expect
from
one
of
the
academy
teachers
i
gave
the
set
a
4
above
average
because
i
think
there
are
quite
some
minifigs
included
for
its
price
which
is
i
think
not
that
expensive
at
all
i
also
like
the
parts
that
are
included
like
the
sceleton
horses
and
weapons
wheels
imho
this
set
is
a
great

have
seen
this

yaaaay

it

i
have

seriously
if
you

this

is

but
it
doesnt

feeling
you
know

i
mean
i
would
prefered
a
knights
carrage
realy
but
the
design
is
ok

say

introduction
here
i
am
with
one
of
the
newest
castle
sets
realeased
in
early
2008
its
a
small
battle
wagon
with
blades
on
the
front
probably
to
demolish
rocks
in
mines
but
in
this
case
our
hero
dwarf
has
to
use
his
machine
against
the
evil
trolls
who
want
to
destroy
his
happy
kingdom
there
is
only
one
small
booklet
for
instructions
no
alternate
model
parts
come
in
two
bags
one
for
small
pieces
and
one
for
bigger
ones
apart
from
the
lovely
figures
the
brown
parts
will
be
quite
useful
for
any
castle
builder
extra
parts
are
not
even
worth
mentioning
there
are
no
stickers
figures
are
detailed
enough
dwarf
is
lovely
with
his
beard
but
his
legs
wont
move
because
he
is
short
figures
are
the
main
attraction
for
adult
players
we
havent
seen
castle
army
builder
sets
for
a
long
while
and
this
is
closest
weve
got
in
recent
years
the
dwarf
is
a
little
taller
than
it
should
have
been
but
its
not
possible
to
do
so
without
creating
a
completely
new
mould
for
figures
and
that
would
be
expensive
its
beard
is
oversized
as
well
but
that
gives
him
a
legoish
look
which
i
like
a
lot
the
trolls
thats
what
everybody
calls
them
but
i
say
they
are
orcs
are
obviously
evil
but
they
are
friendly
enough
not
to
scare
our
munchkins
but
i
wish
they
had
different
torsos
or
at
least
different
faces
like
crownies
there
are
not
enough
weapons
to
arm
everyone
but
the
flag
pole
is
really
nice
unlike
the
star
wars
army
builders
this
set
has
very
little
weaponry
only
one
sword
and
one
pike
creates
scarcity
for
3
figures
star
wars
sets
had
4
figures
for
same
price
so
i
hope
our
middle
age
warriors
dont
come
across
any
stormtroopers
building
in
progress
when
you
pull
the
chain
the
catapult
fires
a
round
brick
the
set
has
quite
good
playability
moving
blades
and
firing
catapult
should
be
fun
for
little
children
i
wouldnt
expect
more
functions
for
such
a
small
sized
model
it
hardly
covers
my
hand
the
blades
move
with
the
front
wheel
on
the
right
there
is
only
one
little
downside
there
is
too
much
friction
for
the
wheel
and
blades
wont
move
synchronized
you
may
come
over
this
problem
by
adjusting
the
blade
height
and
lining
them
with
the
wheels
mow
the
little
buggers
you
can
adjust
the
blade
height

overall
its

and
id
recommend
it
if
you
like
the
castle

youll
find
some
good
use
for
the
figures
and
this
is
the
cheapest

at

jeez
your
comments
are
getting
on
my
nerves
more
than
one
review
per
set
is
allowed
here
thanks
for
sharing
your
thoughts
on
this
set
with
us
a
great
set
now
has
another
great
review
ill
add
it
to
the
index
as
soon
as
the
poll
on
how
the
index
is
to
look
is
over
phewlong
sentence
oh
yeah
and
ill
rate
this
as
above
average
i
think
it
needs
at
least
one
minifig
more
than
there
is
i
got
this
set
last
month
and
i
can
definitely
say
that
even
if
you
think
it
is
one
of
the
best
sets
ever
you
wont
fully
appreciate
it
until
you
build
it
yourself
the
elevated
city
station
is
much
more
complex
than
it
looks
and
the
whole
set
is
extremely
detailed
the
good
as
stated
in
the
review
theres
a
lot
of
track
roughly
twice
as
much
as
the
last
monorail
made
6991
5
long
straights
too
the
designers
didnt
need
to
put
in
the
hamburger
stand
or
the
ticket
readers
but
they
did
and
made
it
even
better
great
figure
selection
airport
workers
as
well
as
civilians
the
bad
if
you
can
call
it
that
in
such
a
great
set
hard
to
incorporate
into
an
existing
town
if
using
the
default
track
layout
the
center
loop
would
be
inaccessible
to
vehicles
and
the
layout
is
very
large
the
monorail
needs
nearly
a
full
straight
section
on
either
side
of
the
city
station
or
it
will
impact
the
corner
of
the
station
and
stall
if
a
curve
is
too
close
as
far
as
i
know
the
only
town
set
with
road
plates
that
doesnt
have
a
wheeled
vehicle
a
car
would
have
been
nice
a
bus
would
have
been
incredible
but
these
small
things
in
no
way
diminish
from
the
fact
that
this
is
one
of
the
best
sets
ever

to
our

incredible
set
actually
released
before
why
dont
they
ever
continue

this
anymore
sigh
its
nice
to
see
so
much
detailed
from
its
shuttle
snack
bar
stairs
waiting
platform
validating
machine
and
etc
this
is
an
instant
5
set
if
given
a
chance
to
own
a
misb
set
i
will
defintely
seriously
consider
about
it

is
one
of
the
best
town
sets

review
of
a

to

well
of

i
do

quite
some
seats
a
drawer
full
actually
but
this
was
my
first
set
that
had
them
in
black
when
i
was
young
however
long
time
ago
you
know
i
always
had
a
short
supply
of
seats
so
thats
why
i
noticed
and

it
looks
fantastic
with
trains
running
underneath
it
good
review
very
nice
review
indeed
btw
a
lot
of
children
just
love
this
set
one
year
we
had
it
with
us
to
legoworld
and
children
asked
a
lot
of
questions
about
it
good
review
who
voted
this
below
average
i
own
one
and
managed
to
pick
it
up
off
ebay
a
few
years
ago
now
with
the
track
expansion
pack
for
#
150
in
very
good
condition
so
glad
i
did
an
all
time
classic
thanks
so
much
for
the
great
review
i
love
that
truck
i
hadnt
realized
there
was
a
real
4wide
recycle
truck
out
there
i
must
get
it
one
day
to
replace
this
abomination
currently
doing
garbage
duty
in
my
town
i
think
that
truck
has
seven
pieces
total
in
it
i
do
like
the
blue
color
though
i
did
not
see
this
nice
review
and
beautiful
truck
i
like
it
a
very
robust
set
the
fact
that
it
seats
two
figs
plus
has
ls
makes
it
a
unique
set
i
definitely
liked
the
big
airport
subtheme
tlg
created
in
the
early
1990s

give
me
a

thanks
of
course
for
the
flattery
but
do
you
then
from
your
profession
understand
what
the
purpose
is
of
the
front
spouts
that
even
can
be
hide
since
that
puzzles
me
it
can
be
that
the
lego
designers
thought
it
was
a
nice
touch
and
didnt
bothered
about
the
realistic
value
of
such
a
feature
but
i
dont
suppose
that
that
is
the
case
here
perfect
perhaps
the
front
sprouses
are
for
foaming
the
runway
youve
certainly
kept
that
set
in
near
mint
condition
havent
you
now
all
we
can
wish
for
is
a
new
firetruck
combining
this
ls
version
and
the
new
i
have
this
set
the
doors
really
dont
much
i
have
this
one
the
newer
6571
station
is
better
in
some
ways
but
i
always
liked
the
big
airportstyle
fire
engine
in
this
and
the
windows
covering
the
garages
one
mod
project
i
have
in
mind
is
to
expand
the
base
adding
a
second
room
in
the
area
beneath
the
control
center
interestingly
this
set
had
two
different
box
pictures
there
was
the
original
1989
yellow
legoland
box
and
a
1991
blue
system
box
and
the
blue
box
has
the
vehicles
in
different

i

the
6382
fire
station
is
the
better
one
from
the
80ies
i
have
6382
and
agree
that
it
is
a
great
set
it
doesnt
have
a
chopper
like
this
set
and
the
fire
engine
is
not
as
flash
it
does
have
a
downstairs
in
the
building
though
at
least
a
door
and
a
front
wall
anyway
its
nice
to
see
a
review
of
this
set
as
its
one
that
i
often
looked
at
in
the
catalogue
and
thought
of
getting
but
never
did
its
great
to
see
the
details
that
i
otherwise
would
not
have
seen
i
dont
like
the
firemen
with
hair
though
they
should
have
helmets
or
caps
imho
thanks
for
the
review
cheers
rog
from
memory
argos
sold
it
originally
for
about
#

i
seem
to
remember
this
as
i
could
not
afford
the
airport
released
the
same
year
as
this
was
about
#
2999
seems
such
a
small
amount

money
now
now

a
very
nice
review
jopiek
you
know
i
was
wondering
how
lego
could
justify
having
two
12vpowered
passenger
trains
at
the
same
time
but
after
reading
the
review
and
seeing
the
lack
of
figures
and
accessories
i
guess
i
understand
why
plus
the
train
is
rather
compact
oh
and
i
cant
help
but
think
that
the
chairs
in
the
middle
carriage
are
somewhat
oddly
placed
because
those
placed
next
to
the
door
are
unusable
because
the
door
takes
up
room
needed
for
figs
arms
also
it
appears
that
your
set
also
has
the
newer
couplers
ie
theres
no
hooks
for
the
decoupling
rail
to
grab
hold
of
with
the
light
assembly
it
really
wont
matter
playwise
or
if
you
dont
have
any
decouplers
but
its
still
a
bit
of
a
bummer

said
the
chair
was
just
loose
so
it
should
be
placed
on
the
2x2
plate
that
is
also
visible
in
the
picture
of
the
middle
car
btw
the
front
magnet
is
the
old
type
i
have
some
decouplers
but
we
dont
use
them
because
they
are
not
really
that
reliable
lego
just
release
a
whole
line
of
trains
at
the
same
time
i
just
discussed
with
my
parents
and
they
told
be
lego
had
those
sets
longer
in
store
back
then
i
must
have
gotten
the
7745
somewhere
in
1983
or
even
1984
although
it
was
released
in
1981
i
started
of
with
the
7710
push
along
train
and
then
upgraded
the
tracks
with
current
rails
when
i
got
the
7745
the
7745
was
realsed
in
1985
lego
had
2
12v
passengers
trains
between
1981
and
1984
the
7740
7725
during
the
80s
the
avergae
life
of
a
train
was
about
5
years
a
great
review
for
a
great
set
thanks
for
sharing
it
with
us
a
like
the
older
lego

btw
i
think
you
need
to
fix

great
review
i
would
buy
the
sets
but
sadly
tlc
doesnt
sell
them
anymore
i
have
one
question
only
how
can
you
be
reviewing
at
this
time
at
night
i
would
never
dream
of
doing
that
well
i
cant
wait
to
see
the
other
reviews
i
had
never
seen
these
sets
before
in
my
retail
stores
before
however
i
do
remember
the
existence
of
its
video
games
look
like
an
interesting
set
for
great
outdoor
enterainment
and
fun
for
lego
citizens
whom
is
out
for
real
thrill
and
excitement
this
theme
never
really
got
me
excited
back
then
after
reading
your
review
its
quite
useful
for
some
new
addition
to
your
town
features
such
as
including
a
skater
boy
holding
the
pizza
instead
of
using
the
pizza
van
the
high
fuel
cost
must
have
caught
up
to
them
to
resort
using
skate
board
for
delivery
as
for
the
street
surfer
vehicle
its
a
cool
looking
vehicle
with
unique
construction
pardon
me
i
have
not
seen
such
design
before
i
will
actually
tear
off
the
wheels
cover
up
the
sides
and
used
it
for
wind
surfing
thats
the
whole
idea
after
giving
some
thoughts
and
weighs
its
factors
i
will
have
to
give
it
a
3
for
this
set
i
will
probably
get
it
if
its
on
sales

again

for

and
the

heres
a
picture
of
the
orange
hangglider
and
the
underside
unfortunately
the
hangglider
is
too
heavy
to
be
held
up
by
a
minigig
while
i
like
the
brickbuilt
glider
for
the
extra
pieces
the
plastic
wing
pieces
from
the
ninja
theme
would
have
worked
effectively
and
be
a
lot
lighter
i
think
the
seaplane
is
the
best
part
of
the
set
heres
a
shot
of
the
front
end
i
like
the
skeletal
sharkfish
design
whats
great
is
none
of
the
pieces
use
stickers
they
are
all
printed
including
the
tail
end
although
the
cockpit
has
no
steering
wheel
or
lever
piece
it
does
have
a
very
nice
printed
1x2
tile
the
wings
of
the
airplane
have
hinges
to
allow
them
to
fold
inward
slightly
also
notice
the
nice
chromesilver
pieces
heres
a
shot
of
the
underside
of
the
seaplane
and
lastly
the
complete
set
final
thoughts
air
chase
is
another
one
of
those
fun
island
sets
two
figs
with
two
vehicles
make
a
perfect
combination
for
creating
some
dogfights
in
the
air
at
the
same
time
the
bricksters
plane
can
land
in
the
water
to
explore
other
adventure
play
opportunities
this
set
is
also
a
nice
addition
to
the
island
xtreme
stunts
truck
stunt
trikes
6739
the
seaplane
can
be
hauled
by
the
large
semitruck

hope
you
enjoy
this
review
nice
review
is
that
one
minifig
breaking
out
of
prison
just
wondering
about
his
clothing
the
worst
thing
is
the
name
anything
with
xtreme
in
the
title
almost
deserves
the
lowest
score
possible
on
principle
i
knew
this
set
looked
familiar
thank
you
brickster
for
bringing
one
of
my
first
lego
sets
ever
back
to
my
memory
unfortunately
i
dont
have
many
of
the
pieces
left
but
thank
you
i
love
the
classic
sets
of
that
era
and
a
great
review
helps
show
off
the
simplicity
of
some
older
sets
yeah
the
name
on
this
set
is
strange
i
think
all
the
boxes
say
garbage
truck
i
guess
its
up
to
each
builder
to
decide
whether
1x1
round
plates
are
recyclable
material
or
not
its
a
great
model
in
any
case
i
love
these
highly
detailed
city
trucks
weve
been
getting
during
the
last
year
or
two
i
used
to
have
a
preference
for
the
late
80searly
90s
city
line
but
some
of
these
new
sets
have
really
surpassed
them
in
detail
and
functionality
i
own
this
set
and
i
think
its
a
really
nice
truck
but
there
is
two
little
details
that
i
didnt
like
1
a
recycle
truck
really
needs
2
minifig
one
to
drive
one
to
put
the
garbage
on
the
back
2
the
big
hole
behind
the
driver
seat
it
was
easy
to
fill
it
like
this
with
hole
pouf
no
more
little
hole
but
this
is
really
a
great
set
anyway
45
for
me
above
average
nice
review
this
is
a
very
nice
vehicle
one
of
my
favorite
of
the
newer
city
ones
jopiek
there
are
two
generations
of
road
plate
that
are
wide
enough
for
sixwide
vehicles
like
this
the
current
plates
are
dark
grey
with
plain
white
printing
and
look
not
great
in
my
opinion
the
previous
ones
are
imo
the
best
road
plates
of
all
time
green
with
dark
grey
road
white
dotted
linezebras
drain
covers
and
yellow
verge
markings
just
like
we
really
have
here
in
ireland
for
urban
area
i
would
still
choose
the
greenedged
plates
and
just
cover
up
the
green
the
markings
are
so
much
better
than
the
current
plates

am
said
also
it
will
not
empty
completely
because
of
that
panel
actually
it
does
the
back
part
of
the
truck
with
the
panel
hinges
up
so
that
when
you
want
the
truck
to
dump
it
doesnt
get
in
the
way
thanks
for
the
review
this
is
one
of
the
few
city
sets
that
i
own
despite
loving
the
theme
so
much
most
of
my
town
is
either
custom
or
classic
and
its
about
as
beautiful
as
a
big
garbage
truck
can
ever
be
quote
nice
truck
indeed
but
the
yellow
one
is
better
i
think
at
least
if
you
put
them
on
a
roadplate
it
seems
to
me
that
those
road
plates
are
too
small
for
that
also
it
will
not
empty
completely
because
of
that
panel
well
for
the
rest
it
is
a
nice
set
and
a
fine
review
well
the
truck
barely
fits
onto
the
old
roadplates
not
on
curves
though
so
if
you
put
it
in
a
display
it
probably
wont
look
bad
i
think
from
what
i
see
this
and
all
the
other
6
wide
vehicles
will
fit
much
better
on
the
newer
roadplates
which
are
four
studs
wider
than
the
old
ones
nice
review
i
realy
need
to
pick
up
this
set
and
the
cement
truck
too
it
would
be
cool
if
someone
made
a
moc
in
which
hippies
steal
the
truck
and
cover
it
with
flowers
and
bright
colors
and
stuff
