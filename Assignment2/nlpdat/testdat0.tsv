CP5670, on Jul 8 2008, 05:04 AM, said: These are pretty good, but I think they look too much like the standard town roads from that period. I like the black space plates from the early 90s better (6710). Oh how I love these plates. Afew years ago I found a local retail store with about 6-7 sets of these in their basement warehouse I was given special access to (along with MANY other old space goodies.. hehe..) I love the things, I have loads, and I've used them for multiple space bases and battles. Along with afew grey crater plates and the large grey plates (1.5x the size of a normal baseplate) you can get quite a monorail layout going. *sigh* I should really clean up and get one set up again, so I can take some pictures!	positive

By looking at the pictures used to display this set I've a sneaky suspicion it did not come with instructions but meant for the pictures to be ideas. The whole set was suppose to teach children to use their imagination, giving them instructions would somewhat defeat this while trying to figure how to build things from looking at pictures would be a much better educational experience.	negative
Great review Sinner. I own the later version, 709 released in 1977. Mine no longer has decals though. The variations were minimal. It looks like your boat is in really good shape considering it's >30 years old. Excellent review!	positive

well what to say? i got this boat late 70s, when we were on our way to Italy to spend the holidays there. My parents always needed to keep my quiet during the 3-day trip, and the best way to do that was to buy me a lego set... I got this one in a gas station in Germany. As far as I remember Italy didn't have lego sets, so a gas station close to the Italian border but still in Germany or Austria was very often their last chance. I often saw large quantities of lego sets in those gas stations though... i remember seeing yellow castle and... the galaxy explorer, standing on a shelf. It would be my birthday 1-3 week(s) later so i always made sure they knew what to buy for me...	positive
Great Review Mariko! This set is way before my time too. I like how LEGO used to create simple one story houses instead of the really tall house that we see in today's Town Theme, such as 8403 City House. One story houses such as 345 just look more realistic to my eyes. The simplistic, minimalism vibe that I get with this set is something that is hard to find in today's much more detailed sets (although, trust me, I love love love today's detailed sets). - The Brick is Epic	positive

Question for you guys, what's the best way to clean Lego? I was noticing that the baseplates and gray plates to this set are very dusty and could use a good cleaning. Mild soap water soak? Is there a better way?	neutral

Thanks for the review 'LuxorV', an interesting old set, though I find it hard to imagine a square smoke stack instead of roundish.

Ah, the good old days........Thanks for the review 'Yoshi648' - CUTE and COOL at the same time. It's interesting to see that the same front end parts had been used from the early 70's up in to the late 90's ! Nice again to step back in time and keep on bricking everyone !	positive

Very brave to give an impression about one of the oldest sets ever reviewed! A lot members here are younger than the set itself. I think you will have to have grown up with it to like it. Nowadays we have seen quite a few better airplanes than that one, for example this years 7643 . But thanks for letting us know. Btw., the 1x1 round brick with the solid stud is no. 3062a instead of 3062b (with the hollow stud).	positive

Well, now that I have some money, a trip to ToysRUs was obviously in my future, especially since my local TRU has much of the summer 2007 lineup. When I got there, almost all the smaller Castle sets had been sold out, but there was one left: the one I am now reviewing for both Eurobricks and BZPower. ;-) The Box: Well, for starters, the Castle theme boxes are beautiful! The blended clear and stormy skies give a great ?clash of the titans? effect, and the action poses help as well. ;-) The back is equally nice, featuring a photo showing kids how to use the crossbow, and the brave axe wielder taking a swipe at the skeleton (foolish soldier, that won?t work on skellies! See later on in the review to find out why). And of course, we have a small box with the link to the official Lego website, where TLC can advertise even more Lego sets! :P The Contents: After opening the box, a single bag of pieces (with a couple loose ones), the instruction manual and necessary catalog ( :-P ), and a new wider rubber band holder spilt out. The instruction manual is clear as a bell. No color trouble here, folks! Also, it?s worth mentioning the nice background with the mountain and King?s castle silhouettes. :-) Sorry that there's no picture, but I'll take one if someone wants to see it. ;-) The Pieces: For being a 5 dollar set (well, seven in my case. Darn your above average prices, TRU!), Crossbow Attack features a lot of nice pieces (as does the entire Castle lineup). Notable elements include two large brown spoked wheels, two brown modified 1x1?s, a pearl gold slope end, and SIX dark blue modified 1x1x2/3 slopes! The bulk of the pieces, however, are nothing special. I?ll let the picture do the talking for this. The accessories are by far the best parts in this kit. Two different helmets in a beautiful shiny silver are my favorite, but I also really like the scythe (looks good for MOCing) and the round shield ( *wub* ), which are both brand new parts. And can anyone not love the classic axe and crossbows? Oh, and there?s a black lightsaber too, but that?s rather boring compared to the other parts. :-P The Minifigures: Can you say, FOUR figures (including the horse)?! That has to be a record for a regular 5 dollar set, at least in the present age of limited figures per set. We?ll start out with the two Crown militia: a regular soldier and an archer. Both have old faces, but they look spiffy with the shiny helmets and the superb torsos. I?ll name the soldier Bravo the Stout and the archer Angler the Precise, for future references. Now we come to the skellie. Although some people dislike the new skeleton design, I personally prefer it to the old ones, since the arms are now poseable and the face much meaner. The only problem is that the arms hang too low, but it?s not too noticeable when they have weapons in their hands. And last, but not least, here?s the elusive skeleton horse. I for one am very happy that TLC took advantage of that awesome prototype piece and made it into an official mass-production mold. However, the horse is unfortunately one piece, but since regular Lego horses are as well, I don?t have a problem with it. I do have a problem with the pose, however. The legs are in quite an odd position, and I wonder why TLC didn?t make the front and back leg poses symmetrical. Ah well. The Finished Set: I have only two pictures here, since this set is so small. First, here?s the completed crossbow. I must say: FINALLY! No more ridiculous horse mounted catapults or crazy fire wheel launchers! Now we have realistic siege weapons, including the one included with 7090. Plus, it actually launches okay, although not the best. Here?s the other main attraction: the completed skeleton rider and horse. I think it?s rather dramatic with that pose and the dark background, don?t you think? ;-) Playability: Okay, so there?s not much in this set, but a bit of imagination brings plenty of possibilities. To show you what you can do, here?s a little story made only with this set. ;-) Overall Rating: Presentation: 9/10 Pieces: 8/10 Minifigures: 9/10 Finished model: 8/10 Playability: 8/10 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Final Score: 8.4/10 Crossbow Attack is a fine introduction into Castle, so I recommend it to any Lego fan, whether they are a castle nut or just want a cheap change of pace. TLC has a knack with making great small kits these days, and I more than ever support them in their amazing rebound from their dark ages (between 1997 and 2004). ;-) Edited by KimT, 10 August 2008 - 01:33 PM.	positive
Very nice little review. Tis too bad I'm skint and can't afford any sets at the moment. Loved the little story too! Also, on your comment about the skellie horses. All Lego horses are posed like that because it's the way horses walk. Check it next time you can.	positive

Here is a review of the new Monster Dino creator set with power functions First lets start with the box which is much larger than it needs to be!! It is one of the new style re-closeable boxes rather than the rip the sides style. This set is typical of creator and comes with three sets of instructions. The Monster Dino a kind of spider and a Crocodile The set comes with two of the new motors one small and one large, a sound module plus the new IR controler and receiver. There is a mix of techniques in this set the core is mainly studless technic, there are some studded technic parts and most of the details are standard creator style. There are two mechanisms one to control the legs and one to control the head and arms. The leg drive is from the large motor and the arm and head are operated from the small motor The completed mechanism will stand on its own without any detail added The detail is added to the base unit to complete the model. The operation of the Dino is very good the design for the motors and drives is very compact and well thought out. The walking motion works well although there is no steering and it will fall over it it encounters obstacles. The sound module is built into the head so when the mouth opens the Dino roars (sort of) Glyman made the comment that this set is ugly as sin and I tend to agree I think there are too many colour variations with different shades of grey, black and that lime green :-P which confuses the look of the finished model but I guess it might apeal more to younger kids. I also do not like the spikes along the back, which glow in the dark, because the are loose and keep falling off. This set is not cheap at ?70 but I guess this is because of the motors and IR controller. While on this I was surprised how good the range was on the new controller it would still operate ever when not in direct line of sight. I would give this set a 10/10 for playabilityit has kept the kid amused for hours I would give it 6/10 for value for money it is a bit pricey Overall 8/10 It took approx 3 hours to build and has been well played with I have posted some more images and some videos of the finished models on my brickshelf page HERE If you have any questions please ask Pete Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 06:28 PM.

Tks a lot for your review Ickelpete ;-) I saw that set at TRU a couple of weeks ago but was really not interested due to the design - I am not a fan of those motorized Lego sets |-/ I guess the lime colour is to please kids, as well as the general design, far from a real dino ;-) I am sure that its going to sell well to a younger croud. Let me quote you here: Quote The walking motion works well although there is no steering and it will fall over it it encounters obstacles. Hum, I really hope it works welll because I will have to buy that motorized AT-AT and I dont want it to crash :-P *yoda*	neutral
I didn't spot this great review earlier. Thanks for the effort of posting all those pics and videos, they helped me decide that this set is worth getting.	positive
Got this baby via shop@home a little early and I though it was time to post my view of this set : (Snefroe you NEED to get this one ;-) ) Sorry for the lack of pics but there are already many pics online of this baby So here it is : Best space set since... a way too long time This is my first new space themed set since more than 20 years and I must say that I’m not disappointed at all. I have much to say about this little gem. First, let’s cut it straight about the Martians minifigures: they are absolutely rubbish. I can’t imagine how Lego could produce such atrocity. This said; let’s move on to the dropship. A real piece of art. Reminiscent of the Aliens movie dropship. The cockpit is spacious and provides a great field of view, too bad there is no hinges to open it, you must remove the canopy completely to switch pilot. The drilling unit can be attached under the ship with the clever use of a rubber piece. It stays well in place once attached, good point. Some people don’t like the inclusion of the 2 containment area for the Martians and crystal on both side of the ship but I kind like it, it makes the ship less empty. The 2 wings are complete with air intake, some armaments and 1 standard launcher on the right wing. Normally I don’t like launchers but this one is very discrete and well integrated. On the tail section are 2 thrusters that can be rotated and provide thus some “realistic” movements to the ship. One of the last highlight of this ship is the landing gears, or I must say landing dishes. 6 medium sized radar dishes provide and incredible stability to the set. They are quite sturdy and can take a beating. I’m not going to review the alien spaceship in detail since it’s quite uninteresting. I consider it more like a bonus addition to the set than anything else. The look is passable and there are some interesting building techniques in it. That’s all. To end the review, a little pros/cons table. (We all love pros/cons table :-) ) Pros: - Incredible design - At last a decent space set - Modular functions - Quite Sturdy - Beautiful - Great value for money Cons: - Martians are rubbish - No hinges for the canopy - The drilling unit could use some more details. Score: 9/10 By the way , I added a nice cool feature on my site , you can download the stickers for some sets that I own. Before building I always scan the stickers, we never know it could come handy. check this out on my site (you need to go in the Lego lists on the left): [VTX] Classic games	positive
I've got it also, but i think i'll replace the ball joint pieces with the kind of pieces that give the wings their angle.	neutral
Tks once again Dunamis for a great in-depth review ;-) I really look forward to your supped up and moded AT-AT :-P I am really not found of the design BUT I think its still a nice parts pack, especially with all these nice "power function" elements ;-) *yoda*	positive
Wow...that set is really something. But I prefer Pehistoric Power, and Triceratops. Or are they the same? I can never tell.	positive

Thanks for the early review! I don't know much about the rebals show at all, but I can say that the over all design of the walker really appeals to me and the minifigs look top notch. I also like how the spring shooters are pretty much hidden in the frame, nice job!	positive
Thanks for the review! I have two questions: - What is the driver standing on, when the hatch is open and he is looking out? - Could you show the face of Kallus without helmet, please? My only complaint is that the colours of both, Kallus's and the drivers's uniforms are wrong. Kallus's uniform is way too dark and should be more dark olive than black, and the drivers's uniforms are too bright and should be more greyish compared to what we saw in the series.	neutral

Also 2x buildings on a 32x32 base-plate with a lots of spare studs behind the buildings are these buildings 12 studs in width?. It still looks great style wise, however this might be a set i buy and look at it after i have built it & regret the amount of $$$ i have spent on it. $239 for us Aussie's . Both are are 14 deep on the upper floors. DO is 3 studs deeper on the ground floor, buit that's pretty much it. Can't believe how cramped the upper floors of the barber shop look.

This set is truely incredible, a must have. BUT this set is also incredibly overpriced *n* ! Com' on it's only a big vehicle , nothing really special to justify the near 100? price tag. This set is clearly worth something like 65? at max. Look at the incredible dropship for 34?, that's a good value for money! *y* Edited by mutex, 15 July 2007 - 04:57 PM.	neutral
I echo the consensus of this thread - too much technic, looks great, too expensive, looks great.	neutral
Please build the alien craft, I'm sure that we would all like a review of that! ^_^'	neutral
I wish the wheels would be arranged like the turbo tank, this one looks too movable.	negative
Nice Review *y* I have quick question though.... Do the crystals fit into the aliens hands? Try and stick one in there,Becuase the new catalog shows an image of an alien holding a crystal Lastly lego should have made the aliens with movable arms and no hole in the middle |-/ I don't want to waste any money so I am only going to grab 1 or 2 of the smaller sets Piranha EDIT:IMO the aliens would win becuase they have superior technology and all they do is have to cut the airtank line and the humans die Edited by Piranha, 20 July 2007 - 01:40 AM.	positive
Say, I was looking at your pics and then at the instructions and I just realised : haven't you put the stikers on the shield thingies in the middle upside down? I think you did :-D I don't know if I like those new sets, though... I mean they have great shapes and potential, but at the same time, they seem so holey... They're really huge and big but full of empty air and space as well... Well, this one not as much, and indeed it is the best looking set of the lot, though... But I don't think I'll go into that line...	neutral
Two of my daughters are building this as we speak. I agree the design is a lot smaller than I would have liked, but they're loving it. No question the figures are the real draw here. And at 6 and almost five years old they're doimg a good job building so far. At least for the 4-6 range in my house, this set is a home run. Thanks for the great review, Mostlytechnic!	positive
I managed to get two sets for my twin girls for Christmas, and would have to agree with your ratings (the Anna and Elsa figs are indeed excellent)	neutral
Yep, my family all thinks they should have made a bigger set, added figs, and just been printing money. This feels massively rushed into production. Which is weird, the other princess sets that just came out look worlds better.	negative
The review is very well done. Thanks! I don't know the movie. My key question is whether the bricks in the set will allow to build my own snow/ice creations. Now, with "trans-glitter" being part of the design approach I am not so sure. Can those who have already bought it tell me: can trans-glitter be used as "transparent with snow particles" or is it just terrible? I cannot really tell from the review pic above.	neutral
Well, the good news for you is you're in luck whenever you find sets, since the figs sell for a good bit of money :) Right now the bricklink value of the 3 figs is about $30!	positive
mostlytechnic, on 10 January 2015 - 02:02 AM, said: I think the trans-glitter blue panels can be icy or snowy just fine. I'm sure that's WHY they used them for this set. Now, if you're looking for realism (like the photos in your sig seem to be), it might be tougher. But I've been thinking about using those big glittery panels to make a waterfall-type scene. The guys over in the historic forum will kill me if my MOCs start to glitter I'll take a closer look when I see the set in a shop (and, as I understand, I can sell the minifigs for the price of the set...).	neutral
Thanks for the review. This will end up being a must buy for my daughter.	positive
Great review! I definitely agree, the minidolls are too awesome and are definitely a must-have. I love all the extra pieces from any set, some of them go on my phone case.	positive
Bennemans, on 13 January 2015 - 06:08 PM, said: There is a very simple reason for the flowers and green-leaved trees; you should remember from the movie it was actually summer when Elsa set of the eternal winter… True, but all around her ICE CASTLE it is all winter. So why are there non-winter bits in this set? Doesn't make sense. The picnic is because they wanted a mini-vignette for Olaf to fit into, but the rest of the green and flowers don't make sense. Tenorikuma, on 13 January 2015 - 09:58 AM, said: I'm pretty sure I've gotten other sets recently with three pieces of tape on them. Cool, good to know. Was wondering but haven't remembered to look when I'm at a store recently. WhiteFang, on 13 January 2015 - 09:12 AM, said: Very nice review indeed and I also can't wait for the release of this set. It will be a superb wonderful addition to the LEGO Disney Princess theme. Thanks for the FP, but "a lovely sweet review?" I thought I bashed this set pretty hard	negative
Hello everyone, I am back to share with all of you, another of my Legends of Chima polybags review. It will be pretty comprehensive since the finished built will be quick and will be focusing more of what kind of fun that you can derive from there. This polybag was bought in September 2013, when I visited LEGOLAND Malaysia and I did not hesitate to put this in my shopping basket. Name: 30253 Leonidas Jungle Dragster Theme: LEGO System / Legends of Chima Year: 2013 Pieces: 30 Minifigs: 1 minifigure Price: USD N.A, GBP N.A, EURO N.A, SGD N.A Resources: Brickset, BrickLink An original polybag image of the 30253 Leonidas Jungle Dragster Back view of the original polybag image of the 30253 Leonidas Jungle Dragster The road scout of the Lions Tribe This polybag design is definitely plan to be the quickest and fastest dragster to recce enemy front by making a swift scout for the Lions Tribe. I believe by the sound of the name, Jungle Dragster, it might just be suitable to use in jungle terrain. Well, I don't quite agree that this is a 'Dragster' even though it has the kind of open view concept of rolling in fast but it does not have the length of a typical dragster, similar to this Town polybag design, for example. Still, it is nice to have smaller variants of their vehicular supremacy. Instruction Manual (Front) Instruction Manual (Back) The LEGO building content With just 30 LEGO elements, you can be pretty quick to be able to display these laid out content. After the built is completed, these are the remaining spare parts. I am fond of the wheels which are some useful parts, other than that, there are nothing spectacular about it. My name is Leonidas and I belonged to the Lions Tribe Do not be mistaken of his name, Leonidas to be the King of Sparta who led the brave men of 300 Spartans Warriors to fight to the death against the Persians. Instead this character is based on the bio resided in LEGO.com, you will realise that he is aligned with the Lions tribe and is a proud Lion foot-soldier. He may have that goofy idiotic look but he can be very serious in his commitment to discharging his duties. You are able to observe his nice back view printing which reveal his black and blue sash. Leonidas has a dual facial feature to reveal his much serious appearance. Leonidas is one of the common characters available in the Legends of Chima universe. It can be found in a total of five sets. It is a great pity that there is no weapon being made for him in this polybag design which will certainly make a fine addition. The completed built of the Jungle Dragster This is the main design of the Jungle Dragster which is very simple looking. There is no distinct fighting capability from the vehicular design and it look just like a regular patrol vehicle. One thing I like about this, is the close distinct colour schema of the Lions Tribe. Other than that, there is nothing special about it. Moving off with my Jungle Dragster To conclude, this polybag is really meant for LEGO fans or collectors who appreciate Legends of Chima or wanting to sample the Legends of Chima theme. It is a very simple built, but yet could form a decent force size for recce purposes before sending in the big arsenals to whack their enemies. Either way, I will only suggest you to buy it if you really love this theme at an inexpensive price. Otherwise, it is perfectly alright to give this a miss. Summary review Playability: 4/10 (You need to have more Lions Tribe vehicles in order to bring the best and fun out of it since this is more of a supporting vehicle.) Design: 4/10 (Simplistic built of the dragster and main focus is just acquiring the minifigure.) Price: 4/10 (Bought at about USD$7, which is not an awesome price, so get it if you can get it more than half of this price.) Overall: 4/10 (If only you are a huge mega fan of the Legends of Chima, then you need to get this.) I gave it a "2" based on my Review Score Card. What about yours? I hope every one of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and Criticisms are strongly welcomed. Pictures can be found in My Flickr.	negative
Good and helpful review again, WhiteFang. I probably have no use for a lionish creature with goofy looks...	negative
What's up pups? I have written a review for 7786 Batcopter: The Chase for Scarecrow on my website: BrickZone.net As usual it involves Fabuland figures involved in a crazy story. Enjoy and feel free to let me know what you think. Thanks! X-D click on the picture to read the review...	neutral
Sinner, on Jul 18 2007, 05:19 AM, said: That was a great review with loads of excellent pictures. The set is better than I thought. I want to buy one of the new sets as I would love a blue Batman, but they are so expensive for Australians. I love the new pumpkin heads. The story involved more mini-fig cruelty; excellent! I also liked the scarecrow/crow joke. :-D (One request; please don't say lines like "To the Batcopter" next time. That is the old TV series and I hated that. >:-) Feel free to tell me to stick my request up my M#g@Bl*cks.) Sinner, Thanks brother! And yes please take your request and stick it...back in your heart where it came from! :-X I know you mean well, but I love the camp!! I purposely put "to the batcopter" and my favorite "the jig is up!" in there because it's so ridiculous. And don't you know requesting me not to do it will only encourage me to do it more? I annoy because I love... *wub* The crow is my favorite part. :-$ I'm happy to be swaying you over to the side of mini-fig suffering >:-) It sucks that your pricing is so different over there. Perhaps if you're a good sinner (?) santa will bring you some evil pumpkin heads for Christmas. Or whoever brings you presents over there...a magical wallabee flying a didjeridoo, I presume... :-P Piranha! Always my biggest fan. Thanks brother. I'm glad I can amuse you. Book of the Ancients is serious but Fabuland Housewives will overlap for those who prefer the comedy. I hope Book of the Ancients is good. I'm re-tooling it right now because I was identifying a lot of cliches, so I threw a lot of plots out the window and re-visited my whole concept. Anyway, there will always be quick wacky reviews that will hopefully amuse you. Norrington-Thanks as always, my buddy. *sweet*	positive
Christian, on Jul 18 2007, 08:21 PM, said: I would love to have this set but the price is just to high here, far worse than I had expected. I'll be better off buying the Battank, which is much better priced. Actually there is almost no price difference between The Batcopter and The Battank here *wacko* That is insane! *wacko* 450 and 500! Indeed; you should just buy the tank. Comparing the price of the Tank to the Batwing you seem to be getting quite a good deal there. Both are over priced for Australians and the Tank is twice the price of the copter. (They are 60 AUD and 120 AUD.) I am still not sure if I will buy either... :'-( Edited by Sinner, 18 July 2007 - 11:47 AM.	negative
Thanks for the review. I'm definitely getting this, mainly becasue it's Batman. I love the blue Bats, the Scarecrow is good as ever, and those new pumpkins are just *wub* . There's a few things I'll MOD, but nothing really major. I'll have to wait till I get this to decide properly though.	positive
Sinner, on Jul 18 2007, 08:24 AM, said: I thought you would like it! I am pleased to say that I didn't know that "the jig is up!" was also a common line. Most of what I remember about the old Batman TV show actually comes from the movie as I own that. (Mum bought it for me.) I tend to put in on if I have friends over and I am drunk enough. I like the darker side of Batman only, and thus anything that is against the idea that Batman is as big a loon as the guys that he hauls in I don't like. Joel schumaker's movies fall well within that category. Wait, what? Are you saying you prefer the Joel Schumacher films? If you like the darker side of Batman, I recommend the Tim Burton films. Joel Schumacher is as campy as "the jig is up" IMO. He added freakin' nipples to the batsuit for God's sake! :-P You'd have to be nice and drunk to enjoy his films. ;-) I really like Batman, Batman Returns and Batman Begins.

What's up Kernow!!?? Nice review. Thanks for sharing. Welcome to Eurobricks, I hope you have fun here! :-D X-D That Qui-Gonn thing is weird. Come on LEGO! Someone is just asleep at the wheel over there with quality control. Missing pieces, injections molds, slipping quality, ice cube trays...IMO, that's a huge thing to miss. The mini-fig on the box doesn't come in the set=false claims. Anyway, the ship looks beautiful and I wanted this set when I first saw it and your review confirms that it is very cool. Thanks again!

Asuka, on Aug 1 2007, 01:47 PM, said: No, I think this is correct. The upper plate with clip for the door is a little high, on top of a dark gray 1x1 brick. So if you want the door to operate well you have to place it like that. I just put the clip under that brick, a very easy fix, so my door now is lower which looks better IMHO, and no sneaky skelly can crawl along under it.... X-D Exactly. Asuka is correct. Also keep in mind that the picture was taken looking down on the model that is sitting on the carpet. It makes the gap appear a little larger. In addition; for those of you that recommended ironing the sail, it worked great. I set the iron to low and used a t-shirt to protect the sail. It flattened it out perfectly. In fact, it worked so well, that I did the same with my old WW Weapons Wagon cover that has gotten wrinkled over the years. The iron worked perfectly.	positive
Yes, that was definately an optic illusion. Looking at it again, the gap looks a lot shorter. Thanks. :-) Shakar	positive
Yes, very nice review Mr Brickster! I think I , for a change, like the castle part better. The ship doesn't look quite right to me. If they're gonna make a pirate theme with ships like this I wouldn't be very happy... But I think the ship brings some nice accesories. Like the anchor, a black mid piece(!), steering wheel etc. I think I'll buy it eventually.

REVIEW - 42039 - 24 HOURS RACE CAR INTRODUCTION When the preliminary images of the "Le Mans Racer" surfaced somewhere last year (2014) it got a lot of praise. This changed dramatically when the final images of the 24 Hours Race Car showed up. The front side of the car, especially the head lights, and the curvature of the side of car had changed a lot. The car obviously still resembled the prototype, but the new design raised a lot of eyebrows. The new design was considered a step back instead of forward. Eventhough I still liked the design, I must admit I liked the earlier design better too. With the emphasis on past tense liked. I am not sure anymore and this review will show you why. Like the Arctic Truck this set has a B-model which is well worth checking out. That's why this review includes both the A-model and B-model. For people who are on the fence, the B-model might actually convince them to buy the set after all. Let's see what this set is all about! Note: All images can be clicked for hi-res versions. SET INFORMATION Number: 42039 Title: 24 Hours Race Car Theme: Technic Released: 2015 Part Count: 1219 Box Weight: 2110 gr Box Dimensions: 47,8 cm x 37,3 cm x 8,7 cm Model Dimensions: 40 cm x 18 cm Set Price (MSRP): €99.99 / $? / £99.99 Price per Part: €0.082 / $? / £0.082 Links: Brickset, Bricklink THE BOX The box measures 47,8 cm x 37,3 cm x 8,7 cm and weighs well over 2kg (2110 gr to be precise). The width of the box is the same as the box of the Arctic Truck. This box also feels like it's filled to the brim. THE FRONT The front shows a picture of the main model in action, with radial blurred wheels to emphasize the motion of the car. The lower right section shows the dimensions of the model. Upon completion, it will measure a length of 40cm and a width of 18 cm. THE BACK Like the front, the back side has exactly the same setup as the box of the Arctic Truck. The top shows the functions of the model, while the lower left side shows the B-model and the lower right side shows the motorization options. The picture of the B-model looks so cool, it could be a model of it's own. At this point I was very eager to build both models and compare them. THE SIDE One of the sides usually shows a part in 1:1 scale. This time it's one of the wheels indicating the size of the model. CONTENT OF THE BOX The box contains: 1 Book(let) 1 Sticker Sheet 13 Bags 4 Tires INSTRUCTION BOOKLET Since I own two copies of the set, I also received two instruction booklets. What's catching my eye is that my second copy is supplied in different packaging than the first one. It's for the first time (that I am aware of) that the instruction booklet and stickers come in a sealed bag, without cardboard back. Hopefully this will be a new standard for all sets with sticker sheets. Instead of multiple booklets, this set contains a single square bound book. In earlier reviews I have epxressed my preference for a single book. I don't see any advantage in having 2, 3 or even up to 6 booklets. STICKER SHEET Like the actual model, the sticker sheet looks very vibrant. The bright green, white and black color combination has found it's way to the stickers as well. Either you love 'em or hate 'em. Since I started writing reviews I have been applying stickers and I am happy I started doing it. Stickers do give the model it's finishing touch. BAGS WITH PARTS Thirteen bags with a total of 1219 parts (give or take a few) are supplied in the densily packed box. The rims and flex are sealed in a bag as well. Sometimes looking at the bags makes you wonder what the logic is, behind the distribution of the various parts across the different bags. Well this time it really got me confused. Take a look at two of the bags below. There's a bag containing all the 3L Blue Pins. Then there's a bag with various parts....and a single 3L Blue Pin. I figured this might be an error, but both of the sets have the same anomaly. TIRES The tires have been supplied unbagged, as usual. HIGHLIGHTED PARTS This chapter describes new and interesting parts. This set actually contains a lot of them. This set also contains an abundance of panels. If you aren't into panels, this isn't the set for you. CHANGEOVER CATCH This year (2015) the new changeover catch parts were released. It's a combination of three parts. The advantage of the new parts is that the red gear is the same on both sides, which avoids mounting it the wrong way around. It also avoids the changeover catch slipping out of the driving ring, like it used to do. You can apply lots of pressure, but the catch doesn't slip out. PINS Some of last year's new pins are also included in this set. 12 x Pin with Pin Hole and 21 x 3L Pin with 1L Axle. Securing Technic Beams can be quite simple with the new Pin with Pin Holes. The new 3L Pin with 1L Axle gives you more possibilities when connecting Beams and other parts. Below are two example situations where the new pins have been used. Granted, the examples below can be accomplished by using other techniques. However, some predicaments from the past can be easily solved by using these new parts. Like me, you will most likely appreciate the ease of use. ENGINE AND SUSPENSION Also included are two Steering Portal Hubs and Steering Portal Hubs with Ball Joint Arms and four Steering Portal Axles for driving and steering the vehicle. These parts are commonly used nowadays. The picture below also shows some other parts, like gear rack, steering arms and suspension. FRAMES This set comes with a single 5x7 Frame and three 5x11 Frames. PANELS This set contains a whopping 47 panels in three different colors. I personally like panels a lot and I do appreciate the variety we have at our disposal lately. This set even contains a new 13x3x2 Curved "Mudguard" Panel. NEW 13x3x2 CURVED PANEL This is the first set to contain the new 13x3x2 Curved Panel. Looking at the pictures doesn't do these panels justice. In real life they are actually quite big. I figured they would be smaller, but they are even longer than the 11 x 5 frame, with a length of 13 (including the attachment points). Hopefully this part will be available in other colors as well, preferably white, for adding variety to your EV3 robot. 19L WHITE FLEX-AXLES The White 19L Flex Axles have only been released in a single set, the 8461 Williams F1 Racer in 2002. Current prices on Bricklink are as high as 15 Euros! Needless to say we are very happy with the return of these White Axles. Now we can build Jeroen Ottens' awesome Alfa Romeo 4C Spider for a decent price as well. I am really happy that useful rare parts are being used more often by TLG designers PART LIST Here's the complete list for all 1219 parts. As you can see in the Highlighted parts section, this set contains a lot of interesting and useful parts. If you don't own sets like the 8070 - Supercar, this might be the set to pick up if you want to start building your own supercar. THE BUILD Enough with all the set and part information, let's build the model. REAR SUSPENSION The build starts with the rear suspension and drivetrain. As you can see in the picture below, the length of the Axle between the Steering CV Joint is 4L, where it usally is 3L. This is an indication that the finished model will be a bit bigger than usual (8070 for example). The finished suspension is one of the cleanest suspension setups I have seen in an official model. It's pretty basic, but it works like a charm. This setup is defintely worth using in your MOC. Here's a video: After attaching the suspension to the frame you rotate the module and secure it. At this stage the rear section of the chassis with suspension is almost finished. V8 MID-ENGINE Extending the chassis forward results in the picture below, where the front spoiler is already visible. What's also visible is the V8 engine placed right in front of the rear axle, resulting in a Mid-engine setup, perfectly suited for sports and race cars. Two exhaust pipes have been fitted on either side of the engine, together with two hoses attaching them to the engine. The instructions are easy to follow, although you sometimes you need to bend the beams a bit. Minor improvements are possible here and there, but nothing shocking. FRONT SUSPENSION The front suspension is a bit more complicated than the rear suspension, which makes sense considering the fact it contains the steering rack. The shock absorbers are placed in a different angle than the rear ones, resulting in a somewhat stiffer front suspension. All in all the front suspension is well designed and the steering rack can be easily powered with a Servo Motor. The picture belows shows the front suspension attached to the chassis. If you follow the official instructions to motorize the model, the area in front of the suspension is used to mount the battery box. When you are modding this model to make it Full RC this area can be used to mount the servo motor. GEARBOX Like the gearbox in the 8070, it's not used to switch gears powering the drivetrain. It's used to switch between two functions, opening the doors and the hood/bonnet. The gearbox is located at the left of the vehicle, near the cockpit. The mechanism to open the doors is located on the left side, while opening the hood/bonnet is taking place at the right side. To accomplish this, some axles traverse under the cockpit to the other side of the vehicle. Following the axles to other side of the vehicle and adding some gears, results in the situation below. The video below shows the gearbox in action. DOOR OPENING MECHANISM The mechanism to open the door is comprised of some Knob Wheels, Links without Stoppers and Pins with Towballs. Take a look at the doors opening and closing. THE FRONT Using the new mudguards and various other panels you finish the front of the car. The front is probably the most controversial part of the car. This is caused by the preliminary pictures shown before the release of this car. In the early pictures the front of the car had smooth curves and beautiful lines, while the final car lost these smooth lines and got a more blocky look in return. I must admit that at a first glance, the new design lost some of it's appeal. However, this model grew on me pretty rapidly. The headlight design can be found, in more or less the same way, on several real Le Mans type race cars. THE REAR The rear of the car looks great, with the stickers continuing from the mudguards to the panels underneath the spoiler. The two exhausts sticking out give some details to the back. I absolutely disagree with all the negativity surrounding this car. Maybe it's one of those models which needs to grow on you. FINISHED MODEL Here it is, the finished model. I know some of you don't like the looks of the car, but I think it looks great. The color scheme is outstanding. The new (for Technic) bright green parts, combined with white and black make this car look very vibrant and colorful. I am not a big fan of the green used in the 42008 - Service Truck, but I do like this bright green a lot. It fits perfectly well with the Mindstorms EV3 set. The curves on the side of the car are not as smooth as some of us hoped, but I still think the car looks more than acceptable from the side. The stickers add some nice details to the car, giving it that characteristic race car look. The model looks great in pictures, but it does even look better in real life. I love this picture of the front of the car. However, I do wonder if a dedicated 24 hour Le Mans Racer has the seat and steering positioned off-center?! Using the good ol' Google Machine I come to the conclusion that they do have centered seating and steering, at least the majority of them. There's ample space in the cabin, which makes me wonder why TLG decided to place the seat off-centered. The rear view looks cool too, with some of the suspension showing and the two exhaust pipes clearly visible. The bottom view is very useful to determine the size of the car in studs. It measures approx 59 x 27 studs. The chassis looks organized and well designed. The engine has been placed close to the ground, which is perfect for the weight distribution. A low center of gravity improves the handling of the car. I really enjoyed building this baby. The build is very clean and organized, although there are some steps where you need to bend the beams a bit to get things into place. Seeing the model come to life and seeing it grow to pretty impressive proportions is very satisfying. For me it was fun, but I reckon kids will go nuts over this set and the build. SIZE COMPARISON What became obvious during the build, but what's emphasized when you have finished the model, is that it's quite big! The size of the car is pretty impressive. The pictures below show the car next to the 42030 - Volvo L350F. The side view emphasizes the size of the car. It's even longer than the Volvo, if you dismiss the bucket. PARTS LEFT Some parts left. Nothing out of the ordinary. FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS Unlike the B-model, this model doesn't implement any unexpected features. The functions it does implement are exactly what you would expect from any car. Steering (HoG) Working fake engine Suspension Opening doors (gullwing style) Opening bonnet/hood Opening trunk Gearbox for switching between functions Unfortunately the steering wheel hasn't been linked to the HoG (Hand of God) steering mechanism. Placing the seat in the center would have provided an easy way to link the steering wheel to the steering mechanism. it's a shame we hardly see actual steering anymore. Opening the hood actually opens up the entire rear section of the car, providing you with easy access to the motor compartment. The mechanism to open the hood works properly, which results in smooth opening and closing of it. The same goes for the gullwing style doors. Both functions are operated manually and you need to switch with the lever to the left of the cockpit. These two functions are also the ones which can be motorized by placing an M-motor near the cockpit and a battery box in the trunk. All things considered I think this car offers lots of playability. The model is solidly built and the functions are easy to operate. I'd say it's pretty safe to let your kids play with it. B-MODEL Unlike the A-model, the B-model for this set received (almost) universal acclaim, and I can see why. Often the B-model is a pale shadow of it's part donor. In this case the model looks so good, it could be a model of it's own. It even incorporates a neat feature, which actually deserves to be in the A-model. There's a lot a variation in the quality of digital building instructions TLG is providing, but these ones are of very high quality. The picture below shows most of the chassis with suspension, fake engine and gearbox in place. FINISHED MODEL Some concessions have been made, but overall the car looks fantastic. The black of the roof has been extrapolated from the hood, which definitely works for me. The rear section of the car feels a bit empty, but the panels do cover up most of it, so it's hardly noticeable. The V8 stickers will be upside down if you use the parts from the A-model. Since I could apply new stickers, I have placed them using the proper orientation. The bottom of the car shows the chassis. It's obviously a bit smaller than the A-model's chassis. FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS Taking the functions into account, this model isn't playing second fiddle to the A-model. Besides the obvious functions like steering, opening doors and hood, this car features folding fog lights, which deserve a better podium than a B-model. Steering (Hog) Working fake engine Suspension Opening doors (manually) Opening hood/bonnet (manually) Opening trunk (operated by gear) Folding fog lights (operated by gear) Gearbox (used to switch functions) FOG LIGHTS One of the most interesting features of the B-model are the folding Fog Lights. It almost feels a bit weird that a feature like this is implemented in the B-model, instead of the A-model. Below are 4 steps showing how the mechanism works. I have also included a video. The mechanism is somewhat reminiscent of fork mechanism used in the 8109 - Flatbed Truck, which has been described in Efferman's Review. Take a look at the video to the fog lights in action. PARTS LEFT A fair number of parts left, which isn't uncommon for a B-model. SUMMARY To summarize how I feel about this set, you need to take a look at the picture below. The combined image reflects the quality of this set....or better yet....sets! You actually get two great models, for the price of one. You don't like the A-model? No problem, you can have lots of fun with the B-model. I can't stop playing with the fog lights, it's mesmarizing. The color scheme on both models is outstanding. I simply can't emphasize enough how well this color scheme pleases the eye. The regular green is dull and boring, but this bright green really pops out, especially when combined with black and white, and possibly some red details. Black, white and a little red?! Sounds familiar? Yes, bright green can easily be combined with your EV3 robots. So while you are combining the bright green with your robot, why not use the great new curved "mudguard" panels. These new panels are introduced in this set and they look great. They open up a lot of possibilities in the design department. The build of the A-model is outstanding. It is fairly simple, but since it's so clean, I really enjoyed it a lot. I think the build should be entertaining, which doesn't mean it needs to be a real challenge. And let's be honest; when is a build really challenging?! The rear suspension is a good example of why I liked the build. It's very simple, yet very effective. Works like a charm. The same goes for the other functions in both models. And the star of the entire show can be found in the B-model. How's that for a surprise?! Being aware of the fact that I like this model a lot better than most of you seem to do, I really encourage you to give this model a chance. The sheer size is impressive, the color scheme is awesome and you get a bonus model, which is actually worth building. SCORE Okay, so how do I grade this set? 8 DESIGN Open to debate, but I like it a lot. 8 BUILDING EXPERIENCE Fun and clean build. 9 FEATURES Superb function in B-model steels the show. 9 PLAYABILITY Both models offer lots of playability 8 PARTS Lots of new parts and cool existing parts. 10 VALUE FOR MONEY Two models for the price of one. 8,7 TWICE THE FUN I hope you enjoyed this review! More pictures can be found on my Flickr page.	neutral
Outstanding review Jim, congrats ! Love the pictures, so clean and crisp . Hope to see many more of your reviews. As for the set, after seeing this review I kind of like it, if I will find it at a decent price, I will get it for sure.	positive

Any comments on which functions can be converted to PF and how well they work? Actually yes! I am in the midst of making a PF version. I will post a picture of the setup I have so far. This setup is for driving the chassis and it works pretty fine!	positive
Great review,I am still undecided whether to get this set or not.	positive
I think this set will be my next purchase. I love the color scheme and indeed it looks like a nice set. Also 1200 parts for EUR 100 is not a bad deal. And yes, the looks of the car have really grown on my since the first official pictures appeared. I'm curious how the bright green will work combined with other colors than white. I really hope more sets in the future will use the color (so that more different parts will be available over time). I think I'm the only person on Eurobricks who doesn't like the looks of the B model, but I appreciate the extra functionality it offers. Besides the set itself, I think this is one of the best reviews I have read in a while. Great job on the superb photographs (which I think are essential to a review) and the extensiveness of it all. You really touched every subject, which is great :D	positive
Fantastic review Jim, from the quality of the review alone it is easy to see how much hard work you have put into it. I'm with you on the instruction manual, I much prefer one quality bound book over umpteen stapled booklets. Already have 2 of these sitting in the build queue, one for display model as I'm a fan of this one and one to build the B model then dissemble for parts, so I'm already sold on his set but still very much enjoyed taking the time it deserves to read through the review and ogle at your pro photography.	positive
I was very skeptical of this set because I really thought the redesign degraded the looks of the A-model a lot, but after building it I must say this is an excellent set. Good job TLG!	positive
A very professional review and really no stone unturned. But I'm still not going to rush out and buy a copy	positive
Awesome review Jim! I love the pictures. I don't like how LEGO did this model though. Too many compromises Edited by Omikron, 13 March 2015 - 07:24 AM.	neutral
Sinner, on Aug 3 2007, 01:20 AM, said: Thank you vey much for this review. I do have some questions; 1. What are the white clutches geared into? 2. Is the engine geared to one or both drive motors? 3. How well does it go on carpet? 4. Can it doze without breaking the blade? The clutches are for the shovel and claw on the front and back The engine is driven from only one of the drive motors. It works fine on our rugs but we have mainly wood floors. Not sure if is fairly strong I have only chased the cat at the moment :'-(	neutral

The pins and axles did seem a bit difficult in putting them into place. A problem I have been having is the batterys are done after about 4 hours of play, which I really wish they would last longer :-( . Overall it is a stupendous set and it is really nice to see our old friend the studs make a return! You found it in the U.S.???? Where?? I'm really liking this set! Its looking better now that i'm seeing more of it at differnt angles. I'mvery curious how wellit pulls, and and can push/doze before the clutches start slipping.	positive
Thank you very much for that neat review, Ickelpete! *y* Your pictures?re very interesting and your video?s really good.

Very nice review Sinner! *y* *wub* So we are getting more and more reviews with figs in it, that?s great! :'-) I actually wanted to skip this technic set, but your review made me think again. I haven?t seen you posting a price, so I will do that for you :-P : It?s (just) 9,99? in Germany.	negative
A very nice review of a very good little set, thanks Sinner! *y*	positive
Cute. Do mine eyes deceive me, or is it actually Minifig scale?	positive
Thanks for the review, your video was very well done, seeing those sticker sheets is daunting.	positive
Thanks for the review. I can't help but think the minifigures are the weak part of the set. Snake and Apu are great but the rest.... I don't know. They kinda redundant now. They could at least give us new torso printing, like Homer wearing his jacket or Bart wearing his blue t-shirt or Marge wearing her coat. Or, as I said in the discussion thread, I'd have included Jasper in CMF series 2 and a Frozen version here. Overall, the set looks kinda smaller than what I thought. (Snake's bag needed a $ symbol printed, because it looks like he is stealing gargabe ) Pretty good review overall	positive
Can you post a pic of it next to the simpsons house? just curious about size comparisons...	positive
I have sooo mixed feeling about that... I loved the Simpsons House (save for the terrible wall in the Homer and Marge's room), but this so far is inferior in almost every aspect. The walls made of panels is a bummer. I expect a D2C set to be better that this. 60+ stickers? The same thing. Same price for less bricks and smaller build then the house. Strange coloured bricks on the outside wall (some ugly mix of yellow + tan) Panels again with their fronts facing towards the inside of the shop so we and up with those squares all around. The walls are yellow, this was so nice, lost opportunity to make it in some other less common colour. Then again the set overall looks is good. The roof is a nice detail. The shop looks actually like a real one, not just an approximation of one. The roof tiles are in Dark Orange - we got new/rare colour here The car looks interesting to build (just like the pink one from the house) Lots of nice references to the show It's The Simpsons! Definitely a must buy... but for a discounted price. I'll try to find one with maybe damaged box or after-display copy. Edited by Mestari, 14 April 2015 - 01:15 PM.	negative

But looking at it now I think the tan/yellow is supposed to represent where the paint is fading on the back of the store? I guess?	positive
One thing that may justify the price: it has 527 different parts (if I counted correctly). I alway heard the more different parts the more difficult the set is to produce. The Simpsons House already had an astonishig amount of different pieces, but this one is even more extreme...	negative
I like this set a lot better than the Simpsons house, but 60+ stickers is just incredibly disappointing. It seems quite a few of them could have been printed parts	positive
Great review.	positive
Nice review, I'm building it (need to finish it, but I'm at work right now) With the printed piece, you forgot to show the chocolat milk 1x1 brick, which is exclusive to this set yet (it isn't referenced on bricklink yet, only the blue one) The set is really fun to build, with a lot of little pieces for the fridges. I haven't put the stickers yet, will see the final product to put the essentials ones	positive
Nice review of a surprisingly interesting set. *y* Those windows are great, and no doubt difficult to get. Classic coffee maker, simple yet exactly right. That baseplate was in a few other sets, but never with that pattern. Would have made a great base for some of the classic 80s houses LEGO used to treat us to. In tan was part of the Adventurers Egypt sets. As recently as 2001 it was a base for Ogel. Versatile plate that hopefully hasn't disappeared completely. ParaPink is apparently "Light Pink" on Brickshelf, so I guess it's just lighter than normal pink (and stopped appearing in 1995. Just so you know, that monkey is drinking too much and likely to fall in the pool ... ;-)	positive

Yes my SpongeBob fans, its time for another review !! Lets look at our Bikini Bottom map and head strait to meet Miss Puff at her Boating school. She is waiting for us to give us a guided tour of her establishment ;-) Another bit of SB history: this set comes from the following episode: Boating School: SpongeBob fails his boating test for the 38th time (what a freaking retard lool). He's so determined to get his license that Patrick decides to help him. He implants a walkie-talkie inside SB?s head in order to cheat and tell him what to do. You will say that I am biais but I really enjoy building this set and I really like the SB theme !! Lets hope 2008 brings more of that cool spongieness !! But I digress... Here are general pics of the instruction booklet and the DSS (G there are loads of crappy stickers in that one also !!). As you can see the set is divided in 3 polybags. Shamelessly (but nonetheless wilfully hehe), I will disregard the third one which is that playability crap course !! I would have reviewed it but since it involves stickers, I didn?t want to ruin the parts and without stickers it would look dull, plain and ugly (it does look crappy with so imagine without), so that review will not be 100% complete and I do apologise in advance. But how many of you would have build that and keep it hehe Off :-P 1/ Mfs and extras I will start with the really cool Miss Puff *wub* (the fig mind you !!). She looks a bit stressed !! No wonder, that sponge menace will bring her to the hospital once again hehe. As you can see, that MF comprises 3 parts: the small blue 1x1 round and the 2 major parts. Yeay another great stupid looking SB. I love those idiotic faces !! 3 different SB figs and 3 idiotic faces hehe. You never can get enough of them !! Here is just a regular Patrick. Too bad Patrick doesn?t have different expressions ! The pull back boat car: nothing really to report (except the fact that I left it sticker free !!) The only thing I built from the third polybag is that pretty cool ancker holding tower thingie !! Looks great in a lighthouse set hehe. Yes the roud tile bouey is printed !! Its the same as in SB's bed in the Bikini Bottom set ;-) OK, its time for those two great buildings: the lighthouse and the school + pontoon !! Before reviewing them individually, here is a general pic. 2/ The lighthouse One of the main reason to own that great set !! Sure it suffers from accute stickeretite (sad but :-D ). T worst is that door), but nonetheless a great and simple building !! Great white/red colour scheme, and a really fantastic 2 turning lights !! I really like the yellow top of the lighthouse, it adds to the comic atmosphere of that theme instead of having a more plain red/white only. The rear has nothing really fancy, except tools to fix it in case of problems hehe. The only thing I modified since I didn?t build the third polybag is that I got rid of the trechnic parts on the right of the lighthoue to replace them with regular ?logs? All hail the tower King !! :-D 3/ The school and pontoon I really like that little building and its great to see that once again TLC uses the amazing dark blue color !! Its really a simple design but looks fantastic and can be used for many things in a town hehe I also really like the combination with those dark bluish grey slopes !! The rear reveals the desk, stickers on the wall (d?oh !!) and two clams serving as chairs (really like on the show). Its really great to see that TLC stays really as close to the show as possible. The pontoon again is simple yet really cool and effective. And its really nice to have 2 lifesaving boueys. The only thing I modified since I didn?t build the third polybag is that I got rid of the trechnic parts in front of the pontoon to replace them with regular ?logs? On the overall, I think its really a great set !! Apart from the crap stickers, I think TLC should have ditched (or simplified) the third playability polybag to lower the cost !! Oh well, parts are always usefull (except those one part shitty palm trees !!). So until my next review, I bid you farewell my Spongebob fans !! And I really hope to see next year hehe Will SB get his driver?s license one day ? For the sake of Bikini Bottom, lets hope not !! No license ever On !! *yoda*	positive
I like this one better than the other one for parts and such, plus I'm generally a sucker for any different minifig, but yeah, that price is steep. Great review though!	positive
One more SB face - YEAH *wub*! Being a lighthouse freak I really like it, the trans clear blue ones rocks *y*! I?m getting it - period! SB On copmike	positive
Nice review !! I'm not a big fan of those Spongebob figs. However this set has some very useful pieces. This is actually the first time I took a decent look at a Spongebob set.	positive
Nice review mate, the set look's great and a real must for all those SB fan's out there. The whole set scream playability that's for sure, which is great because let's be honest their's gonna be alot of kid's and *yoda* out their playing with it :-P X-D ;-) . Geezzzzz what is it with all those bloody stikers? This set would be soooooo much better with printed piece's instead of those, still once your over that at least the rest is ok. Am i the only one who thinks Mrs Puff kinda look's like a kinder egg toy? Their's nothing wrong with that mind you (yes i have a kinder problem X-D ) just seem's strange to me.	positive

The set, and the other Designer sets that came out with it (especially 4888) are incredibly well designed sets. I wish Lego would go back to doing sets like these as I loved the multitude of instructions and ideas. The last batch of Creator sets had zero ideas, even though I know several were made. :'-( Anyway, less whining, more review. The lion is the main model. His mouth doesn't fully close, but it does open more. The head works well from most angles. I love the dark orange bricks; great for rust... He is quite solid, but the joints take the weight well. The neck goes side to side and rotates, but doesn't go up and down. The body is built in two parts and pinned in the middle. With what is left you can make what I think is a hyena, a silly plant MOC... ...and what I believe is a vulture. There are also instructions for a few other models including a bat, boar and a snake... which I quite like. He can be built at the same time as... ...this cute little lizard. Overall this is a great set with an excellent blend of colours and pieces. I wanted it for steampunk potentials. *sweet* I hope you liked the review. Till next time....	positive
The lizard looks the best to me - put him in a town and you've got a monster terrorising the residents. Dr. S.	positive
Great review as always! *y* LEGO is timeless, so there is no such thing as an old set. I never build brick monsters/creatures, but this set had such a nice assortment of parts that I had to pick a couple up as they weren't clearancing out on Shop @ Home. I absolutely love dark orange and tan, so it was an automatic win. I love the use of "familiar characters" in the review, I can almost hear Hinckley screaming, "my megabloks!" :-P You sort of look like you're planning some vulture stew though. Might have to start a new challenge to determine a winner there. Sinner and his Big Pot o' Doom VS Giant Vulture! Only thing is, does everything horrify the Mrs? She seems perpetually shocked and/or dismayed at the goings on here. Now that I think about it, I can see why. I'm occasionally shocked and/or dismayed 8-? Brick Built Beasties On! *y*	positive
A very fine review of a very fine set, thanks Sinner. *y* The variety of cool colors in that set?s just formidable. One more beautiful Creator set indeed! Roaarrrr on! :'-)	positive
Thank you for the nice review, Sinner! I also bought this set but in combination with 4883 when it was on sale (50% - hurray!) at S@H. I made a short review of 4883 but wasn?t really sure what to tell about 4884. So I?m glad you did that for me. :-D I have different feelings about this set. On the one hand I love the lion. He is really impressive (even my wife -not known for being Lego enthusiastic- asked me, if there were more animals of this kind). The lion is - restricted - poseable and the colors used are fantastic. *wub* 3 models can be built simultaneously - that?s great! On the other hand I still don?t know what to do with these rotation joints. *wacko* And the other models are somehow disappointing compared to the lion. I seem to have missed the little lizard. :-$ I put it on my "to do-list". Like all the Creator sets: Great parts pack - but wait until they get on sale! X-D For me - I had a lot more fun with 4883. Indeed: Roarrrr ON! ;-)	neutral

Ahhh...... *sweet* Holodoc, on Aug 16 2007, 10:43 PM, said: I have different feelings about this set. On the one hand I love the lion. He is really impressive (even my wife -not known for being Lego enthusiastic- asked me, if there were more animals of this kind). The lion is - restricted - poseable and the colors used are fantastic. *wub* 3 models can be built simultaneously - that?s great! On the other hand I still don?t know what to do with these rotation joints. *wacko* And the other models are somehow disappointing compared to the lion. Well, I will have to get back to you on what I do with it. :-P I do agree though that most of the other models are not worth making. I made the snake because in the instructions he is shown terrorising the lizard... >:-)	positive
I was really kidding, of course you want to keep it. Who wouldn't? ;-) I was going to buy it off of BL anyway. X-D Now, if lego made a theme about Creator animals, that would be great. *sweet*	neutral
LEGO 75915 Pteranodon Capture I'm glad to review this nice set; 75915 Pteranodon Capture Name: Pteranodon Capture Set Number: 75915 Pieces: 174 Price: $19.99 Minifigs: 2 Theme: Jurassic World Year of Release: 2015 Links: Box The front of the box has the Jurassic World logo along with the set number, piece count, etc. Its a decent box size for a $20 set. Here it is compared to a minifigure. Here's the back of the box. It shows all of the features from the set an ad for the video game. The back also shows a small picture with a silhouette of the dinosaurs from the line, along with their set numbers. Instruction Booklet The booklet shows the same thing as the front of the box, nothing more, nothing less. Near the back of the booklet, there is a picture with all of the characters from the sets. The other page shows all the dinosaurs with a mini box that shows the size comparisons. The Minifigures The minifigures in this set are Simon Masrani and an ACU. Both of them have excellent printing on the front and the back. The gun is the same one from TLM that the SSP used. Simon Masrani is the only one with a double sided face. His second face shows a scared/worried exp<b></b>ression. He has a zipped up jacket or jumpsuit with a shirt underneath. The ACU trooper only has one face which is a scared/worried exp<b></b>ression. I would have a scared exp<b></b>ression too if I was about to get eaten by a dinosaur. He has great detail on his torso and legs. Let's take a look at the vest. The vest is the same mold from the SSP in TLM I think. It has the letters ACU on the front too. The back is nothing interesting. Pteranodon The pteranodon has great printing too. The colors match the ones that the pteranodons from the movie have. The wings, mouth, and head are a rubbery type of plastic and are easily bendable. It uses the same mold from the pteranodon in the 2012 Dino line. Here's a comparison between the two. Spare Parts The spare parts aren't many, just a few extras. The Helicopter At first the helicopter was 'meh' when I first saw it on the box. Now that I've built it, I've got to say that I really like it. Its my favorite helicopter of all of the ones I've built. Its sturdy and sleek. It's not too bulky either. The first play feature in this set is the net launcher. It works pretty well, not one of my favorite features but it does what it's meant to do. The other play feature is on the other side. Its a stud shooter which can be used by a minifigure. You can put it on their hand or you can leave it there and let someone operate it. The shooter can fold up inside the helicopter as well. There are stickers on both sides of the helicopter and they also have the Jurassic World logo with Dino marks. Final Verdict Value: 9/10 - For $20 this set isn't that bad. The parts count is a little low for a $20 set but the price is probably because of licensing. Other than that, it's a great deal, I would've hoped for maybe some bait for the pteranodon but that can easily be fixed. Design: 9/10 - I REALLY love the way this helicopter looks, it's sleekness and design is great. The only flaw this has is the huge net launcher, it's too big in my opinion. Minifigs: 10/10[/b] - The minifigures are extremely detailed and it even includes an exclusive minifigure. Playability: 9/10 - There are many things you can do with this set. The swoosh factor is great and so are the play features. Parts: 10/10[/b] - They're useful parts and there isn't many huge specialized pieces in here either. Overall: 9/10 - This set is great for fans of Jurassic World, it's also a nice parts pack. There's one exclusive minifigure in here too which makes it even better. Having a little fun with the set Hope you liked my first review here on Eurobricks! Please leave any suggestions on what to improve, thanks! Edited by TheLazyChicken, 02 May 2015 - 10:19 PM.	positive
I love the dinos in these sets but aside from that the builds IMO kind of suck just like the last Dino sets. This just has a franchise connected to it. And honestly I hope it does well enough to spark more Dino/Jurassic Park-World interest because I want to see MORE Dino "minifigures". Maybe a Brontosaurus or something. I will most likely be buying many of the Dinosaur minifigures here. However I doubt I'll buy the actual sets or the genetically altered dinosaur (which can only work for Jurassic World). This set is IMO average. Love the dinosaur...	negative
Nice review! Although, that picture of the ad reminded me of how some of the things surrounding Jurassic World (Lego, that is) seems hastily put together. Just look at that the minifig. He is Star Lord's head and hair, Indiana Jones' torso with different arms, and City legs. To me, that seems a bit weak, especially for a video game.	neutral
Yesterday I went to Toys 'r Us and bought the Dilophosaur Ambush. Beside that the shop had a display of the JW polybags. For €3,49 I picked up two of them. Now here is my little review of this pretty nice set. First some data: Line: Jurassic World Year: 2015 Pieces: 29 Price: €3,49 Packaging: Polybag Ok, lets start with the polybag itself. It is a standard size and had plenty of room for all the parts. The front depicts the whole set with a little hexagon on the right with a seperate picture of the dinosaur and its name. In this case the Celophysis is called Gallimimus. Weird choice Next is the instruction sheet. It is a doublesided paper with every building step in clear sight. The part selection is nice. There are only a few but all of them are pretty usefull for all kind of builds. There are two parts which stood-out. Both are printed tiles. The first one is the yellow/black warning tile in 1x4. You can't have enough of that. The second one is a 2x2 tile with the Jurassic World logo on it. That's pure awesome. The bigger sets seem to have only sticker for that, so this little set is a perfect way to get hold of this nice tile. The leftovers. Nothing special. Here is the complete trap. It is a basic build and functions pretty well. In the end the parts are more interesting as the build so it will definitely end up as a parts-pack. Now on to the star of this bag. The Celophysis/Gallimimus. I don't know why Lego decided to call this dinosaur mold any different, but I think it has to do with movie-connection and the will to not produce a new mold. Nevermind, this figure is great and the colour is very bright and totally stood out. Pretty beastie. A comparison between the 2015 Gallimimus and the 2012 Celophysis. The final set in all its glory. Final verdict: It is a great little set. The parts used a nice and usefull. The printed tiles are the secret stars of this set and the dinosaur is fun two. With a few packs of these you could easily build a Celophysis pack with lots of Jurassic World signs on their way. Highly recommended.	positive
I'm pleased to see that this is available for purchase, at least in some parts of the world, rather than only being available with the JW game. Nice review, I'll going to scope out whether Toys R Us in Sweden is carrying them, although I've never seen polybags in there before.	neutral
Nice I had to buy the JW Lego game to get mine.	neutral
This seems like half of a set compared to the previous Bike Shop/Cafe. As I like many of the elements, I will probably buy a second one and build a mirror image version (making one entirely a toy shop and the other a book store/news stand) and adjust the sidewalks to work with the previous model. Then I think they will work well together. I remember a little area in Copenhagen that had this sort of architecture. I would hope the subsequent models are better deigned to create more complex alternatives, but these are both good starting points for original or enhanced models.	neutral
Informative review, thanks! *y* As usual, it makes a fairly good parts pack. Wish I could pick up a few on deep discount, but at full price one is fine. I do like the 'stewards' and some of the workmen. Overall, I think I'm looking more forward to the Belville calendar, just for it's assortment of unusual parts. Ugh. Belville. Still, parts are parts, and it's got some. Phoinix summed up one of the most common complaints I hear about all of the lines in 3 simple words ... "no girls....AGAIN!" Good job, now get LEGO to listen. ;-)	positive

Thanks Andy for the review! I prefer the city advent calendar 2006 a lot! Those mini sets are nor good for me! The "road subtheme" sets are nice, but the others, not so good! The 05 version waf ok, the 06 version was better, with bigger sets, and more building ones! And the 07 is poor! It's just 2-3 pieces to put together on 2x4 plates... Where are the gardening accessories? Where are some nice small constructions that you can put in your layout like a mailbox or an orodator? And the chrismas tree looks :-X IMO! And no santa... *y* for Andy *n* for this calendar	negative
I'm a big fan of anime and have watched some mechas like Full Metal Panic, Neon Evangelion: Genesis (it is a mecha!) and Chobits (Well... She is a robot...), so I was curious to see what this new Exo Force line was all about. The colorful sets and manga-like characters didn't persuade me right away, but the urgent need for a couple of white 3x3 wing plates made me purchase this little thing. It cost me 70 DKR as you can see on the box. This is 9.30 euro, or about the same an American has to pay for the new Republic Cruiser. Pretty expensive for so few pieces (90 + a spare technic pin) The box An action-packed box with one of the sides being oddly empty except from the LEGO-logo. What's inside There is a small building instruction, two polybags (no bag building here) and a sticker sheet with alarmingly many stickers. The build It takes so little time to build this set that I didn't get to take any pictures of the process. Every step was accompanied by an element description although I doubt most of you will need that with so few pieces to keep track on. Most of the dark green bricks have a sticker - even the slopes where the rough surface makes stickers fall off easily! There should also have been a sticker on the windshield, but I wanted to keep that piece clean for better usage later. (I'm one of those who keeps stickers on the bricks) The model You want to see this model from the front, as the back is pretty much neglected There isn't much for the pilot to grab a hold on either. He is pretty much a sitting duck up there with the screen giving him only partial cover. There is a huge wrench next to him which kind of symbolizes the crudeness of the mech. The set isn't called "Cyclone Defender" for nothing. The right arm might hold an ordinary light assault riffle, but the other has a spinning disc with samurai swords which you can turn with the yellow knob on the backside. Those of you who have seen Robot Wars might remember the incredible power of this melee weapon from a robot named Hypnodisc. It would have been nice had there been a pull-back motor to power the disc (I'm sure LEGO has a lot of these in stock), but the simple mechanism still works reasonably well. The riffle comes off and a pin makes it easy to hold with the hand, but the disc is fixed to the arm. It is also a problem that the swords get misaligned quickly during play. The minifig I really like this minifig because of the neat idea with an expression on each side that LEGO has made a standard for Exo Force. Posability Most mech-moc'ers show off their creations using Gundam-like poses. With two joints per leg (one being the ankles) and one for an arm I thought of some less serious poses: Crawling (Silent like a ninja!): Belly gliding: Kick off!; Upside down: Final Rating I have to disappoint you here. This is my first set in this line and I have absolutely no idea of how good it is. The last robot I bought was the awesome 6889 Spyrius Recon Robot for the same price, but it is in a completely different genre. The set had what I expected (two white wings) and is as such a no-nonsense set. I guess it would be of more use if you have some more Exo Force, which I don't. 6/10 Ups: Has great minifig, weapons and is easy to build. Downs: Crude design and a bit too expensive for what you get. (Brickshelf gallery)	neutral
Nice review :) But... You paid HOW much? This set is priced around 7 Euros here in Germany, which is a very fair price for what you get in my oppinion. It?s a little disappointing though, that I couldn?t think of any alternate builds for this set, and there are no inspirations on the box or the EF website.	neutral
I guess that?s what some people refer to as "sarcasm" ;)	neutral
Thanks! I was planning on doing this review but I have been a bit swamped lately. :-$ Great review of a great set. It isn't too hard to convert the plane to Mini-fig size either. (Sorry I forgot to take photos...) I might add some photos to your review....	positive
Great review Lasse D. A definite two *y* up. I bought this set for the swing-wing concept. I was very curious what TLC's design was like. I have been working on modifying it just a little to look more like the F-14. So far I have completed the back section, but I need to finish the cockpit. Overall this is a great set. I *wub* TLC's swing-wing concept. Model On!!	positive
this is a really great set! when i first saw it i thought "oh a silly small plane who needs that" and then i got it and i am very happy that i did! this is one of the best designed lego creator sets! and it was designed by the designer of the Cafe-Corner!!!!	positive

Thanks everyone! DarthBrickus, on 13 September 2015 - 02:53 PM, said: Thanks for the review, i've had that set for quite a while, and it's among my favorite Marvel Superheroes Sets actually. Compared to the other stuff we usually get to accompany the minifigs... All those "Laboratorys", the most recent Construction Site, and the "Hydra Fortress" .. yeah... You're being a little harsh here Perhaps you're right, maybe I was a bit too harsh on this set. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad set, especially compared to some other sets we have gotten in this price range, but somehow I was still expecting more. DarthBrickus, on 13 September 2015 - 02:53 PM, said: Maybe you're still suffering from PTSD after watching Fant-Four-Stic! I still have not seen it actually (and I don't ever plan to).

Again, he's definitely the best part of this set.	neutral
This set seems to appeal more to the non superhero crowd. It is one of the only marvel sets I bought. Mainly because I thought that the building was a nice return to the old style of city sets. I would love to see this sort of backdrop for a more realistic agents theme... I also liked that most of the figs in this set were easier to merge into other (non-super) uses...

Good idea to make this review while you build the set. I'll be monitoring your progress and feedback. The box so huge! Impressive!	positive
The Manual: The gigantic manual measures 17? x 12? and is almost an inch thick. It is spiral bound with a cardboard like front and back and it is 314 pages. Interesting decision not to break it up into multiple manuals. It is almost unwieldy at this size and thickness. Unfortunately, the manual is not available electronically from the LEGO website. Hopefully, it will be soon. Missing were the little instructions at the beginning telling you to not build this beast on shag carpet and to sort out the 5,000+ pieces before you get started. I guess they figure if you got $500 to spend on this thing, you can build it however you want. As usual, we get the regular LEGO manual features: - Piece call outs for each step - Parts inventory at the end of the manual - Page numbers - Photos of all the other 2007 sets at the end of the manual Manual (paperback book provided for scale) Various manual photos (8x8 plate provided for scale) I'm about 2 hours into building and sorting. I'm trying to stay a day ahead in my posting. The build has been easier than I thought so far. Despite the massive number of pieces, it has not been too hard to sort and find what you need. Build photos will start appearing in tomorrow's entry.	positive
Nice idea, reviewing the set while constructing it. This is the top of the bill for any lego-collector (also financially speaking..) and I like the look of all those thousands of pieces. The manual is incredible, I thought I had a really thick manual coming with set 8479, but this one exceeds it with ease... Review on!	positive
good review. *y* Me, I can't build it before Saturday. :'-(	positive
The Build: The build is going quicker than I thought. I am sorting as I open the bags that I need. Some bags are in multiples so it is easy to pick them out. The build is a tad repetitive as the framework of the ship is somewhat symmetrical. Here are some progress shots: Note that two plates (1x4 and 1x8) are stacked in between Technic beams. Then the part below is assembled to hold the structure together. This took about an hour of sorting and building: I'll post another update tomorrow.	positive

Thank you for the review Sinner. At first I wanted this set for the 4 blue 1x1 slope tiles, but I can see there is much more into it than that. It sure is a great value compared to what you get in the Building Bonanzas (no cars and less detail). It was funny to see the little side story in your pictures. Would it be hard to modify the cars to fit minifigs better?	neutral
Awesome review! Luckily you have two cute little friends and one beautiful lady to help you out! :-P I likewise love *wub* this set and your review does it credit!

Excellent review with great pics and cameo appearances by some of our EB favs *y* Definitely a set that was on my 'to get' list already, and this only confirms that.

Thanks for this review Sinner! I love this house, with the nicely made tiled corners, the colorscheme and the garage. The only thing I dislike about this set is the way the windows are attached in train windows (so they turn inwards a little) instead of the usual frames with shutter-attachment-ability. But that is something that can be fixed in the blink of an eye. I will certainly buy this house some day when I find it at reasonable price.	positive

Thanks for the review Sinner! I definitely want this set now. The mixed rough and smooth roof bricks would annoy me on a model like the MTT, but here it looks as is if the roof is quite old with some parts being worn and pitted and some parts being replaced with new roof tiles.

It's that time of year again when the days get shorter, the nights get colder, and children all around the world stare longingly into warmly lit toy shops and prepare their wishlist to send to Santa. This is also the time when The Lego Group releases their latest Winter Village set which has been an annual tradition for the past seven years. These sets have been very popular, especially among AFOLs, and are always highly anticipated. However, while some entries in this series have been more popular than others, none has been as controversial as this year's set, the Winter Toy Shop, which is a re-release of the first Winter Village set, 10199 Winter Toy Shop from 2009. It seems that many think that this set didn't need to be remade and would have preferred a new set instead, or that it is not different enough from the original and will be redundant in a completionist's collection. Does it deserve all the hate? Let's find out. Disclaimer: I don't own the 2009 version, so I can't compare them visually, but I will do my best to let you know what is different in this version. If you do need a visual reference, you can refer to Svelte's excellent review of the original. Set Number: 10249 Name: Winter Toy Shop Theme: Creator Year of Release: 2015 Pieces: 898 Minifigs: 8 Price: £59.99 / $79.99 / 69.99€ S@H description: Quote Welcome to the Winter Toy Shop! The holiday season has arrived and the toymaker is busy finishing off his latest creations! Outside, children ski and snowboard, and a freshly built snowman sparkles in the light that shines from the toyshop tower. Help decorate the huge tree that stands at the center of the square, play with the curious kitten on the cozy wooden bench or join in with the carolers beneath the ornate streetlamp. This charming set also features a ladder, trees in various sizes, jack-in-the-box, a toy biplane, helicopter, rocket, train, race car, truck, robot, tugboat, teddy bear and a wrapped gift. Have fun building this enchanting winter wonderland! Includes a snowman and 8 minifigures with assorted accessories: a male caroler, female caroler, a woman, 2 men, 2 boys and a girl. S@H Bricklink Brickset The Box The box art of this set is similar to that of the original, but there are some notable differences. The Christmas tree is on the right side of the image this time while the park bench is on the left and of course it features this year's design for Creator boxes with the dark blue stripe along the right side and the "Expert" logo in the top right corner. There's also a small picture of the back of the toy shop and the background looks less cartoony than on the original. The back is also very similar, showing a different angle of the toy shop along with some close-ups, although this time there is no minifig lineup. Instead, the minifig lineup is on the right side of the box. It also includes the accessories that each minifig comes with and some of the toys. On the left side of the box there is a thumbnail of the box art and the set name in six different languages. They also want to make sure that you know that there are batteries included by saying it in dozens of languages. The top of the box features the inventory and a 1:1 scale reference with the female caroler. On the bottom there is a picture that reminds you that there is a light brick included in this set, in case that wasn't clear from the front of the box, and it confirms that yes, it is a bad idea to put it in water, in case you were planning to go swimming with your Winter Toy Shop. The Contents Inside the box there are two instruction booklets and two groups of bags, one for each instruction booklet. While two groups of bags is not as many as there usually are in other sets of this size, it's still better than the first version of this set where the bags weren't numbered at all, so this makes the build a bit easier. The large bag in Group 1 and the two large bags in Group 2 have a white stripe going down the middle of the bag and only have one group number printed on it along with some other number and some kind of scan code. I have no idea why they made this distinction for these bags or what that code is for, so if any of you know the purpose of this, please let me know in the comments below. Here is a random instructions page. As you can see, the building steps can get quite challenging as they sometimes include many different pieces in one step, especially when it uses a lot of brown pieces which are very dark and hard to see in the instructions, living up to the set's status as an expert-level set. Most of the time, though, the instructions are pretty clear and easy enough to follow. There are some parts in new colors in this set that weren't in the first version or any other set until now, such as that large, flat Technic arch in dark green, the jester hat in orange and blue, one of those new 2z2 round jumper tiles in brown, a golden frog(!), and a snowboard in dark blue. There are also some rare Friends parts that make their Creator debut here such as the skis in azure and that new clear 1x1 round tile with a tiny tube coming out of it which is usually used as a stand for Friends accessories and is a very useful piece, especially for SNOT techniques (and no, I'm not talking about the type of snot that many people usually have stuck in their nose around this time of year). There are some printed parts as well, such as the clock tile, the letter tile, and the register slope like in the first version of the set. We also get a new face print for the white cat which is more in line with other modern cat designs. But the best part is the shop sign which is printed this time around. It features a lovely wood pattern, the words "toy shop", and a toy soldier on both sides of the sign. Which is ironic since the shop doesn't seem to sell any toy soldiers like this, but it looks so good on the sign that I won't sue them for false advertising. The Minifigs Let's start with the most unique figures in this set, the carolers. These two were also the highlight in the first version of the set, but in the original they both had the same head (this one -> ) which featured a very questionable facial expression that could easily be taken out of context. In this version, they have unique faces which look much better and help distinguish their gender. The male caroler uses Lord Vampyre's torso which looks quite snazzy on him. Maybe this is Lord Vampyre before he became a vampire? The female caroler is easily the best minifig in the set, though, because in addition to her exclusive head, she also gets an exclusive torso and skirt print! A huge improvement over the generic unprinted one in the original. She also gets the queen hair in dark brown and Aragorn's lined cape instead of two combined regular capes. This set truly is the Return of the Queen! The snowman is technically not a minifig, but as you can see here, he is exactly as tall as one and he is the first thing you build after the minifigs, so I included him here. He has mostly the same design as before, except this time he has robot claws for arms instead of levers. Which is good since they allow him to hold accessories such as his broom. His carrot nose is included separately again. The carolers both have back printing while the snowman looks no different from the back than he does from the front. Here you can see the black side of the female's cape. This lined cape is so much nicer than the solution they used in the original. Next up we have what I assume is a married couple who are likely the parents of at least one of the kids, as well as the toymaker who I will call Geppetto. The man in the pinstripe suit was not included in the first version of the set, so he's a bonus minifig! These guys are fairly generic, but they have some detailed torso prints, so they look pretty nice. Geppetto seems to have gotten younger since the release of the original set since his gray hair has now turned dark tan and he doesn't seem to need glasses anymore. The men both have back printing, but the woman is the only one in this set who doesn't get a back print. Why you gotta be so discriminating against women, LEGO?! Last but not least, there are the kids. One of the boys wears dark blue pants, a green jacket, and a wool cap. He looks a bit like a lumberjack, so let's call him lumberjack boy, or Jack for short. The little girl wears an outfit that wouldn't look out of place in the Friends theme with a lavender scarf and pants. I'll call her Lavender. The second boy is wearing an Octan jacket and a sports helmet which makes it ironic that he is the one not doing any winter sports on the box art. I'll call him President Business Junior, or PBJ for short. All of the kids have fairly detailed back printing which makes up for the fact that much like the adults, they are made out of mostly common parts. PBJ's helmet and scarf cover up the back of his head nicely which is important as you will see in the next picture. What's also great about these figs is that half of them have a double-sided head. Here you can see PBJ doing his best Macaulay Culkin impression. I also removed his scarf so you can see the printing on his torso better. But he's not the only one who seems to be easily scared. The mother also has a very alarmed expression. Maybe she got surprised by the Jack-in-the-box or maybe she just realized how expensive toys are nowadays. You can see the female caroler's back printing here. Her alternate expression is a non-singing face which is very nice to have and I wish the male caroler could have one too. She looks quite cute with those rosy cheeks. But the most adorable out of all of them has to be the little girl. She comes with a pouting sad face that will melt your heart. Please, don't cry! I'll buy you any toy you want, just stop looking at me like that! The Build The first half of the build is dedicated to the surroundings of the toy shop. It includes the Christmas tree, the park bench, the snowman, the toys, the carolers, Jack and Lavender. The large bag contains two smaller bags with small pieces, a white box that contains the caroler's cape, and the jester hat in its own little bag. The first thing you build after the minifigs and the snowman is the toys. This version of the set has a lot more toys than the original which is good because I always felt that the first Toy Shop was a bit light on toys. Also, the ones that were in the original have been updated. For example, instead of the two pairs of skis, you now get one pair of skis that use the new ski mold and a snowboard. The Jack-in-the-box is mostly the same, except it now has an orange and blue color scheme instead of the red and blue from the original. This change was probably not necessary, but hey, at least we get a new jester hat out of it. And instead of the brick-built teddy bear you get the new teddy bear mold. I have mixed feelings about this change because I actually kinda liked the brick-built teddy design and using a specialized mold seems to be going against the spirit of Creator sets, but on the other hand I can't deny that the molded teddy looks better than the blocky old one. Meh. The new toys include a tugboat which has some rounded Technic pieces as its hull, a biplane, a rocket, a helicopter, and a truck that cleverly uses roller skates for its wheels. These are all quite brilliant designs that feel like micro versions of Lego City sets and make a great addition to the set. Here is a back view of some of the more complex models. As you can see, the Friends accessory stand has been cleverly used to hold the biplane's fin in place and to provide a stand for the helicopter. The Jack-in-the-box has a hinged lid. The only thing that bugs me a bit is the T-piece on top of the helicopter that holds the rotor in place, but I can't think of any better way they could have done it. Next is the ladder that is used to decorate the tree which is exactly the same as the first version. The supports are on a click-hinge, so they can be adjusted or folded away. Then, you build the tree itself. You begins, of course, with the stand which is mostly the same design as before, but this time the plates at the bottom are brown instead of white and have golden studs as feet. Next, you build the first layer of branches. The main difference in this version of the tree is that this one actually has a brown stem rather than just a Technic axle on which you stack the layers of branches one by one. You wont be able to see the stem in the final result, but I like this change as it makes the tree more realistic. Then you add the second layer of branches. This one doesn't have lights/candles and attaches to the lower layer at an angle using the four trans-yellow studs close to the stem. The third layer is added. This one has lights again. Each layer is similar in that they are all made out of green plates that are built around a 4x4 ring plate, but they get smaller each time and are constructed differently enough for the build not to feel repetitive. With the addition of the fourth layer, we get close to finishing the tree. Lastly, you add one more layer and the tip of the tree. Now it's time to decorate the tree! However, it's not as fun as it sounds since that requires you to add lights to the two chains/ropes first which can get a bit repetitive. The clips holding the lights to the chain were white, but this time they're pearl gold which looks much nicer in my opinion. The next part of the build is the park bench with the streetlamp and the little tree. This is a fairly quick build with not much to it. The fishbowl helmet parts are a useful piece that you don't see too often, so it's nice to get them again in this remake. The design is pretty much the same as in the original set except for the wreaths on the streetlamp which use a green life preserver instead of a round 2x2 plate. This is another instance where they use a specialized piece instead of a brick-built solution, but I'm okay with that because unlike with the teddy bear, this part was not originally intended to be a wreath, so it's still nice part usage. The second half of the build is dedicated to the toy shop itself and includes the couple, Geppetto, and PBJ. Please note that there is a fourth 6x10 plate burried under the parts. You begin by tiling the floor, setting up the walls, and adding the interior items such as the fireplace, the cash register, and the toy displays. Next, you add the walls, windows, and the door and the ground floor of the shop is finished. So far, the build is the same as the old toy shop, except this time they decided to have the white stripes on the marquees be the longer ones instead of the dark red ones for some reason. I don't know why they did this and kinda would have preverred to get dark red 1x1 plates instead of white, but it doesn't detract from the look of the shop, so I don't really care. Now we begin with the upper floor. This is where things start to look a little different. Can you tell the difference? The difference is that this time they attach the roof using clip-hinges instead of bulky Technic constructions which gives you more space on this floor and allows it to look more like an actual attic. They even tile the floor next to the frog clock. Aftter adding the roof, the build is finished. The main roof feels a bit loose since it's only attached to the building by one side. I'm not sure if this was an issue in the old toy shop, but it's not a big deal. I just wouldn't pick the set up by the roof. What I do like is that they used double cheese slopes on the awning on the outer wall of the tower instead of singles which makes it a bit easier to build. I like how the supports under the tower roof now match those of the main roof. The wreaths have also been updated like the ones on the streetlamp. And those Technic arches under the roof look a lot more like garlands now. On the original, they were dark gray, so I didn't even know they were supposed to be garlands and assumed they were part of the architecture. The shop sign looks a lot better now that it is printed. The old one just looked like a white flag. I also like how the small plates under the marquee give it a wavy look and they included two trees in different sizes on the right side of the shop. The back is nice and open and allows you to see the rest of the toys, the robot, train, and race car, all of which have just as much of a simple and clever design as the other toys. The clock looks much nicer with the new golden frog. Because golden frogs make everything better. Spare Parts There are quite a few small parts left over, including a roller skate and one of those Friends accessory stands which will come in handy. The Complete Set Here you can see the full set together. It looks quite nice and festive with all the little details and there are many scenes that you can play out with it: You can have the minifigs decorate the tree, have the kids play in the snow, have the carolers sing by the bench, have the toymaker build some toys in his workshop, or have the parents buy presents for their kids. It's a festive, toy-filled Winter Wonderland! The fireplace looks cozy and I like the brick pattern going up the chimney. The entrance of the shop looks a bit empty aside from the cash register. I feel like they could have displayed some more toys here, but oh well. Being a set targeted at teens and adults, there aren't really any play features aside from the light brick which is attached to a hinge, so you can either activate it by pressing the button with your finger or tilting the brick upward so that the button is pressed against the roof. However, since the roof is not connected in the middle and only attached on the sides, it tends to split open a bit when you do that, so I'm not sure if attaching the roof this way here was such a good idea. Nevertheless, it looks quite nice when the light is lit. Ratings Design: 5/5 - This set is as gorgeous as it was back in 2009! The small updates that they made are mostly good ones, although the absence of a brick-built teddy is a bit disappointing and the new way the roof is attached, while not as bulky as before, makes the roof slightly unstable, but those are just nitpicks. Build: 5/5 - There are some interesting building techniques here, such as those on the tree, the roof, and the toys. The fact that the parts are only split into two groups and the part callouts can get fairly complex makes it a challenging, enjoyable build. Minifigs: 5/5 - They did a great job updating the figs in this set. While only 3 of the torsos in the original had any printing, all of the torsos have printing front and back in this set, even the skirt and cape of the female caroler. You get two exclusive heads and half of the heads are double-sided, plus you get 8 instead of 7 minifigs. You really can't ask for more in a Creator set. Playability: 4/5 - This set is more meant to be displayed than to be played with, but there are plenty of things to play with if you want. All the different minifigs, accessories, and set pieces make for endless possibilities for play. It's especially fun to swoosh the micro vehicles around. Parts: 3/5 - There are lots of good parts here. Most of them are fairly common, but there are some rare parts and some even in exclusive colors. Price: 4/5 - This set costs $20 more than the original, but considering that this set has nearly 900 pieces, including some rare and exclusive ones, as well as more minifigs with much better printing, I think $80 is still a fair price. Overall: 5/5 - So what's my opinion of this set? For a remake, I think it's great. They managed to make a good set even better. Are the changes minor? Yes. Are they an improvement? Mostly, yes. Were they necessary? Perhaps not, but it's good that they made them instead of just re-releasing the exact same set. So if you didn't get the first Winter Toy Shop, I can highly recommend getting this one. If you do already have the old version, this one might still be worth picking up for the hugely improved minifigs and rare parts alone. As for the controversy over re-releasing the Winter Toy Shop, I can see where the haters are coming from, but I find their complaints to be quite petty. I can understand if you're disappointed because you already have the first Winter Toy Shop and were looking forward to a new set this year, but there's always next year. If you're a completist and feel like TLG is forcing you to buy a set you don't need, you're wrong. Nobody is forcing you to buy anything but yourself. If you decide to buy every set in a theme no matter what it is, that's your problem, not LEGO's. So put down your torches and pitchforks and just be glad that they improved the set design and gave us another chance to buy this classic set. There are far worse things that can happen in this world than Lego re-releasing one of their most popular sets. Sorry for that little rant. So what is your opinion on re-releases like this? Please cast your vote in the poll above. I hope you enjoyed this special Eurobricks Reviewers Academy review and would like to thank The Lego Group for the opportunity to review this set. Happy Holidays everyone! Bat-Toys by Okay Yaramanoglu, on Flickr	positive
Thanks for a great review first of all. I do like the upgrades and changes made from the original 2009 set, more colours and parts are offcourse available today than back in 2009. It does look like a great set and i would really realy have loved to get it myself if i had the funds. However their are so many other sets thats first priority for me this december and next year, so sadly i might have to pass on this if its not that i can get it redicioulusly cheap at some point. And yeah, we should appreciate that LEGO does keep sets coming, even if its just upgrades from earlier releases. Town is known for a new police and fire station every year, cant see why a new toyshop is so upsetting. Once again thanks for a great review. And happy holidays to you as well.	positive
Nice to see they finally updated that generic screaming face from the 2007 Castle line. Awesome review, Oky. I have the old set so I won't be picking this up.	positive
Great review. You almost make me want to buy one. I don't know what it is with these sets. On the one hand they are so nicely designed and cute on the other side I never seriously consider buying one. I can't explain what it is that holds me back.	positive

That's the thing that usually holds me back. Anyway, I have the older version, so I am not interested in this set.	neutral
Regarding the reason for the different designs on the inner bags, I think that the white stripe is the new version, with the non-stripe version being old. I suspect the reason some sets have both versions is simply that they're still using up some of their supply of older bags. Good review. I didn't realise there were quite as many changes as you highlighted (tree, roof etc).	positive

Oky, on 02 December 2015 - 12:49 AM, said: I don't think that would be a realistic option as that would mean that they would have to spend twice the resources on this theme which I don't think they are ready to do, but if more people would like this option, I can add it to the poll. I know, but one can always hope, can't one! I hope the WV theme will be continued in coming years with new sets, but given Santa's workshop and this re-release, I don't get my hopes up too much. Time to get MOCing and reverse engineering!	neutral
Oky, on 02 December 2015 - 12:49 AM, said: I'm not mocking anyone. I just think that some people need to calm down a bit and that TLG is getting more hate than they deserve for this set, but that's just my opinion and you're welcome to disagree with it. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, including you and me. And yes, I would love to hear your thoughts on this matter because I would like to have a friendly discussion on this subject. That's cool, and I appreciate that. But, i would recommend avoiding the use of the word "hater" then. That's a perjorative term that's loaded with negative connotation, as I'm sure you're well aware. It's the flipside to me calling you a "mindless fanboy" or a "corporate shill." Those aren't terms that invite friendly discussion. They shut down discussion by belitting the other person's opinion, and implying that they lack the maturity or intelligence to think critically. I don't actually care all that much about this set. You just hit on a pet peeve of mine, is all. And it's one that I see spreading throughout Eurobricks, which is a shame. The use of terms like "hater," "whiner," or "fanboy" are becoming much too prevalent around here.	neutral
Very nice little set, and a lot of those new white small panels. It's a need!	positive
Love this model, awesome swooshability, interesting parts, and a nice little model to put on my desk at work :)	positive
Hi there, nice model, great review! I almost reverse engineered this model, but used wrong parts for landing wheels, didn't know how to fix the nose proper, and so on. So i was very interested in this model and i like playing with it. I love the reviews, but i think i have to mention, that the yellow axle must be a 5L! The picture shows a 5L, and a 5L would fit the size of the model. The cart has also a 5L in yellow. What sitze is the yellow axle in this seit. Really 4L as written in the text? Greetings, Robert	positive
I seem to have been messing up Axle Lengths in various reviews It's indeed 5L. My bad. Thanks for pointing it out.	neutral
Very nice review for a nice little set! I especially like the smoothness of operation for the retractable landing gear. I don't like the lack of symmetry for the propeller of the B model though, but understand the alternative would be to add one extra small panel to the set, or skip two of them in the B model.	positive
Set is only interesting for the panels, that's all it is to me	neutral
My favourite of the 2016 sets I've built so far. I'd go so far as to say this is the best "budget" set in years. I would have loved this when I was a kid ... great "swoosh ability" ??	positive
I got this little set for Xmas and I noticed all the gaps and decided to fix them, so here it is. IMG_5344 by JJ2Sam, on Flickr First I added some beams to the wings and top to make it less hollow, second I put some navigation lights on it, I made the nose a bit wider and added a control panel, and lastly I changed out the landing gear wheels to more appropriate ones. IMG_5349 by JJ2Sam, on Flickr More pictures are HERE	neutral
So this set showed up in stores yesterday, and i immediately picked two up. All in all it is a nice set, but it is slightly different from what i was expecting, the plane feels a bit "flat", pointy nose, wide bottom etc.. And while the panels work very well as wings, it feels a bit simplistic to just have single-part wings. The stickers really work for it though. Its a cracking set though, nice parts pack, and a nice model as well	positive
I almost purchased this today because I like the wheel / disc combo so much.	positive
Not sure what people like about this set, I think it's the worst of all 1H2016 sets. Odd shape, bland colors, no new parts, and the windscreen isn't even closed. But the reviews are great, indeed. :)	negative
are parts #62462 in Flat or Metallic Silver?	neutral
Thanks again for the review. I am not sold on this one yet, but I confess it took about 2 years for me to finally appreciate 9396. Maybe I need to see this in person.	neutral
Thanks for the review. I wonder if the design inspiration came from the Russian Ka-32 helicopter.	positive

Lego 42049 Mine Loader Thanks to Lego and EuroBricks for making this review possible! This was supposed to be a preview-review, before the Dec 1 release date for the set, but it got stuck in customs or something and didn't arrive in time. Well, I'd rather do a good, late review than a rushed review, so here it is. Name: Mine Loader Set Number: 42049 Pieces: 476 (I think) Price: $39.99 (I think) Minifigs: 0 Theme: Technic Year of Release: 2016 Links: Bricklink Brickset The Box Another standard Technic box, not that there's anything wrong with that. It is a littler weird that the mine loader is shown OUTSIDE the mine, but whatever. The Back of the Box Again, very standard. It's oddly technical, showing the exact angle of the machine when turning, but that's the sort of nerdy detail that Technic people like. The alternate Mine Cutting Machine model looks interesting and unusual as well. The 1:1 Part The 1:1 part on the top of the box is especially helpful with this set. These mining machines are very oddly proportioned, since they need to fit in mine tunnels, so it's hard to judge the model size based on the wheels or seat like you can an ordinary set. The Contents You get manuals for both models (a single book for the B and two books for the main), a medium size sticker sheet, 4 bags, and 4 loose tires. The Special Parts This set has 4 of the new mudguard panels in yellow, two cylinder halves in red (a new color), some of the new color red and yellow axles, a couple of the new-ish Technic spacers, some of the axle-pin combination pieces, and a couple swords! I'm pretty sure that's "an antenna" and a spare. The Start of the B-Model Since I like the main model better, I'm building the alternate first, so that's how I'll write the review. There's "power" for something (probably the engine) being taken off the one axle here. Overall, a pretty standard Technic frame beginning with some structural beams, a frame, and using liftarms to support axles out to the sides. More of the Frame The far end of the model has some obvious steering mechanism being formed, as well as a pivoting arm right in the center that's probably the connection from the Hand of God knob. The Steering Yup. Called it. Oddly, there is a different turning radius between right and left right now. I wonder if that'll get fixed... More Mechanisms That's looking more Technic now. Sad to see a u-joint being used just as a fixed straight connection like that, but it is the alternate model... The Engine Block Because all engines should be enclosed in a red cylindrical housing, am I right? The Chassis It's definitely coming together now. And yes, the B-model instructions tell you to put the stickers on. It doesn't matter whether you build the main or alternate first, you'll get the stickers on (almost - there were a couple leftover that didn't get used in the B-model). Almost Done With the rest of the body done and the wheels on, you really get the scale of this machine. That blue seat is tiny compared to the rest of it! And yes, the uneven steering lock got fixed. After putting the wheels on, you add a couple of "pin with ball" pieces to the underside to restrict the steering. They didn't do that at first so that you could turn the axles sharper while putting the wheels on, which made it easier to do. The Grinder Keeping in mind the scale of the machine, this thing looks terrifying! The tan gear at the back drives the spinning blade up front. The red bushes near the turntable let you adjust the angle. All Done The arm quickly attaches to the body and it's done. Sadly, that tan gear doesn't connect to anything - it's just a knob so you can spin the blade by hand. Raise Your Hand, If You're Sure... (I think I'm dating myself with that title...) This thing has massive reach. I'm imagining this inside a mine, grinding away the rock overhead. Pretty viciously effective machine! The crank on this side of the model is used to raise and lower the arm. Works well, and the grey spacer makes it nice to use since it spins freely. The Leftovers Not much left for a B-model. Nice usage! Starting the Main Model The main model starts similarly to the alternate, with a frame, some axles, and a drive connection from one axle to something later. Getting Complicated Already We're only a few pieces in and we already have three separate gear trains going on. There's the axle driving the tan beveled gears inside the frame at the bottom. There's more tan gears in the middle, and there's also a black gear sticking up as a knob that turns the grey connector in the center. The Body is Done I skipped ahead quite a bit, but it was a bunch of standard Technic building. You've got a fake engine with fan at the back, driven by one of the rear wheels, a knob sticking up for steering, and an axle coming forward to open and close the claw. The Claw! I like that they used a link system to open and close the claw instead of just gearing it. The axle comes forward from the chassis (it's the red axle) with a couple u-joints for flexibility and drives a worm gear. That rotates a gear below with a 2 stud liftarm on each side. Those arms have pin with towball in them and then a link going from that short liftarm to the claw. It's a small rotation of the liftarm, but makes the claw open widely and works very well. Raising the Claw A few black liftarms join the claw to the body of the loader and allow it to move up and down. It's a simple mechanism there - one yellow beam goes back and connects to a lever that lets you raise and lower the claw. When raised (as shown), the lever locks in place by going just slightly past the centerline. And It's Done Add some wheels, a cab, and some wheel arches and we're done. It's a great looking machine, pretty unique, and looks like the real thing. The main difference from reality is these usually have a scoop for moving loose rock. Since we've had so many scooping vehicles in the past (tracked loaders, the Volvo L350F, excavators, etc) the claw here is a fun change and adds to the playability for kids. Like the real thing, the body stays very low so the cab only has to stick up a little bit for the driver to see all around, because mines are cramped and busy areas. From the Rear This angle is great. I love the use of the new mudguard panels to make a nice curve to the back of the loader. The antenna is a little weird, but perhaps they had a big pile of flat silver fencing swords to use up. The black gear just to the left of the antenna is the claw control. Rotating that gear opens and closes it. The back end is a little lighter than a real machine would be, but Lego wanted to leave the engine exposed so you can see the cylinders moving. The Conclusion So, what's my conclusion on this model? I like it a lot. It's simpler than a big set would be, but it's got lots of design and playability crammed in a mid-sized set. It's a unique vehicle. However, it does have a few flaws. The steering on the main model needs some drag added. As is, you basically have to drive by holding the steering knob since it'll bend if you push it from behind. I don't like the use of pin with pin hole as mounting points for the orange and red trans plates for lights, since they can turn slightly and be at weird angles. The antenna is unnecessary and in the way. But none of these flaws are dealbreakers or even big deals. They're minor. The Ratings Value: 10/10 - Less than 10 cents a piece, lots of useful liftarms and such, nothing too weird or single-use. Design: 9/10 - Looks very realistic for the size of the set, good functionality, not too dependent on stickers Minifigs: n/a - n/a Playability: 9/10 - Controls aren't perfect (loose steering, small knob for claw control) but very functional and cleverly done. Parts: 9/10 - Nice selection, although heavy on the standard yellow and black. Almost zero studded parts. Overall: 9.5/10 - It's a great intro to Technic set - a unique vehicle, good functionality, nice part selection, and decently priced. I like it a lot and plan to keep it around as a finished set.	positive
Excellent review! Worth waiting for. The set itself is very interesting. looks like it may have one interesting build techniques. Thanks for the review, Andy Ad	positive
Great review, thank you. The set to me is kinda blah, interested more in the new panels than the rest of it.	neutral
Great review! One thing reaaaaaally bothers me about this set, both models have the engine connected to one wheel, the other wheel on the "powered" axle is just left to rotate freely, and that really bothers me, as it did in 42022 (on 42022 even more TBH, since its main feature is being a frigging car). Looking at the pics it isnt even a space issue (as it was in the hot rod, where they "needed" to route the steering through), so they just cheaped out and didnt bother fitting a diff in there (or even a live axle link) Im not very interested in this set (not into construction stuff), but i think this is a worrying trend :(	negative
Definately a quirky set, I think I'd have prefered a bucket on the front with a complex lift and tip mechanism, but a grab is different. As for the B model, I may prefer it's functions to the A model, certainly something different we have not seen before.	neutral
Cool mod by effe. But the original model out of the box is one of the poorest models TLG ever released. Looks from front to rear as a cheaped out set with really lazy design effort. A shame for the responsible Lego designer Parts assortment seems to be ok but this should Not be the most important Criteria Sry Jim, i really appreciate your always very well done reviews and offen i agree with the Overall judgements/verdicts and of course tastes are different but especially that review sounds like gushing praise in my ears....

I have made a ldd file of a improved version	positive
Quote And the dumbing-down continues. Now they have to show people to compare axle lengths to the 1:1 prints on the page that have always been there. But how does the 1:1 work on the app? Might have to look into that... (for the record... I pulled out my phone and tried to find the app in the Google store. Couldn't find it. So then I went to the Lego website shown on the page and it had a link to it. Turns out it wasn't showing up because it's tablet only, so Google wasn't showing it to me on my phone. I'll try again later with a tablet...) Funny thing is that they changed colour of 7L axle to yellow, and on that picture it still is in LBG.	neutral

I was supposed to publish it together with the 42039 - 24 Hours Racer, but it somehow got backlogged. After completing the reviews for the 2016 sets, I felt I needed to finish it (was already 90% done). That C-model looks cool!	positive

You switched the sides for the panel with the unsymmetrical sticker. Otherwise you would see that the cut off part is where there's a beam in front of the panel. That's probably done because the beam could possibly damage the sticker, either while building or while placed against it for a long time. Or it's simply omitted because it wouldn't be (completely) visible	neutral

Great review, but am I the only one who thinks this is a pretty homely looking vehicle? The small exploration robot is cool, but the large windscreen on the main vehicle reminds me about Jack Stone! I also think the bases of the vehicle parts are very basic and look almost unfinished with the holes and such. I think I will pass this one, even though the alien has a jet pack and there is the nice mini vehicle.	negative

Wow. This is actually quite a neat set! It is definitively my favorite in the line after the big drilling unit! \begin{geek} I'm not sure it would nose dive when transforming from tank mode.

and another tks and congrats MM on that review !! Like the o?her post I think that this set is a wastre of time and money and shelfspace. Its such a ripp off from that ugly Alfa Team crapjet. I do not like the design of the jet itself: the small flags as front is so lame !! And I don't like those orange wheels as engines !! Furthermore I don't like the "rover" mode either !!

Lasse D, on Nov 26 2007, 03:34 PM, said: 1) There will always be kudos for a good review at EB ;-) 2) Yeah. It does look quite slow and tank-like. It is a shame LEGO didn't make a more obvious way shoving what goes on. You mean the ungainly way in which the wheels have to turn in order to change from tank mode? I think you are right as well. On the other hand. If it has anti-grav, then it doesn't really make sense to have wheels as well. I mean. If the power goes, then the wheels can't turn anyways! It must have anti-grav. Otherwise, NONE of the flying sets would work... Athos, on Nov 26 2007, 04:02 PM, said: I think blue must be a cheaper color for Lego... Steve I think this is weird.

This one is much better than I thought; I didn't expect the gun and the "turret" to be geared!

Is the nightmare finally over? :'-) The bonus robot is a much better idea. The large amount of blue pieces make this a must buy for me as Impartial needs more raw materials! :-P How well do the tracks work?

I think this is probably my least favourite set of next years selection, but I still might get it, partly because of this review (thanks, btw). I quite like the mini-robot, and while there are a few problems (the front cockpit, the exposed axles) I relish the idea of MODing them out, and correcting them. And the change back to the original figs is welcome. I didn't really get any of this years sets, only last years. Makes it easier from a MOCing potential, anyway.	neutral

Hinkley, you are the MAN! Your reviews just keep on getting better and better! Although all of the sets this year are great and I love them all to bits, I can't say there was one that I absolutely felt like something I'd buy except for the Storm Lasher. But with this review, I think this will be the first purchase of 2008 for me! I totally agree with you on how the Spider looks better without Mini-robot. But from looking at where the cockpit is placed and how the skull on the cockpit is lodged underneath the walker, maybe the mini-robot would look better mounted underneath the head? That way it looks more even and even gives the thing a nasty set of teeth! I gotta try it out once I get it. Can't wait for the Fabuland comics! Keep it up, Hink!	positive

I gave this one a 5. It's one of the little pirate sets I had during my youth and I loved it for several reasons. First of all, it contains 2 of my favorite minifigs! It can be used as a small independent base or in combination with one of the bigger sets (Eldorado or Trading posts) as a lookup or outer defense. Besides all that, this set just looks beautiful.

INDEXED I'm going to have to start dodging cannon balls soon if i don't start making some pirate mocs. *pirate* Anywayz, I've had my Shell Service Station set # 6378 built exactly by "the book" and sitting around for the longest time. With the recent twinning of my "town" with Dr. Sinister, I needed a gas station that could handle a lot more traffic (especially military traffic and these new 6-wide vehicles X-D ). Here be a thumblink to the original station at BL: I love this station so much, but it really needed some modernization. The reopening of this station received a lot of attention, even the local police stopped right over. One big upgrade to this station is the selling of propane tanks, which is generally a rare commodity from the lego towns i've seen. X-D Also at this service station is a propane tank refilling station. The milkman is our first propane customer. The interior has also had an addition and many upgrades. For instance, this building now has florescent lighting, a big frig in the back, and more shelf space. *y* Oh look! there's the officer purchasing a mountain dew. Now that there's more shelf space, we can sell more than just 1x1 round yellow bricks and levers. We now have available 1x1 round plates and 1x1 round cones available in multiple colors! :-D With this upgraded gas station, hopefully this town will bring in more business and customers into my small town. X-D P	positive
:'-) I really love everything you did with this gas station. It looks very cozy!!! Amazing how you said you built it by the book, does that mean you didn't have the set but you used your own pieces to rebuild the thing? The flourescent lighting is genius! And the interior space looks just like what you'd see at those little shops. I really dig the moc ;-) it gives me good ideas and now I want a gas station of my own :-P And the history behind how it was "rebuilt" and how it will improve business etc is so cool *wub*	positive

Thank you Big Pete *wub* This set looks very good, it looks well built and the statues are nice. The ark looks great and the Star Wars hieroglyphic is classic :-D Just a two things: Is Marion's face double sided? It looks like a calm face on the back of the box. Where do the snakes come out? And about the stickers, have you tried putting them on the long bricks above the breakable walls? Once again, thanks very much *wub* *y*	positive

I never noticed until I just checked! :-$ Will post a pic of the alternate face when my camera battery is charged :) Quote Where do the snakes come out? They sit on a pivoting plate behind the Star Wars heiroglyphics. You press down on a brick at the back and the plate drops and they fall out from underneath. Quote And about the stickers, have you tried putting them on the long bricks above the breakable walls? well, yes ... that was where I guessed they were meant to go ... but really ... there is no mention of this in the instructions!

This is great, thanks for the review...but they're using a new skellie? I thought those were just for the reanimated dead...not just skeletons. Unless that skeleton is supposed to be reanimated?

This and Motorcycle Chase were the two sets I've wanted from the start. I like how you get lots of snakes, and I'll add my snakes in too, for a Brickfilm.

Cool. Found it bit disappointed though |-/ ... (Not disappointed about the review but the set)	negative
Awesome looking playset. Will probably not get due to price, and the fact I don't really need it. Good to see how everything works, but those DAMN stickers!	positive
this set is pretty nice i love the idol id probably buy the set just for that :-D lol is it just me or in the earlier concepts of this set we saw a native on the box? i wonder why they removed it :-( *wacko*	neutral
Tks so much Big Pete for thisd awsome review of yet another fantastic Indy sets !! Its clearly one of the best lines of all times with SW 8-? That idol is superb and I love all the details of that set: loads of cool defense mechanisms, sweet vegetation and yeay another black carrot torch :-P And those MFs are really nice !! I am so happy to see Lego go dark tan *wub* Now I clearly can't wait to enjoy building this set ;-) Fertility Idol On !! *yoda*	positive
i just noticed another inconsistency between box art and the actual set ... on the box, the biplan has white wing supports (they're just plane windows without glass in them) and yet the set they are dark grey (or is it bley ... can never tell the difference without careful study). Add to that ... the outer of the engine at the front is white on the box and black in the set. We don't normally have this many inconsistencies do we ?	neutral
Because of exams and other obligations, I haven't posted this sooner. Seeing that no-one else has reviewed this set, I thought I might as well do it myself. The set in its entire glory (minus the slammer, instructions and the (obviously) massive sticker sheet) The four cars included in this set; a muscle car, a sports car, a roadster and the police off-roader(!): Because the police obviously have no clue that an off-roader is useless for catching street-racers, no less a batmobile-ish sports car, it will always trail behind: But the police have a trick up their sleeve - the drawbridge: Gotcha! And the mechanism that makes it all tick: The motor is nothing more than a (slow) pull-back motor. Push down the bridge, the latch will hook on to the gear and keep it in place until the latch is released. And there's the new gas station. Staying within theme, this gas-station is, like the tanker in 8147, from the company Fuel 4 Speed: There's a notable presence of detail here, such as the soda-dispenser, water (coolant?) bottles and other accesories, two fuel pumps and bumper-level railings to prevent cars from crashing into them. There's no interior however. And as demonstrated here by a loyal Octan-employee and a pursuing officer, the gas station is built to minifig-scale: My impressions of this set: As a collector of tiny turbos, and yet to miss a set, I got this one regardless of what it included. The gas station is indeed very nice, and the minifig-scale accesories were unexpected. The lack of interior is no big issue, and the both the station and bridge can with ease be implemented into a mini-fig town. The bridge also solidly built, and includes the ramps in its design, so it can be lifted, with ramps attached, without breaking apart. The slammer included in the set is identical, apart from the white color, with those in 8147. The cars are also very nice, altough I am yet to get used to the yellow batmobile, as I've grown accustomed to calling it. I also love the off-roader's chunky tires, they make perfect wheels for the newer minifig-scale cars. I never consider price/parts ratio, and here it would, for me, be irrelevant, because it will never be demolished for parts. The play value is what I would consider pretty good, and while the bridge won't rise with a car on it, it's still strong enough to stay open with a car tipping over the edge. Hmm. Every nerve in my body is saying that this sets is worth roughly 8/10, so: Verdict: 8/10 Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 07:01 PM. Indexed	positive
Thanks for the review! It's really cool that the petrol station is mini-fig scaled, I wasn't expecting that! :-D ~Peace	positive
Picked up from the Lego shop in Bluewater yesterday Front of Box Back of Box Price ?2.50 GBP Contents, a very small instruction manual Instructions (Front) Intsructions (Back) 25 Pieces (23 used in the model) Regular construction mini fig Start of the assembly Roll in the drum Just attach the drum A little tap with the hammer! (hammer not included!) Wheel it into position Time to start mixing, also time for a well earned Tea Break, The cement is all ready now. And the 2 left over bits. Extra cement is always useful and not really wasted. Overall, a nice little set and I am pleased to see little sets appearing again at long last. The only negative is with the drum of the mixer, although the angle can be adjusted you cannot tip the contents out of the mixer. All in all I would say 8/10 for a good little set? Comments...? ? ? Edit by Hobbes: Replaced pictures with clickable thumbs and corrected set number.	neutral
Heres all the parts in assorted baggies, and the horribly messed up instructions. Four astronauts and four aliens, with an extra gold visor (yay!) Not bad. The base of the horribly unstable alien craft. The wings move up and down, aswell as back and forth, the purpose I know not. Next we build the nerf section of the base. Basically technic. And the rest of the tube connectors. Heres the farthest I got the little missle to go. Its fairly dissapointing. Good thing I didnt expect much from this portion of the set. Heres the start of the command base. More of the main structure, will be adding lots of things to all the little beams. Heres a storage container and the surprisingly not flimsy radar. On this side we see the alien elevator. It uses a HORRIBLY long technic rod, I have not seen one of this proportion, its like, a foot and a half long. More of the inner base where all the little tubes shall go. All the connected tubes and such. I also encountered a problem. In the instructions it says for the end of the elevator prong to be touching the tube connector where it is shown here, but mine has a 1x space inbetween. No matter. Heres the completed base. + My knee. Again. Onto the spaceship. The bulk of it is just technic supporting beams, with some large slope peices covering it all up. More on that later. The white coverup. The middle section lifts up to store the overly large jetpack. As you see, the storage containers take up most the bulk in the back, and you can see the jetpack on the ground. Aswell as the trigger hand hold thing that allows you to swoosh it. Look, in the back! Lego Greebles! Despite the large cockpit, it only holds one person, laying down. The wings are really the saving grace - double layered with a nice two toned effect. Kitty nudged me this picture so its abit blurry, my apologies :-| Extra peices and or peices I have no idea where the hell they go. :-P Overall, the set is quite fun I must admit. Full price, I probably would not go for it, But I got it for just under 70 dollars. For that price I can confidently say its quite worth it, many useful peices, nice figures (other than the aliens) and the tube things are quite fun to boot, even though I liked the life on mars system more, which I also have. None the less, its very fun to make them shoot around. Alright, so its not much of a command base either, and it looks abit bare. But it's still fun, even if you ignore the nerf section. Overall I give it a hardy 3.5 out of 5, the openness and epic fail of a missile launcher are hard to get by, but overall, its a dandy set :-D Merry Christmas *wub*	positive
Thanks for the review Brickmaster! I wanted this set at first but I realized I don't want it as much anymore, seems like a waste of 90$. :-(	negative
I don't recall mine having an alignment problem on the tubes... could you perhaps take a closer picture of the area? Did yours also have two of the same sticker for the wings of the alien craft?	neutral
Thanks for the review Brickmaster! This set looks nice, I really like the orange (*wub*) and white colour scheme, although the purple of the LoM base was very cool too. I only have the LoM base, if you have it built could you show a comparison? On an unrelated note, by the time I realised the red and blue hangers on the LoM base were for the red and blue mechs, the mechs were no longer in stores. :'-( I was a bit slow, huh? :-P Anywho, this is one set I won't be buying, although if the rocket was sold separately I'd get that. :-D Thanks again. *y* ~Peace	neutral

Sorry for answering so late but i was very busy... thanks guys for your comments *y* tedbeard, on Dec 28 2007, 08:08 PM, said: Sorry to disagree with anyone however, but this was not a great review. I appreciate the effort Sandra made but a great review would include more details such as what are stickers and what are printed pieces. A great review points out flaws or limitations as well as what works or is really neat. A great review would have analyzed the price per piece and compared that to other sets/themes. One might look at the recent reviews of the Indy sets or the new Spongebob sets as examples of really good reviews. The pictures are good but a great review, above all, should provide the reader with some new information, perhaps even answer questions posed in the pre-release discussion thread. I learned nothing new about the set from this review. That said, it was a good review for someone who had not seen the pre-release discussion and she did a good job of showing said person what they could expect in the set. It?s good that you told me your opinion about my review. It was my third review i made and i have to say that i made this review not for analyses, just only to show the EB Members some nice pics and to tell them my opinion. Lego is fun for me!! I don?t like to analyse the pieces, bricks, prices, colours. I just want to build something. That?s why i?m at Eurobricks and not at an other big legocommunity in Germany. Lego is fun, fun, fun!!

Wow, I have not been called a "youg man" (by which I assume you mean "young") for a while. As a forty year old with three kids that's unusual. *sweet* I tried very hard to remain positive in my critique and complimented her on those things she had done well. I felt that given the somewhat juvenile "OMG, BEST...REVIEW...EVER" tone that was creeping in amongst the replys, that it needed to be tempered with some thoughtful suggestions as to how a good review could be made great. Your ad hominem approach is offensive and far more negative than I was and to suggest I should do my own review is ridiculous. I live in Canada and we do not even have the set available here yet thus I am interested in seeing reviews of this set. If I already had the set I would not be so interested. And next time you propose to critique a critique perhaps you should actually read what I wrote. I said she wrote a good review for a specific audience. I did NOT say it was awful or whatever you seem to have assumed I meant. Saying something is good but could be improved can hardly be characterized as "bitching". :-|	positive
Thanks for the review. I really want this set because: 1. It looks fantastic 2. Has harder to find colors 3. Is a 50th anniversary commemorative 4. Some of the models are based on the 50s sets (i love the old stuff) The tanker truck is a perfect recreation of the old HO 1:87 scale Esso Tanker Truck. I have one, and you can look at it for comparison if you would like. Lego HO vehicles I'd like to modify the truck from this new set to look even more like the old Esso truck, getting rid of the green and adding some decals.	positive
Happy New Year, everyone! I went to my local Wal-mart looking for an exclusive Bionicle set yesterday, but was amazed to find everything there- SW, Bionicle, EF, Indie, the works. I nabbed the JSF and the Rogue Shadow and scampered home to take pics with my new camera. *wub* The box: The same as the other '07 boxes. Nothing new. The back shows the various features, with "pop out R2." :-| Luckily, the intruction booklet and the DSS were intact- not folded like the last MM set I got. |-/ The DSS: Not too bad, but printed parts would have been great. The figs. Anakin is amazing, IMO. *wub* Fits the CW Anie great. I noticed on the S@H reviews the kiddies were saying how ugly he looked. |-/ They need to see the CW cartoon. For the sake of my health, I should probably stop reading those. :-D The build. I won't go too in-depth on the build, since *vader* posted a very in-depth review here. The start of the build: The body of the fighter starts out long and skinny. The JSF's landing gear allows it to sit comfortably without getting in the way while swooshing. R2-D2's launching device. R2 in position. When launched... ...He often gets stuck if you don't press the button hard enough. :-/ Looks like R2 needs to lay off... whatever it is robots eat. So far: The flag stickered. It's a big sucker sticker. Completed. I forgot to add the nose stickers before I took the pic. Warning- the nose cone sticker is actually two stickers. I thought it was one, peeled of one of the stickers, and put it on the middle of the two 1x8 plates, and didn't notice the other sticker. *wacko* Various completed shots: I think this was a beautiful little set. R2's launching unit and the flick missiles are annoying, but easily fixed. I plan to add proper cannons in place of the flick missiles. Anakin is a great minifig, but he doesn't look so well standing next to my other figs. The Brickshelf Gallery (when public) Will	positive

Great review mate as usual, for me the highlight of this set has to be the new spider droid. Even though it's made up of some strange parts it really appeals to me, i would love a few of those babys.

Nice review yoda I dont think I have ever read one with as much cursing of stickers! :-D I love these two little sets, the colour scheme the little different wheels on the post van and of course the new postmen uniforms!

Thanks for the takes on these two sets, Yoda. Stickers or not, I still think these are charming sets with all the essence and nostalgia of the older sets back in the 80/90's. Am I the first one to notice the new doors used in the back of the van. Not only is it using the popular new frame, but the old container doors have been redesigned to fit with the new frame as well. Pity they're not yellow, though.	positive
these little sets are really nice! they cought my eye the minute i saw them! it would have been SO great if there was a post office to go with them! there are so few buildings in lego city the design is very classic and i am ofcourse considering to get them but it seems that i have a lot of small cars and planes on my desk! :-$ recently i took a flight with Cyprus Airways from Thessaloniki to Cyprus and the two promo plane sets were there!

Thanks for a nice review and few comments to sets: Nice airplane, finally some reminiscence for Lego City Golden Era (for me years 1982-1992). Everything is nice, but two things are freezing a smile on my face. First of all the ugly new hinge used for plane roof. I have already 4032 and those new hinges are looking really terrible when compared f.e. with 6368. Second one is new minifig, I don?t know what I expected, but this torso design looks too simple and too cheap.. Concerning new car - I appreciate fact, that TLC makes after long long years again Postal sets, but I don?t like those new-style cars. Matchbox wheels and bad rate between drivers cockpit and cargo space are damping me from buying. 6651 Mail Truck or 105 Canada Post Truck were much better...

Hey everyone, my first 2008 set is this one, 5613. I thought I'd share a review of it. *sweet* I'd like to say sorry about my photos, they were taken quickly. first, we have the box: it is the smallest lego box I've ever seen, and actually looks cute *wub* it will be heavy competition with playmobil's specials... back of the box, showing an action pose: the contents of the little box, with a very tiny instruction manual *wub* the manual unfolded. Notice that every part has its part number beside it :-) the back of the manual, showing some fire sets and the other Impulse sets the parts, 30 in total: the small set built. the firefighter has a small fire to extinquish, armed with an axe, chainsaw, other saw and foam... psssh thing X-D . five extra parts in a 30 part set! we get an extra black hatchet, yellow bar tap, light bley 1*1 plate, red 1*1 plate modified with fingers and 2*2 dark bley radar dish. Besides the plate, I've never seen these as reserve parts... but I'm not complaining X-D here is a small "alternate" model I created with it: a small bbq... what? He's hungry and he needs to put something on the bbq >:-) X-D Overall, you can't go wrong with these Impulse sets. I paid 2.89 euros for this little set, so thats a great value! Sadly the only impulse avaible were these 3 city sets (no police) and the alien Mars mission... Looking forward to the knight and magician as well as those Indy sets! TT	positive
Cool! Finally its an entire line I can actually afford to own every set! :-D I can't wait to get my hands on them! If its possible, could you give us the demensions of the box? It would be apprectiated. *y* DP8	positive
Thanks for that really nice review Dunamis! Now it is even more harder for me to wait for this set. I hope my Legostore will get it tomorrow!! It is really nice. I?m a really big fan of the creator houses.. but that one is now the best one for me!!! I love the colour of it and of course the windows at the roof. *wub* Creator House ON!!!

I got this set on tuesday on the sunshine coast (i was on a holiday) and since Kmart were having a 15% off lego it was only $40 *y* . Im Modifying my Summer House (its pretty small) .So far i've put a small kitchen,toilet,fridge & freezer downstairs and up stairs i will try to fit a bed and computer also im going to attach a small garage for my minifigs car. 8-?	neutral

Looks like i'll need to buy another one i just started the garage (which is attached to the house) but i ran out of yellow bricks........... :'-( >:-( btw nice moc takuto20 *y* i might have to "steal" your idea and make a third story since its abit tight downstairs to fit everything.......ooo yea and i like your kitchen and the dishwasher :'-) .......

Thanks for the review Dunamis, this is a great little set! I'm also very impressed with Takuto20's mods. I've been trying a few of my own. I liked the tower block design, but a lot of stuff needed fixing. Firstly I added a 4th wall, and made it so the storeys could be lifted off like in the other models. I also added flowers on the windowsills and doorways out on to the balconies. Still to be added is an extra door for the top floor which I'm going to get from the new doors and windows pack. I added a chimney that goes all the way up the back of the house, and has a fireplace on every level. Each floor is fully furnished with a fireplace, wash basin and bed on the upper levels... ...and a corner sofa and coffee table, plus an extra large fireplace on the ground floor. Finally here is my idea of what to do with two copies of this set! All the parts pictured are from 2x 4996, except 5 extra fence panels and the minifigs. The house on the left has it's garden at the rear.	positive
1. BEFORE BUYING Even if I am City fan, those new sized planes are really not mine cup of tea, my love to Lego is firmly frozen somewhere between years 1980-1995. Main reason to buy was, that I wanted to write a review at Czech Afol web Kostky.org. I bought it three days ago via web advertising, price was +- 35 USD. 2. AFTER OPENING THE BOX As presumed, some very big parts and three bags, and as an additional bonus lot of Danish air free of charge. First sight told me, that this will be really short and easy building.. 3. IMPRESSIONS DURING BUILDING ...and it was really true. 30 minutes of lazy building. Bag 1 - plane. Bag 2 - plane gondols with supports. Bag 3 - wings and propellers. When I saw the way, how is this plane made, I was strongly thinking to play Money for Nothing from Dire Straits as a music accordant with whole set. 4. IMPRESSIONS AFTER BUILDING - LOOKOUT Juniorized creeps. This is my first plane in this scale and for 99% the last one. Lack of details, lot of ugly big parts, from whole set you can see the main development target - to keep RRP at some certain low level. Inner space of airplane absolutely undone, no details, no luggage, no computers, nothing at all!! Just a lot, lot of air! The very only details in whole plane are the stickered pilots desk and some kind of seat constuction. 5. IMPRESSIONS AFTER BUILDING - PLAYABILITY But, what is playability at this set? Hydroplane, which cannot float (as seen on enclosed photos) ? If TLC will make some new kind of big parts used for gondolas, to make the plane floating, they will for sure make no other damage. Juniorization couldn?t be higher. You even cannot drive across the carpet with the plane. So, how to play? Open the doors, open the cabin part, and turn with propellers? Weak, Weak, Weak! 6. RESUMED IMPRESSIONS Sadly I must say, that at limited release sets TLC? boat seems to sailing to the worst part of the coast. After quite good 7344, perfect 7899 and 7900, strange, but acceptable 7998, juniorization came back with 7906, followed with this ugly Playmobilized 7732. 7. FINAL WORD In fact, even 15 USD seems to be too much for this kind of set. 35 USD, expected RRP in our country, is really overpriced to hell. Neither set, nor minifig is not interesting. TLC maybe knows about juniorization as well, as nowhere on the box the number of pieces isn?t written. If you my AFOL friends want to spent your bucks, better give half of the price to African orphans. You will save your money, and you will have a good feeling!

Ah great review Kanal-K1 (and welcome to EB! :-D ), I was waiting for one of this set. Not that I was expecting anything good, I won't buy it. I agree with thr playability, it does seem weak. What can you do with it. Swoosh it? :-/ Big step backwards LEGO... :-( Dr. Brick	negative

Am I the only that one that thinks it is not SO BAD???????????????????????What I am trying to say is wouldn't planes be this big in real life???I know it has a lot of big pieces but how would they make them any smaller,or how would they the big pieces into a bunch of tiny pieces?well any way I do think in some cases that if there is any "juniorized" involved it should be with duplo. complaning OFF	neutral
Thks for this caustic review :-D I'll wait for the parts on bricklink. I think you're a bit unfair with this small oversized submarine - oups sorry, I mean plane. Here are some advantages I tried to imagine : 1. that's the first submarine with a plane nose, 2. That's the first unprinted nose, 3. That's the first shark that make me laugh, and which has a plain white fin 4. And at last, you should have notice that that the first submarine with a wing made of several plates It is said that this set has more than 200 parts... Hide and seek ! X-D You may have lost several bags I'm eager that people buy this set a lot : I'd like to buy a lot of these new white 4x4x2 curved slope for my MOCs.

Great comments, ROFL, ROFL, ROFL. :-D :-D :-D Concerning last sentence - I have seen or built hundreds of different sets issued since 1980 until now, but this plane is really a hot candidate not only for Crap of the year, but for Crap of the decade... Last two days I thought about the sense of this set, and, finally, I was enlighted - I must call to my folks living in a small village, I am pretty sure, that they will be happy for a new house for their pullets.

i have to agree with almost all of the replies here that This set is the most ugliest looking Lego Set I have ever seen. If I have never seen this set, and ppl showed it to me, I would have thought it would be some little kid's MOC or something (no offence!) Huge juniorized pieces, bad color theme (i would say it would look better if the wing is white), no interior and huge DSS! I will avoid this set like the plague. I own the entire CITY line (except for the airport) and planning to get all the CITY stuff that Lego releases. But, this set will ruin my plans coz I will avoid it... unless someone gives it to me for free. haha *wacko* Boo LEGO BOO! :-X	negative

Hello and welcome to another Redman set review! Well, actually, the first Redman set review! I'm your host, Redman, and today I adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the Impulse set simply titled "The Knight". This is a great set, with 14 pieces, 2 of which are spare, and a minifig with 2 weapons, 2 helmets, and some shiny armour. All this is packaged in a tiny box, just short of 10 cm? (or 3? inches?), with a neat little instruction manual that folds up to the size of the weapons rack included in the set. As you can see, this set only costs a measly 7 NZD. (Disclaimer: Redman not included.) Here we see the box, clearly showing what the box holds. On the top we see a 1:1 scale picture of a minifig, for those new to Lego, or who have forgotten how big a minifig is I guess. :-/ X-D The instruction manual, showing the nice and easy built, with me for size comparison. :-D (*Sorry about the dark image, I had to lean over the light to get a birds eye pic. ;-)*) Here we see the 2 different soldiers you can make with the set; a knight, and a guard or standard troop or soldier or whatever you want to call him... (Note, each set comes with only 1 minifigure, and additional accessories.) Of course you know I'm in the picture just for the sake of it, I'm not really one of the soldiers. X-D The neat little weapons rack, or rather equipment rack, as it holds not only a weapon but a shield (except the ovoid ones), helmet, and armour. Nice and easy storage, so your equipment won't get dirty lying around on the ground. :-D One of the spare parts is another of those robot hands, so you can stick that in place of the shield and allow the rack to hold 2 weapons. Just thought you'd like to know that. :-$ And here we see the nifty little structure of the thing. It can even support a whole minifig! Note the grey stud on the bottom bar is a spare part, I just find it better used there to hold the armour. :-) Huh? I don't remember this picture... 8-| It appears I drifted off, and these guys don't look too happy I overtook their weapons equipment rack. :-$ I should go... X-D So, in conclusion this is a great set for army building, at a reasonable price, with nice equipment, and it can be picked up as a little extra with your normal shopping. X-D That's all for today folks! *sweet* [/Redman] So, what do you think? Should I continue with these Redman Reviews ? (:-P), or just stop now? X-D Comments and criticism welcome! :-$ ~Peace	positive
An excellent first time (?) review iamded! *y* Well, atleast a first time Redman review anyway. I really enjoy Redman, I hope to see him pop up more often. Your pics are great now that you ditched the phone :-P , and you've shown the set from many different angles and perspectives. Thanks for this brilliant review, you have certainly convinced me to get a few of these, and then some X-D Redman ON!

Thanks everyone for your positive feedback, it's really appreciated! :-D You'd be surprised how long that 'Redman Presents' thing up the top took me to make!

Both dark grey 1x1 round plates are used on the weapons rack (one for the armour, one for the helmet) and I only got one robot hand for holding weapons. That's strange, maybe I'm just lucky.

In reality not all members of a species are identical, it's great seeing them in different colors. Great review X-D	positive
Those extra helmet pictures just seal how much I love those new helmets *wub* They look so great.	positive
Great review, Vader :-) As I've said before, this is a nice set, but doesn't really come with anything that doesn't come with the other sets of the line. For this reason, it will be somewhere at the bottom of my list for 2008. Also, I like torso and helmet of the Dwarf Mining orcs much better. The colours make the torso look rather dull and boring, while the other, more brown one, looks much clearer and more exciting. I think I like the *knight* helmet better too, looks more covering and threatening than this one, although I'll save my judgement until I have one in my hands. Thanks again Vader ;-) EDIT: Forgot to mention, hilarious pic in your sig, Vader :-D Edited by TinyPiesRUs, 19 January 2008 - 08:28 AM.	negative
Mr Tiber, on Jan 19 2008, 11:16 PM, said: A Troll driven by a turkey leg, what a wonderful little detail!!! :-D :-D Thanks for the review Vader. Very clever, using a flag to hide that crazy firing device. I find it rather odd they used blue pins for this. Black or gray would've been alot more discrete. About the big trolls, I think using different colours is good. I don't think a troll force would be very organized, so different colours would make the effect complete *y* . As for your troops, looks quite fearsome! Definitely compared to my pathetic number of soldiers.. :-$ A nice set, but I would rather get the Attack on Tower though.. no matter about the price difference. Oh don't get me wrong i love the dark tan troll, i just prefer the sand green one. Your right about trolls not being organized, and i like to think that the trolls are from different areas etc.	negative
Vader, on Jan 19 2008, 12:45 AM, said: Here's a few quick shots of the 2 larger trolls we have so far, i prefer the sand green one. Nice comparison shot, judging from these pics, I think I have to agree with you that green suits the Troll better. Especially since the Orcs are sand green as well, indicating some relation between the two races (if they are indeed separate races). Great review, very detailed and with lots of pictures. I was already interested in this set, but after reading your review I want this set for sure! *y*	positive

Great review! My only grip with this set is you can only fit one pallet in the truck. It should have been the same size as the trailer so you can at least fit 2 pallets. Seems like alotof wasted space. If i'm going to transport cargo, i want to use the maximum amount of space aviable!! X-D	negative

I thought the same thing when I went to load it.	neutral
I got this set last week and just to add a few of my own points CONS: - The forklift spring feels a bit flimsy - I don't know how long it will last or how much stress it would take - and the end coil isn't really heavily secured to the lift mechanism. Time will tell on that one. - 30 stickers! It's the Exo-Force of City sets! The truck set does look less plain with them on though. I would reccomend lining them up with the green brick in the second container rather than applying the first lot without a guide or they may end up uneven - It's very hard to put the minifig in the forklift without dismantling (or breaking open) the set slightly - The cargo box attached to the main cabin of the truck doesn't hold very strongly - Minifigs are dull - that dark blue torso with pattern is way overused - green stickers are a different green to the bricks themselves PROS: - lots of nice pieces including the large white panels and cargo pieces, and i like the green/ white colour scheme - the cargo doors open well and the hingeing mechanism doesn't stand out to the detriment of the rest of the set (as some people have complained about the mail airplane) - studless floor in cargo containers makes it easy to move pallets in and out - fits in better than the Heavy Hauler to a minifig sized city - new 1x1x4 slope! (at least I hadn't seen it before) OVERALL - nice set with some good pictures, although a bit flimsy, and way too many stickers - the same issues I have with the Cargo Plane as well (although that had more colour issues).	positive
hey, thanks for the review The Brickster! i was just wondering if you could possibly upload a picture of the instructions for the forklift, and, if possible, tell me the piece # of the 1x4 slope bricks (to bricklink them). thanks!	neutral
thats fine, as its not a neccesity. and thanks for the piece #. EDIT: hmm...that's interesting, i just bricklinked it and it is not cataloged yet, oh well Edited by ricecracker, 22 January 2008 - 03:47 AM.	neutral
Greetings, and welcome to another Redman Review! I'm your host, Redman, and today I adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the Impulse set simply titled "The Knight". No wait, that's the old script. X-D I mean, "The Good Wizard". *sweet* The other Castle Impulse set (the first being 'The Knight'), this is a wonderful, and in my case unexpected addition to the Castle line! I did not expect to get a nice good wizard, but rather another plain white skellie for the Impulse, and was pleasantly surprised when I saw the first picture of this set. The Impulse sets give you pieces you wouldn't expect to see in such small sets, for example, The Knight came with the armour, and this comes with an owl, a gem, and a crystal ball piece. It comes with 11 pieces, including the wand, owl, and gem, and no spares, which doesn't really matter as it doesn't need any. The box sports the set number, age range (which I blissfully ignore X-D), awesome Castle logo, and the assembled set, with the usual 1:1 scale picture of a minifig. The back of the box shows pictures of the boxed Skeleton Tower and King's Castle Siege sets. Note the price is in New Zealand dollars, and is really the same prica as any other Impulse set. Next are the instructions, which are separated into 3 parts, 1 for the minifigure, 1 for the table, and one for the bird stand. Very simple, also worth mentioning is the parts numbers are next to their respective parts, for replacement parts etc. On the back we see (on the top half) pictures of Skeleton Prison Carriage, Skeleton Tower, and King's Castle Siege, this time not of the boxed sets, but the sets themselves. On the lower half we have 8 pictures, each of the different Impulse sets. The Wizard's torso is plain sand blue, with no patterns or anything, but it doesn't really matter is his beard's in the way. ;-) The head is that same old 'white fade to grey beard' head, but the white beard covers up most of the grey. My favourite part is the pants, I love that we're getting printed belts and legs again. His belt has 4 gold crosses (as seen in, if you look closely, the new Crownie's torso and the Crownie archer's torso) and a belt buckle, and the legs have a bottle, a coin, and a small bag. Nice little wizard-ey items. The, er, items, no, accessories, no, models? The stuff in the set include a little stand for the owl, and a table utilising the new 4x4 round piece in light bley, with the crystal ball in the middle, encasing the yellow gem held on by a 2x2 circle piece in blue. Why blue, I'm not sure. Maybe it's because the crystal is yellow, and the Crownie's colours are blue and gold, so the blue piece with the yellow crystal symbolise the Crownie's colours. Or maybe TLC just felt the need to include an odd colour. :-P In conclusion, this is a wonderful set, with some neat accessories, and it doesn't really need to be bought in the masses, after all, you needs an army of owls and wizards? :-| :-P So it works fine as a single set, and adds a more fantasy feel to your Crownie army. That's all for today folks! *sweet* [/Redman] Thanks for reading another of my Redman interviews, any suggestions on how to/what to do to improve it is greatly appreciated, as are all comments and criticisms (except those blatant thoughtless criticisms that don't help at all :-P)! ~Peace Edited by KimT, 10 August 2008 - 01:31 PM.	positive
simonwillems, on Jan 20 2008, 02:59 PM, said: Thanks for the review of this nice little set. For it's price (3 euros here in Holland) it contains quite a lot of useful parts. The only thing that could have been better in my opinion is the wand, I always liked this one: I miss those wands! They could've used it, but I think the wood wand kindda adds "realis" to the set, and since many fans don't like their castle theme to be too fantasized, I guess Lego decided to use a mold that was still being used for various sets. When I get this set I'm going to put it on the Tower in the King's castle, you know, the one that is right above the throne room? ;-) That'll be a great spot, and then I'll finally have all the necessary characters, the King in his throne, the knights on the walls, the wizard on his tower top, and the Princess in her tower room that floats in mid air and is connected to the throne room by a 2-stud wide bridge! :-D I love the King;s castle siege set *wub*	neutral

Well, since no-one seems to have done one for this set, here we go.... Here's the complete set in all its glory. Yes, I really like it, but then, Tabletown has the capacity to support it and my green Army have their eyes on it as a potential military transport as well. :-) I'll start out with the little airport ground car thingy - very neat and functional, here are views front and back: Next up, the steps which allow the plane crew to embark and disembark: And to round off this little trio, the cargo loading platform, here in its lowered position. Note the prong thingy sticking out from the rear: And here raised. The prong thingy is now hinged up to support the back of the platform and keep it level: Here's a slightly different angle so you can see the pieces under there: The all-important cargo itself! Hmmm...not much for a plane this size... The cargo pallet slots neatly onto the loading platform: Here's the complete set of ground equipment - all attached: And so onto the plane itself. Note that unlike the other large planes, the main wing sits at the TOP of the row of bricks making up the side of the fuselage: I took it apart a little so you can see the internal construction of the fuselage. Note that the cargo area is really small, right at the back. What else is this thing carrying? Illegal immigrants? :-) A picture of the rear of the fuselage, just because I like the sticker: Front landing gear. WAY better than on the other large planes. I don't know if this is a new piece or what but I've had no problems with it at all, and my kids have been playing with it as well: The rather sexy rear undercarriage - this area reminds me of one of those giant Russian transport planes - wicked: Those angled grey slopes atop each side of the rear undercarriage annoy the heck out of me as they KEEP COMING OFF whenever I pick the plane up. I think a 1x4 plate on top to bind them together might solve that. A slightly blurry view (sorry) from underneath. The gear LOOKS like it might be capable of retracting internally, but alas, no. This is a shame as there's certainly enough room in there and it's a wasted opportunity IMO. Might have to modify that... A view of one of the four engines, I personally think they look too small and should have something under the wing as well to make them rounder: Cockpit: Crew door, open. I LOVE the smooth action of these doors and the way they seal flush against the fuselage when closed: Cargo door, open: Crew door with docked ladder: Cargo door with docked loading platform: Cargo slots inside and locks into place the same way it sits on the loader, neat: The minifigs, sorry this one is a bit blurry: And that concludes this week's "Show and Tell".

sweet plane looks much better than in the catalogs *sweet*	positive
Lt. Veers, on Feb 4 2008, 11:42 PM, said: I do admit the amount of cargo is rediculously small, but It still looks good. Say, how much can the plane hold? Thanks for the review! *sweet* That's all the space you get. Now, it MIGHT be possible to rip out that rear bulkhead at the back of the wing and fill the middle area with tiles so cargo pallets could slide up the fuselage. But that would definitely prevent the undercarriage folding internally if that's what you wanted to do as well. Dr. S.	neutral
Thanks for the review and pics Dr S! I am still considering this set. What is the instruction manual number?	neutral
I loved the pics in the catalogues but was a bit disappointed by the build and end result. My own thoughts: CONs: - as noted, the cargo space is really small considering the size of the plane, although I can see this is restricted due to playability - without the barrier in the middle, the cargo would slide all over the place while the plane was being swooshed - the cargo 'lift' (I'm not sure how else to describe it) is very weak and snaps off, although it is a clever design I think it's badly implemented - there is nothing to hold the cargo pallet to the cargo lift truck so it tends to slide off all over the place as soon as the truck moves - colour issues - I had at least 3 shades of green with the larger plane pieces and noticeable variances even with identical cargo hatch pieces. At least one of them also came quite scratched, which was a little disappointing - At $79.95 AUD it's $10 more than the Passenger Plane was with less pieces and figs, and no printed pieces whatsoever! more $ for less, methinks. PROs: - Lots of nice cargo crate pieces and even the stickers for these are pretty good. - landing gear piece adjusts very well to height differentials so the plane doesn't lose its gear as often as the earlier passenger planes - the hinging mechanism works very well to open the cargo holds - opens very smoothly and is not noticeable - I'd definitely like to see more of this technique - the little vehicles work well chained together and are all good small designs OVERALL: - I really like the large planes since 06 but I don't think they've still quite hit the nail on the head. Whereas the earlier planes were a little flimsy, this one is sturdier but has its own issues. The look of the Cargo Plane is nice, and the new landing piece and cargo hatch pieces are really great, but some design weaknesses and colour issues detract from the overall product. It's a shame as with a bit of tweaking this could have been a must-have set.	negative

Thanks for the review That seems to be a nice set but as far I'm concerned, I don't think it's worth EUR 49.99. There aren't so many parts though those new curved slope will add some more building possibilities. *y* What lacks : - A 2 x 4 cut out in the lower part of the nose to retract the landing gear. - A 4 x 6 cut out in the lower part of the tail to allow passagers to get off through the back like in a DC-10 - some real plates and tiles instead of these crappy wings. This part is the useless one that TLC ever produced *n*	negative
The amount of cargo that huge plane carries! 8-? green peace would have a field day! X-D Nice review Dr S but this set is just too big for my town scale! ;-) Edited by casewindu, 05 February 2008 - 09:54 PM.	neutral
Dr. S: I was not planning on buying this set after my disappointment with the other large airplane, but after looking at this image review, I just might buy. The green color is really the aspect that makes this airplane stand out. I think it looks great! Thanks for the review.	positive
Thank for the review Doc! The only thing I like in this set is the small car. So I will not buy this set just for it! I really dislike those new planes, toooo bbiiiigggg! With this size, this cargo plane can carry just fiew things! What a shame! I think that the way TLC has made the wings is not very good... Like the rest of those big pieces... Just my thought. The positif point of this it's that it makes me saved some money :-D	negative

At my local Wal*Mart there was most of the 2008 sets including the Indiana Jones ones :'-) I picked up this one and the Motorcycle Chase! Name: 7621 Lost Tomb Price: $20.00 Parts: 277 Figs: 3 *Box Art First off we have the great Indiana Jones Box art!! I must say the designers did an excellent job on it! I love the little temple design with skulls! As well as including Indy in the right hand corner. The back of the box is just as cool showing all the neat play features of the set as well as an advertisement for the Indiana Jones Game *Figs First off we have our hero, Indian............. What the hell? Why is there a freaking CW Anakin head on Indy!! There was a production slip up as instead of Indy's head I get Anakin's! :-| |-/ I open the box up and there staring me in the face is his ugly face!! TLC is defiantly doing to here a gnarly complaint from me!! >:-( Ok now here we have the " real" Indy fig that is supposed to come with the set :-D I just noticed that his fedora hat goes down in the back! Bonus Picture Time, Here is a jacketless Indy with his sleeve torn off, like he looks in the Temple of doom *sweet* The next figure up is our lovely Marion *wub* *wub* *wub* Plus her head is reversible with a scared face X-D Love the new hairpiece in black!! Finally we have our undead skellie with second style head and poseable arms *The Well Of Souls The set itself is a nice model and playset! The Anubis statues are very cool and I love all the hieroglyphs on the walls 8-? Here is the SW link with Artoo and 3P0 X-D The Ark in its resting place The Ark removed, its very cool indeed, but TLC should have made the whole thing in chrome gold |-/ not metallic gold with brown and yellow!! The closeup of the Anubis statue, Yes the Eye is a sticker but at leasts a gold color! *Playability First off you can pull the pin on the Anubis statues which send them falling and taking out the walls. Behind the wall a skellie swings out! There is a lever in the back of the model where you push down and the snakes shower down upon the figs hehe With the snakes all around, Marion is both modeling with the new carrot torch and fending off viscous cobras :-D In the meantime Indy uses his whip to scale the wall and avoid all the snakes which he is afriad of. In the meantime leaving Marion behind to fight them off. :-P The whip is bendable but it will always snap back into a coil, its some type of bendy hard plastic *Scoring Figs- 9/10 Model- 8/10 Playability- 8.5/10 Overall Satisfaction- 4/10 (would be 9/10 if it wasn't for the stupid Anakin head error!) In the end this is a charming set and could easily fit in with the adventurers! It has the cool Anubis statues as well as the Ark. Plus Indy, Marion and a skellie, great selection of figs but Sallah would have been better since he actually removes the ark with Indy However I am still wondering the point of the Anubis statues, this set does seem pretty silly :-P P	neutral

It looks to me that the little building is supposed to be like some sort of Customs checkpoint between one nation and another or like a toll facility on a highway.

Hello and welcome to another, oh wait, first Batbrick and iamded review! Today us two sworn enemies will be reviewing the Creator Cargo Chopper, here is the front of the box: And while pushing iamded to his doom, here is the back: Haha! Ouch! Oh dear...here are the parts anyway... Here is the instruction of the first model, the Cargo Chopper. I love Creator sets for the different models, they always excite me. Just ignore me finishing off my nemesis in the background. Something very interesting that I liked in the instructions was this step where you must add those three 2x2 yellow rounded pieces under the chopper. This is for support while you build, which is handy, and later you take it off: And even later use it as the cargo. I found that to be rather innovative and clever, as well as - Hey! What are you hitting me for? Both instruction booklets have the same back: Now heres the Chopper itself. I love the design of it, it isn't quite minifig scale but its great all the same. This is my first non-Xpod or House creator set, and it sure is fun. Here me and iamded go for a dizzy ride. I love the nose of the copter, and the landing gear is fantastic. A shot from the other side. Oh dear, it seems we've been a bit sick from that ride, and were vomiting transgreen 1x1s. The cargo itself is nicely made, though I forgot to put on two tiles here :-$ . It fits in real well with the chopper to, and the line is great for giving iamded the wedgie he deserves: This is my first power function set, so I was pretty excited. The motor is intergrated really well into this set, and is activated by pushing that little 3x2 plate with the 1x1 slopes on it forward, until it hits the motor button, that orange knob. Another point of interest is the use of bley barrels on each side. I like this as I don't have those pieces in that colour. A shot of the motor. Its really simple, all you do is pull the hook out to any length that allows, then press the orange button and it will wind it back up. This makes the Chopper pull the cargo up into its bay, and iamded pull me here reluctantly to a whacking: A top view, is that MY head? A view of the chopper without the cargo in it. I love the lowered cockpit: The leftover pieces from building: (NOTE: iamded's head does not count as set piece) And a final shot of the set with me and iamded. Oh, it appear we're dead, oh dear... Hope you enjoyed this review, soon I will post the two alternate models. I loved this chopper, its great to play with and has nice construction. It also has some handy pieces too. The motor function sounds like a gimmick but is well intergrated into this model. Well worth the price, so far this is another win for Creator I say! So far I recommend this model, but later we'll see if the alt models are up to scratch. Also, since this is my first review, comments and criticism welcome on everything. Batbrick Away! >:-) Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 06:37 PM. Indexed	positive
Thank you very much for a fine review, Batbrick. *y* What the.... I never realized these cool grey barrels till now.... that?s pretty interesting. :-) The whole Chopper looks very good, with a well fitting power function. It?s for sure a rewardable work to change that baby into a real MF version with accessible cockpit. :'-)	positive

It doesn't bother me that it's not mini-fig scale, as it looks more for display IMO. *wub* Looking forward to seeing the final model! *y* ~Peace	positive
Thanks guys, heres the final part: The Instructions for the boat begin on page 46: The overall set, its actually much nicer than I thought it would be, the pictures on the box make it look ugly. Top view, Tommy Guns do not actually come with set ;-) Side view, the designers have done an excellent job with the hull, considering the lack of many slopes pieces. You can see it is pretty much minifig scale too: Here you can see that by pushing in the red technic axle, the "anchor" on the front will be hauled back into the boat: Back view, these outboard motors are pretty cool, though I wish they could go own into the water more: Overall, though the weakest model, its still a lot of fun, and has a clever way around the lack of a shapely hull. I was impressed with it after the building it, it even has two rounded SNOTTy bottom pieces on the nose of the boat to give the impression it is speeding through the water with the front lifting up. Lots of leftover pieces for this one: The pieces: Sorry about the poor photograph there, it was getting late :-$ Overall the Cargo Chopper is another great set in the fantastic Creator line. Loads of fun, great play, and some clever designs, it challenges you to make your own things, and even includes some nifty pieces (bley barrels! *wub* ) I won't give it a rating, but I'll just say I certainly recommend it to fans of the theme and Lego fans in general. Now, finally, iamded and I teamup in the face of a larger foe. Get that Lord of Pies! Batbrick Away! >:-)	positive

Very nice review, Lord of Pies! Thanks for taking the time to put this together, and especially for all the detailed pics. *y* I very much regret that my dark ages occured when they did. Basically, I missed out on all the cheap and easy troop building sets, and this one is certainly no exception. The big sets are nice, but these are the ones that always make me wish just a little harder for a return of LEGO pirates... :'-) I gave it a 4 out of 5, just because I'd buy 4 out of 5 sitting on the shelves today, were it possible.	positive
Great little set! I bought this set only a few years ago MISB and I am still very happy about it. The hut is simple but very effective as a castaway building on some deserted island, the palmleaves are a good addition to any Lego collection. This set had a nice amount of weapons, two for each pirate and two of those weapons are flintlock muskets as opposed to just pistols. Nice poll as well, but you made sure nobody can give this set a 1 which is very nice (but probably a little mistake :-D ). I gave it the top-rating. *y*	positive
Great small set that can help you add to you minifig count. The little boats are always cool, and the den isn't that bad either.	positive
Another first-rate review! It's a nice little set with a big number of minifigs. And 2 flintlock guns is also a nice bonus.	positive
A very nice review of a pretty and neat little set, thanks Lord Of Pies, guess it´s a 3 for me, with strong tendencies to 4....	positive
Well since this topic has resurfaced, I would add my 2 cents about my appreciation of this set. It was the first and (unfortunately) the largest Pirate set I owned as a kid, but I played the wazoo out of it. Some of the minifigs have lost almost all their face printing after so many play sessions! Theres just something about the hut that appealed to me more than the cheesy skull-face islands we keep getting.Probably that it wa kind of neutral, good for my pirates, settlers or islanders. Though the palm leaves were rather fragile and used to break off the studded parts. It would be nice to get more of these "beach village army builder" sets.

Tks for taking the time to make once again such a fantastic one ;-) The overall look of the building is brilliant and I love the nice additions they did: the cheese and mouse (Jerry :-D ) is hilarious !! I didn't know Green Grocer had a rodent infestation !! And the use of the new built furniture and detils like the radiator is freaking awsome !! Also that set has a definite plus for me: its the back details !! I love the stairs, the deck with table !! Wowx that is what I call sweet backdoor details !! Now its clear that I will need to buy the 3 sets asap !! Tks once again Dunamis ;-) *yoda*	positive
Very nice. Very nice, indeed. Lots of lovely, little details, even at the back. This review hasn't changed my opinion one bit, I'm still looking forward to when I can finally pick up mine at the post office. I'm crossing my fingers that there will be more buildings following after this one. I'm guessing that LEGO's just testing the waters to see how far AFOL's are willing to go regarding price vs. details. Green Grocer is still epic, though.	positive
Man, these sets are so awesome. Incredible work done by the designers there, must have took a long time to get all this ogether. if they weren't too expensive i would go and buy them all 3 right away *wub*	positive

Looks like you have the original 1989 version with the yellow top cylinders. :-) I got one too several years ago, although I probably paid too much for it. :-P On a side note, if that pneumatic tubing feels harder and stiffer than the modern type, I highly recommend that you don't use it and buy some of the newer stuff off Bricklink instead. TLC originally used a different material for the tubes and this stuff degrades the nozzles (on pistons, switches and so on) over time. The old tubes also grip the nozzles much more firmly and if you aren't careful when removing them, it's actually possible to rip off the nozzles completely. X-O I had this happen a few years ago, although TLC replaced my broken pistons for free. I got rid of that stuff for good after that, although the pistons on my Power Crane still have slightly discolored nozzles. Edited by CP5670, 10 March 2008 - 04:57 AM.	neutral

Hi! This is my third (old-school) technic set review! I don?t want to talk much, please enjoy just the pictures! #1 the parts: #2 building: The two axles, you can see in the middle, are not connected and don?t belong to each other. The axle on the left side is for the steering, on the right side for the engine. The dark-gray ?Technic Gear 16 Tooth with Clutch? allows the connection from the differential gear to the engine, trough the axle for the steering. The V6-engine: The winch: That?s a part you don?t see everyday: a 1x2 Rack. It only reappears in 2 sets from 2001 and 2004. (The Rebel Wrecker has been released in 1994.) The ?Front double wishbone with anti-sway bar?-suspension (yeah, I got it from Technopedia! X-D ) The finished model: #3 random shots: I really like this picture! Authoritative, isn?t it? 8-? :-D Thanks for viewing the pictures! Please comment if you want to!	neutral
Thanks for reviewing all these old sets! Will you be doing any more?	positive
This set is really cool. I might actually get it!	positive
Nice pictures. I also sort out the pieces the same way if I'm rebuilding a model. *y* This set packs a lot of functionality into a fairly small size, but was rather expensive for its size ($70) when it was still available, compared to other sets of that time. You can also rig up the Technic flag sticker that it comes with to the main model. I've done that on mine. You may want to reinforce it with tape if you're going to leave the model on display though, as it will break up over time due to UV exposure like many stickers do. I had to do that with mine after it started to crack, although it still looks pretty good.	positive
the only original stickers are the front headlight-patterns on the 2 red 1x2 bricks. The others have been destroyed - must have been the bad decaying sticker quality that breaks when you'll remove it - so I printed them. I didn't print the flag for only the alternate model needs it, although it's a neat idea...! and LordGalewind: clickey! I keep that in mind. One of my 8880 is already dusty enough!	negative
Thanks! You've just motivated me to go on a "senseless-preliminary-design-errors-hunt"...! A few things I've discovered: Left Side (Alternate Model): the steering link can only be put in place with a little violence... the handlebar (?) is turned (far more than it's actually possible) although the wheels are straight. Right Side: The 1x8 Tile simonwillems pointed out The half bush right next to it is... *can't_find_the_words* ..."wrong". Could be that the Technic Triangle is missing. The "windscreen"- 1x6 Technic Plates are mounted with 1/2 pins instead of Axle Pins with half bushes. Who can find more...? X-D	neutral

Man..., this set is a disaster what were they thinking! :-D :-P I just remembered one other fun aspect of this set: The crane hook can be attached to the underside of the rear bumper, to hold it in position while driving along, but when things are like this and you try and wind up the cable the winch is strong enough to break the (original provided Lego) rope.... It 'worked' with my copy. :-D So this set is capable of demolishing itself.... But still, one of the best Technicsets I have, with all stickers intact. I'm not so sure about that flag though, must check on that.	positive
Wow, that first picture is great! You must have a very wide angle lens with the capability to focus very close (macro). The perspective makes the model look huge. Nice work. I think the suspension on this set is my favorite of all Technic. It has such large travel and is so.... what word should I use..... "bouncy". Hey, why do you only review sets which are red? :-D Eric	positive

Any physics teacher would have to admit that a really fast car, approaching the speed of light, will always look red as it drives away due to red shift!! X-D On the other hand, 8880 looks pretty fast and it is black, although I have seen pictures of one that someone built in red. Yellow might be good too. Some cars even look fast in green.

Reread your review today! Great pictures! This IS a fabulous model. Got this model a few months ago for just € 25! It is small and has great working parts. I love the way the front-suspension is made! Epic! I only had the light-stickers replaced with trans-clear bricks. BTW: The gear rack has been used in this years 8048 Buggy!	positive
I also happened to receive this set this weekend, virtually MISB (the seals on the side of the box were loose, however everything inside was untouched). This little beast a joy to build and even more so to play with! As indicated by Eric on the technicopedia page, it's crammed with functions for a medium-sized set. I think I love it even more than my son does	positive
Hello, my dear friends! Here's something new. I am actually making a review with pictures! Yes, I got a new camera for christmas. Now I was testing to see how the camera would reflect, so some of the pics are a bit blurry. I have based this review from Dunamis's reviews. He is my inspiration.So, without further ado, I bring you the Review! Set #: 7693 Name: ETX Alien Strike Price: $19.99, ?12,99 Pieces: 246 Box: Okay, so as you can see below, the Box is pretty simple. As always, European versions won't have the Piece count, name, etc, just the Number I believe. Mine, having the American Version, has the info on it. as you can see, it has the Classic MM logo, and the red Planet, as well as the set in a pose itself. Very Nice. I linked it because the Pic wasn't resizing. http://www.brickshel...ke/dscn0017.jpg Below is the back of the box. It shows the other sets and some features of this set. Contents: Next we have the Contents. This set includes a medium sized DSS (xwingyoda), a bag labeled one, and HUGE bag labeled two, the 1 bag contains a smaller bag, and the two bag includes two smaller bags. 5 bags in all. Also pictured are the instructions. I have linked it due to the non-resize. http://www.brickshel...ke/dscn0019.jpg Figs: Included in this set are three figs. Two jellies, and 1 astro. The jeelies are fine, but I pefer the LoM ones. But they glow. Those new alien commanders for Summer look promising though. The astro is nice, and includes an extra gold Visor. MOC ON! Astro Miner: In all MM sets there is a human and alien set. The Astro par of this set is a Mini-miner. Here is a pic of construction and that wonderful space logo sticker. Not Much of a cockpit. :-/ Finished Miner(The set number, too): Overall I like the miner, and It is nicely designed. I feel the cockpit is lacking though. Aliens: The alien Vehical is the Main part of the set. This pic shows the beginning steps. Solid and sturdy. But those four axles/pin parts(blue) are pointless. No support, and they don't get used at all. Nice TLC. :-| Now we get cooking! This pic shows the tail added on and the more bulk being built. We get a little repetitive and build the craft up in this pic. And this pic from the instructions shows how the alien craft transforms for battle. The completed set and extra bits. Parts: 8/10 Figs 8/10 Price Per Piece ration: 9/10 Playability: 9/10 Overall: 85% The alien craft is great. The attack feature is nice and there are a ton of trans green parts. The alien falls out of the cockpit when turned upside down. I love this set, and it's perfect for MM fans or beginners.It has nice parts, and read the above part for more details. Gallery when Moderated. Keep an eye out for future reviews! Please comment. :-)	positive
Sweet first pic review! *y* I got this set for a birthday present last year, and it is pretty fun overall. The alien ship in this set is actually one of my favorites. It just looks cool, and the way you can fold it out is really clever. The only negative for me is the cockpit of the mining unit. Not really because it isn't detailed, but because mine is top heavy, and keeps falling forward. It's kinda funny if you think about him driving along and then falling forward...but not funny at all when you're playing. |-/	positive

X-D phoinix, on Mar 12 2008, 10:18 PM, said: thanx for the review. i have one question. do these aliens have moving arms? as far as the set goes i think lego did a bad job on the alien ship. i dont think any of the alien ships look good in Mars Mission the human fanction got a lot better this year and i would have bought this buggy if it came by its self.. No, they don't. kill will, on Mar 12 2008, 11:27 PM, said: My friend has this set and the alien ship's wings are wobbly and overall :-X He may have built it wrong, I'm not sure, I didn't see the build.

Thanks for the review! I do like this set, though I am not a fan of the jelly aliens, though The alien ship looks good with the curved parts and flip open and close design!	positive

Hi! This is my forth (old-school) technic set review! Since blakbird pointed out that all my technic reviews are red, I chose a yellow dune blaster for today! just kidding. this set is red as it should be! (Don't worry my next reviews will be yellow and black... uhhh forshadowing... ;-) ) I will start with some facts! 277 elements and released in 1994 that's enough. #1: the box: #2: the parts: #3: building instructions and catalogues: Wow! No folds, no wear marks - simply: *wub* "Was lesen coole Kids?" - "KLICK! Das super Magazin fuer coole Kids!" (How obvious...) #4: building: No differential. I really love the way the 1x8 Technic Bricks on the sides will be positioned later. Fun fact: the engine contains no 2L-Technic Axle. ...and finished. A real quick build. #5: spare parts: ...for the alternate model. The yellow Technic Handle should be from 8412. Maybe a bonus feature from the seller! #6: random shots: #7: final thoughts: This is my second 8829 and I also noticed that the engine turns very hard. The alternate model is really (sorry to all those of you who like it) crappy. I mean- a nice idea, but not with this wheels! :-| Anyway: a really beautiful Technic-set! *reminiscing* (this word exists, does it?) thanks for viewing the pictures, I hope you enjoyed it! Please comment if you want to! Edited by BerndDasBrot, 21 March 2008 - 02:09 PM.	positive
That looks like a very nice set! :-) In your opinion, how does it compare to the current Dune Buggy? -Toa Of Justice	positive
I don't own the 8296, but what I can see from the pictures, I would say that 8296 is very similar to 8829. The only things that are different ist that 8296 is studless and features a steering wheel for the seat. But 8829 has got bigger wheels... >:-) It also would have been nice, if the wheels from 8296 could have the same tread.	neutral
Blakbird, on Mar 22 2008, 03:56 PM, said: IMHO, 8829 is much better than 8296. First, 8829 is a lot bigger. I really like the huge rear balloon tires. They both have rack and pinion steering, and they both have trailing arm rear suspension with a V-2 engine. I think the body on 8829 is a little more well done. For 8296, I think the alternate tractor model is much better. For more comparisons, see Technicopedia. Eric Wow! 8-? Thanks for that cool link, Blakbird! X-D I agree that 8829's body is better. I especially like 8829's rear spoiler and its angled side beams. :-) -Toa Of Justice	positive
Hello All Apologize for digging out a such old post. Recently I got a bag of Lego Technic parts where there have been mixed three sets: 8858, 8829 and 8235 The resurrection of 8858 has been described by me in a separate post. Going back to the Dune Buggy – when I saw it for the first time back in 1994 I did not like it, as I was always big fan of 8840 (which I consider to the day the best looking Buggy) and set 8829 looked to me ugly. So there were those all parts in the bag… then I though why not build it ? And I started to do it. When I finished I was very surprised how the final look of this set is! Really taking my words back. Unfortunately in the bag there were missing some parts and I could not rebuild the back spoiler. So I made some changes to it and make it from spare parts that I have and it came out acceptable. I also added some additional parts such as “fake” steering wheel, “Rally” logo, antennas. I have also reverse mounting of the rear tires – why Lego did them like that I never know – as I think they look better this way. Set: well the review has been already made by owner of this post so I will only add few things into it. Engine – V2 (aired cooled?) is driven by 4 gears -> from the single wheel (no differential as in 8840) using two old school z14 tooth bevel , then by z24 tooth crown and z8 tooth type 1. Actually the (as in most old sets) the pistons are moving very fast (not as in current sets) and smooths – I needed to extra clean all engine parts as there was a lot friction. Suspension – set has “engine bay” working using two old gray shock absorbers 6,5l – the movement is not big but works very nice, better then in 8840 in my opinion. Steering – this is a bit odd as there is no direct connection to HoG as in most old sets, but first the gear rack is moved by z8 then two z14 tooth where reverse movement is taking place. Later connection of two old school z14 tooth bevel goes to HoG Details – this is the most that I like in this set, specially how the use of axle pin connector perpendicular and 1x10 bricks with 3x3 cut corners and plate 1x5 toothed ends 2 studs with center axle hole are making the body shape – is just wonder. Tires – the balloon rear are pretty nice the front is a new version of those that were in 8840. What I do not like: 1. Missing of Technic Figure (8840 had it.) 2. no steering wheel in the original set 3. no differential – but having in mind that Lego has introduce 24-12 teeth would be difficult to build the transmission in such small space where the engine is. I will shortly upload new pictures and post them here later on . Over all – I think it is worth buying it as it is very payable ! Actually very payable and runs smoothly , the steering, suspension – perfect Thank you and regards	positive

Thanks for the review, I think i'll certainly get these sets. They look very nice and have nice minfigs (I love racing, as long as minifigs could sit in them).

I was thinking of getting one of those off BL several years ago, back when the price used to be more like $15 or so, but I realized that I hardly ever use the couple that I already have. :-P They came out with the modern turntable the year after this set, which mostly negated the need for these screw axles. I think their only use now is to hold non-Lego objects onto models, like the Technic pen in 8094. I guess you can try to make linear actuators out of them, but they're often too rare and fragile for that.	neutral
BerndDasBrot, on Mar 23 2008, 02:32 PM, said: Hi! This is my forth pre-old-school review. As promised: a yellow-set ! My 8862 arrived today, survived the washing machine coaster and actually was real fun to build! The finished “boom / jib / scoop thing” (=BJST) :-| X-D thanks for viewing the pictures, I hope you enjoyed it! Another great review and a wonderful set of pictures. I like your nomenclature for the BJST. Acronyms always sound nicely scientific; much better than "digger". No one would know you made it up until they found out what it means. I also really like what I will call your "kinetic photos". They convey a sense of motion and show the range of the mechanism without the big file sizes of animations. How long of a shutter speed did you use? The secret to not getting too much friction in the turntable is using extra nuts and jamming them together. You don't want to actually clamp the nuts tight across the turntable. You want to jam two nuts tightly together at each end which prevents them from unwinding, but still leave a little free play (gap). This way it will hold the assembly together but not prevent it from moving. Mine moves quite easily. This same concept is used on the pen plotter or 8094. "Slewed"? I think that's a word. How about "slewn" or "slain" or "slewifacated"? I think "rotated" is best. *sweet* Eric	positive
By the way, don't forget to build the alternate model of 8862. It is a combine (farm equipment) which is just as good as 8274. I liked it so much that I bought two copies of this set so I could display both. My favorite alternate model (not counting Universal Sets) is the 8480 submarine. Maybe it is time for a white set review? *skull* White is pretty rare. For your blue set, I recommend you review 8462. There are only a couple of green sets, and 8479 is the best. And then of course, 8458 is silver!! I think we all know what the best black set is. And according to your photography, you have lots of them! But don't forget 8868. Eric	positive
Quote How long of a shutter speed did you use? 15 seconds. Quote By the way, don't forget to build the alternate model of 8862. I will review it too and post it in this topic! Quote "Slewed"? I think that's a word. How about "slewn" or "slain" or "slewifacated"? I think "rotated" is best. actually I took it from your site! X-D Quote White is pretty rare. unfortunately I don't own 8480 but I think 8824 is also a very good (though small) white set! 8462 rocks as a blue set. I just got it a few weeks ago. Let's see... 8462 also is one of the last TECHNIC sets I would call Old-school. 8479... okay too, but 8458 is IMHO not. 8868 and the totally mysteriously black set will follow...! Quote I was thinking you could somehow attach a 16-tooth dark gray gear (the one that spins freely around axles) to the nut, which would make the axle move in and out when the gear turned and convert the gear's rotary motion to linear motion in a fairly compact package. Did you had something like this in mind? if the toothed 10L axle rotates the axle nuts want to rotate too but they can't because of that 2x4 Technic Plate. So they'll decide to move along the axle. The 1x6 Bricks on each end make sure that the axle won't move in or out. Thanks for your feedback!	neutral

Yeah, the Tow Truck was the last set that still used mainly studded beams. They made many changes to Technic the following year, with models becoming predominantly studless and making heavy use of the flexible axles/hoses and decorative panels. The Technic logo and box art style was also changed a lot. I really like the overall construction of that set. The model is fairly lightweight but extremely sturdy. It must be one of the strongest large sets they've released. Quote Did you had something like this in mind? That's basically the idea. As Blakbird said though, it wouldn't be very powerful and would put the axle under some stress. The linear actuators they're bringing out this year do the same thing and should work much better.	positive
Blakbird, on Mar 25 2008, 06:42 PM, said: Wow, that's a long exposure. I would think you would get way too much light and overexpose the image. The aperture must have been tiny. for the aperture I don't know what I've used, but my room was already very darkend as I tool the photos. It was actually serendipity. ;-) Blakbird said: Cool. I am also planning to write about the combine on Technicopedia. I will but I'll need some time. I really shoud do a few things for university (that's also the reason why I succeded in so many other things... :-| ) Blakbird said: You don't own 8480? That is unacceptable. It is imperative that you put a mortgage on your house immediately to get it! NOT AGAIN!!! *sing* (just kidding. my parents will. X-D ) Blakbird said: While the assembly you have drawn would work as a linear actuator, I would not recommend it. The torsional stiffness and strength of an axle are proportional to the polar moment of inertia, a section property. Most of the stiffness comes from the outside of the cross shaped axle. But in the threaded axle, you lose all the stiffness of the outer area because it is not continuous. This means you only get stiffness and strength from the small core. I think the threaded axle would bend and break very easily if subjected to much torque. The toothed 10L axle doesn't look very robust, you're right.

Thanks for the review. And for giving me directions :-P I think the design of these two cars looks to be better than in the other set. The drivers are positioned lower compared to the windscreen and the design of the front on th red car is really nice.

As promised, and with only a single day of delay is my review of the 2008 set: 4994 Creator Fierce Creatures. This small set is the same size and price range as last year's 4939 Cool Cars reviewed by prateek and dillthepill. The box General info You get 193 pieces (vs 206 for Cool Cars) which is quite a lot, but most of them are small. There are a lot of hinges and some good slopes and wings. The building instructions contains three models, but no further ideas for inspiration. Primary model: Spider The first model is a big spider which shares some similarities to the secondary model of 4895 Power in the design. The legs each have 3 joints, where the ones in the middle have "stud joints" to be moved sideways while the rest use hinges for all joints. There are 8 of them and it does get a little tedious with all the repetitive building in this relatively small model. I like the design of the face with a lot of eyes and a big and ugly mouth, but the real gem is the X-pattern on the opisthosoma made using double/inverted slopes. It is poseable and I think it looks more "fierce" when inverted. Secondary model: Snake The face of the snake is nicely detailed with a splitting tongue and a mouth than can move a little. There is a problem with the construction. It uses stacked hinges for some of the joints, which are hard to pull apart without stressing the pieces. Tertiary model: Fly I'm not completely sure what this insect is. I will say it's a fly, although the tail and head are too pointy. This is a neat little thing. Conclusion Primary model: 8 It is a good design, but lacks some sturdiness in the legs. They fall off a little too easily. Secondary models: 6 They are pretty good when you look at the bricks that are available, but they don't wow you in any way and they suffer from the same issues as the primary model regarding sturdiness. Alternate models: 3 It is hard to come up with alternate models with so many small pieces and plates that are only 1 stud wide. The colors might make you want to build a Spyrius space ship. Playability: 8 The models have many movable joints and you can put quite a scare into your minifigs when their town gets attacked by these creatures... unless some EN forces are there to protect them. Price: 6 Creator sets are known for their great price to bricks ratio, but this set doesn't quite measure up to sets like Cool Cars. Pieces: 7 The pieces aren't great by themselves, but who doesn't need a fist full of hinges, slopes and basic plates in standard colors? I don't think this is a must-have set like the big rig was last year. The pieces are great and it has a nice primary model, but the set lacks a bit when it comes to the usual strong Creator qualities like alternate models and price.

Enchanted Island 6278 Pictorial Review Original price: $66 Pieces: 412 Figures: 7 This 1994 set marked the beginning of a new era for Lego Pirates - it became a theme more centralised around playability and not so much grand ol' ships. 6278 Enchanted Island was the flagship set of the Islanders subtheme, heavily based around Polynesian and Native American concepts (In fact, TLC was successfully sued by a number of tribes for using bastardised Maori names, such as Kahuka). It was released as a Legend set in 2001, but due to poor sales was discontinued again. The largest of the Islander sets, Enchanted Island is a portion of an island with a river running through. The left hand side features some sturdy buildings built into a tree-like structure on a rocky outcrop, whilst the left hand side features a tower built out of "wooden" posts and a large tribal statue. The box cover shows all the details; it does, however, differ from the instructions' finished product in that it has been more aesthetically arranged - bushes e.t.c. have been moved to fill in gaps and to not obscure other things. The sides of the box show nothing particularly special, although in one scene it depicts the Islander Canoe chasing the Pirate boat with the treasure; just one way to play with the set. The back of the box, however, is superb, featuring a large number of alternative models: a toothy statue, a Pirate tree (think Wolfpack) with an Islander base, Kahuka's throne, a fire-breathing statue and a souped-up boat for the pirates. These, and many more, can be easily made because of the large diversity of pieces. The set has a huge number of minifigures for its size, the third highest number in the Pirate range (The SES and the BSB being first and second, respectively) - a whopping 7! 5 Islanders, including the all-too-common King Kahuka, the elusive Islander babe and 3 standard warriors - this set alone will never leave you short of enemies! 2 pirates, Ironhook in his standard attire with a scurvy dog at his side attack the island, although they are only moderately armed - 2 cutlasses and a pistol between them; a musket would've been nice. The Islanders, on the other hand, have 4 shields, a bow and quiver and 6 spears, not to mention the big pokey thing with horns on top (Weapon? Idol? Staff?). A monkey, parrot and crocodile provide the obvious creature features, with a fair amount of gold to finish off. In the instructions, the goblet does not have the lid, although it does on the box; it's a nice touch anyway - adding a little more diversity to the monotonous treasure stashes. The pirates' boat is a nice 2 sail vessel, with oars for when the wind stops and a treasure map. The sails are similar to those in Lagoon Lockup, but with an extra front sail. It's an awesome little boat, better for raids than a rowing boat, but not too big that it can't sail up rivers. It can comfortably fit 2 men and, at a squeeze, 5. The sails are expensive if you buy them seperately; normally this won't be a problem, but they can cost aroun $5 each. The Islanders' boat is a canoe with a sail and an outrigger to stabilise it. The sail is beautifully done, with 2 spars taughtening it. There is a clip for the rower to leave his weapon when at se and the mast can turn to get as much wind as possible. It's quite a top-heavy boat, but it doesn't look hideous and without the mast/sail it looks great. 3 Islanders can fit in it, and more if they sit on the outrigger. The markings on the canoe are stickers, but they look fine and are probably more robust than markings for their job. Furthermore, they're waterproof! *sing* Kahuka's throne can be carried by 2 loyal subjects... ...Or strapped to his pet crocodile! The clips on the side can be used to rest his weaponry, or hold spears for battle. The throne looks nice, although I'm not too sure about the blue against the red - I'd have prefered white as it would clash less... An overview of the island; it is built in 2 halves - left then right and then joined together loosley, so it can be seperated for transporting. Around the back to the left and right, there are large open spaces that are great for battles - this set isn't so much about a large solid build, but creating a "village" - smaller structures linked by bridges. And the back... To the far left is a platform built onto the rock, with access from the river via a ladder. There's the standard Islander drum with the lovely zebra-skin part (Where did they get that?!). I've never understood the white flag - I was under the impression it was used for surrender... Further along the rocky bank, there are some hinged palm leaves that swing upwards to reveal... ...The treasure! It's an OK hiding place; not the best place to hide it, right where the pirates sail past, but it feels fabulous; it fits right in. Above it on the rocky bank is the main structure. It looks very disjointed when you build it (bricks all over the place), but once it's done it looks nice and rural, with leaves everywhere and the "balcony" where Kahuka is standing. You get a nice roof made from 2 large palm leaves tilting down. Around the back there's a slight shelter, a table for picnics and a ladder to access the upstairs. I was rather annoyed that it is so open, but the set is designed from just one perspective... To the left is the bridge to the other building... A nice, one piece bridge made of the softer plastic used for muskets and the post-1991 cutlasses. It looks good, but be warned! It tilts when you pull a pin, sending the pirates flying! This contraption is a good idea, but it is very stiff and so doesn't swing, even when burdened by a minifigure - you'll want to modify this bit if you get it. The other building looks like it is made out of posts and beams. They are all red; brown would have been better, but it would have added too many colours to the range, just like the use of black for trees in some forestmen sets. There are 3 clips for spare weapons; only 2 of these will ever be used when all the Islanders are armed, but it gives the pirates scope once they've been disarmed...There's another nice palm tree roof on top. 2 ladders give access...there's a total of 4 in this set - worth getting, eh? Although they're 5p on Bricklink, for a KABOB, they're like gold! At the top there's another hidey hole; the palm leaves lift up on hinges to show the treasure or hiding Islander. It can be seen from behind, but this set is designed from one perspective only. Nice cattlehorns too...alongside the slats you can see in the floor - 5 years later and it would've been a solid plate... The big statue is one of the main selling point of this set, alongside the tilting bridge - they're the action features shown in every catalogue at the time, but it is not really special, just original. The statue fits in with the theme perfectly - Kahuka's mask, his shield and this statue all depict the same deity, which is a nice "collectible" idea. The back is rather plain, except the angled 1x1 bricks - a good touch. I'm not sure why there's a black brick in the back of the head, but this is easily remedied; it could even be done with a brick from this same set, just swapping the two over... Aside from the head turning, the back can open to store sacred objects, or, in my opinion, prisoners, hence the gaps for breathing. Either way, it's a lovely piece of architecture and deservedly a flagship element of the set. There's your standard cooking pot floating around, although a 1x1 yellow stud as human flesh (remember, minifigs are yellow, no matter what the licensed themes say!) is a superb finish. This set is a stunning set for both kids and AFOLs who are just getting back into Lego/Pirates - it is a great army builder and, due to its release as a Legend, is extremely cheap on eBay - you should be able to pick one up for £18, or £15 if you're lucky. For that you get a lifetime's supply of Islanders, 4 ladders, some wall panels, 2 baseplates (one raised and both with rivers and printed vegetation around the edge), a ton of weapons, a fair quantity of standard bricks, but most of all, a heap of vegetation: This is an easy to buy set, with normally around 5 on eBay at any time, and is well worth it, for the parts, the play and the nostalgia! It can be easily modified; when used in conjunction with any other outpost, a much larger fortress can be made, especially if more rope bridges are used. if you pick 2 of this fine set off eBay (It'll still be less than the original price!), a huge complex can be constructed, giving you an instantaneous village for around £35.

Thanks for a lovely review! I only recently bought this set off Ebay (pretty good deal: MISB for 30 euro's!) and I enjoyed putting it together and mixing it with the other Piratesets. When you put two sets of two baseplates together you'll get a large pond with an island in the center, just to achieve that I bought two more baseplates off Ebay. The result is this MOC. I always loved the Islanders and have most of the sets, not all of them but that is going to change in the future. *y*	positive
Excellent review! I really like this set and so I gave it a 5/5. This set is on my list to get. I especially like the speedy pirate boat, and the also very fast outrigger canoe with a sail. I don't think a small number of these cannibals will make much of an impact on gaming though, even if they get a bonus with spears. Duke	positive
A mighty fine review you've created SlyOwl! *y* After some sleep I shall immerse myself more fully within it.	positive
Nice review ( although I'm pretty sure Eldorado Fortress has 8 minifigs, making this set no 4 in the minifig count.) I gave it a 5. The number of islanders and vegetation pieces comes in very handy for land based scenarios. I've got 3 copies of this set, 1 of them costing me less than 2Euro's from an ebay auction in Scotland. Along with Forbidden Island it's easily one of the most common and affordable pirate sets to be found on he second hand market.	positive
Yay! Pictures! Thank you for the review. You made me actually consider looking it up on ebay, but I already have so so many things to get on my want list. Drat my easy ability to get sold on something lego!	positive

Hello Eldiano. Although the review is fine and you have memories related to that set please have in mind that the post you were replying to was in fact some 7 years old. This is what we call "bumping of old topics" and it shouldn't be done.

Eldiano, thank you for posting about your desire to have this set. I do own the set, and I do recommend it to others if they somehow find a used one. The bricks are kind of sparse, but the the bricks it does come with are really nice, I love the figs, and the base plates are by far my favorite made by TLG. Captain Braunsfeld, I suggest that you read through the link that covers topic bumping more clearly. I apologize for the confusion Eldiano. I do believe that I have found a way to remove the confusion of posting in old topics soon among the Pirate Staff and to the other members of EB, please stay tuned.

Fortunately I got this set on 2000 (not the released version, the original one). And I said "fortunately" because it's a lovely set. How could I rate it, but awesome? A little Islander "army", the islander girl, Ironhook and that cool boat with two sails, the jail-polynesian statue. I must recognize that I have a thing with the Islanders. I know that they are weird, poorly based on the polynesian aborigens, etc. But they are very original, broke with the traditional enemies, and gave to the Pirates theme an exotic and wild look.	positive
I realized that building the chess set from the new pirates theme, they are two grey heads that reminded me of the king kahuna throne, which goes to say that I am hoping they bring back new sets, I just wish they were bigger. I would love to build the old ones, but I would side more towards the newer model if they ever released them.	negative
Judging from your pictures there seems to be many interesting torsos and new fleshy heads but I don't think this set is for me.

I'm in the same situation as you; I have this set but missed out on the newer 8421. This was a great set for its time but the 8421 definitely looks better to me. I've been trying to find a good deal on it on ebay but it's pretty expensive, considering that it only went out of production last year. Quote Inlay: I wonder why TLG doesn’t make inlays anymore… They’re noisy and brake easily but are great for (pre-) sorting. The box designs in general are crappier these days than they used to be 10 years ago. You don't see the old "featured parts" trays anymore and the boxes don't have the different sections either (these also acted as internal supports for larger boxes, so they were less prone to being crushed). The cardboard material is also quite a bit thinner. I think it's a result of TLC's overall cost-cutting moves since then. Most people toss the boxes and probably don't care, but I keep all of them. There was actually a time when the boxes used to be even stronger. I have an old 8859 set and the outer box is made of a hard, styrofoam material, although they probably stopped using that for environmental reasons.

For a Jedi it is time to eat as well !! Eat, Eat !! Hot !! Good food !!" :-D simonwillems said: It was the first large Technic set I was given by my parents, when it first came out in 1995. I played for hours with this set, making minifig seats in it (it was so huge there was room for four minifigs to sit next to eachother in front....) I made various applications for it, a bungee-jump system with a large rubber band, and lots of containers to be lifted. The first changes I made included the inverting of the wheels and the disabling of one of the flashlight-steering wheels because they obstructed eachother. By the way, the nob for your winch is yellow instead of black (I know this set by heart, so watch out :-P ). I always liked those nobs. and people think you can't play / MOC with Technic (at all)...! X-D about the nob: erm yeah. I only found 3 black ones in the box and so I took the yellow one that I got as an extra with 8829. simonwillems said: The alternate model was great fun too, the pump is cleverly hidden and the crane folds up great between the cab and the loading platform. You could easily mod it with a pneumatic claw on the crane, a motor to turn it and a compressor. The only flaw was the loading platform which had no floor (only some axles). another reason for the 8460 as favorite set? It's got a "real" alternate model, not just a different erm- crane. simonwillems said: Thanks so much for reviving my memorie concerning this great set!

Thanks for the review. *sweet* For it's size and parts count this is a remarkably featured set. I don't think I've never seen the alternate model before. Personally I prefer 8421 because I think it looks much better and I love the six wheel steering. I also love the three segment boom and the transmission; they fit it all in so neatly. I realise that it has trouble even holding up itself, but ultimately it doesn't matter as it's not like you are really going to construction work with it. What bothers me more about 8421 is the design change in the boom from chainlinks to strings. I would try to mod mine but all I have is the prototype picture to base it on... and I don't have enough links anyway! :-P BerndDasBrot, on Apr 7 2008, 07:29 AM, said: yeah, somehow I wonderd why only VBBN (thanks!) responded...

Set ref: 7625 Name: River Chase Number of minifigs: 4 Number of pieces: unknown Price: 22,90€ A general view of the set: We’ve got an amphibious vehicle, a small boat, an observation post and a dark green croco (so beautiful! ). For the figs, we’ve got Indy of course, Marion and two Russian soldiers, nothing special here. In the back of the tree, there is a box, to put some things: The amphibious vehicle is very nice! The proportions are really great (not too big, not too small) and there are a lot of details everywhere, like the propeller: A back view: An inside view: The small boat is a dark grey Zodiac, but the details are nice too, giving it a retro look, in the same way of all the Indy vehicles: The outpost has a net to permit to the bad guys to capture some nice guys and girls… But it seems that the girl Marion is scared of the nice croco! So Indy comes and help her pushing the Technic axle with this round inversed tiles, which push out the net and capture the croco. Now Marion feels happier! And she takes a can of oil and whacks the poor croco, without defences! Who has said Marion is a nice girl? So, I’ve bought this set like an add on to my city. In fact, the elements of this set can easily be integrated in a town layout. I plan to use the outpost for my forest section, and the amphibious vehicle is always a nice touch of originality in a layout. Yes you can use all those military things without creating an army in a layout: just put the violent parts out, and you’ve got nice things, like a biologist car in the case of the amphibious vehicle!	positive
Must.....have......	positive
My favorite part of this is prob the amphibious vehicle! Looks really neat! Nice to see another (different) torso for Marion...	positive

Thanks for this fantastic review, Alex! Those trees are a neat add on to any jungle, as is that sweet cave. But the main part of this set, the Jungle Cutter, man, that is wicked! Packed with that awesome dark green and with those wonderful treads, not to mention the smoothly spinning buzz saws. However, this set's a tad overpriced in my opinion, and looking through the instructions they have that crazy colour syndrome again, using blue, yellow and red parts in the internal build.

Thanks every much for the review! I remember having this set, and making really terrible stop-motion movies with it. Very playable. This brings back lot's of fond memories! Thanks! Majisto ON!	positive
Ah, the wonderful Dragon Knight (Or was it Dragon Masters?) sets. I personally preferred the Black Knights, but these guys still had some awesome sets! Thanks for this review, this looks like a neat little set, although those modern stairs look a little out of place. That tree design is indeed a neat one, I remember having that in one dark Forestmen set I got. The interior sure is roomy. May I suggest for future review you photograph the set on a cleared table, that way you won't get distracted by the clutter in the background and can focus on the main part of the image, the set. ~Peace	neutral
This is probably one of my favourite sets and/or one of the sets which I wish I owned..the 90's was probably my favourite castle era! tobad I was to young to buy this set when it came out Man I wish I had one of those dragons, they were one of the best type I reckon although all the dragon's are good thanks for the reveiw Edited by hollisbrick, 16 April 2008 - 07:41 AM.	positive
Yay, go Dragon Masters! I have to agree with iamded, I do like the Black Knights sets better for their design ( betrayal! ), however, the Dragon Knights are just awesome, 'cause they have dragons! This is a nice set, with some awesome minifigs and a nice overall design. I wish I had it... Go Masters!	positive
Great Classic Dragon Den! I love the old green dragons very much! There were my fave. I love these theme very much after the Black Knights era. This is a very very good set! I wished i can have this too.	positive
the wizard somehow "controls" the dragons i think, like, for example the wizard of the new castle line does with the undead skeletons. but i think it isn't sure that the dragon master's wizard is evil. as it is still unclear which factions of the older castle series are "good" or "bad".	neutral
phoinix, on 16 April 2008 - 09:06 PM, said: this was the last castle set i got before my dark age.. really liked it although the big rock parts looked really bad ( i am kind of used to them now) unfortunately i lost the little wand.. and i never understood who is "good" and who is "bad" does the wizard own the dragon? well they dont seem to be enemies but isnt the dragon supposed to be evil?? I always liked the BURPs, I don't know why. Maybe because they were dark grey and dark grey pieces seemed a bit hard to come by at the time. I always assumed that the dragon was, sort of, the mascot of the Dragon Masters. The wizard was there to keep him under control so he wouldn't turn on them. I always figured that the wizard was working with the Dragon Master King, and they were fighting against the Royal Knights (the dudes with the lion faces on their torsos), or whatever they were called. I like this set a lot. I think the castle theme declined after the Dragon Masters and Royal Knights themes were discontinued. The new knights never really took the cake. It's funny, but it seems, to me anyways, that when the Lego Minifigs lost their regular smile/smirk faces (whether they were masked by a beard or not), that's when Lego began to decline...a bit. The Dragon Masters had their vicious faces and all, but they still had that smile/smirk underneath their rough exteriors. The new knights look a little...less confident.	positive
I own this set and I think its a great for a smaller fortress building. There is a good selection of mini figs, the BURPS do detract somewhat from the set, but they do make it feel as if its in a large cave. The cloth flags that are included are really nice and mine have lasted a long time.	positive
I saw this set at my TRU for only $20.00. Now I might go get it! Thanks sinner for another nice review! Quote hoped to find a figure the right size for it, but none of mine would fit. Well, just sit your booty down and ride it wourself... ... Okay, well, maybe if you have a bionicle lying around or a halo figure.	neutral

I think it looks better... ...the problem is that it's too tight and it doesn't rotate as freely anymore. Adding another link makes it too loose!

I also believe the back gearwheel is somewhat oversized, it looks better with the smaller one you attached. Yes, it does seem to be a remake. The Shock Cycle even has a dangly chain like my modded version... As a set I'd prefer the old one due to the four indentical springs.	neutral
svelte_corps, on Apr 30 2008, 10:44 PM, said: And what everyone's been waiting for, the skullies - three of 'em and a conquistador skellie - very cute. Note the backs of the crystal head have a plume-sized hole - or maybe that's just where they injected the blue brain-plastic. Spooky! I love these skulls, I wasn't sold from the initial pics but they have a very creepy smile and the head shape is just... weird. With the large eyes, it's kind of Homer Simpson-esque. They reminded me more of the movie "Coneheads", but I think your description is more accurate. Looking forward to the rest of the review!	positive
The figs look great! The natives and the skeleton conquistador are my favorite figures in the set. The set itself is very good. The interior sort of reminds me of an older style lego set for some reason. It could be just me, but it has a classic feel. This will a great set to add to my list! Great review!

Thanks, svelte_corps. I was really hoping that the conquistador helmet would end up being silver in the final set, but I suppose it's good to know that the helmet is being porduced again anyway. And is the armour the skellie is wearing pearl gold? Thanks again, I look forward to the rest of the review EDIT: The dark tan baseplate is in fact very nice Although the fact that you have to put stickers on it is a real downer.

Looks great! I cant't wait until I can get my hands on this and the other new IJ sets. This is turning out to be a really good theme!

Thanks for the great review, svelte_corps. I've been wanting to see this set in detail since it debuted at the conventions. I have to say that, on the one hand, I agree that the minifigures, the crystal skulls, and the colors are great (I even like the waterfall), but, on the other, I kind of think that the set itself is a disappointment. It looks like they tried to accommodate design and playability needs, but really didn't come through on either. So, as you pointed out, the mid section doesn't really fit in with the other parts, and the trap sequence doesn't really flow, either. But, perhaps your right, and all will be answered in the film. I was surprised at just how empty the temple looked in the photo taken from above. They really should have gone the extra mile and made the temple look more like a temple, and not worry so much about the action features. Eh, but so it goes. But, I, too, am a sucker for tombs and temples, so I won't be able to pass it up. Archaeology on!	negative
Thanks svelte_corps for the great review, if it's out in Aussie then it should hopefully be reaching NZ soon. I can't wait! This looks like a great set, for me at least. I too am a great fan of spooky old temples, they are such fun. I love the look of the base plate, but the stickers don't look all that great. I wish they printed it like they always used too. I have to get this set. And the other ones too. Thanks again, you have brightened this sad day.	positive
I was going to review this on Monday but my camera ran out of batteries! Anyways, great review! As I have the set built, it's a really fantastic set. The waterfall is a reall cool sticker, and the flick fire missiles are quite interesting. Another point of interest: There are seven of the new flick fire missiles overall, if anyone cares.	positive
Nice big set ! Thanks for the review. The skellies seem to me as the only really big plus of the whole lot. I agree on the Homer Simpsons' paternity to them...	positive

svelte_corps, on May 1 2008, 02:44 AM, said: (e) Central turret thing This thing is kind of annoying and doesn't really sit or work well. It's kind of like a laser beam sending messages to space, I guess. As the central dome rises, the two plates peel away. I find it is a little bit tight to work smoothly and the two plates doesn't really sit well together at the top. Maybe I just need to rebuild it. I'm sure this will also be explained in the movie. Great review! Now I'm really truly convinced that I'm gonna buy this set. My faith was a little wobbly, but its benn restored Anyway, I just wanted to point out that the temple's entrance might actually be the turret thing. If you watch the teaser, there are some very similair stone pillars surrounded by sand (there are 4 not 2 though ) and when they close up it looks like all our characters are sucked into the sand and magically appear underground going through some stone plates(which act like steps to go down) that dissapear. So, in theory those steps beneath the turret are actualy the entrance, and I'm asumming from this picture That the steps with 1x8 bricks with the dragon heads at the end lead us of somewhere else. All in all this temple looks like a mixed up version of the real temple, which is fine by me (SIDENOTE: I'm not sure but based on minifig inclusion, either Lego was cheap or Colonel Dovchenko is dead by the time Irina and her goons reach the temple, I'll wait till I see the movie. ) Edited by Belloq, 02 May 2008 - 02:14 AM.	positive

I brought this set a few days ago and agree with everything you say. I would have never noticed that the boat sticker is the set number unless you pointed it out. Glad to see that one set of fuel can stickers was extra, i spent ages looking for a place to put them. cool review btw	neutral
A very nice review of a very lovely Indy set indeed, thanks wilhelm screamer. But you need for sure a better lighting for taking your pictures....	neutral
Nice review Wilhelm Screamer! Very thorough. The pictures are a little dark and blurry, though. I made a tutorial here for amateur photography tips. I also edited your first post to include a link to Alex's review. Great job!	neutral
An extremely thorough review - you definitely do this set justice. Looks like a fairly interesting set, and that comes from someone who isn't particularly a fan of lego Indiana Jones. Tom	positive
metalandi Thanks for this wonderful lovely review. I enjoyed myself very much when I am looking through at the lovely pictures. I must admit, this is what I called a "real classic" race prix I miss those cute sweet little race cars which is able to contain a mini-fig. Furthermore, this set offers 4 race cars and 13 mini-figures In addition, if town collectors remember, the car number tiles are printed instead of using stickers. This is the other set I owned, which holds the similarity above. 6381: Motor Speedway Overall, great review! simonwillems, on May 9 2008, 02:20 AM, said: I recently made an entire racetrack together with this set and to promote myself I will place a link HERE I saw your entire racetrack.

I can remember when I saw this set in LEGO catalogues, looking at it, dreamin to have it.... like so many other sets... And this one is still a dream... I really like the design of this set, it looks really complete, with some nice details. There are no lost place. The strairs withe the foot bridge add a lot to it IMO. Looking at the pics, I've got a question : is the "Rescue Rig" trailer one piece or is it brick build?	positive
WARNING! This reply may contain several minor movie spoilers. If you haven't yet seen the movie and want it to be a complete surprise, do not read. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: But it is Cruncher Block, his lady Driver Taejo that really shine. Look at those awesome suits! The cool faces! Taejo has a ripped shirt! I was originally skepitcal about the driver figure—I like the head, but I was trying to figure out why they put in a female minifig with no hairpiece. After having seen the movie, I now understand why; Cruncher's driver is a fairly manly looking woman, and most of the LEGO hairpeices would make the minifig look too girly for the character. :) Now that I know why Taejo's shirt is ripped up I don't mind the bits of fleshie color that are printed on it, but I do wish they would make some of the new torsos a little more head-colour agnostic...there's no real reason why Cruncher and his driver couldn't have had ties that came all the way up to their necks instead of having those little wedges of flesh showing through loose collars. Yeah, they are low-level mafioso type scum, but they aren't complete slobs. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Front view, the new windshields are fantastic: They are indeed very nice, it's the main reason I started looking at the Speed Racer sets in the first place. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: While a very cool car, it is rather silly of TLC to give us the exact same one we got in the smaller set. I didn't get the smaller set with this car, so I'm still happy, but it is a bad marketing move: I think the error they made was in the smaller set though. In the movie, the only time we see Cruncher's semi is when he's being chased by Racer X. Racer X and Taejo do end up on the same team for a cross country rally race (along with Speed of course), so I guess that's where they were going by putting those two together in the smaller set, but it would have been much more interesting for them to have made up a set with Taejo and one of the cars from the very goofy, comic book-gimmicky teams they are racing against. Especially since one of the teams (that is chasing Taejo specifically) is a bunch of Army-wannabee loonies—I'm sure more people would have loved some sort of dark/sand green racer with one of the IJ Soviets at the wheel than another Racer X. To summarize: Two Racer X's is bad, but it is the smaller set that should have been changed (imho). Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Annoyingly enough, this part opens up to shoot a pointless rubber projectile: Thus blowing the front part open and launching it.....well, not far really As much as I normally don't like the stupid techic launcher thing, and would rather not see it in a set ever again (although one of these days I will make a giant multi-launcer rig out of them just for fun), at least there is a reason for it to be in this set, as Cruncher's semi has a missile launcher in the front end of it in the movie. I think you're supposed to lift the panel that hides the missile before launching it, similar to the way that panels slide out of the way on the semi cab to allow for firing in the movie. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: And now for the most disappointing part - step three, the trailer: That's right, almost the entire thing is open, even the "filled in" side has holes! I'd certainly be cared to be back there, one bumpy hill and back you go I'm gonna chock this up to the standard LEGO philosophy of "playset" rather than "model" design for a lot of things. The semi rig and Raver X's car are the models, the trailer is the playset. Seeing as how the trailer is Cruncher's mobile office (rather finely appointed with lots of paintings and his pirahna "babies" in their tank behind his desk), and the intent seems more or less to have a playest bit in order for kids to re-enact the scene from the movie, I'm not going to give them too much grief over this. They tried to capture the basic bits of the movie set (which we see mostly from the inside during the movie) and translate it into a playset type environment. That being said, I do wish the back walls were more solid, as I see no reason for there to be gaps in the back wall when the front wall (or the "fourth wall" as the case may be here) is already conspicously absent. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: There are some pluses too though, like the ridiculously awesome minifig paintings I'll be using for Wayne Manor. Also note the "control" on Cruncher's desk that when turned, turns the gun at the bottom. It's an alright feature: Could have been a little better, but it's such a minor bit of this scene in the movie that I can see why they didn't spend too much time and effort on it. It would have been nice to have more paintings though, had the back wall been more complete (and I like your idea of how to use them :) ). Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: And though I'm not a massive fan of stickers, this is just too cool. The little aquarium is very simple but very clever, using a printed piece between two clear windows to create the illusion of a tank: Definately a feature which is not showcased nearly well enough on the box art. Since it is one of the major features of this set in the movie, it's nice to see it translate rather well into brick. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Design: 2/5 - Pretty poor considering the best part is available in a cheaper set, and only the front part of the truck looks cool, but still not truly awful. That may be a bit harsh (but not much) given what I've said further up this post, but it probably only deserves a 3 at best, so I'm not realy going to quibble the point. :) I still think that Racer X should be exclusive to this set and a different car should be in the smaller set with Taejo, which would have improved the cachet for this set overall. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Price: 2/5 - Overpriced easily, but Rogue Shadow is worse! True...this should have ideally been about a $30 set (especially given the general awesomeness of the IJ Race for the Stolen Treasure set), unless they made the trailer a bit more detailed (better back wall, perhaps some drop down gun ports like in the movie) or at put least one (or more) of Cruncher's goons in the set, then maybe I could agree more with the msrp. On that note: if I remember correctly from my visit to my local TRU yesterday in search of the new IJ sets (since local Targets seem determined not to get them in stock yet), they had this set on sale for around $35 along with an offer for a coupon good for $7.50 towards the purchase of a ticket to the movie with any Speed Racer toy purchase over $25. I may be wrong on the sale price, but I know the ticket offer was there. So, if you haven't seen the movie yet, and are interested in this set, TRU may be the place to go right now to get both at a slightly cheaper price. Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Fun: 4/5 - The mere concept of such an open truck kept me playing with this baby for hours! So you did enjoy the playest aspect of the trailer, even though you didn't care for the design...looks like they didn't do too badly then on what they wanted out of that bit. :) Batbrick, on May 10 2008, 06:05 AM, said: Overall I'm really glad I bought it as the minifigs are fantastic and the paintings and fish tank are cool. It's fun, stupid and downright ridiculous, but while not a great set by any means, certainly isn't as bad in the brick as it looks in photos. I was actually thinking about going and getting this set now that I've seen the movie and I understand what the heck is going on here more. Your review has definately added an additional impetus to that notion. My pocketbook (does not) thank you!	neutral
Good review. A must have for my batman collection. Are these sets already out in germany?	positive
Good review.I think the sets amazing!	positive
Nice review, brickbitz. I actually think this kit is really very nice for the size. True, you only get three figures, but it seems that's a norm in most batman sets. Besides, everything else is great. The tumbler looks like an amazing build - they really nailed this tank of a ride. And the Ice cream truck... Plus, this set does seem to have some neat pieces in it (trans green popsicles and lime hubcaps, anyone?). I think this far beats the rest of the batman lineup this year, which seems quite disapointing overall. Edited by Grevious, 16 May 2008 - 08:12 PM.	positive
Great review, as always! Although I know you don't take many pictures in your reviews(IMHO, ) but can we see a little more about the Tumbler? Is that little windshield down near the bottom front a third seat? What is in the framework of the back, behind the cockpit? I know there's a blunt shooter and flick fire missiles, but is it all framework?	neutral
A nice review of an interesting set, thanks brickbitz. A great new Batman, a funny ice cream truck and a pretty detailed Tumbler. And although I wish that vehicle would be just a bit smaller I almost wonder that it´s not even bigger, compared to TLC´s other Batvehicles.... And well, the interior could be better too....	positive
General Grievous Reviewed by Dunamis Set 10186 1,085 Pieces $89.95 from LEGO Shop @ Home Build time 3.5 hours It is the start of summer here in California and along with the weekly deluge of new action films we start to see some of the next wave of Star Wars LEGO sets. The latest offering from our favorite building toy company is none other than the infamous General Grievous! No doubt you all know the story of Grievous; two parts Technic and one part human and his hatred of the Jedi. Follow along as we get a close-up view of the mighty General. No doubt the observant will wonder why I purchased this set from Shop @ Home instead of my trusty LEGO store in Glendale. Well, it’s really as simple as two things: I’ve been traveling a lot and didn’t have time to drive to the store to get it AND gas is now $4/gallon and I would likely spend more in gas than the $9 shipping cost to get it to me. So there you have it. The Box: A gigantic box (much larger than expected) held the mighty General. We’re back to the perforated tabs on the side and two stickers on the front that let the box lift open: Inside, we have 17 bags, two manuals and three stickers on a relatively small sticker sheet. The Manuals: The manuals are not terribly thick in fact the second manual is noticeably thinner than the first. They come in at 75 and 31pages. Interesting to note on the back we see the next (and more interesting) wave of sets later this summer. Nothing new to report on the manuals as they provide the LEGO standard of high quality and features we expect. - Piece callouts - Models divided into sections - Large images - Page numbers Since there were links posted to the .pdf files of the instructions online, I’m sure you can all get an idea of the manual and the parts inventory. However, for those of you without access to the Internet here are photos of the parts inventory pages: Random manual image: Features page: The Pieces: The short answer is you get lots and lots of little pieces in white, gray and black plus some big pieces in white, gray and black. Mixed in the set is a fair amount of oddball pieces like minifig tools, Jedi hood and trans yellow dome. Fear not, despite the eclectic collection of parts, it all comes together in the end (not unlike a typical day at work for me…) It is probably worth noting again that there is a heavy amount of Technic parts and pieces here. The Build: The build starts off with a rather in-depth build of the stand in which General Grievous stands on. Once you think you are done, you keep adding on to this (rather solid) base. I bet there are 250 pieces just in the base alone! It is quite nice when you get done with it though and really adds to the display. I’m glad LEGO didn’t skimp on the base as it completes the model. Once you get through all that, the rest of the build is a real thumb-bruiser. Anyone who has built a decent size Technic set knows the feeling of your thumbs being sore when you are done. You get the same effect here. It is actually a fun build and I really liked seeing how the designers used all the various pieces to recreate a fairly accurate model of Grievous. The model is built from the ground up as seen in a few of the progress shots: Here is what is left over: The Design: The design is quite good and is very accurate. Some might be disappointed that since this is a Technic set we don’t have more articulation in the shoulders and have the ability to separate two arms into four as seen in the movie. However, it would seem the real intent is for display and not functionality. Here is a shot of the torso and the detail involved: Here are Grievous’ organs: Careful observers will note that my model is lacking two “arrow” stickers from the two white chest pieces. I failed to see these on the sticker sheet and only grabbed the large Grievous sticker. So, note that there are actually THREE stickers and not ONE. Chest protector and respirator: Head and arms: I was a little disappointed that we got two yellow blades and no green blades on the lightsabers. Note how all the lightsabers have different hilts which is a nice touch: Here are some shots of the completed model with a few other sets shown for scale. He is actually pretty tall: You have the option to remove the top two arms and put in shoulder plates if you so desire: Detail on the back: Overall Thoughts: I’ve been saying for a few years that we should have a Technic Grievous set and we finally got one. Designed more as a model and not a fully functional swooshable figure, Grievous is a tad flimsy. You won’t want him to veer too far off his massive and sturdy base. It would have been nice to have is cape with him (like the Technic Vader set). I do like the size of the model and it is impressive to look at. LEGO Star Wars System fans will likely want to think twice before purchasing but Technic and UCS fans should be satisfied. Final Rating: 75% Build 8/10 (Very Good – Fun, relatively quick build. Technic fans will be more pleased than others.) Design 8/10 (Very Good – Some nice SNOT and Technic techniques. A bit flimsy but the base is kind of cool.) Parts 7/10 (A mixed bag of stuff. Probably can’t get too many diverse builds from this except for other robot type models.) Price 7/10 (Just OK – A bit stiff at $90 USD for a nice display model with limited functionality.) As always, let’s hear your thoughts and feedback.	positive

Great review, very detailed indeed!	neutral
Thanks for the great review! Sad to say, as cool as he looks, he's a sale-only set for me.	neutral
Thanks for the sweet review, brickbitz! That really is a neat little set, that walker is fantastic, most likely the best part of the set. Though the alien craft does also look neat, and it's cool how it can fold down into aa walker. Or rather, a sentry turret, seeing as it can't really move while in that mode. Still, it's nice. My favourite part is the mini mining robot though. So cute! ~Peace	positive
Thanks for the review!! That makes me wanting this set even more!!	neutral
Thanks for the review nice little set and its around $20.00!	positive
Hi y'all! Guess what happened today? When walked into my Toys 'R' Us in Fullerton, CA, just to buy a simple Tiny Turbo racer, what do I see? All the Agents sets sitting on the shelf, ready for the taking! I didn't have too much money with me, so I just got 2 of 8631 Mission 1: Jetpack Pursuit! It's a really cool little set, so I thought I'd review this puppy for you! I shall proceed in the order of the instructions. So, let's get started! The Minifigs Let's begin with the minifigs, Saw Fist and Agent Chase! They are really cool, some of the coolest minifigs I have seen in a while! I took off Saw Fist's wig & chainsaw so you can see his head and cybernetic arm better! Here is a back view of Saw Fist, and - SURPRISE! Agent Chase has a double sided head! One side with his cool "mission face" with sunglasses and headset, and one with his casual Bruce Wayne type face (note, though, that it is not really the Bruce Wayne face). His wig, btw, is Mutt's hairpiece in black! Very neat! Poor Saw Fist seems to be forced to always drag his chainsaw around for it is way too long to just hang down from his shoulder like a normal arm. The Snowmobile Next up, we have the snowmobile, a sleek little vehicle with only minor design flaws! The container with the jewel is attached to the vehicle by a single stud, so it doesn't fall off, but is easy to pick up! In the pic below you can see the only two tiny design flaws: Thanks to the exhaust pipes, the laser cannon (or whatever it's supposed to be) can't be lowered any further than this. Also, the corners of that slope-ish piece that the handle bar rests on are sticking out a little at the sides. Other than that, it's pretty well done! The Jetpack Finally, there is the Jetpack! IMO, a name like Autogyro-pack or something would make more sense, but whatever. Although a little bulky, the Jetpack is very well designed! The rotor can be tilted back, and at the lower back of the Jetpack, there is hook with which you can grab the container with the jewel from the snowmobile. What I like best about the Jetpack is that although it is attached to the minifig in kinda the same way as that of the Riddler, this one doesn't rotate around. So, the Agent is being held in place steadily! "See ya later, chainsaw-cyborg-dude!" Stickers This set comes with a surprisingly large sticker sheet. The reason is that half of it are extra stickers! There are two large Agents logos and one Inferno logo - perfect for Agents MOCs! There are also a star and a small, round sticker portraying the number of the mission. The star seems to be part of some kind of game where you collect the stars from all sets on an Agents ID that you get from the Mission 5 set. I don't know, though, if you get any gain from this except for becoming a full-status Lego Agent! Below, you can find the list of parts from this set! Click here for a better quality pic! That's pretty much it! I hope you liked this review and will run straight to your next toy store to get one or more of this set! This was my very first set review! So any questions, comments, or requests? Any more pics you want me to take? Would you like me to exchange the chainsaw with something else, or do you want me to try the Agent's new hairpiece out on another fig? If so, just tell me! See ya!

That's a great review for your first one. I think the jet pack if far to bulky it could do with some minimising but that’s life. I assume that you can’t fit a standard hand in the chainsaw arms are the hole would be to large but would you be so good as to confirm this for me? Overall I quite like the jet ski and the ability to lower the arms to much doesn’t both me. How much was it just so I can get an idea of the price? Finally thanks for posting this review so quickly.	neutral
This is MUCH MUCH MUCH more promising than the 2008 Batman set for $10.00. The vehicle looks like someone took time to design it, but the Batman one looks like . Lego dear Lego, where is the quality for Batman??!?! I really like the new cyborg arm, and the propellers on that thing : ), it is a really promising line although I would get rid of all those bionicle pieces.	positive
Thanks, guys! I really tried to make it a good first review! Now to answer your questions: The robot arm can fit EF robot claws and anything that a minifig can hold in his hand or that would fit into a 1x1x1 cylinder, so normal minifig hands are too small to fit. TLG is using the robot claw idea for the main villain of the Agents line! Do you still want me to try it out and take pics? The price was 10.99 USD at the TRU I bought it at. I bet it'ss be a dollar less on S@H! And I'm sorry, but I probably won't get any more sets any time soon. I have to save my money for all the other good set that are to come. But if I would get another set, it would just be the one with the helicopter and the all-silver car! If anyone gets this set, can he/she PLEASE review it? Thanks! Any other questions I can answer for you guys? Edited by Oky Wan Kenobi, 18 May 2008 - 08:59 AM.	neutral
Thanks for a very good review! Agent line seems better all the time... Looking forward in seeing review on Mission 2 Gold Chase (and new pictures of the jet) really soon!	neutral

Thank you for the nice review. It has some big pieces I don't like, but the minifigs are good.	positive
Mmm this set looks amazing. lovely pieces. And I actually like the minifig faces. That Jaw helmet is cool aswel . Are those stickers on the crocodile heads or is it printed?	positive
Not many words this time, but as they say: a picture is worth a thousand words - and your pictures are lovely! Once again, Agents is turning out to be a cooler and cooler theme with each new review. This set looks like an awesome parts pack, and I love the bike! BTW, anyone else notice the possibly accidental reference to Alpha Team? Agent Charge is back, it looks! Edited by Grevious, 21 May 2008 - 09:05 PM.	positive
Wow, great review for a really great looking set. The pieces, like the minifigs and crocs are very nice, but that map is reeaally cool for an Aztec/Maya/Inca fan (like me)! I will definately buy this set when it is available in England. Grevious, on May 21 2008, 10:04 PM, said: BTW, anyone else notice the possibly accidental reference to Alpha Team? Agent Charge is back, it looks! Yeah, I thought that. Then I thought, "nah, he looks different", but I remember that the characters in Alpha Team did change their looks a lot throughout the years (being spies and that).

A really cool playset, thanks for these great pics, SirNadroj! A silver jaw helm, cycrocs, some cool faces and a very swooshable bike.... see you later, alligator! The only thing I don´t get entirely´re these neat barbwire circles. What´s the purpose with these.... life rings for masochists? Well.... that makes me look at that tower in a completely new way too.... baddie´s baywatch on! But where´re the girls?	positive
Have you made any other reviews? I want more. Please? I'm not planning to get this set, but its pretty cute. The set itself is okay, but the figs are amazing. Agent Charge: I want that head. Unibrow man! Great villain! Crocs...	positive
Like all the others, (except the truck) this set is great. Love the figs and the green crocidiles.	positive

AgentRick57, on May 23 2008, 09:17 AM, said: Why do all of the reviews that we have for Agents sets have the agents getting hurt? Is this a new trend? No, it's an old trend. And it's because villains are cooler. Actually, it could be long-simmering resentment towards the not-highly-regarded Alpha Team/ Dino Attack sets bubbling forth. See Dr Lucky's hilarious post here for an example of what I mean... I'm sure the new agents will learn to fight back soon	negative

I've copied another thing because i don't know how i must do a review. And i can't do long reviews! Set ref: 7884 Name: The Buggy: The Escape of Mr Freeze Number of minifigs: 2 Number of pieces: 76 Price: 13,95€ Front of the box: Back of the box: The comic: Very close: What's in the box: Without: The set: The set with the box: The time: Wow, this is a funny set, but it's a little expensive, and a little to small, but i like some pieces like the fire, and the mr freeze gun. And the best of all, here it comes, NO STICKERS! That's one of the greatest things. But i understand why lego has made this set, some people want batman lego, and they are most of the time expensive, and the mr freeze set is also expensive, but this set not. If you want more pics, you msut ask! For exaple for the minifigs, or the mr freeze and the blaster. Ask it, and this is my first review and sorry for the great and blurry pics!

Grevious, on May 23 2008, 09:54 AM, said: Indead. The only reason to get this set is if you couldn't afford the Batcave back in 2006 and want a Mr. Freeze fig for a cheap price. And anyone who did get that kit really have no reason whatsoever to get this. I'll get it, I admit the vehicles are extremely poorly designed, I mean REALLY poorly designed, but the Mr.Freeze fig is fantastic, and I would buy two of this set just for him, as his head and gear are very useful for mocing. It also comes with some nice pieces, like the grappling hook, little wheels, exhaust pieces and such. Still, a pretty bad set build wise, but it has atleast inspired me to make my own Batbuggy Thanks for the review theriddler, appreciated. Batbrick Away!	positive
As others have said, this really is a set for those that didn't buy the Batcave. Thus I want it! The cars are pretty horrid though... Thanks for the review ???theriddler???!	neutral
Thanks for the review! For such a high price that we need to fork out, compared to a total pieces of 76. It's is very expensive to pay for such poor design. But then, I will still considered to get them. As what Sinner had said, this is a very good way to get Mr Freeze without getting the Batcave. And it so happened that, I do not have the Batcave too. I believed that is the cheapest set among the four. So, for the mini-figs ONLY, this set is recommended. Other than that, I am sorry.	neutral
WOWIE!!!!!! I'm glad you like it! Maby i'l do the tumbler also! But soon the batcycle and the scuba also come!	neutral
Thanks for the reveiw The figs are bloody great! but those cars are a bit... well I'll put it blantly, RETARDED!!! Although they shall be good after some modding! and whats with that grapple hook? does it even have a rope, so I guess Batman will hokk it to Mr freeze so his ride looks more ugle anyway, can you pleese take some pics of the figs	neutral
That's a great set. It'd be even better if it were sold as two separate little cars. They remind me of the dozens of little LEGO cart vehicles I got as a kid. Those were always fun, quick builds that resulted in lots of cool play. I think this set is aimed more at kids and, in that respect, it's a pure winner. It doesn't hurt that you can get Freeze and the newly designed Batman both in this set for a reasonable price.	positive
Thank you, The Riddler! ) For this highly informative review. Despite the fact that I still consider it to be one of the weakest sets in all Batman Line, I guess that now I may even get more than one of these for the same reasons as Batbrick. ) Good day, gentlemen! )	neutral

The Brick Rat, on May 23 2008, 10:31 PM, said: 1)My set came with defective instructions. In 2 places pages are missing and duplicates of other pages repeated. For instance, the car instructions are missing steps 16-21. Fortunately, I was able to make out what pieces went where in the missing steps by studying the illustration in step 22. I hope you have better luck with your instructions. Everything was just fine with my directions. Sounds like you just ran into some bad luck there, my friend. Quote 2)This set contains the best LEGO sound brick ever (it's just begging to be incorporated into my Arkham Asylum). I agree 100%. And I didn't even see it had a sound brick until I read this last night. Usually LEGO promotes stuff like that pretty loudly on the packaging. Not here though.	neutral
Thanks for the awesome review, Deinonychus! This really is a sweet set, a bit expensive a set for me, as I only get the cheaper non-Castle sets, which is a shame because I love that head! It would be great for some more cyborg troops. The car is awesome, I didn't expect it to have that many silver parts, that's fantastic! Heaps of play features too, that ejector seat mechanism sounds interesting. Thanks again for the sweet review! ~Peace	positive
Thanks Deinonychus for another great review. I must say I do look forward to people uploading reviews of new sets, it really helps me decide if I want it or not. If it's a good set (IMO) then it adds to the excitement of picking up one myself! This, I must say, is one of those sets! The only concern for me, like alot of others, is the price. I will just have to wait and see and continue to look at these photo's Deinonychus has provided for us!! So much for thinking the Agent line was going to be weak! I wonder if the ExoForce style code brick number plate is a hint from TLC as to what will replace ExoForce at the end of this year? JB	positive
Looking closely at the red cones on the missles, and grey cones on the car's rear These appear to be a new piece. Note how there is a slight stopper ridge at the base of their top stud. Interestingly, the trans green cones on the helicopter seem to be of the older mould style.	neutral

Yes, the price for the battlepacks is a little steep. However for the amount of mini-figs and castle accessories, the price and quantity justifiy my bulk purchase. This is one way to acquired soldiers without spending much money on other sets. In this way, you will save much more. I understand the concern of Star Wars Battlepacks from your country.

No offence- make this 7.99 CAN. Too expensive to be coming with only a few figures. 20$ earns you the same amount of figs, plus a catapult, barricade, two horses and a jousting divider.	negative

Too expensive to be coming with only a few figures. 20$ earns you the same amount of figs, plus a catapult, barricade, two horses and a jousting divider. Are you refering to these following sets? Both these sets adds up to $18.00 (CAD) And the skeleton pack have the same price of $18.00 (CAD) *prices quoted from S@H I understand that 7009 and 7090 offers more pieces, horses and same amount of mini-figs compared to a typical battlepack. IMO, I feel that all 3 sets are all army building sets. 7009 offer small catapult, 3 mini-figs, a skeleton white horse. 7090 offer a joust divider, weapon rack (good accessories), 2 mini-figs, a horse with barding and a skeleton black horse. These sets have different purpose. For me, buying multiples of 7009 is to build its catapult, white skeleton calvaries. While 7090 is to build on Crown calvaries and Black skeleton calvaries. However, Battlepacks have a different agenda. It offered some castle accessories that is not available commonly. For a Castle army builder like myself, castle accessories are always in demand. The black robe, silver armor, silver short-axe are not very common castle accessories. It can be used as a good stock up too. I am not saying this battlepack is an one way solution to solve everything. That's why, different sets are released to target on different purposes.	neutral
WhiteFang, although I realize that the battle packs are great specifically for building armies, and castle accessories (which is why its such a shame that I won't be able to buy these things ), while sdpirate's sets are more for a catapult, Calvary whatever. The fact to the matter is with the battle pack you get: 5 minifigs with lots of accessories. While with the sets that sdpirate showed us you get: 5 minifigs with an okay amount of accessories 3 horses (including two skeleton ones) A ballista A weapons rack, and a jousting barricade. You cannot say that the battle pack contains the same amount of stuff that the other two sets have and therefore should be priced the same. It just seems that Lego is ripping off Canadian army builders, to me if the battle pack contained a small catapult, or wall so that it contained about the same amount of stuff that the other sets had it would be fair. It seems stupid that you will only get minifigs from one set, while you can get about the same amount of minifigs plus a bunch of other stuff from two other equally priced sets. That’s why to me these battle packs are a rip off, because of what they contain, IMHO the Battle Packs seem to be only worth about 10 dollars.	neutral
Sorry to be going a little off topic here but personally i have just bought 40 crowny battle packs for the only reason that i am running out of space to store the left over blocks. About 500 of my crownies came from sets (mentioned above) on sale which would have been cheaper than the battle packs. Thanks for the review Whitefang but i dont think i will be buy any skeleton battle packs, that army is large enough.	neutral

Athos, on May 28 2008, 07:47 PM, said: The printed pieces are the real gems of this set. Beyond them, there isn't much to this set, though the boat hull is nice. The model itself, isn't all that great. The new Akator temple is definately a superior model (at least in piece count), but those printed pieces are hard to resist. Steve I have to agree. Too few pieces for such a high price- but amazing figs too, and a nice baseplate! Despite a 4+ palm tree, you get more palm tree leaves for MOC's. Plus, I think a monkey? And that sweet Achu figure.	negative
I just rebuilt this entire set today, and the nostalgia was totally worth taking bits and pieces from a few of my own MOCs. Only now did I realize how rare some of those pieces are, and I'm rather thankful that I have all of the printed pieces, and Achu. The only pieces I am missing is a transparent orange headlight (3 out of 4), black minifigure hammer, light gray chain(replaced it with a dark gray chain), and ONE WHOLE minifigure, which is the mechanic guy. I still have both the instructions and the box, and both are in appalling conditions. Kudos to the pre-2000s lego sets like this one! Love 'em	positive

Welcome to Cardinal Brick's Review of 7736 It's a small set but as I bought it the other day I felt that it probably did merit a short review. The box is ofcourse far larger than necessary! There's plenty of air inside. The contence is one bag and the instruction booklet, you could proably build it inside the bag if the desire took you. We have one new coastguard with the slightly stubly head found in the castle range and a trans-clear visor. The build was challanging and arduious The final product is quite nice at one ?3.00 it's a good set only 50p more than an impulse set and with enough extra parts to justify the increase in the price. A good set for a little gift or so on, the buggy moves well. There's not that much to say really for I can't really think of additional models to build with the parts but then what do you expect for the price.

Great Review of a great set. I always figured the hoses were welding torches (attached to jetpacks, yeah!) as the whole thing had the vibe of a mobile repair center. Much like many of my favorite sets, this one has a base of simple bricks and plates and then from that solid foundation the rest is built out to be decorative or have the action features. This gives sets a very solid feel as demonstrated in this set, the first Snowspeeder, and Galaxy Explorer. The MM Armored Drilling Unit has a more technic base giving it a less solid appearance and though I like the set, that jet that luanches from the back is horrible, partially because of the useless orange containment things. The Mega Core has a nifty crane instead of a big useless jet. -Tohst	positive
Thanks for those wonderful pictures and congrats! I think buying this on eBay was a good decision! I have no M:Tron sets at all, but I like the MCM very much. It's just a wonderfully big set with many nice detials. Lots of playing possibilities! I wish I had it too.	positive

Also the MCM has a better design, in my view, as the wheels are closer together, making it look a lot more tankish than the MT-101. Also space in the rear isn't wasted on having a shuttle.

I really enjoyed the nostalgia review of the M-Tron Mega Core Magnetizer. This was the first wave of space lego i didnt get when i was a kid, though i remember looking at this set in the shops. I stopped with blacktron1 and space police. I look forward to more reviews once your ebay stuff arrives Cheers ISC	positive
Thanks for that fine review of a really classic and impressive M:Tron set, Inertia! Tohst, on May 28 2008, 04:55 PM, said: The MM Armored Drilling Unit has a more technic base giving it a less solid appearance (...) Yeah.... it´s pretty sad, some of these new sets just look very cool at the outside, but appear to be hollow and blank at the inside, especially with the annoying use of studless technic beams. To MOD these sets often means to change the whole inner frame, leaving us with a bunch of IMHO not really very useful parts. It´s not a very honorable marketing strategy to produce set designs that´re aimed to look impressive and cool on the box art, but´re pretty useless in their inner structures. Of course I don´t want to offend some Technic lovers, and although I always was more the System kind of guy, why can´t they just use some technic beams with studs at least? I grew up with 'just imagine', with pictures of alternative models on the box, and I don´t think it´s that easy, especially for younger kids, to MOD some of these terrific blown-up sets like it once was with sets like this one here.... Implosion off!	positive
Sinner, on May 30 2008, 01:38 AM, said: That's because of cost. (...) I've never heard an official word (...perhaps I should raise a topic...) but I think that they don't show them any more because it became a support nightmare. What do I mean? I bet TLG was tired of letters and calls saying "Timmy can't make this model shown on the box. Can you send instructions and the extra parts..." Of course it´s a money issue.... my question was more rhetorical. But I still don´t like how they sacrifice inherent set design on the altar of cost saving efforts. To be even more correct, I don´t understand why they try to make extraordinary cool looking sets with a pretty weak 'inner life'. Yeah, they want to sell sets with something that looks exciting on the box art, but.... LEGO was (and fortunately, is, with many recent sets too) always more than just an impressive spaceship or S.F. tank vehicle.... it´s the sum of the set itself and its parts and what you can do with it that makes out the full fun of it. The best thing you can do with a new set, beside some UCS sets perhaps, is to MOD the set according to your own likings. This is where 'just imagine' begins, and how kids start to learn how to MOC, at least it was like that to me.... Individualizing official sets, and looking on some cool alternative models gave me my first ideas and helped my imagination and skills to grow, back in these days when I was a wee child. Books, movies and t.v. series as a source of inspiration just came a little later.... I can see many people complaining about how to make the alternative models, yes, but just stop using them on the box art´s a very poor solution and a dangerous one too, at least in long terms. Of course I know that you know all these things too, Sinner. I just think it´s a shame, and a risk too, because TLC´s perhaps sacrificing more than they might know by yet.... Building with bricks is the main attraction of LEGO, not just some cool crafts to play around with.... others can do this too and maybe better than TLC. If the kids of today ever forget about the fascination of being imaginative, TLC´ll only lose in the end.	neutral

Grevious, on May 30 2008, 05:03 AM, said: *gasp* Are you kidding me? Honestly, I hate this set. The batbike looks far too blocky, and that Hammer Truck looks super shoddy and thrown together. The only real reason I'd get it at all would be for the Harely Quinn figure - but I'd probably just get her separately on Bricklink. Besides, the Tumbler and Robin's Jetski sets look far better to me. They actually seem to have great vehicle designs. No new villian figures, I know, but still some great old ones. Er, wait a minute... oh yeah, hope your review gives the real scoop on this kit, Deino. The batbike may look blocky, but the Hammer Truck is by no means thrown together. Read the instructions, it actually has a great assembly. Add into the fact it has Harley, great wheels, a modable Batbike, awesome stickers and awesome pieces and I'd say this was a win. The Penguin is a bit of a repeat and the Tumbler is too big for me. Either way, it's a great set, Batman 08 wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be, which is great. Batbrick Away!	positive

A very nice review, thanks Deinonychus. That Batcycle looks pretty neat.... like a Hells Bats Angels version of that tumbler, a really nifty idea. The truck looks simply sweet, a smooth design and, this time, TLC´s new habit of vehicle oversizing just works very fine. A wonderful and very comical vehicle indeed! And Harley.... oh my, this bill I´ll have to pay for myself.... Clonecommando007, on May 30 2008, 02:22 PM, said: Truck: Flick fire missiles!!?!?? Lego have you no sanity! Sure they're great but you're putting them on every single action set!! Yeah.... this starts to become a little annoying.

Brickadier General, on May 29 2008, 07:27 PM, said: Hi all, so I was at "The Wal-Mart" yesterday and had the munchies and was looking for something to eat. Somewhere along the line, I stopped caring about food and decided to browse the toy department to see what they had Lego-wise. Thank you very much for that neat review, Brickadier General .... I´m glad that you changed your mind, a review of a burger wouldn´t be half that interesting for sure. It´s just a mediocre set to me, but of course it´s always cool to get important MFs in less pricy sets. I like the Penguin´s sub from the Batcave more, just because they did a fine job on resembling a penguin without using a sticker.... Robins craft looks fairly nice, but the most useful parts of the whole set, for me personally, would be those indeed very neat green engines.	positive
Yay, another Technic shooter!! Whew, I need a spare one in case the 14,348 other ones that I have all happen to break. Seriously, do Lego set designers get some sort of bonus for incorporating catapults, Technic shooters, and / or flick-fire missiles??? Anyway, thanks for the review. Looks like a cute set.	positive
Thanks for the great review, Brickadier General! The sub looks very nice, and I like the idea of a raising periscope (did the Batcave sub have that feature?) and the details on the sub look very nice. The inclusion of The Penguin, Robin and two of those great brick-built penguins really confirms that I'll be getting this, considering that I didn't purchase the Batcave. However, I am rather dissapointed that this set is so similar to the vehicles of Penguin and Robinin repectively in the Batcave set. I feel that it only really caters to those who havn't bought the set, and I would've much appreciated different vehicles. Overall, a very nice set, perhaps the best of the 2008 wave, despite it's lack of originality. Thank you very much for the review BG	positive
I see you've also learnt to call dibs. Looking forward to seeing your review!! EDIT: Oh, I see! I just arrived early. A truely fantastic review, you make me not want to pass this set up, even though I can't possibly afford it without leaving my beloved Castle collecting.

You know I like many had doubt's about these sets when they were first mentioned, but I've decided I want the whole line now! This set is the créme de la créme. Just beautifully stunning! That is a great review svelte_corps, you have gone into fantastic detail and description of all the elements. Really it is this review that has persuaded me to buy this set. I blame you! The minifigs are great, the vehicles are better, and the truck and interior is awesome! The few minor draw backs are far outweighed by the attention to detail and the many unique and cool elements used in this set. And printed pieces! That is even better! Great job, you have obviously put a tremendous effort in making this review, and I for one definitely appreciate it! I am looking forward to these sets being available in New Zealand!	positive
MUST. GET. TWO Thanks so much, this review has truly shown this set as a brilliant one. Even those who hate this theme must admit it is greatly designed. I love the way the mini vehicles fit. I love the light brick. I love the truck front. I love the trailer. I love the missions bay. I love holding cell. I love everything!

Wow. Like others have said i was unsure about these when i first heard about them but then looked at the first leaked pics and thought they actually look pretty neat. now i have seen all the reviews i have to have all these sets. at first i was thinking they would be great as parts packs but the more reviews i see the less i want to use them as part packs and just keep them as built (or buy 2 so i can do both !!) Can't wait till they hit the shelves in the UK...... Thanks for the review	positive
svelte_corps, a fanastic review of this biggest Agents' set. At first, I was not very keen to have this set. However, after reading your review, you have make me swing up and down. Its simply fabulous! Thanks for your hard work. I am sure it's not easy to do this review. I love that female mini-fig. She looks awfully sweet especially with her new hair. Great job!	positive
OMG! Thank you, thank you, thank you! You made my day! So that means Dr. Inferno's hair isnt rubber! But one question, is it like that weird funny soft plastic like the ants from Indy 4? PLEASE ANSWER	positive
Great Review, thanks! That's one hell of a set. I think LEGO has reached a certain kind of peak with the design, cleverness, and fun of this one. I'm so relieved that Agents seems to be shaping up to be even better then I thought it was going to be...and I thought it was going to be cool to begin with. Agent "Charge"? Not only does he look like Dash Justice, but he has the name of one of Dash's Alpha Team squadmates? I call shenanigans!	positive
Woah, I got to have this set! I shall buy it ASAP! Thanks for the review! Expertly done.	positive
Splendid review! I love everything on this set. No question 'bout it. Somehow I knew I should have saved up and buy that when come to TRU...but the sight of Turbocar Chase and Jetpack Pursuit was to tempting to pass up.	positive

Great review. I just got 7644 MX-81 Hypersonic Operations Aircraft. It's a great ship. I started to review it, but then it started to rain (I was outside), so the review is coming tommorow. Technicolor stickers! Very pretty!	positive
You really are an awesome set reviewer, svelte_corps!! Thanks very much for this sweet review, so in-depth and detailed, that is one sweet vehicle! It's got three of my favourite things, treads, orange, and big slicey blades! Thanks again! ~Peace	positive
These new sets are just totally off-the-wall radical :D. It's the little details like the scoops on the blades and the alternate alien energy source (Lego didn't even have to include those, but they did!) that show Lego are really getting back into their groove this year. The ability to add power functions is just so cool as well, I'm going to pick-up the Creator Monster Dino set for the electronics when the sales hit as svelte has suggested. A very entertaining review, just like the Agents mobile command center one :D	positive
This set looks 10 times sweeter with the power functions, too bad I'll have to buy some extra.	negative
Wow, this thing is very cool. Definately no lack of details, and is quite cheap for the bang of the set that you get. For some reason I really love the bay in the back of the detachable ship. Quite an improvement from last years line. Thank you for the review.	positive
I was going to buy this set anyway, but now I'm even more excited. :D My favorite part of this set is the bay that holds the little cart vehicles.	positive

Well, title says it. The description, you'll understand later. I ordered this off of S@H last tuesday, and oddly enough, it's listed on S@H as MX-81 Hypersonic Airplane... I'd like to apologize for the random, horrible, faded pics. I took the review outside, and the clouds kept shifting, changing the lighting, and then I had to go inside because it started raining. It's been raining for a week. It's raining now, as I type this. So, I foolishly went outside to take pics. The front of the box. Not bad, as far as boxes go. It features a lift-up tab... ...which shows the various functions. Back of the box. Still not much to say... Two manuals. I think this is just right- Not too thick, but not too many manuals, either... Oddly enough, the box came with a little folded up piece of paper telling us not to mix the bags. It comes sorted into 4 bags, by the way. Minifigures The set features 3 normal MM figs, 1 normal jellie, and one of the new commanders. I really like this guy. He has a few issues, like his hands being stuck sideways, and still being hollow, but still a great improvement. He'll make a lovely addition to any Halloween MOC. Stickers The set comes with a fairly big DSS for the Spacecraft. Pretty normal, but I do like the dragon sticker. Then, suprises of suprises, a technicolor sticker sheet for the aliens! How cool is this, huh? The tops of the actual stickers are shiny, which is hard to see in the pic. Even the bottom is shiny! Who said stickers can't be cool? The mining craft The little guy is pretty cute, and well built. My only gripe is that there's nowhere to spin the drill! It seems so lifeless without a feature... The alien craft You'd think a Commander would be important enough to have a seatbelt, rather than be stabbed with a clip and stuck on the ship like those other grunt aliens... I think this thing has some potential. Shiny stickers, different body shape. And when you look at those engines, this thing could be an alien Corvette! But then you look at the back. Pretty bare, no flares or anything. It's a cool little craft, but it just...lacks. The modules These things have some potential, as well. With some modding, they could be pretty cool. Unfortunetly, it's pretty boxy, there are no engines, and the wings are too small. The top is pretty nice, though. The greebles are all right. The controls, as usual, are a sticker. Pretty spacious, mind you. The cockpit doesn't stay flush with the body, though. The front plate underneath it can be easily replaced with a brick to fix that. ...I'm not gonna comment on this. The main body Too bad. The 'labratory' isn't much of a lab. A trans-red panel and some tray thing are all that compose the 'lab'. I was expecting more, but true to form, this Mars Mission set has no impressive interior to speak of. There is a lot of space, though, so it shouldn't be hard to mod. Phew! The lab folds up like so. Pretty simple, and would allow access to the lab, if there was one. And then we have this thing. What is it? Defense laser? Communications array? Satellite T.V.? The modules connect like so (sorry, out of place...): Too bad the pins stick out... Various pics... As you can see, this thing has more of those bars than an AT&T commercial... (There, you understand the topic description now? ) The rear. It uses a white City plane wing for the...wings. When I first saw the prototype pics, I thought they slanted downwards... That would've been really cool. Ah, now to the platform. From the position of the drill, I think this could be a really cool turret location when I MOD it to more military space. Back to the bars. If we had space monkeys, they'd love this. This set has more bars than a jungle gym.( ) Here we see the button that drops the platform. Pretty clever, and it's not in the way. Best of all, it really works! Really well, actually. Good job, TLC. 2 more bars and a shooter mechanism. Jeeze, this is really setting itself up for a joke. A shooter mechanism walks into a bar... Never mind! Here we have the handle that allows you to pick it up safely. A good idea, but it's placed waaaay to far back, way off the center of balance. You have to hold on to it pretty well to keep it angled up, though it does stop your hands from getting in the way of the platform. Ah! The platform in action. This is really a neat little feature. Not only can the ship land in a reduced footprint, but it also prevents the nice white paint job from getting red dust all over it... It's centered pretty well, too, and you don't have to worry about knocking it over, just don't shove it back at all. Here we have the latch. When the button on top is pushed, this gets pulled inward... ...Which pulls out of this hole and allows it to swing neatly down. Good luck, and happy mining!! Again, sorry for the lack of in-progress review. I would've liked to take pics of the mechanism and so on, but typical of the MM sets, you can't really take it apart. Well, this is really a nice set, which can hopefully be upgraded with a better lab with little difficulty. Some of my military mod plans include: -Strip the lab and install a command center -get rid of lots of bars. The thing has more bars than Alcatraz. -Install some turrets. This is a big command ship, so why all the forward-facing weapons? It'll need some AA defense... -mod the landing platform to be a troop dropper with installable AA turret. -mod the cockpit pods to be more aerodymic. So, that's all folks. Shall I include one last "bar" joke?	neutral
I appreciate your review Mr. Mandalorian, but why the negativity?. I'd try to find more positives about the set instead of kinda criticizing it after each picture. I personally think it looks freakin' awesome!. The size is very impresive and I nearly fell of my chair when I saw the first pics earlier this year. It's quite unlike anything I've ever seen from Lego. Edited by radiant7, 04 June 2008 - 08:27 AM.	positive

Algernon, on Jun 4 2008, 09:34 AM, said: I don't understand why there's so much negativity... this is actually my favorite of the new MM sets. The finished look is very sleek and not very gappy at all. The deployable landing pad is great, and it'll make it easy to put on a shelf without taking too much room. Lots of greebles... although I will concede that it's just begging to be modded. Still, though, I'm definitely buying this one. :) It has a really great look to it! I don't understand the negativity either, one man's treasure is another man's trash I suppose. That said, having grown up with Lego during the 80's this set has a certain nostalgia factor in its overall look and feel that harkens back to that earlier period in my life which I fondly remember. Aside from the Factory Star Justice set (elements of which I loathe), I expect the 7644 to be the closest thing to a Classic Space revival that we'll ever see again from the Lego Group, but I hope to be pleasantly suprised someday. Though I'm not living in the past, and do appreciate everything Lego is doing now and will do, and has done since. And, like you, I'm one who's definitely buying this set. No matter how few of us there may be.	positive
Great review, Mr. Boba Fett. I really like this set a lot. Some of the features may not be as good as I hoped they would, but overall this looks to be a really nice set. I'm so happy that the giant spacecrafts are finally back. Quote I've noticed a trend that the larger sets have plenty of parts potential but when assembled the model is not more than the sum of the parts... Eagle Base certainly didn't seem worth the asking price, at least this is one large model. On a positive note the lame aero tubes, darts and martian carrier pods have disappeared. Hm, actually, I don't see the comparison. Eagle base looked terible to me right from the start, so it was no suprise when it ended up being the weakest kit in the first year. This big ship, on the other hand, looked great as soon as I saw it, and still looks good.	positive
Wow! i'll definately have to check this one out. i always tried making a big mining deployment ship, but it always turned out crappy. Edited by maiq the liar, 04 June 2008 - 10:52 PM.	neutral
Nice review. Just one little point. Since there is no sound transmission through space, but there is an atmosphere on Mars through which this this thing supposedly flies, hypersonic airplane makes far more sense than hypersonic spacecraft ;)	positive
Sorry Mr. Mandalorian, I guess I was just getting a bit defensive because when this set first appeared here, there were literally 2 pages of people just bagging out the new MM sets (but then the thread took a turn and people started to warm to them, much like the Agents). I do agree that it definitely needs some MOCing, but with that work I think it has the potential to be a really amazing set in terms of what you could cram into it. The lab is a little disappointing, I've always wanted an enclosed cabin space in a vehicle this size because then all the little space guys can have a true meeting place! The drop-down landing ramp is my favourite part, it has lots of potential uses. Maybe it's even possible to integrate pneumatics :D	positive

Guys, thanks for your kind comments! I am glad that you have enjoyed this review. For this set, I think I bought about 7 to 8 sets, all for the griffins. It's used for my griffin riders in my Castle collection. Now, the green and brown parts come in very handy for Castle MOCs too. imperialshadows, on Jun 9 2008, 11:13 PM, said: A very nice little review of a pretty nice little set that I wish I'd bought between 1 and 10 of. Just for the griffin. Oh well. Your review has shown me that it's useful for more than just that, so maybe I'll try to pick one up someday. Can't have too many black capes, books, or printed things. Speaking of which: The gray thing is technically a plume, like any castle plume, except in this case it's a feather (presumably from the griffin), and made from the mold to the old Indian feathers in the Wild West sets. It's a case of an old part coming back for a slightly new use, in a new colour. Beyond that, the "stone print" tile is a bundle or rolled up blanket or package, depending on where it's used. I don't think it's ever meant to be a stone. It was used as a rolled up pack on the back of the Star Wars speederbikes, for example. Nice pics, plenty of useful information. I'd give this review an A+ Thanks for doing it! I am very happy that you enjoyed and find my review useful. Thanks for enlighten me. Now, I know where is the origin of that gray plume. I wonder if I can use it to match with my castle knights as its plume. In addition, I mistook the rolled up pack as the stone print tile. Why didn't I think of it? I must have overlook it, and used it as a stone tile instead. Nevertheless, I am glad you have give me some good insights on the parts that I am not familar with. svelte_corps, on Jun 10 2008, 10:49 AM, said: Thanks for the nice review - it was one of the first ones I got when emerging from my dark ages . I bought two of these, just for Buckbeack - I thought he would make a good statue in a Persian temple type MOC. I also liked the minifig head pumpkin and plant part in bright green - both new pieces to me at the time. All in all, it was a good castle or forest building set with a nice selection of pieces for rocks, grass, plants and trees. The dark bley plume piece also now appears in the 10185 Green Grocer set as detailing on the roof of the turret. I never thought of using Buckbeak as a statue for worship. I find this concept very interesting. Yes, I agreed that this set offers new parts at that time. Personally, I pretty like the green plant. Good for any kind of terrain settings. I did not realise that the dark bley plume piece appear in the Green Grocer. Thanks for pointing out. Edited by WhiteFang, 10 June 2008 - 03:39 AM.	positive
Mr Spielbrick, on Jun 11 2008, 04:28 PM, said: Ohhh great idea to review the "old" Potter sets! Especially the line from Prisoner of Azkaban... I was in my Dark Ages then. Luckily I was able to catch up on the missed figs with one internet order. This Draco is the best TLC has made, if you ask me. The new one (also doubling for Belloq and "guards" in the Indy line) doesn't look quite as hautain as this one. Buckbeak looks cool. Looks like his neck/head can be moved, right? Rather similar to LEGO horses. Well designed. The orange brick doesn't have a pumpkin face on it, right? Unlike the one from Philosopher's Stone in the set with the troll. I'm looking forward to more reviews by you, sir WhiteFang! Good work No printed face on the pumpkin since the event didn't happen on or near Halloween, unlike the whole troll situation I also agree that this Draco is the best one, the new one looks too much like a Draco from the oldr films, when he smirked a lot more, but, since very character got a redesign...They had to "tune him up" even if it meant changigng him for the worse	neutral
I bought about 5 or 6 of these sets when they were on sale in mid- 2006. I still have a few of them laying around unopened. I think I payed like under $5 for each and thats a great deal for all the variety of neat parts you get with this set.	positive
nice review. I like the treemaking pieces the most of this not very expensive set. The Buckbeak fig is very nice and can bow his head like the horses. I was annoyed to get another Draco without some other not made figs (Pansy Parkinson for example). About the dark bley feathers; In the second version of Hogwarts there were several of these feathers put in little 1x1 cones like it was a feather to write with it. I bought 2 sets of these and when they were for sale I just bought +/- 6 more of it. Only annoying that I had then even a bigger army of Draco's.	neutral
I'm looking forward to getting this set, as well. The Hippogriff will become the valiant steed to my princess minifig for her comic adventures. I'm really annoyed that the Harry Potter sets were released during my "dark age". I so would've wanted all of them.	neutral

Hi Everyone, Please note that this review was done back in 2006, so do forgive me if you happened to notice any dated comments. Product: 6205 V-wing Theme: Star Wars No of pieces: 118 Release Date: Feburary 2006 RRP: SGD29.90/USD9.90 Availability: Lego Shop@Home, Target, Toys 'R' Us (US & Europe), Bricksworld (SG). Lego.com said: Rule the spaceways! The sleek V-wing fighter can adapt to any situation! Position the wings and flaps in attack mode to protect Palpatine's shuttle from enemies. Or position the wings in flight mode to survey the area for intruders! Either way, the V-wing is ready to strike for the Republic. Includes Clone pilot and R4 droid. Position wings in attack or flight mode! Sorry to all for the delay, since this was supposed to be done 3 days ago. Anyway, to get on with it... Quite a minimal amount of baggies for this set, as noticed. And the best thing is... no sticker sheet. Yippee!! :bounce: The completed v-wing. Though not really a complaint, it would be nice if the entire astromech body was provided instead of only the head dome. :p Of course, then it wouldn't be movie-accurate, since the Q7 series astro-mech is integrated with the starfighter. :lol: He's definitely well-painted for a simple mini-fig. Since even the back is painted too. I have to assumed this is the same mini-fig provided for 7259 ARC-170 Starfighter too, since I don't have that set. Anyway, this mini-fig is much more accurate for this v-wing since his suit is rated against vacuum, while those in the arc-170 aren't . :p One thing that's lacking is the instruments panel in the cockpit... it's totally non-existent here. I wonder what went wrong during the design stage. Personally... this is the second most anticipated set for 2006, the first being the tie interceptor, for me. One thing is that there's no known release of the V-wing starfighter by hasbro, nor the other well-known brands. The other thing is that being a star wars vehicle collector, I would really loved to see a replica toy of the V-wing. And the V-wing by the Lego Group does not disappoint... it's nearly movie-accurate, except for the cockpit transparisteel cover which could used some paint like the x-wing's. Also, there's a permanent landing gear that quite neat, since it allows you to land the craft on uniform surfaces. The s-foils on the other hand can be quite a pain to pose into flight position. Very difficult for the s-foils to remain symmetrical during play. The "swoosh-able" or play factor of this product is quite good... just check out the pics for yourself... :D *Crackle* General Skywalker, we have incoming! To conclude, the v-wing starfighter would make a much better companion to the Eta-2 Actis Interceptor (Jedi Starfighter), than the arc-170. Coz the arc-170 seems more like a long-range bomber to me, than a snub-fighter. :p And a final pic to show it at rest... Comments (For 2008) Just an updated pic to show my latest display on the clone wars Hmm... off the record, I do understand that sometimes, reviews by most tend to a certain set of guidelines like naming the set, and showing the boxed, and out of boxed pics, and of course, the grading portion. Regarding my review, I prefer not to grade any of the lego sets at all as far as possible, because to each, his/her own. My reasons to put up a review is not to belittle the efforts of TLG in coming out with these products nor to help them market them, but to show my appreciation and enjoyment of these products. I hope noone is offended by this, and would like to apologise for any misunderstanding that this may caused. For those who do not understand the above paragraph, care not for it and Play On!

Seeming as there were no reviews of this set in the index I have uploaded mine from Jabbas Hutt . Here is my review for LEGO set 10178 Motorized walking AT-AT Because I live in the UK I got this set with 6 free duracell batteries which was great! (It's just twice as expensive as the US) Heres the basic set that is from the instructions. This is the cockpit but please note after I took this photo I realised it was slightly built wrong. Heres one of the feet in proportion to a minifig to give you a general size. This is Luke Skywalker swinging on a wire trying to destroy the AT-AT I really wish LEGO didn't make so many Luke's because I want differnt minifigs. It would also be nice for a thermal detonator piece. Underneath the AT-AT you can see the shaft that moves the back legs, the motor and squeezed in on the righ t the massive battery box. A load of cogs that move the legs. These are the included figures Snowtrooper, General Maximilian Veers, AT-AT Driver/Pilot or whatever you want to call him and Luke all whithout there wepons. please note Veers should have a dark stone snowtroooper torso with 4 red and blue badge things not 3. These are the figures with weapons I gave them and the included ones Snowtrooper has new style blaster, Veers has Standard light grey pistol like the ones from the old adventure sets, AT-AT driver has old style blaster which I call heavy Blaster and Luke has SHINY HANDLE blue Light Sabre . The Shiny blue light sabre was included with the set which is a bonus because i really dont like the grey ones. http://www.brickshel...sc00521.jpg.jpg This is the switch which is attached to the battery box on either side of the AT-AT underneath the lift up side panels. you push the forward to walk forward and backward to walk backwards simple eh . A front veiw with the the panels open. Here are the Drivers controls which are simply a cotrol panel and 2 exo-force robot hands which are joystick things seen in the film if you look closley. The almost useless carry handle. This is the weird back piece. Looking down the AT-AT from the back where you can see the the battery box and switch. Troops decending from ropes and cables and Vader leading the assult for this I hadnt got any more imp's so I used Clones Pilots. (I now have a whole load more snowtroopers) Solo and Chewie sabotaging. More troops to squash rebel scum huzahh! A very bad picture of everyone packed up inside. The size incomparison to its predecessor Overall I would give this set 9/10 because it should come with more snowtroopers or it could be and Endor version with loads of strormies and scout troopers. Aswell as this you can really sit any one down because of the battery box but I stilll find space to put all the shown figures on this review in the interior as you can see on the above image the chains and ropes are hanging down a bit. Tjis set is now limited to 5 per customer in the UK and now no longer comes with free batteries. The walking on this is a bit wonky and dosen't really walk like they do in the film as it moves two legs at a time. I am currently attaching a motor to the head to make it move independently.	negative
Nice review, I have the original AT-AT and I like it a lot. Considered buying this one but it being motorized made me not. Also, I think a set this size could really come with some more snowies! Benny	negative
Nice review ! The "Driver/Pilot whatever you call him" ( ) 's helmet looks kind of odd, and why does have a long red pole instead of a kick-butt lightsaber?	negative
Smith_Boy, on Jun 20 2008, 06:01 PM, said: i doubt that. the atat was used in the clone wars. Well you never know, maby Veers was around then, just because it was used in the clone wars dosent mean that Veers didn't design it. to Wookiepedia!	neutral
I never got the set. It looked way to skinny. I came close to buying it for the figs but then decided not to. If you compared this one to the later one there is a big difference. This one just didnt seem proporshined with the legs and its body.	negative
thank you for the review, Skipper. I never got this set because it was too expensive, and motorized. It completley reminded me of the old robotic toys called Zoids, or maybe even Gundum. At least the figs are great. A chrome lightsabe hilt for luke, ecxellent. and the pilot is cool too, and another snowie doesnt hurt. and i didnt even know about the commander guy (whatever you call him), so people could have made a custom DS this whole time?! thanks again!	positive
Hmmm, ive still got this set and i must say, i think you did a good job of reviewing it. But... Overall, i hate the set, probably the worst UCS set so far (apart from the naboo fighter but that hardly even counts as UCS) from my experience. Unless you really really want it and have nothing better to spent your $$$ on, in that case go for it. But in my case, it was a very repetitive build and final model was quite... well, bland, not must variety to it, if you know what i mean.for the price, i would really reccomend the UCS star destroyer, because thats a much better story..	negative
even though i never liked UCS, i absolutley hate this one. Sure, its great on display, but the build looks extremley boring to me, just stacking plate after plate. And as you said, its going to break a little if you touch it. The only intersting part for me is the firing laser. Although i do have to say the proce isnt too bad, i still wouldt buy it. And no minifigs so thanks for the review, but ill pass on this one. The new minifig scale DS looks awesome though, and this might have hyped some up who are buying the new DS,	negative
Good job KimT, it´s a really nice set. It will be interesting to see the size of DS2 UCS compared with the new Death Star playset. Keep up the great regulator job you are doing. Morten	positive
darkrebellion, on Jun 25 2008, 12:39 AM, said: Great review KimT . I like this set (even if I don´t own it) because it looks simple fantastic to display. I just have one question: The mini Executor can be moved around the Death Star II or its attached to that place? Thanks for the review . It's attached to the DS and cannot move as such. Though there is 4 "spots" where it can be attached to the DS. Reading your comments on this set, I can see why TLG has been forced to put it on sale on the US S@H. I don't agree that the ISD is better - IMHO they're exactly them same - big and grey This is a question of personal liking - which is the coolest DS or ISD. Not comparative. I'd still call this an ok UCS when looking at it individually, but there sure is a lot other UCS sets that would get a better score than 5/10. KimT	positive
I think it's a very weird and boring UCS set, but... What a lot of grey plates! You could build something much better out of them, but it would be fairly flat. It looks very fragile though , my UCS AT-ST is... Edited by Shoc, 25 June 2008 - 10:28 AM.	negative
I also don't feel this is a very good set. But is that old grey? In which case it would be a nice part pack... Dr. Brick	negative
Thanks for the review KimT! Honestly, like the others have said, I don't find any appeal in UCS sets, especially this one. It's just a big, incomplete, grey ball.	negative
The build was a bit boring and I suppose a big grey ball isn't all that interesting, but since the Death Star II in the movie is a big grey ball too, I don't see the problem. I didn't think it was particularly fragile. I don't care about minifigs or playability either. A few plusses: in my opinion it looked pretty damn impressive sitting in my LEGO room and the construction is really clever. All in all, I actually liked this one, but perhaps I have a different expectation of sets than most of you. Sets are mainly parts packs and would you look at the quantity of grey plate in this thing! (It's new grey BTW). I paid half price for it at shop@home UK, which is still a _lot_ more than half price from the US, and I didn't regret it for a second. Cheers, Ralph	negative
Wow, what a letdown. I recently picked up this set, and I looked up this review to see what I was getting into. Not good news. The silver lining is that it was a "Damaged box" deal at Brickworld, so it only cost me $100 (half off the already lowered price) so it was definatley worth it as a parts pack, if nothing else. It's the last unopened/unbuilt "large" kit in my collection, so even if it is repetetive, I am going to build it anyway. It is likely however that I may substitute pieces to do away with the colored interior. I've already determined that after it sits on display for a while, I want to do a Zepplin as an alternate build. Looking at the parts list it looks like its the perfect set for such an undertaking.	negative
I'd love to get my hands on one of these, but you'd need about three jobs to justify the prices of this guy on eBay. Fantastic review KimT!	neutral
KimT, on Jun 24 2008, 03:22 PM, said: 4: zero swooshability I think its very swooshable, assuming you swoosh it at the same speed it moves in the movie. :D While I would never do something like this, I bet if you packed this sucker with a bunch of M80 firecrackers it would make for a fantastic end to a stop motion movie. With it being as delicate as you say it is I bet you wouldn't destroy any parts. Edited by gotoAndLego, 03 April 2010 - 02:57 PM.	positive
neoconagenda, on 24 June 2015 - 11:29 PM, said: I decided to re-read this review because I just got this set today. I dont really have a concern over the design or repeating build process because owning this set was never an option for me as I collect UCS sets... But I am surprised to see an almost total lack of positive posts. I really hope that I enjoy this build. Hi, you may find this thread interesting, I really enjoyed Bricklinking it	neutral
I've just ordered the bits for this from bricklink (I'm awaiting the final order now) so I'm interested in these comments. I can see that, since I'll be building it with the kids, I'll have to plan in plenty of breaks and do lots of parallel building to keep us all from getting bored!	positive
You should have posted the entire review up! I am about to look at the gallery for the rest of the pics. EDIT: as soon as I post the images came thats weird. Nice review, is there more it says i'll be back? Good first Review! Edited by Skipper 24, 26 June 2008 - 09:11 PM.	neutral
sorry about that Skipper, i added the topic after the first pic was uploaded just to make sure the pics would be in the post. You probably posted while i was editing it. And i had to go to visit my grandparents, im at their house right now. sorry if you got freaked out!	neutral
Very nice review Jim! I haven't bought this set yet, but am planning to just to get a GG fig as I don't have one already. Bought an Imperial Landing Craft instead this week as it was on sale, but after this review, GG's fighter is sure to follow soon Benny	neutral
The set no longer looks as ugly as I've always thought. Thanks for the review - I might have to pick one up now to go with the MagnaGuard Fighter.	neutral
Does the sliding cockpit come off easily? My friends brothers breaks everytime you touch it, but he may have built it wrong. It put me off the set.	negative
Jameseh, on Jun 28 2008, 08:24 PM, said: Does the sliding cockpit come off easily? My friends brothers breaks everytime you touch it, but he may have built it wrong. It put me off the set. im very sad to say that SOMETIMES it does. but thats only if you hold it from the top and bottom with your fingers and thumb respectivly. But if you hold it in your palm or from the sides, it wont break. Emphasis on sometimes. But dont try to mess around with it by removing its pieces or adding new one, or modding it in any way, because the sliding mechanism wont agree with the mods and break. But this hardly takes away from anyone liking this set because, IMO, its perfect just how it is.	negative
Hello all Eurobricks members, I will be doing the second wave of the 2008 Impulse set series, which had released recently. I bought this set earlier ago, and will like to share this comprehensive review with everyone of you. Name: Troll Warrior Theme: LEGO System / Castle Year: 2008 Pieces: 19 Minifigs: 1 An image of a 5618, Troll Warrior Let the march begin The mighty brave troll warrior, carrying a dangerous cart equipped with a "flick" fire missile. Marching into the lands of the Crown Kingdom. Crown Knights must be ready for this new troll addition. From what I see, this set has a very minimum piece count since it's an impulse set. There is no unique parts found in this set. However, this set has a couple of useful accessories, such as 2 spears and 2 wooden wheels and a grey mouse running around. This set is another alternative for Castle Army builders to buy multiple sets, to build a massive Troll armies. In addition, the flick missile really works. Use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it, the missile will fly. Well, it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature. Base of the cart Different angles There is one thing I dislike about this set. The wooden wheels are too big, and it is the same as the ones in the Crossbow attack. I prefer the smaller wheels that exist in old castle sets that produced smaller cart. Since this cart size is similar to the old cart size. The old wizard's cart is a very good example of the proposed wheel. Bits and Pieces Close-up on the warrior and the mouse Summary review Playability: 5.5/10 (The playability feature is not fanastic.) Design: 6.5/10 (Design is adequate. If the wheels is much smaller and the flicking thing disappear, the score will be much higher) Price: 8/10 (An inexpensive set to get a troll warrior and a mouse.) Overall: 6/10 (To conclude, this set is good only for army builders. A new range of millitary vehicle to be added. That's all) Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed. Pictures can be found in My Brickshelf (When moderated) Edited by KimT, 10 August 2008 - 01:29 PM.	positive

Very good, nice to see how its all played out. Nice review!	positive
Guys, thanks for your kind comments. I am glad to know that you have enjoyed viewing this review. trooperdavinfelth, on Jul 2 2008, 11:15 PM, said: It's a rat. I thought by calling it as a "Mouse", it will be a little much friendly unlike calling it a rat. Brainbox, on Jul 2 2008, 11:20 PM, said: Thanks for the review. Bearing in mind that the whole point of this set is to get a cheap troll warrior, I actually quite like it. The cart isn't brilliant, but for 13 pieces it's not that bad. The troll fig is great as always, and I guess the rats are always nice to get (not so much in real life though). The sets that contain the trolls have a fairly solid number each (I mean, Tower Raid has three!), but nevertheless I think I may have to pick up a few of these. Norro, on Jul 3 2008, 06:10 AM, said: A more affordable troll warrior for those of us avoiding the large sets (me) is always nice! Thanks for the review! I must agreed with the both of you, that this is a much easier way to acquire these troll warriors at a much affordable price. I am glad these trolls are available in Impulse sets. Now, will there will be a dwarf impulse set in the future? I supposed that will be much interesting. G.L.MAN, on Jul 3 2008, 12:15 AM, said: Its a good review but you forgot another thing. THE Troll needs a shiled like they used to in the 2007 castle line the sets always had shields for the minifigs and it could be better if it was 3.00 instead of 3.50 but yes it is a good impulse great army builder. If this impulse set includes a troll shield, my rating will defintely go higher. This is a troll army builder set, with minimum feature and limited weapons range. If the troll comes with an armor or a shield, I will think this set is worth it. Troll armor is hard to get by, as it appeared only in Troll Warship and Tower Raid. Edited by WhiteFang, 03 July 2008 - 03:06 AM.	positive
Hey, your review is great (as usual!!) As for the set itself - well, it's an impulse set after all - small and cheap, nothing special. Well, the rat is special, hehe, for me the rat is the most interesting in the set (cause I don't have a rat). I don't have a troll warrior either, but I'm not very interested.	neutral
Quote In addition, the flick missile really works. Use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it, the missile will fly.

Thank you for the review. The set is nice, I didn't need the flickfire missiles and would have rather a orc/trol shield instead, but I think I will pick one up.	positive
Glad you guys like the review. Brainbox, on Jul 3 2008, 06:19 PM, said: Looking at this is making me want to build one of the favourite sets of my childhood, 6649 Street Sweeper (might do that today actually). Cheap. good pieces (despite the lack of a bin lid... that's just inviting disaster isn't it?), nice fig, and one of those blue brushes, which I've always loved but never managed to use. The 6649 looks lovely, and I hope you managed to restore it. Indeed, a bin without a lid is inviting trouble.	positive
Thanks for the review! Poor little minifig: This guy has to haul the heavy machine all the way from the depot onto the littered streets to locate some trash, but when he has finally found some and switches on the machine everything will be launched towards his pants.... No wonder he's looking sad.... A nice set though, and inventive too! When it comes to streetsweepers, I remember getting the first of it's kind on my birthday in 1991.	positive
Hello all Eurobricks members, I will be doing a continuation of my Impulse set reviews. This will be the third review at a go. Hope everyone of you will find this review useful in a way. Name: Coast Guard Kayak Theme: LEGO System / Town / City Year: 2008 Pieces: 21 Minifigs: 1 An image of a 5621, Coast Guard Kayak Roll Roll, Roll your boat It seemed the coast guard has a kayak of his own, roaming in the sea, making sure that swimmers will be safe in the beach. Now, I am illustrating him as a life guard instead. This set is simply wonderful. Among the 4 new impulse sets, Coast Guard Kayak is the best looking set in my opnion. The kayak design is very simple but looks realistic . Furthermore, if you don't need it to be a coast guard kind of stuff. Use it as a leisure water spot instead down in the marina. I will think any LEGO citizen will love to have some water spot in their busy life. So come down here and wind down with this new sport. Bits and Pieces Kayak and the bouy The bouy is very useful to position it at the coast of your water to highlight the boundaries in the sea, and warning incoming ships or vessels. Oh, I did not make it tilted purposely. There is a white round base which allow it to tilt on both ends. Useful parts These parts are useful to add on in your city. Somehow, when I see that red cone, I can use it as a police stop, to inspect vehicles on the road or form a barricade with it. The bouy base shape is unique too. I like it very much. It is great to attached it by the side of the boat as a life bouy. The coast guard's life vest and helmet are very useful for water activites. The life vest was produced in past sets, and now it re-surfaced again. I am glad these vests made their way back. A look of him, without the life vest Summary review Playability: 7.5/10 (Fun to play with, especially the bouy when you see it moving up and down.) Design: 8.5/10 (Design is simple but straight to the point, especially the kayak design.) Price: 8/10 (An inexpensive set to get more coast guards and more kayaks.) Overall: 8.5/10 (A very good set to have in your LEGO town. The kayak is simply so lovely to me.) Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed. Pictures can be found in My Brickshelf (When moderated)	positive
Thanks for doing these Impulse sets, WhiteFang. This set looks like it has a good number of useful parts. I dont have the minifig torso or head, nor the oar or the life jacket.	positive
Hello all Eurobricks members, This will be my last impulse set review for the second wave. Hope everyone of you will find my reviews useful and helpful in your purchase. Name: Crystal Hawk Theme: LEGO System / Mars Mission Year: 2008 Pieces: 26 Minifigs: 1 An image of a 5619, Crystal Hawk Alpha 3 in Sector 5, reporting to base Alpha 3, Crystal Hawk, reporting for duty, Sir! May I present Mars Mission, latest scout craft, code named "Crystal Hawk". This spacecraft looks very sleek and cool with its usual white and orange color combination. I am not a fan of Mars Mission, but these white mini-figs simply attracted me for it. In fact, I only owned its impulse sets, and none of its main sets. Nevertheless, this set has the "swoosh" factor. I was swooshing around in my home last night. Well, I am not swooshing it like KimT though. Am I seeing double? Haha, the answer is "No". It has double sided face. I combined the pictures, to illustrate the two facial expressions. Bits and Pieces Different angles Love the way how the wings bend upwards and downwards. The only thing I find it a little bit wierd for spacecraft. Normally, I thought joystick is the typical navigation controls for a spacecraft instead of a steering wheel? I am not complaining about a steering wheel in a spacecraft. To me, it's quite an uncommon sight. Anyway, the white steering wheel is an useful part for making vehicles MOCs. Summary review Playability: 8/10 (Fun to play with when you bend the wings up and down.) Design: 8.5/10 (Design is simple, but creates a sleek and cool look.) Price: 8/10 (An inexpensive set to get more scout craft and mars mission mini-figs) Overall: 8.5/10 (A very good set to have for any Mars Mission fans, and for collectors like me whom can't afford all Mars Mission sets, this set is a very great alternative.)

Glad you enjoyed viewing the review. xenologer, on Jul 3 2008, 01:12 PM, said: The Hawk, it seems to me, lacks a cockpit, theres not even a seat to keep the pilot from falling off. Perhaps it they'd redesigned it to be a backpack jetpack sort of unit using similar pieces, it'd at least make some sense? These are some of the improvements which we can do it ourselves to mod it better. I think these are great suggestions. Otherwise, we can add in a white air tank to be included onto the mini-fig. xenologer, on Jul 3 2008, 01:12 PM, said: Based on the other MM impluses, Can we assume this goes for 3.5$USD? at that price it seems to me, that the Astro Fighter at 5$USD was already a superior impluse set. Guess I'd buy one on clearance, for the minifig. In S@H, Crystal Hawk is priced at USD $3.50. I bought mine at a much expensive price, when you compared it with USD. I never bought the Astro Fighter. I am supposed that it comes with a little bit more parts and an additional alien fig with it.	neutral

Woo! Rock Raiders! Only the best theme ever! (That's right, possibly even better than Castle `07!) Cheers for the review metalandi, hopefully you can inspire others to see the greatness of Rock Raiders too! I love how everything was so simple, yet so effective. It was loads of fun to play with and build the alternate models when I was younger as well (and probably still is ). Do you plan of doing any other reviews? Or do you have any other sets? Rapid Rider is another great small one, adding a bit of diversity with a water-based vehicle, and you get the Bandit minifig. Or you could get The Rock Raiders set, and get all of our spelunking friends (don't make me name them all ). Or, if you want a slightly bigger set, Loader Dozer could be the way to go, Axle's a pretty cool minifig too, and you get a rock monster. Sorry if the last comments were detracting from your review, don't think I didn't like it, becuase it was great! I really hope you can do more! Oh, and yes, my torso does come from a female fig... ~Peace	positive
Unfortunately i dont have any other sets yet, i think i got one of the bigger vehicles back in the time, but i don't have any sets from this time anymore. but i certainly plan to get the loader dozer and/or the Chrome Crusher soon. I found an ebay auction where somebody is selling the sets 4940, 4950 and 4970 new & sealed hopefully i have luck with that. It's only at 4 Euros right now, but it's still running 6 days... http://cgi.ebay.de/w...t...A:IT&ih=005	neutral
Rock Raiders was one of my favorite LEGO themes ever.	positive
This set looks like a dandy. Is the Darth Maul fig any different in respect to the torso or head design to the original?	neutral
Nice review Jim, I think i would only buy this for Darth Maul though you definitely showcased all the cool features really well!	neutral
I'm not real fond of slimeface. He looks too much like the joker-bombs. I was hoping for something newer. The slime printing is a nice touch though. Steve	negative
Great review. I love that slime Face !	neutral
thanks for review...(i hope svelt corps still reviews it ) slime is pretty cool, i knew about the torse for a while but its no less cool now	positive
Great review, ReZourceman! Your pics really show off the sub well and it's good to see the build in progress. I also have this set but I didn't apply stickers to the sub as I was planning to reuse the nice dark blue pieces. However as shown in your review they do brighten it up a fair bit. I can't say this is my favourite Agents set; the boat is a little oddly proportioned and the sub, although retro looking, has practically no interior and would be difficult to customise to put more in (unlike, say, the clever job Batbrick did with the Penguin sub in his review). The sub kind of looks like some Jules Verneish sea creature - I would have liked it if they'd gone all the way and made it some kind of giant robot jellyfish or squid I do agree with you about Slime Face - he has a fantastic torso with all the slime dripping down which is a bit obscured by the air tank. It's really encouraging that in the last 2 Missions we've had great extra villains added in. The only thing I would add about the octopus is that the glow in the dark plastic is mixed in unevenly with the aqua blue, so it doesn't glow in the dark evenly - it's kind of like the Mars Mission jellies in that respect though much cooler! Thanks again for the great review!	negative
Darth_Legois, on Jul 11 2008, 10:28 AM, said: [color="#0000ff"] *Cough*AlphaTeam*cough* I'd forgotten about Ogel's mutant vehicles I guess I meant a bigger cross between the 8636 sub and the big squid from 7775 Aquabase Invasion - that is such a great design. Sort of keep the retro feel but make it bigger. With the 8636 sub, there's really only room for one Agent to sit and despite its size, there's just a few (not amazingly great) functions such as the hidden chest and missiles.	positive
It was £34.99 so USD its likely to be $45-$55 I would imagine.	neutral

Aside from the price, I love this set! When I saw the prelim pics of Agetns I did not like the theme, but all the sets are starting to look more attractive now I can see the cool features and details! As for this set, I really like the bad-guy boat for some reason and the submarine looks good - I love the dark blue colour.	positive
Great review I just thought I'd comment saying thanks because if I had'nt found this review I'd of never made an account on eurobricks!	neutral
Give me an excuse to sneak into your house, and let me have a feel of these Classic Space sets. I never had a chance to have any experience with the Classic Space sets. Through your recent reviews on these, it gave me a wider perspective of space. I loved to play space as a child such as the late classic and Futuron sets. Back to the review, this 6927 is a great mobile command center vehicle suitable for all kinds of harsh terrain in the unknown space. The 6 big wheels are real solid and firm back in those days. Transparent blue windscreen at the front, is wonderful. I just love these parts, especially when it's in blue. 4 computer printed tiles. Aren't LEGO so generous back in those days, when printed parts are more commonly available unlike now. It's a real nice set. However, there is one thing I don't understand about this design. Why is the driver seat has a wide back with no cover behind? And, the command center has no door at the back? I understand that these Space guys are always carrying their helmet around, for oxygen supply. I wonder if there is a better answer to it.	positive
Dovchenko, on Jul 10 2008, 08:24 PM, said: No more of your great reviews? Why? A good review right here, got into the thick of the set without becoming boring with an absence of pictures or not having enough text. I've exhausted my collection of classic space sets. I'd love to keep them going, but just one more set. You can check out this INDEX for a complete listing and links to each of the reviews. Thanks for the feedbback. mutex, on Jul 10 2008, 09:37 PM, said: This is one of my favorite space sets of all time. I even had 2 of them back in the days. My only complain about this set was that I found that the wheels where too small , I had some trouble passing the rover over the little "craters-mountains" of the space plates It is a gem in the Classic Space collection. The playability is great! I agree with you as I never thought this was much of an all-terrain vehicle with the wheel construction. The bottom of the vehicle would always touch the bottom of non-smooth surfaces. The wheels do need to be bigger (but I still like them). CP5670, on Jul 10 2008, 10:43 PM, said: I got this set off ebay a while ago and one of them was broken in shipping, even though the set was otherwise in display model condition, and the other one broke off while I was building the set. I replaced them with the newer variety. Great buy on this one. What did it cost you? hewman, on Jul 10 2008, 11:11 PM, said: not in attempt to hijack your thread but to add to it, here's a pic of my blacktron 1 version of this beautiful set. That's excellent. I love the alternate color scheme. Great job here! WhiteFang, on Jul 11 2008, 12:11 AM, said: However, there is one thing I don't understand about this design.

The extra space was probably for the oxygen tanks on the figs. It makes taking them off a lot easier. As for the lab/control center, I never had an issue with it being open. I think this was just for playability. One could always "pretend" that some sort of invisible force ray closed the side when activated. Great comments! I love hearing what others think of these classics.	positive
Oh man, this review takes me back! I got this set when I was 8 years old, and LOVED it. I remember modding it to remove the lab in the back, and I put in a giant laser cannon instead. 'Cause when you're 8 years old, everything needs a giant laser cannon. CP5670, on Jul 11 2008, 12:43 AM, said: The only bad thing about this set is the name. It can't even roll over a single plate's height. Not very "All Terrain" at all. HA! Very true. The vehicle is built so low to the ground that the front end catches on everything.	positive

Was just curious about the design, as I am not very familar with Classic Space. I supposed the oxygen tanks is quite big to carry around, especially when the vehicle is so cramped. These allowance of space, makes them much mobile to move about in the vehicle. CP5670, on Jul 12 2008, 02:39 AM, said: I just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed: Great job! Thanks for sharing and answering the question I posted above. I love the way you modify the front and back. Now, I need to find where is the entrance to the Mobile Command Center.	neutral
i've always associated this set with 6929, the Voyager. they're of the same timeframe and more or less the same style. 6927 is without any doubt my favourite ground vehicle of space. it was pretty simple, but it was such a creative set. the stories you could tell with this model... g... most defenitely in my top 5 of space sets...	positive
Great review! All-Terrain Vehicle was one of my two favorite LEGO sets ever. I have to include a shot of the back of the box, because I love the ideas LEGO provided for this set: hewman, on Jul 11 2008, 01:11 AM, said: Very nice Blacktron-themed 6927! CP5670, on Jul 11 2008, 01:39 PM, said: I just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed: I love your modified 6927 with the enclosed front. 2 weeks ago I modified my All-Terrain Vehicle as well, in a similar way, but just *slightly* more modified from the original. I call it: 6927-C 'All-Terrain Vehicle Improved Class' a few clues for anyone to easily build this themselves: Also, a much more extensive modification/MOC that I call 6927-W "All-Terrain Warrior" Quote 6927-W 'All-Terrain Warrior' I wanted to make a combat variant of 6927, so I used the 6927-C Improved Class as the starting point and went from there. I added a completely new forward-cab, close to the ground, for a ground--observer to monitor the terrain. I added even larger wheels, allowing this variant to truly be "all terrain", ...besides, what good is it having a combat vehicle if it gets stuck in the middle of a firefight? The 6927-W has a five man crew: a driver, a gunner who also serves as overall-commander, a terrain observer in the very front. In the lab are the weapons systems officer and computer/tech specialist. The All-Terrain Warrior vehicle portion is armed with lasers and blaster cannons, with options for other weapons. There are short-range nuclear rockets on the lab, guided by the rader control. The lab now has blast-proof shutters on the windows protecting the crew from rocket blast. Additional protection can be added to the lab, if-need-be, such as more extensive blast-shielding. All-in-all, the All-Terrain Warrior is a beast of a machine. Two 6927s can protect an entire convoy of standard 6927 or 6927-C. These are my very first attempts at modification and doing a MOC of Classic Space LEGO! Edited by ParallaxScroll, 29 August 2009 - 03:03 AM.	neutral
Thanks for the review! The interior looks nice, better than I expected, Lots of great parts but, as you say, so many of them are stickered. After Rocket Ride, the stickers in the SB sets seem to have gone crazy - the early sets weren't slathered in them. 2 new figs though is most welcome.	positive

There's a lot great pieces in this set, I would be willing to get the set just for them. Thanks for the great review!	positive
I recently bought this set for my daughters birthday. It's the first BELVILLE set that I've bought for her so it's a bit of an experiment. The house is 5 rooms and it's made up of mostly large pieces. There still is a decent amount of normal LEGO in it though. The doorways in the house align when it is opened out. Starting with the bathroom, included is a shower, toilet, sink with vanity and a baby potty. The mirror sticker is one of the few that I put on. The open plan lounge/kitchen/dining room is well appointed as well and it has a nice glass table and coffee machine. The kitchen chairs are Fabuland parts... and don't work really well. It seems they are having jellyfish for dinner! The clock is the only printed part in the set. Upstairs is a baby room and the master bedroom. The radio and the TV (not shown) were stickers to my disappointment. Up top is an extra room suitable for reading. (Those antenna things were made from spare parts by my daughter. I have no idea what they are supposed to be... ) There are some stickers that go on the back, but I didn't put them on. As it is the set looks OK this way, but since it is a dolls house it doesn't really matter. I do think though that the fireplace should have been given a back. The BBQ is made from normal parts and is quite effective. I think it uses the same light brick that's in the 4998 Stegosaurus set. My kids were using it as a torch before my grumbling ruined their fun... Like all BELVILLE sets, the highlight is arguably the accessories. I'll be borrowing a few of these from time to time... Here is the controversial baby catapult. As you can see, it works OK, but LEGO probably should have tried a bit harder. We also bought for her 7583 Playful Puppy. It also comes with some nice accessories, but not enough to justify buying unless you want the rest of the parts. Poor puppy; where does he sleep? Here is my daughter assembling it. She made me make the house though as she wanted to play a game we bought her. (Note the LEGO drink bottles! ) I didn't take any photos of the figures as they don't seem to be anything new, but I can if people want me to. At the time I was in bit of a hurry as I took these before bed so I wouldn't be stressed if the kids broke it the next day. Overall, these sets seem overpriced to me, and hard to justify unless you actually want a buildable doll's house. (Which we did.) It's still too early to tell if my daughter likes it or not... but at this stage it seems she lost interest in a few days. She does tend to go back to toys though.

Nice review, good to see your almost letting your kids play with your lego I like the functionality of the baby catapult, its good that they include some working features in a build this big! Are you not showing the figures because its really Hugh Hefners Playboy/Belville Mansion? I dont see the grotto though, must be an add on set like the poor puppy! Its just so darn PINK	positive
The LEGO lives on!! But you are one evil parent, getting your kids addicted to Belville like that! But uh... whats that doll doing on the bed? Whats underneath it...? And look what you found... a bucket!	neutral
Great review Sinner, I haven't seen a Bellville set review before! I just realised what you meant by 'fore' in the topic subtitle, too. ImperialShadows, on Jul 12 2008, 09:31 AM, said: Obviously, it really is all about the accessories, and it's got 'em, but not enough to make me spend that kind of cash, and I don't even mind having a pile of pink parts around. I agree, a lot of the pieces are good but I don't think I would get it. However, I do think I will get the set with the dogs, so my minifigs can have giant mutant hounds!

A nice review with a nice touch of Sinner which made me laugh. The playfull puppy set has saussages I think I would buy a playfull puppy, It has nice pieces and the puppy can also be used for minifigs as a big dog. Why haven't they not made a saussagesseller for City. Maybe in the future. There are already more chickenlegs in minifigs sets.	positive
Thanks for your report and the pics, my sister wants this set, but she's already got the last house And she doesn't play very often with it, but the new one looks very good, too	positive
I'm confused... the finale of Big Brother Australia was last week. So why only now are we seeing pictures of housemates Brigette and Ben performing a striptease? And where is Rory in his signature g-string? Very odd.	neutral
I bought this today, mainly because it was 25% off, but I'd been eyeing it for a long time. The accessories truly are brilliant! There's so much here to be pillaged for other uses, as people have said. I picked up heaps of new parts I've never had, or rare ones in even rarer colours. To be honest, I was surprised and impressed by the range and versatility of the regular bricks as well. When you look at the box art, what jumps out at you are the giant pink walls and curved pieces, but there's a nice amount of white arches and lime green bricks, not to mention all the windows and the trans blue 1x2x5 bricks. And plants! It's a good thing the target audience likes stickers though, there's more here than I've seen on any set except the 7709 Sentai Fortress! I think they were aiming for one sticker per page of instructions I hope Belville returns in 2010 Thanks for the review, Sieggy! Did your daughter ever go back to it?	positive
paanjang16, on Jun 17 2009, 11:25 PM, said: Belville looks horrible to me Too barbie-ish and does not look Lego at all. I think that is the idea! So that means you wouldn't think much of Scala then?	neutral
7655: Clone Battle Pack Year: 2007 Number of pieces: 58 Number of minifigs: 4 Price: 9.99 USD Brickset Welcome to my third review on Eurobricks, I hope you enjoy! While at any store that sells LEGO (Target, Wal-Mart, TRU, etc.), you will notice that the clone battle packs on the shelf are way fewer in number than the droids battle pack. As you might guess, the clones are way more popular, and finding them gets harder and harder as the release date of this set goes farther into the past. So stock up! Alright, heres a pic of the box: A small box, as expected for inexpensive sets like these. Note the "Build your army" button on the front: TLG obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples, and with good reason, which will be explained later in this review. Well, lets get straight to it: The contents of this set. You will notice a speeder bike, a gun turret, and some clones. Looking good so far! Lets have a look at the turret: An excellent Star Wars element to have around, especially for MOCing. It is very cleverly built, using a tire guard from CITY sets for the general shape of the turret mount. All you have to do is attach the (new mold! explained later) gun to the 2x1 plate with the center stud, and... Presto! I wonder how the clones build these turrets to fast in the middle of battle... A rear view: With a clone mounted: My only gripe about the turret is that you have to take off the gun in order for every clone to have a gun. Now, we move on to the vehicle of the set, the speeder bike: A rather sleek and good looking bike, with some useful pieces on it as well, such as the blue cones, the megaphones, and the engines. Some say it looks bare without the figs mounted on it, but I think it looks just fine. The commander drives while a trooper shoots on the back. A side view: And a rear view: My only gripe is the same as the turret: you have to remove the back gun for all the clones to have weapons while on foot. The back pistol attaches to a 2x2 round studded plate with a Technic hole in the middle. Finnaly, here are the new guns: This set comes with 1 new blaster rifle and three new pistols. It could have included one more rifle for the turret. And of course, the figs: Includes: 1 yellow commander (lovely fig), 1 Shocktrooper (comes with a pair of elctrobinouculars), and two regular troopers (so clean and white). The figs are excellent, all that any SW or LEGO fan should want. It could have maybe included one more regular trooper, but that might be pushing it. Thats all for now, folks, here is the... FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, extremely easy, should take the seasoned builder about 5 minutes to complete. A fun build, though. Playability: 5/10, I guess you can get this with the droid battle pack and make them battle, but this set has no real play features of its own. But it is good for collecting troops and using them for MOCs. Swooshability: 9/10, I guess you can zoom the speeder bike around... Minifigs: 10/10, four great figs that should be bought in multiples, a great army builder. Design: 10/10, a clever turret, an awesome speeder, and four great clones. What more do you need in a 10 dollar set? Price: 8/10, not bad I suppose, but if you calculate a dime for each piece, this set should come out to 5-6 dollars. But still, billions of these are being sold world-wide, and TLG is making a ton of money off of them. Overall score: 9.5/10, a truly memorable set, one that will be a favorite for ages to come, and very popular. A great army builder for a small price, plus vehicle and turret! With only a few very minor flaws, this set is one of the best of Star Wars. And this concludes my review, and as always, comments are most welcome.	positive
Nice review! I got over the gun problem with the shockie since the rebel in the Y-Wing doesn't need one. I wish I could have gotten more of these but I'll know for next time.	positive
When I saw this topic I was like : "Oh my god this set is out since 2007. This guy is so late!" but I read your review and this idea got out of my mind! Thank you Jim! I have 2 of these and I even have twice more droids than clones! I should have buy more but it's sold out now	positive

7654: Droids Battle Pack. Year: 2007 Number of pieces: 102 Number of minifigs: 7 Price: 9.99 USD Brickset Hi everybody, and welcome to my fourth review on Eurobricks. Today, I will review the Droid Bttle Pack set. NOTE: This set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid, but I replaced them (along with the crooked arms) with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms. A picture of the box: As it is on the shelves of major-retail stores. A small box, as expected for inexpensive sets like these. Note the "Build your army" button on the front: TLG obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples, and with good reason, which will be explained later in this review. An overview of the set's content: You can see a droid carrying vehicle, a STAP, and some battle/ super battle droids. A look at the carrier: A light tank. Note the guns on the front: The guns and cockpit can turn a little bit left and right from the main body. Also, the guns can move up and down, free from the cockpit: And check out the cockpit: Two 2x1 center studded plates side by side for the pilot to stand on. Now, moving on to the STAP: A small, very useful vehicle in the SW universe. These are seen frequently in both the movies and games (as well as other multimedia). The design is very clever, using vertical building and a clear stand. Rear view: The guns/ handlebars can go this far back: And finally, the figs: The figs are very good, but very common. We havent seen SBDs in a while, and now instead of metallic blue, they are metallic dark grey. The worst part of this set is that the battle droids have the old arms and guns, while the droids in the MTT and clone pack (both of the same year as this) have the new ones. I wonder why TLG decided to do that... again, This set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid, but I replaced them (along with the crooked arms) with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms. So thats about it, heres the... FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, very easy, should take the seasoned builder about 5-10 minutes. Playability: 6/10, has a few play feature, but nothing exciting. Is good for MOCs and army building. Swooshability: 8/10, I suppose you could fly around the STAP... Minifigs: 7/10, the battle droids are good, but very common, and the dont come with new arms or guns. The SBDs are very nice, and in a new color. All figs are great for army building. Design: 8/10, the STAP was clever, but the carrier was a little bulky. Price: 10/10, as fair as it gets. Overall: 7.5/10, the figs are great to have and make MOCs and armies, and the vehicles are pretty cool (the carrier is a little lame). The main problem with this set is that the BDs dont get the new guns or arms, so they dont fit in with all the new sets. Also, droids arent as cool as clones. But the price is very fair. And now, my review has ended. Unfortunately, I believe this will be my last review for a long time for two reasons: one, the remaining sets that arent done (according to KimT's index) I either don't have or are broken or have missing pieces. and two, my budget is low right now, and I wont be able to get the Clone Wars sets right when they are released, so someone will probably beat me to reviewing them. Too bad, because I would love to do an RGS review... well, as always, comments very welcome!	positive

Hello all Eurobricks members and Town Lovers, This is my first classic town review. For today, I will be featuring the 6641, 4-Wheelin' Truck which is produced in 1987. For some younger members in EB, you might not have encounter such a baby roaming down the streets, horning at others with its big massive truck. Considering this is a 1987 set, such a vehicle size is considered big in those days. Name: 4-Wheelin' Truck Theme: LEGO System / Town Year: 1987 Pieces: 80 Minifigs: 1 Price: USD$6.50 An image of a 6641, 4-Wheelin' Truck *Hello Everyone* Why the name 4-Wheelin' Truck? It is because this truck is equipped with 4 heavy duty wheels which is considered "big" among other small vehicles in Classic Town. Please take note, most of the vehicles that are produced in Classic Town era, are 4-studs wide. This truck is no exception. Meet the driver and his truck! This truck has a very good combinations of different colors that are common for most town vehicles. It made used of blue, white and red as its primary combinations. I find that this combinations is quite soothing to its eyes especially the blue bricks. In addition, the mini-fig torso is superb. The driver must be a great fan of this vehicle. I realised most truck drivers in the classic town era wear this most of the time. I wonder if its some kind of an organization? Front view There is 2 red doors coupled with the truck, to enable the driver to get in properly. This vehicle is considered big in the 1980s. However, if you compared it with the current city vehicles, this truck certainly will not outsize the current designs. Please take note of the wheels. The wheels are pretty different. I don't remember seeing these wheels in many other vehicles, maybe some members can help me on this. Most of the classic town vehicles have a window frame on top which is known as a "sun-roof". In this set, this feature is also included. Furthermore, the vehicle frame has a simple mechanism which all town lovers love. It is to lift it up and place their driver in and out the seat. Most importantly, you do not have to take off the entire window frame just to put in the driver. Different angles of the 4-Wheelin' Truck SNOT Technique? Back 20 years ago, LEGO had been experimenting with SNOT technique. You can see that the back looks very neat without the studs. In addition, it can be quite useful to place a mini-fig on top of it, or throw some baggage for some quick getaway. Summary review Playability: 8/10 (Great addition to your Town collection.) Design: 8.5/10 (Very good design. I love 4-studs truck. At least, it is able to occupy one side of the lane) Price: 9/10 (An inexpensive set based on the 1987 pricing) Overall: 8.5/10 (A must have for all Classic Town lovers, we have been complaining for more wider range of vehicle) I gave it a "4" based on my Review Score Card. What about yours? Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Pictures can be found in My Brickshelf (When moderated) Edited by WhiteFang, 13 July 2008 - 12:08 PM.	positive
Glad you guys liked this review. BerndDasBrot, on Jul 13 2008, 07:33 PM, said: great review of a lovely set! thank you! sadly I don't see my 6641 really often, because it is kind of in the back of my shelf. But I might get it and swoosh it (?) a few times...! IMHO i think 6675 is a little bit more aggressive. cool! Please make more! Swoosh it around?? I will prefer to use it to "vrooom" it around on my road baseplates. BerndDasBrot, thanks for reminding me of the 6675. I will need to find it and restore it first. Meanwhile, watch out for more upcoming Classic Town Reviews.	neutral

First of all, another great review! Thanks for doing these! As for the wheels, these were primarily Technic wheels but did find their way into some other models. In white, I can only find a handful of minifig sets that they are included with.

In fact, I am quite fond of this lovely torso with its symbolic truck printed on it. snefroe, on Jul 14 2008, 07:37 PM, said: hmmm.... i probably would not have bought this as a kid in 1987, unless i had money to spare or the shop had no other set from space or castle, the two other big lines in 1987, and no better set in the town section. i think it's a great parts pack, but the model itself does not look very attractive. I never really liked those wheels, honestly. They're from the basic sets, mostly, and they work pretty well in those, but i'm just not a fan... the roof, on the other hand, was very popular and the blue modified bricks at the front were quite rare in those days, but generally speaking, this was not the star of 1987. I wouldn't agreed less. This set is a good to have and is defintely not the main highlights in 1987. This is actually a great add-on to your classic town vehicle collections. After seeing so many typical police cars, ambulance, fire engine and etc, I need more variety of civillan vehicles roaming down the streets.	neutral
Dear AFOL friends, due to leakage of production plant in our country one member of our Lego club had bought a new promo set.

OMG! OMG! Wow! That's simply amazing. Wow! I can't say more... Wait, I can. This is such a beatiful set. I sure hope it will be available for us to, like European people. It's so nice. It looks like the real thing, great cottage, great pieces, great van and figures. And the windthing. Wow!	positive

Sounds cool but I can't seem to find any of these leaked pics, not even on brickshelf. Maybe I am not searching under the right phrases. Oh well. I guess I can wait patiently.	neutral
That sounds amazing! A wind power plant as a Lego set is absolutely awesome and helps the Lego City to get environmental energy. Regrettably I missed the pics. When browsing through BS I didn't find them, too . Can someone please post a link or sent me the link/picture via PM ? Thanks. Klaus-Dieter	neutral
I now found pics, too. That's absolutely ! After 10188 Town Plan this is the best City set ever! I really like the neat landscape with the little hill (there are a bench and some flowers on it, too ) and this brilliant cottage ! Great idea with that power function that the wind mill turns and then enable the lights of the cottage ! Concerning the City theme I must say: In the last time TLG comes up with one great surprise after the other. Does anyone know where and when it'll be available (this year I think - otherwise there wouldn't be already pics, would they?) and how much it'll cost (I think about 70 Euros, what do you think?)? I only hope that it'll be available in Germany, too, otherwise I would be really if I am not able to get it since it is a must for every City and environment fan!

The spinning machine is a centerfuge. (Not sure of the spelling ) I remember wanting this set because my friend had the larger station with full rocket. Seeing this makes me want it again.....	positive
WOW!!!! I'm just surprised...I thought these were all street dated for the 26th of July. At least that's what I read according to Lucas information. Oh well, gratz on getin one of the new sets. I'm looking forward to seeing the Droid Gunship and the Twilight real, real, REAL soon!	neutral
The base of the propeller. It wobbles a bit, but doesn't fall off. Very sturdy. Right side of the rear propeller. And the left (and better) side. The tail. It uses construction similar to the X-wing's nose, but on a larger scale. Definitely cool. A very neat part of the copter. The guns are constructed so that... ... they turn without turning the cockpit. The interior is rather blase, though.	positive
Another of my favorite parts - landing gear. This is the front section. ... and it retracts! Unlike most ships with landing gear, this does NOT retract without effort (coughXWINGcough). Very sleek. The back landing gear. ... and again, smooth retraction. Gotta love it. FINAL SCORE: 8.4/10 Parts: 8/10 Figs: 10/10 Dinos: 2/10 Copter: 9/10 Value: 7/10 Don't Buy If: - you can wait for Vikings - you don't like any set with stickers - you're not a space fan Buy If: - you're a space fan - you don't mind stickers/don't apply them - you're like to create cool figures Overall, I think it was worth the price, even at 605 pieces. However, I'd suggest buying Vikings even considering this. Well, hope this review (unexpected as it was ;-)) helped someone out there. Until next time, Bloody Jay	positive
Great Review Jay !!!!! Tks a lot ;) I am not that of the big fan of the copter due to its proportions - but I admit its really asome looking, better as I expected :oD The best are those MFs !!!!!! They are truly awsome !!!!!!! I wiil but some of the smaller sets just for the figs hehe (too bad that my favorite - your second best - don't come in the smallers sets :'( ). Are you going to review the other sets as well ??? That could be cool !!!!!	positive
Thanks, Bloody_Jay. Another brilliant review. I really like the helicopter. Though I hate the stickers (it seem like there are a lot of it), it won't stop me from buying it. Too bad that when will the Dino line arrive in Singapore. . . :'( Guess I've have to wait for the meanwhile.	positive
That looks like a really great set, although I don't think I'd have anywhere to put it. I don't think I'll ever be able to get the set anyway, since it doesn't come out over here.	positive
Wow, great review, for a great set. Thanks Jay. I really like it, although to big for my city. :( I too really like the MFs. Because of your review, I am definitely considering it. Thanks again, LegoBmw.	positive
That's interesting news about the European release. I'd definitely be interested to see how they modify the set - chains, ropes, and crates are definitely useful pieces. Can't wait for pictures. To everyone looking for just the figures - don't skip out and get the smaller set and the tank. Spend the extra $20 and get the T1. It's well worth it. I might pick up the Steel Sprinter and the Fire Hammer myself, still trying to decide. If I do, I'll review them.	positive
I love this set... and I wish I thought of the bridge piece idea! The only part I don't like is the lift... Thanks for the great review. metalandi, on Jul 18 2008, 06:53 PM, said: Edit: Oh damn, i forgot to write "review" in the topic title, can a mod please add this? Thanks! Done!	positive
Excellent review Metalandi. It's always great to see early pictures of new sets. This set really reminds me of an oil rig, and could probably be easily modified as one (if one wanted an alternate model). The two components that I like most are the boat crane and the control room, but other sections are pretty slick as well. Are those printed pieces in the control room, or stickers? I'm really starting to gain an appreciation for these new coast guard sets. They've come a long way over the years: 575 Coast Guard Station -Released 1978. I picked up the Control Boat & Tower (7739) a few weeks ago but haven't opened it yet). In any case, thanks for taking the time to review this set and share it over EB.	positive
Great set and great parts pack as well! I guess I´m gonna buy this when it´s on sale, just for the orange parts. Excellent for Exo Force	positive
svelte_corps, on Jul 18 2008, 08:22 PM, said: Thanks for the awesome review, metalandi! Your pics are very clear and you go into detail about all the functions of the set. I agree, this is a great set - one of the best of the CG line for sure, way better than the boat set with the tower on the Bionicle baseplate, and cheaper too. I even like the helicopter better than the oversized version. Lots of great parts and a really nice build by the looks of it too. I can't wait for this to be released in Oz! Yea great review metalandi But i fail too see how this will be in my budget as well as- Most of the Agents sets + At-te, RGS & V-19 . I also agree with svelte i like this little chopper better then the big one and it actualy has a place to "stay" instead of the big one theres no landing pad for the big one too go on in any CG set so far. and its only $80 AUSD	neutral

That's a great review of a great City set! Thank you very much, metalandi! First of all I wanted to buy the 7999 CG Petrol Boat & Tower. But now I surely will buy this amazing platform instead of the 7999 if my local toy seller sells the 4210. Reason: 4210 is something very unusual set (I think we won't get a set similar to that in the next 20 years) and because of I don't like the petrol boat inside (no backwalls , nearly no interior ).

Paramedic Unit, does not seem to suit well for this set's name. It should be named as Clinic, Outpatient Treatment, Family Doctor and etc. From what I understand, Parmedic unit, is a stand-alone unit, that is on standby, 24/7, ready for any emergency rescue in LEGO Town. Ambulance, with a group of paramedics will be ideal for this kind of situation. I love female doctors, especially with that lovely hairpiece! The cruiser, is a neat 4-studs wide design. Just love these small car designs back then. I wonder what can be used at the back of its boot. The clinic is neat. Maybe, we can send Holodoc for some medical audit, to make sure that this clinic is up to standard. What surprised me the most, is the neat little eye chart. You don't see such details in any regular LEGO set. The red and white color combination for the building, works well for me. Most of the hospital buildings and vehicles, always revolved in red and white. I gave this a "4" Thanks you so much, Brickster!	positive
I just can't believe someone would rate this set a 1. It appears to be a trend among these classic reviews, never with a comment of why.	neutral
people giving this "1"? g... i'd give it a "4". i'd give it a "3" but added a point out of nostalgia... i think it's a nice town set from the old days. the only problem i always had is the lack of an ambulance... AND we got a female doctor! :-)	neutral
Brickster strikes again with another awesome review! Ah, one of the few hospital related kits lego made. Wasn't this the first hospital with modern minifigs? (because I seem to remember seeing an even older hospital online that had the armless, faceless figs). Regardless, this would be great as a little doctor's office in someone's town layout - although the vehicle is a little silly. And that eye chart sticker has to be the coolest decal EVER. Quote maybe a TFOL... Well, it sure isn't me. I personally love older kits, even though I'm only a teen. I like a lot of the newer sets a bit more than some of the classic stuff, but I have always agreed that the 70's and 80's were an extremely high point in lego's time (even though I don't really own any kits from the period) Edited by Grevious, 19 July 2008 - 05:05 PM.	positive
rriggs, on Jul 20 2008, 10:58 PM, said: The definition of a paramedic is "...someone who assists physicians in providing medical care..." I think in more modern times a paramedic is generally thought of as a more qualified and experienced ambulance technician but the dictionary definition would seem to fit with the Lego model quite well. rriggs, thanks for clearing it up. Actually, I did not check it with the dictionary. Thanks for giving a clear definition for "paramedic".	neutral
I like this set, like most i view it more as a clinic, it sits nicely in my town plan. These old sets are all very cool	positive
Hello all Eurobricks members and Town Lovers, Today, I will be doing up a review on Hook & Haul Wrecker. This name is quite wierd to me. I will prefer to call it the regular tow truck. This is one of the service and repair vehicle that are always ready 24/7 on stand-by for any emergency towing in our towns. Name: Hook & Haul Wrecker Theme: LEGO System / Town Year: 1989 Pieces: 44 Minifigs: 1 Price: USD$6.00 An image of a 6660, Hook & Haul Wrecker Let the towing begins Hook & Haul Wrecker is the typical 4-studs wide vehicle that takes care of broken vehicles that is left stranded on the roads. This tow truck is pretty useful. As you can see, current City sets hardly have any tow trucks available to tow new cars design. This tow truck is catered for 4-studs vehicles for Classic Town. Can you imagine yourself this truck towing a Speed Racer car? I think it looks really out of proportion. In addition, the mini-fig which is included in this set has the regular truck print on its torso. I am very sure they must be a fan club for "Trucks". Otherwise, they should really need a change of clothes. Nevertheless, in my honest opnion. I really love this torso very much. Somehow, it makes them look tough even though their face looks very friendly. Side View This vehicle has a combination of two primary colors which is white and red. This color combination looks very good. You cannot mistook it for an ambulance since they made use of this two colors too, in most Emergency vehicles. This is my guess, I supposed the designer will have tow truck concept as a form of emergency and considered red and white as its combinations. This vehicle set-up has the typical sun-screen on the top of the vehicle frame. However, this baby has more unique features installed in it. These are the source of its brutal strength All-Terrain Vehicle??? This tow truck equipped with the best wheels. In fact, these wheels offer suspension on the roads. Even when its travelling uphill, the truck will move accordingly with its tyres. When you act pressure on the top of the vehicle, it will either be shifted leftwards or rightwards. Close-up of these unique tyres Take a careful look. These wheels have springs installed in it. That is the magic of these vehicle and is defintely suited to run on any rough roads with least problems. If any EB Members know which other vehicles has this unique features, please highlight it to me. Because, if I remembered correctly. I only remember seeing this pair of tyres in this great set. He is ready for some serious towing. The driver had finished hook up the pizza van on its back. It's pretty simple. You just have to lift the back of the vehicle and placed it onto the hook. Presto, the van is ready to go. This vehicle provides so much fun. You can really tow any 4-studs vehicle in your town. And, here we go! To the service station. Poor pizza guy. Summary review Playability: 10/10 (Superb fun. You will love to use this truck and tow any vehicles) Design: 9.5/10 (Excellent design. Especially with the use of the suspension tyres) Price: 9/10 (An inexpensive set based on the 1989 pricing. This set is made up of less than 100 pieces) Overall: 9.5/10 (Every Town must need a tow truck. If a vehicle breaks down, whom will be ready to tow?) I gave it a "5" based on my Review Score Card. What about yours? Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed. Pictures can be found in My Brickshelf(When moderated)	neutral
This is one of my favorite town vehicles from the old time, and for one specific reason: The truck is on the guys shirt! It didn't matter that the color was wrong, or the hook was missing. I thought it was awesome beyond imagination... for some reason Thanks for the review Whitefang.	positive
i rate this a 5! one of my last sets before my dark age. suspension wheels are superb and are rare! the minifig, although smiling, really looks tough because of the tanktop. oh did i say im giving it a 5?	positive
Superb review of a great set!This is one of my favourite classic sets becouse of all these functions(engine,suspension)and it's great design with less than 100 pieces used( only 52 )!Congratulations for the review!I think that it's an outstanding set and surely worth 5 stars	positive

Again great topic/poll, TheBrickster! I gave this set a 3: Which is on the one hand negative is that it's really old-fashioned for today .

Wooha! I thought I never would see a nice Mars Mission set, but this Walker ist the best proof I was wrong. It really looks good and I love the bricks used to make the shape. The airtank is cool and for once I have to say even the stickers are looking good. Man, did I really say that? Normally I hate stickers.

I don't like Mars Mission sets but this one is just SPECTACULAR! It is beautiful! I must have this set, even if it means selling my kidney! I only have one Mars Mission set, the ETX Alien Mothership Assault, which is okay. But this set blows my mind! Two thumbs up!	positive
Nice review, good close-ups and a good, unconventional choice of a set. As for the set itself, it has it's pros and cons in my eyes. I like all the minifigs, but especially the witch. The Fright Knights are probably the closest you can get for an evil human Castle faction. As for the building itself, on the other hand I like the fact that it can be modified, but some of the design choices are just stupid. The holes in the wall, the one huge tower (as opposed to several smaller ones), the huge empty space in the center, and the excessive usage of bright yellow. I guess for a smaller kid the play value is great, it's easily accessible and it looks sturdy enough, but to an AFOL, it's not much else than a source for bricks and figs, in my opinion. Oh, and they did have telescopes in the medieval times (the witch most probably uses it for astrology). And even if they didn't, we're talking about a castle with a dragon and a wicked witch in it, so it's not exactly a good example of accurate history.	negative
I love the reviews of older sets that I never had. Also, tiny thing, but you said it has 7 minifigs, but the group shots only include 6. The last guy isn't shown until the very end.	neutral
I thoroughly enjoyed your review Metalandi, thank you especially for taking photos of all the contraptions and detailing exactly how they work. As a member of classic-castle, the census always seemed to be that fright knights were a class 4/10 or 6/10 but as Sandy stated above, it is one of the closest you can get to an evil faction. By today's standards, the contraptions seen here are much much more sophisticated and well thought out and are definitely missing in 2007's King's Castle Siege. I enjoy the design of this castle much more even if the towers are taller simply because the design in the King's Castle Siege left builders with an empty space right in the courtyard without even a base plate! AND it's nearly impossible to get your hands in and play in the enclosed space (why would anyone unless you're simply posing figs, and even that was difficult). This Castle instead, had a variety of trap doors and surprises, so despite the varied colors used here, it's not that hard to realize that the designers for this Castle really took time to think things out and tried to make the Castle enjoyable for the children that will play with it whereas our 2007 Castle was strictly built to give kids the impression of an enormous magnificant Castle with little to nothing inside. It's like comparing beauty (2007) to brains (this castle). Edited by legobear, 20 July 2008 - 01:32 AM.	positive
My first post in this topic looks foolish now that I bought this set from Ebay. I just really wanted the minifigs (although I already had the Batlord and the black dragon) and the parts. They will help me greatly in building the Impenetrable Fortress of the Dragonwarriors for my Princess Quest comic. By the end of this week, this set will be in my clutches!	positive
Well, that the bricks look new comes from that they ARE new. I got this set new and unopened	neutral
Good review - the photo from above shows off the scale of the castle much better than the box photo. I was one of those who always thought this set looked lame, ever since first seeing it in the catalogue. A couple of my siblings had smaller Bat Lord/Fright Knight sets and enjoyed the accessories and style of the minifigs etc. So last year having not only ended my dark ages, but done so for some of the rest of my family, I got this set off ebay for my sister for Christmas. I of course had to build it to make sure all parts were there before leaving ebay feedback and ending the transaction. First impressions were of how much brick there was to the set, as well as really useful large structural elements. And to be honest, while perhaps a bit childish, there's no doubt the style of the minifigs is kinda cute and useful for customs. It was really enjoyable building this set, and the scale is impressive when built, empty spaces notwithstanding (but hey, Lego has always had buildings with no back, etc. - just use your imagination and enjoy the access to playspace offered). The traps etc. are neat and more like the kind of "action features" modern sets come with (I for one am in favour of these, for kids they are fun and I think for builders they give ideas cause they are often done with minimal parts or impact on the set design). Anyways, needless to say my sister loved the set. Indeed she's currently rebuilding it for the second time. If I see it as cheap again, I will pick up one for myself. I got the first one at €30 incl postage I believe.	positive
Ahh... I remember how badly I wanted that set when it was new... oh well... Definitely one of the most original castles, if not THE most. I actually liked how the 1st floor was made into a throne room. The tower looks pretty impressive, too. Of course, the castle has a flagrant flaw -- the walls on the sides are open. I also think it lacks in the minifig count, though that is understandable for a castle with a dragon. Quote The Fright Knights are probably the closest you can get for an evil human Castle faction. Totally agreed.	positive
Quite the topic bump, but dang, what a cool set, and so tall. This is the kind of sets I had as a kid, but I don't remember this one. I'm jealous.s	positive
A 5/5. the set is beautiful, both the remake and the original. a classic and a beautiful thing, like DOS. Edited by maiq the liar, 20 July 2008 - 09:45 PM.	positive
I am a proud owner of this set this is one of the best fire stations ever. What amazes me is what the designers made with only 368 pieces. You get a very nice looking building in good size, a good baseplate, 2 cars, 4 minifigs, accessories... and great alternative ideas in the back of the box (like the fire boat or helicopter). This is a great example of Lego design.	positive

This pretty sums it up! The firestation was one of the few sets in my childhood I owned and was NOT classic space! I especially liked the roller doors, this was one of the first sets they came with. In the late 80´s I sold it to my nephew. Darn, I really regret it. When I asked him a couple of years ago if he still owned it (and I could buy it back) he also had made cash out of it.

I owned this set, and I loved it. Great idea to have the reversed windshield.	positive
thanks for another great review. I can remember the 6358 very vividly. My parents bought the 6340 for me and a girl friend got the 6358. I'm quiet sure it's my envy because until now I want to believe that the 6340 is better. My reasons were these: I own the 6340 (and on the instructions of the 6358 stood "LEGOLAND" which I thought of as old.) But this review induced me to get over this humiliation from my childhood ( ) and check ebay for the 6358. Edited by BerndDasBrot, 21 July 2008 - 04:07 PM.	neutral
What an awesome little set! I really like this engine but don't remember seeing it during the late 80s. It must have been out during my Dark Ages. I love the basket/section for the firemen. Equally nice is the fire hose which extends a good length. The color combination of red with white and the trans. blue windshield looks goos as well. This is a great engine and one that would look perfect in a classic tabletown - and it's 4-studs wide! Very nice review WhiteFang. I look forward to seeing more of your Classic Town reviews.	positive
Nice reveiw it looks like a great set i think i know what i will do tonight- rebuild my LEGO fire department it has- [Fire pickup truck, fire truck [from 2005 sorry cant remember set number] and the most recent fire station if i can find all the pieces......	neutral
Nice review, WhiteFang, with lots of photos - exactly as a good review should be! As for the set - I own it and it's a very good one! The Fire Squad vehicle is a nice addition to my other Fire dept. vehicles. It offers very good playability and this ladder is so long! You can have so much fun with it.	neutral
Great set. I found only one major fail - this - the hands of robot arms gets easly broken.	positive
Thanks for the review. This set was outstanding for its time with all the features and detail. The extending basket is just wonderful. However, I honestly wouldn't consider it the best firetruck ever. I actually like the one from 2005 even better - becasue like most of the City vehicles, it adds the needed bulk big engines like fire trucks need. Many of the older kits, while awesome, were honestly a little too skinny IMO.	positive
Guys, thanks for all your great comments! Nikola Bathory, on Jul 22 2008, 06:57 PM, said: It offers very good playability and this ladder is so long! You can have so much fun with it. Yes, the "extended length" of the ladder provides great playability! Klaus-Dieter, on Jul 25 2008, 03:01 AM, said: I like it much more than the new one from 2007 since it's not that big and juniorized. Thanks K.D. I owned the 2007 Fire Engine as well, as this set was not restored back then, and I needed a Fire Engine very badly. I managed to restored it somehow, and I compared it with the 2007. The older design is still the best. osakana, on Jul 25 2008, 04:03 AM, said: Great set. I found only one major fail - this - the hands of robot arms gets easly broken. Yes, this is an interesting finding. I remembered when I was a child. That robot arms always come out of its own, when I fiddle with it. I was so annoyed by it and I just kept it there whenever I deployed it for rescue missions. Grevious, on Jul 26 2008, 02:00 AM, said: However, I honestly wouldn't consider it the best firetruck ever.

I agreed with you, that Fire Engines need to be big and sturdy. On the other hand, it can be nice to have the fire engine to look slim as well, to cut through the traffic easily. I am not against with the newer sets. It just that, part of the reasons which reflected in the review had fufill the basic key factors of a typical Fire Engine. In addition, it was my all-time favourite under the "Fire-Fighting" theme.	positive

Nice pictures, but three questions: 1. How many pages do the instruction books have? 2. What are the spare parts? Or: Does this Laaty come with two Clone-Commander-equipment sets and four Assaij Ventress lightsaberhilts? 3. Where did you get it? 4. How much did it cost?	neutral
It looks like a really good set and like it is a lot larger than the old one. Thanks for the review!	positive
This sounds very similar to the first one. I'm glad I'm saving this one till later in my purchasing cycle. All the SW walkers have a skeletal fram with almost nothing inside. It's very disappointing, but I guess filling them in would up the piece count considerably. Does this beast have any good handholds for picking it up? I seem to recall a handle or something coming out of the top in the pre-release pics.	negative
So basically, you cited as faults what everybody had been complaining about since the first information of the set arrived? Skeletal interior and lack of clones? Although I didn't realize it didn't have numbered backs. That really is just ridiculous. LEGO finally comes up with a very intelligent solution to the frustration seen when building large sets, but then they neglect to implement it. WTF? Lame. Still, this may be the only Clone Wars set I buy besides the exclusives. The exterior, which IMO is the only part that matters, looks so fantastic. I don't care about clones, I have enough of those already. And at 90$ it's still a better buy than the RGS. The Torrent is cool but not as cool as the Fighter Tank or DGS imo. Awesome in-construction pics.	positive
Just picked this set up, and just took a break from building to go to Football Practice. I have just finished building all of the legs, and so far it looks like it is going to be a great set. I would have like it if more clones were included, but whatever. I find it interesting how many clone accessories they give you. I don't like it only because I can't decide what I want to use. I find it interesting that at lease 2 people are missing pieces. I have had multiple times where I thought I was missing pieces, only to find that they were in the bag somewhere. Other than the fact that there is a lack of minifigures, I love this set and can't wait to finish it later tonight. Edited by SWMAN, 04 August 2008 - 08:33 PM.	positive

Sorry for reanimating this topic. There is a Technic brick in the mid section of this set. Does anyone know the function of that ??	neutral
cagri, on Mar 11 2009, 12:03 AM, said: Exactly Kim, that's what I meant. I pondered and wondered that for a long time :) I decided to ask here when a friend wondered the same thing. I hope it fits with the new droship. It would be really cool. And it's also great that TLG knows what they'll be prodcuing a year later.. It does. The description of the new 10195 Dropship and AT-OT states that the AT-TE can be carried too. They've planned this for quite a while.	positive
7676: Republic Attack Gunship Number of Pieces: 1034 Number of Minifigs: 5 Price: 119.99 USD Brickset Hey everyone, I just got the RGS yesterday at TRU after I came home from camp. I saw all of the topics that I missed, and noticed a mini-review and a review with one pic, so I thought I'd make a huge, shiny new review that has lots of pictures and all of the requirements of KimT's index. NOTE: I did not apply any stickers to it, as a personal liking. So, lets start by looking at the box: A shiny, clean, and futuristic box, quite different from the other Star Wars box designs before this. There was so much Clone Wars merchandise with this font and design in the huge display at the front of my local Toys r Us store, and not just LEGO. It so beautiful, with the white and sky blue... anyways, for some reason, the boxes of the new Clone Wars sets seemed more shiny than usual. Maybe it's because they were just shipped, but once you pick up the boxes, they will feel really good in your hands, despite the fact that only about half of the space in the boxes are used... The back of the box: The back shows all of the main features of the set, plus pictures of the three other Clone Wars sets meant to be released alongside this one (although I did spot the Twilight and Homing Spider Droid, which were supposed to be released in September or October). So, on to the Gunship: Built straight from the bags. It took me about 4 1/2 hours, with breaks. It has an overall great design, but somewhat fragile, especially when building it. The cockpits always fall apart when opened, as well as the bubbles on the wings (which I will get into more later). The color scheme is very well done. You can always find the piece you're looking for thanks to the color diversity: Red, Dark Red, Lime Green (ooh!), Blue, Black, Tan, Light Bley, Dark Grey, Yellow and White. Also, split down the middle vertically, the ship is almost all symmetrical. Front: Side: Now, lets start with the many features that this set is hiding. The front has lots of lime green, a rare color. But more importantly: ...a rotating gun is found on each side. They rotate in a pretty wide range, although fragile. Cockpits: There are two main cockpits, right next to each other. Not very detailed, and are the same. And for some reason, the whole cockpit element flips up to reveal: ...nothing. Just the skeleton of the ship. Probe droid storage: Above the cockpit lies a plate that can be flipped up to reveal a storage area that holds: Two of these probe droids. At least, that's what I think they are. Hull: In this pic, two features are hidden. Mobile Command Center: The first of the two is a Mobile Command Center, but essentially just a hover chair. It is found by flipping up the two panels on either side of the hull. Bacta Tank: The second is the bacta tank found by just sliding it out of the storage area behind the MCC. One half of the tank opens: ...so a minifigure can go inside and heal his/her wounds obtained in battle. Cargo hold: Now, this is probably the main feature for this set. The two sliding doors (two on each side) slide open thanks to a clever Technic mechanism. Not much in here, just a gun holder and a place where the passengers wait to be dropped off in battle. Speeder Bike: I guess you guys saw it, the speeder bike. It is found by opening the rear flap. The bike is very cleverly designed by using a brown trike body. It's only a few centimeters shorter than the bike found in the Clone Battle Pack. Rear gun: Just a gun similar to the front ones. Engines: Huge engines (or are they cannons?) that are really fun to build. They really give that cartoon feel to this set. Missiles: In between the engines are two sets of four flick-fire missiles. Bubble cockpits: There is one bubble cockpit on each wing that supposedly control the turrets at the front. Very fragile. Storage containers: Two storage containers on each side hold the clone accessories. But, I wouldn't recommend putting them in there, because the antennae can fall out, or you might forget about them. Sticker Sheet: The Dreaded Sticker Sheet (DSS) has all of the stickers you need for this set. Unfortunately, mine was crunched up. I don't like stickers much anyways, but I might still apply some. Note the Republic symbol stickers, why couldn't TLG just use that printed piece from a few years back? Also, you get to choose between a bird-rat thing or a sleeping Twi'elk as your hull decal. What they're for, I don't know, looks like the movie or show will explain it though. Minifigs: Finally, the five minifigs of this set. They are all great figs, including: Commander Cody: Amazing, especially with the gear. The orange is nice, but I thought he was yellow. Clone Trooper: Again, amazing. The gear is great, and the new helmet and torso are great! All of the clones in the Clone Wars line have the same heads. Also, you can see the flesh beneath the helmet. Asaaj Ventress: Not so happy about this one. The torso and dark blue legs are cool, but the dress is pretty ugly. The head is alright, but could do without the cartoon-y face (yeah I know, its from a cartoon). Also has purple markings on back of head. Obi-Wan Kenobi: Pretty cool, besides the face. Cool hair and torso, though. Plo Koon: Beautiful! The true gem of this set, in my opinion. The head is the same material as Kit Fisto's. And the tosro is awesome, good for making a custom Ki-Adi Mundi. Well, that's about it, here is the... FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, very fun and easy, should take the seasoned builder about 4 hours. Somewhat fragile. Playability: 9.5/10, Lots of fun features, although some can break easily. Swooshability: 3/10, I wouldn't recommend flying it around much, as you can barely pick it up safely. But with two hands gripping the bottom firmly, it can be moved around, but not spun or swooshed, etc. Minifigs: 8/10, all very great figs, especially Plo Koon, but could have included more clone troopers. Design: 7.5/10, some excellent ideas included in here, although some spots are very fragile. Price: 7/10: Should have been only 100 USD if not for the new molds. Plus, at TRU, it was 130 USD. Overall score: 8.5/10, a great set to have for your star wars/ clone wars collection, with some flaws. Save up for this one. So, how did you like my review? Your feedback is much appreciated!

I really like the new Gunship. Different enough from the old one to be better, but similar enough that they don't look totally weird together. Really like the new minifigs. Didn't think I would like the new Clone Troopers at all. The accessories are fine. I would never use them on the regular clones, but to each their own.	positive

JimButcher, finally I had seen something that is worth reading and viewing. IMHO, this is your best Star Wars Review I had ever read. Most importantly, it is a complete review which has substance. You have my thanks! Keep up the good job Back to the RGS, this is the next Star Wars set I will be getting. I can't wait to lay my hands on this set, and start building. Basically, how bad this set can be, it can't be worse. Republic Gunship is one of the all-time favourites, in Star Wars Prequel and OT. I can't find any faults, except being too expensive due to the licence cost. In addition, the mini-figs are the next big thing. Seriously, I am quite impressed with it. On the down side, my rating will go up if there is an additional Clone Trooper instead of one. Nevertheless, this is a "MUST GET" set, no matter what!	positive

Hey everyone, My wife took me to Legoland for my birthday just last week. We had a fantastic time and it gave me the chance to pick up some of the new Castle sets and battlepacks I was really impressed by the sets I bought and decided to do my first review... let battle commence! Set name: Tower Raid Set number: 7037 Price GBP: £19.99 Pieces: 364 The Models Here's a shot of the complete set: The set is made up of two models, the Crown Knight's tower and the Orc's siege tower. Let's start with the Crown Knight's tower: A knight readies himself for battle! My favourite model from the set, the wicked Orc's siege tower: Please note that for the purposes of display I mounted the Orc's banner onto a small cone set on the top platform of the siege tower. This doesn't come with the set but saves any Orcs having to hold onto it all he time! There are other areas it can be placed without using extra parts. Features Both models look great and have excellent features. The set as a whole has great playability and seems to have been concieved with a storyline: the Crown Knight's have a captured Orc within the walls of their tower so the Orc army has been sent out to recover him... or are they merely after the gold the knights keep horded away?! The Orc's siege tower has a powerful ram - spring-loaded by the simple arrangement of an elastic band - so pulling it back sends it flying out the front, knocking down the wall on the side of the knight's tower... ...and releasing the captive Orc! The floor panels inside the prison are laid over a lip on the inside of the collapsible wall, so fall in when they're not supported. There's a string at the rear for extending the boarding ramp... ...and letting a fearsome Orc warrior charge across! Flick-fire action! The battle heats up as the Orcs close in! The Minifigures The Crown Knights: I really like the Crown Knights. They're metallic helmets look great and they come with nice accessories. The archer has a double printed head with a frightened look on the other side too! I'm not surprised, I'd be frightened when staring over the ramparts at these... The Orcs: These guys really do look the part, worthy advesaries to the Crown Knights! The details are superb: the printed elements, weapons and helmets, all set the Orcs aside on the battlefield. The set comes with a great new molded armour neckpiece too. The mighty Orc leader looks wicked in his full battlegear! Overview There's so much to this set it's hard not to be impressed. The Orc's siege engine is a thing of beauty (or terror!) and would look great on any battlefield. The Crown Knight's tower although basic, looks good and has great playability. I'm a big fan of the new Castle knights and fantasy minifigures and the inclusion of five of them is just enough for this set and as a booster to any army. At £19.99 in the UK this set is well worth the money for content and quality. I'd highly recommmend this set as a must-have purchase for anyone A final shot of the siege tower with a host of Orcs ready for battle: I hope you enjoyed my review, I'll be posting my next one for 7040 Dwarves Mine Defender soon!	positive
I Scream Clone, on Jul 29 2008, 04:42 PM, said: Very nice review Pedro! You beat me to it. There was a review done about January, but i wanted to have a go, just haven't opened the box yet..... Great pics and well demonstrated action elements too. I rate this as one of the coolest Castle sets just for its playability and 5 figures. This will def add to my Orc army, and i may purchase more of this set if they dont release a Orc BP. Keep up the good work! For now, there is the Impulse set... Great review and excellent photography, I love this set, as it has many good features and the Siege tower is the best TLC one yet! Thanks again!	positive
I have one of these and must say that this is THE best Castle set in the theme, and the most useful parts pack for its size yet.	positive

Good review. This is my second IJ kit that I got and I think it is a great deal. Only 10$ and get 3 figs and great parts to use. I may pick up 2 more so I have penty of ants and other goodies that this comes with.	positive
I picked this up last weekend, mainly also for parts. It came with two Mutt heads instead of a Irena Head. :( But anyway, it's a nice little $10 set...We need more sets like this that include these myriads of "detail" parts.	positive
Time for my first review! 7673 MagnaGuard Starfighter Peices: 431 # of figs: 2 Price: 44.99 USD THE BOX: Pretty decent size box for the price. MagnaGuards: The Normal Box Stuff: Front of the ship: Back: Open Cockpit: Back of the Box: Contents: DSS (dreaded sticker sheet): First Manual Page (because it's super important not to build on carpet. ) Fig Build: The Magna Guard Head: (IMO it's beautiful! ) The Purple Cone! Cape Box: The Capes!: Just One: The MagnaGuard: Back: The Parts (nicely sorted!) The new Windshield Piece (Beautiful!) The First Step: Seccond Step: More Steps Of The Main Body: The Wing Assembly: (Sorry for the blur) Attached: Opposite Wing: Both Attached: Rear Engine Build: The Staffs. I have mine set up differently than in the instructions. I put one cone over the hump on one end of the staff, and the other in the original spot. Then, to load them onto the fighter, all you do is push the original placed cone down and put it right in. This way, the staff looks better and it works the same! See? It slides right in: Skeletal parts of sides attached: Close Up: Bottom: Both Wings Attached: Hidden Missle Launcher: Raised Up: Another Shot: Staffs Attached: Complete: Side Panel: Side Pods: Complete: Swooshable!: Finished!: Time to complete: >2hrs. Okay, Overall rating time! PRICE: 9/10- Could have been 40.00 USD, but due to new molds, this is understandable. PARTS: 9/10- Could have hade more Dark Red, but thats IMO. Plus, I love Dark Red! BUILD TIME: 8/10- I took my time on this and enjoyed the techniques the designers intricated. Also, taking pics added to the time quite a bit. PLAYABILITY: 7/10- The main playability functions are the missle launchers in the back and the sliding cockpit. My only gripe with these is they don't set right with the other slopes on the top. Also, the inside of the cockpit is easily modded for regular size minifigs. Just pop a handlebar piece in the already provided arm in the cockpit and bam, your favorite figs can have a ride! It also helps keep the Magnaguards in place if they hold it. MINIFIGS: 10/10- IMO, the new molds are great! The only downfall is the right arm on both is less moveable due to the hard plastic turban-thing connected to the head. SWOOSHABILITY: 9/10- The starfighter is pretty sleek, and very swooshable! DESIGN: 9/10- The most important aspect, and this one's a winner! It's only a nine because it needs to have smoother edges in a few spots, but they are easily MODable. OVERALL SCORE: 8.7! I think it's an awesome set. Very satisfying! 2008 SW ON! DSR DSR Edited by KimT, 04 August 2008 - 11:49 AM. indexed	positive

Hmm. A tougie. I really like the World City one, yet the Dino one is a better deal. I'll vote for the Dino, because I (regretably) don't even have the World City one...	positive
It's definately the Street Sprinter for me! There are many reasons for that, most of which have been mentioned by others already: I hate yellow, it's the most useless color, but I love tan and dark red. It's bigger and more detailed than the Coast guard one. Plus, I think there is a hinge in the back of it, so there is apparently some more playability to it as well. I love the post-apoc style fig! It's detailed and simply looks cool! Also, while the Digger fig has quite an individual look to it, the Coast Guard driver has the generic hero head and Coast Guard uniform. It's an overal better deal, especially if you count the LUDP which gives the set a whole lot more playability, no matter how U the LDP may be. Tan & post-apoc figs ON!	positive
I vote for the Dino quadbike, definately! I wish I had that but I'll have to make do with the much less violent European Version (Dino '2010' not 'ATTACK') Here's a comaprison... European Version: USA etc. version: There's a subtle difference, but I prefer the US one As for the Coast Guard Quad, I think it's OK but not as good as the new one.	positive
Dino Attack quad for me. No, this isn't because I own it and not the other one, but because I think just about everything is better in it - the design is better, the colors are cooler, and it has a better figure. I don't like the figure in the coast guard quad at all - but since it was from World City, I'm not suprised. I also kinda like the dino, actually. It's flexible and fits in with the previous dinos a lot better than the cruddy bigger ones with bright red, yellow, and green highlights.	positive
Dovchenko, on Aug 1 2008, 07:47 PM, said: Finally a review of this, thanks! 120 bucks? This tank looks tiny and though it's amazingly detailed it should have been smaller and only 40/50 bucks at most. It just doesn't play that big a part man. Good pieces and mechanisms but no one's going to both buying a 120 buck tank, no offence, not unless it it's the AT-TE. $120 is the price here in Denmark. It will most likely be the same price as the V-19 Torrent everywhere else, so you dont have to worry about that	neutral
This and the AT-TE and the Spider tank and maybe the droid gunship are the few Clone wars sets I'll buy. I loved playing as this tank in the Clone wars video game( even better with cheat codes for EXTRA MISSILE SPAM ), so this is a must get.	positive
Christian, thanks for this outstanding review! I have been waiting for this moment for someone to do up an excellent review like this. Republic Fighter Tank is my 2nd favourite set, in my Clone Wars list. The 2 Clone Troopers could be easily add up to your RGS, since it offer only more trooper. However, I felt that this set is quite overpriced. In fact, all Clone War sets are very expensive. The Fighter Tank, has a very great color combination of red and white to represent the Republic. The wheels below is the most impressive feature, which enable the hovering feel. The hatch is a neat feature as well. However, I noticed there is a rubber band within the control panel. May I know what is it for? I really enjoy viewing this review. You had given the insight which will eventually determined whether to get it any sooner or later. pr0visorak, on Aug 2 2008, 05:35 PM, said: This set costs a S$100 in singapore.I went to Hng Kong too see lego and the shops there are more expensive by a few dollars.However,I went to Australia before and everything there is the same price but when there is a sale it becomes very cheap! Hello pr0visorak. You are from Singapore as well. Welcome to Eurobricks! I hope you will do an introduction to the rest of the members in this forum. In Singapore, it cost SGD$100.00 In fact, that was the promotional price. Therefore, there is no further discount for it.	positive
Im definatly gonna get the ATTE. Im thinking about getting the spider droid and fighter tank. I alredy own the older version of the republic gunship (but i still want it) AgentRick57, on Aug 1 2008, 08:44 PM, said: I loved playing as this tank in the Clone wars video game( even better with cheat codes for EXTRA MISSILE SPAM ) sorry to get off topic... But i own that game! I liked playing as the republic gunship the best!	positive
I wish they made more sets with those colored Droids as well. We should have got them with the Hailfire droid and Dwarf spider set I think. I also just noticed look the ball turret on the manual there's no markings on it.	neutral
Nice review. Sadly my dark ages came right before this set was released.	neutral
Thanks for the review. I love these affordable little sets. Not so affordable now because of the cool figs but i'm going to have a look on eBay and bricklink right now just in case! An army of tan red droids would look great. Maybe we'll see some if Geonosia appears in the new seires somehow unlikely since the Confederacy was defeated at the Battle of Geonosis. I wish I could have bought this set when it came out but i'd just left university so I was super skint and had to miss all the Ep.II sets now they all cost loads even in used condition. At least now there has been a re-design of the gunship and AT-TE from the Clone Wars series that I can buy.	neutral
~VBBN~ the pics were 12 mega pixles which is quite a lot I think, although I had to scale them down to 800x600. I used to dream that TLG would bring out these sets of the Geonosis arena and you could join them together to make a massive arena but I doubt they would ever do that. Also look out for my forth coming reviews of 4500 Snow speeder, Some TIE fighter with a LUL DV, and GG wheel bike chase. I have taken all the pics all I need to do is upload them. Also I would review the Jango Fett's Slave 1 but I have customized it so much I don't really want to revert it back to it's original state. Edited by Skipper 24, 02 August 2008 - 07:18 PM.	neutral
Thanks for the review Skipper. This is one of my favourite sets. I really like the colour scheme and the Geonosians are awesome. Keep up the good work KimT	positive

Knowing lego they'll release a huge arena playset with a few geos and sand red droids so people will buy the set just for them. jifel That would be a great release, but I doubt it. KimT	negative
Thanks for the review. I actually like the older Tie better, since it had a stand for the Tie. Not really a fan of the LU figs either. No matter - a Tie is a Tie and this is a must have fighter for any LEGO SW fan out there. Never can get enough Ties, except the Tie Advanced or Vader's Tie...they don't rock... KimT	positive
And now for something completely different: Tiny Turbos belonging to the racers line! When I saw 8147 bullet run on S@H for half the price I couldn´t resist buying it. We had a lot of fun celebrating a bag-build at our event using the 8150 ZX Turbo of that theme so I knew what would expect me with this "extended" set. Price: normal 49,99€ now 24,99€ (well I paid 34,99€ in a Lego store but that´s another story...) Bricks: 796 Minifigs: - Hey, this is tiny turbos, stupid! Stickers: Don´t ask (or read further) The open box reveals seven polybags, some with more smaller polybags inside, the instruction booklet, 2 ramps and the sticker sheet. Of course I put all of the bags on the table and not on the floor Hey, TLC didn´t print this on the first page of the building instructions! And you won´t see any piece callouts as well. On the other hand this is not adifficult build, so why show them? Still there is an inventory list of all bricks at the end of the instructions. Note the giant sticker sheet! We all now the DSS, but that is a new kind of extra super large sticker sheet. It holds 82 stickers! More to that later on. The build is quite basic. The only non-conventional parts of the build were the two slammers. And the most annoying part was fiddling the rubber band of the holder without destroying it. Bag 1: Easy beginning: Building the lime car, the limo and the two slammers. Nothing exciting about the lime car, but the limo was neat. It´s an 18 studs long car! The normal racers are abot 10 studs long. Nice way to put the horns on the back! The slammers. Mmmmh. Nice invention if they would actually DO something. They are supposed to give the Tubros a kick in the butt to speed them up, but the result is a 80 cm long "run" and that´s it. I had expected more acceleration from the slammers. But it´s also fun to play with the cars without slamming them. Bag 2: Convoy time: The tow truck and the fuel truck The tow truck is a great idea and a good addition to the set. The cars are supposed to crash - how do they get back home? Well, here´s the answer. Quite american layout of the truck and it´s very well done: Horns, 5 flashing lights and a right color choice. You can move the arm up and down and pull out the hook. Note the metallic silver antennae. The fuel tank has got a "secret" function. It may break on the middle of the trailer. Therefore it has a hinge build in the bottom. City fire mayhem! And there´s no fire engine... Bag 3: Long, longer, how long can a "tiny" truck be? The pipe truck, an unexpected buggy and the red racer. 36+ studs long: The pipe truck breaks every convention. The cabin is almost the same like the tow truck and the fuel truck and that is the good part of it. The trailer has to carry pipes and is functional as well as it can commute sidewarts. It looks quite unrealistic as well and you cannot drive this beast on tiny roads. Good for another crash. But there are more cars in this bag. Now this was a surprise: A buggy? This is the only 6(+)-wide car, but just because the wheels are large. Monster truck madness? I don´t care for those cars. Personally a disappointment, I would have preferred another racer. + for variety though. Did I say another racer? Here we are: The red devil. Great looking, a real fast shape and red. The best racer in this set. Vrooommm! This is the most "played with" car of the set. (Not only from me ). As you may have noticed I didn´t put any stickers so far. I don´t like stickers especially when placed over two or more bricks! And here you are supposed to do it several times. Of course the cars look better with stickers on, but they are also great without stickers. Only the fuel truck looks boring without. My sons didn´t know there were supposed to be stickers and they didn´t ask for them. So everything is allright! Here´s a closeup of the sticker sheet (did I already mention it was 82 stickers? ): The only exception I made using sticker was for bag 4: Bag 4: You go here? You pay! The highway toll booth. The only immobile part of the set, but great to brake though the barriers. That is fun! I only put on stickers on 2x2 plates where I had the idea to use those plates further on on different other MOCs. This looks a bit boring without the other stickers I admit. But still no cut off to the playability! There are also two ramps belonging to the set. These only make sense if you are able to speed up the racers with the slammers and hit the ramps correctly. I had problems with that, so they are on the shelves now... Could be a lot fun making a contest though. Like this (picture of the inventories frontpage) All cars put together: The usual leftovers: All in all this is a great set to call ones own! I did not regret buying it, especially when it was 50% off! Even normal price would not have been too much. Build: Great for smaller children, boring to AFOLs: 5/10 Special bricks/colors: None, all basics: 3/10 Design: I love the tiny turbos´ size and design: 9/10 Playability: -1 because of the slammers, another -1 because no minifig-scale. But that is not the intention of the set: still 9/10 Price/piece ratio: Dang! It´s not on sale any more. But if you hurry you could still grab one in the Lego stores. 10/10 All in all: 8.5/10 and a clear recommendation! It was and still is a set to play with your children. The size fits perfectly to Matchbox cars and that was exactly what my younger son did: Can you find all of the cars included in the set? P.S.: After buying this set I won an ebay auction with another tiny turbos set - 8135 bridge chase. This is even more fun! I will soon care for a review with some never seen photo-tricks as well. Stay tuned! Edited by WhiteFang, 23 May 2009 - 07:02 PM. Indexed	neutral
Thanks for the review! I have quite a few TTs.(tiny turbos). I never got this one, but if it's on sale....	positive
Looks like a pretty good set with a some nice colors. The spider is probably the best model in my opinion, but I mean look at the wasp kinda weak it you ask me. Nice review .	positive
Thanks for the review, Kim! KimT, on Aug 3 2008, 01:01 PM, said: I crossed the German border and bought me this one mainly for the parts. What parts were you looking for? Or just for ALL of the parts? I like the story with your wife. The spider is really cool. Nice photo shots on the grass, Kim! Too bad the other alternative builds are kinda odd. Always CREATORS ON!	positive
There isn't much difference apart form it has stickers on and is grey. Also the guns and tow cable gun are different as well as the engines. But if you look at pictures of the Hoth base speeder not to much is noticeable.	neutral
I have mixed feelings about this set. It's one of the sets that sent my into a dark age (the birth of my son contributed heavily). When I first saw this set I was convinced that the earlier Snowspeeder (7130) was superior in every way. I liked the look of the 7130 version better, I liked the coloration of it better. The turret was better (it used a webbed 6 x 6 dish). After seeing this review, I realize I was wrong on some accounts. The cockpit is much more movie accurate. The 7130 version had two separate compartments. This version also came with a tow cable, something that was lacking from the previous set. While I still am unimpressed with the overall look of this set, it is much less blocky, which is always a good thing. Overall, I still prefer 7130 to the 4500 version. But the 4500 isn't nearly as bad as I first assumed, and I regret never buying one of these when I had my chance.	neutral
Podracer not sure where you got that from (I didn't have them out)? The set with treads is a Dino 2010 thing which fits in well after a bit of modding. Also there are some of the old EXO-Force sets out there like the Fire Vulture because I always saw them fitting well with Star Wars.	neutral
KimT, on Sep 11 2008, 08:29 PM, said: No they didn't. Read this. You'll find the answer close the end of the article. Oh, nevermind. Thanks!	neutral
You have to love the originals, well I didn't like the very first snowspeeder so this is the original to me. I like it more then the new one that comes with the Echo Base, beter color scheme and more realistic i think. I got this set in stores and still love it to this day =]	positive
Good review, I like it a lot. Nice Job	positive
7255 General Greivous Wheel Bike chase review Parts: 111 Figs: 2 Price: £10.00 The first set to include GG. 1. General set and Minifigs (not manual because I don't have it) The contents of the box after being built. Both minifigs. The set includes 5 Lightsabers! My own design GG. GG's cape on the outside. GG's cape on the inside. 2. The Wheel bike Front view standing on legs. Side view. GG can't hold the controls because of his arms. Roller mode. The legs are a bit to chunky so to roll it has to be tilted forward. 3. Boga The lizard. Grey tip to the tail. The front back and saddle split in to three sections. 4. Overall Build: 4/10 There isn't really much to build. Minifigs: 9/10 It comes with GG with the special cape and Obi-Wan in ROTS gear which is hard to find I think. Design: 5/10 Not really to scale but otherwise okay apart from Boga which just looks like any old dinosaur. Also the controls on the Wheel bike aren't really right. Parts: 6/10 Comes with some Dark Green bricks and lots of rods ( the guns on the wheel bike) the Boga feet are also nice. Price: 8/10 £10 for 2 figs isn't bad it could have a few more parts though. Playability: 10/10 You can easily recreate the movie scenes with this set. Overall 7/10 It would be better if the bike and Boga were more to scale and more accurate as well as the set having more parts.	neutral
Not one of my favourite SW sets. Kinda boring and the set is poorly designed IMHO. We do get the general, but that's not nearly enough. Thanks for the reivew and fine pics. KimT	negative

Okay I have fixed that pic (thanks Oky wan). I have modified this but then yesterday I built it back to its original state to review it.	neutral
you added some decals to the Jango figure, right ? They seem to be suffering a little. I remember buying this set from the discount tent after my first visit to Legoland Windsor. I wasn't sure whether to buy it, even in their sale ... but I was glad I did once I'd built it :)	neutral
Yep those decals are suffering. I am going to apply some new ones now with proper paper.	neutral
This set looks liek a good buy for $4. Wish it was still around, but Like you said, it needs accessories.	positive
This little set really makes my point small playable inspiration to build the set into a few other models, Great set I wish I had it my town is going to need more vehicles. I really miss main model instructions with alternate build idea's.	neutral
Nein! You rejected LUL. LUL's are awesome! Thanks for the review! I like the set a lot, Mace is only featured here. Great fig of him too, I like the grey Jedi Robes torso. Cody is great as with the other figs. The tank's probably a second favourite, next to the mighty AT-AT of course.	positive
I hate how the original release had the light-up Windu, which was really lame, and one less clone trooper. I bought it when it first came out, so missed out on a good Windu and another clone trooper.	neutral
Did your version without the LUL mace have trans blue grill things (like the ones on the back of the speeder) ? Or was my set a one off.	neutral
I got the original version of this set with the LULS Mace Windu figure. When TLC released the non-LULS version I managed to swap - they sent me the new version (and a Clone Trooper IIRC) and I mailed them back the old version. This was a great set; the suspension worked great and it rolled magnificently. Nice review with good photos, but again your price is a little off: £69.99 is the RRP (unless the price you paid was £80). TK	positive
6701 Space Minifigures Review Set#: 6701 Set Name: Space Minifigures Released: 1983 Pieces: 36 (including minifigs) Minifigs: 6 Brickshelf Gallery Peeron.com Bricklink Brickset.com Introcomment: As I reignited my love for Classic Space a few years ago, I decided to start hunting sets I didn't have. This small one fell into my lap very cheap. With box and minifigs in great condition. So now I've resized the pics and done the review. And NO I am NOT envious of this forum...really...I'm not.... The Box. The box is pretty neat. It has a very comfortable size (compared to modern boxes) and the back of it shows what you get. I like the way they (TLG) split the minifigs and arranged everything neatly. Front: Rear Sadly the box has seen better days. But it's age taken into consideration, I think it's just fine. The figs: A fine collection of red, white and yellow space figs. Some great accesories to go as well. Not much more to say, except this was a great "army-builder"-set. A true must have for most Classic Space fans. The verdict: It's kinda hard rating this set, since it's a minifig supplemental set. No design or colourscheme to comment on. It has a lot of playability since figs will always come in handy when building/playing with your Space sets. KimT	positive
Thanks for the review KimT. I gave this "Above Average". I believe I had this one, but it was so long ago... I'm still a bit freaked out by the yellow ones! When I emerged from my Dark Ages I kept thinking "gee, I miss the people packs", but now that I have over 500 mini-figures I don't feel that way anymore. Even so, I wish they would re-release some of the classic old ones.	neutral

Erhm... Where's the review? It would be nice to have a few pics of the V-19 itself and a few comments on it. Could You please add that? KimT	neutral
Nice review Simon Jedi. The V-19 has been one of my favourite ships since the release of CWA and this is one of the sets I've been considering most about buying. It's great to see TLG's treatment of it. It looks like no expense was spared making it as aesthetically and functionally accurate as possible - though I think the cockpit windshield could maybe have been slightly bigger, but that's just me I'm sure. It looks pretty big compared to other starfighters too. Did it take a long time to build?	positive
the ability for it to fold in and out of attack position has wowed me. This is my top priority now. Thanks for making up my mind.	positive
In addition to my last comment am I correct in saying that the left over yellow technic part was merely to hold parts together while building? Edited by Skipper 24, 10 October 2008 - 09:10 PM.	negative

Having just bought myself a copy of the wonderful metroliner (4558) I felt like doing a review. Before we start I'd like to thank Greenhair for selling me one of his metroliners for a mere 80 euros. Granted, the motor, "trainstation" and tracks weren't included but I did get an extra railcar instead. - * (please note that I have included the fourth wagon in the final pic but that the official set includes just three wagons.) The metroliner was released in 1992 and was extremely popular amongst lego fans. The set A picture of the box showing the set completely. (pic taken from peeron) and one of the minifigs and the accessories.: As you may notice, TLC was extremely generous, supplying us with a grand total of 11 minifgs amongst which no less than 4 female minifigs. Ah, the population crisis is finally over We also have three suitcases, three cups and a small freight parcel and freight handling thingy. Normally this would include two bicycles; a red and a black one. A general side view of the three carriages. (thanks to Greenhair and the Brickster) And here's one of the extra carriage. (thanks to Greenhair and the Brickster) Moving onto the front and back carriage, which are externally identical. Please note that Greenhair changed my back carriage's headlights. These would be yellow in the normal set. All the doors in the entire set are printed pieces. (sorry for the bad picture quality in this one) The interior of the two however is laid out a bit differently. The space in the front carriage is occupied by a cockpit (or whatever it is called in trains) and some space to store your cable connecting the front lights with the engine. I can imagine it must get quite cramped and dangerous for the minifig driver with all the cabling. Further back we have a quite random, weird looking engine. One part reminded me rather of a jet engine on a commercial airplane. The engine is accessible by means of the two side cargo doors. At the end of our first carriage we hit what looks like the train's restaurant, two tables and no chairs. The two middle carriages are identical, both have a small sink nicely hidden from the intervening and impolite looks of fellow passengers. The carriage further contains two tables and four seats. Two cargo spaces are nicely tucked away from view below the tables. Our final carriage has a back cockpit as well but differs from the front carriage in the central cargo area - where our train employee is hard at work earning his lego nickels - and the rear sleeping area. The bed is a double one, the upper one able to be flipped up for somewhat difficult access to the lower one. The train station I could not take photos off since it was not included in the purchase. Judging from the building plans however I feel it was thrown in at the end just to add 'something' to the set. Its construction is very simple, consisting of a few grey plates on top of a few pillars. Access is provided by a plate which is connected to the platform with a few hinges. There are however two lamp posts, a timetable and a few chairs so if you don't like the platform you can still use these parts in a variety of other constructios. To end off I took a pic of the complete set (with extra wagon) and a friendly surprised train driver opening the door and greeting the camera man. Conclusion Being a '90s set, the train basically builds itself. The entire build cost me two hours and a half (I lost quite some time simply admiring the set) and was extremely straightforward with no suprises at all, but I need to admit it has its charm. The exterior is simply amazing. The sleekness of the design, the colours, it matches perfectly! I believe however that a width of 8 studs would be more to scale but 6 wide still looks amazing. The interior is somewhat simplistic but is easily moddeable with a few extra pieces. I basically bought the train as a parts pack. The standard set (three wagons) includes no less than 8 train doors with windows, 14 train windows, 4 smaller longer ones and 4 freight doors. The front and back of course count as unique pieces as well. One feature I am displeased with are the printed doors. I like printed pieces and while the blue-white-red stripe looks beautiful on the side the printed doors kind of limit MOCing capabilities to carriages with a stripe on the side. I considered simply removing the stripe but I found out I could just get normal grey ones from bricklink for a fair price. I am very pleased with the train but since you already know my opinion, feel free to tell us yours of this fabulous set! Edited by TheBrickster, 09 July 2009 - 01:51 PM.

Cool Review. I actually have two of these. I got one for christmas when it was rereleased in 2003 and another one in a charity shop a few months later for €5. I love the minifigs even if they all have smileys, and having two sets of them can really fill up a town.	positive
Nice review I collect all metroliner i can, i have 3 metroliner and when i can, i buy a other . My aim : Have the more big metroliner collect, in France ( in first time ) It's my favorite set	positive
I don't like the set and I do like the set. The reason why I like it: it looks good. The reason why I hate it: this train was the first train for the new 9v system and it means to me the end of the beautiful 12v series. For this last reason I own this set. I voted average. Only strange they named it metroliner. In Holland when we speak of a metro, I need to think at short distance trains only used in big cities like Rotterdam. And your minifigs at pic ain't right according the instruction .	neutral
My favourite, favourite, FAVOURITE old set. It's too bad I was born 2 years after its release, I would have had a major interest in Classic Town. I might actually get this one on Bricklink... not that it'll go for a good price (I'll only buy if it does you see). An "Outstanding", a highly useful and well-made set that really just stands out from its counterparts. Edit: NEVERMIND. Edited by Dovchenko, 16 August 2008 - 10:25 AM.	positive

I never got this set I spent a long time after one Christmas trying to get and failed miserably, admittedly I was much younger then. It has however remained one of my most sought after items but I’ve still never got around to getting one. The set generally makes me rather nostalgic for a time when the trains were painted in simple liveries like that one! Anyway it seems an excellent set from what I’ve seen and the figure selection is amazing. I hope Lego produce something as good as this when the new trains are released next year.	positive
Super review, thanks. Simply put, I'd have to admit this is one of the best Indy sets. And in such a small package. It's a very detailed lil' jeep, and that's why I like it. I have this too, but I don't want to open it since it's exclusive. Wait, I thought we were calling it "rown" and not "frown"	positive
Looks really nice, if they keep making BM sets like this, I might actually subscribe... Nice comic too, remind me not to run into Copmike and his gloveless hand...	positive
Thanks for the good review ! I can´t wait for mine to arrive! And just think how close PaulC was in his reverse building of this which turned into a Event Exclusive in Billund ! He was just wrong on the color of the headlight bricks (black instead of frown) and the rear bumper stuff which couldn´t be seen on the bag picture! Kudos PaulC!

Nice review! KimT, on Aug 5 2008, 07:16 AM, said: The fig: One single white classic space minifig. This is the worst one in my opinion. I never liked those white guys. And they get easily damaged by the sun. Nah! Give me a red or yellow instead (later blue or black). Even though they get damaged by the sun easily they're my favorite kind .	positive
I voted below average since I'm not a big fan of Classic Space.	negative
This is by far my favourite Outback series set! I loved the fact that you can bend the bridge in different directions so that the suspension of the car really worked to keep the car levelled, like you placed it in your last picture. I had lots of fun with this when it came out eleven years ago in 1997, the bridge scene could also be used in the Adventurers serie of 1998. Classic, highest rating, buy it if you don't already have it!	positive
TheBrickster, on Aug 7 2008, 04:06 PM, said: At leat you were able to pick up two of the sets. Do you still have them and/or the pieces? Yes, I have the parts, the manuals, and even one of the boxes. Unforutunaltey, the parts are mixed in a big pile of parts, as I never had any time to sort out my parts. You can see I used the yellow doors here, decals applied. The great thing about the copter was it had 2 suitcases, which as far as I can tell ain't a common part, not rare, but still nice to have. And it had the guy with the green jacket. The winch wasn't bad either, the only flaw was it was a "standard" lego copter, meaning similar ones where avalible in quite a few sets. Do you plan to review it? Staudie.	neutral
Nice review of an interesting set. But I have a query... Anyone know why it is actually called Amazon crossing when it's meant to be in Australia? Also, the Amazon runs through a jungle anyway. Edited by Shoc, 10 August 2008 - 03:44 PM.	positive

I don't really like this set because it isn't my idea of the droid gunship, which is from SW Battlefront, which can hold as many droids as a RGS can hold clones. If I buy this, it'd be for the dark blue pieces, which is the signature color of one of my Castle Nations ( Dark Red and Dark Blue ).	negative
This is a great set It's too pricey though If it was $10 or so cheaper I'd get it!	negative

Emergency Evac Set #: 6445 Theme: Town Res-Q Year Released: 1998 Piece Count: 97 Minifigs: 1 List Price: $8 (USD) In 1998, Lego introduced a new theme called Res-Q. The theme was really a quasi-Coast Guard sub-theme of Classic Town. The theme included boats, helicopters, emergency vehicles, and even a water hovercraft. Most notable was the black and yellow color combination that predominated the sets. I only picked up a couple of sets from the theme including this Emergency Evacuation vehicle that I consider a van. I never got into the theme, but looking back at these sets, I have gained a better appreciation for their value in Classic Town. Let's take a look at 6445 in greater detail. Starting with the box: The back of the box providing a few alternate models: And similar imagery on the instructions: The set includes one small sheet of decals for the van: 6445 has one Res-Q minifig that I find pretty nice. I like the neon orange reflectors: He has a nice printed backside with the word RES-Q prominently displayed: This little set includes an abundance of tools: A black walkie-talkie is not pictured Here's the emergency van: I like the back section that has a nice winch with turning wheel and a few hooks for tools: Here's the minifig pulling the grappling hook for some Res-Q action. This is my favorite part of this set: The van isn't too fancy but has some neat features: While I like the blue windshield piece for maybe space sets, I'm not really fond of its use for the van: The van has no steering wheel, but rather two levers for steering: On the top of the vehicle are two emergency alarms and some extra lights: The back of the van has a large opening piece that allows wide access to the back section: It comfortably fits a long gurney/stretcher: Here's the driver resting on the gurney: He should never have tried to pick up the gurney without a 2nd Res-Q minifig. And a shot of the back section without the gurney: Lastly, a picture of the complete set: Final Thoughts Res-Q is really a neat theme that has great play value for kids. While it's not one of my more favorite town sub-themes, it does offer some nice pieces and an abundance of black and yellow pieces. I think a few of the Res-Q sets go nicely with the Divers theme released one year earlier in 1997. I had a chance to purchase the largest set of the theme, 6479 Emergency Response Center, at half the price, but passed back in the late 90s. I'd be interested in finding out what other EB members think of this set and the Res-Q theme.	positive
Wow, and people complain that a military type line would be to violent. Here we have half dead soilders and a space shuttle bombing people with severed skeleton heads! i have to say this is the first time i've heard of this theme. I like the colors as most have pointed out. The base plate is preety cool two. Could use it to moc up some garages.	positive
Set: 7680 - The Twilight Theme: Star Wars Year Released: 2008 Piece Count: 882 Price: $AUD149.99 (or $159.99 if you buy at TRU!), 99.99 Euro, $US99.99 Pity the Twilight. When rumours of the set name first circulated, speculation was swift: 'Twilight - that suggests something sleek, elegant and mysterious.' Anticipation mounted! Fan-frenzy grew! Finally a pic leaked! And the verdict was... 'clunk-a-dunk' It appeared that in the Jedi off-season, Anakin was running something that looked like an intergalactic garbage scow, like Roger Wilco in the old Sierra Space Quest PC games. Blocky and bley seemed to sum it up. The set went from being one of the most anticipated to one of the least liked of 2008 pretty much instantly. It's a mark of that dislike that in the EB Clone Wars review feeding frenzy nobody has so far even bothered to post a few pics of this set even 2 weeks after it's official release! I'm here to redress that imbalance now and find out if 7680 is as horrendous as everyone originally thought Part 1: Box & Parts Front of the box. It's quite big, same size as the 10144 Sandcrawler. Annoyingly, it's the old style with the perforated corners that you have to tear to flip open the lid. Detail of the back, showing set functions: Interior of the box - a lot of wasted space. The set comes with 2 instruction manuals, each 76 pages. And no DSS sheet! Polybags! 13 of 'em. Like the other CW sets, these are unnumbered. Parts ahoy! You can tell at a glance that this set is comparable to the AT-TE, although there a large proportion of the 800+ parts here are technic pins and bley plates. Part 2: Minifigs and Build The set comes with 4 figs (or 3.5, depending on how you look at Rotta ): Anakin, Ahsoka, R2-D2 and Rotta. Very disappointing that there's nothing new here for such a high-priced exclusive, although I guess it is maybe movie accurate. Anyway, to paraphrase the wise Patsy Stone, you can never have enough hats, shoes or new Anakin/ Ahsoka hairpieces so it's not too bad. Pics of the build in progress. A quarter of the way through we can already see that this is one of those 'convoluted technic frames with some plates affixed' type builds: Half-way and the smaller wing is added: At the three quarter mark the giant single wing is added: And voila! Done! The final quarter is a race to attach all the exterior surfaces and details such as the engine and escape pod. The build itself is a mixed blessing. It is VERY technic oriented. I'm not a Technic-ally minded person and don't really have much of a conceptual grasp of how everything functions until I see the final result, so I find these type of builds a little uninteresting. Pins, axles and beams? Give me bricks any day! I really liked the 7676 Gunship and the 7679 Fighter Tank although they do contain some technic framework, they are largely brick-built ships, especially the Fighter Tank which is solid, largely brick built and full of neat functions. The 7680 build is one of the most technicy builds I've ever undergone in a System set, akin to the experience of building the 10178 Motorised AT-AT. But whereas with that set you could understand the need for a technic framework (the thing walks!) a lot of this seemed excessive. Yes, the Twilight does some have nice functions, and it is so large and heavy it does need a strong skeleton, but to me it just seemed too much and aesthetics have been sacrificed for (in some cases limited) functionality. I will discuss in more detail what I mean as I look at different parts of the set. On the upside, this is the only non-symmetric set in the CW range, so at least every page and new step brings something different! Part 3: A Closer View Close-up of the main body of the ship: Front-on. It is well-designed how the figs appear in line of sight (unlike the 6211 where Jabba and Leia were photoshopped in to the box art). Don't ask what Rotta is doing out of the line of vision there. Some things are better left unsaid. Side view, showing escape pod (smaller cylinder) and drive: Top view: Rear view, showing back door. The rear deck is huge. Indeed, the whole ship is huge. Oddly so. I don't know if this is movie-scale or not, but I've seen people complain the fighter tank is too big (!) and that set is nothing compared to this baby! It's wider than the Gunship and in wingspan and length is almost bigger. Here's a few pics next to an MTT for comparison. Pretty big, hey? Turning to the dark side must be good for business. Even if all you can buy is a rusty old beast like this, at least you could comfortably squash pretty much every vehicle in the opposing fleet just by landing on it. At least now you can see why it costs so much. The official pics make it look smaller, somehow, by truncating the rear and wing. The ship is in fact so big you can't really pose it with wings open - only hold it that way. I was too lazy to build a giant trans-clear support strut so propped it up on a shoebox instead. The wing opens very neatly - you push a technic lever and a pin holding the bottom wing pops out quite smoothly. The little top turret can move up and down as well to get the full cross-shaped effect. Part 4: Features and Functions The front cockpit folds down very neatly, although I find the build here a little weak. Whee! It goes all the way down to the floor. The mechanism is cool, but it takes up an awful lot of space. Basically the whole front is cockpit and all Lego could manage for controls is 2 printed 1x2 tiles as well (not pictured here, but they're attached to the part that folds up and down). There's also no way for anyone to get in or out of the cockpit. And an invisible windscreen! Technology has come a long way. Side view, looking from wing. R2D2 is here as well as some tools. You can also glimpse here one of the main problems with the set. Despite being a huge boxy ship, there's no interior! None! The Twilight doesn't even have an internal floor. All the room inside is taken up by the landing gear which folds up - again, a clever function but it really gets in the way of the set as a whole. Kudos to the designer for coming up with stable, working landing gear, but too clever by half if it means that this giant ship ends up basically being one tiny cockpit and a rear door at the back that doesn't lead to any interior! Underside showing landing gear when open: And closed - when the wing is folded down, the gear is locked in place, which is pretty neat. Space-consuming, but neat. The rear section. The door, when opened, reveals an orange cupboard and a tow-line, as Ahsoka uses in the box art. The door clicks into place when open and can be released by pressing the technic bit at the top. Again, clever, but pointless as you can't get inside! Ahsoka can indulge in a little recreational bungee-jumping if she so wishes: The rear deck is so large that it is wasted just being used so Ahsoka can bungee-jump. I came up with a much better use for it. Outdoor garden! Despite having one roboticised hand, Anakin was still quite the green thumb. And his light-saber was very useful as a hedge trimmer. So much so that he set up a side business between Rotta-rescue missions. Here's a promotional postcard: A few other bits and pieces. The gun turret on the enormous mega-wing can only hold one flick fire missile at a time (you do get two, though ) Rear engine detail: The escape pod sits neatly on the side and is basically built the same way as the Gunship bacta tank: The pod sits on these tehcnic pins and is held in place by the light bley parts: Part 5: In conclusion The Twilight is a huge ship, with a huge amount of great functions - folding wing, folding cockpit, rear door, escape pod, retractable landing gear! But this functionality comes at a price - a very complex technic build and zip interior. Compared with the Gunship, for example, which is stuffed with nooks and crannies, the Twilight suffers in this respect. I also think it is just too large - it doesn't really fit with the other craft and vehicles released with the Clone Wars line. I may be wrong and it is movie-accurate, but when you have all the CW sets laid out it does stick out like a poor thumb. Part selection is OK, with the only interesting things being a few dark orange plates, the orange cupboard and the big trans-neon green radar dish. Don't get me wrong, I don't think this is a bad set at all. It's just the other CW sets are so sweet! I would say it's an above average set in a field crammed with excellent ones. If you're a completist, buy it, but if for example you'd rather invest in another AT-TE to upgrade your Republic Army, then I couldn't really disagree with you either And to finish on a light note, I'd like to remind you that you do get another Ahsoka hairpiece, which can be used for all sorts of things. Ugha warrior upgrade: Dr Inferno hair transplant: And finally, attack of the deadly blue-ringed octopus, native to Australia's beaches and oceans! Thanks for reading!	neutral
darkrebellion, on Aug 12 2008, 12:17 PM, said: I like this ship even if it looks so bulky but I need to buy first other sets, so maybe this beast will be landing in my collection the next year (Or this one if I am lucky ). I can just ask for something, can you post a pic of all your clone wars sets together with this one (all the sets in one pic, not many pics with this an each set ) please . I think a lot of people feel the same way - there was so much good stuff to get in the first wave that this is probably a backburner set for a lot of people, and some are probably waiting to see the movie to see how prominently it features. I will try and take a pic with some other CW sets, I don't have all of them though and some need to be reassembled as I built them on holiday and then had to pack them away I do think this line of sets has been the best SW Lego wave released though. All of the recent releases have been amazing in their own way.	neutral
This is probably the best review I've ever seen. Why? It put the set in context with people's changing thoughts about it. It commented on the box, why do such expensive sets have such ordinary boxes? The photography was outstanding. Every issue that a builder could have with it was discussed in a calm and rational manner. I have the same issues with technic structured sets, and svelte_corps summed up my feelings on this beautifully. This was an even handed review, so thoughtful. Finally, you gotta love a bit of humour in a review, that gardenis brilliant. I was probably never going to get this set anyway but it sets a new world's best standard for reviews. I strongly encourage anyone that's going to review a set to have a good look at this to see how well it can be done. Thanks for the magnificent review!	positive
Seems like TLC has done a pretty accurate representation of the ship. The real fault for the ship's messy design has to go to Lucasfilm, not TLC. My guess is Lucasfilm is trying to recapture that "what a piece of junk!" magic of the Millennium Falcon. I guess we'll have to wait to see the movie to see if they succeeded or not. The idea of a "space mobile home" reminds me of the Winnebago from "Spaceballs." Great review!! Informative, entertaining, and opinionated. So many people shy away from stating an actual OPINION in their review for fear of offending anyone. What's the point of making a review if you don't state what you think about it???	neutral
I think some people agree that this ship is better than when we first saw those pictures, at least I do. It looks like it has some nice accessories that come with the ship as well. My favorite of you custom things has got to be the octopus it's so funny and a great use for the headdress thing. Great review. Edited by Skipper 24, 13 August 2008 - 11:24 AM.	positive

Very good set. Indeed the possibility to alter the knight's appearance hugely boosts the value! Very smart thinking of TLC. Got one of these so far, but if I ever do a Castle-related comic or animation, this will be the set I buy tons of.	positive
Argh! What I was typing kept getting deleted by my stupid keyboard!!!!! On Topic: This looks like a great little set, I could use a few of these, but I haven't seen any at a local store.

Time for another of the great Castle sets. And yes this one is a great army builder set as well :D Set# 7090 Set title: Crossbow Attack Price: 5.29 Euro / 5.99 USD Pieces: 54 Release: 2007 The Box: And as the other two sets reviewd so far (7009 and 5615), this one has a fitting box that is too easily snatched from the shelf and put into your shopping cart. - Not sure it's a great thing...too expensive in the end :D The Crossbow Attack Cart: The cart is a neat little build that actually works. And for once we're not given that awful technic launcher, but a "build-it" launcher! It actually works just fine for it's purpose. The addition of two crossbows makes it worth buying. Never can get enought weapons for the evergrowing Crownie army. The Figs: Oddly I've not taken any pics of the figs and therefore I'll illustrate using the S@H pic. The figs are great. I love the silver helmets and in this set you get 2 crownies and a skeleton plus a white skeleton horse. That's a lot of figs for a set this size. A true army builder. Thumbs up for that. The All in All verdict: Another small, yet super set in the Castle theme. I bought several of these to make a fine little army. It's cheap and often found on sale! I can hardly resist buying it when I see it KimT	positive
This is an awesome set in my opinion. I scraped my crossbows for MOCing recently, but the set is still an amazing army builder. For the price for the SW battlepacks, which have 4 minifigs and a cheap vehicle, you get 4 knights ( this is 2 sets to equal the price of a BP ), 2 Skellys and 2 skelly horses, plus 4 crossbows, 4 good wheels, and some other good dark blue and brown pieces for my ever expanding castle town. Great Buy.	positive
And another set enters the scene: Set# 7009 Set title: The Final Joust Price: 8.29 Euro / 7.99 USD Pieces: 62 Release: 2007 The Box: And yet again TLG has put the bricks in a box, that somehow corresponds with the amount of bricks in it. The Castle theme has got well designed boxes :) The whole set (build): 2 knights, jousting fence and weapon rack. The Weapons Rack: Another great addition of weapons. Flail, halberd and skeleton scimitar. Super weapons for those close encounter melee battles fought when tipped off the horse : :grin:P The Jousting Fence: Not much to say. It's a fence. Simple, yet it serves it's purpose very well. The Crown Knight: Gotta love that guy. He looks like nothing can hurt him. He even got a selfsufficient smile on his face. I'm sure he's convinced that no skeleton can defeat him. Also the horse, it's barding and the headcover looks awesome. A great old school sword and the ever cool normannic shield. What could possibly go wrong for this knight? The helmet I really love. IMO it's a lot better than the old knight helmets (see review of 5615 The Knight for a pic of one of those). The Skeleton Knight: The black skeleton horse ROCKS! I love that design and in black it's even badder than than the white version. The shield reeks of dread and the knight is one bad skeleton on the rampage. I do find that the helmet is a little off! I'd rather have a black knights helmet instead. The KK helmet doesn't really do it for me. The All in All verdict: This is another great army builder set. It holds a lot of great weapons, some cool minifigs and great pieces. The only thing that puzzles me is; why would a Crown Knight joust a Skeleton? Doesn't really make sense. KimT	positive
This set is a great little bundle, the kitted out knight, skellie knight, weapons, and the few bricks for the fence and weapon rack. The Castle 07 barding here is very nice, indeed the colour scheme of the new Castle guys is great IMO, the light blue and blue work nicely together and against the grey background. I don't really like the pearl grey helmet - it would be nicer in metallic silver like the visor I think. Interesting comment re: the skellie helmet - I guess black normal knight's helmet with visor would be quite nice for him. I got this set as part of the Complete Castle Collection from S@H. However, I have extras of all the smaller sets and Skeleton Tower, except I don't have another one of this set. It's on my list of sets to buy. Unfortunately it wasn't on S@H for Ireland when I was making later orders - quite an odd omission. Also last year Castle '07 was exclusive to Argos (UK catalogue retailer) who only had three sets (not the joust). I should see if the local toy store has it now though, as they did stock some '07 Castle in addition to '08 at the start of the year. I think small sets like this should be well stocked in shops for a year or two - it surely doesn't do their sales much good to be so sporadically available? Sorry, turned into a bit of a ramble. Anyways, the point is that this set is good enough I'd pick up another. The Cobra: that sucks about customs. I try to keep my orders to within the €23 duty-free limit for here in Ireland. If your imports are waylaid you pay 20% import duty, 21% sales tax, and a postage fee for the diversion to customs. NASTY! Edited by brickzone, 13 August 2008 - 11:15 AM.	positive
You know what I think this set has? Charm. Lots of it. I'm not a big fan of castle, having very few sets, all of them spanning different nations/armies, but I couldn't resist this set. And while not obvious at first, it really is backwards compatible with every castle set with a horse in it. Nonetheless, I think this set is great. It's simple, cheap and has charm. That's good enough for me. Plus it has that fantastic grinning knight and the black skeleton horse. Those just made it better.	positive
Perhaps he meant the pearl light grey lance, which is not that common.	neutral
Good review KimT. Pictures are clear and show each of the pieces in great detail. I agree with your comments as well. I'm a bit curious, does the knight's helm have a hole for plume? I've been debating whether to purchase this set or not. I'm not a big fan of horses so I'll likely barely use them, but I do like the unique minifigs, weapon rack/weapons, and the fact that the divider has a few useful pieces that can be added to other sets. However, I just don't feel the set is worth $8 when compared to Crossbow attack and the Knight's Catapult unless the buyer is really wanting some mounted minifigs. Luckily, Amazon just lowered their price of this set from $8 to $6 (along with another 20% if using Bill Me Later... just in case anyone was also in the same situation I was in). At that price, it's damn well worth it.	positive
INDEXED Name: Holiday Villa Theme: LEGO System / Town Year: 1988 Pieces: 197 Minifigs: 2 Price: USD ? There were quite a few sets in the 1980's that weren't sold in the US. I remember reading once that it was because they contained wine glasses and TLG felt they wouldn't be able to market a toy that encourage the drinking of alcohol. This set was one of them. I remember seeing this in a catalog that came with a Fabuland set and wondering what it was and where I could get one. I wrote to LEGO and got an overseas catalog which had the Futuron 6990 Monorail Transport System in it before it was available in the US. I was amazed. I ended up buying 6349 Holiday Villa from that catalog but, for some reason, gave it to my best friend for his birthday. I've always wanted this set and finally bought it from Bricklink this year.... My purchase included everything except the box. I really like the boxes. But, in lieu of a boxshot, here is the instruction manual: I imagine this was the image on the front of the box: The parts One of the things that appealed to me about this set is it's abundance of rare parts. This base plate is an excellent piece and was only available in two sets: Classic LEGO telephone: Technically, these blue windows 1 x 4 x 5 windows are only available in this set, according to Bricklink. It was available in different form (with and without fixed glass, trans blue glass) in other sets. Regardless this size and color window is rare and the blue door was only available in 4 sets. This was a huge selling point for me as I'm a window monkey. Never heard that term? It's like a parts monkey (a collector who buys mulitples of sets just for parts or large lots of bulk from BL and sorts them into bins) but just for windows. Tell your friends I coined the term: These sloped windows have endless possibilities in many themes (maybe not with the curtain decals applied) but are another great rare part that appears in this set: The build Remember this piece? I'd like to see a badass Agents car built on this car base! : I am a fan of the six-wide car but I see the appeal of the four wide. It has a very nostalgic feel to it: There's no denying that this is a beauty of classic LEGO 4-wide cars: This set comes with two mini-figures, one of which appears to be a painter. Classic vintage LEGO figs: Onto the house which begins with the basic floorplan: A kitchen that's open to the rest of the house and a little oven and hood vent is one of my favorite touches. It's one thing to throw an oven into a house set, but the designer of this set made it a cool part of the architecture of the house which gives it a unique feel: The completed first floor and carport: I do wish the sides of the roof were white with a little overhang like an actual roof. This method of white on bottom, red on top looks more like a child's drawing than a real house. This is easily fixed with some modifying. Still, you get a lot of roof pieces in this set: Here we have the completed set. The husband cleans the yard while the wife gets plastered on wine. Don't tell the American kids! Another angle: Working in the kitchen: Getting smashed before dinner. I think she may have a serious problem: The bedroom. A little stark, but the bed looks comfy: Overall shot of the interior: Rating Playability: 9/10 (The possibilities are endless with Drunky McWine-Wine and husband. Really, playability is up to the imagination of the player. It's a house, not really very action-packed.) Design: 9.5/10 (Great design with plenty of rare parts. Love the classic car, too! Loses half a point for the all red roof...) Price: NA (I believe this was inexpensive, but since I have no proof, I will have to leave this factor out of the overall rating.) Overall: 9.25/10 (Classic sets like this all deserve 10s in my book, but looking at it with an objective eye it's Excellent, but not perfect.)	positive
That's a great review of a great set, Hinckley! I voted for Outstanding : This set is simply amazing! I regrettably don't own this set since it's very hard to find on Ebay and/or the stickers are missing. But nevertheless I hope that I one day will be able to get this awesome set - or even better - see TLG releasing a new City villa in a style similar to that brilliant set .

Great review! I'd give this set an 8 at the least. It's just a tad too simple for my liking but other than that it looks great! While I'm a 4 wide car man I actually think this car looks rather horrendous. The main body seems way too low in comparison with the windows. The rare parts however do make up for it.

Isn't it in the movie, though? Right before "Blame Canada?" On topic, I find it funny that people find that car so great. I don't like 4 wide cars but I also think it's beautiful just because of the nostalgic feeling I get looking at it-like hot cocoa on Christmas morning with a new teddy bear in my stocking. Get out of my socks teddy bear! My feet are cold! Is that Santa's boot dangling from the chimney? What's that smell? Anyway, does anyone long for the days of 2-wide cars with 2 x 2 slope windshields that were more suited for a skateboard than a car? I suppose someone has to have affection for those things. Who was around back then? CopMike? Gylman? Hobbes? Do you like 2-wide cars? Seriously though, anyone? My point is, as much as I like the realism of the six-wide and wider cars, the 4-wides make me feel all warm and fuzzy.	positive
Well, technically it is 4 wide...	neutral

This is my favourite house which I owned during my childhood. Although it's in the crypt, but I hope to build it back one day. Looking at your review makes me so envy of you to own a complete set. The baseplate is very unique especially for its stoned pattern. Classic LEGO telephone is just so lovely especially when its printed. The entire house layout is simple and very nicely constructed. In fact, the simplicity just showed how much LEGO could do with such parts. There are many nice furnitures included in this set such as the little oven/stove, dining table, bed and car porch. The little black car is a classic example of a true 4-studs car. I love this house very much, and my verdict is a full "5". No doubt about it. Thanks Hinckley for this lovely review.	positive
Cool review! I never knew that those wine-glasses could be the reason for this not being sold in the US!	neutral
I wish I could find this set some day (including the right baseplate). Some of my House MOCs are styled after the classic 6349. And sometimes I've rebuilt it after Instruction Scans exchanging the baseplate (I don't own one of these) with 2 at 16x32 each. And this city house out of an older thread of mine. It's offensive, that I've used styling elements of 6349's just enlarged. In terms of interior details: Not much, but still enough for classic town.

This would be great for any Pirate fan, the extraback pack for the soldiers, some spare owes for the row boats, a female face for a wench, and a rather simple raft for that unlucky pirate lost at sea! Over all a nice set, I am a little confused by the dynamite though... perhaps an easy way to go fishing or perhaps to clear a rock in the forseen future? Or is it that she is just a suicide bomber attacking the white house water (joke not ment to be tasteless or offensive to those lost in the act of terrosim, greatest respect to those who have lost loved ones) Great Review, Regards Cpt.

A neat set with lots of accessories, but I never liked any of the LEGO helicopters with long streamlined canopies, as they are obviously more influenced by military helicopters and space ships, than by real civilian transport helicopters. I'd give it a 3 at best. Very good and thourough pictorial review though!	positive

6004 Crossbow Cart Review Because I may start collecting Castle here is a review of one of my few castle sets. Please note I hurriedly put his together meaning some parts are the wrong color, look out for them! This review will also be done in my Star Wars review style. The lighting is also particularly bad in the pics. On with the review... Parts: 20 Figs: 1 Price: ????? 1.Overview and fig The whole set. The Fright Knight's knight. The disemboweled knight. The head printing is just longer then the helmet visor. 2. The cart The cart has 3 crossbows and 2 Norman type shields. The cart's advanced defense and weapons systems. All the parts from the cart. (Forgot to add the fig in) 3.Extras & overall Here are all my Castle figs. Remember I don't collect Castle. (yet ) Oh yeah I forgot to put one of the old skellies and a ghost on there. Could a castle fan tell me if any of these minifigs are rare. I have no idea because I don't collect castle. Build: 6/10 Pretty standard for a impulse. Minifigs: 7/10 Nice minifig with lots of accessories. Design: 8/10 This set made way for some of the new castle carts of similar size. Parts: 10/10 3 Crossbows, 2 shields, arrow quiver, and spear as well as cool minifg in a 20 piece set! Price: 10/10 Well I don't know but LEGO was cheaper in '97 so it gets 10. Playability: 5/5 Pretty much standard for a impulse set. Overall 8/10 Good parts and price as well as minifig scores this set an 8. Thanks for reading.	positive
Looks great, and the figures up there are old, and kinda rare. I don't really like fright knights though, so I probably won't get this set.	neutral
I gave it Above Average. It was a nice set and included some nice pieces, but it is only an impulse set after all. Edited by NewRight, 19 August 2008 - 01:06 PM.	neutral
Originally shared in the History & Adventure Forum for its adventure attributes, here's my favorite of the Outback collection: First, let me say that this little set is one of my all-time favorites because it can be used to sumplement a number of different themes. 1) the set makes a great little adventure airstrip for Adventurers and more recent, the Indiana Jones theme (see also German Headquarters and Port Adventure). I've also used the set as an addition to my Wild West town. The tan baseplate and windmill works great, just subtract the plane, modern equipment, and figs. And lastly, as the set was intended, as an Outback/desert airstrip. Set Description: Outback Airstrip Set # 6444 Pieces: 157 Minifigs: 3 Release Date: 1997 Original Price: $20 (USD) Starting with the box: And the backside. Notice the alternate models. I love the swamp boat: The building is my favorite part of the set. It is simple, has a little detail, two great roof pieces, and a single green window (great piece!): Check out the great windmill piece. It's my only one and makes a great part for Wild West and that farm you always wanted to build. I used it for the Barnhouse of Barnabas Higgens and Spring Valley Ranch On the side of the building is a great radio and a clear glass: Unfortunately, no furniture can be found within the building: And now the airplane: Front view; I love the twin propellors: Side view: And the rear section: The back has a small cargo hold for some boxes/freight or some gear needed in the Outback: The set includes three figs, two with cool shades: And some great equipment. I love the boom box: A shot of the whole set: And another: Summary: As I mentioned above, this set is very versatile and can suplement a few different themes. It's my personal favorite of the Outback collection and I'm really glad I was able to find the set in the late 90s (I almost didn't buy). Sets like this are timeless and so much fun to build and display. Hope you enjoy the review.

This is really an ideal small set. In spite of its size, it has nearly everything: • Three minifigs • A vehicle • A building • Numerous minifig accessories • Numerous rare and useful parts • Nice model design (especially for the time period) Too bad Outback came out during my dark years.	positive
This is probably my all-time favorite LEGO set. It was originally given to me for my birthday by a close friend of mine back in the release year of 1997. The cargo plane was, by far, my favorite vehicle ever. Unfortunately, someone stole the plane from me when our families went on vacation and the rest of the set was given to my cousin's oldest son when I was no longer interested in my LEGO collection. Now that I'm back into LEGO, I use that building's construction for various projects, especially as a Dr. Inferno look-out shack using parts from extra Mission 3: Swamp Raid. The shack compliments the original set greatly. Edited by Skorpius47, 19 August 2008 - 01:44 AM.	positive
The Building is great and detailed, with a few mods it could be added to my Castle town. I don't really like the plane though, seems kind of abstract, not really good in my opinion, but I bet it would be easy to mod to look better.	positive
One of the best in my humble opinion. As far as I know it was never released in the UK so the only reason I managed to get my hands on it was on a family holiday to the US, I think they’d only recently opened the Lego store in Disney. Arguable the best feature is that it seems to fit into a wide selection of themes, is it a airstrip in the middle of nowhere, is it next to a only mining town that’s not deserted the possibilities are rather open and that’s truly great.	positive
Set#: 7103 Theme: Star Wars Set Name: Jedi Duel Pieces: 74 Release: 2002 Price: 10 USD Minifigs: 2 (Count Dooku and Yoda) Links: 7103 Brickshelf Folder Bricklink Reference Catalog Peeron.com Introcomment: I remember getting this set solely because I collect Star Wars. As I rebuild it and took pics of it, I found that I actually like this set for different reasons. Dooku's speeder is pretty cool and the lightsabre rocks. The Dooku minifig is also great. What's not so great is the flythingy and getting another Yoda. Though that's kinda hard not to get in a set focused on their duel "You can't see the wires, because they digitally removed them." "Be careful or I'll digidally remove your head" - Steven Seagal [I hope I quoted that one right ] So to get the review on the move, I'll impress you all with a box picture: Neat, huh? One of the smaller boxes, but still kinda big when consider that you only get 74 pieces and 2 minifigs. The instruction isn't that big As I said, the Dooku minifigs is awesome I love the print on his torso that combines the brown cape with the torso and also the head is neatly designed. Not a fleshie, though. This was before the flesh-license-facelift A sideview of the light blue speeder. Mmmm that crome light sabre hilt is nice The design of the speeder is also ok, and without the usual off-colour-scheme bricks. No tan or yellow sticking out there Yeah, I'd panic too if this came right at me...who wouldn't when noone's driving? And a rear shot. I think the design is a little off. The shields makes it all a little too open in my opinion. The printed bricks are a kick and thus evens the score here. This hideous design is meant to flip Yoda around the air. Put him in this funfair from Hell thing and give him a twister he and Dooku will never forget. My guess is that it's there to add some playability, but it's just odd and quite useless. Much like the playability soccer thingies in the Ultimate Light Sabre Duel The Verdict: Ups and downs. This set offers both. I rate it as "Average" since the size and price of the set make it acceptable to have odd things. Confused? Good so am I Making a small set isn't that easy and remeber this set is from 2002 and a lot has happended since then, designwise that is. What do you think?	positive
Oky Wan Kenobi, on Aug 18 2008, 02:41 PM, said: Wasn't this the only [Yoda] that was ever released except for the one in the Dagobah/X-Wing set? Sure, he is not the best fig with the unmovable legs and all, but still: It's Yoda! Edit: I'm pretty sure we got a Yoda in the Wookiee Catamaran set from Revenge of the Sith ...runs to check Brickset... yep, there's a Yoda in that set, as well. But the Jedi Duel is the only reasonably priced set with the green Force-guru. Nevermind, looks like a couple of other members already covered Yoda's availability in other sets. Back on topic: Great review, and a real blast from the past. I never did get this set, just didn't care for the speederbike or the weird piece of equipment. Thanks for explaining that it's supposed to be used to "force-jump & spin" Yoda all over the place. I never knew that's what it was for. Anyway, wish I had known Yoda and Dooku were going to be impossible to get later; I may've picked this set up just for the minifigs. Edited by bamaker, 18 August 2008 - 10:39 PM.	neutral

Thank you for that very interesting review, metalandi. A cool set with a lot of features and some nifty vehicles, very playable and well designed indeed.

Set data 4920: The Rapid Rider Year: 1999 Subtheme: Rock Raiders Pieces: 37 (+1 extra - TrNeonGreen Plate 1 x 1 Round) Price: Euro 3,50, used, not including S/H, on eBay Building time: less than 10 minutes. More info: Bricklink - Peeron. I could have owned the 4910 Hover scout (see Metalandi's review here), but while I was buying some used sets, I forgot to buy that one too! So, here's my only RR set, the second smallest one (if we don't count Japanese promos; sweets are surely sweeter if they come with a Lego set!) Pieces: Face and torso closeup; I like the torso, the face is good except for the bandanna. Building is based on two big pieces: Landing Skids and Plate 6 x 6 x 2/3 Cross with Dome. Let's go! Building is over: Review: Pros: Small set (= cheap), 1 fig, two accessories, some interesting pieces like the rock and the Crystal. No stickers but 3 printed pieces! Good color choice. Cons: Tipper Bucket is fixed, no hinge. No levers or steering wheel, it probably moves by using the buttons on the 2x2 tile. It deserves a 4/5.	neutral
This was the first Rock raiders set I got. I really like it, and I think I got all of them except the huge cargo airlift thing. I remember these sets coming out and getting the big base for Christmas, though they are all destroyed now... sadly... . Nice Review.	positive
I do like the set, although I don't own it. I do remember lusting after it when I was a kid, though (mainly because of the female minifig and the colors). It's a bit simplistic, but comes with a few great parts. You also did a great job on describing the set, and the pictures give the full impression of the appearance. For the review, I just have to point out a few things, to give you constructive criticism: first of all, it's chef, not "chief" (entirely different professions), and secondly, the scale you give in the poll isn't very even. "Above average" jumps to "outstanding", which is a too big of a gap in my opinion. You should've used "Good" or "Great" in between them. But these are only minor faults, this is a good review anyway!	neutral
got this one as well, not much surprises in such a small set, but the fast-food pizza idea is pretty cool. as far as i know only the small mcdonalds promo and this set are related to food/restaurant thing (until the cafe corner that is) But since i have a classic lego city i can't miss this set.	neutral
This set looks really cool, especially for one this inexpensive. The van is neat, and the hidden storage compartment i back is the icing on the cake. I like the back with hidden oven as well, and the rare sink piece makes it all the better. With five pizzas and three minifigs, it's and excellent set to behold.	positive
Excellent job, and one of the best sets in history, if you ask me! 5/5 all the way. This is what we need more of. WhiteFang, on Aug 24 2008, 05:22 AM, said: Devoted "PIZZERIA" staff On the left, we will have the Pizza Boy, whom is wearing the regular blue dungarees and its white cap. I wonder who is that boy? On the middle, we will have the Pizza Girl. She looks like any typical sweet girl in town that the boys will look at. She is wearing a suntop strapless on her. She reminded me of one person though, I think her name is called Alice. Taking a careful look, I wonder if ImperialShadows is the Pizza Boy back then, without that black patch on its left eye? On another note, this mini-figure was my favourite. Female mini-figures are very uncommon back then. I am glad I have this figure, adding to my town population. Hmmm... He does look a little familiar, and I definitely recognise the lovely Alice. Now stop staring at her. Sandy, on Aug 24 2008, 06:33 AM, said: it's chef, not "chief" (entirely different professions) Actually, Salvatore, as I like to call the chef, was in the navy where he reached the rank of chief, a nickname he holds to this day. So both work in this case. WhiteFang, on Aug 24 2008, 09:12 AM, said: Flyut, if you need decals for the stickers that are featured in this set. Hang around here until ImperialShadows drop by to give you a little surprise if he is free. Surprise? Free? I'm not even close to free, I'm rather expensive, but I do have a surprise for everyone! I think you'll be interested in the companion article to this fine review, my first set restoration project. Again, great job WhiteFang, excellent review, and TLG, this is a star amongst your sets. Think about that when you're designing new ones. Seriously.	positive
This set is great and so is this review! I really like seeing reviews of classic sets like this and hope to see more in the future. The chef in this set is the base for my Sigfig in fact! The classic sets have a totally different feel to them than the newer sets. They look more human. Great review!	positive
I used to want this set so badly and I almost got it when it was rereleased. I still wonder why I didn't because with a building, van, 5 pizzas, and a then very rare female fig. this set would have been perfect for someone with a smaller collection like I had then. What surprised me the most is how well this set still holds up to others today. Off to bricklink!	positive

Do you mean this one http://www.brickset....aspx?Set=2962-1 ? I would also like to get that, alone for the fact that it's the only Res-Q set with a female fig	neutral
I have this set and it's pretty nice. I love the Res-Q theme in general. I think that tow truck is easily the highlight of this set and is probably the best such vehicle I've seen in any City set. The other vehicles are also great. The base itself is lacking though, as it basically consists of one room that doesn't even have side walls. It does include a cool 3x6 computer sticker and a vast array of minifig tools and equipment though. I have some plans to modify the building and make it larger but have never gotten around to doing it.	positive
I just built this set in MLCad as a requestfor a fellow Eurobricks member. Somehow I missed out on this set completely when it came out. I was really suprised how long it took to build (virtually). Despite its size this set is packed with details, minifigs, vehicles and tools. Thanks for all the pictures!

Hi everyone, this is my first review on LEGO sets here. Hope you guys like it. And I would like to apologise for the bad quality pictures. Hope you guys don't mind. First I will start with the box art. Box art: I guess this is the first time that LEGO Star Wars sets use white and blue colour for their box. I like the new colour scheme, a nice blend though. Here's the front: The back: Not to waste space on the box LEGO do some advertisement to attract us to buy more sets. :grin:the more The side: At the top side there is this minifigs scale picture. It is great as we get to know the real size of a minifigs. Contents: The contents consist of a sticker sheet, instruction book, and 8 packet of bricks. The packer are not numbered. But it is ok as there is not much pieces. Instruction book and random page: As usual the instruction book have brick checklist, other sets pictures, and tutorial on how you should assemble your set (I mean the very first page). Sticker sheet: There is not much sticker sheet and is a great news that the Republic logo on the round plate is printed unlike Republic Gunship. Anyway, I didn't apply the stickers. The Commander Gear: This is a new thing to minifigs as well. Well is like Batman accessories, they pack it in one small packet. However, you only get one commander gear pack in this set. Anyway, i didn't use them. The minifigs: Well, we get the the new minifigs. The ugly face clone, new printed torso and new mold of helmet. However i not really like the new head stud, i prefer a black one or at least the one like Jango Fett, black colour with face. The helmet: Everything is printed, no holes at the visor there, but there are hole on the both side. This new helmet mold also made the headgear turn 360 degree freely. Without helmet: With helmet: You can see the flesh tone at the hole beside. The blasters: @ short blasters were given instead of long one. Is great, at least they give us two blasters instead of one. The tank: Here is the pics of the tank. It was not badly design nor nicely design. But it looks great if you didn't saw the beneath or under the tank. View from front: View from side: View from back: What's beneath? Under it was 4 wheels, to make it move fluently. It is made by the thread supporter like the one we fet from TIE Crawler or Bat-Tank The functions: Well firstly, you can open up the hood (I guess) to see the engine. Secondly the side cannon that can move upwards. The thing is quite tight (see random instruction page) and there is barrier to block the cannon from going downwards. The cockpit: Well the cockpit is small and the space is limited. The monitor stuff is printed brick and is another great news. You have to remove the piece (pic below) to reveal the cockpit and put your clone to pilot it. Pop-up gunner mechanism: Well the backdoor have a thing to attack to the seat of the gunner. The top hatch is very loose. So it there is a clone as a gunner and you open the back door, the clone will pop-up and automatically open the hatch on top. This is how the top looks like without a clone. There is this movable cannon (upwards, left and right) and a little keyboard thing with it. But the cannon fall off quite easily. The flick launching missile mechanism: The mechanism is on both side and you need to turn the thing inwards to reveal the flick fire mechanism. Below are the pic of how it is turned. You can keep you blaster at the front of the side. There are place for you to store them. It close nicely. Completion: This is how it looks like. Extra parts: There quite a number of them. Overall: This set is not bad. The price is quite expensive but you will like it. The pop-up mechanism is something new (to me) but this set have more function and 2 Clone Trooper with a pack of Commander gear. Pros: -2x Clone Troopers -high playability -nice design Cons: -a little expensive -sticker sheet -cannon on top falls off quite easy Edited by KimT, 27 August 2008 - 12:16 PM.	positive

What with the expenses-trimming and all, it's apparently one of the many little quirky things they've discovered in the manufacturing and packaging process that people have done for years without thinking (in this case, putting the heads on the torsos) but that turns out to be a surprisingly significant expense (timewise, I suppose). Think it was in one of his blog posts, but not sure. Too tired (ie, lazy) to go hunting for it now, sorry >-|	neutral
But does this mean that they add to the piece count? Is it a super secret clever way to make the piece count seem bigger than it is? HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM |:| Addition I've built it, review up later tonite but here's this to wet your appetite.	negative
Right so here's my review (FINALLY). The whole Gallery of box, parts, minifigs and finished model is here, over 2 pages. So on with the Show. Minifigs http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1340864 In the set you get Krakaroff (I dunno how to spell it) and Victor Krum. The figs are exactly the same, bar their heads. These are two fantastic figures, the expression on Krakaroff's face is priceless. Judging by the design I think we might get a Yellow Krakaroff cropping up somewhere, which would make me a happy bunny (he'd make a fantastic Viking) Ideally I'd have liked more than 2 figures for my money, three would have done it, I think 2 is too few. Piece Count http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344573 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344571 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344572 For a ?40 set, the piece count is quiet good, I don't know the exact number but when building it, I didn't feel short changed, bar the exception of the hull. Now I don't HATE the hull, my problem is that is doesn't connect with bricks like the old Pirate ships. There are pros and cons to this, on the plus side its more secure, and your whole ship doesn't need to be taken up with support structure. The negative side being, you can't really make it bigger (as they've only released a megablocking 4+ set with the right piece, and its the wrong color). I also like how its wide, meaning you can fit LOADS of minifigs on the main deck. Overall though I liked the pieces. Of note are gold studs (http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344510) (5 in total, you get one spare), the return of the black falcon shields (http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1340835) and the new Drumstrang Shields. The Construction A simple fun build. Nothing too fiddly. The Finished Model http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344474 (Big Picture) I really like this set. There's no bones about it. It seems Lego with the latter half of 2005 have given people who loved their original pirate ships hope for the future with this and the fantastic Viking Longboat. Even with the two 4+ pieces (the hull, and front of the ship) I wasn't put off. http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1340841 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344461 The front of the ship is a nice piece, and can be used for stuff like castles. http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344490 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344491 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344492 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344494 And the hull isn't all bad. What I REALLY liked was the little cargo hold, at the moment I have a treasure chest in there, but there' space for about eight of them I reckon. Playability wise it does make alot of sense, and as you can see you can imprision minifigs below deck. http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344484 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344488 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344506 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344500 The quarters are great as well. You can comfortably fit about six minifigs in the main gally, three by the steering wheel, and a couple up above the top cabin. You could fit more, but it'd look strange. My only gripe is the design of the top cabin. When you want to open it up, you have to remove the mast. I know its simple enough, but I think that it wouldn't have taken much for TLC to design it better. But saying that its easily done, and I like how the cabin can be lifted with ease from the steering deck. http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344540 The final play feature is the plank. You can while away the hours murdering hapless minifigs who've displeased the cabin. A really nice addition for pirate fans. The Final Verdict[/b Playability: 9.5/10 - Lots to do for all the kids. Piece Count: 9/10- A great selection, loses one for the hull. Figures: 8/10 - Just needs one more! Construction: 9/10 - Nice and simple. Value: 8.5/10 - Let down a bit by lack of minifigs, and the cons of the hull. [b]Overall: 8.8/10 Overall this is a set worth getting, especially if you miss proper pirates. It wouldn't take much to turn this into an AMAZING pirate ship MOC. Hope you liked my review. Matt	positive
[burns]Excellent...[/burns] I love those parts shots, great stuff in there! This really is a good sign for the new line, hopefully there'll be the same level of usefulness in the others. Thanks for taking the time to finish it up! Did you scan the back of the instructions?	positive

Nice review, VBBN! I stumbled upon your yellow seat as well. Didn´t you have one already or what made you think it´s new? The big letdown on this set is the big canopy. I would have preferred single bricks for that. And for this truck there is no real need for a hollow canopy - it could as well have been made of solid bricks. Maybe we get another set with different use of the canopy. This is one of the reasons I didn´t buy it so far. And I´m especially NOT interested in another forklift, I have plenty of those... I agree it´s the best one we have seen so far though.	positive
Today I shall be reviewing 8290 Mini Forklift, which I recieved when I went to TRU to get a technic set. So Enjoy! Set Name: Mini Forklift Number: 8290 Theme: Technic Parts: 89 Price: $10.99 1/Box The box for this set is suprisingly small. It's about the size of a $3.99 set. It shows the Main Forklift, and the set information. The back of the box features the Dragster. A very cool model, and the suspension works perfectly. 2/Contents We have two instruction booklets; One for the Forklift and one for the Dragster. The bags: Here are a few interesting pieces: The long double pin in blue, a bionicle connecter joint, and a yellow L joint. 3/Build We start off build nice and solid, with your average technic build: The following steps build up the detail of the bottom part. Next comes the cab. It's pretty simple yet effective. After that comes the Forks. They work very well, but If you have the palatte on them, and you let go, it might topple off. Hint: Put the edge of the palatte on the small lip on the pieces that connect to the forks. This will hold it on better. The finished Product and palatte: Extra Pieces(keep them, as they are used to build the alternate model): Here is something that I found- how to put a minifigure into the cab. First, remove the side doors. Then, set the fig into the cab, with his arm sticking slightly out the gap. And finaly, seal off the cab. A nice way to put system into technic for your towns. ---------------------------- Parts: 9/10(Loving them all.) Price per part ratio: 8/10(Somewhat Pleaseing) Playability: 9/10: Works in any system town, and has a great dragster alternate model. Overall: 26/30 86% B+ Overall I would definatly recommend this set to anyone, whether you are a system or technic fan, this is perfect. It has great parts, and is pretty cheap. The alternate model is also very good. I hope you all enjoyed my Review! I have made the pictures the requested size on my camera. I look forward to hearing your comments.

What that? Looks like a walker! An Imperial Walker? No?€?.. Theme: Space, Blacktron I Set Name: Alienator Set Number: 6876 Number of Pieces: 82 Figures:1 Released: 1988 List Price: £?.99 (It seem no source online has the price) Peeron.com Bricklink.com As always lets have a look at the box first as I?€™m luck to own a boxed version of this set. Walking across a planet with a grid pattern sky! The back shows a great selection of alternative models. After opening the box we find a single instruction booklet Inside the instruction booklet Now we come to the man in the black visor the Mark I Blacktron and black and industrial he look. In my opinion I think he probably has the second best Lego Space torso. Before the focus group decided they needed to be brighter Now turning to the walker itself, it?€™s a simple build which I don?€™t think even I with my great skills for messing up could get wrong. The final unit is built in three key parts. The command pod which is attached to the body by two pins at the back. The walker legs, this is pure design genius. Simply built easy to replicate and no fancy parts. The top section which open to reveal the Blacktrons high-tech tools. Time to put the entire set together, I think you?€™ll agree it looks great for such a simple build. Looking like you could take on the universe. A side view of the finished product. A frontal view of the Alienator What the hell! How did that take down an AT-AT. This is one of my all time favourite Lego Space sets. Actually I didn?€™t have it pre-dark age and only recently bought one. What attracted me to it was an old boxed set, but since then I?€™ve discovered a set that I wished I?€™d owned long ago. The Rating System Figures: 8/10 (I love the dark industrial space look) Parts 7/10 (Yes it may be nearly all black with some yellow highlights, but is have a good range and they fit to make several great models.) Fun Fun Fun 8/10 (It walks well and it?€™s a great set, it has a large number of possible mods.) Design 10/10 (It?€™s ingenious the walking mechanism is so simple and yet so good I can?€™t fault it Price ?/10 (While I could tell you how much I paid I was luck on ebay so this remains a question mark) Grand Total 33/40 (Reduced top level due to lack of price knowledge) Conclusion. A set which in my opinion showcases what Lego was about in the 1980?€™s. The set has an excellent design ethic and looks great, with very limited parts it retains great action and functionality. Twinned with the great main model you?€™re shown that there are a number of other great models you can make with the same parts. This set is what it?€™s all about for me, I?€™m very glad I bought outside my normal theme when I saw this. Actually on the strength of this set I recently order 6894 Blacktron Invader and can?€™t wait to get it and see if it lives up to the Alienator.	neutral

csiquet, on Aug 28 2008, 05:27 PM, said: I've built the Y-Wing and the Imperial Landing Craft (7659) more or less at the same time and, for about the same prices, I think the Imperial Landing Craft (ILC) is much superior to the Y-Wing. The Y-Wing doesn’t have much functionality besides an awkward dropping bomb device and a moving cannon. The missiles firing system is … your fingers. The ILC has an awesome missiles firing system (I wish I could get it individually for MOCs), a clever bomb dropping mechanism, 5 minifigures with weapons, the wings fold up together and the “cargo” can be detached as a play set. I’ve built the ILC first so I got quite disappointed with the Y-Wing. You've got to be kidding? The ILC is bulky and doesn't even come close to the design superiority of the Y-Wing. It's smooth, it's beautiful and it's awesomely designed by the designers at LEGO. "It's got greebles, man!"	positive

I think it is a fair to ask questions here with the expectation of a new Y-wing in the coming year. I came here to look at the review even though it is a few years old. No images to go with the review. Bummer. I'd like to see a more friendly tolerance on dated threads being bumped.	neutral

Finaly we get a new Mech for takeshi. And yes, it's yellow. It brings back some flashbacks of Supernova. Good times. Anyways, I recieved this set at christmas last year, with 3 other EF sets. Set name: Assault Tiger Number: 8113 Pieces: 163 Theme: Exo-force Year Released: 2008 Price: 15.00 USD, 18.95 EUR 1/Box The boxes this year are much different than those from previous years. It has some gaps in it, and has a cardboard backround inside of it. The box itself shows Assault tiger and the set information. The back shows a combiner. The cardboard backdrop: A very nice jungle look to it. It has lots of fog as well, creating a pale effect. 2/Contents The instructions: The instructions are clear, and straight-forward. Also included is a lego "blooper." The remains of the sticker sheet: The stickers aren't too bad. I didn't apply the saw sticker as I wanted it to be left plain. The buzzsaw: A VERY cool piece. Mocists will love this. 3/Build The figures: The figures included are Takeshi, who features a nice new torso. Also included is the mini robot. His is a very neat little guy, but sadly, he doesn't really become a weapon. More of a block of red and black bricks. The torso: Now the torso design for Assault tiger is very different from the past years. It now uses a castle-like piece as the main structure. Also of note is that he has a mini throne. No controls, sadly. And with the orange cockpit piece, it's impossible to see takeshi when looking at the AT close on. See the third pic. The legs: The legs are slightly similar to the MT-201 Ultra drill walker's, but have been modified to fit the AT. They are quite large, and suit their purpose. The arms: The arms follow a new design, but the only problem is, they have no elbow or hand articulation. Nice weapons though. The finished product: ----------------------- Parts: 10/10 (lots of useful pieces, great colors, and some very cool new pieces.) Minifigs: 8/10 (A robot would have been nice, and a better weapon mode for the mini-robot would have been good.) Price per part: 7/10 (A stretch...) Playability: 8/10 (The lack of elbow and wrist articulation isn't the greatest. Overall: 33/40 82.5% B- Assault tiger is a nice set, but some of those small little things can truly take a toll on the final rating. I think that I would only recommend this set to anyone who wants the yellow, and hardcore Exo-force fans.

What do you mean the troll’s should outnumber the Crown Knight? How are you going to manage that? Well here’s the answer. Theme: Castle Set Name: Troll Warrior Set Number: 5618 Number of Pieces: 19 Figures:1 Released: 2008 List Price: £2.50 (GBP) $3.50 (USD) 2.99 (EURO) 5618 Peeron.com 5618 Bricklink Catalog 5618 Shop At Home Lets us begin with the box. The troll warrior and his might cart. Set sets for children to pester for at Christmas. Now for what’s inside. The contents of the box, it doesn’t look like much. Now for the troll himself, I’m glad they selected this troll torso rather than the other one for the impulse set I think this one is the superior one. Also he comes well armed with a spear and sword but no shield sadly. Someone really needs to look at the rodent problem in the Castle sets.. Now the cart, nice easy construction as with all impulse sets, I’m still not convinced by the flicking missiles. A line of those would do some damage. What an oncoming army can expect to see.. All together now and it looks rather good. So there we have it a cheap way of bolstering the troll army and outfitting them with some more weapons. Also for anyone planning a Pied Piper MOC another set with a rat in it. The Rating System Figures: 8/10 (|Preferred troll torso and helmet style. ) Parts 7/10 (Two spears and a sword but sadly lacking that all important shield.) Fun Fun Fun 4/10 (Somewhat more to do on it’s own that other impulse at least the troll can fight the rat!) Design 7/10 (Well designed even the flicker missile doesn’t look bad) Price 8/10 (At £2.50 more than the other castle impulse.) Grand Total 34/50 (Lack of a shield and to small to stand alone for my rating system..) Conclusion. Castle fans got a great army builder with The Knight and they’ve been lucky enough to receive another one with this set. I’m glad we’ve got a troll impulse as it allow for enlarging the armies of evil some the Crown Knight don’t totally outnumber all their opponents.	positive
KimT, on Aug 29 2008, 06:55 AM, said: Best Impulse set so far. Agreed, I love this little sets, I can't wait for it to hit shops here. The rodent problem is funny but I lov always getting more animals, so that is a plus. The cart is a nicely formidable machine that I will keep together so I can maximise their fire power.

Nice review and quite funny Now I'll never turn my back on a robot again. Poor set. I find this set bad, even for an impulse,. The robot is poorly designed and without any use.

I love this set... Indy is what got me back into Lego.	positive
I discovered this review a month ago and since that point in time, I could not get the image of the sparkling golden chest out of my mind. I finally just purchased the chest for myself. I suppose this is a testament to how well honed your picture taking skills are. This set is definitely a nice one. I'm not a LEGO Indy collector, but I was tempted to purchase this set several times. The vehicles are very nicely detailed and have some cool building techniques, such as the wheel guards.	positive
I keep looking at this set to buy. Since I have 3 10$ cards now maybe I will go pick it up at the lego store next month. So many things I want.	neutral
Welcome to another sunny day in Legoville...Today we will be joining the Mailman on his daily route delivering the day's mail. When I first saw this set, I immiediately liked it.I think TLG should make more of these everyday life type sets such as delivering mail, going to the grocery store, things like that. Anyway, enough blabbering, on to the review! 7731 Mail Van Set Name: 7731 Mail Van Year: 2008 Theme: City Pieces: 66 Price: $7.99 pounds 4.99 Euros 5.95 Price Per Piece: About 12 cents We'll start with the box shots. The box is an interesting shape that I have never seen before. Very rectangular. The box art is pretty nice. The back shows the mailman delivering some mail. The picture on the front is the same as on the box. Random manual shot. The manual does not have the piece call outs, but on a small set like this, I don't feel it's needed. Parts list. Decent selection of parts. I really like the mail pieces. Image at the back of the manual showing all of the Cargo sets together in a little scene. I like it when the manuals have images like these because it's nice to see all of the sets together. All of the parts spread out. The parts in this set are pretty good. Unfortunatly the car base is one large piece, however, we do get 2 printed mail pieces which are always nice. Our trusty mailman. This torso I think is very nice. The little envelope is a nice touch. Extra parts. Not much to say here... The finished set! I really like the design of the van. It looks very smooth and somehow looks very LEGO to me. The colors are my favorite part. The red and yellow look nice together A nice mailbox. However I wish the letter on the front was printed. The front of the van is nice I think. The textured brick on the front gives it a different look on the front which is nice. The back of the van. The doors open to store mail, although it doesn't have much room, I like that they included this feature. Delivery! The mail bricks slide right into the hole at the front. This adds nice playability. The van's all loaded up! We are ready to deliver! ======================= Parts: 7/10 (Pretty good piece selection, but for $8, should have included a few more.) Playability:8/10 (It's fun to deliver the mail to all of your town's residents.) Design: 9/10 (The design is very nice, except I feel that some of the stickered parts could have been printed.) Overall: 24/30 After a long, hard day of delivering mail, there's nothing like enjoying a nice pizza and letting your hair out. Why do they make us wear those silly hats anyway... This is a nice set that I can definitely recommend and I think TLG should certainly release a post office to go with this and the Air Mail set. I really like these everyday life sets rather than always fighting crime or putting out fires. Those guys have normal lives too! Brickshelf folder: http://www.brickshel...ry.cgi?f=338718	positive
Good review, thanks! For the mail van, while it certainly adds interaction and fun to a LEGO town, it alone lacks details and playability, and thus not a good set, especailly taking its price into consideration. Its value is pretty much just like, if not less than, some impulse sets, in my opinion...	negative
Thanks for that very nice review, Erdbeereis1. It´s great to see some other City sets beside the usual hospital, police and firefighter mayhem, and this is a really nice little one. Now give me some car doors and a Kevin Costner-like MF and I´m a happy camper indeed, TLC...	positive
I do like the set also. I've bought 2 of them. One to build it up and one to keep it MISB (I dunno for how long ). Only poor things is that the wheels are too wide. Car is 5nops wide instead of 4. Afterall a good design. I wonder if there's a post office coming soon. By the way, great review.	positive
What an outstanding review of a great set. I esp. like your intro. I have this set, but have not opened it yet. It looks like a fun little beach set. The new Coast Guard theme is very nice! EDIT: This set could almost pass for Classic Town, except for the use of orange and the lack of opening doors on the car. 5 stars!	positive
I am not a fan of City/Town/Train-stuff. But this is a very good review, that almost makes me wish I had the time (read: money) to purchase some of the coast-guard sets.	positive
I agree that this is a very good looking set. I just finished building mine yesterday, and I love it. But here is one suggestion. Trim the large sticker that goes on the roof of the vehicle by cutting along the angles at the front of the sticker. If you use it as it is, it will extend beyond the "flat" surface of the roof and will overlap the lower sections. Past experience with stickers has suggested that this sticker will "lift" at the front corners. Lego stickers are probably the best that there are, but sometimes modifications must be made. Now I want that large Coast Guard helicopter, #7738!!!	positive

Technic Rotation Joint Disc set list. It's used in 10 different sets so far, not exactly a new piece A nice review with many good comments. I really like this set. It's one of the walkers with really good design and a lot of playability. It's the usual issue of using too many technic pieces to make a moveable feature versus minifig-scaled design. The same issue concerns for example the AT-AT, The Twilight and the AT-TE (plus more sets). What annoys me in this set is the use of the 2 tan 4x8 plates. They "stick out" and it would have been better if they (the designers) had used dark grey or light grey plates. Also I'll add this to the inventory - now!	positive
Product: 7681 Separatist Spider Droid™ (SSD) Theme: Star Wars: The Clone Wars No of pieces: 206 Release Date: 26 July 2008 RRP: SGD59.90/USD29.90 Availability: Lego Shop@Home, Target, Toys 'R' Us (Worldwide). Quote Conquer the galaxy, one planet at a time! Unleash the power of the Separatist Spider Droid™! This towering engine of mechanical destruction from the Clone Wars strides across hostile terrain on four independently positionable stilt legs, then uses its movable laser cannons to blast Republic forces. Includes Commander Fox™, Clone Trooper™, Battle Droid™, Super Battle Droid™ and Battle Droid Commander™ minifigures! Rotate the laser cannon on top! Laser cannon underneath bends to change direction! Measures 6" (15cm) tall and 10½" (27cm) wide! Also known as the homing spider droid, this is what I would usually reckon as a mini-fig set if not for the high price point. Since there's a total of 5 mini-figs to be had, and at least 3 of them are going to be high sought after.(Commander Fox™, Clone Trooper™, Battle Droid Commander™). At first glance, it looked like there's only 3 packets. Actually, it's a total of 4 packets, 1 of the packet is inside the biggest packet. It's not a very complex build. Took me around 25min since I was playing around with the mini-figs more than I was building up the spider droid. Though finally, here's the completed build-up. Usually for lego products, what excites me are the vehicles, yet this set is the other way round. Yes, the mini-figs are definitely the crowd-pleaser this time. On with the review. Here's the close-ups of the droids in the following order, Battle Droid Commander™, Battle Droid™, & Super Battle Droid™. There's not much to comment on the droids, except that the battle droids come with the new arm that's able to hold the blaster properly upright. The SBD is the same dude that can be found easily in the previous droid battlepack. And now the good part... Clone troopers. And that's commander fox, and his trooper. I was quite mystified by the amount of accessories given to the clone troopers as per the instruction booklet, as there wasn't any indication of what they were... (commlink, grenades, sensor scope, range finder?!?) Then it hit me... real hard. Notice anything yet? Yup, it's a night scope, and a range finder. That, plus the visor that's available to Fox too. Now, this is really a good time to start troop building for the clone wars. :twisted: Here's the weaponary. Of course, let not forget the main dude... Fore: Port: Aft: Starboard: The SSD looks very similar to the actual screenshots from AOTC, though am still wondering what's that little translucent red piece for... A re-enactment. And a comparison. This set is really either a miss or a hit. For me, it's a hit, due to the mini-fig count, and the wide array of accessories. It's going to probably be a hit depending on the movie that's coming out this month, since we have commander fox here(I heard that C.Fox hasbro figure is a Target Exclusive, meaning it's gonna be another highly sought after). This set is also stated to be a limited edition, and seeing as how it's only available so far in only 1 toys r us in sg, this just might not be available anymore after the movie starts. :D Comments: This review was done immediately after the Launch of the clone wars toys at the midnight launch on 26 July on a local starwars fan forum. And after having caught the movie only yesterday, I now only have this to say, "It's not part of the movie!?!". Oh well, Cmdr. Fox probably will fair better once the TV series starts proper. Then again, that less-than-one-minute cameo of him, I do find it unforgivable. This being the 2nd review available, I sincerely hope you guys enjoy it.	positive

There's plenty of reviews in the Review Index. (Pinned topic)	negative
well now we at least know that we can avoid that set ;) Johan	negative
Thanks for the review. Considering the price, I give it "Below Average". I didn't buy any of the space impulse sets as I don't think they are good value.	negative
I rated this poor due to the fact the set is unimaginative (looks like a bunch of plates where thrown together) and it just isn't worth the money LEGO is asking for it, IMO. I've never been a fan of the non-articulated "jellies" so I'll leave my disgust for them out of this post. However, unlike the set, the review is a fine work of art that clearly depicts the goods and provides valuable insight/opinions about the set's playability, usefulness, and overall value.	positive
You you got it mint in sealed box? It indeed is a nice set. I am not into Space, but nevertheless this set is a good addition if you need to get your space environment a little bit more crowded. LEGO however is planning to release a minifig set again next year (city) and of course the advent calendars are also quite nice to get some figs with accessories.	positive
Fantastic review! This is one of the classic minifigs pack which is so great for gathering massive number of minifigs. I miss those days where they sell 5 minifigs together in a set. Thanks for this lovely review.	positive
Nice set, lucky you! The only reason I buy the MM impulse sets is lack of good space minifig packs like this nowadays ...	positive
Thanks for sharing this review with us. I think this one of the sets. In Europe this thing is waaaay overpriced and thus makes it a crappy set. We pay nearly double the US price. So I rated it poor. Also because the figs included does not make it great. The Hailfire is well designed and looks great, but that's just about all there is worthy of a positive mentioning. Sorry. [on a side note: As a bronze-awarded student, where's the price in EUR and GBP? And where's the poll?] [Nevermind the poll, I've added that one for you ]	negative
Great review. I agree that this set is underrated. The Hailfire is supposed to be a little taller than two battle droids, so scale-wise it's nice. The dwarf spider droid is amazing in my opinion. I just wish it wasn't brown, it makes me feel like it's on Geonosis. We never saw a grey varient of the Hailfire, so it's fine with me that it's brown.	positive
7681: Homing Spider Droid (LIMITED EDITION) Number of Pieces: 206 Number of minifigs: 5 Price: 34.99 USD/ 29.99 EUR/ 19.99 GBP Theme: Star Wars: Episode II Year Released: 2008 Brickset Folder Bricklink Catalog Welcome to my sixth review on these boards, of the mighty Homing Spider Droid. At first glance, this ball on legs may not seem like much, but hopefully this review will change your mind. The box. This box is the standard for all of the new Clone Wars sets: sleek, shiny, and a right-out-of-the-factory look. The blue-and-white color scheme is fantastic, and portrays that the sets are based off of a cartoon well. This box has a "LIMITED EDITION" (in Spanish, too! ) seal slapped on the front, although you won't have trouble finding this in your local Toys "R" Us, because of the big Clone Wars display in the front of the store that you can't miss. Overview In this picture, you can see the contents of the whole set (minus the instruction booklet) built. You can spot five minifigures (which I'll get to later), and a very tall CIS weapon, known as the Homing Spider Droid. This weapon of destruction is a must-have for your CIS army, although the color scheme (mostly dark bley and light bley) is a change up from the regular colors (brown or blue) of the CIS. This may have something to do with the blended armies of the Trade Federation and Corporate Alliance, but I don't know for sure. The instruction manual is very thin, only about twenty pages. Homing Spider Droid This is the main part of the set. Four huge legs, two mounted guns, and a red sensor eye are the highlights of this artillery unit. There's not many playability factors to this one, but sometimes its just fun to squash the little clones, a change-up of the contrary. It also looks good next to all of the other CIS sets, but you might want to clear some room in your display area; the legs take up a lot of room! This thing is also massively tall, about the same height as the Republic Cruiser. Main Body This is the main body of the spider, which has no cockpit and is remote controlled. This spherical body (not in that sort of way...) is a very quick build, and features a big, red eye connected by a red stud and hinge. Top Gun Here is the top gun (not with Tom Cruise), which is connected to the body using a clever Technic system (pun not intended). As you can see from this picture, you can see that it can rotate a full 360 degrees, but only if you remove the eye. Also, the gun can be pulled back, and if you let go, it will snap back, like the a gun does when fired, due to the force of the shot. I'm not sure this was intended by TLG, because it wasn't showed anywhere on the box or in the manual. Lower Gun Here is the gun attached to the under body of the main part. It is attached using a hinge, which allows it to move up and down. I also like the cord (that presumably transfers power) included on both guns. Hips Here is one of the hips attaching the legs to the body. There is one on each side, with two legs each. The are attached to the body and legs with Technic pieces. Legs You can see the tall legs in this pic. They are basically just Technic poles and connectors. Feet This is one of the feet, the essential to balancing the whole vehicle. These and the legs are repetitive, so I suggest doing them all at the same time to avoid flipping back in the manual and repeating the process three more times. The picture speaks for itself for the design of the feet. All are connected to the legs using a double-holed Technic piece. One Massive Son of a Gun This thing is so tall! It frightens the skin off of even the toughest, most experienced soldiers. Run for your Lives!! Look at how much havoc and fear it causes! Family Photo Enough of the battle scenes, here is a shot of this spider with it's smaller cousin: the Dwarf Spider Droid. Minifigs Finally, here are the minifigs that come with this set. There are five in all, which include: Battle Droid: Nothing special, but still an addition to your army Commander Battle Droid: I love that yellow torso! Super Battle Droid: Again, nothing special Clone Trooper: I'm glad they gave us one in this set, I can add it to to my other Phase 1 clones. Commander Fox: I love it! Everything from the dark red markings to the accessories are fantastic! The head is just the regular anime style Clone Wars face. This set comes with two flashlights, two antennae, one visor, one pauldron, and one kama. Close-up of Fox Here is a close-up of Fox, so you can see the detailed insignia of the Republic Guard. That wraps it up for the review, here is the FINAL VERDICT: Build: 8/10, very easy and straightforward, a little repetitive with the legs. Should take the seosoned builder around 20 minutes. Playability: 6/10, not many play factors, but it's fun to just squash puny clones with this giant arachnid. Swooshability: N/A Minifigs: 10/10, you really can't ask for more in this sort of set! Design: 8/10, not very sturdy, but it is altogether clever. Price: 5/10, yes, it is limited edition, but pumping up the price fifteen dollars more than it should be is a little ridiculous. Overall Score: 8.5/10, An excellent set for display, although not very sturdy. Minifigs are superb, but the price could be better. In the end, I would highly recommend this to any Prequel Trilogy fan looking to build up his/ her army. Well, that's about it for this review, Please feel free to leave your opinions!

KimT, on Aug 30 2008, 05:27 PM, said: I just bought this set the other day and I must admit that it gets a "Below Average" from me. The price is not corresponding with what you get. Which would be implied, had Jim added the EUR or GBP price in the info[hint hint ] The spider droid is flimsy at best. Making it stand or even move without tumbling over is hard. Also why the brown cylinders on the legs? Keep the colourscheme clean, please. The figs are fine, except that I dislike the clone headgear and the fact that the helmets now have holes in the sides, allowing the flesh head to show within = Goofy looking. I am soo replacing the clone heads with black ones. Great review of an acceptable set Aw, that's too bad, KimT. While I must admit it is flimsy, I still love this set. Oh yeah, I added the other prices, thank you.	positive
I love the look of this set it's the closest to getting a Walking Eye from The Venture Bros. As well as the Droids and Troopers :)	positive
I like the theme very much, but sadly, I don't own any sets of it. It brings such a great feeling, it's fresh and has great parts and sets. And it brought the polar bear! Your review is very good and informative, thanks! (I voted wrong, I meant above average, but I clicked below average )	positive
A very nice review! I really miss the Arctic theme. I didn't own any of the sets, but after looking at the pictures in this review and reading the instructions on Brickleys words and Brickfactory, I want them.	positive
Thank you very much for this review, TheBrickster! I voted both times for Outstanding because: I really the Arctic theme. I only bought the ice sailor but otherwise no sets because of money and place reasons and because I already collect four themes (City, older Castle, Western and Star Wars Old Triology). But a comeback of the Arctic theme - perhaps as addition to a winter sports and winter rescue theme would be very welcome! I really all sets - the little and the big ones. In my opinion they all were very well designed (not too big vehicles, not too little and not minimalitic, great minifigs and very nice and lovely details and accessory). Klaus-Dieter	positive
On this, the first anniversary of the news organization that has become so near and dear to your hearts, EB News is pleased to present a very special feature that we've only added recently: The EB News Review! This is really our third such extravaganza, but the first one to actually be done right, so it's my great honour to welcome all of you to this event. I'm your hostess with the mostest, er, host, ImperialShadows, getting in the way and generally causing mayhem will be Staudie, of course, and actually presenting the review will be cub reporter and senior reviewer, WhiteFang! Yes, the ever popular WhiteFang of the Reviewer's Academy. You know him, you love him, let's hear some applause! *audience cheers wildly* Oh, that's too kind, now how about some for WhiteFang? Name: Airplane Mechanic Theme: LEGO System / Town / City Year: 2006 Pieces: 26 Minifigs: 1 Price: USD$3.50 The featured set will be a 7901 Airplane Mechanic. This is the smallest set ever released in the CITY sub theme, Airport. We will be bringing you to on site experience in the hanger. Today our special guest is a mechanic who is specially trained to handle with jet engine turbines. *Camera Rolls* Aren't our pose look so cool? Staudie, your clothes are still white. Let's just all try to smile until this picture is done. Look at our special guest. He can still smile in that weird position of his. Quiet you! *Interviewing process* I am the airplane mechanic, holding a grade 2 license. My specialisation is to maintain and repair jet turbines of 7893 and 7894 Passenger Planes. We have many mechanics, 24/7, across international airports, making sure that the planes are in safe condition. We are able to maintain from Rolls Royce, Pratt & Whitney and General Electric engines as well. This is the trolley to push the turbine engine around. This model is used for Passenger Planes 7893 and 7894 series. Look at the size of the turbine. It required actually 4 engine turbines like this, to power a 7893 Passenger Plane aircraft. I have all these nice essential tools, to work on that engine behind me. There is a wrench, hammer, oilcan, open end wrench, power drill and screwdriver. *Whistles Innocently* Geez, he thought no one would notice him pushing the engine away? *Testing process* As you can see, the crane is firm and sturdy. It is able to lift the engine at a certain height. Hey get off there! For goodness sake, this is not a rodeo. Yee-Ha! WhiteFang must fixed his loose wires. I knew we shouldn't let him read those Superman comics on break. Give a man a cape, and he thinks he can fly. *the audience laughs* What's so funny? It's dangerous to stand at that position. Staudie, are you done with your measuring yet? Almost there. *Clang Bang Clank* Oof! Get this thing off me! I'll push, you pull! Let's get moving! *CLANG* I think I sprained my pride. No, wait, it's my back. I gave up my pride when I took over this news organization. *Shadows flips the engine, crushing WhiteFang* Get that hook off my head... Guess, we are heading for a commerical break at the moment. Wait up, let me pull the white curtain. That's all, everyone. With me, Staudie bringing the end of the show. ImperialShadows and WhiteFang are currently in the LEGOLAND Hospital where WhiteFang is getting patched up and Shadows is flirting with the nurses, mostly. I really hope you loved this interactive review brought to you by EB News Reviews. Overall, we felt that this was a very good impulse set with a wide range of mechanical tools and an extra turbine to play with. Therefore, we recommend you to get it since it's very affordable. Anyway, every airport need mechanics/engineers to maintain the aircrafts to make sure it's certified to fly. This is too formal. I hate reading it from WhiteFang's script. It's best to do it in Staudie's style. Yo yo yo, whazzup? Er. No, that isn't it either. Um... Thanks for viewing! I hope to bring you another exciting and information review soon, here on EB News Reviews! *Camera Fades*	neutral
2872 Witch and Fireplace Review Theme: Fright Knights Parts: 18 Figs: 1 Price: Unknown (BrickLink $5.00+) Year: 1997 Brickset Peeron Brickshelf Bricklink Ever wanted to turn into a animal, wanted to curse your enemy or just wanted to be rich beyond your wildest dreams. You should go visit the Witch and her Fireplace. She can brew you up a potion for any occasion or purpose. So head down to see the Witch right now. Although this set is from the Fright Knights theme it can easily fit in with any other castle theme due to the lack of specialised Fright Knight parts and printings. The set comes with no astounding parts but looks like the source for our good magician impulse set from the current castle theme. I think I got this as a promo set. Official Pic. The box art for the set has the standard Fright Knight background and lego system logo followed by the set number. Down the left hand side of the box a cat is attempting a head stand. Also I think this box display the contents of the set in an attractive set up as usual. 1. The whole set minifigs and all Here is the witch. On the torso there is a spider amulet which is a little hard to make out due to the low res of the image. The Witches wand is the same as the Bellville fairy wands except in trans red like a lightsaber blade although it is completely useful as a lightsaber. As you have probably noticed the witch has no legs instead she has a slope brick with the dress pattern printed on witch (get it witch-which) looks better than Asajj Ventress' from the new clone wars sets in my opinon. (for this anyway) The Fairysaber (new word) duel. This is the old run down fireplace of the Witch. At the base there are two smouldering coals instead of fire witch (it's not funny any more is it?) doesn't make that much sense seeming as it is a fireplace. The little triangular brick on top doesn't really do anything I also accidentally put the wrong one on while building, it should be a sloping brick. Here are the coals. The old trans orange studs are less translucent than the new ones. I like how they have places them above the main baseplate on a 1x2 plate so they are in line with the rest of the fire place other wise it would look wrong. Here is everything else I haven't covered yet, the crystal ball, the pets and the magical potion vial. The crystal ball is identical to the one included with the Good Wizard impulse form the current castle theme. I like the molds for the cat and the bat although if the cat had some yellow printing for the eyes like the white cat had black for the eyes it would be much better. I think the trans green tube things are a little uncommon but I'm not worried about that. 2. Overall Build: 6/10 Extremely puzzling and difficult do not attempt alone . It's pretty simple but seeming as it has a load of stuff you can move around it is good. Minifigs: 9/10 I really like the witch and it couldn't have really come with anyone else also it came with the wand which is really good too. Design: 8/10 It should have come with some fire and maybe some more orange bricks to put at the base. Parts: 8/10 The minifigure isn't bad nor are the animals or the trans green part. Price: 10/10 I am guessing this was pretty good. Seeming as I think I got this as a promo I gave it 10 because it was free. Playability: 7/10 As wth all impulse sets there isn't much here but at least it comes with some animals to have a fight with or give the witch rabies. Overall: 8/10 If it came with some more stuff for the fire place and the cat was more detailed it would have scored higher but because this set can easily be intergrated with other castle sets it got a mighty 8. 3.

Thank you very much for this review, Skipper 24! I voted for Outstanding since this set is a little but very lovely set. I really it (although I don't own it yet ) since it's very similar to today's Impulse sets: a minifig and some nice additional stuff. And I like the black cat which gives the set a more gloomy atmosphere. Hopefully TLG will include a black cat and a chimney like in this set in the new advent calendar, too. Klaus-Dieter	positive
I chose above average. It has a great minifigure.... I wish I had it....someday I will!	positive

Skipper 24, on Sep 1 2008, 12:21 PM, said: This is the back of the Hailfire Droid. There is a plate with a hole in, I have found only one purpose for this. The Hailfire Droid is the Commander droids war chariot! What do you use the plate for? The plate with the hole in it is for an easy grip when you push it around, I think. Nice review by the way.

Great review of a neat way to bulk up your castle guards and their associated weapons and shields.

I've been thinking about buying this. I haven't bought any Castle sets since KK2. Plus I really need that scared face.	neutral
I was going to get this, but when i rang up S&H, apparently they'd sold out already. Price is a little on the steep side as well, and i can only see it going up on sites such as amazon as the number of people wanting them goes up, which it will it it's anything based on the star wars battle packs.	neutral
How were you able to get three small shields. I only got two in mine. I am going to check the trash just in case.	neutral
I think this battle pack is a little expensive, but the minifig ,their heads and weapons and stuff are very very nice! but because of the price, I'll rate it " average" ^^	neutral
I like your review on this battle pack. But I think that this battle pack was over priced. $12 for this? I am not paying that much for 5 knights.	negative
Yeah I have to admit, you expect it to be wayyy cheaper since: A. No packaging to pay for(baggies and such) B. No liscensing fees(like SW) So why isn't this set a better deal than SW battlepack? Don't look at me, look at TLC(he he it rhymed)	negative
Tanks for the review erdbeereis1 but I don't really need to buy this set since they're are always loads of police sets and it's not as if I need anymore cops, although Stud makes it tempting...	neutral

With his shining armor and weapons, he's ready to defend the Castle against any foe. Includes knight minifigure with armor, shield and weapons! Peeron Inventory Bricklink Inventory Brickshelf Gallery Now to the review! The Box The box is fairly standard and illustrates the set well. The Back The back of the box is just an advertisement. The Instructions The instructions are simplistic, basic, and short. The Back of the Instructions The back of the instructions show the other impulse sets, as well as a few others. The Weapon Rack This nifty little weapon rack holds the sword, the shield, as well as a different style helmet and armour plate. The Minifigure The minifigure is of the standard castle variety, with the basic torso and helmet, and a slight scowl on his face. Accessories/Weapons The set comes with a shield, a spear, and a sword.I particularly like the pattern on the shield Different configurations With the extra pieces of equipment I mentioned earlier, itis possible to turn your figure into something totally different... The Entire Set This picture shows the weapon rack and the knight, ready to ward off skeleton invaders! Overall Build: 9/10 The build is simplistic and suitable for all ages. Design: 7/10 There really isnt much to judge in this category... playability: 8/10 With another minifig, plenty of exciting battles can be made! Minifigs: 9/10 With plenty of customisation options, you can turn this one minifig into almost anything. Price: 10/10 This set is well worth the price tag. Overall:43/50 Conclusion I really enjoy these impulse sets. For a casual lego-builder who doesn`t want to invest top dollar in lego, they are perfect, and for the hardcore fan, you could easily buy 5 or 6 of these to boost your army. This is the best impulse set of the first wave and I highly reccomend that you pick this set up soon, before they are all gone Edited by KimT, 08 September 2008 - 08:03 PM.	neutral
I like this set mostly because it has some very usable pieces, but also because of the amount of minifigures in the set, which is a whopping three and one large animal (skeleton horse). The one thing, however, that I don't like about it, is that one of the catapult operators isn't armed. In my opinion, this would have been a good time for TLG to release a suitable dagger piece (not the kitchen knife) for its Castle line. Great review, by the way, it captured the key elements of this fantastic small set.	neutral
Dark times in LEGO Castle land... The poor knight is being held prisoner in the skeletons' prison carriage. We must help the brave knight on horseback free him at once. Let's ride! 7092 Skeletons' Prison Carriage Set Info Set Name: 7092 Skeletons' Prison Carriage Theme: Castle Released: 2007 Price: USD 19.99-GBP 14.99-EUR 19.95 Pieces: 193 Minifigs: 5 Animals: 4 Price Per Piece: About 10 cents Review Time! Box shots Our first pic is the front of the box, which shows a dark image of the knight attemping to free the prisoner. And here is the back, showing some features. The Manual The image on the manual is the same as on the box front. Random Manual Shot No piece call-outs, but the color distinction is not a problem. The Parts 193 pieces doesn't seem like a lot, but many of them are quite large. The selection is pretty good. Lots of greys and black. Minifigs With this set comes a whopping 5 minifigs which is amazing for a $20 set. The knights are very nice and one has a double-sided head. The Horses Adding to the already large minifig count are the 4 horses. 3 skeleton horses, and 1 great brown horse for the knight. Extra Parts Now, the finished set! First, we have the brave knight on his brown stallion. The horse's head covering looks very nice. And the knight gets a nice long pointy stick. The main event, the prison carriage! The design of this is excellent. With the bionicle piece and the white horns, it looks very spooky. The Tower This part is one of my favorites. It uses white horns to give it a great creepy look. One problem is that there is barely enough room for the 2 skeletons. The Driver Here you can see the driver and his whip. You can also see the bionicle spine. A side view When you look from the side, you can see the great design of the prison. It is placed on tiles for easy removal and looks great with the round white 1 x 1s on the corners. Horses' Harness This is another very well designed portion of the set. The harness attaches easily to the horses and to the carriage. The Prison Look at the poor imprisoned knight. Let's try to free him! The back of the prison hinges down! The knight is freed! Everything Together All together, the set looks fantastic. The carriage has a great creepy skeleton feel, and getting 9 minifigs is amazing. Brickshelf Folder Ratings Price: 10/10 (193 pieces and 9 figs is fantastic for $20) Parts: 9/10 (Lots of good large pieces) Design: 10/10 (Captures the spooky skeleton look very well) Playability: 8/10 (It's fun to try and free the prisoner and the carriage rolls well) Build: 9/10 (Easy but fun) Minifigs: 10/10 (The sheer amount of figs is great and they look great) Overall: 56/60 The future of LEGO Castle... Summary This is an amazing set for the price. A huge amout of minifigs, combined with a great design and good playabilty makes the set a winner. I would certainly recommend this set to anyone that remotely likes LEGO sets. Thanks, and happy building!	positive
Nice review, it seems that you really covered all aspects of this FANTASTIC set. My favorite part about it is probably the fact that you can give almost every included minifig a mount, except for one poor knight . However, another part I like is that the horse includes a plain saddle, which is a nice relief after the overabundance of the gold-plate barding, which is nice, but overused in the early sets. Also, the SW jokes are hilarious! I particularly the running gag with the walker, but I like this one too. Reason for Edit: I made a mistake due to a loss of internet and an accidental post.

Well, indeed looks like a very nice set. Especially the scared knights are very nice ;)	positive
This was one of the first sets I bought from the new Castle theme and I love it. So many figs and awesome skeleton horses in just one set. At the same time you get quite a few usefull black bricks for castle MOCs. Another perfect set in the new world of Castle Review added to the index.	positive
Thanks for the great review! I was going to buy this set this Saturday and after reading this review, I am twice as likely to buy it!	positive
This was my first set from the new line, so I'm rather partial to it. I'm glad to see it get such high praise. It's quite the lovely little Halloween-y set. I wonder if TheBrickster could modify this for his WW Grave Stone MOCs? (Hint, hint, hintedy, hint, hint. ) Edited by Pirates Forever, 13 June 2009 - 02:02 AM.	neutral

This set pulled me out of my Dark Ages. Thanks Lego!	positive
You chose the perfect set for your first poll, Simon! No question this set is one of the all-time-beauties. I rated outstanding of course. I never hat the chance to get a complete copy of this set, but I do own the engine and quite a bunch of monorail tracks. Your very detailed review made me think of getting the whole set some day. Thank you very much for this! I never realized there were so many details included to this set: The snackbar and the telephone cell and all the other nice things. Really strange for a nineties set which often lacked details. The only thing that comes to my mind right now is that the engine looks quite blocky. If the set was released today, TLC would use more of those parts which make a better design imo. And it would fit better to the curved walls of the stations as well. [wishful thinking]How much would I love to see the monorail system back again! [/wishful thinking] I had to lough when reading your comment on the minifig seats. Don?t you own many of those? I don?t know where to put mine...	positive
This is an outstanding review which deserved to be featured here! After seeing this set, it prompts me to own this set, and match with my 10159 LEGEND City Airport. It's very nice to see such outstanding set being reviewed and presented to our very screens. Everything about this set is simply outstanding. I can't imagine that such incredible set actually released before. Why don't they ever continue with this anymore? Sigh, it's nice to see so much detailed from its shuttle, snack bar, stairs, waiting platform, validating machine and etc. This is an instant "5" set! If given a chance to own a MISB set, I will defintely seriously consider about it.	positive

very nice review indeed. B.t.w. a lot of children just love this set. One year we had it with us to LEGOworld and children asked a lot of questions about it.	positive
*gasp* BLASPHEMY! Someone voted this set "Below average". *Brings out hunting rifle* Ahem, back on topic; I remember wanting this set badly, for years. And I still want it, just no as much, because it's expensive and, as this review proves, takes up a lot of room. I've already got my trains to think about, and I won't be getting this set anytime soon. I also have a faint memory of this set being featured in one of LEGO's advertisements, more specifically someone narrowly missing it, hitches a ride, races the monorail to the airport and catches the plane. I am yet to find it on the net, as old LEGO adverts are hard to come by, especially the european ones. Now, to more important matters... *starts hunting* Edited by Freddie, 07 September 2008 - 10:03 PM.	positive

Name: Jetport Fire Squad Set No.: 6440 Theme: LEGO System / Town Year: 1991 Pieces: 84 Minifigs: 2 Price: USD 27.50$ (which equals about EUR 19,26€ and GBP 15,57£) Introduction: One of the sets that especially my cousin likes is this one. One time at the Dutch LEGOWorld event we had three of those there with flashing lights and loud sirens trying to put out the fire that was caused by the crash of again some LEGO aircraft. We never had this set before our drak ages and the sets probably came from ebay or so. In my opinion the newest Airport rescue is nice too but in the conclusion I will make some additional remarks about that. Just imagine what it would be like for your LEGO town if the pilot of one of your smaller planes, just couldn't stop before the end of the runway. Here you see the disaster that happened some day in our town: Fortunately all passengers got out safely thanks to our brave fire fighters. This magnificent truck was used to help putting out the fierce fire caused by the aviation gas from the small plane. The set includes two firefighters in distinguishable airport uniforms. In order to be able to safe the passengers and go for a quick intervention, our brave firemen have an axe for each of them, airtanks and a portable fire extinguisher. Here you see the truck on the right side. The large spout on the roof really makes it a remarkable truck. As you can see, behind the red door, there is space for the airtank of our brave firemen, at the right there is also place for the small hand held extinguisher. The left side of the truck has a water hose instead. For a truck from 1991 there is quite some room inside. Actually both firemen fit inside. Unfortunately there is only one seat. At the back there are two clips for the axes. There you can also find the main switch for the light and sound system. As you can see, the red flashing lights, do their job quite well. The sirene is just behind the bar with the flashing lights. The main spout just seems to begin emitting water. The front of the truck. For some reason there are two hidden spouts there as well. What their purpose is seems unclear but they look nice. KimT suggests that it is for foaming the runway and that is a real option of course. This set can be found on: Peeron Lugnet Brickset Bricklink entries Playability: 8/10 (Very nice set, details that are movable and of course the light and sound) Design: 8/10 (nice sets with nice details, but could have even been better: seat for 2nd fireman missing, no oxigen masks and only one airtank) Price: 7/10 (For a light and sound set and two firefighters, the price is reasonable I would say.) Overall: 8/10 (nice sets, some details could even be better, too bad that there is only a five to choose from a sticker when you have more than one truck) Last but not least an overview of the complete set including instructions. "Fire mastered" as the Dutch firefighters will say when they have completed their job. We have also bought the newer airport rescue truck (7891). However we think this 6440 one is much better. The light and sound, all the nice features and the nice details are much better than the new truck. Edited by JopieK, 11 September 2008 - 10:25 AM.	positive
A very robust set. The fact that it seats two figs plus has L&S makes it a unique set. I definitely liked the big airport subtheme TLG created in the early 1990s.	neutral
JopieK, I enjoyed this review very much! Your first picture, certainly capture the essence of this lovely set. In reality, I am in the Aviation line, especially aviation safety. Therefore, you re-entact the scene very well. To be honest, I have never seen this set before. This AES (Airport Emergency Service) Fire Truck is certainly unbelievable. I love it very much. It's a pity I never owned this. This is a set which give me a "5". Great job JopieK. I enjoyed viewing your classic town reviews very much. Keep up the good work!	positive

CP5670, on Sep 7 2008, 05:25 PM, said: Nice classic set. Are those hoses around the engine pneumatic tubes? That Technic catalog looks interesting too. I have the catalogs for the next several years but not that one. The most extreme example of this was the engine step in the 8865 set, which uses over 120 pieces by itself. The pneumatic tubes are listed seperately under x188. The classic hose is x467. I think they're just the same with just a single difference: The x467 seemed to be already cut in lenght instead of x188 which must be cut in lenght. mFg Widdi	positive
Name: Electric Passenger Train Set No.: 7725 Theme: LEGO / SYSTEM / Trains / 12v / Train Set Year: 1981 Pieces: 485 Minifigs: 1 Price: USD 70.00$ (which equals about EUR 50€ and GBP 40£) Introduction: Our most favorite theme is 12V trains. Actually I got my first 77-series back in 1981 (5th of December, I was 2,5 years old) just a week before my brother was born. Some years later I got the 7740. After our Dark ages we (my brother, cousin and myself) got all 12V trains at least once. This 7725 was gathering dust in my brothers' room. The train in all its splendor. As you can see it doesn't occur at the back of the 12V era train instructions although its larger brother the 7740 does. Some investigation learned that all the sets at the back of the instructions date from 1980 so the 7725 wasn't released yet. Here you can see the front of the 7725 with the driver in the cockpit. The driver is in fact the only minifig that was included in the set. As you can see, our version of the train has a different front than the one in the instructions. Apparently the former owner used 7861 (Lighting Set (12 V)) to upgrade the train with working back- and frontlights. I like the original lights but didn't notice that the train had those double lights until I did the review. Maybe we will give the train again it's original signs and put custom LEDs in it or so so that the train can drive into two directions with accurately working lights. Another thing about the lights that puzzle me are the Backlights. While typing this I realise that the former owner might have added those, so let's have a look at the instructions then. As it turns out, the lights are there also in the instructions. I recently learned that only the last car or coach of a train has it's red lights on. So unless the train drives with only the front car it will never use those red backlights. Here you can see the cockpit with the engineer. The cables don't look very pretty but well, the train at least has working light. Here you can take a look at the inside of the engine car. While the 7745 has a nice 'fake engine' there, just the weight bricks and the ugly cables, apart from the engineer and his cockpit, no other nice features here. B.t.w. LEGO always used tiles in such a trains to make it easier for kids to take off the roof and have access to the minifig passengers etc. Here the 'proof' that it is an electric train. The pantograph of the front car. It has the same kind of panthographs that the 7745 has. The middle car has 4 chairs. As you can see, some vandal must have nocked over this one. Hope they leave the cables alone. This early morning train seems to have one passenger: a workman. I like the small 2x3 windows from this car very much! They give this care a nice look. Also the door in the middle adds something special to the train. As far as I know, no other passenger train has the doors in the middle. Here you see the side of the train, just after the train has left Brickingham Station where the worker, probably from set 6647 (Highway Repair) that was also released in 1980. A closeup of the last car with steering stand to allow the train to travel back and forth without having to 'make head', in other words: putting the engine in front again. The train, shunted to an end track so it can be cleaned (I think it is apparent that it definitely needs cleaning very badly). This set can be found on: Peeron Lugnet Brickset Bricklink entries Playability: 5/10 (The train is fine, but with only one minifig not very playable without other sets; also no accessories at all!) Design: 7/10 (Nice train, the inside could have been a lot better, but I really like to original front lights!) Price: 7/10 (the train came with motor so not a bad price, goes now for quite some money at eBay.) Overall: 6.5/10 (nice set but the 7745 is a better train I'm sure) Well that was it for today. I hope you have enjoyed this review and got tears in your eyes seeing how nice the 12V era was... It never comes back, but maybe LEGO rereleases some of this sets in the 2009+ train era (very likely that this is just wishful thinking). Edited by JopieK, 12 September 2008 - 04:56 PM.	neutral
A very nice review, JopieK! You know, I was wondering how LEGO could justify having two 12V-powered passenger trains at the same time, but after reading the review, and seeing the lack of figures and accessories, I guess I understand why (plus the train is rather compact). Oh, and I can't help but think that the chairs in the middle carriage are somewhat oddly placed, because those placed next to the door are unusable because the door takes up room needed for figs' arms. Also, it appears that your set also has the newer couplers, i.e. there's no hooks for the decoupling rail to grab hold of. With the light assembly it really won't matter, play-wise, or if you don't have any decouplers, but it's still a bit of a bummer.	positive

The chair was just loose so it should be placed on the 2x2 plate that is also visible in the picture of the middle car. B.t.w. the front magnet is the old type. I have some decouplers but we don't use them because they are not really that reliable. LEGO just release a whole line of trains at the same time. I just discussed with my parents and they told be LEGO had those sets longer in store back then. I must have gotten the 7745 somewhere in 1983 or even 1984 although it was released in 1981. I started of with the 7710 (push along train) and then upgraded the tracks with current rails when I got the 7745.	positive

Beach Cruisers Set #: 6445 Theme: Island Xtreme Stunts Year Released: 2002 Piece Count: 97 Minifigs: 2 List Price: $7 (USD) During a trip to Legoland California in 2002, their Big Store had a neat little display of some new sets and themes including Island Xtreme Stunts. The new theme offered great colors including orange, tan, and light blue; which immediately caught my eye. The theme focussed on island fun with some adventure, and included some great figs like the Brickster. I had to buy at least one set choosing Truck & Stunts Trike (review coming soon) at the time. The theme was short lived and many of the sets were on sale at discount toy stores not too long after their initial release. I picked up this set, 6445 Beach Cruisers for $3.33 (USD), which will be my first of three Island Xtreme Stunt reviews. Starting with the box, a race between the Street Surfer and Skate Boarder: The back shows some alternate models including a sail boat and jet ski: Same image on the instructions as the box: But the backside shows the Island Xtreme Stunts video game for different platforms: The set includes a small decal sheet for the skateboard: I love the two figs included within this set. One is a "hippie-type" with shades and leafed muscle short, and the other "Pizza Boy" skateboarder. Check out the "Pizza Boy" on his skateboard: Two green brackets are included for attaching each fig to the long grey bar. Using this piece, one can make the skateboarder do tricks and flips. The "street surfer" vehicle is pretty nice to: The sail is placed on a black bar and lance, then attached to the vehicle: Here's a picture of the vehicle. To me, it has that old "soap box derby" look to it - like something kids would create to race down a hill: The vehicle doesn't have a steering wheel, but rather two levers which I think work well in the cockpit: Here's the underside: The set has three neon orange wheels that attach to technic axle pins to attach to the vehicle: Lastly, the entire set with a few extra pieces: Final Thoughts While Island Xtreme Stunts is not the best City/Town sub-theme, esp. for the traditional Lego Classic Town fan, it does have some fun sets like this little beach cruiser. Good figs, a skateboard, and a very "rollable" (fun word equivalent to "swooshable" but for vehicles with wheels), vehicle. You can even blow on the sail to get it to roll across the floor. This set is a lot of FUN!	neutral
I had never seen these sets before in my retail stores before. However, I do remember the existence of its video games. Look like an interesting set for great outdoor enterainment and fun for LEGO citizens whom is out for real thrill and excitement. This theme never really got me excited back then. After reading your review, it's quite useful for some new addition to your town features, such as including a skater boy, holding the pizza instead of using the pizza van. The high fuel cost must have caught up to them, to resort using skate board for delivery. As for the street surfer vehicle, it's a cool looking vehicle with unique construction. Pardon me, I have not seen such design before. I will actually tear off the wheels, cover up the sides and used it for wind surfing! That's the whole idea. After giving some thoughts and weighs its factors, I will have to give it a "3" for this set. I will probably get it if its on sales. Once again, Brickster this is a lovely review which has showed us a new perspective of Island Xtreme Stunts.	neutral
Like WhiteFang I too only remember this line in computer game form. I used to love that game! I actually have never seen a review for an xtreme stunts set, so this was nice to see. As for the set, I think it looks pretty good. I really like the hippie guy. The windboard thing is nice as well, but looks a bit strange somehow. I give this set a solid 3 out of 5. Thanks for the nice review! Edited by Erdbeereis1, 08 September 2008 - 04:05 AM.	positive
Air Chase Woosh! The Brickster's seaplane flies over the beach quickly. Hippie Dude is in close pursuit on his hang glider. Fuel is running out for the Brickster's plane. Can Hippie Dude catch him before he either gets away or crash lands in the water... You decide, with Island Xtreme Stunts Air Chase. Set #: 6735 Theme: Island Xtreme Stunts Year Released: 2002 Piece Count: 83 Minifigs: 2 List Price: $10 (USD) A nice addition to the Island Xtreme Stunts theme, Air Chase includes two air vehicles; a seaplane and hang glider. The set has nice Island colors inclusing white, light blue, and orange. Also includes in the set are some great chrome pieces for the Brickster's airplane wings. Starting with the box. You can see Hippie Dude in close pursuit: The back of the box depicts some nice alternate jet skis: Same front box picture on the instructions: And on the backside, pictures of the video game: Air Chase includes two nicely detailed figs, Hippie Dude (for lack of his official name), and the Brickster: Here's a picture of the orange hang-glider: And the underside: Unfortunately, the hang-glider is too heavy to be held up by a minigig. While I like the brick-built glider for the extra pieces, the plastic wing pieces from the Ninja theme would have worked effectively and be a lot lighter. I think the seaplane is the best part of the set: Here's a shot of the front end. I like the skeletal shark/fish design. What's great is none of the pieces use stickers. They are all printed: Including the tail end: Although the cockpit has no steering wheel or lever piece, it does have a very nice printed 1x2 tile: The wings of the airplane have hinges to allow them to fold inward slightly: Also notice the nice chrome/silver pieces. Here's a shot of the underside of the seaplane: And lastly, the complete set: Final Thoughts: Air Chase is another one of those "fun" Island sets. Two figs with two vehicles make a perfect combination for creating some dog-fights in the air. At the same time, the Brickster's plane can land in the water to explore other adventure play opportunities. This set is also a nice addition to the Island Xtreme Stunts Truck & Stunt Trikes (6739). The seaplane can be hauled by the large semi-truck included within 6739. Hope you enjoy this review.	neutral
Hello all Eurobricks members and Town Lovers, Today, I will be doing up a review on Glade Runner set. This is a very small set which is slightly bigger than the current impulse set. It's part of the Race theme which involved in land and sea racers back in the early 1990s. I just love these orignal race themes which is produced back then. Name: Glade Runner Theme: LEGO System / Town / Race Year: 1993 Pieces: 29 Minifigs: 1 Price: USD$3.25 An image of a 6513, Glade Runner Swamp race shall begins This glade runner is pretty nice looking with its sleek sports look. Well, for a glade runner in the water, it certainly looks much impressive. Somehow, I felt that the 6513 is aligned with the 6514 Trail Ranger. I always had that perception that both vehicles are brothers and was released under the same year. In fact, Glade Runner was released in 1993 based on Peeron information. I always felt that this set is used for Investigators or Police to used for tracking or search purposes in the swamp areas instead of using it for a race. I will place this set in the jungle, somewhere like Brickster's jungle settings. Although it looks too bright for such serious agenda, but I think it's pretty useful to use it this way. They can rent it from the nearby shop and used it to search. It kind of reminded me of the movie, US Marshals which acted by Tommy Lee Jones and Wesley Snipes. Meet the ace Please pardon his trousers. I did not bleach it earlier. (It was caused overtime without adequate caring to the minfig. Look at this great article on how to protect your LEGO!) The driver wears a green vest with patch pockets on both sides. This is my favourite design during that period. It comes with a yellow lifevest too. As for the 1x4 printed tile with 3 stars shining in front of the runner, it's a very nice printed tile that can be used for other racing purposes in other sets as well. Overall design The built is very simple and yet so realistic. Making use of the aeroplane tailhead to add as the holder for the rotor is smart. The white bricks acting as a platform for both sides to hold the driver to sit onto the centre with the steering wheel at the front. I am very happy with this design. Place the glade runner in front of the fan with a reasonable fan speed. You will see the rotor runs like a charm. Different angles of the vehicle Close encounter with the "Swamp Sharks" coined by Brickster! See you later To conclude, this is a very nice little set that can provide much fun. I don't really used it to race in the waters. Instead, I leave it to my imagination and used it for police investigation purposes such as air crash excerise, search and rescue operations and etc. I think it can provides quite a fun loving experience. Although, the set might not be very appealing to some people, but I find it very fun to play around and is one of my favourite sets in the 1990s where I placed it with my 6514 Trail Ranger together. Summary review Playability: 8.5/10 (I leave it to your imagnination.) Design: 9/10 (Very simple yet realistic design.) Price: 10/10 (A very inexpensive set. Great way to buy such small sets at a low price.) Overall: 8.5/10 (Glade Runner is not common in Town and City theme. It's not a must to have it, but if you ever come across it. Do get it) I gave it a "4" based on my Review Score Card. What about yours? Hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. Comments and Critics are strongly welcomed. Pictures can be found in My Brickshelf (When moderated)	positive
Nice Review White Fang. This really reminds me of an "All-American" set with its Red, White, and Blue Colors (and the white stars). Although I really like the fig with its scruffy bearded face, I find the green torso a bit odd for this set. I suppose I would expect some sort of red/blue racer fig with a white/blue racing helmet. Swamp Sharks - too funny! . You always add a nice addition of humor to your reviews. Now I'm going to check out some Wonder Woman clips on YouTube.	positive
I love the classic sets of that era and a great review helps show off the simplicity of some older sets.	positive
This is one of those sets that make me really want to start building up a city. It's a great value, has a lot of useful pieces, and is just plain fun to play with. I do miss vehicles having doors though. Great review. I was a bit curious as to how the dumping mechanism worked. As well as the sticker count.	positive
Nice review. This is a very nice vehicle, one of my favorite of the newer city ones. JopieK: There are two generations of road plate that are wide enough for six-wide vehicles like this. The current plates are dark grey with plain white printing, and look not great in my opinion. The previous ones are imo the best road plates of all time - green with dark grey road, white dotted line/zebras, drain covers and yellow verge markings (just like we really have here in Ireland). For urban area I would still choose the green-edged plates and just cover up the green - the markings are so much better than the current plates.	neutral

What a great set and a very nice review Erdbeereis. I think the only improvement to this set would have been the use of chrome exhaust pipes and front grill. I bought this set with a lot of excitement, but unfortunately have not put it together yet. What are your thoughts on these larger 6-stud wide detailed vehicles as opposed to 4-stud wide classics? Here's an image of 6668 Recycle Truck released in 1992: PS. I like the use of "taking out" Sponge Bob in your review.	positive
Thanks for the review! This is one of the few CITY sets that I own (despite loving the theme so much, most of my town is either custom or classic), and it's about as beautiful as a big garbage truck can ever be. Quote nice truck indeed, but the yellow one is better I think, at least if you put them on a roadplate it seems to me that those road plates are too small for that. Also it will not empty completely because of that panel. Well, for the rest it is a nice set and a fine review! Well, the truck BARELY fits onto the old roadplates (not on curves though), so if you put it in a display it probably won't look bad. I think from what I see, this and all the other 6 wide vehicles will fit much better on the newer roadplates, which are four studs wider than the old ones.	positive
Hi, I bought this set a while ago, and have since remodeled it into a larger 8 wide truck. Now it can hold a driver and passenger. Its kind of boxy, I may redesign it in the future.	neutral
That's a really nice mod badsneaker! The added bulk serves it well.	positive
