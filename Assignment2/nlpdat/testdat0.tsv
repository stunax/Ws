these plates are great in setting up your space base and giving your ships a place to land my favorite though is the lunar crater plate which i use to death in my comic 	positive
why pay 350 dollars just download the instructions on buy the pieces off bricklink this is was i did when i wanted to create the blacktron ii in the futuron colour scheme also i tend to like both sets of base plates i bought the black ones myself and they were of great use but there more for creating the idea of a city or space station something more completely man made the gray ones give a better look of the roads being laid over bare rock especially when you introduce the plates with the craters i would love to see a 4848 baseplate with roads through them which would allow more building space on the side and maybe some craters also 4848 baseplates with craters but a few different kinds to create more or a realistic look and less of a repeating pattern and with all those rocks you have to put everything up on supports much better looking bases then	negative
cp5670 on jul 8 2008 0504 am said these are pretty good but i think they look too much like the standard town roads from that period i like the black space plates from the early 90s better 6710 oh how i love these plates afew years ago i found a local retail store with about 67 sets of these in their basement warehouse i was given special access to along with many other old space goodies hehe i love the things i have loads and ive used them for multiple space bases and battles along with afew grey crater plates and the large grey plates 15x the size of a normal baseplate you can get quite a monorail layout going sigh i should really clean up and get one set up again so i can take some pictures	positive
great review sinner i own the later version 709 released in 1977 mine no longer has decals though the variations were minimal it looks like your boat is in really good shape considering its 30 years old excellent review	positive
sinner on jul 31 2008 0743 pm said you give a guy a holiday he comes back a comedian its too obvious for my taste words hurt you know	negative
nice review sinner the old sets i donÂ´t know  every old set especially equipped with the old nonmoveable arms minifigs look very odd nowadays i agree with you with the hull shape and its possibility to be extended but every other aspect the lack of detail the keel itself you canÂ´t float it in shallow water keeps me from rating it higher than 310 in my opninion the best police boat so far is 4021 click to enlarge	negative
i love those minifigs theyd go for alot on ebay i bet great boat as well i love the old hull design	positive
this set showed what potential variations on the standard brick had back then i think that tlg was still finding its legs back then and learning new things so this is a solid set for the year it was released nice review sinner	positive
great review i never had this set but it looks nice i really like the checker pattern near the big window	positive
theres two alternates on the back of the instructions and as i recall some sort of bridge on the inner fold or back of box i threw away the box to this set years ago just lucky to still have all the pieces with standard pieces you can build all these alternates and many more thats why i dont particularly care for the new castles like vladeks they make building so difficult and duplicate pieces are so limited heres an old shot of the castle in the city that it use to guard we played for hours back in these days	neutral
yup that is very very nicei wish i had been alive back then d well ill never have a chance to own something like this so this is as close ill get to it thanks for showing me the greatness	positive
question for you guys whats the best way to clean lego i was noticing that the baseplates and gray plates to this set are very dusty and could use a good cleaning mild soap water soak is there a better way	neutral
thebrickster on dec 29 2005 0450 am said snefroe1 on dec 28 2005 0844 am said nice review i havent built yellow castle for many years but i do remember the fun i had building it when i was young yellow castle just opened up an entire new world for me also i liked all the alternate models on the box odï¿½ wish i still had that i found this pic of the inner box this evening in searching for sticker sheets with castles like this one could build a variety of mocs thanks i remember the models for being such a good inspiration for mocs im also impressed by the colors of the shields even a good cleaning wouldnt do that with my old shields have you ever tried replacing the heads by modern heads just to see how that would look	neutral
imperialjohn on dec 29 2005 0206 pm said you might find the stickers here ive searched that page before  it doesnt have the stickers but it has a lot of other useful ones od thebrickster send me a link to a page that has remakes of the good old classic shields and more you can find it here thanks brickster satis  kimt	neutral
ive tried this once remember normal white sticker sheet in an ink jet and the transparent plastic on top  ps the one on the right is the homemade one	neutral
i guess its easiest to put the entire shield on a transparent sticker and cut the edges i would also do that with the white stickers because now you can still see the gray edges of the shield perhaps you can make a bigger black or brown in the other case outline you also wouldnt be able to see if the sticker is exactly in the middle	neutral
quote so youre using two layers stickers doesnt that make it very thick not really i think it works out very fine 1 print out the image 2 put on the plastic 3 cut out the image 4 apply on the part	neutral
indy565 on dec 31 2007 1024 am said wasnt this the first castle lego released hey indy565 we try not to revive old threads imded pointed out how old unless theres something to add now this doesnt mean you can never revive an old thread but just do it when theres a reason  yes i believe it is the oldest	neutral
great review the set is really nice i love that the front of the motercycle can turn and the engine is just beautiful with its half stacked bricks like kieldaman said the price used or new is quite a bit but there is a good variety of bricks here like the bricks inside the wheels did you get this set from your father great review luxorv	positive
wow talk about illegal connections eh great review i really like this set even for its age	positive
luxorv this is a well written presentation on this lego vintage review i never knew the existence of this set and even though the design is not part of the modern lego design concept but the overall appeal back in the 1970s certainly appeal to many i could not mind to own such vintage lego model and put them on display and potray as if it was a chart of evolution of lego motorbikes thanks for sharing and i cant wait to find out your next review	positive
thanks luxorv for this review of such a classic old lego set and i do remember seeing these in a catalogue years ago excellent brickbuilt police cycle i think its time lego did another one eh  brick on ride on everyone 	positive
theme hobby sets set name thatcher perkins locomotive set number 396 price new 369450  258314 euro price used 100355  45250 euro pieces 434 year of release 1976 links peeron bricklink and brickset my father assures me this is the very first lego set i ever got in facts he gave it to me as a present for my first half year of course that is to say he bought it for himself and used me as the official excuse when i grew up at first i found it to be quite boring no minifigures limited play features in the end it was just a locomotive it soon went to forgottenland then when i was about 10 years old i one day found again the instructionsâ€™ â€˜bookletâ€™ and saw this bright coloured big steam engine and i suddenly wanted to build it again it would seem i finally got to the right age at least for me to appreciate the design of this great set but enough about memories letâ€™s start with the review the box front the front of the box here cut and folded to save space shows the thatcher perkins locomotive in all its glory upon a nice countryside landscape i really appreciate how tlg box designers used a real life environment made of sand gravel and pebbles to give this hobby set a better background moreover the landscape does not distract the eye since the focus is strongly set on the locomotive itself the box measures about 395 x 245 x 55 centimetres or 1556 x 965 x 217 inches this is more or less the size of the 4840  the burrow or the advent calendars back and sides the back of the box shows the model on a more neutral background and from another angle we can see the stickers in place take a good look at them here because i did not apply them the right side we also see a pic of the set from the 34 back and one with a child playing with it in this latter shot the model rests upon a nice black box with a thatcher perkins sign on it unlike the harley davidson 1000cc set the thatcher perkins does not have the sign â€˜designed for experienced lego buildersâ€™ for some reason contents inside this set includes a large number of parts mainly black blue and red with some nice yellow to lighten it up more parts of interest the partsâ€™ selection is not exceptional but weâ€™ll see this set includes some unique pieces which have not been in lego sets for long years since the 1980s like the very nice black plate modified 1 x 2 with steam engine cylinder flat surfaces black train wheel spoked for motor and the red train steam drive rod holder  train steam drive rod group the wheel spoked large as beautiful as they were saw the light from the production line for the last time in 1976 the only new mold used in this set is the black and blue slope inverted 45 2 x 2 old type with round bottom tube as you can see in the above picture this locomotive was designed to work well be played with on all kind of surfaces so the wheels sport tyres in this picture you can see how they look without the tyres of course builders can use the thatcher perkins on their brickbuilt tracks another group of interesting parts are shown in this pic red wheel spoked 2 x 2 with stud and tyre black brick modified 2 x 4 with wheels holder old clear bottom and yellow minifig head plain  stud solid many newer fans will not be familiar with the last two parts they were standard fare in a number of sets between the 1960s and early 1990s but then unfortunately they were taken out of production to be fair the replacement of the black brick modified 2 x 4 with wheels holder old clear bottom with the standard technic parts was probably due to the fact that the metal pin used to connect the wheels to these bricks had a shameful tendency at getting off the wheel too bad it could not be fixed and these parts kept in production for those interested here is a picture of the dss courtesy of peeron instructions cover â€“ as usual the instructions are not organised in the form of a booklet but they consist of a folded double printed sheet the â€˜coverâ€™ shows again the same shot as the front of the box â€˜back coverâ€™ â€“ here we see the name of the set and some additional information like the year when the first thatcher perkins started working 1863 and the type 460 of this locomotive which as shown in the image is related to the number and position of the wheels on a side note the pencil signs on the sides of the sheet were made by my father while counting the parts in the set â€˜random pageâ€™ â€“ as expected no callouts here but the build is pretty straight forward and does not need them the colours are easy to tell apart full page â€“ as you may have noticed all the building steps are drawn on one side of the â€˜bookletâ€™ making it more properly an instructionsâ€™ sheet what really makes this â€˜instruction bookletâ€™ stand out in my eyes is the fact that it is indeed a poster the building steps are all on one side while the other is a bigger image of the completed set with the name thatcher perkins in yellow enclosed in an old styled red tag building start the build starts with the base of the locomotive putting the 10 wheels in place and strengthening the engine notice the use of this â€˜illegalâ€™ technique to build the bumpers lego as we all know can be a tricky medium to build with and some details need special solutions to be completed we then start building the boiler and cabin going up fast and steady in the penultimate step we build the chimney and cow catcher iâ€™d like to spend a few more words on the chimney and how it is attached to the main body as you can see in the left picture the 3x3 base of the chimney is asymmetrical with a 3x2 base on one side and a combination of a 1x2 and a 1x1 plates on the other in the right picture you see the top of the main body where the chimney will be attached it is made of a 1x2 base and 1 1x2 tile using another â€˜illegalâ€™ technique or at least one lego designers do not like much nowadays the holes of the 3x2 plate of the chimney will connect with the studs of the 1x2 plate on the main body giving a well centred and quite sturdy build finished set front the front of the model sports 3 big headlights a nice cow catcher and the nicely detailed engine front i can almost hear it whistle side and here it is our good old thatcher perkins locomotive indeed it looks like a classic and powerful engine form one of those spaghetti western films doesnâ€™t it what i found strange in the beginning is the choice of colours i was convinced steam engines were all black at the time then i checked some pictures of the original and i must admit the resemblance is almost perfect back the back side is less detailed than the front with cabin almost devoid of details i think lego could have done a better job on it 34 front and â€¦ just see how good it looks from this angle with all the tubing moving parts and the lovely 3 headlights â€¦ 34 back the back view is not as impressive but grants us a good look at the big posterior wheels and the bumpers bonus images size comparison as i stated elsewhere i never understood what scale these hobby sets are meant to be they are clearly not minifigscale and they are not technicfigscale either but they are not even miniland scale moreover they use different scales between locomotives cars and motorbikes amongst the hobby set line as i said before the set comes with tyres on the wheels to allow a wider playing experience not limiting this model to tracks nonetheless builders can assemble their own track maybe using the vintage blue 45v tracks and make the thatcher perkins run its proper environment final comments overall this is a great set for collectors of old models and steam engines fans or both it does not sport a huge variety of bricks but was a good choice at the time and even if the result is matteroffact a bit blocky when compared to the original it implements some good solutions to minimise the lego brick appearance and maximise the similarity as much as possible design  colour scheme â€“ 810 the design is as accurate as possible and the colours are completely in line for the thatcher perkins locomotive the solutions and details included in this set justify the â€˜expert buildersâ€™ label and add to the appearance and why not playability of the model though i still wish tlg had included more details in the cabin parts  1010 quite a big selection but only one new mould nonetheless a good source of black blue and red standard parts for mocs and one of the few sources for the extra rare black plate modified 1 x 2 with steam engine cylinder flat surfaces black train wheel spoked for motor red train steam drive rod holder  train steam drive rod group and wheel spoked large playability  910 a sturdy model which can take some serious play and swooshing without falling apart the somewhat easily detachable chimney and the lack of an appropriate scale interaction with most other models make it lose one point though build  710 pretty straight forward with few nice solutions price  510 like most older models especially the hobby set and model team ones this set can only rarely be found at reasonable prices most of the times people are asked shameful prices for such a smallish set overall 810 very good more pictures can be found in this brickshelf gallery as always questions comments and pic requests welcome edited by rufus 10 july 2011  0705 pm

rare classic sets are always a priceless part of any lego collection and its a good thing you still have this first set of yours luxor or did you purchase a new one excellent review btw its always a pleasure getting a closer look at these classic sets which i wouldnt have known to exist had i not seen this review overall i think its a really good set at that time of course judging this one by modern standards wont be fair but at the time im pretty sure it was a cool set to have though less cooler than having the harley davidson set	positive

thank you very much for this wonderful review this is the oldest lego set in my collection i received this model from my grand parents many years ago  im not exactly sure who in my family it used to belong to but it has a home with me now its a very simple but attractive looking vehicle and functions pretty well too overall very nice	positive
thanks for the great nostalgic review great pictures i love the shiny glow of 37 year old bricks sets were simpler back then but not less exciting in their own way i wasnt even born in 1973 but one of my first sets was the 1982 update of this 6630 bucket loader almost 10 years later but the very same bucket assembly only the colours have changed	positive
well its not exactly a large shuttle but still a nice set 442 space shuttle year released 1979 piece count 79 minifigs 1 vehicles 0 list price unknown this little classic was my smallest classic space set believe it or not i still have the box heres the back the instructions are pretty tattered and missing a section i had to download some from the web but the ship is again intact missing only one grey 1x3 plate ive always liked this computer piece heres the under side this set included the small classic jet engines a closeup of the sloped printed space brick and the complete set with minifig this set was a great little space ship that made a nice addition to the blue space theme as small as it was it could hold twothree figs one standing up i dont even think the mars mission recon drop ship holds three figs in any case it was a musthave for blue space fans and probably only a few bucks back in the day swoosh	neutral
nice 442 is the lowest set number i have seen for any classic space set so it must been released with the first wave in 1978 its remarkable that a lego spaceship this old and small can seat more figs than the much bigger mx71 recon dropship of today anyway i just want to grab it out of the screen and swoosh it all over the place lol tlg please make these classic space sets again i promise ill buy many	positive
very brave to give an impression about one of the oldest sets ever reviewed a lot members here are younger than the set itself i think you will have to have grown up with it to like it nowadays we have seen quite a few better airplanes than that one for example this years 7643  but thanks for letting us know btw the 1x1 round brick with the solid stud is no 3062a instead of 3062b with the hollow stud	positive
fantastic review iÂ´d love to read more like this trivia about oldrare pieces is almost as fun as the set itself	neutral
in 1977 trans or yellow slopes existed already and using them would have made the plane more realistic a third rear wheel would have enhanced playability and design rather than this ugly black round brick its the reason why i voted below average even considering 1977s standards however this set is nice and simple offering good playability	negative
im loving that transyellow plate on top of the roof great review	positive
ahh the good old days thanks for the review	positive
thanks i love the look of this set i love the mix of colours it breaks up the model rather than being a single monotone colour hes used several complimentary colours in order to make up the model i agree i think the chimneys on the flat roof is weird ontop of the garage but not so weird one you place it ontop of the building i guess hes done it to give us the choice of roofs and chimneys you can always remove the ones you dont like he also seems to have screwed up a bit on the tiling for the sidewalk on the side module on cafe corner and the building module of this set the sidewalk has the pattern light grey 1x6 at the front then dark grey 1x2 next then dark grey 2x2s however on this hes put the 2x2 tiles first then the 1x2s at the back easilly fixable though overall i love this set thanks for the pics compliments cafe corner perfectly	positive
apophisv on jun 20 2007 1032 am said btw could you exchange the modules and make pics of that id like to see how the building looks with the flat roof instead of the dutch style one im sure that a could do that its a good idea i hope you can wait a few days ill do it this weekend and make more pics then holodoc on jun 20 2007 0322 pm said thank you legocastlegirls for your quick review y its the first time i realize the back of the market street the tan bricks are a replacement for some windows id guess i do love that building especially the top floor with the neat balcony wub of course you are again left alone filling the interior but i just had some food parts ordered at bricklink xd i also think that this is a replacement for some windows and i like this idea because i often see houses with that kind of windows holodoc on jun 20 2007 0322 pm said one thing id like to know this is an onlineexclusive right can i order it at a legostore kln  oberhausen and get the sum rewarded on my voucher booklet sweet i heard it i dont know that this is an onlineexclusive but i know that you can order it at your legostore and when you get it you get the stamps for your voucher booklet at your next visit at the legostore but you have to bring the bill with you barbossa on jun 20 2007 0410 pm said i am totally agree with snefreo1 the yellow cylinder and the lamppost should be on a level above the tiles actually i have put a 2x2 plat under the lamppost on my cc looks much better if you ask me yeah i also agree with snefrooe and you ive never seen holes at the footpath for some lamps it is really dangerous for all the nice little minifigs  greetings sandra	neutral

legocastlegirl on jun 20 2007 0742 am said i know its not such a nice review like yoda did the last times but i hope you enjoy some of the pics nonsense sandra  tks for sharing these cool pics  its also a nice hommage to erik brok i really like this set i think its really well designed with great ideas such as the dual stairs the balconies the croissant insignia the market entrance design with the horns whip and owl 8 i like the color combination and the mosaic design just in front of the entrance the only terrible flaw is that yellow cinlinder  that is just awful for a flower pot x i dont mind at all having that lamp post at the same level since it would be normal to have the base of the lamp at the level of the tile but i agree that is just pickering about an insignificant detail p legocastlegirl on jun 20 2007 0742 am said a funny idea is the salad in the one box at the front i think normally its a hairpiece of an exoforce fig yeay that is just brilliant all the way 8 this is a great set indeed and a must have for town fans  yoda	positive

i bought this set last night and it is great my biggest surprise was the wheels that were included i didnt even know they existed and there arent even that new back to the set he is such a cute dinosaur d since he is so tubby i think he looks like a baby i suspect my wife wanted him more than me my biggest interest in the set was to have more motors and ir parts so i could make an ir car overall i highly recomend this set but as others have said be warned that the box is very oversized i wish lego would give up on this whole 11 picture thing wacko	positive
thanks for the nice review its butt ugly to me but the motors  ir control seem pretty neat  even at that high price it looks like a good parts pack  sweet	positive
mutex on jul 13 2007 1016 am said by the way  i added a nice cool feature on my site  you can download the stickers for some sets that i own before building i always scan the stickers we never know it could come handy check this out on my site you need to go in the lego lists on the left vtx classic games thats a good idea and very nice thanks mutex y nice review hmm now im pretty sure that ill have to mod that cockpit a little when i get that set	neutral
i like the dropship kit and got this now that i built it i see so many things i can do to tweak it to make it a moc i think this is a set everyone mm fan should get	positive
of course right before i post this i see that ickelpete reviewed this set earlier in the week sorry for being redundant but it is already written so here ya go monster dino reviewed by dunamis set 4958 792 pieces 8995 from lego online store build time 35 hours here we go with another offering from the creator line im kind of fond of these sets as they are pretty imaginative and usually have instructions for multiple models i like the reusability of all the pieces and the varied things you can build the box the box that lego shipped this thing in was absolutely huge when i first got this in the mail i thought i had won the lottery and they had shipped the ucs falcon early once i opened the shipping box i was surprised to see an unusually large creator set box the box itself is pretty standard creator type box but this one shows off the power functions prominently on the right side of the box the back of the box shows some of the motorized features as well opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals were back to the reusable cereal box type tab system for those of you who stay up a night wondering about legos next box design inside the box we have a bunch of sealed bags immediately the power brick remote and motors stand out as they are each in individual bags also there are three manuals the manuals the three manuals are 76 76 and 56 pages in length they are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings  piece call outs for each step  parts inventory at the end of the primary model build  page numbers color separation in these manuals were fine for me interestingly the instructions for the primary build took a full manual plus about a quarter of another manual random manual photos parts list ill explain a bit more below but it would have been nice to have some written documentation on all the functions of the motors remote and receiver such as motor load guidelines and specific explanations of all the remote control functions it is severely lacking in this area the pieces obviously the pieces were most interested in are these new motors and wireless remote control note that before you fire this bad boy up you had better byob since this is prominently a european community i had better clarify my acronyms over here across the pond byob usually means bring your own beer in this case it still means bring your own beer im on my second heineken right now but in addition to numerous bottles of beer you will need a total of nine batteries to get through this set i kid you not anyway there are two motors a small and a large each with its own very unique name according to the manual the smaller one is called motor and the larger one is called xl motor very creative indeed the battery box takes six aa batteries and there are two compartments to hold them here is the first that seems pretty normal however the back side of it holds the other three batteries and it seems to be very poorly designed note in the photo above where the bottom battery is placed compare it to the previous photo and you will see the difference i played around with trying to get that bottom battery out and you better pack a lunch or byob because it is no small task why couldnt they make this compartment just like the other side there is a single power cord connector and a three position switch the middle position turns the power off and the other two positions seem to provide the same functionality in either position as far as i can tell perhaps a little blurb in the manual would have been nice to clear things up a bit the remote takes three aaa batteries it is fairly small and lightweight even with the batteries installed it has two thumb controls which could be levers if you insert technic bars or even pins the two controls are color coded and match the plugs on the receiver to control two separate motors in addition there is a four position switch which i assume changes the channel finally there are two tiny levers that seem to have no function im not sure if they are a trim control or variable speed control i messed with them and didnt notice any difference in the motor speed again some documentation from the incredibly verbose lego manual would have helped as far as the rest of the parts its really a mixed bag there are a lot of varied parts in this set to the point that there is almost one of everything lots of technic gears pins studded beams studless beams axles wheels etc also lots of little 1x1 slopes in various colors teeth horns etc you cant really say it is a parts pack because there is not enough of one thing to make it a parts pack a couple of notes it seems the quality control issue on the axles has been fixed i initially reported this back when i reviewed the 8285 about a year ago all the axles worked fine for me the color quality control issue is still alive check out the different shade of red in these two parts also included is the sound brick this looks just like the other sound or lightup bricks we have been seeing lately it does have a load dinosaur roar sound embedded in it though so hide the younglings if they are a bit on the skittish side finally ive never seen one of these before although someone will no doubt rattle off a dozen sets where you can find this part in about 5 seconds no i am not referring to the studded beam i put that in the photo for scale the build the build was fun and was fairly straightforward as i mentioned there is a lot of technic parts so if you are not a fan of the technic line you should run not walk away from this one there were no gotchas to speak of but you need to pay careful attention to the placement of the wires that go from the motors to the receiver they kind of sneak them around a bit so watch closely otherwise it was fine here is what is left over so far i have only built the primary model as seen on the box there are instructions for two more models both of the other models seem less complex than the primary model and are likely quicker builds the dino took me about 35 hours which included some time to screw around with the motors im an old school technic fan from way back in the 80s so i had some familiarity with the old technic motors obviously 25 years has improved some things and these seem much more powerful the design if you have built the 4507 prehistoric creatures then some of the design will feel familiar especially the head and tail it is almost like they took the dinosaur from that set and figured out how to motorize it this is not necessarily a bad thing just a comment the set does a good job of showing off the features of the new motors and remote it is nice to see how one motor can perform multiple functions in this case the small motor makes both arms move and opens and closes the mouth of the dinosaur when the mouth is completely open it pushes the activation switch on the sound brick which emits the roar sound pretty cool the xl motor handles the walking feature of the dinosaur there is both forward and reverse forward works really well while the reverse just makes the dinosaur look like he is doing a michael jackson moon walk wow i never thought i would use michael jacksons name in a lego dinosaur set review it is almost like the dinosaur cant get traction going in reverse however as noted previously forward works really well this guy actually gets going at a pretty good clip as you might expect he kind of waddles like a duck since there is no articulation in the knees it is a bit awkward but it works the xl motor seems to kick out plenty of power overall the design seems to be a mixed bag the way the tail is attached seems to be an afterthought the arms look to be too small however the walking mechanism and legsfeet are pretty cool as well as the head and mouth i guess it is a reasonable effort to get people introduced to the parts and well see designs improve as time goes on here are a few views of our new friend but what about the atat of course the real reason you are reading this is that you hope i will have some epiphany on how all this relates to the new walking atat judging from the box on the atat it looks like we get one motor i dont see the remote which is a disappointment as i hope it is not controlled by a switch on the body and you either turn the atat on or off if that is the case the first thing i am doing is scavenging the receiver and remote from this set to add to the atat granted it could be that it comes with a remote but is just not seen on the box also the atat box looks like one of the images shows that the head turns i sure hope this is controlled separately as it would be really lame to not be able to control this independently from the walking feature im kind of skeptical on the walking feature of the atat i suspect it will be rather cumbersome but hopefully i will be pleasantly surprised needless to say this is all speculation but those are my initial thoughts based on this set overall thoughts its an ok set kind of pricy but i suspect a large part of that is due to the motors and remote i havent built the other two models they seem less interesting to me but at least it has some variability also you get a ton of different parts which can either be a good thing or bad thing depending on what you are looking for the dinosaur is average the color selection is marginal black and lime green and the tail section is just lame i appreciate it more for the mechanical functions and how the motorized parts work it does do a good job of waking up my dog who seems pretty irritated by it it is a nice set to show off to the neighbors or the endless caravan of my wifes friends that seem to materialize out of nowhere people are quickly impressed by it and then promptly move along once you start trying to explain how it all works im a bit disappointed that the manual did not explain more about the remote and motor functions i suspect that there is more than meets the eye and ill just have to play around with it to find out it would be nice if lego had a website that showed all the cool functions of the motors and remotes so we fully understand the capabilities final rating 72 build 910 pretty quick and fun the mechanical part is cool functionality 610 it is a creator set so you have multiple builds as far as it being a dinosaur its just ok motorized parts are cool though design 610 partly cloudy some things are cool others are lame parts 810 new motors and remote are cool lots of varied parts included but nothing to write home about price 710 it is kind of expensive edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0623 pm indexed	negative
great review dunamis i hope you have as much fun with this as i have one point yes they are new axles they have appeared in a few sets this year	positive
ickelpete on jul 13 2007 1106 pm said great review dunamis i hope you have as much fun with this as i have one point yes they are new axles they have appeared in a few sets this year yes the kids seem to love it as you pointed out and the wife still thinks i am crazy so its all good i read your review after i posted mine seems like we shared the same thoughts on a majority of it i always think it is good to have multiple opinions on sets as it gives the community more data points to evaluate a given set	positive
ickelpete on nov 4 2007 0641 pm said if you really want the power functions the bulldozer is better value as you get two large motors two small motors and two receivers compared to the one in the dino set alos watch toysrus and argos both have had the bulldozer for 7075 in there pre christmas sales usually for a week only i am hopeing they will be on sale soon as i want a second bulldozer to get some more motors thanks for the tip but even 7075 is too much right now 55 was just about affordable but now my wifes buying for me its going to cost me zero zilch zip nada nothing which is even sweeter xd	neutral
this is both my first set review and post about a star wars set even though i have been collecting them since 99 i got this one early this year so i thought i would post a review on it please bare with me i am not a great photographer so with that in mind here goes front of the box 75083 atdp boxfront by whitesidewjw on flickr back of the box 75083 atdp box back by whitesidewjw on flickr shot of the bags 75083 atdp bags by whitesidewjw on flickr the sticker sheet i normally dont apply them but for this i am going ahead and putting them on 75083 atdp sticker sheet by whitesidewjw on flickr minifigs i really like the two atdp pilots but the best agent kallus really does shine of course we get an extra stormtrooper 75083 atdp minifigs by whitesidewjw on flickr no new molds in this as far as i can tell however these printed 4x4 domes are really great i can see lots of uses for these in space mocs 75083 atdp new printed elements by whitesidewjw on flickr bag1 complete nothing earth shattering here an easy build 75083 atdp bag 1 complete by whitesidewjw on flickr bag 2 complete 75083 atdp bag 2 complete cockpit seats by whitesidewjw on flickr cockpit assembly 75083 atdp cockpit assembly by whitesidewjw on flickr bag 2 complete 75083 atdp bag3 complete by whitesidewjw on flickr foot assembly i like how they positioned the slopes 75083 atdp foot assembly by whitesidewjw on flickr complete atdp 75083 atdp complete by whitesidewjw on flickr complete atdpside view 75083 atdp side view complete by whitesidewjw on flickr complete atdp over view 75083 atdp complete overview by whitesidewjw on flickr complete atdp rear view 75083 atdp rear view by whitesidewjw on flickr extra pieces 75083 atdp extra pieces by whitesidewjw on flickr the verdict minifigs 55 we get a total of four figs i like the two atdp pilots and agent kallus is a well done minifig i can complain about another storm trooper either parts 35 other than the dome pieces i commented on before there is really not any new parts in this if you build space star wars or machinery this will still be a welcome assortment experience of build 45 this really was a fun build it came together fast but was challenging enough for its target age group playability 55 this thing is much more sturdy than it looks the legs take a little bit of effort due to the double locking hinges but hold together very wellthis is a very minor complaint value 45 typical 4999 for 500 pieces i must admit i paid a little more than msrp due to shipping but i cant complain about the value overall 2125 i really believe this is one of the best walkers that lego has designed the only changes i would make would be adding real control panels in the cockpit and it would be nice if lego made a real widow to fit in with these types of builds rather than a transparent tile over another plate all in all i would recommend this set and i hope the rest of the 2015 star wars sets are on par with this	positive
thanks for the early review i dont know much about the rebals show at all but i can say that the over all design of the walker really appeals to me and the minifigs look top notch i also like how the spring shooters are pretty much hidden in the frame nice job	positive
great review thanks for doing it im a big fan of this set the minifigures are good as is the parts selection i like the piece used in the cockpit to secure the minifigure in place i wouldve liked to see some panels in the cockpit though rather than translucent red pieces that said however they are useful pieces	positive
thanks for the review cannot wait for the 2015 sets	positive
thanks for the review i have two questions  what is the driver standing on when the hatch is open and he is looking out  could you show the face of kallus without helmet please my only complaint is that the colours of both kalluss and the driverss uniforms are wrong kalluss uniform is way too dark and should be more dark olive than black and the driverss uniforms are too bright and should be more greyish compared to what we saw in the series	neutral
whats behind the printed 4x4 dome is that 2x4 yellow plate im planning to replace that	neutral

i built this set and i think the two rubber pieces holding the both sides of the face is a bit stretched out therefore making the set somewhat tight for entire top hatch to open and close does anyone have the same situation is this right  never mind i got it i built the back a stud too long edited by namioik 29 december 2014  0304 am	neutral

thelazychicken on 01 january 2015  0614 pm said great review the intro was great but im still not convinced on this one the height seems too small for comparison with the rest of the modulars the play features are ok but i wish it would have been taller totally agree with you the height does seem rather small also 2x buildings on a 32x32 baseplate with a lots of spare studs behind the buildings are these buildings 12 studs in width it still looks great style wise however this might be a set i buy and look at it after i have built it  regret the amount of  i have spent on it 239 for us aussies  edited by snaplock 01 january 2015  0742 pm	negative

thank you for the review it was very interesting and changed my opinion of the set im now considering a future purchase  just one question the mirror is on cardboard i was hoping for it to be a window piece with a mirror on one side i hope its not the same cardboard we had on some of the early harry potter sets or the element wont last long	neutral
thank you for the great review of this set im also curious for the backside of the mirror	neutral
amazing review very thorough with lots of details	positive
thanks for the review im a fan of the set but will be modding quite a bit have to get a small bar into the highlander and then turn the secondthird story above the barber shop into a proper apartment the detectives office is great and will stay as is	positive
natelite on jul 15 2007 1220 pm said seems like they infuse system sets with more technic bars must be that technic isnt selling too well and they want to educate ppl how cool technic can be p its quite apparent when even the small bike needed technic frame my guess its less expensive and complicated to produce theyre also using these parts in other themes so in the end theyre producing a smaller catalog of bricks but every part gets produced in larger quantities	neutral
this is a great review and so is the set y i thought i would buy it but when i saw the price i changed my mind xd i always liked flying things better though like the dropship although that is a bit pricey too i guess xd	neutral
i echo the consensus of this thread  too much technic looks great too expensive looks great	neutral
please build the alien craft im sure that we would all like a review of that 	neutral
nice review y i have quick question though do the crystals fit into the aliens hands try and stick one in therebecuase the new catalog shows an image of an alien holding a crystal lastly lego should have made the aliens with movable arms and no hole in the middle  i dont want to waste any money so i am only going to grab 1 or 2 of the smaller sets piranha editimo the aliens would win becuase they have superior technology and all they do is have to cut the airtank line and the humans die edited by piranha 20 july 2007  0140 am	positive
say i was looking at your pics and then at the instructions and i just realised  havent you put the stikers on the shield thingies in the middle upside down i think you did d i dont know if i like those new sets though i mean they have great shapes and potential but at the same time they seem so holey theyre really huge and big but full of empty air and space as well well this one not as much and indeed it is the best looking set of the lot though but i dont think ill go into that line	neutral
snefroe1 on jul 16 2007 0719 am said ok then ill do that later on but i will not touch that plastic residu xd you touched them to put them in their holders in the ship so in theory you will not review them anyways nice review i dont think ill get this though im trying to decide between this moble devastator or anothe 90 set i need to get something large before my bday regards vbbn	positive
great review wonderfully detailed dont care for the ship at all its that technic under a hollow shell thing like the ctt if it wasnt for the figures i would have hated it and nothing about these figures excites me ill end up finding the least number of sets possible to provide at least one of each figure for the general population collection and skip the rest unless they do as i expect and flop here thus leading to huge discounts i like this set  at half off 	positive
vorkosigan on 09 january 2015  1229 am said isnt getting parts in new colors a good thing it is a shame there is only this one set i think tlg could make a whole subtheme out of frozen i do agree that they overuse lavender and magenta i dont see why every girl set has to have these sort of colors instead of what would be accurate to the source material  sure new colors are good but cramming a bunch of oddball ones into a single set where they dont even make sense just seems financially unwise for lego id rather have seen a larger set than light aqua spiral staircase parts or lavender tiny fences lego made the stairs in dark purple last year for rapunzels tower and those probably would have been ok here or make them in a more useful color like white	neutral
thanks for the review i have the same opinion about the design looks like belville i bought it on legostore orlando december 30th it was impressive my wife saw them putting on shelf 8 or 10 boxes she ran and grabbed the last one the girls faces around it was indescribable mix of ecstasy and afraid to loose it it happened in less than 2 minutes my 7 yo girl didnt want it she likes the dresses but hates the movie prefers lego movie but my 2 yo girl who never saw the movie grabbed it for good and we bought it lego will sell it like water but i do not understand why a set so small it is the worst set design since the introduction of lego friends my 7 yo has more than 50 lego friends minifigures all the lego fiends stores and concluded that the castle had a terrible design she is 7 lets be honest lego should have released this sets months before this christmas and is loosing a perfect opportunity to sell a decent set with much more pieces i am wondering if they are going to make another set with the same characters at the end it is just for the minifigures	negative
im literally of the exact opposite opinion to op here i love the structure and the parts this is a fantastic little parts pack that ill be snagging more of when i find it againbut ive no use for the figures not a big disney princess fan its all about the parts this set is freaking amazing d	positive
there is a very simple reason for the flowers and greenleaved trees you should remember from the movie it was actually summer when elsa set of the eternal winter… the orange flowers do bother me from a design point of view i would have liked it better if they were a pinkpurplebluewhite color same goes for the leafy bits they could have used the pinkpurple ones they are gonna use in the elves sets it would have been fantastic if they had given us white leafy bits like snow covered branches im sure loads of us could use those in our mocs edited by bennemans 13 january 2015  0614 pm	neutral

asuka on aug 1 2007 0147 pm said no i think this is correct the upper plate with clip for the door is a little high on top of a dark gray 1x1 brick so if you want the door to operate well you have to place it like that i just put the clip under that brick a very easy fix so my door now is lower which looks better imho and no sneaky skelly can crawl along under it xd exactly asuka is correct also keep in mind that the picture was taken looking down on the model that is sitting on the carpet it makes the gap appear a little larger in addition for those of you that recommended ironing the sail it worked great i set the iron to low and used a tshirt to protect the sail it flattened it out perfectly in fact it worked so well that i did the same with my old ww weapons wagon cover that has gotten wrinkled over the years the iron worked perfectly	positive
yes very nice review mr brickster i think i  for a change like the castle part better the ship doesnt look quite right to me if theyre gonna make a pirate theme with ships like this i wouldnt be very happy but i think the ship brings some nice accesories like the anchor a black mid piece steering wheel etc i think ill buy it eventually wout on aug 1 2007 0819 pm said nice review i like the buildingport the most mmmdark blue plates wub pity it is a toysrus exclusive in the netherlands there are only toysrusses in the greater cities ah thats good to know now i wont be searching in other toystores as well thanks mr tiber	positive

review  42039  24 hours race car introduction when the preliminary images of the le mans racer surfaced somewhere last year 2014 it got a lot of praise this changed dramatically when the final images of the 24 hours race car showed up the front side of the car especially the head lights and the curvature of the side of car had changed a lot the car obviously still resembled the prototype but the new design raised a lot of eyebrows the new design was considered a step back instead of forward eventhough i still liked the design i must admit i liked the earlier design better too with the emphasis on past tense liked i am not sure anymore and this review will show you why like the arctic truck this set has a bmodel which is well worth checking out thats why this review includes both the amodel and bmodel for people who are on the fence the bmodel might actually convince them to buy the set after all lets see what this set is all about note all images can be clicked for hires versions set information number 42039 title 24 hours race car theme technic released 2015 part count 1219 box weight 2110 gr box dimensions 478 cm x 373 cm x 87 cm model dimensions 40 cm x 18 cm set price msrp €9999    £9999 price per part €0082    £0082 links brickset bricklink the box the box measures 478 cm x 373 cm x 87 cm and weighs well over 2kg 2110 gr to be precise the width of the box is the same as the box of the arctic truck this box also feels like its filled to the brim the front the front shows a picture of the main model in action with radial blurred wheels to emphasize the motion of the car the lower right section shows the dimensions of the model upon completion it will measure a length of 40cm and a width of 18 cm the back like the front the back side has exactly the same setup as the box of the arctic truck the top shows the functions of the model while the lower left side shows the bmodel and the lower right side shows the motorization options the picture of the bmodel looks so cool it could be a model of its own at this point i was very eager to build both models and compare them the side one of the sides usually shows a part in 11 scale this time its one of the wheels indicating the size of the model content of the box the box contains 1 booklet 1 sticker sheet 13 bags 4 tires instruction booklet since i own two copies of the set i also received two instruction booklets whats catching my eye is that my second copy is supplied in different packaging than the first one its for the first time that i am aware of that the instruction booklet and stickers come in a sealed bag without cardboard back hopefully this will be a new standard for all sets with sticker sheets instead of multiple booklets this set contains a single square bound book in earlier reviews i have epxressed my preference for a single book i dont see any advantage in having 2 3 or even up to 6 booklets sticker sheet like the actual model the sticker sheet looks very vibrant the bright green white and black color combination has found its way to the stickers as well either you love em or hate em since i started writing reviews i have been applying stickers and i am happy i started doing it stickers do give the model its finishing touch bags with parts thirteen bags with a total of 1219 parts give or take a few are supplied in the densily packed box the rims and flex are sealed in a bag as well sometimes looking at the bags makes you wonder what the logic is behind the distribution of the various parts across the different bags well this time it really got me confused take a look at two of the bags below theres a bag containing all the 3l blue pins then theres a bag with various partsand a single 3l blue pin i figured this might be an error but both of the sets have the same anomaly tires the tires have been supplied unbagged as usual highlighted parts this chapter describes new and interesting parts this set actually contains a lot of them this set also contains an abundance of panels if you arent into panels this isnt the set for you changeover catch this year 2015 the new changeover catch parts were released its a combination of three parts the advantage of the new parts is that the red gear is the same on both sides which avoids mounting it the wrong way around it also avoids the changeover catch slipping out of the driving ring like it used to do you can apply lots of pressure but the catch doesnt slip out pins some of last years new pins are also included in this set 12 x pin with pin hole and 21 x 3l pin with 1l axle securing technic beams can be quite simple with the new pin with pin holes the new 3l pin with 1l axle gives you more possibilities when connecting beams and other parts below are two example situations where the new pins have been used granted the examples below can be accomplished by using other techniques however some predicaments from the past can be easily solved by using these new parts like me you will most likely appreciate the ease of use engine and suspension also included are two steering portal hubs and steering portal hubs with ball joint arms and four steering portal axles for driving and steering the vehicle these parts are commonly used nowadays the picture below also shows some other parts like gear rack steering arms and suspension frames this set comes with a single 5x7 frame and three 5x11 frames panels this set contains a whopping 47 panels in three different colors i personally like panels a lot and i do appreciate the variety we have at our disposal lately this set even contains a new 13x3x2 curved mudguard panel new 13x3x2 curved panel this is the first set to contain the new 13x3x2 curved panel looking at the pictures doesnt do these panels justice in real life they are actually quite big i figured they would be smaller but they are even longer than the 11 x 5 frame with a length of 13 including the attachment points hopefully this part will be available in other colors as well preferably white for adding variety to your ev3 robot 19l white flexaxles the white 19l flex axles have only been released in a single set the 8461 williams f1 racer in 2002 current prices on bricklink are as high as 15 euros needless to say we are very happy with the return of these white axles now we can build jeroen ottens awesome alfa romeo 4c spider for a decent price as well i am really happy that useful rare parts are being used more often by tlg designers part list heres the complete list for all 1219 parts as you can see in the highlighted parts section this set contains a lot of interesting and useful parts if you dont own sets like the 8070  supercar this might be the set to pick up if you want to start building your own supercar the build enough with all the set and part information lets build the model rear suspension the build starts with the rear suspension and drivetrain as you can see in the picture below the length of the axle between the steering cv joint is 4l where it usally is 3l this is an indication that the finished model will be a bit bigger than usual 8070 for example the finished suspension is one of the cleanest suspension setups i have seen in an official model its pretty basic but it works like a charm this setup is defintely worth using in your moc heres a video after attaching the suspension to the frame you rotate the module and secure it at this stage the rear section of the chassis with suspension is almost finished v8 midengine extending the chassis forward results in the picture below where the front spoiler is already visible whats also visible is the v8 engine placed right in front of the rear axle resulting in a midengine setup perfectly suited for sports and race cars two exhaust pipes have been fitted on either side of the engine together with two hoses attaching them to the engine the instructions are easy to follow although you sometimes you need to bend the beams a bit minor improvements are possible here and there but nothing shocking front suspension the front suspension is a bit more complicated than the rear suspension which makes sense considering the fact it contains the steering rack the shock absorbers are placed in a different angle than the rear ones resulting in a somewhat stiffer front suspension all in all the front suspension is well designed and the steering rack can be easily powered with a servo motor the picture belows shows the front suspension attached to the chassis if you follow the official instructions to motorize the model the area in front of the suspension is used to mount the battery box when you are modding this model to make it full rc this area can be used to mount the servo motor gearbox like the gearbox in the 8070 its not used to switch gears powering the drivetrain its used to switch between two functions opening the doors and the hoodbonnet the gearbox is located at the left of the vehicle near the cockpit the mechanism to open the doors is located on the left side while opening the hoodbonnet is taking place at the right side to accomplish this some axles traverse under the cockpit to the other side of the vehicle following the axles to other side of the vehicle and adding some gears results in the situation below the video below shows the gearbox in action door opening mechanism the mechanism to open the door is comprised of some knob wheels links without stoppers and pins with towballs take a look at the doors opening and closing the front using the new mudguards and various other panels you finish the front of the car the front is probably the most controversial part of the car this is caused by the preliminary pictures shown before the release of this car in the early pictures the front of the car had smooth curves and beautiful lines while the final car lost these smooth lines and got a more blocky look in return i must admit that at a first glance the new design lost some of its appeal however this model grew on me pretty rapidly the headlight design can be found in more or less the same way on several real le mans type race cars the rear the rear of the car looks great with the stickers continuing from the mudguards to the panels underneath the spoiler the two exhausts sticking out give some details to the back i absolutely disagree with all the negativity surrounding this car maybe its one of those models which needs to grow on you finished model here it is the finished model i know some of you dont like the looks of the car but i think it looks great the color scheme is outstanding the new for technic bright green parts combined with white and black make this car look very vibrant and colorful i am not a big fan of the green used in the 42008  service truck but i do like this bright green a lot it fits perfectly well with the mindstorms ev3 set the curves on the side of the car are not as smooth as some of us hoped but i still think the car looks more than acceptable from the side the stickers add some nice details to the car giving it that characteristic race car look the model looks great in pictures but it does even look better in real life i love this picture of the front of the car however i do wonder if a dedicated 24 hour le mans racer has the seat and steering positioned offcenter using the good ol google machine i come to the conclusion that they do have centered seating and steering at least the majority of them theres ample space in the cabin which makes me wonder why tlg decided to place the seat offcentered the rear view looks cool too with some of the suspension showing and the two exhaust pipes clearly visible the bottom view is very useful to determine the size of the car in studs it measures approx 59 x 27 studs the chassis looks organized and well designed the engine has been placed close to the ground which is perfect for the weight distribution a low center of gravity improves the handling of the car i really enjoyed building this baby the build is very clean and organized although there are some steps where you need to bend the beams a bit to get things into place seeing the model come to life and seeing it grow to pretty impressive proportions is very satisfying for me it was fun but i reckon kids will go nuts over this set and the build size comparison what became obvious during the build but whats emphasized when you have finished the model is that its quite big the size of the car is pretty impressive the pictures below show the car next to the 42030  volvo l350f the side view emphasizes the size of the car its even longer than the volvo if you dismiss the bucket parts left some parts left nothing out of the ordinary features and functions unlike the bmodel this model doesnt implement any unexpected features the functions it does implement are exactly what you would expect from any car steering hog working fake engine suspension opening doors gullwing style opening bonnethood opening trunk gearbox for switching between functions unfortunately the steering wheel hasnt been linked to the hog hand of god steering mechanism placing the seat in the center would have provided an easy way to link the steering wheel to the steering mechanism its a shame we hardly see actual steering anymore opening the hood actually opens up the entire rear section of the car providing you with easy access to the motor compartment the mechanism to open the hood works properly which results in smooth opening and closing of it the same goes for the gullwing style doors both functions are operated manually and you need to switch with the lever to the left of the cockpit these two functions are also the ones which can be motorized by placing an mmotor near the cockpit and a battery box in the trunk all things considered i think this car offers lots of playability the model is solidly built and the functions are easy to operate id say its pretty safe to let your kids play with it bmodel unlike the amodel the bmodel for this set received almost universal acclaim and i can see why often the bmodel is a pale shadow of its part donor in this case the model looks so good it could be a model of its own it even incorporates a neat feature which actually deserves to be in the amodel theres a lot a variation in the quality of digital building instructions tlg is providing but these ones are of very high quality the picture below shows most of the chassis with suspension fake engine and gearbox in place finished model some concessions have been made but overall the car looks fantastic the black of the roof has been extrapolated from the hood which definitely works for me the rear section of the car feels a bit empty but the panels do cover up most of it so its hardly noticeable the v8 stickers will be upside down if you use the parts from the amodel since i could apply new stickers i have placed them using the proper orientation the bottom of the car shows the chassis its obviously a bit smaller than the amodels chassis features and functions taking the functions into account this model isnt playing second fiddle to the amodel besides the obvious functions like steering opening doors and hood this car features folding fog lights which deserve a better podium than a bmodel steering hog working fake engine suspension opening doors manually opening hoodbonnet manually opening trunk operated by gear folding fog lights operated by gear gearbox used to switch functions fog lights one of the most interesting features of the bmodel are the folding fog lights it almost feels a bit weird that a feature like this is implemented in the bmodel instead of the amodel below are 4 steps showing how the mechanism works i have also included a video the mechanism is somewhat reminiscent of fork mechanism used in the 8109  flatbed truck which has been described in effermans review take a look at the video to the fog lights in action parts left a fair number of parts left which isnt uncommon for a bmodel summary to summarize how i feel about this set you need to take a look at the picture below the combined image reflects the quality of this setor better yetsets you actually get two great models for the price of one you dont like the amodel no problem you can have lots of fun with the bmodel i cant stop playing with the fog lights its mesmarizing the color scheme on both models is outstanding i simply cant emphasize enough how well this color scheme pleases the eye the regular green is dull and boring but this bright green really pops out especially when combined with black and white and possibly some red details black white and a little red sounds familiar yes bright green can easily be combined with your ev3 robots so while you are combining the bright green with your robot why not use the great new curved mudguard panels these new panels are introduced in this set and they look great they open up a lot of possibilities in the design department the build of the amodel is outstanding it is fairly simple but since its so clean i really enjoyed it a lot i think the build should be entertaining which doesnt mean it needs to be a real challenge and lets be honest when is a build really challenging the rear suspension is a good example of why i liked the build its very simple yet very effective works like a charm the same goes for the other functions in both models and the star of the entire show can be found in the bmodel hows that for a surprise being aware of the fact that i like this model a lot better than most of you seem to do i really encourage you to give this model a chance the sheer size is impressive the color scheme is awesome and you get a bonus model which is actually worth building score okay so how do i grade this set 8 design open to debate but i like it a lot 8 building experience fun and clean build 9 features superb function in bmodel steels the show 9 playability both models offer lots of playability 8 parts lots of new parts and cool existing parts 10 value for money two models for the price of one 87 twice the fun i hope you enjoyed this review

outstanding review jim congrats  love the pictures so clean and crisp  hope to see many more of your reviews as for the set after seeing this review i kind of like it if i will find it at a decent price i will get it for sure	positive
fantastic review jim from the quality of the review alone it is easy to see how much hard work you have put into it im with you on the instruction manual i much prefer one quality bound book over umpteen stapled booklets already have 2 of these sitting in the build queue one for display model as im a fan of this one and one to build the b model then dissemble for parts so im already sold on his set but still very much enjoyed taking the time it deserves to read through the review and ogle at your pro photography	positive
great review with fantastic pictures as for the model im glad that they chose to make it less pretty  real le mans prototypes are rarely a sight to behold it is function and aerodynamics over form i would however have preferred more realism for the sake of learning  the front shouldnt open like that  instead it should be easy to remove the whole front cover leaving the suspension easy to work on  the aero seems to be realistic except for the rear end where theres no indication of a venturi channel this should have been easy to include  there is no fuel tank nor fixed fuel connector right behind the cabin  there are no air jacks seriously this is one of the most unique features of a race car like this and lego forgot about them instead they automated two functions which are manual on a real race car  the top cars at le mans are hybrids with ingenious systems i would have loved to see the front wheels connected to some kind of spinning apparatus indicating a kinetic energy recovery system if i get this set im going to make some modifications	positive
im still not a huge fan of the model but this is one awesome review the effort and quality can be clearly seen and i hope you continue making reviews like this	positive
a very professional review and really no stone unturned but im still not going to rush out and buy a copy	positive
thank you vey much for this review i do have some questions 1 what are the white clutches geared into 2 is the engine geared to one or both drive motors 3 how well does it go on carpet 4 can it doze without breaking the blade	positive
excellent review thanks what is the cost in us not released in my area the shovel is obviously my favorite area it looks detailed and strong i love the treads because i need them to move the 4 x 4 barrels on my superscaled turbolaser turret very good pics too what color are the treads i never had them they are plastic or rubber edited by grand moff viceroy 03 august 2007  1234 am	positive
ah mani wanted to review it with mine oh well here in the us it cost 150 and has 1355 pieces total the pins and axles did seem a bit difficult in putting them into place a problem i have been having is the batterys are done after about 4 hours of play which i really wish they would last longer   overall it is a stupendous set and it is really nice to see our old friend the studs make a return	neutral
thanks for the review this looks like a great set and with four motors two receivers and a remote control i wouldnt say it is overpriced it is still a lot of money though if my scholarship permits it i will seriously consider buying this set	positive

the new small technic sets have incredible functionality for their size and this one is no exception with only 106 parts this crane can roll extend rotate lift and hold in any position and has working stabilisers the boom extends the same as the other sets with this boom simply pull it it works surprisingly well and due to circular ridges inside the boom the extension which is just a standard beam will hold in place the gear at the back controls the height of the boom as you can see the boom is only half extended boom fully extended half down the cable is kept in place via two gears and a blue pin same as the 7905 crane even under decent weights this works well the stabilisers however cannot handle much weight once the load is moved off axis the stablilsers are a very simple but effective design another shot of the stablilsers this also shows how far the boom will decend the boom height mechanism works well also i love the cab design overall this is a remarkable achievement for the low price i bought it for the boom piece as i want to improve the crane that came with 7998 7898    i highly recommend it	positive

alright so i usually do quick photo reviews when i get new sets thats what ill do here but theres quite a few photos so i thought i might as well make its own review thread so i got the kwikemart by paying just2much on an early ebay copy i think its worth it as this week im gonna be super busy so i was able to build it saturday and stuff heres my video review i think its one of my best well lets get onto this photo review the set is 200 usd with a little over 2100 pieces the official release is april 15th for vip members may 1st for everyone else at lego stores and if you want full size pictures check out my flickr by clicking here the minifigures included are great you get three exclusive minifigures one being a completely exclusive character the first time lego has ever put an exclusive mould in a direct to consumer set and you get three of the series most popular characters in their normal attire for those who missed out on the first simpsons minifigures series the kwikemarts exterior is loaded with lots of sticker details the only printed detail youll see in the exterior is the dial pad in the phone booth which has appeared in some other licensed themes since last year   right here is there the store can be opened a simple technic pin and receiver keeps it in place and allows for opening and closing the roof of the store includes the garden shown in the paul mccartney episode the roof can be slided outin once you open it with the hinge part heres a look at the store with the roof removed the floors are a nice sand blue color coming with 8x16 thin plates and for the interior from the view of the store opened with the hinges at the back that i mentioned earlier the left front corner which includes some arcade machines of bonestorm and great white hunter an amazingly done buzz cola soda machine juice machine the checkout counter ect the right front corner with food aisles freezers and a frozen jasper sticker the back left corner which includes some nice coffee kettle builds the donut tray hotdogs ect the right back corner which has a door leading to a very small hallway that only has a mouse and cheese in it the hallway leads to the employees only door in the back and its very hard to get in the door way not that theres anything to do inside there also included is clancys copcar which fits three figures heres a look at the piece list in the instructions click on each to be lead to an enlarged version of the pic also included are some awesome printed pieces and two unprinted coffee cups honestly i think this set is perfect the price is fantastic and has a great ppp ratio they really went above and beyond by including snake in this set i honestly think its better than the simpsons house in terms of accuracy and the value here so many cool pieces printed and in exclusive colors so thats my quick picture review hope you guys enjoyed and id love to hear your thoughts	positive

nice review of a surprisingly interesting set y those windows are great and no doubt difficult to get classic coffee maker simple yet exactly right that baseplate was in a few other sets but never with that pattern would have made a great base for some of the classic 80s houses lego used to treat us to in tan was part of the adventurers egypt sets as recently as 2001 it was a base for ogel versatile plate that hopefully hasnt disappeared completely parapink is apparently light pink on brickshelf so i guess its just lighter than normal pink and stopped appearing in 1995 just so you know that monkey is drinking too much and likely to fall in the pool  	positive

nice review mate the set looks great and a real must for all those sb fans out there the whole set scream playability thats for sure which is great because lets be honest theirs gonna be alot of kids and yoda out their playing with it p xd   geezzzzz what is it with all those bloody stikers this set would be soooooo much better with printed pieces instead of those still once your over that at least the rest is ok am i the only one who thinks mrs puff kinda looks like a kinder egg toy theirs nothing wrong with that mind you yes i have a kinder problem xd  just seems strange to me	positive

the set and the other designer sets that came out with it especially 4888 are incredibly well designed sets i wish lego would go back to doing sets like these as i loved the multitude of instructions and ideas the last batch of creator sets had zero ideas even though i know several were made  anyway less whining more review the lion is the main model his mouth doesnt fully close but it does open more the head works well from most angles i love the dark orange bricks great for rust he is quite solid but the joints take the weight well the neck goes side to side and rotates but doesnt go up and down the body is built in two parts and pinned in the middle with what is left you can make what i think is a hyena a silly plant moc and what i believe is a vulture there are also instructions for a few other models including a bat boar and a snake which i quite like he can be built at the same time as this cute little lizard overall this is a great set with an excellent blend of colours and pieces i wanted it for steampunk potentials sweet i hope you liked the review till next time	positive

lego 75915 pteranodon capture im glad to review this nice set 75915 pteranodon capture name pteranodon capture set number 75915 pieces 174 price 1999 minifigs 2 theme jurassic world year of release 2015 links box the front of the box has the jurassic world logo along with the set number piece count etc its a decent box size for a 20 set here it is compared to a minifigure heres the back of the box it shows all of the features from the set an ad for the video game the back also shows a small picture with a silhouette of the dinosaurs from the line along with their set numbers instruction booklet the booklet shows the same thing as the front of the box nothing more nothing less near the back of the booklet there is a picture with all of the characters from the sets the other page shows all the dinosaurs with a mini box that shows the size comparisons the minifigures the minifigures in this set are simon masrani and an acu both of them have excellent printing on the front and the back the gun is the same one from tlm that the ssp used simon masrani is the only one with a double sided face his second face shows a scaredworried expbbression he has a zipped up jacket or jumpsuit with a shirt underneath the acu trooper only has one face which is a scaredworried expbbression i would have a scared expbbression too if i was about to get eaten by a dinosaur he has great detail on his torso and legs lets take a look at the vest the vest is the same mold from the ssp in tlm i think it has the letters acu on the front too the back is nothing interesting pteranodon the pteranodon has great printing too the colors match the ones that the pteranodons from the movie have the wings mouth and head are a rubbery type of plastic and are easily bendable it uses the same mold from the pteranodon in the 2012 dino line heres a comparison between the two spare parts the spare parts arent many just a few extras the helicopter at first the helicopter was meh when i first saw it on the box now that ive built it ive got to say that i really like it its my favorite helicopter of all of the ones ive built its sturdy and sleek its not too bulky either the first play feature in this set is the net launcher it works pretty well not one of my favorite features but it does what its meant to do the other play feature is on the other side its a stud shooter which can be used by a minifigure you can put it on their hand or you can leave it there and let someone operate it the shooter can fold up inside the helicopter as well there are stickers on both sides of the helicopter and they also have the jurassic world logo with dino marks final verdict value 910  for 20 this set isnt that bad the parts count is a little low for a 20 set but the price is probably because of licensing other than that its a great deal i wouldve hoped for maybe some bait for the pteranodon but that can easily be fixed design 910  i really love the way this helicopter looks its sleekness and design is great the only flaw this has is the huge net launcher its too big in my opinion minifigs 1010b  the minifigures are extremely detailed and it even includes an exclusive minifigure playability 910  there are many things you can do with this set the swoosh factor is great and so are the play features parts 1010b  theyre useful parts and there isnt many huge specialized pieces in here either overall 910  this set is great for fans of jurassic world its also a nice parts pack theres one exclusive minifigure in here too which makes it even better having a little fun with the set hope you liked my first review here on eurobricks please leave any suggestions on what to improve thanks edited by thelazychicken 02 may 2015  1019 pm	positive
thanks for the review i really like this set i love the acu minifigures and the dinosaur is really nice i think the helicopter has great potential for a shield helicopter only suggestion is that some of your pictures are a little bit dark especially the box front one but really good for your first review thanks a lot	positive
i love the dinos in these sets but aside from that the builds imo kind of suck just like the last dino sets this just has a franchise connected to it and honestly i hope it does well enough to spark more dinojurassic parkworld interest because i want to see more dino minifigures maybe a brontosaurus or something i will most likely be buying many of the dinosaur minifigures here however i doubt ill buy the actual sets or the genetically altered dinosaur which can only work for jurassic world this set is imo average love the dinosaur	negative

lightningtiger on 04 may 2015  1255 pm said thanks mostlytechnic for this review i only brought this set to continue the shop series from creator in my opinion its only half as good as the bike shopcafe one plus it doesnt fit the same as that pair of shops oh well maybe next year lego creator will have a better one brick on review on mostlytechnic  well it is only half the price of the bikecafe one too  but i agree it seems odd that theyve made a couple shop creator sets that dont fit together in style like this i guess theyve done that for years with the creator houses though  none of those really work together david thomsen on 04 may 2015  0133 pm said reviews for this set really should picture them next to the bike shop  cafe which its intended to be compatible with right down to the size of the baseplates and grey tiles around the edge it doesnt look that great on its own but if you add the two sets together you get something that begins to look like a street scene interesting to get two comments right in a row with opposite opinions  i dont have the bikecafe set but to me they dont looks like theyd really go together theyre the same concept two buildings that fold in half but the sidewalk is different size and they just feel differently styled to me	negative
this seems like half of a set compared to the previous bike shopcafe as i like many of the elements i will probably buy a second one and build a mirror image version making one entirely a toy shop and the other a book storenews stand and adjust the sidewalks to work with the previous model then i think they will work well together i remember a little area in copenhagen that had this sort of architecture i would hope the subsequent models are better deigned to create more complex alternatives but these are both good starting points for original or enhanced models	neutral
as a fan of creator houses i really want to like this set however i think that creator houses have long filled a niche thats neglected elsewhere residential houses we havent had a larger residential house since 2013 im not sure if these sets have anything to do with that but it seems like they may be the replacement for larger houses and id much rather have a larger house set than a set like this i also agree with many others here something about it just feels incomplete i think that the various city business buildings weve gotten in recent years including those in this years city squarewhich is much more expensive than this but also contains much more make for better buildings at this scale	positive
thank you andy for your speed review y so theres nothing left to open while advent  i like all the tiny sets it neednt be another police and fireman   but well what would an advent calendar be without them d one thing about the train traffic lights tlc used to give us similar lights but you could show either of the lights with the other one being covered that one was waaay better  just a little piece more would have done the thing and i wont mention the radarcrapdish x let me quote franz beckenbauer is denn scho weihnacht legendary quote from an promotional job he did years ago  is it xmas already	neutral
informative review thanks y as usual it makes a fairly good parts pack wish i could pick up a few on deep discount but at full price one is fine i do like the stewards and some of the workmen overall i think im looking more forward to the belville calendar just for its assortment of unusual parts ugh belville still parts are parts and its got some phoinix summed up one of the most common complaints i hear about all of the lines in 3 simple words  no girlsagain good job now get lego to listen 	positive

phoinix on sep 13 2007 0318 pm said no girlsagain and no santa whats up with that sure there are many nice pieces to give life to every city layout i would love something more simple a girl taking her dog for a walk a boy on a bicycle simpler thingsnot all the workmen again i agree a girl with a dog or a boy with bicycle in a small set would be so nice and strange enough so difficult for tlc nice review	neutral
gylman on sep 13 2007 0551 pm said i am however looking forward to the belville advent calendar which likely will have some parts that usually are quite hard to get in it my girls will love it and i love all the belville parts httpshoplegocomproductp7600 if anyone has pics of what is contained in this set i would love to see them ohh tks for the news 8 it really looks interesting belville always have great parts in cool colours  excellent indeed  yoda	positive

thanks for the review ive had that set for quite a while and its among my favorite marvel superheroes sets actually compared to the other stuff we usually get to accompany the minifigs all those laboratorys the most recent construction site and the hydra fortress  yeah youre being a little harsh here maybe youre still suffering from ptsd after watching fantfourstic	neutral

im glad you were joking about doom im not that big of a fanboy but i had the need to correct you for some reason with that said i bought this set for the minifigures a few years ago looking back i dont really care about the figures today like i did in 2013 the building is decent for the size of the set though thanks for the review	neutral

hello everyone by now many excited lego star wars fans have started receiving their ucs falcon some of us here enjoy writing reviews and sharing our thoughts i mentioned to yoda that i was planning on doing a review of this set but it would likely take me a few weeks of 12 hours per night to finish building the set yoda suggested that i do the review as i go so everyone could see the progress of the set what a great idea so here is the first entry feel free to comment along the way i will try to post photos and updates every night on the build then wrap up the review when i complete the set if you have any specific questions or photo requests please be sure to ask ucs millennium falcon reviewed by dunamis set 10179 5195 pieces 49995 from lego shop at home the box obviously this is a box like no other first of all it comes in its own shipping carton inside of that there is a standard lego carton finally inside the lego carton we have the actual millennium falcon box and a nice little letter thanking you for buying the biggest lego set ever shipping box naboo set provided for scale lego carton and letter lego carton the millennium falcon box is really quite nice there are lots of photos and it does a good job of selling the set there are 8 individual pieces of tape that keep the lid on the box the limited first edition comes with a seal on the lower left corner millennium falcon box naboo set provided for scale lifting the lid straight up reveals one compartment of several bags on the right on the left we find a thin square box like a pizza box that contains the official certificate of authenticity two sticker sheets and one enormous manual under the pizza box we find two more compartments each filled with several typical lego bags the box weighs 24 pounds stickers pizza box pieces in compartments not quite sure what the little 30th anniversary sticker is for yet the certificate of authenticity is on heavy paper and is suitable for framing more to come tomorrow its late here	positive
good idea to make this review while you build the set ill be monitoring your progress and feedback the box so huge impressive	positive
nice review ill be watching and waiting for the rest	positive
excellent beginning our numbers are very close but i havent the luxury of space to build it so ill be enjoying it by proxy through you enjoy y	positive
what a wonderful idea and how nice from you sweet and go killer go	positive
the manual the gigantic manual measures 17 x 12 and is almost an inch thick it is spiral bound with a cardboard like front and back and it is 314 pages interesting decision not to break it up into multiple manuals it is almost unwieldy at this size and thickness unfortunately the manual is not available electronically from the lego website hopefully it will be soon missing were the little instructions at the beginning telling you to not build this beast on shag carpet and to sort out the 5000 pieces before you get started i guess they figure if you got 500 to spend on this thing you can build it however you want as usual we get the regular lego manual features  piece call outs for each step  parts inventory at the end of the manual  page numbers  photos of all the other 2007 sets at the end of the manual manual paperback book provided for scale various manual photos 8x8 plate provided for scale im about 2 hours into building and sorting im trying to stay a day ahead in my posting the build has been easier than i thought so far despite the massive number of pieces it has not been too hard to sort and find what you need build photos will start appearing in tomorrows entry	positive
my gawd that manuel is huge thats enough to put a sane man off of buying this setthank gawd none of us are sane thats all i can say xd just how many technic pins does this monster need 8 judging by that one pic theres gotta be a lot in this set	negative
xwingyoda on sep 28 2007 0734 am said tks for that comparison pic dunamis  ok the box is big  i pictured it a tad smaller though  yoda i dont have the ucs isd but from the pic i can see that it is about the same thickness slightly shorter but much wider than the mf so this leads me to believe that dimensionwise the ucs mf is more compact also notice how in the content the parts fit in just nice without additional spare space for anything else strange isnt it that when tlc is responsible for the shipping we see optimum usage of box spaces xd imagine if all boxes were this efficient 499 sets would be no bigger than a match box xd xd the mtt would be reduced to 14 its current size xd xd xd	neutral
good review y me i cant build it before saturday 	positive
the build the build is going quicker than i thought i am sorting as i open the bags that i need some bags are in multiples so it is easy to pick them out the build is a tad repetitive as the framework of the ship is somewhat symmetrical here are some progress shots note that two plates 1x4 and 1x8 are stacked in between technic beams then the part below is assembled to hold the structure together this took about an hour of sorting and building ill post another update tomorrow	positive
hey nice review im up to about the same point as you page 70 to be exact  tho i didnt have that missing piece thankfully i think lego have done a much better job at packing the lego this time i remember it taking me much longer to find pieces on the ucs isd build	positive
so i see they even do mistakes on these  that beast looks really sturdy  that is great  are these yellow parts new  i am not a technic fan and never saw these before another question for you is the instruction book easy to follow especially regarding the colours does the black rally stands out comparing to the dark bley and so on  i sure hope so  cant wait to see moer hehe yoda	neutral
i have been taking photos for this review for a few months and i finally took the rest of the photos last night all the parts if you want tan this is the set to get main model the garage is a great addition but the car only just fits the main house is very nice looking the windows extend to the sides but not the back the chimney and drainage work very well and i love the basement i think the front works very well when i was making this i was multitasking doing weight training do a set do a step do a set and i ended up missing one of the row paths i discovered this after i finished the basement  the removable roof reveals byo floors probably why this is called a model house the roof was quite interesting to build this is my first large house set so it all was very new to me i love the garage door more nice pipework this photo i misfocused but there isnt much to see anyway the door is a nice touch the grill to the right on both sides is not just decoration as it hides the hinges for the door i also made one of the submodels i was considering keeping this but i decided against it once again the sides have windows but the back doesnt the truck is there to make the photo more worthwhile the roof to this one doesnt come off easily as all the tiles are used for the front just to clarify these houses arent attached so you can arrange them however you want the fronts are quite elaborate and it seems that lego were trying to make this almost like a simpler market street the truck is too small for a minifig but it probably was my favourite car thoughts i highly recommend this set in most countries it is good value for money including australia the design is excellent and three instructions are included the third is a school if anyone has made it and wants to post photos feel free at least one person at eb has made it i love how each house has its own car due to the way the primary model is made it is a bit weak at the corner but that was a design choice my only real complaint about this set is how lego is going though a mould transition and thus some roof slopes are rough others are smooth i can accept either and lego has been moving to smooth slopes for years now but to have a set with about 5050 is annoying the mtt was the same but that is my only gripe with this excellent set wub	positive
i found the use of parts well done by the designers i made a car and then tried to make a house from a different instruction book i could not as several pieces were already used in the car nice to see them using all the parts like that rather than having a lot of extra bits moral of the story one instruction book at a time sweet	neutral
excellent review with great pics and cameo appearances by some of our eb favs y definitely a set that was on my to get list already and this only confirms that might make me want two just because i love tan so much and id like to see if something could be done to bulk up that car great job as always 	positive
thanks for this review sinner i love this house with the nicely made tiled corners the colorscheme and the garage the only thing i dislike about this set is the way the windows are attached in train windows so they turn inwards a little instead of the usual frames with shutterattachmentability but that is something that can be fixed in the blink of an eye i will certainly buy this house some day when i find it at reasonable price	positive
thanks for the thanks guys sweet hinckley39 on sep 28 2007 1108 am said great job now sort that out and start building for our competition xd i started building today sweet matthewusa on sep 28 2007 0356 pm said i cant believe tlc skimped on the floors it didnt bother me as i downloaded the instructions prior to buying the set i think it was a deliberate choice to make the house flashy looking but not very functional due to the cool looking corners it isnt very strong either while breaking it i was reminded of a zip p simonwillems on sep 28 2007 0653 pm said the only thing i dislike about this set is the way the windows are attached in train windows so they turn inwards a little instead of the usual frames with shutterattachmentability these were my first windows like that and it surprised me i wouldnt be surprised if lego are trying to phase out the old windows holodoc on sep 28 2007 0758 pm said thanks for the review sinner y  although we had a not very detailed one already p i notice that but since didnt show what the original set looked like i saw that more of a moc 8 holodoc on sep 28 2007 0758 pm said you get tons of useful parts to build other buildings as well shameless selfpromotion off  i was actually considering adding a link to your moc anyway thanks p pauldelahaye on sep 29 2007 0738 am said i too have bought this set and the only thing i notice which is a bit odd with the exception of there being no floors in the house is the lack of a steering wheel in the car once again i think this is just a sign of all style no substance d paulc on sep 29 2007 0519 pm said the mixed rough and smooth roof bricks would annoy me on a model like the mtt but here it looks as is if the roof is quite old with some parts being worn and pitted and some parts being replaced with new roof tiles i quite like the effect fair point what confuses me though is the cg cover has the rough ones shown 	neutral

sinner thanks for this outstanding review i am glad that i had read this review in advance before making my purchase on this set earlier with my girlfriend we built this set for a total of 3 hours to complete this beauty in about 2 hours ago there are stars circling around my head at this very moment when i post this reply i must admit from the bottom of my heart that this is an wonderful piece of house that simply shows the beauty of it with the european kind of houses where there is a garage furthermore there is a lovely blue car i am seeing stars right now in the middle of the night and i must drop a thanks to you personally as well although it is empty from its interior unlike the 4996 beach house but this set has the majestic look which simply place a wow factor in front of it upon completion at the moment we had plans for getting the second set next month to build the other design as well hopefully i will be able to share with you guys all of my different creators sets with its alternate designs as well in the near future	positive

great review thanks oky imo the only significant improvements over the 2009 version are the figures toys and printed shop sign as i already have the older one ill have to give this one a pass	neutral
regarding the reason for the different designs on the inner bags i think that the white stripe is the new version with the nonstripe version being old i suspect the reason some sets have both versions is simply that theyre still using up some of their supply of older bags good review i didnt realise there were quite as many changes as you highlighted tree roof etc	positive
i bought it and im very happy with it	positive
thanks for a nice review i am building it as we speak and i like it so far since i didnt have the old one i cant complain	positive
oky on 29 november 2015  1145 am said as for the controversy over rereleasing the winter toy shop i can see where the haters are coming from but i find their complaints to be quite petty i can understand if youre disappointed because you already have the first winter toy shop and were looking forward to a new set this year but theres always next year if youre a completist and feel like tlg is forcing you to buy a set you dont need youre wrong nobody is forcing you to buy anything but yourself if you decide to buy every set in a theme no matter what it is thats your problem not legos so put down your torches and pitchforks and just be glad that they improved the set design and gave us another chance to buy this classic set there are far worse things that can happen in this world than lego rereleasing one of their most popular sets sorry for that little rant so what is your opinion on rereleases like this please cast your vote in the poll above after mocking people for holding a particular opinion you then turn around and ask people to express their opinion no thanks i guess ill keep my opinions to myself i certainly dont want to be labeled a hater	neutral

good review as always jim when i first saw this set i thought that it would make a great parts pack for me as that i have about 20 white pieces in my technic collection all from 42043 and this set has some really useful ones all for a cheap price those 7l flex axles will be extremely useful in my current build im doing	positive
my favourite of the 2016 sets ive built so far id go so far as to say this is the best budget set in years i would have loved this when i was a kid  great swoosh ability 	positive
so this set showed up in stores yesterday and i immediately picked two up all in all it is a nice set but it is slightly different from what i was expecting the plane feels a bit flat pointy nose wide bottom etc and while the panels work very well as wings it feels a bit simplistic to just have singlepart wings the stickers really work for it though its a cracking set though nice parts pack and a nice model as well	positive
review  42046  getaway racer introduction starting with the 42010  offroad racer and 42011  race car in 2013 tlg released two sets in the first half of each year using a pullback motor the pullback motor allows the model to be pulled back followed by forward motion usually theres no apparent relation between the two set other than the ability to combine them into an alternate build this year there seems to some sort of cops and robbers scene going on a getaway racer and a police interceptor that cant be a coincidence makes you wonder who will be victorious the good guys or the bad guys lets find out note all images can be clicked for hires versions set information number 42046 title getaway racer theme technic released 2016 part count 170 box weight 302 gr box dimensions 260 cm x 138 cm x 59 cm set price msrp € 1999 price per part € 0118 links brickset bricklink the box the box has the same dimensions as previous years pullback motor sets in the lower right corner theres a visual explanation of the pullback mechanism the dark model with its decals sure looks like a cool hot rod content of the box the box contains 1 instructions booklet 1 sticker sheet 2 technic liftarms 1 pullback motor 3 bags instruction booklet just a single booklet unfortunately no booklet for the alternate model sticker sheet the sticker sheet contains a lot of cool stickers with flames and skulls etc pullback motor and liftarms the pullback motor and two liftarms are found unbagged bags a total of three bags containing the majority of the parts highlighted parts this section describes the new andor otherwise interesting parts actually this set is the only set of 1h 2016 which doesnt use any new parts not even parts in a new color tires the getaway racer uses four low profile tires tire 37 x 22 zr rims the rims are wheel 304mm d x 20mm in pearl gold found in 12 other sets panels this set contains three 3 panelsand three 4 panels in black part list this set contains 171 parts all listed below the build this being a small model i wont show any building steps lets skip right to the finished model below you can see the end result in my opinion the model looks great its got that hot rod vibe going on and the stickers add darkness to the vibe slight problem with this set is that it really needs the stickers to finish the look otherwise its quite dull with black and dark grey liftarms and panels the rear view shows the pullback motor connected directly to the rear axle in this image you can also clearly see the exhaust pipes on the side which are very well executed the 3x3 technic discs with stickers used in the rim result in only seeing a part of the rim this works very well with the golden rims the bottom view shows the chassis of the car nothing really noteworthy as you would expect from a pullback set video the following video gives you an overview of the finished model parts left these six parts are left after building the model seems about right features and functions this being a pullback motor set it only has a single feature the video below demonstrates the acceleration of the vehicle my girlfriend was kind enough to catch the model before it fell to the ground or did it hit something before it fell to the ground video this video shows the pullback functionality bmodel the alternate model is a combined build with the police interceptor which you can see on the back of the box unfortunately the instructions for the combined bmodel are not included so i didnt get a chance to build it this would make for a fun challenge building the bmodel without the instructions summary pullback sets are not the most technically advanced models so you cant expect any other functionality than hitting the walls in your house however i think they are very appealing to kids the fact that this years pullback sets form a duo adds to the fun in my opinion tlg hit the nail on the head with the getaway racer and police interceptor the getaway racer looks very badass which is something you dont see every day in a technic set score how do i grade the bad guy in this years duo 8 design it looks so cool but it does need the stickers 7 building experience nothing out of the ordinary 7 features limited to the pullbackanddrive functionality 7 playability combined with the police interceptor kids will love it it does need its nemesys though 7 parts collection of common parts gold rims could be interesting 8 value for money pullback sets always deliver a certain value 73 hit it more image can be found on my flickr page thank you for reading i hope you enjoyed it	positive

thanks again for the review i am not sold on this one yet but i confess it took about 2 years for me to finally appreciate 9396 maybe i need to see this in person	neutral
thanks for the thorough comments i agree that the set has some limitations both in construction and realism but i think theyre acceptable given the pricepoint and size the antenna is definitely ludicrous  i really do suspect they had a surplus of the swords to use up and yes the way the steering knob is mounted is loose i also noticed that the ujoints to the claw are not in the right spot like you mentioned but didnt include it since it still works fine that axle coming forward to the claw has a very long unsupported section that does bend a bit when you raise and lower the claw it works but is a bit of a cheat that im kinda surprised they let through i just checked and the bucket from 8043 is a couple studs too wide for this set im betting that was seriously considered but itd have meant scaling the whole thing up and that would have put it into a higher price point or they could have pulled the mold for the 8x14 bucket back out and remade it for this set i really like the model you built and thats interesting about the cabs being basically flush with the top but sticking out the side in image searching as part of my research i found both that style and ones like this with the cab sticking up more like the photo of the caterpillar one in my review i wonder if thats a useuropean difference or different types of mining or what because both styles definitely exist in the real world	neutral
freekysch on 06 december 2015  1200 pm said great review and great pictures  many thanks for talking the time to review this set  i am a fan of lego technic construction stuff but this set is not so appealing to me but then again i am sure some people will love it indeed very good review and also good points pointed out by mlonger  this set doesnt appealing to me neither but before i knew what it was i was thinking it was interesting but now its so simple a set close to 500 pieces with only 1 real function and the entire rear section looks unfinished	negative
great review one thing reaaaaaally bothers me about this set both models have the engine connected to one wheel the other wheel on the powered axle is just left to rotate freely and that really bothers me as it did in 42022 on 42022 even more tbh since its main feature is being a frigging car looking at the pics it isnt even a space issue as it was in the hot rod where they needed to route the steering through so they just cheaped out and didnt bother fitting a diff in there or even a live axle link im not very interested in this set not into construction stuff but i think this is a worrying trend 	negative
thanks for review mostlytechnic not a must have for me but this set have nice assortment of parts new turntable new panels i like yellow and if ill buy two of this sets  ill get enough wheels for proper 18wheeler and rubber connectors that i almost dont using at all but want to have more and more edited by victor imaginator 06 december 2015  0219 pm	positive
definately a quirky set i think id have prefered a bucket on the front with a complex lift and tip mechanism but a grab is different as for the b model i may prefer its functions to the a model certainly something different we have not seen before	neutral

lego 42045 technic hydroplane racer thanks to lego and eurobricks for making this review possible this was supposed to be a previewreview before the dec 1 release date for the set but it got stuck in customs or something and didnt arrive in time well id rather do a good late review than a rushed review so here it is name hydroplane racer set number 42045 pieces 180 price 1999 minifigs 0 theme technic year of release 2016 links bricklink brickset the box standard technic box action photo 2in1 logo inset of functions and the new try our app logo in the corner the box back more standard stuff with the bmodel and a larger app ad the contents 3 bags two manuals yes despite all the ads for their instructions app they included printed manuals for both the main and b models a big sticker sheet and two loose black beams the interesting parts theres a lot of panels in this set some are new colors the blue curved panel and the lshaped blue panels are a new mold i see them being used as mudguards on future sets or maybe even this year i havent looked at the other 2016 technic sets in detail yet the hose soft axle 7 long in black is new as well the normal 7 axle in yellow is a new color too and i have no idea why its in this set both models use it in invisible places so theres no reason other than making it easier to grab the right length axle to have it i assume other sets this year are using it but im not sure the manual and the dumbingdown continues now they have to show people to compare axle lengths to the 11 prints on the page that have always been there but how does the 11 work on the app might have to look into that for the record i pulled out my phone and tried to find the app in the google store couldnt find it so then i went to the lego website shown on the page and it had a link to it turns out it wasnt showing up because its tablet only so google wasnt showing it to me on my phone ill try again later with a tablet starting the build two technic standards a bunch of pieces linked together to make a specific pattern of holes and an engine block some weirdness this felt very weird to me  making the crankshaft for the engine they have you build it right to left i dont know if its because im a lefty or what but it felt awkward i need to look in some old manuals and see if its always been this way nope i randomly looked at 2013s set 42000 racer and it builds it left to right assembling the core heres the core of the racer upside down the engine block some gears at each end and a couple boat studs for smooth gliding and yes they cheated and those are only attached on two studs instead of all 4 im always amazed at how lego geometry keeps finding interesting ways that it works like here with those boat studs they fit perfectly into the bottom of the brick and against the beam the front end up front we get a standard blue seat with a couple hidden wheels behind it a boat doesnt typically have wheels but these will drive the mechanisms of this model so well let it slide an odd part choice here though  in the very front there are two tan axle pin without friction parts holding that 3 long liftarm on why theres no need in either model for the nonfriction pin and theres lots of the normal blue axle pins in the set so why include these two different pins and all done it looks like a huge jump here but its really not the front and rear connect to each other and then a bunch of big panels are added that make the model look way bigger the stickers on this set really make it work without them its pretty bland and boring so i recommend using them from the rear at the back we have a fan to propel the boat thats not so accurate all the images i can find of reallife boats use props in the water but since this is a nonfloating model we have to make some tweaks i guess there also should be fins going down into the water for stability and hydroplaning but again had to drop that heres an example of a real boat you can see they nailed the overall look quite well the underside for those that want to see the mechanicals heres the underside of the model minifig scale technic nope not quite a fig will fit the seat but sticks out of the cockpit and cant fit a helmet at all so close starting the b model again with the engine block but this time an opposing 4 instead of inline an odd part its rare for lego to include parts specific to the bmodel so i was curious when i found this 2axle with pin a fairly new part in the main model its used in a place that a normal 3 pin would have been fine and its the only one of these in the whole set so it obviously must be needed in the bmodel sure enough theres an assembly here that needs it the front of the boat more upsidedown building and that silver piston is basically only there as a spacer it has no real function yet it turns out later an axle goes into it so its a support for one end of the axle adding the wheels we keep building around the engine this model uses the same wheel setup as the main model taking shape the bmodel instructions tell you to put the stickers on in case you havent  they actually did a good job making the sticker work on either model but the silver piston used as a crossbrace is a bit weird it can spin so that axle hole on the side ends up facing whatever way it wants the back end the flex axles are used here under the panels just for appearance and to support the exhausts at the right angle same fan propulsion as the main model and just as wrong here  worse the gearing is switched in the main model the pistons and fan spin pretty quickly as you push the boat across the floor in this one they turn very slowly more instruction weirdness im always curious at how lego decides to do instructions heres how the panels on one side of the boat are assembled for the mirror image on the other side they tell you to put all 3 pins into the short panel as step 1 2 black and a blue add the white piece as step 2 and then add teh second panel and stickers as step 3 why two different ways all done heres a similar angle as most of the official images looks ok i noticed though how obvious the wheels are the back of the box image is a lower angle that hides them more and i like the mudguard panels as seats pretty clever from the side im not fond of the profile it doesnt sit level like i think it should the wheels are a stud too low sticking out of the bottom the underside like most bmodels there are compromises theres pins and axles sticking out but thats what you do when faced with a limited piece selection minifig scale yet nope not quite a bit too big this time i think the driver is supposed to sit in the seat with knees over the front of the guard where the grey pin is so the minifig is way too small spare pieces very few leftovers in this bmodel the conclusion so whats my conclusion on this model the bmodel is fairly meh and too similar to the main model however i love the hydroplane racer itself it looks great and is very swooshable for the price its surprisingly large thanks to the big panels on the sides yes this is one set that really needs the stickers to look good but they look great and are well worth putting on the ratings value 910  close to 10 cents a piece and a fairly large model for the price design 910  looks great other than the tiny fan on the back minifigs na  i was tempted to give a score since a minifig almost fits but thatd be cheating playability 810  not much functionality other than the engine and fan spinning but very swooshable and sturdy enough to be played with parts 910  a bunch of panels including some new ones just about every kind of technic pin and quite a few thin liftarms  overall 910  the set is a solid winner as long as your satisfied with the main model	positive

the set is a looker youve got to admit it but what it gives in looks does not make up for what it lacks in functions i really wanted this set badly even when i restarted my adventure with technic about a month ago than i learned more and more about what a good model can do mostly thanks to this forum and yt right now im a bit disappointed with the arctic truck  smaller sets offer more functions and teach you much more jim it was a great review nevertheless edited by pgplay 14 december 2015  1122 am	negative

review  42001  mini offroader introduction technic mini models are sometimes regarded as models not worth buying i dont agree with this opinion whether its a special part or innovative building technique almost every mini model has something that makes the set worthwhile this time i will be reviewing the 42001 mini offroader this model is not a smaller version of an existing model so theres no real comparison with a bigger brother or sister if you will nor does the model resemble a real life brand or vehicle so it is what it is a mini offroader note all images can be clicked for hires versions set information number 42001 title mini offroader theme technic released 2013 part count 100 box weight 165 gr box dimensions 155 x 140 x 42 cm set price msrp 999 eur de  799 gbp  1299 usd price per part de 0100 eur  uk 0080 gbp  usa 0130 usd links brickset bricklink the box the box measures 155 x 140 x 42 cm which is obviously not very big the weight of the box is approximately 165 grams frontside the front of the box shows a though four wheel drive offroader challenging a fierce rocky mountain trailnow does it what the box actually shows is mini offroader challenging a small foam rock formation much like rocks used in star trek the original series yet smaller the box also states that this model is for the age of 7 till 14 more importantly the 2models in1 logo is clearly visible which means this set can be used to build two different models backside the backside shows a picture of the alternate model and a smaller version of the original model the conversion arrow and the 2in1 are printed to clarify that the main model can be converted into a secondary model sides one of the sides shows the 2in1 logo and a picture of the main model another side shows a picture of one of the wheels in actual size and again a picture of the main model contents of the box the box contains 2 booklets 2 bags 4 tires booklets this set contains two booklets which is not very common for a set this size both models share the same chassis which is why the build has been divided over two booklets one for the chassis 8 pages with 10 steps and one for the bodywork 34 pages with 23 steps for the main model and 20 steps for the alternate model bags the box contains only 2 bags which is to be expected from a set consisting of 100 parts one of the bags is filled with liftarms panels rims and two elastic bands the other bags contains all the other parts like pins axles connectors etc opening the bags results in the following collection of parts with the exception of the tires no abundant number parts that will add real value to your collection nevertheless there are some interesting orange parts and elastic bands tires the tires are provided seperately ie not contained in the bags from the picture you can see that these tires have a front and a back side so you should pay attention when fitting them to the rims which have two different sides as well highlighted parts this section describes the unique andor highlighted parts very small smooth technic panel 21 and 22 these two small technic were new at the time of release and this set was only one of two sets containing them in orange the other set is the 42007  moto cross bike at the moment of writing theres a third set containing these parts the black champion racer side a side b small rubber band i was under the impression that these white rubber bands werent that common but it seems that these bands are as common as dirt but hey you cant have enough rubber bands thin liftarm 1x5 with axle holes like the panels these liftarms were also new at the time of release looking at the the frequent usage in other sets this part has proven to be a most useful mammal thin liftarm 1x3 not a very rare piece per se but if you are not into bionicle this liftarm part can be hard to find your other option would be to buy the 9390  mini tow truck or the 8305  dual bikes from a while ago 2000 long pin with center pin hole this relatively new kid on the block is currently used in many technic and nontechnic sets and has well proven its worth axle pin connector hub with 2 axles like the previous part this newish part is also quite helpful in certain situations part list heres the complete list for all 100 parts building experience the build starts with the chassis of the offroader after connecting some liftarms two elastic bands one on each side are attached to the towball pins this is all there is to the suspension plain and simple the two elastic bands contract the lshaped liftarms which results in the long ends swiveling downwards the video below demonstrates the suspension the simplicity doesnt do it justice because it works like a charm the suspension is very smooth with the right amount of stretch and resistance this great working suspension adds a lot of value to this set to quote john hurt in the movie contact why build one when you can have two at twice the price i have purchased two sets so we can simultaneously see both models and make a proper comparison below you can see two identical chassis which will be used for both versions of the build at this stage we have arrived at the end of the first booklet which only took about ten minutes not surprising since the first booklet only has 10 building steps progressing to the second booklet you need to choose between building the main and alternative model thats a choice i dont need to make for this review so lets start with the main model main model when building the bodywork theres a rather peculiar building technique which you wouldnt expect in an official lego set the axle and pin connector hub with 2 axles only protrudes halfway into the double bent liftarm the thin 1x4 liftarm which is added in one of the following steps makes sure the hubs stay perfectly in place but i was still surprised to see this technique the finished bodywork for the main model looks likeuhhwelli dont know exactly it doesnt bear any resemblance to a real life model which makes it hard to judge one things for sure its not the best looking technic mini model the bodywork can be attached to the chassis by using a 7l axle and two bushes one on each side of the chassis alternate model unfortunately the alternate model doesnt look much better than the main model its even a stud less wide while you would like to see slightly more body matching the size of the tires and chassis attached to the chassis the body is even more out of proportion its not really ugly and the color scheme is great obviously this goes for the main model as well but the body simply doesnt match the chassis i can only imagine that this model is supposed to have a chibi look much like the microfighter star wars models comparison the following section shows a selection of images from different angles to compare the main and secondary model the main model has a bit more volume while the alternate model has a more sporty look front view the main model has headlights which are attached at a higher point while the alternate model has headlights which are placed more closely next to each other rear view a slightly different setup in both models where the main model again has higher placed rear lights side view the side view shows that the panels are used differently in both models the main models uses them as doors while the alternate model uses them as engine cover bonnet top view the top view reveals that the main model might have room for a minifig parts left the left image shows the parts which are left after building the main model while the second image shows the parts left after building the alternate model as you can see the main model uses slightly more parts than the alternate model features besides the awesome suspension which we already have discussed there arent a lot of features in this set theres actually a single feature which is only present in the main modelopening doors wow impressive well maybe we cant expect too much functionality in such a small model summary the offroader is a fun model which is fairly easy to build the suspension is simple yet very effective the model could do better in the design department but the suspension offers great playability and that is what this set is all about the orange parts are not very common so they are an added bonus all things considered this set is definitely worth the few bucks you need to spend on it pros great suspension fun to play with some semi rare orange parts great color scheme cons no resemblence to an actual offroader not the best looking model score below are my scores based on different categories 6 design not the best looking technic model 7 building experience the suspension makes it fun to build 7 features the suspension makes up for the lack of functionality 8 playability the model has carswooshability 7 parts some interesting orange parts 8 value for money great present for the younger builders 71 elastic hope you enjoyed it thanks for reading and please rate this set at the top of this topic	positive

during the annual thanksgiving road trip to the relatives i stopped by the tru in portland or lo and behold the new mars mission sets obviously i bought them  the box not much to say standard box art for mm sets nothing new the parts some good parts here even if you dont like the set which i highly doubt after ive had my say p  its a decent parts pack i noticed that some old parts have been renewed i know the wheel has been used in the 07 sets but the cockpit and hitch i havent seen in a while the vldss very large dss grr new part at least i think it is someone slap me if it isnt wacko the figs i know ive seen that head before but i have no idea where does anyone know i was hoping that the aliens would have new arms at least i was sadly mistaken on the upside i finally discovered that they glow in the dark  the alien has a jetpack if thats not the silliest thing ive ever seen i dont know what is the build simple build a block so easy a caveman cou oh never mind geicos used that one enough then we have this jobber right here not sure what it is but it looks like some crystal scanning device its starting to look pretty nice it almost looks practical the cockpit is suffering from a bad dose of overstickering on the upside we have a new piece there to hold the cockpit on part 1 complete it has a nice little radio antenna which is ruined by the use of a random missile that looks like its going to shoot the antenna before it shoots the alien still i never say no to a good missile i can use for something else the trailer fairly simple but it works it features stabilizing arms a handheld saw and an extremely random minibot whos purpose escapes me the whole meal deal erm general pics overall i thought this was a good set in fact it reminds me of this	positive

wub thanks for another great review sweet i am also glad that it is a very different alien fighter design as i already have three varients of the old type the fighter transforms better than i thought it would i was expecting just the wings i should be buying this set as well mr mandalorian on nov 26 2007 0345 pm said without antigrav support it would fall forward on its nose each time it transformed well since antigrav doesnt exist and will never exist there has to be another option looking at it in tank mode it does have a vague aerofoil shape so i think it should be able to work as a lifting body all it needs to do then is move fast enough to start taking off and then it can extend the wings 8	neutral

this one is much better than i thought i didnt expect the gun and the turret to be geared i agree that a lot of the details sux hollow inside lame cockpits but as an overall package it looks quite good the best part is no shooter is the nightmare finally over  the bonus robot is a much better idea the large amount of blue pieces make this a must buy for me as impartial needs more raw materials p how well do the tracks work the last tank was too light and it didnt roll well at all  thanks for these photos as well hinckley wub so far the 08 exoforce sets are looking good sweet hinckley on nov 28 2007 0448 pm said and actually i did feel the same way you did about the flying module until i put sinner in it and started to play p wow its big enough for my big walrus head wub	positive

thanks for that good review hinckley y a really interesting set and a turning point for lego minirobots instead of shooting crap pretty cool i hope the kidsll like it too for the design i love that asymmetrical look of the front part and the sleek guns of the flyer its smart that the gatling gun moves along with the tank too the set idea with two vehicles in ones not new but very play able and the treadsbig wheel designs cool i dont like the use of studless technic beams but well they do their job i guess and keikens cockpit should be easy to improve	positive
i think this is probably my least favourite set of next years selection but i still might get it partly because of this review thanks btw i quite like the minirobot and while there are a few problems the front cockpit the exposed axles i relish the idea of moding them out and correcting them and the change back to the original figs is welcome i didnt really get any of this years sets only last years makes it easier from a mocing potential anyway	neutral

oky wan kenobi on dec 16 2007 0846 am said lol those star wars heiroglyphics are awesome were those in the movie or is this just a joke by the lego designers that would be the first time tlc showed any kind of reference humor the rest of the set is great too even the skeleton and the stickers yes thats right i actually like those things i like the new skellies because of their posability im a big supporter  user of stopmotion and i think theres nothing wrong with stickers i mean seriously why does everybody hate stickers so much  sure they are a pain in the megablocks to put on and sure they come off after a while and are never usable again but hey you dont have to put them on even better you can save them like i do and use them for your mocs could somebody tell me please im just curious however as i said nice set i might even get one gotta love that marion with the carot torch xd and that arc is neat too by the way are all parts on it golden some more pics on it would be nice as soon as your camera is recharged  thanks peace out as far as i know those insignias on the arc are in the movie too but i dont remember if they actually were on the arc or somewhere else there are a lot of star wars references in all the indiana jones movies looking at your name you might find it funny to know that the asian club of lao che in temple of doom is called club obiwan the plane in the first indy has the callsign cpo which i just found out the other day 	neutral
my 2nd review what a veteran  again found this set via a shop assistant in my local tru portsmouth uk this evening comes in at 4499 which is pretty steep but you get quite a bit for your money front of the box  back of the box  back of the box closeup  contents  it was a nice surprise to get numbered bags  not had a large set with numbered bags for quite a while at least in none of the sets ive bought recently didnt take a close up of the stickers but i was quite disappointed that the curved pieces had stickers  if they could print the att curved pieces why not these minifigs  oh  and theres a nice backprint on the pilot figure  now the build was pretty good  you build the plane first after the minifigures quite an interesting build in a way becayse for a while you think the back is the front  and then you realise heh now  ive not seen the film in a while but i dont recall a guy flying a plane with a fishing rod  dont flame me if this is what happens see earlier point regards not seeing the film in ages p after that you build the temple in stages starting with the entrance first and then the holey floor section with the spears these spears are just loosely placed into technic holed bricks quite easy to make em flick out but they can go anywhere hehe entrance  holey floor  spears  these two parts are hinged and on an angle to each other and the gap makes for a handy bottomless pit complete with pole for indy to swing over with his whip after that you create the door and the ratchet mechanism to keep it raised after that you add the runners for the ball and the swinging knives trap swords trap  before  after  finally you build the statue that holds the efigy nice bit of construction here especially the way that everything falls over once the efigy is removed do be careful when putting the curved bits on though  it appears one of the edges on mine has slightly bent when putting it on  nowt noticable though temple  preparing to steal  run you can see that the temple has toppled and debris has fallen all around  and then as he goes through the door the door falls he gets his hat and then the rock ball starts a rolling ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun the stickers were a pain though  theres no room for a border around the sticker here beware after all that is done you join all the pieces together and it makes more a really good playset plenty of opportunity for recreating scenes here idol closeup  total set  spares  yet more spare stickers sorry ive already put the spares in my box of bits overall 8 out of 10  lots of play value and a pretty nice build too many stickers though  and defo poor arms for the skeletons edited by imperialshadows 01 june 2008  1218 pm	positive

kimt on jan 4 2008 1025 am said btw which set would you recommend market streeet town plan or cafe corner just curious theyre pretty expensive and i might only afford one of them i guess it all depends on what you are after kim if you want a really great and detailed set i would opt for the cafe corner but if you want a set that can easilly be included in a city i would opt for town plan since i cant afford all of them i will just get town plan because i lve the feeling of thge set and that theater is superb  yoda	positive
kimt on jan 4 2008 1025 am said btw which set would you recommend market streeet town plan or cafe corner just curious theyre pretty expensive and i might only afford one of them definitely the coffee corner its a hard desicion between coffee corner and town plan because they are both really great sets the market street is no must have in my opinion but the other two maybe you should start with the coffee corner its the older set the town plan is newer and will be available longer then the coffee corner i hope it helped you a litte bit  regards sandra edited by legocastlegirl 04 january 2008  1043 am	positive

wow im surprised no one had done this already first off this is a truly lovely set that many people should own even though its sold out on the sh   now lets start off with an overview note i was missing a few of the pieces the rabbit the trike when i toke the pics the figs and a cat the engine i really love this thing its a beautiful 060 steam engine with a tender this is probably the most detailed steam engine lego has given us i loved it so much i made a nonholiday version for my town the flat cars i like these but they seem a bit simple their cargo is good for christmas or a birthday party the passenger car it resembles the green passenger car we got a while back but i like the interior in this one a bit better the caboose a simple caboose like the one from 2001 the sad thing about it is thats there is no interior and its hard to take the roof off overall i like this set but it is kind of hard to use during the non winter months the price is kind of good but with that price it should have came with the motor i give it a 910 happy new year edited by agentrick57 04 january 2008  1200 am	positive

great review mate as usual for me the highlight of this set has to be the new spider droid even though its made up of some strange parts it really appeals to me i would love a few of those babys the hellfire droid is also well put together even if it is a little small but hey it looks fun i really like the look of this set but the price tag really puts me off why oh why did lego price it so high 	neutral

ah i finally got the 2 city sets i really wanted  i am so happy that lego went postal on us p  since they are rather small i shall do a mix review of these 2 sweet sweet sets 1 mail van 7731 like always ill start with shots of the box art and bloody dss now here are the extras of that set i really love the new torso of the postal worker my huge grip lies on the mail box that mail logo is a freaking sticker  for that part i was so expecting a printed part that is really really bad  apart from that the design is pretty cool the van is quite simple but i think its pretty cute i love the fact that the rear is a window 2 air mail 7732 like always ill start with shots of the box art and bloody dss the extras are ok another great postal worker you also have yet another red trolley with a package that is a bloody sticker yet again  g tlc should have more printed parts  that plane for me is a classic thing of beauty  really is consistent with the fantastic planes of the 80s thats the kind of lanes tlc should produce instead of those huge playmo planes actually i am happy that tlc released that one  for once its not a bloody airline exclusive promo set  here are general pics i love the engines of the plane simple yet superb also the top hatch opens to insert mail and packages the front control panel is a printed part  i love the classic double train windows and here is a poc of the undeneath of the set in conclusion i truly love these small sets they are the perfect size 4 wide car yeay  and the colour pattern is amazing as well i hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any  yoda	positive

nice review yoda i dont think i have ever read one with as much cursing of stickers d i love these two little sets the colour scheme the little different wheels on the post van and of course the new postmen uniforms would have been nice if they had included little satchels like in the new indiana jones sets oh well  postman yoda on yoda	positive
these little sets are really nice they cought my eye the minute i saw them it would have been so great if there was a post office to go with them there are so few buildings in lego city the design is very classic and i am ofcourse considering to get them but it seems that i have a lot of small cars and planes on my desk  recently i took a flight with cyprus airways from thessaloniki to cyprus and the two promo plane sets were there i was so tired though that i couldnt stay awake to buy them im taking a flight again on tuesday and i hope they are not out of stock thanks for a great review yoda a fine job as always cant wait for your next one	positive
thanks for the review i was always going to get these two sets so you havent swayed me at all xd i reckon lego could enhance this subtheme by releasing a post motorbike with or without a sidecar and post office obviouly the office would be the hub of all the activity while the post bike would take care of the postal run this would free up the van to take or recieve bulk mail or parcels to or from the airport it could then also do the parcel deliveries around the city the office would also serve as the reciever for all the parcels the new goods truck might deliver just some thoughts thats all sweet	neutral

hello and welcome to another redman set review well actually the first redman set review im your host redman and today i adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the impulse set simply titled the knight this is a great set with 14 pieces 2 of which are spare and a minifig with 2 weapons 2 helmets and some shiny armour all this is packaged in a tiny box just short of 10 cm or 3 inches with a neat little instruction manual that folds up to the size of the weapons rack included in the set as you can see this set only costs a measly 7 nzd disclaimer redman not included here we see the box clearly showing what the box holds on the top we see a 11 scale picture of a minifig for those new to lego or who have forgotten how big a minifig is i guess  xd the instruction manual showing the nice and easy built with me for size comparison d sorry about the dark image i had to lean over the light to get a birds eye pic  here we see the 2 different soldiers you can make with the set a knight and a guard or standard troop or soldier or whatever you want to call him note each set comes with only 1 minifigure and additional accessories of course you know im in the picture just for the sake of it im not really one of the soldiers xd the neat little weapons rack or rather equipment rack as it holds not only a weapon but a shield except the ovoid ones helmet and armour nice and easy storage so your equipment wont get dirty lying around on the ground d one of the spare parts is another of those robot hands so you can stick that in place of the shield and allow the rack to hold 2 weapons just thought youd like to know that  and here we see the nifty little structure of the thing it can even support a whole minifig note the grey stud on the bottom bar is a spare part i just find it better used there to hold the armour  huh i dont remember this picture 8 it appears i drifted off and these guys dont look too happy i overtook their weapons equipment rack  i should go xd so in conclusion this is a great set for army building at a reasonable price with nice equipment and it can be picked up as a little extra with your normal shopping xd thats all for today folks sweet redman so what do you think should i continue with these redman reviews  p or just stop now xd comments and criticism welcome  peace	positive

thanks everyone for your positive feedback its really appreciated d youd be surprised how long that redman presents thing up the top took me to make xd so it appears people do like redman expect him to be reviewing the good wizard and battle arachnoid in near future i know those have already been reviewed but new zealand never gets sets first so ill just be reviewing the sets i get xd thefrisian on jan 19 2008 0444 am said nice review very detailed y as for the spare parts mine didnt come with any both dark grey 1x1 round plates are used on the weapons rack one for the armour one for the helmet and i only got one robot hand for holding weapons thats strange maybe im just lucky xd i also got 2 spare orange viking horn pieces in my battle arachnoid d peace	positive

nice review sweet this is a must buy for me since i wub the new sand green giant troll now i just have to wait until its available in the us  general tarful	positive
thanks for this excellent review vader it seems you are succumbing to the castle side of the force i love the new helmet and the new orc torso is fantastic as well which is great to see that the troll faction has many ranks too the troll himself i love i agree with you in saying i prefer the sand green version the battle wagon is cool one of the better wagon designs and the flag is a great touch which improves it sadly the back is rather empty but a few modsll change that  and of course this set includes the infamous chicken pole one pic request if you have time vader could you please post a few pics of the new helmet on its own and on a human soldier please batbrick is back 	positive
thanks for the review vader the first picture of the troll is great the gold armour really shines xd a fantastic set ill definitely get a couple of these wub as for the ogresgiant trolls the dark tan one fits in the mine setting well but for above ground settings i prefer the sand green one y peace edited by iamded 19 january 2008  1021 am	positive

mr tiber on jan 19 2008 1116 pm said a troll driven by a turkey leg what a wonderful little detail d d thanks for the review vader very clever using a flag to hide that crazy firing device i find it rather odd they used blue pins for this black or gray wouldve been alot more discrete about the big trolls i think using different colours is good i dont think a troll force would be very organized so different colours would make the effect complete y  as for your troops looks quite fearsome definitely compared to my pathetic number of soldiers  a nice set but i would rather get the attack on tower though no matter about the price difference oh dont get me wrong i love the dark tan troll i just prefer the sand green one your right about trolls not being organized and i like to think that the trolls are from different areas etc	negative
vader on jan 19 2008 0132 am said am i the only one who thinks this helmet looks a bit like the juggernaut from xmen	neutral
vader on jan 19 2008 1245 am said heres a few quick shots of the 2 larger trolls we have so far i prefer the sand green one nice comparison shot judging from these pics i think i have to agree with you that green suits the troll better especially since the orcs are sand green as well indicating some relation between the two races if they are indeed separate races great review very detailed and with lots of pictures i was already interested in this set but after reading your review i want this set for sure y	positive
xwingyoda on jan 22 2008 0426 pm said tks for the review mate  now i have to bloody wait long because lego france has this line available in freaking march  pissed yoda on  d i love the new goblin p that helmet is really cool why on earth tlc didnt include that one in the dwarf mine  such another idiotic move  anyone keeping track of tlcs stupidity lately  that would be interesting  i clearly want a huge goblin army now hehe  and i totally agree with you mate the troll lokks better in sand green the cart itself is pretty lame imo  just a sordid excuse to include yet another annoying shooting crappy device but for a 21 set its okie i say  need my bad guys on  yoda i believe there is a topic around here somewhere based on bad lego ideas after getting this new helmet i really wish lego had included it with the mining set its bloody annoying having to buy yet more of them from bl  the shooting bit is better than some sets that have had one at least this one is smartly done and of course it can also be hidden	neutral

simonwillems on jan 20 2008 0259 pm said thanks for the review of this nice little set for its price 3 euros here in holland it contains quite a lot of useful parts the only thing that could have been better in my opinion is the wand i always liked this one i miss those wands they couldve used it but i think the wood wand kindda adds realis to the set and since many fans dont like their castle theme to be too fantasized i guess lego decided to use a mold that was still being used for various sets when i get this set im going to put it on the tower in the kings castle you know the one that is right above the throne room  thatll be a great spot and then ill finally have all the necessary characters the king in his throne the knights on the walls the wizard on his tower top and the princess in her tower room that floats in mid air and is connected to the throne room by a 2stud wide bridge d i love the kings castle siege set wub	neutral

nice review dr s i have been thinking long and hard about the scale of the planes in my town i would like to keep my passenger planes in their classic 4wide fuselage style but i really dont mind the new plane hull pieces if they are used as an enormous transport plane like the ilyushin76 unfortunately i cant afford this lovely new green one at the moment which would be perfect to go with my green army as i took too much of a hit buying the new 2008 star wars sets but i have modified my white one to take huge cargo loads in fact my apc is designed specifically to fit inside unfortunately im a bit busy to take pics at the moment but hope to put some up soon	neutral
dr s i was not planning on buying this set after my disappointment with the other large airplane but after looking at this image review i just might buy the green color is really the aspect that makes this airplane stand out i think it looks great thanks for the review	positive
thank for the review doc the only thing i like in this set is the small car so i will not buy this set just for it i really dislike those new planes toooo bbiiiigggg with this size this cargo plane can carry just fiew things what a shame i think that the way tlc has made the wings is not very good like the rest of those big pieces just my thought the positif point of this its that it makes me saved some money d	negative

i got mine today xd i too got an anakin clone wars head although im not really complaining since i already have an indy head from the motorcycle chase set it is really odd that they would pack in such a different looking head though also for those that think the head has no use try placing it under one of the braided new brown dwarf beards it looks pretty nice i think y on the set its wonderful the hieroglyphic stickers are wonderful marion especially her head and hair is wonderful and the anubis statues are nice too theres also lots of nice tan parts such as 20 round 2x2s and 8 1x8 bricks all in all its a great set for the price and i cant wait to get race for the stolen treasure and temple escape now sweet	positive

great review batbrick iamded got what he deserved xd	positive
thank you very much for a fine review batbrick y what the i never realized these cool grey barrels till now thats pretty interesting  the whole chopper looks very good with a well fitting power function its for sure a rewardable work to change that baby into a real mf version with accessible cockpit 	positive
thanks everyone heres part 2 the second instruction booklet includes instructions for both alternate models which is good i hate having too many manuals here she is the plane its very nice and well proportioned but where did iamded get that laser overview the landing gear is very sturdy and nice and the wings are surprisingly good top view iamdeds head fell into the propellers i was trying to save him honest a view of how the motor on this one works by pushing the orange button you can make the prop spin it is well integrated like the chopper though the prop only spins for about 2 12 seconds still its a nice feature the tail is also well made simple but lovable oh and check out that tank the prop spinning agh is that my hand final view there seems to be some sort of explosion here 8 well i think i got iamded more than me atleast the second model is also great though not as good as the chopper the lack of space to fit something into the cockpit brings it down a bit but it is a very nice model overall i recommend it though unlike the chopper it will be hard to mod into minifig scale so far so good with 4995 here are the leftover pieces from the model enjoy batbrick away 	positive
thanks guys heres the final part the instructions for the boat begin on page 46 the overall set its actually much nicer than i thought it would be the pictures on the box make it look ugly top view tommy guns do not actually come with set  side view the designers have done an excellent job with the hull considering the lack of many slopes pieces you can see it is pretty much minifig scale too here you can see that by pushing in the red technic axle the anchor on the front will be hauled back into the boat back view these outboard motors are pretty cool though i wish they could go own into the water more overall though the weakest model its still a lot of fun and has a clever way around the lack of a shapely hull i was impressed with it after the building it it even has two rounded snotty bottom pieces on the nose of the boat to give the impression it is speeding through the water with the front lifting up lots of leftover pieces for this one the pieces sorry about the poor photograph there it was getting late  overall the cargo chopper is another great set in the fantastic creator line loads of fun great play and some clever designs it challenges you to make your own things and even includes some nifty pieces bley barrels wub  i wont give it a rating but ill just say i certainly recommend it to fans of the theme and lego fans in general now finally iamded and i teamup in the face of a larger foe get that lord of pies batbrick away 	positive

6258 smugglers shanty overview smugglers shanty was released in 1992 it consisted of 69 pieces 3 minifigs two pirates one imperial and it cost 925 usd the set itself is a small but rather sturdy den for the pirates review the minifigs consist of two pirates and one imperial the minifigs are not all that rare which is disappointing i would of liked a rarer fig but still it is a good cheap source of pirate and imperial figures here is an overall shot of the set which includes the three figs the shanty which is made using palm leaves pieces and a nice grey shark nibbling at the soldiers oar a close up of the soldier rowing hard in his boat i would have preferred to have a normal soldier with shako hat as i have more officers than normal soldiers now and a close up snap of the main structure note the wine glass which was a nice touch funnily enough only 4 pieces of treasure were included in this set compared to the usual 8 gold coins in other sets a view from the back which also gives a good view of the pieces used to construct the shanty mainly simple black 1 by 1 bricks the shanty looks good from most angles but their are a few where the roof construction looks rather odd but that is just a minor nitpick yet another view from the front this time at a slightly different angle the yellow base plate looks rather nice too i prefer it over the tan pieces we trend to get nowadays attack the stupid drunk pirate in the background does not even notice overall i think this is a rather good set despite some shortcomings such as the lack of treasure and odd roof from some angles the shark imperial soldier and useful parts make up for it and of course the price is cheap on most auction sites i got mine for a mere 5 10 with the cheapest price on bricklink being 8 rate the set then leave your comments thoughts and opinions	positive

well since this topic has resurfaced i would add my 2 cents about my appreciation of this set it was the first and unfortunately the largest pirate set i owned as a kid but i played the wazoo out of it some of the minifigs have lost almost all their face printing after so many play sessions theres just something about the hut that appealed to me more than the cheesy skullface islands we keep gettingprobably that it wa kind of neutral good for my pirates settlers or islanders though the palm leaves were rather fragile and used to break off the studded parts it would be nice to get more of these beach village army builder sets edited by ardelon 21 september 2014  0340 pm	neutral
hi guys i picked these up the other day but its taken me this long to get round to posting the reviews so here we go tub comparison with a minfig thanks brainbox the lighting changes a bit throughout the photographs as it was going dark outside so i only really had my desk light and i kept getting in the way 4837 mini trains now the box i really like its no different to those of last years sets but the colour here is simply fantastic and really seems appropriate for the theme so this is what you get inside all the pieces are still inside the bag the optical illusion was accidental d  no pieces of particular outstanding interest but the dark green cheese slopes are rather nice look out for those later 1 2 3 this is the main model and uses all the pieces in the set bar these two which according to the inventory are spares but as with all my other creator sets im cheating and leaving them in this is far and away the best model of the three and evokes the iconic version of a steam train the green looks superb but im not sure whether thats due to the model itself or the actual colour moving on we get to the second model 1 leftovers yes i admit i was using a piece of paper this isnt actually a bad model i dont think its quite as nice as the previous one but its not bad its different from the first model as well which is good too muich of the same can be a bad thing finally we come to the third model leftovers now ill be honest i dont really know what this is its not that good a model compared to the other two thats all i can say really and of course all the pieces fit into the tub overall i have to say i do like this set despite the weak third model the strength of the primary and secondary models make up for any weaknesses in the third and i can imagine the pieces being fully usuable in building other trains while the basic idea of these tubs isnt quite as good as the xpods with regards portability and general niceness they arent bad and for a fairly cheap price 34 as well 4838 mini vehicles this is one of those set boxes that you see because of the ridiculously loud colours sound marketing scheme if you ask me ive managed it again there are pieces outside the bag or are there now these i like y  1 2 i dont know what the clip is for there isnt one on the other side 3 4 5 this is the main model of the set and again all the pieces are used bar these three the spares its quite a nice model although the cars a bit odd still i like the ramps and the colour scheme reminds me just a little of g1 ultra magnus hmm i think that boom arm could do with refixing 1 2 leftovers this is actually quite nice as well its that classic breakdown truck and the boom arm itself is quite nice with quite a bit of movement another solid model 1 leftovers im surprised by the amount of detail here actually not only have tlc included a spare wheel at the back but also what looks like a trailer hitch which all adds to the realism another nice model to round out a nice set and in the tub overall im not sure which of the two i like better when i bought them and on the way home i much preferred the train set but after building this set im not sure this is another good set from the year when tlc seems to be giving us so many there are some good pieces in here too and while theres nothing unique theyre still good so thanks for reading hope it helped someone and if there are any requests ill see what i can do thats requests for pics not songs   edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0656 pm indexed	positive

i got myself today 3 dwarfs mine defender and i have to say that sets does suck big time the plastic rubber band doesnt do squat and 3 wheels i really not enough i only built 2 of those and changed the front of it with 4 wheels and no plastic rubber band and i changed the 2x2 dark bley plate its still looks good but the crappy rubber band system is really not well thought off anyhow my orc army is growing  yoda	negative

green grocer reviewed by dunamis set 10185 2352 pieces 14995 from the lego store glendale ca build time 65 hours holy guacamole almost exactly one year after caf corner was released we get the third installment in the increasingly popular lego exclusive town series combined with the famous 10182 caf corner and its trusty companion 10190 market street this trio makes the foundation for an amazing city block of lego goodness for those new to this series of sets check out my reviews of the two previous sets in this line cafe corner market street i would not necessarily recommend reading too many of my reviews in one setting as you might experience loss of brain cells andor drowsiness you have been warned so how does green grocer stack up to the two previous sets you ask well follow along kind reader and i shall attempt to unravel this question the box the gigantic box is pretty standard and looks amazingly similar to the caf corner box the back of the box shows some of the features of the green grocer as well as a lot of the cool interior that was absent from the previous sets in addition we are shown an image of the three sets together and a small insert image showing how they connect together as if we could not master that difficult maneuver opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals as it seems to be the norm now we have the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets however upon opening the tabs we are pleasantly surprised to find a cardboard tray have not seen one of those in a while as you can see in the photo we have two 32x16 green base plates three instruction manuals and a bunch of bags that are broken into four groups group 1 has 12 bags and goes with the first manual and builds the first floor group 2 has 9 bags and goes with the second manual to build the second floor group 3 has 14 bags and goes with the third manual for the top floor and roof and one bag that is not numbered and hence you can open it whenever you feel like it there are no stickers  yay moving right along we get to the three instruction manuals the manuals the three manuals are 55 47 and 47 pages in length they are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings  piece call outs for each step  parts inventory at the end of the second manual  page numbers color separation in these manuals was fine for me except dark bley and black we get a nice photo of all three sets together plus we get a nice tip showing how to split up the bags and what goes where those additional pieces you see in the photo just below the numbered bags are the pieces that come from the single unnumbered bag along with the base plates parts list random manual shot the pieces upon opening the first set of bags one thing is clear there are a ton of little tiny pieces the minifigs are included in this first section as well interesting to note that there are a handful of printed pieces and as i mentioned previously no stickers we also get a host of new and exciting pieces to add to our collection keep in mind my scope of lego sets is generally centered around star wars technic creator and the occasional racer set so what is new to me might have been around 15 years at any rate here are some of the more interesting pieces again note the printed tiles this time around lego has decided to include 33 more minifigs than the caf corner and market street sets yes we get four minifigs instead of three here are the cast of characters pictured left to right is sir top hat miss jenny blue overalls patti o furniture and little timmy cub scout ill leave it up to the minifig aficionados to decipher which torsos are new and to tell us all about the hairpieces i can say with reasonable certainty that the four yellow smiley heads are not new somebody check that dont forget the lovable little cat named tom he is the archrival of the mouse jerry that lives downstairs overall there are a lot of pieces large variety and wide range of colors the build if you have either of the two previous sets you will feel right at home here just like in the previous builds it seems like the first ten build steps are consumed with laying a bunch of 1x1 1x2 and 2x2 tiles everywhere almost feels like 30 of the pieces are used up right away see below there are several sections where you build various parts of the interior take a look at the cash registercounter below and the beverage cooler and the produce stand and everything that goes in it looks like someone has mail looks like someone just had a baby this set is incredibly well done and gives inspiration to go back and add similar items to caf corner and market street as before the average builder is introduced to some new building techniques like using the hinge plates to make the angles on the front of the building as shown below also the top of the roof shows some interesting ideas overall it is a really fun build that kept me entertained the whole way the design this is a great set with lots of little details i especially like the little mouse hole in the wall leading to the jerry the mouses area they even included a little slice of cheese it seems the designers cant get away from the usual staircase which i always feel is way too big maybe future designs can incorporate a spiral staircase to save room for other things in the model one welcome addition is the fire escape as seen below im going to show a bunch of examples of various items in the set so you can get the feel of the amazing detail in this design take a look at the lamps torches just outside the door and the streetlight with fire hydrant brickwork and archway awning here is the back side of the building note the trashcans and yard tools here is a closeup of the railings on the second story balcony and the second photo is the finished product with curtains in the window nice use of cups to make the banister on the second floor here is the fireplace on the second floor second floor staircase with toms hiding spot check out the radiator on the third floor more third floor nice grandfather clock and rug third floor check out the deck that is up on the roof complete with two chairs table umbrella flower pots and grill interesting use of minifig hammers on the roof finally here is what is left over when were done a couple of shots of the front a shot of the back and here are all three together overall thoughts this is an incredible set and the best of the three in my opinion it is hard to top caf corner but i believe green grocer just did i absolutely love all the details and building techniques that went into making this set there is a ton of different parts and wide color selection as usual we get a bunch of tiles and small plates but that goes with the series also we get four minifigs and lots of minifig accessories im giving this set a score of 100 i thought about it and i really dont know how they could have made it any better in short run dont walk to go pick this set up final rating 100 build 1010 excellent  lots of nice interiors details and accessories to build functionality 1010 outstanding raises the bar with interior and detail think caf corner on steroids design 1010 excellent  cant say enough good things about it parts 1010 great selection and diverse colors great minifigs price 1010 price ratio is excellent but lots and lots of little parts well worth the price as alway feel free to comment complain and question what you see here id like to hear your feedback on this amazing set	positive
a great reveiw dunamis y  you have only backed up what i thought when the pictures first appeared if you are a lego fan there is no excuse not to buy this set it is a must have i love the mouse hole and the mouse and his cheese wub 	positive
very nice very nice indeed lots of lovely little details even at the back this review hasnt changed my opinion one bit im still looking forward to when i can finally pick up mine at the post office im crossing my fingers that there will be more buildings following after this one im guessing that legos just testing the waters to see how far afols are willing to go regarding price vs details green grocer is still epic though	positive

thanks for all the feedback as you can tell i really enjoyed building it cardinal brick on mar 8 2008 0926 am said is it the first set youe given 100 to yes it is i gave cafe corner a 96 and i felt this was a better set and improved on the things that i dinged cafe corner on lack of minifigs was one thing thats why i enjoy reading the comments so i can see if my ratings are in line with what everyone else thinks and to see if i missed anything i cant wait for some of you to build it and share your thoughts as well	positive

ive got something i want to share with you a beautiful dream came true 1 the box top back the alternate model is also very well done the pneumatics dump the bucket and open the flap  open you can see a diagram how the pneumatics work just a happy kid playing the plastic inlays  all 2 the parts as you can see 8854 offers a very large variety of different parts loads of technic bricks gears and even plates also note the threaded axle 10 5 large pulleys a big turntable and the 1x20 rack 3 building the mechanism for the outriggers and the rotation of the turntable the turntable the pneumatics are finished the mechanism for the telescope the finished model 4 random shots you can see how the turntable will be rotated thanks for reading erm viewing the pictures please comment if you want to	positive
really cool set this has convinced me that i really want it	positive
wow another old technic set review by you nice set and thanks for that review	positive
looks like you have the original 1989 version with the yellow top cylinders  i got one too several years ago although i probably paid too much for it p on a side note if that pneumatic tubing feels harder and stiffer than the modern type i highly recommend that you dont use it and buy some of the newer stuff off bricklink instead tlc originally used a different material for the tubes and this stuff degrades the nozzles on pistons switches and so on over time the old tubes also grip the nozzles much more firmly and if you arent careful when removing them its actually possible to rip off the nozzles completely xo i had this happen a few years ago although tlc replaced my broken pistons for free i got rid of that stuff for good after that although the pistons on my power crane still have slightly discolored nozzles edited by cp5670 10 march 2008  0457 am	neutral
simonwillems on mar 10 2008 0132 pm said that threaded axle never stopped intriguing me it was use in so few sets i believe 8851 contained one as well and i still dont know why its better than any other axle the purpose of the threaded axle is to carry tension regular axles are used primarily for carrying torsion for gears sometimes for compression 8855 landing gear helicopter skids and sometimes just for looks roll cages canopies but used in tension connectors will usually just pop off with the threads and the corresponding nuts this part can be used to squeeze parts together like the pen in the plotter of 8094 or to hold heavy assemblies onto turntables like 8862 and 8851 with the power crane 8854 reviewed here that is the complete list of sets which used this part i wrote about it here httpwwwericalbre1984htmlparts eric	neutral
as i bought it i didnt even know i would also get a box it just said all parts with building instructions after opening the parcel i was like woah woooaaahhh and so on  i love legoboxes because as a child i stood in the toy stores starring at the boxes only seeing the front and the back nothing more this brings back some memories 	positive

this set is really cool i might actually get it	positive
ive seen a few cases like this where the box pictures are slightly different from the actual model the airtech claw rig compressor is another one that comes to mind the changes sometimes seem pointless and make you wonder why they bothered p quote the only original stickers are the front headlightpatterns on the 2 red 1x2 bricks the others have been destroyed  must have been the bad decaying sticker quality that breaks when youll remove it  so i printed them i didnt print the flag for only the alternate model needs it although its a neat idea the other stickers on mine have held up pretty well although i didnt try to remove them after i put them on the flag started to break after a year or so and just fell off its axle at one point i taped over it and its holding up well now although its a little frayed along one edge this is actually the earliest set ive seen that uses this crappy sticker material which is unfortunately very common today even other technic sets had good stickers for many years after that	negative

sweet first pic review y i got this set for a birthday present last year and it is pretty fun overall the alien ship in this set is actually one of my favorites it just looks cool and the way you can fold it out is really clever the only negative for me is the cockpit of the mining unit not really because it isnt detailed but because mine is top heavy and keeps falling forward its kinda funny if you think about him driving along and then falling forwardbut not funny at all when youre playing 	positive

thanks for the review i think ill certainly get these sets they look very nice and have nice minfigs i love racing as long as minifigs could sit in them the fact that there are so much stickers make me think this is an model building theme like when you build plastic cars with all those tiny pieces and a load of stickers but that sshaped thingy does already exist doesnt it edited by matn 23 march 2008  1140 am	positive

thanks for resizing the pics it is strange that you didnt know about that zpiece before it was well used in old space sets the cars are pretty nice but i think the people sit way too high in them  the windscreen gives almost no protection i am planning on modifying them to 7 studs wide since thats my current standard for this kind of race cars seriously looking forward to the next review	neutral
as i said elsewhere i couldnt see this reviewed anywhere so here you are to start with a couple of box shots the contents and the parts laid out the instructions this is what was left over from the build and heres the kit complete build time about ten seconds if you pick your nose whilst you are doing it d i love the little robot it reminds me of that weird machine in the first wallace and gromit adventure in fact give it some skis and you are away oh and it has a metal detector thingy which i might have to borrow for a future episode of grunts im not sure if i have any alreadywho knows cost  £249 value for money erm no knock a quid off and id say yes dr s	positive

big or small we all love our legos and for that i thank you for the review i would have had liked to see your opinions though about the price the playability or anything else youd care to share about it and perhaps how it fits with your collection ive always been hesitant about getting this set because to me i feel like i have it all already but im missing that dog radar gun and 50 mph sign 	positive

another nice review the slow shutter speed pictures are great i think that was the only set with 8 distinct functions for a very long time and was only displaced by the 8455 backhoe in that respect the turntable on the back doesnt turn very well though as the weight is all distributed on one side the screw axle prevents it from popping off but there is still a lot of friction in it i dont have mine built anymore but it might be worth trying to put a weight brick or something on it quote do you have 8455 as well id love to see how they compare side by side it looks bigger than 8455 but i dont own any of the big old chuncky tires so i find it so hard to tell yeah its quite a bit bigger when everything is fully extended it becomes something like 26 long although the 8455 actually has morebetter functionality edited by cp5670 24 march 2008  0815 am	positive
yeah i meant theyre rare  but i can imagine that a normal axle with the old half bushes will help sometimes these are really strong if you put 23 in a row edit i just tried it a normal 10l axle with 2 interlocking old half bushes type 1 on each end i chose those who only can be moved very hardly along an axle i slewed the bjst  back arm a few times tried the pneumatics parallel to it and it didnt loose edited by bernddasbrot 24 march 2008  0606 pm	neutral

by the way dont forget to build the alternate model of 8862 it is a combine farm equipment which is just as good as 8274 i liked it so much that i bought two copies of this set so i could display both my favorite alternate model not counting universal sets is the 8480 submarine maybe it is time for a white set review skull white is pretty rare for your blue set i recommend you review 8462 there are only a couple of green sets and 8479 is the best and then of course 8458 is silver i think we all know what the best black set is and according to your photography you have lots of them but dont forget 8868 eric	positive
bernddasbrot on mar 24 2008 0539 pm said could you explain your thoughts please you know my english skills  i was thinking you could somehow attach a 16tooth dark gray gear the one that spins freely around axles to the nut which would make the axle move in and out when the gear turned and convert the gears rotary motion to linear motion in a fairly compact package although there are other ways of doing the same thing that dont use such rare parts and the 2008 technic sets will come with prebuilt linear actuators anyway	neutral
quote 8462 rocks as a blue set i just got it a few weeks ago lets see 8462 also is one of the last technic sets i would call oldschool 8479 okay too but 8458 is imho not yeah the tow truck was the last set that still used mainly studded beams they made many changes to technic the following year with models becoming predominantly studless and making heavy use of the flexible axleshoses and decorative panels the technic logo and box art style was also changed a lot i really like the overall construction of that set the model is fairly lightweight but extremely sturdy it must be one of the strongest large sets theyve released quote did you had something like this in mind thats basically the idea as blakbird said though it wouldnt be very powerful and would put the axle under some stress the linear actuators theyre bringing out this year do the same thing and should work much better	positive

excellent review y getting a better chance to look at this set actually makes me interested in it i was in my dark ages throughout the islander days though i have built up a small force of them 10 from ebay buys but no actual sets if this is really as reasonable as you say there i may just have to pick one up soon oddly i do own the baseplates to this set having also picked them up in a lot on ebay so i might be able to recreate it manually but i think id rather pick one up whole it looks like a great mix of parts and makes a decent looking display piece thanks again for the fine review y	positive
excellent review i really like this set and so i gave it a 55 this set is on my list to get i especially like the speedy pirate boat and the also very fast outrigger canoe with a sail i dont think a small number of these cannibals will make much of an impact on gaming though even if they get a bonus with spears duke	positive
a great and informative review with very fine pictures thanks slyowl sweet a wonderful set this is indeed full of nice details and pretty playable and a cool subtheme that offers a lot of fantasy and charming characters in a marvelous layout i really love that little boat with the outrigger and the neat buildings and sweet landscaping works together very well tlc got sued for using some names of native sounding origin now that sounds really strange to me such names´re widely spread within novels movies and such stuff i didn´t know that there´s some kind of copyright on them 8	positive
good review mr slyowl and good pics too i know it probably deserves better but i only give him a 3 ill be surely the only saying that i dont like this set but i remember i had it for christmas when i was a child and it disappointed me very much because i expected it much larger after seeing it in the lego catalogs well its just a little trauma i had p lol anyway i must admit its an interesant set specially because of the large number of minifigures and accesories it brings with and the two little ships edited by bluebard 31 march 2008  0113 am	positive

i was just going into my dark ages when lego began the islander themes so ive never really cared for them but this review actually made me want this set real bad i guess this is what reviews are for then  good job on the review	positive
great review i recently got this set for only 150 sek around 17 and it´s really good	positive
fortunately i got this set on 2000 not the released version the original one and i said fortunately because its a lovely set how could i rate it but awesome a little islander army the islander girl ironhook and that cool boat with two sails the jailpolynesian statue i must recognize that i have a thing with the islanders i know that they are weird poorly based on the polynesian aborigens etc but they are very original broke with the traditional enemies and gave to the pirates theme an exotic and wild look	positive
what an amazing old set i loved pirates in my childhood but that was before the islander and spanish stuff mine were the bsb and soldier fortress with the big baseplate as im now returning to pirates ive tracked down most of the 2009 sets and of course bought the new 2015 sets but knowing i missed this middle period of islanders vs pirates makes me a bit sad those islanders are soooo monkey island those of my age likely feel the same to my eyes oh for a lemonhead minfig  im curious now how much this set sells for given it was apparently one of very few lego actually rereleased i recently bought a misb bsb that was an early 2000s rerelease and it was very pricey but then i suspect the bsb has a lot more of a nostalgic following these days than this set can anyone give me a rough idea what this set goes for in asnew condition these days regardless a fantastic review with some great photos of the whole set and minifigs even though this is an old thread i am glad someone else bumped it recently so i can add my thoughts too  one thing ive noticed comparing the newest pirates sets to the 80s ones i had as a kid and these from the 90s is the move away from baseplates and big panel pieces i actually like that in a lot of ways whilst i miss baseplates being included as they are a great starting point for creating new things and make the sets easier to play with visually i think legodesigned model sets look better without them	positive

a great review thank you i do not know these old sets like this one but it is very cool to see how they were made i have an unopened 8421 maybe i should do a small review of that when i get to build it btw boxes are expensive so at a given price point its a choise between more bricks or nicer boxes i have no doubt what most people would chose front edited by front 06 april 2008  1021 pm	positive
simonwillems on apr 7 2008 1201 am said somehow i competely missed your review when you first made it i saw your pics on brickshelf and wondered about the review you have managed to review my all time favourite technic set yeah somehow i wonderd why only vbbn thanks responded but i learned from yodas sig patience  for a jedi it is time to eat as well  eat eat  hot  good food  d simonwillems said it was the first large technic set i was given by my parents when it first came out in 1995 i played for hours with this set making minifig seats in it it was so huge there was room for four minifigs to sit next to eachother in front i made various applications for it a bungeejump system with a large rubber band and lots of containers to be lifted the first changes i made included the inverting of the wheels and the disabling of one of the flashlightsteering wheels because they obstructed eachother by the way the nob for your winch is yellow instead of black i know this set by heart so watch out p  i always liked those nobs and people think you cant play  moc with technic at all xd about the nob erm yeah i only found 3 black ones in the box and so i took the yellow one that i got as an extra with 8829 simonwillems said the alternate model was great fun too the pump is cleverly hidden and the crane folds up great between the cab and the loading platform you could easily mod it with a pneumatic claw on the crane a motor to turn it and a compressor the only flaw was the loading platform which had no floor only some axles another reason for the 8460 as favorite set its got a real alternate model not just a different erm crane simonwillems said thanks so much for reviving my memorie concerning this great set youre welcome i consider this as my job  cp5670 said but i keep all of them there was actually a time when the boxes used to be even stronger i have an old 8859 set and the outer box is made of a hard styrofoam material although they probably stopped using that for environmental reasons thats the spirit i got more than hundred boxes and my 8848 box came with styrofoam too	positive
thanks guys  sinner i hope you refered to 8285 so my answer will match 8285 is interesting main model american styled truck alternate model european styled truck i dont think tlg produced many european styled truck edit i just found a wonderful mocalternate on brickshelf 8436 by industrialdesigner if i got him right he designed a few offical technic sets for tlg  all promises promises promises hm and again its ebay thats blocking me i want to foreshadow my next review although itll take some time to make it i know you know but please act inconspicuous until youll can act very astonished edited by bernddasbrot 09 april 2008  0325 pm	neutral
alex54 on apr 15 2008 0857 pm said those giant ants are made in a smooth plastic in dark red and trans black colour im pretty sure those ants are actually spiders i really wanted an in detail review of this set with opinions as well as pictures and you provided the goods alex54 i really need another tent i can later use it for rebel troopers and i love the selection of minifigs the new spiders are freakin awesome why didnt lego make them before this set is a must buy for me i guess in the uk it will be £899 edit where did you get this set alex54 i really want to know edited by the rancor 15 april 2008  0913 pm	positive
actually they are ants spiders have 8 legs while ants have only 6 like these the two thing that look like legs in the front are the antennae back on topic i think this set looks great and i cant wait until i can get my hands on it and the other new ij sets edited by erdbeereis1 15 april 2008  0926 pm	positive

front on apr 16 2008 1015 am said they must be ants but im pretty convinced that what you think are the antennae are the ants mandibles or not there are six legs 2 antennae and 2 mandible and they most definately are ants to those still in doubt thanks for this great review alex this is most definately well in my opinion anyway the best set lets face it in motorcycle chase you really only got 2 bikes and 2 crates as the big parts of the set in this one which is the same price you get those ants a neat tent hurray a bprintedi map a chicken leg a castle sword ef sword and pirates sword a dagger now in light bley and a silver frying pan this set is packed with useful pieces im definately getting this one and i for one love mutts hair piece i sense my sigfig will soon have a new hair style thanks again alex for the sweet review peace edited by iamded 16 april 2008  0507 am	positive

nice little review here alex i like your idea to make the aquatic car into one for a geologist i really like the little details in this set such as the little petrol can and the propeller at the back of the car a must buy in my view thanks again	positive

darthperson8 on apr 15 2008 0712 pm said what are those bricks with the guns attached supposed to be great review and set btw some people have obliquely mentioned this in their responses to the setreview but to specifically answer your question its supposed to be a jerrycan aka a gasoline petrol container	neutral
this set looks good about the jerry cans i like how they give me more pistols this may be the only indy set i get from this batch ill just have to deal with the fleshie heads exchange them for yellow like stealth hunter said this will be good for army building silent help	positive

great review thanks a lot for all the pics i agree that this is probably the nicest set of the indy 4 wave so much dark green and i love all the plant pieces its been ages since weve had enough pieces in a regular release to build nice forests so its great to see 11 of the dark green leaves in one set and all the vines the design of the cutter looks very solid and brick built as well giant ants are great looking too	positive
wow those trees look so weak compared to those enormous blades anyway a highpossibilityandappealtouscompulsivelegoshoppers set so ill try to get it which means ill obsesively look until i find deforestation of puny trees on	neutral
thanks for this fantastic review alex those trees are a neat add on to any jungle as is that sweet cave but the main part of this set the jungle cutter man that is wicked packed with that awesome dark green and with those wonderful treads not to mention the smoothly spinning buzz saws however this sets a tad overpriced in my opinion and looking through the instructions they have that crazy colour syndrome again using blue yellow and red parts in the internal build still thanks for this sweet review with neat pics thumbup peace	neutral
thanks for the review alex i agree that this is the best set of kotcs sets although the airplane comes quite close although im not too fond of the trees the cave is good and the jungle cutter is brilliant plenty of great features and very detailed with much of the engine showing and a decent cockpit if thats the right word the general and the two soviets are great too could we have a closeup pic of them please  good to see that neither torso has exposed fleshy skin like the nazis as said though it is quite a pricy set i was expecting it to be just over the price of race for the stolen treasure great set thanks again alex	positive
looks great	positive
this is around the time that many consider the decline of castle in which point i somewhat agree but admittedly it still looks like a very playable set and the tree is very well done thank you for the review	positive
this is probably one of my favourite sets andor one of the sets which i wish i ownedthe 90s was probably my favourite castle era tobad i was to young to buy this set when it came out man i wish i had one of those dragons they were one of the best type i reckon although all the dragons are good thanks for the reveiw edited by hollisbrick 16 april 2008  0741 am	positive
agent rick youre definately the dragon master around these parts what a great little set i really like the classic dragon which reminds me of a similar style used for the lego crocodiles and the dungeon is pretty slick too i like the use of the large gates plus the doors plus the set contains the blue wizard awesome great review	positive
this was the last castle set i got before my dark age really liked it although the big rock parts looked really bad  i am kind of used to them now unfortunately i lost the little wand and i never understood who is good and who is bad does the wizard own the dragon well they dont seem to be enemies but isnt the dragon supposed to be evil	positive
thanks for the great review sinner i like the technic bikes i wonder how it would look if you replaced the gear on the back wheel with a smaller one	neutral
i have just finished building this set i was a bit disappointed with the amount of bricks when they were out on my table but the final model is really nice and totally makes up for that i like the small details like on the handles and fuel tank and the only real negative thing i can say is that the cog seems a bit oversized in the rear i dont know if the designer frequents this forum but im sure he will be happy about how much you like it  it took quite some timeprototypes to get to this design sorry about the size of the picture  it isnt mine	positive
thanks everyone for your comments thanks lasse d for that picture too ickelpete on apr 22 2008 0609 am said i wonder how it would look if you replaced the gear on the back wheel with a smaller one ill try to take a photo this weekend hinckley on apr 23 2008 0810 am said best review of a lime green technic dirt bike ever really it is i just dont understand the allure of the bike very much where does the fabuland fig go i did try to find a figure any figure that would fit my final fantasy ones were too small and the galidor girl one looked silly as it made he look saddle sore hinckley on apr 23 2008 0810 am said it must be cold in that room nice shirt but the vertical hold is broken front on apr 23 2008 0859 am said i must say thats a nice collection of motocross bikes the employe is displaying building technic is such a specialist dicipline i think it takes a lot of patience to finalize the design of a model even such a relative simpel one as this cute bike front indeed it would i marvel at how they are explained so relatively simply in the instructions it must take a lot of tweaking to have the model easy to assemble	neutral
i wasnt very interested in this set at first it seemed to be just a nice looking truck with a small motor but when i found out it had a transmission i changed my mind here is the transmission it allows the single motor to be used for two functions this system has been around for a while and lego seem to be using it more and more the transmission driving ring alone the red circle goes for 515 usd on bricklink and you also need the catch and clutch gear so i have been buying sets that have them instead i now have enough parts to make a supercar gearbox i bet a new supercar comes out next year now this is the gear that rotates the arm note the colour of the 24 tooth gear it seems to be a new gear trend a lot of work has been put into this truck looking real personally i think they went too far as the truck seems to have been designed for a tilting cab but its disabled to prevent breaking the front bottom of the transmission the bottom shaft lifts the arm note that there are more dark grey gears the motor fits in very well also the bottom of the arm i was surprised by the usage of a 12 tooth bevel to link with the 36 tooth double bevel as i had never seen that done before as you can see there is no room for any drive train standard steering for a recent technic truck there is a handofgod at the cab top that links via two knob wheels it looks good from the back you can also see the white clutch that connects the transmission to the motor to avoid burnouts it goes decently high and can go a bit higher if you use the crane arm compared to last years fire truck if i didnt buy the fire truck for half price i would have been annoyed that lego brought out what is almost a motorised version of the same set functions cherry picker arm motorised rotate and lift that links to a motor via a transmission and antiburnout clutch steering rack and pinion controlled via a handofgod linked by knob wheels doors open and close good functionality that works well but i wish they made the cab lift and im a bit sick of the lame fairing door trick 710 parts motor battery box transmission clutch practical wheels only two fairings compact turntable this is a great parts set 1010 price at 9999 aud for 726 parts its ok value when you consider what you are getting the us price is 6000 which is better but still not great i bought mine for 80 aud which was good however and i suspect that the price is designed for easy sale810 looks id buy this for the looks alone 910 fudge the functions work well and i llked it more than i thought i would oddly mine seemed to be missing a axle pin with friction but since it includes extra parts for the alternate model i didnt mind using one of my spares on the subject of the alternate model it is a dump truck which is made out to be a total rebuild but it isnt it could have easily been done like super street sensation was but lego have probably determined that instructions like that confuse people 810 overall recommended 810	positive
great review i never have been interested in this set i am saving my money for a grey technic set or thatt technic ferrari set	neutral
thank you for that fine review of a pretty cool and nice set with a very good amount of functionality and um playability for sure	positive
imperialscouts on apr 23 2008 1104 am said well its mostly from the mindstorms robotics side honestly if i bought this it would be my first technic set ever another illusion shattered interestingly ive never bought a mindstorms set as i have enough programming to do for work without doing it for fun i have been tempted though	neutral
thanks sveltecorps i was really hoping that the conquistador helmet would end up being silver in the final set but i suppose its good to know that the helmet is being porduced again anyway and is the armour the skellie is wearing pearl gold thanks again i look forward to the rest of the review edit the dark tan baseplate is in fact very nice although the fact that you have to put stickers on it is a real downer but i suppose it is good for those who want it plain edited by tinypiesrus 01 may 2008  0219 am	positive

sveltecorps on may 1 2008 0244 am said e central turret thing this thing is kind of annoying and doesnt really sit or work well its kind of like a laser beam sending messages to space i guess as the central dome rises the two plates peel away i find it is a little bit tight to work smoothly and the two plates doesnt really sit well together at the top maybe i just need to rebuild it im sure this will also be explained in the movie great review now im really truly convinced that im gonna buy this set my faith was a little wobbly but its benn restored anyway i just wanted to point out that the temples entrance might actually be the turret thing if you watch the teaser there are some very similair stone pillars surrounded by sand there are 4 not 2 though  and when they close up it looks like all our characters are sucked into the sand and magically appear underground going through some stone plateswhich act like steps to go down that dissapear so in theory those steps beneath the turret are actualy the entrance and im asumming from this picture that the steps with 1x8 bricks with the dragon heads at the end lead us of somewhere else all in all this temple looks like a mixed up version of the real temple which is fine by me sidenote im not sure but based on minifig inclusion either lego was cheap or colonel dovchenko is dead by the time irina and her goons reach the temple ill wait till i see the movie  edited by belloq 02 may 2008  0214 am	positive

nice review wilhelm screamer very thorough the pictures are a little dark and blurry though i made a tutorial here for amateur photography tips i also edited your first post to include a link to alexs review great job	neutral
an extremely thorough review  you definitely do this set justice looks like a fairly interesting set and that comes from someone who isnt particularly a fan of lego indiana jones tom	positive

nice review good pictures thanks i think i may get a couple of the smaller sets as i think these will become collectors sets in years too come not sure this range will be that popular love the minifigs though	neutral
batbrick thanks for the sweet review you give me great insights into this set hehe i agreed that racer x is nice but i believe we can get it in the other set for a much lower price for me the trailer which does not have a cover is bugging me alot thats why i holding my reservations against this set at most i will consider the other 2 smaller sets for collection purpose nevertheless batbrick great job	negative
thanks for the great review it seems like the most awesome part of the set is the sticker sheet which is a reversal of the usual situation	positive
i enjoyed the review some cool fleshie heads and parts but it does seem a bit lamer even than i imagined from the box the airy truck is rather slyly disguised on the box art i would like to get it if it is ever on sale 50 off would be nice  speed racer lego doesnt seem to be selling too well in local shops here	neutral

trooperdavinfelth on may 16 2008 1111 pm said although i know you dont take many pictures in your reviewsimho  but can we see a little more about the tumbler ill get some set up tomorrow in better light to be honest there isnt a lot to see most of it is just basic technic blocks underneath with all the slopes built up on top	neutral
thanks a lot for the review brickbitz i really love this set sure the figs are annoyingly not new but the ice cream truck is fantastic and the tumbler is a marvel of black slopes i see now that it is far too huge though i reckon i will either keep it that way as a mega tumbler mod it to become another battank keep it as a model tumbler or pull it apart and use the bits to make a tumbler like wetwires awesome one love those popsicles though and those wheels are very nice so overall as a loyal batfan i love the set even though it couldve been better batbrick away	positive
nice review i really cant believe that it is out already i love that new batman suit and the tumbler have they made the posicles before this is sure a must have	positive
a nice review of an interesting set thanks brickbitz a great new batman a funny ice cream truck and a pretty detailed tumbler and although i wish that vehicle would be just a bit smaller i almost wonder that it´s not even bigger compared to tlc´s other batvehicles and well the interior could be better too	positive
the tumbler is massive ill struggle to fit it into the cave but never mind the figs are nice the tumbler is pretty accurate or at least it will be after ive moded it and jokers tainted ice cream van is so very joker thanks for the review btw	positive
general grievous reviewed by dunamis set 10186 1085 pieces 8995 from lego shop  home build time 35 hours it is the start of summer here in california and along with the weekly deluge of new action films we start to see some of the next wave of star wars lego sets the latest offering from our favorite building toy company is none other than the infamous general grievous no doubt you all know the story of grievous two parts technic and one part human and his hatred of the jedi follow along as we get a closeup view of the mighty general no doubt the observant will wonder why i purchased this set from shop  home instead of my trusty lego store in glendale well it’s really as simple as two things i’ve been traveling a lot and didn’t have time to drive to the store to get it and gas is now 4gallon and i would likely spend more in gas than the 9 shipping cost to get it to me so there you have it the box a gigantic box much larger than expected held the mighty general we’re back to the perforated tabs on the side and two stickers on the front that let the box lift open inside we have 17 bags two manuals and three stickers on a relatively small sticker sheet the manuals the manuals are not terribly thick in fact the second manual is noticeably thinner than the first they come in at 75 and 31pages interesting to note on the back we see the next and more interesting wave of sets later this summer nothing new to report on the manuals as they provide the lego standard of high quality and features we expect  piece callouts  models divided into sections  large images  page numbers since there were links posted to the pdf files of the instructions online i’m sure you can all get an idea of the manual and the parts inventory however for those of you without access to the internet here are photos of the parts inventory pages random manual image features page the pieces the short answer is you get lots and lots of little pieces in white gray and black plus some big pieces in white gray and black mixed in the set is a fair amount of oddball pieces like minifig tools jedi hood and trans yellow dome fear not despite the eclectic collection of parts it all comes together in the end not unlike a typical day at work for me… it is probably worth noting again that there is a heavy amount of technic parts and pieces here the build the build starts off with a rather indepth build of the stand in which general grievous stands on once you think you are done you keep adding on to this rather solid base i bet there are 250 pieces just in the base alone it is quite nice when you get done with it though and really adds to the display i’m glad lego didn’t skimp on the base as it completes the model once you get through all that the rest of the build is a real thumbbruiser anyone who has built a decent size technic set knows the feeling of your thumbs being sore when you are done you get the same effect here it is actually a fun build and i really liked seeing how the designers used all the various pieces to recreate a fairly accurate model of grievous the model is built from the ground up as seen in a few of the progress shots here is what is left over the design the design is quite good and is very accurate some might be disappointed that since this is a technic set we don’t have more articulation in the shoulders and have the ability to separate two arms into four as seen in the movie however it would seem the real intent is for display and not functionality here is a shot of the torso and the detail involved here are grievous’ organs careful observers will note that my model is lacking two “arrow” stickers from the two white chest pieces i failed to see these on the sticker sheet and only grabbed the large grievous sticker so note that there are actually three stickers and not one chest protector and respirator head and arms i was a little disappointed that we got two yellow blades and no green blades on the lightsabers note how all the lightsabers have different hilts which is a nice touch here are some shots of the completed model with a few other sets shown for scale he is actually pretty tall you have the option to remove the top two arms and put in shoulder plates if you so desire detail on the back overall thoughts i’ve been saying for a few years that we should have a technic grievous set and we finally got one designed more as a model and not a fully functional swooshable figure grievous is a tad flimsy you won’t want him to veer too far off his massive and sturdy base it would have been nice to have is cape with him like the technic vader set i do like the size of the model and it is impressive to look at lego star wars system fans will likely want to think twice before purchasing but technic and ucs fans should be satisfied final rating 75 build 810 very good – fun relatively quick build technic fans will be more pleased than others design 810 very good – some nice snot and technic techniques a bit flimsy but the base is kind of cool parts 710 a mixed bag of stuff probably can’t get too many diverse builds from this except for other robot type models price 710 just ok – a bit stiff at 90 usd for a nice display model with limited functionality as always let’s hear your thoughts and feedback	positive
hey dunamis think you can get a straighton shot of the face the red pieces inside the eye sockets are topped with transgreenishyellow studs which make his face look eerily alive and very close to his screen appearance its a nice little detail that seems to not show through on pictures ive seen of the set the legs are a little wobbly im scared that hell be leaning too far forward in about 5 years	neutral
thanks for that fine review dunamis i really like that set gg´s an interesting and well designed movie character and that lego version of him´s indeed well done and very detailed and although i would wish for a some more functional or playable  feature of move and even splitable arms i guess it´s an already very cool ucs version of that grumpy old kaleesh	positive

hi yall guess what happened today when walked into my toys r us in fullerton ca just to buy a simple tiny turbo racer what do i see all the agents sets sitting on the shelf ready for the taking i didnt have too much money with me so i just got 2 of 8631 mission 1 jetpack pursuit its a really cool little set so i thought id review this puppy for you i shall proceed in the order of the instructions so lets get started the minifigs lets begin with the minifigs saw fist and agent chase they are really cool some of the coolest minifigs i have seen in a while i took off saw fists wig  chainsaw so you can see his head and cybernetic arm better here is a back view of saw fist and  surprise agent chase has a double sided head one side with his cool mission face with sunglasses and headset and one with his casual bruce wayne type face note though that it is not really the bruce wayne face his wig btw is mutts hairpiece in black very neat poor saw fist seems to be forced to always drag his chainsaw around for it is way too long to just hang down from his shoulder like a normal arm the snowmobile next up we have the snowmobile a sleek little vehicle with only minor design flaws the container with the jewel is attached to the vehicle by a single stud so it doesnt fall off but is easy to pick up in the pic below you can see the only two tiny design flaws thanks to the exhaust pipes the laser cannon or whatever its supposed to be cant be lowered any further than this also the corners of that slopeish piece that the handle bar rests on are sticking out a little at the sides other than that its pretty well done the jetpack finally there is the jetpack imo a name like autogyropack or something would make more sense but whatever although a little bulky the jetpack is very well designed the rotor can be tilted back and at the lower back of the jetpack there is hook with which you can grab the container with the jewel from the snowmobile what i like best about the jetpack is that although it is attached to the minifig in kinda the same way as that of the riddler this one doesnt rotate around so the agent is being held in place steadily see ya later chainsawcyborgdude stickers this set comes with a surprisingly large sticker sheet the reason is that half of it are extra stickers there are two large agents logos and one inferno logo  perfect for agents mocs there are also a star and a small round sticker portraying the number of the mission the star seems to be part of some kind of game where you collect the stars from all sets on an agents id that you get from the mission 5 set i dont know though if you get any gain from this except for becoming a fullstatus lego agent below you can find the list of parts from this set click here for a better quality pic thats pretty much it i hope you liked this review and will run straight to your next toy store to get one or more of this set this was my very first set review so any questions comments or requests any more pics you want me to take would you like me to exchange the chainsaw with something else or do you want me to try the agents new hairpiece out on another fig if so just tell me see ya edited by oky wan kenobi 25 june 2009  0821 pm	positive
thanks for the review im looking forward to some of the new parts and ideas in this line the figures look great the actual sets themselves dont really appeal though	neutral
huhm  i like the idea of the agentid  but offcourse all they want with that is that you buy all six sets  but it can be a good idea for children they wouldnt think of hey they get all money only because i have a little card with stars or something well not to rant i think its good also can you make that name yourself maybe set 5 comes with a extra stickersheed with all letters that would be nice agent rupee a very nice review oky wan kenobi rupee	neutral
i kind of like the set as said it has a very cartoonish style to it so im guessing the kids are going to love it and as a parent ill love it if the construction isnt to fragile  ill probably be getting a few for myself but only as parts pack copmike on may 18 2008 1129 am said and the excaustpipe is a new peace also i think yeah and its all over this years releases from what ive seen so far its found in racers speed racers mars mission and exoforce sets i just wish that instead of a 2x1 plate with an exhaustpipe in each end they would have made it an 1x1 plate with a single exhaust that would have been a lot more useful	positive
what a lovely set thanks for that fine review oky wan kenobi the mfs´re wonderful that helipack looks solid and well done and i especially like the slightly asymmetrical design of the neat snowmobile a very playable little set for sure and the most interesting part´s for sure that new cool mf arm	positive
yay oky wan wow the agents line is looking good so far the jetpack is pretty nice and the minifigs my dad was in portland just yesterday and if id have called an hour sooner he might have been able to get to the tru	neutral
thanks for the review do i see a little indy hint on that map oh and btw the map looks like it actually is printed am i right	neutral
not many words this time but as they say a picture is worth a thousand words  and your pictures are lovely once again agents is turning out to be a cooler and cooler theme with each new review this set looks like an awesome parts pack and i love the bike btw anyone else notice the possibly accidental reference to alpha team agent charge is back it looks edited by grevious 21 may 2008  0905 pm	positive
wow great review for a really great looking set the pieces like the minifigs and crocs are very nice but that map is reeaally cool for an aztecmayainca fan like me i will definately buy this set when it is available in england grevious on may 21 2008 1004 pm said btw anyone else notice the possibly accidental reference to alpha team agent charge is back it looks yeah i thought that then i thought nah he looks different but i remember that the characters in alpha team did change their looks a lot throughout the years being spies and that edited by shoc 26 may 2008  1037 am	positive

thanks for an interesting review theriddler the set´s cheap and very useful to get two fantastic mfs a great mr freeze and a very cool new batman but i have to say that these two small vehicles just look plain ugly imho without any inspiration nor orginality sorry tlc but you can for sure do better than that and even with less pieces	neutral
quote but i have to say that these two small vehicles just look plain ugly imho without any inspiration nor orginality indead the only reason to get this set is if you couldnt afford the batcave back in 2006 and want a mr freeze fig for a cheap price and anyone who did get that kit really have no reason whatsoever to get this wait did i forget something oh yeah  thanks for the review riddler edited by grevious 22 may 2008  1154 pm	neutral
grevious on may 23 2008 0954 am said indead the only reason to get this set is if you couldnt afford the batcave back in 2006 and want a mr freeze fig for a cheap price and anyone who did get that kit really have no reason whatsoever to get this ill get it i admit the vehicles are extremely poorly designed i mean really poorly designed but the mrfreeze fig is fantastic and i would buy two of this set just for him as his head and gear are very useful for mocing it also comes with some nice pieces like the grappling hook little wheels exhaust pieces and such still a pretty bad set build wise but it has atleast inspired me to make my own batbuggy thanks for the review theriddler appreciated batbrick away	positive
wowie im glad you like it maby il do the tumbler also but soon the batcycle and the scuba also come	neutral
pretty nice review for a first time theriddler next time though if your camera has it use the macro function little flower icon and perhaps a tripod that should get rid of any blur and provide you with better pictures apart from that a good little review keep up the good work	neutral
neat little set i do like the parts a number of hard to find bits all in one pack depending on how much it costs in usd ill have to consider it and while the buggy designs kinda suck im a little happy to see them its been years since tlc made any small go kart style vehicles i guess tiny turbos have been overshadowing that market	positive
thank you the riddler  for this highly informative review despite the fact that i still consider it to be one of the weakest sets in all batman line i guess that now i may even get more than one of these for the same reasons as batbrick  good day gentlemen 	neutral
thanks for the review this set was poorly design when i first heard of it i think it was like a car with a much better design than this one i think i will get it for the minifigs	negative
the pics as promised extra part	neutral
thanks for the review i dont know if i would get this set though the cars are not that great and the price is a little too high	negative
i got this yesterday and built it this morning apart from the figs it is very crappy mr freezes buggy is ok but the bat buggy is easily the worst vehicle ive seen for years colours are all over the place the grappling hook feels cheaply made the inclusion of those odd pearl silver parts which have been in the exoforce sets seem especially random here the terrible bionicle flame piece its the first lego vehicle ive built where ive immediately had the urge to disassemble it and pretend i never bought it really i only got it for mr freeze so i shouldnt complain but still its a real step backwards the comparable catwoman dragster set was heaps better the penguin sub is sweet though thanks for the review anyway	negative
coming in at around 50 us turbo car chase is one of the bigger of the new agents sets a big box with a helicopter car and gate in it seems like a winner but how good is it really and is it worth the cash lets start with the minifigs this set comes with a standard inferno henchman spy clops and agent chase the henchman is you basic lego criminal type with a gun and a jumpsuit nothing real groundbreaking here spy clops on the other hand is very cool for technically half of a minifig his head has a neat electronic goggle print and the rest of him is a torso mounted onto a set of six legs made from exoforce robot arms the whole thing is really well done and neat as hell agent chase turbo car chase  seems to have a standard agent body and a doubleprinted face with one side a sunglasses and headset print the other face is a determined agent look the set also includes a laptop with doctor inferno wallpaper the laptop is a new piece and works like the lego books that are in a lot of harry potter sets molding on the keyboard is really well done and the thing can be held by a minifig along either corner but not in the middle and not while closed the gate in the set is nothing revolutionary by itself and i sort of get the feeling that it was included to drive up the piece count and the set price point that being said there are some things to like here for instance the gate has four wheels of barbed wire attached to it the barbed wire is new and makes me want to start building some world war i trench mocs the rest of the gate is fairly big and it has a handy ramp attached so that vehicles can roll through it easily the main feature of the gate is a sound brick its much better then lego sound and light units of the past when the gate is opened it depresses a button and an alert klaxon blares that sounds every bit like a prisonbeak in progress the triggering action works surprisingly well and its pretty much for this feature alone that im not going to immediately break the gate back down and add it to my parts bin the designers did make an effort to create more then just a fence though a nice control panel connected to a big spotlight crowns the piece and a pair of cameras watch the opening its really hard to mess up a lego helicopter and this set is no exception the inferno chopper is a nicely proportioned and well built machine it looks properly menacing and has the uniform orange and black of other inferno property its armed with a set of four technic pegs cleverly used as guns on outriding mounts as well as a pair of the newerstyle flickfire missiles i personally dont care for flickfiring missiles but these look decent enough and seem to stay put so i really cant complain about them along the fuselage are a pair of intake pieces that ive never seen before and im guessing are new theyre pretty well designed and will come in handy for mocing down the road the action feature of the aircraft is the wench system this is very different then other lego wenches in that you build the entire mechanism and housing you can then use it to raise spy clops up and down from the bottom of the chopper using the rotor now this also keeps you from sitting there and just giving the rotor repeated spins to simulate flight im not too thrilled with that but there are a hundred other lego helicopters out there with fully rotating rotors so i guess i can let it by just this once as youd suspect the bottom of the cockpit is completely open which makes this a vehicle pretty much solely for spy clops sorry henchman but there is plenty of room beneath the body to attach a plate with some seats on it to accommodate another pilot without drastically altering the design or even removing existing pieces the turbo car is a slick little honey of a lego car and the silver pieces that make up the body work contribute a lot to that fact the front license plate appears to be an exofore code brick but it also hides the activation lever for the passenger ejector seat the seat works about as well as the spruce goose which is to say not well at all but here its the thought that counts the interior of the car is really well done theres even a radar screen for keeping track of pesky helicopters but the bondlike features dont end there a lever in the compartment raises pair of guns in the hood and a knob on the rear deploys a quad rocket system with more flickfire missiles this is a car that wont be stopped easily the rear has two cones sticking out id like to think theyre smoke nozzles or oilslick sprayers allinall this is a really good set the car is pure lego vehicle love and looks fantastic the silver pieces are very nice and its a shame lego doesnt use metallic colors in system sets more often there are however a lot of sticker for this set and i know how much that bugs a lot of people i personally like how much detail the stickers add to these sets and dont mind them so much the set also comes with an agents id card for chase which you can put little star stickers on from other sets as you get them its printed on a real nice piece of sturdy plastiboard and would be cooler if you could put your own picture and name on it instead of pretending to be chase sold by themselves the car and chopper would be musthaves all tossed together with the gate sort of makes the set a little less then the sum of its parts and with 498 parts most of them small thats not so hot its only slightly overpriced in my opinion but if you do shell out the money you wont regret it im very comfortable recommending this set to anyone close to perfect but the price and some minor flaws bring it back just a little id say 433 but out of 5 is close enough	positive
looks cool one of the best in this line cant wait for review	positive
chrome cant wait for the review deino	positive
deinonychus on may 23 2008 1012 pm said pics and thoughts tomorrow i picked up this set earlier in the week and was quite pleased with it in fact i have missions 15 and am happy with all of them  this series is much better than the old alpha team ever was i look forward to reading your thoughts on it i will say 2 things about it now though 1my set came with defective instructions in 2 places pages are missing and duplicates of other pages repeated for instance the car instructions are missing steps 1621 fortunately i was able to make out what pieces went where in the missing steps by studying the illustration in step 22 i hope you have better luck with your instructions 2this set contains the best lego sound brick ever its just begging to be incorporated into my arkham asylum	positive
wow thanks for the great review deino this set is really a must have for me the sound brick seems great the helicopter looks very nice and the car is superb all of the james bond features are really cool though im very interested in how the ejector seat works or doesnt work the car itself is very sleek and full of beautiful silver and the inclusion of the new rims and windshield mean that i wont have to buy many speed racer sets as for the minifigs they all look great especially spyclops though it looks rather easy for him to fall off of his spider legs can you confirm this a great review of a great set thanks deinonychus	positive
deinonychus on may 23 2008 0912 pm said the rear has two cones sticking out id like to think theyre smoke nozzles or oilslick sprayers according to page 14 of my brickmaster magazine the left cone is for smoke screen and the right cone is for oil slick	neutral
wow great review thanks this set looks absolutely great but im afraid of the price oh weel ill just get the 2 smaller ones im really liking this theme well done tlg	positive
thanks deinonychus for another great review i must say i do look forward to people uploading reviews of new sets it really helps me decide if i want it or not if its a good set imo then it adds to the excitement of picking up one myself this i must say is one of those sets the only concern for me like alot of others is the price i will just have to wait and see and continue to look at these photos deinonychus has provided for us so much for thinking the agent line was going to be weak i wonder if the exoforce style code brick number plate is a hint from tlc as to what will replace exoforce at the end of this year jb	positive
thanks for the great review im really liking these agents sets the more i see them the car seems to have alot of features its to bad the the ejection seat doesnt work as well as one would hope oh well makes me want the big rig even more now	positive
great review deinonychus i really like it can someone record the sound os the sound brickmaybe on youtube i really want to hear it this sets are really cool deino can you post a picture of the agent card it comes with	positive
great review and fantastic pics deinonychus and a big thank you to whoever pointed out that you could use the sound brick for arkham asylum my addled brain didnt make the connection the car is just beautiful and with a good use for the most expensive part of the gate this is on my wish list for sure just have to see how much cash is left over after buying the new death star in a month or two agents has to be the biggest surprise from lego for ages without any pics it sounded soso but theyve done a brilliant job with it love those metallic coloured pieces	positive

whitefang although i realize that the battle packs are great specifically for building armies and castle accessories which is why its such a shame that i wont be able to buy these things  while sdpirates sets are more for a catapult calvary whatever the fact to the matter is with the battle pack you get 5 minifigs with lots of accessories while with the sets that sdpirate showed us you get 5 minifigs with an okay amount of accessories 3 horses including two skeleton ones a ballista a weapons rack and a jousting barricade you cannot say that the battle pack contains the same amount of stuff that the other two sets have and therefore should be priced the same it just seems that lego is ripping off canadian army builders to me if the battle pack contained a small catapult or wall so that it contained about the same amount of stuff that the other sets had it would be fair it seems stupid that you will only get minifigs from one set while you can get about the same amount of minifigs plus a bunch of other stuff from two other equally priced sets that’s why to me these battle packs are a rip off because of what they contain imho the battle packs seem to be only worth about 10 dollars	neutral
sorry to be going a little off topic here but personally i have just bought 40 crowny battle packs for the only reason that i am running out of space to store the left over blocks about 500 of my crownies came from sets mentioned above on sale which would have been cheaper than the battle packs thanks for the review whitefang but i dont think i will be buy any skeleton battle packs that army is large enough	neutral
for those of you who buy so many of this and the other battle pack with crownies what do you do with all of them is this simply to create a largescale army or do you plan to build large castle scenes with all the figs id love to see some pictures on the share your castle army thread	neutral

ive always wanted to see this set closeup voltio thanks for sharing the image review this is the only jungle adventurers set i dont have and its got some great unique pieces esp those leaf brick pieces whats great is theyre not stickers this is a really a nice review of a neat set with the extra little humor you shared thanks again for taking the time to photograph and share over eb	positive
thanks for this great review voltio i never knew of this set till now and it really looks great i never paid much attention to those aztecincan style sets which i now regret i love the bright colours used here and all the great traps theres so many of them which is exactly what we can expect from an old incan temple like this one im surprised theres no catapult anyway the minifigs included are also great and am i right in guessing those bricks are printed that would be fantastic as they look amazing that boat hull is new to me too although i guess the fact that its mainly in belville sets explains that pretty well thanks again for the sweet review do you have any other jungle adventurers sets you plan to review peace	positive
a real classic thanks for that nice and funny review voltio a well designed set very playable with a lot of nifty traps a very good use of that raised baseplate and really nice crafts the mf characters´re excellent too and although the color scheme´s great and original especially with all these neat printed pieces it´s perhaps the only part of that set that looks a little out of date today nevertheless the set´s plain charming and shows clearly that tlc don´t need licenses to do some distinct adventurer sets	positive
great review i just barly missed the jungle series growing up with half a year of jungle and mainly orient expedition and dino island i like egypt more but this set despite the 4x4 palm tree is practically perfect i love the detail and vibrant colours gotta say ive got a thing for pippin reed myself by the way what does vhtf mean edited by sdpirate 28 may 2008  0106 am	positive

oky wan kenobi on may 30 2008 0919 pm said but i have some questions about the grey new parts in the life raft are they 1x1 like their counterparts with the clips or 1x2 and can they be held by a minifig by the handle  btw which jedi has an orange eta 2 i guess it should work with mfs hmm i think it´s count citrus	neutral
im rather fond of helicopters and have built many different types this doesnt really remind me of any particular model other than perhaps an eh 101 merlin and even that resemblance is very superficial just for the record this is a sikorsky sea king and this is a sikorsky mh53 a derivation of the ch53 the only resemblance i see with the former is the colour scheme and with the latter the fact that its got a fat rearend sponsons and six blades it doesnt matter though because i really like it the colour scheme is great the shape is nice its got quite a bit of detail and i just have to get my hands on the cockpit window and those new rotor blades when i first saw the large aircraft pieces a few years ago i figured they were very much singleuse parts but the tail end doesnt look too bad pretty clever i like the raft too it really does look like the real deal that the helicopter cant lift it really isnt an issue because in real life they wouldnt lift the raft either theyd use the rescue hoist to lift the occupants of the raft into the helicopter one by one or perhaps in pairs imagine a storm with a helicopter hovering over tall waves with a big fat raft strung from a cable underneath it the raft would catch a lot of wind and flop around quite a bit causing it to loose all its occupants and also yanking the helicopter around possibly causing the pilot to loose control and crash bad idea cheers ralph edited by ralphs 30 may 2008  1109 pm	negative

great find and thanks for the review inertia on may 28 2008 1108 pm said undoubtably better than its newer counterpart the mt101 armored drilling unit care to explain why personally i think that aside from the colour scheme the new one is far better why suspension more enclosed cockpits buglike appearence i suppose its a matter of personal opinion though	neutral
joebot on may 28 2008 0731 pm said kinda sad to think that with tlcs recent ban on magnets in their products since when is that the new train couplings have magnets only with a special casing anyways mtron is one of the greatest space factions with mega core magnetiser as my favourite set of these guys even though i do not own it  the only thing that bothers me is the lack of reachable controls for the minifigs to drive their vehicles but iirc it is the same with a lot of other spacesets as well	positive
sinner on may 29 2008 0520 pm said no but we especially imperialshadows are working on new indexes supposedly the space one was my job okay just dont forget this when it goes up i like self promotion i have about 10 old space sets coming in from ebay and gonna review them soon as well so that should be some good additions to the index when it goes up thanks	neutral

harley  mistah j i want to preface my review by admitting that i’m an unrepentant harley quinn fanboy i’ve been enamored with the character since she first appeared in batman the animated series back in the 90’s and i’ve since followed her misadventures through her introduction into the regular batman series during no man’s land into her own series and even on the shortlived and notsogood birds of prey tv show so please excuse any proharley bias so down to business the 267 piece set retails for 30 us 35 at toys r us and builds up very fast and easy it consists of batman’s bat cycle harley’s hammer truck and brand new batman and harley quinn minifigs there is also no lack of weapons in addition to the usual bag of bataccessories and guns the set also comes with a pair of gray revolvers batman in this set has the new “armor” torso print and the hips are the same color as the legs hinting that this is supposed to represent the movie style batsuits more so then the traditional comic book “underwear over tights” look harley quinn is a very cool looking minifig and i haven’t grinned so much at a new batman character figure since my first batman minifig a couple years ago the figure is very true to the character and the torso has been accented with a few shape lines to try and distinguish her as a female despite the boxy body harley’s jester cap is an interesting new piece it seems to me at least to be made of a slightly different grade of plastic then we’re used to it’s molded in red and painted with black and white and it comes packed in its own separate little baggie i expect that this piece may have cost lego a little more then usual to produce harley also has a buildable accessory a giant mallet sure she can’t stand up all that well unless it’s held in specific ways but it’s neat and most importantly it’s funny it’s especially fun for smacking the everloving crap out of other minifigs with the bat cycle is in bag number one and is a very fast build this isn’t some little japanese sport bike like nightwing’s cycle this monster is almost a car and seems to pack just the right amount of intimidation for the caped crusader to exploit thanks to the thick tires two in front one in back it stands up just fine on its own and rolls very well the huge exhaust pipes are a nice touch and give the thing a look of engine power the only real flaw is the inclusion of the flickfire missiles mounted on the sides but as with any lego model they can be easily left out without hurting the look of the vehicle the hammer truck is the bulk of this set and a lot more fun then it looks of the monster truck persuasion the vehicle is designed and built with a surprising level of solidity the axle mounts are particularly impressive the big wheels and tires just beg you to drive this thing right over the bat cycle or batman the megamallet gimmick is also a surprise not so much for its technical complexity there isn’t any really but for the fact that once you start turning the knob at the rear to swing the mallet back and forth it’s really a lot of fun there are some low points to the truck design again the flickfire missiles are tacked on and there’s a cargo cratebed set into the back for harley’s loot of jewels the crate would have looked a lot better molded in black in brown it breaks up the look of the truck a little speaking of which the look of the truck is very pleasing the red and black harley quinn color scheme works really well on the vehicle there are a few stickers here and unfortunately the diamond patterned ones are applied over multiple bricks the rest however are great not only does she have an “i love joker” bumper sticker but she has a joker playing card taped to her dash i guess serving as a picture of her beloved puddin’ there is also a sticker for activation of the hammer which boldly shouts hit me this is a fun set a neat new batman vehicle and a big truck with lots of playability the harley minifig is a musthave for any batfan and if you only get one of the batman sets this year i’d recommend this one the price versus piececount on this set is a little bit of a deterrent though this might not be the best set for collectors on a budget or people looking for something completely new and innovative but anyone buying this for a child can rest assured that the kid will get your money’s worth out of the set through its play value when added together and averaged out the pros and cons of this set combine to give it a score of out of 5 even if harley herself is a clean 6 out of 5	positive

quote looking forward to the review this looks to be the best of the new batsets gasp are you kidding me honestly i hate this set the batbike looks far too blocky and that hammer truck looks super shoddy and thrown together the only real reason id get it at all would be for the harely quinn figure  but id probably just get her separately on bricklink besides the tumbler and robins jetski sets look far better to me they actually seem to have great vehicle designs no new villian figures i know but still some great old ones er wait a minute oh yeah hope your review gives the real scoop on this kit deino	negative

a very nice review thanks deinonychus that batcycle looks pretty neat like a hells bats angels version of that tumbler a really nifty idea the truck looks simply sweet a smooth design and this time tlc´s new habit of vehicle oversizing just works very fine a wonderful and very comical vehicle indeed and harley oh my this bill i´ll have to pay for myself clonecommando007 on may 30 2008 0222 pm said truck flick fire missiles lego have you no sanity sure theyre great but youre putting them on every single action set yeah this starts to become a little annoying these things simply don´t work in a that much satisfying way when i was a child all i needed to play with my mfs were some old fashioned classic space blasters zoom zoom zzzaaap honestly do they really think that this tiny rockets deliver that much fun just imagine on	positive
so down to business the 267 piece set retails for 30 us what but its £30 in the uk why lego why	negative
the 08 batman sets look like a step up from the somewhat lackluster 07 sets this looks like a very fun set with a whimsical sense of style very fitting with harley quinns character the price isnt great but i guess you gotta pay for that batman logo on the downside  i am so over the good buy vehicle vs bad guy vehicle concept i really wish tlc would get over this you see it throughout the product line  batman castle mission to mars etc	neutral

brickadier general on may 29 2008 0727 pm said hi all so i was at the walmart yesterday and had the munchies and was looking for something to eat somewhere along the line i stopped caring about food and decided to browse the toy department to see what they had legowise thank you very much for that neat review brickadier general  i´m glad that you changed your mind a review of a burger wouldn´t be half that interesting for sure it´s just a mediocre set to me but of course it´s always cool to get important mfs in less pricy sets i like the penguin´s sub from the batcave more just because they did a fine job on resembling a penguin without using a sticker robins craft looks fairly nice but the most useful parts of the whole set for me personally would be those indeed very neat green engines	positive
clonecommando007 on may 29 2008 0653 pm said great review though you really seem to like this set and it probably is a great one im not a fan of the penguin sub or at least im not from what i see its not for everybody personally i just bought the set for the figures and i was originally just going to sort the parts and put them away in storage asuka on may 29 2008 0713 pm said thank you very much for that neat review brickadier general  i´m glad that you changed your mind a review of a burger wouldn´t be half that interesting for sure it´s just a mediocre set to me but of course it´s always cool to get important mfs in less pricy sets i like the penguin´s sub from the batcave more just because they did a fine job on resembling a penguin without using a sticker robins craft looks fairly nice but the most useful parts of the whole set for me personally would be those indeed very neat green engines yes it probably would have been nicer if they would have at least done a brick built beak for the front of the sub unfortunately i never got my hands on the batcave set so i never was able to build the original sub	negative
looks like a cool set but the hairpiece for robin is vary disapointing i would be so glad is they used the regular hair you see all the time i hope lego will not make a habit of using that hairpiece on other figures	negative
set 8635  agents  mobile command center pieces 1154 price us8999 those dedicated agents theyve fought chainsawarmed villains battled radiocontrolled cyborg crocs chased pallets of badlystored golden loot and wrestled killer sharks with vicious toothy grins finally theyve caught the notorious dr inferno and imprisoned him in their cavernous mobile command center but dr inferno wont go down without a fight can the agents stop the evil dr disco inferno fleeing will spy clops laser gun burn through the door in time or will dr inferno simply use the lovely agent traces enormous ponytail as an escape ladder to freedom more importantly will there be a riot in the streets of lego city as afols go apopletic at the thought of a 12 wide truck roaring through their ordered town layouts stay tuned part 1 the box instructions parts as the largest of the agents sets so far the box is easily the biggest trainee agents examine the following three pics and see if you notice anything odd box front box back box middle spot it thats right the printed cardboard which has supposed to be the bottom half of the fold out middle section is on the back slicing the ultralarge set image which would form the foldout in half  the way the cardboard is printed as one piece before its folded i think this would be very hard to do accidentally so suspect a major stuffup somewhere along the production line i bought this set off bricklink so would be very interested if anyone in the states who has seen these boxes actually on the shelves can tell me if this is common or rare basically i want to know if i should be annoyed that the bricklink seller didnt list this in the set description or are they all like this the instructions come in 4 booklets the parts list comes in at 5 pages which is a lot even at halfsize pages  large images of the parts inventory are in this folderwhen moderated for anyone interested heres also some cute agentstype artwork at the end of one of the books instructions show piece callouts and are divided into sections according to numbered bags as youd expect for a set with 1100 parts this baby comes with a lot of bags its a treasure trove of dark blue as well as the obvious large slopes and wall panels which make up the body and the roof there is a wealth of smaller navy blue pieces as well  small 1x1 bricks 2x2 bricks 1x1 plates 2x2 tiles heaps of 2x plates some slopes 22x cheese pieces basically anyone wanting a lot of dark blue should think about this set the roof panels alone for example could provide a dark blue sea for a modernised pirate moc 2 dsss dreaded sticker sheets quelle surprise  stickers the grey parts of the stickers here are metallic silver ink which is a nice touch actually as sticker sheets go theyre not too bad fairly subtle for the most part and the navy blue actually matches the bricks themselves however after looking at the sticker sheets i thought i was missing something what about the pieces used for the projection screens showing dr inferno and the sharks  why werent they on the sticker sheets there must be another one frantically i checked and rechecked the box and flipped through all the instruction manuals to find the elusive 3rd sheet where was it ten minutes later i noticed something which had honestly never occured to me  there were actual printed pieces in this set so obvious and yet so unthinkable its horrifying how years and years of exoforce and speed racer set releases can mentally condition peoples thought processes tut tut lego what have you reduced us to here they are folks  actual printed pieces yes i do believe this news deserves the caps i also noticed this nifty modification of the usual 2x3 cupboard  you can now fit drawers in it very clever this may have been around in belville sets for years for all i know but its new to me the drawers slide in and out very well and the top one sits on slight indentations in the middle of the cupboard part 2 the figs our trusty agents  charge chase trace and fuse high powered agents dont have time for names of more than one syllable  thats why the bad guys always lose  chase and fuse have the mutt hair in black and dark orange the lovely agent trace has an exquisite new hairpiece in dark brown perfect for rapunzel themed mocs as you can see her ponytail is loooong makes it hard to sit down the poor girl i feel sorry for all these female figs with such intricate hairstyles that they can never relax in an ordinary lego chair however at least she has two breasts unlike the recent harley quinn fig compensation indeed seriously though its great that theres a separate torso print for the female character and this attention to detail is typical of the set as a whole three of the agents have reversable heads  nice touch with the headsets and i like the id cards on their pants obviously the agents security system is based on some kind of crotch measuring device this would make sense considering the conspicuous bulges in the pants of dr infernos men see the other agents set reviews the villains  spy clops dr inferno gold tooth dr infernos hair in all its glory this is a great piece although the orange colouring is a little rough on the front its so 3d it deserves a back and side view and indeed eb thread all of its own as mentioned elsewhere this is different plastic to the normal minifig hair but it doesnt quite feel as soft as the exoforce hair it doesnt fall off as much anyway the figs get 1010 from me awesome hairpieces in great colours for the agents and a sleek navy blue neon green uniform the villains faces are great and they are all very distinctive the attention to detail is outstanding and its great to see a lego inhouse theme with characters as memorable and cool as figs from the licensed themes  part 3 the build the build is divided into three stages  the small vehicles the front of the truck and the massive command center section a small vehicles first up all the small vehicles we have a small flyer 2 buggies jet ski and a speed boat  all in glorious navy blue with little bits of silver detailing top view these vehicles are all simple small and welldesigned probably the weakest is the flyer only because the cockpit looks a little large in fact the small flyer is probably the weakest element of 8365 overall which tells you how good the set itself is in various threads here this set has been heavily criticised for being way out of proportion theres a reason for that as we shall come to however the existence of these small sets should appease some people with the new coast guard sets for example all of these save the flyer wouldnt look out of place on a city beach with a little modding heres an example  agents beach party spongebob couldnt help but crash the villains only have one small vehicle but theyve been wellserved in the smaller sets and this one is a unique and clever design i love the triangular shape and the simple but clever technique of making the arch slopes meet up around the propellers its sort of insectile in black and orange and looks very different from the usual assortment of helicopters etc b truck front this thing is a beast seriously look at it its chunky and mean looking you dont want to mess with this baby the build is really nice like a lot of star wars vehicles its all based on technic beams pinned together unlike a lot of mars mission sets underneath isnt all technic beams with some plates slapped on like a facade the majority is a lot of plates and bricks which all fit together solidly you can see from the detailing of cheese grater slopes and silver pieces on the front how effort has been made to give this vehicle a distinct feel different to other lego sets sure the silver slope mirrors might be a bit too much for some but this baby is all about attitude you can imagine it roaring down the road en route to dr infernos diabolical lair after all these sets are agents sets  nobody said they were secret agents c  command center  whole assembly heres a view of the whole thing assembled  inside and cool details to follow at the end its kind of hard to show here as it is extreeeeemely long this is indeed a big set the build for the trailer part of the command center is fun and very satisfying yes there are large pieces but there is also a huge amount of detail it is also solid as a rock i remember being annoyed building the big ferrari truck a few years ago  everytime you looked at it an 8 x 16 plate fell off the mobile command center is solid  even with the hinged roof and special features it is not delicate at all kudos to the designers again as it is mainly a brick build rather than a technic one i also like how the command center part connects to the cabin  its not a special piece at all just a technic axle going through two circle plates but it works and its solid please note ive been selective about which stickers ive applied during the build top view the rear heres an example of why i like the build a the designers have enough sense to put a ladder so a minifig can climb up to the interior when the command center is open b notice that although the ladder clips at the top there is an extra clip there in the middle purely to hold it in place so it doesnt flap around and holds firm i dont know if most designers would even think to put a ladder there let alone go the extra mile and put a mechanism to hold it in place pure class oh and notice the greebly detail stuff to the right there too the other side this is probably the other weak part of the build  the bricky gaps at the top where the hinge to open the roof sits its a little gappy but the set is so big you dont really notice d and now for the fun stuff  inside and neat details ok so weve built the thing its big its blue the top of the trailer itself would make a good warehouse moc for a harbour layout but what about inside is it any good what about all those small vehicles from the start of the review where do they go well im glad you asked because the solution is superb the small flyer folds slightly and slides into place here lift off the roof and youre away the large buggy and the speedboat go under here the jetski slides out of the rear here attached to its own little platform and the small buggy goes inside the main cabin theres even a crane so you can lift it down so now we know why this set is so large to fit everything in its amazing that this functionality doesnt affect the aesthetics of the set as a whole but we still havent finished on the details the front section has a very easytoswingopen roof section and missiles theres also a command section underneath the bit where the flyer lifts out and now for the interior i have to say i really like this space not only is it packed with great stuff theres also enough room for minifigs to move around i hate bases where the figs only have about 2 studs to actually stand and walk aquabase invasion is a nice set for example but the actual functional space inside the base is teensy claustrophobia you know within a week theyd be fighting to toss each other out of the airlock no such problems for these suave agents who have plenty of legroom and the ability to launch missiles from their ceiling the whole of the interior zooming in moving from left to right first off the medicine cabinet looks like someones been leaving secret mission dossiers lying around the projector area for mission briefings dr inferno recently changed his hair colour from purple to orange it seems why are all these minifigs so obsessed with their hair the projector folds down when the trailer is open push the button and the light glows on now dr infernos hair is orange again this is one of my favourite parts of the set it works a charm the batteries for these lightbricks can also be replaced  instructions are in the manual agent charge considers sharkfin soup for dinner did i mention these projection panels are printed the detail is very fine too the tool section laptops sit in the middle compartment you get some flippers yellow scuba tank and various implements im so impressed that the helmet is pearl silver with a different coloured visor too  theres so much variation in the parts in this set you dont get the sense the designers are using the same thing over and over to save money it all feels luxe and topoftheline just like the command center itself two laptops  yay the aforementioned rooftop missiles the dr inferno cage nasty electric shocks bzzt you can see my reviewing skills are burning out now  sentences truncated another example of detail  nowhere else in the set is a 1x1 transgreen tile used  they could have used a 1x1 trans green cheese wedge piece as there are others in the set but they didnt how does dr i get out flick that lever on the right hand exterior and the door pops open spy clops the loyal minion awaits his master on the other side and there we have it take a bow guys theres a lot of spare parts a suspicious amount of dark blue small slopes but i checked the instructions and didnt see anything missing i have to say i do like the new policy since speed racer i think of including these small slopes as extras part 4 overall rating if youve made it this far youve got more stamina than dr infernos army of cyborg animals themselves as i said earlier this set has drawn criticism for the size of the truck however large vehicles do exist  i grew up in a wheat farming area and as a kid the size of the lorries that thundered past carrying grain was probably intimidating to me as this monstrous espionage machine is to the good citizens of lego city on top of that it does contain a plethora of 4wide vehicles inside  criticism of this set on the basis of size to me also seems misguided as this is basically a playset  and it is a very good one to boot as you can probably tell i love it to pieces and wouldnt hesitate to recommend it to anyone whether for parts or for play value check out the parts list in this folderwhen moderated and you can see just how many excellent pieces it contains a lightup brick a flood of navy blue metallic silver bricks  were spoiled 8635 is also an enjoyable build with fantastic figs and topoftheline detailing in a year when ive found city a bit disappointing after the run of great sets in 20062007 the agents line has been one of the surprise hits for me and i cant wait to see what the designers come up with next edited by sveltecorps 02 june 2008  1246 am	positive

wow this set looks so amazing amazing genius davinci art i say youve done an excellent job reviewing and really this is the review ive been waiting for so cool so classy i love the mission briefing feature to think that lego could go so high as to put something ingenious like that in there too bad lego figures dont have fingers to make shadow shows eh genius the jet lauching feature is pretty slick and they even put a control center in there too thats beast loving that the bottomi dont see how that big buggy can get out or in there but awesome too the back of the truck could use more detailing i think but the jail popopen feature is pretty cool as is the speed boat storage rack cabin its great that roof opening feature is a great part of this set also i think you can have multiple figures up theremaybe you can mod it to put a bed in there it certainly looks big enough inferno plane wow that think is smooth baby i love how the wings contain rotors inside of them thats awesome detail right there that is a sweet ship thingy so slick the rest of the command center is pretty awesome too we get a 4x4 wheeler and a crane and lots of room wow just wow great review great set you are well worthy of your custom title im gonna go buy this for only 90 woot	positive

wonderful review  one of the best ive ever seen on this site man we thought this might be the weakest set in the line but it turns out it may be the strongest everything about this set  from the color scheme to all the details to the minifigures to the piece selection  is just wonderful i think this set has finally confirmed it agents is everything alpha team wasnt and is how they should have done a spy theme from the start kudos to tlc for finally getting it right  and i sure hope theres a second year	positive
wow excellent review thanks that set sure looks fantastic its incredible how much features theyve managed to pack in while keeping it roomy im really impressed by the quality of the design tlc is sure getting back on track with great design ow 2008 is going to be expensive	positive
7645  mt61 crystal reaper piece count 600 price aud7995 4995 euros in most countries 3999 gbp usd 4999 its happened in the wider world and it had to happen to lego  yes the 80s are back space invaders holograms compulsory seatbelt wearing legislation and the return of classic space ok we dont have a fully fledged classic space theme back yet but if 7645 is the way of the future i think lego is ready to do it properly i wasnt a huge fan of last years mars mission sets and only picked up a few on clearance but this set is light years excuse the pun ahead of 2007s offerings this mining vehicle is solid compact and welldesigned it looks impressive and even better it has fantastic power functions operability behold 7645  mt61 crystal reaper ps i wasnt joking about the holograms or seat belts part 1 box instructions dsss dreaded sticker sheets parts front of box back of box 2 x instruction booklets dss numero uno  for the reaper dss number two  apologies for the blurry pic but i wanted to capture the sweet shimmy of the metallic holographic background on this sheet the way it catches the light really makes a difference to the small alien craft and makes it look much more interesting from the plain stickers of last year theres heaps of spare silvery stuff once the stickers are applied for those who use the leftover sticker material for customising parts bags  4 numbered with one extra with larger pieces parts everywhere  woo i know the lego instruction books scold me if i mix bags but im a devilmaycare kind of guy in your face tlc i love mixing all the parts together before i build it reminds me of my youth when the days were long anything was possible and i didnt need strict instructions not to build on grass or poke my eye out with a technic shooter interesting parts  these may or may not be new my technic knowledge is not that detailed the little scoop parts are so cute and have a heap of potential uses i love em theyre like smurf hats at miniland scale these technic wheel things in orange are also cute they kind of remind me of marigolds giant fabuland marigolds the track pieces  you get 70 of these  heres the section of track for one side  as you can see its about 52 studs long these hold together better than the small ones on the hailfire droid jungle cutter part 2 minifigs small mining transport alien ship i have to confess  i forgot to take an individual snap of the astronauts  its the usual bunch though  scaredy face guy sunglasses in space man and a third one i cant remember you dont really care though youre only interested in the alien commander and his matching arms legs combo deal as brickbitz noted in his review of the smaller set the glowy eye is just a 1x1 cylinder the set also comes with 2 normal jellies  one pictured here for size youll see what happened to the other one soon enough the alien craft is nothing exciting apart from the gorgeous glinting stickers heres the road safety angle the commander actually clips onto a 1x2 plate with handle so he cant fall out then the lime tentacle thing descends on top of him to keep him firmly there like a baby seat not very brave for an alien commander is he i mean did darth vader ever use a seatbelt tssk with cradle up this part of the build also includes the small astronaut mining buggy  small and effective please note in this build ive applied stickers to everything bar cockpit pieces this comes with radio and saw piece part 3 the reaper the first part of the build is the detachable shuttle i really like the retro aesthetic of this with the angled wings and the side hoverpod things it is much better than the comparable vehicle from 7699 the new flickfire piece is a waste of space  its fairly limp i prefer the simple flickfire technic pin to be honest theres also a very nice little side workshop as you can see i really like how the control unit is plugged into the wall via 5 1x1 round plates third pic its a bit dark great detail the technic pins on the back are there to connect the power functions battery box its odd theyre included at this stage of the instructions  maybe the intention was to release it originally with all the necessary motors etc but the price point was too high and they scaled it back the base the shuttle sits on that bley technic axle in the middle when the reaper is fully assembled the little vehicle scoots down the ramp at the rear which folds up to hold it in place when the reaper is in motion you can see theres a crystal container here as well  another nice small detail which i found the 2007 sets lacked theres also an alien here  thankfully not in those horrendous transorange tubes so prevalent last year the complete assembly isnt it snug its just the right size too  not massive but large enough to be a serious mining vehicle the ominous black treads contrast nicely with the white orange colour scheme of the vehicle itself the trans detailing  blue for weapons neon green for energy  is carried nicely through the whole set the blades and the scoops whirl nicely as the machine trundles along top down view tread detail whirling blades of death the buggy descends probably the most disturbing aspect of the whole set is this pic the jelly has an orange pump plugged into its heart which is connected to an energy supply on the left hand side this vehicle runs on alien jelly juice either that or its milking the jelly in some equally disturbing fashion how amoral is that i know theres been debate about this  the jellys arent innocent theyre evil energy crystal thieving maniacs etc  but i find it a bit odd that the humans respond by chaining the jelly up to the bowels of their mining vehcile and suck energy from its heart people debate about violence in lego as represented by realistic minifig weapons but i think the moral lesson here is even worse  its ok to exploit foreign life forms for our own gain if they treat us badly first whofans i think the ood should have a word with the jelly commander  that aside this set is welldesigned and fairly good value at aud7995 its definitely a notch above last years mars mission sets overall with improved detailing and more useful functions the holostickers are fab and its nice to have an alien commander even if he is a bit bulky and his fingers are identical to his toes however if all these reasons by themselves werent reason to recomend this set the following is part 4 power functions the best part of this set  and the reason i bought it really  is the integration of power functions bizarrely this isnt mentioned at all on the box and i only found out about it from the instructions when they were posted on eurobricks instructions for book 2 which has the power function stuff available here this is a great idea and hopefully we will see more new sets take this kind of approach especially with the new train sets luckily i got monster dino 4958 on sale for half price earlier this year so already had most of the necessary motors etc  the only one needed was an extra small one what you need is listed in the instructions below with redirections to shop  home to buy the motors note theres actually a mistake on this page the 2 small motors you need are both 8883 not 8882 which is the large xl motor way to confuse the kids there lego attaching them was a dream and only took a few minutes in contrast to 4958 where it was almost impossible to remove motor elements without dismantling the model basically the back platform and some plates and orange slopes come off you attach the motors and then the smaller plates go back on these parts are now left loose overall the look of the reaper isnt badly effected as youre mainly viewing from the front anyway sadly i cant show you how it moves youll just have to trust me that it does  the way it is steered is demonsrated in the instruction pages above basically each motor is controlled by a corresponding switch on the remote move them both forward to move forward move one right to turn right move both back to move back etc it zips along its a speedy little thing personally i wouldnt want to be in its path as it comes roaring down the martian canyon my cat was scared as it was it is oodles of fun and definitely worth trying if you have the motors or can get them cheaply and adds a whole new dimension to the play aspect of playset it is also as i said very quick to switch between modded and nonmodded reaper in contrast to the more fiddly dino creations the only problem i had is that if it moves too fast the weight of the battery box at the back tends to pull the whole thing back and it rears up it does correct itself though i only trialled this on carpet last night so it may behave differently on other surfaces  i will need to experiment part 5 summation this is a great set made even better with the addition of power functions at aud7995 its wellpriced buy it buy the motors as well kmart still has stock of 4958 at 89 wait for a 15 off sale you wont regret it buy 2 and make competing battle machines the only thing is just dont torture that poor jelly edited by sinner 24 june 2008  0325 am	positive

wow this thing is very cool definately no lack of details and is quite cheap for the bang of the set that you get for some reason i really love the bay in the back of the detachable ship quite an improvement from last years line thank you for the review	positive
i was going to buy this set anyway but now im even more excited d my favorite part of this set is the bay that holds the little cart vehicles	positive
thank you for that fine review sveltecorps that´s a pretty cool set much more solid than the armoured drilling unit with a nice little transporter and some for sure pretty interesting additional power functions a very smart idea indeed did i miss something or is there really only one and probably improved shooting device and there´re even some levers to control the vehicles wow a matured marsmission on indeed now let´s get rid of these poor utilized jellies and we´re right on the way	positive
iron moose on jun 4 2008 1128 am said so is there some way to get all those motor bits at once or do you have to buy them on their own i dont think ive ever seen them in a store here only from sh so far or if you buy sets which they come in all the ones you need apart from one additional small motor are available in the 4958 monster dino set which i got half price i ordered the extra from sh at the same time i bought the set  but only because i had already looked at the instructions and knew what i needed if people have the ferris wheel set as well i think the small motor comes in that	neutral
thanks for the great review sveltecorps i bought some of the mm last year and ended up selling them off for sw this new set has got me interested in mm again partly due to your cool review one question though did you get this set in aust shops or sh just wondering if i should be looking for it yet edit sorry just saw your other post saying it was ordered from sh cheers isc edited by i scream clone 04 june 2008  0808 am	positive
sveltecorps on jun 3 2008 1209 pm said the only thing is just dont torture that poor jelly i smell another dont hurt the dragonsjellies or something group nice reveiw i dont realy like the mm sets we want more starjusticespace skulls but this one looks ok i guess suprised they dont say that it has power functions on the box	positive
really nice review i love those sweet looking power functions on it if only the orange bits could be replaced then you could have a futuristic and motorized jungle cutter anyway the alien bit was disturbing but the overlytall new commanders look very very cool all in all a great set but i wont be able to buy it because in a few days sh will become 600 richer and my wallet will writhe around in pain on the floor	positive

thanks for the review i have to concede this does appear to be the weakest set of the summer mm lineup ive noticed a trend that the larger sets have plenty of parts potential but when assembled the model is not more than the sum of the parts eagle base certainly didnt seem worth the asking price at least this is one large model on a positive note the lame aero tubes darts and martian carrier pods have disappeared dont get me wrong i love mm and most of the lineup is great this one just seems to fall a little short of the bar	neutral

algernon on jun 4 2008 0934 am said i dont understand why theres so much negativity this is actually my favorite of the new mm sets the finished look is very sleek and not very gappy at all the deployable landing pad is great and itll make it easy to put on a shelf without taking too much room lots of greebles although i will concede that its just begging to be modded still though im definitely buying this one  it has a really great look to it i dont understand the negativity either one mans treasure is another mans trash i suppose that said having grown up with lego during the 80s this set has a certain nostalgia factor in its overall look and feel that harkens back to that earlier period in my life which i fondly remember aside from the factory star justice set elements of which i loathe i expect the 7644 to be the closest thing to a classic space revival that well ever see again from the lego group but i hope to be pleasantly suprised someday though im not living in the past and do appreciate everything lego is doing now and will do and has done since and like you im one whos definitely buying this set no matter how few of us there may be	positive

great review mr boba fett i really like this set a lot some of the features may not be as good as i hoped they would but overall this looks to be a really nice set im so happy that the giant spacecrafts are finally back quote ive noticed a trend that the larger sets have plenty of parts potential but when assembled the model is not more than the sum of the parts eagle base certainly didnt seem worth the asking price at least this is one large model on a positive note the lame aero tubes darts and martian carrier pods have disappeared hm actually i dont see the comparison eagle base looked terible to me right from the start so it was no suprise when it ended up being the weakest kit in the first year this big ship on the other hand looked great as soon as i saw it and still looks good	positive

sorry mr mandalorian i guess i was just getting a bit defensive because when this set first appeared here there were literally 2 pages of people just bagging out the new mm sets but then the thread took a turn and people started to warm to them much like the agents i do agree that it definitely needs some mocing but with that work i think it has the potential to be a really amazing set in terms of what you could cram into it the lab is a little disappointing ive always wanted an enclosed cabin space in a vehicle this size because then all the little space guys can have a true meeting place the dropdown landing ramp is my favourite part it has lots of potential uses maybe its even possible to integrate pneumatics d	positive
i didnt see this one coming probably because that huge white beard got in the way was this shadows impersonates aluvar week or something ok this wasnt the worst thing ive ever seen we can try a real one in the future the not too near but maybe not too far future i guess where is that a map of anyway	negative

thanks for the nice review  it was one of the first ones i got when emerging from my dark ages  i bought two of these just for buckbeack  i thought he would make a good statue in a persian temple type moc i also liked the minifig head pumpkin and plant part in bright green  both new pieces to me at the time all in all it was a good castle or forest building set with a nice selection of pieces for rocks grass plants and trees the dark bley plume piece also now appears in the 10185 green grocer set as detailing on the roof of the turret	positive
guys thanks for your comments glad you find this review useful and be sure to watch out for more old sets reviews mr spielbrick on jun 12 2008 1228 am said this draco is the best tlc has made if you ask me the new one also doubling for belloq and guards in the indy line doesnt look quite as hautain as this one buckbeak looks cool looks like his neckhead can be moved right rather similar to lego horses well designed mr spielbrick thanks for pointing out some important highlights for the review i have overlooked it earlier i strongly agreed with you that this draco is the best tlc made i pretty like the face compared to others furthermore i used my multiple dracos for my castle armor guards instead one could not have too many dracos buckbeak design is well made the head can be moved upwards and downwards the mechanism is similar to the horse design in addition buckbeak wings can be removed similar to the typical green or black dragon wings that we used to see in the past well the main reason for me to buy this set was in fact buckbeak you dont often find a griffin lying around except in harry potter sets mr spielbrick on jun 12 2008 1228 am said the orange brick doesnt have a pumpkin face on it right unlike the one from philosophers stone in the set with the troll sorry to said there is no print on that pumpkin face its pure orange	positive
lookin good so far though i must say its doc ock not dok ock the catapult is well ridiculous but the boat is very spiffy and the buoy is a nice addition i actually like the stickers on the window pieces perfect for this building and great for postapoc scenes black lifesaver rings are a nice addition tooanyway hurry up dragonator and batbrick and daisy i want to see the rest of the review iamded away	positive

great review batbrick i was curious as to what the interior of the building looked like i still think that there should have been a few random chains or something lying around as they may add to the abandoned feeling that the ware house had though i have to admit that i really like the roof dock and minifigs as some of them make good average civilians that are somewhat hard to come by in todays sets  great comic as well it seemed to add a lot to your review hope you can review another spider man set soon  btw as adam mentioned i believe you owe me a bar of soap for reading your review  edited by mack 14 june 2008  1259 am	neutral

brainbox on jun 14 2008 0714 am said thanks for the review even if it is a number of years late i picked this up whn it came out and thought it was a rather cool set besides the catapult plenty of cool pieces and the baseplate has found a use in the batcave although i think my dad managed to spill some beer on it at one point that was awful to clean off not late just delayed beer and i though playdoh was bad brainbox on jun 14 2008 0714 am said i wasnt expecting that there i was casually scrolling down when i stumbled onto a picture of me had to be done and it fitted your character didnt it adam on jun 14 2008 0740 am said where is my soap over there mack on jun 14 2008 1055 am said btw as adam mentioned i believe you owe me a bar of soap for reading your review  see above grevious on jun 15 2008 0330 am said great review the hippy and the story at the end were hilarious i think this was easily the best of the spiderman 2 sets youre right though  it wasnt movie acurate as the actual movie dock was far shabbier and more trashed than this ah well i guess tlc couldnt do everything thanks grevious it is a great set the hippy is awesome it was hard to take him apart iamded on jun 15 2008 0846 am said wait dragonators not caring that hes being held by doc ock what are you doing a very nice finish to the interview now i really want this set the story at the end was neat except for spidey dieing  but my favourite part was the exploding dragonator nothing personal mate it just looks cool when people are thrown into fusion reactors yes i agree exploding dragonators are always hilarious maybe i should pm him that pic as for dragonator not caring it was late and i was getting careless batbrick away	positive

hi everyone please note that this review was done back in 2006 so do forgive me if you happened to notice any dated comments product 6205 vwing theme star wars no of pieces 118 release date feburary 2006 rrp sgd2990usd990 availability lego shophome target toys r us us  europe bricksworld sg legocom said rule the spaceways the sleek vwing fighter can adapt to any situation position the wings and flaps in attack mode to protect palpatines shuttle from enemies or position the wings in flight mode to survey the area for intruders either way the vwing is ready to strike for the republic includes clone pilot and r4 droid position wings in attack or flight mode sorry to all for the delay since this was supposed to be done 3 days ago anyway to get on with it quite a minimal amount of baggies for this set as noticed and the best thing is no sticker sheet yippee bounce the completed vwing though not really a complaint it would be nice if the entire astromech body was provided instead of only the head dome p of course then it wouldnt be movieaccurate since the q7 series astromech is integrated with the starfighter lol hes definitely wellpainted for a simple minifig since even the back is painted too i have to assumed this is the same minifig provided for 7259 arc170 starfighter too since i dont have that set anyway this minifig is much more accurate for this vwing since his suit is rated against vacuum while those in the arc170 arent  p one thing thats lacking is the instruments panel in the cockpit its totally nonexistent here i wonder what went wrong during the design stage personally this is the second most anticipated set for 2006 the first being the tie interceptor for me one thing is that theres no known release of the vwing starfighter by hasbro nor the other wellknown brands the other thing is that being a star wars vehicle collector i would really loved to see a replica toy of the vwing and the vwing by the lego group does not disappoint its nearly movieaccurate except for the cockpit transparisteel cover which could used some paint like the xwings also theres a permanent landing gear that quite neat since it allows you to land the craft on uniform surfaces the sfoils on the other hand can be quite a pain to pose into flight position very difficult for the sfoils to remain symmetrical during play the swooshable or play factor of this product is quite good just check out the pics for yourself d crackle general skywalker we have incoming to conclude the vwing starfighter would make a much better companion to the eta2 actis interceptor jedi starfighter than the arc170 coz the arc170 seems more like a longrange bomber to me than a snubfighter p and a final pic to show it at rest comments for 2008 just an updated pic to show my latest display on the clone wars hmm off the record i do understand that sometimes reviews by most tend to a certain set of guidelines like naming the set and showing the boxed and out of boxed pics and of course the grading portion regarding my review i prefer not to grade any of the lego sets at all as far as possible because to each hisher own my reasons to put up a review is not to belittle the efforts of tlg in coming out with these products nor to help them market them but to show my appreciation and enjoyment of these products i hope noone is offended by this and would like to apologise for any misunderstanding that this may caused for those who do not understand the above paragraph care not for it and play on like me	positive

nice review  the driverpilot whatever you call him   s helmet looks kind of odd and why does have a long red pole instead of a kickbutt lightsaber	negative
vader had a red pole because i think it makes him look bigger and in the films i doubt it is but i think his saber might be bigger	neutral
i never got the set it looked way to skinny i came close to buying it for the figs but then decided not to if you compared this one to the later one there is a big difference this one just didnt seem proporshined with the legs and its body	negative
thank you for the review skipper i never got this set because it was too expensive and motorized it completley reminded me of the old robotic toys called zoids or maybe even gundum at least the figs are great a chrome lightsabe hilt for luke ecxellent and the pilot is cool too and another snowie doesnt hurt and i didnt even know about the commander guy whatever you call him so people could have made a custom ds this whole time thanks again	positive
this is one of those sets that you just have to have i mean a motorised atat is a dream set for original trilogy fans and has an awesome set of minifigures	positive
darkrebellion on jun 25 2008 1239 am said great review kimt  i like this set even if i don´t own it because it looks simple fantastic to display i just have one question the mini executor can be moved around the death star ii or its attached to that place thanks for the review  its attached to the ds and cannot move as such though there is 4 spots where it can be attached to the ds reading your comments on this set i can see why tlg has been forced to put it on sale on the us sh i dont agree that the isd is better  imho theyre exactly them same  big and grey this is a question of personal liking  which is the coolest ds or isd not comparative id still call this an ok ucs when looking at it individually but there sure is a lot other ucs sets that would get a better score than 510 kimt	positive
great concise review kimt though its not for me you held my interest all the way through thanks isc	positive
the build was a bit boring and i suppose a big grey ball isnt all that interesting but since the death star ii in the movie is a big grey ball too i dont see the problem i didnt think it was particularly fragile i dont care about minifigs or playability either a few plusses in my opinion it looked pretty damn impressive sitting in my lego room and the construction is really clever all in all i actually liked this one but perhaps i have a different expectation of sets than most of you sets are mainly parts packs and would you look at the quantity of grey plate in this thing its new grey btw i paid half price for it at shophome uk which is still a lot more than half price from the us and i didnt regret it for a second cheers ralph	negative
kimt on jun 25 2008 0834 am said i dont agree that the isd is better  imho theyre exactly them same  big and grey this is a question of personal liking  which is the coolest ds or isd not comparative here are some advantages that makes isd win for me  a lot more fun to build with less repetitions  it is easier to build alternate models from it how many alternate models of the ds2 have you seen  the bricks are more varied  you get magnets  it is a larger set if you look at the size	positive

dang so much negativity on a such spectacular set this baby provides an amazing backdrop to any lego inspired star wars diorama and lets face it lego tends to be a rectangular brick and somehow we now have a sphere guys its a ucs it accurately depicts the on screen icon and put plain and simple is a wonderful sculptural piece of work in its own right i agree with kimt in that the removal of the laser and super star destroyer gives it more authenticity but to call it a gray golf ball or ignore its inherent accuracy is simply to miss the point it proved to be the best build to share with someone be it family or friend due to its repeated sections and impressive finish its a clever build and to criticize it for lack of playability or i suspect for many its absence of minifigs is just absurd and possibly why lego has not released a proper ucs in nearly two years i reckon many out there would love a ucs tyderium imperial walker or slave 1 with a spectacular piece count be it minifig scale or just darn impressive in its own right sadly for those who love these sculptural masterpieces were stuck with simple toys with play features and cute minifigs clever in their own right but lacking the clout and purity of the old ucs line lets hope some diversity of product is just around the corner else 10179 was the last of the truly brave financial gambles of the star wars line	positive

thanks for the review poor little minifig this guy has to haul the heavy machine all the way from the depot onto the littered streets to locate some trash but when he has finally found some and switches on the machine everything will be launched towards his pants no wonder hes looking sad a nice set though and inventive too when it comes to streetsweepers i remember getting the first of its kind on my birthday in 1991	positive

thanks for another review whitefang this is quite a nice set actually it evokes some of the design elements of the mx11 while looking different enough to justify me buying it the head on the astronaut is one i like so even better i hadnt realised it was that one actually does 26 pieces make it one of the bigger impulses sets i think i may have to get one if not two plus its called crystal hawk how can that not be considered cool	positive

i really like the look of this impulse set even though i sold off my mm sets to buy sw i kept my astro fighter and this impulse set really appealed from the moment i laid eyes on it i feel the swooshability and cool extras like the double sided face far outweigh the lack of cockpit thanks for another great review whitefang	positive
i like this one aswell it has a couple of parts i need for an moc train locomotive and i dont have any of those space guys yet and a double faced guy is always a winner in my book	positive
once again another outstanding review by sveltecorps i am not a very big fan of agents but this theme defintely offer plenty of useful parts this volcano base is simply fanastic for parts usage especially in doing up landscaping with mountains by making use of the brown burps i must admit that the exterior looks real cool but the interior looks rather empty these orange slopes certainly make a great illustration of the larva which gives the agents a hard time to infiltrate within its compound to save his comrade i am quite sure this set will defintely attracts lots of kids to coax their parents to buy it since the bright colors will defintely caught their attention with all those hitech sleek weaponary i am sure this is the next big thing for kids out there well i am not sure if this theme works for me as well but this set defintely works well for landscaping project	positive
excellent review sc thanks for sharing the figs are awesome i really like the female villain  an excellent face i also like the agent uniforms the laser gun is perfect it has that peter sellerspink panther dooms day device look that i envision when i think of laser destruction the volcano has some neat features as well like the trans redorange lava it is a bit heavy on stickers though as are many new setsthemes but overall i think this set will really appeal to the kids  a great review of a neat set	positive

sveltecorps on jul 19 2008 1020 am said nothing is impossible to mod probably the easiest part to change would be the front where the missiles are and the treasure chest slides out  you could make a sizeable compartment there however the middle section is so narrow and the end fins are just that  fins  that it might be harder to expand without changing the shape of the sub youll find out soon when yours arrives thanks for that info i will definitely try anyway when i get the set see if i cant loosen up a few dark blue bricks at the same time sveltecorps on jul 19 2008 1020 am said its not really clear but since all the other mutants are evil or at least controlled by dr inferno its probably a safe bet the squid is too slime faces head is different to the joker bombs  different eyes and teeth although the smile is similar i guess and the slime marks are much more apparent in the flesh or abs although they dont photograph that way joker bomb face below for contrast ah thanks for that info i see that they are more different than i thought now i hope the slime looks good when i get him batbrick away	neutral
wow thanks for the review that is one awesome set slime face is excellent i must add him to the collection i think we need some new agents theres so many inferno minifigures now maybe next year thanks again	positive
great looking set and that glowy blue octopus is really cute i might just get it for that be great in a space moc wondering from the pdf instructions i saw it wasnt clear what the agent in the sub is sitting on hows his seat work and it looks like theres a compartment below him	positive
6927 all terrain vehicle year released 1981 piece count 167 minifigs 2 list price 1450 a very unique vehicle in the classic space collection was this allterrain vehicle which i always considered more along the line of a mobile lab the set introducedinfused white and black bricks with classic blue space pieces the result was this great classic vehicle the set includes two figs still red and white heres a view of the vehicle which is really two components the vehicle itself and the lab section i absolutely loved the the blue windshield slopes 2 included and the unique upsidedown large blue slope in the back of the vehicle is the blue lab the back section of the vehicle has hinges that allow the jets sections to open the brick design fits perfectly into the lab and when opened the lab falls to the ground note the little round trans red 1x1s allow the lab to slide up and forward when the jet sections are closed i tried taking off the red 1x1s and the lab does not lift as easily with them the design is very clever esp for a classic set heres a shot of the standalone lab unlike earlier classic space windows this set has train window frames with yellow windows the top of the lab lifts up for playability inside the lab are several computers and a swivel chair back to the vehicle heres a shot of the cockpit with white steering wheel the left side has an upsidedown wrench and black antenna the right side a walkietalkie and another antenna the antennas can be used as breaks to keep the middle wheels from moving heres ashot of the under carriage and a final shot of the complete set for those of you following my classic space reviews this is review number 9 of 10 my final review of anall time favorite will be coming soon hope you enjoyed this review comments are always welcome	positive

thanks for the review this is one of my favorite space sets of all time i even had 2 of them back in the days my only complain about this set was that i found that the wheels where too small  i had some trouble passing the rover over the little cratersmountains of the space plates	positive
this is a great little set i like how it combines two very different color schemes for different parts of the model i have made some slight modifications to mine adding a roof on the vehicle and a back wall on the outpost also those white 1x1 headlight plates at the front are thinner than the modern kind and seem to be quite weak i got this set off ebay a while ago and one of them was broken in shipping even though the set was otherwise in display model condition and the other one broke off while i was building the set i replaced them with the newer variety mutex on jul 10 2008 1137 pm said my only complain about this set was that i found that the wheels where too small  i had some trouble passing the rover over the little cratersmountains of the space plates the only bad thing about this set is the name it cant even roll over a single plates height not very all terrain at all edited by cp5670 11 july 2008  0743 am	positive
give me an excuse to sneak into your house and let me have a feel of these classic space sets i never had a chance to have any experience with the classic space sets through your recent reviews on these it gave me a wider perspective of space i loved to play space as a child such as the late classic and futuron sets back to the review this 6927 is a great mobile command center vehicle suitable for all kinds of harsh terrain in the unknown space the 6 big wheels are real solid and firm back in those days transparent blue windscreen at the front is wonderful i just love these parts especially when its in blue 4 computer printed tiles arent lego so generous back in those days when printed parts are more commonly available unlike now its a real nice set however there is one thing i dont understand about this design why is the driver seat has a wide back with no cover behind and the command center has no door at the back i understand that these space guys are always carrying their helmet around for oxygen supply i wonder if there is a better answer to it	positive
oh man this review takes me back i got this set when i was 8 years old and loved it i remember modding it to remove the lab in the back and i put in a giant laser cannon instead cause when youre 8 years old everything needs a giant laser cannon cp5670 on jul 11 2008 1243 am said the only bad thing about this set is the name it cant even roll over a single plates height not very all terrain at all ha very true the vehicle is built so low to the ground that the front end catches on everything	positive
quote great buy on this one what did it cost you it was 30 which was a pretty good price given the condition it had no box or instructions though this set is actually fairly common on ebay though considering how old it is i see them pretty frequently on there quote its a real nice set however there is one thing i dont understand about this design why is the driver seat has a wide back with no cover behind and the command center has no door at the back i understand that these space guys are always carrying their helmet around for oxygen supply i wonder if there is a better answer to it i just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed edited by cp5670 11 july 2008  0639 pm	neutral
this set never got me as a kid i suspect it was because of the wheels i had mostly basic sets so it would have been more of the same looking at it now i can see i have misjudged it and i love the lablift method im going to have to build this to see it in action thanks for another great review	positive
yeah first time that i am getting a set before everyone first of all the package the european version has no limited edition button hooray sorry for the blurry backshot we see the hospital back a few bubbles with set functions and a little comic comic bubbles the figures are injured spongebob patrick and the new fish doctor spongebob has a headprint and a backprint other than the normal spongebob spongebob and injured bob the set comes with two litters the ambulance car is a bit extraordinary i don´t know how the car is like in the show and i saw a lot of episodes but it looks a bit strange mostly because the weehls are too small of course we get another ss not so d this time the litter fits in the back with help of this lid i wish it would be the hingelid from before 2004 now we come to the meanpart of the set the hospital the entrance has got babyblue traindoors and a hudge sign that shows emergency the tubes are nearly everywhere in this set i was getting insane when i came to the part where i must put the stickers on the tubes this parts are very usefull but i wanted that the set looks good because i will display it so i stickered just two of the parts and not all four now we come to the interroir the doctor has a desk with computer sadly it´s not very well placed and he must duck because of his fin next to the door we get this little case wash basin and two drawers again we get stickers not that i don´t like stickers it´s just everytime i get to the part where i must put the stickers on i think how i can reuse the model and if i rebuild the model later and and and i hate it to deside a few posters are in it too the set is a great addittion to your own bikino bottom but the playability is not very big for the kids they can just play that patrick steals the ambulance car like shown on the package and is hitting spongebob than the drive back the doctor gives spongebob two medicines and let him go i bought the set mostly because of the parts tubes in lightbley and a few woodpieces but i am thinking about let it stand in my little bikini bottom just consist of crusty crab and chum bucket playability 310 figures 1010 price 810 design 910 total 3040	positive

nice review nft i´m not that much into spongebob but these two pieces just for themselves are interesting to get container cupboard 4532 and cupboard drawer 4536 the latter not being sold for the last 6 years both together are an excellent way to create detailed interiors 6 of those for me please	positive
theres a lot great pieces in this set i would be willing to get the set just for them thanks for the great review	positive
i recently bought this set for my daughters birthday its the first belville set that ive bought for her so its a bit of an experiment the house is 5 rooms and its made up of mostly large pieces there still is a decent amount of normal lego in it though the doorways in the house align when it is opened out starting with the bathroom included is a shower toilet sink with vanity and a baby potty the mirror sticker is one of the few that i put on the open plan loungekitchendining room is well appointed as well and it has a nice glass table and coffee machine the kitchen chairs are fabuland parts and dont work really well it seems they are having jellyfish for dinner the clock is the only printed part in the set upstairs is a baby room and the master bedroom the radio and the tv not shown were stickers to my disappointment up top is an extra room suitable for reading those antenna things were made from spare parts by my daughter i have no idea what they are supposed to be  there are some stickers that go on the back but i didnt put them on as it is the set looks ok this way but since it is a dolls house it doesnt really matter i do think though that the fireplace should have been given a back the bbq is made from normal parts and is quite effective i think it uses the same light brick thats in the 4998 stegosaurus set my kids were using it as a torch before my grumbling ruined their fun like all belville sets the highlight is arguably the accessories ill be borrowing a few of these from time to time here is the controversial baby catapult as you can see it works ok but lego probably should have tried a bit harder we also bought for her 7583 playful puppy it also comes with some nice accessories but not enough to justify buying unless you want the rest of the parts poor puppy where does he sleep here is my daughter assembling it she made me make the house though as she wanted to play a game we bought her note the lego drink bottles  i didnt take any photos of the figures as they dont seem to be anything new but i can if people want me to at the time i was in bit of a hurry as i took these before bed so i wouldnt be stressed if the kids broke it the next day overall these sets seem overpriced to me and hard to justify unless you actually want a buildable dolls house which we did its still too early to tell if my daughter likes it or not but at this stage it seems she lost interest in a few days she does tend to go back to toys though edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0703 pm indexed	negative
great review and i note something like a bucket in the dog set shame its not blue as for the fire place piece i love it and i want one ever since finding it on mlcad i love the bbq it looks so good you know i might even buy this it it was not so pink now as for the kiddies in ovens make sure they are not over cooked they can be stringy  and as for the couple up stairs now we at least know what you do with your mini figs when no one is looking lego sets in public places  just following your name sake i guess and i must say lego shame shame that catapult needs reviwing hardly even make a dent in a castle wall regards cpt pb	positive
nice review good to see your almost letting your kids play with your lego i like the functionality of the baby catapult its good that they include some working features in a build this big are you not showing the figures because its really hugh hefners playboybelville mansion i dont see the grotto though must be an add on set like the poor puppy its just so darn pink	positive
great review sinner i havent seen a bellville set review before i just realised what you meant by fore in the topic subtitle too imperialshadows on jul 12 2008 0931 am said obviously it really is all about the accessories and its got em but not enough to make me spend that kind of cash and i dont even mind having a pile of pink parts around i agree a lot of the pieces are good but i dont think i would get it however i do think i will get the set with the dogs so my minifigs can have giant mutant hounds jimbutcher on jul 12 2008 0645 pm said and look what you found a bucket a bucket in disguise as a watering can	neutral

sinner you know i had never seen a belville set in any review with such great pictures before i just cant take my eyes off in the master bedroom the scene is quite a little hot enough of me peeping up there lets take a look at the interior i am very surprised by its construction of the house its quite big and is nice of you to buy a great sweet gift for your daughter i am very sure she will enjoyed playing with it somehow it reminded me of barbie doll products maybe its too pinkish for me the accessories is the plus factor in any belville sets it offered quite a handful of great accessories to add into any types of mocs construction to add in the plus factor in it sinner you are a very nice dad i like how parents buy educational toys for their children to expand their imaginations instead of sitting in a couch playing video games and etc	positive

i believe theres another set that has star corps trooper with an orange pauldron is it any better	neutral
thanks for the review i want to add that the few parts which are contained in this set are very usable for own mocs the rancor on jul 12 2008 1111 pm said unfortunately the droid battle pack is discontinued for the uk sh ooops  its also not available in germany any more	neutral
hmmm i probably would not have bought this as a kid in 1987 unless i had money to spare or the shop had no other set from space or castle the two other big lines in 1987 and no better set in the town section i think its a great parts pack but the model itself does not look very attractive i never really liked those wheels honestly theyre from the basic sets mostly and they work pretty well in those but im just not a fan the roof on the other hand was very popular and the blue modified bricks at the front were quite rare in those days but generally speaking this was not the star of 1987 gave it a 3	negative

i recently got a few still sealed and new sets from the 90 on ebay and after the rock raiders hover scout this isthe second one ill review i really like the space port theme even if the sets may be more simple than earlier space city sets i like the overall look and the color scheme but enough of that lets go on with the pictures set nr 6455 name space simulation station number of minifigs 3 number of pieces 240 release year 1999 first again a few pics of the boxes and the instructions the main box this theme had a kinda strange seperation of the pieces the parts for the control center and the shuttle are in seperate little boxes and the others are in polybags with the models printed on them also seperate instructions for each step a general overview we got 3 lovely minifigs here from left to right the control engineer the mechanic and the astronaut the i dont know the english word for it testingthing the astronaut is being tested to hard nerves there the mechanics little car on the back an extinguisher and a radio device is attached the takeoff station for the little shuttle with the shuttle itself on it and without it tools tools tools the shuttle as standalone i think that would be fuel tanks i like this little detail and finally we have the controll room would have been better with seats but its alright a really sweet midsized set if you ask me a few juniorized parts but it fits perfectly with the set the theme itself is also great and i wish that tlg brings it back i could see stunning sets with the quality city sets have right now	positive
i got this set for christmas and you gave me the feeling for wanting to build it again thanks for the review	positive
the spinning machine is a centerfuge not sure of the spelling  i remember wanting this set because my friend had the larger station with full rocket seeing this makes me want it again	positive
i had never seen this set or this theme before it was released during my dark age and i had missed it its nice to see such sets surface once again to educate members like me that there are some good sets we had missed during the dark age and i must admit that this is a very good set its comes with 3 minifigs and staudie with it geez i never thought he was an astronaunt back then the testing facility is great and i love to see it spin by putting staudie in it for a testrun the buggy is cute as well but somehow i dont really like the white frame at the back it looked a little odd to me the tools are simply wonderful to have furthermore these are grey tools the last time we had so many tools are the aeroplane mechanic the shuttle is nice but does the shuttle supposed to come with a cover as well i guess since this is a simulator they must have cut down the budget for it the control room is good and it will be even better with chairs included metalandi thanks for the wonderful review	neutral
wow im just surprisedi thought these were all street dated for the 26th of july at least thats what i read according to lucas information oh well gratz on getin one of the new sets im looking forward to seeing the droid gunship and the twilight real real real soon	neutral

the figs theyre possibly the best part of the entire set all in all nice new head although the glasses limit its usability i am in love with the head on that fig its perfect for any number of figures  a good scarred hero face has always been on my want list im turning him into my viking warlord after i post this review again a new head great stubbly beard thing going on my secondfavorite head of the lot great for warriors especially with helms the torsos are fantastic for special forces figures if anyones planning to do something like that not too fond of the lime green on there but its still extremely usable this is actually a really cool machine gun i like it i think this would be a good point to note that all designs you see  outside the figures and dinos  are stickers that means a crapload of stickers if you cant stand stickers at all in a set dont buy this	positive
sam89 on jul 25 2005 0111 pm said that looks like a really great set although i dont think id have anywhere to put it i dont think ill ever be able to get the set anyway since it doesnt come out over here sam missing your point the set should come to europe as 7298 but without guns large crate instead	neutral
hmmmm     interesting its a shame though because i really like the guns any idea when it should come to europe edit ive just scene the official dino attack site which says theyre coming to europe in october	neutral
wow great review for a great set thanks jay i really like it although to big for my city  i too really like the mfs because of your review i am definitely considering it thanks again legobmw	positive
thats interesting news about the european release id definitely be interested to see how they modify the set  chains ropes and crates are definitely useful pieces cant wait for pictures to everyone looking for just the figures  dont skip out and get the smaller set and the tank spend the extra 20 and get the t1 its well worth it i might pick up the steel sprinter and the fire hammer myself still trying to decide if i do ill review them	positive
the weapon whatever its called this uses the same mechanism as the longboat for those that dont have either you snap the little sports stand thing which hits the missile which fires and since theres nothing holding the technic beam up to that height any more it drops down so that the next missile drops into place pretty cool if unrealistic the two on the side do not fire i think theyre mainly there for extra ammo my biggest problem with this set open bed this could have easily been remedied with a few plates interior opened the fire hammer next to the t1 they look very cool together dont they you can also see my curio shelf final score 7410 dinos 110 fig 810 but thats just me hummer 8510 parts 910 im a harsh reviewer i still think that if spacevehicles are your thing you should buy this however if youre a bigger castle fan or just like to get all sorts of lego i would still suggest buying the viking catapult before this however i do think that these are some of the coolest sets of 2005 this is something you will eventually want to get until next time bloody jay	positive
mr legobildur on jul 25 2005 1011 pm said thanks bloody jay any chance you could be reviewing the other dino attack sets possibly the steel sprinter and urban avenger but i can say with finality that i will not buy the tank until i find it available for 30 or less on that note if anybody does find it for 30 or less shoot me a pm 	neutral
sorry for the double post but i just had another question in mind how longhighwide is this badass copter including rotors i have heard of as long as 25 inches for the length but is this true or is it just an exaggeration	neutral
wow i think this is the first time im the first to have a new set at least here and review it got it 2 days ago thanks to a fast shipping from sh this time and i found time now to review it now enough of the babbling lets let the facts and pictures speak which actually turned out pretty well this time set nr 4210 name coast guard platform number of minifigs 4 number of pieces 469 release year 2008 a few shots of the box first 2 books of instructions we got here first one for the helicopter second one for the rest and the platform itself a general overview of the platform from above the 4 minifigs 3 rescue guys and one oil rig worker  the pilot seems not very happy that he has to work in the middle of nowhere at sea right beside the entry of the tower we have the diving equipment holder next the guy can jump in this little speedboat and another guy brings it down to water with the crane if somebody is rescued from the air he arrives here and is brought to the tower with the little moving platform than runs on rails down under we got a buoy and several life belts and extinguishers with the lift somebody who is rescued by the boat can be brought up i think it would been better if they would have made a mechanism there to bring it up but its okay a few floors higher the sea is being observated and watched on the ground level we have the medical stationwarmup room the helicopter as standalone all in all for me this is besides the police station the city set of this year its got great features and looks fantastic and also has many useful pieces you cant do anything wrong with buying it 1010 for me thats all for now hope you liked my review edit oh damn i forgot to write review in the topic title can a mod please add this thanks	positive
thanks for the awesome review metalandi your pics are very clear and you go into detail about all the functions of the set i agree this is a great set  one of the best of the cg line for sure way better than the boat set with the tower on the bionicle baseplate and cheaper too i even like the helicopter better than the oversized version lots of great parts and a really nice build by the looks of it too i cant wait for this to be released in oz	positive
very nice review and nice set to boot lots of little features that increase the playability great pics too i remember you had trouble before with the tower raid castle set as i just got mine and was looking to review it but saw your review in archivesshakes fist at how slow aussies get sets  great reviews on	positive
good review  i will buy it this year 	positive
excellent review metalandi its always great to see early pictures of new sets this set really reminds me of an oil rig and could probably be easily modified as one if one wanted an alternate model the two components that i like most are the boat crane and the control room but other sections are pretty slick as well are those printed pieces in the control room or stickers im really starting to gain an appreciation for these new coast guard sets theyve come a long way over the years 575 coast guard station released 1978 i picked up the control boat  tower 7739 a few weeks ago but havent opened it yet in any case thanks for taking the time to review this set and share it over eb	positive

whitefang on jul 18 2008 0911 pm said paramedic unit does not seem to suit well for this sets name it should be named as clinic outpatient treatment family doctor and etc the definition of a paramedic is someone who assists physicians in providing medical care i think in more modern times a paramedic is generally thought of as a more qualified and experienced ambulance technician but the dictionary definition would seem to fit with the lego model quite well cheers rog	neutral

4 stars the suspension wheel holder totally rocks yeah though the slope brick 45 2x3 x 1 13 double disappoints me a little btw the 6350 pizza to go van looks soooo cute thanks for the review and keeeeep them coming	positive
another great review whitefang this is a wonderful 80s vehicle  and i think it might be one of the first  if not the first  that had the spring suspension system i know of at least one other set that had that the biggest extreme team set from 1998 had a vehicle with those pieces quote this tow truck is pretty useful as you can see current city sets hardly have any tow trucks available to tow new cars design this tow truck is catered for 4studs vehicles for classic town can you imagine yourself this truck towing a speed racer car i think it looks really out of proportion firstly speed racer cars are out of scale even with city vehicles also i have hope that in the next few years we will get more octan sets to go with the wonderful gas station  and i suspect that a 6wide tow truck will be at the top of the list it wouldnt be a hard set to make and i bet it would sell well edited by grevious 19 july 2008  0531 pm	positive
indeed they have theyve appeared in 15 different sets in total they also have an identical width with the wide 2x2 wheels holder which is used on cars today they are still excellent today since retrofitting these suspension parts onto todays offroader trucks wont give them weird proportions or any problems and it looks perfect plus they are useful if youre lazy and dont feel like constructing the pinsuspension used in the early 90s for trucktrailers altough stability probably will suffer	neutral

exxon gas station set  6375 year released 1980 piece count 254 minifigs 3 list price approx 20 one of the gems of my sets from 1980 has to be the exxon gas station it has very nice colors lots of great details and a high level of playability starting with the instructions the backside with a great picture of the complete set the set includes three minifigs including two gas station attendants and my favorite the urban cowboy one of the best things about this set is that it includes not one but two very detailed 4stud wide vehicles heres a picture of the red one which is a twoseater the car has two working doors a hood that opens and a little holed brick on the other side for pretending to fill er up heres another image at an angle isnt she a nice set of wheels heres the yellow car i always liked this one better perhaps it was the color with the black pieces in the back although it is a oneseater the set includes four fuel pumps that are numbered with decals and included a string as the hose heres a little accessory rack for oil and tools and another rack for tires the set had a nice exxon logo on three 1x6 bricks a large jack allows the cars to be lifted high into the air for tire and under engine repairs i love the office with its large 5x6 window inside is a chair and desk and the entire set happy motoring in legoland	positive

panda9001100 on jul 19 2008 1019 am said i love this set its nice and simple maybe its because i build this set by myself by ordering all parts and buildinginstruction and i made one extra tanktransporter  excellent tankers panda these make great additions to the station	positive
again great topicpoll thebrickster i gave this set a 3 which is on the one hand negative is that its really oldfashioned for today  which is on the other hand positive is that it includes very nice and authentic details like e g doors in the cars  which is imo for that time a feat  klausdieter	neutral

best mars mission set ever deserves a great review d	positive
skipper 24 on jul 20 2008 0421 am said i dont know why but i think it looks a bit like the star wars atte could it be that its really big minifig scaled and walks on 4 legs anyway i dont normally like it when people make a topic to say theyll review a set soon but ill let you off since this is one of the few mars mission sets i really like and im glad to know somebody has the set and will be reviewing it peace	positive
wow this is a great mm set and i wouldnt say that but wow this looks awesome its not the theme i really want but if i get this set by accident   i wont mind hope to see your review soon	positive
wooha i thought i never would see a nice mars mission set but this walker ist the best proof i was wrong it really looks good and i love the bricks used to make the shape the airtank is cool and for once i have to say even the stickers are looking good man did i really say that normally i hate stickers nice review some pictures would have gotten better with macro on but as it seems to be time to forgive i won´t point on that any longer thank you very much vbbn	positive

nice review good closeups and a good unconventional choice of a set as for the set itself it has its pros and cons in my eyes i like all the minifigs but especially the witch the fright knights are probably the closest you can get for an evil human castle faction as for the building itself on the other hand i like the fact that it can be modified but some of the design choices are just stupid the holes in the wall the one huge tower as opposed to several smaller ones the huge empty space in the center and the excessive usage of bright yellow i guess for a smaller kid the play value is great its easily accessible and it looks sturdy enough but to an afol its not much else than a source for bricks and figs in my opinion oh and they did have telescopes in the medieval times the witch most probably uses it for astrology and even if they didnt were talking about a castle with a dragon and a wicked witch in it so its not exactly a good example of accurate history	negative
metalandi on jul 20 2008 1223 pm said i actually got one set left i would like to review but im off tomorrow to italy until thursday so i wont be able to do it until then you wont be off till tomorrow thats still a day away theres still time no but still ill be looking forward to the review when you get back peace	neutral
very nice of a very nice set the revolving fireplace  i wonder what movie that could possibly be from	positive
metalandi thanks for doing this fright knights review by opening up a misb set which you have bought recently i am very sure the feeling is very nice especially touching the bricks which is preserved for 11 years sealed in bags i am quite fond of the fright knights theme unfortunately this theme was released during my dark age i never really bought sets from fright knights instead i bought plenty of minifigs to build an army if i could turn back time or find another misb set with a reasonable price i am very sure i will get it my soldiers need a castle to stay in i will be looking forward to your next review keep up the good job	neutral
i read this review not long after you posted it but im not sure why i didnt comment if dragonator is the one to post everytime he sees a dragon related topic i would be the one to post if i see a fright knights topic fright knights is one of my favourite lego themes and this review is really good i got both of the castles in the theme and loved them and your review presents basil the batlords castle well i too thought it was a bit weird that there is a green base when it could be grey but i guess its a useful piece to use in other things fright knights on	positive
ah this brings back memories i have this set and i loved the playabilaty factor opposing to older castle sets i have in medieval times there actually were primitive telescopes you can read about it here thanks for this review great storie great pics	positive
sandy on aug 5 2008 0621 pm said my first post in this topic looks foolish now that i bought this set from ebay i just really wanted the minifigs although i already had the batlord and the black dragon and the parts they will help me greatly in building the impenetrable fortress of the dragonwarriors for my princess quest comic by the end of this week this set will be in my clutches great cant wait for the next installment good review the pieces are so shiny and new all my space sets arent shiny or new this is an excellent castle i got it the day it came out it has a lot of playability	positive
fire station set  6382 year released 19801981 piece count 368 minifigs 4 list price approx 20 legos third fire station was this little gem 6382 the set offered new design elements not previously offered in previous sets what really stands out for me is 1x3 car doors and torsos with printed designs a decal was used for the large sign on the building and the 1 on the hood of one of the vehicles i think this was also the first set to offer the sliding garage mechanism a feature that added a great amount of realism and playability the set also included two blue doors and the new fire hose with preconnected faucetspicket getting on to the pictures i saved the cover of the box for this set but lost the instructions over the years i was able to download some instructions from the web heres a shot of the box cover and the back of the box the set includes four figs three of which are fireman and a lady who can serve as a dispatcher as mentioned above the torsos are printed on my favorite of the two vehicles included i love the design of fire engine 1 i always loved the fire hoses included in this set no string to have to tie or freyed ends engine 2 is this much larger engine with ladder i like how it contains an oxygen tank and fire axe on the other side of the engine are two shutter doors that reveal the hose and ladder controls these are stickers the ladder is much wider than previous lego ladders and extends a good length i like the baseplate of this set which has the numbers one and two marking each garage the building is simple but has a nice design i love the sliding garage doors note notice the two windows of the 2nd floor the actual set should have blinds on these windows ive lost one of the stickered windows so placed the single blinded window on the 1st floor each of the two sides of the garages are the same heres a shot of the right side on the first floor is the dispatch area and a classic blue space computer the 2nd floor has a bed and a chair heres a shot of the entire backside and lastly a shot of the entire station this set is one of my favorite fire stations that offers a great amount of playability hope you enjoyed the review	positive
great review again its nice to see old sets reviewed i love the control stickers theres a great level of detail this is really the second best fire station in my opinion	positive
lovely i cant stop making comparisons between this fire station and last years which is also very well detailed with great features and awesome playability the concept design of the second one its very much like the one reviewed here this is good as tlg is taking back those great values to make the new excellent sets we all are enjoying by now	positive
i honestly glad i got the latest fire station cant remember set number its waayyy better i voted 3 its realy not that great but its ok	neutral
thebrickster on jul 21 2008 0320 pm said youre a tough reviewer darthlegois on jul 22 2008 0854 am said i voted 3 its realy not that great but its ok and you call me a tough reviewer	neutral
a nice little model with some neat features for its age plus the allyime classic fireman as a bonus however this design of chopper the police station around the same time was the same design i think dated very quickly while is was good to use the hinged car roof  which was relatively new at the time  together with the inverted screen it was superceded very quickly by designs that stood the test of time far better for example 6657 also i dont think i could everbuy a lego fire helicopter because it is not something we have in the ukeire police coast guard ambulance military etc etc but no fire helicopters not something i would therefore want in my lego town great review though many thanks again for doing these cheers rog	negative
i vote outstanding because it makes excellent use of the pieces that were available at the time that cockpit makes excellent use of an inverted windshield	positive
hello all eurobricks members and town lovers today i will be doing up a review on snorkel squad one of the most important and basic vehicle in any fire department snorkel squad in simple english terms it refers to fire engine fighting fire always on standby ready to save the citizens from crisis trust me you will understand why this snorkel squad is superb impressive by the end of this review on a side note there is only part that is replaced by another color can you find the difference name snorkel squad theme lego system  town year 1987 pieces 151 minifigs 2 price usd1350 an image of a 6358 snorkel squad looking smart on their standby this snorkel squad is a fanastic fire engine that is ready to save people from the fires its primary color red is used in all fire emergency department and vehicles in case of any emergency this snorkel squad will be activated and arrived at the scene as soon as possible no time to waste personally this is the best fire engine that i had ever seen meet the fire fighters it comes with two brave fire fighters both of them wear the standard fire fighter outfit that is present in almost all fire station sets in classic town the torso is very nice and formal and looks real impressive onto them i love the buttons on them furthermore these white helmets are a symbol to the world of fire fighting these are the people whom save lives by risking their own lives in dangerous situations water hose compartment the water hose is a string that is stored in the front it can be rolled out and the fire fighters are able to use it without much difficulty they will just pull out the hose and spray onto the fire the next picture shows a much clearer look in its interior in addition the fire logo that is on the compartment is actually printed yes its not a sticker and that is great news for us interesting features these clamps on both sides is supposed to stablise the fire engine when the ladder is heading upwards it is a simple mechanism which illustrate clearly what it does this feature is recently seen in construction vehicle such as the mobile crane of course it is not a complicated feature it just made use of three quite common white parts swivel mechanism these swivel mechanism in my opnion are very fun to play with these connectors on the front and the back enable the long fire engine to make sharp turns on any junctions arriving at the scene fast enough this is not a fire engine that only travel straight roads try it onto your base plates and you will be surprised how well it can turn best playable mechanism in 6358 the driver will be activating the ladder at the back of the vehicle in order to adjust the height and making sure that the ladder do not fall short the tiles on the plates are acting like a stoppage the ladder are able to rotate 360 degree without much problem if you removed the driver out of the control panel it goes up as tall as 30cm look at that amazing height too bad i have not constructed my cafe corner yet otherwise i can give you a better feel of how amazing this baby can go i used the old road baseplate as a guide and roughly it can goes as tall as 30 to 35cm look at the black hinges below by shifting it to the last that was the maximum height it can move this is a very good way to adjust the height oh and i forget to mention that there are 2 storage compartments for the fighters to place their equipments behind quite easy to access no doors apart from the standard roof top on the drivers seat there is no doors present at both side i am quite sad to see that there are no doors maybe these fighters are supposed to jump off the seat instead of opening the doors well i guess this is the only major flaws that i had found in this set heading off got you meet the model 6358 fire engine summary review playability 1010 superb fun the ladder and swivel mechanism is really very fun to play with design 9510 excellent design it got an almost full 10 the lack of doors dropped my ratings slightly price 810 a very mid range price i dont think it cost very expensive but i am not sure how much it cost now overall 9210 best fire engine ever and one of the great looking one too get this model now i gave it a 5 based on my review score card what about yours hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated	positive
nice review whitefang with lots of photos  exactly as a good review should be as for the set  i own it and its a very good one the fire squad vehicle is a nice addition to my other fire dept vehicles it offers very good playability and this ladder is so long you can have so much fun with it	neutral
thats a great reviewpoll whitefang i gave this set a 5 its simply  the only thing which i miss are the respirators for the firemen since they already own air tanks but otherwise this set is brilliant i like it much more than the new one from 2007 since its not that big and juniorized klausdieter	positive
thanks for the review this set was outstanding for its time with all the features and detail the extending basket is just wonderful however i honestly wouldnt consider it the best firetruck ever i actually like the one from 2005 even better  becasue like most of the city vehicles it adds the needed bulk big engines like fire trucks need many of the older kits while awesome were honestly a little too skinny imo	positive

this sounds very similar to the first one im glad im saving this one till later in my purchasing cycle all the sw walkers have a skeletal fram with almost nothing inside its very disappointing but i guess filling them in would up the piece count considerably does this beast have any good handholds for picking it up i seem to recall a handle or something coming out of the top in the prerelease pics	negative

just picked this set up and just took a break from building to go to football practice i have just finished building all of the legs and so far it looks like it is going to be a great set i would have like it if more clones were included but whatever i find it interesting how many clone accessories they give you i dont like it only because i cant decide what i want to use i find it interesting that at lease 2 people are missing pieces i have had multiple times where i thought i was missing pieces only to find that they were in the bag somewhere other than the fact that there is a lack of minifigures i love this set and cant wait to finish it later tonight edited by swman 04 august 2008  0833 pm	positive
i bought this a few weeks ago and absolutely loved making it its amazing how the paneling comes together to make such a tight fit but can easily open up the legs could have been a bit more poseable and the guns dont launch easily unless you push hard and fast id like the firing mechanism to launch more smoothly but it looks absolutely amazing about price it was ¥13000 where i am but im used to lego being expensive in japan so it was good value	positive

the coast guard quad because i live in the netherlands and we dont have the dino attack theme we have dino 2010 which have a diffrent quad so i would like to chose the dino attack one but as i dont one him goast guard though but i also dont have the coast guard one but i like him but i also dont have the coast quard one as well greets theforce edited by theforce 01 august 2008  1118 pm	positive
 that was a weird race anyway i love the look of both sets but ill have to go for the dino attack quad for a couple of reasons it is postapoc which i love features tan and dark red colours which are far more useful than yellow you get more bang for your buck with the dino set you get a little dino sure you can hate it but better than not having one right and the fig has much more useful pieces and a better face thanks for the face off thebrickster batbrick away	positive
its definately the street sprinter for me there are many reasons for that most of which have been mentioned by others already i hate yellow its the most useless color but i love tan and dark red its bigger and more detailed than the coast guard one plus i think there is a hinge in the back of it so there is apparently some more playability to it as well i love the postapoc style fig its detailed and simply looks cool also while the digger fig has quite an individual look to it the coast guard driver has the generic hero head and coast guard uniform its an overal better deal especially if you count the ludp which gives the set a whole lot more playability no matter how u the ldp may be tan  postapoc figs on	positive
ive got to go with the town one since you have to stand on the dino one steve	positive
i vote for the dino quadbike definately i wish i had that but ill have to make do with the much less violent european version dino 2010 not attack heres a comaprison european version usa etc version theres a subtle difference but i prefer the us one as for the coast guard quad i think its ok but not as good as the new one	positive
dino attack quad for me no this isnt because i own it and not the other one but because i think just about everything is better in it  the design is better the colors are cooler and it has a better figure i dont like the figure in the coast guard quad at all  but since it was from world city im not suprised i also kinda like the dino actually its flexible and fits in with the previous dinos a lot better than the cruddy bigger ones with bright red yellow and green highlights	positive

vbbn the pics were 12 mega pixles which is quite a lot i think although i had to scale them down to 800x600 i used to dream that tlg would bring out these sets of the geonosis arena and you could join them together to make a massive arena but i doubt they would ever do that also look out for my forth coming reviews of 4500 snow speeder some tie fighter with a lul dv and gg wheel bike chase i have taken all the pics all i need to do is upload them also i would review the jango fetts slave 1 but i have customized it so much i dont really want to revert it back to its original state edited by skipper 24 02 august 2008  0718 pm	neutral

7263 tie fighter review parts 159 figs 2 price £2000 not sure my 2nd review today this set came out about the same time as the rots sets and included the first minifig to have a lul 1 box  manual this is the front of the box it has a try me slot for the lul vader a close up of the try me slot luckily i got mine form argos so no little kids have been playing around with it the manual cover im not quite sure why it has a pic of the figs on the front but it doesnt deface it so i dont mind random manual shot rots set preview at the back of the manual 2 general set and figs the contents of the set  the minifigs a normal tie pilot and the first ever lul fig dv also my only lul fig no helmets tie pilot torso the lul is made of 3 parts lighted up the led for the blade 3 the tie fighter just a pic of it cockpit with controls tie pilot sitting in the cockpit by the way the hinge brick is the wrong color it is supposed to be grey the cockpit shut i wonder why tlc never printed those cockpit glass things correctly jet out the back top plate has some nice printing 5 overall build 510 very repetitivewell the ships symmetrical minifigs 410 1 tie pilot which is okay but a lul vader he cant even fit in the ship design 610 strong but the wings are all wobbly if that makes sense i dont like the blue either parts 610 lots of blue grills thingys not much else but it got 6 because of the wings plates price 510 could have been more expensive at least it had 2 figs playability 110 cant do much as a stand alone set overall 410 there just isnt enough here it could at least have a better color scheme and instead of dv it could come with a stormie like the old one did	negative
thanks for the review i actually like the older tie better since it had a stand for the tie not really a fan of the lu figs either no matter  a tie is a tie and this is a must have fighter for any lego sw fan out there never can get enough ties except the tie advanced or vaders tiethey dont rock kimt	positive
as my summer holiday was kinda wet for 2 weeks i decided to shop some sets i crossed the german border and bought me this one mainly for the parts to get time going i built the models and made this small review for you to enjoy or hate high resolution pics can be found here when public set 4994 title fierce creatures price 999 euro  1299 usd pieces 193 minifigs 0 the box the box looks awesome it has some great animations of the 3 models in the instruction the rear of the box shows some nice upcloseandpersonal drawings of each model i think it works better having the models drawn instead of a mere photo of them somehow it allows the great colourscheme to really show the instructions the instruction is easy to follow and shows which pieces are used in each building step that makes it all a lot easier especially with so many small pieces as in this set the bricks are divided into 3 polybags and the instruction is a fine small book which can be easily stored along the rest of your evergrowing amount of booklets and pamphlets printed by tlg the models model 1 is a spider and it’s nasty the 2x2 modified brick with the hole would allow one to hang it from a string this beast is sure to give you several nightmares were it hanging from a string in your bedroom – so i wouldn’t do that plus the fact that my wife threw away the box and ordered me to take the spider apart when she saw it – she’s an arachnophobian and does not take spiders lightly it looks real in a brickishnonrealway model 2 is a snake there’s not much to say other than the head is awesomely designed and the rest is bad the body is poorly designed and does not live up to the coolness of the head build the head ignore the rest model 3 is a flying scorpion or something not as realistic as the spider but still a great model with a cool head the tail is a bit poorly designed but it’ll do and it does offer some good ideas on how to use bricks all in all verdicts this is an ok creator set it holds a lot of fine pieces and the models are an ok inspiration given its size it’s an ok set but it’s nothing more than that i’ll give it an average score i enjoyed building the models and fumbling with the bricks in the shade during a “siesta” on my vacation and that’s what it is an enjoyable build and a little inspiration on a hot day with a erdinger dunkel weissbier in my other hand kimt edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0629 pm indexed	positive
4500 rebel snow speeder review parts 214 figs 3 price £2000 edit new box pics added sorry theyre a bit blurry because of the light i took them in this is the original trilogy edition version of this set but there arent any differences to the normal one 1 manual  box the front of the ote box the minifgs on the box top the back of the box with some alternate models and overview of some of the functions the manual cover you can see it is the ote version of the set random shot 1 of 2 posters in the instructions the second poster 2 general set and minifigs the built set contents the three figs with the included weapons how i like to customize the pilots helmets luke from 4500 and luke from 10178 motorized atat the three helmets included with the set 3 turret heres the turret with the rebel gunner standing next to it the controls for the turret  the turret can rotate and tilt two fire at those pesky atat walkers i put a spider web sort of radar dish thing on like on the original 7130 to make it look more like the one from tesb 4 the speeder a front view of the speeder the pilot controls with a atat print the seats for the pilot and rear gunner the rear gunners tow cable a detailed printed plate next to the engines printed plates under the airbrake things more printed parts there is no dss with this set got tie up those walkers we might need some more tow cable  5 overall build 710 pretty symmetrical build but its fun minifigs 810 3 figs in a £20 set is pretty good i think design 910 very strong and close to minifig scale the turret could have some work though parts 810 lots of variety and includes some interesting ones such as the cockpit and rear air vent price 710 3 figs and 214 parts not to bad i guess playability 610 could be better if it came with a snow trooper overall 810 the set comes with 3 figs that only come with more expensive sets also it has a variety of different parts as well as the build being enjoyable edited by skipper 24 04 august 2008  0310 pm indexed	neutral
there isnt much difference apart form it has stickers on and is grey also the guns and tow cable gun are different as well as the engines but if you look at pictures of the hoth base speeder not to much is noticeable	neutral
i have mixed feelings about this set its one of the sets that sent my into a dark age the birth of my son contributed heavily when i first saw this set i was convinced that the earlier snowspeeder 7130 was superior in every way i liked the look of the 7130 version better i liked the coloration of it better the turret was better it used a webbed 6 x 6 dish after seeing this review i realize i was wrong on some accounts the cockpit is much more movie accurate the 7130 version had two separate compartments this version also came with a tow cable something that was lacking from the previous set while i still am unimpressed with the overall look of this set it is much less blocky which is always a good thing overall i still prefer 7130 to the 4500 version but the 4500 isnt nearly as bad as i first assumed and i regret never buying one of these when i had my chance	neutral

i really liked this set it was simple to build yet detailed and included three figures which was nice if only lego would do a few more hoth sets then we could make a real battle	positive
i had this set £15 rrp actually  and agree mostly with your review although on the wheel bike itself two legs can be placed at the front end and two at the back to enable it to roll properly boga is very juniorised and the set itself is very simple and contains many large pieces the minifigures are good though i traded my gg however  just to offer my personal thoughts build 510 minifigs 1010 parts 310 price 710 playability 1010 overall 710  not an average tk	neutral
my brother had this set and i think it isnt the best set but great minifigs could use a star corps clone or 2 from the bp	neutral
kimt on aug 3 2008 0322 pm said not one of my favourite sw sets kinda boring and the set is poorly designed imho we do get the general but thats not nearly enough thanks for the reivew and fine pics kimt gg has a capea custom cape what more do you want	negative
thanks again skipper for producing yet another review to go into the index i like this slave1 but sadly i must admit that i like the really old version better boba fetts slave1 that is even though is grossly undersized i think its better than this one belonging to his father jango kimt	neutral
that was indeed a set that never appealed to me its build was just plain wrong and awful i only bought it because i found it on clearance at around 15€ and they had 4 of them if i had known better then id have bought all 4 seeing how much that jango fett minifig is worth now  but i ended up heavily modifying it in its propoions and now it looks ok next to the new slave one which is the best one of its 3 incarnations i think	negative
i got the original jsf for christmas which i might buy and review wonderful set the obi in this one is really awesome and its really just a great ship sticker free probably my favourite id fly it if any ship from star wars maybe i should get it and the slave i from episode ii after all i like jango despite having a crap story	positive
very good review i have he newest slave i and i like it more than this one dsr	neutral
okay i have fixed that pic thanks oky wan i have modified this but then yesterday i built it back to its original state to review it	neutral
you added some decals to the jango figure right  they seem to be suffering a little i remember buying this set from the discount tent after my first visit to legoland windsor i wasnt sure whether to buy it even in their sale  but i was glad i did once id built it 	neutral
yep those decals are suffering i am going to apply some new ones now with proper paper	neutral
i really want one of these if only it wasnt expensive i probably wont buy it because itd be scraped for parts too quick great review though	neutral
good review i always wanted to know how it was different to the boba fett slave i i would probably only get this though for jango fett the newer one looks sturdier and proportioned better imo	neutral

outback desert racer gday mates today from the legolands desert down under ill be sharing an image review of outback set 6550 desert racer set  6550 theme outback year released 1997 piece count 48 minifigs 1 list price 4 usd starting with an image of the box and the back side with three alternate models instructions and decals the pieces a side view of the vehicle diagonal view one minifig and the complete set pros  price is under 5 4 usd retail  good impulse set  goes well with other outback sets  combination of yellow and green pieces  working doors and liftable top for playability cons  stickers on doors hood and 1x4 tile no printed pieces  no accessories a wrench gas can and other extras would have added to the set  no extra tire for blow outs summary i picked this set up new a number of years ago as a true impulse buy after buying one of the larger outback sets amazon crossing or outback airstrip its a neat little addition to the theme with its working doors and playability factor although i only built it once before today i would buy again if i had the opportunity hooroo for now some good aussie music to leave you with down under	positive
this set looks liek a good buy for 4 wish it was still around but like you said it needs accessories	positive
nein you rejected lul luls are awesome thanks for the review i like the set a lot mace is only featured here great fig of him too i like the grey jedi robes torso cody is great as with the other figs the tanks probably a second favourite next to the mighty atat of course	positive
did your version without the lul mace have trans blue grill things like the ones on the back of the speeder  or was my set a one off	neutral
skipper 24 on aug 4 2008 0404 pm said did your version without the lul mace have trans blue grill things like the ones on the back of the speeder  or was my set a one off i bought mine online thinking it was the new version but i ended up with that very lame lul fig i just hate that fig its completely useless we cant use any part of it for anything although i only discovered yesterday that the lightsaber blade was a standard one and not glued as i always believed so all isnt completely lost in the end i still was rather disappointed by the set its too full of holes  hum i think theres kind of a paradox in that sentence but the barc speeder and green clone are indeed fantastic oh and yes mine came with sand blue grill parts instead of the transyellow ones didnt realise it at first and i spent half an hour cursing thinking they forgot to put them in the box but in the end i dont know if the replacements are any better  since theyre supposed to represent some kind of thruster light or something all in all i think its my worst set not necessarily for the set itself which is ok but psychologically theres too many things that went wrong with it	neutral
the kid on aug 4 2008 0820 am said i got the original version of this set with the luls mace windu figure when tlc released the nonluls version i managed to swap  they sent me the new version and a clone trooper iirc and i mailed them back the old version this was a great set the suspension worked great and it rolled magnificently nice review with good photos but again your price is a little off £6999 is the rrp unless the price you paid was £80 tk that was a great idea i never even thought to send it back and get the new one with the other clone and the non lul windu	positive

i built mine today as soon as i tried to put it in attack position the thingy rotates the wrong way and it falls apart what a waste of 55	negative
i love this set and i gave it outstanding i might note though that the cylinder is just there as a dampener when disenegaged the wing function still works just not as smoothly interestingly though the cylinder is an old piece i have a few others its just that this is the first time its been used without a spring i had no problems assembling this set	positive
im not normally that big into trains but this set has a real coolness factor that sets it apart from most of the others the color scheme is the same one that amtrak and many local subway systems use i picked it up along with the club car expansion when they were rereleased in 2001 i have made various modifications to mine rearranging the car layouts and adding a second train motor into the rearmost car along with another set of lights so that both ends light up as you said it would be great to have an 8stud version of this so you could fit in two rows of seats side by side that might make a nice mod project at some point	positive
outstanding train set the legend of the entire train series is the metroliner this is a super 5 set the color design minifigs is just so perfect and lovely it resemble the trains which we see on our rails in our daily life i cant find any flaws on this at all the only flaw i noticed is my mistake of not able to buy this set at all in fact i had never seen this set in the shops before in my entire life thebrickster on aug 5 2008 0923 am said how cool is that and 11 minifigs  when was the last time lego included 11 figs in a single set there is another set fufil the criteria above which is also a well known legend it has 12 minifigs which is the 10159 city airport aka century skyway airport	positive
ahh the good old train theme how i wish tlg would make such great trains today now that the quality of city sets has improved so much that really brings back memories even if i didnt have this one but a cargo train that came out about the same time period maybe plus a few years i dont have any trains myself at the moment mostly because im afraid i havent got enough space to put in on display with all the rails and stuff	positive

nice review hinckley i just got mine as well by paying quite a high price for it since its exclusive to us however i had not opened it yet and i left it in my friends car i gave it for an above average for that cool little jeep for an exclusive brickmaster set this is certainly one of the best vehicles i had ever seen i like its construction built if this is ever released in the main stream i am sure it will be a hit to get a small sized indiana jones set	positive
thanks for this great review hinckley i agree with you this set has to be released as normal set i just recognized how clever the building technique is you couldnt see that on the packaging shots we got before hopefully im able to grab this off ebay or somewhere else sometime	positive
surprisingly well designed set for lego overlords i mean brickmasters	positive
thanks for the good review  i can´t wait for mine to arrive and just think how close paulc was in his reverse building of this which turned into a event exclusive in billund  he was just wrong on the color of the headlight bricks black instead of frown and the rear bumper stuff which couldn´t be seen on the bag picture kudos paulc as for my badass patrol car and the sop standard operation procedure of cavity searches there´s more to see here over at brickzone  here´s a teaser copmike	positive
this is by far my favourite outback series set i loved the fact that you can bend the bridge in different directions so that the suspension of the car really worked to keep the car levelled like you placed it in your last picture i had lots of fun with this when it came out eleven years ago in 1997 the bridge scene could also be used in the adventurers serie of 1998 classic highest rating buy it if you dont already have it	positive
great review brickster why exactly did the outback adventure etc themes never quite catch onjust a thought what a great set i wish i had it but in 1997 i was just back from my whirl wind trips around the world and had drifted away from lego i dont know why but i will say this i love the actual suspension that came with this set and the trains sets i have been trying to buy up as much of it as i can and now i see i need to add one more set to the i need to get that	positive

tks for the review once more jay  i totally agree with you jay  this set has very nice details suche as the mini gun movable ladder green barrels and great figs  however it is very expensive for what it is and i dont think there are that many very usefall parts in there  well i could use those treads  if i ever buy this set its really not for the design which i totally dislike	positive

this is my first review so i thought the smaller the set the better 6626 snowmobile year 2000 subtheme arctic pieces 20 1 extra note polybag 6577 is the boxed version price €1  sh on ebay misp mint in sealed polybag building time less than 2 minutes if it came out in the last months if would be called an impulse set it actually came out a few years ago being those my dark years i missed the arctic line now that im back into business i wanted some but not all of the sets were good or easily available i had the chance to buy this one and i0m happy with it as you can see below it consists of a figure on a scooter the only accessories are those chainsaws that lie on the sides unless you take the skis from the scooter and have the minifig wear them the extra piece is a transyellow 1x1 round plate according to brickset and peeron the difference between box and polybag is the sticker sheet you choose whether the nose is better with or without the sticker id say with the judgement its cheap it has a cool minifig with a cool head accessory and a nice torso i dont think i like that orange colour that much and i cant understand why those blue pieces have to be blue i guess its beacuse the whole line uses blue with orange but i have to say this is definetely a good set id give it a 4 out of 5 in its category if you want to own at least a set per every theme this could be your arctic one packaging content minifig i hear you ask whats that yellow thing on the left leg dust or something alike the snowmobile edited by the cobra 07 august 2008  0233 pm	neutral
here we are my first clone wars set and my first star wars review here we have the wonderful droid gunship one of the cheaper of the clone wars sets this set is exclusive to walmart and its one of the better exclusives out there im looking at you twilight  first off we have a shot of the entire set with the box a random page shot along with pics of the parts list the build is split up into three sections the back the cockpit and the missles the back has a lot of nice dark blue plates and is the only part of the set which uses stickers the bottoms shows various technic systems which ill get to later the cockpit has many details mostly guns and the rotating guns are a nice touch the cockpit can fit a battle droid but not a minifig im not sure why a droid would want leather though the last part is loading this baby with the missles there are four blacksmall and two dark bley large missles which are loaded in groups of three as sls the middle mechanism is for the missiles and the back part with the bionicle teeth are used ad landing gear the knob on top turns to release the missiles on the clones  leftover bits and the used ssnot so d this time around the gunship versus a time traveling agent charge  overall build 810 a basic build but at some points repetitive minifigs 1010 just your basic droids you cant go wrong design 710 a basic design with some interesting techniques pieces 910 a mix of old and new pieces along with the return of this lovely piece which hasnt been seen for almost 10 years price 810 30 for a gunship ill take it final verdict 810 a great price for a small set like this and it has a great bit of swooshability	positive

wow and people complain that a military type line would be to violent here we have half dead soilders and a space shuttle bombing people with severed skeleton heads i have to say this is the first time ive heard of this theme i like the colors as most have pointed out the base plate is preety cool two could use it to moc up some garages	positive
i am a proud owner of this set like others i got it discounted and couldnt resit the parts pack this is the type of lego sets that bothers me when you look at it now youd be tempted to say hey not bad but at the same time some years ago it wasnt good enough to buy it full price i was kinda disappointed because usually sets using that kinda baseplates are excellent castle paradisa and this one is just ok one really minus point would be the lack of any opponent faction in the set	negative
thats it thanks for the review but now you make me want to build my own one thanks a lot on a more serious note i really like this set and have always wished to aquire it i have two broken tie interceptors so this should be a easy build and as someone in the pirate forum i think said it would be a great baseplate for building cave to hide the booty thanks pmg and welcome	positive
another outstanding review by the awesome set reviewer i enjoyed reading this review very much and i felt that you have redress twilight in an approriate manner i have very mixed feeling about this set especially with its design it seemed i will need to watch the clone wars movie in the theatre before i compared with it most of the time when this lego set is used in a movie you will tend to compare it and what is the actual purpose for twilight same as the rest of the sw vehicles and aircraft for a high price like this i can actually top up a little more and get the atte with the same batch of minifigs plus commander rex if there is a special figure such as the v19 torrent clone pliot it will be a much ideal scenario at the moment i have not bring in any clone war sets into my collection and i am quite sure twilight is not in my priority list especially when i am not a fullpledged star war collectors or i have strong intentions to complete the entire range in this recent release therefore i need to prioritise my purchase and likely to get two rgs since that is my favourite ship in clone war era i am not comparing it with rgs both sets defintely have their pros and cons oh i love that postcard you made certainly looks very nice sveltecorps thanks for doing up this superb detailed review which had given twilight the neccessary attention it should have	neutral
darkrebellion on aug 12 2008 1217 pm said i like this ship even if it looks so bulky but i need to buy first other sets so maybe this beast will be landing in my collection the next year or this one if i am lucky  i can just ask for something can you post a pic of all your clone wars sets together with this one all the sets in one pic not many pics with this an each set  please  i think a lot of people feel the same way  there was so much good stuff to get in the first wave that this is probably a backburner set for a lot of people and some are probably waiting to see the movie to see how prominently it features i will try and take a pic with some other cw sets i dont have all of them though and some need to be reassembled as i built them on holiday and then had to pack them away i do think this line of sets has been the best sw lego wave released though all of the recent releases have been amazing in their own way	neutral
wow certainly much bigger than i would have thought thanks for the great review and pictures  well for some reason i was drawn to this set but with the lack of interior and quite a bit of technics i think ill pass or at least get the atte first thanks again	neutral
hopewell on aug 11 2008 1124 pm said i read the visual guide recently and learned a bit more about the twilight i wont get into spoilers but it seems that the ship becomes a sort of endearing family van for the characters which is neat big bulky uncool but it gets you from one place to another if it factors into more than just the 90 minute film i may pick this up it seems that theres room for a lot of personality in this ship once you see the film it is a corellian freighter smuggling spice for the hutts thats cool right lol the minivan of the galaxy  what a selling point if i am really impressed with it in the film i suppose that would change things but i will have to see 	positive
thanks for yet another awesome review quote seems like tlc has done a pretty accurate representation of the ship the real fault for the ships messy design has to go to lucasfilm not tlc my guess is lucasfilm is trying to recapture that what a piece of junk magic of the millennium falcon i guess well have to wait to see the movie to see if they succeeded or not this sums up my opinion exactly i can easily admit that the design of the kit is spot on  but unfortunately the actual design of the ship in the new movie is garbage actually despite the millennium falcons odd design i really think its a pretty appealing ship  and its really cool i cant say the same for the twilight though	negative

i think some people agree that this ship is better than when we first saw those pictures at least i do it looks like it has some nice accessories that come with the ship as well my favorite of you custom things has got to be the octopus its so funny and a great use for the headdress thing great review edited by skipper 24 13 august 2008  1124 am	positive
time for another of the great castle sets and yes this one is a great army builder set as well d set 7090 set title crossbow attack price 529 euro  599 usd pieces 54 release 2007 the box and as the other two sets reviewd so far 7009 and 5615 this one has a fitting box that is too easily snatched from the shelf and put into your shopping cart  not sure its a great thingtoo expensive in the end d the crossbow attack cart the cart is a neat little build that actually works and for once were not given that awful technic launcher but a buildit launcher it actually works just fine for its purpose the addition of two crossbows makes it worth buying never can get enought weapons for the evergrowing crownie army the figs oddly ive not taken any pics of the figs and therefore ill illustrate using the sh pic the figs are great i love the silver helmets and in this set you get 2 crownies and a skeleton plus a white skeleton horse thats a lot of figs for a set this size a true army builder thumbs up for that the all in all verdict another small yet super set in the castle theme i bought several of these to make a fine little army its cheap and often found on sale i can hardly resist buying it when i see it kimt	positive
hard to find in italian shops i had a friend buying one for meas soon as the set was available i always wanted another one so while in switzerland see kimts 7009 review for the full story i bought two for 5 €uros you get two knights a skeleton and a skeleton horse some hand weapons and a shooting device please remember dont aim at the eyes just great	positive
and another set enters the scene set 7009 set title the final joust price 829 euro  799 usd pieces 62 release 2007 the box and yet again tlg has put the bricks in a box that somehow corresponds with the amount of bricks in it the castle theme has got well designed boxes  the whole set build 2 knights jousting fence and weapon rack the weapons rack another great addition of weapons flail halberd and skeleton scimitar super weapons for those close encounter melee battles fought when tipped off the horse  grinp the jousting fence not much to say its a fence simple yet it serves its purpose very well the crown knight gotta love that guy he looks like nothing can hurt him he even got a selfsufficient smile on his face im sure hes convinced that no skeleton can defeat him also the horse its barding and the headcover looks awesome a great old school sword and the ever cool normannic shield what could possibly go wrong for this knight the helmet i really love imo its a lot better than the old knight helmets see review of 5615 the knight for a pic of one of those the skeleton knight the black skeleton horse rocks i love that design and in black its even badder than than the white version the shield reeks of dread and the knight is one bad skeleton on the rampage i do find that the helmet is a little off id rather have a black knights helmet instead the kk helmet doesnt really do it for me the all in all verdict this is another great army builder set it holds a lot of great weapons some cool minifigs and great pieces the only thing that puzzles me is why would a crown knight joust a skeleton doesnt really make sense kimt	positive
lovely set nice collection of weapons cool horseaccesoires for the white knight cool black skeletal horse on the dark knights side loving the printed armours of both knights and as opposed to kimt apparently i really dig the black helmet i feel theres a lord of the ringsflavour to it with those curves well designed	positive
i should really get one more of these for the figures shields and weapons this set is the only one with the scythe in pearlgrey by the way the only thing that puzzles me is why would a crown knight joust a skeleton good question for a joust to make sense this set should contain two human knights instead  which would be fine with me so long as they had differing armour and colours edited by tenorikuma 13 august 2008  0351 am	neutral
kimt on aug 13 2008 0500 am said the quality of the set feel free to comment on the review andor set also thanks  the set is average its useful for picking up a few knights but im not really partial to the skeleton the idea of a knight and a skeleton tilting just strikes me as being odd my biggest issue with the current castle line is that most sets force you to purchase a mixture of skeletonsknights orcsknights orcsdwarves etc this is fine for those of you who love your fantasy however it makes the line a bit underwhelming for the rest of us still as mentioned earlier the set does have an upside so it is worth a purchase the review on the other hand is aces with great photos and a detailed description of the set and its contents nice work	neutral
tenorikuma on aug 13 2008 0348 am said i should really get one more of these for the figures shields and weapons this set is the only one with the scythe in pearlgrey by the way except its just plain darkgrey you must have gotten this set mixed with another though ive never heard of a pearlgrey scythe	neutral

indexed name holiday villa theme lego system  town year 1988 pieces 197 minifigs 2 price usd  there were quite a few sets in the 1980s that werent sold in the us i remember reading once that it was because they contained wine glasses and tlg felt they wouldnt be able to market a toy that encourage the drinking of alcohol this set was one of them i remember seeing this in a catalog that came with a fabuland set and wondering what it was and where i could get one i wrote to lego and got an overseas catalog which had the futuron 6990 monorail transport system in it before it was available in the us i was amazed i ended up buying 6349 holiday villa from that catalog but for some reason gave it to my best friend for his birthday ive always wanted this set and finally bought it from bricklink this year my purchase included everything except the box i really like the boxes but in lieu of a boxshot here is the instruction manual i imagine this was the image on the front of the box the parts one of the things that appealed to me about this set is its abundance of rare parts this base plate is an excellent piece and was only available in two sets classic lego telephone technically these blue windows 1 x 4 x 5 windows are only available in this set according to bricklink it was available in different form with and without fixed glass trans blue glass in other sets regardless this size and color window is rare and the blue door was only available in 4 sets this was a huge selling point for me as im a window monkey never heard that term its like a parts monkey a collector who buys mulitples of sets just for parts or large lots of bulk from bl and sorts them into bins but just for windows tell your friends i coined the term these sloped windows have endless possibilities in many themes maybe not with the curtain decals applied but are another great rare part that appears in this set the build remember this piece id like to see a badass agents car built on this car base  i am a fan of the sixwide car but i see the appeal of the four wide it has a very nostalgic feel to it theres no denying that this is a beauty of classic lego 4wide cars this set comes with two minifigures one of which appears to be a painter classic vintage lego figs onto the house which begins with the basic floorplan a kitchen thats open to the rest of the house and a little oven and hood vent is one of my favorite touches its one thing to throw an oven into a house set but the designer of this set made it a cool part of the architecture of the house which gives it a unique feel the completed first floor and carport i do wish the sides of the roof were white with a little overhang like an actual roof this method of white on bottom red on top looks more like a childs drawing than a real house this is easily fixed with some modifying still you get a lot of roof pieces in this set here we have the completed set the husband cleans the yard while the wife gets plastered on wine dont tell the american kids another angle working in the kitchen getting smashed before dinner i think she may have a serious problem the bedroom a little stark but the bed looks comfy overall shot of the interior rating playability 910 the possibilities are endless with drunky mcwinewine and husband really playability is up to the imagination of the player its a house not really very actionpacked design 9510 great design with plenty of rare parts love the classic car too loses half a point for the all red roof price na i believe this was inexpensive but since i have no proof i will have to leave this factor out of the overall rating overall 92510 classic sets like this all deserve 10s in my book but looking at it with an objective eye its excellent but not perfect	positive
this looks like a really great set i wasnt around in 88 to get it but i like it it actually has things inside the interior thanks for the review hinckley on aug 13 2008 0611 pm said there were quite a few sets in the 1980s that werent sold in the us hooray sort of in england we dont get in normal shops batman and spongebob sets and not at all  avatar sets and brickmaster but america gets all of these maybe its revenge for americas lego neglect in the 80s hinckley on aug 13 2008 0611 pm said i remember reading once that it was because they contained wine glasses and tlg felt they wouldnt be able to market a toy that encourage the drinking of alcohol this set was one of them they didnt want to encourage the drinking of alcohol in america but were fine encouraging it in other places maybe thats why my country has such a big problem with binge drinking or maybe not	positive
thats a great review of a great set hinckley i voted for outstanding  this set is simply amazing i regrettably dont own this set since its very hard to find on ebay andor the stickers are missing but nevertheless i hope that i one day will be able to get this awesome set  or even better  see tlg releasing a new city villa in a style similar to that brilliant set  klausdieter edited by klausdieter 13 august 2008  0630 pm	positive

i wish i could find this set some day including the right baseplate some of my house mocs are styled after the classic 6349 and sometimes ive rebuilt it after instruction scans exchanging the baseplate i dont own one of these with 2 at 16x32 each and this city house out of an older thread of mine its offensive that ive used styling elements of 6349s just enlarged in terms of interior details not much but still enough for classic town i voted outstanding mfg widdi edited by widdi 09 october 2008  0122 am	positive

i think the set is too unrealistic i like the new resq sets better and im somewhat a lifeboat freak so im always following such a sets with interest i would like to see some rigit inflatable boats some day  but about the chopper i like the accessoiries	negative
metalandi on aug 24 2008 0417 pm said what exactly makes you feel this set isnt realistic since the question was asked 1 tiny rotors 2 dual cockpits only seen on a few military copters 3 stretcher extends beyone edges of fuselage when inside the vehicle 4 extra long canopy really only seen on military helicopters and military design 5 black colorscheme for rescue vehicle the the stretcher minifig designs and rescue logo are the only things about this copter that really suggest that it is a civilian rescue aircraft its a toy set with alot of play value but i agree with karto that these kind of desgins really turned me off to alot of the town and city sets of the 90s on the positive side the new city sets with thier realistic nonfuturistic designs have really tempted me to buy more vehicles	neutral
this is one of my favourite sets i remember getting it in tesco soon after it was released those were the days the resq line was good and this set made it better	positive
well i for one really like this set it has to be one of the nicer ribbies that tlg has made tons of playability and nice options for redesign great set overall thanks for the review	positive
6004 crossbow cart review because i may start collecting castle here is a review of one of my few castle sets please note i hurriedly put his together meaning some parts are the wrong color look out for them this review will also be done in my star wars review style the lighting is also particularly bad in the pics on with the review parts 20 figs 1 price  1overview and fig the whole set the fright knights knight the disemboweled knight the head printing is just longer then the helmet visor 2 the cart the cart has 3 crossbows and 2 norman type shields the carts advanced defense and weapons systems all the parts from the cart forgot to add the fig in 3extras  overall here are all my castle figs remember i dont collect castle yet  oh yeah i forgot to put one of the old skellies and a ghost on there could a castle fan tell me if any of these minifigs are rare i have no idea because i dont collect castle build 610 pretty standard for a impulse minifigs 710 nice minifig with lots of accessories design 810 this set made way for some of the new castle carts of similar size parts 1010 3 crossbows 2 shields arrow quiver and spear as well as cool minifg in a 20 piece set price 1010 well i dont know but lego was cheaper in 97 so it gets 10 playability 55 pretty much standard for a impulse set overall 810 good parts and price as well as minifig scores this set an 8 thanks for reading	positive
very nicely done  this cart is a striking resemblance to the crossbow cart we got in 2007	positive
thanks for the review ive added it to the index im not a fan of this theme but i have to say that this is a neat little set that does hold some good things figs and weapons are always welcome and one can never have to many wheels so i rate this average	neutral
this is a pretty nice set i really like the torso and its genericness so it can be used for other factions and at least this set has 2 shields althought i prefer the triangular ones instead of just 1 shield you get from crossbow attack from the wrong fraction id have liked a crown knights shield 100x better some improvements for this set would be a normal bow and a sword instead of 2 of the 3 crossbows smaller wheels and triangular shields 45 from me actually 35 but ill round it up	positive
this is really an ideal small set in spite of its size it has nearly everything • three minifigs • a vehicle • a building • numerous minifig accessories • numerous rare and useful parts • nice model design especially for the time period too bad outback came out during my dark years	positive
this is probably my alltime favorite lego set it was originally given to me for my birthday by a close friend of mine back in the release year of 1997 the cargo plane was by far my favorite vehicle ever unfortunately someone stole the plane from me when our families went on vacation and the rest of the set was given to my cousins oldest son when i was no longer interested in my lego collection now that im back into lego i use that buildings construction for various projects especially as a dr inferno lookout shack using parts from extra mission 3 swamp raid the shack compliments the original set greatly edited by skorpius47 19 august 2008  0144 am	positive
legoman132 on aug 18 2008 0936 pm said this was a cool set i thoght of it as i was building the post plane interesting thought i have the post plane but i havent opened it yet i suppose its the yellow the plane in this set is much different than most of the other classic town airplanes in that it has the double tail section heres a shot of the new 7732 air mail set  definately a nice set	positive

set 7103 theme star wars set name jedi duel pieces 74 release 2002 price 10 usd minifigs 2 count dooku and yoda links 7103 brickshelf folder bricklink reference catalog peeroncom introcomment i remember getting this set solely because i collect star wars as i rebuild it and took pics of it i found that i actually like this set for different reasons dookus speeder is pretty cool and the lightsabre rocks the dooku minifig is also great whats not so great is the flythingy and getting another yoda though thats kinda hard not to get in a set focused on their duel you cant see the wires because they digitally removed them be careful or ill digidally remove your head  steven seagal i hope i quoted that one right  so to get the review on the move ill impress you all with a box picture neat huh one of the smaller boxes but still kinda big when consider that you only get 74 pieces and 2 minifigs the instruction isnt that big as i said the dooku minifigs is awesome i love the print on his torso that combines the brown cape with the torso and also the head is neatly designed not a fleshie though this was before the fleshlicensefacelift a sideview of the light blue speeder mmmm that crome light sabre hilt is nice the design of the speeder is also ok and without the usual offcolourscheme bricks no tan or yellow sticking out there yeah id panic too if this came right at mewho wouldnt when noones driving and a rear shot i think the design is a little off the shields makes it all a little too open in my opinion the printed bricks are a kick and thus evens the score here this hideous design is meant to flip yoda around the air put him in this funfair from hell thing and give him a twister he and dooku will never forget my guess is that its there to add some playability but its just odd and quite useless much like the playability soccer thingies in the ultimate light sabre duel the verdict ups and downs this set offers both i rate it as average since the size and price of the set make it acceptable to have odd things confused good so am i making a small set isnt that easy and remeber this set is from 2002 and a lot has happended since then designwise that is what do you think	positive
you think its not a great thing that we get a yoda fig in an affordable set like this that was the main reason why i got this set and what do you mean by another wasnt this the only one that was ever released except for the one in the dagobahxwing set sure he is not the best fig with the unmovable legs and all but still its yoda besides he doesnt move his legs a lot in real life either nice review though and thanks for telling me what that liftarmthingy was meant to be for i never got that and thought it was supposed to lift up the speeder for some reason i got two of this set and the printing on those blue parts were off in the second one i got edited by oky wan kenobi 18 august 2008  0845 pm	positive

cheers for the review kimt of the initial episode ii lego releases this set was the least inspiring but the minifigs were musthaves you cant go wrong with count dooku and yoda i like the design of dookus speeder in the movie but lego missed the mark a bit with it here and gave him a dodgy flying boat instead the speeder cradleyoda jumping mechanism was just a waste of parts unfortunately id like to see dookus speeder reimagined by lego theyve come a long way in the way they design a lot of the new star wars sets	neutral
i know we have another review of this set but since i just got it i thought i would share my comments on it set name droid gunship platform number 7678 pieces 329 price 2999 before we begin i will say that i like having a droid gunship but i still hope we get a maf hmp droid gunship maf droid gunship on to the review here we have the box it is really shiny and smooth and fits the sets size okay it has a clean bright look and is truley outstanding the back of the box which has the features of the set as well as the other three cw sets the contents the siticker sheet no to bad and the stickers have clear backs which is always nice instructions here we have the figstwo new droids and one older armed droid for the cockpit and the extra parts the build starts with the flat base pretty simple the bottom the side lasers next is the head it starts pretty soild the side buble laser turrets loveing the detail on the ship the lid and eyes the finished cockpit cozy interior would have had more room if it were the maf though the front landing gear simple and effective the back landing gear the rockets the clips are annoying but it make the rockets work so i guess it was nessecary mounted on the bottom not very secure but thats why they are meant to be dropped on the clones the finished ship  let me say that the droid gunship is a nice set indeed final rating 86 hope you enjoyed the review please if you have a ny questions pic requests etc then by all means ask best regards vbbn	neutral

when i first saw this review title i thought it said rapid river review thinking it was an indian set 6766 nice review though i never got into rock raiders i would have loved the large drill bit piece for set s 4970 and 4940 this set looks like a little boulder hawler and a nice set to introduce someone unfamilar with the theme i esp like the fig and the little 2x2 drill bit tile the overall set looks like it has some very useful miningtype pieces nice review and thanks for sharing	neutral
thanks for the review rock raiders was one of the last new themes i knew as a kid before my dark ages came unfortunately i never managed to get any sets from it beside a few months ago the 4910 the hover scout which i review a while ago wish i can get some of the bigger sets in the future	neutral
i do like the set although i dont own it i do remember lusting after it when i was a kid though mainly because of the female minifig and the colors its a bit simplistic but comes with a few great parts you also did a great job on describing the set and the pictures give the full impression of the appearance for the review i just have to point out a few things to give you constructive criticism first of all its chef not chief entirely different professions and secondly the scale you give in the poll isnt very even above average jumps to outstanding which is a too big of a gap in my opinion you shouldve used good or great in between them but these are only minor faults this is a good review anyway	neutral
thanks to all of you whom had showed great liking towards to one of my favourite childhood sets fluyt on aug 24 2008 0636 pm said i hope i still have all the pieces from mine unfortunately my stickers are in pretty bad shape took them off because i needed the bricks stupid stickers covering multiple parts  only downside to this set flyut if you need decals for the stickers that are featured in this set hang around here until imperialshadows drop by to give you a little surprise if he is free sandy on aug 24 2008 0733 pm said for the review i just have to point out a few things to give you constructive criticism first of all its chef not chief entirely different professions and secondly the scale you give in the poll isnt very even above average jumps to outstanding which is a too big of a gap in my opinion you shouldve used good or great in between them but these are only minor faults this is a good review anyway sandy i appericate your constructive comments in order to improve the quality of my review i had amended the word chief to chef you might want to check it i did not notice that i was using the wrong word as for the poll definitions which have been used for 1 to 5 we used poor to represent value 1 while outstanding to represent value 5 we need to use clear definitions to illustrate and demostrate nonbias towards the review for the readers to cast their vote depending on their individual liking therefore we used a common word which is known as average in surveys for measuring its sample sizes liking we have to use words which is neutral such as strongly agree agree neutral disagree strongly disagree thats why we used this rating approach to represent the terms the cobra on aug 24 2008 0737 pm said i rate it a full 5 too and i wish lego would make a set like this in 2010 a town needs pizza edit dont always trust peeron sometimes they miss some pieces and sometimes they just cant count them i am hoping to see a pizza outlet again maybe in 2010 well peeron can sometimes be not very accurate but it can served as a very useful guide in most areas	neutral

hi everyone this is my first review on lego sets here hope you guys like it and i would like to apologise for the bad quality pictures hope you guys dont mind first i will start with the box art box art i guess this is the first time that lego star wars sets use white and blue colour for their box i like the new colour scheme a nice blend though heres the front the back not to waste space on the box lego do some advertisement to attract us to buy more sets grinthe more the side at the top side there is this minifigs scale picture it is great as we get to know the real size of a minifigs contents the contents consist of a sticker sheet instruction book and 8 packet of bricks the packer are not numbered but it is ok as there is not much pieces instruction book and random page as usual the instruction book have brick checklist other sets pictures and tutorial on how you should assemble your set i mean the very first page sticker sheet there is not much sticker sheet and is a great news that the republic logo on the round plate is printed unlike republic gunship anyway i didnt apply the stickers the commander gear this is a new thing to minifigs as well well is like batman accessories they pack it in one small packet however you only get one commander gear pack in this set anyway i didnt use them the minifigs well we get the the new minifigs the ugly face clone new printed torso and new mold of helmet however i not really like the new head stud i prefer a black one or at least the one like jango fett black colour with face the helmet everything is printed no holes at the visor there but there are hole on the both side this new helmet mold also made the headgear turn 360 degree freely without helmet with helmet you can see the flesh tone at the hole beside the blasters  short blasters were given instead of long one is great at least they give us two blasters instead of one the tank here is the pics of the tank it was not badly design nor nicely design but it looks great if you didnt saw the beneath or under the tank view from front view from side view from back whats beneath under it was 4 wheels to make it move fluently it is made by the thread supporter like the one we fet from tie crawler or battank the functions well firstly you can open up the hood i guess to see the engine secondly the side cannon that can move upwards the thing is quite tight see random instruction page and there is barrier to block the cannon from going downwards the cockpit well the cockpit is small and the space is limited the monitor stuff is printed brick and is another great news you have to remove the piece pic below to reveal the cockpit and put your clone to pilot it popup gunner mechanism well the backdoor have a thing to attack to the seat of the gunner the top hatch is very loose so it there is a clone as a gunner and you open the back door the clone will popup and automatically open the hatch on top this is how the top looks like without a clone there is this movable cannon upwards left and right and a little keyboard thing with it but the cannon fall off quite easily the flick launching missile mechanism the mechanism is on both side and you need to turn the thing inwards to reveal the flick fire mechanism below are the pic of how it is turned you can keep you blaster at the front of the side there are place for you to store them it close nicely completion this is how it looks like extra parts there quite a number of them overall this set is not bad the price is quite expensive but you will like it the popup mechanism is something new to me but this set have more function and 2 clone trooper with a pack of commander gear pros 2x clone troopers high playability nice design cons a little expensive sticker sheet cannon on top falls off quite easy edited by kimt 27 august 2008  1216 pm	positive
yes the review is great indeed i love indepth reviews with tons of photos as for the set  im not planning to buy it but it looks ok i think its a good tank	neutral
nice review i hope i can get this set as well as agents city  other sw stuff and nice pics i didnt think they were bad i thought they were pretty good	neutral
mattzitron on aug 13 2005 1130 pm said the strange thing is for the first time i can remember the minifigs came decapitated and theres no neckwear i recall jake saying something about it being new lego policy to supply the minifig heads and torsos separately what with the expensestrimming and all its apparently one of the many little quirky things theyve discovered in the manufacturing and packaging process that people have done for years without thinking in this case putting the heads on the torsos but that turns out to be a surprisingly significant expense timewise i suppose think it was in one of his blog posts but not sure too tired ie lazy to go hunting for it now sorry 	neutral
but does this mean that they add to the piece count is it a super secret clever way to make the piece count seem bigger than it is hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm  addition ive built it review up later tonite but heres this to wet your appetite	negative
mattzitron you have done well to display images of the dung stain hull its a darn shame that it cant be extended however i see no reason why lego couldnt produce a special middle hull piece that is compatible although the way theyve made the hull is a bit stupid the old system was a lot more flexible better still why cant lego design a hull that can be extended in length and width then they could be as made as long or wide as desired and that would be great	negative
they have made a special middle piece in this 4 set httpwwwbricksetaspxset70751 the only problem is that its red	negative
good work samsta no wonder i wasnt aware 4 pirates and all	positive
im interested in the scan of the back i have an idea for a new avatar 	positive
that explains why it isnt in our local stores i also got it from sh but my box hasnt got the special edition printing on it surprisingly	neutral
metalandi on aug 27 2008 0750 pm said that explains why it isnt in our local stores i also got it from sh but my box hasnt got the special edition printing on it surprisingly just like dwarves mine is exclusive to target holodoc on aug 28 2008 0416 am said nice review vbbn i stumbled upon your yellow seat as well didn´t you have one already or what made you think it´s new the big letdown on this set is the big canopy i would have preferred single bricks for that and for this truck there is no real need for a hollow canopy  it could as well have been made of solid bricks maybe we get another set with different use of the canopy this is one of the reasons i didn´t buy it so far and i´m especially not interested in another forklift i have plenty of those i agree it´s the best one we have seen so far though thanks i have a yellow seat but i just thought it was interesting as for the canopy it really looks good on the finished truck i like it and that forklift could be the official one and the rest could become parts	positive
nice work vbbn im not really into technic myself but youve definately done a fine review on this set funny that it actually fits a minifig perhaps well see fans design forklifts with technic and having it minifig sized	positive
that´s really a sweet and charming little technic set thanks for that fine review	positive
nice review the figure fitting inside is great i think the price might be a little high but you did get it from tru so what else is to be expected	neutral
a very original and perhaps even a little weird design indeed but nice and creative for sure thanks for that good review	positive
thanks for the review ill add it to the index the ywing is one of my favourite rebel fighters and this set justifies the coolest fighter	positive
great review the ywing is an awesome starfighter and the detail in this set is superb funnily enough i was just swooshing mine today edited by pedro 27 august 2008  0825 pm	positive
kimt on aug 27 2008 1041 pm said you mean swooshing as in swooshing for real or just plain swooshing he doesnt know the story but those pics of you swooshing it naked sure are halarious the one in the park is extra good you should see peoples faces i mean they are jelaous of your ywing yoda has my email p hehe staudie	neutral
stauder on aug 27 2008 0945 pm said he doesnt know the story but those pics of you swooshing it naked sure are halarious the one in the park is extra good you should see peoples faces i mean they are jelaous of your ywing yoda has my email p hehe actually i had read of the naked swooshing before but alas my ywing swooshing was in my workplace where its generally accepted that you keep your clothes very much on its a completely different story when im at home though	neutral
csiquet on aug 29 2008 0206 am said i was not talking about the looks of course the rebels have got to have nicer looking ships dont aregue with him when it comes to ywings he offerd to swoosh one in the nude stauder	neutral
siegfried on 04 september 2011  0927 am said please check the date prior to asking questions in old topics three years ago in this case its rude to expect people to answer questions like that especially since its such a generic question besides how is he supposed to answer the question without knowing a lot more about the new ywing sorry	negative
i think it is a fair to ask questions here with the expectation of a new ywing in the coming year i came here to look at the review even though it is a few years old no images to go with the review bummer id like to see a more friendly tolerance on dated threads being bumped	neutral
fallenangel309 on 19 september 2011  0201 am said again we know next to nothing about the new ywing it wouldnt be possible to say whether 7658 is worth the money relative to the new one until we know what the new one looks like what its minifigures look like how much it will cost etc also note that yodalikespie has been banned is that a threat is it fair to ban someone on the forum because they revived an old thread and made inquiries thought this was a forum to discuss lego and that is what he was prompting i dont really care why he was banned but this isnt the only time ive seen this type of behavior and discourse here on eb	negative
fallenangel309 on 19 september 2011  0343 am said not a threat at all  i was simply pointing out that yodalikespie made the mistake of inquiring about the new ywing before we had any information on it to my understanding its not so much the fact that he bumped the thread as the fact that he bumped it for no good reason im not certain where the moderators stand on this issue but i feel that yodalikespies question would have been better received had he posed it after a substantial amount of information had been gathered on 9495  as ive said there simply isnt much one can go off of at this point to determine its value relative to 7658 roger that sad that the original review pics arent available any longer would be nice once the new set is released for comparisons	neutral
thanks for sharing this review with us ill add it to the index one of my favourite impulse sets along with the troll warrior or is that orc warrior	positive
thanks for that good review vbbn that´s really a fine and pretty solid looking mecha i think that the designers did a good job on this last wave of ef sets and the inclusion of these mini robots was also a pretty smart idea	positive
this was my first exo force set and i was quite skeptical towards the mecha theme so i got it because it seemed to have nice parts it turned out however that the mechas are quite nice  i really like the poseability of it and since then i got another ef set	positive
since my last post ive had the chance to build the tiger and i was surprised in a good way a much better set than i actually thougth front	positive
what do you mean the troll’s should outnumber the crown knight how are you going to manage that well here’s the answer theme castle set name troll warrior set number 5618 number of pieces 19 figures1 released 2008 list price £250 gbp 350 usd 299 euro 5618 peeroncom 5618 bricklink catalog 5618 shop at home lets us begin with the box the troll warrior and his might cart set sets for children to pester for at christmas now for what’s inside the contents of the box it doesn’t look like much now for the troll himself i’m glad they selected this troll torso rather than the other one for the impulse set i think this one is the superior one also he comes well armed with a spear and sword but no shield sadly someone really needs to look at the rodent problem in the castle sets now the cart nice easy construction as with all impulse sets i’m still not convinced by the flicking missiles a line of those would do some damage what an oncoming army can expect to see all together now and it looks rather good so there we have it a cheap way of bolstering the troll army and outfitting them with some more weapons also for anyone planning a pied piper moc another set with a rat in it the rating system figures 810 preferred troll torso and helmet style  parts 710 two spears and a sword but sadly lacking that all important shield fun fun fun 410 somewhat more to do on it’s own that other impulse at least the troll can fight the rat design 710 well designed even the flicker missile doesn’t look bad price 810 at £250 more than the other castle impulse grand total 3450 lack of a shield and to small to stand alone for my rating system conclusion castle fans got a great army builder with the knight and they’ve been lucky enough to receive another one with this set i’m glad we’ve got a troll impulse as it allow for enlarging the armies of evil some the crown knight don’t totally outnumber all their opponents	positive
best impulse set so far thanks for sharing your thoughts and yes someone should look into that rodent issue ill add this to the index within long	positive
good review i got 2 of those wheels are very useful especially if you dont have any  as for shields  i dont imagine trolls use them too much i think that they fight berserk style  all out assault one complaint is the piece that the wheels are attached to  its a single piece with smaller than the standard pin connection so you cant change the width of the cart for your mocs using the wheels i dont know if a piece with such a connection only on one side exists though 	positive
kimt on aug 29 2008 0655 am said best impulse set so far agreed i love this little sets i cant wait for it to hit shops here the rodent problem is funny but i lov always getting more animals so that is a plus the cart is a nicely formidable machine that i will keep together so i can maximise their fire power the troll figure is one of my favourite ever too i love that torso and helmet and i want that sword in grey i only have it in bronze thanks for the review batbrick away	positive

quote if you want to increase the number of your firefighter and their equipment this is a great way though there is something missing in my mind whats missing	neutral
opps well that’ll teach me to do reviews without my glasses thanks for pointing that out stauder	neutral
nice review and quite funny now ill never turn my back on a robot again poor set i find this set bad even for an impulse the robot is poorly designed and without any use the space minifig is ok id rather get another impulse set than this except the other life on mars mars mission impulse sets	negative

welcome to another sunny day in legovilletoday we will be joining the mailman on his daily route delivering the days mail when i first saw this set i immiediately liked iti think tlg should make more of these everyday life type sets such as delivering mail going to the grocery store things like that anyway enough blabbering on to the review 7731 mail van set name 7731 mail van year 2008 theme city pieces 66 price 799 pounds 499 euros 595 price per piece about 12 cents well start with the box shots the box is an interesting shape that i have never seen before very rectangular the box art is pretty nice the back shows the mailman delivering some mail the picture on the front is the same as on the box random manual shot the manual does not have the piece call outs but on a small set like this i dont feel its needed parts list decent selection of parts i really like the mail pieces image at the back of the manual showing all of the cargo sets together in a little scene i like it when the manuals have images like these because its nice to see all of the sets together all of the parts spread out the parts in this set are pretty good unfortunatly the car base is one large piece however we do get 2 printed mail pieces which are always nice our trusty mailman this torso i think is very nice the little envelope is a nice touch extra parts not much to say here the finished set i really like the design of the van it looks very smooth and somehow looks very lego to me the colors are my favorite part the red and yellow look nice together a nice mailbox however i wish the letter on the front was printed the front of the van is nice i think the textured brick on the front gives it a different look on the front which is nice the back of the van the doors open to store mail although it doesnt have much room i like that they included this feature delivery the mail bricks slide right into the hole at the front this adds nice playability the vans all loaded up we are ready to deliver  parts 710 pretty good piece selection but for 8 should have included a few more playability810 its fun to deliver the mail to all of your towns residents design 910 the design is very nice except i feel that some of the stickered parts could have been printed overall 2430 after a long hard day of delivering mail theres nothing like enjoying a nice pizza and letting your hair out why do they make us wear those silly hats anyway this is a nice set that i can definitely recommend and i think tlg should certainly release a post office to go with this and the air mail set i really like these everyday life sets rather than always fighting crime or putting out fires those guys have normal lives too brickshelf folder httpwwwbrickshelrycgif338718	positive

nice review i like this little set some how it reminds me now of postman pat in dutch pieter post an english childrens tv series about a postman in a little village somewhere in yorkshire aah sweet memories i would rather have seen a postoffice released with some women minifigs instead of the green post bigplane but maybe in a couple of years	positive
welcome to another sunny day in lego city the sun is shining the birds are singing minifigs are drowning wait what the coast guard rushes to the scene and deploys the coast guard 4wd  jet scooter to save the poor minifig from drowning lets take a look at the coast guards buggy 7737 coast guard 4wd  jet scooter set info set name 7737 coast guard 4wd  jet scooter theme citycoast guard released 2008 price 999 usd995 eur799 gbp pieces 130 minifigs 1 price per piece about 8 cents now the review the box here is the front it shows a nice image of the buggy on the beach with the ocean in the background the back the back shows some of the features in the set such as the extra equipment manual the picture on the manual is the same as on the box as usual the parts the set has great colors i love how the orange blue and white look together the part selection is quite good but unfortunately uses the large car base coast guard minifig this is a great fig the torso print is very nice and matches the buggys colors well new tire mold here are the new tires they look very good inmanual shot color separation is not a problem here and since it is a small set the piece call out is not a necessity extra parts it is always nice to get extra cheese slopes the finished set the design of the trailer and jetski is great the jetski is very smooth looking and the color scheme is fantastic the sticker on the roof is nice but its actually too big for the piece the corners of the sticker flap where the piece curves jetski closeup here you can see how it attaches to the trailer i didnt add the sticker that goes on the front which is a little sign that says bb03 or something attaching the trailer this is where the trailer connects to the main car it attaches simply with a ball joint car front view the license plate is a nice sticker and the top lights look nice say cheese driver the back the back is very similar to the front it has the same sticker the equipment rack a very welcome addition to the set it adds quite a bit of playability the orange fins are great all decked out he looks pretty spiffy in his diving suit doesnt he brickshelf folder the ratings price 1010 you cant get much more in here for 10 parts 910 nice selection and great colors the big car base is a bit annoying design 910 the jetski is a prime example of something with a small amount of pieces that still looks amazing playability 910 you can drive the car go diving and jetski across the bay minifig 710 the one it comes with is great but it could have come with one more perhaps a citizen of some sort build 810 simple but looks great overall 4250 lego sh brickset peeron bricklink even in the face of danger this member of the coast guard always has a smile on his face summary simply put for 10 you have to buy this set it is one of the better sets in this price range you can buy and one of the best small city sets the colors are great the design is great and the fig is great i dont normally think small sets are worth heavy praise but this one definitely deserves it thanks and happy building	positive
what an outstanding review of a great set i esp like your intro i have this set but have not opened it yet it looks like a fun little beach set the new coast guard theme is very nice edit this set could almost pass for classic town except for the use of orange and the lack of opening doors on the car 5 stars	positive
great job i will want to get this set soon its a lovely set with some coast guard saving on the jet ski what i dont like about this set is the lack of doors everything about this is nice but i still have to give it a 4 as for the entire flow of review i agreed with brickster that your introduction is very good with the little amends i had added earlier it turns out to be very good keep it up	positive
a very good review of an especially charming and lovely set thanks the whole cg theme looks very nice to me with a good and detailed set design and this one´s no exception although it would be nice to see more car doors and some new mf faces though	positive
i agree that this is a very good looking set i just finished building mine yesterday and i love it but here is one suggestion trim the large sticker that goes on the roof of the vehicle by cutting along the angles at the front of the sticker if you use it as it is it will extend beyond the flat surface of the roof and will overlap the lower sections past experience with stickers has suggested that this sticker will lift at the front corners lego stickers are probably the best that there are but sometimes modifications must be made now i want that large coast guard helicopter 7738	positive
great review of a great set one question how does the robotarmpiece connect to the jetski	positive
the coast guard sets are very eye catching the color scheme is making me want to pick up the entire line although the offshore platform hasnt been released stateside yet ive had my eye on this particular set for a few weeks now and is near the top of my to buy list with instructions provided on legocom i build a dr infero version of the jet ski to replace the one used in mission 2 swamp raid its a very sturdy design bulky enough to make it feel like a real vehicle great review too thankyou for the closer look at the set	positive
arrgh me hearties lets join the pirates as they try to steal the sacred treasure from the islanders hands it wont be easy king kahuka and his loyal warriors closely guard the treasure 24 hours a day will the pirates with their trusty pistols and cutlasses be able to defeat the islanders spears pet alligator and powerful leafy skirts we will find out 6262 king kahukas throne set info set name 6262 king kahukas throne theme piratesislanders released 1994 price  i dont know the original price i got it from bricklink with no box for 17 unfortunately i was not able to locate the euro or pounds price pieces 123 minifigs 5 off we go unfortunately i dont have the box because i didnt like the idea of spending over 50 for a set with under 200 pieces so sorry no box pics instructions i think the image on the front is very good it seems less setup somehow than the instructions these days it looks more like someone snuck up on them while they were going about their duties and snapped away rather than something that was planned the parts a nice selection here there is a pretty good amount of printed pieces in this set which is always nice for example the zebra print tile as well as the pirate flag nowadays would almost certainly be stickered the set also comes with a nice dark grey burp and a red boat for the pirates the minifigs the main buying point of this set for me were the minifigs this set comes with 5 of them which is quite good for a small set like this especially when compared to the sets of today the set comes with 1 alligator 2 pirates 2 islander warriors and king kahuka himself i really like the islanders torso and leg prints the leafy skirts are a nice touch and the makeup on the faces is superb some parts i liked these shields have a nice design on them and i always like the treasure chests a picture inside the manual this is a feature that i liked in the manual it shows an overhead view of the baseplate so its much easier to find where to put the piece i certainly could have used this feature in last years aquabase invasion set a closeup of the king the face print is nice i wonder who kahukas makeup artist is the finished set first the pirates boat the boat is really nice the sail is made out of a nice cloth and connects simply to the mast and now the main part of the set the throne this is a really nice model i think the colors and the design make it really feel like a different part of the lego world the rock sculpture looks fantastic as well the throne which is sort of a stretcher thing attaches here it connects on a 1x2 tile with a stud in the middle for easy removal here is the treasure that the pirates seek the treasure rests on tiles inside of the rock the zebra print tribal drum this is simple but nice one thing thats great about this which i mentioned earlier is that this and all of the other pieces with designs on them are printed thats right no stickers to be found here i have used these zebraprint tiles many times for mocs as they make a great exotic detail piece the lovely rock head i think this is wonderful it really adds a lot to the set it is well built with grey slopes curved pieces for the mouth and nose headlight bricks for the eyes and feathers and horns for detail the backside the complete set overall this looks great in my opinion with great landscaping and some fun parts well it looks like the pirates walked all over the islanders and stole their treasure in fact it looks like it was pretty brutal brickshelf folder now for the the ratings price 810 for 17 not a great price per piece value but when you add 5 figs in it makes it a decent price plus this set hasnt been in stores for 14 years so that adds some cost parts 910 the set has some really nice printed parts as well as a baseplate which in my opinion is great design 910 no flaws that i can think of right away the rock face is very well built playability 810 not really anything to play with although you can sail the ship and steal the treasure build 910 rock face uses nice techniques and the rest of the set is simple but looks good minifigs 1010 the minifigs are just fantastic great prints and just overall fun overall 5360 bricklink entry peeron brickset it looks like the pirates have picked up a new recruit from the island summary the older lego sets have a really different look to them than the new sets and i think its nice to have a mix of new and old this is definitely a great set with a nice build and great minifigs add to this the great printed pieces and that old pirate charm and you get a very nice set that i can certainly recommend thanks and happy building edited by erdbeereis 17 august 2009  0239 am	positive
as ive already said somewhere on this forum this is the largest islander set i own and therefore my favourite thankyou for your great review i picked mine up for only 5 pounds along with crocodile cage and king kahuka but i cant help you with the original price i would search the web but im too tired right now	positive
i feel the same way about the islanders sets brickster they are a nice change from the regular pirate versus soldiers that is the norm i think it would be interesting to see some new islanders sets released in the new pirate line to see how tlc would make them	neutral
what a wonderful review with smart showing the right parts and clear pictures fantastic job erdbeereis1 this set is interesting for several reasons first of all it contains a large amount of very useful minifigs not many sets of this size contain so much figs secondly the throne itself can be easily combined with the other islander sets or even with other pirate and nonpirate sets im going to see if i can get this one for a reasonable price on ebay	positive
excellent review i want this set now	positive
those indians look useful for indiana jones in the future as long as the have the new skin color i wish i could have picked one of those up when i could	neutral
well this is a not so old set and i bet most of you already have it so here is another review from me as usual let us start off with the box art box art i like the box art they put a nice background for the atap at the side we have the minifigs scale and at the back there is the function shown and advertisement for other set the content the content is consist of 6 packets of bricks and a instruction book yeap no sticker sheet instruction book the instruction books not only show us the steps but also show us all a clear pictures of the january release sets and some sets show with their function well this includes the atap functions as well besides there are bricks checklist as well and the how do you start off before assemble your sets and a little poster where the clones with their atap battling the droids heres a random page new pieces to me i never see both of this piece before so i assume it is a new pieces anyone have any idea is there any other sets that contains this piece the blasters we are given a 2 long blasters which is great which i it is more accurate as most of the clone troopers use a long blaster the minifigs the minifigs is 2 shock trooper but is different with 7655 clone troopers battle packss shock trooper the leg is different in colour we are given white hip while the one in the battle pack are given a black hip furthermore we get a new printed headgear which i think they have improve it check out the mouth printing the colour is brighter so here is the headgear the headgear limit itself from turning to the side this is because the front part it is too low until it block by the torso the shock troopers without helmet on we are given a black stud no face printed how i wish that i have extra with helmet on comparison with shock troopers from battle pack the atap heres the atap it looks ugly at a certain angle and looks great in a certain angle anyway i still like the set i like the walker vehicle below are the pictures taken randomly top view side view without stabilizer leg with stabilizer leg rear view the functions well the functions are not so impressive just something turning around open here and there the only function that is say as special is the retractable stabilizer leg the cockpit the cockpit can fit two clone troopers but too bad we are only given two and is not enough as there is no gunner on top inside it there is a guns holders which can hold two guns but fall off easily when you are trying to remove the guns well the other side have some speedometre thing and a controller to reveal the cockpit you have to open the top hatch look below so you can see whats inside oops the side hatch and back hatch as well open and close i think this pieces is use not to let you open the hatch but to make some design i mean make it able to move inside with clones beneath so this is the pieces that hold the stabilizer leg when is not in use this is how the stabilizer leg move at last and of course the revealing cockpit from below and at the back guess the droids have alternative way to take this things down faster the leg there are pieces blocking the leg to go to the front i mean overhead and lose balance the base in not movable the side armor the side armor has door and this is how it is attach it is very flimsy when you want to adjust it to be a little steep to creat the shape they might just fall off so it is connected to the body with just a technic pin and to hold it properly here is the support the side hatch it open and close easily very loose nothing to hold it tight heres some view when the side hatch is open the cannon the cannon on top is movable and adjustable the big cannon can move up and down while the smaller one can cove sideways but the smaller one tend to lose balance when it is without minifigs means the one on top and below will not b align this is the pieces that only enable it to move up and down to prevent it from moving freely lego put two pieces to block it completion i try to make the sets looks great i think this angle is right spare parts it is so few compare with 7673 magna guard starfighter and it is more expensive overall this set is not really a good set the hatch is quite flimsy top and the side since there is nothing to hold them tight besides it is lack of one clone but to complete your walker collection you must have it pros no sticker needed new improved headgear long balsters cons lack of clone flimsy expensive as few pieces are given hope you guys like it edited by kimt 30 august 2008  1201 pm	neutral
i do not like the fact that the clones have pure white legs it looks weird to me it was also weird that they included shock troopers but it was probably a way to get people to buy it this set also seems like one of those that was kind of thrown in with a mix of other sets like the tie crawler i never picked it up and with the new clone wars sets out i wont	negative

stauder on aug 29 2008 0845 am said has anyone noticed the boxart includes the 3rd leg both in the lowerd position as well as the raised one stauder i believe thats to show off the functions of the set nice review you carefully explained every detail and i think that ill buy this set now im glad lego decided to make two seats in the interior and they did a very nice job on the third leg looking good both up and down i think i will switch the hips of the shock troopers into black like the other shock troopers	positive

i could have gotten this set if i wanted to but it seemed like a waste of money to me i dont like the shock troopers helmets that much i feel they should have printed visors instead of cut out ones like they have in my opinion it would make it look a lot better the at ap itself sounds like it has a lot of holes in its cockpit which drags the set down and make it seem like they havent exactly put a lot of effort into it great review	negative
valentin on sep 13 2008 1035 pm said thanks keke imagine the horror that gripe my heart to see the discounted price on the sgs toys r us flyer about a month after its release into retail anyway looking forward to your other reviews too hey valentin and white fang glad to see fellow sgs here more reviews pls	positive
thanks for the review i love this impulse set i bought two of them so i could make a wizard and his apprentice i didnt have an owl either so an extra is pretty cool and i like the trans globe piece batbrick away	positive
the next in my attempt to review every impulse set single handed theme space mission mars set name alien jet set number 5617 number of pieces 21 figures1 released 2008 list price £199 gbp 350 usd 299 euro 5617 peeroncom 5617 bricklink catalog 5617 shop at home as always we begin outside of the box it looks rather exciting at first glance set that cost a lot more than this one now for what€™s inside the contents of the box the impulse sets never look that inspiring now for the alien i have to say i€™m not impressed i€™m not a big space fan and i only bought this due to my impulse review challenge but as the main point of the impulse sets is the alien is a little hard to build a good set round something with one point or articulation it lacks what make lego minfigs so great their articulation now for the space vehicle as always with impulse a short and easy build ensues took maybe 2 mins at the most time to mount the alien in his craft the craft looks a little wide for him slightly better from this angle but still not winning any awards i€™m disappointed of the impulse sets i€™ve reviewed so far this is clearly the weakest of them but what really disappointing is the other seem so good and useful the rating system figures 310 the alien is not a good minfig parts 610 some interesting parts but nothing that special fun fun fun 210 i can€™t think of anything to do with this set to be honest design 410 poorly designed the box makes it look much better price 610 despite the impulse price tag i€™m still unhappy about the price grand total 2150 less than half marks the lowest i€™ve given so far conclusion in many ways i€™m annoyed from the outside of the box this set looks quite interesting and certainly appears to be well designed the idea of a small alien fighterflying craft is in my opinion a good one but sadly when you€™ve got the finished product in your hand it looks nothing like the box art while i think mission mars had some interesting sets and i might still get some of them this one will not be a repeat purchase for me	negative
well set out review with alot of great content gotta ask you though how does the set look nothing like the box art with so few pieces id have thought one could mentally put it together given the box front	neutral
i’m not a great communicator but what i was trying to say was that on the box the sets looks quite exciting and well made and that the alien fits much more snugly than it does so i was a bit disappointed that it seemed wider and less compact and certainly less exciting when i opened it	negative
i rated this poor due to the fact the set is unimaginative looks like a bunch of plates where thrown together and it just isnt worth the money lego is asking for it imo ive never been a fan of the nonarticulated jellies so ill leave my disgust for them out of this post however unlike the set the review is a fine work of art that clearly depicts the goods and provides valuable insightopinions about the sets playability usefulness and overall value	positive
cardinal brick on aug 30 2008 0623 pm said the question is what could you do with this set i mean it’s just spacemen in a line what could you do the possibilities are endless 1 you can stand them in a line 2 stand them in a circle 3 stand them in a square 4 sit them all down 5 sit some of them down and leave some standing up adult supervision may be necessary for tfols attempting this one 6 take them all apart and scatter the pieces like some kind of huge space mine has gone off 7 yeah ok thats probably enough for now seriously i love all the sets of minifigs from all the different themes and this is a great one i always wanted them when i was a kid but never did my focus always was on town sets petrol stations and police sets please stand up and there was never enough pocket money left over for space sigh you are so lucky to have this great set thanks for sharing cheers rog	positive

fantastic review this is one of the classic minifigs pack which is so great for gathering massive number of minifigs i miss those days where they sell 5 minifigs together in a set thanks for this lovely review	positive
thanks for the review jimbutcher i really like that set it combines interesting and good design with some awesome cool parts and a neat amount of charm	positive
this is a great set i have 2 of them now and i plan to get more it is much better than the droid battle pack for 10 bucks more you get better battle droid arms and some canon vehicles good enough for me	positive
this is a must have set for aotc fans and i really love the hailfire droid but it costs like 80 or more now that its discontinued	neutral
kimt on aug 30 2008 0527 pm said i just bought this set the other day and i must admit that it gets a below average from me the price is not corresponding with what you get which would be implied had jim added the eur or gbp price in the infohint hint  the spider droid is flimsy at best making it stand or even move without tumbling over is hard also why the brown cylinders on the legs keep the colourscheme clean please the figs are fine except that i dislike the clone headgear and the fact that the helmets now have holes in the sides allowing the flesh head to show within  goofy looking i am soo replacing the clone heads with black ones great review of an acceptable set aw thats too bad kimt while i must admit it is flimsy i still love this set oh yeah i added the other prices thank you	positive

thanks for the review i really do like the first year of ef nowadays they mecha are perhaps more cleverly designed and use ball joints for playability but i really love the blocky bulky look of the first drones machines and somehow the older ones seem a better value of parts im more inclined to buy duplicates of them than the newer models	neutral
hi great review on one of my favourite themes i never realized how cool it was until just now when you did your review anyways i remember my one set of the arctict expedition the arctic expedition pack	positive
a very nice review i really miss the arctic theme i didnt own any of the sets but after looking at the pictures in this review and reading the instructions on brickleys words and brickfactory i want them	positive
i find it amusing that the numbers on the decal for the flag were chosen so that it wouldnt look stupid if you put it on upsidedown by accident	neutral
wasnt there some years back a film based on aliens in the arctic cant remember the name and i think it was really old but there certainly was going on something with strange creatures and a polar base	neutral
i chose above average it has a great minifigure i wish i had itsomeday i will	positive
this is a very good review no doubt about it about this set this is a cheap way to buy this set with a witch and some nifty accessories such as the black cat in fact i think this is the first time i had ever seen a black cat its simple but not very useful in my collection because other fright knight sets also offer the witches too i dont need many witches overall i feel that this is an average set	neutral
yay another fright knights review odd comic at the end skipper 24 on sep 1 2008 0705 pm said ever wanted to turn into a animal wanted to curse your enemy or just wanted to be rich beyond your wildest dreams you should go visit the witch and her fireplace she can brew you up a potion for any occasion or purpose so head down to see the witch right now sounds like a song or nursery rhyme somehow anyway to the review it is a great review such a small set but youve summed it up well this is one of the few unpromo fright knight sets i didnt get sadly not sadly because of willa the witch i have about four of her but the special cat and the other bits one can never have too many lego bats i voted the set outstanding i think it is for its size kimt on sep 1 2008 0816 pm said you already know how i feel about the review good or bad feelings edited by shoc 02 september 2008  1145 am	positive

6205 vwing fighter number of pieces 118 number of minifigs 1 price 999 usd 1399 eur 899 gbp theme star wars episode iii year released 2006 brickset folder bricklink catalog welcome to this review of the vwing fighter this will be my eighth review on the boards strangely enough there was another set called the vwing fighter that came out in 1997 for the space theme note that i am missing several small pieces to this set but they are mostly insignificant to the overall look the box this is the standard box type for all 20052006 star wars sets i cant say that i like it as much as the 2007 or 2008 box types but itll do it features a profile view of darth vader and silver text overview this is the whole set this ship is meant to protect the chancellor at all costs they are usually found in groups of three or four front this ship is very sleek and youll notice that its colors are dark red light bley and dark bley with a touch of black it starts at the nose very narrow but as the body progresses to the back it gets wider like a v hence the name back here is a view of the rear note the transneon green discs used to represent the boosters also notice the dark red r4 astro droid and the hinges used as aromor flight all four wings two on each side can open up for flight attack mode they can open even farther then the pic shows but its not an intended function the wings a great but its a real pain to position them correctly and the bottom wings close when you set the ship down tail fins this is what the tail fins look like on each side with two flaps attached to the top and bottom if you look closely the tail fins and wings look a little bit like a mini ship themselves maybe controlled by remote no this is not an intended function either guns side the guns are very simple but very clever using a double technic hole piece two black bars and two technic pins also note the landing gear minifig finally here is the minifig a clone pilot it has light blue arms and legs white hands a helmet with black markings and republic insignia on it and a doublesided torso the front of the torso is great featuring shoulder straps armor plating and a life support system while this minifig is not altogether accurate to the movie it has still been one of my favorite star wars figs back the back of the fig that can double as the front of clone marines this side features shoulder straps and armor plating cockpit lastly here is the pilot seated in the cockpit he fits perfectly although it is not airtight we wouldnt want the poor guy to suffocate now would we that wraps up the review here is the final verdict build 810 a nice easy build and the last of the small sw ships 10 or less playability 610 pretty fun to swoosh around but thats about it could use a vulture droid but that would take away the small factor swooshability 1010 very fun and easy to swoosh around endlessly without fear of it breaking minifigs 910 there really is no need to have more although a palpy fig would be outstanding the pilot is a great figure though design 910 extremely accurate to the movie but the cockpit is not airtight price 1010 you couldnt ask for a better deal overall score 86 an excellent set unfortunately this is the last of the small sw ships currently the fig is great and the sleek design is accurate that just about sums it all up feel free to leave your comments edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0311 am	positive

its an ok set but its extremely overpriced where i live i simply couldnt justify paying 1799 tax for 5 minifigs the fact that these figures are featured prominantly in other sets makes this set a difficult purchase given the price i find it hard to look at this set with much enthusiasm	neutral
i like your review on this battle pack but i think that this battle pack was over priced 12 for this i am not paying that much for 5 knights	negative
yeah i have to admit you expect it to be wayyy cheaper since a no packaging to pay forbaggies and such b no liscensing feeslike sw so why isnt this set a better deal than sw battlepack dont look at me look at tlche he it rhymed	negative

i agree that this set is worth the price considering the amount of minifigs and even a skeletal horse it also comes with a lot of blue 1x1 slopes that are always useful and quite rare to obtain another weapon for the soldier operating the catapult or a shield for the other soldier would have been great but that is pushing it the crossbow itself is quite nice and is better than what most 6 sets come with imo overall a good set indeed thank you for the review and the other review concerning the knight of which i hope to buy in the near future as it looks like it comes with a great deal of goodies the weapon rack is useful too	neutral
thanks for the input	positive
dark times in lego castle land the poor knight is being held prisoner in the skeletons prison carriage we must help the brave knight on horseback free him at once lets ride 7092 skeletons prison carriage set info set name 7092 skeletons prison carriage theme castle released 2007 price usd 1999gbp 1499eur 1995 pieces 193 minifigs 5 animals 4 price per piece about 10 cents review time box shots our first pic is the front of the box which shows a dark image of the knight attemping to free the prisoner and here is the back showing some features the manual the image on the manual is the same as on the box front random manual shot no piece callouts but the color distinction is not a problem the parts 193 pieces doesnt seem like a lot but many of them are quite large the selection is pretty good lots of greys and black minifigs with this set comes a whopping 5 minifigs which is amazing for a 20 set the knights are very nice and one has a doublesided head the horses adding to the already large minifig count are the 4 horses 3 skeleton horses and 1 great brown horse for the knight extra parts now the finished set first we have the brave knight on his brown stallion the horses head covering looks very nice and the knight gets a nice long pointy stick the main event the prison carriage the design of this is excellent with the bionicle piece and the white horns it looks very spooky the tower this part is one of my favorites it uses white horns to give it a great creepy look one problem is that there is barely enough room for the 2 skeletons the driver here you can see the driver and his whip you can also see the bionicle spine a side view when you look from the side you can see the great design of the prison it is placed on tiles for easy removal and looks great with the round white 1 x 1s on the corners horses harness this is another very well designed portion of the set the harness attaches easily to the horses and to the carriage the prison look at the poor imprisoned knight lets try to free him the back of the prison hinges down the knight is freed everything together all together the set looks fantastic the carriage has a great creepy skeleton feel and getting 9 minifigs is amazing brickshelf folder ratings price 1010 193 pieces and 9 figs is fantastic for 20 parts 910 lots of good large pieces design 1010 captures the spooky skeleton look very well playability 810 its fun to try and free the prisoner and the carriage rolls well build 910 easy but fun minifigs 1010 the sheer amount of figs is great and they look great overall 5660 the future of lego castle summary this is an amazing set for the price a huge amout of minifigs combined with a great design and good playabilty makes the set a winner i would certainly recommend this set to anyone that remotely likes lego sets thanks and happy building	positive
i really like this set and its probably my next purchase from a store if i can still find it theres alot of great pieces i especially like the spiked thingy on the front and it makes a great addition for any skeletal army above all i just love the spinechilling feeling of it if i were a minifig in a legoland id be scared out of my pantspiece if i saw a carriage like that rolling towards me in a dark night	neutral

a great review of a very good set i must echo kimt though i seem to be doing it an awful lot it would be improved by the addition of one more fig to the set as it’s the same price band as last years catapult	positive
ive skipped a few lunches on behalf of this set its a great army builder but so are many of the new castle sets what makes this great in my opinion is the figs  2 orcs and 1 dwarf  what else could one want thanks tlg for making this set and thank you for reviewing it for us review added to the index	positive
you chose the perfect set for your first poll simon no question this set is one of the alltimebeauties i rated outstanding of course i never hat the chance to get a complete copy of this set but i do own the engine and quite a bunch of monorail tracks your very detailed review made me think of getting the whole set some day thank you very much for this i never realized there were so many details included to this set the snackbar and the telephone cell and all the other nice things really strange for a nineties set which often lacked details the only thing that comes to my mind right now is that the engine looks quite blocky if the set was released today tlc would use more of those parts which make a better design imo and it would fit better to the curved walls of the stations as well wishful thinkinghow much would i love to see the monorail system back again wishful thinking i had to lough when reading your comment on the minifig seats dont you own many of those i dont know where to put mine	positive
this is an outstanding review which deserved to be featured here after seeing this set it prompts me to own this set and match with my 10159 legend city airport its very nice to see such outstanding set being reviewed and presented to our very screens everything about this set is simply outstanding i cant imagine that such incredible set actually released before why dont they ever continue with this anymore sigh its nice to see so much detailed from its shuttle snack bar stairs waiting platform validating machine and etc this is an instant 5 set if given a chance to own a misb set i will defintely seriously consider about it	positive

gasp blasphemy someone voted this set below average brings out hunting rifle ahem back on topic i remember wanting this set badly for years and i still want it just no as much because its expensive and as this review proves takes up a lot of room ive already got my trains to think about and i wont be getting this set anytime soon i also have a faint memory of this set being featured in one of legos advertisements more specifically someone narrowly missing it hitches a ride races the monorail to the airport and catches the plane i am yet to find it on the net as old lego adverts are hard to come by especially the european ones now to more important matters starts hunting edited by freddie 07 september 2008  1003 pm	positive

indexed name refuse collection truck set no 6693 theme lego system  town year 1987 pieces 103 minifigs 2 price unknown special parts 4215ap08 yellow panel 1 x 4 x 3 with recycling pattern just occurs in this set 2x 4598 red bracket 2 x 3  2 x 2 occurs only in this set and only one other set this truck was introduced in the same year that lego came up with the garbage bins that of course also appear in this set have you ever wondered why most of the time the streets of lego city are so clean and neat no litter no garbage everywhere no chewinggum on the streets even with so many different inhabitants it seems to always stay that way however the older afols amongst us have experienced totally different situations rubbish everywhere smelly and dirty looking pavements minifigs that were losing their standard grin that is why lego came out with this magnificent truck back in 1987 before that people needed to put there garbage in bags or maybe barrels from that year on every miniman and miniwoman is happily using a trash bin the minifig civil servants never seem to become tired and the garbage truck comes every other day to collect the rubbish and keep the city clean the secret behind the clean lego city and the always happy standard grin of our minifolks are the antilitter warriors that use their powerful machines and handy tools to just get the job done so if you dont own a garbage truck better try to get one before your standard grins also fade and your streets become as dirty as naples where the garbage collectors recently had a strike for quite some time an overview of the set including instructions actually one is included in the set unfortunately i afraid we dont have any boxes of this set left another image of the lego items in the set it shows the truck two civil servants to perform the waste collection duties two garbage bins and a broom and shovel the two chaps that always seem to smile even when the litter that they collect really stinks the accessories that accompany the set a broom and a shovel to help cleaning up in case a dustbin tips over a very nice feature of the set is that the elevator at the back can be lifted in more or less the same way that real garbage trucks do as you can see here the dustbin is emptied through a red train window it seems to be that the hinges of my version will need some revision panels inside the back of the truck maximize waste capacity for this 4 stud wide truck it is nice that the designers added this simple red round brick on a clip presumably it should depict cylinders to let the back compartment tip for emptying or otherwise it might be gastanks again the complete set it is very complete set but some additions could make it even more playable  garbage eg a green flower bottom or some round plates 1 x 1  a place for the second worker to position himself on when the trucks needs to drive to the dumpsite or an other street and also vertical bars for that second worker to hold himself by this is what the truck will look like when dumping the litter at the recycle plant or dump site the whole back nicely tilts so that all the litter will fall out of the truck a view on the back of the truck quite a small but yet effective opening the front of the truck only one seat for just the driver but i personally prefer that to a 6 wide truck that fills the total width of the streets and has problems with corners of course set 7991 the orange garbage truck of last year is also nice we also own some of those but we never put them in our lego town since they take too much room and the color scheme of 6693 is also more preferable to us the two panels with the printed recycling pattern are a bit worn so we might recreate the recycle logo and put it on a sticker some day playability 810 like i mentioned it is too bad that the set doesnt have any litter however lego also saw that and has put litter in the 6693 set design 910 a really nice truck with two minifigs and very nice details price 10 i was not able to get any price information at bricklink one can still obtain a 2nd hand one for about 25 overall 810 a set that should be entitled a classic in the same list as the pizza restaurants the 7750 and the blacksmith shop that was all the pictures i was allowed to take since it seems that those brave man still have quite some trash cans to empty thanks guys for doing the dirty work so our minifigs stay happy and our streets stay clean peeron lugnet brickset bricklink entries additional notes on the review my brother has always been keen on garbage trucks however when he became aware of this truck it wasnt available in the stores anymore newer sets that had the recycling theme we not that good they didnt have the emptying mechanism so after our dark ages one of the first sets we bought were some of those nice refuse collection trucks although the new orange truck has the desired mechanisms and thankfully is a decent garbage truck we more like 4 wide trucks than 6 studs wide trucks so for the years to come our lego town inhabitants will still be seeing this great truck to control their waste problems	positive
definitely the best garbage truck ever the color scheme is great and the design is awesome outstanding without a doubt i must have it sometime	positive
greetings just looking through the review index when i came across this one i recently acquired this set through ebay which came with a practically perfect box and instructions i would almost say that no one played with it much as all of the parts were brand new anyway i just wanted to say that this is a great set that was worth the 1499	positive
a nice set my brother used to have this i wish the pilots helmet had a little printing on it looks messed up to me	positive
thanks for sharing your thoughts and opinion about this set with us ive added it to the index this is one of my favourite ties and i think tlg did a good job at designing it	positive
a very robust set the fact that it seats two figs plus has ls makes it a unique set i definitely liked the big airport subtheme tlg created in the early 1990s	neutral
jopiek i enjoyed this review very much your first picture certainly capture the essence of this lovely set in reality i am in the aviation line especially aviation safety therefore you reentact the scene very well to be honest i have never seen this set before this aes airport emergency service fire truck is certainly unbelievable i love it very much its a pity i never owned this this is a set which give me a 5 great job jopiek i enjoyed viewing your classic town reviews very much keep up the good work	positive

i remember my cousins having this set both are in their permanent dark ages now but are not willing to give their lego to me if you have one of those old airports then this set is what you need to have even more fun since it makes a great addition to the airport excellent review 1010	positive
i was going to get this but instead i got someting else firetruck i think nice review	positive
i have this one the newer 6571 station is better in some ways but i always liked the big airportstyle fire engine in this and the windows covering the garages one mod project i have in mind is to expand the base adding a second room in the area beneath the control center interestingly this set had two different box pictures there was the original 1989 yellow legoland box and a 1991 blue system box and the blue box has the vehicles in different places quote price usd 8500  gbp unknown  eur unknown if this is referring to the original price it wasnt that much 50 is more like it	neutral
this set looks real nice but a wall in the middle with a stair and a few deskscontainers	neutral
i think the 6382 fire station is the better one from the 80ies	neutral
found this set on a flea market in munich yesterday just 25 years after its release the instructions for a total of five models two of them printed the other 3 are just photo instructions in the book it still has the box in good shape despite some wear from the age sadly five little pieces were missing and 5 wrong pieces inside instead 2 complete wheels and a classic 80s90s plane wing dumped into my bricks but i was able to replace the missing minifig torch and the 4 missing plates with identical pieces from my collection the box and contents the set still has the original box inside the pieces plastic insert instructions and a 1987 technic catalogue imagine that set livespan today four years and the 8841 is still in the catalogue classic technic design from early 80s showing a function drawing of the steering and the main model a small set but with a flap shoeing the contents all pieces in the inner box and the papers included 5th model soapbox racer this is more or less a soapbox racer with working steering but no engine its got a rather blocky design but still looks sleek enough and is a simple build little over 100 pcs out of 180 the soapbox at step 2 just included the steering at step 6 completed and ready to race downhill total 710 simple but effective 4th model simple chassis very simple and boring alternate using just 13 of the 180 pieces in the set it even hasnt got a seat construction its just a plain steering mechanism attached on wheels with a spartan chassis of just a few pieces this is the whole model at step 5 just attach the steering mechanism and wheels and youre done total the worst alternate model of the complete set just a boring 410 3rd model balance very original small model its a small model of a working classic balance and it works with small parts laid on the scales altough theyve got just a 4x4 footprint its a fast build just 15 minutes and youve done it the model as it looks at step 3 finished easy build with just 63pcs out of 180 total very original model it actually works with small weights but a very simple build still a 710 alternate model tractor with equipment this is the second model its a simple but boxy design featuring a harrow and a plough the tractor has a similar design to the very first tractor set but much smaller the plough is about 24wide and the harrow is completely snotted even back in 1983 has two functions working steering and the coupler for the equipment uses almost all pieces of the set the tractor at step 8 the steering isnt completely attached now this is the completed tractor the complete harrow finished alternate with the plough attached total nice but quite ugly and boxy design for a tractor with 4 wheels of the same size takes me to a 610 main model desert racer this is the main model with a nice for early 80s but boxy design it has two functions steering and a working 1cylinder rear engine which is of the old 2x2 piston type since the small piston design wasnt invented back then this is the only model of the set which has piece callouts in the instructions the printed alternate model has no callouts they werent invented on both models back in 1983 the three smaller photo instruction alternates have a piece callout at the beginning showing all needed pieces the seat is a nice but blocky design and use a primitive snot technique this is the model at step five the piston is already attached imagine this state on step 5 in modern sets back then lego had challenging instructions not the step madness like today this is the engine just made of plates with a hole in the middle for the piston step 9 the piston engine is completed on step 12 the roll bar and the seat are installed only the steering isnt completed yet front view of the finished model just 15 steps needed back then birds eye view of the whole set displayed on the box model verdict nice design especially the colorful seat in snot technique but quite boxy especially the engine since there were only the huge pistons still a 910 set verdict design and models 710 very boxy designs due to the age the chassis alternate sucks build 910 classic 80s technic building quite challenging but fun sturdyness 710 rear section damaged after the table fall but rather easily fixed fun 910 blast from the past overall 810 mfg widdi edited by widdi 07 september 2008  0411 pm	positive

jopiek on sep 7 2008 1120 pm said the chair was just loose so it should be placed on the 2x2 plate that is also visible in the picture of the middle car thats not the one i was thinking of it was the other two chairs towards the middle of the wagon that i was thinking of if you try to seat a minifig in either of them youll quickly find that its impossible beacuse the door interferes with the figs required personal space if you move both of them one stud forward so that the back of the seat lines up with the edge of the window itll solve the problem and still leave space for a figs to be seated in the other chairs	neutral
a great review for a great set thanks for sharing it with us a like the older lego trains btw i think you need to fix this quote name jetport fire squad light and sound series	positive

beach cruisers set  6445 theme island xtreme stunts year released 2002 piece count 97 minifigs 2 list price 7 usd during a trip to legoland california in 2002 their big store had a neat little display of some new sets and themes including island xtreme stunts the new theme offered great colors including orange tan and light blue which immediately caught my eye the theme focussed on island fun with some adventure and included some great figs like the brickster i had to buy at least one set choosing truck  stunts trike review coming soon at the time the theme was short lived and many of the sets were on sale at discount toy stores not too long after their initial release i picked up this set 6445 beach cruisers for 333 usd which will be my first of three island xtreme stunt reviews starting with the box a race between the street surfer and skate boarder the back shows some alternate models including a sail boat and jet ski same image on the instructions as the box but the backside shows the island xtreme stunts video game for different platforms the set includes a small decal sheet for the skateboard i love the two figs included within this set one is a hippietype with shades and leafed muscle short and the other pizza boy skateboarder check out the pizza boy on his skateboard two green brackets are included for attaching each fig to the long grey bar using this piece one can make the skateboarder do tricks and flips the street surfer vehicle is pretty nice to the sail is placed on a black bar and lance then attached to the vehicle heres a picture of the vehicle to me it has that old soap box derby look to it  like something kids would create to race down a hill the vehicle doesnt have a steering wheel but rather two levers which i think work well in the cockpit heres the underside the set has three neon orange wheels that attach to technic axle pins to attach to the vehicle lastly the entire set with a few extra pieces final thoughts while island xtreme stunts is not the best citytown subtheme esp for the traditional lego classic town fan it does have some fun sets like this little beach cruiser good figs a skateboard and a very rollable fun word equivalent to swooshable but for vehicles with wheels vehicle you can even blow on the sail to get it to roll across the floor this set is a lot of fun	neutral

i had never seen these sets before in my retail stores before however i do remember the existence of its video games look like an interesting set for great outdoor enterainment and fun for lego citizens whom is out for real thrill and excitement this theme never really got me excited back then after reading your review its quite useful for some new addition to your town features such as including a skater boy holding the pizza instead of using the pizza van the high fuel cost must have caught up to them to resort using skate board for delivery as for the street surfer vehicle its a cool looking vehicle with unique construction pardon me i have not seen such design before i will actually tear off the wheels cover up the sides and used it for wind surfing thats the whole idea after giving some thoughts and weighs its factors i will have to give it a 3 for this set i will probably get it if its on sales once again brickster this is a lovely review which has showed us a new perspective of island xtreme stunts	neutral
wout on oct 16 2008 0100 pm said the hippie guy is called  snap lockit and the pizza guy is called  pepper roni i think the legodesigners had a cosy evening with much beer when they thought about the names thanks for that bit of info im not familiar with the computer game or the characters although i may have heard the name pepper roni do you know the island girls name not included in this set though	neutral
nice review is that one minifig breaking out of prison just wondering about his clothing the worst thing is the name anything with xtreme in the title almost deserves the lowest score possible on principle	negative

this is a really nice small set i think it fascinates me that those are actual printed parts thats something we dont see too often anymore the figures are very good although i must say i like the name hippie dude better than snap lockitt does anyone know why the brickster has one blue hand thanks for the great review edited by erdbeereis1 09 september 2008  0645 pm	positive
it is not very often that i rate a legoset poor its the first time actually but in this case i had no other option the idea of this set is good and i like the mostly yellow minifig but the design of both the airplane weird windowpiece a propellor that is way too small minimal skies underneath and a strange colourscheme and the hangglider two handlebars on the wings too many colours makes the set mark the essence of legos downfall during those years i really appreciate the fact that you made a review of this set brickster it made me look into the details of 6735 but i am just as sure today as i was back then i will never buy this anyway thanks for the review the quality of the set may be a disapointment your review certainly is not	negative
hello all eurobricks members and town lovers today i will be doing up a review on glade runner set this is a very small set which is slightly bigger than the current impulse set its part of the race theme which involved in land and sea racers back in the early 1990s i just love these orignal race themes which is produced back then name glade runner theme lego system  town  race year 1993 pieces 29 minifigs 1 price usd325 an image of a 6513 glade runner swamp race shall begins this glade runner is pretty nice looking with its sleek sports look well for a glade runner in the water it certainly looks much impressive somehow i felt that the 6513 is aligned with the 6514 trail ranger i always had that perception that both vehicles are brothers and was released under the same year in fact glade runner was released in 1993 based on peeron information i always felt that this set is used for investigators or police to used for tracking or search purposes in the swamp areas instead of using it for a race i will place this set in the jungle somewhere like bricksters jungle settings although it looks too bright for such serious agenda but i think its pretty useful to use it this way they can rent it from the nearby shop and used it to search it kind of reminded me of the movie us marshals which acted by tommy lee jones and wesley snipes meet the ace please pardon his trousers i did not bleach it earlier it was caused overtime without adequate caring to the minfig look at this great article on how to protect your lego the driver wears a green vest with patch pockets on both sides this is my favourite design during that period it comes with a yellow lifevest too as for the 1x4 printed tile with 3 stars shining in front of the runner its a very nice printed tile that can be used for other racing purposes in other sets as well overall design the built is very simple and yet so realistic making use of the aeroplane tailhead to add as the holder for the rotor is smart the white bricks acting as a platform for both sides to hold the driver to sit onto the centre with the steering wheel at the front i am very happy with this design place the glade runner in front of the fan with a reasonable fan speed you will see the rotor runs like a charm different angles of the vehicle close encounter with the swamp sharks coined by brickster see you later to conclude this is a very nice little set that can provide much fun i dont really used it to race in the waters instead i leave it to my imagination and used it for police investigation purposes such as air crash excerise search and rescue operations and etc i think it can provides quite a fun loving experience although the set might not be very appealing to some people but i find it very fun to play around and is one of my favourite sets in the 1990s where i placed it with my 6514 trail ranger together summary review playability 8510 i leave it to your imagnination design 910 very simple yet realistic design price 1010 a very inexpensive set great way to buy such small sets at a low price overall 8510 glade runner is not common in town and city theme its not a must to have it but if you ever come across it do get it i gave it a 4 based on my review score card what about yours hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated	positive
thanks erdbeereis1 for your kind words glad you liked this set just wondering whom has rated poor and below average i will like to know why you voted this way perhaps you could share with me and the rest on your thoughts and views	neutral
this is one of those sets that make me really want to start building up a city its a great value has a lot of useful pieces and is just plain fun to play with i do miss vehicles having doors though great review i was a bit curious as to how the dumping mechanism worked as well as the sticker count	positive
nice truck indeed but the yellow one is better i think at least if you put them on a roadplate it seems to me that those road plates are too small for that also it will not empty completely because of that panel well for the rest it is a nice set and a fine review	positive
nice review this is a very nice vehicle one of my favorite of the newer city ones jopiek there are two generations of road plate that are wide enough for sixwide vehicles like this the current plates are dark grey with plain white printing and look not great in my opinion the previous ones are imo the best road plates of all time  green with dark grey road white dotted linezebras drain covers and yellow verge markings just like we really have here in ireland for urban area i would still choose the greenedged plates and just cover up the green  the markings are so much better than the current plates	neutral

a good set with a nice color scheme i still prefer the last one that had a removable bin	positive
i like this set but i cant give it a good grade for playability as the rearmost hinging section is too stiffly hinged so when you open it its likely to break if you hold it just over the shovel and broom my truck thus has that function and with it of course the whole container tipping disabled i also moved the cab a bit forward and the front axle rearward to give the cab the typical garbage truck look as they are often very low slung this also created space behind the cab for some equipment	negative
