list
price
unknown
as
part
of
the
classic
space
collection
lego
offered
two
sets
of
moon
plates
one
was
a
set
of
two
crater
plates
and
the
other
this
very
useful
landing
plate
set
not
much
to
review
but
worth
sharing
a
few
images
the
landing
plate
and
tplate
the
two
plates
connect
to
form
this
very
nice
classic
space
landing
platform
set
497
galaxy
explorer
included
the
landing
platform
but
the
one
that
i
had
was
lighter
in
color
than
the
one
contained
in
this
set
at
least
the
yellow
circle
future
lego
space
sets
could
benefit
by
having
similar
road
plates
share
your
thoughts
neutral
these
are
my
only
space
base
plates
from
classic
space
actually
with
only
2
plates
i
could
not
do
much
serious
expansion
with
it
instead
i
merged
it
with
my
old
city
baseplates
and
used
it
as
a
docking
station
for
scientific
purposes
or
restricted
facilities
that
is
guarded
by
the
police
these
baseplates
are
very
useful
and
is
suited
for
creating
a
space
command
center
up
in
the
space
positive
these
are
pretty
good
but
i
think
they
look
too
much
like
the
standard
town
roads
from
that
period
i
like
the
black
space
plates
from
the
early
90s
better

first
what
i
liked
sooooo
much
was
the
cover
of
these
plates
with
this
large
picture
of
a
classic
space
scene
i
still
have
a
306
misb
just
to
keep
that
nice
feeling
of
taking
it
out
of
a
plastic
box
and
look
at
it
there
were
different
versions
of
the
cover
though
second
the
markings
of
the
landing
platform
changed
at
some
point
id
have
to
check
it
later
when
im
at
home
think
it
had
something
to
do
with
the
interupted
yellow
lines
negative
these
plates
are
great
in
setting
up
your
space
base
and
giving
your
ships
a
place
to
land
my
favorite
though
is
the
lunar
crater
plate
which
i
use
to
death
in
my
comic

oh
how
i
love
these
plates
afew
years
ago
i
found
a
local
retail
store
with
about
67
sets
of
these
in
their
basement
warehouse
i
was
given
special
access
to
along
with
many
other
old
space
goodies
hehe
i
love
the
things
i
have
loads
and
ive
used
them
for
multiple
space
bases
and
battles
along
with
afew
grey
crater
plates
and
the
large
grey
plates
15x
the
size
of
a
normal
baseplate
you
can
get
quite
a
monorail
layout
going
sigh
i
should
really
clean
up
and
get
one
set
up
again
so
i
can
take

you
probably
have
enough
to
make
that

got
one
pack
off

a

have
another
octagon

from
the
blacktron

base
im
building
my
carrier
moc
around
one
but
dont
have
anything
planned
for
the
others
these
baseplates
are
still
relatively
common
on
ebay
for
their
age
i
see
misb
packs
on
there
every
few
weeks
and
they
tend
to
sell
for
around
20
the
older
kind
in
the
op
are
much
harder

lego
brought
out
floating
boats
quite
early
and
in
many
ways
the
first
were
the
best
ill
explain
why
later
this
set
in
particular
is
interesting
as
it
came
out
in
two
versions
one
that
includes
the
first
minifigs
and
another
that
included
the
nonarmless
type
set
709
the
police
signs
are
stickers
and
are
in
surprisingly
good
condition
considering
the
age
of
the
set
i
am
missing
one
sticker
on
the
front
though
note
the
technic
bush
and
axel
they
are
the
old
type
the
position
of
the
second
figure
is
not
a
mistake
i
think
hes
supposed
to
be
sitting
down
the
first
boats
out
by
lego
needed
a
weighted
keel
to
prevent
them
keeling
over
i
have
tested
this
i
suspect
this
is
because
of
the
density
of
the
old
hulls
and
the
flat
bottom
but
i
could
be
wrong
it
cant
be
just
because
of
the
flat
bottom
as
the
new
cargo
ship
doesnt
need
one
the
keel
in
detail
the
bottom
extension
is
for
a
motor
not
included
nor
made
by
lego
at
the
time
the
keel
had
longer
studs
even
now
it
holds
extra
firmly
this
is
why
i
prefer
the
old
design
you
can
extend
or
shorten
the
hulls
as
you
please
or
even
insert
other
lego
in
the
middle
you
can
easily
add
wheels
or
any
other
piece
to
the
bottom
of
these
hulls
i
wish
they
would
go
back
to
this
idea
the
4
hulls
were
of
this
concept
but
were
too
wide
probably
so
the
keel
wasnt
needed
the
old
minifigs
aside
from
having
odd
feet
and
no
arms
had
a
normal
stud
as
the
neck
thus
when
you
turn
the
head
it
tends
to
come
off
i
love
this
set

excellent
review
i
know
i
got
it
for
a
song
on
ebay
most
1970s
sets
dont
seem
to
be
in
much
demand
neutral
i
love
those
minifigs
theyd
go
for
alot
on
ebay
i
bet
great
boat
as
well
i
love
the
old
hull
design
positive
this
set
showed
what
potential
variations
on
the
standard
brick
had
back
then
i
think
that
tlg
was
still
finding
its
legs
back
then
and
learning
new
things
so
this
is
a
solid
set
for
the
year
it
was
released
nice

cant

well
what
to
say
i
got
this
boat
late
70s
when
we
were
on
our
way
to
italy
to
spend
the
holidays
there
my
parents
always
needed
to
keep
my
quiet
during
the
3day
trip
and
the
best
way
to
do
that
was
to
buy
me
a
lego
set
i
got
this
one
in
a
gas
station
in
germany
as
far
as
i
remember
italy
didnt
have
lego
sets
so
a
gas
station
close
to
the
italian
border
but
still
in
germany
or
austria
was
very
often
their
last
chance
i
often
saw
large
quantities
of
lego
sets
in
those
gas
stations
though
i
remember
seeing
yellow
castle
and
the
galaxy
explorer
standing
on
a
shelf
it
would
be
my
birthday
13
weeks
later
so
i
always
made
sure
they
knew
what
to
buy
for
me

time
and
i
have
two
sons
you
know
positive
as
you
may
have
seen
in
my
topic
in
general
lego
discussion
i
received
a
bunch
of
old
lego
from
my
stepgrandmotherinlaw
among
the
bricks
were
instructions
and
pieces
for
an
almost
complete
set
345
from
1969
i
was
very
excited
to
find
this
out
so
i
put
it
together
i
recently
took
it
apart
and
reassembled
it
taking
photographs
along
the
way
for
the
sake
of
eurobricks
so
without
further
ado
set
345
house
with
car
first
off
is
the
car
this
was
still
constructed
in
the
bucket
of
bricks
i
received
so
i
never
took
it
apart
next
ill
show
you
the
instructions
lots
of
added
bricks
per
step
which
was
fun
however
the
angle
of
the
instructions
sometimes
made
it
difficult
to
find
where
things
were
supposed
to
go
the
inbuild
shots
finally
an
allaround
view
of
the
finished
set
sadly
i
dont
have
much
time
to
post
more
pictures
or
thoughts
however
ill
try
to
come
back
and
update
the
review
later
this
week
until
then
enjoy
positive
great
review
i
never
had
this
set
but
it
looks
nice
i
really
like
the
checker
pattern
near
the
big
window
positive
way
before
my
time
tooin
fact
this
set
came
out
twenty
years
before
i
was
born
the
baseplate
doesnt
actually
have
dotsim
not
sure
if
they
were
there
once
and
then
rubbed
off
a
possibility
as
the
studs
are
rather
smoother
than
i
imagine
they
once
were
or
if
this
particular
one
didnt
have
the
dots
this
set
also
shows
that
the
difficulty
lego
has
in
doing
vehicle
scale
isnt
new
the
house
is
the
perfect
size
for
microfigures
from
the
lego
games
however
the
car
is
massiveover
twice
as
tall
as

would
do
a
pic
review
of
the
1st
lego
castle
the
yellow
castle
375
released
in
1978
first
let
me
say
that
this
set
was
truly
ahead
of
its
time
it
introduced
new
building
concepts
such
as
the
hinge
and
new
figs
most
were
still
the
armless
faceless
minifigs
during
this
time
this
set
introduced
me
to
castle
which
was
my
first
real
favorite
theme
i
enjoyed
breaking
it
out
from
the
garage
and
building
it
again
the
majority
of
the
pieces
are
1x1
1x2
1x3
1x4
1x6
and
1x8
standard
yellow
bricks
the
set
also
includes
yellow
1x4
1x6x2
and
1x8x2
arches
yellow
2x2
2x3
and
2x4
bricks
various
grey
plates
1x2
black
inverted
slopes
red
drawbridge
pieces
two
classic
red
castle
doors
8
hinges
2
for
each
corner
and
a
few
other
nifty
pieces
including
six
red
1x1
windows
a
complete
inventory
is
available
at
peeron
375
inventory
a
view
from
the
front
the
drawbridge
is
6x8
the
front
tower
stands
12
13
bricks
high
plenty
of
room
for
horses
the
drawbridge
does
work
the
string
originally
black
is
attached
to
the
opposite
side
between
a
plate
and
the
arches
the
right
side
of
the
castle
identical
to
the
left
ive
always
loved
the
2x2x3
sloped
bricks
and
corner
pieces
the
back
i
love
these
red
doors
a
1x4
brick
attached
to
the
other
side
of
the
baseplate
keeps
intruders
out
that
banner
was
the
original
sticker
piece
notice
the
wear
the
rear
tower
largest
of
the
towers
and
backside
two
hinges
at
each
of
the
corners
allow
the
corners
to
open
for
playability
before
opening
open
lots
of
arches
add
to
the
detail
of
the
inner
walls
inner
front
this
set
included
14
figs
how
about
that
for
quantity
unfortunately
i
peeled
off
worn
stickers
from
the
shields
and
the
breast
plates
years
ago
the
blue
castle
guards
and
knights
are
the
keepers
of
the
castle
i
still
think
that
these
helmets
are
the
best
lego
ever
made
they
just
look
good
the
black
and
white
knights
and
the
red
knights
ive
always
prefered
to
use
the
black
and
red
guards
and
flags
from
the
knights
joust
sets
conclusion
the
yellow
castle
is
truly
a
classic
set
and
im
so
glad
i
kept
the
pieces
to
this
together
after
all
these
years
if
you
have
a
chance
to
buy
one
or
even
obtain
the
set
instructions
its
worth
building
and
wouldnt
be
difficult
to
substitute
grey
or
other
colors
i
hope
you
enjoyed
this
review
and
feel
free
to
share
your
comments
positive
nice
review
i
havent
built
yellow
castle
for
many
years
but
i
do
remember
the
fun
i
had
building
it
when
i
was
young
yellow
castle
just
opened
up
an
entire
new
world
for
me
also
i
liked
all
the
alternate
models
on
the
box
od
wish
i
still
had
that
positive
theres
two
alternates
on
the
back
of
the
instructions
and
as
i
recall
some
sort
of
bridge
on
the
inner
fold
or
back
of
box
i
threw
away
the
box
to
this
set
years
ago
just
lucky
to
still
have
all
the
pieces
with
standard
pieces
you
can
build
all
these
alternates
and
many
more
thats
why
i
dont
particularly
care
for
the
new
castles
like
vladeks
they
make
building
so
difficult
and
duplicate
pieces
are
so
limited
heres
an
old
shot
of
the
castle
in
the
city
that
it
use
to
guard
we
played
for
hours
back
in
these
days
neutral
great
review
it
is
nice
to
see
an
indepth
photo
review
of
this
set
i
especially
love
the
last
picture
of
your
old
city
it
certainly
does
bring
back
memories
positive
question
for
you
guys
whats
the
best
way
to
clean
lego
i
was
noticing
that
the
baseplates
and
gray
plates
to
this
set
are
very
dusty
and
could
use
a
good
cleaning
mild
soap
water
soak
is
there
a
better
way
neutral
toothbrush
and
mild
soap
and
lots
of
time
gently
scrubbing
a
cleaning
and
great
review
i
love
that
set
wub
wub
im
sorry
that
you
seem
to
miss
the
stickers
if
you
find
somewhere
to
download
printable
copies
of
them

gyl
a

would
burn
the
plastic
sheet
all
you
need
is
a
white
or
transparrent
sticker
sheet
and
an
ink
printer
neutral
ive
tried
this
once
remember
normal
white
sticker
sheet
in
an
ink
jet
and
the
transparent
plastic
on
top
ps
the
one
on
the
right
is
the
homemade
one
neutral
heres
a
shot
of
a
custom
forestman
these
really
work
well
im
using
just
regular
sticker
paper
how
do
you
stick
transparent
plastic
on
top
neutral
i
guess
its
easiest
to
put
the
entire
shield
on
a
transparent
sticker
and
cut
the
edges
i
would
also
do
that
with
the
white
stickers
because
now
you
can
still
see
the
gray
edges
of
the
shield
perhaps
you
can
make
a
bigger
black
or
brown
in
the
other
case
outline
you
also
wouldnt
be
able
to
see
if
the
sticker
is
exactly
in
the
middle
neutral
as
stated
in
the
first
post
over
2
years

yes
it
is
this
is

review

looking
at
the

date
of
this
set
makes
me
remember
the
good
old
times
when
lego
sets
stayed
in
production
and
could
be
found
in
stores
for
long
years
yes
i
hear
you
younger
fols
say
this
meant
we
had
less
variety
at
the
time
but
at
least
we
did
not
have
to
go
on
a
frenzy
to
get
them
all
in
just
1
or
2
years
before
they
disappeared
to
reappear
on
the
secondary
market
at
crazy
prices
anyway
i
also
realise
this
set
is
older
than
me
by
5
years
at
least
the
first
boxes
of
this
set
i
think
my
parents
bought
it
when
i
was
something
like
12
year
old
or
even
before
as
my
father
really
liked
the
hobby
set
line
and
took
any
chance
to
get
one
you
know
for
the
kids
when
theyâ
$
™
ll
be
old
enough
to
play
with
themâ
$
¦
i
am
really
happy
my
father
did
it
too
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
has
always
been
one
of
my
favourite
nonminifigure
scale
sets
i
know
younger
eyes
will
look
on
it
and
wonder
how
we
could
love
and
enjoy
a
model
like
this
so
blocky
and
rough
just
remember
this
was
the
best
tlg
designers
could
do
with
the
bricks
available
at
the
time
enough
about
memories
letâ
$
™
s
start
with
the
review
the
box
front
the
front
of
the
box
here
cut
and
folded
to
save
space
shows
the
harley
davidson
1000cc
in
all
its
glory
upon
a
nice
town
landscape
i
really
appreciate
how
tlg
box
designers
used
a
real
life
photo
of
the
model
in
a
real
life
environment
to
give
this
hobby
set
a
better
background
moreover
the
landscape
does
not
distract
the
eye
even
with
its
lights
since
the
focus
is
strongly
set
on
the
motorbike
itself
back
and
sides
the
back
of
the
box
shows
the
model
on
a
more
neutral
background
and
from
another
angle
we
can
see
the
stickers
in
place
take
a
good
look
at
them
here
because
i
did
not
apply
them
the
right
side
we
also
see
a
pic
of
the
set
from
the
front
and
one
with
a
child
playing
with
it
in
this
latter
shot
the
model
rests
upon
a
nice
black
box
with
a
harley
davidson
sign
on
it
i
frankly
do
not
remember
if
this
was
some
sort
of
tray
or
smaller
box
within
the
lego
one
or
if
it
is
meant
for
publicity
only
another
thing
we
can
notice
on
the
rightmost
side
of
the
box
is
a
white
band
right
below
the
lego
logo
sporting
the
sign
â

in

really
well

contents
inside
this
set
includes
a
number
of
parts
in
mainly
black
white
and
light
grey
some
blue
and
yellow
add
nice
touches
of
colour
to
the
total
the
partsâ
$
™
selection
is
not
mindblowing
as
most
of
the
pieces
had
been
in
production
in
these
same
colours
for
years
anyway
iâ
$
™
d
like
to
focus
on
a
couple
of
details
the
milky
white
technic
axles
as
well
as
the
red
technic
bush
old
2
are
among
my
favourite
parts
the
bushes
in
particular
are
quite
useful
to
build
more
sturdy
looking
tubes
than
what
can
be
achieved
with
the
newer
and
slimmer
ones
it
would
seem
that
the
tile
pieces
appeared
in
the
â
$
˜without

$

version
as
a
standard
and
in
the
â

though
that

the
most

piece
from
this

of
you

is
the

this
kind
of

was

during

only
it
would
seem
tlg
tried
a
new

variant
which
did
not
meet
success
and
was
later
replaced
with
the
standard
bricks
again
nonetheless
iâ
$

m
sure
that
people
who
own
these
bricks
like
them
for
the
unusual
design
and
the
possibilities
they
offer
into

the

here
we
see
the
full
name
of
the
set

this
makes
me
wonder
why
is
this
set
known
as
394
harley
davidson
1000cc
when
it
is
indeed
a
1200cc
anyway
what
really
makes
me
love
this
page
is
the
list
of
stats
below
the
photo
and
in
particular
these
two
lines
hp
not
given
this
calls
for
just
one
question
why
did
harleydavidson
not
release
this
info
my
opinion
is
that
since
this
is
a
motorbike
built
for
the
police
they
did
not
have
permission
to
share
the
specifications
on
the
motor
which
was
probably
customised
either
by
harleydavidson
upon
request
or
by
the
police
themselves
â
$
˜random
pageâ
$
™
â
$
``
as
expected
no
callouts
here
but
the
build
is
pretty
straight
forward
and
does
not
need
them
apart
for
one
passage
weâ
$
™
ll
see
later
the
colours
are
easy
to
tell
apart
in
the
end
there
is
no
dark
grey
in
this
set
that
could
be
confused
with
black
again
notice
how
the
instructions
include
the
â
$
˜with
groveâ
$
™
tiles
and
not
the
older
ones
maybe
this
was
changed
during
the
long
time
this
set
stayed
in
production
the
â
$
˜last
pageâ
$
™
shows
other
four
models
included
in
the
hobby
set
line
unfortunately
i
own
only
one
of
them
the
396
thatcher
perkins
locomotive
indeed
i
would
have
liked
to
have
them
all
building
start
the
handle
bars
look
a
bit
too
squared
to
me
but
itâ
$
™
s
just
a
minor
feature
and
the
overall
shape
is
still
good
in
my
opinion
notice
the
red
hinge
plate
which
will
be
almost
totally
hidden
in
the
finished
model
see
below
and
the
blue
tiles
which
work
as
indicators
the
first
steps
used
to
build
the
front
wheel
and
windshield
are
really
easy
until
you
get
to
the
wheel
in
facts
the
instructions
do
not
show
clearly
all
the
pieces
needed
for
it
and
i
found
myself
with
a
â
$
˜floatingâ
$
™
wheel
for
the
absence
of
one
of
the
red
technic
bush
old
2
on
one
side
the
one
not
visible
on
the
instructions
of
course
not
a
big
deal
but
something
that
could
have
been
done
better
motor
and
seat
the
second
part
of
the
build
includes
the
motor
seat
and
â
$
˜saddle
bagsâ
$
™
the
technique
used
for
the
motor
or
better
the
radiator
is
very
clever
to
get
the
ridged
feel
tlg
designers
used
4
light
grey
plates
stuck
one
on
the
other
but
not
completely
in
contact
this
way
the
studs
while
keeping
the
plates
in
position
keep
them
raised
from
one
another
at
the
same
time
the
yellow
round
bricks
add
some
details
and
colour
touches
to
this
predominantly
light
grey
parts
of
the
vehicle
the
use
of
the
engine
smooth
small
1
x
2
side
plates
for
the
exhaust
pipes
while
quite
clever
still
looks
a
bit
strange
to
me
iâ
$
™
m
mostly
used
to
see
them
in
airplanes
helicopters
and
spaceships
â
$
˜saddlebagsâ
$
™
a
simple
build
for
one
of
the
iconic
parts
of
this
motorcycle
here
you
see
them
in
place
as
well
as
get
a
look
at
the
finished
seat
i
like
how
lego
designers
managed
to
make
its
shape
with
just
a
few
quite
big
bricks
the
â
$
˜saddle
bagsâ
$
™
are
a
really
nice
touch
and
they
work
perfectly
when
compared
to
the
original
this
is
the
rear
wheel
as
said
before
only
when
you
get
to
this
passage
in
the
instruction
you
get
a
real
understanding
of
how
the
front
wheel
is
supposed
to
be
mounted
as
well
careful
readers
will
notice
how
this
is
not
one
of
the
original
wheels
in
this
set
the
original
ones
were
mounted
using
the
technic
gear
expert
builder
9
tooth
unfortunately
i
could
only
find
one
of
them
in
my
collection
an
itâ
$
™
s
used
as
the
front
wheel
by
adding
the
rear
wheel
which
is
shown
from
a
better
angle
in
the
instructions
we
complete
the
model
notice
how
the
two
technic
bricks
supporting
the
wheel
are
held
in
position
by
two
2x1
plates
i
think
this
was
a
bad
case
of
â
$
˜building
by
compartmentsâ
$
™
mentality
if
tlg
designers
had
considered
this
a
bit
more
they
would
have
used
2
4x1
plates
instead
of
4
2x1
on
the
other
hand
this
is
not
the
worst
case
i
have
seen
in
a
lego
set
and
they
keep
up
the
tradition
nowadays
too
finished
set
front
and
here
it
is
our
fancy
police
harleydavidson
indeed
the
front
looks
blocky
and
quite
horrible
to
our
eyes
but
again
it
was
almost
the
best
that
could
be
done
at
the
time
i
only
wish
they
had
made
it
a
little
less
bulky
even
though
this
build
is
clearly
thought
to
give
better
stability
to
the
wheel
the
blue
tiles
work
nicely
to
emphasise
the
indicators
the
slightly
unsightly
red
plate
is
normally
covered
by
the
plate
sticker
and
the
windshield
albeit
being
hard
to
see
through
is
nicely
shaped
back
the
back
side
is
less
detailed
than
the
front
but
shows
the
red
light
and
antenna
which
are
typical
of
the
police
motorbikes
from
this
period
how
many
times
have
we
seen
this
angle
in
the
chase

from

side
all
in
all
this
model
looks
pretty
sturdy
apart
for
the
antenna
which
falls
off
all
too
easily
and
detailed
especially
considering
the
limited
variety
of
parts
available
and
used
at
the
time
they
even
got
so
far
to
put
a
2x2
tile
as
kickstand
to
display
it
without
fear
of
it
falling
on
the
sides
bonus
images
size
comparison
what
i
never
understood
about
this
set
is
what
scale
it
is
meant
to
be
i
mean
it
is
clearly
not
minifigscale
and
it
could
not
be
technicfigscale
those
came
later
but
it
is
not
even
miniland
scale
moreover
the
only
other
model
with
the
same
scale
is
the
other
hobby
set
motorbike
as
the
cars
have
a
scale
of
their
own
and
the
thatcher
uses
still
another
one
final
comments
overall
this
is
a
great
set
for
collectors
of
old
models
and
motorbike
fans
or
both
it
does
not
sport
a
huge
variety
of
bricks
but
was
a
good
choice
at
the
time
and
even
if
the
result
is
matteroffact
blocky
when
compared
to
the
original
it
implements
some
good
solutions

minimise
the

the

as
accurate
as
possible
apart
for
the
front
mudguard
maybe
and
the
colours
are
completely
in
line
for
a
police
vehicle
the
solutions
and
details
included
in
this

justify
the

why
not
playability
of
the

parts
810
not
a

and
very
few

nonetheless
a

this

my
father
assures
me
this
is
the
very
first
lego
set
i
ever
got
in
facts
he
gave
it
to
me
as
a
present
for
my
first
half
year
of
course
that
is
to
say
he
bought
it
for
himself
and
used
me
as
the
official
excuse
when
i
grew
up
at
first
i
found
it
to
be
quite
boring
no
minifigures
limited

features
in
the
end
it
was
just
a
locomotive
it
soon
went
to
forgottenland
then
when
i
was
about
10
years
old
i
one
day
found
again
the
instructionsâ
$

â
$
˜bookletâ
$

and
saw
this
bright
coloured
big
steam
engine
and
i
suddenly
wanted
to
build
it
again
it
would
seem
i
finally
got
to
the
right
age
at
least
for
me
to
appreciate
the
design
of
this
great
set
but
enough
about
memories
letâ
$

s
start
with
the
review
the
box
front
the
front
of
the
box
here
cut
and
folded
to
save
space
shows
the
thatcher
perkins
locomotive
in
all
its
glory
upon
a
nice
countryside
landscape
i
really
appreciate
how
tlg
box
designers
used
a
real
life
environment
made
of
sand
gravel
and
pebbles
to
give
this
hobby
set
a
better
background
moreover
the
landscape
does
not
distract
the
eye
since
the
focus
is
strongly
set
on
the
locomotive
itself
the
box
measures
about
395
x
245
x
55
centimetres
or
1556
x
965
x
217
inches
this
is
more
or
less
the
size
of
the
4840
the
burrow
or
the
advent
calendars
back
and
sides
the
back
of
the
box
shows
the
model
on
a
more
neutral
background
and
from
another
angle
we
can
see
the
stickers
in
place
take
a
good
look
at
them
here
because
i
did
not
apply
them
the
right
side
we
also
see
a
pic
of
the
set
from
the
34
back
and
one
with
a
child
playing
with
it
in
this
latter
shot
the
model
rests
upon
a
nice
black
box
with
a
thatcher
perkins
sign
on
it
unlike
the
harley
davidson
1000cc
set
the
thatcher

does
not
have
the
sign

for
some
reason
contents
inside
this

includes
a
large
number
of
parts
mainly
black
blue
and
red
with
some
nice
yellow
to
lighten
it
up
more
parts
of
interest
the
partsâ
$

selection
is
not
exceptional
but
weâ
$

ll
see
this
set
includes
some
unique
pieces
which
have
not
been
in
lego
sets
for
long
years
since
the
1980s
like
the
very
nice
black
plate
modified
1

spoked
for

the

large
as
beautiful
as
they
were
saw
the
light
from
the
production
line
for
the
last
time
in
1976
the
only
new
mold
used
in
this
set
is
the
black

blue
slope
inverted
45
2
x
2
old
type
with
round
bottom
tube
as
you
can
see
in
the
above
picture
this
locomotive
was
designed
to
work
well
be
played
with
on
all
kind
of
surfaces
so
the
wheels
sport
tyres
in
this
picture
you
can
see
how
they
look
without
the
tyres
of
course
builders
can
use
the
thatcher
perkins
on
their
brickbuilt
tracks

many

fans
will
not

familiar
with
the
last
two
parts
they
were
standard
fare
in
a
number
of
sets
between
the
1960s
and
early
1990s
but
then
unfortunately
they
were
taken
out
of
production
to
be
fair
the
replacement
of
the
black
brick
modified
2
x
4
with
wheels
holder
old
clear
bottom
with
the
standard
technic
parts
was
probably
due
to
the
fact
that
the
metal
pin
used
to
connect
the
wheels
to
these
bricks
had
a
shameful
tendency
at
getting
off
the
wheel
too
bad
it
could
not
be
fixed
and
these
parts
kept
in
production

those
interested

here
we

the

of

what

the

the

build
starts
with
the

the
use
of
this
â

technique
to
build
the
bumpers
lego
as
we
all
know
can
be
a
tricky
medium
to
build
with
and
some
details
need
special
solutions
to
be
completed
we
then
start
building
the
boiler
and
cabin
going
up
fast
and
steady
in
the
penultimate
step
we
build
the
chimney
and
cow
catcher
iâ
$

d
like
to
spend
a
few
more
words
on
the
chimney
and
how
it
is
attached
to
the
main
body
as
you
can
see
in
the
left
picture
the
3x3
base
of
the
chimney
is
asymmetrical
with
a
3x2
base
on
one
side
and
a
combination
of
a
1x2
and
a
1x1
plates
on
the
other
in
the
right
picture
you
see
the
top
of
the
main
body
where
the
chimney
will
be
attached
it
is
made
of
a
1x2
base
and
1
1x2
tile
using
another
â

˜illegalâ
$

technique
or
at
least
one
lego
designers
do
not
like
much
nowadays
the
holes
of
the
3x2
plate
of
the
chimney
will
connect
with
the
studs
of
the
1x2
plate
on
the
main
body
giving
a
well
centred
and
quite
sturdy
build

the

sports
3
big
headlights
a
nice
cow
catcher
and
the
nicely
detailed
engine
front
i
can
almost
hear
it
whistle
side
and
here
it
is
our
good
old
thatcher
perkins
locomotive
indeed
it
looks
like
a
classic
and
powerful
engine
form
one
of
those
spaghetti
western
films
doesnâ
$
™
t
it
what
i
found
strange
in
the
beginning
is
the
choice
of
colours
i
was
convinced
steam
engines
were
all
black
at
the
time
then
i
checked
some
pictures
of
the
original
and
i
must
admit
the
resemblance
is
almost
perfect
back
the
back
side
is
less
detailed
than
the
front
with
cabin
almost
devoid
of
details
i
think
lego
could
have
done
a
better
job
on
it
34
front
and
â
$
¦
just
see
how
good
it
looks
from
this
angle
with
all
the
tubing
moving
parts
and
the
lovely
3
headlights
â
$
¦
34
back
the
back
view
is
not
as
impressive
but
grants
us
a
good
look
at
the
big
posterior
wheels
and
the
bumpers
bonus
images
size
comparison
as
i
stated
elsewhere
i
never
understood
what
scale
these
hobby
sets
are
meant
to
be
they
are
clearly
not
minifigscale
and
they
are
not
technicfigscale
either
but
they
are
not
even
miniland
scale
moreover
they
use
different
scales
between
locomotives
cars
and
motorbikes
amongst
the
hobby
set
line
as
i
said
before
the
set
comes
with
tyres
on
the
wheels
to
allow
a
wider
playing
experience
not
limiting
this
model
to
tracks
nonetheless
builders
can
assemble
their
own
track
maybe
using
the
vintage
blue
45v
tracks
and
make
the
thatcher
perkins
run
its
proper
environment
final

this
is

and
its
a

you
still

you

excellent

btw
its
always
a

getting
a

look
at
these

sets
which
i
wouldnt

known
to

had
i
not

this

overall
i
think
its
a
really
good
set
at
that
time
of
course
judging
this
one
by
modern
standards
wont
be
fair
but
at
the
time
im
pretty
sure
it
was
a
cool
set
to
have
though
less
cooler
than
having
the
harley
davidson
set
positive
thanks
for
the
review
luxorv
an
interesting
old
set
though
i
find
it
hard
to
imagine
a
square
smoke
stack
instead
of
roundish
it
truly
has
that
classic
lego
simplistic
build
with
all
studs
showing

making
do
with

except
the
few

brick
on
everyone
positive
thanks
luxor
for
bringing
us
this
excellent
tour
round
an
old
classic
for
its
time
this
is
truly
a

and
beautiful
set
and
i
think
its
amazing
how

rare
classic

are
always
a
priceless
part
of
any
lego

and
its
a
good
thing
you
still
have
this

of
yours
luxor
or
did
you
purchase
a
new
one
excellent
review
btw
its
always
a
pleasure
getting
a
closer
look
at
these
classic
sets
which
i
wouldnt
have
known
to
exist
had
i
not
seen
this
review
overall
i
think
its
a
really
good
set
at
that
time
of
course
judging
this
one
by
modern
standards
wont
be
fair
but
at
the
time
im
pretty
sure
it
was
a
cool
set
to
have
though
less
cooler
than
having
the
harley
davidson
set
thanks
kiel
i
can
grant
you
thats
the
same
old
one
i
got
as
my
first
set
im
very

an

i
find
it
hard
to
imagine
a

instead
of
roundish
it
truly
has
that
classic

indeed
this

must
be
valued
in

to
its
own
time
and
style
i
was

making
an

for

this

round
an

for

this
is
truly
a
remarkably
detailed
and
beautiful

i
think
its
amazing
how
its
still
in

that
you
had

but
these
two
are
the
only
ones
i
have
for
now
maybe
other
members
will
be
ble
to
contribute
to
it
in
the
future
positive
thank
you
very
much
for
this
wonderful
review
this
is
the
oldest
lego
set
in
my
collection
i
received
this
model
from
my
grand
parents
many
years
ago
im
not
exactly
sure
who
in
my
family
it
used
to
belong
to
but
it
has
a
home
with
me
now
its
a
very
simple
but
attractive
looking
vehicle
and
functions
pretty
well
too
overall
very
nice
positive
thanks
for
the
great
nostalgic
review
great
pictures
i
love
the
shiny
glow
of
37
year
old
bricks
sets
were
simpler
back
then
but
not
less
exciting
in
their
own
way
i
wasnt
even
born
in
1973
but
one
of
my
first
sets
was
the
1982
update
of
this
6630
bucket
loader
almost
10
years
later
but
the
very
same
bucket
assembly
only
the
colours
have
changed
positive
nice
review
great
nostalgic
set
like
you
said
it
has
nice

yet
effective
i
like
construction

so
this

has
even
bigger
impact
on
me

ah
the
good

for
the
review
yoshi648
cute
and
cool
at
the

time
its
interesting
to
see
that
the
same
front
end
parts
had
been
used
from
the
early
70s
up
in
to
the
late
90s
nice
again
to
step
back
in
time
and
keep
on
bricking
everyone
positive
i
voted
outstanding
regarding
this
set
i
found
mine
at

it
was
inside
of
a

from
the

woah
25

really
love
those

clean

this
summer
positive
this
was
my
first
space
set
ever
1979
1980
dont
know
anymore
but
i
do
remember
i
got
this
together
with
897
for
my
birthday
when
we
where
camping
with
a
little
luck
i
may
even
have
an
old
film
from
my
dad
opening
the
boxes
well
what
to
say
it
looked
soooooo
aggressive
with
those
two
engines
but
i
never
knew
why
you
needed
two
steering
wheels
on
it
they
probably
just
thought
a
symmetrical
model
was
better
i
cant
blame
them
what
a
nice
set
it
would
even
sell
today
no
doubt
looooots
of
swooshability
positive
indexed
everyone
remembers
their
first
time
for
me
it
was
in
19coughsomethingsomethingcough
we
were
at
her
house
and
her
mother
was
gone
for
at
least
an
hour
she
slowly
unzi
uhhh
sorry
wrong
story
um
yeahh
anyway
i
do
remember
my
first
time
it
was
1977
in
late
summer
our
neighbor
who
worked
for
a
department
store
called
famousbahr
said
that
the
main
store
had
a
travelling
lego
display
so
my
family
filed
into
the
car
and
drove
into
downtown
st
louis
to
see
this
display
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
dont
remember
much
about
the
display
itself
but
i
do
remember
that
my
parents
bought
me
my
first

this

was

off

feel

i
even

i
have

the

came
in

be

i
cant
be
sure
that
there
even
were
plastic
baggies
that
the
parts
came
in
the
set
side
view
well
there
she
is
my
first
set
ever
actually
i
seem
to
recall
the
real
spirit
of
st
louis
was
silver
colored
not
black
and
yellow
if
you
need
a
history
lesson
the
spirit
of
st
louis
was
charles
lindberghs
plane
when
he
made
the
first
transatlantic
solo
flight
more
details
can
be
found
on
the
wikipedia
page
the
overall
shape
is
pretty
close
at
least
the
cockpit
window
could
stand
to
be
moved
forward
one
stud
but
everything
seems
to
be
relatively
close
the
tail
piece
isnt
the
right
shape
but
it
is
likely
the
only
tail
piece
lego
produced
at
the
time
if
you
look
closely
you
can
see
the
various
bite
marks
that
my
brother
and
i
inflicted
over
the
years
i
know
some
people
would
be
aghast
that
there
are
bite
marks
but
brick
separators
wouldnt
come
out
for
another
10
years
besides
we
were
young
we
didnt
know
any
better
i
certainly
had
no
idea
that
it
would
become
my
obsession
there
are
some
interesting
part
choices
here
everything
is
brick
and
plate
built
as
you
might
expect
the
same
set
nowadays
would
have
lots
of
slope
wedges
and
wedge
plates
to
round
things
out
but
lego
was
all
about
the
brick
in
77
so
bricks
are
what
we
got
the
black
inverted
slopes
worked
pretty
well
asthetically
as
the
wing
struts
the
wings
are
simple
4
x
10
plates
nice
and
square
there
were
no
minifigs
in
this
set
if
i
remember
correctly
1977
was
just
about
the
time
when
minifigs
made
their
first
appearance
i
know
i
have
one
other
set
from
77
that
does
include
a
minifg
at
least
i
dont
have
a
lot

kind

it
instead
i
took
a
photo
of
some
of
the
interesting

to
the

that
translucent

didnt

so

but
it
is
a

thats
right
sets
from

contained

are
the
forerunners
to
the

brick
as
well
everytime
i
hear
someone
on
the
forums
complain
about
technic
elements
in
system
sets
i
think
back
to
this
set
the
round
brick
is
special
as
well
here
is
a
closer
view
of
it
complete
with
bite
marks
round
brick
as
you
can
see
the

is
only
one
of
two
closed

that
i
own
they
stopped
appearing
in
sets
in
1981
for
those
that
are
interested
the
dss
you
thought
you
were
going
to
escape
this
heading
didnt
you
surprise
yes
even
in
1977
lego
sets
had
stickers
the
oldest
printed
elements
i
can
remember
were
in
the
classic
space
sets
that
started
in
1979
again
when
people
in
the
forums
complain
about
dss
in
sets
i
can
only
help
think
of
this
set
and
chuckle
to
myself
maniacally
the
sticker
has
held
up
really
well
considering
its
been
stuck
on
the
brick
for
32
years
no
discoloration
very
little
curling
i
think
if
all
stickers
held
up
this
well
over
time
there
would
be
less

the
overall
shape
is
quite
good

given

a

its
been
retired
for
30

its
going

cost
you

this
set
is
for
true
collectors
only
i
cant
imagine
anyone
wanting
one
because
they
want
to
play
with
it
it
was
a
great
set
back
in
the
day
but
the
design
feels
really
dated
and
if
youre
wondering
mine
is
not
for

ever
all
the

more
can

are
younger

the

i
think
you
will
have
to
have
grown
up
with
it

like
it
nowadays
we
have
seen
quite
a
few
better
airplanes

that

this

thanks
for
letting

trans

yellow

using

would
have
enhanced
playability

design
rather
than
this
ugly
black
round

its
the
reason
why
i

below

this

much
it
was
really
fun
to
build
it
im
happy
that
that
i
got
some
more
cherries
and
a
croissant
now
sweet
a
funny
idea
is
the
salad
in
the
one
box
at
the
front
i
think
normally
its
a
hairpiece
of
an
exoforce
fig
i
also
like
the
colours
of
the
house
the
dark
blue
is
sooooo
nice
i
think
i
have
to
take
more
of
this
soon
the
lighter
blue
is
also
nice
this
set
has
really
nice
details
like
the
stairs
or
the
owl
at
the
entry
of
the
market
or
the
balcony
i
paid
8999
eur
a
fair
price
for
a
really
nice
set
greetings
sandra
positive
thanks
for
the
great
review
sweet
now
that
ive
seen
the
set
im
afraid
im
a
bit
disappointed
8
1
the
color
combination
doesnt
really
do
it
for
me
blue
dark
blue
grey
black
tan
white
theyre
all
mixed
together
without
any
over
all
design
2
is
there
any
interior
it
doesnt
look
like
it
and
in
any
case
you
can
only
reach
it
if
you
remove
the
modules
hm
now
it
looks
too
much
of
a
box
3
there
are
most
certainly
some
nice
ideas
in
this
model
and
some
great
parts
the
best
part
of
the
model
is
the
staircase
4
i
dont
think
he
spent
much
time
in
thinking
about
the
design
as
apo
said
the
chimneys
on
top
of
a
garage
is
kinda
weird
theres
also
a
gate
next
to
another
gate
which
is
weird
as
well
also
if
this
is
supposed
to
ba
a
grocery
then
the
owner
has
done
a
lot
to
hide
it
the
croissant
is
nice
but
next
to
the
brown
box
with
vegies
theres
nothing
that
suggests
this
is
a
shop
5
the
white
lamp
and
the
the
yellow
cylinder
are
at
the
same
level
of
the
tiles
imo
it
should
be
above
the
level
of
the
tiles
6
imo
not
worth
the
90
euro

thank
you
legocastlegirls
for
your
quick
review
y
its
the
first
time
i
realize
the
back
of
the
market
street
the
tan
bricks
are
a
replacement
for
some
windows
id
guess
i
do
love
that
building
especially
the
top
floor
with
the
neat
balcony
wub
of
course
you
are
again
left
alone
filling
the
interior
but
i
just
had
some
food
parts
ordered
at
bricklink
xd
i
also
think
that
this
is
a
replacement
for
some
windows
and
i
like
this
idea
because
i
often
see
houses
with
that
kind
of
windows

i
am
totally
agree
with
snefreo1
the
yellow
cylinder
and
the
lamppost
should
be
on
a
level
above
the
tiles
actually
i
have
put
a
2x2
plat
under
the
lamppost
on
my
cc
looks
much
better
if
you
ask
me
yeah
i
also
agree
with
snefrooe
and
you
ive
never
seen
holes
at
the
footpath
for
some
lamps
it
is
really
dangerous
for
all
the
nice

minifigs

thanks
for

thing
that
i

that

im
not

this
looks
great
i
guess
this
is
the
closest
we
can
get
to
legoland
miniland
quality
sets
and
considering
this
is
a
three
floro
small
structure
and
its
over
1000

just
imagine
pun
not

how
many
peices
are

both
are

a

i
really
like
this

as
the
dual
stairs
the
balconies
the
croissant
insignia
the
market
entrance
design
with
the
horns
whip
and
owl

i
like
the
color
combination
and
the
mosaic
design
just
in

of
the
entrance
the
only
terrible
flaw
is
that
yellow
cinlinder
that
is
just
awful
for
a
flower
pot

i
dont
mind
at
all
having
that
lamp

it
would
be
normal
to
have
the
base
of
the
lamp
at

i
agree
that
is
just
pickering
about
an
insignificant

it
that
is

well
now
that
i
have
some
money
a
trip
to
toysrus
was
obviously
in
my
future
especially
since
my
local
tru
has
much
of
the
summer
2007
lineup
when
i
got
there
almost
all
the
smaller
castle
sets
had
been
sold
out
but
there
was
one
left
the
one
i
am
now
reviewing
for
both
eurobricks
and
bzpower
the
box
well
for
starters
the
castle
theme
boxes
are
beautiful
the
blended
clear
and
stormy
skies
give
a
great
clash
of
the
titans
effect
and
the
action
poses
help
as
well
the
back
is
equally
nice
featuring
a
photo
showing
kids
how
to
use
the
crossbow
and
the
brave
axe
wielder
taking
a
swipe
at
the
skeleton
foolish
soldier
that
wont
work
on
skellies
see
later
on
in
the
review
to
find
out
why
and
of
course
we
have
a
small
box
with
the
link
to
the
official
lego
website
where
tlc
can
advertise
even
more
lego
sets
p
the
contents
after
opening
the
box
a
single
bag
of
pieces
with
a
couple
loose
ones
the
instruction
manual
and
necessary
catalog
p
and
a
new
wider
rubber
band
holder
spilt
out
the
instruction
manual
is
clear
as
a
bell
no
color
trouble
here
folks
also
its
worth
mentioning
the
nice
background
with
the
mountain
and
kings
castle
silhouettes
sorry
that
theres
no
picture
but
ill
take
one
if
someone
wants
to
see
it
the
pieces
for
being
a
5
dollar
set
well
seven
in
my
case
darn
your
above
average
prices
tru
crossbow
attack
features
a
lot
of
nice
pieces
as
does
the
entire
castle
lineup
notable
elements
include
two
large
brown
spoked
wheels
two
brown
modified
1x1s
a
pearl
gold
slope
end
and
six
dark
blue
modified
1x1x23
slopes
the
bulk
of
the
pieces
however
are
nothing
special
ill
let
the
picture
do
the
talking
for
this
the
accessories
are
by
far
the
best
parts
in
this
kit
two
different
helmets
in
a
beautiful
shiny
silver
are
my
favorite
but
i
also
really
like
the
scythe
looks
good
for
mocing
and
the
round
shield
wub
which
are
both
brand
new
parts
and
can
anyone
not
love
the
classic
axe
and
crossbows
oh
and
theres
a
black
lightsaber
too
but
thats
rather
boring
compared
to
the
other
parts
p
the
minifigures
can
you
say
four
figures
including
the
horse
that
has
to
be
a
record
for
a
regular
5
dollar
set
at
least
in
the
present
age
of
limited
figures
per
set
well
start
out
with
the
two
crown
militia
a
regular
soldier
and
an
archer
both
have
old
faces
but
they
look
spiffy
with
the
shiny
helmets
and
the
superb
torsos
ill
name
the
soldier
bravo
the
stout
and
the
archer
angler
the
precise
for
future
references
now
we
come
to
the
skellie
although
some
people
dislike
the
new
skeleton
design
i
personally
prefer
it
to
the
old
ones
since
the
arms
are
now
poseable
and
the
face
much
meaner
the
only
problem
is
that
the
arms
hang
too
low
but
its
not
too
noticeable
when
they
have
weapons
in
their
hands
and
last
but
not
least
heres
the
elusive
skeleton
horse
i
for
one
am
very
happy
that
tlc
took
advantage
of
that
awesome
prototype
piece
and
made
it
into
an
official
massproduction
mold
however
the
horse
is
unfortunately
one
piece
but
since
regular
lego
horses
are
as
well
i
dont
have
a
problem
with
it
i
do
have
a
problem
with
the
pose
however
the
legs
are
in
quite
an
odd
position
and
i
wonder
why
tlc
didnt
make
the
front
and
back
leg
poses
symmetrical
ah
well
the
finished
set
i
have
only
two
pictures
here
since
this
set
is
so
small
first
heres
the
completed
crossbow
i
must
say
finally
no
more
ridiculous
horse
mounted
catapults
or
crazy
fire
wheel
launchers
now
we
have
realistic
siege
weapons
including
the
one
included
with
7090
plus
it
actually
launches
okay
although
not
the
best
heres
the
other
main
attraction
the
completed
skeleton
rider
and
horse
i
think
its
rather
dramatic
with
that
pose
and
the
dark
background
dont
you
think
playability
okay
so
theres
not
much
in
this
set
but
a
bit
of
imagination
brings
plenty
of
possibilities
to
show
you
what
you
can
do

i
recommend
it
to
any
lego
fan
whether
they
are
a
castle
nut
or
just
want
a
cheap
change
of
pace
tlc
has
a
knack
with
making
great
small
kits
these

i
more
than
ever
support
them
in
their
amazing
rebound
from
their
dark
ages

thanks
for
this
review
and
that
great
little
comic
about
the
skellies
though
xd
you
have
to
admit
that
besides
their
long
arms
making
the
skellie
legs
look
out
of
proportion
that
theyre
just
made
poorly
theyre
sticking
straight
out
as
opposed
to
every
other
fig
which
have
a
slight
bend
to
make
them
look
more
natural
also
as
im
sure
youve
noticed
the
pegs
are
on
angles
that
makes
it
impossible
for
them
to
hold
their
weapons
straight
and
they
cant
even
put
their
arms
over
their
heads
without
stressing
the
plastic
some
i
mean
theyre
dead
well
at
least
undead
theyre
not
supposed
to
be
stiff
and
personally
i
like
the
ragdoll
look
more
it
makes
them
seem
more
dead
p
negative
wow
that
was
both
an
entertaining
time
and
a
learning
experience
it
was
entertaining
because
the
comic
made
me
laugh
it
was
a
learning
experience
because
well
i
dunno
just
wanted
to
say
it
anyways

the

placed

fig

me
the

that

very
entertaining
d
love

positive
here
is
a
review
of
the
new
monster
dino
creator
set
with
power
functions
first
lets
start
with
the
box
which
is
much
larger
than
it
needs
to
be
it
is
one
of
the
new
style
recloseable
boxes
rather
than
the
rip
the
sides
style
this
set
is
typical
of
creator
and
comes
with
three
sets
of
instructions
the
monster
dino
a
kind
of
spider
and
a
crocodile
the
set
comes
with
two
of
the
new
motors
one
small
and
one
large
a
sound
module
plus
the
new
ir
controler
and
receiver
there
is
a
mix
of
techniques
in
this
set
the
core
is
mainly
studless
technic
there
are
some
studded
technic
parts
and
most
of
the
details
are
standard
creator
style
there
are
two
mechanisms
one
to
control
the
legs
and
one
to
control
the
head
and
arms
the
leg
drive
is
from
the
large
motor
and
the
arm
and
head
are
operated
from
the
small
motor
the
completed
mechanism
will
stand
on
its
own
without
any
detail
added
the
detail
is
added
to
the
base
unit
to
complete
the
model
the
operation
of
the
dino
is
very
good
the
design
for
the
motors
and
drives
is
very
compact
and
well
thought
out
the
walking
motion
works
well
although
there
is
no
steering
and
it
will
fall
over
it
it
encounters
obstacles
the
sound
module
is
built
into
the
head
so
when
the
mouth
opens
the
dino
roars
sort
of
glyman
made
the
comment
that
this
set
is
ugly
as
sin
and
i
tend
to
agree
i
think
there
are
too
many
colour
variations
with
different
shades
of
grey
black
and
that
lime
green
p
which
confuses
the
look
of
the
finished
model
but
i
guess
it
might
apeal
more
to
younger
kids
i
also
do
not
like
the
spikes
along
the
back
which
glow
in
the
dark
because
the
are
loose
and
keep
falling
off
this
set
is
not
cheap
at
70
but
i
guess
this
is
because
of
the
motors
and
ir
controller
while
on
this
i
was
surprised
how
good
the
range
was
on
the
new
controller
it
would
still
operate
ever
when
not
in
direct
line
of
sight
i
would
give
this
set
a
1010
for
playabilityit
has
kept
the
kid
amused
for
hours
i
would
give
it
610
for
value
for
money
it
is
a
bit
pricey
overall
810
it
took
approx
3
hours
to
build
and
has
been
well
played
with
i
have
posted
some
more
images
and
some
videos
of
the
finished
models
on
my
brickshelf

however
like

i
am

i
might
have
to
settle
with

ickelpete
i
saw
that

at
tru
a

was
really
not
interested
due
to
the
design
i
am
not
a
fan
of
those
motorized

i
guess
the
lime
colour
is
to
please
kids
as
well
as
the
general
design
far
from
a
real
dino
i
am
sure
that
its
going
to
sell
well
to
a
younger
croud
let
me
quote
you

the

works

there
is
no

it

fall

it
it

really

it
works

as
for
the
set
i
dont

the
colors
myself
surprised

it
seems
a
little
blocky
otherwise
the
set
is
cool
i
really
like
the
head
positive
ugly
as
hell
but
an
awesome
parts
pack
worthy
of
purchase
neutral
i
bought
this
set
last
night
and
it
is
great
my
biggest
surprise
was
the
wheels
that
were
included
i
didnt
even
know
they
existed
and
there
arent
even
that
new
back
to
the
set
he
is
such
a
cute
dinosaur
d
since
he
is
so
tubby
i
think
he
looks
like
a
baby
i
suspect
my
wife
wanted
him
more
than
me
my
biggest
interest
in
the
set
was
to
have
more
motors
and
ir
parts
so
i
could
make
an
ir
car
overall
i
highly
recomend
this
set
but
as
others
have
said
be
warned
that
the
box
is
very
oversized
i
wish
lego
would
give
up
on
this
whole
11
picture
thing
wacko
positive
the
box
is
has
really
strange
dimensions
its
very
flat
but
has
a
large
front
the
11
scale
regarding
the
spines
because
theyre
made
of
the
softer
nonabs
plastic
the
stuff
the
1994
cutlasses
and
brown
muskets
were
made
of
they
lose
their
shape
a
bit
and
so
are
hard
to
grip
they
simply
fall
off
i
suppose
tlc
use
loads
of
different
colours
because
a
single
or
twocolour
dino
isnt
very
nice
to
look
at
especially
when
the
surface
isnt
very
smooth
it
takes
your
eyes
away
from
the
surface
and
puts
it
on
the
colours
someone
should
make
an
all
terrain
dino
that
can
walk
everywhere
from
this
set
i
dont
have
the
skill
with
technic
i
always
end
up
layering
and
never
finish
any
models
negative
thanks
for
the
nice
review
its
butt
ugly
to
me
but
the
motors
ir

seem

high

it
looks

35
hours
here
we
go
with
another
offering
from
the
creator
line
im
kind
of
fond
of
these
sets
as
they
are
pretty
imaginative
and
usually
have
instructions
for
multiple
models
i
like
the
reusability
of
all
the
pieces
and
the
varied
things
you
can
build
the
box
the
box
that
lego
shipped
this
thing
in
was
absolutely
huge
when
i
first
got
this
in
the
mail
i
thought
i
had
won
the
lottery
and
they
had
shipped
the
ucs
falcon
early
once
i
opened
the
shipping
box
i
was
surprised
to
see
an
unusually
large
creator
set
box
the
box
itself
is
pretty
standard
creator
type
box
but
this
one
shows
off
the
power
functions
prominently
on
the
right
side
of
the
box
the
back
of
the
box
shows
some
of
the
motorized
features
as
well
opening
the
box
is
a
matter
of
breaking
two
seals
were
back
to
the
reusable
cereal
box
type
tab
system
for
those
of
you
who
stay
up
a
night
wondering
about
legos
next
box
design
inside
the
box
we
have
a
bunch
of
sealed
bags
immediately
the
power
brick
remote
and
motors
stand
out
as
they
are
each
in
individual
bags
also
there
are
three
manuals
the
manuals
the
three
manuals
are
76
76
and
56
pages
in
length
they
are
laid
out
well
and
are
pretty
standard
with
all
the
usual
trimmings
piece
call
outs
for
each
step
parts
inventory
at
the
end
of
the
primary
model
build
page
numbers
color
separation
in
these
manuals
were
fine
for
me
interestingly
the
instructions
for
the
primary
build
took
a
full
manual
plus
about
a
quarter
of
another
manual
random
manual
photos
parts
list
ill
explain
a
bit
more
below
but
it
would
have
been
nice
to
have
some
written
documentation
on
all
the
functions
of
the
motors
remote
and
receiver
such
as
motor
load
guidelines
and
specific
explanations
of
all
the
remote
control
functions
it
is
severely
lacking
in
this
area
the
pieces
obviously
the
pieces
were
most
interested
in
are
these
new
motors
and
wireless
remote
control
note
that
before
you
fire
this
bad
boy
up
you
had
better
byob
since
this
is
prominently
a
european
community
i
had
better
clarify
my
acronyms
over
here
across
the
pond
byob
usually
means
bring
your
own
beer
in
this
case
it
still
means
bring
your
own
beer
im
on
my
second
heineken
right
now
but
in
addition
to
numerous
bottles
of
beer
you
will
need
a
total
of
nine
batteries
to
get
through
this
set
i
kid
you
not
anyway
there
are
two
motors
a
small
and
a
large
each
with
its
own
very
unique
name
according
to
the
manual
the
smaller
one
is
called
motor
and
the
larger
one
is
called
xl
motor
very
creative
indeed
the
battery
box
takes
six
aa
batteries
and
there
are
two
compartments
to
hold
them
here
is
the
first
that
seems
pretty
normal
however
the
back
side
of
it
holds
the
other
three
batteries
and
it
seems
to
be
very
poorly
designed
note
in
the
photo
above
where
the
bottom
battery
is
placed
compare
it
to
the
previous
photo
and
you
will
see
the
difference
i
played
around
with
trying
to
get
that
bottom
battery
out
and
you
better
pack
a
lunch
or
byob
because
it
is
no
small
task
why
couldnt
they
make
this
compartment
just
like
the
other
side
there
is
a
single
power
cord
connector
and
a
three
position
switch
the
middle
position
turns
the
power
off
and
the
other
two
positions
seem
to
provide
the
same
functionality
in
either
position
as
far
as
i
can
tell
perhaps
a
little
blurb
in
the
manual
would
have
been
nice
to
clear
things
up
a
bit
the
remote
takes
three
aaa
batteries
it
is
fairly
small
and
lightweight
even
with
the
batteries
installed
it
has
two
thumb
controls
which
could
be
levers
if
you
insert
technic
bars
or
even
pins
the
two
controls
are
color
coded
and
match
the
plugs
on
the
receiver
to
control
two
separate
motors
in
addition
there
is
a
four
position
switch
which
i
assume
changes
the
channel
finally
there
are
two
tiny
levers
that
seem
to
have
no
function
im
not
sure
if
they
are
a
trim
control
or
variable
speed
control
i
messed
with
them
and
didnt
notice
any
difference
in
the
motor
speed
again
some
documentation
from
the
incredibly
verbose
lego
manual
would
have
helped
as
far
as
the
rest
of
the
parts
its
really
a
mixed
bag
there
are
a
lot
of
varied
parts
in
this
set
to
the
point
that
there
is
almost
one
of
everything
lots
of
technic
gears
pins
studded
beams
studless
beams
axles
wheels
etc
also
lots
of
little
1x1
slopes
in
various
colors
teeth
horns
etc
you
cant
really
say
it
is
a
parts
pack
because
there
is
not
enough
of
one
thing
to
make
it
a
parts
pack
a
couple
of
notes
it
seems
the
quality
control
issue
on
the
axles
has
been
fixed
i
initially
reported
this
back
when
i
reviewed
the
8285
about
a
year
ago
all
the
axles
worked
fine
for
me
the
color
quality
control
issue
is
still
alive
check
out
the
different
shade
of
red
in
these
two
parts
also
included
is
the
sound
brick
this
looks
just
like
the
other
sound
or
lightup
bricks
we
have
been
seeing
lately
it
does
have
a
load
dinosaur
roar
sound
embedded
in
it
though
so
hide
the
younglings
if
they
are
a
bit
on
the
skittish
side
finally
ive
never
seen
one
of
these
before
although
someone
will
no
doubt
rattle
off
a
dozen
sets
where
you
can
find
this
part
in
about
5
seconds
no
i
am
not
referring
to
the
studded
beam
i
put
that
in
the
photo
for
scale
the
build
the
build
was
fun
and
was
fairly
straightforward
as
i
mentioned
there
is
a
lot
of
technic
parts
so
if
you
are
not
a
fan
of
the
technic
line
you
should
run
not
walk
away
from
this
one
there
were
no
gotchas
to
speak
of
but
you
need
to
pay
careful
attention
to
the
placement
of
the
wires
that
go
from
the
motors
to
the
receiver
they
kind
of
sneak
them
around
a
bit
so
watch
closely
otherwise
it
was
fine
here
is
what
is
left
over
so
far
i
have
only
built
the
primary
model
as
seen
on
the
box
there
are
instructions
for
two
more
models
both
of
the
other
models
seem
less
complex
than
the
primary
model
and
are
likely
quicker
builds
the
dino
took
me
about
35
hours
which
included
some
time
to
screw
around
with
the
motors
im
an
old
school
technic
fan
from
way
back
in
the
80s
so
i
had
some
familiarity
with
the
old
technic
motors
obviously
25
years
has
improved
some
things
and
these
seem
much
more
powerful
the
design
if
you
have
built
the
4507
prehistoric
creatures
then
some
of
the
design
will
feel
familiar
especially
the
head
and
tail
it
is
almost
like
they
took
the
dinosaur
from
that
set
and
figured
out
how
to
motorize
it
this
is
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
just
a
comment
the
set
does
a
good
job
of
showing
off
the
features
of
the
new
motors
and
remote
it
is
nice
to
see
how
one
motor
can
perform
multiple
functions
in
this
case
the
small
motor
makes
both
arms
move
and
opens
and
closes
the
mouth
of
the
dinosaur
when
the
mouth
is
completely
open
it
pushes
the
activation
switch
on
the
sound
brick
which
emits
the
roar
sound
pretty
cool
the
xl
motor
handles
the
walking
feature
of
the
dinosaur
there
is
both
forward
and
reverse
forward
works
really
well
while
the
reverse
just
makes
the
dinosaur
look
like
he
is
doing
a
michael
jackson
moon
walk
wow
i
never
thought
i
would
use
michael
jacksons
name
in
a
lego
dinosaur
set
review
it
is
almost
like
the
dinosaur
cant
get
traction
going
in
reverse
however
as
noted
previously
forward
works
really
well
this
guy
actually
gets
going
at
a
pretty
good
clip
as
you
might
expect
he
kind
of
waddles
like
a
duck
since
there
is
no
articulation
in
the
knees
it
is
a
bit
awkward
but
it
works
the
xl
motor
seems
to
kick
out
plenty
of
power
overall
the
design
seems
to
be
a
mixed
bag
the
way
the
tail
is
attached
seems
to
be
an
afterthought
the
arms
look
to
be
too
small
however
the
walking
mechanism
and
legsfeet
are
pretty
cool
as
well
as
the
head
and
mouth
i
guess
it
is
a
reasonable
effort
to
get
people
introduced
to
the
parts
and
well
see
designs
improve
as
time
goes
on
here
are
a
few
views
of
our
new
friend
but
what
about
the
atat
of
course
the
real
reason
you
are
reading
this
is
that
you
hope
i
will
have
some
epiphany
on
how
all
this
relates
to
the
new
walking
atat
judging
from
the
box
on
the
atat
it
looks
like
we
get
one
motor
i
dont
see
the
remote
which
is
a
disappointment
as
i
hope
it
is
not
controlled
by
a
switch
on
the
body
and
you
either
turn
the
atat
on
or
off
if
that
is
the
case
the
first
thing
i
am
doing
is
scavenging
the
receiver
and
remote
from
this
set
to
add
to
the
atat
granted
it
could
be
that
it
comes
with
a
remote
but
is
just
not
seen
on
the
box
also
the
atat
box
looks
like
one
of
the
images
shows
that
the
head
turns
i
sure
hope
this
is
controlled
separately
as
it
would
be
really
lame
to
not
be
able
to
control
this
independently
from
the
walking
feature
im
kind
of
skeptical
on
the
walking
feature
of
the
atat
i
suspect
it
will
be
rather
cumbersome
but
hopefully
i
will
be
pleasantly
surprised
needless
to
say
this
is
all
speculation
but
those
are
my
initial
thoughts
based
on
this
set
overall
thoughts
its
an
ok
set
kind
of
pricy
but
i
suspect
a
large
part
of
that
is
due
to
the
motors
and
remote
i
havent
built
the
other
two
models
they
seem
less
interesting
to
me
but
at
least
it
has
some
variability
also
you
get
a
ton
of
different
parts
which
can
either
be
a
good
thing
or
bad
thing
depending
on
what
you
are
looking
for
the
dinosaur
is
average
the
color
selection
is
marginal
black
and
lime
green
and
the
tail
section
is
just
lame
i
appreciate
it
more
for
the
mechanical
functions
and
how
the
motorized
parts
work
it
does
do
a
good
job
of
waking
up
my
dog
who
seems
pretty
irritated
by
it
it
is
a
nice
set
to
show
off
to
the
neighbors
or
the
endless
caravan
of
my
wifes
friends
that
seem
to
materialize
out
of
nowhere
people
are
quickly
impressed
by
it
and
then
promptly
move
along
once
you
start
trying
to
explain
how
it
all
works
im
a
bit
disappointed
that
the
manual
did
not
explain
more
about
the
remote
and
motor
functions
i
suspect
that
there
is
more
than
meets
the
eye
and
ill
just
have
to
play
around
with
it
to
find
out
it
would
be
nice
if
lego
had
a
website
that
showed
all
the
cool
functions
of
the
motors
and
remotes
so
we
fully
understand
the
capabilities
final
rating
72
build
910
pretty
quick
and
fun
the
mechanical
part
is
cool
functionality
610
it
is
a
creator
set
so
you
have
multiple
builds
as
far
as
it
being
a
dinosaur
its
just
ok
motorized
parts
are
cool
though
design
610
partly
cloudy
some
things
are
cool
others
are
lame
parts
810
new
motors
and
remote
are
cool
lots
of
varied
parts
included
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
price
710
it
is
kind
of
expensive

i
really
dont

the

that

i

that
the

is
much
more
interesting

great

you

i
always

it
is

what
about
the
atat
in
case
you
dont

the
atat
in
the
dark
side
development
kit
had
a
single
motor
and
a
moving
head
it
worked
by
the
head
simply
swinging
from

due

i

the

that
there

oh

what
ive
never

meh
im

two

firstly
i
saw

then
my

said
shed
buy
it
for

for

neutral
i
ended
up
buying
both
this
and
the
dozer
i
plan
on
using
my
dino
for
a
ir
car
in
a
month
or
two
neutral
i
ended
up
buying
a
misb
set
recently
from
a
lego
collector
who
is
clearing
up
his
collection
excellent
set
to
get
the
ir
remote
and
ir
receiver
and
other
motors
without
paying
insane
amounts
for
the
bulldozer
now
there
is
a
quite
a
number
of
parts
in
power
miner
lime
green
and
1x1
white
teeth
plate
for
the
mouth
and
claws
the
dino
alone
has
20
teeth
in
its
mouth
the
glow
in
the
dark
antennas
on
the
backbone
of
the
dino
is
a
nice
touch
as
you
can
let
him
walk
in
the
dark
somewhat
i
do
agree
with
the
reviewer
the
box
is
insanely
huge
i
dont
think
lego
wanted
to
show
a
11
scale
dino
they
just
wanted
to
promote
the
power
function
stuff
as
large
as
possible
also
the
remote
is
smaller
than
shown
in
the
picture
as
the
hand
holding
it
i
think
is
smaller
positive
this
is
both
my
first
set
review
and
post
about
a
star
wars
set
even
though
i
have
been
collecting
them
since
99
i
got
this
one
early
this
year
so
i
thought
i
would
post
a
review
on
it

we
get
a
total
of
four
figs
i
like
the
two
atdp
pilots
and
agent
kallus
is
a
well
done
minifig
i
can
complain
about
another
storm
trooper
either
parts
35
other
than
the
dome
pieces
i
commented
on
before
there
is
really
not
any
new
parts
in
this
if
you
build
space
star
wars
or
machinery
this
will
still
be
a
welcome
assortment
experience
of
build
45
this
really
was
a
fun
build
it
came
together
fast
but
was
challenging
enough
for
its
target
age
group
playability
55
this
thing
is
much
more
sturdy
than
it
looks
the
legs
take
a
little
bit
of
effort
due
to
the
double
locking
hinges
but
hold
together
very
wellthis
is
a
very
minor
complaint
value
45
typical
4999
for
500
pieces
i
must
admit
i
paid
a
little
more
than
msrp
due
to
shipping
but
i
cant
complain
about
the
value
overall
2125
i
really
believe
this
is
one
of
the
best
walkers
that
lego
has
designed
the
only
changes
i
would
make
would
be
adding
real
control
panels
in
the
cockpit
and
it
would
be
nice
if
lego
made
a
real
widow
to
fit
in
with
these
types
of
builds
rather
than
a
transparent
tile
over
another
plate
all
in
all
i
would
recommend
this
set
and
i
hope
the
rest
of
the
2015
star
wars
sets
are
on
par
with
this
positive
looks
really
nice
one
complaint
is
the
back
it
is
a
pitty
that
lego
didnt
use
any
plates
greebling
there

for
the

pretty
good

review
this
looks
pretty
great
i
probably
wont
be
getting
it
due
to
budget
constraints
bionicle
but
still
very
nice
set
to
me
it
kinda
looks
like
the
missing
link
between
when
the
atst
evolved
into
the
atat
also
i
know
the
rebels
stormtroopers
get
a
lot
of
hate
but
i
really
like
them
thanks
for
the

whats
behind
the

that

im

i
have
two
questions
what
is
the

standing
on
when
the
hatch
is
open
and
he
is
looking
out
could
you
show
the
face
of
kallus
without
helmet
please
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
colours
of
both
kalluss
and
the
driverss
uniforms
are
wrong
kalluss
uniform
is
way
too
dark
and
should
be
more
dark
olive
than
black
and
the
driverss
uniforms
are
too
bright
and
should
be
more
greyish
compared
to
what
we
saw
in
the
series
here
are
the
pics

kallus

head
would

did
not

new

are
getting
so
much
more
advanced
than
what
they
used
to
be
neutral
i
built
this
set
and
i
think
the
two
rubber
pieces
holding
the
both
sides
of
the
face
is
a
bit
stretched
out
therefore
making
the
set
somewhat
tight
for
entire

close
does
anyone

the

was

25
years

this

added

as
its
title
sounds
its
been

this

to
most
of
you

the

at

whatever
people
call

have
gone

larger

in

the

isnt

the

i

its
more

less
the
same
size
as
mtrons
magnetiser
with
the
big
difference
between
the

being
that
the

sure
it

the

to
move

way

the

its

has
three
major
sections
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
modular
building
though
the
cockpit
is
the
first
section
its
spacious
and
detailed

the
cockpit
hangs
down
from
a
weird
angle
its
attached
to
a
large
vertical
technic
brick
that
is
part
of
the
rhinos
main
structure
so
its
not
a
seperate
spaceship
which
is
a
shame
oh
well
you
cant
have
it
all
i
guess

ah
yes
stickers
all
over
the
place
but
theyre
cool
the
mid
section
of
the
rhino
dominates
the
basic
shape
of
the
model
its
as
if
those
two
large
white
parts
form
a
strong
and
thick
shield
protecting
whatever
is
inside
from
whatever
is

unfortunately
there
is
nothing
inside
its
extra
space
needed
to
house
the
spaceship
thats
really
a
shame
a
command
center
of
some
kind
could
have
given
the
rhino
a
bit
more
panache

however
whats
really
great
is
the
way
in
which
they
fit
together
one
side
has
an
orange
1x2
plate
that
fits
in
between
two
white
1x3
plates
of
the
other
side
creating
yet
another
unique
shape
for
a
lego
model
but
again
its
a
shame
they
didnt
do
more
with
this
section

the
platform
itself
isnt
really
special
no
details
no
stickers
its
just
a
skeleton
to
carry
the
spaceship
nothing
more
nothing
less
no
your
space
ship
doesnt
fall
off
even
if
you
rotate
the
platform
into
a
launch
position
pushing
the
weight
of
the
ship
backwards
in
fact
the
position
of
the
ship
onto
the
platform
is
so
solid
its
kinda
difficult
to
imagine
how
this
ship
flies
off
the
ship
on
the
other
hand
is
pretty
cool
its
all
sorts
of
things
at
the
same
time
it
seems
it
transports
two
aliens
but
also
a
small
car
that
reminds
me
of
the
small
sets
of

the
shuttle
reminds
me
of
a
star
trek
shuttle
and
i
think
it
needs
some
modding
but
i
do
think
it
looks
pretty
nice
sure
the
cockpit
is
a
bit
too
low
a
pilot
needs
to
lay
down
instead
of
sitting
down
and
the
dropping
mechnism
if
there
is
one
at
all
isnt
all
that
brilliant
either
the
main
structure
is
a
bit
too
technical
for
me
i
prefer
actual
parts
with
studs
not
these
lego
technic
bars
and
pins

think
they
are

and
theres
also
this
weird
alien

i
didnt

great
innovative

lots
of

i
even
like
the
colors
sweet
lots
of

its
a
big
attractive
model
i
dont
see
any
weak
spots
in
the
design
that
could
compromise
stability
or
structural
integrity
not
so
good
too
many
technic
parts
some
sections
on
the
model
like
the
gun
and
the
drilling
device
are
a
bit
to
flimsy
id

758510

750

about
105euro
positive
thanks
very
much
i
love
it
wub
it
needs
tweaking
but
isnt
that
half
the
fun
incidentally
when
people
were
calling
it
rhino
i
thought
it
was
just
a
reference
to
captain
scarlet
seeing
the
stickers
in
the
middle
made
me
realise
my
mistake

positive
thanks
dude
this
is
a
great
set
can
you
please
take
more
pictures
thanks
positive
seems
like
they
infuse
system
sets
with
more
technic
bars
must
be
that
technic
isnt
selling
too
well
and
they
want
to
educate
ppl
how
cool
technic
can
be
p
its
quite
apparent
when
even
the
small
bike
needed
technic
frame
neutral
this
is
a
great
review
and
so
is
the
set
y
i
thought
i
would
buy
it
but
when
i
saw
the
price
i
changed
my
mind
xd
i
always
liked
flying
things
better
though
like
the
dropship
although
that
is
a
bit
pricey
too
i
guess
xd
neutral
this
set
is
truely
incredible
a
must
have
but
this
set
is
also
incredibly
overpriced
n
com
on
its
only
a
big
vehicle
nothing
really
special
to
justify
the
near
100
price
tag
this
set
is
clearly
worth
something
like
65
at
max
look
at
the
incredible
dropship
for
34
thats
a
good
value
for
money

for

that
vehicle
looks
really
nice
with
a

but
too
much
technic
brick
construction
for
my
liking
it
seems
like
theres
pretty
much
space
wasted
inside
of
it
some
kind
of
small
laboratory
or
a
room
for
the
crew
and
at
least
a
mining
toolshed
wouldve
been
cool

please
build

i

mod

overall
its
very

its

slightly

how

the

at

look

such
a

great

too
bad
all
my

my

is
planning
to
kill
me
positive
great
review
wonderfully
detailed
dont
care
for
the
ship
at
all
its
that
technic
under
a
hollow
shell
thing
like
the
ctt
if
it
wasnt
for
the
figures
i
would
have
hated
it
and
nothing
about
these
figures
excites
me
ill
end
up
finding
the
least
number
of
sets
possible
to
provide
at
least
one
of
each
figure
for
the
general
population
collection
and
skip
the
rest
unless
they
do
as
i
expect
and
flop
here
thus
leading
to
huge
discounts
i
like
this
set
at
half
off
positive
the
life
on
mars
theme
was
so
much
better
with
the
aliens
dominating
mars
instead
of
the
humans
and
the
aliens
were
so
much
better
with
their
own
names
etc
good
times
anyway
i
think
this
is
the
best
set
in
the
series
it
looks
so
neat
and
reminds
me
of
the
pelican
form
halo

i
think
the
life
on
mars
series
was
great
although
i
didnt
click
until
the
line
was
gone
that
the
red
hangar
on
the
alien
base
was
for
the
red
mech
and
same
with
the
blue
one
man
i
was
gutted
when
i
realised
that
i
want
those
mechs
however
the
base
was
great
with
the
small
mech
and
the
flying
crafts
could
the
lom
mechs
have
been
the
spark

lego

elsas
sparkling
ice
castle
lego
managed
to
get
a
frozen
licensed
set
in
the
new
wave
of
disney
princess
sets
however
im
very
surprised
by
the
size
its
a
40
set
and
comes
in
a
small
friendsstyle
box
roughly
12x12
size
i
almost
didnt
see
it
on
the
shelf
when
i
was
looking
for
it
because
its
so
small
i
mean
i
know
its
only
40
but
its
a
friggin
castle
and
why
did
lego
only
make
this
a
smaller
set
if
theyd
made
a
200
frozen
castle
they
still
would
have
sold
every
one
they
could
produce
they
made
big
harry
potter
hogwarts
sets
and
those
sure
sold
and
have
you
seen
the
toys
in
the
frozen
section
of
stores
huge
playsets
for
barbiesized
dolls
but
i
suppose
im
getting
the
cart
before
the

even

the
box
the
front
of
the
box
is
standard
lego
fare
other
than
the
large
anna
and
elsa
in
the
bottom
right
corner
oh
and
surprisingly
nowhere
on
the
box
is
the
normal
minifig
lineup
the
only
way
to
know
what
characters
are
included
is
to
look
at
the
set
pictures
the
11
this
set
uses
one
of
the
minidolls
as
the
actual
size
sample
thats
probably
not
a
bad
choice
since
the
minidolls
are
not
nearly
as
well
known
as
a
minifig
the
back
on
the
back
the
play
features
are
shown
in
insets
around
a
rear
view
of
the
castle
like
friends
sets
you
also
have
an
array
of
play
accessories
the
seals
is
this
standard
on
2015
sets
or
is
this
specific
to
this
set
ive
never
seen
3
tape
seals
on
a
set
even
huge
modulars
or
technic
sets
only
have
2
so
3
on
a
set
this
small
seems
excessive
perhaps
lego
expects
people
to
try
to
steal
the
dolls
if
so
why
bother
with
extra
tape
a
tiny
pocketknife
makes
quick
work
of
the
tape
so
the
third
strip
doesnt
even
slow
you
down
the
contents
in
the
box
are
2
instruction
booklets
bent
a
white
plate
a
sticker
sheet
and
3
numbered
bags
of
parts
the
stickers
these
are
very
hard
to
photograph
since
theyre
shiny
i
mean
polished
chrome
shiny
those
dark
lines
across
the
corners
are
not
really
there
theyre
reflections
of
my
ceiling
the
manual
backs
the
back
of
one
booklet
has
a
friends
win
girl
the
other
has
an
ad
for
the
lego
disney
princess
website
that
site
is
so
girly
theres
even
sparkles
following
your
mouse
cursor
around
so
i
didnt
stay
too
long
or
look
too
deeply
the
sample
page
the
interior
pages
of
the
manuals
are
on
lavender
backgrounds
its
standard
lego
instructions
with
part
callouts
and
insets
when
needed
the
build
1
the
first
thing
you
build
is
anna
but
im
not
showing
that
yet
then
you
build
this
little
picnic
scene
its
tiny
but
effective
and
nice
to
have
something
not
icy
in
the
set
since
the
movie
has
the
in
summer
song
for
olaf
im
curious
whats
in
that
sandwich
though
green
and
pink
after
the
picnic
is
the
olaf
build
but
ill
save
him
for
later
too
the
build
2
next
is
this
small
sleigh
it
has
an
amazing
amount
of
style
for
something
so
small
the
curved
front
and
decorative
whips
on
the
back
make
it
look
sleighlike
instead
of
blocky
but
come
on
it
already
had
pink
accents
are
the
pink
flowers
really
necessary
technically
yes
so
the
whips
can
mount
to
them
but
still
its
just
overgirly
for
my
taste
the
build
3
the
sleigh
needs
a
ramp
to
help
it
rocket
along
for
a
couple
inches
at
least
the
ramp
starts
like
this
with
a
hidden
lime
green
jumper
plate
that
gets
a
cookie
on
it
i
couldnt
remember
anything
in
the
movie
like
that
so
i
asked
my
wife
and
she
couldnt
either
a
hidden
cookie
under
a
hill
the
build
4
after
putting
the
tilting
2x8
onto
the
base
and
adding
decorations
this
is
the
result
a
lime
green
bucket
holding
a
pair
of
ice
skates
a
flower
in
the
snow
really
green
and
white
round
studs
that
i
assume
are
supposed
to
be
grass
and
snow
the
build
5
the
sleigh
looks
huge
sitting
on
top
of
the
tiny
hill
but
it
actually
works
pretty
well
assuming
youre
on
a
smooth
surface
like
a
table
you
can
give
the
sleigh
a
little
nudge
and
itll
shoot
down
the
ramp
and
a
few
inches
across
the
table
the
unevenness
of
the
slopes
vs
the
blue
tiles
holds
the
sleigh
in
line
well
and
the
bumps
in
the
slopes
dont
seem
to
hamper
anything
the
build
6
moving
on
to
bag
2
man
thats
a
lot
of
colors
in
this
base
already
and
im
already
starting
to
feel
like
theres
transblue
cheese
thrown
around
randomly
the
build
7
continuing
and
rotating
some
steps
and
even
more
colors
thrown
in
magenta
in
elsas
ice
palace
i
sure
dont
remember
any
of
that
the
build
8
wait
seriously
an
ice
cream
stand
in
the
castle
that
is
what
the
magenta
is
for
i
kinda
actually
like
the
looks
of
it
but
it
doesnt
fit
the
set
the
build
9
spinning
back
around
now
theres
a
light
aqua
spiral
staircase
added
along
with
a
roof
this
is
where
im
really
starting
to
wonder
about
legos
thinking
those
light
aqua
stairs
and
the
light
aqua
1x4
tiles
are
exclusive
to
this
set
as
far
as
i
know
its
possible
some
other
2015
sets
use
them
but
nothing
in
bricklink
yet
seems
expensive
to
produce
to
me
when
theres
no
huge
reason
to
need
them
another
blue
for
the
tiles
would
have
been
fine
and
the
spiral
stairs
really
elsas
castle
is
known
for
staircases
but
not
spiral
ones
there
should
be
a
huge
straight
ice
stairway
out
front
or
sweeping
curved
stairs
inside
but
not
a
spiral
the
build
10
and
now
we
finish
the
tree
again
why
where
is
there
a
tree
next
to
elsas
castle
and
so
weird
with
ice
hanging
from
green
branches
that
have
both
snow
and
flowers
on
them
huh
did
lego
watch
a
different
movie
the
translight
blue
bits
before
looking
at
the
upper
level
a
brief
pause
to
look
at
some
other
parts
heres
the
1x2x5
brick
in
translight
blue
and
the
2x4x6
rock
panel
in
glitter
translight
blue
do
those
look
like
the
same
blue
to
you
and
again
another
unique
part
for
this
set
why
do
those
rock
panels
need
to
be
glitter
when
lego
made
the
same
panel
in
trans
light
blue
in
2013
and
2014
for
superheroes
friends
and
chima
sets
apparently
disney
really
wanted
glitter
because
there
are
a
bunch
of
transglitter
parts
in

new
princess
sets
theres
transneon
green
cones
for
jasmine
ariel

all
get

theres
a
bunch
of
new
glitter
parts
for

the
build
11
back
to
building
time
to
add
the
upper
level
we
get
a
bedroom
with
a
decent
bed
although
stickered
the
build
12
the
other
side
of
the
bedroom
has
some
little
accessories
perfume
and
a
crown
i
assume
the
build
13
time
for
walls
and
a
roof
i
like
the
small
white
macaroni
bricks
for
a
wall
but
whats
with
the
lavender
fence
piece
in
the
center
ill
grant
that
it
looks
nice
a
common
white
fence
would
have
been
a
little
boring
but
its
another
unique
piece
to
this
set
the
build
14
the
very
top
of
the
castle
is
built
separately
not
a
whole
lot
to
say
here
other
than
why
is
there
a
torch
in
an
ice
castle
the
finished
castle
once
the
roof
is
put
on
the
castle
is
done
and
that
big
purple
star
on
top
says
everything
to
me
about
the
styling
it
just
doesnt
look
like
modern
lego
to
me
it
looks
like
this
should
be
an
old
belville
fairy
tale
set
from
around
1999
if
i
saw
a
photo
of
just
the
castle
with
no
figs
or
picnic
blanket
id
assume
thats
what
it
was
the
oops
not
actually
done
yet
accessories
at
the
end
theres
a
few
bits
left
to
add
there
are
these
dark
purple
skis
yup
another
unique
part
in
the
lower
level
let
me
tell
you
theyre
a
pain
to
get
into
that
location
at
least
with
my
big
man
hands
more
accessories
the
top
level
gets
a
stickered
book
the
sticker
has
a
nice
castle
image
on
it
that
is
while
not
quite
exactly
the
castle
from
disney
world
very
disneylooking
i
actually
had
to
google
and
see
if
thats
the
castle
they
use
in
their
logo
nope
but
its
the
same
style
the
leftovers
there
are
a
lot
of
extra
parts
in
this
thats
almost
10
of
the
part
count
in
the
set
right
there
they
are
pretty
useful
overall
though
its
great
to
have
an
extra
carrot
and
brown
branch
for
olaf
since
you
know
those
will
get
lost
as
hes
played
with
the
figs
finally
the
reason
for
the
set
lets
face
it
the
castle
set
is
just
an
excuse
to
make
these
figures
and
theyre
great
i
mean
just
fantastic
the
print
on
them
is
just
such
a
good
match
to
the
real
characters
compare
to
the
cartoon
version
from
the
front
of
the
box
elsas
hair
is
a
little
darker
than
the
cartoon
but
overall
these
are
just
dead
on
if
i
had
to
pick
out
a
flaw
its
the
spell
elsa
is
holding
its
too
bad
she
can
only
shoot
it
forward
with
her
arm
down
like
that
itd
be
nice
to
have
the
end
of
the
splash
part
bent
90
degrees
so
she
can
have
her
arm
forward
and
the
spell
shooting
forward
too
oh
one
other
thing
the
minidoll
heads
dont
press
down
tight
to
the
body
like
minifig
heads
do
theres
still
exposed
neck
it
looks
nice
but
it
means
elsas
cape
can
swing
around
the
fig
backs
elsas
cape
is
glittery
on
the
back
and
you
can
see
the
removable
bow
in
her
hair
the
full
set
one
final
issue
when
you
put
anna
on
the
sleigh
her
cape
doesnt
have
enough
flexibility
since
its
a
wraparound
kind
and
so
it
folds
out
funny
thats
why
on
the
back
of
the
box
it
shows
her
standing
on
the
back
of
the
sleigh
with
elsa
in
the
seat
edit
how
on
earth
did
i
forget
to
comment
on
those
orange
flowers
to
each
side
of
the
castle
im
pretty
sure
elsa
did
not
have
any
flowers
blooming
outside
her
castle
the
conclusion
hm
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
set
but
i
just
cant
quite
bring
myself
to
it
feels
like
lego
pulled
a
random
castle
design
from
the
files
then
redid
it
into
white
and
trans
blue
to
look
icy
and
allow
a
frozen
tie
in
set
the
figs
are
great
but
the
castle
isnt
i
guess
the
real
castle
in
the
movie
would
be
a
boring
set
and
this
one
has
play
features
but
it
just
is
too
different
for
my
taste
the
ratings
value
710
40
for
less
than
300
parts
is
high
especially
when
so
many
of
the
parts
are
tiny
but
on
the
other
hand
theres
a
lot
of
rock
panels
and
1x2x5
trans
blue
panels
but
the
figs
help
save
it
design
410
not
one
of
legos
best
not
as
bad
as
the
lows
in
the
90s
but
not
a
great
set
minifigs
1010
possibly
even
a
1210
they
are
the
reason
to
buy
the
set
playability
810
there
are
a
bunch
of
play
features
but
they
actually
detract
from
the
design
so
i
had
to
knock
off
a
couple
points
parts
710
a
bunch
of
impractical
unique
parts
how
often
do
you
need
dark
purple
skis
or
a
lavender
fence
piece
but
also
a
bunch
of
nice
parts
if
you
wanted
to
make
your
own
icy
scene
overall
710
a
great
bunch
of
figs
but
id
recommend
not
bothering
with
the
manuals
just
use
the
parts
to
build
your
own
castle
thats
better
neutral
two
of
my
daughters
are
building
this
as
we
speak
i
agree
the
design
is
a
lot
smaller
than
i
would
have
liked
but
theyre
loving
it
no
question
the
figures
are
the
real
draw
here
and
at
6
and
almost
five
years
old
theyre
doimg
a
good
job
building
so
far
at
least
for
the
46
range
in
my
house
this
set
is
a
home
run

for
the
great
review

i
managed
to
get
two
sets
for
my
twin
girls
for
christmas
and
would
have
to
agree
with
your
ratings
the
anna
and
elsa
figs
are
indeed
excellent
neutral
isnt
getting
parts
in
new
colors
a
good
thing
it
is
a
shame
there
is
only
this
one
set
i
think
tlg
could
make
a
whole
subtheme
out
of
frozen
i
do
agree
that
they
overuse
lavender
and
magenta
i
dont
see
why
every
girl
set
has
to
have
these
sort
of
colors
instead
of
what
would
be
accurate
to
the

cramming

they

seems
financially
unwise
for

rather
have
seen
a
larger
set
than
light
aqua
spiral
staircase
parts
or
lavender
tiny
fences
lego
made
the
stairs
in
dark
purple
last
year
for
rapunzels

those
probably
would
have
been
ok
here
or
make
them
in

color

white

thanks
for

i
too
wish
they
had
done
a
real
castle
for
this
set
it
certainly
deserved
it

sons

i
figure
they
could
have
used
the
old
rock
monster
mold
from
rock
raiders
in
white
for
the
missing
snow
beast
i
will
pick
it
up
though
for
the
figs
and
unique
pieces
positive
thanks
for
the
review
i
have
the
same
opinion
about
the
design
looks
like
belville
i
bought
it
on
legostore
orlando
december
30th
it
was
impressive
my
wife
saw
them
putting
on
shelf
8
or
10
boxes
she
ran
and
grabbed
the
last
one
the
girls
faces
around
it
was
indescribable
mix
of
ecstasy
and
afraid
to
loose
it
it
happened
in
less
than
2
minutes
my
7
yo
girl
didnt
want
it
she
likes
the
dresses
but
hates
the
movie
prefers
lego
movie
but
my
2
yo
girl
who
never
saw
the
movie
grabbed
it
for
good
and
we
bought
it
lego
will
sell
it
like
water
but
i
do
not
understand
why
a
set
so
small
it
is
the
worst
set
design
since
the
introduction
of
lego
friends
my
7
yo
has
more
than
50
lego
friends
minifigures
all
the
lego
fiends
stores
and
concluded
that
the
castle
had
a
terrible
design
she
is
7
lets
be
honest
lego
should
have
released
this
sets
months
before
this
christmas
and
is
loosing
a
perfect
opportunity
to
sell
a
decent
set
with
much
more
pieces
i
am
wondering
if
they
are
going
to
make
another
set
with
the
same
characters
at
the
end
it
is
just
for
the
minifigures
negative
when
i
first
saw
the
pictures
i
didnt
realize
that
this
set
had
so
much
color
barf
going
on
in
it
also
there
is
a
bunch
of
stuff
that
does
not
fit
in
with
the
movie
and
it
is
pricey
the
minifigures
are
nice
but
no
kristoff
or
sven
i
thought
about
getting
this
but
this
review
is
pushing
me
towards
no
negative
i
wish
elsa
had
more
of
a
white
hairpiece
rather
than
blonde
but
it
could
be
worse
not
a
bad
set
overall
although
olaf
doesnt
look
right
without
the
twigs
on
his
head
anna
is
a
really
nice
and
accurate
fig
positive
i
think
the
transglitter
blue
panels
can
be
icy
or
snowy
just
fine
im
sure
thats
why
they
used
them
for
this
set
now
if
youre
looking
for
realism
like
the
photos
in
your
sig
seem
to
be
it
might
be
tougher
but
ive
been
thinking
about
using
those
big
glittery
panels
to
make
a
waterfalltype
scene
positive
well
the
good
news
for
you
is
youre
in
luck
whenever
you
find
sets
since
the
figs
sell
for
a
good
bit
of
money
right

the

of

is

you
should

actually
summer
when
elsa
set
of
the
eternal

...
true
but
all
around
her
ice
castle
it
is
all
winter
so
why
are
there
nonwinter
bits
in
this
set
doesnt
make
sense
the
picnic
is
because
they
wanted
a
minivignette
for
olaf
to
fit
into

the
rest
of
the
green
and

dont

is
good
im
retooling
it
right
now
because
i
was
identifying
a
lot
of
cliches
so
i
threw
a
lot
of
plots
out
the
window
and
revisited
my
whole
concept
anyway
there
will
always
be
quick
wacky
reviews

thanks
brother
and
yes
please
take
your
request
and
stick
itback
in
your
heart
where
it
came
from
x
i
know
you
mean
well
but
i
love
the
camp
i
purposely
put
to
the
batcopter
and
my
favorite
the
jig
is
up
in
there
because
its
so
ridiculous
and
dont
you
know
requesting
me
not
to
do
it
will
only
encourage
me
to
do
it
more
i
annoy
because
i
love
wub
i
thought
you
would
like
it
i
am
pleased
to
say
that
i
didnt
know
that
the
jig
is
up
was
also
a
common
line
most
of
what
i
remember
about
the
old
batman
tv
show
actually
comes
from
the
movie
as
i
own
that
mum
bought
it
for
me
i
tend
to
put
in
on
if
i
have
friends
over
and
i
am
drunk
enough
i
like
the
darker
side
of
batman
only
and
thus
anything
that
is
against
the
idea
that
batman
is
as
big
a
loon
as
the
guys
that
he
hauls
in
i
dont
like
joel
schumakers
movies
fall
well
within
that

at

tomorrow

when
i
first
saw
pics
of

i
wasnt
sure
if
i
liked
it
or
not
but
after
seeing
it
in
more
detail
i
got
ta
say
i
love
the
thing
wub
its
a
great
plane
with
so
many
good
aspects
its
also
the
perfect
counter
vehicle
for
the
new
batplane
for
me
though
the
best
part
of
the
set
has
got
to
be
the
new
pumpkin
heads
those
are
just
beautiful
and
i
cant
wait
to
get
lots
of
them
positive
great
review
funny
as
allways
the
comic
was
just
a

it
really
had
me
laughing
i
would
love
to
have
this
set
but
the
price
is
just
to
high
here
far
worse
than
i
had
expected
ill
be
better
off
buying
the
battank
which
is

better

there
is
almost
no

450
and

indeed
you
should
just
buy
the
tank
comparing
the
price
of
the
tank
to
the
batwing
you
seem
to
be
getting
quite
a
good
deal
there
both
are
over
priced
for
australians
and
the
tank
is
twice
the
price
of
the
copter
they
are
60
aud
and
120
aud
i
am
still
not
sure
if
i
will
buy
either

out
of
nowhere
this
set
appeared
at
my
local
tru
hadnt
been
expecting
this
one
for
a
while
so
a
nice
surprise
sweet
firstly
the
box
nice
pic
on
the
front
good
selection
of
minifigs
the
officer
and
pilot
look
cool
with
their
dark
blue
trousers
a
new
r2
unit
as
well
dont
remeber
this
in
the
film
but
great
to
have
one
in
a
new
colour
wub
back
of
the
box
shows
some
of
the
ships
nifty
features
first
thing
you
notice
when
you
open
the
box
is
the
awesome
selection
of
bricks
this
makes
a
for
a
great
parts
pack
loads
of
unusual
red
and
dark
red
pieces
its
so
refreshing
to
see
a
star
wars
set
that
isnt
predominantly
grey
there
are
also
two
instruction
booklets
as
soon
as
you
open
the
first
booklet
you
hit
an
error
why
would
i
want
two
obiwans
its
also
at
this
point
that
you
come
across
a
big
disappointment
on
the
box
you
get
a
flesh
quigon
what
is
actually
in
the
box
is
an
epiii
obiwan
come
on
lego
why
change
it
all
the
figures
look
impressive
in
the
flesh
despite
the
big
mistake
once
i
started
the
build
it
progressed
rapidly
red
pieces
seem
to
be
a
lot
easier
to
find
lots
of
clever
techniques
quite
a
few
technic
elements
get
used
at
the
start
it
reminded
me
of
building
a
technic
set
from
the
80s
at
times
here
is
the
main
body
half
way
through
the
build
the
landing
mechanism
is
a
nice
touch
its
not
fully
retractable
but
still
folds
away
nicely
you
find
the
ship
keeps
tipping
over
as
you
build
it
despite
the
feet
as
its
only
at
the
end
thay
it
all
becomes
evenly
balanced
at
both
ends
here
the
feet
are
extended
you
can
also
see
the
yellow
knob
that
rotates
the
radar
on
top
of
the
ship
landing
gear
up
viewed
from
the
front
here
are
the
radar
a
great
collection
of
dishes
they
spin
easily
with
little
friction
here
is
the
ship
at
the
half
way
point
the
front
works
well
with
the
top
flipping
up
to
squeeze
in
the
pilot

come

part
2
the
second
half
of
the
build
goes
quicker
than
the
first
once
you
start
to
add
the
engines
the
ship
really
begins
to
take
shape
the
main
body
of
the
ship
has
a
few
surprises
hidden
away
under
a
removable
cover
inside
you
get
some
retracting
guns
a
storage
box
a
little
shuttle
and
space
for
a
droid
and
figure
here
is
everything
you
can
fit
inside
the
guns
are
concealed
behind
the
side
vents
pushing
them
forward
causes
the
vents
to
open
closed
and
open
the
final
feature
is
the
passenger
areaescape
pod
inside
is
plenty
of
space
for
two
figures
the
pod
cleverly
attaches
by
pushing
the
front
section
of
the
ship
forward
sliding
the
pod
in
then
returning
the
front
everything
locks
together
and
is
held
securely
in
place
by
an
elastic
band
heres
a
couple
of
pictures
of
the
final
model
its
not
the
most
beautiful
creation
ever
but
it
is
an
excellent
representation
of
the
ship
from
the
film
the
angular
shape
actually
suits
a
lego
build
well
theres
one
more
useful
feature
the
whole
ship
can
be
safely
and
comfortably
picked
up
by
two
ball
ended
technic
pins
towards
the
back
end
it
balances
well
at
this
point
and
does
allow
you
to
swoosh
the
ship
around
much
more
easily
this
was
the
most
enjoyable
star
wars
build
ive
had
in
a
long
time
everything
progresses
nicely
with
almost
no
repetitive
bits
the
ship
looks
good
and
is
also
huge
sweet
compare
it
to
the
6211
isd
and
youll
see
its
only
fractionally
smaller
when
i
first
saw
pictures
of
this
on
the
internet
i
thought
it
looked
ok
once
you
see
it
for
real
it
is
much
more
impressive
for
6999
in
the
uk
im
not
complaining
its
the
best
value
star
wars
set
of
the
year
so
far
to
conclude
pieces

set
design
810
overall

the
box
says
this
is
a
limited
edition
set
whatever
that
means
so
if
youre
planning
to
get
it
id
suggest
you
grab
it
at
the
first
opportunity
im
glad
i
did

as
for
the
set
the
thing
that
jumps
out
at

most
is
the
use
of
dark
blue
for
water
im
so
used
to
seeing
the

blue
for

that
the
dark
blue
seems

guees
that
theyre
on
dark
waters
you
can
always
put
some
trans
blue
and
trans
clear
1x1
round
plates
no
i
tried
that
technique
to
make
the
lava
using
trans
red
and
trans
orange
plates
it
looks
neat
regarding
the
human
soldier
thing
yoda
mentioned
its
quite
weird
like
him
im
going
to
swap
the
legs
so
theyre
coherent
with
the
soldiers
from
the
other
sets
third
note
is
it
just
me
or
did
you
attach
the
two
black
gate
pieces
too
high
shakar
neutral
not
sure
i
like
this
one
much
i
like
many
of
the
new
parts
but
the
boat
isnt
that
great
and
i
would
rather
get
each
seperately
so
i
can
avoid
the
whole
skeleton

no
i
think
this
is
correct
the
upper
plate
with
clip
for
the
door
is
a
little
high
on
top
of
a
dark
gray
1x1
brick
so
if
you
want
the
door
to
operate
well
you
have
to
place
it
like
that
i
just
put
the
clip
under
that
brick
a
very
easy
fix
so
my
door
now
is
lower
which
looks
better
imho
and
no
sneaky
skelly
can
crawl
along
under
it
xd
exactly
asuka
is
correct
also
keep
in
mind
that
the
picture
was
taken
looking
down
on
the
model
that
is
sitting
on
the
carpet
it
makes
the
gap
appear
a
little
larger
in
addition
for
those
of
you
that
recommended
ironing
the
sail
it
worked
great
i
set
the
iron
to
low
and
used
a
tshirt
to
protect
the
sail
it
flattened
it
out
perfectly
in
fact
it
worked
so
well
that
i
did
the
same
with
my
old
ww
weapons
wagon
cover
that
has
gotten
wrinkled
over
the
years
the
iron
worked
perfectly
positive
yes
very
nice
review
mr
brickster
i
think
i
for
a
change
like
the
castle
part
better
the
ship
doesnt
look
quite
right
to
me
if
theyre
gon
na
make
a
pirate
theme
with
ships
like
this
i
wouldnt
be
very
happy
but
i
think
the
ship
brings
some
nice
accesories
like
the
anchor
a
black
mid
piece
steering
wheel
etc
i
think
ill
buy
it
eventually

ok
here
is
the
set
alot
of
us
star
wars
fans
have
been
waiting
for
the
7666
hoth
rebel
base
wub
first
the
box
now
the
great
minifigs
that
stunning
k3po
fig
now
the
snowspeeder
aaaaggghhhhh
these
parts
are
all
stickers
now
for
the
turret
the
2
cones
on
the
side
press
in
to
fire
out
2
blue
lights
saber
blades
d
now
for
the
small
crane
thingy
yes
the
part
under
the
engine
on
the
snowspeeder
is
another
sticker
8
echo
base
well
the
front
door
anyway
d
the
main
control
room
d
again
these
are
stickers
on
a
tinted
clear
panel
and
on
the
slope
i
have
no
idea
what
this
is
meant
to
be
d
finally
2
shots
of
the
full
set
wub
well
over
all
i
really
like
this
set
and
think
it
is
great
value
for
money
the
minifigs
alone
would
set
you
back
more
than
the
cost
of
this
set
the
build
time
was
a
good
2
hours
or
so
and
was
good
fun
the
snowspeeder
is
not
as
good
as
the
second
snowspeeder
and
no
where
near
as
good
as
the
first
in
my
opinion
but
i
did
love
that
first
one
the
k3po
fig
is
perfect
and
it
is
good
to
be
getting
more
droids
that
arent
r2d2
and
c3po
it
is
a
shame
about
the
stickers
but
that
is
the
price
of
keeping
the
cost
down
i
suppose
the
only
printed
part
in
the
whole
set
is
the
snowspeederxwing
windscreen
i
will
definately
be
getting
atleast
another
3
of
this
great
set

hmm
that
shattered
base
looks
better
than
i
thought
a
very
playable
set
really
nice
for
the
snowspeeder
i
prefer
the
main
gun
design
of
its
predecessor
but
the
grappling
hook
gun
is
a
good
improvement
if
the
door
would
just
be
large
enough
for
it
p
positive
i
thought
after
the
kings
royal
castle
uproar
about
stickers
lego
would
have
gone
back
to
printed
bricks
obviously
it
is
all
about
costs
these
days
and
not
about
keeping
people
happy

yep
very

not

bad
might
have
to
pick
that
up
soon
then
i
will
be
in
tru
in
southampton
over
the
weekend
i
think
ill
buy
the
bigger
sets
here
and
get
the
smaller
ones
in
the
usa
later
in
the
year
the
smaller
the
boxes
the
more
chance
i
will
have
getting
them
in
my

i
have
to
say
i
am
very
glad
we
are
now
not
getting
a
11

between
the
numbers
used

in

vs

positive
excellent
set
the
snowtroopers
are
just
amazing
most
lego
imperial
troops
are
really
good
however
its
sad
that
except
from
luke
all
the
rebels
have
the
same
face
which
is
what
is
more
the
most
unexpressive
that
you
can
find
for
the
rest
the
quality
looks
excellent
the
snowspeeder
is
far
better
than
the
first
they
realized
but
only
one
thing
it
looks
a
bit
too
white
to
me
i
think
i
remember
they
were
grey
and
orange
rather
than
white
in
the
film
and
the
echo
base
door
is
really
cool
really
nice

review

24
hours
race
car
introduction
when
the
preliminary
images
of
the
le
mans
racer
surfaced
somewhere
last
year
2014
it
got
a
lot
of
praise
this
changed
dramatically
when
the
final
images
of
the
24
hours
race
car
showed
up
the
front
side
of
the
car
especially
the
head
lights
and
the
curvature
of
the
side
of
car
had
changed
a
lot
the
car
obviously
still
resembled
the
prototype
but
the
new
design
raised
a
lot
of
eyebrows
the
new
design
was
considered
a
step
back
instead
of
forward
eventhough
i
still
liked
the
design
i
must
admit
i
liked
the
earlier
design
better
too
with
the
emphasis
on
past
tense
liked
i
am
not
sure
anymore
and
this
review
will
show
you
why
like
the
arctic
truck
this
set
has
a
bmodel
which
is
well
worth
checking
out
thats
why
this
review
includes
both
the
amodel
and
bmodel
for
people
who
are
on
the
fence
the
bmodel
might
actually
convince
them
to
buy
the
set
after
all

gr
to
be

the
width
of
the

is
the
same
as
the
box
of
the
arctic

this
box
also
feels
like
its
filled
to
the
brim
the
front
the
front
shows
a
picture
of
the
main
model
in
action
with
radial
blurred
wheels
to
emphasize
the
motion
of
the
car
the
lower
right
section
shows
the
dimensions
of
the
model
upon
completion
it
will
measure
a
length
of
40cm
and
a
width
of
18
cm
the
back
like
the
front
the
back
side
has
exactly
the
same
setup
as
the
box
of
the
arctic

the
top
shows
the
functions
of
the
model
while
the
lower
left
side
shows
the
bmodel
and
the
lower
right
side
shows
the

options
the
picture
of
the
bmodel
looks
so
cool
it
could
be
a
model
of
its
own
at
this
point
i
was
very
eager
to
build
both
models
and
compare
them
the
side
one
of
the
sides
usually
shows
a
part
in
11
scale
this
time
its
one
of
the
wheels
indicating
the
size
of
the
model
content
of
the
box
the
box
contains
1
booklet
1
sticker
sheet
13
bags
4
tires
instruction
booklet
since
i
own
two
copies
of
the
set
i
also
received
two
instruction
booklets
whats
catching
my
eye
is
that
my
second
copy
is
supplied
in
different
packaging
than
the
first
one
its
for
the
first
time
that
i
am
aware
of
that
the
instruction
booklet
and
stickers
come
in
a
sealed
bag
without
cardboard
back
hopefully
this
will
be
a
new
standard
for
all
sets
with
sticker
sheets
instead
of
multiple
booklets
this
set
contains
a
single
square
bound
book
in
earlier
reviews
i
have
epxressed
my
preference
for
a
single
book
i
dont
see
any
advantage
in
having
2
3
or
even
up
to
6
booklets
sticker
sheet
like
the
actual
model
the
sticker
sheet
looks
very
vibrant
the
bright
green
white
and
black
color
combination
has
found
its
way
to
the
stickers
as
well
either
you
love
em
or
hate
em
since
i
started
writing
reviews
i
have
been
applying
stickers
and
i
am
happy
i
started
doing
it
stickers
do
give
the
model
its
finishing
touch
bags
with
parts
thirteen
bags
with
a
total
of
1219
parts
give
or
take
a
few
are
supplied
in
the
densily
packed
box
the
rims
and
flex
are
sealed
in
a
bag
as
well
sometimes
looking
at
the
bags
makes
you
wonder
what
the
logic
is
behind
the
distribution
of
the
various
parts
across
the
different
bags
well
this
time
it
really
got
me
confused
take
a
look
at
two
of
the
bags
below
theres
a
bag
containing
all
the
3l
blue
pins
then
theres
a
bag
with
various
partsand
a
single
3l
blue
pin
i
figured
this
might
be
an
error
but
both
of
the
sets
have
the
same
anomaly
tires
the
tires
have
been
supplied
unbagged
as
usual
highlighted
parts
this
chapter
describes
new
and
interesting
parts
this
set
actually
contains
a
lot
of
them
this
set
also
contains
an
abundance
of
panels
if
you
arent
into
panels
this
isnt
the
set
for
you
changeover
catch
this
year
2015
the
new
changeover
catch
parts
were
released
its
a
combination
of
three
parts
the
advantage
of
the
new
parts
is
that
the
red
gear
is
the
same
on
both
sides
which
avoids
mounting
it
the
wrong
way
around
it
also
avoids
the
changeover
catch
slipping
out
of
the
driving
ring
like
it
used
to
do
you
can
apply
lots
of
pressure
but
the
catch
doesnt
slip
out
pins
some
of
last
years
new
pins
are
also
included
in
this
set
12
x
pin
with
pin
hole
and
21
x
3l
pin
with
1l
axle
securing
technic
beams
can
be
quite
simple
with
the
new
pin
with
pin
holes
the
new
3l
pin
with
1l
axle
gives
you
more
possibilities
when
connecting
beams
and
other
parts
below
are
two
example
situations
where
the
new
pins
have
been
used
granted
the
examples
below
can
be
accomplished
by
using
other
techniques
however
some
predicaments
from
the
past
can
be
easily
solved
by
using
these
new
parts
like
me
you
will
most
likely
appreciate
the
ease
of
use
engine
and
suspension
also
included
are
two
steering
portal
hubs
and
steering
portal
hubs
with
ball
joint
arms
and
four
steering
portal
axles
for
driving
and
steering
the
vehicle
these
parts
are
commonly
used
nowadays
the
picture
below
also
shows
some
other
parts
like
gear
rack
steering
arms
and
suspension
frames
this
set
comes
with
a
single
5x7
frame
and
three
5x11
frames
panels
this
set
contains
a
whopping
47
panels
in
three
different
colors
i
personally
like
panels
a
lot
and
i
do
appreciate
the
variety
we
have
at
our
disposal
lately
this
set
even
contains
a
new
13x3x2
curved
mudguard
panel
new
13x3x2
curved
panel
this
is
the
first
set
to
contain
the
new
13x3x2
curved
panel
looking
at
the
pictures
doesnt
do
these
panels
justice
in
real
life
they
are
actually
quite
big
i
figured
they
would
be
smaller
but
they
are
even
longer
than
the
11
x
5
frame
with
a
length
of
13
including
the
attachment
points
hopefully
this
part
will
be
available
in
other
colors
as
well
preferably
white
for
adding
variety
to
your

dont
own
sets
like
the
8070
supercar
this
might
be
the
set
to
pick
up
if
you
want
to
start
building
your
own
supercar
the
build
enough
with
all
the
set
and
part
information
lets
build
the
model
rear
suspension
the
build
starts
with
the
rear
suspension
and
drivetrain
as
you
can
see
in
the
picture
below
the
length
of
the
axle
between
the
steering
cv
joint
is
4l
where
it
usally
is
3l
this
is
an
indication
that
the
finished
model
will
be
a
bit
bigger
than
usual
8070
for
example
the
finished
suspension
is
one
of
the
cleanest
suspension
setups
i
have
seen
in
an
official
model
its
pretty
basic
but
it
works
like
a
charm
this
setup
is
defintely
worth
using
in
your
moc
heres
a
video
after
attaching
the
suspension
to
the
frame
you
rotate
the
module
and
secure
it
at
this
stage
the
rear
section
of
the
chassis
with
suspension
is
almost
finished
v8
midengine
extending
the
chassis
forward
results
in
the
picture
below
where
the
front
spoiler
is
already
visible
whats
also
visible
is
the
v8
engine
placed
right
in
front
of
the
rear
axle
resulting
in
a
midengine
setup
perfectly
suited
for
sports
and
race
cars
two
exhaust
pipes
have
been
fitted
on
either
side
of
the
engine
together
with
two
hoses
attaching
them
to
the
engine
the
instructions
are
easy
to
follow
although
you
sometimes
you
need
to
bend
the
beams
a
bit
minor
improvements
are
possible
here
and
there
but
nothing
shocking
front
suspension
the
front
suspension
is
a
bit
more
complicated
than
the
rear
suspension
which
makes
sense
considering
the
fact
it
contains
the
steering
rack
the
shock
absorbers
are
placed
in
a
different
angle
than
the
rear
ones
resulting
in
a
somewhat
stiffer
front
suspension
all
in
all
the
front
suspension
is
well
designed
and
the
steering
rack
can
be
easily
powered
with
a
servo
motor
the
picture
belows
shows
the
front
suspension
attached
to
the
chassis
if
you
follow
the
official
instructions
to
motorize
the
model
the
area
in
front
of
the
suspension
is
used
to
mount
the
battery
box
when
you
are
modding
this
model
to
make
it
full
rc
this
area
can
be
used
to
mount
the
servo
motor
gearbox
like
the
gearbox
in
the
8070
its
not
used
to
switch
gears
powering
the
drivetrain
its
used
to
switch
between
two
functions
opening
the
doors
and
the
hoodbonnet
the
gearbox
is
located
at
the
left
of
the
vehicle
near
the
cockpit
the
mechanism
to
open
the
doors
is
located
on
the
left
side
while
opening
the
hoodbonnet
is
taking
place
at
the
right
side
to
accomplish
this
some
axles
traverse
under
the
cockpit
to
the
other
side
of
the
vehicle
following
the
axles
to
other
side
of
the
vehicle
and
adding
some
gears
results
in
the
situation
below
the
video
below
shows
the
gearbox
in
action
door
opening
mechanism
the
mechanism
to
open
the
door
is
comprised
of
some
knob
wheels
links
without
stoppers
and
pins
with
towballs
take
a
look
at
the
doors
opening
and
closing
the
front
using
the
new
mudguards
and
various
other
panels
you
finish
the
front
of
the
car
the
front
is
probably
the
most
controversial
part
of
the
car
this
is
caused
by
the
preliminary
pictures
shown
before
the
release
of
this
car
in
the
early
pictures
the
front
of
the
car
had
smooth
curves
and
beautiful
lines
while
the
final
car
lost
these
smooth
lines
and
got
a
more
blocky
look
in
return
i
must
admit
that
at
a
first
glance
the
new
design
lost
some
of
its
appeal
however
this
model
grew
on
me
pretty
rapidly
the
headlight
design
can
be
found
in
more
or
less
the
same
way
on
several
real
le
mans
type
race
cars
the
rear
the
rear
of
the
car
looks
great
with
the
stickers
continuing
from
the
mudguards
to
the
panels
underneath
the
spoiler
the
two
exhausts
sticking
out
give
some
details
to
the
back
i
absolutely
disagree
with
all
the
negativity
surrounding
this
car
maybe
its
one
of
those
models
which
needs
to
grow
on
you
finished
model
here
it
is
the
finished
model
i
know
some
of
you
dont
like
the
looks
of
the
car
but
i
think
it
looks
great
the
color
scheme
is
outstanding
the
new
for
technic
bright
green
parts
combined
with
white
and
black
make
this
car
look
very
vibrant
and
colorful
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
the
green
used
in
the
42008
service
truck
but
i
do
like
this
bright
green
a
lot
it
fits
perfectly
well
with
the
mindstorms
ev3
set
the
curves
on
the
side
of
the
car
are
not
as
smooth
as
some
of
us
hoped
but
i
still
think
the
car
looks
more
than
acceptable
from
the
side
the
stickers
add
some
nice
details
to
the
car
giving
it
that
characteristic
race
car
look
the
model
looks
great
in
pictures
but
it
does
even
look
better
in
real
life
i
love
this
picture
of
the
front
of
the
car
however
i
do
wonder
if
a
dedicated
24
hour
le
mans
racer
has
the
seat
and
steering
positioned
offcenter
using
the
good
ol
google
machine
i
come
to
the
conclusion
that
they
do
have
centered
seating
and
steering
at
least
the
majority
of
them
theres
ample
space
in
the
cabin
which
makes
me
wonder
why
tlg
decided
to
place
the
seat
offcentered
the
rear
view
looks
cool
too
with
some
of
the
suspension
showing
and
the
two
exhaust
pipes
clearly
visible
the
bottom
view
is
very
useful
to
determine
the
size
of
the
car
in
studs
it
measures
approx
59
x
27
studs
the
chassis
looks
organized
and
well
designed
the
engine
has
been
placed
close
to
the
ground
which
is
perfect
for
the
weight
distribution
a
low
center
of
gravity
improves
the
handling
of
the
car
i
really
enjoyed
building
this
baby
the
build
is
very
clean
and
organized
although
there
are
some
steps
where
you
need
to
bend
the
beams
a
bit
to
get
things
into
place
seeing
the
model
come
to
life
and
seeing
it
grow
to
pretty
impressive
proportions
is
very
satisfying
for
me
it
was
fun
but
i
reckon
kids
will
go
nuts
over
this
set
and
the
build
size
comparison
what
became
obvious
during
the
build
but
whats
emphasized
when
you
have
finished
the
model
is
that
its
quite
big
the
size
of
the
car
is
pretty
impressive
the
pictures
below
show
the
car
next
to
the
42030
volvo
l350f
the
side
view
emphasizes
the
size
of
the
car
its
even
longer
than
the
volvo
if
you
dismiss
the
bucket
parts
left
some
parts
left
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
features
and
functions
unlike
the
bmodel
this
model
doesnt
implement
any
unexpected
features
the
functions
it
does
implement
are
exactly
what
you
would
expect
from
any
car
steering
hog
working
fake
engine
suspension
opening
doors
gullwing
style
opening
bonnethood
opening
trunk
gearbox
for
switching
between
functions
unfortunately
the
steering
wheel
hasnt
been
linked
to
the
hog
hand
of
god
steering
mechanism
placing
the
seat
in
the
center
would
have
provided
an
easy
way
to
link
the
steering
wheel
to
the
steering
mechanism
its
a
shame
we
hardly
see
actual
steering
anymore
opening
the
hood
actually
opens
up
the
entire
rear
section
of
the
car
providing
you
with
easy
access
to
the
motor
compartment
the
mechanism
to
open
the
hood
works
properly
which
results
in
smooth
opening
and
closing
of
it
the
same
goes
for
the
gullwing
style
doors
both
functions
are
operated
manually
and
you
need
to
switch
with
the
lever
to
the
left
of
the
cockpit
these
two
functions
are
also
the
ones
which
can
be
motorized
by
placing
an
mmotor
near
the
cockpit
and
a
battery
box
in
the
trunk
all
things
considered
i
think
this
car
offers
lots
of
playability
the
model
is
solidly
built
and
the
functions
are
easy
to
operate
id
say
its
pretty
safe
to
let
your
kids
play
with
it
bmodel
unlike
the
amodel
the
bmodel
for
this
set
received
almost
universal
acclaim
and
i
can
see
why
often
the
bmodel
is
a
pale
shadow
of
its
part
donor
in
this
case
the
model
looks
so
good
it
could
be
a
model
of
its
own
it
even
incorporates
a
neat
feature
which
actually
deserves
to
be
in
the
amodel
theres
a
lot
a
variation
in
the
quality
of
digital
building
instructions
tlg
is
providing
but
these
ones
are
of
very
high
quality
the
picture
below
shows
most
of
the
chassis
with
suspension
fake
engine
and
gearbox
in
place
finished
model
some
concessions
have
been
made
but
overall
the
car
looks
fantastic
the
black
of
the
roof
has
been
extrapolated
from
the
hood
which
definitely
works
for
me
the
rear
section
of
the
car
feels
a
bit
empty
but
the
panels
do
cover
up
most
of
it
so
its
hardly
noticeable
the
v8
stickers
will
be
upside
down
if
you
use
the
parts
from
the
amodel
since
i
could
apply
new
stickers
i
have
placed
them
using
the
proper
orientation
the
bottom
of
the
car
shows
the
chassis
its
obviously
a
bit
smaller
than
the
amodels
chassis
features
and
functions
taking
the
functions
into
account
this
model
isnt
playing
second
fiddle
to
the
amodel
besides
the
obvious
functions
like
steering
opening
doors
and
hood
this
car
features
folding
fog
lights
which
deserve
a
better
podium
than
a
bmodel
steering
hog
working
fake
engine
suspension
opening
doors
manually
opening
hoodbonnet
manually
opening
trunk
operated
by
gear
folding

operated

gearbox
used
to
switch
functions
fog
lights
one
of
the
most
interesting
features
of
the
bmodel
are
the
folding
fog
lights
it
almost
feels
a
bit
weird
that
a
feature
like
this
is
implemented
in
the
bmodel
instead
of
the
amodel
below
are
4
steps
showing
how
the
mechanism
works
i
have
also
included
a
video
the
mechanism
is
somewhat
reminiscent
of
fork
mechanism
used
in
the
8109
flatbed
truck
which
has
been
described
in
effermans
review
take
a
look
at
the
video
to
the
fog
lights
in
action
parts
left
a
fair
number
of
parts
left
which
isnt
uncommon
for
a
bmodel
summary
to
summarize
how
i
feel
about
this
set
you
need
to
take
a
look
at
the
picture
below
the
combined
image
reflects
the
quality
of
this
setor
better
yetsets
you
actually
get
two
great
models
for
the
price
of
one
you
dont
like
the
amodel
no
problem
you
can
have
lots
of
fun
with
the
bmodel
i
cant
stop
playing
with
the
fog
lights
its
mesmarizing
the
color
scheme
on
both
models
is
outstanding
i
simply
cant
emphasize
enough
how
well
this
color
scheme
pleases
the
eye
the
regular
green
is
dull
and
boring
but
this
bright
green
really
pops
out
especially
when
combined
with
black
and
white
and
possibly
some
red
details
black
white
and
a
little
red
sounds
familiar
yes
bright
green
can
easily
be
combined
with
your
ev3
robots
so
while
you
are
combining
the
bright
green
with
your
robot
why
not
use
the
great
new
curved
mudguard
panels
these
new
panels
are
introduced
in
this
set
and
they
look
great
they
open
up
a
lot
of
possibilities
in
the
design
department
the
build
of
the
amodel
is
outstanding
it
is
fairly
simple
but
since
its
so
clean
i
really
enjoyed
it
a
lot
i
think
the
build
should
be
entertaining
which
doesnt
mean
it
needs
to
be
a
real
challenge
and
lets
be
honest
when
is
a
build
really
challenging
the
rear
suspension
is
a
good
example
of
why
i
liked
the
build
its
very
simple
yet
very
effective
works
like
a
charm
the
same
goes
for
the
other
functions
in
both
models
and
the
star
of
the
entire
show
can
be
found
in
the
bmodel
hows
that
for
a
surprise
being
aware
of
the
fact
that
i
like
this
model
a
lot
better
than
most
of
you
seem
to
do
i
really
encourage
you
to
give
this
model
a
chance
the
sheer
size
is
impressive
the
color
scheme
is
awesome
and
you
get
a
bonus
model
which
is
actually
worth
building
score
okay
so
how
do
i
grade
this
set

to

i

far

pretty
fine
positive
thanks
for
a
great
review
ive
got
a
pile
of
tru
and
lego
credit
i
wan
na
spend
and
was
thinking
about
getting
this
since
i
got
a
sneak
peak
of
your
review
in
the
academy
but
its
not
here
in
the
us
yet
too
bad
wonder
when
itll
hit
i
do
disagree
about
the
manuals
though
i
find
the
thinner
stapled
manuals
easier
to
use
than
single
large
squarebound
ones
since
they
lay
flatter
when
open
have
any
links
to
the
prelim
photos
of
the
front
end
i
dont
remember
seeing
that
and
was
curious
how
different
it
looked
positive
great
reviewi
am
still
undecided
whether
to
get
this
set
or
not
positive
great
review
i
see
now
why
the
b
model
is
so
popular
i
wonder
though
on
the
car
if
instead
of
the
panels
for
the
rear
spolier
or
wing
if
they
could
have
used
studded
panels
and
maybe
layer
them
to
give
the
appearance
of
ie
a
three
element
rear
wing
i
wont
mention
the
front
lights
if
i
had
the
money
i
would
buy
it
for
the
b
model
h
positive
i
think
i
read
somewhere
that
the
us
will
not
get
this
set
or
the
motorcycle
until
august
2015
that
means
the
flagship
most
likely
wont
be
in
august
but
even
later
in
the
year
nothing
bricklink
cant
solve
though
neutral
fantastic
review
jim
from
the
quality
of
the
review
alone
it
is
easy
to
see
how
much
hard
work
you
have
put
into
it
im
with
you
on
the
instruction
manual
i
much
prefer
one
quality
bound
book
over
umpteen
stapled
booklets
already
have
2
of
these
sitting
in
the
build
queue
one
for
display
model
as
im
a
fan
of
this
one
and
one
to
build
the
b
model
then
dissemble
for
parts
so
im
already
sold
on
his
set
but
still
very
much
enjoyed
taking
the
time
it
deserves
to
read
through
the
review
and
ogle
at
your
pro
photography
positive
great
review
with
fantastic
pictures
as
for
the
model
im
glad
that
they
chose
to
make
it
less
pretty
real
le
mans
prototypes
are
rarely
a
sight
to
behold
it
is
function
and
aerodynamics
over
form
i
would
however
have
preferred
more
realism
for
the
sake
of
learning
the
front
shouldnt
open
like
that
instead
it
should
be
easy
to
remove
the
whole
front
cover
leaving
the
suspension
easy
to
work
on
the
aero
seems
to

there
is

are

this
is

if
i
get
this

im
going
to
make
some
modifications
positive
this
is
a
mega
review
youve
taken
the
right
pictures
and
the
video
demonstrations
of
the
mechanisms
really
help
get
the
good
points
of
the
set
across
whats
more
amazing
is
that
the
review
still
feels
very
concise
and
to
the
point
youve
actually
convinced
me
to
put
this
set
on
my
list
and
not
just
as
a
decent

the

the

the

im
not

air
jacks
are
the
feature
that
will
have
people
fawning
over
this
set
and
pneumatics
are
being
covered
rather
well
later
in
the
year
but
i
agree
with
everything
else
most
notably
removable
front
and
rear
bodywork
the
removable
engine
cover
on
8674
would
be
a
good
starting
point
here
and
the
inclusion
of
some
nod
towards
a
hybrid
system
its
also
worth
remembering
the
preliminary
design
did
have
the
big
honking
fin
bhf
that
is
mandatory
on
all
current
prototypes
so
maybe
when
that
was
removed
any
trace
of
a
tunnel
or
diffuser
went
with
it
on
the
subject
of
steering
wheels
all
modern
prototypes
actually
have
left
or
right
hand
drive
the
regulations
demand
that
both
lmp1
and
lmp2
cars
are
nominally
capable
of
seating
two
people
of
course
in
practise
the
extra
seat
is
taken
up
by
the
hybrid
system
in
lmp1
and
electronicsextra
cockpit
access
in
lmp2
however
this
doesnt
change
the
fact
that
it
would
be
easy
to
link
the
steering
wheel
to
the
hogfront
axle

i
was
very
skeptical
of
this
set
because
i
really
thought
the
redesign
degraded
the
looks
of
the
amodel
a
lot
but
after
building
it
i
must
say
this
is
an
excellent
set
good
job
tlg
positive
im
still
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
model
but
this
is
one
awesome
review
the
effort
and
quality
can
be
clearly
seen
and
i
hope
you
continue
making
reviews
like
this
positive
ted
have
you
described
your
photography
setup
somewhere
i
love
the
crisp
quality
of
your
pictures
positive
great
review
i
think
it
look
like
a
great
set
both
a
and
b
however
the
panels
are
the
only
thing
i
would
need
but
still
a
great
looking
set
positive
a
very
professional
review
and
really
no
stone
unturned
but
im
still
not
going
to
rush
out
and
buy
a
copy
positive
awesome

i
love
the

dont
like
how

did
this
model

too
many

am
neutral
i
have
been
waiting
for
this
set
since
the
pictures
for
the
toy
fairs
eirlier
in
the
year
and
i
am
glad
to
say
i
am
not
disapointed
first
the
price
it
is
not
cheap
at
9999
but
i
guess
that
is
typical
for
a
set
with
this
amount
of
electronics
in
itthere
is
no
parts
count
and
i
have
not
had
time
to
add
up
the
2
pages
of
contents
to
get
a
figure
first
the
box
standard
flip
top
with
large
internal
picture
and
rip
to
open
lid
inside
there
are
no
numbered
bags
in
this
set
which
i
prefer
i
like
to
open
all
the
bags
and
put
all
the
parts
in
the
box
before
building
next
is
a
picture
on
the
electronics
2
xlmotors
as
lego
describe
them
and
2
standard
motors
2
ir
receivers
and
1
ir
transmitter
i
know
these
have
been
discussed
before
but
i
really
like
the
thought
that
has
gone
into
the
transmittersreceivers
each
receiver
has
2
outputs
to
corespond
with
the
2
controls
on
transmitter
they
also
have
a
choice
of
4
channels
so
one
transmitter
can
control
up
to
8
independant
motors
by
changing
the
channel
switch
the
transmitter
also
has
a
neat
motor
direction
switch
so
you
can
configure
the
transmitter
operation
the
set
comes
with
three
manuals
1
is
the
main
drive
mechanism
2
is
the
cab
and
engine
and
3
is
the
attachments
front
and
back
there
is
also
the
now
standard
parts
list
in
the
back
of
the
third
manual
there
is
no
alternative
model
instructions
despite
the
pictures
of
one
on
the
box
however
there
is
a
reference
to
the
technic
website
on
the
back
of
the
box
but
at
the
moment
the
page
only
has
an
advert
saying
the
set
is
to
be
released
on
1st
september
so
i
guess
i
will
have
to
wait
untill
then
to
see
if
the
instructions
will
be
online
the
build
is
fairly
straight
forward
the
main
chassis
is
studless
the
next
picture
shows
the
motors
mounted
into
the
chassis
and
the
drive
for
the
shovel
and
claw
it
also
shows
the
v6
technic
engine
this
next
picture
shows
the
ir
receivers
mounted
on
the
back
the
battery
box
slots
into
the
back
and
can
be
easily
slid
out
with
the
removal
of
two
pins
which
is
useful
because
i
can
imagine
i
will
need
to
change
the
batteries
on
a
regular
basis
the
next
2
picture
are
of
the
completed
model
overall
i
was
very
happy
with
the
finished
dozer
the
functions
work
really
well
and
as
i
have
the
monster
dino
i
have
used
a
second
transmitter
so
i
dont
have
to
touch
the
channel
switch
i
have
included
some
video
on
my
brickshelf
page
unfortunately
this
set
does
suffer
from
some
quality
issues
for
example
moulding
marks
on
the
plates
colour
diferences
some
of
the
pins
not
finished
properly
some
pins
were
very
stiff
and
quite
hard
to
push
into
the
holes
but
the
worst
issue
was
an
axle
that
would
not
turn
freely
in
a
hole
which
just
adds
extra
friction
into
the
system
i
am
glad
to
see
some
studded
technic
in
this
set
i
much
prefer
sets
that
use
both
varieties
of
technic
beam
there
are
only
2
fairings
which
is
a
great
improvment
over
recent
sets
if
tlc
had
tried
to
make
the
bulldozer
shovel
with
fairings
this
would
have
been
a
complete
disaster
marks
for
the
set
810
for
price
with
the
number
of
motors
i
expected
it
to
be
greater
910
for
fun
my
kids
love
this
type
of
set
that
does
something
when
finished
610
for
quality
tlc
really
need
to
work
on
this
one
810
overall
i
would
definately
get
a
second
one
if
i
see
it
in
the
sales
feel
free
to
post
questions
but
i
will
be
on
holiday
next
week

ah
mani
wanted
to
review
it
with
mine
oh
well
here
in
the
us
it
cost
150
and
has
1355
pieces
total
the
pins
and
axles
did
seem
a
bit
difficult
in
putting
them
into
place
a
problem
i
have
been
having
is
the
batterys
are
done
after
about
4
hours
of
play
which
i
really
wish
they
would
last
longer
overall
it
is
a
stupendous
set
and
it
is
really
nice
to
see
our
old
friend
the
studs
make
a
return
neutral
thanks
for
the
review
it
really
looks

i
must

prefer
the
8421
mobile
crane
for
more
or
less
the
same
price
the
design
is
more
sexy

cant

quicklyll
turn
into
an
everlasting

im
just
a

can

the
new
small
technic
sets
have
incredible
functionality
for
their
size
and
this
one
is
no
exception
with
only
106
parts
this
crane
can
roll
extend
rotate
lift
and
hold
in
any
position
and
has
working
stabilisers
the
boom
extends
the
same
as
the
other
sets
with
this
boom
simply
pull
it
it
works
surprisingly
well
and
due
to
circular
ridges
inside
the
boom
the
extension
which
is
just
a
standard
beam
will
hold
in
place
the
gear
at
the
back
controls
the
height
of
the
boom
as
you
can
see
the
boom
is
only
half
extended
boom
fully
extended
half
down
the
cable
is
kept
in
place
via
two
gears
and
a
blue
pin
same
as
the
7905
crane
even
under
decent
weights
this
works
well
the
stabilisers
however
can
not
handle
much
weight
once
the
load
is
moved
off
axis
the
stablilsers
are
a
very
simple
but
effective
design
another
shot
of
the
stablilsers
this
also
shows
how
far
the
boom
will
decend
the
boom
height
mechanism
works

ill
be
picking
up
this

for
sure
probbly
a
few
just
for
the
parts
but
one
question
what
crane
are
you
refering
to
that
came
with
7998
that
is
the
new
heavy
loader
and
it
didnt
come
with
an
any
crane

positive
alright
so
i
usually
do
quick
photo
reviews
when
i
get
new
sets
thats
what
ill
do
here
but
theres
quite
a
few
photos
so
i
thought
i
might
as
well
make
its
own
review
thread
so
i
got
the
kwikemart
by
paying
just2much
on
an
early
ebay
copy
i
think
its
worth
it
as
this
week
im
gon
na
be
super
busy
so
i
was
able
to
build
it
saturday
and
stuff
heres
my
video
review
i
think
its
one
of
my
best
well
lets
get
onto
this
photo
review
the
set
is
200
usd
with
a
little
over
2100
pieces
the
official
release

april
15th
for
vip
members

1st
for
everyone
else

lego
stores

my
flickr

the
minifigures

great
you

three
exclusive
minifigures
one

a
completely
exclusive
character
the
first
time
lego
has
ever
put
an
exclusive
mould
in
a
direct
to
consumer
set
and
you
get
three
of
the
series
most
popular
characters
in
their
normal
attire
for
those
who
missed
out
on
the
first
simpsons
minifigures
series
the
kwikemarts
exterior
is
loaded
with
lots
of
sticker
details
the
only
printed
detail
youll
see
in
the
exterior
is
the
dial
pad
in
the
phone
booth
which
has
appeared
in
some
other
licensed
themes
since
last
year
right
here
is
there
the
store
can
be
opened
a
simple
technic
pin
and
receiver
keeps
it
in
place
and
allows
for
opening
and
closing
the
roof
of
the
store
includes
the
garden
shown
in
the
paul
mccartney
episode
the
roof
can
be
slided
outin
once
you
open
it
with
the
hinge
part
heres
a
look
at
the
store
with
the
roof
removed
the
floors
are
a
nice
sand
blue
color
coming
with
8x16
thin
plates
and
for
the
interior
from
the
view
of
the
store
opened
with
the
hinges
at
the
back
that
i
mentioned
earlier
the
left
front
corner
which
includes
some
arcade
machines
of
bonestorm
and
great
white
hunter
an
amazingly
done
buzz
cola
soda
machine
juice
machine
the
checkout
counter
ect
the
right
front
corner
with
food
aisles
freezers
and
a
frozen
jasper
sticker
the
back
left
corner
which
includes
some
nice
coffee
kettle
builds
the
donut
tray
hotdogs
ect
the
right
back
corner
which
has
a
door
leading
to
a
very
small
hallway
that
only
has
a
mouse
and
cheese
in
it
the
hallway
leads
to
the
employees
only
door
in
the
back
and
its
very
hard
to
get
in
the
door
way
not
that
theres
anything
to
do
inside
there
also
included
is
clancys
copcar
which
fits
three
figures
heres
a
look
at
the
piece
list
in
the
instructions
click
on
each
to
be
lead
to
an
enlarged
version
of
the
pic
also
included
are
some
awesome
printed
pieces
and
two
unprinted
coffee
cups
honestly
i
think
this
set
is
perfect
the
price
is
fantastic
and
has
a
great
ppp
ratio
they
really
went
above
and
beyond
by
including
snake
in
this
set
i
honestly
think
its
better
than
the
simpsons
house
in
terms
of
accuracy
and
the
value
here
so
many
cool
pieces
printed
and
in
exclusive
colors
so
thats
my
quick
picture
review
hope
you
guys
enjoyed
and
id
love
to
hear
your
thoughts
positive
thanks

for

positive
thanks
for
the
review
i
cant
help
but
think
the
minifigures
are
the
weak
part
of
the
set
snake
and
apu
are
great
but
the
rest
i
dont
know
they
kinda
redundant
now
they
could
at
least
give
us
new
torso
printing
like
homer
wearing
his
jacket
or
bart
wearing
his
blue
tshirt
or
marge
wearing
her
coat
or
as
i
said
in
the
discussion
thread
id
have
included
jasper
in
cmf
series
2
and
a
frozen
version
here
overall
the
set
looks
kinda
smaller
than
what
i
thought
snakes
bag
needed
a
symbol
printed
because
it
looks
like
he
is
stealing
gargabe
pretty
good
review
overall

thanks
for
all

i

i
agree
but
so
many
people
were
complaining
about
how
the
simpsons
house
should
have
included
the
most
common
versions
mostly
because
the
eyes
or
whatever
so
i
think
lego
played
it
safe
and
just
included
the
normal
versions
it
makes
sense
since
series
1
is
gone
forever
and
the
common
versions
were
in
there
and
this
set
is
bound
to
be
in
stock
for
a
very
long
time
like
the
death
star
i
never
really
agreed
when
people
were
complaining
about
the
alternate
eye
prints
personally
but
i
guess
this
is
a
good
business
choice
based
on
previous
feedback

can
you
post
a
pic
of
it
next
to
the
simpsons
house
just
curious
about
size
comparisons
positive
incredible
set
thanks
for
the
pics
so
many
details
and
unique
prints
and
colors
im
not
that
into
the
simpsons
but
definitely
a
top
tier
set
positive
i
have
sooo
mixed
feeling
about
that
i
loved
the
simpsons
house
save
for
the
terrible
wall
in
the
homer
and
marges
room
but
this
so
far
is
inferior
in
almost
every
aspect
the
walls
made
of
panels
is
a
bummer
i
expect
a
d2c
set
to
be
better
that
this
60
stickers
the
same
thing
same
price
for
less
bricks
and
smaller
build
then
the
house
strange
coloured
bricks
on
the
outside
wall
some
ugly
mix
of
yellow
tan
panels
again
with
their
fronts
facing
towards
the
inside
of
the
shop
so
we
and
up
with
those
squares
all
around
the
walls
are
yellow
this
was
so
nice
lost
opportunity
to
make
it
in
some
other
less
common
colour
then
again
the
set
overall
looks
is
good
the
roof
is
a
nice
detail
the
shop
looks
actually
like
a
real
one
not
just
an
approximation
of
one
the
roof
tiles
are
in
dark
orange
we
got
newrare
colour
here
the
car
looks
interesting
to
build
just
like
the
pink
one
from
the
house
lots
of
nice
references
to
the
show
its
the
simpsons
definitely
a
must
buy
but
for
a
discounted
price
ill
try
to
find
one
with
maybe
damaged
box
or
afterdisplay

thats
actually
not
bad
sizing
imo
sure
it
looks
like
you
get
a
lot
more
with
the
house
but
the
kwikemart
has
a
lot
more
of
those
little
references
that
make
it
simpsons
i
agree
with
some
of
the
complaining
a
real
jasper
behind
a
transblue
panel
would
have
been
cool
you
could
always
bulk
up
the
roof
with
more
foliage
i
think
it
has
a
great
foundation
as
a
set
but
could
do
with
a
few
mods
to
make
it
better
thanks
for
the
pictures
i
greatly
appreciate
being
able
to
see
reviews
like
this
before
dropping
200
on
a
lego
set
negative
one
thing
that
may
justify
the
price
it
has
527
different
parts
if
i
counted
correctly
i
alway
heard
the
more
different
parts
the
more
difficult
the
set
is
to
produce
the
simpsons
house
already
had
an
astonishig
amount
of
different
pieces
but
this
one
is
even
more
extreme

i
like
this
set
a

better

60

is
just
incredibly
disappointing
it

quite
a

them

nice
review
im
building
it
need
to
finish
it
but
im
at
work
right
now
with
the
printed
piece
you
forgot
to
show
the
chocolat
milk
1x1
brick
which
is
exclusive
to
this
set
yet
it
isnt
referenced
on
bricklink
yet
only
the
blue
one
the
set
is
really
fun
to
build
with
a
lot
of
little
pieces
for
the
fridges
i
havent
put
the
stickers
yet
will
see
the
final
product
to
put
the
essentials
ones
positive
did
anyone
else
have
a
problem
with
the
piano
against
the
wall
of
the
simpsons
house
it
just
kept
coming
off
way
too
easily
and
i
was
getting
really
frustrated
with
it
sticking
out
and
not
fully
going
on
so
i
had
to
put
the
two
tiles
that
hold
them
one
place
over
away
from
the
wall
for
it
to
sit
properly
without
falling
out
i
think
i
might
put
snowball
ii
behind
it
since
cats
love
to
hide
underneath
or
behind
things
lol
but
just
curious
to
know
if
anyone
else
was
encountering
this
problem
with
the
previous
set

simple

exactly
right
that
baseplate
was
in

would
have
made

some
of

to
treat
us
to

part
of
the

was
a
base
for
ogel
versatile
plate
that
hopefully
hasnt
disappeared
completely
parapink
is
apparently
light
pink
on
brickshelf
so
i
guess
its
just
lighter
than
normal
pink
and
stopped
appearing

just
so
you
know

paradisia
back
who

a

totally
neglected
how

seen
a
single
show
so
i
only
can
argue
about
the
bricks
as
are
i
dont
like
all
the
sb
sets
because
of
the
inflationary
use
of
stickers
more
to
that
see
below
there
are
some
bricks
that
are
really
cool
like
the
bun
disk
but
i
wont
buy
this
set
just
for
single
bricks
i
do
like
the
color
selection
because
of
the
comic
strip
relation

using

such
a
clever
review
with
a
great

i
really
liked
this
train
set
and
it
adds
so
much
to
a
train
layout
especially
when
you
buy
multiples
tlc
is
throwing
away
a
potential
gold
mine
by
discontinuing
this
line
it
is
also
nice
to
see
those
beautiful
consistent
slopes
in

picture
it
really
is
sad
that
tlc
is
letting
quality
slip
they
dont
seem
to
be
responding
to
the
issue
they
way
they
did
the

perhaps
we

need

great
review
y
i
have
just
bought
my
first
9v
motor
and
you
have
convinced
me
i
will
buy
a
least
two
of
this
set
positive
yes
my
spongebob
fans
its
time
for
another
review
lets
look
at
our
bikini
bottom
map
and
head
strait
to
meet
miss
puff
at
her
boating
school
she
is
waiting
for
us
to
give
us
a
guided
tour
of
her
establishment
another
bit
of
sb
history
this
set
comes
from
the
following
episode
boating
school
spongebob
fails
his
boating
test
for
the
38th
time
what
a
freaking
retard
lool
hes
so
determined
to
get
his
license
that
patrick
decides
to
help
him
he
implants
a
walkietalkie
inside
sbs
head
in
order
to
cheat
and
tell
him
what
to
do
you
will
say
that
i
am
biais
but
i
really
enjoy
building
this
set
and
i
really
like
the
sb
theme
lets
hope
2008
brings
more
of
that
cool
spongieness
but
i
digress
here
are
general
pics
of
the
instruction
booklet
and
the
dss
g
there
are
loads
of
crappy
stickers
in
that
one
also
as
you
can
see
the
set
is
divided
in
3
polybags
shamelessly
but
nonetheless
wilfully
hehe
i
will
disregard
the
third
one
which
is
that
playability
crap
course
i
would
have
reviewed
it
but
since
it
involves
stickers
i
didnt
want
to
ruin
the
parts
and
without
stickers
it
would
look
dull
plain
and
ugly
it
does
look
crappy
with
so
imagine
without
so
that
review
will
not
be
100
complete
and
i
do
apologise
in
advance
but
how
many
of
you
would
have
build
that
and
keep
it
hehe
off
p
1
mfs
and
extras
i
will
start
with
the
really
cool
miss
puff
wub
the
fig
mind
you
she
looks
a
bit
stressed
no
wonder
that
sponge
menace
will
bring
her
to
the
hospital
once
again
hehe
as
you
can
see
that
mf
comprises
3
parts
the
small
blue
1x1
round
and
the
2
major
parts
yeay
another
great
stupid
looking
sb
i
love
those
idiotic
faces
3
different
sb
figs
and
3
idiotic
faces
hehe
you
never
can
get
enough
of
them
here
is
just
a
regular
patrick
too
bad
patrick
doesnt
have
different
expressions
the
pull
back
boat
car
nothing
really
to
report
except
the
fact
that
i
left
it
sticker
free
the
only
thing
i
built
from
the
third
polybag
is
that
pretty
cool
ancker
holding
tower
thingie
looks
great
in
a
lighthouse
set
hehe
yes
the
roud
tile
bouey
is
printed
its
the
same
as
in
sbs
bed
in
the
bikini
bottom
set
ok
its
time
for
those
two
great
buildings
the
lighthouse
and
the
school
pontoon
before
reviewing
them
individually
here
is
a
general
pic
2
the
lighthouse
one
of
the
main
reason
to
own
that
great
set
sure
it
suffers
from
accute
stickeretite
sad
but
d
t
worst
is
that
door
but
nonetheless
a
great
and
simple
building
great
whitered
colour
scheme
and
a
really
fantastic
2
turning
lights
i
really
like
the
yellow
top
of
the
lighthouse
it
adds
to
the
comic
atmosphere
of
that
theme
instead
of
having
a
more
plain
redwhite
only
the
rear
has
nothing
really
fancy
except
tools
to
fix
it
in
case
of
problems
hehe
the
only
thing
i
modified
since
i
didnt
build
the
third
polybag
is
that
i
got
rid
of
the
trechnic
parts
on
the
right
of
the
lighthoue
to
replace
them
with
regular
logs
all
hail
the
tower
king
d
3
the
school
and
pontoon
i
really
like
that
little
building
and
its
great
to
see
that
once
again
tlc
uses
the
amazing
dark
blue
color
its
really
a
simple
design
but
looks
fantastic
and
can
be
used
for
many
things
in
a
town
hehe
i
also
really
like
the
combination
with
those
dark
bluish
grey
slopes
the
rear
reveals
the
desk
stickers
on
the
wall
doh
and
two
clams
serving
as
chairs
really
like
on
the
show
its
really
great
to
see
that
tlc
stays
really
as
close
to
the
show
as
possible
the
pontoon
again
is
simple
yet
really
cool
and
effective
and
its
really
nice
to
have
2
lifesaving
boueys
the
only
thing
i
modified
since
i
didnt
build
the
third
polybag
is
that
i
got
rid
of
the
trechnic
parts
in
front
of
the
pontoon
to
replace
them
with
regular
logs
on
the
overall
i
think
its
really
a
great
set
apart
from
the
crap
stickers
i
think
tlc
should
have
ditched
or
simplified
the
third
playability
polybag
to
lower
the
cost
oh
well
parts
are
always
usefull
except
those
one
part
shitty
palm
trees
so
until
my
next
review
i
bid
you
farewell
my
spongebob
fans
and
i
really
hope
to
see
next
year
hehe
will
sb
get
his
drivers
license
one
day
for
the
sake
of
bikini
bottom
lets
hope
not
no
license
ever
on

positive
thats
really
a
great
and
overall
nice
playset
with
a
very
cool
mrs
puff
and
a
fine
new
spongebob
sweet
the
boating
schools
indeed
very
nice
with
a
beautiful
color
scheme
and
so
is
the
lighthouse
im
really
tempted
to
buy
a
second
set
just
to
complete
these
buildings
although
its
a
little
too
expensive
for
doing
so
and
it
wouldnt
even
fit
with
the
style
of
the
other
sb
sets
xd
wet

poor

privat
hell
on

positive
youve
done
it
again
yoda
great
reveiw
i
really
like
this
set
but
in
my
opinon
50
is
steep
considering
i
wont
actually
play
with
it
i
mean
half
of
it
is
a
track
for
peat
sake
ill
eventually
get
it
for
the
mrs
puff
figure
though
y
positive
i
like
this
one
better
than
the
other
one
for
parts
and
such
plus
im
generally
a
sucker
for
any
different
minifig
but
yeah
that
price
is
steep
great
review
though
positive
one
more
sb
face
yeah
wub
being
a

freak
i
really
like
it
the
trans
clear
blue
ones
rocks
y
im
getting
it
period
sb
on
copmike
positive
another
great
review
thanks
yoda
man
those
smooth
slopes
really
look
like
crap
when
on
a
roof
that
was
the
whole
reason
they
had
texture
in
the
first
place
ill
never
liked
those
they
feel
so
cheap
the
new
sb
head
is
great
and
can
mrs
puffs
legs
move
i
just
ask
since
her
feet
are
separate
and
in
figs
where
the
legs
cant
move
theyre
usually
one
piece
at
the
bottom
to
keep
them
from
breaking
off
the
set
looks
great
and
seems
to
have
a
lot
of
playability
positive
nice
review
im
not
a
big
fan
of
those
spongebob
figs
however
this
set
has
some
very
useful
pieces
this
is
actually
the
first
time
i
took
a
decent
look
at
a
spongebob
set
positive
yoda
i
dont
thank
you
for
this
review
and
after
the
chump
bucket
review
too
because
im
so
exited
to
have
them
that
since
i
ordered
them
from
sh
i
come
back
home
aftre
the
work
the
faster
i
can
with
the
hope
to
see
a
big
box
on
my
bed
and
this
even
if
i
know
that
it
tooks
more
than
67
days
to
have
my
order
this
mrs
puff
figs
is
really
really
nice
wub
and
this
3rd
sb
head
too
neutral
thank
you
yoda
for
strike
2
its
sb
again
sticker
alarm
x
but
this
set
is
better
than
chum
bucket
there
are
far
more
interesting
parts
if
you
dont
like
sb
especially
the
light
house
and
the
little
hut
with
the
wooden
pontoon
y
and
yet
again
another
set
with
smooth
slopes
and
rough
ones
too
bad
too
bad
if
i
just
knew
the
person
who
is
responsible
for
that
positive
nice
review
mate
the
set
looks
great
and
a
real
must
for
all
those
sb
fans
out
there
the
whole
set
scream
playability
thats
for
sure
which
is
great
because
lets
be
honest
theirs
gon
na
be
alot
of
kids
and
yoda
out
their
playing
with
it
p
xd
geezzzzz
what
is
it
with
all
those
bloody
stikers
this
set
would
be
soooooo
much
better
with
printed
pieces
instead
of
those
still
once
your
over
that
at
least
the
rest
is
ok
am
i
the
only
one
who
thinks
mrs
puff
kinda
looks
like
a
kinder
egg
toy
theirs
nothing
wrong
with
that
mind
you
yes
i
have
a
kinder

the
set
and
the
other
designer
sets
that
came
out
with

especially
4888
are
incredibly
well
designed
sets
i
wish
lego
would
go
back
to
doing
sets
like
these
as
i
loved
the
multitude
of
instructions
and
ideas
the
last
batch
of
creator
sets
had
zero
ideas
even
though
i
know
several
were
made
anyway
less
whining
more
review
the
lion
is
the
main
model
his
mouth
doesnt
fully
close
but
it
does
open
more
the
head
works
well
from
most
angles
i
love
the
dark
orange
bricks
great
for
rust
he
is
quite
solid
but
the
joints
take
the
weight
well
the
neck
goes
side
to
side
and
rotates
but
doesnt
go
up
and
down
the
body
is
built
in
two
parts
and
pinned
in
the
middle
with
what
is
left
you
can
make
what
i
think
is
a
hyena
a
silly
plant
moc
and
what
i
believe
is
a
vulture
there
are
also
instructions
for
a
few
other
models
including
a
bat
boar
and
a
snake
which
i
quite

roaarrrr

thank
you
for
the

i
also
bought
this
set
but
in
combination
with
4883
when
it
was
on
sale
50
hurray
at
sh
i
made
a
short
review
of
4883
but
wasnt
really
sure
what
to
tell
about
4884
so
im
glad
you
did
that
for
me
d
i
have
different
feelings
about
this
set
on
the
one
hand
i
love
the
lion
he
is
really
impressive
even
my
wife
not
known
for
being
lego
enthusiastic
asked
me
if
there
were
more
animals
of
this
kind
the
lion
is
restricted
poseable
and
the
colors
used
are
fantastic
wub
3
models
can
be
built
simultaneously
thats
great
on
the
other
hand
i
still
dont
know
what
to
do
with
these
rotation
joints
wacko
and
the
other
models
are
somehow
disappointing
compared
to
the
lion
i
seem
to
have
missed
the
little
lizard
i
put
it
on
my
to
dolist
like
all
the
creator
sets
great
parts
pack
but
wait
until
they
get
on
sale
xd
for
me
i
had
a
lot
more
fun
with
4883

do

that
most
of

are
not

i
made
the

there
is
a

the

the
minifigures
in
this
set
are
simon
masrani
and
an
acu
both
of
them
have
excellent
printing
on
the
front
and
the
back
the
gun
is
the
same
one
from
tlm
that
the
ssp
used
simon
masrani
is
the
only
one
with
a
double
sided
face
his
second
face
shows
a
scaredworried
expbbression
he
has
a
zipped
up
jacket
or
jumpsuit
with
a
shirt
underneath
the
acu
trooper
only
has
one
face
which
is
a
scaredworried
expbbression
i
would
have
a
scared
expbbression
too
if
i
was
about
to
get
eaten
by
a
dinosaur
he
has
great
detail
on
his
torso
and
legs
lets
take
a
look
at
the
vest
the
vest
is
the
same
mold
from
the
ssp
in
tlm
i
think
it
has
the
letters
acu
on
the
front
too
the
back
is
nothing
interesting
pteranodon
the
pteranodon
has
great
printing
too
the
colors
match
the
ones
that
the
pteranodons
from
the
movie
have
the
wings
mouth
and
head
are
a
rubbery
type
of
plastic
and
are
easily
bendable
it
uses
the
same
mold
from
the
pteranodon
in
the
2012
dino
line
heres
a
comparison
between
the
two
spare
parts
the
spare
parts
arent
many
just
a
few
extras
the
helicopter
at
first
the
helicopter
was
meh
when
i
first
saw
it
on
the
box
now
that
ive
built
it
ive
got
to
say
that
i
really
like
it
its
my
favorite
helicopter
of
all
of
the
ones
ive
built
its
sturdy
and
sleek
its
not
too
bulky
either
the
first
play
feature
in
this
set
is
the
net
launcher
it
works
pretty
well
not
one
of
my
favorite
features
but
it
does
what
its
meant
to
do
the
other
play
feature
is
on
the
other
side
its
a
stud
shooter
which
can
be
used
by
a
minifigure
you
can
put
it
on
their
hand
or
you
can
leave
it
there
and
let
someone
operate
it
the
shooter
can
fold
up
inside
the
helicopter
as
well
there
are
stickers
on
both
sides
of
the
helicopter
and
they
also
have
the
jurassic
world
logo
with
dino
marks
final
verdict
value
910
for
20
this
set
isnt
that
bad
the
parts
count
is
a
little
low
for
a
20
set
but
the
price
is
probably
because
of
licensing
other
than
that
its
a
great
deal
i
wouldve
hoped
for
maybe
some
bait
for
the
pteranodon
but
that
can
easily
be
fixed
design
910
i
really
love
the
way
this
helicopter
looks
its
sleekness
and
design
is
great
the
only
flaw
this
has
is
the
huge
net
launcher
its
too
big
in
my
opinion
minifigs
1010b
the
minifigures
are
extremely
detailed
and
it
even
includes
an
exclusive
minifigure
playability
910
there
are
many
things
you
can
do
with
this
set
the
swoosh
factor
is
great
and
so
are
the
play
features
parts
1010b
theyre
useful
parts
and
there
isnt
many
huge
specialized
pieces
in
here
either
overall
910
this
set
is
great
for
fans
of
jurassic
world
its
also
a
nice
parts
pack
theres
one
exclusive
minifigure
in
here
too
which
makes
it
even
better
having
a
little
fun
with
the
set
hope
you
liked
my
first
review
here
on
eurobricks
please
leave
any
suggestions
on
what
to
improve

the

out
of
the
three
plus
insets
of

c
versions
i
like
the
sortaeuropean
looking
backdrop
it
goes
well
with
the
styling
of
the
buildings
interestingly
the
main
model
is
shown
opened

for
play
while
the
two
insets
show
those
versions
folded
the
box
top
on
the
top
of
the
box
lego
helpfully
shows
that
with
3
of
these
sets
you
can
make
a
whole
street
the
box
back
on
the
back
you
get
to
again
see
all
three
versions
together
but
this
time
folded
its
a
little
creepy
though
with
those
clones
running
around
the
manuals
yep
three
actual
printed
manuals
theres
nothing
indicating
them
as
being
a
b
and
c
models
but
its
pretty
obvious
looking
at
the
designs
which
is
the
main
model
and
which
are
the
alternates
the
contents
bags
of
parts
and
two
plates
nothing
terribly
exciting
to
see
here
the
minifigs
nothing
new
here
but
two
nice
figs
nonetheless
well
bricklink
does
say
that
both
figs
are
unique
to
this
set
but
theres
not
any
new
parts
to
them
the
closest
thing
to
rare
is
the
female
head
its
only
in
this
set
2013s
dragon
mountain
castle
set
a
uk
store
grand
opening
set
and
one
of
the
2014
holiday
freebie
sets
the
faces
arent
that
unique
but
i
guess
this
exact
combo
of
two
faces
on
the
head
is
i
love
the
kid
torso
with
the
spaceman
on
it
the
minifig
backs
no
back
printing
on
anything
here
except
for
an
alternate
female
face
sorry
i
do
like
that
her
two
faces
are
so
different
though
thats
much
better
than
when
a
head
has
a
scared
and
a
more
scared
face
the
c
build
enough
with
the
basics
lets
build
im
going
to
review
them
in
the
same
order
i
built
them
backwards
since
you
can
tell
immediately
looking
at
the
3
designs
that
theyre
going
to
use
different
numbers
of
pieces
and
so
forth
i
figured
id
build
the
smallest
first
lest
it
seem
like
a
letdown
all
three
have
some
basic
similarities
the
two
plates
are
hinged
to
give
a
building
that
opens
for
play
they
also
do
have
interiors
which
you
can
see
starting
to
form
here
the
c
build
front
its
a
pretty
quick
build
so
its
done
already
heres
the
front
of
the
building
with
it
opened
up
like
this
it
appears
to
be
two
separate
stores
a
newsstand
and
some
sort
of
shop
you
can
enter
all
the
printed
tiles
help
give
the
newsstand
a
detailed
appearance
but
im
not
sure
why
theyve
got
a
100
bill
lying
on
the
ledge
the
c
build
rear
from
the
back
side
the
interiors
are
pretty
plain
the
shop
half
has
a
plant
in
a
jar
and
a
weird
chair
and
the
newsstand
just
has
a
register
the
c
build
sides
heres
the
two
sides
of
the
folded
building
on
the
hinge
side
theres
a
bunch
of
windows
in
a
disjointed
wall
with
random
colors
on
the
other
why
did
they
put
in
a
huge
window
when
the
set
does
include
a
transclear
door
that
could
have
gone
there
and
you
get
a
small
patch
of
plants
like
so
many
sets
seem
to
have
these
days
the
c
build
extras
thats
a
lot
of
leftovers
there
and
not
just
little
stuff
multiple
doors
stairs
etc
and
unused
sand
green
is
always
a
little
sad
the
b
build
1
a
pretty
similar
start
with
the
hinge
and
little
garden
and
some
tiles
along
the
ground
the
b
build
2
now
we
see
a
big
windowed
wall
some
details
like
lights
and
how
it
has
the
usual
alternate
model
weird
part
usage
like
a
1x4
brick
with
side
studs
being
used
over
the
doorway
even
though
those
side
studs
will
not
get
used
the
b
build
front
the
finished
building
gives
us
a
nice
little
post
office
with
a
lettercarrying
bird
on
the
roof
hope
thats
not
their
normal
method
of
delivery
something
about
the
colors
just
doesnt
work
for
me
though
the
combo
of
white
light
grey
dark
grey
black
sand
green
plus
tan
is
just
too
much
the
tan
window
and
door
frames
i
dont
like
the
b
build
inside
on
the
inside
things
are
weird
the
counter
on
the
left
is
ok
but
the
light
above
the
door
with
a
yellow
clip
ugly
is
too
big
and
everything
else
over
there
by
the
door
doesnt
make
much
sense
either
the
b
build
sides
i
like
the
front
side
here
except
the
colors
are
still
too
much
the
bench
greenery
mailbox
on
the
corner
and
streetlight
are
all
nice
the
boy
is
a
little
creepy
though
binoculars
in
hand
plus
a
telescope
on
the
roof
of
the
post
office
why
the
hinge
side
shows
more
of
the
weird
colors
you
get
in
the
wall
but
thats
going
to
be
hidden
when
the
set
is
open
plus
we
even
see
that
on
big
modulars
at
times
so
its
not
so
terrible
the
b
build
leftovers
again
a
lot
of
leftover
parts
its
obvious
this
was
another
alternate
but
itd
be
nice
to
see
more
of
them
used
to
make
a
bigger
building
but
lets
move
on
to
the
model
that
does
use
them
all
the
a
build
1
the
first
half
starts
like
this
maybe
its
just
my
bias
but
it
already
feels
like
a
more
detailed
build
bottles
on
the
wall
the
yellow
and
red
awning
over
the
window
etc
the
a
build
2
the
other
half
starts
off
with
detailed
work
too
i
think
thats
a
red
vending
machine
the
stairs
are
also
very
solidly
built
i
also
appreciate
the
effort
to
get
that
diagonal
base
where
a
door
will
be
its
such
a
nice
touch
to
have
sections
of
a
building
that
arent
right
angles
the
a
build
3
not
too
much
has
been
added
but
i
wanted
to
showcase
the
tiny
toys
before
they
get
hidden
by
a
wall
that
robot
and
train
are
just
fantastic
little
micro
builds
the
a
build
4
things
are
coming
together
quickly
the
walls
windows
and
doors
get
the
first
floor
nearly
done
im
still
not
big
on
the
sand
green
and
tan
combo
but
i
do
really
like
the
red
and
yellow
awnings
the
a
build
5
it
appears
the
shop
owner
lives
upstairs
since
weve
got
a
bedroom
forming
here
the
bed
is
a
little
plain
but
the
table
and
lamp
on
the
other
half
are
great
and
my
big
fingers
did
not
like
putting
all
those
railings
on
the
balcony
with
the
telescope
posts
and
tile
tops
knocked
quite
a
few
off
before
i
got
them
all
done
the
a
build
front
and
its
done
all
the
details
make
this
set
really
feel
like
a
minimodular
the
roofline
has
great
greebling
and
the
shop
contents
and
on
and
on
its
not
perfect
though
the
tiny
car
above
the
toy
store
door
isnt
nearly
as
good
as
the
toys
inside
and
the
kids
yellow
scooter
the
wheels
arent
even
on
the
ground
much
less
able
to
roll
the
scooter
looks
decent
though
so
that
counts
for
something
well
at
least
as
long
as
you
are
at
this
angle
since
the
boys
only
got
1
foot
on
the
1
stud
wide
scooter
the
a
build
inside
most
of
the
interior
has
been
seen
already
the
roof
though
does
a
nice
job
of
being
interesting
for
a
roof
a
skylight
the
edge
rails
etc
and
you
can
see
theres
not
much
wrong
color
in
the
walls
the
a
model
sides
an
interesting
building
when
folded
up
very
tall
and
skinny
you
can
tell
its
not
really
meant
to
be
displayed
this
way
its
meant
to
be
open
the
good
lots
i
like
the
awning
the
diagonal
door
the
flowerbox
under
the
upper
window
the
folding
gate
on
the
balcony
that
lets
it
be
used
in
open
or
closed
mode
and
the
green
white
blue
colors
the
bad
well
the
stairs
end
short
of
the
upper
door
i
still
dont
really
like
the
tan
doorframes
i
think
black
would
have
been
better
and
why
dont
the
upper
floors
match
up
in
size
the
a
model
leftovers
ah
thats
more
like
it
just
a
few
small
pieces
left
as
spares
the
errors
you
might
have
to
click
through
to
the
fullsize
versions
but
i
did
catch
a
few
weird
errors
in
the
manuals
first
in
the
photo
of
the
newsstand
the
map
in
the
front
corner
is
on
there
sideways
the
map
does
have
a
clear
north
arrow
printed
on
it
on
the
second
image
the
boys
feet
are
hanging
off
the
edge
just
unusual
to
see
an
alignment
error
in
the
manual
like
that
the
comparison
here
are
this
set
and
the
modular
detective
office
side
by
side
theres
a
huge
difference
as
youd
expect
but
is
the
difference
more
than
youd
expect
this
set
is
466
parts
40
the
do
is
2262
pieces
and
160
5
times
the
parts
4
times
the
price
looking
at
them
side
by
side
id
expect
a
bigger
difference
in
both
the
conclusion
so
whats
my
conclusion
on
this
model
i
love
the
main
model
but
the
alternates
are
meh
its
a
nice
set
for
someone
looking
for
a
town
building
other
than
police
and
fire
stations
but
who
isnt
ready
to
move
to
the
modular
line
compared
to
the
modulars
though
it
seems
overpriced
part
of
that
is
because
the
huge
modulars
are
actually
a
great
deal
compared
to
other
lego
sets
im
also
a
little
surprised
that
its
so
small
when
you
compare
it
to
the
city
sets
like
a
police
station
those
are
generally
designed
with
much
more
open
space
letting
them
be
more
of
a
playset
this
one
is
small
and
cramped
so
itd
be
tougher
to
play
in
its
not
really
a
city
set
though
the
ratings
value
710
its
under
the
10
cents
a
part
mark
but
thats
largely
due
to
having
a
ton
of
tiny
parts
all
those
flowers
and
decorative
1x1
round
studs
add
up
quickly
design
710
good
and
bad
on
the
colors
and
theres
a
big
difference
between
the
quality
of
the
main
vs
alternate
models
having
so
many
leftover
pieces
is
one
thing
when
the
creator
set
makes
3
very
different
models
ie
a
boat
plane
and
truck
when
its
3
buildings
it
seems
wasteful
to
have
so
many
parts
leftover
minifigs
610
im
not
sure
they
both
fit
the
set
i
suppose
the
boy
is
going
to
the
toy
store
and
the
woman
is
going
to
the
grocery
but
theres
no
storekeeper
in
either
the
woman
doesnt
look
like
a
storekeeper
to
me
so
thats
why
i
assume
shes
another
shopper
i
love
the
boy
but
the
woman
is
just
soso
except
that
i
do
appreciate
the
head
having
two
very
different
expressions
but
again
that
doesnt
fit
the
set
i
cant
see
her
scared
face
being
used
playability
610
the
shops
are
detailed
with
registers
and
so
forth
but
its
all
so
tiny
itd
be
hard
to
play
with
the
figs
in
it
parts
910
tons
of
windows
and
doors
plus
nice
sand
green
bricks
but
some
things
the
large
blue
curves
used
on
the
roof
for
example
are
weirdly
specialized
and
would
be
hard
to
use
in
another
building
design
overall
710
id
recommend
doing
what
i
did
build
the
alternates
first
then
the
main
since
thats
how
youll
want
to
leave
it
id
really
like
to
see
the
price
a
little
lower
compared
to
other
sets
again
the
part
count
is
inflated
due
to
so
many
tiny
parts
and
the
finished
building
is
tiny
but
its
loaded
with
neat
details
positive
great
review
very
thorough
its
not
a
set
which
makes
me
run
to
tye
store
but
it
definitely
has
some
fun
elements
i
do
like
your
new
grey
background
your
pictures
look
great
neutral
nice
review

i
particularly
like
the
use
of
grey

surface
for
the

somehow
makes
the
building
stand
out
more
good
job
neutral
a
terrific
very
comprehensive
review
but
im
not
at
all
impressed
with
this
set
it
feels
like
a
mishmash
of
bricks
with
no
clear
design
aesthetic
and
as
such
blatantly
underdeveloped
ie
designed
to
hit
a

point
rather
than
provide

neutral
cheers
for
putting
in
the
time
to
create
a
wonderful

i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
set
i
like
the
colour
combinations
but
it
all
seems
a
bit
alltoosimple
it
can
and
will
be
nicely
modularised
though
negative
thanks
mostlytechnic
for
this
review
i
only
brought
this
set
to
continue
the
shop
series
from
creator
in
my
opinion
its
only
half
as
good
as
the
bike
shopcafe
one
plus
it
doesnt
fit
the
same
as
that
pair
of
shops
oh
well
maybe
next
year
lego
creator
will
have
a
better
one
brick
on
review
on
mostlytechnic
neutral
reviews
for
this
set
really
should
picture
them
next
to
the
bike
shop
cafe
which
its
intended
to
be
compatible
with
right
down
to
the
size
of
the
baseplates
and
grey
tiles
around
the
edge
it
doesnt
look
that
great
on
its
own
but
if
you
add
the
two
sets
together
you
get
something
that
begins
to
look
like
a
street
scene
positive
this
seems
like
half
of
a
set
compared
to
the
previous
bike
shopcafe
as
i
like
many
of
the
elements
i
will
probably
buy
a
second
one
and
build
a
mirror
image
version
making
one
entirely
a
toy
shop
and
the
other
a
book
storenews
stand
and
adjust
the
sidewalks
to
work
with
the
previous
model
then
i
think
they
will
work
well
together
i
remember
a
little
area
in
copenhagen
that
had
this
sort
of
architecture
i
would
hope
the
subsequent
models
are
better
deigned
to
create
more
complex
alternatives
but
these
are
both
good
starting
points
for
original
or
enhanced
models
neutral
as
a
fan
of
creator
houses
i
really
want
to
like
this
set
however
i
think
that
creator
houses
have
long
filled
a
niche
thats
neglected
elsewhere
residential
houses
we
havent
had
a
larger
residential
house
since
2013
im
not
sure
if
these
sets
have
anything
to
do
with
that
but
it
seems
like
they
may
be
the
replacement
for
larger
houses
and
id
much
rather
have
a
larger
house
set
than
a
set
like
this
i
also
agree
with
many
others
here
something
about
it
just
feels
incomplete
i
think
that
the
various
city
business
buildings
weve
gotten
in
recent
years
including
those
in
this
years
city
squarewhich
is
much
more
expensive
than
this
but
also
contains
much
more
make
for
better
buildings
at
this
scale

yeah
i

this
would

a

more
out

tlcs
doing
usually
for
their

line
things
that
are
similar
to
the
city

more
civil

some
blacksmith
equipment
market
place
bakery
farmer
and
so
on

a
wizard

a
hidden

some
medieval

would
also
work
fine

it
really
looks

great

excellent
indeed
yoda
wow
interesting
lego
is
really
expanding
with
this
advent
calendar
thing
watch
next
year
theyll
have
ones
for
specific
themes
boy
o
boy
think
about
it
star
wars
advent
calendar
indy
advent
claendar
of
course
this
is
only
speculation
but
it
would
be
cool
xd
ill
probably
buy
both
of
these
even
though
im
a
boy
so
i
get
2
surprises
every
day
instead
of
one
p
positive
im
a
big
fan
of
anime
and
have
watched
some
mechas
like
full
metal
panic
neon
evangelion
genesis
it
is
a
mecha
and
chobits
well
she
is
a
robot
so
i
was
curious
to
see
what
this
new
exo
force
line
was
all
about
the
colorful
sets
and
mangalike
characters
didnt
persuade
me
right
away
but
the
urgent
need
for
a
couple
of
white
3x3
wing
plates
made
me
purchase
this
little
thing
it
cost
me
70
dkr
as
you
can
see
on
the
box
this
is
930
euro
or
about
the
same
an
american
has
to
pay
for
the
new
republic
cruiser
pretty
expensive
for
so
few
pieces
90
a
spare
technic
pin
the
box
an
actionpacked
box
with
one
of
the
sides
being
oddly
empty
except
from
the
legologo
whats
inside
there
is
a
small
building
instruction
two
polybags
no
bag
building
here
and
a
sticker
sheet
with
alarmingly
many
stickers
the
build
it
takes
so
little
time
to
build
this
set
that
i
didnt
get
to
take
any
pictures
of
the
process
every
step
was
accompanied
by
an
element
description
although
i
doubt
most
of
you
will
need
that
with
so
few
pieces
to
keep
track
on
most
of
the
dark
green
bricks
have
a
sticker
even
the
slopes
where
the
rough
surface
makes
stickers
fall
off
easily
there
should
also
have
been
a
sticker
on
the
windshield
but
i
wanted
to
keep
that
piece
clean
for
better
usage
later
im
one
of
those
who
keeps
stickers
on
the
bricks
the
model
you
want
to
see
this
model
from
the
front
as
the
back
is
pretty
much
neglected
there
isnt
much
for
the
pilot
to
grab
a
hold
on
either
he
is
pretty
much
a
sitting
duck
up
there
with
the
screen
giving
him
only
partial
cover
there
is
a
huge
wrench
next
to
him
which
kind
of
symbolizes
the
crudeness
of
the
mech
the
set
isnt
called
cyclone
defender
for
nothing
the
right
arm
might
hold
an
ordinary
light
assault
riffle
but
the
other
has
a
spinning
disc
with
samurai
swords
which
you
can
turn
with
the
yellow
knob
on
the
backside
those
of
you
who
have
seen
robot
wars
might
remember
the
incredible
power
of
this
melee
weapon
from
a
robot
named
hypnodisc
it
would
have
been
nice
had
there
been
a
pullback
motor
to
power
the
disc
im
sure
lego
has
a
lot
of
these
in
stock
but
the
simple
mechanism
still
works
reasonably
well
the
riffle
comes
off
and
a
pin
makes
it
easy
to
hold
with
the
hand
but
the
disc
is
fixed
to
the
arm
it
is
also
a
problem
that
the
swords
get
misaligned
quickly
during
play
the
minifig
i
really
like
this
minifig
because
of
the
neat
idea
with
an
expression
on
each
side
that
lego
has
made
a
standard
for
exo
force
posability
most
mechmocers
show
off
their
creations
using
gundamlike
poses
with
two
joints
per
leg
one
being
the
ankles
and
one
for
an
arm
i
thought
of
some
less
serious
poses
crawling
silent
like
a
ninja
belly
gliding
kick
off
upside
down
final
rating
i
have
to
disappoint
you
here
this
is
my
first
set
in
this
line
and
i
have
absolutely
no
idea
of
how
good
it
is
the
last
robot
i
bought
was
the
awesome
6889
spyrius
recon
robot
for
the
same
price
but
it
is
in
a
completely
different
genre
the
set
had
what
i
expected
two
white
wings
and
is
as
such
a
nononsense
set
i
guess
it
would
be
of
more
use
if
you
have
some
more
exo
force
which
i
dont
610
ups
has
great
minifig
weapons
and
is
easy
to
build
downs
crude
design
and
a
bit
too
expensive
for
what
you
get

nice
review
but
you
paid
how
much
this
set
is
priced
around
7
euros
here
in
germany
which
is
a
very
fair
price
for
what
you
get
in
my
oppinion
its
a
little
disappointing
though
that
i
couldnt
think
of
any
alternate
builds
for
this
set
and
there
are
no
inspirations
on
the
box
or
the
ef
website
neutral
i
have
2
of
these
guys
d
its
awesome
only
cost
me
13
bucks

for
a
comparison
the
castle
crossbow
attack
set
costs
10

for
the
win
did
i
read
this
wrong
you
paid
about
the
same
price
as
the
republic
cruiser
the
republic

costs
200
nz
and
the
cyclone
defencer
costs
13

must

some
people
refer

nice
review
but
i
dont

dont
relly
like

look

looks
ugly
hmmm
anyway
negative
thanks
for
the
great
review
i
love
the
poses
d
i
got
this
for
my
kids
and
they
didnt
mind
it
but
i
think
they
prefer
my
sets
because
they
arent
theirs
positive
i
couldnt
find
a
review
of
this
wonderful
set
in
here
so
here
it
goes
i
got
the
set
for
msrp
180kr
24
euro
which
is
a
fair
price
here
in
denmark
as
all
other
creator
sets
there
are
instructions
for
several
models
3
in
this
case
the
box
the
box
is
a
little
larger
than
city
sets
in
the
same
price
range
the
primary
model
is
shown
on
the
front
while
you
see
the
secondary
ones
on
the
back
what
you
get
312
pieces
in
5
polybags
and
two
building
instructions
one
for
the
primary
model
and
the
other
for
the
rest
the
built
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
speed
build
this
model
because
of
the
nifty
functional
details
from
the
retractable
landing
gear
to
the
wings
that
can
turn
by
means
of
the
handle
in
the
back
of
the
model
it
took
me
a
full
hour
to
build
it
because
i
had
to
test
how
it
all
works
together
the
finished
model
the
landing
gear
isnt
fully
enclosed
when
retracted
and
the
models
are
subminifig
scale
but
i
still
love
the
design
of
the
models
the
doors
for
the
rear
wheels
open
as
you
pull
the
wheels
down
and
the
final
piece
of
functionality
comes
from
the
wings
that
can
either
tilt
the
horizontal
stabilizers
or
have
elevators
wing
in
wings
out
wings
in
wings
out
ratings
as
a
whole
i
actually
like
this
set
even
more
than
the
big
rig
the
models
are
just
as
diverse
but
the
added
functionality
makes
the
plane
more
fun
to
play
with
than
the
rig
price
710
a
good
price
but
not
a
bargain
as
the
big
rig
design
910
there
could
have
been
a
sligtly
higher
level
of
details
in
the
main
model
but
all
models
are
really
good
looking
and
i
especially
like
the
design
of
the
hovercraft
functionality
1010
i
guess
you
could
ask
for
working
rudders
opening
cockpit
and
so
on
but
the
plane
is
really
filled
with
movable
parts
and
the
turning
of
the
wings
works
really
well
secondary
models
710
a
hovercraft
how
awesome
is
that
if
only
the
last
model
was
just
as
inventive
instead
of
a
standard
helicopter
modifiability
810
the
bricks
are
in
ordinary
colours
and
there
is
a
good
variety
of
them
giving
you
plenty
of
possibilities
for
mocing
you
can
easily
make
the
main
model
into
something
that
looks
more
like
an
f14
910
probably
as
good
as
it
gets
for
a
creator
set
in
this
price
range
it
is
entertaining
to
both
build
and
play
with
looks
good
and
the
secondary
models
are
worth
building
as
well

i
was
planning
on
doing
this
review

i
have
been
a
bit
swamped
lately
great
review
of
a
great
set
it
isnt
too
hard
to
convert
the

to
minifig

either

i
forgot

i
might
add

great
review
lasse
d
a
definite
two
y
up
i
bought
this
set
for
the
swingwing
concept
i
was
very
curious
what
tlcs
design
was
like
i
have
been
working
on
modifying
it
just
a
little
to
look
more
like
the
f14
so
far
i
have
completed
the
back
section
but
i
need
to
finish
the
cockpit
overall
this
is
a
great
set

wub

this
is
a
really
great
set
when
i
first
saw
it
i
thought
oh
a
silly
small
plane
who
needs
that
and
then
i
got
it
and
i
am
very
happy
that
i
did
this
is
one
of
the
best
designed
lego
creator
sets
and
it
was
designed
by
the
designer
of
the
cafecorner

a
fine

a
great

good
additional

thanks
lasse

and
sinner
teamwork
on
y
positive
thank
you
sinner
for
bringing
the
pictures
of
the
hovercraft
i
think
it
is
a
really
cool
model
but
the
steering
wheel
doent
work
too
well
it
doesnt
turn
easilly
all
the
way
around
and
when
the
craft
turns
it
doesnt
stay
stable
on
the
three
wheels
because
the
front
wheel
turns
quite
alot
into
the
opposite
side
now
to
the
third
model
this
is
quite
a
basic
helicopter
with
the
functionality
of
having
the
rotors
turning
it
doesnt
use
that
many
of
the
bricks
and
doesnt
even
have
a
landing
gear
i
have
a
question
to
all
of
you
as
you
can
see
i
prefer
to
show
one
or
two
large
pictures
and
have
the
rest
as
clickable
thumbnails
most
people
use
only
the
relatively
big
typically
640x480
pictures
so
that
you
dont
have
to
follow
links
what
do
you
prefer
it
is
no
problem
for
me
to
do
it
the
other
way
but
i
would
like
to
know
if
you
have
any
preferences
neutral
thanks
for
this
excellent
review
lasse
d
i
was
thinking
about
getting
this
the
other
day
but
decided
not
to
i
regret
my
actions
glad

see

making
great

has
so
much

its

at

the
idea
of
attaching
that
small

very
good

it
works

this

up
on

mostly
because
a
needed
a

to

thanks

had
that

its

we
usually
get
to

theres
not
much
to
say
really
doom
in
usm
looks
just
like
he
does
in
the
comics
and
lego
recreated
that
look
perfectly
again
hes
definitely
the
best
part
of
this
set
neutral
im
glad
you
were
joking
about
doom
im
not
that
big
of
a
fanboy
but
i
had
the
need
to
correct
you
for
some
reason
with
that
said
i
bought
this
set
for
the
minifigures
a
few
years
ago
looking
back
i
dont
really
care
about
the
figures
today
like
i
did
in
2013
the
building
is
decent
for
the
size
of
the

overall
i
wish
marvel
in
particular
would
have
more
playsets
in
its
theme
batman
has
several
great
ones
in
the
dc
theme
but
then
again
if
this
is
the
best
playset
to
date
for
marvel
maybe
its
better
just
to
leave
well
enough
alone
i
would
definitely
like
to
see
them
attempt
something
in
the
100
us
price
range
because
i
think
it
could
be
good
marvel
needs
an
equivalent
to
the
arkham
asylum
set
regarding
this
set
i
saved
myself
some
money
and
bought
the
4
minifigs
i
needed
all
but
spidey
on
bricklink
for
less
than
half
the
set
price

neutral
personally
i
thought
your
review
was
spot
on
and
i
very
much
enjoyed
your
tone
im
not
usually
much
of
a
minifig
person
but
i
will
admit
i
bought
this
set
mostly
for
dr
doom
and
considered
nova
a
bonus
growing
up
i
was
a
big
fan
of
the
fantastic
four
and
an
even
bigger
fan
of
dr
doom
i
hope
that
someday
the
film
rights
will
revert
to
marvel
and
well
finally
get
a
ff
film
that
respects
the
original
source
material
and
features
a
dr
doom
worthy
of
the
name
as
for
the
set
itself
i
dont
have
much
use
for
playsets
not
that
theres
anything
wrong
with
them
i
think
the
marvel
lego
line
could
use
more
of
them
in
fact
and
i
didnt
even
realize
it
was
linked
to
a
specific
show
as
ive
fallen
a
bit
out
of
touch
with
the
franchise
of
late
i
bought
it
i
built
it
it
sat
a
shelf
for
a
while
i
scrapped
it
for
parts
i
think
most
of
it
wound
up
as
a
greenhouse
for
my
winter
village
setup
its
not
a
bad
set
but
i
think
you
summed
things
up
nicely
when
you
called
it
mediocre
thanks

the
entertaining
review

i
think
im
the
only
person
in
the
world
who
likes

was
it
the
best
superhero
movie
not
even
close
but
i
didnt
think
it
deserved
the
hate
it
got
it
was
just
incredibly
and
clumsily
mishandled

some

enjoy
writing
reviews

sharing
our
thoughts
i
mentioned
to
yoda
that
i
was
planning
on
doing
a
review
of
this
set
but
it
would
likely
take
me
a
few
weeks
of
12
hours
per
night
to
finish
building
the
set
yoda
suggested
that
i
do
the
review
as
i
go
so
everyone
could
see
the
progress
of
the
set
what
a
great
idea
so
here
is
the
first
entry
feel
free
to
comment
along
the
way
i
will
try
to
post
photos
and
updates
every
night
on

wrap
up

ok
the

is

i
pictured

a

though
i
know
what
i
dont
like
its
the
fact
that
it
has
the
regular
lego
star

logo
on
top
with
vader
ucs
sets
should
have
a
different
iconography
like
they
did
in
the
past
sure
its
a
trivial
detail
but
it
adds
to
the
fact
of
owning
something
special
after
all
its
the
most
expensive
set
ever
as
of
now
happy
building

well
wait
patiently
for

the
manual

manual
measures
17
x
12

is
almost
an
inch
thick
it
is
spiral
bound
with
a
cardboard
like
front
and
back
and
it
is
314
pages
interesting
decision
not
to
break
it
up
into
multiple
manuals
it
is
almost
unwieldy
at
this
size
and
thickness
unfortunately
the
manual
is
not
available
electronically
from
the
lego
website
hopefully
it
will
be
soon
missing
were
the
little
instructions
at
the
beginning
telling
you
to
not
build
this
beast
on
shag
carpet
and
to
sort
out
the
5000
pieces
before
you
get
started
i
guess
they
figure
if
you
got
500
to
spend
on
this
thing
you
can
build
it

you
want

a
tad
smaller
though
yoda
i
dont
have
the
ucs
isd
but
from
the
pic
i
can
see
that
it
is
about
the
same
thickness
slightly
shorter
but
much
wider
than
the
mf
so
this
leads
me
to
believe
that
dimensionwise
the
ucs
mf
is
more
compact
also
notice
how
in
the
content
the
parts
fit
in
just
nice
without
additional
spare
space
for
anything
else
strange
isnt
it
that
when
tlc
is
responsible
for
the
shipping
we
see
optimum
usage
of
box
spaces
xd
imagine
if
all
boxes
were
this
efficient
499
sets
would
be
no
bigger
than
a
match
box

the

good
review
y
me
i
cant
build
it
before
saturday
positive
the
build
the
build
is
going
quicker
than
i
thought
i
am
sorting
as
i
open
the
bags
that
i
need
some
bags
are
in
multiples
so
it
is
easy
to
pick
them
out
the
build
is
a
tad
repetitive
as
the
framework
of
the
ship
is
somewhat
symmetrical
here
are
some
progress
shots
note
that
two
plates
1x4
and
1x8
are
stacked
in
between
technic
beams
then
the
part
below
is
assembled
to
hold
the
structure
together
this
took
about
an
hour
of
sorting
and
building
ill
post
another
update
tomorrow
positive
the
minifigs
as
you
can
see
the
minifigs
are
really
nice
they
even
throw
in
an
extra
fleshie
head
no
doubt
these
will
fetch
quite
a
bit
on
the
bricklink
and
ebay
markets
im
keeping
mine
continuing
the
build
this
photo
shows
how
well
this
model
is
put
together
notice
that
they
use
four
of
the
threehole
beams
per
side
to
hold
this
together
i
remember
reading
that
you
can
hang
this
model
from
the
ceiling
i
dont
doubt
it
these
right
angle
technic
pieces
are
used
to
reinforce
the
structure
of
the
model
you
can
see
them
used
here
i
was
shocked
at
how
many
light
gray
plates
are
in
this
set
i
have
two
tubs
full
of
these
the
infrastructure
is
now
complete
i
got
hung
up
for
about
an
hour
looking
for
one
of
these
turns
out
lego
gave
me
an
extra
left
wedge
and
shorted
me
a
right
wedge
so
frustrating
i
had
to
stead
one
off
my
6211
star
destroyer
it
is
not
a
very
common

the

i
can
see
there
is
much
more
into
it

that
it

is
a
great
value

to
what
you
get
in

cars

less

was
funny

i
found
the
use
of
parts
well
done
by
the
designers
i
made
a
car
and
then
tried
to
make
a
house
from
a
different
instruction
book
i
could
not
as
several
pieces
were
already
used
in
the
car
nice
to
see
them
using
all
the
parts
like
that
rather
than
having
a

of
extra

definitely
a

that
was
on
my
to

already

this
only
confirms
that
might
make
me
want
two
just
because
i
love

so
much

like
to

definitly
wub
this

will
make

thought
the

was

small

plan
to
make
my

fit
practically
the

i
will
definitly
add
floors

looked

i
too
have

lack

for

i
definitely
want
this

mixed

here
it
looks

is

the

old

pitted

some

quite
like
the
effect
i
agree
on

if

think
it
was
a
deliberate
choice
to
make
the
house
flashy
looking

not
very
functional

to
the
cool

the
only
thing
i
dislike
about
this
set
is
the
way
the
windows
are
attached
in
train
windows
so
they
turn
inwards
a
little
instead
of
the
usual
frames
with
shutterattachmentability
these
were
my
first
windows
like
that
and
it
surprised
me
i
wouldnt

surprised
if

for

am
glad
that
i
had
read
this
review
in
advance
before
making
my
purchase
on
this
set
earlier
with
my
girlfriend
we
built
this
set
for
a
total
of
3
hours
to
complete
this
beauty
in
about
2
hours
ago
there
are
stars
circling
around
my
head
at
this
very
moment
when
i
post
this
reply
i
must
admit
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
that
this
is
an
wonderful
piece
of
house
that
simply
shows
the
beauty
of
it
with
the
european
kind
of
houses
where
there
is
a
garage
furthermore
there
is
a
lovely
blue
car
i
am
seeing
stars
right
now
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
i
must
drop
a
thanks
to
you
personally
as
well
although
it
is
empty
from
its
interior
unlike
the
4996
beach
house
but
this
set
has
the
majestic
look
which
simply
place
a
wow
factor
in
front
of
it
upon
completion
at
the
moment
we
had
plans
for
getting
the
second
set
next
month
to
build
the
other
design
as
well
hopefully
i
will
be
able
to
share
with
you
guys
all
of
my
different
creators

with
its

always
like
this
little
set
a
little
more
text
would
have
been
nice

that
is
ok
as
it

ps
you
should
have
mentioned
in

this

was

was
loading
so
slow

im
trying

havent
succes
in

im
not

be
5
hours
each
time
when
i
can
make
review
or
something
that
needs
some
hours
neutral
i
actually
bought
this
set
last
monday
as
it
was
reduced
to
1499it
actually
not
a
bad
little
set
considering
the
size
and
part
count
has
a
decent
array
of
functions
its
a
nice
little
setthe
b
model
looks
just
as
good
so
i
might
buy
a
second
set
as
you
get
the

left
over

i
need
that

remember
when
i
said
in
my
review
of
7090
to
expect
a
review
after
i
went
to
toysrus
well
somehow
things
didnt
work
out
but
fortunately
im
finally
reviewing
my
latest
purchases
starting
with
7091
catapault
defense
which
happens
to
be
one
of
the
best
sets
in
the
castle
line
the
box
and
instructions
lego
box
art
is
at
its
highest
point
ever
these
days
with
lots
of
special
effects
and
great
action
poses
the
castle
theme
is
no
exception
and
7091
isnt
either
ill
let
the
box
speak
for
itself
i
love
the
back
of
the
castle
boxes
as
well
since
they
give
another
action
scene
and
other
neat
info
like
a
layout
of
all
the
accessories
the
contents
only
the
bare
essentials
as
usual
piece
bags
and
instructions
i
seriously
wish
they
still
put
mini
catalogs
inside
sets
like
they
did
when
i
was
young
but
i
guess
they
are
too
expensive
to
make
or
something
ah
well
cant
have
everything
no
picture
of
the
instructions
this
time
but
since
that
isnt
necessary
ill
just
say
that
they
are
fine
and
do
not
have
a
problem
with
distinguishing
dark
gray
from
black
the
pieces
heres
your
basic
shot
of
every
piece
included
minus
a
few
extra
pieces
like
an
extra
viking
horn
and
black
skeleton
leg
not
too
shabby
for
a
10
usd
set
theres
a
lot
of
nice
pieces
in
7091
as
you
can
see
and
this
doesnt
include
the
accessories
or
minifig
parts
the
brown
plates
wheels
and
spoked
things
are
always
useful
and
the
dark
blue
and
gold
slopes
are
really
cool
however
theres
also
a
fair
amount
of
technic
in
here
so
be
warry
as
usual
for
the
castle
line
7091
has
a
heaping
helping
of
accessories
most
of
them
are
old
pieces
recolored
but
the
ball
on
chain
whats
the
actual
name
could
someone
tell
me
and
the
shields
are
brand
new
i
actually
like
the
new
skeleton
weapon
since
its
fairly
detailed
and
was
really
the
only
way
tlc
could
make
a
part
like
that
and
yes
the
shields
are
printed
quite
nicely
too
if
i
do
say
so
myself
plus
you
get
viking
horns
always
useful
to
have
a
grey
boulder
a
basket
and
3
helmets
not
a
half
bad
deal
eh
oh
who
am
i
kidding
its
awesome
minifigures
ah
yes
one
of
the
highlights
of
any
castle
set
you
get
2
soldiers
and
2
skellies
this
time
all
with
different
weapons
the
two
soldiers
are
just
regular
crown
troops
with
different
faces
nothing
special
except
that
they
are
awesome
anyway
the
skeletons
on
the
other
hand
are
much
more
interesting
an
archer
and
a
black
skellie
archers
cool
of
course
but
i
know
many
dont
like
the
printing
on
the
black
skeletons
well
let
me
say
that
i
dont
mind
it
so
much
the
only
real
problem
is
that
the
eyes
are
dark
red
instead
of
just
red
which
makes
the
printing
a
bit
less
noticeable
and
ive
been
through
it
before
that
the
new
skeleton
molds
in
general
dont
bother
me
at
all
go
skeletons
the
finished
set
alright
theres
two
builds
in
this
set
and
ill
start
with
the
smaller
the
skeleton
barricade
okay
so
its
nothing
special
but
its
cool
all
the
less
the
shield
on
the
front
and
the
slanted
spears
are
nice
touches
heres
just
how
the
skeletons
can
tower
over
their
own
barricade
with
a
little
step
ah
the
catapault
the
lovely
catapault
seriously
i
love
tlcs
design
very
effective
and
also
very
realistic
especially
compared
to
kk
love
the
side
details
and
the
swiveling
base
and
you
got
ta
love
the
clever
use
of
that
basket
playability
yes
ive
made
it
a
tradition
now
to
write
stories
for
any

i
buy
and
this
isnt
the
last
one
you
can
be
sure
of
that
heres
one
featuring
everything
in
7901
oh
and
heres
a
small
ship
i
made
out
of
all
the
pieces
in
this
set
plus
a
couple
extra
figures
and
weapons
from
my
copy
of

theme
this
year
and
this
set
is
one
of
many
that
prove
it
as
with
all
castle
sets
its
best
if
you
buy
several
if
you
want
to
truly
enjoy
it
but
this
set
alone
is
also
impressive
in
both
design
and
pieces
and
minifigures
get
at
least
one
if
you
have
even
a
slight
liking
for
castle

said
great
review
sweet
i
wasnt
aware
that
the
catapult
rotated
either
this
set
isnt
on
my
buy
list
though
as
it
is
all
more
of
the
same
for
me
thanks
for
the
cool
moc
d
i
always
plan
to
add
a
moc
to
my
reviews
but
i
always
run
out
of
time
true
there
are
too
many
catapults
already
and
in
my
opinion
some
with
a
better
design
as
well
but
my
lack
of
interest
in
this
particular
set
doesnt
reflect
at
all
on
my
opinion
of
this
review
which
i
enjoyed
very
much
please
continue
making
great
reviews
like
this
one
grevious
y
positive
i
just
got
this
today
it
is
amazing
like
my
other
two
castle
sets
the
joust
and
the
crossbow
i
am
currently
starting
to
save
for
2008
but
for
christmas
i
think
i
want
the
skeleton
carridge
and
the
naboo
n1
fighter
positive
its
that
time
of
year
again
when
the
days
get
shorter
the
nights
get
colder
and
children
all
around
the
world
stare
longingly
into
warmly
lit
toy
shops
and
prepare
their
wishlist
to
send
to
santa
this
is
also
the
time
when
the
lego
group
releases
their
latest
winter
village
set
which
has
been
an
annual
tradition
for
the
past
seven
years
these
sets
have
been
very
popular
especially
among
afols
and
are
always
highly
anticipated
however
while
some
entries
in
this
series
have
been
more
popular
than
others
none
has
been
as
controversial
as
this
years
set
the
winter
toy
shop
which
is
a
rerelease
of
the
first
winter
village
set
10199
winter
toy
shop
from
2009
it
seems
that
many
think
that
this
set
didnt
need
to
be
remade
and
would
have
preferred
a
new
set
instead
or
that
it
is
not
different
enough
from
the
original
and
will
be
redundant
in
a
completionists
collection
does
it
deserve
all
the
hate
lets
find
out
disclaimer
i
dont
own
the
2009
version
so
i
cant
compare
them
visually
but
i
will
do
my
best
to
let
you
know
what
is
different
in
this
version
if
you
do
need
a
visual

welcome
to
the
winter
toy
shop
the
holiday
season
has
arrived
and
the
toymaker
is
busy
finishing
off
his
latest
creations
outside
children
ski
and
snowboard
and
a
freshly
built
snowman
sparkles
in
the
light
that
shines
from
the
toyshop
tower
help
decorate
the
huge
tree
that
stands
at
the
center
of
the
square
play
with
the
curious
kitten
on
the
cozy
wooden
bench
or
join
in
with
the
carolers
beneath
the
ornate
streetlamp
this
charming
set
also
features
a
ladder
trees
in
various
sizes
jackinthebox
a
toy
biplane
helicopter
rocket
train
race
car
truck
robot
tugboat
teddy
bear
and
a
wrapped
gift
have
fun
building
this
enchanting
winter
wonderland
includes
a
snowman
and
8
minifigures
with
assorted
accessories
a
male
caroler
female
caroler
a
woman
2
men
2
boys
and
a
girl
sh
bricklink
brickset
the
box
the
box
art
of
this
set
is
similar
to
that
of
the
original
but
there
are
some
notable
differences
the
christmas
tree
is
on
the
right
side
of
the
image
this
time
while
the
park
bench
is
on
the
left
and
of
course
it
features
this
years
design
for
creator
boxes
with
the
dark
blue
stripe
along
the
right
side
and
the
expert
logo
in
the
top
right
corner
theres
also
a
small
picture
of
the
back
of
the
toy
shop
and
the
background
looks
less
cartoony
than
on
the
original
the
back
is
also
very
similar
showing
a
different
angle
of
the
toy
shop
along
with
some
closeups
although
this
time
there
is
no
minifig
lineup
instead
the
minifig
lineup
is
on
the
right
side
of
the
box
it
also
includes
the
accessories
that
each
minifig
comes
with
and
some
of
the
toys
on
the
left
side
of
the
box
there
is
a
thumbnail
of
the
box
art
and
the
set
name
in
six
different
languages
they
also
want
to
make
sure
that
you
know
that
there
are
batteries
included
by
saying
it
in
dozens
of
languages
the
top
of
the
box
features
the
inventory
and
a
11
scale
reference
with
the
female
caroler
on
the
bottom
there
is
a
picture
that
reminds
you
that
there
is
a
light
brick
included
in
this
set
in
case
that
wasnt
clear
from
the
front
of
the
box
and
it
confirms
that
yes
it
is
a
bad
idea
to
put
it
in
water
in
case
you
were
planning
to
go
swimming
with
your
winter
toy
shop
the
contents
inside
the
box
there
are
two
instruction
booklets
and
two
groups
of
bags
one
for
each
instruction
booklet
while
two
groups
of
bags
is
not
as
many
as
there
usually
are
in
other
sets
of
this
size
its
still
better
than
the
first
version
of
this
set
where
the
bags
werent
numbered
at
all
so
this
makes
the
build
a
bit
easier
the
large
bag
in
group
1
and
the
two
large
bags
in
group
2
have
a
white
stripe
going
down
the
middle
of
the
bag
and
only
have
one
group
number
printed
on
it
along
with
some
other
number
and
some
kind
of
scan
code
i
have
no
idea
why
they
made
this
distinction
for
these
bags
or
what
that
code
is
for
so
if
any
of
you
know
the
purpose
of
this
please
let
me
know
in
the
comments
below
here
is
a
random
instructions
page
as
you
can
see
the
building
steps
can
get
quite
challenging
as
they
sometimes
include
many
different
pieces
in
one
step
especially
when
it
uses
a
lot
of
brown
pieces
which
are
very
dark
and
hard
to
see
in
the
instructions
living
up
to
the
sets
status
as
an
expertlevel
set
most
of
the
time
though
the
instructions
are
pretty
clear
and
easy
enough
to
follow
there
are
some
parts
in
new
colors
in
this
set
that
werent
in
the
first
version
or
any
other
set
until
now
such
as
that
large
flat
technic
arch
in
dark
green
the
jester
hat
in
orange
and
blue
one
of
those
new
2z2
round
jumper
tiles
in
brown
a
golden
frog
and
a
snowboard
in
dark
blue
there
are
also
some
rare
friends
parts
that
make
their
creator
debut
here
such
as
the
skis
in
azure
and
that
new
clear
1x1
round
tile
with
a
tiny
tube
coming
out
of
it
which
is
usually
used
as
a
stand
for
friends
accessories
and
is
a
very
useful
piece
especially
for
snot
techniques
and
no
im
not
talking
about
the
type
of
snot
that
many
people
usually
have
stuck
in
their
nose
around
this
time
of
year
there
are
some
printed
parts
as
well
such
as
the
clock
tile
the
letter
tile
and
the
register
slope
like
in
the
first
version
of
the
set
we
also
get
a
new
face
print
for
the
white
cat
which
is
more
in
line
with
other
modern
cat
designs
but
the
best
part
is
the
shop
sign
which
is
printed
this
time
around
it
features
a
lovely
wood
pattern
the
words
toy
shop
and
a
toy
soldier
on
both
sides
of
the
sign
which
is
ironic
since
the
shop
doesnt
seem
to
sell
any
toy
soldiers
like
this
but
it
looks
so
good
on
the
sign
that
i
wont
sue
them
for
false
advertising
the
minifigs
lets
start
with
the
most
unique
figures
in
this
set
the
carolers
these
two
were
also
the
highlight
in
the
first
version
of
the
set
but
in
the
original
they
both
had
the
same
head
this
one
which
featured
a
very
questionable
facial
expression
that
could
easily
be
taken
out
of
context
in
this
version
they
have
unique
faces
which
look
much
better
and
help
distinguish
their
gender
the
male
caroler
uses
lord
vampyres
torso
which
looks
quite
snazzy
on
him
maybe
this
is
lord
vampyre
before
he
became
a
vampire
the
female
caroler
is
easily
the
best
minifig
in
the
set
though
because
in
addition
to
her
exclusive
head
she
also
gets
an
exclusive
torso
and
skirt
print
a
huge
improvement
over
the
generic
unprinted
one
in
the
original
she
also
gets
the
queen
hair
in
dark
brown
and
aragorns
lined
cape
instead
of
two
combined
regular
capes
this
set
truly
is
the
return
of
the
queen
the
snowman
is
technically
not
a
minifig
but
as
you
can
see
here
he
is
exactly
as
tall
as
one
and
he
is
the
first
thing
you
build
after
the
minifigs
so
i
included
him
here
he
has
mostly
the
same
design
as
before
except
this
time
he
has
robot
claws
for
arms
instead
of
levers
which
is
good
since
they
allow
him
to
hold
accessories
such
as
his
broom
his
carrot
nose
is
included
separately
again
the
carolers
both
have
back
printing
while
the
snowman
looks
no
different
from
the
back
than
he
does
from
the
front
here
you
can
see
the
black
side
of
the
females
cape
this
lined
cape
is
so
much
nicer
than
the
solution
they
used
in
the
original
next
up
we
have
what
i
assume
is
a
married
couple
who
are
likely
the
parents
of
at
least
one
of
the
kids
as
well
as
the
toymaker
who
i
will
call
geppetto
the
man
in
the
pinstripe
suit
was
not
included
in
the
first
version
of
the
set
so
hes
a
bonus
minifig
these
guys
are
fairly
generic
but
they
have
some
detailed
torso
prints
so
they
look
pretty
nice
geppetto
seems
to
have
gotten
younger
since
the
release
of
the
original
set
since
his
gray
hair
has
now
turned
dark
tan
and
he
doesnt
seem
to
need
glasses
anymore
the
men
both
have
back
printing
but
the
woman
is
the
only
one
in
this
set
who
doesnt
get
a
back
print
why
you
got
ta
be
so
discriminating
against
women
lego
last
but
not
least
there
are
the
kids
one
of
the
boys
wears
dark
blue
pants
a
green
jacket
and
a
wool
cap
he
looks
a
bit
like
a
lumberjack
so
lets
call
him
lumberjack
boy
or
jack
for
short
the
little
girl
wears
an
outfit
that
wouldnt
look
out
of
place
in
the
friends
theme
with
a
lavender
scarf
and
pants
ill
call
her
lavender
the
second
boy
is
wearing
an
octan
jacket
and
a
sports
helmet
which
makes
it
ironic
that
he
is
the
one
not
doing
any
winter
sports
on
the
box
art
ill
call
him
president
business
junior
or
pbj
for
short
all
of
the
kids
have
fairly
detailed
back
printing
which
makes
up
for
the
fact
that
much
like
the
adults
they
are
made
out
of
mostly
common
parts
pbjs
helmet
and
scarf
cover
up
the
back
of
his
head
nicely
which
is
important
as
you
will
see
in
the
next
picture
whats
also
great
about
these
figs
is
that
half
of
them
have
a
doublesided
head
here
you
can
see
pbj
doing
his
best
macaulay
culkin
impression
i
also
removed
his
scarf
so
you
can
see
the
printing
on
his
torso
better
but
hes
not
the
only
one
who
seems
to
be
easily
scared
the
mother
also
has
a
very
alarmed
expression
maybe
she
got
surprised
by
the
jackinthebox
or
maybe
she
just
realized
how
expensive
toys
are
nowadays
you
can
see
the
female
carolers
back
printing
here
her
alternate
expression
is
a
nonsinging
face
which
is
very
nice
to
have
and
i
wish
the
male
caroler
could
have
one
too
she
looks
quite
cute
with
those
rosy
cheeks
but
the
most
adorable
out
of
all
of
them
has
to
be
the
little
girl
she
comes
with
a
pouting
sad
face
that
will
melt
your
heart
please
dont
cry
ill
buy
you
any
toy
you
want
just
stop
looking
at
me
like
that
the
build
the
first
half
of
the
build
is
dedicated
to
the
surroundings
of
the
toy
shop
it
includes
the
christmas
tree
the
park
bench
the
snowman
the
toys
the
carolers
jack
and
lavender
the
large
bag
contains
two
smaller
bags
with
small
pieces
a
white
box
that
contains
the
carolers
cape
and
the
jester
hat
in
its
own
little
bag
the
first
thing
you
build
after
the
minifigs
and
the
snowman
is
the
toys
this
version
of
the
set
has
a
lot
more
toys
than
the
original
which
is
good
because
i
always
felt
that
the
first
toy
shop
was
a
bit
light
on
toys
also
the
ones
that
were
in
the
original
have
been
updated
for
example
instead
of
the
two
pairs
of
skis
you
now
get
one
pair
of
skis
that
use
the
new
ski
mold
and
a
snowboard
the
jackinthebox
is
mostly
the
same
except
it
now
has
an
orange
and
blue
color
scheme
instead
of
the
red
and
blue
from
the
original
this
change
was
probably
not
necessary
but
hey
at
least
we
get
a
new
jester
hat
out
of
it
and
instead
of
the
brickbuilt
teddy
bear
you
get
the
new
teddy
bear
mold
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
this
change
because
i
actually
kinda
liked
the
brickbuilt
teddy
design
and
using
a
specialized
mold
seems
to
be
going
against
the
spirit
of
creator
sets
but
on
the
other
hand
i
cant
deny
that
the
molded
teddy
looks
better
than
the
blocky
old
one
meh
the
new
toys
include
a
tugboat
which
has
some
rounded
technic
pieces
as
its
hull
a
biplane
a
rocket
a
helicopter
and
a
truck
that
cleverly
uses
roller
skates
for
its
wheels
these
are
all
quite
brilliant
designs
that
feel
like
micro
versions
of
lego
city
sets
and
make
a
great
addition
to
the
set
here
is
a
back
view
of
some
of
the
more
complex
models
as
you
can
see
the
friends
accessory
stand
has
been
cleverly
used
to
hold
the
biplanes
fin
in
place
and
to
provide
a
stand
for
the
helicopter
the
jackinthebox
has
a
hinged
lid
the
only
thing
that
bugs
me
a
bit
is
the
tpiece
on
top
of
the
helicopter
that
holds
the
rotor
in
place
but
i
cant
think
of
any
better
way
they
could
have
done
it
next
is
the
ladder
that
is
used
to
decorate
the
tree
which
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
first
version
the
supports
are
on
a
clickhinge
so
they
can
be
adjusted
or
folded
away
then
you
build
the
tree
itself
you
begins
of
course
with
the
stand
which
is
mostly
the
same
design
as
before
but
this
time
the
plates
at
the
bottom
are
brown
instead
of
white
and
have
golden
studs
as
feet
next
you
build
the
first
layer
of
branches
the
main
difference
in
this
version
of
the
tree
is
that
this
one
actually
has
a
brown
stem
rather
than
just
a
technic
axle
on
which
you
stack
the
layers
of
branches
one
by
one
you
wont
be
able
to
see
the
stem
in
the
final
result
but
i
like
this
change
as
it
makes
the
tree
more
realistic
then
you
add
the
second
layer
of
branches
this
one
doesnt
have
lightscandles
and
attaches
to
the
lower
layer
at
an
angle
using
the
four
transyellow
studs
close
to
the
stem
the
third
layer
is
added
this
one
has
lights
again
each
layer
is
similar
in
that
they
are
all
made
out
of
green
plates
that
are
built
around
a
4x4
ring
plate
but
they
get
smaller
each
time
and
are
constructed
differently
enough
for
the
build
not
to
feel
repetitive
with
the
addition
of
the
fourth
layer
we
get
close
to
finishing
the
tree
lastly
you
add
one
more
layer
and
the
tip
of
the
tree
now
its
time
to
decorate
the
tree
however
its
not
as
fun
as
it
sounds
since
that
requires
you
to
add
lights
to
the
two
chainsropes
first
which
can
get
a
bit
repetitive
the
clips
holding
the
lights
to
the
chain
were
white
but
this
time
theyre
pearl
gold
which
looks
much
nicer
in
my
opinion
the
next
part
of
the
build
is
the
park
bench
with
the
streetlamp
and
the
little
tree
this
is
a
fairly
quick
build
with
not
much
to
it
the
fishbowl
helmet
parts
are
a
useful
piece
that
you
dont
see
too
often
so
its
nice
to
get
them
again
in
this
remake
the
design
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
in
the
original
set
except
for
the
wreaths
on
the
streetlamp
which
use
a
green
life
preserver
instead
of
a
round
2x2
plate
this
is
another
instance
where
they
use
a
specialized
piece
instead
of
a
brickbuilt
solution
but
im
okay
with
that
because
unlike
with
the
teddy
bear
this
part
was
not
originally
intended
to
be
a
wreath
so
its
still
nice
part
usage
the
second
half
of
the
build
is
dedicated
to
the
toy
shop
itself
and
includes
the
couple
geppetto
and
pbj
please
note
that
there
is
a
fourth
6x10
plate
burried
under
the
parts
you
begin
by
tiling
the
floor
setting
up
the
walls
and
adding
the
interior
items
such
as
the
fireplace
the
cash
register
and
the
toy
displays
next
you
add
the
walls
windows
and
the
door
and
the
ground
floor
of
the
shop
is
finished
so
far
the
build
is
the
same
as
the
old
toy
shop
except
this
time
they
decided
to
have
the
white
stripes
on
the
marquees
be
the
longer
ones
instead
of
the
dark
red
ones
for
some
reason
i
dont
know
why
they
did
this
and
kinda
would
have
preverred
to
get
dark
red
1x1
plates
instead
of
white
but
it
doesnt
detract
from
the
look
of
the
shop
so
i
dont
really
care
now
we
begin
with
the
upper
floor
this
is
where
things
start
to
look
a
little
different
can
you
tell
the
difference
the
difference
is
that
this
time
they
attach
the
roof
using
cliphinges
instead
of
bulky
technic
constructions
which
gives
you
more
space
on
this
floor
and
allows
it
to
look
more
like
an
actual
attic
they
even
tile
the
floor
next
to
the
frog
clock
aftter
adding
the
roof
the
build
is
finished
the
main
roof
feels
a
bit
loose
since
its
only
attached
to
the
building
by
one
side
im
not
sure
if
this
was
an
issue
in
the
old
toy
shop
but
its
not
a
big
deal
i
just
wouldnt
pick
the
set
up
by
the
roof
what
i
do
like
is
that
they
used
double
cheese
slopes
on
the
awning
on
the
outer
wall
of
the
tower
instead
of
singles
which
makes
it
a
bit
easier
to
build
i
like
how
the
supports
under
the
tower
roof
now
match
those
of
the
main
roof
the
wreaths
have
also
been
updated
like
the
ones
on
the
streetlamp
and
those
technic
arches
under
the
roof
look
a
lot
more
like
garlands
now
on
the
original
they
were
dark
gray
so
i
didnt
even
know
they
were
supposed
to
be
garlands
and
assumed
they
were
part
of
the
architecture
the
shop
sign
looks
a
lot
better
now
that
it
is
printed
the
old
one
just
looked
like
a
white
flag
i
also
like
how
the
small
plates
under
the
marquee
give
it
a
wavy
look
and
they
included
two
trees
in
different
sizes
on
the
right
side
of
the
shop
the
back
is
nice
and
open
and
allows
you
to
see
the
rest
of
the
toys
the
robot
train
and
race
car
all
of
which
have
just
as
much
of
a
simple
and
clever
design
as
the
other
toys
the
clock
looks
much
nicer
with
the
new
golden
frog
because
golden
frogs
make
everything
better
spare
parts
there
are
quite
a
few
small
parts
left
over
including
a
roller
skate
and
one
of
those
friends
accessory
stands
which
will
come
in
handy
the
complete
set
here
you
can
see
the
full
set
together
it
looks
quite
nice
and
festive
with
all
the
little
details
and
there
are
many
scenes
that
you
can
play
out
with
it
you
can
have
the
minifigs
decorate
the
tree
have
the
kids
play
in
the
snow
have
the
carolers
sing
by
the
bench
have
the
toymaker
build
some
toys
in
his
workshop
or
have
the
parents
buy
presents
for
their
kids
its
a
festive
toyfilled
winter
wonderland
the
fireplace
looks
cozy
and
i
like
the
brick
pattern
going
up
the
chimney
the
entrance
of
the
shop
looks
a
bit
empty
aside
from
the
cash
register
i
feel
like
they
could
have
displayed
some
more
toys
here
but
oh
well
being
a
set
targeted
at
teens
and
adults
there
arent
really
any
play
features
aside
from
the
light
brick
which
is
attached
to
a
hinge
so
you
can
either
activate
it
by
pressing
the
button
with
your
finger
or
tilting
the
brick
upward
so
that
the
button
is
pressed
against
the
roof
however
since
the
roof
is
not
connected
in
the
middle
and
only
attached
on
the
sides
it
tends
to
split
open
a
bit
when
you
do
that
so
im
not
sure
if
attaching
the
roof
this
way
here
was
such
a
good
idea
nevertheless
it
looks
quite
nice
when
the
light
is
lit
ratings
design
55
this
set
is
as
gorgeous
as
it
was
back
in
2009
the
small
updates
that
they
made
are
mostly
good
ones
although
the
absence
of
a
brickbuilt
teddy
is
a
bit
disappointing
and
the
new
way
the
roof
is
attached
while
not
as
bulky
as
before
makes
the
roof
slightly
unstable
but
those
are
just
nitpicks
build
55
there
are
some
interesting
building
techniques
here
such
as
those
on
the
tree
the
roof
and
the
toys
the
fact
that
the
parts
are
only
split
into
two
groups
and
the
part
callouts
can
get
fairly
complex
makes
it
a
challenging
enjoyable
build
minifigs
55
they
did
a
great
job
updating
the
figs
in
this
set
while
only
3
of
the
torsos
in
the
original
had
any
printing
all
of
the
torsos
have
printing
front
and
back
in
this
set
even
the
skirt
and
cape
of
the
female
caroler
you
get
two
exclusive
heads
and
half
of
the
heads
are
doublesided
plus
you
get
8
instead
of
7
minifigs
you
really
cant
ask
for
more
in
a
creator
set
playability
45
this
set
is
more
meant
to
be
displayed
than
to
be
played
with
but
there
are
plenty
of
things
to
play
with
if
you
want
all
the
different
minifigs
accessories
and
set
pieces
make
for
endless
possibilities
for
play
its
especially
fun
to
swoosh
the
micro
vehicles
around
parts
35
there
are
lots
of
good
parts
here
most
of
them
are
fairly
common
but
there
are
some
rare
parts
and
some
even
in
exclusive
colors
price
45
this
set
costs
20
more
than
the
original
but
considering
that
this
set
has
nearly
900
pieces
including
some
rare
and
exclusive
ones
as
well
as
more
minifigs
with
much
better
printing
i
think
80
is
still
a
fair
price
overall
55
so
whats
my
opinion
of
this
set
for
a
remake
i
think
its
great
they
managed
to
make
a
good
set
even
better
are
the
changes
minor
yes
are
they
an
improvement
mostly
yes
were
they
necessary
perhaps
not
but
its
good
that
they
made
them
instead
of
just
rereleasing
the
exact
same
set
so
if
you
didnt
get
the
first
winter
toy
shop
i
can
highly
recommend
getting
this
one
if
you
do
already
have
the
old
version
this
one
might
still
be
worth
picking
up
for
the
hugely
improved
minifigs
and
rare
parts
alone
as
for
the
controversy
over
rereleasing
the
winter
toy
shop
i
can
see
where
the
haters
are
coming
from
but
i
find
their
complaints
to
be
quite
petty
i
can
understand
if
youre
disappointed
because
you
already
have
the
first
winter
toy
shop
and
were
looking
forward
to
a
new
set
this
year
but
theres
always
next
year
if
youre
a
completist
and
feel
like
tlg
is
forcing
you
to
buy
a
set
you
dont
need
youre
wrong
nobody
is
forcing
you
to
buy
anything
but
yourself
if
you
decide
to
buy
every
set
in
a
theme
no
matter
what
it
is
thats
your
problem
not
legos
so
put
down
your
torches
and
pitchforks
and
just
be
glad
that
they
improved
the
set
design
and
gave
us
another
chance
to
buy
this
classic
set
there
are
far
worse
things
that
can
happen
in
this
world
than
lego
rereleasing
one
of
their
most
popular
sets
sorry
for
that
little
rant
so
what
is
your
opinion
on
rereleases
like
this
please
cast
your
vote
in
the
poll
above
i
hope
you
enjoyed
this
special
eurobricks
reviewers
academy
review
and
would
like
to
thank
the
lego
group
for
the
opportunity
to
review
this
set
happy
holidays
everyone

yaramanoglu
on
flickr
positive
thanks
for
a
great
review
first
of
all
i
do
like
the
upgrades
and
changes
made
from
the
original
2009
set
more
colours
and
parts
are
offcourse
available
today
than
back
in
2009
it
does
look
like
a
great
set
and
i
would
really
realy
have
loved
to
get
it
myself
if
i
had
the
funds
however
their
are
so
many
other
sets
thats
first
priority
for
me
this
december
and
next
year
so
sadly
i
might
have
to
pass
on
this
if
its
not
that
i
can
get
it
redicioulusly
cheap
at
some
point
and
yeah
we
should
appreciate
that
lego
does
keep
sets
coming
even
if
its
just
upgrades
from
earlier
releases
town
is
known
for
a
new
police
and
fire
station
every
year
cant
see
why
a
new
toyshop
is
so
upsetting
once
again
thanks
for
a
great
review
and
happy
holidays
to
you
as
well
positive
nice
to
see
they
finally
updated
that
generic
screaming
face
from
the
2007
castle
line
awesome
review
oky
i
have
the
old
set
so
i
wont
be
picking
this
up
positive
great
review
i
just
built
the
original
and
this
one
has
clear
advantages
over
the
original
though
i
wish
lego
would
stop
putting
torsos
with
defined
breasts
and
curves
on
children
i
really
like
pretty
much
every
change
i
wont
be
getting
it
and
id
be
lying
if
i
said
im
not
a
little
disappointed
for
the
first
four
years
my
motherinlaw
got
me
the
new
winter
village
set
for
christmas
after
the
last
two
which
didnt
really
fit
thematically
in
my
display
i
had
hoped
for
a
new
oneparticularly
since
my
daughter
is
getting
to
be
around
the
age
where
she
can
play
with
them
i
mention
her
specifically
because
ive
seen
lots
of
people
dismiss
those
who
are
a
bit
disappointed
as
rabid
adults
who
dont
care
about
kids
getting
cool
sets
and
i
dont
think
thats
fair
i
may
have
to
see
how
much
some
of
the
parts
go
for
on
bricklink
the
rerelease
is
better
than
the
original
but
not
good
enough
that
id
want
to
spend
80
to
get
a
set
thats
nearly
identical
to
one

said
great
review
you
almost
make
me
want
to
buy
one
i
dont
know
what
it
is
with
these
sets
on
the
one
hand
they
are
so
nicely
designed
and
cute
on
the
other
side
i
never
seriously
consider
buying
one
i
cant
explain
what
it
is
that
holds
me
back
a
lack
of
money
maybe
thats
the
thing
that
usually
holds
me
back
anyway
i
have
the
older
version
so
i
am
not
interested
in
this
set
neutral
regarding
the
reason
for
the
different
designs
on
the
inner
bags
i
think
that
the
white
stripe
is
the
new
version
with
the
nonstripe
version
being
old
i
suspect
the
reason
some
sets
have
both
versions
is
simply
that
theyre
still
using
up
some
of
their
supply
of
older
bags
good
review
i
didnt
realise
there
were
quite
as
many
changes
as
you
highlighted
tree
roof
etc
positive
i
missed
out
on
the
first
one
but
i
love
the
improvements
made
in
this
version
like
the
tree
having
an
actual
brown
trunk
so
it
looks
less
like
an
artificial
one
and
the
carolers
as
well
i
may
pick
this
up
but
im
sorry
to
those
of
you
who
already
have
one
positive
i
bought
it
and
im
very
happy
with
it
positive
cheers
for
putting
up
the
review
some
nice
improvements
but
not
enough
for
me
to
pick
it
up
the
original
set
is
good
enough
for
me
pity
the
poll
has
no

am
neutral
thanks
for
the
review
they
definitely
improved
upon
the
original
but
since
i
already
own
the
original
i
cant
justify
this
set
also
unfortunately
it
seems
to
be
the
trend
but
im
sure
there
are
a
lot
of
first
timers
out
there
too
that
will
snatch
this
up
since
it
is
a
really
lovely
building

the

make
it

am
said
as
for
the
controversy
over
rereleasing
the
winter
toy
shop
i
can
see
where
the
haters
are
coming
from
but
i
find
their
complaints
to
be
quite
petty
i
can
understand
if
youre
disappointed
because
you
already
have
the
first
winter
toy
shop
and
were
looking
forward
to
a
new
set
this
year
but
theres
always
next
year
if
youre
a
completist
and
feel
like
tlg
is
forcing
you
to
buy
a
set
you
dont
need
youre
wrong
nobody
is
forcing
you
to
buy
anything
but
yourself
if
you
decide
to
buy
every
set
in
a
theme
no
matter
what
it
is
thats
your
problem
not
legos
so
put
down
your
torches
and
pitchforks
and
just
be
glad
that
they
improved
the
set
design
and
gave
us
another
chance
to
buy
this
classic
set
there
are
far
worse
things
that
can
happen
in
this
world
than
lego
rereleasing
one
of
their
most
popular
sets
sorry
for
that
little
rant
so
what
is
your
opinion
on
rereleases
like
this
please
cast
your
vote
in
the
poll
above
after
mocking
people
for
holding

you
then
turn
around

ask
people
to
express
their

no

i

keep

the

of
the

sets
is
the
display
team
jet
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
lots
of
functionality
but
maybe
the
landing
gear
is
retractable
this
set
kind
of
reminds
me
to
the
9394
jet
plane
although
its
obviously
a
lot
smaller
as
you
can
read
in
my
review
of
the
42052
heavy
lift
helicopter
basically
anything
flying
is
1
for
me
so
lets
find
out
if
this

also
fits
the

its

of

black

this

a
common
part
but
the

actually
has
never
been
released
in
black
before
combined
with
the
rerelease
of
the
19l
soft

this
will
open
up
lots
of
possibilities

those
of
you

this
is
the
collection
of
parts
used
to
build
the
jet
it
sure
looks
like
we
are
getting
a
landing
gear
the
build
is
fun
but
pretty
straightforward
there
arent
any
special
or
cool
techniques
used
in
this
set
it
almost
took
me
more
time
to
apply
all
the
stickers
than
to
build
the
actual
model
finished
model
the
finished
jet
does
look
cool
though
the
white
and
yellow
color
scheme
combined
with
the
stickers
work
really
well
i
have
seen
people
refer
to
the
plane
as
being
orange
but
its
definitely
yellow
technic
or
lego
in
general
tends
to
have
some
color
variation
when
it
comes
to
yellow
i
do
concur
this
is
the
warmer
variant
of
yellow
but
its
not
orange
the
back
of
the
plane
looks
nice
too
although
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
the
rudder
part
it
looks
too
detailed
compared
to
the
other
panels
its
not
a
big
deal
though
and
maybe
its
just
me
parts
left
only
three
common
parts
left
features
and
functions
this
set
has
a
single
feature
and
that
is
a
retractable
landing
gear
its
operated
by
the
black
12t
double
bevel
gear
near
the
cockpit
in
the
following
picture
you
can
see
the
landing
gear
retracted
this
image
shows
the
landing
gear
when
the
plane
is
ready
for
landing
hopefully
the
pilot
will
roll
the
plane
before
landing
but
you
probably
know
what
i
mean
video
heres
s
short
video
demonstrating
the
display
team
jet
bmodel
this
set
also
includes
the
building
instructions
for
the
bmodel
a
stunt
plane
the
building
experience
for
the
stunt
plane
is
more
or
less
the
same
as
for
the
jet
well
what
do
you
expect
when
both
models
are
planes
with
a
limited
number
of
parts
for
an
alternative
model
the
stunt
plane
looks
fine
theres
not
a
lot
of
functionality
in
this
plane
but
its
worth
mentioning
that
the
tail
wheel
allows
the
plane
to
roll
on
a
flat
surface
the
plane
also
has
working
propellors
both
functions
are
demonstrated
in
the
video
unfortunately
the
landing
gear
of
the
stunt
plane
is
not
retractable
parts
left
a
couple
of
extra
leftover
parts
but
its
nice
to
see
that
most
of
the
parts
have
been
used
in
the
bmodel
as
well
actually
theres
probably
an
extra
yellow
technic
smooth
12
bush
left
i
just
found
it
on
my
desk
but
it
could
belong
to
one
of
the
other
sets
video
heres
a
video
demonstrating
the
stunt
plane
summary
two
nice
planes
for
13
bucks
thats
basically
what
you
get
both
models
look
good
and
the
set
has
some
interesting
new
parts
especially
the
7l
flex
axle
will
be
very
popular
it
comes
with
a
decent
collection
of
white
panel
although
they
are
very
common
nowadays
both
models
have
limited
functionality
but
each
of
them
has
at
least
one
function
to
give
the
model
some
playability
for
kids
other
than
the
swooshability
that
is
okay
it
might
lack
some
proper
functions
but
i
still
think
kids
will
love
this
set
i
can
see
kids
running
around
with
one
of
the
planes
in
their
hands
all
in
all
i
think
this
set
delivers
what
youd
expect
score
lets
see
how
this
set
flies
remember
that
the
grades
are
based
on
it
being
a
small
set
obviously
a
set
like
this
can
not
be
compared
with
a
mercedes
flagship
8
design
for
a
small
set
the
model
looks
very
authentic
7
building
experience
no
surprises
7
features
just
the
retractable
landing
gear
8
playability
it
has
swooshability
so
i
see
kids
running
around
with
this
model

parts
lots
of

if
you
are
into

not

are
nice

it

a
decent
number
of
white

i

i
would
get
better

was

and
i
like
playing
with
it
i
love
the
reviews
but
i
think
i
have
to
mention
that
the
yellow
axle
must
be
a
5l
the
picture
shows
a
5l
and
a
5l
would
fit
the

of
the

the

also
a
5l

the

4x

yellow

and
that
seems
to
line
up
with
what
im
seeing
in

pics
as
well

i
assume
the
4l
is
a
typo

i
seem
to
have
been
messing
up
axle
lengths

its

neutral
very
nice
review

especially

i
dont
like
the
lack

symmetry
for
the
propeller
of
the

model
though
but
understand
the
alternative
would
be
to
add
one
extra
small
panel
to
the

skip
two
of
them
in
the
b

good
review
as
always
jim
when
i
first
saw

pack

me
as
that
i
have
about
20
white
pieces
in
my
technic
collection
all
from
42043
and
this
set
has
some
really
useful
ones
all
for
a
cheap
price
those
7l
flex
axles
will
be
extremely
useful
in
my
current

im
doing

review
even
with
the
missing

video
of

looks
like
this
is
an
excellent

those
soft

will
go
down

this

be

my
favourite
of
the
2016
sets
ive
built
so
far
id
go
so
far
as
to
say
this
is
the
best
budget
set
in
years
i
would
have
loved
this
when
i
was
a
kid
great
swoosh
ability
good
to
hear
that
im
gon
na
check
the
toy
shops
in
my
lunch
break
tomorrow
see
if
they
got
their
shipment
in
yet
if
they
have
ill
definitely
buy
one
of
these
little
sets
positive
i
got
this
little
set
for
xmas
and
i
noticed
all
the
gaps
and
decided
to
fix
them
so
here
it
is
img5344
by
jj2sam
on
flickr
first
i
added
some
beams
to
the
wings
and
top
to
make
it
less
hollow
second
i
put
some
navigation
lights
on
it
i
made
the
nose
a
bit
wider
and
added
a
control
panel
and
lastly
i
changed
out
the
landing
gear
wheels
to
more
appropriate
ones

more
pictures
are
here
neutral
so
this
set
showed
up
in
stores
yesterday
and
i
immediately
picked
two
up
all
in
all
it
is
a
nice
set
but
it
is
slightly
different
from
what
i
was
expecting
the
plane
feels
a
bit
flat
pointy
nose
wide
bottom
etc
and
while
the
panels
work
very
well
as
wings
it
feels
a
bit
simplistic
to
just
have
singlepart
wings
the
stickers
really
work
for
it
though
its

great
review
with
high
quality
pictures
well
done
im
glad
you
took
the
time
to
do
it
properly
cool
that
you
have
built
both
models
i
agree
with
the
mudguards
they
sure
look
good
on
this
model
positive
i
was
waiting
especially
for
review
of
this
set
let
me
add
few
things
about
this
thing
it
all
will
be
complainging
of
person
who
works
with
these
type
of
machines
so
if
you
just
want
a
unusual
machine
in
your
collection
ignore
my
complaining
i
see
underground
loaders
almost
every
day
and
believe
me
this
model
would
now
work
in
the
underground
mine
first
of
all
its
cab
should
stick
out
more
from
the
frame
each
loader
has
cab
placed
out
of
the
chassis
to
provide
better
view
for
the
driver
in
this
class
of
machine
it
would
help
a
bit
but
in
low
loader
ones
it
is
extremely
important
this
is
the
view
from
the
cab
of
a
low
profile
loader
looking
at
front
and
yes
front
of
the
machine
is
where
engine
is
placed
because
at
least
at
kghm
all
machines
drive
engine
forward
another
thing
about
that
cab
is
that
seat
and
steering
wheeljoysticks
are
placed
perpendicularly
to
the
machine
chassis
to
provide
same
view
for
driving
forward
and
backwards
so
another
weak
spot
of
the
set
the
model
lacks
of
trans
clear
lights
on
the
engine
part
because
all
machines
that
work
underground
have
same
lamps
on
front
and
back
another
thing
that
comes
to
my
mind
is
that
warning
light
and
antena
would
not
live
too
long
in
the
mine
becuase
it
could
be
torn
apart
by
ramming
into
tunnels
roofs
it
does
resemble
shape
of
underground
machine
but
not
a
loader
only
machine
that
comes
to
my
mind
is
something
that
are
used
for
movingplacing
hydraulic
support
jacks
in
tunnels
sorry
for
poor
quality
i
didnt
find
better
picture
of
it
it
does
have
claw
four
wheels
and
articulated
chassis
but
have
much
greater
range
of
movement
of
the
arm
anyway
id
give
it
at
least
35
for
overall
look
model
itself
as
a
set
looks
unfinished
or
cut
down
on
pieces
after
visit
of
an
accountant
for
me
it
looks
like
engine
part
was
built
differently
with
knobs
for
steeringclaw
operating
sticking
out
from
back
claw
needs
almost
seven
full
turns
of
the
worm
gear
to
close
from
opened
position
and
is
rather
annoing
to
use
it
in
way
it
is
built
in
this
model
bracket
that
holds
bevel
gears
responsible
for
steering
is
rather
loose
being
hold
in
place
by
single
34
pin
on
the
other
hand
the
steering
works
very
well
it
seems
that
lack
of
differential
will
be
more
common
in
lego
sets
becuase
it
is
another
model
that
have
fake
engine
driven
by
single
wheel
like
in
old
russian
rc
cars
i
am
ok
with
that
but
it
is
a
pitty
that
this
model
has
only
r2
engine
thing
that
i
do
not
like
the
most
in
this
model
is
how
the
claw
arm
works
first
of
all
it
barelly
lifts
the
claw
of
the
ground
the
movement
could
be
much
better
and
it
has
major
design
flaw
universal
joints
are
not
placed
in
line
with
articulation
points
and
this
is
main
reason
of
5l
axle
not
being
suported
on
both
sides
under
the
turntable
while
rainsing
the
arm
it
bends
a
little
i
really
would
like
to
see
this
model
built
differently
with
normal
bucket
and
better
range
of
movement

thanks
for
the
thorough
comments
i
agree
that
the
set
has
some
limitations
both
in
construction
and
realism
but
i
think
theyre
acceptable
given
the
pricepoint
and
size
the
antenna
is
definitely
ludicrous
i
really
do
suspect
they
had
a
surplus
of
the
swords
to
use
up
and
yes
the
way
the
steering
knob
is
mounted
is
loose
i
also
noticed
that
the
ujoints
to
the
claw
are
not
in
the
right
spot
like
you
mentioned
but
didnt
include
it
since
it
still
works
fine
that
axle
coming
forward
to
the
claw
has
a
very
long
unsupported
section
that
does
bend
a
bit
when
you
raise
and
lower
the
claw
it
works
but
is
a
bit
of
a
cheat
that
im
kinda
surprised
they
let
through
i
just
checked
and
the
bucket
from
8043
is
a
couple
studs
too
wide
for
this
set
im
betting
that
was
seriously
considered
but
itd
have
meant
scaling
the
whole
thing
up
and
that
would
have
put
it
into
a
higher
price
point
or
they
could
have
pulled
the
mold
for
the
8x14
bucket
back
out
and
remade
it
for
this
set
i
really
like
the
model
you
built
and
thats
interesting
about
the
cabs
being
basically
flush
with
the
top
but
sticking
out
the
side
in
image
searching
as
part
of
my
research
i
found
both
that
style
and
ones
like
this
with
the
cab
sticking
up
more
like
the
photo
of
the
caterpillar
one
in
my
review
i
wonder
if
thats
a
useuropean
difference
or
different
types
of
mining
or
what
because
both
styles
definitely
exist
in
the
real
world
neutral
think
this
is
the
only
1h
set
ill
be
getting
guess
im
waiting
for
2h
for
the
rest
of
the
construction
stuff
this
set
looks
okay
to
me
it
includes
the
instructions
for
both
models
which
is
cool
and
includes
some
great
parts
i
like
that
its
not
just
another
bucket
loader
and
that
it
actually
tries
something
different
too

was

was

it
was

now
its

looks

if
ill

that
i
almost

want
to
have

the
original
model
out

one

poorest

ever

the
interesting
parts
theres
a
lot
of
panels
in
this
set
some
are
new
colors
the
blue
curved
panel
and
the
lshaped
blue
panels
are
a
new
mold
i
see
them
being
used
as
mudguards
on
future
sets
or
maybe
even
this
year
i
havent
looked
at
the
other
2016
technic
sets
in
detail
yet
the
hose
soft
axle
7
long
in
black
is
new
as
well
the
normal
7
axle
in
yellow
is
a
new
color
too
and
i
have
no
idea
why
its
in
this
set
both
models
use
it
in
invisible
places
so
theres
no
reason
other
than
making
it
easier
to
grab
the
right
length
axle
to
have
it
i
assume
other
sets
this
year
are
using
it
but
im
not
sure
the
manual
and
the
dumbingdown
continues
now
they
have
to
show
people
to
compare
axle
lengths
to
the
11
prints
on
the
page
that
have
always
been
there
but
how
does
the
11
work
on
the
app
might
have
to
look
into
that
for
the
record
i
pulled
out
my
phone
and
tried
to
find
the
app
in
the
google
store
couldnt
find
it
so
then
i
went
to
the
lego
website
shown
on
the
page
and
it
had
a
link
to
it
turns
out
it
wasnt
showing
up
because
its
tablet
only
so
google
wasnt
showing
it
to
me
on
my
phone
ill
try
again
later
with
a
tablet
starting
the
build
two
technic
standards
a
bunch
of
pieces
linked
together
to
make
a
specific
pattern
of
holes
and
an
engine
block
some
weirdness
this
felt
very
weird
to
me
making
the
crankshaft
for
the
engine
they
have
you
build
it
right
to
left
i
dont
know
if
its
because
im
a
lefty
or
what
but
it
felt
awkward
i
need
to
look
in
some
old
manuals
and
see
if
its
always
been
this
way
nope
i
randomly
looked
at
2013s
set
42000
racer
and
it
builds
it
left
to
right
assembling
the
core
heres
the
core
of
the
racer
upside
down
the
engine
block
some
gears
at
each
end
and
a
couple
boat
studs
for
smooth
gliding
and
yes
they
cheated
and
those
are
only
attached
on
two
studs
instead
of
all
4
im
always
amazed
at
how
lego
geometry
keeps
finding
interesting
ways
that
it
works
like
here
with
those
boat
studs
they
fit
perfectly
into
the
bottom
of
the
brick
and
against
the
beam
the
front
end
up
front
we
get
a
standard
blue
seat
with
a
couple
hidden
wheels
behind
it
a
boat
doesnt
typically
have
wheels
but
these
will
drive
the
mechanisms
of
this
model
so
well
let
it
slide
an
odd
part
choice
here
though
in
the
very
front
there
are
two
tan
axle
pin
without
friction
parts
holding
that
3
long
liftarm
on
why
theres
no
need
in
either
model
for
the
nonfriction
pin
and
theres
lots
of
the
normal
blue
axle
pins
in
the
set
so
why
include
these
two
different
pins
and
all
done
it
looks
like
a
huge
jump
here
but
its
really
not
the
front
and
rear
connect
to
each
other
and
then
a
bunch
of
big
panels
are
added
that
make
the
model
look
way
bigger
the
stickers
on
this
set
really
make
it
work
without
them
its
pretty
bland
and
boring
so
i
recommend
using
them
from
the
rear
at
the
back
we
have
a
fan
to
propel
the
boat
thats
not
so
accurate
all
the
images
i
can
find
of
reallife
boats
use
props
in
the
water
but
since
this
is
a
nonfloating
model
we
have
to
make
some
tweaks
i
guess
there
also
should
be
fins
going
down
into
the
water
for
stability
and
hydroplaning
but
again
had
to
drop
that
heres
an
example
of
a
real
boat
you
can
see
they
nailed
the
overall
look
quite
well
the
underside
for
those
that
want
to
see
the
mechanicals
heres
the
underside
of
the
model
minifig
scale
technic
nope
not
quite
a
fig
will
fit
the
seat
but
sticks
out
of
the
cockpit
and
cant
fit
a
helmet
at
all
so
close
starting
the
b
model
again
with
the
engine
block
but
this
time
an
opposing
4
instead
of
inline
an
odd
part
its
rare
for
lego
to
include
parts
specific
to
the
bmodel
so
i
was
curious
when
i
found
this
2axle
with
pin
a
fairly
new
part
in
the
main
model
its
used
in
a
place
that
a
normal
3
pin
would
have
been
fine
and
its
the
only
one
of
these
in
the
whole
set
so
it
obviously
must
be
needed
in
the
bmodel
sure
enough
theres
an
assembly
here
that
needs
it
the
front
of
the
boat
more
upsidedown
building
and
that
silver
piston
is
basically
only
there
as
a
spacer
it
has
no
real
function
yet
it
turns
out
later
an
axle
goes
into
it
so
its
a
support
for
one
end
of
the
axle
adding
the
wheels
we
keep
building
around
the
engine
this
model
uses
the
same
wheel
setup
as
the
main
model
taking
shape
the
bmodel
instructions
tell
you
to
put
the
stickers
on
in
case
you
havent
they
actually
did
a
good
job
making
the
sticker
work
on
either
model
but
the
silver
piston
used
as
a
crossbrace
is
a
bit
weird
it
can
spin
so
that
axle
hole
on
the
side
ends
up
facing
whatever
way
it
wants
the
back
end
the
flex
axles
are
used
here
under
the
panels
just
for
appearance
and
to
support
the
exhausts
at
the
right
angle
same
fan
propulsion
as
the
main
model
and
just
as
wrong
here
worse
the
gearing
is
switched
in
the
main
model
the
pistons
and
fan
spin
pretty
quickly
as
you
push
the
boat
across
the
floor
in
this
one
they
turn
very
slowly
more
instruction
weirdness
im
always
curious
at
how
lego
decides
to
do
instructions
heres
how
the
panels
on
one
side
of
the
boat
are
assembled
for
the
mirror
image
on
the
other
side
they
tell
you
to
put
all
3
pins
into
the
short
panel
as
step
1
2
black
and
a
blue
add
the
white
piece
as
step
2
and
then
add
teh
second
panel
and
stickers
as
step
3
why
two
different
ways
all
done
heres
a
similar
angle
as
most
of
the
official
images
looks
ok
i
noticed
though
how
obvious
the
wheels
are
the
back
of
the
box
image
is
a
lower
angle
that
hides
them
more
and
i
like
the
mudguard
panels
as
seats
pretty
clever
from
the
side
im
not
fond
of
the
profile
it
doesnt
sit
level
like
i
think
it
should
the
wheels
are
a
stud
too
low
sticking
out
of
the
bottom
the
underside
like
most
bmodels
there
are
compromises
theres
pins
and
axles
sticking
out
but
thats
what
you
do
when
faced
with
a
limited
piece
selection
minifig
scale
yet
nope
not
quite
a
bit
too
big
this
time
i
think
the
driver
is
supposed
to
sit
in
the
seat
with
knees
over
the
front
of
the
guard
where
the
grey
pin
is
so
the
minifig
is
way
too
small
spare
pieces
very
few
leftovers
in
this
bmodel
the
conclusion
so
whats
my
conclusion
on
this
model
the
bmodel
is
fairly
meh
and
too
similar
to
the
main
model
however
i
love
the
hydroplane
racer
itself
it
looks
great
and
is
very
swooshable
for
the
price
its
surprisingly
large
thanks
to
the
big
panels
on
the
sides
yes
this
is
one
set
that
really
needs
the
stickers
to
look
good
but
they
look
great
and
are
well
worth
putting
on
the
ratings
value
910
close
to
10
cents
a
piece
and
a
fairly
large
model
for
the
price
design
910
looks
great
other
than
the
tiny
fan
on
the
back
minifigs
na
i
was
tempted
to
give
a
score
since
a
minifig
almost
fits
but
thatd
be
cheating
playability
810
not
much
functionality
other
than
the
engine
and
fan
spinning
but
very
swooshable
and
sturdy
enough
to
be
played
with
parts
910
a
bunch
of
panels
including
some
new
ones
just
about
every
kind
of
technic
pin
and
quite
a
few
thin
liftarms
overall
910
the
set
is
a
solid
winner
as
long
as
your
satisfied
with
the
main
model
positive
again
great
review
with
superb
pictures
the
white
and
blue
certainly
works
very
well
with
your
dark
backdrop
thorough
review
for
such
a
small
model
small
in
size
but
great
as
a

tell
me
why
did
i
let
you
review
this
one
positive
thanks
for
a
great
review
too
bad
there
is
only
one
blue
curved
panel
in
this
set
my
opinion
on
the
frictionless
axlepins
is
that
the
flex
axle
might
be
easier
to
stick
in
them
than
in
regularblue
axlepins

it
looks
good

also
a

it
stands
up

as

jim
my

has
just

me
by
giving
me
this
set
a
few
days

and
i
have
just
built
the
a
model
two
days

b
model
yesterday
i
agree
with
all
that
you
wrote
above
i
dont
have
tumbler
tires
but
i
have
9398
tires
driving
is
smooth
but
steering
suspension
will
be
bad
as
you
said
due
to
negative
caster
and
tires
hitting
the
chassis
anyway
tonight
i
will
destroy
the

rebuilt
this

positive
the
set
is
a
looker
youve
got
to
admit
it
but
what
it
gives
in
looks
does
not
make
up
for
what
it
lacks
in
functions
i
really
wanted
this
set
badly
even
when
i
restarted
my
adventure
with
technic
about
a
month
ago
than
i
learned
more
and
more
about
what
a
good
model
can
do
mostly
thanks
to
this
forum
and
yt
right
now
im
a
bit
disappointed
with
the
arctic

smaller
sets
offer
more
functions
and
teach
you
much
more
jim
it
was
a
great

you
switched
the

for

the

otherwise
you
would
see
that
the
cut
off
part
is
where
theres
a
beam
in
front
of
the
panel
thats
probably
done
because
the
beam
could
possibly
damage
the
sticker
either
while
building
or
while
placed
against
it
for
a
long
time

its
simply
omitted
because
it
wouldnt

this
is
probably
the
only
reason
for
tlg
choosing
to
provide
an
asymmetrical

looking
at
the

sheet
i
also
believe
they
simply
didnt
have
the
space
on

for
a
symmetrical

a

mini
offroader
introduction
technic
mini
models
are
sometimes
regarded
as
models
not
worth
buying
i
dont
agree
with
this
opinion
whether
its
a
special
part
or
innovative
building
technique
almost
every
mini
model
has
something
that
makes
the
set
worthwhile
this
time
i
will
be
reviewing
the
42001
mini
offroader
this
model
is
not
a
smaller
version
of
an
existing
model
so
theres
no
real
comparison
with
a
bigger
brother
or
sister
if
you
will
nor
does
the
model
resemble
a
real
life
brand
or
vehicle
so
it
is
what
it
is
a
mini
offroader

the

the

the
other

opening
the

in
the
following

with
the
exception
of
the

no

number
parts
that
will
add

the

not

from

you
can
see
that
these

have

hey
you
cant
have
enough
rubber
bands
thin
liftarm
1x5
with
axle
holes
like
the
panels
these
liftarms
were
also
new
at
the
time
of
release
looking
at
the
the
frequent
usage
in
other
sets
this
part
has
proven
to
be
a
most
useful
mammal
thin
liftarm
1x3
not
a
very
rare
piece
per
se
but
if
you
are
not
into
bionicle
this
liftarm
part
can
be
hard
to
find
your
other
option
would
be
to
buy
the
9390
mini
tow
truck
or
the
8305
dual
bikes
from
a
while
ago
2000
long
pin
with
center
pin
hole
this
relatively
new
kid
on
the
block
is
currently
used
in
many
technic
and
nontechnic
sets
and
has
well
proven
its
worth
axle
pin
connector
hub
with
2
axles
like
the
previous
part
this
newish
part
is
also
quite
helpful
in
certain
situations
part
list
heres
the
complete
list
for
all
100
parts
building
experience
the
build
starts
with
the
chassis
of
the
offroader
after
connecting
some
liftarms
two
elastic
bands
one
on
each
side
are
attached
to
the
towball
pins
this
is
all
there
is
to
the
suspension
plain
and
simple
the
two
elastic
bands
contract
the
lshaped
liftarms
which
results
in
the
long
ends
swiveling
downwards
the
video
below
demonstrates
the
suspension
the
simplicity
doesnt
do
it
justice
because
it
works
like
a
charm
the
suspension
is
very
smooth
with
the
right
amount
of
stretch
and
resistance
this
great
working
suspension
adds
a
lot
of
value
to
this
set
to
quote
john
hurt
in
the
movie
contact
why
build
one
when
you
can
have
two
at
twice
the
price
i
have
purchased
two
sets
so
we
can
simultaneously
see
both
models
and
make
a
proper
comparison
below
you
can
see
two
identical
chassis
which
will
be
used
for
both
versions
of
the
build
at
this
stage
we
have
arrived
at
the
end
of
the
first
booklet
which
only
took
about
ten
minutes
not
surprising
since
the
first
booklet
only
has
10
building
steps
progressing
to
the
second
booklet
you
need
to
choose
between
building
the
main
and
alternative
model
thats
a
choice
i
dont
need
to
make
for
this
review
so
lets
start
with
the
main
model
main
model
when
building
the
bodywork
theres
a
rather
peculiar
building
technique
which
you
wouldnt
expect
in
an
official
lego
set
the
axle
and
pin
connector
hub
with
2
axles
only
protrudes
halfway
into
the
double
bent
liftarm
the
thin
1x4
liftarm
which
is
added
in
one
of
the
following
steps
makes
sure
the
hubs
stay
perfectly
in
place
but
i
was
still
surprised
to
see
this
technique
the
finished
bodywork
for
the
main
model
looks
likeuhhwelli
dont
know
exactly
it
doesnt
bear
any
resemblance
to
a
real
life
model
which
makes
it
hard
to
judge
one
things
for
sure
its
not
the
best
looking
technic
mini
model
the
bodywork
can
be
attached
to
the
chassis
by
using
a
7l
axle
and
two
bushes
one
on
each
side
of
the
chassis
alternate
model
unfortunately
the
alternate
model
doesnt
look
much
better
than
the
main
model
its
even
a
stud
less
wide
while
you
would
like
to
see
slightly
more
body
matching
the
size
of
the
tires
and
chassis
attached
to
the
chassis
the
body
is
even
more
out
of
proportion
its
not
really
ugly
and
the
color
scheme
is
great
obviously
this
goes
for
the
main
model
as
well
but
the
body
simply
doesnt
match
the
chassis
i
can
only
imagine
that
this
model
is
supposed
to
have
a
chibi
look
much
like
the
microfighter
star
wars
models
comparison
the
following
section
shows
a
selection
of
images
from
different
angles
to
compare
the
main
and
secondary
model
the
main
model
has
a
bit
more
volume
while
the
alternate
model
has
a
more
sporty
look
front
view
the
main
model
has
headlights
which
are
attached
at
a
higher
point
while
the
alternate
model
has
headlights
which
are
placed
more
closely
next
to
each
other
rear
view
a
slightly
different
setup
in
both
models
where
the
main
model
again
has
higher
placed
rear
lights
side
view
the
side
view
shows
that
the
panels
are
used
differently
in
both
models
the
main
models
uses
them
as
doors
while
the
alternate
model
uses
them
as
engine
cover
bonnet
top
view
the
top
view
reveals
that
the
main
model
might
have
room
for
a
minifig
parts
left
the
left
image
shows
the
parts
which
are
left
after
building
the
main
model
while
the
second
image
shows
the
parts
left
after
building
the
alternate
model
as
you
can
see
the
main
model
uses
slightly
more
parts
than
the
alternate
model
features
besides
the
awesome
suspension
which
we
already
have
discussed
there
arent
a
lot
of
features
in
this
set
theres
actually
a
single
feature
which
is
only
present
in
the
main
modelopening
doors
wow
impressive
well
maybe
we
cant
expect
too
much
functionality
in
such
a
small
model
summary
the
offroader
is
a
fun
model
which
is
fairly
easy
to
build
the
suspension
is
simple
yet
very
effective
the
model
could
do
better
in
the
design
department
but
the
suspension
offers
great
playability
and
that
is
what
this
set
is
all
about
the
orange
parts
are
not
very
common
so
they
are
an
added
bonus
all
things
considered
this
set
is
definitely
worth
the
few
bucks
you
need
to
spend
on
it
pros
great
suspension
fun
to
play
with
some

so
alas
i
havent
a
copy

i
could
build
one
out

my

though
issued
today
for

id
buy
no
less
than
14
of
them

though
it
does
lack

was

considering
this

when
it
was
originally
announced
as
a

at
a
particularly
good
price
and
then
everything
changed

do
however
seriously
ache
to
get
my

on
one
of
the
more
traditionally

to

i
stopped
by
the
tru

or
lo
and
behold
the
new

mission
sets
obviously
i
bought
them
the
box
not
much
to
say
standard
box
art
for
mm
sets
nothing
new
the
parts
some
good
parts
here
even
if
you
dont
like
the
set
which
i
highly
doubt
after
ive
had
my
say
p
its
a
decent
parts
pack
i
noticed
that
some
old
parts
have
been
renewed
i
know
the
wheel
has
been
used
in
the
07
sets
but
the
cockpit
and
hitch
i
havent
seen
in
a
while
the
vldss
very
large
dss
grr
new
part
at
least
i
think
it
is
someone
slap
me
if
it
isnt
wacko
the
figs
i
know
ive
seen
that
head
before
but
i
have
no
idea
where
does
anyone
know
i
was
hoping
that
the
aliens
would
have
new
arms
at
least
i
was
sadly
mistaken
on
the
upside
i
finally
discovered
that
they
glow
in
the
dark
the
alien
has
a
jetpack
if
thats
not
the
silliest
thing
ive
ever
seen
i
dont
know
what
is
the
build
simple
build
a
block
so
easy
a
caveman
cou
oh
never
mind
geicos
used
that
one
enough
then
we
have
this
jobber
right
here
not
sure
what
it
is
but
it
looks
like
some
crystal
scanning
device
its
starting
to
look
pretty
nice
it
almost
looks
practical
the
cockpit
is
suffering
from
a
bad
dose
of
overstickering
on
the
upside
we
have
a
new
piece
there
to
hold
the
cockpit
on
part
1
complete
it
has
a
nice
little
radio
antenna
which
is
ruined
by
the
use
of
a
random
missile
that
looks
like
its
going
to
shoot
the
antenna
before
it
shoots
the
alien
still
i
never
say
no
to
a
good
missile
i
can
use
for
something
else
the
trailer
fairly
simple
but
it
works
it
features
stabilizing
arms
a
handheld
saw
and
an
extremely
random
minibot
whos
purpose
escapes
me
the
whole
meal
deal
erm
general
pics
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
good
set
in
fact
it
reminds
me
of
this
positive
finally
we
have
seen
the

pretty

not
as

as

peace
i
suppose
its
cute
if
you
like
that
sort
of
thing

as
for
the

hmm
not
actually
a
bad
set
not
high
on
my
to

other
things

definitely
a
possibility
somewhere
down

great
review
but
am
i
the
only
one
who
thinks
this
is
a
pretty
homely
looking
vehicle
the
small
exploration
robot
is
cool
but
the
large
windscreen
on
the
main
vehicle
reminds
me
about
jack
stone
i
also
think
the
bases
of
the
vehicle
parts
are
very
basic
and
look
almost
unfinished
with
the
holes
and
such
i
think
i
will
pass
this
one
even
though
the
alien
has
a
jet
pack
and
there
is
the
nice
mini
vehicle
negative
tks
for
the
great
review
mm
its
always
appreciated
to
have
reviews
of
new
set
having
said
that
i
really
dont
see
the
point
of
that
set
and
its
such
money
and
time
wasted
imo
i
dont
like
that
theme
apart
the
dropship
and
6wheeler
and
that
tiny
vehicle
doesnt
do
the
trick
for
me
i
see
it
as
a
really
cheap
excuse
to
try
and
please
classic
space
fan
with
that
horrendous
mm
graphics
and
what
amazes
me
is
that
you

ah

much
again
mr

this

probably
wont

thanks
for
posting
the
picture
of
this
new
mm
set
when
i
first
saw
the
mars
mission
sets
i
was
a
little
apprehensive
about
the
design
and
the
aliens
they
could
have
at
least
make
movable
arms
but
anyways
when
i
bought
the
small
fighter
i
was
totally
hook
my
fave
set
from
the
line
is
the
mech
positive
during
the
annual
thanksgiving
road
trip
to
the
relatives
i
stopped
by
the
tru
in
portland
or
lo
and
behold
the
new
mars
mission
sets
predictably
i
bought
them
i
present
to
you
the
mx41
switch
fighter
man
what
a
long
name
the
box
standard
mm
on
the
front
it
shows
the
fighter
in
flight
mode
and
a
yellow
note
telling
you
that
it
transforms
the
back
shows
three
pictures
showing
it
happen
the
parts
once
i
open
the
box
the
first
thing
that
comes
out
is
a
bent
and
rolled
up
instruction
booklet
and
i
was
forced
to
put
it
under
a
stack
of
beer
books
for
an
hour
then
theres
the
dss
yes
two
of
the
stickers
do
feature
a
cobra
i
wonder
why
because
this
sets
decal
should
be
a
beatle
xd
decent
parts
nothing
too
special
then
i
noticed
this
little
part
its
used
for
the
flickmissiles
but
i
have
no
idea
what
else
it
would
be
used
for
the
build
the
alien
ship
when
i
looked
at
the
box
art
for
this
set
i
was
releived
to
see
that
the
aliens
dont
have
another
curvedforward
wing
ship
instead
they
have
this
little
beauty
which
appears
to
be
the
alien
mini
cooper
small
and
hot
wub
anyway
partially
completed
even
if
you
dont
like
the
set
it
has
some
nice
green
flame
peices
which
work
nicely
for
space
laser
swords
fully
completed
the
only
annoying
bit
about
it
is
that
the
crystalholding
thing
in
front
wobbles
all
over
the
place
the
alien
fits
into
it
by
way
of
impalement
it
must
hurt
getting
in
and
out
switch
fighter
cockpit
the
set
makes
good
use
of
the
alpha
team
cockpit
for
controls
it
has
a
meagre
handlebar
that
the
astronaught
cant
even
reach
the
rear
shell
of
the
fighter
starts
out
around
the
alien
containment
chamber
its
a
bit
odd
that
the
containment
chamber
has
an
alien
sticker
because
the
instruction
booklet
lists
it
as
holding
crystals
the
crystal
canister
is
held
back
by
a
technic
pin
this
is
without
a
doubt
the
ugliest
color
arrangment
ever
warning
mass
stickers
x
the
cockpit
fits
into
grooves
in
the
shell
then
it
clicks
into
place
in
a
1x1
brick
with
a
horizontal
clip
the
wing
mechanism
the
wing
for
some
reason
the
body
of
the
mechanism
has
a
blue
brick
wacko
the
wing
and
mechanism
connect
to
prevent
the
fighter
doing
a
nosedive
while
in
tank
mode
the
wing
mechanism
completed
the
underside
the
body
and
wing
connect
by
way
of
a
miscolored
red
brick
i
have
no
idea
why
its
red
black
would
bave
been
much
much
better
completed
tank
mode
all
in
all
this
looks
pretty
neat
the
wheel
base
is
pretty
short
but
its
not
bad
transform
the
set
transforms
neatly
if
ungainly
without
antigrav
support
it
would
fall
forward
on
its
nose
each
time
it
transformed
jet
mode
its
all
right
but
it
could
be
a
bit
better
the
shell
keeps
slipping
back
forward
to
the
tank
mode
because
theres
nothing
to
stop
it
sliding
spare
parts
overall
i
thought
this
set
was
great
it
could
do
with
some
fixing
such
as
the
mismatched
colors
but
it
should
be
a
definate
buy

sweet
i
am
also
glad
that
it
is
a
very
different
alien
fighter
design
as
i
already
have
three
varients
of
the
old
type
the
fighter
transforms
better
than
i
thought
it
would
i
was
expecting
just
the
wings
i
should
be
buying
this

both

look

some
of

im
not

it
would

the

do
not

lame

dont
like

orange
wheels

i
dont
like
the

either
the
only
cool
thing
about
it
is
the
special
martian

they
should
ahve
sold

the
one
thing
youd
have
to
make
sure
of
though
is
that
it
was
fairly
light
and
the
wheel
base
had
a
fairly
large
surface
area
actually
thats
two
things
so
as
to
make
sure
it
didnt
dig
into
the
soil
if
that
happened
transformation
would
be
harder
as
the
wheels
would
dig
into
the
ground
and
drag
through
the
soil
then
itd
nose
dive
you
mean
the
ungainly
way
in
which
the
wheels
have
to
turn
in
order
to
change
from
tank
mode
i
think
you
are
right
as
well
on
the
other
hand
if
it
has
antigrav
then
it
doesnt
really
make
sense
to
have
wheels
as
well
i
mean
if
the
power
goes
then
the
wheels
cant
turn
anyways

thanks

the

a
comic
positive
thanks
for
that
very
neat
review
hinckley
y
this
set
looks
indeed
very
interesting
with
a
very
cool
antlike
look
and
a
simple
but
essential
overall
design
the
cockpit
seems
better
protected
than
many
other
ef
ones
that
spines
lovely
and
the
way
these
iron
dronesre
attached
is
simple
but
effective
and
hey
did
i
miss
something
orre
there
really
no
crappy
shooting
devices
p
thanks
to
the
minirobots
and
their
inventor
i
guess
positive
great
review

i
am
sure
to
get
this

great
review
as
always
hinckley
frankly
im
in
love
with
this
thing
so
much
so
in
fact
that
ive
been
calling
it
shadow
panther
for
weeks
but
never
mind
anyway
why
do
i
like
it
well
purple
is
such
a
fantastic
lego
colour
its
sparingly
used
which
makes
it
interesting
and
it
simply
looks
great
those
jetpackbackpack
things
the
robots
are
wearing
and
if
they
are
jetpacks
as
the
back
of
the
box
suggests
then
the
use
of
chaisaws
is
quite
nifty
and
innovative
the
minibot
is
cool
and
certainly
an
interesting
gimmick
sure
they
dont
look
quite
as
good
in
some
of
the
other
sets
but
here
it
looks
great
the
overall
structure
and
design
are
cool
too
its
always
nice
to
see
an
irregular
mech
and
this
is
no
exception
its
especially
cool
whee
the
spines
are
concerned
plus
on
top
of
all
that
its
got
a
nice
selection
of
parts
including
some
lovely
new
ones
and
the
inlaid
box
is
interesting
well
worth
getting
i
think
positive

this
designers
were
on
a
roll
with
this
one
until
it
came
to
the
flying
unit
it
looks
like
a
shambles
epecially
the
guns
looking
rather
simplistic
although
they
used
something
similar
to
the
light
and
sound
globe
peice
which
is
kind
of
neat
i
dont
think
ill
be
buying
this
but
your
review
almost
talked
me
into
it
cool
but
my
reviews
are
not
meant
to
sway
anyone
they
should
just
inform
people
further
as
if
they
want
to
buy
it
or
not
i
am
not
necessarily
for
encouraging
anyone
to
buy
every
set

glad
you
liked
it

you

did
feel

you
did
about
the

i
put

this
one
is
much
better
than
i
thought
i
didnt
expect
the
gun

the
turret
to
be
geared
i
agree
that
a
lot
of
the
details
sux
hollow
inside
lame
cockpits
but
as
an
overall
package
it
looks
quite
good
the
best
part
is
no
shooter
is
the
nightmare
finally
over
the
bonus
robot
is
a
much
better
idea
the
large
amount
of
blue

make
this
a
must

me

impartial

more
raw

was

absolutely
felt

for
the
storm
lasher

with
this
review
i
think
this
will
be
the
first
purchase
of
2008
for
me
i
totally
agree
with
you
on
how
the
spider
looks
better
without
minirobot
but
from
looking
at
where
the
cockpit
is
placed
and
how
the
skull
on
the
cockpit
is
lodged
underneath
the
walker
maybe
the
minirobot
would
look
better
mounted
underneath
the
head
that
way
it
looks
more
even
and
even
gives
the
thing
a
nasty
set
of

try
it

my
review

the
set
6265
sabre
island
overview
sabre
island
was
release
in
1990
an
it
contained
92
pieces
and
its
retail
price
was
1550
it
comes
with
3
imperial
blue
coats
and
a
nice
outpost
for
them
the
pictures
full
review
anyway
you
can
see
here
a
picture
of
the
box
the
model
shown
on
the
box
differs
from
the
actual
model
slightly
and
the
back
of
the
box
which
shows
some
nice
alternative
models
from
the
pieces
provided
a
close
up
of
two
or
three
of
the
alternative
models
and
now
for
the
minifigs
i
prefer
the
red
coats
over
the
blue
coats
but
these
minifigs
are
nice
and
for
the
number
of
pieces
one
gets
a
fair
amount
of
them
the
set
itself
makes
a
nice
small
outpost
it
comes
complete
with
a
palm
tree
a
cannon
with
ammo
on
a
turntable
a
small
tower
a
nice
large
imperial
flag
and
a
little
red
row
boat
here
is
a
shot
from
ground
level
showing
the
cannon
and
blue
coat
patrolling
the
out
post
the
rowing
boat
was
a
nice
touch
and
it
comes
with
a
small
flag
too
no
pirates
will
avoid
the
wrath
of
myself
and
my
mighty
island
the
top
of
the
tower
is
rather
plain
and
simple
which
in
some
ways
is
good
as
it
keeps
the
whole
set
detailed
yet
not
crowded
but
i
feel
a
little
something
should
of
been
added
to
the
top
though
the
back
is
lacking
any
type
of
walls
so
one
can
play
with
the
minifigs
inside
yet
their
are
also
no
stairs
or
any
other
ways
for
the
blue
coats
to
climb
up
their
tower
either

island
but
never
fear
the
lord
of

me
throwing
a
pie
at
captain
ironhook
from
another
angle
overall
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
if
somewhat
simple
set
and
makes
a
great
cheap
imperial
set

if

know
why
positive
i
gave
this
one
a
5
its
one
of
the
little
pirate
sets
i
had
during
my
youth
and
i
loved
it
for
several
reasons
first
of
all
it
contains
2
of
my
favorite
minifigs
it
can
be
used
as
a
small
independent
base
or
in
combination
with
one
of
the
bigger
sets
eldorado
or
trading
posts
as
a
lookup
or
outer
defense
besides
all
that
this
set
just
looks
beautiful
i
love
the
colors
blue
baseplate
and
the
whiteyellow
tower
one
of
the
best
littlemedium
sized
sets
ever
made
by
lego
positive
i
give
it
a
4
only
because
there
are
no
pirates
i
aways
loved
this
set
nice
little
fortifaction
lots
of
details
i
only

i
could

in

it

the

i
feel
a

liked

anything

be
honest
even
if
the

is
a

small
the
plate
itself
is
still
useful
and
the
rest
of
it
is
also
very
useful

ive
had
my
shell
service
station
set
6378
built
exactly
by
the
book
and
sitting
around
for
the
longest
time
with
the
recent
twinning
of
my
town
with
dr
sinister
i
needed
a
gas
station
that
could
handle
a
lot
more
traffic
especially
military
traffic
and
these
new
6wide
vehicles
xd
here
be
a
thumblink
to
the
original
station
at
bl
i
love
this
station
so
much
but
it
really
needed
some
modernization
the
reopening
of
this
station
received
a
lot
of
attention
even
the
local
police
stopped
right
over
one
big
upgrade
to
this
station
is
the
selling
of
propane
tanks
which
is
generally
a
rare
commodity
from
the
lego
towns
ive
seen
xd
also
at
this
service
station
is
a
propane
tank
refilling
station
the
milkman
is
our
first
propane
customer
the
interior
has
also
had
an
addition
and
many
upgrades
for
instance
this
building
now
has
florescent
lighting
a
big
frig
in
the
back
and
more
shelf
space
y
oh
look
theres
the
officer
purchasing
a
mountain
dew
now
that
theres
more
shelf
space
we
can
sell
more
than
just
1x1
round
yellow
bricks
and
levers
we
now
have
available
1x1
round
plates
and
1x1
round
cones
available
in
multiple
colors
d
with
this
upgraded
gas
station
hopefully
this
town
will
bring
in
more
business
and
customers
into
my
small
town
xd
p
positive
i
really
love
everything
you
did
with
this
gas
station
it
looks
very
cozy
amazing
how
you
said
you
built
it
by
the
book
does
that
mean
you
didnt
have
the
set
but
you
used
your
own
pieces
to
rebuild
the
thing
the
flourescent
lighting
is
genius
and
the
interior
space
looks
just
like
what
youd
see
at
those
little
shops
i
really
dig
the
moc
it
gives
me
good
ideas
and
now
i
want
a
gas
station
of
my
own
p
and
the
history
behind
how
it
was
rebuilt
and
how
it
will
improve
business
etc
is
so
cool

did

tru
portsmouth

this

comes
in

closeup

it

not
had
a

with
numbered

for
quite
a

at

in

ive
bought
recently
didnt

i
was

the
curved
pieces
had

if
they
could

the
att
curved
pieces
why
not
these

oh
and
theres

the

was

first
after
the
minifigures
quite
an
interesting
build
in
a
way
becayse
for
a
while
you
think
the
back
is
the
front
and
then
you
realise
heh
now
ive
not
seen
the
film
in
a
while
but
i
dont
recall
a
guy
flying
a
plane
with
a
fishing
rod
dont
flame
me
if
this
is
what
happens
see
earlier
point
regards
not
seeing
the
film
in
ages
p
after
that
you
build
the
temple
in
stages
starting
with
the
entrance
first
and
then
the
holey
floor
section
with
the
spears
these
spears
are
just
loosely
placed
into
technic
holed
bricks
quite
easy
to
make
em
flick
out
but
they
can
go
anywhere
hehe
entrance
holey
floor
spears
these
two
parts
are
hinged
and
on
an
angle
to
each
other
and
the
gap
makes
for
a
handy
bottomless
pit
complete
with
pole
for
indy
to
swing
over
with
his
whip
after
that
you
create
the
door
and
the
ratchet
mechanism
to
keep
it
raised
after
that
you
add
the
runners
for
the
ball
and
the
swinging
knives
trap
swords
trap
before
after
finally
you
build
the
statue
that
holds
the
efigy
nice
bit
of
construction
here
especially
the
way
that
everything
falls
over
once
the
efigy
is
removed
do
be
careful
when
putting
the
curved
bits
on
though
it
appears
one
of
the
edges
on
mine
has
slightly
bent
when
putting
it
on
nowt
noticable
though
temple
preparing
to
steal
run
you
can
see
that
the
temple
has
toppled
and
debris
has
fallen
all
around
and
then
as
he
goes
through
the
door
the
door
falls
he
gets
his
hat
and
then
the
rock
ball
starts
a
rolling
ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun
the
stickers
were
a
pain
though
theres
no
room
for
a
border
around
the
sticker
here
beware
after
all
that
is
done
you
join
all
the
pieces
together
and
it
makes
more
a
really
good
playset
plenty
of
opportunity
for
recreating

have

really
like

maybe
in

ill
have

negative
this
set
is
pretty
nice
i
love
the
idol
id
probably
buy
the
set
just
for
that
d
lol
is
it
just
me
or
in
the
earlier
concepts
of
this
set
we
saw
a
native
on
the
box
i
wonder
why
they
removed
it
wacko
neutral
i
just
noticed
another
inconsistency
between
box
art
and
the
actual
set
on
the
box
the
biplan
has
white
wing
supports
theyre
just
plane
windows
without
glass
in
them
and
yet
the
set
they
are
dark
grey
or
is
it
bley
can
never
tell
the
difference
without
careful
study
add
to
that
the
outer
of
the
engine
at
the
front
is
white
on
the
box
and
black
in
the
set
we
dont
normally
have
this
many
inconsistencies
do
we
neutral
because
of
exams
and
other
obligations
i
havent
posted
this
sooner
seeing
that
noone
else
has
reviewed
this
set
i
thought
i
might
as
well
do
it
myself
the
set
in
its
entire
glory
minus
the
slammer
instructions
and
the
obviously
massive
sticker
sheet
the
four
cars
included
in
this
set
a
muscle
car
a
sports
car
a
roadster
and
the
police
offroader
because
the
police
obviously
have
no
clue
that
an
offroader
is
useless
for
catching
streetracers
no
less
a
batmobileish
sports
car
it
will
always
trail
behind
but
the
police
have
a
trick
up
their
sleeve
the
drawbridge
gotcha
and
the
mechanism
that
makes
it
all
tick
the
motor
is
nothing
more
than
a
slow
pullback
motor
push
down
the
bridge
the
latch
will
hook
on
to
the
gear
and
keep
it
in
place
until
the
latch
is
released
and
theres
the
new
gas
station
staying
within
theme
this
gasstation
is
like
the
tanker
in
8147
from
the
company
fuel
4
speed
theres
a
notable
presence
of
detail
here
such
as
the
sodadispenser
water
coolant
bottles
and
other
accesories
two
fuel
pumps
and
bumperlevel
railings
to
prevent
cars
from
crashing
into
them
theres
no
interior
however
and
as
demonstrated
here
by
a
loyal
octanemployee
and
a
pursuing
officer
the
gas
station
is
built
to
minifigscale
my
impressions
of
this
set
as
a
collector
of
tiny
turbos
and
yet
to
miss
a
set
i
got
this
one
regardless
of
what
it
included
the
gas
station
is
indeed
very
nice
and
the
minifigscale
accesories
were
unexpected
the
lack
of
interior
is
no
big
issue
and
the
both
the
station
and
bridge
can
with
ease
be
implemented
into
a
minifig
town
the
bridge
also
solidly
built
and
includes
the
ramps
in
its
design
so
it
can
be
lifted
with
ramps
attached
without
breaking
apart
the
slammer
included
in
the
set
is
identical
apart
from
the
white
color
with
those
in
8147
the
cars
are
also
very
nice
altough
i
am
yet
to
get
used
to
the
yellow
batmobile
as
ive
grown
accustomed
to
calling
it
i
also
love
the
offroaders
chunky
tires
they
make
perfect
wheels
for
the
newer
minifigscale
cars
i
never
consider
priceparts
ratio
and
here
it
would
for
me
be
irrelevant
because
it
will
never
be
demolished
for
parts
the
play
value
is
what
i
would
consider
pretty
good
and
while
the
bridge
wont
rise
with
a
car
on
it
its
still
strong
enough
to
stay
open
with
a
car
tipping
over
the
edge
hmm
every
nerve
in
my
body
is
saying
that
this
sets
is
worth
roughly
810
so
verdict
810

such
a

read

how

does

do
not
resize
your
pics

are
perfect

large
thorough
and
clear
it
gives
anyone
who
really
wants
info
on

about
everything
they
need
to
know
about
it

had
no
idea

used
that
lil
thing
to
have
the
cement

spin
cool
idea
nice

perfect

thanks
much

positive
thanks
for
the
review
this
looks
like
a
nice
set
to
have
multiple
copies
of
i
think
that
you
may
have
mistyped
the
setnumber
as
i
was
expecting
this
cute
car
when
i
read
the
title
i
wondered
how
you
could
see
a
cementmixer
in
this
set
p
neutral
heres
all
the
parts
in
assorted
baggies
and
the
horribly
messed
up
instructions
four
astronauts
and
four
aliens
with
an
extra
gold
visor
yay
not
bad
the
base
of
the
horribly
unstable
alien
craft
the
wings
move
up
and
down
aswell
as
back
and
forth
the
purpose
i
know
not
next
we
build
the
nerf
section
of
the
base
basically
technic
and
the
rest
of
the
tube
connectors
heres
the
farthest
i
got
the
little
missle
to
go
its
fairly
dissapointing
good
thing
i
didnt
expect
much
from
this
portion
of
the
set
heres
the
start
of
the
command
base
more
of
the
main
structure
will
be
adding
lots
of
things
to
all
the
little
beams
heres
a
storage
container
and
the
surprisingly
not
flimsy
radar
on
this
side
we
see
the
alien
elevator
it
uses
a
horribly
long
technic
rod
i
have
not
seen
one
of
this
proportion
its
like
a
foot
and
a
half
long
more
of
the
inner
base
where
all
the
little
tubes
shall
go
all
the
connected
tubes
and
such
i
also
encountered
a
problem
in
the
instructions
it
says
for
the
end
of
the
elevator
prong
to
be
touching
the
tube
connector
where
it
is
shown
here
but
mine
has
a
1x
space
inbetween
no
matter
heres
the
completed
base
my
knee
again
onto
the
spaceship
the
bulk
of
it
is
just
technic
supporting
beams
with
some
large
slope
peices
covering
it
all
up
more
on
that
later
the
white
coverup
the
middle
section
lifts
up
to
store
the
overly
large
jetpack
as
you
see
the
storage
containers
take
up
most
the
bulk
in
the
back
and
you
can
see
the
jetpack
on
the
ground
aswell
as
the
trigger
hand
hold
thing
that
allows
you
to
swoosh
it
look
in
the
back
lego
greebles
despite
the
large
cockpit
it
only
holds
one
person
laying
down
the
wings
are
really
the
saving
grace
double
layered
with
a
nice
two
toned
effect
kitty
nudged
me
this
picture
so
its
abit
blurry
my
apologies
extra
peices
and
or
peices
i
have
no
idea
where
the
hell
they
go
p
overall
the
set
is
quite
fun
i
must
admit
full
price
i
probably
would
not
go
for
it
but
i
got
it
for
just
under
70
dollars
for
that
price
i
can
confidently
say
its
quite
worth
it
many
useful
peices
nice
figures
other
than
the
aliens
and
the
tube
things
are
quite
fun
to
boot
even
though
i
liked
the
life
on
mars
system
more
which
i
also
have
none
the
less
its
very
fun
to
make
them
shoot
around
alright
so
its
not
much
of
a
command
base
either
and
it
looks
abit
bare
but
its
still
fun
even
if
you
ignore
the
nerf
section
overall
i
give
it
a
hardy
35
out
of
5
the
openness
and
epic
fail
of
a
missile
launcher
are
hard
to
get
by
but
overall
its
a
dandy
set

merry
christmas

thanks
for
the
review
brickmaster
i
wanted
this
set
at
first
but
i
realized
i
dont
want
it
as
much
anymore
seems
like
a
waste
of
90
negative
thanks
for
this
review
lots
of
minifigs
is
a
plus
although
half
of
them
are
junk
jellies
but
dang
the
base
just
doesnt
seem
impressive
it
looks
so
cheap
like
a
skeleton
the
tubes
are
just
ridiculous
but
hey
at
least
it
comes
with
two
cool
spacecraft
thats
nice
positive
i
agree
it
does
seem
very
scarce
but
ive
taken
apart
the
nerf
launcher
made
a
new
module
with
the
tube
the
launcher
used
and
beefed
up
the
base
with
some
computers
and
other
things
for
90
dollars
i
would
pass
i
agree
on
sale
it
is
lovely
though
and
none
the
less
ive
been
entertained
for
ages
with
them
flyin
through
the

im
hoping
to
find
this
on

as
well
no
luck
so
far
i
love
the
white
ship
and
i
think
the
base
would
be
amusing
but
ultimately
hard
to
reuse
incidentally
that
long
axel
is
common
in
recent
technic

i
think
it
was
orignally
made

you

it
just
doesnt

there

so
here
it
is
the
long
expected
review
of
the
town
plan
i
bought
it
at
the
legostore
riem
arcaden
last
saturday
i
paid
14999
eur
for
1981
pieces
this
set
is
separated
in
4
parts
1
the
servicegasstation
2
the
cars
the
petrol
pump
and
the
fountain
3
the
cinema
4
the
town
hall
the
service
station
has
a
lot
of
really
nice
details
like
tools
for
the
car
repair
or
the
table
with
the
cashpoint
and
the
foodstation
theres
a
croissant
a
banana
and
a
apple
in
this
set
one
of
my
favourit
parts
is
the
trolley
with
some
tools
you
can
see
it
at
brickshelf
at
the
second
part
are
only
a
few
pieces
and
i
needed
not
much
time
to
built
the
2
cars
the
fountain
and
the
petrol
pump
theres
something
at
the
truck
i
dont
understand
maybe
i
did
something
wrong
but
the
truck
has
no
backlights
wacko
i
like
the
petrol
pump
thats
why
i
post
a
pic
of
it
the
cinema
is
the
highlight
for
me
it
has
also
really
nice
details
like
the
popcorn
table
or
the
gumball
or
candy
machine
the
colours
sheme
is
really
nice
the
front
of
the
building
with
the
big
displays
is
a
cool
idea
overall
a
really
nice
building
the
town
hall
has
also
a
really
nice
colour
sheme
i
love
that
dark
green
mixed
with
the
white
stairs
a
lot
of
plants
around
and
in
the
town
hall
as
you
can
see
some
figs
who
married
there
not
more
to
say
about
this
building
see
the
pics
and
enjoy
it
overall
this
set
is
a
must
have
it
was
really
fun
to
built
it
this
set
reminds
me
of
the
back
to
the
future
movie
with
michael
j
fox
the
whole
gallery
is
at
brickshelf

you
can
find

i

all
the
buildings
look
sweet
i
really
like
how
you
compared
the
look
to
back
to
the
future
when
i
saw
the
first
pics
i
thought
the
same
thing
the
look
of
the
set
is
definitly
the
1950s
i
am
to
see
the
price
though

which

market
streeet
town
plan
or
cafe
corner
just
curious
theyre
pretty
expensive
and
i
might
only
afford
one
of
them
i
guess
it
all
depends
on
what
you
are
after
kim
if
you
want
a
really
great
and
detailed
set
i
would
opt
for
the
cafe
corner
but
if
you
want
a
set
that
can
easilly
be
included
in
a
city
i
would
opt
for
town
plan
since
i
cant
afford
all
of
them
i
will
just
get
town
plan
because
i
lve
the
feeling
of
thge
set
and
that
theater
is
superb

i
tried
very
hard
to
remain
positive
in
my
critique
and
complimented
her
on
those
things
she
had
done
well
i
felt
that
given
the
somewhat
juvenile
omg
bestreviewever
tone
that
was
creeping
in
amongst
the
replys
that
it
needed
to
be
tempered
with
some
thoughtful
suggestions
as
to
how
a
good
review
could
be
made
great
your
ad
hominem
approach
is
offensive
and
far
more
negative
than
i
was
and
to
suggest
i
should
do
my
own
review
is
ridiculous
i
live
in
canada
and
we
do
not
even
have
the
set
available
here
yet
thus
i
am
interested
in
seeing
reviews
of
this
set
if
i
already
had
the
set
i
would
not
be
so
interested
and
next
time
you
propose
to
critique
a
critique
perhaps
you
should
actually
read
what
i
wrote
i
said
she
wrote
a
good
review
for
a
specific
audience
i
did
not
say
it
was
awful
or
whatever
you
seem
to
have
assumed
i
meant
saying
something
is
good
but
could
be
improved
can
hardly
be
characterized
as
bitching
positive
thanks
for
the
review
i
really
want
this
set
because
1
it
looks
fantastic
2
has
harder
to
find
colors
3
is
a
50th
anniversary
commemorative
4
some
of
the
models
are

truck
i
have
one
and
you
can

id

to

the

from
this

ef
indie
the

nabbed
the

the

figs
anakin
is
amazing
imo
wub
fits
the
cw
anie
great
i
noticed
on
the
sh
reviews
the
kiddies
were
saying
how
ugly
he
looked
they
need
to
see
the
cw
cartoon
for
the
sake
of
my
health
i
should
probably
stop
reading
those
d
the
build
i
wont
go
too
indepth
on
the
build
since
vader
posted
a
very
indepth
review
here
the
start
of
the
build
the
body
of
the
fighter
starts
out
long
and
skinny
the
jsfs
landing
gear
allows
it
to
sit
comfortably
without
getting
in
the
way
while
swooshing
r2d2s
launching
device
r2
in
position
when
launched
he
often
gets
stuck
if
you
dont
press
the
button
hard
enough
looks
like
r2
needs
to
lay
off
whatever
it
is
robots
eat
so
far
the
flag
stickered
its
a
big
sucker
sticker
completed
i
forgot
to
add
the
nose
stickers
before
i
took
the
pic
warning
the
nose
cone
sticker
is
actually
two
stickers
i
thought
it
was
one
peeled
of
one
of
the
stickers
and
put
it
on
the
middle
of
the
two
1x8
plates
and
didnt
notice
the
other
sticker
wacko
various
completed
shots
i
think
this
was
a
beautiful
little
set
r2s
launching
unit
and
the
flick
missiles
are
annoying
but
easily
fixed
i
plan
to
add
proper
cannons
in
place
of
the
flick
missiles
anakin
is
a
great
minifig
but
he
doesnt
look
so
well
standing
next
to
my
other
figs

than
kyou
for
the
review
i
dont
know
if
i
buy
this
set
now
i
know
theres
also
a
anakin
in
the
atte
with
a
new
jedi
but
who
knows
positive
wow
im
surprised
no
one
had
done
this
already
first
off
this
is
a
truly
lovely
set
that
many
people
should
own
even
though
its
sold
out
on
the
sh
now
lets
start
off
with
an
overview
note
i
was
missing
a
few
of
the
pieces
the
rabbit
the
trike
when
i
toke
the
pics
the
figs
and
a
cat
the
engine
i
really
love
this
thing
its
a
beautiful
060
steam
engine
with
a
tender
this
is
probably
the
most
detailed
steam
engine
lego
has
given
us
i
loved
it
so
much
i
made
a
nonholiday
version
for
my
town
the
flat
cars
i
like
these
but
they
seem
a
bit
simple
their
cargo
is
good
for
christmas
or
a
birthday
party
the
passenger
car
it
resembles
the
green
passenger
car
we
got
a
while
back
but
i
like
the
interior
in
this
one
a
bit
better
the
caboose
a
simple
caboose
like
the
one
from
2001
the
sad
thing
about
it
is
thats
there
is
no
interior
and
its
hard
to
take
the
roof
off
overall
i
like
this
set
but
it
is
kind
of
hard
to
use
during
the
non
winter
months
the
price
is
kind
of
good
but
with
that
price
it
should
have
came
with
the
motor
i
give
it
a
910
happy
new
year

were
halfoff
at

and
i
just

now
theyre

for

i
was
fortunate
enough
to
get
one
along
with
the
hobby
train
they
are
the
first
trains
i
have
ever
owned
mainly
by
virtue
of
them
having
been
half
price
its
a
fantastic
selection
of
parts
with
the
holiday
train
as
well
as
it
really
looking
the
part
as
a
set
im
happy
not
to
get
a
motor
as
i
think
the
9v
setup
would
prove
expensive
and
the
ir
control
system
for
the
rc
setup
seems
a
bit
poor
i
got
some
dead
track
for
with
it
to
have
just
as
a
push

for
now
positive
okie
guys
and
gals
here
s
time
for
some
droid
exploration
with
my
review
of
set
7670
as
a
general
statement
i
have
to
say
its
really
a
neat
set
that
is
not
that
expensive
for
what
it
holds
1
box
art
like
always
i
will
start
with
pics
of
the
box
art
btw
notice
anything
guys
no
bloody
crappy
dss
yes
finally
a
set
without
stickers
and
that
feels
great
d
2
the
mfs
nothing
really
spectacular
there
the
only
novelty
lies
within
the
inclusion
of
the
new
commander
yellow
torso
bd
apart
from
that
there
are
2
bds
and
unfortunately
yet
another
sbd
i
like
those
but
i
have
a
huge
amount
of
them
and
i
would
rather
had
something
different
you
have
3
short
blasters
and
a
couple
of
extra
parts
3
the
spider
droid
i
think
its
a
pretty
cool
little
buggar
its
a
rather
simple
yet
classic
construction
i
think
it
has
sweet
parts
such
as
the
bd
body
in
dark
bley
it
really
has
a
spider
feel
unlike
the
previous
ep3
one
4
the
hailfire
droid
this
baby
represents
the
pice
de
resistance
of
this
set
i
truly
love
it
sure
its
a
bit
under
scale
but
i
dont
really
mind
that
its
conception
is
superb
even
if
i
totally
dislike
assembling
those
technic
treads
especially
80
of
those
small
things
the
ellipse
of
the
treads
is
well
balanced
and
that
trans
disc
is
a
brilliant
idea
the
great
thing
is
those
new
flick
fire
missiles
they
dont
fall
unlike
the
other
ones
and
they
do
look
good
on
this
baby
also
you
can
put
the
wheels
together
and
the
missiles
to
gain
some
shelf
space
easy
storage
on
d
in
conclusion
those
druids
re
really
sweet
and
are
perfect
target
practice
for
the
upcoming
rgs
hehe
i
hope
you
enjoyed
that
review
and
do
not
hesitate
to
comment
and
ask
pic
requests

any

hey

i
find
myself
saying
that

alot
d
i
love
these
two
little
sets
wub
tlc
continues
the
great
city
line
that
started
in
07
and
continues
into
08
its
also
nice
to
have
other
sub
lines
besides
fire
and
police
p
i
hope
there
are
many
more
postal
sets
like
a
post
officethat
would
be
sweet
hope
these
are
mainstream
and
not
those

could
you
tell
me
how
much
you
payed
for

i
think
im
gon
na
buy
them
tomorrow
if
they
have
it
already
or
if
i
dont
see
any
cooler
sets
i
paid
a
tad
more
than
the
sh
price
i
paid
15
for
the
plane
and
8
for
the
van
sure
its
a

more
expensive
but
i
didnt
want
to
wait
for
tru

get
them

am
i
the
first
one
to
notice
the
new
doors
used
in
the
back
of
the
van
not
only
is
it
using
the
popular
new
frame
but
the
old
container
doors
have
been
redesigned
to
fit
with
the
new
frame
as
well
pity
theyre
not
yellow
though
great
remark
there
i
guess
i
totally
missed
that
one
and
i
agree
that
yellow
doors
would
have
been
better
but
those
dark
bley
do
not
look

bad

can
you
tell

though
the

rubber
or
plastic
they
look
a
bit
tacky
rubber
off
course
they
do
look
a

tacky
but
its
because
they
are
the
thin
type

with

i
reckon
lego
could
enhance
this
subtheme
by
releasing
a
post
motorbike
with
or
without
a
sidecar
and
post
office
obviouly
the
office
would
be
the
hub
of
all
the
activity
while
the
post
bike
would
take
care
of
the
postal
run
this
would
free
up
the
van
to
take
or
recieve
bulk
mail
or
parcels
to
or
from
the
airport
it
could
then
also
do
the
parcel
deliveries
around
the
city
the
office
would
also
serve
as
the
reciever
for
all
the
parcels
the
new
goods
truck
might
deliver
so
true

at
one
point
i
was
thinking
of
a
impulse
set
with
a
yellow
bike
postman
post
and
letters
that
would
rock
i
hope
tlc
adds
to
this
sub
theme
and
keeps
that
retro
feel
wub
a
yellow
dirtbike
with
sidecar
would
be
a
sweet
5
set
also
a
small
town
feel
post
office
would
be
so
cool
like
a
2030
set
we
can
be
sure
of
one
thing
though
this
years
advent
calendar
will
have
a
postamn
and
small

post
on

thanks
for
the
review
i
was
actually
considering
getting
these
but
i
saw
they
were
overpriced
for
my
tastes
too
bad
theyre
nifty
lil
things
wub
positive
while
the
plane
does
look
nice
i
dont
particularly
care
for
the
van
but
the
van
does
have
some
good
parts
which
is
the
only
reason
i
would
by

the

the

on

hmmm
well
i
have
to

im
not
at
all
impressed
with
any
of
these

i
mean
there
nice
and
all
but
the
van
just
seems
way
to
small
it
would
have
been
nice
if
you
could
fit
more
than
one
package
in
it
i
guessim
one
of
those
that
are
more
of
the
fan
of
the
6
wide
trucks
and
the
plane
hm
this
has
a
cute
factor
and
all
but
i
mean
comon
you
have
to
open
a
hatch
on
the
roof
to
get
your
packages
in
and
what
about
getting
them
out
you
have
to
flip
the

upside

they
should
have
had

them
in

even
if
i
have
to
wait
2
or
3
months
i
know
that
i
will
save
some
money
so
i
will
buy
more

there
are

good

b
this

is
just
too
foreign
to
my
eyes
for
me
to

i
dont
like
either
of
these

very
disapointing
the
postal
theme
has
so
much
potential
i
dont
really
like
the
torsos
either
too
plaincheap
as
kanal
suggested
and
i
will
agree
that
the
wheels
on
the
van
look
cheap
i
was
sooooo
impressed
with
city
2007
this
is
a
real
let
down
though
i
am
happy
to
see
a
small
set
with
a
postal
box
so
even
though
all
that
aside
ill
probably
buy
6
of
the
van
just
for
the
yellow
mudgards
postal
box
and
stickers
to
populate
my

i

will
provide
some

my
personal
preference
is
for

the

van
is
nice

small
and
should
fit
well
with
my

plates
and
1990s
cars
from
the

note
did
anyone
notice
the
message
on
the
back
of
both
sets
boxes
designed
for
easy
building
and
instant
play
it
surprised
me
a
little
since
these
sets
seem
no
less
complex
than
any
other
city
set
of
late
they
look
like
quick
builds
sure
but
not
as
though
the
designers
went
out
of
their
way
to
simplify
them
positive
thanks
yoda
for
the
great

i
love
the
airplane
its
really
cute
the
van
needed
to
grow
on
me
though
but
you
did
the
trick
i
dont
like
the
wheels
of
the
van
they
will
need
replacing
and
wouldnt
everything
have
been
better

they
were

overall
you

with
these

i
paid
289

for
this
little

so
thats
a
great

sadly
the
only

avaible
were
these

no

this
one
by
as
i
was

for
the

at

plus
i
was
itching
to
do
another

since
i
had
finally
fully
recovered
from
my
marathon
ucs
falcon
review
which
took
the
better
part
a
month
to
complete
the
box
the
box
is
pretty
standard
creator
type
box
which
shows
off
the
three
models
beach
house
caf
and
towering
apartment
building
the
back
of
the
box
shows
some
of
the
features
of
the
three
models
interesting
features
of
the
three
models
prominently
displayed
on
the
back
include
food
counter
complete
with
coffee
espresso
maker
and
food
warmer
with
chicken

home
office
complete
with

and
the
ubiquitous
coffee

note
the
satellite
tv
dish
and
even
rain
gutters
along
the
roofline
opening
the
box
is
a
matter
of
breaking
two
seals
were
back
to
the
reusable
cereal
box
type
tab
system
that
we
saw
so
often
in
2007
sets
note
the
parts
inventory
is
on
the
side
of
the
box
as
well
this
is
a
nice
feature
once
inside
the
box
we
are
greeted
by
eight
sealed
bags
plus
two
yellow
16x2
plates
and
a
green
32x16
baseplate
thank
goodness
there
is
no
dss
dreaded
sticker
sheet
but
alas
there
are
no
minifigs
in
addition
there
are
the
three
manuals
one
for
each
model
and
they
were
stuffed
into
my
box
with
the
care
of
kid
trying
to
put
10
gallons
or
liters
if
you
prefer
of
candy
in
a
5
gallon
bucket
but
hey
were
not
collecting
manuals
here
so
who
cares
if
the
manuals
are
all
bent
and
warped
the
manuals
the
three
manuals
are
74
72
and
48
pages
in
length
they
are
laid
out
well
and
are
pretty
standard
with
all
the
usual
trimmings
piece
call
outs
for
each
step
parts
inventory
at
the
end
of
the
primary
model
build
page
numbers
color
separation
in
these
manuals
were
fine
for
me
plus
we
get
the
usual
verbose
lego
instructions
on
not
dumping
all
your
pieces
outside
in
the
grass
and
not
to
dump
all
your
pieces
into
a
single
pile
thanks
for
the
tip
tlg
parts
list
the
pieces
pretty
standard
stuff
here
and
as
i
mentioned
lots
of
1x1
plates
and
tiles
at
least
100
however
we
do
get
quite
a
few
windows
and
a
couple
of
doors
a
majority
of
the
color
is
black
and
yellow
i
did
see
a
few
pieces
that
i
was
not
familiar
with
so
im
going
to
show
them
below
keep
in
mind
im
not
a
parts
jockey
so
bear
with
me
if
i
think
a
part
is
brand
new
for
2008
and
it
was
actually
released
with
the
classic
space
line
2x2
window
fixed
and
4x3
window
that
opens
the
follow
photo
shows
the
window
glass
same
as
in
corner
caf
door
glass
and
new
black
parts
turns
out
these
black
parts
are
used
as
wheels
i
showed
the
window
glass
because
it
still
contains
the
molding
circle
just
like
they
did
before
it
is
hard
to
see
from
the
photo
but
it
is
there
the
door
glass
i
think
might
be
new
i
dont
recall
seeing
these
2x2
round
plates
with
clips
before
and
i
thought
i
would
show
the
mail
only
because
it
is
printed
and
not
a
sticker
i
know
these
are
common
but
didnt
they
have
four
studs
on
top
these
only
have
two
how
about
this
sloped
4x3
window
that
opens
overall
a
nice
assortment
of
parts
with
nothing
juniorized
the
build
the
build
was
fun
and
was
fairly
straightforward
once
you
figure
out
which
of
the
three
models
to
build
it
goes
pretty
quick
here
are
a
few
shots
see
how
the
inside
is
made
look
at
the
detail
with
the
flowers
and
even
the
outside
water
faucet
outdoor
seating
area
upstairs
being
built
upstairs
with
opening
roof
notice
the
satellite
tv
dish
check
out
the
patio
on
the
upstairs
complete
with
outdoor
light
and
rain
gutters
heres
my
favorite
the
bbq
grill
at
least
we
know
where
those
new
parts
go
finally
check
out
the
tree
no
juniorization
here
here
is
what
is
left
over
so
far
i
have
only
built
the
primary
model
the
others
look
interesting
especially
the
caf
the
design
the
design
was
well
done
very
rich
in
detail
i
love
how
there
are
no
juniorized
parts
the
house
is
accessible
by
taking
off
the
top
floor
like
caf
corner
and
market
street
there
is
an
internal
staircase
as
well
there
is
no
interior
to
speak
of
in
the
beach
house
but
there
is
in
the
other
two
models
the
only
real
negative
is
that
it
is
kind
of
small
when
you
get
it
done
it
would
be
nice
if
it
was
about
50
bigger
here
are
a
few
views
of
the
beach
house
with
a
few
minifigs
thrown
in
check
out
the
closeup
of
the
caf
which
i
think
looks
great
also
here
is
a
photo
of
the
interior
of
the
apartment
building
where
you
can
see
the
office
and
computer
overall
thoughts
it
is
a
really
nice
set
a
tad
on
the
small
side
but
it
has
some
great
detail
and
lots
of
features
quick
enough
to
build
all
three
models
and
would
fit
real
nice
into
an
existing
town
plan
is
minifig
scale
but
does
not
come
with
any
lots
of
window
parts
and
black
slopes
is
a
nice
diversion
from
the
onslaught
of
clone
wars
ships
that
we
cant
remember
seeing
from
the
movies
final
rating
84
build
910
pretty
quick
and
fun
functionality
910
it
is
a
creator
set
so
you
have
multiple
varied
builds
diverse
enough
to
keep
the
kids
entertained
design
1010
excellent
and
well
thought
out
outstanding
detail
for
such
a
small
model
parts
610
fair
nothing
earthshattering
but
lots
of
slopes
and
windows
price
810
price
ratio
is
good
but
you
get
a
lot
of
little
parts
would
be
better
with
minifigs

i
did
see
a
few
pieces
that
i
was
not
familiar
with
so
im
going
to
show
them
below
keep
in
mind
im
not
a
parts
jockey
so
bear
with
me
if
i
think
a
part
is
brand
new
for
2008
and
it
was
actually
released
with
the
classic
space
line
i
know
these
are
common
but
didnt
they
have
four
studs
on
top
these
only
have
two
how
about
this
sloped
4x3
window
that
opens
as
for
the
fence
i
know
only
the
2stud
version
8
and
the
window
was
used
a
lot
in
the
80s
and
90s
even
in
the
2004
city
airport
dont
worry
im
not
complaining
it
just
came
to
my
mind
because
today
i
rebuild
my
7866
from
1983
which
had
2
of
these
babys
positive

i
also
added
a
kitchen
a
vine
in
the
backyard
storage
for
the

thanks
for
the
review
dunamis
this
is
a
great
little
set
im
also
very
impressed
with
takuto20s
mods
ive
been
trying
a
few
of
my
own
i
liked
the
tower
block
design
but
a
lot
of
stuff
needed
fixing
firstly
i
added
a
4th
wall
and
made
it
so
the
storeys
could
be
lifted
off
like
in
the
other
models
i
also
added
flowers
on
the
windowsills
and
doorways
out
on
to
the
balconies
still
to
be
added
is
an
extra
door
for
the
top
floor
which
im
going
to
get
from
the
new
doors
and
windows
pack
i
added
a
chimney
that
goes
all
the
way
up
the
back
of
the
house
and
has
a
fireplace
on
every
level
each
floor
is
fully
furnished
with
a
fireplace
wash
basin
and
bed
on
the
upper
levels
and
a
corner
sofa
and
coffee
table
plus
an
extra
large
fireplace
on
the
ground
floor
finally
here
is
my
idea
of
what
to
do
with
two
copies
of
this
set
all
the
parts
pictured
are
from
2x
4996
except
5
extra
fence
panels
and
the
minifigs
the
house
on
the
left
has
its
garden
at
the
rear
positive
1
before
buying
even
if
i
am
city
fan
those
new
sized
planes
are
really
not
mine
cup
of
tea
my
love
to
lego
is
firmly
frozen
somewhere
between
years
19801995
main
reason
to
buy
was
that
i
wanted
to
write
a
review
at
czech
afol
web
kostkyorg
i
bought
it
three
days
ago
via
web
advertising
price
was
35
usd
2
after
opening
the
box
as
presumed
some
very
big
parts
and
three
bags
and
as
an
additional
bonus
lot
of
danish
air
free
of
charge
first
sight
told
me
that
this
will
be
really
short
and
easy
building
3
impressions
during
building
and
it
was
really
true
30
minutes
of
lazy
building
bag
1
plane
bag
2
plane
gondols
with
supports
bag
3
wings
and
propellers
when
i
saw
the
way
how
is
this
plane
made
i
was
strongly
thinking
to
play
money
for
nothing
from
dire
straits
as
a
music
accordant
with
whole
set
4
impressions
after
building
lookout
juniorized
creeps
this
is
my
first
plane
in
this
scale
and
for
99
the
last
one
lack
of
details
lot
of
ugly
big
parts
from
whole
set
you
can
see
the
main
development
target
to
keep
rrp
at
some
certain
low
level
inner
space
of
airplane
absolutely
undone
no
details
no
luggage
no
computers
nothing
at
all
just
a
lot
lot
of
air
the
very
only
details
in
whole
plane
are
the
stickered
pilots
desk
and
some
kind
of
seat
constuction
5
impressions
after
building
playability
but
what
is
playability
at
this
set
hydroplane
which
can
not
float
as
seen
on
enclosed
photos
if
tlc
will
make
some
new
kind
of
big
parts
used
for
gondolas
to
make
the
plane
floating
they
will
for
sure
make
no
other
damage
juniorization
couldnt
be
higher
you
even
can
not
drive
across
the
carpet
with
the
plane
so
how
to
play
open
the
doors
open
the
cabin
part
and
turn
with
propellers
weak
weak
weak
6
resumed
impressions
sadly
i
must
say
that
at
limited
release
sets
tlc
boat
seems
to
sailing
to
the
worst
part
of
the
coast
after
quite
good
7344
perfect
7899
and
7900
strange
but
acceptable
7998
juniorization
came
back
with
7906
followed
with
this
ugly
playmobilized
7732
7
final
word
in
fact
even
15
usd
seems
to
be
too
much
for
this
kind
of
set
35
usd
expected
rrp
in
our
country
is
really
overpriced
to
hell
neither
set
nor
minifig
is
not
interesting
tlc
maybe
knows
about
juniorization
as
well
as
nowhere
on
the
box
the
number
of
pieces
isnt
written
if
you
my
afol
friends
want
to
spent
your
bucks
better
give
half
of
the
price
to
african
orphans
you
will
save
your
money
and
you
will
have
a
good
feeling
all
the
photos
you
can
see
below
as
i
can
not
upload

3
thats

that
make
me
laugh
and
which
has
a
plain

at
last
you
should
have
notice
that
that
the
first
submarine
with
a

made
of
several
plates
it
is
said
that
this

has
more
than
200

you
may
have
lost

concerning

this

is
really
a
hot
candidate
not

for

for

i

i
have
to
agree
with
almost
all
of
the
replies
here
that
this
set
is
the
most
ugliest
looking
lego
set
i
have
ever
seen
if
i
have
never
seen
this
set
and
ppl
showed
it
to
me
i
would
have
thought
it
would
be
some
little
kids
moc
or
something
no
offence
huge
juniorized
pieces
bad
color
theme
i
would
say
it
would
look
better
if
the
wing
is
white
no
interior
and
huge
dss
i
will
avoid
this
set
like
the
plague
i
own
the
entire
city
line
except
for
the
airport
and
planning
to
get
all
the
city
stuff
that
lego
releases
but
this
set
will
ruin
my
plans
coz
i
will
avoid
it
unless
someone
gives
it
to
me
for
free
haha

ill
probably
get
the
nice
green
cargo
plane
but
not
this
how

the

pieces
be
used

full
size
jets
and
whats
supposed
to
be
a
small
seaplane

this
still
looks
like
a
cool

but
the
price
not
so
much
do
all

come
with

like
a
cool
set
but
the
price
not
so
much
the
price
is
now
$
20
in
ireland
on
sh
which
is
reasonable
considering
the
large
fuselage
pieces
has
anyone
modded
this
set
to
make
a
reasonable
looking
plane
i
am
thinking
of
buy
it
to
do
so
but
i
dont
want
to
take
a
risk
and
end
up
with
lots
of
useless
pieces
aswell
as
$
20

review

as
ive
said
before
this
is
a
nice
set
but
doesnt
really
come
with
anything
that
doesnt
come
with
the
other
sets
of
the
line
for
this
reason
it
will
be
somewhere
at
the
bottom
of
my
list
for
2008
also
i
like
torso
and
helmet
of
the
dwarf
mining
orcs
much
better
the
colours
make
the
torso
look
rather
dull
and
boring
while
the
other
more
brown
one
looks
much
clearer
and
more
exciting
i
think
i
like
the
knight
helmet
better
too
looks
more
covering
and
threatening
than
this
one
although
ill
save
my
judgement
until
i
have
one
in

the

how

my

grip
with

you
can

fit

pallet

should
have
been
the
same
size
as
the

you
can

fit
2

else
mentioned

well
i

the

thing
when
i
went
to
load
it
neutral
i
got
this
set
last
week
and
just
to
add
a
few
of
my
own
points
cons
the
forklift
spring
feels
a
bit
flimsy
i
dont
know
how
long
it
will
last
or
how
much
stress
it
would
take
and
the
end
coil
isnt
really
heavily
secured
to
the
lift
mechanism
time
will
tell
on
that
one
30
stickers
its
the
exoforce
of
city
sets
the
truck
set
does
look
less
plain
with
them
on
though
i
would
reccomend
lining
them
up
with
the
green
brick
in
the
second
container
rather
than
applying
the
first
lot
without
a
guide
or
they
may
end
up
uneven
its
very
hard
to
put
the
minifig
in
the
forklift
without
dismantling
or
breaking
open
the
set
slightly
the
cargo
box
attached
to
the
main
cabin
of
the
truck
doesnt
hold
very
strongly
minifigs
are
dull
that
dark
blue
torso
with
pattern
is
way
overused
green
stickers
are
a
different
green
to
the
bricks
themselves
pros
lots
of
nice
pieces
including
the
large
white
panels
and
cargo
pieces
and
i
like
the
green
white
colour
scheme
the
cargo
doors
open
well
and
the
hingeing
mechanism
doesnt
stand
out
to
the
detriment
of
the
rest
of
the
set
as
some
people
have
complained
about
the
mail
airplane
studless
floor
in
cargo
containers
makes
it
easy
to
move
pallets
in
and
out
fits
in
better
than
the
heavy
hauler
to
a
minifig
sized
city
new
1x1x4
slope
at
least
i
hadnt
seen
it
before
overall
nice
set
with
some
good
pictures
although
a
bit
flimsy
and
way
too
many
stickers
the
same
issues
i
have
with
the
cargo
plane
as
well
although
that
had
more
colour
issues

am
neutral
greetings
and
welcome
to
another
redman
review
im
your
host
redman
and
today
i
adorn
my
medieval
outfit
to
tell
you
about
the
impulse
set
simply
titled
the
knight
no
wait
thats
the
old
script
xd
i
mean
the
good
wizard
sweet
the
other
castle
impulse
set
the
first
being
the
knight
this
is
a
wonderful
and
in
my
case
unexpected
addition
to
the
castle
line
i
did
not
expect
to
get
a
nice
good
wizard
but
rather
another
plain
white
skellie
for
the
impulse
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
when
i
saw
the
first
picture
of
this
set
the
impulse
sets
give
you
pieces
you
wouldnt
expect
to
see
in
such
small
sets
for
example
the
knight
came
with
the
armour
and
this
comes
with
an
owl
a
gem
and
a
crystal
ball
piece
it
comes
with
11
pieces
including
the
wand
owl
and
gem
and
no
spares
which
doesnt
really
matter
as
it
doesnt
need
any
the
box
sports
the
set
number
age
range
which
i
blissfully
ignore
xd
awesome
castle
logo
and
the
assembled
set
with
the
usual
11
scale
picture
of
a
minifig
the
back
of
the
box
shows
pictures
of
the
boxed
skeleton
tower
and
kings
castle
siege
sets
note
the
price
is
in
new
zealand
dollars
and
is
really
the
same
prica
as
any
other
impulse
set
next
are
the
instructions
which
are
separated
into
3
parts
1
for
the
minifigure
1
for
the
table
and
one
for
the
bird
stand
very
simple
also
worth
mentioning
is
the
parts
numbers
are
next
to
their
respective
parts
for
replacement
parts
etc
on
the
back
we
see
on
the
top
half
pictures
of
skeleton
prison
carriage
skeleton
tower
and
kings
castle
siege
this
time
not
of
the
boxed
sets
but
the
sets
themselves
on
the
lower
half
we
have
8
pictures
each
of
the
different
impulse
sets
the
wizards
torso
is
plain
sand
blue
with
no
patterns
or
anything
but
it
doesnt
really
matter
is
his
beards
in
the
way
the
head
is
that
same
old
white
fade
to
grey
beard
head
but
the
white
beard
covers
up
most
of
the
grey
my
favourite
part
is
the
pants
i
love
that
were
getting
printed
belts
and
legs
again
his
belt
has
4
gold
crosses
as
seen
in
if
you
look
closely
the
new
crownies
torso
and
the
crownie
archers
torso
and
a
belt
buckle
and
the
legs
have
a
bottle
a
coin
and
a
small
bag
nice
little
wizardey
items
the
er
items
no
accessories
no
models
the
stuff
in
the
set
include
a
little
stand
for
the
owl
and
a
table
utilising
the
new
4x4
round
piece
in
light
bley
with
the
crystal
ball
in
the
middle
encasing
the
yellow
gem
held
on
by
a
2x2
circle
piece
in
blue
why
blue
im
not
sure
maybe
its
because
the
crystal
is
yellow
and
the
crownies
colours
are
blue
and
gold
so
the
blue
piece
with
the
yellow
crystal
symbolise
the
crownies
colours
or
maybe
tlc
just
felt
the
need
to
include
an
odd
colour
p
in
conclusion
this
is
a
wonderful
set
with
some
neat
accessories
and
it
doesnt
really
need
to
be
bought
in
the
masses
after
all
you
needs
an
army
of
owls
and
wizards
p
so
it
works
fine
as
a
single
set
and
adds
a
more
fantasy
feel
to
your
crownie
army
thats
all
for
today
folks
sweet
redman
thanks
for
reading
another
of
my
redman
interviews
any
suggestions
on
how
towhat
to
do
to
improve
it
is
greatly
appreciated
as
are
all
comments
and
criticisms
except
those
blatant
thoughtless
criticisms
that
dont
help
at
all
p
peace

picking

along
with
a
few
of
the

i
actually
prefer
the
wizard
as
these
impulse
items
are
simply
too
expensive
for
army
building
imo
later
same
thats
why
ill
probly
only
get
the
wizard
because
they
are
quite
expensive
if
you
compare
them

2
ones

used

also

here

expected

wub
positive
well
since
noone
seems
to
have
done
one
for
this
set
here
we
go
heres
the
complete
set
in
all
its
glory
yes
i
really
like
it
but
then
tabletown
has
the
capacity
to
support
it
and
my
green
army
have
their
eyes
on
it
as
a
potential
military
transport
as
well
ill
start
out
with
the
little
airport
ground
car
thingy
very
neat
and
functional
here
are
views
front
and
back
next
up
the
steps
which
allow
the
plane
crew
to
embark
and
disembark
and
to
round
off
this
little
trio
the
cargo
loading
platform
here
in
its
lowered
position
note
the
prong
thingy
sticking
out
from
the
rear
and
here
raised
the
prong
thingy
is
now
hinged
up
to
support
the
back
of
the
platform
and
keep
it
level
heres
a
slightly
different
angle
so
you
can
see
the
pieces
under
there
the
allimportant
cargo
itself
hmmmnot
much
for
a
plane
this
size
the
cargo
pallet
slots
neatly
onto
the
loading
platform
heres
the
complete
set
of
ground
equipment
all
attached
and
so
onto
the
plane
itself
note
that
unlike
the
other
large
planes
the
main
wing
sits
at
the
top
of
the
row
of
bricks
making
up
the
side
of
the
fuselage
i
took
it
apart
a
little
so
you
can
see
the
internal
construction
of
the
fuselage
note
that
the
cargo
area
is
really
small
right
at
the
back
what
else
is
this
thing
carrying
illegal
immigrants
a
picture
of
the
rear
of
the
fuselage
just
because
i
like
the
sticker
front
landing
gear
way
better
than
on
the
other
large
planes
i
dont
know
if
this
is
a
new
piece
or
what
but
ive
had
no
problems
with
it
at
all
and
my
kids
have
been
playing
with
it
as
well
the
rather
sexy
rear
undercarriage
this
area
reminds
me
of
one
of
those
giant
russian
transport
planes
wicked
those
angled
grey
slopes
atop
each
side
of
the
rear
undercarriage
annoy
the
heck
out
of
me
as
they
keep
coming
off
whenever
i
pick
the
plane
up
i
think
a
1x4
plate
on
top
to
bind
them
together
might
solve
that
a
slightly
blurry
view
sorry
from
underneath
the
gear
looks
like
it
might
be
capable
of
retracting
internally
but
alas
no
this
is
a
shame
as
theres
certainly
enough
room
in
there
and
its
a
wasted
opportunity
imo
might
have
to
modify
that
a
view
of
one
of
the
four
engines
i
personally
think
they
look
too
small
and
should
have
something
under
the
wing
as
well
to
make
them
rounder
cockpit
crew
door
open
i
love
the
smooth
action
of
these
doors
and
the
way
they
seal
flush
against
the
fuselage
when
closed
cargo
door
open
crew
door
with
docked
ladder
cargo
door
with
docked
loading
platform
cargo
slots
inside
and
locks
into

the
same
way
it
sits
on
the

neat
the
minifigs
sorry
this
one
is
a
bit
blurry

that
concludes
this

thanks
drs
for
this
great
review
this
is
your
what
second
one
anyway
this
aint
half
bad
i
actually
kind
of
like
the
bigger
planes
despite
the
annoying
big
pieces
and
this
one
looks
to
be
the
best
yet

i
do
admit
the

of

is
rediculously

it
still
looks
good

how
much
can
the

hold

thats
all
the

you
get

it
might
be
possible
to
rip
out
that
rear
bulkhead
at
the
back
of
the
wing
and
fill
the
middle
area
with
tiles
so
cargo
pallets
could
slide
up
the

that
would
definitely
prevent

folding

y
this
looks
like
the
best
of
the

to
me
very
nice
and
smoother
than
the
rest
although
like
youve
said
what
the
heckre
they
transporting
diamonds
and
pearls
so
much
wasted
space
and
the
landing
gear
should
really
fold
in
n
neutral
i
loved
the
pics
in
the
catalogues
but
was
a
bit
disappointed
by
the
build
and
end
result
my
own
thoughts
cons
as
noted
the
cargo
space
is
really
small
considering
the
size
of
the
plane
although
i
can
see
this
is
restricted
due
to
playability
without
the
barrier
in
the
middle
the
cargo
would
slide
all
over
the
place
while
the
plane
was
being
swooshed
the
cargo
lift
im
not
sure
how
else
to
describe
it
is
very
weak
and
snaps
off
although
it
is
a
clever
design
i
think
its
badly
implemented
there
is
nothing
to
hold
the
cargo
pallet
to
the
cargo
lift
truck
so
it
tends
to
slide
off
all
over
the
place
as
soon
as
the
truck
moves
colour
issues
i
had
at
least
3
shades
of
green
with
the
larger
plane
pieces
and
noticeable
variances
even
with
identical
cargo
hatch
pieces
at
least
one
of
them
also
came
quite
scratched
which
was
a
little
disappointing
at
7995
aud
its
10
more
than
the
passenger
plane
was
with
less
pieces
and
figs
and
no
printed
pieces
whatsoever
more
for
less
methinks
pros
lots
of
nice
cargo
crate
pieces
and
even
the
stickers
for
these
are
pretty
good
landing
gear
piece
adjusts
very
well
to
height
differentials
so
the
plane
doesnt
lose
its
gear
as
often
as
the
earlier
passenger
planes
the
hinging
mechanism
works
very
well
to
open
the
cargo
holds
opens
very
smoothly
and
is
not
noticeable
id
definitely
like
to
see
more
of
this
technique
the
little
vehicles
work
well
chained
together
and
are
all
good
small
designs
overall
i
really
like
the
large
planes
since
06
but
i
dont
think
theyve
still
quite
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
whereas
the
earlier
planes
were
a
little
flimsy
this
one
is
sturdier
but
has
its
own
issues
the
look
of
the
cargo
plane
is
nice
and
the
new
landing
piece
and
cargo
hatch
pieces
are
really
great
but
some
design
weaknesses
and
colour
issues
detract
from
the
overall
product
its
a
shame
as
with
a
bit
of
tweaking
this
could
have
been
a
musthave
set
negative
wow
thats
a
great
review
of
a
great
set
dr
s
y
as
you
yourself
have
already
noted
this
has
the
potential
to
be
a
fantastic
military
moc
with
a
bit
of
modification
you
can
get
the
engines
to
be
rounder
or
perhaps
do
away
with
them
completely
and
replace
them
with
jet
engines
sweet
though
i
cant
think
of
a
system
to
retract
the
undercarriage
at
the
top
of
my
head
it
seems
like
theres
indeeed
more
than
enough
potential
to
do
so
it
reminds
me
rather
of
an
ilyushin
il76
one
of
my
favourite
cargo
planes

speak

i
like
it
worth

its
a

full

i

its

there
arent

a

a

in

neutral
nice
review
dr
s
i
have
been
thinking
long
and
hard
about
the
scale
of
the
planes
in
my
town
i
would
like
to
keep
my
passenger
planes
in
their
classic
4wide
fuselage
style
but
i
really
dont
mind
the
new
plane
hull
pieces
if
they
are
used
as
an
enormous
transport
plane
like
the
ilyushin76
unfortunately
i
cant
afford
this
lovely
new
green
one
at
the
moment
which
would
be
perfect
to
go
with
my
green
army
as
i
took
too
much
of
a
hit
buying
the
new
2008
star
wars
sets
but
i
have
modified
my
white
one
to
take
huge
cargo
loads
in
fact
my
apc
is
designed
specifically
to
fit
inside
unfortunately
im
a
bit
busy
to
take
pics
at
the
moment
but
hope
to
put
some
up
soon
neutral
if
i
do
end
up
geting
this
set
it
will
be
for
my
slowly
growing
army
btw
nice
review
y
neutral
thank
for
the
review

the
only
thing
i
like
in
this
set
is
the
small
car
so
i
will
not
buy
this
set
just
for
it
i
really
dislike
those
new
planes
toooo
bbiiiigggg
with
this
size
this
cargo
plane
can
carry
just
fiew
things
what
a
shame
i
think
that
the
way
tlc
has
made
the
wings
is
not
very
good
like
the
rest
of
those
big
pieces
just
my
thought
the

of
this
its
that
it
makes
me
saved
some
money

love
the

including
indy
in

corner
the

of
the

is
just

there
staring

is
defiantly
doing

a

complaint
from
me
ok
now
here
we
have
the
real

here
is

the

behind
the
wall
a
skellie

out
there
is
a
lever
in
the
back
of
the

you

down

the
snakes

both

in

indy
uses
his
whip
to
scale
the
wall
and
avoid
all
the
snakes
which
he
is
afriad
of
in
the
meantime
leaving
marion
behind
to
fight
them
off
p
the

is

it

i
did
not

any

well
except
on
one
of
my
dark
blue
round

it
was
a
bit
damaged

it
still
worked
fine

thanks
for
the
review
stealth
hunter
y
that
truck
looks
better
than
i
expected
and
its
for
sure
a
pretty
playable

nice
but
still
too
much
police
mayhem
to
me
i
think
the
new

satisfy
all
my
safety
needs
neutral
thanks
for
the
review
that
truck
is
actually
better
than
i
first
thought
i
am
still
tossing
up
getting
it
as
i
am
getting
the
police
station
and
where
would
it
park
p
i
quite
like
the
little
building
though
but
still
i
am
so
confused
wacko
neutral
i
like
the
new
station
but
the
truck
is
a
good
question
i
still
like
the
classic
1994
one

the
1980s
can
that
was
one
of
the
first
units
i
got
neutral
hello
and
welcome
to
another
oh
wait
first
batbrick
and
iamded
review
today
us
two
sworn
enemies
will
be
reviewing
the
creator
cargo
chopper
here
is
the
front
of
the
box
and
while
pushing
iamded
to
his
doom
here
is
the
back
haha
ouch
oh
dearhere
are
the
parts
anyway
here
is
the
instruction
of
the
first
model
the
cargo
chopper
i
love
creator
sets
for
the
different
models
they
always
excite
me
just
ignore
me
finishing
off
my
nemesis
in
the
background
something
very
interesting
that
i
liked
in
the
instructions
was
this
step
where
you
must
add
those
three
2x2
yellow
rounded
pieces
under
the
chopper
this
is
for
support
while
you
build
which
is
handy
and
later
you
take
it
off
and
even
later
use
it
as
the
cargo
i
found
that
to
be
rather
innovative
and
clever
as
well
as
hey
what
are
you
hitting
me
for
both
instruction
booklets
have
the
same
back
now
heres
the
chopper
itself
i
love
the
design
of
it
it
isnt
quite
minifig
scale
but
its
great
all
the
same
this
is
my
first
nonxpod
or
house
creator
set
and
it
sure
is
fun
here
me
and
iamded
go
for
a
dizzy
ride
i
love
the
nose
of
the
copter
and
the
landing
gear
is
fantastic
a
shot
from
the
other
side
oh
dear
it
seems
weve
been
a
bit
sick
from
that
ride
and
were
vomiting
transgreen
1x1s
the
cargo
itself
is
nicely
made
though
i
forgot
to
put
on
two
tiles
here
it
fits
in
real
well
with
the
chopper
to
and
the
line
is
great
for
giving
iamded
the
wedgie
he
deserves
this
is
my
first
power
function
set
so
i
was
pretty
excited
the
motor
is
intergrated
really
well
into
this
set
and
is
activated
by
pushing
that
little
3x2
plate
with
the
1x1
slopes
on
it
forward
until
it
hits
the
motor
button
that
orange
knob
another
point
of
interest
is
the
use
of
bley
barrels
on
each
side
i
like
this
as
i
dont
have
those
pieces
in
that
colour
a
shot
of
the
motor
its
really
simple
all
you
do
is
pull
the
hook
out
to
any
length
that
allows
then
press
the
orange
button
and
it
will
wind
it
back
up
this
makes
the
chopper
pull
the
cargo
up
into
its
bay
and
iamded
pull
me
here
reluctantly
to
a
whacking
a
top
view
is
that
my
head
a
view
of
the
chopper
without
the
cargo
in
it
i
love
the
lowered
cockpit
the
leftover
pieces
from
building
note
iamdeds
head
does
not
count
as
set
piece
and
a
final
shot
of
the
set
with
me
and
iamded
oh
it
appear
were
dead
oh
dear
hope
you
enjoyed
this
review
soon
i
will
post
the
two
alternate
models
i
loved
this
chopper
its
great
to
play
with
and
has
nice
construction
it
also
has
some
handy
pieces
too
the
motor
function
sounds
like
a
gimmick
but
is
well
intergrated
into
this
model
well
worth
the
price
so
far
this
is
another
win
for
creator
i
say
so
far
i
recommend
this
model
but
later
well
see
if
the
alt
models
are
up
to
scratch
also
since
this
is
my
first
review
comments
and
criticism
welcome

i
wish
i
could

get
those

the

of

doesnt

for
the

negative
thanks
everyone
heres
part
2
the
second
instruction
booklet
includes
instructions
for
both
alternate
models
which
is
good
i
hate
having
too
many
manuals
here
she
is
the
plane
its
very
nice
and
well
proportioned
but
where
did
iamded
get
that
laser
overview
the
landing
gear
is
very
sturdy
and
nice
and
the
wings
are
surprisingly
good
top
view
iamdeds
head
fell
into
the
propellers
i
was
trying
to
save
him
honest
a
view
of
how
the
motor
on
this
one
works
by
pushing
the
orange
button
you
can
make
the
prop
spin
it
is
well
integrated
like
the
chopper
though
the
prop
only
spins
for
about
2
12
seconds
still
its
a
nice
feature
the
tail
is
also
well
made
simple
but
lovable
oh
and
check
out
that
tank
the
prop
spinning
agh
is
that
my
hand
final
view
there
seems
to
be
some
sort
of
explosion
here
8
well
i
think
i
got
iamded
more
than
me
atleast
the
second
model
is
also
great
though
not
as
good
as
the
chopper
the
lack
of
space
to
fit
something
into
the
cockpit
brings
it
down
a
bit
but
it
is
a
very
nice
model
overall
i
recommend
it
though
unlike
the
chopper
it
will
be
hard
to
mod
into
minifig
scale
so
far
so
good
with
4995
here
are
the
leftover
pieces
from
the
model

smugglers
shanty
overview
smugglers
shanty
was
released
in
1992
it
consisted
of
69
pieces
3
minifigs
two
pirates
one
imperial
and
it
cost
925
usd
the
set
itself
is
a
small
but
rather
sturdy
den
for
the
pirates
review
the
minifigs
consist
of
two
pirates
and
one
imperial
the
minifigs
are
not
all
that
rare
which
is
disappointing
i
would
of
liked
a
rarer
fig
but
still
it
is
a
good
cheap
source
of
pirate
and
imperial
figures
here
is
an
overall
shot
of
the
set
which
includes
the
three
figs
the
shanty
which
is
made
using
palm
leaves
pieces
and
a
nice
grey
shark
nibbling
at
the
soldiers
oar
a
close
up
of
the
soldier
rowing
hard
in
his
boat
i
would
have
preferred
to
have
a
normal
soldier
with
shako
hat
as
i
have
more
officers
than
normal
soldiers
now
and
a
close
up
snap
of
the
main
structure
note
the
wine
glass
which
was
a
nice
touch
funnily
enough
only
4
pieces
of
treasure
were
included
in
this
set
compared
to
the
usual
8
gold
coins
in
other
sets
a
view
from
the
back
which
also
gives
a
good
view
of
the
pieces
used
to
construct
the
shanty
mainly
simple
black
1
by
1
bricks
the
shanty
looks
good
from
most
angles
but
their
are
a
few
where
the
roof
construction
looks
rather
odd
but
that
is
just
a
minor
nitpick
yet
another
view
from
the
front
this
time
at
a
slightly
different
angle
the
yellow
base
plate
looks
rather
nice
too
i
prefer
it
over
the
tan
pieces
we
trend
to
get
nowadays
attack
the
stupid
drunk
pirate
in
the
background
does
not
even
notice
overall
i
think
this
is
a
rather
good
set
despite
some
shortcomings
such
as
the
lack
of
treasure
and
odd
roof
from
some
angles
the
shark
imperial
soldier
and
useful
parts
make
up
for
it
and
of
course
the
price
is
cheap
on
most
auction
sites
i
got
mine
for
a
mere
5
10
with
the
cheapest
price
on
bricklink
being
8
rate
the
set
then
leave
your
comments
thoughts
and
opinions
positive
first
ill
comment
on
the
review
and
at
a
later
date
ill
comment
on
the
set
youve
done
a
top
job
lord
of

y
youve
captured
the
set
from
a
variety
of
angles
and
posed
the
minifigures
interestingly

i
remember
this
set
from
when
i
was
a
kid
i
got
it
for
my
birthday
and
opened
the
package
first
sadly
i
had
to
go
to
school
so
i
had
to
leave
it
at
home
and
not
build
it
or
play
with
it
until
i
got
home
needless
to
say
that
was
one
of
the
longest
days
of
school
ever
good

i
bought
one
of
these
new
from
bricklink
a
few
months
ago
as
part
of
my
pirate
splurge
i
went
on
i
really
enjoyed
this
set
because
of
the
amount
of
figs
in
such
a
small
set
though
pirates
were
always
pretty
good
about
their
fig
count
also
the
neat
little
hut
is
nicely
done
for
its
purpose
great

i
dont
mind
an
occassional
old
review
coming
back
to
life
for
discussion
but
it
seems
youve
replied
to
many
old
reviews
that
have
been
stagnant
for
years
please
try
to
refrain
from
bumping
a
lot
of
old
topics
as
it
pushes
down
new
content
that
should
really
be
the
focus
of
discussion
now
neutral
well
since
this
topic
has
resurfaced
i
would
add
my
2
cents
about
my
appreciation
of
this
set
it
was
the
first
and
unfortunately
the
largest
pirate
set
i
owned
as
a
kid
but
i
played
the
wazoo
out
of
it
some
of
the
minifigs
have
lost
almost
all
their
face
printing
after
so
many
play
sessions
theres
just
something
about
the
hut
that
appealed
to
me
more
than
the
cheesy
skullface
islands
we
keep
gettingprobably
that
it
wa
kind
of
neutral
good
for
my
pirates
settlers
or
islanders
though
the
palm
leaves
were
rather
fragile
and
used
to
break
off
the
studded
parts
it
would
be
nice
to
get
more

i
never
expected
you
to
do
a
review
for
some
reason
i
love
these
mini
sets
the
train
in
particular
is
great
i
wont
get
any
though
those
indy
sets
are
coming
in
fast
and
im
gon
na
need
all
the
money
i
can
muster
still
they
are
nifty
little
sets
batbrick
away
positive
mmmmh
i
wub
love
the
train
great
review
it
looks
like
each
model
can
be
connected
to
the
other
to
make
a
complete
train
y
y
it
makes
me
want
to
get
3
of
them
or
more
to
make
a
long
one
d
neutral
so
here
it
is
finally
my
first
ever
review
of
a
lego
setoh
wait
its
actually
2
sets
so
i
dont
really
know
how
to
do
it
right
but
ill
try
the
best
sorry
if
some
pictures
are
a
litte
bit
dark
but
im
not
really
into
photography
and
i
got
bad
light
here
lets
start
with

first
as
always
the
box
the
back
a
few
instructions
on
how
the
defender
works
for
those
how
dont
know
and
the
instructions
we
continue
with
the
minifigs
sorry
i
forgot
to
make
a
closeup
of
the
dwarf
and
finally
the
mine
defender
itself
i
personally
think
it
isnt
as
bad
as
maybe
some
people
think
the
chain
for
the
catapult
is
great
i
think
i
kinda
love
those
controls
the
mechanism
with
the
rubbe
rband
actually
works
pretty
well
but
only
on
a
notglossy
underground
thats
pretty
much
all
of
it
its
small
but
i
like
it
a
lot
so
lets
go
on
to
the
tower
raid
now
which
would
be
my
absolute
favorite
of
those
new
sets

again
first
the
box
instructions
we
got
2
sets
of
instructios
here
one
for
the
tower
and
one
for
the
siege
tower
the
minifigs
we
got
one
archer
and
one
soldier
here
both
with
the
torsos
of
the
2007
sets
now
thw
orc
side
starting
with
the
great
leader
with
the
new
armor
and
the
golden
helmet
i
love
those
pieces
closeup
of
the
armor
helmet
then
we
got
another
orcknight
and
the
prisoner
with
handcuffs
the
crownie
tower
looks
great
overall
though
there
is
something
i
dont
really
like
about
it
but
later
on
that
now
the
back
and
that
is
what
really
bothers
me
there
areno
walls
on
the
first
floor
except
the
one
with
the
wallpiece
and
the
door
and
theprison
also
is
open
at
the
back
the
orc
easily
could
jump
out
there
not
sure
what
these
are
all
about
they
really
dont
add
much
to
the
set
enough
rant
now
lets
go
on
with
a
pretty
sweet
detail
the
golden
crystal
on
the
little
table
the
wall
piece
on
the
first
floor
you
can
ram
in
and
finally
the
very
best
thing
of
this
set
the
amazing
orc
siege
tower
from
the
front
the
great
working
ram
you
can
pull
it
back
very
far
and
it
got
pretty
much
power
here
we
got
another
sweet
detail
the
siege
platform
that
moves
out
by
pulling
a
cord
in
the
back
of
the
tower
finally
a
picture
of
a
bit
siege
action
if
you
ram
in
the
lower
wallpiece
the
brown
shelfs
of
the
prisonfloor
collapse
and
the
prisoned
orc
is
finally
free
summary
likes
as
i
mentioned
before
i
really
think
thats
the
best
ever
produced
siege
tower
its
got
so
mich
details
and
works
extremely
well
also
the
overall
look
of
it
is
magnificant
the
destroymechanism
of
the
tower
is
pretty
cool
too
the
brown
door
is
a
fine
detail
too
nothing
much
to
say
about
the
mine
defender
i
like
this
little
set
and
theres
nothing
really
to
bother
about
it
dislikes
the
back
of
the
tower
thats
really
the
only
thing
thats
a
bit
bad
imo
they
could
have
put
there
2
more
walls
on
the
first
floor
and
something
to
lock
the
prison
easily
final
thought
the
tower
raid
for
me
personally
is
the
best
of
the
2008
sets
so
far
its
got
great
playability
and
looks
simply
good
my
opinion
buy
it
positive
tks
for
these
cool
reviews
metalandi
i
love
these
orc
sets
i
am
so
going
to
get
these
im
happy
to
see
that
scared
face
again
i
love
it
really
and
the
use
of
that
handculfs
that
new
armour
looks
really
cool
that
tower
is
really
nice
and
i
wont
mod
it
that
much
which
os
cool
and
the
battle
ram
is
freaking
sweet
tks
again
for
sharing
yoda
positive
great
review
pictures
and
all
thanks
for
showing
all
the
mechanisms
of
the
tower
i
didnt
notice
them
from
either
the
pics
we
had
or
the
instructionsit
didnt
hit
me
that
when
you
knock
down
the
wall
the
second
floor
breaks
that
is
a
genius
idea
this
looks
like
a
superb
set
unfortunately
my
priority
right
now
is
the
troll
warship
still
if
that
really
is
us
80
i
might
skip
it
and
go
for
this
instead
which
is
only
20
us
one
note
though
i
think
there
might
not
be
a
back
cage
on
the
second
floor
of
the
tower
so
that
the
mechanism
can
work
did
you
try
to
see
if
the
second
floor
ground
still
falls
if
you
add
it
a
fourth
cage
wall
also
you
could
just
pretend
that
the
tower
is
built
against
a
mountainside
it
would
fit
perfectly
and
add
more
defense
to
the
knights
great
review
vk

this
set

to
picking
up
these
sets
steve
neutral
thanks

the
double

that
siege
tower
and
love
that
new
armour

the
review
positive
thanks
metalandi
these
are
2
great
sets
im
definately
looking
forward
to
seeing
these
in
new
zealand
stores
the
collapsing
floorprisoner
freeing
mechanism
on
the
tower
is
wonderful
a
great
touch
some
slight
modifications
like
some
walls
will
make
this
perfect
and
the
dwarfs
mine
defender
is
a
sweet
little
set
with
some
neat
minifigs
thanks
for
the
reviews
y
peace
positive
thanks
for
these
great
reviews
sweet
the
dwarfs
mine
defender
looks
interesting
the
figs
though
are
wub
the
only
thing
missing
is
a
weapon
for
the
dwarf
and
some
shields
the
battering
ram
and
tower
are
awesome
8
the
troll
king
with
new
torso
helmet
and
body
armor
is
simply
amazing
i
like
how
the
troll
is
handcuffed
d
the
tower
shows
nice
detail
except
for
the
poor
brig
i
love
that
gold
crystal
the
battering
ram
is
a
thing
of
beauty
30
for
the
tower
and
ram
and
10
for
the
defender
are
very
well
priced
i
still
want
the
battle
wheel
more
though
damn
exclusives
p
positive
thanks
for
the
review
i
personally
think
the
siege
tower
is
probably
the
best
one
which
lego
has
ever
produced
positive
well
i
dont
think
orcs
are
that
sturdy
seeing
that
theyd
have
to
jump
from
the
second
level
of
the
tower
i
dont
see
survival
as
his
chief
objective
p
awesome
review
im
loving
these
sets
more
and
more
the
tower
raid
is
definitely
the
best
and
the
cheapest
set
there
oh
and
pirhana
its
not
really
a
king
its
more
like
an
officer
remember
the
wizard
rules
these
goblins

yeah
the
open

are
kinda
funny

they
were
also
typical
of
for

90s

the

almost
exactly
one
year
after
caf

was
released
we
get
the
third
installment
in
the
increasingly
popular
lego
exclusive
town
series
combined
with
the
famous
10182
caf

and
its
trusty

this
trio
makes
the
foundation
for
an
amazing
city
block
of
lego
goodness
for
those
new
to
this
series
of
sets
check
out
my
reviews
of
the
two
previous
sets
in
this
line
cafe
corner
market
street
i
would
not
necessarily
recommend
reading
too
many
of
my
reviews
in
one
setting
as
you
might
experience
loss
of
brain
cells
andor
drowsiness
you
have
been
warned
so
how
does
green
grocer
stack
up
to
the
two
previous
sets
you
ask
well
follow
along
kind
reader
and
i
shall
attempt
to
unravel
this
question
the
box
the
gigantic
box
is
pretty
standard
and
looks
amazingly
similar
to
the
caf
corner
box
the
back
of
the
box
shows
some
of
the
features
of
the
green
grocer
as
well
as
a
lot
of
the
cool
interior
that
was
absent
from
the
previous
sets
in
addition
we
are
shown
an
image
of
the
three
sets
together
and
a
small
insert
image
showing
how
they
connect
together
as
if
we
could
not
master
that
difficult
maneuver
opening
the
box
is
a
matter
of
breaking
two
seals
as
it
seems
to
be
the
norm
now
we
have
the
reusable
cereal
box
type
tab
system
that
we
saw
so
often
in
2007
sets
however
upon
opening
the
tabs
we
are
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
a
cardboard
tray
have
not
seen
one
of
those
in
a
while
as
you
can
see
in
the
photo
we
have
two
32x16
green
base
plates
three
instruction
manuals
and
a
bunch
of
bags
that
are
broken
into
four
groups
group
1
has
12
bags
and
goes
with
the
first
manual
and
builds
the
first
floor
group
2
has
9
bags
and
goes
with
the
second
manual
to
build
the
second
floor
group
3
has
14
bags
and
goes
with
the
third
manual
for
the
top
floor
and
roof
and
one
bag
that
is
not
numbered
and
hence
you
can
open
it
whenever
you
feel
like
it
there
are
no
stickers
yay
moving
right
along
we
get
to
the
three
instruction
manuals
the
manuals
the
three
manuals
are
55
47
and
47
pages
in
length
they
are
laid
out
well
and
are
pretty
standard
with
all
the
usual
trimmings
piece
call
outs
for
each
step
parts
inventory
at
the
end
of
the
second
manual
page
numbers
color
separation
in
these
manuals
was
fine
for
me
except
dark
bley
and
black
we
get
a
nice
photo
of
all
three
sets
together
plus
we
get
a
nice
tip
showing
how
to
split
up
the
bags
and
what
goes
where
those
additional
pieces
you
see
in
the
photo
just
below
the
numbered
bags
are
the
pieces
that
come
from
the
single
unnumbered
bag
along
with
the
base
plates
parts
list
random
manual
shot
the
pieces
upon
opening
the
first
set
of
bags
one
thing
is
clear
there
are
a
ton
of
little
tiny
pieces
the
minifigs
are
included
in
this
first
section
as
well
interesting
to
note
that
there
are
a
handful
of
printed
pieces
and
as
i
mentioned
previously
no
stickers
we
also
get
a
host
of
new
and
exciting
pieces
to
add
to
our
collection
keep
in
mind
my
scope
of
lego
sets
is
generally
centered
around
star
wars
technic
creator
and
the
occasional
racer
set
so
what
is
new
to
me
might
have
been
around
15
years
at
any
rate
here
are
some
of
the
more
interesting
pieces
again
note
the
printed
tiles
this
time
around
lego
has
decided
to
include
33
more
minifigs
than
the
caf
corner
and
market
street
sets
yes
we
get
four
minifigs
instead
of
three
here
are
the
cast
of
characters
pictured
left
to
right
is
sir
top
hat
miss
jenny
blue
overalls
patti
o
furniture
and
little
timmy
cub
scout
ill
leave
it
up
to
the
minifig
aficionados
to
decipher
which
torsos
are
new
and
to
tell
us
all
about
the
hairpieces
i
can
say
with
reasonable
certainty
that
the
four
yellow
smiley
heads
are
not
new
somebody
check
that
dont
forget
the
lovable
little
cat
named
tom
he
is
the
archrival
of
the
mouse
jerry
that
lives
downstairs
overall
there
are
a
lot
of
pieces
large
variety
and
wide
range
of
colors
the
build
if
you
have
either
of
the
two
previous
sets
you
will
feel
right
at
home
here
just
like
in
the
previous
builds
it
seems
like
the
first
ten
build
steps
are
consumed
with
laying
a
bunch
of
1x1
1x2
and
2x2
tiles
everywhere
almost
feels
like
30
of
the
pieces
are
used
up
right
away
see
below
there
are
several
sections
where
you
build
various
parts
of
the
interior
take
a
look
at
the
cash
registercounter
below
and
the
beverage
cooler
and
the
produce
stand
and
everything
that
goes
in
it
looks
like
someone
has
mail
looks
like
someone
just
had
a
baby
this
set
is
incredibly
well
done
and
gives
inspiration
to
go
back
and
add
similar
items
to
caf
corner
and
market
street
as
before
the
average
builder
is
introduced
to
some
new
building
techniques
like
using
the
hinge
plates
to
make
the
angles
on
the
front
of
the
building
as
shown
below
also
the
top
of
the
roof
shows
some
interesting
ideas
overall
it
is
a
really
fun
build
that
kept
me
entertained
the
whole
way
the
design
this
is
a
great
set
with
lots
of
little
details
i
especially
like
the
little
mouse
hole
in
the
wall
leading
to
the
jerry
the
mouses
area
they
even
included
a
little
slice
of
cheese
it
seems
the
designers
cant
get
away
from
the
usual
staircase
which
i
always
feel
is
way
too
big
maybe
future
designs
can
incorporate
a
spiral
staircase
to
save
room
for
other
things
in
the
model
one
welcome
addition
is
the
fire
escape
as
seen
below
im
going
to
show
a
bunch
of
examples
of
various
items
in
the
set
so
you
can
get
the
feel
of
the
amazing
detail
in
this
design
take
a
look
at
the
lamps
torches
just
outside
the
door
and
the
streetlight
with
fire
hydrant
brickwork
and
archway
awning
here
is
the
back
side
of
the
building
note
the
trashcans
and
yard
tools
here
is
a
closeup
of
the
railings
on
the
second
story
balcony
and
the
second
photo
is
the
finished
product
with
curtains
in
the
window
nice
use
of
cups
to
make
the
banister
on
the
second
floor
here
is
the
fireplace
on
the
second
floor
second
floor
staircase
with
toms
hiding
spot
check
out
the
radiator
on
the
third
floor
more
third

nice
grandfather
clock
and
rug
third
floor
check
out
the
deck
that
is
up
on
the
roof
complete
with
two
chairs
table
umbrella
flower
pots
and
grill
interesting
use
of
minifig
hammers
on
the
roof
finally
here
is
what
is
left
over
when
were
done
a
couple
of
shots
of
the
front
a
shot
of
the
back
and
here
are
all
three
together
overall
thoughts
this
is
an
incredible
set
and
the
best
of
the
three
in
my
opinion
it
is
hard
to
top
caf
corner
but
i
believe
green
grocer
just
did
i
absolutely
love
all
the
details
and
building
techniques
that
went
into
making
this
set
there
is
a
ton
of
different
parts
and
wide
color
selection
as
usual
we
get
a
bunch
of
tiles
and
small
plates
but
that
goes
with
the
series
also
we
get
four
minifigs
and
lots
of
minifig
accessories
im
giving
this
set
a
score
of
100
i
thought
about
it
and
i
really
dont
know
how
they
could
have
made
it
any
better
in
short
run
dont
walk
to
go
pick
this
set

tks

the
time

such
a
fantastic

the
overall
look
of
the
building
is
brilliant
and
i
love
the
nice
additions
they
did
the
cheese
and
mouse
jerry
d
is
hilarious
i
didnt
know
green
grocer
had
a
rodent
infestation
and
the
use
of
the
new
built
furniture
and
detils
like
the
radiator
is
freaking
awsome
also
that
set
has
a
definite
plus
for
me
its
the
back
details
i
love
the
stairs
the
deck

very
nice
very
nice
indeed
lots
of
lovely
little

even
at
the
back
this
review
hasnt
changed
my
opinion
one
bit
im
still
looking
forward
to
when
i
can
finally
pick
up
mine
at
the
post
office
im
crossing
my
fingers
that
there
will
be
more
buildings
following
after
this
one
im
guessing
that
legos
just
testing
the
waters
to
see
how
far
afols
are
willing
to
go
regarding
price
vs
details
green
grocer
is
still
epic
though
positive
for
some
silly
and
quite
delusional
reason
i
thought
that
i
had
a
chance
to
review
this
first
d
but
yours
is
at
your
house
and
mine
is
hopefully
winging
its
way
to
me
thanks
for
the
review
it
will
help
me
survive
until
mine
arrives
i
love
this
set
wub
hopefully
there
will
be
many
more
stunning
sets
like
this

come

dont

lego
the
100

positive
man
these
sets
are
so
awesome
incredible
work
done
by
the
designers
there
must
have
took
a
long
time
to
get
all
this

if
they
werent
too
expensive
i
would
go
and
buy
them
all
3
right
away
wub
positive
truly
an
awesome
review
thanks
dunamis
i
ordered
my
two
copies
one
to
build
one
to
store
in
the
vault
last
week
cant
wait
to
get
this
one
the
attention
to
detail
here
is
what
makes
the
set
great
theres
nothing
to
criticize
about
this
set
its
really
the
closest
thing
to
perfection
that
i
have
seen
from
tlc
the
difference
between
this
set
and
cc
is
the
interior
detail
and
because
of
that
gg
now
become
in
my
opinion
the
best
set
ever
released
by
tlc
do
the
ccggms
sets
fit
well
with
the
50th
anniv
town
plan
my
impression
is
that
out
of
the
box
at
least
they
dont
which
is
too
bad
however
i
dont
think
it
would
be
hard
to
mod
the
town
plan
so
it
looks
like
it
belongs
in
the
same
town
as
ccggms
these
sets
to
me
are
what
i
have
always
wanted
from
tlc
as
an
adult
i
hope
they
keep
up
the
line
and
add
more
elements
to
this
excellent
lineup
positive
wow
thanks
for
the
nice
review
i
have
the
other
2
sets
and
waiting
for
this
to
come
to
our
shores
stupendous

really
like

a
wonderful
set
a
masterpiece

far
beyond
everything
i
wouldve
expected
just
one
year
ago
the
amount
of
details
is
exceptional
from
the
different
railings
to
the
mousehole
and
the
radiator
sheer
brilliant
and
two
female
mfs
or
hippies
you
never
know
and
a
child
only
one
adult
male
character
who
nearly
looks
like
well

penny
leaving
my
pocket
what
do
you
guys
think
is
tlc
putting
up
as
the
next
modular

is
it
asking
too

of
tlc
to
produce
1
modular

4
times
a

said
that
threaded
axle
never
stopped
intriguing
me
it
was
use
in
so
few
sets
i
believe
8851
contained
one
as
well
and
i
still
dont
know
why
its
better
than
any
other
axle
the
purpose
of
the
threaded
axle
is
to
carry
tension
regular
axles
are
used
primarily
for
carrying
torsion
for
gears
sometimes
for
compression
8855
landing
gear
helicopter
skids
and
sometimes
just
for
looks
roll
cages
canopies
but
used
in
tension
connectors
will
usually
just
pop
off
with
the
threads
and
the
corresponding
nuts
this
part
can
be
used
to
squeeze
parts
together
like
the
pen
in
the
plotter
of
8094
or
to
hold
heavy
assemblies
onto
turntables
like
8862
and
8851
with
the
power
crane
8854
reviewed
here
that
is
the
complete
list
of
sets
which
used
this
part
i
wrote
about
it

eric
neutral
as
i
bought
it
i
didnt
even
know
i
would
also
get
a
box
it
just
said
all
parts
with
building
instructions
after
opening
the
parcel
i
was
like
woah
woooaaahhh
and
so
on
i
love
legoboxes
because
as
a
child
i
stood
in
the
toy
stores
starring
at
the
boxes
only
seeing
the
front
and
the
back
nothing
more
this
brings
back
some
memories
positive
thank
you
very
much
for
that
review
positive
i
bought
it
some
years
ago
for
the
bmodel
and
like
it
so
much
d
positive
this
was
my
first
pneumatic
set

this
was
my
first
technic
set
aged
7
still
a
great
one
in
terms
of
function
density
and
a
great
bmodel
in
the
uk
im
certain
it
was
called
the
salvage
hoist
positive
thanks
for
reviewing
all
these
old
sets
will
you
be
doing
any
more
positive
this
set
is
really
cool
i
might
actually
get
it
positive
ah
a
good
old
retro
review
those
old
school
days
had
some
pretty
impressive
sets
with
alot
more
complexity
than
modern
sets
if
you
have
it
may
i
recommend
8880
positive
thanks
for
reviewing
this
classic
set
i
got
it
when
it
first
came
out
and
still
love
it
the
suspension
steering
and
robust
look
of
the
model
havent
been
done
that
well
ever
since
this
set
puzzled
me
though
back
in
the
days
the
rear
suspending
part
containing
the
differential
and
some
gears
was
shown
different
on
the
box
from
the
instructions
in
the
instructions
it
showed
that
the
grey
part
of
the
suspension
in
the
back
had
to
be
made
using
a
1x2
smooth
tile
and
4
cornerplates
2x2
in
grey
the
box
however
showed
a
much
sturdier
solution
using
a
1x8
tile
and
a
1x8
plate
it
is
also
visible
on
the
cover
of
the
instructions
the
pieces
i
mean
are
in
this

youve

to
go
on
a

a
few
things
ive
discovered
left
side
alternate
model
the
steering
link
can
only
be
put
in
place
with
a
little
violence
the
handlebar
is
turned
far
more
than
its
actually
possible
although
the
wheels
are
straight
right
side
the
1x8
tile
simonwillems
pointed
out
the
half
bush
right
next
to
it
is
cantfindthewords
wrong
could
be
that
the
technic
triangle
is
missing
the
windscreen
1x6
technic
plates
are
mounted
with
12

instead
of

pins
with

nope
the

are
thinner

somewhat
more
modern
i
do
believe
theyre
the
same
like
in
8274
aaaaaaaand
for
a
long
time
in
my

these
wheels
have
been
the
best
and
coolest
looking
ive
ever
had
so
wheres
your

recycled
xd
positive
ive
seen
a
few
cases
like
this
where
the
box
pictures
are
slightly
different
from
the
actual
model
the
airtech
claw
rig
compressor
is
another
one
that
comes
to
mind
the
changes
sometimes
seem
pointless
and
make
you
wonder
why
they
bothered
p
quote
the
only
original
stickers
are
the
front
headlightpatterns
on
the
2
red
1x2
bricks
the
others
have
been
destroyed
must
have
been
the
bad
decaying
sticker
quality
that
breaks
when
youll
remove
it
so
i
printed
them
i
didnt
print
the
flag
for
only
the
alternate
model
needs
it
although
its
a
neat
idea
the
other
stickers
on
mine
have
held
up
pretty
well
although
i
didnt
try
to
remove
them
after
i
put
them
on
the
flag
started
to
break
after
a
year
or
so
and
just
fell
off
its
axle
at
one
point
i
taped
over
it
and
its
holding
up
well
now
although
its
a
little
frayed
along
one
edge
this
is
actually
the
earliest
set
ive
seen
that
uses
this
crappy
sticker
material
which
is
unfortunately
very
common
today
even
other
technic
sets
had
good
stickers
for
many
years
after
that

but
when
things
are
like
this
and
you
try
and
wind
up
the
cable
the
winch
is
strong
enough
to
break
the
original
provided
lego
rope
it
worked
with
my
copy
d
so
this
set
is
capable
of
demolishing
itself
but
still
one
of
the
best
technicsets
i
have
with
all
stickers
intact
im
not
so
sure
about
that
flag
though
must
check
on
that
positive
wow
that
first
picture
is
great
you
must
have
a
very
wide
angle
lens
with
the
capability
to
focus
very
close
macro
the
perspective
makes
the
model
look
huge
nice
work
i
think
the
suspension
on
this
set
is
my
favorite
of
all
technic
it
has
such
large
travel
and
is
so
what
word
should
i
use
bouncy
hey
why
do
you
only
review
sets
which
are
red

said
at
my
school
leaving
examination
i
made
a
model
in
blender3d
and
explained
to
the
board
of
examiners
how
to
build
a
car
and
how
to
animate
it
it
needed
a
color
so
i
took
red
because
all
beautiful
and
fast
cars
are
red
my
physics
teacher
contradicted
did
you
use
ferrari
to
prove
your
point
any
physics
teacher
would
have
to
admit
that
a
really
fast
car
approaching
the
speed
of
light
will
always
look
red
as
it
drives
away
due
to
red
shift
xd
on
the
other
hand
8880
looks
pretty
fast
and
it
is
black
although
i
have
seen
pictures
of
one
that
someone
built
in
red
yellow
might
be
good
too
some
cars
even
look
fast
in
green
eric
neutral
i
can
remember
that
ive
seen
a
few
color
variations
on
brickshelf
and
on
ebay
they
sold
well
its
new
and
familiar
at
the
same
time
that
makes
it
more
interesting

reread
your
review
today
great
pictures
this
is
a
fabulous
model
got
this
model
a
few
months
ago
for
just
$
25
it
is
small
and
has
great
working
parts
i
love
the
way
the
frontsuspension
is
made
epic
i
only
had
the
lightstickers
replaced
with
transclear
bricks
btw
the
gear
rack
has
been
used

this

i
also
happened
to
receive
this
set
this
weekend
virtually
misb
the
seals
on
the
side
of
the
box
were
loose
however
everything
inside
was
untouched
this
little
beast
a
joy
to
build
and
even
more
so
to
play
with
as
indicated
by
eric
on
the
technicopedia
page
its
crammed
with
functions
for
a
mediumsized
set
i
think
i
love
it
even
more
than
my
son
does

i
read
blackbirds

on
this
truck
the
other
week
went
onto
ebay
and
picked
up
a
misb
copy
for

gbp
bargin
great
to
get
old
sets
unopened
peeling
the
plastic
off
of
the
specialist
parts
was
always
cool
love
the
front
suspension
positive
that
price
is
exceptional
its
less
than
what
i
paid
for
mine
9
years
ago
and
is
even
less
than
the
original
price
of
the
set
note
that
the
stickers
in
this
set
are
the
bad
variety
that
will
crack
and
peel
over
time
if
you
want
to
preserve
them
the
technic
flag
in
particular
you
will
need
to
tape
over
it
neutral
somehow
i
also
managed
to
get
this
set
in
very
good
condition
including
box
instructions
and
all
stickers
for
a
mere
$
22
a
few
months
ago
this
is
indeed
a
very
special
set
and
was
a
pleasure
to
build
the
only
flaw
i
noticed
was
weak
support
of
the
rear
drivetrain
which
was
easily
corrected
with
a
few
extra
plates

hello

yes
i
got
a

i
was

how

some
of

just
the

i
believe
mine
having
the
american
version
has
the

on
it
as
you
can
see
it
has
the
classic

and
the

as
well
as
the

very

the

is
the
main

of
the

this

shows
the

solid

sturdy

those

are
pointless
no

they
dont

used
at

nice
tlc
now
we
get
cooking
this
pic
shows
the
tail
added
on
and
the
more
bulk
being
built
we
get
a
little
repetitive
and
build
the
craft
up
in
this

this

the

i
got
this

for
a
birthday
present
last
year
and
it
is
pretty
fun
overall
the
alien
ship
in
this
set
is
actually
one
of
my
favorites
it
just
looks
cool
and
the
way
you
can
fold
it
out
is
really
clever
the
only
negative
for
me
is
the
cockpit
of
the
mining
unit
not
really
because
it
isnt
detailed
but
because
mine
is
top
heavy
and
keeps
falling
forward
its
kinda
funny
if
you
think
about
him
driving
along
and
then
falling
forwardbut
not
funny
at
all
when
youre
playing
mine
doesnt
fall
forward
maybe
the
newer
ones
have
stronger
joints

those
oldschool

wheels

despite
those
wobbly

i
really
like
the
alien
ship
goes
from
a
flying
saucerish
shape
to
a
spread
winged
almost
raven
shape
very
ominous
and
cool
looking

that
alien

is
terrible
if
i
dont

bionicle

why
would

wish

take

hi
this

my
forth
oldschool

set
review
since
blakbird
pointed
out
that
all
my
technic
reviews
are
red
i
chose
a
yellow
dune
blaster
for
today
just
kidding
this
set
is
red
as
it
should
be
dont
worry
my
next
reviews
will
be
yellow
and
black
uhhh

will

fact
the

final
thoughts
this
is
my
second
8829
and
i
also
noticed
that
the

turns
very
hard
the
alternate
model
is
really
sorry
to
all
those
of
you
who
like
it
crappy
i
mean
a

not

that
looks

a
very

in
your
opinion
how
does
it
compare

toa

positive
i
dont
own
the
8296
but
what
i
can
see
from
the
pictures
i
would
say
that
8296
is
very
similar
to
8829
the
only
things
that
are
different
ist
that
8296
is
studless
and
features
a
steering
wheel
for
the
seat
but
8829
has
got
bigger
wheels
it
also
would
have
been
nice
if
the
wheels
from
8296
could
have
the
same
tread

imho
8829
is

first
8829
is
a

bigger
i
really
like
the
huge

balloon
tires
they
both
have
rack

pinion
steering
and
they
both
have
trailing

rear

with
a

i
think
the
body
on
8829
is
a
little
more
well
done
for
8296
i
think
the
alternate

one
thing
i
noticed
is
that
a
bunch
of
your
pictures
are
missing
the
beam
that
goes
over
the
left
hand
wheel
as
a
fender
oh
no
i
forgot
to
put
it
back
i
wanted
to
make
a
photo
with
this
beam
alone

blakbird
said
what
kind
of
camera
do
you
use
the
pictures
have
very
good
depth
of
field
meaning
that
both
the
foreground
and
the
background
are
in
good
focus
this
is
usually
hard
to
do
without
a
very
small
aperture
the
camera
belongs
to
my
dad
its
a
panasonic
lumix

blakbird
said
one
of
them
works
well
mated
with
an
8
tooth
on
parallel
axles
and
the
other
one
doesnt
the
difference
is
only
supposed
to
be
longer
teeth
so
it
really
should
not
matter
but
it
does
if
your
set
works
bad
try
switching
the
crown
gear
to
one
of
the
other
variety
worked
for
me
wow
youre
right
never
thought
of
that
thanks
i
made
a
scan
of
those
two
gears
you
can

hello
all
apologize
for
digging
out
a
such
old
post
recently
i
got
a
bag
of
lego
technic
parts
where
there
have
been
mixed
three
sets
8858
8829
and
8235
the
resurrection
of
8858
has
been
described
by
me
in
a
separate
post
going
back
to
the
dune
buggy
--
when
i
saw
it
for
the
first
time
back
in
1994
i
did
not
like
it
as
i
was
always
big
fan
of
8840
which
i
consider
to
the
day
the
best
looking
buggy
and
set
8829
looked
to
me
ugly
so
there
were
those
all
parts
in
the
bag
...
then
i
though
why
not
build
it
and
i
started
to
do
it
when
i
finished
i
was
very
surprised
how
the
final
look
of
this
set
is
really
taking
my
words
back
unfortunately
in
the
bag
there
were
missing
some
parts
and
i
could
not
rebuild
the
back
spoiler
so
i
made
some
changes
to
it
and
make
it
from
spare
parts
that
i
have
and
it
came
out
acceptable
i
also
added
some
additional
parts
such
as
``
fake
''
steering
wheel
``
rally
''
logo
antennas
i
have
also
reverse
mounting
of
the
rear
tires
--
why
lego
did
them
like
that
i
never
know
--
as
i
think
they
look
better
this
way
set
well
the
review
has
been
already
made
by
owner
of
this
post
so
i
will
only
add
few
things
into
it
engine
--
v2
aired
cooled
is
driven
by
4
gears
from
the
single
wheel
no
differential
as
in
8840
using
two
old
school
z14
tooth
bevel
then
by
z24
tooth
crown
and
z8
tooth
type
1
actually
the
as
in
most
old
sets
the
pistons
are
moving
very
fast
not
as
in
current
sets
and
smooths
--
i
needed
to
extra
clean
all
engine
parts
as
there
was
a
lot
friction
suspension
--
set
has
``
engine
bay
''
working
using
two
old
gray
shock
absorbers
65l
--
the
movement
is
not
big
but
works
very
nice
better
then
in
8840
in
my
opinion
steering
--
this
is
a
bit
odd
as
there
is
no
direct
connection
to
hog
as
in
most
old
sets
but
first
the
gear
rack
is
moved
by
z8
then
two
z14
tooth
where
reverse
movement
is
taking
place
later
connection
of
two
old
school
z14
tooth
bevel
goes
to
hog
details
--
this
is
the
most
that
i
like
in
this
set
specially
how
the
use
of
axle
pin
connector
perpendicular
and
1x10
bricks
with
3x3
cut
corners
and
plate
1x5
toothed
ends
2
studs
with
center
axle
hole
are
making
the
body
shape
--
is
just
wonder
tires
--
the
balloon
rear
are
pretty
nice
the
front
is
a
new
version
of
those
that
were
in
8840
what
i
do
not
like
1
missing
of
technic
figure
8840
had
it
2
no
steering
wheel
in
the
original
set
3
no
differential
--
but
having
in
mind
that
lego
has
introduce
2412
teeth
would
be
difficult
to
build
the
transmission
in
such
small
space
where
the
engine
is
i
will
shortly
upload
new
pictures
and
post
them
here
later
on
over
all
--
i
think
it
is
worth
buying
it
as
it
is
very
payable
actually
very
payable
and
runs
smoothly
the
steering
suspension
--
perfect
thank
you
and
regards
positive
pictures
of
my
restored
set
8829
i
was
almost
96
complete
and
for
missing
parts
i
add
of
my
own
the
seat
is
black
and
not
blue
as
one
was
missing
in
my
8858
the
spoiler
is
different
steering
wheel
added
not
connected
to
wheels
and
some
additional
items
to
make
it
look
better
this
is
how
i
change
the
tire
orientation
the
new
rear
spoiler
i
still
need
to
clean
front
rims

wow
this
buggy
was
my
very
first
lego
set
i
like
this
review
it
remembered
my
childhood
i
also
liked
its
body
with
those
8
studs
long
bricks
on
sides
i
can
also
remember
trying
to
build
engine
in
such
way
that
it
works
smooth
without
success
anyway
i
think
its
studless
version
set
8048
is
much
better
positive
finally
after
a
very
frustrating
incident
with
the
internet
explorer

i
present
to
you
my
very
first
review
this
is
a

8158
speed
racer

oiler
its
also
the
first
review
of
a
speed
racer
set
on
eurobricks
also
you
should
know
that
i
didnt
put
the
stickers
on
as
they
can
be
quite
valuable
later
on
down
the
road
so
im
sorry
for
the
lack
of
stickers
so
without
further
ado
i
present
to
you
my
first

a
very
well

its
only
downfalls
are
that
there
are

too

stickers
32
to
be
exact
and
there
are
no
cool
contraptions
on
the
cars
to
take
out
the

a
great
buy
for
1999
i
reccomend
this
set
to
everybody
because
of
the
reasons
i
staed
above
and
because
even
i
who
is
not
a

both

i
definately
prefer
8159
in
terms
of
minifigs
and
useful
parts
colors
to
me
but
the
cars
are
all
the
same
basic
design
thanks
for
the
review
and
i
actually
love
the
stickers
this
means
i
wont
have
to
rub
off
all
the
print
and
if
wanted
i
can
use
stickers
elsewhere
i
prefer
8159
too
because
of
the
minifigs
mostly
xd
anyways
the
review
of
set
8159
is
now
open
for
viewing
pleasure
just
click
here
yes
they
all
have
the
same
basic
design
so
far
i
never
thought
of
stickers
like
that
thanks
for
enlightening
me
you
are

the
cars
are
pretty
nice

i
think
the
people
sit
way
too
high
in

almost
no
protection

am
planning
on
modifying
them

final
thoughts
definitely
worth
buying
as
a
child
i
thought
it
looks
hideous
but
today
i
've
found
out
it
's
totally
fun
to
build
and
freaking
functional
three
things
i
want
to
mention
though
the
bjst
can
only
be
slewed
a
new
word
if
the
outriggers
are
deployed
it
is
also
possible
that
the
bjst
will
reach
the
ground
danger
of
grinding
or
sticking
even
if
the
outriggers
are
deployed
the
two
mechanisms
for
the
loader
bucket
can
actually
interlock
and
the
14
tooth
gears
might
break
disentangle
from
the
axle
thanks
for
viewing
the
pictures
i
hope
you
enjoyed
it
please
comment
if
you
want
to
neutral
ah
what
a
very
fine

studs

you

excellent

fantastic
job
with
all
these
great
pictures
y
positive
another
nice
review
the
slow
shutter
speed
pictures
are
great
i
think
that
was
the
only
set
with
8
distinct
functions
for
a
very
long
time
and
was
only
displaced
by
the
8455
backhoe
in
that
respect
the
turntable
on
the
back
doesnt
turn
very
well
though
as
the
weight
is
all
distributed
on
one
side
the
screw
axle
prevents
it
from
popping
off
but
there
is
still
a
lot
of
friction
in
it
i
dont
have
mine
built
anymore
but
it
might
be
worth
trying
to
put
a
weight
brick
or
something
on
it
quote
do
you
have
8455
as
well
id
love
to
see
how
they
compare
side
by
side
it
looks
bigger
than
8455
but
i
dont
own
any
of
the
big
old
chuncky
tires
so
i
find
it
so
hard
to
tell
yeah
its
quite
a
bit
bigger
when
everything
is
fully
extended
it
becomes
something
like
26
long
although
the
8455
actually
has
morebetter

thanks
for
your
feedback
i
like
both

i
would

is
far
more
than
just
a
studless
version
with
10
pneumatic
cylinders

2

of
those
off

several
years

back
when
the
price
used

be
more

15
or
so
but
i
realized
that
i
hardly
ever
use
the
couple
that
i
already
have
p
they
came
out
with
the
modern
turntable
the
year
after
this
set
which
mostly
negated
the
need
for
these
screw
axles
i
think
their
only
use
now
is
to
hold
nonlego
objects
onto
models
like
the
technic
pen
in
8094
i
guess
you
can
try
to
make
linear
actuators

i
liked
it
so
much
that
i
bought
two
copies
of
this

so
i
could
display
both
my
favorite
alternate
model
not
counting
universal
sets
is
the
8480
submarine
maybe
it
is
time
for
a

review
skull
white
is
pretty
rare
for
your
blue
set
i
recommend
you
review
8462
there
are
only
a
couple
of
green
sets
and
8479
is
the
best
and
then
of
course
8458
is
silver
i
think
we
all
know
what
the
best
black

is
and
according
to

you
have
lots

them

rocks

just
got
it
a

lets
see
8462
also
is
one
of
the
last
technic
sets
i
would
call
oldschool
8479
okay
too
but
8458
is
imho
not
8868
and
the
totally
mysteriously
black
set
will
follow
quote
i
was
thinking
you
could
somehow
attach
a
16tooth
dark
gray
gear
the
one
that
spins
freely
around
axles
to
the
nut
which
would
make
the
axle
move
in
and
out
when
the
gear
turned
and
convert
the
gears
rotary
motion
to
linear
motion
in
a
fairly
compact
package
did
you
had
something
like
this
in
mind
if
the
toothed
10l
axle
rotates
the
axle
nuts
want
to
rotate
too
but
they
cant
because
of
that
2x4
technic
plate
so
theyll
decide
to
move
along
the
axle
the
1x6
bricks
on
each
end
make
sure
that
the
axle
wont
move
in
or
out

wow
thats
a

exposure
i
would
think
you
would
get
way
too
much
light

overexpose
the

the

must
have
been
tiny

i
will
review
it

i

also

actually
i
took
it
from
your
site
xd
i
thought
that
word
sounded
familiar

unfortunately
i
dont
own
8480

i

8824
is
also
a
very

you
dont
own
8480
that
is
unacceptable
it
is
imperative
that
you
put
a
mortgage
on
your
house
immediately
to
get
it
sweet
yes
8824
is
a
good
white
set
i
also
see
from
your
room
photos
that
you
have
the
8839
supply
ship
which
has
lots
of
white
this
is
a
really
nice
set
8462
is
hard
to
call
old
school
but
at
least
it
uses
regular
beams
the
air
tanks
are
the
best
part
of
the
set
i
wish
lego
had
used
them
more
often
especially
on
the
highly
pneumatic
sets
the
tank
makes
all
the
difference
on
8459
you
are
right
8458
is
certainly
not
old
school
but
it
is
a
great
set
with
wonderful
suspension
it
is
of
the
same
era
as
the
super
street
sensation
with
all
of
the
panels
for
body
contouring
8868
is
technic
at
its
best
there
is
nothing
else
like
it
especially
with
the
compressor
quote
did
you
had
something
like
this
in
mind
if
the
toothed
10l
axle
rotates
the
axle
nuts
want
to
rotate
too
but
they
cant
because
of
that
2x4
technic
plate
so
theyll
decide
to
move
along
the
axle
the
1x6
bricks
on
each
end
make
sure
that
the
axle
wont
move
in
or
out
thanks
for
your
feedback
while
the
assembly
you
have
drawn
would
work
as
a
linear
actuator
i
would
not
recommend
it
the
torsional
stiffness
and
strength
of
an
axle
are
proportional
to
the
polar
moment
of
inertia
a
section
property
most
of
the
stiffness
comes
from
the
outside
of
the
cross
shaped
axle
but
in
the
threaded
axle
you
lose
all
the
stiffness
of
the
outer
area
because
it
is
not
continuous
this
means
you
only
get
stiffness
and
strength
from
the
small
core
i
think
the
threaded
axle
would
bend
and
break
very
easily
if
subjected
to
much
torque

yeah
the
tow
truck
was
the
last
set
that
still
used
mainly
studded
beams
they
made
many
changes
to
technic
the
following
year
with
models
becoming
predominantly
studless
and
making
heavy
use
of
the
flexible
axleshoses
and
decorative
panels
the
technic
logo
and
box
art
style
was
also
changed
a
lot
i
really
like
the
overall
construction
of
that
set
the
model
is
fairly
lightweight
but
extremely
sturdy
it
must
be
one
of
the
strongest
large
sets
theyve
released
quote
did
you
had
something
like
this
in
mind
thats
basically
the
idea
as
blakbird
said
though
it
wouldnt
be
very
powerful
and
would
put
the
axle
under
some
stress
the
linear
actuators
theyre
bringing
out
this
year
do
the
same
thing
and
should
work
much
better

summary
this

is
an
excellent
buy
at
20
dollars
its
well
designed
and
has
lots
of
details
it
also
has
very
unique
minifigs
which
are
always
good
in
a
set
its
only
downfalls
are
the
lack
of
acessories
for
the
minifigs
and
that
there
are
no
cool
contraptions
on
the
cars
and
by
cool
i
mean
lethal
to
the
other
racers

the

for

on

cars
but
both
are
easily
modifiedfixed
hence
the

overall

a
great
set
bonus
try
and
count
how
many
times
my
silver

appears
and
win
the
knowledge
of
knowing
how
many
times
the
silver

y
nope
p
and

hollisbrick
they
are
both
really
similar
so
it
really
depends
on
which
colors
you
use
more
in
mocing
or
which
characters
you
like
more
my
personal
choice
is
8159
as
it
has
cooler
minifigs
except
for
racer
xs
recycled
head
and
the
colors
are
more
useful
to
me
then
again
if

the

like
this

the

has

and

hollisbrick
they
are
both
really
similar
so
it
really
depends
on
which
colors
you
use
more
in
mocing
or
which
characters
you
like
more
my
personal
choice
is
8159
as
it
has
cooler
minifigs
except
for
racer
xs
recycled
head
and
the
colors
are
more
useful
to
me
then
again
if
youre
like

the
only
thing
that
matters
is
if
a

has

in

id
have
to
agree
with
you
with
regards
the
helmet
i
wouldve
preferred
this
especially
for
speed
interestingly
my
pocket

is
the
same
as
that
one
i
didnt

its

neutral
speaking
of

i
just
got
speed
racer
and
snake
oiler
at

and
might
mod
the
helmet
so
it
actually
looks
like
the

the
problem
is
i
dont
want
to
shell
out
two
bucks
for
a
clear
visor

the

i
know
transclear

are

what

i
would
have
gotten
this

with
the
one
i
purchased

didnt
have
enough
dough

to
get
both

very
good

these
sets
are
a

better
than
i
expected

for

might
have
to
pick
up
both
my

and
i
are
going

hopefully
ill
pick
these

some

as
promised
and
with
only
a
single
day
of

is
my
review
of
the
2008
set

creator
fierce
creatures
this
small
set
is
the
same
size
and
price
range
as
last
years
4939
cool
cars
reviewed
by
prateek
and
dillthepill
the
box
general
info
you
get
193
pieces
vs
206
for
cool
cars
which
is
quite
a
lot
but
most
of
them
are
small
there
are
a
lot
of
hinges
and
some
good
slopes
and
wings
the
building
instructions
contains
three
models
but
no
further
ideas
for
inspiration
primary
model
spider
the
first
model
is
a
big
spider
which
shares
some
similarities
to
the
secondary
model
of
4895
power
in
the
design
the
legs
each
have
3
joints
where
the
ones
in
the
middle
have
stud
joints
to
be
moved
sideways
while
the
rest
use
hinges
for
all
joints
there
are
8
of
them
and
it
does
get
a
little
tedious
with
all
the
repetitive
building
in
this
relatively
small
model
i
like
the
design
of
the
face
with
a
lot
of
eyes
and
a
big
and
ugly
mouth
but
the
real
gem
is
the
xpattern
on
the
opisthosoma
made
using
doubleinverted
slopes
it
is
poseable
and
i
think
it
looks
more
fierce
when
inverted
secondary
model
snake
the
face
of
the
snake
is
nicely
detailed
with
a
splitting
tongue
and
a
mouth
than
can
move
a
little
there
is
a
problem
with
the
construction
it
uses
stacked
hinges
for
some
of
the
joints
which
are
hard
to
pull
apart
without
stressing
the
pieces
tertiary
model
fly
im
not
completely
sure
what
this
insect
is
i
will
say
its
a
fly
although
the
tail
and
head
are
too
pointy
this
is
a
neat
little
thing
conclusion
primary
model
8
it
is
a
good
design
but
lacks
some
sturdiness
in
the
legs
they
fall
off
a
little
too
easily
secondary
models
6
they
are
pretty
good
when
you
look
at
the
bricks
that
are
available
but
they
dont
wow
you
in
any
way
and
they
suffer
from
the
same
issues
as
the
primary
model
regarding
sturdiness
alternate
models
3
it
is
hard
to
come
up
with
alternate
models
with
so
many
small
pieces
and
plates
that
are
only
1
stud
wide
the
colors
might
make
you
want
to
build
a
spyrius
space
ship
playability
8
the
models
have
many
movable
joints
and
you
can
put
quite
a
scare
into
your
minifigs
when
their
town
gets
attacked
by
these
creatures
unless
some
en
forces
are
there
to
protect
them
price
6
creator
sets
are
known
for
their
great
price
to
bricks
ratio
but
this
set
doesnt
quite
measure
up
to
sets
like
cool
cars
pieces
7
the
pieces
arent
great
by
themselves
but
who
doesnt
need
a
fist
full
of
hinges
slopes
and
basic
plates
in
standard
colors
i
dont
think
this
is
a
musthave
set
like
the
big
rig
was
last
year
the
pieces
are
great
and
it
has
a
nice
primary
model
but
the
set
lacks
a
bit
when
it
comes
to
the
usual
strong
creator
qualities
like
alternate
models
and
price

excellent

y
getting
a
better
chance

at
this

actually
makes
me
interested
in
it
i
was
in
my
dark
ages
throughout
the
islander
days
though
i
have
built
up
a
small
force
of
them
10
from
ebay
buys
but
no
actual
sets
if
this
is
really
as
reasonable
as
you
say
there
i
may
just
have
to
pick
one
up
soon
oddly
i
do
own
the
baseplates
to
this
set
having
also
picked
them
up
in
a
lot
on
ebay
so
i
might
be
able
to
recreate
it
manually
but
i
think
id
rather
pick
one
up
whole
it
looks
like
a
great
mix
of
parts

makes
a
decent
looking

thanks

positive
thanks
for
a
lovely
review
i
only
recently
bought
this
set
off
ebay
pretty
good
deal
misb
for
30
euros
and
i
enjoyed
putting
it
together
and
mixing
it
with
the
other
piratesets
when
you
put
two
sets
of
two
baseplates
together
youll
get
a
large
pond
with
an
island
in
the
center
just
to
achieve
that
i
bought
two
more
baseplates
off
ebay
the
result
is
this
moc
i
always
loved
the
islanders
and
have
most
of
the
sets
not
all
of
them
but
that
is
going
to
change
in
the
future
y
positive
excellent
review
i
really
like
this
set
and
so
i
gave
it
a
55
this
set
is
on
my
list
to
get
i
especially
like
the
speedy
pirate
boat
and
the
also
very
fast
outrigger
canoe
with
a
sail
i
dont
think
a
small
number
of
these
cannibals
will
make
much
of
an
impact
on
gaming
though
even
if
they
get
a
bonus
with
spears

great

sweet
a
wonderful
set
this
is
indeed
full
of
nice
details
and
pretty
playable
and
a
cool
subtheme
that
offers
a
lot
of
fantasy
and
charming
characters
in
a
marvelous
layout
i
really
love
that
little
boat
with
the
outrigger
and
the
neat
buildings
and
sweet
landscaping
works
together
very
well
tlc
got
sued
for
using
some
names
of
native
sounding
origin
now
that
sounds
really
strange
to
me
such
names
´
re
widely
spread
within
novels
movies
and
such
stuff
i
didn
´
t
know
that
there
´
s
some

good
review
mr

know

deserves
better

i
only
give
him
a
3
ill
be
surely
the
only
saying
that
i
dont
like
this
set
but
i
remember
i
had
it
for
christmas
when
i
was
a
child
and
it
disappointed
me
very
much
because
i
expected
it
much
larger
after
seeing
it
in
the
lego
catalogs
well
its
just
a
little
trauma
i
had
p
lol
anyway
i
must
admit
its
an
interesant
set
specially
because
of
the
large
number
of
minifigures
and
accesories
it
brings
with
and
the
two
little
ships

thank
you

so
many
things
to
get
on

want

my
easy

positive
its
a
great
set
and
one
i
have
yet
to
add
to
my
collection
despite
my
large
number
of
islander
extras
enchanted
island
aside
from
having
so
alluring
a
name
was
good
value
for
money
in
that
you
only
needed
this
one
set
and
you
had
a
good
representation
of
the
islanders
both
in
the
size
of
the
set
and
the
number
of
minifigs
the
flipping
rope
bridge
and
the
river
give
it
a
great
rainforest
retreat
sort
of
feeling
and
one
is
inclined
to
think
of
this
set
as
more
inland
than
directly
coastal
for
me
whilst
the
islanders
were
never
seen
in
the
same
light
or
popularity
as
pirates
and
imperials
they
were
an
obvious
and
colourful
addition
that
to
me
added
a
whole
new
depth
to
the
pirate
system
and
one
was
now
able
to
play
a
3
or
4
way
war
adding
a
greater
political
element
to
the
sets
enchanted
island
is
probably
the
3rd
most
appealing
of
the
large
land
bases
for
me
after
port
royal
and
eldorado
fortress

this

always
cried
to

one

never

got
the
smaller
islander
sets
but
the
more
i
see
this
now
i
dont
want
it
i
could
buy
it

naahh
i
am
hoping

does
an
updated

can

not
the

i

fortunately

its
a

have
a
thing
with
the

i
know
that
they
are
weird
poorly
based
on
the
polynesian
aborigens
etc

they
are
very
original
broke
with
the
traditional
enemies

gave
to
the

an
exotic

sorry
to
bump
such
an
old
thread
but
i
´
ve
just
discovered
this
set
is
on
sale
at
amazonde
for
a
mere
25
euros
i
am
tempted
not
because
i
like
the
set
or
the
models
but
because
of
the
parts
as
most
of
you
might
know
i
´
m
especially
into
exoforce
so
would
you
recommend
to
get
this
set
just
for
the
parts
are
they
a
good
choice
to
combine
with
efsets
would
anyone
of
you
be
interested
in
obtaining
the
fleshieparts
of
the
minifigs
from
me
as
i
totally
don
´
t
need
those
neutral
i
picked
up
this
set
a
few
weeks
ago
along
with
the
smaller
sets
that
come
with
the
mach
5
and
racer
xs
car
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
the
commentators
stand
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
the
assortment
of
figs
is
great
numerous
new
face
prints
in
flesh
i
believe
and
in
spite
of
the
large
amount
of
stickers
the
three
cars
are
each
unique
and
very
welldesigned
my
only
gripe
about
them
is
that
cannonball
taylors
car
the
black
and
yellow
one
was
a
missed
opportunity
as
in
the
movie
its
yellow
and
purple
i
know
tlc
is
dropping
purple
for
the
future
and
had
a
bunch
of
problems
with
it
in
the
past
but
it
would
have
made
for
a
great
looking
car
imo

come
up

the

please
bear
with

this

also
a

to
this
nice
fellow
who
gave
me
the
title
thats
what
im
talking
about
1
useless
information
with
high
numbers
this
set
contains
841
parts
and
was
released
in
1995
in
the
technic
tech

the

a

i
got
it
for

still
ca
n't
believe
it
this

was
rereleased

times

in

in

the
box
front
back
open
the
box
is
higher
than

why
i
do
n't
know
8460
does
n't
have
any
real
large
parts
whatever
inlay
i
wonder
why
tlg
does
n't
make
inlays
anymore
...
they
're
noisy
and
brake
easily

are
great
for

instructions
i
will
quote
myself
from
the

wow

are

said
this
is
the

fortunately
peeron
offers
scans
the
last

for
the

and
a
few
nice
photos
showing
how
the
pneumatic
pump
will
be
erm
pumped
yeah
random
page
i
forgot
the
overall
thoughts
to
the
instructions
these
are
technic
instructions
as
we
're
used
to
them
part
count
easy
to
understand
okay
the
string
part
at
the
end
was
too
much
for
me
and
the
color
distinction
is
okay
too
100
pages
long
and
if
i
can
trust
my
eyes
the
pneumatics
page
can
be
fold
out
i
do
n't
have
this

i
assume
it

an
easy

this
could
take
some

my
longest
building
review
up
to
date
the
front
steering
the
rear
steering
the
axle
pin
between
the
rear
steering
is
for
the
axle
which
rotates
the
crane
the
two
worm
screws
in
the
front
are
for
the
outriggers
they
're
not
linked
one
for
each
side
the
small
wheel
in
the
back
is
for
the
rotation
adjusting
front
and
rear
steering
outriggers
are
finished
you
can
notice
a
8
tooth
gear
that
will
rotate
the
technic
turntable
a
steering
wheel
has
been
added
could
be
the
same
stickers
like
the
alternate
8880
used
to
have
the
steering
can
be
operated
with
both
actinic
lights
no
we
're
far
from
finished
i
've
got
a
lot
of
parts
left
at
this
point
wow
a
4x4
corner

a

the

uuuh
...
once
again
a
depth
of

tried
to
make

i
failed
somehow
8460
looks
cute

comparison
to
8421
mobile
crane
crane
truck
i
feel
that
a
question
concerning
this
will
be
asked
so
i
deal
with
it
right
now
first
of
all
i
do
n't
own
8421
yet
i
know
a
technic
freak
really
should
own
it
anyway
8421
has
more
than
twice
as
much
parts
as
8460
is
motorized
features
a
v6engine
and
a
very
neat
mechanism
to
extend
the
craneboom
twice
using
a
braided
string
with
end
studs
try
to
find
out
how
of
course
8421
features
far
more
than
8460
imho
8421
should
have
been
a
copy
of
8460
a
set
so
successful
that
it
has
been
rereleased
two
times
but
the
designers
overshoot
the
mark
8421
is
a
breathtaking
monster
compared
to
it
8460
looks
cute
not
pale
9
final
thoughts
i
got
it
on
ebay
in
kind
of
good
condition
for
about
50
dollars
i
know
that
it
has
been
worth
the
money
in
any
point
of
view
wub
i
did
n't
use
the
word
``
oldschool
''
for
now
i
'll
change
that
8460
belongs
to
the
favored
few
of
oldschool
technic
sets
thanks
for
reading
and
viewing
the
pictures
i
hope
you
enjoyed
it
please
comment
if
you
want
to
positive
im
in
the
same
situation
as
you
i
have
this
set
but
missed
out
on
the
newer
8421
this
was
a
great
set
for
its
time
but
the
8421
definitely
looks
better
to
me
ive
been
trying
to
find
a
good
deal
on
it
on
ebay
but
its
pretty
expensive
considering
that
it
only
went
out
of
production
last
year
quote
inlay
i
wonder
why
tlg
does
n't
make
inlays
anymore
...
they
're
noisy
and
brake
easily
but
are
great
for
pre
sorting
the
box
designs
in
general
are
crappier
these
days
than
they
used
to
be
10
years
ago
you
dont
see
the
old
featured
parts
trays
anymore
and
the
boxes
dont
have
the
different
sections
either
these
also
acted
as
internal
supports
for
larger
boxes
so
they
were
less
prone
to
being
crushed
the
cardboard
material
is
also
quite
a
bit
thinner
i
think
its
a
result
of
tlcs
overall
costcutting
moves
since
then
most
people
toss
the
boxes
and
probably
dont
care
but
i
keep
all
of
them
there
was
actually
a
time
when
the
boxes
used
to
be
even
stronger
i
have
an
old
8859
set
and
the
outer
box
is
made
of
a
hard
styrofoam
material
although
they
probably
stopped
using
that
for
environmental
reasons

a
great

thank
you
i
do
not
know
these
old
sets
like
this
one
but
it
is
very
cool
to
see
how
they
were
made
i
have
an
unopened
8421
maybe
i
should
do
a
small
review
of
that
when
i
get
to
build
it
btw
boxes
are
expensive
so
at
a
given
price
point
its
a
choise
between
more
bricks
or
nicer
boxes
i
have
no

what
most
people
would

thanks
for
the

for
its

and
parts

this
is
a
remarkably
featured
set
i
dont
think
ive
never
seen
the
alternate
model
before
personally
i
prefer
8421
because
i
think
it
looks
much
better
and
i
love
the
six
wheel
steering
i
also
love
the
three
segment
boom
and
the
transmission
they
fit
it
all
in
so
neatly
i
realise
that
it
has
trouble
even
holding
up
itself
but
ultimately
it
doesnt
matter
as
its
not
like
you
are
really
going
to
construction
work
with
it
what
bothers
me
more
about
8421
is
the
design
change
in
the
boom
from
chainlinks
to
strings
i
would
try
to
mod
mine
but
all
i
have
is
the
prototype
picture
to
base
it
on
and
i
dont
have
enough
links
anyway

those

lake
some

but
i
'm
really
happy
to
see
that
tlc
has
made
some
new

for
hairpieces
it
's
the
good
part
of
the
theatre

so
it
's
a
really
interesting

you
've
got
a

this
is
so
far
my
favorite
crystal
skull
set
released
the
cargo
plane
is
however
the
best
i
love
the
small
accessories
like
turkey
leg
banana
golden
sword
and
giant
ants
mutts
torso
is
very
nice
i
love
the
leather
jacket
print
irina
is
just
a
another
hottie
but
i
would
like
to
see
her
smile
oh
and
another
indy
positive
i
was
already
thinking
of
buying
this
set
and
youve
totally
convinced
me
thanks
for
the
review
alex
btw
i
think
they
are
ants
having
that
shape
moreover
we
already
have
spider
molds
and
they
have
already
been
used
in
theatre
themes
see
spiderman
luxorv
positive
ok
i
think
its
a
nobrainer
that
this
is
a
musthave
for
pretty
much
anyone
who
likes
lego
its
cheap
and
a
great
minifigs
parts
pack
ill
be
getting
at
least
1
of
these
here
is
what
i
like
about
it
1
great
minifigs
with
nice
torsos
sweet
faces
and
awesome
hair
got
ta
ask
em
where
they
get
it
done
2
golden
katana
3
chicken
leg
yum
4
nice
campfire
and
this
is
what
i
dont
like
about
it
1
dark
bley
knife
seriously
they
could
have
at
least
made
it
silver
like
the
sword
if
not
chrome
2
rehashed
tent
3
spiders
with
6
legs
i
actually
dont
really
care
about
the
tent
and
the
multilegged
creatures
those
go
straight
into
the
sorting
boxes
perhaps
i
might
use
the
tent
someday
for
a
steampunk
moc
of
some
kind
or
a
stopmotion
film
or
maybe
some
kind
of
contest
anyway
whats
up
with
that
thing
that
holds
the
katana
the
sword
and
the
saber
its
in
the
airplane
set
too
is
it
perhaps
one
of
the
treasures
of
the
new
movie
or
is
it
something
indy
takes
with
him
everywhere
in
this
film
44however
nice
pics
nice
review
thanks

simply
that

i

i
´
ll
have
to
buy
three
of
these
just
to
make
a
proper

moc
somewhen
a
great
little
set
indeed
with
marvelous
new
mf
torsos
and
that
new
black
feminine
hairpiece
´
s
also
great
and
very
useable
for
creating
some
characters
related
to
the
sixties
and
seventies
and
finally
a
pan
that
´
s
not
black
and
a
knife
in
grey
that
´
s
very
handy
indeed
the
chrome
one
always
looked
a

a
general
view
of
the
set
we
've
got
an
amphibious
vehicle
a
small
boat
an
observation
post
and
a
dark
green
croco
so
beautiful
for
the
figs
we
've
got
indy
of
course
marion
and
two
russian
soldiers
nothing
special
here
in
the
back
of
the
tree
there
is
a
box
to
put
some
things
the
amphibious
vehicle
is
very
nice
the
proportions
are
really
great
not
too
big
not
too
small
and
there
are
a
lot
of
details
everywhere
like
the
propeller
a
back
view
an
inside
view
the
small
boat
is
a
dark
grey
zodiac
but
the
details
are
nice
too
giving
it
a
retro
look
in
the
same
way
of
all
the
indy
vehicles
the
outpost
has
a
net
to
permit
to
the
bad
guys
to
capture
some
nice
guys
and
girls
...
but
it
seems
that
the
girl
marion
is
scared
of
the
nice
croco
so
indy
comes
and
help
her
pushing
the
technic
axle
with
this
round
inversed
tiles
which
push
out
the
net
and
capture
the
croco
now
marion
feels
happier
and
she
takes
a
can
of
oil
and
whacks
the
poor
croco
without
defences
who
has
said
marion
is
a
nice
girl
so
i
've
bought
this
set
like
an
add
on
to
my
city
in
fact
the
elements
of
this
set
can
easily
be
integrated
in
a
town
layout
i
plan
to
use
the
outpost
for
my
forest
section
and
the
amphibious
vehicle
is
always
a
nice
touch
of
originality
in
a
layout
yes
you
can
use
all
those
military
things
without
creating
an
army
in
a
layout
just
put
the
violent
parts
out
and
you
've
got
nice
things
like
a
biologist
car
in
the
case
of
the
amphibious
vehicle
positive
nice
little
review
here
alex
i
like
your
idea
to
make
the
aquatic
car
into
one
for
a
geologist
i
really
like
the
little
details
in
this
set
such
as
the
little
petrol
can
and
the
propeller
at
the
back
of
the
car
a
must
buy
in
my
view
thanks
again

musthave
positive
wow
this
is
a
fantastic

i
love
the
dark
green
croc
and
other
features
marion
is
good
to
have
again
and
i
love
her
new
torso
and
those
commies
look
great
as
well

happy

to

this

good
about

kept
thinking
this
thing
looked
lame
a
boat
on
treads
with
saw
blades
but
this
is
definetly
something
i
want
now
lots
of
great
plant
and
animal
parts
and
looks
like
plenty
of
wheels
with
those
treads
its
just
begging
to
be
made
into
a

great
review
thanks
a
lot
for
all
the

i
agree
that
this
is
probably
the
nicest
set
of
the
indy
4
wave
so
much
dark
green
and
i
love
all
the
plant
pieces
its
been
ages
since
weve
had
enough
pieces
in
a
regular
release
to
build
nice
forests
so
its
great
to
see
11
of
the
dark
green
leaves
in
one
set
and
all
the
vines
the
design
of
the
cutter
looks
very
solid
and
brick
built
as
well
giant
ants
are
great
looking
too
positive
a
great
detailed
review
for
an
excellent
set
i
love
the
jungle
cutter
vehicle
itself
and
all
the
dark
green
its
great
to
have
the
trees
and
cave
entrance
you
can
never
have
enough
extras
the
figs
are
nice
too
two

the
coollooking

his
name
is
dovchenko
or
something
and
the
repeatedbutstillnice
indy
with
rpg
thanks
again
looks
like
ill
be
picking
this
up
along
with
jungle
duel
by
the
way
i
think
this
set
is
called
jungle
cutter
positive
thanks
for
this
fantastic
review
alex
those
trees
are
a
neat
add
on
to
any
jungle
as
is
that
sweet
cave
but
the
main
part
of
this
set
the
jungle
cutter
man
that
is
wicked
packed
with
that
awesome
dark
green
and
with
those
wonderful
treads
not
to
mention
the
smoothly
spinning
buzz
saws
however
this
sets
a
tad
overpriced
in
my
opinion
and
looking
through
the
instructions
they
have
that
crazy
colour
syndrome
again
using
blue
yellow
and
red
parts
in
the
internal
build
still
thanks
for
this
sweet
review
with
neat
pics
thumbup
peace
neutral
thanks
for
the
review
alex
i
agree
that
this
is
the
best
set
of
kotcs
sets
although
the
airplane
comes
quite
close
although
im
not
too
fond
of
the
trees
the
cave
is
good
and
the
jungle
cutter
is
brilliant
plenty
of
great
features
and
very
detailed
with
much
of
the
engine
showing
and
a
decent
cockpit
if
thats
the
right
word
the
general
and
the
two
soviets
are
great
too
could
we
have
a
closeup
pic
of
them
please
good
to
see
that
neither
torso
has
exposed
fleshy
skin
like
the
nazis
as
said
though
it
is
quite
a
pricy
set
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
just
over
the
price
of
race
for
the
stolen
treasure
great
set
thanks
again
alex
positive
here
some
closeup
pics
of
the
russian
soldiers
and
the
general
and
i
know
that
you
have
seen
that
i
dont
have
put
the
stickers
on
neutral
ahhhhh
now
this
swamp
vehicle
looks
great
to
me
when
i
first
heard
lego
were
making
it
i
was
worried
that
it
would
be
a
poor
version
however
im
pleased
to
see
that
its
not
even
though
im
not
a
great
fan
of
those
treads
the
trees
dont
really
add
anything
to
the
set
which
is
a
shame
still
the
parts
are
welcome
at
least
the
entrance
is
good
though
it
could
do
with
being
bigger
but
i
guess
we
can
moc
that
i
really
like
the
commie
general
he
looks
like
a
real
bad
megablocks
positive
great
review
again
alex
same
question
in
case
you
didnt
se
it
in
my
reply
to
the
other
set
where
did
you
get
those
new
sets
i
really
love
that
set
its
called
jungle
cutter
the
trees
are
really
cool
and
make
a
great
adition
to
it
imo
that
temple
entrance
or
monument
is
really
cool
those
bionicle
parts
do
make
fantastic
vegetation
i
totally
forgot
about
that
green
frog
thats
cool
those
are
so
cute
5
more
ants
is
great
the
vehicle
look
really
sharp
ah
ah
ah
2
more
commies
yeay
that
officer
is
really
freaky
actually
could
have
been
a
high
rank
under
pol
pots
regime
in
the
s21
yeay
looks
more
asian
than
russian
imo
now
its
time
for
my
grips
same
bloody
rant
about
indy
i
havent
read
the
instructions
before
but
once
again
there
are
so
many
parts
in
crap
colours
that
need
to
be
changed
look
at
all
the
crap
red
and
yellow
in
there
i
will
need
to
look
for
those
parts
before
buying
the
set
like
i
always
do
mod
while
building
on
i
am
really
soimpressed
with
that
indy
line
i
sincerely
hope
it
will
have
a
long
and
healthy
life

whats
that
funky
name
lol
just
making
sure
your
yodaee
awesomeness
is
known
yep
indeed
and
i
have
that
set
if
i
remember
correctly
the
first
line
to
use
it
as
vegetation
is
aqua
raiders
tiger
shark
attack
7773
aha
it
was
in
aquaraiders
it
was
also
the
squids
intestines
or
whatever
lays
inside
his
baggy
head
why
its
just
a
flick
fire
missile
in
a
wrench
ill
use
my
brickarms
rgp
which
is
way
better
oh
yeah
i
forgot
that
ok
so
i
just
finished
reviewing
the
instructions
and
look
at
the
parts
you
need
to
just
change
the
horrendous
colours
damn
its
really
getting
worse
and
worse
ahh
thanks
im
definitely
changing
them
they
may
be
bearers
of
the
red
star
but
they
dont
need
red
lining
inside
their
vehicles
neutral
looks
great
positive
what
a
lovely
set
i
think
i
have
to
put
this
on
my
wishlistjust
for
that
beautiful
woodcutting
tank
thingie
2008
is
gon
na
get
expensive
for
me
positive
the
thing
and
the
set
is
called
jungle
cutter
and
the
reason
the
front
pops
off
is
because
indy
blows
it
up
with
a
bazooka
incase
you
wanted
to
know
thanks
for
the
nice
review
neutral
this
is
the
3rd
review
that
i
had
read
its
very
tempting
to
fly
over
and
get
those
sets
from
there
because
i
may
need
to
wait
for
some
months
before
it
arrived
it
seemed
we
will
have
a
new
small
little
creature
to
add
into
the
ranks
these
red
ants
is
cute
and
of
course
looks
nasty
too
haha
i
love
those
trees
foilage
and
plants
very
very
much
it
can
be
used
for
my
moc
and
is
good
for
any
green
project
related
expansion
i
love
it
about
the
vehicle
i
find
it
abit
wierd
it
seemed
too
big
in
the
setup
hehe
but
still
i
love
this
set
mainly
i
will
get
it
for
the
green
parts
positive
heres
a
review
of
the
second
largest
set
in
the
dragon
masters
subtheme
for
castle
month
dark
dragons
den
figs
the
set
comes
with
3
dragon
knights
two
of
which
have
the
dragon
wings
on
their
helmetssad
thing
is
one
of
my
knights
was
missing
the
left
wing
on
the
helmet
there
are
also
the
definitive
dragon
wiz
the
wizard
or
majisto
if
you
prefertwo
horses
and
a
hawk
try
to
find
him
in
each
picture
the
set
theres
a
large
spot
under
the
mountain
for
the
dragon
to
guard
the
treasure
chest
the
chest
has
2
red
and
green
1x1
circles
in
it
another
gate
in
the
back
along
with
a
door
for
knights
the
right
side
of
the
mountain
has
a
ladder
and
a
removable
rock
face
the
left
side
has
some
stairs
leading
up
to
the
top
i
love
this
tree
design
simple
yet
effective
a
shot
of
the
top
hey
what
are
you
doing
no
throw
him
in
the
dungeon
overall
this
set
when
first
released
in
1993
was
priced
at
43usd
although
that
might
just
be
because
of
the
juniorised
pieces
6
burps
its
a
fun
set
that
provides
excellent
playability
if
you
can
find
it
at
a
2030
price
point
pick
it
up
overall
grade
810

this
is
around
the
time
that
many
consider
the
decline
of
castle
in
which
point
i
somewhat
agree
but
admittedly
it
still
looks
like
a
very
playable
set
and
the
tree
is
very
well
done
thank
you
for
the
review
positive
ah
the
wonderful
dragon
knight
or
was
it
dragon
masters
sets
i
personally
preferred
the
black
knights
but
these
guys
still
had
some
awesome
sets
thanks
for
this
review
this
looks
like
a
neat
little
set
although
those
modern
stairs
look
a
little
out
of
place
that
tree
design
is
indeed
a
neat
one
i
remember
having
that
in
one
dark
forestmen
set
i
got
the
interior
sure
is
roomy
may
i
suggest
for
future
review
you
photograph
the
set
on
a
cleared
table
that
way
you
wont
get
distracted
by
the
clutter
in
the
background
and
can
focus
on
the
main
part
of
the
image
the
set
peace
neutral
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favourite
sets
andor
one
of
the
sets
which
i
wish
i
ownedthe
90s
was
probably
my
favourite
castle
era
tobad
i
was
to
young
to
buy
this
set
when
it
came
out
man
i
wish
i
had
one
of
those
dragons
they
were
one
of
the
best
type
i
reckon
although
all
the
dragons
are
good

yay
go
dragon
masters
i
have
to
agree
with
iamded
i
do
like
the
black
knights
sets
better
for
their
design
betrayal
however
the
dragon
knights
are
just
awesome
cause
they
have
dragons
this
is
a
nice
set
with
some
awesome
minifigs

a
nice

had

a

the

controls

for

the

does
with

i

i
always
liked
the
burps
i
dont
know
why
maybe
because
they
were
dark
grey
and
dark
grey
pieces
seemed
a
bit
hard
to
come
by
at
the
time
i
always
assumed
that
the
dragon
was
sort
of
the
mascot
of
the
dragon
masters
the
wizard
was
there
to
keep
him
under
control
so
he
wouldnt
turn
on
them
i
always
figured
that
the
wizard
was
working
with
the
dragon
master
king
and
they
were
fighting
against
the
royal
knights
the
dudes
with
the
lion
faces
on
their
torsos
or
whatever
they
were
called
i
like
this
set
a
lot
i
think
the
castle
theme
declined
after
the
dragon
masters
and
royal
knights
themes
were
discontinued
the
new
knights
never
really
took
the
cake
its
funny
but
it
seems
to
me
anyways
that
when
the
lego
minifigs
lost
their
regular
smilesmirk
faces
whether
they
were
masked
by
a
beard
or
not
thats
when
lego
began
to
declinea
bit
the
dragon
masters
had
their
vicious
faces
and
all
but
they
still
had
that
smilesmirk
underneath
their
rough
exteriors
the
new
knights
look
a
littleless
confident
positive
i
own
this
set
and
i
think
its
a
great
for
a
smaller
fortress
building
there
is
a
good
selection
of
mini
figs
the
burps
do
detract
somewhat
from
the
set
but
they
do
make
it
feel
as
if
its
in
a
large
cave
the
cloth
flags
that
are
included
are
really
nice
and
mine
have
lasted
a
long
time
positive
the
8291
dirt
bike
comes
from
a
long
line
of
technic
bikes
and
i
think
its
the
best
ever
it
looks
great
and
its
fun
to
ride
around
in
the
house
i
hoped
to
find
a
figure
the
right
size
for
it
but
none
of
mine
would
fit
unlike
a
lot
of
technic
models
it
looks
good
from
all
angles
considering
the
size
of
the
model
it
has
a
complicated
way
of
connecting
the
engine
to
the
wheel
the
rear
shocks
are
just
the
right
stiffness
and
they
have
a
good
amount
of
travel
i
thought
these
shocks
were
new
i
need
to
get
out
more
functions
shocks
two
front
one
stiffer
one
in
the
rear
drivetrain
2
piston
engine
linked
to
the
rear
wheel
via
gears
and
a
chainlink
steering
yes
it
does
stand
retractable
for
the
price
size
and
subject
what
else
could
be
added
1010
parts
considering
that
it
has
three
shocks
and
a
40
chainlinks
its
a
great
set
for
parts
some
hard
to
use
large
parts
are
included
but
they
are
not
overused
the
usage
of
the
green
does
limit
part
usage
somewhat
though
and
ill
be
struggling
to
find
a
use
for
those
wheels
for
anything
other
than
a
motorbike
810
price
at
3999
aud
for
248
parts
it
isnt
the
best
value
set
the
us
price
is
2500
which
is
somewhat
better
it
does
have
some
more
complicated
parts
however
710
looks
lego
seems
to
be
moving
away
from
the
seethough
look
for
technic
sets
and
this
is
a
good
example
of
it
im
not
a
big
fan
of
fairings
but
i
think
they
work
great
in
this
set
as
a
fuel
tank
810
fudge
this
set
was
great
for
me
as
i
have
never
had
a
technic
bike
however
for
those
that
want
this
for
just
parts
or
have
other
bikes
it
could
be
a
hard
sell
the
alternate
model
a
chopper
is
a
complete
rebuild
which
i
didnt
make

its
great
that

have
been
including

is
that
its

tight

it
doesnt
rotate

another

lacking

probably
pass
it
up

a

the

better
balance

studded

studless

the

look

i
´
m
lacking
the
inspiration
to
build
something
different
with
all
those
technic
elements
so
i
´
ll
pass
on
this
one
and
stay
to
classic
bricks
i
have
enough
now
to
be
able
to
build
something
and
i
really
should
soon
or
im
going
to
find
it
hard
to
justify
to
my
wife
buying
the
other
2008

thanks
for
the
review
i
think
i
am
going
to
get
this
set
for
its
many
technic
pieces
i
could
really
use
those
for
a
rig
im
going
to
build
i
didnt
know
you
liked
technic
i
look
forward
to
seeing
this
rig

on
apr

am
said
the
overall
design
is
a
bit
too
studless
for
my
liking
i
think
the
8275
bulldozer
has
a
much
better
balance
of
studded
and
studless
pieces
and
the
wheels
somehow
look
too
small
to
me
i
also
have
something
of
a
backlog
at
the
moment
i
still
need
to
pick
up
that
bulldozer
along
with
the
8421
mobile
crane
on
ebay
id
buy
the
bulldozer
or
mobile
crane
over
this
set
as
i
own
both
already
i
bought
this
i
tend
to
agree
with
the
wheels
but
i
think
it
doesnt
detract
from
the
model

wow
its
a
smarty
set
with
drive
shafts
we
are
everybody
and
technical
junk
the
specs
and
stuff
kind
of
lose
me
but
the

looks
really
cute
in
the
cherry

i
imagine
hes
saving
a
kitten
thanks
for
your
foray
into
technic
land
i
tried
to
fit
him
in
the

as
well
but
he
kept
falling

said
well
its
mostly
from
the
mindstorms
robotics
side
honestly
if
i
bought
this
it
would
be
my
first
technic
set
ever
another
illusion
shattered
interestingly
ive
never
bought
a
mindstorms
set
as
i
have
enough
programming
to
do
for
work
without
doing
it
for
fun
i
have
been
tempted
though
neutral

indiana
jones
temple
of
the
crystal
skull
pieces
929
price
aud14999
out
of
all
the
indy
4
sets
this
one
seems
to
cop
the
most
flak
which
may
account
for
the
fact
that
the
other
3
were
reviewed
weeks
ago
and
this
one
has
sat
unloved
and
alone
waiting
for
someone
to
turn
their
eye
upon
it
or
yknow
buy
it
luckily
im
a
sucker
for
spooky
old
temples
filled
with
devilish
traps
and
hidden
treasures
hissing
fountains
and
overgrown
foliage
creepy
skeletons
and
crumbling
stonework
so
here
it
is
indiana

and
that
sneery
russian
guy
thats
in
the
2
smaller
sets
nothing
new
here
aha
what
have
we
here
two
natives
i
wonder
if
hair
is
a
sign
of
power
in
this
culture
since
one
guy
is
completely
bald
and
the
other
one
has
the
most
extraordinarily
luxurious
black
mullet
somehow
i
doubt
the
movie
will
answer
this
question
back
view
as
you
can
see
the
scalp
tattoos
are
also
popular
in
this
tribe
fashion
conscious
note
in
the
background
the
paws
of
the
fearsome
black
jungle
panther
ie
my
cat
curious
as
to
see
what
the
tribe
was
up
to
also
dont
ask
me
why
these
guys
are
carrying
axes
rather
than
say
spears
and
what
everyones
been
waiting
for
the
skullies
three
of
em
and
a
conquistador
skellie
very
cute
note
the
backs
of
the
crystal
head
have
a
plumesized
hole
or
maybe
thats
just
where
they
injected
the
blue
brainplastic
spooky
i
love
these
skulls
i
wasnt
sold
from
the
initial
pics
but
they
have
a
very
creepy
smile
and
the
head
shape
is
just
weird
with
the
large
eyes
its
kind
of
homer
simpsonesque
and
here
we
have
the
token
vehicle
in
the
set
a
weird
little
tank
thing
with
treads
kind
of
looks
like
a
cross
between
the
amphibious
boat
and
a
minitank
im
sure
theres
a
military
expert
around
here
who
can
tell
us
exactly
what
it
is
supposed
to
be
the
treads
are
nice
but
the
rest
of
it
is
a
bit
thrown
together
you
can
tell
they
wanted
to
keep
the
dark
green
colour
scheme
but
the
budget
only
allowed
them
5
parts
to
do
so
all
in
all
a
mixed
bag
with
the
figs
4
repeats
from
the
cheaper
sets
which
means
we
have
one
new
native
figure
and
the
crystal
skullies
there
are
heaps
of
the
oldskool
skele
heads
scattered
around
the
sets
so
those
that
prefer
can
replace
the
skullies
with
ordinary
skellies
bizarrely
the
top
of
the
box
which
has
the
line
of
11
figs
pic
you
know
what
i
mean
doesnt
have
names

the
official

which
is
pretty

i
know
some
people
dont
like
these
but
they
were
such
a
staple
of
castle

for
so
many
years
that
i
dont
consider
them
a
juniorised
piece
at
all
this
one
recycled
from
the
05
police
hq
and
06
hospital
is
much
better
in
design
than
the
king
leos
castle
one
as
the
different
heights
and
asymmetry
make
it
look
much
more
like
a
natural
piece
of
ground
perfect
for
mocs
and
its
dark
tan
how
could
anyone
not
love
such
a
huge
slab
of
dark

this
love
doesnt
extend
to

in

its

im
of
two
minds
about
this
i
kind
of
prefer
the
palette
to
be
a
bit
subtler
but
i
can
see
that
a
playset
designed
for
kids
isnt
going
to
sell
bucketloads
all
tastefully
done
in
shades
of
tan
with
lashings
of
darkgreen
foliage
theres
a
huge
amount
of
dark
red
in
this
set
which
is
always
a
welcome
colour
but
im
not
convinced
it
quite
works
with
the
2
shades
of
tan
on
offer
here
on
the
plus
side
theres
also
a
huge
amount
of
dark
tan
in
ordinary
2x2
bricks
tiles
plates
and
1x1
and
1x2x3
slopes
which
is
great
for
anyone
wanting
to
stock
up
lets
take
a
closer
look
ill
do
this
roughly
in
order
of
the
build
itself
a
the
big
scary
face
this
is
a
simple
fun
build
and
very
effective
at
projecting
menace
at
the
temple
entrance
it
actually
detaches
very
easily
from
the
temple
as
pictured
on
the
box
art
to
allow
easier
access
to
the
inside
the
eyes
are
flickfire
missiles
with
scary
faces
hair
conveniently
providing
ammo
refills
should
you
run
out
all
in

from
me
b
the
back
spin
the
skelly
head
and
stone
steps
appear
we
havent
seen
this
feature
in
a
while
nice
to
get
these
pieces
in
dark
bley
a
conquistador
hides
under
the
stairs
this
is
a
bit
useless
as
the
stairs
cant
fully
extend
while
hes
there
moving
right
a
trapdoor
what
could
possibly
be
behind
it
answer
not
much
really
a
little
red
stair
i
really
like
these
2
stickers
though
very
intricate
the
staircase
leads
to
what
i
like
to
think
of
as
the
crystal
skull
transmogrification
chamber
now
i
know
nothing
about
the
movie
except
that
its
supposed
to
be
have
a
kind
of
50s
bmovie
plot
rumoured
to
feature
look
away
spoilerhaters
aliens
these
weird
creepy
gold
chairs
look
made
from
the
bones
of
aliens
if
you
ask
me
with
their
strange
vertebrae
and
silver
claws
it
wouldnt
surprise
me
if
bringing
these
aliens
back
to
life
was
part
of
the
plot
of
the
movie
hence
the
crystal
skull
i
guess
well
find
out
may
22
in
any
case
transforming
aliens
clearly
like
a
disco
whirl
as
when
you
pull
the
handle
the
whole
of
this
assembly
spins
giddily
around
a
very
clever
and
simple
trick
its
basically
just
a
wheel
under
the
platform
but
the
effect
is
great
also
under
here
is
a
bottomless
pit
stickered
i
would
very
much
expect
a
villian
to
be
thrown
down
it
at
some
point
so
do
you
come
here
often
i
dont
know
who
designed
this
club
these
chairs
are
really
uncomfortable
nb
i
am
really
really
over
those
pearl
gold
1x2
roof
corner
slopes
which
started
popping
up
in
the
2006
castle
range
infected
exoforce
and
have
now
spread
here
can
we
please
have
these
in
a
different
colour
or
a
different
pearl
gold
piece
pretty
please
c
left
tower
looking
from
the
front
a
small
tower
with
a
trans
clear
gem
d
right
tower
waterfall
with
booby
trap
i
like
the
sticker
its
very
cartoony
which
fits
with
the
set
somehow
when
you
turn
the
wheel
flick
fire
missiles
spray
out
and
hit
whoever
is
on
the
stairs
both
towers
have
a
trap
where
if
you
move
the
skull
another
one
pops
out
from
the
dragon
mouth
e
central
turret
thing
this
thing
is
kind
of
annoying
and
doesnt
really
sit
or
work
well
its
kind
of
like
a
laser
beam
sending
messages
to
space
i
guess
as
the
central
dome
rises
the
two
plates
peel
away
i
find
it
is
a
little
bit
tight
to
work
smoothly
and
the
two
plates
doesnt
really
sit
well
together
at
the
top
maybe
i
just
need
to
rebuild
it
im
sure
this
will
also
be
explained
in
the
movie
f
final
trap
the
stair
that
isnt
there
the
final
trap
is
at
the
front
as
indy
goes
down
the
staircase
you
can
push
the
red
heads
and
all
the
1x8
bley
bricks
come
tumbling
down
simple
and
works
well
g
alternate
view
heres
how
it
looks
as
pictured
on
the
box
with
the
head
removed
as
you
can
see
this
allows
better
access
to
the
centre
of
the
temple
as
you
can
see
sadly
there
is
nothing
actually
interesting
there
except
a
staircase
to
the
turret
and
2
dark
tan
slopes
which
are
just
stuck
there
and
look
a
little
out
of
place
i
mean
come
on
everything
else
has
a
splash
of
dark
red
and
gold
your
destination
nowhere
part
4
in
conclusion
so
after
all
those
endless
pics
what
about
the
set
itself
consas
a
playset
7627
doesnt
quite
make
sense
admittedly
the
traps
that
are
there
are
welldesigned
and
unobtrusive
on
the
other
hand
theres
a
great
big
whopping
entrance
at
the
front
but
i
wasnt
sure
if
the
figs
are
supposed
to
sneak
in
through
the
backdoor
and
go
up
the
spiral
staircase
and
past
the
waterfall
as
shown
in
the
box
art
or
if
they
were
meant
to
end
up
in
the
golden
skull
room
the
middle
area
doesnt
really
connect
with
anything
nor
does
the
giant
space
turret
it
may
be
that
some
of
these
questions
are
answered
in
the
film
but
whereas
with
7624
7625
and
7626
i
could
at
least
picture
a
story
myself
eg
with
river
chase
is
fairly
obvious
whats
happening
a
chase
down
a
river
with
a
croc
and
a
communist
staking
them
out
the
temple
set
is
a
little
all
over
the
place
the
design
feels
a
little
off
to
me
not
really
bad
but
not
really
great
either
pros
on
the
plus
side
the
natives
and
crystal
skulls
themselves
are
great
at
900
pieces
this
is
also
a
great
parts
pack
for
dark
tan
dark
red
plant
pieces
gold
oddments
etc
i
especially
love
the
baseplate
in
that
shade
i
like
the
overall
shape
of
the
temple
a
big
staircase
with
secret
nooks
and
crannies
the
build
is
reasonably
interesting
and
there
are
some
clever
tricks
with
the
traps
but
upon
reflection
i
shouldnt
have
to
sell
this
set
it
should
be
able
to
sell
itself
as
i
said
before
im
a
huge
fan
of
dark
mysterious
old
temples
so
for
that
i
have
to
give
it
some
love
it
reminds
me
of
the
big
old
adventurers
sets
and
the
whiff
of
nostalgia
is
itself
a
powerful
intoxicant
however
for
the
price
lego
is
selling
it
in
australia
europe
canada
i
couldnt
recommend
it
as
a
mustbuy
for
full
price
when
the
smaller
sets
in
this
series
are
themselves
so
good
review
done
woo

oh

my

so
is
it
pearl
silver
as
opposed
to
metallic
silver
that
sure
is
an
odd
little
vehicle
the
engine
looks
nice
enough
and
the
rubber
treads
are
always
good
to
have
but
other
than
that
it
really
just
looks

and
great

thanks
hmmmmm
i
would
actually
like
one
of
these
now
where
before
i
was
unsure
neutral
thanks
for
the
great
review
sveltecorps
ive
been
wanting
to
see
this
set
in
detail
since
it
debuted
at
the
conventions
i
have
to
say
that
on
the
one
hand
i
agree
that
the
minifigures
the
crystal
skulls
and
the
colors
are
great
i
even
like
the
waterfall
but
on
the
other
i
kind
of
think
that
the
set
itself
is
a
disappointment
it
looks
like
they
tried
to
accommodate
design
and
playability
needs
but
really
didnt
come
through
on
either
so
as
you
pointed
out
the
mid
section
doesnt
really
fit
in
with
the
other
parts
and
the
trap
sequence
doesnt
really
flow
either
but
perhaps
your
right
and
all
will
be
answered
in
the
film
i
was
surprised
at
just
how
empty
the
temple
looked
in
the
photo
taken
from
above
they
really
should
have
gone
the
extra
mile
and
made
the
temple
look
more
like
a
temple
and
not
worry
so
much
about
the
action
features
eh
but
so
it
goes
but
i
too
am
a
sucker
for
tombs
and
temples
so
i
wont
be
able
to
pass
it
up
archaeology
on
negative
thanks
for
the
reveiw
it
was
a
enjoyable
and
good
one
i
really
like
this
set
too
bad
its
beyond
my
price
range
i
guess
ill
just
get
the
smaler
set
what
suprised
me
is
that
there
is
no
giant
ants
im
guessing
you
live
in
aus
where
did
you
get
this
set
from
neutral

but
my

anyways
great
review
as
i
have
the
set
built
its
a
really
fantastic
set
the
waterfall
is
a
reall
cool
sticker
and
the
flick
fire
missiles
are
quite
interesting
another
point
of
interest
there
are
seven
of
the
new
flick
fire
missiles
overall
if
anyone
cares

nice
review

your

i
know
that
alex54
had
already
reviewed
this
set
beforehand
but
i
wanted
to
give
my
2
cents
it
is
really
more
like
150
on
this
set
i
bought
from
toys
r
us
on
friday
guess
what
the
price
had
not
been
increased
by
a
dollar
like
all
other
sets
this
is
my
first
review
of
a
set
ever
dont
be
too
mean
1
box
it
captures
the
potential
i
dont
know
how
the
scene
plays
out
for
now
action
of
the
scene
nicely
and
is
very
pleasing
good
job
tlc
on
the
back
it
shows
some
of
the
play
features
of
the
set
and
a
net
little
comic
indiana
jones
seems
to
be
surprisingly
calm
considering
that
he
is
about
to
be
captured
under
a
net
and
attacked
by
a
snake
the
thing
he
fears
most
1a
comic
not
much
to
say
on
this
1b
screw
up
at
the
top
of
the
box
both
russian
guards
have
the
same
grining
face
in
the
set
one
has
the
generic
bad
guy
face
from

up

yoda
said
every
for
of
rambling
imaginable
about
this
accursed
item
i
have
nothing
to
say
meh
3
minifigs
the
only
thing
that
has
not
really
been
discussed
about
the
figs
that
you
get
in
this
set
is
that
marion
has
a
slightly
new
torso
4
parts
of
interest
when
i
opened
up
the
baggies
these
were
the
components
that
grabbed
my
attention
a
dark
green
alligator
a
net
piece
that
i
know
has
appeared
in
sets
before
hand
i
needed
it
for
a
moc
i
am
working
on
some
raft
part
that
is
probably
very
old
a
ladder
with
two
pairs
of
hindges
and
a
dark
brown
version
of
this
part
4
build
amphibious
vehicle
this
i
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
builds
of
the
new
line
but
that
is
just
my
opinion
you
start
of
with
some
thing
very
simple
by
the
end
of
the
next
page
it
starts
to
bulk
up
more
detail
beginning
to
look
like
a
car
4a
build
rear
attachment
bulk
it
up
and
add
taillights
done
slap
it
on
to
the
main
vehicle
4b
build
front
attachment
i
am
running
out
of
things
to
say
bulk
it
up
add
some
detail
add
a
gun
and
headlights
and
attach
to
the
rest
to
get
the
completed
vehicle
add
stickers
i
honestly
think
that
the
amphibious
vehicle
looks
much
better
with
the
stickers
than
without
5
build
boat
this
build
goes
by
rather
quickly
and
adds
to
the
playability
of
the
final
set
base
apply
clamps
add
more
to
engine
build
more
detail
and
a
gun
base
finished
boat
plus
stickers
i
love
how
lego
slips
in
the
product
number
into
their
stickers
6
build
tree
fort
this
is
the
weakest
part
of
the
whole
set
but
i
find
my
self
liking
it
more
and
more
for
some
odd
and
inexplicable
reason
that
tan
6x6
will
most
likely
see
use
in
a
pirate
themed
vinigete
soon
not
mine
install
netlauncher
you
spend
the
next
two
pages
building
this
and
putting
it
on
a
tree
branch
that
is
an
ugly
mix
of
brown
dark
brown
and
frown
our
commie
friend
seems
to
like
coffee
a
lot
second
branch
3rd
a
wee
bit
to
much
on
the
coffee
there
dont
you
think
final
step
the
only
redeeming
value
of
this
section
is
how
well
the
net
launcher
works
fantastically
the
rest
is
just
utter
fail
7
spare
parts
very
little
in
terms
of
what
is
left
over
finished
set
all
in
all
this
set
is
a
fine
build
and
an
excellent
parts
pack
for
dark
green
components
i
recommend
this
set
strongly
despite
its
few
weaknesses
positive
great
review
thanks
as
i
thought
amazon
did
send
out
my
preordered
sets
not
until
yesterday
evening
so
i
should
receive
them
hopefully
on
monday
or
tuesday
cant
wait
for
them
btw
i
wonder
whats
up
with
all
these
sticker
leftovers
in
the
indy
setsthis
hasnt
been
the
case
in
any
other
set
with
stickers

i
brought
this
set
a
few
days
ago
and
agree
with
everything
you
say
i
would
have
never
noticed
that
the
boat
sticker
is
the
set
number
unless
you
pointed
it
out
glad
to
see
that
one
set
of
fuel
can
stickers
was
extra
i
spent
ages
looking
for

place
to
put
them

review
btw
neutral
nice
review
although
you
need
to
use
the
macro
settingaka
the
flower
setting
for
better
pics
are
you
using
a
digital
camera
you
really
need
macro
the
idea
is
turn
it
on
and
hold
down
on
the
take
picture
button
halfway
until
the
pic
focuses
then
press
it
down
all
the
way
to
take

glad
this
one
also
comes
with

wanted

very
nice

thank
you

taking
help
pm

wilhelm

very
thorough
the

are

blurry

i
made
a
tutorial
here
for
amateur

tips
i
also
edited
your
first
post
to
include
a
link
to
alexs
review
great
job
neutral
very
good
for
a
first
review
i
bought
this
set
and
jungle
duel
at
target
the
other
day
i
was
going
to
wait
and
buy
them
when
i
go
to
downtown
disney
this
summer
but
how
could
i
pass
up
saving
four
bucks
that
i
can
spend
on
storeexclusives
and
i
have
to
say
i
absolutely
love
them
the
amphibious
vehicle
dont
they
call
it
a
duck
in
the
movie
is
definitely
my
favorite
lego
vehicle
ive
ever
built
everything
about
it
is
wonderful
the
size
the
colour
scheme
and
its
accurate
to
the
one
in
the
movie
and
irina
spalkos
hair
is
to
die
for
on
a
side
note
i
dont
get
why
they
made
marions
arms
white
in
the
set
the
shirt
underneath
her
vest
in
the
movie
is
obviously
blue
i
switched
the
arms
out
for
light
blue
ones
and
it
looks
a
lot
better
and
it
makes
marions
eyes
look
great

positive
while
i
truely
fell
in
love
one
more
time
with
the
older
lego
city
sets
i
thought
why
not
make
a
review
of
one
of
the
in
my
opinion
greatest
city
sets
of
all
time
lets
not
talk
too
much
here
we
go

unknown
release
year
1988
starting
with
the
beautiful
old
legoland
box
front
back
with
some
cool
alternative
models
inside
we
continue
with
the
great
minifigs
which
are
not
less
than
13
i
dont
think
there
is
any
city
set
with
more
figures
is
there
civilians
race
crew
assistant
personnel
drivers
all
heres
a
overview
of
the
whole
set
the
rescue
rig
dont
exactly
know
how
to
call
it
with
trailer
the
score
board
traffic
lights
which
would
be
one
of
the
details
i
love
the
most
about
this
set
the
next
sweet
detail
the
camera
cameraman
of
course
we
have
a
doc
if
there
is
some
kind
of
accident
the
pit
stop
boxes
i
love
the
small
toolholder
with
the
axle
and
wheel
behind
it
the
control
room
high
above
the
racetrack
ready
to
go
that
was
it
all
in
allall
i
can
say
is
if
you
see
this
set
anywhere
on
ebay
ore
somewhere
else
get
it
positive
what
a
fantastic
set
im
overwelmed
with
feelings
of
nostalgia
by
seeing
this
review
the
playability
factor
of
this
set
is
as
high
as
it
can
be

awesome
review
neutral
metalandi
thanks
for
this
wonderful
lovely
review
i
enjoyed
myself
very
much
when
i
am
looking
through
at
the
lovely
pictures
i
must
admit
this
is
what
i
called
a
real
classic
race
prix
i
miss
those
cute
sweet
little
race
cars
which
is
able
to
contain
a
minifig
furthermore
this
set
offers
4
race
cars
and
13
minifigures
in
addition
if
town
collectors
remember
the
car
number
tiles
are
printed
instead
of
using
stickers
this
is
the
other
set
i
owned
which
holds
the
similarity

a
really
classic

wonderful

i
really

would

with
showing
some
great
alternative

back
of
the
boxes
just
imagine
on
neutral
hello
all
i
dont
believe
there
has
been
a
review
of
this
set
yet
so
i
wanted
to
take
this
opportunity
up
for
review
today
is
8160
cruncher
block
and
racer
x
as
part
of
batbrick
and
iamded
reviews
here
is
the
box
i
have
to
say
i
love
the
art
on
it
its
very
colourful
and
makes
the
truck
look
a
lot
less
crap
than
it
does
on
the
box
plus
you
have
to
love
the
missile
launching
action
bit
right
am
i
right
why
are
you
all
staring
at
me
and
here
is
the
back
pretty
generic
but
shows
some
nice
details
and
so
forth
oh
dear
in
turning
around
the
box
have
i
killed
myself
and
iamded
okey
dokey
up
first
is
the
best
part
of
the
entire
set
the
minifigs
racer
x
is
wonderful
though
coming
with
a
boring
bruce
wayne
face
but
it
is
cruncher
block
his
lady
driver
taejo
that
really
shine
look
at
those
awesome
suits
the
cool
faces
taejo
has
a
ripped
shirt
now
up
is
the
first
building
part
of
the
set
with
me
and
iamded
looking
rather
slick
in
xs
car
while
im
not
a
big
fan
of
yellow
it
is
very
nice
and
slopes
in
an
underused
colour
is
better
than
no
slopes
at
all
front
view
the
new
windshields
are
fantastic
while
a
very
cool
car
it
is
rather
silly
of
tlc
to
give
us
the
exact
same
one
we
got
in
the
smaller
set
i
didnt
get
the
smaller
set
with
this
car
so
im
still
happy
but
it
is
a
bad
marketing
move
sorry
iamded
i
know
its
your
birthday
butvroom
now
for
the
second
part
of
the
build
and
my
favourite
the
front
of
the
truck
annoyingly
enough
this
part
opens
up
to
shoot
a
pointless
rubber
projectile
to
do
this
you
open
the
roof
a
nice
detail
btw
and
pull
back
the
mechanism
here
thus
blowing
the
front
part
open
and
launching
itwell
not
far
really
the
wheels
and
covers
are
pretty
cool
and
the
front
is
nicely
designed
the
red
looks
good
and
the
rear
vision
mirrors
are
a
great
touch
and
now
for
the
most
disappointing
part
step
three
the
trailer
note
clicky
joint
piece
not
part
of
set
just
used
to
hold
it
up
thats
right
almost
the
entire
thing
is
open
even
the
filled
in
side
has
holes
id
certainly
be
cared
to
be
back
there
one
bumpy
hill
and
back
you
go
i
didnt
put
the
lame
computer
stickers
on
and
the
control
area
is
pretty
lame
in
general
not
to
mention
taejo
who
is
depicted
on
the
boxart
as
standing
at
the
desk
would
most
likely
just
be
sucked
out
the
back
at
those
speeds
there
are
some
pluses
too
though
like
the
ridiculously
awesome
minifig
paintings
ill
be
using
for
wayne
manor
also
note
the
control
on
crunchers
desk
that
when
turned
turns
the
gun
at
the
bottom
its
an
alright
feature
here
is
an
example
ive
shot
iamded
on
his
birthday
what
its
a
love
ray
havent
you
seen
the
care
bears
and
though
im
not
a
massive
fan
of
stickers
this
is
just
too
cool
the
little
aquarium
is
very
simple
but
very
clever
using
a
printed
piece
between
two
clear
windows
to
create
the
illusion
of
a
tank
it
looks
much
better
in
real
life
trust
me
and
here
is
a
side
view
to
better
explain
now
to
connect
the
two
is
a
good
thing
i
like
the
way
a
simple
technic
piece
assumes
the
job
oh
and
behold
my
hand
the
completed
truck
which
while
a
mixed
bag
still
doesnt
look
too
bad
i
guess
now
the
completed
set
which
despite
its
unbelievable
large
flaws
still
looks
cool
warning
the
kickass
iamded
and
batbrick
figures
do
not
come
with
this
set

all

racer
x
is
beautiful
cruncher
block
and
the
driver
too
and
taejo
has
a
ripped
shirt
damn
design
25
pretty
poor
considering
the
best
part
is
available
in
a
cheaper
set
and
only
the
front
part
of
the
truck
looks
cool
but
still
not
truly
awful
build
35
despite
having
a
bad
trailer
it
was
a
fun
build
and
sometimes
you
need
something
that
doesnt
take
ages
to
make
price
25
overpriced
easily
but
rogue
shadow
is
worse
fun

the
mere
concept
of
such
an
open
truck
kept
me
playing
with
this
baby
for
hours
total
1525
not
as
bad
as
it
would
seem
overall
im
really
glad
i
bought
it
as
the
minifigs
are
fantastic
and
the
paintings
and
fish
tank
are
cool
its
fun
stupid
and
downright
ridiculous
but
while
not
a
great
set
by
any
means
certainly
isnt
as
bad
in
the
brick
as
it
looks
in
photos
until
next
time

on
this

thanks
for
the

everyone
supposed
to

looks
weird

want

not

but
it
is
cruncher
block
his
lady
driver
taejo
that
really
shine
look
at
those
awesome
suits
the
cool
faces
taejo
has
a
ripped
shirt
i
was
originally
skepitcal
about
the
driver
figure
--
i
like
the
head
but
i
was
trying
to
figure
out
why
they
put
in
a
female
minifig
with
no
hairpiece
after
having
seen
the
movie
i
now
understand
why
crunchers
driver
is
a
fairly
manly
looking
woman
and
most
of
the
lego
hairpeices
would
make
the
minifig
look
too
girly
for
the
character
now
that
i
know
why
taejos
shirt
is
ripped
up
i
dont
mind
the
bits
of
fleshie
color
that
are
printed
on
it
but
i
do
wish
they
would
make
some
of
the
new
torsos
a
little
more
headcolour
agnostictheres
no
real
reason
why
cruncher
and
his
driver
couldnt
have
had
ties
that
came
all
the
way
up
to
their
necks
instead
of
having
those
little
wedges
of
flesh
showing
through
loose
collars
yeah
they
are
lowlevel
mafioso
type
scum
but
they
arent
complete
slobs

front
view
the
new
windshields
are
fantastic
they
are
indeed
very
nice
its
the
main
reason
i
started
looking
at
the
speed
racer
sets
in
the
first
place
batbrick
on
may
10 2008 0605
am
said
while
a
very
cool
car
it
is
rather
silly
of
tlc
to
give
us
the
exact
same
one
we
got
in
the
smaller
set
i
didnt
get
the
smaller
set
with
this
car
so
im
still
happy
but
it
is
a
bad
marketing
move
i
think
the
error
they
made
was
in
the
smaller
set
though
in
the
movie
the
only
time
we
see
crunchers
semi
is
when
hes
being
chased
by
racer
x
racer
x
and
taejo
do
end
up
on
the
same
team
for
a
cross
country
rally
race
along
with
speed
of
course
so
i
guess
thats
where
they
were
going
by
putting
those
two
together
in
the
smaller
set
but
it
would
have
been
much
more
interesting
for
them
to
have
made
up
a
set
with
taejo
and
one
of
the
cars
from
the
very
goofy
comic
bookgimmicky
teams
they
are
racing
against
especially
since
one
of
the
teams
that
is
chasing
taejo
specifically
is
a
bunch
of
armywannabee
loonies
--
im
sure
more
people
would
have
loved
some
sort
of
darksand
green
racer
with
one
of
the
ij
soviets
at
the
wheel
than
another
racer
x
to
summarize
two
racer
xs
is
bad
but
it
is
the
smaller
set
that
should
have
been
changed
imho
batbrick
on
may
10 2008 0605
am
said
annoyingly
enough
this
part
opens
up
to
shoot
a
pointless
rubber
projectile
thus
blowing
the
front
part
open
and
launching
itwell
not
far
really
as
much
as
i
normally
dont
like
the
stupid
techic
launcher
thing
and
would
rather
not
see
it
in
a
set
ever
again
although
one
of
these
days
i
will
make
a
giant
multilauncer
rig
out
of
them
just
for
fun
at
least
there
is
a
reason
for
it
to
be
in
this
set
as
crunchers
semi
has
a
missile
launcher
in
the
front
end
of
it
in
the
movie
i
think
youre
supposed
to
lift
the
panel
that
hides
the
missile
before
launching
it
similar
to
the
way
that
panels
slide
out
of
the
way
on
the
semi
cab
to
allow
for
firing
in
the
movie
batbrick
on
may
10 2008 0605
am
said
and
now
for
the
most
disappointing
part
step
three
the
trailer
thats
right
almost
the
entire
thing
is
open
even
the
filled
in
side
has
holes
id
certainly
be
cared
to
be
back
there
one
bumpy
hill
and
back
you
go
im
gon
na
chock
this
up
to
the
standard
lego
philosophy
of
playset
rather
than
model
design
for
a
lot
of
things
the
semi
rig
and
raver
xs
car
are
the
models
the
trailer
is
the
playset
seeing
as
how
the
trailer
is
crunchers
mobile
office
rather
finely
appointed
with
lots
of
paintings
and
his
pirahna
babies
in
their
tank
behind
his
desk
and
the
intent
seems
more
or
less
to
have
a
playest
bit
in
order
for
kids
to
reenact
the
scene
from
the
movie
im
not
going
to
give
them
too
much
grief
over
this
they
tried
to
capture
the
basic
bits
of
the
movie
set
which
we
see
mostly
from
the
inside
during
the
movie
and
translate
it
into
a
playset
type
environment
that
being
said
i
do
wish
the
back
walls
were
more
solid
as
i
see
no
reason
for
there
to
be
gaps
in
the
back
wall
when
the
front
wall
or
the
fourth
wall
as
the
case
may
be
here
is
already
conspicously
absent

i
can
see
why
they
didnt
spend
too
much
time
and
effort
on
it
it
would
have
been
nice
to
have
more
paintings
though
had
the
back

been
more
complete
and
i
like
your
idea
of
how
to
use
them

not
much
given

ive

further
up
this

but
it
probably
only

a
3
at

so
im
not
realy
going
to
quibble
the
point
i
still
think
that
racer
x
should
be
exclusive
to
this
set
and
a
different
car
should
be
in
the
smaller
set
with
taejo

would
have
improved
the
cachet
for
this
set

should

been
about
a

given
the
general
awesomeness
of
the

a

some

at

or
more
of

goons
in

then
maybe
i
could
agree
more
with
the
msrp
on
that
note
if
i
remember
correctly
from
my
visit
to
my
local
tru
yesterday
in
search
of
the
new
ij
sets
since
local
targets
seem
determined
not
to
get
them
in
stock
yet
they
had
this
set
on
sale
for
around
35
along
with
an
offer
for
a
coupon

for
750
towards
the
purchase
of
a

to
the

i
may
be
wrong
on

was
there
so
if
you

the

and
are
interested

may

nice
review
brickbitz
i
actually
think
this
kit
is
really
very
nice
for
the
size
true
you
only
get
three
figures
but
it
seems
thats
a
norm
in
most
batman
sets
besides
everything
else
is
great
the
tumbler
looks
like
an
amazing
build
they
really
nailed
this
tank
of
a
ride
and
the
ice
cream
truck
plus
this
set
does
seem
to
have
some
neat
pieces
in
it
trans
green
popsicles
and
lime
hubcaps
anyone
i
think
this
far
beats
the
rest
of
the
batman
lineup
this
year
which
seems
quite
disapointing
overall

ill
get

up
tomorrow
in
better
light
to
be

there
isnt
a

to
see
most
of
it
is
just
basic
technic

a

i

this

sure
the
figs
are
annoyingly
not

the
ice
cream
truck
is
fantastic
and
the
tumbler
is
a
marvel
of
black
slopes
i
see
now
that
it
is
far
too
huge
though
i
reckon
i
will
either
keep
it
that
way
as
a
mega
tumbler
mod
it
to
become
another
battank
keep
it
as
a
model
tumbler
or
pull
it
apart
and
use
the
bits
to
make
a
tumbler
like
wetwires
awesome
one
love
those
popsicles
though
and
those
wheels
are
very
nice

overall

this

great
the

though
the

the
internal

got
to
be
my
favorite
part

everything
is
good

we
need
is
a

off

anticlimatic

hey
dunamis
think
you
can
get
a

shot

the
face

red

are
topped
with
transgreenishyellow
studs

make
his
face
look
eerily
alive

very
close
to
his

a
nice
little
detail

seems
to
not
show
through

seen

brickbitz
i
love
this
years
mars

though
this
is
the
weakest
set
it
is
still
a
major
improvement
the
mech
is
very
cool
and
well
made

the
commander
is
one
of
my
favourite
alien
figs

the
alien

pretty
good

not

still
like

for
the

brickbitz
that
really
is
a

that
walker
is
fantastic

likely
the
best
part
of
the
set
though
the
alien
craft
does
also
look
neat
and
its
cool
how
it
can
fold
down
into
aa
walker
or
rather
a
sentry
turret
seeing
as
it
cant
really
move

in

really
love

the
moonwalker
is
amazing
and
the
alien

is
really
nice
too
i
might
get
this
someday

my
first
impression
upon
seeing
this
set
was
no
thanks
but
now
im
warming
up
to
it
still
ill
skip
it
if
it
interferes

fund
p
neutral
thanks
for
the
excellent
review
oky
judging
by
this
set
the
line
is
going
to
be
promising
i
really
like
the
figs
and
im
glad
to
see
that
robot
arm
is
actually
a
new
arm
mold
awesome
can
a
minifig
hand
fit
in
the
end
or
just
the
chainsaw
attachment
could
it
fit
an
exoforce
robot
claw
theres
a
lot
of
detail
in
the
torsos
and
i
like
that
the
agents
suit
is
like
a
motocross
uniform
i
love
that
the
snowmobile
has
a
working
tread
copmike
ras
and
i
tried
to
build
a
snowmobile
with
working
treads
but
we
ended
up
using
chainsaw
blades
in
the
end
great
work
oky
positive
thats
a
great
review
for
your
first
one
i
think
the
jet
pack
if
far
to
bulky
it
could
do
with
some
minimising
but
that
's
life
i
assume
that
you
ca
n't
fit
a
standard
hand
in
the
chainsaw
arms
are
the
hole
would
be
to
large
but
would
you
be
so
good
as
to
confirm
this
for
me
overall
i
quite
like
the
jet
ski
and
the
ability
to
lower
the
arms
to
much
does
n't
both
me
how
much
was
it
just
so
i
can
get
an
idea
of
the
price
finally
thanks
for
posting
this
review
so
quickly
neutral
this
is
much
much
much
more
promising
than
the
2008
batman
set
for
1000
the
vehicle
looks
like
someone
took
time
to
design
it
but
the
batman
one
looks
like
lego
dear
lego
where
is
the
quality
for
batman
i
really
like
the
new
cyborg
arm
and
the
propellers
on
that
thing
it
is
a
really
promising
line
although
i
would
get
rid
of
all
those
bionicle
pieces
positive
thanks
for
the
review
im
looking
forward
to
some
of
the
new
parts
and
ideas
in
this
line
the
figures
look
great
the
actual
sets
themselves
dont
really
appeal
though
neutral
huhm
i
like
the
idea
of
the
agentid
but
offcourse
all
they
want
with
that
is
that
you
buy
all
six
sets
but
it
can
be
a
good
idea
for
children
they
wouldnt
think
of
hey
they
get
all
money
only
because
i
have
a
little
card
with
stars
or
something
well
not
to
rant
i
think
its
good
also
can
you
make
that
name
yourself
maybe
set
5
comes
with
a
extra
stickersheed
with
all
letters
that
would
be
nice

very

wan
kenobi
rupee
neutral
thanks
guys
i
really
tried
to
make
it
a
good
first
review
now
to
answer
your
questions
the
robot
arm
can
fit
ef
robot
claws
and
anything
that
a
minifig
can
hold
in
his
hand
or
that
would
fit
into
a
1x1x1
cylinder
so
normal
minifig
hands
are
too
small
to
fit
tlg
is
using
the
robot
claw
idea
for
the
main
villain
of
the
agents
line
do
you
still
want
me
to
try
it
out
and
take
pics
the
price
was
1099
usd
at
the
tru
i
bought
it
at
i
bet
itss
be
a
dollar
less
on
sh
and
im
sorry
but
i
probably
wont
get
any
more
sets
any
time
soon
i
have
to
save
my
money
for
all
the
other
good
set
that
are
to
come
but
if
i
would
get
another
set
it
would
just
be
the
one
with
the
helicopter
and
the
allsilver
car
if
anyone
gets
this
set
can
heshe
please
review
it
thanks
any
other
questions
i
can
answer
for
you

i
´
d
say
this
is
better
than
we
first
thought
the
minifigs
looks
cool
and
the
overall
look
is
ok
and
the
excaustpipe
is
a
new
peace

i
think
agents
on
copmike
positive
i
kind
of
like
the
set
as
said
it
has
a
very
cartoonish
style
to
it
so
im
guessing
the
kids
are
going
to
love
it
and
as
a
parent
ill
love
it
if
the
construction
isnt
to
fragile
ill
probably
be
getting
a
few
for
myself
but
only
as
parts

and
the
excaustpipe
is
a
new
peace
also
i
think
yeah
and
its
all
over
this
years
releases
from
what
ive
seen
so
far
its
found
in
racers
speed
racers
mars
mission
and
exoforce
sets
i
just
wish
that
instead
of
a
2x1
plate
with
an
exhaustpipe
in
each
end
they
would
have
made
it
an
1x1
plate
with
a
single
exhaust
that
would
have
been
a
lot
more
useful
positive
is
there
any
chance
u
could
post

the

love

good
review
thanks
oky
wan
hmm
although
i
really
like
the
villain
not
just
the
new
arm
i
think
the
color
is
very
villanous
as
all
bondvillains
with
class
have
minions
in
uniforms
its
even
possible
to
fill
out
their
numbers
with
exoforce
grunts
of
the
same
color
im
not
that
hot
for
the
agent
himself
his
uniform
nah
it
doesnt
even
look
like
clothes
just
give
the
man
a
suit
or
some
nifty
leather
i
think
ill
try
to
grab
some
sets
from
the
agents
line
just
for
the
new
parts
to
begin
with
mocs
may
follow
who
knows
when
they
are
available

in

havent
seen
them

indiana

further
waiting

why
do
all
of
the

that
we
have
for

have
the
agents
getting
hurt
is
this
a
new
trend
no
its
an
old
trend

its
because
villains
are
cooler

it

people
want

they
are
most
of
the

expensive

the

also
expensive

this

not

the

if
you
couldnt
afford

want
a
mr

anyone
who
did

really

like
many

ill
buy
this
just

quickly
recycle

flame
detail
is
indeed
terrible
the

is
back

hes
flatulent
this
third
batwave
isnt
really
doing
anything
for
me
ill
get
the

set
as
well
for
pretty
much
the
same
reason
although
the
sub
on
that
is
pretty
cool

skip
the
others
maybe

can
make
us

get

be
good

whats
with

even
have

i

hokk

thanks
for
the

this
set
was
poorly
design
when
i
first
heard
of
it
i
think
it
was
like
a
car
with
a
much
better
design
than
this
one
i
think
i
will
get
it
for
the
minifigs
negative

pics
as
promised
extra
part
neutral
in
actuality
i
think
that
this
may
be
my
favorite
batman
set
of
all
time
i
know
i
know
its
a
small
set
with
crappy
tiny
vehicles
so
it
probably
sucks
for
the
fan
who
likes
to
display
sets
but
look
at
the
mocing
side
and
you
see
this
set
has
a
ton
of
potential
new
batman
fig
well
mainly
the
torso
but
it
looks
nice
sleek
and
armored
a
definite
plus
whether
youre
a
mocist
or
batfan
mr
freeze
because
nobody
bought
the
batcave
when
they
should
haveand
by
nobody
i
mean
me
plus
i
love
that
head
cheapest
way
to
amass
the
lightning

the
other
sets
that
have
it
are
lolhueg
well
not
really
but
i
dont
have
50
to
toss
around
on
a
little
skeleton
tower

its
a
great
piece
two
little
blue
gems
i
may
be

were
going

buying
at

more

cheaply
made
the
inclusion

those
odd
pearl
silver
parts

have
been
in
the
exoforce

seem

random

the
terrible
bionicle

its
the

lego

ive
built

ive
immediately
had
the
urge
to
disassemble
it

pretend
i
never
bought
it
really
i
only
got
it
for
mr
freeze
so
i
shouldnt
complain
but
still
its
a
real
step
backwards
the
comparable
catwoman

was
heaps
better

that

is

so
beautiful

the

is

unfortunately
this
seems
pretty
pricy
and
i
hardly
think
ill
be
getting
it
any
time
soon
what
with
my
limited
budget
and
all
still
its

i
love
going
back
through
the
old
agents
thread
just
to
see
how
wrong
we
were
about
these
awesome
sets
i
actually
really
like
the
gate
those
portcullis
pieces
people
may
know
i
always
find
nice
uses
for
and
i
really
really
really
want
that
awesome
sound
brick
the
figs
are
a
bit
disappointing
in
numbers
but
agent
chase
is
very
cool
generic
henchman
are
great
and
spy
clops
is
one
of
my
favourite
minifigs
ever
the
helicopter
is
wonderful
too
i
love
that
it
is
customised
for
spy
clops
to
winch
him
down
the
colours
as
usual
for
these
sets
are
fantastic
the
dark
blue
orange
and
chrome
silver
the
car
is
the
best

love
all
the
functions

ejector
seat
work
though
batbrick
away
positive
thanks
for
the
awesome
review
deinonychus
this
really
is
a
sweet

a
bit
expensive
a
set
for
me
as
i
only
get
the
cheaper
noncastle
sets
which
is
a
shame
because
i
love
that
head
it
would
be
great
for
some
more
cyborg
troops
the
car
is
awesome
i
didnt
expect
it
to
have
that
many
silver
parts
thats
fantastic
heaps
of
play
features
too

mechanism
sounds

must

uploading

new

it
really
helps
me
decide
if
i
want
it
or
not
if
its
a
good
set
imo
then
it
adds
to
the
excitement
of
picking
up
one
myself
this
i
must
say
is
one
of
those
sets
the
only
concern
for
me
like
alot
of
others
is
the
price
i
will
just
have
to
wait
and
see
and
continue
to
look
at
these
photos
deinonychus
has
provided
for
us
so
much
for
thinking
the
agent
line
was
going
to
be
weak
i
wonder
if
the
exoforce
style
code
brick
number
plate
is
a
hint
from
tlc
as
to
what
will
replace
exoforce

just
have

how
much
cash
is
left
over
after
buying
the
new
death
star
in
a
month
or
two
agents
has
to
be
the
biggest
surprise
from
lego
for
ages
without
any
pics
it
sounded
soso
but
theyve
done
a
brilliant
job
with
it
love
those
metallic
coloured
pieces
positive
great
review
thanks
for
sharing
positive
hello
all
eurobricks
members
i
will
present
to
you
a
very
short
review
on
the
recent
castle
battlepacks
this
time
i
will
be
reviewing
skeleton
battlepack
and
i
hope
everyone
of
you
do
enjoy
viewing
it
this
was
a
request
that
put
up
by
hollisbrick
in
the
castle
thread
initally
i
thought
it
was
a
very
simple
set
to
do
a
review
however
for
the
love
of
castle
i
decided
to
whip
this
up
for
every
castle
fan
out
there
this
is
an
image
of
how
the
skeleton
battlepacks
look
like
i
have
bought
12
last
packs
of
these
in
total
so
far
but
none
of
the
crown
battlepacks
yet
there
were
snapped
much
faster
that
i
imagined
do
pardon
me
for
the
poor
lightning
today
is
a
bad
weather
its
hard
to
get
natural
light
the
skeleton
gang
for
a
single
battlepack
like
this
with
an
attractive
reasonable
price
you
obtained
a
series
of
5
skeleton
minifigs
with
tons
and
tons
of
useful
castle
accessories
to
me
its
a
very
very
great
buy
and
its
a
must
to
stock
up
for
my
army
building
some
addons
however
i
was
not
very
satisfied
with
my
skeleton
armies
standards
therefore
i
decided
to
make
some
slight
modifications
with
some
additional
castle
accessories
that
is
stocked
in
my
castle
warehouse
after
the
makeover
ok
this
is
what
i
called
a
real
skeleton
army
this
is
mainly
my
opnion
and
it
have
to
be
aligned
with
my
standards
i
felt
this
improved
battlepack
gives
a
punch
to
the
exisitng
battlepack
the
two
soliders
on
the
right
is
able
to
align
with
the
rest
of
my
castle
chess
sets
armies
while
the
one
on
the
left
it
gives
me
a
great
archer
back
up
with
the
quiver
and
helmet
attached
to
him
the
ones
on
the
center
especially
the
armored
guard
which
equipped
with
the
black
nose
cone
helmet
is
my
fave
it
is
able
to
illustrate
the
elite
among
the
rest
of
the
guards
with
its
armor
and
helmet
which
was
featured
in
my
castle
deep
forest
expansion
moc
promotion
on
in
addition
the
one
which
was
hastly
done
with
a
modify
mace
it
looks
rather
simple
in
time
to
come
i
will
change
it
and
gives
a
better
equipment
and
look
these
are
the
remains
i
can
use
the
axe
for
my
dwarf
in
my
dwarf
mine
defender
in
that
set
there
is
no
weapon
for
my
dwarf
and
i
have
to
get
it
from
other
sets
the
rest
of
the
accessories
makes
a
very
good
stock
up
for
future
upgrading
overall
910
this
is
not
a
playset
it
is
mainly
bought
for
its
abilty
to
mass
recurit
any
armies
and
is
a
main
love
for
all
castle
army
builders
such
as
me
this
set
mainly
have
no
major
faults
and
i
love
it
so
much
although
i
have
done
some
slight
modifciations
but
this
set
is
a
must
for
me
to
buy
more
and
more
meanwhile
i
will
need
to
wait
for
the
next
shipment
hope
everyone
have
enjoying
viewing
this
simple
review
of
mine

no

i
had
bought
it
last
month
i
thought
it
was
so
simple
to
do
a
review
for
this
was
looking
through
the
thread
then
i
realised
there
is
a
request
for
it
it
was
an
unexpected
shipment
that
send
to
singapore
it
came
in
very
limited
quantity
most
of
the
battlepacks
were
snapped
within
a
day
or
two
when
it
arrived
well
i
am
thinking
of
building
something
big
in
the
future
its
just
a
plan
that
i
have
not
decided
yet
for
me
i
always
love
to
see
the
beauty
of
a
big
army
with
different
battalions
forming
a
kingdom
thats
why
i
always
buy
many
many
sets
that
have
figures
that
attracts
me
and
for
this
battlepack
it
served
a
very
good
purpose
for
it
neutral
thanks
for
the
review
it
wasnt
really
a
request
but
more
of
an
imply
to
do
it
anyway
great
review
cant
wait
til
these
come
to
aus
probably
when
the
rest
of
the
castle
comes
out
in
september
though
positive
thanks
for
the
review
i
wanted
to
see
what
was
in
this
set
looks
good
is
it
sold
in

justifiy

this

one
way
to
acquired

without

in

you
will
save
much
more
i
understand
the
concern
of
star

battlepacks
from
your

in
my
country
star
wars
battlepacks
are
priced
much
much
higher
than
the

no
offence
make
this
799
can
too
expensive
to
be
coming
with
only
a
few
figures
20
earns
you
the
same
amount
of
figs
plus
a
catapult
barricade
two
horses
and
a
jousting
divider
are
you
refering
to
these
following
sets
both
these
sets
adds
up
to
1800
cad
and
the
skeleton
pack
have
the
same
price
of
1800
cad
prices
quoted
from
sh
i
understand
that
7009
and
7090
offers
more
pieces
horses
and
same
amount
of
minifigs
compared
to
a
typical
battlepack
imo
i
feel
that
all
3
sets
are
all
army
building
sets
7009
offer
small
catapult
3
minifigs
a
skeleton
white
horse
7090
offer
a
joust
divider
weapon
rack
good
accessories
2
minifigs
a
horse
with
barding
and
a
skeleton
black
horse
these
sets
have
different
purpose
for
me
buying
multiples
of
7009
is
to
build
its
catapult
white
skeleton
calvaries
while
7090
is
to
build
on
crown
calvaries
and
black
skeleton
calvaries
however
battlepacks
have
a
different
agenda
it
offered
some
castle
accessories
that
is
not
available
commonly
for
a
castle
army
builder
like
myself
castle
accessories
are
always
in
demand
the
black
robe
silver
armor
silver
shortaxe
are
not
very
common
castle
accessories
it
can
be
used
as
a
good
stock
up
too
i
am
not
saying
this
battlepack
is
an
one
way
solution
to
solve
everything
thats
why
different
sets
are
released
to
target
on
different
purposes
neutral
whitefang
although
i
realize
that
the
battle
packs
are
great
specifically
for
building
armies
and
castle
accessories
which
is
why
its
such
a
shame
that
i
wont
be
able
to
buy
these
things
while
sdpirates
sets
are
more
for
a
catapult
calvary
whatever
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
with
the
battle
pack
you
get
5
minifigs
with
lots
of
accessories
while
with
the
sets
that
sdpirate
showed
us
you
get
5
minifigs
with
an
okay
amount
of
accessories
3
horses
including
two
skeleton
ones
a
ballista
a
weapons
rack
and
a
jousting
barricade
you
can
not
say
that
the
battle
pack
contains
the
same
amount
of
stuff
that
the
other
two
sets
have
and
therefore
should
be
priced
the
same
it
just
seems
that
lego
is
ripping
off
canadian
army
builders
to
me
if
the
battle
pack
contained
a
small
catapult
or
wall
so
that
it
contained
about
the
same
amount
of
stuff
that
the
other
sets
had
it
would
be
fair
it
seems
stupid
that
you
will
only
get
minifigs
from
one
set
while
you
can
get
about
the
same
amount
of
minifigs
plus
a
bunch
of
other
stuff
from
two
other
equally
priced
sets
that
's
why
to
me
these
battle
packs
are
a
rip
off
because
of
what
they
contain
imho
the
battle
packs
seem
to
be
only
worth
about
10
dollars
neutral
thanks
for
the
review
whitefang
your
additions
look
great
i
like
your
mace
much
better
than
the
use
of
a
small
technic
cog
your
looks
much
sturdier
and
that
helmet
looks
really
great
on
skellie
soldiers
i
never
thought
to
use
that
before

i
can
understand
your
concern
when
pricing
is
concerned
pricing
is
always
a
big
issue
for
us
to
determine
whether
to
buy
or
not
to
buy
a
certain
set
in
a
particular
country
pricing
varies
differently
across
different
countries
such
as
us
europe
canada
australia
and
etc
this
is
something
very
hard
for
us
to
decide
on
we
cant
be
sure
why
tlc
placed
their
pricing
strategies
this
way
well
i
think
we
should
appericate
what
tlc
is
trying
to
do
for
us
by
not
using
price
as
the
only
factor
to
judge
whether
to
buy
this
set
or
not
at
least
i
am
sure
there
are
many
of
us
trying
to
request
for
battlepacks
to
muster
armies
for
their
mocs
armies
collection
and
etc
different
people
have
different
judgements
towards
different
sets
and
different
themes
i
respect
your
opnion
imo
lets
dont
let
price
be
the
only
determined
factor
to
decide
whether
to
purchase
a
particular
set
or
not
instead
consider
an
array
of
factors
that
is
offered
however
i
do
know
that
consumers
like
me
and
you
are
always
affected
by
price

thanks
again
for

you
should
try

back
into
castlemode
there
are
so
many
great
stuffs
waiting
for
you
such
as
dwarf
mine
tower
raid
and
etc
however
i
can
understand
that
the
problem
of
space
is
always
the
key
issue
without
space
it
is
hard
for
us
to
keep
it
on
display
for
bigscale
mocs
or
for
storage
purpose
i
will
be
waiting
for
you
to
get
your
troll
warship
too
hope
one
day
soon
enough
we
will
be
able
to
view
a
castle
moc

i
will
use
these

i
always
feel
that
every
kingdom
needs
a
considerable
amount
of
soldiers
to
defend
their
kingdom
therefore
most
of
the
time
the
amount
of
soldiers
will
dictate
how
strong
that
kingdom
is
in

collection
in
the
future
i
hope
to
build
large
castle
scenes
combined
all
playsets
armies
everything
together
and
developed
a
kingdom
scene
of
course
that
is
just
a
dream
for
now
i
am
still
currently
not
able
to
afford
much
space
and
time
to
do
such
big
scale
project
at
the
moment
meanwhile
for
this
great
castle
theme
i
am
storing
them
at
the
moment
and
take
it
out
when
the
time
is
ripe
one
day
soon
i
hope
i
can
post

or

with

his
jeep
its

sturdy

vehicle
with
fatter

at

for
better

next
is

and
his
unusual

is
from

where
it
is
usually
pink

ought

put

in

as
it
is
a
nice
intermediate

in

it
is
a
small
steamship
the
temple
is
built
on
modular
8x8
green
bricks
which
fit
into
square
holes
in

is

something
worse
happens
¡
chispas
thats
it
im
leaving
this
place
why
me
why
the
verdict
this
is
a
fine
set
a
set
whose
bare
partsprice
ratio
does
not
accurately
reflect
the
intricacy
of
its
design
nor
the
rarity
of
its
parts
i
had
to
buy
replacements
for
some
of
them
and
let
me
tell
you
they
are
pricey
that
green
baseplate
14
the
little
dark
gray
saucepan
near
the
fire
not
available
on
bricklink
at
any
price
the
brown
boat
hull
vhtf
with
this
set
parts
quality
trumps
parts
quantity
and
the
minifigures
are
wonderful
theres
not
a
dud
in
the
bunch
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
very
common
dr
lightning
and
even
he
is
not
bad
when
you
factor
in
the
coherence
of
the
color
scheme
and
the
brilliant
traps
it
is
obvious
that
5986
is
a
classic

great
review
for
a
great
set
man
i
loved
the
adventurers
although
the
new

are
good
they
will
never
match
up

most
of
all
no
stickers
great
review
positive
thanks
for
this
great
review
voltio
i
never
knew
of
this
set
till
now
and
it
really
looks
great
i
never
paid
much
attention
to
those
aztecincan
style
sets
which
i
now
regret
i
love
the
bright
colours
used
here
and
all
the
great
traps
theres
so
many
of
them
which
is
exactly
what
we
can
expect
from
an
old
incan
temple
like
this
one
im
surprised
theres
no
catapult
anyway
the
minifigs
included
are
also
great
and
am
i
right
in
guessing
those
bricks
are
printed
that
would
be
fantastic
as
they
look
amazing
that
boat
hull
is
new
to
me
too
although
i
guess
the
fact
that
its
mainly
in
belville
sets
explains
that
pretty
well
thanks
again
for
the
sweet
review
do
you
have
any
other
jungle
adventurers
sets
you
plan
to
review
peace
positive
great
review
i
saw
the
instructions
of
this
set
but
never
atracted
me
until
now
a
great
set
an
a
excelente
review
positive
thanks
for
reviewing
this
rare
set
since
it
came
out
in
1999
i
have
only
seen
this
set
in
a
toystore
one
single
time
one
single
copy
as
well
it
was
in
the
summer
of
1999
in
belgium
arlon
in
a
store
called
maxi
toys
belgiums
tru
i
think
they
had
the
three
biggest
junglesets
for
sale
there
these
ancient
ruins
the
set
with
the
beautiful
black
boat
and
the
zeppelin
being
into
adventurers
at
that
time
i
had
never
seen
the
entire
jungle
theme
not
even
in
a
leaflet
or
catalog
and
surprised
as
i
was
i
bought
all
three
sets
that
was
one
happy
dutch
boy
in
belgium
surprisingly
the
two
smallest
sets
made
it
in
very
small
quantities
to
my
local
stores
in
holland
except
for
the
pontoon
plane
and
small
raft
which
was
my
very
first
shop
at
home
order
the
spiders
secret
i
bought
off
bl
which
makes
me
the
proud
owner
of
the
entire
jungle
serie
back
to
the
set
this
was
the
first
time
in
a
long
history
of
collecting
lego
that
i
had
a
deformed
piece
an
2x8
red
plate
was
twisted
i
twisted
it
back
and
it
still
serves
its
purpose
i
loved
the
whole
steamidea
in
this
jungle
serie
the
two
boats
both
including
the
one
in
this
set
had
nice
steamengines
and
a
very
cool
mechanic
yours
has
the
wrong
hathair
btw
to
come
along
with
them
the
skeleton
falling
down
on
the
end
of
a
chain
was
the
most
intriguing
part
of
this
set
for
me
it
worked
really
well
and
when
you
were
done
scaring
minifigures
you
could
winch
it
up
again
ready
for
the
next
go
the
only
thing
i
did
not
really
like
about
this
set
was
the
difference
in
wheelsize
on
the
car
front
small
back
large
and
the
way
the
palmtree
consisted
out
of
just
three
parts
all
in
all
a
great
set
that
is
becoming
more
rare
and
expensive
as
we
speakpost
get
it

the
printed
pieces
are
the
real
gems
of
this
set
beyond
them
there
isnt
much
to
this
set
though
the
boat
hull
is
nice
the
model
itself
isnt
all
that
great
the
new
akator
temple
is
definately
a
superior
model
at
least
in
piece
count
but
those
printed
pieces
are
hard
to
resist
steve
i
have
to
agree
too
few
pieces
for
such
a
high
price
but
amazing
figs
too
and
a
nice
baseplate
despite
a
4
palm
tree
you
get
more
palm
tree
leaves
for
mocs
plus
i
think
a
monkey
and
that
sweet
achu
figure
negative
this
set
is
awesome
gr8
positive
i
just
rebuilt
this
entire
set
today
and
the
nostalgia
was
totally
worth
taking
bits
and
pieces
from
a
few
of
my
own
mocs
only
now
did
i
realize
how
rare
some
of
those
pieces
are
and
im
rather
thankful
that
i
have
all
of
the
printed
pieces
and
achu
the
only
pieces
i
am
missing
is
a
transparent
orange
headlight

out
of
4
black
minifigure
hammer
light
gray

it
with
a
dark

the
mechanic

i
still
have
both
the
instructions
and
the
box
and
both
are
in
appalling
conditions
kudos
to
the
pre2000s

wow
good
review
i
used
to
love
this
old
sets
as
i
was
greatly
fascinated
by
inca
and
aztec
cultures
and
the
mayans
technological
marvels
astounded
me
i
was
thrilled
to
death
when
lego
released
little
aztec
figures
so
of
course
i
jsut
had
to
buy
some
your
narration
with
the
sig
fig
was
hilarious
and
the
review
was
all
around
wonderful

of

i
might
buy
a
second
one
of
that
set
and
build
it
in
the
bag
i
just
wan
na
prove
that
it
is
possible
i
bought
4
myself
its
like
having
a
little
beach
fleet
positive
so
i
just
piced
up
a
new
digital
camera
and
i
thought
what
better
way
to
try
it
than
doing
a
review
of
my
newest
set
the
new
7738
coast
guard
helicopter
itsmy
first
review
so
go
easy
on
me
lets
start
off
with
the
small
stuff
first
the
mini
figs
you
get
4
figs
total
two
helicopter
pilots
a
diver
and
a
civilan
to
rescue
the
torsos
are
nothing
new
on
the
pilot
and
diver
same
ones
as
in
the
last
coast
guard
line
but
i
like
the
colors
alot
better
in
this
coast
guard
line
than
the
previous
generation
the
yellow
and
blue
really
work
well
together
and
the
coloring
on
the
badge
looks
great
the
civilian
looks
to
be
just
a
dock
worker
with
an
overall
torso
and
a
beenie
the
diver
has
nice
vented
helmet
and
a
pair
of
flippers
that
suits
his
duty
perfect
next
we
have
an
absolute
work
of
lego
art
the
rescue
raft
the
orange
flaps
can
be
moved
back
for
easy
entry
to
the
raft
as
well
as
the
white
support
beams
with
the
caution
tape
i
put
support
in
perenthaces
cause
they
really
dont
support
anything
just
there
to
fill
in
the
gaps
at
the
top
of
the
raft
is
a
red
locator
beacon
ccommunications
antenna
and
a
cargo
loop
for
lifting
the
raft
lets
move
on
to
the
interior
of
the
raft
not
much
here
but
you
can
see
the
techinc
beam
that
attaches
to
the
top
loopand
to
the
floor
of
the
raft
so
far
this
has
proven
to
be
very
sturdy
and
has
supported
the
full
weight
of
the
raft
quite
well
you
can
also
see
the
white
box
that
holds
the
equipment
of
the
raft
here
you
can
see
the
life
saver
tube
heres
a
shot
with
our
dock
worker
peaking
out
the
side
the
raft
says
max
ocupants
4
but
with
the
storage
box
that
might
be
a
tight
fit
now
lets
move
on
to
the
helicopter
in
my
opinion
this
is
one
of
the
best
helicopters
tlc
has
come
out
with
to
date
i
really
felt
they
captured
the
look
and
proportions
of
a
real
coast
guard
helicopter
it
uses
a
lower
hull
and
tail
section
of
the
new
airliner
and
cargo
airplane
it
really
seems
to
work
well
with
this
application
the
engines
have
good
detail
using
new
cheese
graders
as
vents
as
well
as
the
new
engine
stacks
that
come
in
the
new
speed
racer
sets
the
rotors
also
appear
to
be
new
as
well
lets
move
on
to
the
cockpit
we
have
two
seats
for
our
pilots
with
a
sticker
sheet
for
intruments
on
a
flat
4
wide
plate
theres
also
an
antena
being
used
as
a
flight
stick
another
shot
with
our
pilots
at
the
helm
now
lets
moveon
to
the
high
lihgt
of
this
heavy
lifting
machine
the
med
bay
and
lifting
winch
httpwwwbrickshelicopter020jpg
here
you
can
see
the
winch
arm
at
rest
along
with
the
medical
strechter
the
bad
part
is
that
the
med
strechter
doesnt
include
the
ussually
included
fold
away
wheels
heres
a
shot
with
the
winch
arm
extened
ready
for
rescue
in
the
second
shot
you
can
see
the
drum
that
the
wire
coils
up
in
it
coils
up
via
a
recently
new
power
functions
pull
back
motor
to
operate
just
pull
out
the
winch
cable
hook
on
your
load
and
presse
this
orange
button
on
the
side
the
bad
part
of
the
new
power
functions
winch
is
that
although
its
very
smooth
in
its
operation
its
not
very
strong
it
will
only
lift
the
raft
a
couple
inches
before
it
runs
out
of
torque
it
also
has
a
tendency
to
want
to
pull
the
crane
arm
backin
while
its
lifting
it
doesnt
matter
if
its
a
light
load
or
heavy
load
the
bay
doors
open
on
both
sides
for
easy
postioning
of
the
figures
and
accses
to
the
strechter
here
we
have
our
diver
looking
over
his
rescuee
nice
and
roomy
if
you
dont
mind
a
crane
arm
being
in
your
way
at
3999
and
a
peice
count
of
445
i
felt
this
set
was
a
great
good
considering
what
your
getting
the
raft
construction
is
very
creative
and
is
probbly
the
highlight
of
the
set
by
itself
the
helicopter
is
probbly
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
helicopter
tlc
has
ever
came
out
with
if
you
can
get
over
its
size
in
a
scale
of
one
to
five
price
peice
count
playability
design
overall
5
i
would
have
given
it
a
full
5
out
of
five
but
since
the
winch
cant
pull
the
raft
all
the
way
it
didnt
fell
it
right
even
with
this
minor
flaw
i
still
highly
recomend
this
set
neutral
wow
i
was
skeptical

this

getting

get

can

the
helicopter
is
apart
from
that
it
is
very
very
big
and
that
it
does
not
include
any
interior
a
very
nice
set
the
most
i
like
the
life
raft
becuase
it
is
simply
nevertheless
i
dont
know
if
i
buy
it
probably
not
but
its
very
nice
two
questions
where
can
you
fasten
the
stretcher
on
to
haul
it
up
and
down
is
the
motor

i
was
actually
the
complete
opposite
ever
since
i
saw
the
first
pictures
i
fell
in
love
with
the
whole
line
the
helicopter
looks
to
be
one
of
the
two
best
in
the
line
right
up
with
the
4wd

you
have
something

never

a
little

done
that
good
before
positive
nice
review
the
helicopter
reminds
a
sikorsky
chopperisnt
it
positive
i
could
tell
from
the
pictures
that
a
lot
maybe
all
the
designs
on
the
raft
were
stickers
in
the
whole
set
are
there
any
printed
parts
besides
the
torsos
or
is
it
all
stickers
negative
all
stickers
im
afraid
though
imnot
a
fan
of
stickers
myself
some
sets
like
ferrari
for
example
take
longer
to
put
on
than
building
the
actual
set
this
one
is
not
as
sticker
heavy
as
it
seams
though
and
the
ones
that
areon
there
really
give
the
set
that
extra
touch
printed
would
have
been
preffered
of
course
but
in
this
case
i
didnt
mind

thanks
everyone
for
the
nice
coments
its
nice
to
finaly
have
a
camera
that
can
take
some
decent
photos
makes
doing
reviews
much
more
enjoyable
there
is
no
real
way
to
lift
up
the
stretcher
due
to
the
crane
arm
being
in
the
way
there
really
isnt
any
room
for
any
kind
oflifting
straps
the
set
does
include
a
1x2
plate
with
a
hinge
for
the
diver
to
stand
on
so
at
least
he
can
hold
on
to
someone
the
crane
lifts
them
up
and
then
he
can
put
them
in
the
strechter
thats
my
guess
at
least
as
far
as
the
motor
i
dont
believe
it
uses
bateries
since
you
pull
out
the
motor
and
all
the
button
does
is
recoil
the
winch
line
back
in
i
have
to
say
it
does
a
very
good
job
of
that
and
is
very
smooth
as
long
as
you
dont
have
anything
to
heavy
one
detail
i
forgot
to
meation
is
the
shark
its
nothing
new
just
the
basic
shark
lego
has
had
around
for
nealy
2
decades
but
it
was
a
detail
nothing
less
thank
you
very
much
for
that
information

this
is
a
very
good
review
thank
you
but
i
have
some
questions
about
the
grey
new
parts
in
the
life
raft
are
they
1x1
like
their
counterparts
with
the
clips
or
1x2
and
can
they
be
held
by
a
minifig
by
the

so
these
could
be
very
useful
for
brickbuild

im
looking
forward
to
some

i

hmm
i
think
it
´
s
count
citrus
neutral
im
rather
fond
of
helicopters
and
have
built
many
different
types
this
doesnt
really
remind
me
of
any
particular
model
other
than
perhaps
an
eh
101
merlin
and
even
that
resemblance
is
very
superficial
just
for
the
record
this
is
a
sikorsky
sea
king
and
this
is
a
sikorsky
mh53
a
derivation
of
the
ch53
the
only
resemblance
i
see
with
the
former
is
the
colour
scheme
and
with
the
latter
the
fact
that
its
got
a
fat
rearend
sponsons
and
six
blades
it
doesnt
matter
though
because
i
really
like
it
the
colour
scheme
is
great
the
shape
is
nice
its
got
quite
a
bit
of
detail
and
i
just
have
to
get
my
hands
on
the
cockpit
window
and
those
new
rotor
blades
when
i
first
saw
the
large
aircraft
pieces
a
few
years
ago
i
figured
they
were
very
much
singleuse
parts
but
the
tail
end
doesnt
look
too
bad
pretty
clever
i
like
the
raft
too
it
really
does
look
like
the
real
deal
that
the
helicopter
cant
lift
it
really
isnt
an
issue
because
in
real
life
they
wouldnt
lift
the
raft
either
theyd
use
the
rescue
hoist
to
lift
the
occupants
of
the
raft
into
the
helicopter
one
by
one
or
perhaps
in
pairs
imagine
a
storm
with
a
helicopter
hovering
over
tall
waves
with
a
big
fat
raft
strung
from
a
cable
underneath
it
the
raft
would
catch
a
lot
of
wind
and
flop
around
quite
a
bit
causing
it
to
loose
all
its
occupants
and
also
yanking
the
helicopter
around
possibly
causing
the
pilot
to
loose
control
and
crash
bad
idea

thanks
for

your
pics
are
a
bit
blurry

if
you
want
them
a
bit
better
you
should
sit
your
camera
on
a
hard
surface
so
you
dont
wobble
it
as
much
i
love
the
tumbler
though
it
is
quite
massive
but
either
way
ill
be
glad
to
get
it
the
figs
in
my
opinion
are
really
bad
joker
should
atleast
have
a
different

oh
well
its
worth
it

are

a
tip
i
learned
in
photoclass
is
to
take
a
breath
in
and
hold
it
while
pushing
the
shutter
so
you
dont
accidentally
move
while
breathing

thought
it
was
silly

it
does
work

the
pictures
are
blurry
but
nonetheless
just
wanted
to
say
that
out
of
all
my
lego
sets
this
one
7888
is
the
best
the
tumbles
is
so
cool
once
it
is
put
together
those
four
huge
wheels
at
the
back
make
it
quite
unique
if
you
do
not
have
this
set
i
highly
recomend
it
please
dont
reply
to
year
old
topics
it
will
get
the
admins
annoyed
and
thats
not
good
i
see
that
your

so
welcome
to

i
recommend
not
doing
it

thank
you
for
clearing
that
up
i
felt
that
it
was
ok
to
review
an
old
topic
as
stated
rather
than
just
go
ahead
and
start
a
new
one
a
shame
that
this
set
as
all
other
batman
sets
have
gone
up
so
highly
in
value
but
still
all
things
considering
general
after
market
lego
price
hikes
it
is
still
a
wonderfull
set
even
with
its
market
value
today
that
is
if
you
can
ignore
the
mrsp
positive
i
too
thought
the
jokers
van
was
the
pleasant
surprise
of
this
set
the
tumbler
looks
good
yes
until
you
see
it
in

its
grossly
oversized
they
should
have
made
it
closer
to
a

i

it

youre

the

that
apparently
are
being

not
all
magnets
altogether
as
you
noted
the

still
have

they

be
permanently

that

me

books
movies

just
came
a

i
can

people
complaining
about
how
to
make
the
alternative

yes

just
stop
using
them

tlc

sacrificing

building
with
bricks

the
main
attraction
of
lego
not
just
some
cool
crafts
to
play
around
with
others
can
do
this
too

maybe
better
than
tlc

of

ever

for
some
recent
models
they
were
designed
but
not
published
how
do
i
know
this
the
creator
said
so
hmm
i
think
my
parents
probably
contributed
to
that
when
i
was
younger
anyway
now
because
of
the
glorius
creation
of
the
internet
we
can
share
the
instructions
or
make
them

ive
heard
that
the
alien

stalker
was
called
the

somewhere
ah
yes
here
httpnewslugnetcn51449tiva
ah
thats
interesting
i
wonder
why
they
do
that
positive
a
great
and
very
creative
work
i
especially
like
the
speed
boat
and
the
smaller
car
just
splendid
positive
brilliant
a
huge
amount
of
creativity
there
to
do
what
you
did
with
such
limited
piece
counts
is
exceptional
theyre
at
least
as
good
as
most
of
the
alternate
models
lego
show
on

positive
harley
mistah
j
i
want
to
preface
my
review
by
admitting
that
i
'm
an
unrepentant
harley
quinn
fanboy
i
've
been
enamored
with
the
character
since
she
first
appeared
in
batman
the
animated
series
back
in
the
90
's
and
i
've
since
followed
her
misadventures
through
her
introduction
into
the
regular
batman
series
during
no
man
's
land
into
her
own
series
and
even
on
the
shortlived
and
notsogood
birds
of
prey
tv
show
so
please
excuse
any
proharley
bias
so
down
to
business
the
267
piece
set
retails
for
30
us
35
at
toys
r
us
and
builds
up
very
fast
and
easy
it
consists
of
batman
's
bat
cycle
harley
's
hammer
truck
and
brand
new
batman
and
harley
quinn
minifigs
there
is
also
no
lack
of
weapons
in
addition
to
the
usual
bag
of
bataccessories
and
guns
the
set
also
comes
with
a
pair
of
gray
revolvers
batman
in
this
set
has
the
new
``
armor
''
torso
print
and
the
hips
are
the
same
color
as
the
legs
hinting
that
this
is
supposed
to
represent
the
movie
style
batsuits
more
so
then
the
traditional
comic
book
``
underwear
over
tights
''
look
harley
quinn
is
a
very
cool
looking
minifig
and
i
have
n't
grinned
so
much
at
a
new
batman
character
figure
since
my
first
batman
minifig
a
couple
years
ago
the
figure
is
very
true
to
the
character
and
the
torso
has
been
accented
with
a
few
shape
lines
to
try
and
distinguish
her
as
a
female
despite
the
boxy
body
harley
's
jester
cap
is
an
interesting
new
piece
it
seems
to
me
at
least
to
be
made
of
a
slightly
different
grade
of
plastic
then
we
're
used
to
it
's
molded
in
red
and
painted
with
black
and
white
and
it
comes
packed
in
its
own
separate
little
baggie
i
expect
that
this
piece
may
have
cost
lego
a
little
more
then
usual
to
produce
harley
also
has
a
buildable
accessory
a
giant
mallet
sure
she
ca
n't
stand
up
all
that
well
unless
it
's
held
in
specific
ways
but
it
's
neat
and
most
importantly
it
's
funny
it
's
especially
fun
for
smacking
the
everloving
crap
out
of
other
minifigs
with
the
bat
cycle
is
in
bag
number
one
and
is
a
very
fast
build
this
is
n't
some
little
japanese
sport
bike
like
nightwing
's
cycle
this
monster
is
almost
a
car
and
seems
to
pack
just
the
right
amount
of
intimidation
for
the
caped
crusader
to
exploit
thanks
to
the
thick
tires
two
in
front
one
in
back
it
stands
up
just
fine
on
its
own
and
rolls
very
well
the
huge
exhaust
pipes
are
a
nice
touch
and
give
the
thing
a
look
of
engine
power
the
only
real
flaw
is
the
inclusion
of
the
flickfire
missiles
mounted
on
the
sides
but
as
with
any
lego
model
they
can
be
easily
left
out
without
hurting
the
look
of
the
vehicle
the
hammer
truck
is
the
bulk
of
this
set
and
a
lot
more
fun
then
it
looks
of
the
monster
truck
persuasion
the
vehicle
is
designed
and
built
with
a
surprising
level
of
solidity
the
axle
mounts
are
particularly
impressive
the
big
wheels
and
tires
just
beg
you
to
drive
this
thing
right
over
the
bat
cycle
or
batman
the
megamallet
gimmick
is
also
a
surprise
not
so
much
for
its
technical
complexity
there
is
n't
any
really
but
for
the
fact
that
once
you
start
turning
the
knob
at
the
rear
to
swing
the
mallet
back
and
forth
it
's
really
a
lot
of
fun
there
are
some
low
points
to
the
truck
design
again
the
flickfire
missiles
are
tacked
on
and
there
's
a
cargo
cratebed
set
into
the
back
for
harley
's
loot
of
jewels
the
crate
would
have
looked
a
lot
better
molded
in
black
in
brown
it
breaks
up
the
look
of
the
truck
a
little
speaking
of
which
the
look
of
the
truck
is
very
pleasing
the
red
and
black
harley
quinn
color
scheme
works
really
well
on
the
vehicle
there
are
a
few
stickers
here
and
unfortunately
the
diamond
patterned
ones
are
applied
over
multiple
bricks
the
rest
however
are
great
not
only
does
she
have
an
``
i
love
joker
''
bumper
sticker
but
she
has
a
joker
playing
card
taped
to
her
dash
i
guess
serving
as
a
picture
of
her
beloved
puddin
'
there
is
also
a
sticker
for
activation
of
the
hammer
which
boldly
shouts
hit
me
this
is
a
fun
set
a
neat
new
batman
vehicle
and
a
big
truck
with
lots
of
playability
the
harley
minifig
is
a
musthave
for
any
batfan
and
if
you
only
get
one
of
the
batman
sets
this
year
i
'd
recommend
this
one
the
price
versus
piececount
on
this
set
is
a
little
bit
of
a
deterrent
though
this
might
not
be
the
best
set
for
collectors
on
a
budget
or
people
looking
for
something
completely
new
and
innovative
but
anyone
buying
this
for
a
child
can
rest
assured
that
the
kid
will
get
your
money
's
worth
out
of
the
set
through
its
play
value
when
added
together
and
averaged
out
the
pros
and
cons
of
this
set
combine
to
give
it
a
score
of
out
of
5

if

is

hi

i
was

had
the
munchies
and
was
looking

something
to

along

stopped
caring

decided
to
browse
the

what
they
had

it
´
s
always

to

i
like
the
penguin

s
sub
from
the
batcave
more
just
because
they
did
a
fine
job
on
resembling
a
penguin
without
using
a

robins

looks
fairly
nice

the
most

very

thanks
for
the

didnt

was
much
at

i
really
love
it
another
cheaper
robin

penguin
is
great

those
nifty
mini
penguins

are

is
even
better

first

was
annoyed
at
getting
two
subs
but
now
i
realise
it
means
i
can
have
a
fleet
of
them
ill
be
sure
to
mod
over
those
cannons
though
but
the
details
are
very
slick

thanks
for
the
great
review
brickadier
general
the
sub
looks
very
nice
and
i
like
the
idea
of
a
raising
periscope
did
the
batcave
sub
have
that
feature
and
the
details
on
the
sub
look
very
nice
the
inclusion
of
the
penguin
robin
and
two
of
those
great
brickbuilt
penguins
really
confirms
that
ill
be
getting
this
considering
that
i
didnt
purchase
the
batcave
however
i
am
rather
dissapointed
that
this
set
is
so
similar
to
the
vehicles
of
penguin
and
robinin
repectively
in
the
batcave
set
i
feel
that
it
only
really
caters
to
those
who
havnt
bought
the
set
and
i
wouldve
much
appreciated
different
vehicles
overall
a
very
nice
set
perhaps
the
best
of
the
2008
wave
despite
its
lack
of
originality
thank
you
very
much
for
the
review
bg
positive
looks
like
a
cool
set
but
the
hairpiece
for
robin
is
vary
disapointing
i
would
be
so
glad
is
they
used
the
regular
hair
you
see
all
the
time
i
hope
lego
will
not
make
a
habit
of
using
that
hairpiece
on
other
figures

tohse
mini
vehicles
and
minifigs
are
sexy
as
all
heck
i
love
drinferno
and
the
female
pattern
for
agent
trace
is
it
just
me
or
she
almost
busting
out
i
love
the
dr
inferno
hair
and
the
reappearance
of
spyclops
and
gold
tooth
is
simply
gold
yes

pun
intended
i
have
to
say

is
shaping

positive
cant
wait
for
the
kick
trailer
review
d
neutral
me
want
this
set
positive
you
know
i
like
many
had
doubts
about
these
sets
when
they
were
first
mentioned
but
ive
decided
i
want
the
whole
line
now
this
set
is
the
créme
de
la
créme
just
beautifully
stunning
that
is
a
great
review
sveltecorps
you
have
gone
into
fantastic
detail
and
description
of
all
the
elements
really
it
is
this
review
that
has
persuaded
me
to
buy
this
set
i
blame
you
the
minifigs
are
great
the
vehicles
are
better
and
the
truck
and
interior
is
awesome
the
few
minor
draw
backs
are
far
outweighed
by
the
attention
to
detail
and
the
many
unique
and
cool
elements
used
in
this
set
and
printed
pieces
that
is
even
better
great
job
you
have
obviously
put
a
tremendous
effort
in
making
this
review
and
i
for
one
definitely
appreciate
it
i
am
looking
forward
to
these
sets
being
available
in
new
zealand

much
this
review
has
truly
shown
this
set
as
a
brilliant
one
even
those
who
hate
this
theme
must
admit
it
is
greatly
designed
i
love
the
way
the
mini
vehicles
fit
i
love
the
light
brick
i
love
the
truck

am
positive
thats
an
awesome
review
and
a
great
set
it
seems
with
all
of
this
years
star
wars
i
still
havent
got
rogue
shadow
i
cant
afford
agents
too
which
is
a
shame
looking
at
this
positive
wow
great
review
of
what
seems
to
be
a
great
set
i
love
that
ponytail
this
looks
to
be
a
must
have
set
it
probably
wont
stay
together
for
long
though
thanks
very
much
i
fixed
the
header
for
you
thats
two
you
owe
me
the
other
is
for
making
me
think
that
this
set
was
in
australia
positive
sveltecorps
a
fanastic
review
of
this
biggest
agents
set
at
first
i
was
not
very
keen
to
have
this
set
however
after
reading
your
review
you
have
make
me
swing
up
and
down
its
simply
fabulous
thanks
for
your
hard
work
i
am
sure
its
not
easy
to
do
this
review
i
love
that
female
minifig
she
looks
awfully
sweet
especially
with
her
new
hair
great
job
positive
thanks
for
another
wonderful
review
sveltecorps
a
very
fine
set
indeed
i
absolutely
love
the
way
all
of
the
vehicles
fit
into
the
command
centre
very
clever
the
projector
is
really
cool
it
looks
very
nice
its
great
to
see
these
light
and
sound
bricks
in
the
agents
sets
all
of
the
little
nooks
and
crannies
in
the
centre
are
great
too
i
really
love
the
amount
of
detail
featured
mixed
with
all
of
the
playability
of
this
set
the
minifigs
as
usual
are
brilliant
the
uniforms
look
fantastic
dr
inferno
looks
especially
great
i
love
his
white
suit
with
hints
of
orange
and
who
can
forget
his
hair
im
really
tempted
to
buy
this
beast
now
though
im
not
sure
my
wallet
will
forgive
me
for
it
i
suppose
ill
have
to
cut
back
on
indy
and
castle
multiples
for
now
thanks
for
the
truly
great
review
sveltecorps
nice
work
positive
wow
this
set
looks
so
amazing
amazing
genius
davinci
art
i
say
youve
done
an
excellent
job
reviewing
and
really
this
is
the
review
ive
been
waiting
for
so
cool
so
classy
i
love
the
mission
briefing
feature
to
think
that
lego
could
go
so
high
as
to
put
something
ingenious
like
that
in
there
too
bad
lego
figures
dont
have
fingers
to
make
shadow
shows
eh
genius
the
jet
lauching
feature
is
pretty
slick
and
they
even
put
a
control
center
in
there
too
thats
beast
loving
that
the
bottomi
dont
see
how
that
big
buggy
can
get
out
or
in
there
but
awesome
too
the
back
of
the
truck
could
use
more
detailing
i
think
but
the
jail
popopen
feature
is
pretty
cool
as
is
the
speed
boat
storage
rack
cabin
its
great
that
roof
opening
feature
is
a
great
part
of
this
set
also
i
think
you
can
have
multiple
figures
up
theremaybe
you
can
mod
it
to
put
a
bed
in
there
it
certainly
looks
big
enough
inferno
plane
wow
that
think
is
smooth
baby
i
love
how
the
wings
contain
rotors
inside
of
them
thats
awesome
detail
right
there
that
is
a
sweet
ship
thingy
so
slick
the
rest
of
the
command
center
is
pretty
awesome
too
we
get
a
4x4
wheeler
and
a
crane
and
lots
of
room
wow
just
wow

i
first
i
thought
the
whole
agents
line
would
not
be
very
good
but
boy
have
i
changed
my
mind
this
set
looks
amazing
as
do
all
of
the
other
sets
in
the
line
i
really
like
how
the
small
vehicles
all
fit
into
the
truck
i
dont
like
it
when
sets
come
with
smaller
vehicles
and
dont
have
anywhere
to
store
them
so
they
just
float
on
the
side
that
light
projector
is
fantastic
i
cant
believe
they
are
actually
printed
this
is
definitly
on
my
tobuy
list

for

its

it

to

yes

are

holograms

and
the

ok
we
dont
have
a

fledged
classic

theme
back
yet
but
if
7645
is
the
way
of
the
future
i
think
lego
is
ready
to
do
it
properly
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
last
years
mars
mission
sets
and
only
picked
up
a
few
on
clearance
but
this
set
is
light
years
excuse
the
pun
ahead
of
2007s
offerings
this
mining
vehicle
is
solid
compact
and
welldesigned
it
looks
impressive
and
even
better
it
has
fantastic
power

operability

apologies
for

i
wanted
to
capture
the
sweet
shimmy
of
the
metallic
holographic
background
on
this
sheet
the
way
it
catches
the
light
really
makes
a
difference
to
the
small
alien
craft
and
makes
it
look
much
more
interesting
from
the
plain
stickers
of
last
year
theres
heaps
of
spare
silvery
stuff
once
the
stickers
are
applied
for
those
who
use

woo
i

scold

i
mix

but
im
a
devilmaycare
kind
of
guy
in
your
face
tlc
i
love
mixing
all
the
parts
together
before
i
build
it
reminds
me
of
my
youth
when
the
days
were
long
anything
was
possible
and
i
didnt
need
strict
instructions
not
to
build
on
grass
or
poke
my
eye
out
with
a
technic
shooter
interesting
parts
these
may
or
may
not
be
new
my
technic
knowledge
is
not
that
detailed
the
little
scoop
parts
are
so
cute
and
have
a
heap
of
potential
uses
i
love
em
theyre
like
smurf
hats
at
miniland
scale
these
technic
wheel
things
in
orange
are
also
cute
they
kind
of
remind
me
of
marigolds
giant

the

pieces
you
get

of
these
heres
the
section
of

as
you
can
see
its
about
52

together

minifigs
small
mining
transport
alien

i
have
to
confess
i
forgot
to
take
an
individual
snap
of
the
astronauts
its
the
usual
bunch
though
scaredy
face
guy
sunglasses
in
space
man
and
a
third
one
i
cant
remember
you
dont
really
care
though
youre
only
interested
in
the
alien
commander
and
his
matching
arms
legs
combo
deal
as
brickbitz
noted
in
his
review
of
the
smaller
set
the
glowy
eye
is
just
a
1x1
cylinder
the
set
also
comes
with
2
normal
jellies
one
pictured
here
for
size
youll
see
what
happened
to
the
other
one
soon
enough
the
alien
craft
is
nothing
exciting
apart
from
the
gorgeous
glinting
stickers
heres
the
road
safety
angle
the
commander
actually
clips
onto
a
1x2
plate
with
handle
so
he
cant
fall
out
then
the
lime
tentacle
thing
descends
on
top
of
him
to
keep
him
firmly
there
like
a
baby
seat
not
very
brave
for
an
alien
commander
is
he
i
mean
did
darth
vader
ever
use
a
seatbelt
tssk
with
cradle
up
this
part
of
the
build
also
includes
the
small
astronaut
mining
buggy
small
and
effective
please
note
in
this
build
ive
applied
stickers
to
everything
bar
cockpit
pieces
this
comes
with
radio
and
saw
piece
part
3
the
reaper
the
first
part
of
the
build
is
the
detachable
shuttle
i
really
like
the
retro
aesthetic
of
this
with
the
angled
wings
and
the
side
hoverpod
things
it
is
much
better
than
the
comparable
vehicle
from
7699
the
new
flickfire
piece
is
a
waste
of
space
its
fairly
limp
i
prefer
the
simple
flickfire
technic
pin
to
be
honest
theres
also
a
very
nice
little
side
workshop
as
you
can
see
i
really
like
how
the
control
unit
is
plugged
into
the
wall
via
5
1x1
round
plates
third
pic
its
a
bit
dark
great
detail
the
technic
pins
on
the
back
are
there
to
connect
the
power
functions
battery
box
its
odd
theyre
included
at
this
stage
of
the
instructions
maybe
the
intention
was
to
release
it
originally
with
all
the
necessary
motors
etc
but
the
price
point
was
too
high
and
they
scaled
it
back
the
base
the
shuttle
sits
on
that
bley
technic
axle
in
the
middle
when
the
reaper
is
fully
assembled
the
little
vehicle
scoots
down
the
ramp
at
the
rear
which
folds
up
to
hold
it
in
place
when
the
reaper
is
in
motion
you
can
see
theres
a
crystal
container
here
as
well
another
nice
small
detail
which
i
found
the
2007
sets
lacked
theres
also
an
alien
here
thankfully
not
in
those
horrendous
transorange
tubes
so
prevalent
last
year
the
complete
assembly
isnt
it
snug
its
just
the
right
size
too
not
massive
but
large
enough
to
be
a
serious
mining
vehicle
the
ominous
black
treads
contrast
nicely
with
the
white
orange
colour
scheme
of
the
vehicle
itself
the
trans
detailing
blue
for
weapons
neon
green
for
energy
is
carried
nicely
through
the
whole
set
the
blades
and
the
scoops
whirl
nicely
as
the
machine
trundles
along
top
down
view
tread
detail
whirling
blades
of
death
the
buggy
descends
probably
the
most
disturbing
aspect
of
the
whole
set
is
this
pic
the
jelly
has
an
orange
pump
plugged
into
its
heart
which
is
connected
to
an
energy
supply
on
the
left
hand
side
this
vehicle
runs
on
alien
jelly
juice
either
that
or
its
milking
the
jelly
in
some
equally
disturbing
fashion
how
amoral
is
that
i
know
theres
been
debate
about
this
the
jellys
arent
innocent
theyre
evil
energy
crystal
thieving
maniacs
etc
but
i
find
it
a
bit
odd
that
the
humans
respond
by
chaining
the
jelly
up
to
the
bowels
of
their
mining
vehcile
and
suck
energy
from
its
heart
people
debate
about
violence
in
lego
as
represented
by
realistic
minifig
weapons
but
i
think
the
moral
lesson
here
is
even
worse
its
ok
to
exploit
foreign
life
forms
for
our
own
gain
if
they
treat
us
badly
first
whofans
i
think
the
ood
should
have
a
word
with
the
jelly
commander
that
aside
this
set
is
welldesigned
and
fairly
good
value
at
aud7995
its
definitely
a
notch
above
last
years
mars
mission
sets
overall
with
improved
detailing
and
more
useful
functions
the
holostickers
are
fab
and
its
nice
to
have
an
alien
commander
even
if
he
is
a
bit
bulky
and
his
fingers
are
identical
to
his
toes
however
if
all
these
reasons
by
themselves
werent
reason
to
recomend
this
set
the
following
is
part
4
power
functions
the
best
part
of
this
set
and
the
reason
i
bought
it
really
is
the
integration
of
power
functions
bizarrely
this
isnt
mentioned
at
all
on
the
box
and
i
only
found
out
about
it
from
the
instructions
when
they
were
posted
on
eurobricks
instructions
for
book
2
which
has
the
power
function
stuff
available
here
this
is
a
great
idea
and
hopefully
we
will
see
more
new
sets
take
this
kind
of
approach
especially
with
the
new
train
sets
luckily
i
got
monster
dino
4958
on
sale
for
half
price
earlier
this
year
so
already
had
most
of
the
necessary
motors
etc
the
only
one
needed
was
an
extra
small
one
what
you
need
is
listed
in
the
instructions
below
with
redirections
to
shop
home
to
buy
the
motors
note
theres
actually
a
mistake
on
this
page
the
2
small
motors
you
need
are
both
8883
not
8882
which
is
the
large
xl
motor
way
to
confuse
the
kids
there
lego
attaching
them
was
a
dream
and
only
took
a
few
minutes
in
contrast
to
4958
where
it
was
almost
impossible
to
remove
motor
elements
without
dismantling
the
model
basically
the
back
platform
and
some
plates
and
orange
slopes
come
off
you
attach
the
motors
and
then
the
smaller
plates
go
back
on
these
parts
are
now
left
loose
overall
the
look
of
the
reaper
isnt
badly
effected
as
youre
mainly
viewing
from
the
front
anyway
sadly
i
cant
show
you
how
it
moves
youll
just
have
to
trust
me
that
it
does
the
way
it
is
steered
is
demonsrated
in
the
instruction
pages
above
basically
each
motor
is
controlled
by
a
corresponding
switch
on
the
remote
move
them
both
forward
to
move
forward
move
one
right
to
turn
right
move
both
back
to
move
back
etc
it
zips
along
its
a
speedy
little
thing
personally
i
wouldnt
want
to
be
in
its
path
as
it
comes
roaring
down
the
martian
canyon
my
cat
was
scared
as
it
was
it
is
oodles
of
fun
and
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
have
the
motors
or
can
get
them
cheaply
and
adds
a
whole
new
dimension
to
the
play
aspect
of
playset
it
is
also
as
i
said
very
quick
to
switch
between
modded
and
nonmodded
reaper
in
contrast
to
the
more
fiddly
dino
creations
the
only
problem
i
had
is
that
if
it
moves
too
fast
the
weight
of
the
battery
box
at
the
back
tends
to
pull
the
whole
thing
back
and
it
rears
up
it
does
correct
itself
though
i
only
trialled
this
on
carpet
last
night
so
it
may
behave
differently
on
other
surfaces
i
will
need
to
experiment
part

summation
this
is
a
great
set
made
even
better
with
the
addition
of
power
functions
at
aud7995
its
wellpriced
buy
it
buy
the
motors
as
well
kmart
still
has
stock
of
4958
at
89
wait
for
a
15
off
sale
you
wont
regret
it
buy
2
and
make
competing
battle
machines
the
only
thing
is
just
dont
torture
that
poor
jelly

great
review
i
just
got
7644
mx81
hypersonic
operations
aircraft
its
a
great
ship
i
started
to
review
it
but
then
it
started
to
rain
i
was
outside
so
the
review
is
coming
tommorow
technicolor
stickers
very
pretty
positive
you
really
are
an
awesome
set
reviewer
sveltecorps
thanks
very
much
for
this
sweet
review
so
indepth
and
detailed
that
is
one
sweet
vehicle
its
got
three
of
my
favourite
things
treads
orange
and
big
slicey
blades
thanks
again
peace
positive
another
great
review
im
looking
forward
to
getting
this
set
sometime
soon
i
wasnt
aware
of
the
power
function
aspect
similar
i
suppose
to
the
old
technic
sets
which
had
an
additional
instructions
for
those
with
the
relevant
motors
i
knew
those
dinos
i
got
at
clearance
would
come
in
useful
nice
to
see
the
recent
bulldozer
treads
appearing
in
black
grey
seemed
a
slightly
unusual
colour
choice
positive
these
new
sets
are
just
totally
offthewall
radical
d
its
the
little
details
like
the
scoops
on
the
blades
and
the
alternate
alien
energy
source
lego
didnt
even
have
to
include
those
but
they
did
that
show
lego
are
really
getting
back
into
their
groove
this
year
the
ability
to
add
power
functions
is
just
so
cool
as
well
im
going
to
pickup
the
creator
monster
dino
set
for
the
electronics
when
the
sales
hit
as
svelte
has
suggested
a
very
entertaining
review
just
like
the

command
center
one
d
positive
this
set
looks
10
times
sweeter
with
the
power
functions
too
bad
ill
have
to
buy
some
extra
negative
nice
review
the
power
functions
is
a
nice
idea
and
i
ownder
if
it
will
appear
in
any
other
new
sets
regarless
if
i
get
this
i
decided
to
just
to
get
what
ever
looks
good
in
the
shops
from
now
on
im
defianltey
picking
up
some
of
the
white
visors
off
bricklink
neutral
wow
this
thing
is
very
cool
definately
no
lack
of
details
and
is
quite
cheap
for
the
bang
of
the
set
that
you
get
for
some
reason
i
really
love
the
bay
in
the
back
of
the
detachable
ship
quite
an
improvement
from
last
years
line
thank
you
for
the
review
positive
thank
you
for
that
fine
review
sveltecorps
that
´
s
a
pretty
cool

much
more
solid
than
the
armoured
drilling
unit
with
a
nice
little
transporter
and
some
for
sure
pretty
interesting
additional
power
functions
a
very
smart
idea
indeed
did
i
miss
something
or
is
there
really
only
one
and
probably
improved

and
there

even
some

to
control
the

excellent
review
loving
this
set
i
mean
come
on
its
a
flipping
tank
awesomeness
is
written
all
over
this
from
all
those
blades
and
scoops
at
the
front
to
the
mini
rover
and
yes
you
can
even
turn
it
into
a
motorized
battle
tank
reminds
me
of
the
old
technic
days
when
they
advertised
in
the
manuals
how
to
hook
up
the
kits
with
separately
sold
motors

but
this
one
looks
ok
i
guess
suprised
they
dont
say
that
it
has
power

on
the
box
positive
positive
well
title
says
it
the
description
youll
understand
later
i
ordered
this
off
of
sh
last
tuesday
and
oddly
enough
its
listed
on
sh
as
mx81
hypersonic
airplane
id
like
to
apologize
for
the
random
horrible
faded
pics
i
took
the
review
outside
and
the
clouds
kept
shifting
changing
the
lighting
and
then
i
had
to
go
inside
because
it
started
raining
its
been
raining
for
a
week
its
raining
now
as
i
type
this
so
i
foolishly
went
outside
to
take
pics
the
front
of
the
box
not
bad
as
far
as
boxes
go
it
features
a
liftup
tab
which
shows
the
various
functions
back
of
the
box
still
not
much
to
say
two
manuals
i
think
this
is
just
right
not
too
thick
but
not
too
many
manuals
either
oddly
enough
the
box
came
with
a
little
folded
up
piece
of
paper
telling
us
not
to
mix
the
bags
it
comes
sorted
into
4
bags
by
the
way
minifigures
the
set
features
3
normal
mm
figs
1
normal
jellie
and
one
of
the
new
commanders
i
really
like
this
guy
he
has
a
few
issues
like
his
hands
being
stuck
sideways
and
still
being
hollow
but
still
a
great
improvement
hell
make
a
lovely
addition
to
any
halloween
moc
stickers
the
set
comes
with
a
fairly
big
dss
for
the
spacecraft
pretty
normal
but
i
do
like
the
dragon
sticker
then
suprises
of
suprises
a
technicolor
sticker
sheet
for
the
aliens
how
cool
is
this
huh
the
tops
of
the
actual
stickers
are
shiny
which
is
hard
to
see
in
the
pic
even
the
bottom
is
shiny
who
said
stickers
cant
be
cool
the
mining
craft
the
little
guy
is
pretty
cute
and
well
built
my
only
gripe
is
that
theres
nowhere
to
spin
the
drill
it
seems
so
lifeless
without
a
feature
the
alien
craft
youd
think
a
commander
would
be
important
enough
to
have
a
seatbelt
rather
than
be
stabbed
with
a
clip
and
stuck
on
the
ship
like
those
other
grunt
aliens
i
think
this
thing
has
some
potential
shiny
stickers
different
body
shape
and
when
you
look
at
those
engines
this
thing
could
be
an
alien
corvette
but
then
you
look
at
the
back
pretty
bare
no
flares
or
anything
its
a
cool
little
craft
but
it
justlacks
the
modules
these
things
have
some
potential
as
well
with
some
modding
they
could
be
pretty
cool
unfortunetly
its
pretty
boxy
there
are
no
engines
and
the
wings
are
too
small
the
top
is
pretty
nice
though
the
greebles
are
all
right
the
controls
as
usual
are
a
sticker
pretty
spacious
mind
you
the
cockpit
doesnt
stay
flush
with
the
body
though
the
front
plate
underneath
it
can
be
easily
replaced
with
a
brick
to
fix
that
im
not
gon
na
comment
on
this
the
main
body
too
bad
the
labratory
isnt
much
of
a
lab
a
transred
panel
and
some
tray
thing
are
all
that
compose
the
lab
i
was
expecting
more
but
true
to
form
this
mars
mission
set
has
no
impressive
interior
to
speak
of
there
is
a
lot
of
space
though
so
it
shouldnt
be
hard
to
mod
phew
the
lab
folds
up
like
so
pretty
simple
and
would
allow
access
to
the
lab
if
there
was
one
and
then
we
have
this
thing
what
is
it
defense
laser
communications
array
satellite
tv
the
modules
connect
like
so
sorry
out
of
place
too
bad
the
pins
stick
out
various
pics
as
you
can
see
this
thing
has
more
of
those
bars
than
an
att
commercial
there
you
understand
the
topic
description
now
the
rear
it
uses
a
white
city
plane
wing
for
thewings
when
i
first
saw
the
prototype
pics
i
thought
they
slanted
downwards
that
wouldve
been
really
cool
ah
now
to
the
platform
from
the
position
of
the
drill
i
think
this
could
be
a
really
cool
turret
location
when
i
mod
it
to
more
military
space
back
to
the
bars
if
we
had
space
monkeys
theyd
love
this
this
set
has
more
bars
than
a
jungle
gym
here
we
see
the
button
that
drops
the
platform
pretty
clever
and
its
not
in
the
way
best
of
all
it
really
works
really
well
actually
good
job
tlc
2
more
bars
and
a
shooter
mechanism
jeeze
this
is
really
setting
itself
up
for
a
joke
a
shooter
mechanism
walks
into
a
bar
never
mind
here
we
have
the
handle
that
allows
you
to
pick
it
up
safely
a
good
idea
but
its
placed
waaaay
to
far
back
way
off
the
center
of
balance
you
have
to
hold
on
to
it
pretty
well
to
keep
it
angled
up
though
it
does
stop
your
hands
from
getting
in
the
way
of
the
platform
ah
the
platform
in
action
this
is
really
a
neat
little
feature
not
only
can
the
ship
land
in
a
reduced
footprint
but
it
also
prevents
the
nice
white
paint
job
from
getting
red
dust
all
over
it
its
centered
pretty
well
too
and
you
dont
have
to
worry
about
knocking
it
over
just
dont
shove
it
back
at
all
here
we
have
the
latch
when
the
button
on
top
is
pushed
this
gets
pulled
inward
which
pulls
out
of
this
hole
and
allows
it
to
swing
neatly
down
good
luck
and
happy
mining
again
sorry
for
the
lack
of
inprogress
review
i
wouldve
liked
to
take
pics
of
the
mechanism
and
so
on
but
typical
of
the
mm
sets
you
cant
really
take
it
apart
well
this
is
really
a
nice
set
which
can
hopefully
be
upgraded
with
a
better
lab
with
little
difficulty
some
of
my
military
mod
plans
include
strip
the
lab
and
install
a
command
center
get
rid
of
lots
of
bars
the
thing
has
more
bars
than
alcatraz
install
some
turrets
this
is
a
big
command
ship
so
why
all
the
forwardfacing
weapons
itll
need
some
aa
defense
mod
the
landing
platform
to
be
a
troop
dropper
with
installable
aa
turret
mod
the
cockpit
pods
to
be
more
aerodymic
so
thats
all
folks
shall
i
include
one
last
bar
joke
neutral
i
appreciate
your
review
mr
mandalorian
but
why
the
negativity
id
try
to
find
more
positives
about
the
set
instead
of
kinda
criticizing
it
after
each
picture
i
personally
think
it
looks
freakin
awesome
the
size
is
very
impresive
and
i
nearly
fell
of
my
chair
when
i
saw
the
first
pics
earlier
this
year
its
quite
unlike
anything
ive
ever
seen
from
lego

for

i
really
like
all
the

sets
this

the
usage
of
the
big
wing
is
a
bit
annoying
but
you
cant

for
the
review
mr
mandalorian
this
is
an
er
interesting
set
lots
of
frontal
firepower
very
big
too
and
i
like
the
idea
of
those
two
little
craft
that
attach
on
the
sides
sort
of
like
little
escape
pod
things
anywho
not
one
of
the
things
on
my
to
buy
list
but
i
do
like
that
radioactive
sticker
that
could
come
in
use
looking
forward
to
seeing
your
modifications
too
peace
positive
thanks
for
the
great
and
very
detailed
review
i
love
the
new
holostickers
im
still
not
sold
on
this
set
though
im
not
sure
why
i
think
its
the
big
wing
piece
and
the
tootechnicy
build
from
looking
at
the
instructions
the
platform
seems
kind
of
out
of
place
and
for
the
size
of
the
set
the
functionality
doesnt
seem
as
good
as
it
could
be
it
reminds
me
of
7699
armored
drilling
unit
looks
impressive
but
doesnt
seem
to
do
that
much
i
do
think
mars
mission
has
improved
this
year
though
bar
none
this
is
the
weakest
of
the
new
mm
sets
i
think
negative

the

is
a

small
in
my
opinion
could
have
done
with
being
just
a
little
bit
larger
the
main
craft
however
despite
its
few
minor
flaws
looks
very
good

space
is

i
am
a
proud
owner

to
them
there
is
a
definite
lineage
here
and
these
sets
clearly
demonstrate
the
evolution
of
lego
set
design
over
the
years
the
mx81
may
not
have
the
most
playability
out
of
all
the
new
mm
sets
although
it
has
alot
from
what
i
can
tell
but
its
hard
to
beat
the
look
of
a
large
sleek
space
cruiser
sitting
on
your
shelf
or
dresser
at
least
for
myself
anyhow
this
is
my
first
post
to
the
forum
and
hope
my
welcome
wont
wear
out
here
anytime
soon

i
dont

why
theres
so
much
negativity
this
is
actually
my
favorite
of

the

look
is
very
sleek
and
not
very
gappy
at

the

is
great
and
itll
make

easy

put

lots

although
i
will
concede
that
its
just
begging
to
be

still
though
im
definitely
buying
this
one
it
has
a
really
great
look
to
it
positive
two
more
questions
1
how
stable
is
the
entire
craft
when
balanced
on
the
platform
is
there
a
chance
that
it
will
just
collapse
2
what

thanks
for
the
review
i
actually
quite
like
this
i
cant
afford
it
so
im
not
getting
too
attached
to
it
but
in
its
own
way
its
great
its
certainly
reminiscent
of
space
sets
of
the
past
as
others
have
said
and
the
dropdown
ramp
section
is
just
really
cool
as
an
idea
you
understand
sure
the
lab
is
a
little
crap
but
at
least
the
effort
was
made
sort
of
the
sheer
fact
that
its
so
big
though
really
makes
me
like
this
theres
just
something
appealing
about
large
spaceships
not
capital
ships
just
big
space
ships
with
lots
of
guns

were
not
breaking
forum
protocol
by
not
discussing
the

review
of
the
original

or
that
particular
set
in
general
hey
its
no
worse
than
batbrick
and
i
no
really
it
isnt
even
in
the
same
league
positive
thank
you
for
that
nice
review
mr
mandalorian
wow
somehow
it
´
s
almost
like
classic
space
´
s
back
indeed
it
´
s
a
great
star
ship
it
looks
stream
lined
original
and
impressive
and
even
the
huge
plane
wing
part
looks
rather
cool
and
smooth
on
it
it
´
s
equipped
at
least
with
some
kind
of
engines
on
top
of
the
wings
and
although
they
´
re
made
with
only
two
a
little
juniorized
parts
it
´
s
better
than
nothing
there
´
s
a
lab
or
some
sort
of
engine
room
with
enough
space
inside
to
allow
one
or
two
mfs
to
play
scotty
yeah
the
two
cockpits
´
re
nicely
detailed
with
a
cool
use
of
these
orange
1x1
round
plates
and
to
detach
one
or
all
two
of
them
reminds
a
lot
of
the
playability
of
the
good
old
space
sets
it
seems
even
like
it
´
s
easy
to
attach
them
to
some
kind
of
cloud
city
twinpod
car
thanks
these
hinged
wings
looks
like
some
solid
fun
to
me
of
course
the
cockpits
aren
´
t
airtight
and
even
this
reminds
unfortunately
of
the
post
blue
grey
and
trans
yellow
era
of
cs
anyway
there
´
s
no
real
fun
without
some
moding
i
guess
another
great
advantage
of
the
set
´
s
that
it
´
s
not
overpacked
with
shooting
things
one
technic
shooter
cool
in
grey
and
only
one
trans
orange
prison
pod
too
well
i
can
surely
live
with
that
especially
since
it
´
s
nicely
asymmetrical
the
drill
rover
´
s
very
charming
a
little
like
a
rebuilt
oldsmobile
convertibe
stranded
on
mars
sweet
and
that
platform
feature
´
s
plain
nifty
and
well
done
too
very
playable
and
useable
for
a
lot
of
things
hmm
recently
i
complained
a
lot
about
the
dense
use
of
studless
technic
beams
for
the
inner
structure
of
vehicles
like
these
exoforce
tanks
par
exemple
which
makes
moding
in
an
economical
way
pretty
frustrating
but
the
beams
here
´
re
used
in
a
very
proper
way
it
should
be
fairly
easy
to
mod
let
´
s
say
the
back
of
that
lab
section
up
to
perhaps
even
the
cockpits
to
create
a
larger
airtight
area
that
could
be
boarded
from
the
platform
just
to
fit
this
certain
spacers
need
for
um
realism
there
´
re
many
more
nice
details
too
like
that
satelite
tv
thingy
and
that
cylinder
with
trans
blue
2x2
dish
for
the
knob
or
these
cylinders
with
cones
on
that
handle
and
that
alien
craft
´
s
pretty
nice
and
detailed
as
well
like
i
said
before
i
really
feel
like
classic

kinda
criticizing
it

it
looks

is
very

thought

was

i
actually
love
the
set
it
brings
a
real
feel
of
classic
space
to
mm
no
im
not
talking
in
the
third
person
however
it
does
have
its
own
small
issues
which
are
nothing
really
i
said
that
theres
not
much
of
a
lab
but
thats
the
beauty
of
lego
theres
a
lot
of
room
in
the
ship
so
it
should
be
a
piece
of
cake
to
mod
to
a
bigger
lab
too
many
bars
ill
take
them
off
i
really
like
the
set
i
just
want
to
change
it
to
suit
my
tastes
it
looks
beautiful
it
will
find
a
home
among
my
other
mm
sets
as
a
favorite
iron
moose
good
question
its
about
17
inches
wide
11
inches
tall
with
ramp
down
and
16
inches
wide
as
for
the
platform
its
pretty
stable
it
tilts
back
a
small
degree
so
it
doesnt
collapse
when
tapped
on
the
nose
but
i
wouldnt
leave
it
on
the
edge
of
a
table
while
in
that
position
neutral
i
think
this
thing
is
compensating
the
poor
lab
with
the
bar
army
positive
nice
review
just
one
little
point
since
there
is
no
sound
transmission
through
space
but
there
is
an
atmosphere
on
mars
through
which
this
this
thing
supposedly
flies
hypersonic
airplane
makes
far
more
sense
than
hypersonic
spacecraft
positive
sorry
mr
mandalorian
i
guess
i
was
just
getting
a
bit
defensive
because
when
this
set
first
appeared
here
there
were
literally
2
pages
of
people
just
bagging
out
the
new
mm
sets
but
then
the
thread
took
a
turn
and
people
started
to
warm
to
them
much
like
the
agents
i
do
agree
that
it
definitely
needs
some
mocing
but
with
that
work
i
think
it
has
the
potential
to
be
a
really
amazing
set
in
terms
of
what
you
could
cram
into
it
the
lab
is
a
little
disappointing
ive
always
wanted
an
enclosed
cabin
space
in
a
vehicle
this
size
because
then
all
the
little
space
guys
can
have
a
true
meeting
place
the
dropdown
landing
ramp
is
my
favourite
part
it
has
lots
of
potential
uses
maybe
its
even
possible
to
integrate
pneumatics
d

i
didnt
see
this
one
coming
probably
because
that
huge
white
beard
got

something

maybe
not

where
is

the
beard
and

are
leftovers

what
was

be

hello
all
eurobricks
members
i
will
be
presenting
my
first
review
on
one
of
the
harry
potters
set
firstly
i
must
emphasize
that
i
am
not
a
very
big
harry
potter
fan
or
owned
many
harry
potter
sets
for
this
review
i
will
be
highlighting
what
is
the
beauty
of
this
small
little
set
and
the
reasons
to
own
multiple
sets
of
it
comments
and
critics
are
strongly
welcomed
this
set
is
featured
in
the
harry
potter
movie
prisoner
of
azkaban
this
set
is
orignally
released
in
2004
align
with
the
harry
potters
movie
this
was
actually
one
of
the
movie
scene
where
buckbeak
the
griffin
is
appeared
in
the
movie
the
group
of
students
are
supposed
to
be
having
up
close
and
personal
with
him
however
draco
decided
to
disturb
our
lovely
buckbeak
enough
of
this
movie
synopsis
i
am
sure
fans
of
harry
potter
will
know
this
better
box
art
featured
minifigcreature
background
scene
the
scene
is
a
simple
garden
which
had
a
very
good
mixture
of
spare
parts
for
your
mocs
building
on
its
own
there
is
nothing
outstanding
about
this
set
except
for
the
griffin
you
can
buy
multiple
sets
for
the
griffin
alone
and
for
draco
minifig
well
you
dont
need
lots
of
draco
but
for
castle
lovers
black
cap
are
exceptionally
useful
at
least
from
my
view
now
i
will
point
out
the
following
why
this
sets
is
so
great
for
other
reasons
hidden
cover
note
that
this
is
the
only
mechanism
which
you
can
find
in
this
set
it
looks
rather
simple
but
quite
useful
there
are
some
little
things
hide
in
it
too
greens
foilage
and
brown
parts
needless
to
say
much
it
offer
3
foilage
a
green
plant
3
brown
slopes
2
ideal
bricks
and
1x1
brown
brick
for
building
a
tree
great
for
jungle
building
forest
building
and
etc
i
am
sure
there
are
many
builders
will
look
out
for
these
interesting
parts
it
comes
with
a
wizard
book
owl
2
printed
tiles
with
a
spider
and
stone
prints
on
it
the
far
right
seriously
i
dont
find
any
good
use
for
it
can
any
eb
members
enlighten
me
on
that
gray
thing
on
the
right
grey
parts
it
comes
with
a
good
10
x
4
green
plate
useful
for
adding
as
a
platform
some
more
grey
slopes
for
your
mocs
there
you
have
it
draco
encounter
with
buckbeak
comparing
with
deep

ambush
as
you
may
remembered
recently
there
was
an
impulse
set
competition
one
of
my
entries
which
is
under
the
history
theme
the
deep
forest
ambush
was
firstly
inspired
by
this
set
and
made
an
improvement

of

at
the
improved

of

your
review
has
shown
me
that
its

that

maybe
ill
try
to
pick
one
up

2

with

the

seriously
i
dont
find
any
good
use
for
it
can
any
eb
members
enlighten
me
on
that
gray
thing
on
the
right
the
gray
thing
is
technically
a
plume
like
any
castle
plume
except
in
this
case
its
a
feather
presumably
from
the
griffin
and
made
from
the
mold
to
the
old
indian
feathers
in
the
wild
west
sets
its
a
case
of
an
old
part
coming
back
for
a
slightly
new
use
in
a
new
colour
beyond
that
the
stone
print
tile
is
a
bundle
or
rolled
up
blanket
or
package
depending
on
where
its
used
i
dont
think
its
ever
meant
to
be
a
stone
it
was
used
as
a
rolled
up
pack
on
the
back
of
the
star
wars
speederbikes
for
example
nice

plenty
of
useful

used
for

griffin
riders
in
my
castle
collection

a
pretty

little
set
that
i
wish
id
bought
between
1
and
10
of
just
for
the
griffin
oh
well
your
review
has
shown
me
that
its
useful
for
more
than
just
that
so
maybe
ill
try
to
pick
one
up
someday
cant
have
too

useful
thanks
for
enlighten
me
now
i
know
where
is
the
origin
of
that
gray
plume
i
wonder
if
i
can
use
it
to
match
with
my
castle
knights
as
its
plume
in
addition
i
mistook
the
rolled
up
pack
as
the
stone
print
tile
why
didnt
i
think
of
it
i
must
have
overlook
it
and
used
it
as
a
stone
tile
instead
nevertheless
i
am

great
review
nice
set
for
plants
huh
too
bad
i
didnt
get
thus
set
but
luckily
my
neighbor
did
that
griffin
is
nice
for
castle
mocs
and
that
orange

pumpkin
i
know
seems
rare
to
me
not
much
else
to

ohhh
great

to

the

especially
the

from

was
in

then
luckily
i
was
able
to
catch
up
on
the

figs
with

order
this
draco
is
the
best
tlc
has
made
if
you
ask
me
the
new
one
also
doubling
for
belloq
and
guards
in
the
indy
line
doesnt
look
quite
as
hautain
as
this
one
buckbeak
looks
cool
looks
like
his
neckhead
can
be
moved

rather
similar
to
lego

well
designed
the
orange
brick
doesnt
have

i
also
agree
that
this
draco
is
the
best
one
the
new
one
looks
too
much
like
a
draco
from
the
oldr
films
when
he
smirked
a
lot
more
but
since
very
character
got
a
redesignthey
had
to

him
up

for

some

highlights
for

i
have
overlooked
it
earlier
i
strongly
agreed
with
you
that
this
draco
is
the
best
tlc
made
i
pretty
like
the
face
compared
to
others
furthermore
i
used
my
multiple
dracos
for
my
castle
armor
guards
instead
one
could
not
have
too
many
dracos
buckbeak
design
is
well
made
the
head
can
be
moved
upwards
and
downwards
the
mechanism
is
similar
to
the
horse
design
in
addition
buckbeak
wings
can
be
removed
similar
to
the
typical
green
or
black
dragon
wings
that
we
used
to
see
in
the
past
well
the
main
reason
for
me
to
buy
this
set
was
in
fact
buckbeak
you
dont
often
find
a
griffin
lying
around
except
in
harry
potter
sets

i
bought
about
5

6
of
these

when
they
were
on
sale
in
mid
2006
i
still
have
a
few
of
them
laying
around
unopened
i
think
i
payed
like
under
5
for
each
and
thats
a
great
deal
for
all
the
variety
of
neat
parts
you
get
with
this
set
positive
nice
review
i
like
the
treemaking
pieces
the
most
of
this
not
very
expensive
set
the
buckbeak
fig
is
very
nice
and
can
bow
his
head
like
the
horses
i
was
annoyed
to
get
another
draco
without
some
other
not
made
figs
pansy
parkinson
for
example
about
the
dark
bley
feathers
in
the
second
version
of
hogwarts
there
were
several
of
these
feathers
put
in
little
1x1
cones
like
it
was
a
feather
to
write
with
it
i
bought
2
sets
of
these
and
when
they
were
for
sale
i
just
bought
6
more
of
it
only
annoying
that
i
had
then
even
a
bigger
army
of
dracos
neutral
i
see
a
lot
of
good
reviews
on

but
this
one
is
superb
good
job
tom
neutral
yay
the
monster
book
of
monsters
now
i
want
this
i
also
love
the
buckbeak
figure
it
looks
very
realistic
for
a
lego
version
of
something
usually
they
are
much
worse
look
at
the
goblins

very

review
neutral
hello
eb
yes
im
cranking
out
the
reviews
the
other
day
i
picked
up
this
gem
for
an
okay
sales
price
at
devonport
tas
while
searching
for
the
new
batsets
i
informed
iamded
of
this
as
he
is
a
spideysuckup
and
he
informed
me
this
was
the
only
set
he
didnt
have
of
the
wave
2
of
this
theme
so
i
ask
you
great
eb
members
to
please
remind
him
of
this
when
commenting
here
we
go
with
the
review
of
doctopus
lair
anyway
unlike
other
reviews
this
stars
more
people
the
batbrickiamdeddragonatordaisy
review
daisy
is
the
mouse
that
came
in
the
set
first
up
re
the
figs
and
i
must
say
they
are
great
i
love
fleshies
and
these
are
excellent
to
expand
my
batman
world
plus
having
a
spiderman
to
beat
up
is
good
too
doctopus
is
great
though
his
tentacles
are
annoying
to
keep
in
order
peter
parker
is
a
nice
addition
i
love
that
torso
eve
though
harry
osborn
was
totally
absent
from
this
scene
i
welcome
him
as
he
is
a
good
fig
also
best
of
all
is
mary
jane
fleshie
females
are
hard
to
come
by
and
i
love
that
hair
my
very
first
one
oh
and
even
better
is
bley
daisy
on
the
far
right
another
fantastic
thing
is
that
by
mixing
mj
with
doctopus
you
get
a
far
more
deadly
and
real
villain
than
anyone
couldve
forseen
the
hippy
oh
cmon
tell
me
that
aint
cool
anyhoo
here
is
a
pic
of
doctopus
showing
his
might
random
fact
did
you
know
i
influence
both
dragonator
and
iamded
in
their
sigfigs
dragonator
adapts
his
from
my
ia
series
while
iamded
added
mutt
hair
when
i
had
him
like
that
in
a
pic
i
posted
now
onto
the
box
sorry
about
the
lighting
the
art
is
good
and
the
cartoon
spidey
in
the
corner
may
have
beenthe
inspiration
for
a
similar
style
in
the
new
batsets
back
of
the
box
again
sorry
about
the
lighting
and
blur
it
was
gtting
late
and
these
were
the
last
pics
finally
we
get
to
the
first
part
of
the
set
the
catapult
is
that
movie
accurate
or
what
i
love
the
part
in
sm2
when
he
uses
his
homemade
genetic
spider
powered
catapult
to
launch
himself
to
the
scene
oh
well
it
does
comes
with
a
cool
spider
web
an
trans
blue
spider
so
it
gets
some
points
and
it
is
really
fun
i
launched
spidey
several
metres
once
i
dont
think
he
ever
recovered
infact
he
almost
certainly
webbed
himself
slightly
cooler
extras
are
these
two
this
awesome
little
boat
is
great
for
city
as
is
the
simple
but
nice
bouy
daisy
approves
naturally
dragonator
ruins
everything
when
he
found
out
the
dragon
that
would
be
riding
with
him
was
our
nickname
for
daisy
now
finally
the
main
attraction
coctopus
dock
iamded
and
i
threw
dragonator
in
the
water
to
see
if
he
could
swim
he
er
couldnt
one
sweeney
todd
later
we
continue
the
overall
construction
of
the
building
is
very
good
i
know
a
lot
of
people
hated
stickers
and
i
hated
applying
these
but
they
do
look
spectacular
and
perfect
for
any
city
setting
like
a
bank
a
gotham
bank
as
iamded
has
already
noted
below
me
the
black
lifesavers
a
very
cool
as
are
the
web
piece
and
log
pieces
the
inside
contains
the
neutron
copperplate
triple
bypass
humdrum
holy
hum
5000
which
does
does
see
movie
anyhoo
it
is
very
cool
and
includes
a
little
control
thingy
on
the
yellow
brick
next
to
it
unfortunately
the
inside
is
plain
but
for
that
the
other
side
has
no
wall
too
which
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
really
but
atleast
it
allows
daisy
easy
access
one
gripe
is
those
yellow
1x1
bricks
they
serve
no
purpose
and
break
up
the
colour
scheme
better
shot
of
the
thingy
thing
i
quite
like
it
the
use
of
technic
parts
actually
works
and
the
whole
set
is
worth
it
for
those
purple
flames
and
dishes
alone
it
closes
up
pretty
well
too
unable
to
hit
the
dish
which
is
a
nice
feature
me
and
iamded
liked
it
so
much
we
threw
a
revived
dragonator
into
it
unfortunately
it
disagreed
with
him
but
it
was
fun
another
shot
of
the
dock
i
like
how
they
have
gaps
in
the
jetty
i
know
the
movie
version
was
pretty
wack
and
although
the
set
isnt
very
faithful
to
it
looks
more
like
a
seaside
library
to
be
frank
it
still
is
very
nice
this
is
my
first
large
blue
baseplate
too
which
is
wonderful
though
funny
how
the
set
only
uses
about
half
of
it
the
roof
is
a
well
designed
and
fun
feature
it
uses
some
technic
connections
to
render
it
flexible
of
any
degree
as
you
can
see
here
by
my
opening
of
it
better
shot
of
the
roof
design
it
can
lie
flat
or
at
any
angle
i
might
use
the
design
myself
in
the
future
as
much
as
i
love
the
building
this
feature
bugs
me
for
in
order
for
it
to
work
this
wall
has
to
stick
out
which
not
only
looks
ugly
but
makes
you
be
able
to
see
through
the
corners
still
easily
modded
and
log
pieces
are
fantastic
for
mocing
it
also
means
that
there
are
7
windows
all
up
for
a
good
sizeable
building
by
pulling
out
the
piece
in
the
center
the
walls
both
collapss
sideways
outwards
which
is
actually
pretty
fun
and
works
everytime
overall
view
of
the
set
including
characters
now
for
the
story
that
makes
no
senseat
all
spiderman
is
dead
after
falling
down
the
wall
mechanism
see
above
only
daisy
can
save
the
day
for
dragonator
is
being
held
by
the
evil
doctopus
and
iamded
and
dragonator
are
too
busy
not
caring
and
brainbox
is
too
busy
complaining
that
this
goes
against
all
marvel
continuity
unfortunately
daisy
is
on
a
lunchbreak
so
tough
luck
dragonator
and
daisy
goes
on
a
search
for
fortune
and
glory
okay
this
is
what
i
think
of
the
set
build
35
fun
but
those
stickers
ruin
the
experience
somewhat
and
if
you
dont
apply
them
the
instructions
are
a
bit
hard
to
follow
playability
45
great
little
gizmos
and
bits
not
the
kind
that
keep
you
going
like
with
the
2007
aquabase
but
good
fun
still
design
45
not
very
movie
faithful
no
but
still
a
great
little
building
and
a
smart
design
for
certain
aspects
minifigs
55
great
figs
with
all
different
faces
and
very
useful
bits
price
25
far
far
overpriced
even
on
sale
sadly
total
1825
a
good
set
that
couldve
been
better
with
a
few
minor
changes
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
it
doesnt
really
cross
the
line
to
greatness
that
said
it
has
a
lot
going
for
it
and
definitely
worth
buying
or
atleast
a
look
thanks

great
review
as
always
batbrick
i
always
enjoy
reading
them
because
they
really
make
my

i

that
we
shall

more
and

good

gentlemen
neutral
i
got
this
set
in
2006
in
a
byrnes
world
of
wonder
toy
shop
i
dont
remember
how
much
but
it
was
a
deal
the
box
was
all
battered
but
it
had
everything
good
review
batbrick
neutral
where
is
my
soap
haha
anyway
nice
review
as
always
batbrick
i
too
have
the
set

hate
the
wall
jutting
out

and
missing
wall
but
hey
review
negative
great
review
batbrick
i
was
curious
as
to
what
the
interior
of
the
building
looked
like
i
still
think
that
there
should
have
been
a
few
random
chains
or
something
lying
around
as
they
may
add
to
the
abandoned
feeling
that
the
ware
house
had
though
i
have
to
admit
that
i
really
like
the
roof
dock
and
minifigs
as
some
of
them
make
good
average
civilians
that
are
somewhat
hard
to
come
by
in
todays
sets
great
comic
as
well
it
seemed
to
add
a
lot
to
your
review
hope
you
can
review
another
spider
man
set
soon
btw
as
adam
mentioned
i
believe
you
owe
me
a
bar
of
soap
for
reading

acurate

the

was

sorry
to
all
for
the
delay
since
this
was
supposed
to
be
done
3
days
ago
anyway
to
get
on
with
it
quite
a
minimal
amount
of
baggies
for
this
set
as
noticed
and
the
best
thing
is
no
sticker
sheet
yippee
bounce
the
completed
vwing
though
not
really
a
complaint
it
would
be
nice
if
the
entire
astromech
body
was
provided
instead
of
only
the
head
dome
p
of
course
then
it
wouldnt
be
movieaccurate
since
the
q7
series
astromech
is
integrated
with
the
starfighter
lol
hes
definitely
wellpainted
for
a
simple
minifig
since
even
the
back
is
painted
too
i
have
to
assumed
this
is
the
same
minifig
provided
for
7259
arc170
starfighter
too
since
i
dont
have
that
set
anyway
this
minifig
is
much
more
accurate
for
this
vwing
since
his
suit
is
rated
against
vacuum
while
those
in
the
arc170
arent
p
one
thing
thats
lacking
is
the
instruments
panel
in
the
cockpit
its
totally
nonexistent
here
i
wonder
what
went
wrong
during
the
design
stage
personally
this
is
the
second
most
anticipated
set
for
2006
the
first
being
the
tie
interceptor
for
me
one
thing
is
that
theres
no
known
release
of
the
vwing
starfighter
by
hasbro
nor
the
other
wellknown
brands
the
other
thing
is
that
being
a
star
wars
vehicle
collector
i
would
really
loved
to
see
a
replica
toy
of
the
vwing
and
the
vwing
by
the
lego
group
does
not
disappoint
its
nearly
movieaccurate
except
for
the
cockpit
transparisteel
cover
which
could
used
some
paint
like
the
xwings
also
theres
a
permanent
landing
gear
that
quite
neat
since
it
allows
you
to
land
the
craft
on
uniform
surfaces
the
sfoils
on
the
other
hand
can
be
quite
a
pain
to
pose
into
flight
position
very
difficult
for
the
sfoils
to
remain
symmetrical
during
play
the
swooshable
or
play
factor
of
this
product
is
quite
good
just
check
out
the
pics
for
yourself
d
crackle
general
skywalker
we
have
incoming
to
conclude
the
vwing
starfighter
would
make
a
much
better
companion
to
the
eta2
actis
interceptor
jedi
starfighter
than
the
arc170
coz
the
arc170
seems
more
like
a
longrange
bomber
to
me
than
a
snubfighter
p
and
a
final
pic
to
show
it
at
rest
comments
for
2008
just
an
updated
pic
to
show
my
latest
display
on
the
clone
wars
hmm
off
the
record
i
do
understand
that
sometimes
reviews
by
most
tend
to
a
certain
set
of
guidelines
like
naming
the
set
and
showing
the
boxed
and
out
of
boxed
pics
and
of
course
the
grading
portion
regarding
my
review
i
prefer
not
to
grade
any
of
the
lego
sets
at
all
as
far
as
possible
because
to
each
hisher
own
my
reasons
to
put
up
a
review
is
not
to
belittle
the
efforts
of
tlg
in
coming
out
with
these
products
nor
to
help
them
market
them
but
to
show
my
appreciation
and
enjoyment
of
these
products
i
hope
noone
is
offended
by
this
and
would
like
to
apologise
for
any
misunderstanding
that
this
may
caused
for

yesh
finally
a
tie
interceptor
this
is
probably
the
most
anticipated
for
all
set
for
all
lego
tie
collectors
worldwide
since
the
fighter
bomber
advanced
and
even
the
expanded
universe
droid
fighter
had
been
released
by
the
lego
group
this
set
is
near
movieaccurate
since
the
bottom
part
of
it
aint
p
the
cockpit
and
pylons
uses
the
same
design
as
that
of
the
tie
advanced
piloted
by
darth
vader
except
for
one
minor
change
that
is
the
aft
interior
of
the
cockpit
is
strengthen
this
time
and
this
is
indeed
good
news
since
the
older
models
had
a
problem
of
hard
hinge
and
loose
brick
connection
theres
no
landing
gear
for
this
set
but
it
doesnt
require
it
anyway
this
tie
interceptor
balances
perfectly
on
its
wings
standard
instruments
panel
and
of
course
standard
imperial
pilot
the
swooshable
or
play
factor
of

very

to

this

60
due
to
its

for
a

this
is

the
only
flaw
for

the

flaw
for

the
price
doh
commentcurrent
in

being
a
starwars
fan
no
being
a
typical
toy
collector
space
is
definitely
a
premium
so
much
so
that
i
turned
to
lego
starwars
to
sate
my
appetite
for
more
starwars
products
when
i
already
have
no

space
for

they
are
the

of

in

so
just
view
them
for

eh
and
no
i
havent
had
the
chance
nor
the
time
to
do
up
a
scene
of
my
lego
starfighters
blowing
up
spectacularly
since
the
pieces
would
be
very
hard
to

though

good
review
jifel
positive
great
review
thanks
for
posting
neutral
i
picked
up
this
set
mainly
because
of
the
many
5spare
glow
in
the
dark
parts
and
the
promise
of
2
racers
and
one
helicopter
for
the
price
of
a
little
more
than
two
racers
90kr
vs
2x40kr

the
back
of
the
box
shows
the
two
alternate
models
you
can
build
if
the
polybags
rip

are
3
cheese
slopes
and
two
1x2
tiles
that
glow
in
the
dark
where
the
tiles
are
exclusive
for
this

the
total
parts
count
is
high
at

there
are
no

instructions
a
sheet
with
some
odd
sticky
labels
thrown
away
and
3
polybags
marked
by
the
bag
building
difficulty
the
models
the
lime
colored
car
doesnt
bring
out
anything
new
we
have
seen
racers
built
like
that
before
but
it
does
contain
some
nice
bricks
for
the
collection
the
police
cruiser
surprises
with
an
interesting
design
along
the
sides
as
seen
here
it
is
harder
to
build
because
of
the
greater
level
of
details
the
helicopter
is
without
doubt
the
hardest
vehicle
to
build
in
a
bag
i
cant
finish
it
because
its
larger
than
the
bag
you
cant
put
on
the
top
blades
nor
the
tail
of
the
thing
so
it
beats
the
forklift
from
7733
where
the
top
bar
is
the
new
kind
that
doesnt
completely
fit
there
is
also
instructions
for
the
alternate
models
but
it
requires
the
bags
to
be
opened
the
vehicles
are
pretty
standard
for
the
racers
theme
with
the
police
car
being
the
highlight
of
the
set
conclusion
i
like
the
difficulty
curve
between
bag
1
and
2
but
the
last
bag
should
be
labeled
1000000
instead
of
3
it
requires
some
inhuman
skills
to
build
that
helicopter
in
the
bag
lime
colored
car
3
we
have
seen
it
before
but
it
has
some
nice
pieces
and
lime
police
cruiser
9
it
has
a
massive
diffusers
rare
parts
and
a
high
level
of
details
it
is
a
shame
lego
relies
so
much
on
stickers
helicopter
6
if
you
see
it
as
a
set
for
one
fourth
of
the
price
of
the
cars
it
is
quite
amazing
but
you
cant
bag
build
it
and
i
would
personally
prefer
some
more
detail
instead
of
the
big
size
overall
it
is
a
nice
little
set
but
the
police
car
is
the
main
attraction
i
wouldnt
get
the
other
vehicles
if
they
were
sold
separately

make

back
on

open

did

close

bag
building
is
not
for
everybody
some
might
become
very
frustrated
with
it
and
let
their
anger
out
on
the
set

lining
it
up
on
a
mini
golf
course
neutral
nice
review
but
i
think
bag
building
is
a
boring
way
to
build
neutral
i
bought
a
tiny
turbos
seta
nono
for
me
after
i
saw
this
bag
building
its
actually
pretty
fun
i
built
it
faster
than
i
would
if
i
had
opened
the
bags
neutral
seeming
as
there
were
no
reviews
of
this
set
in
the
index
i
have
uploaded
mine
from
jabbas
hutt
here
is
my
review
for
lego
set
10178
motorized
walking
atat
because
i
live
in
the
uk
i
got
this
set
with
6
free
duracell
batteries
which
was
great
its
just
twice
as
expensive
as
the
us
heres
the
basic
set
that
is
from
the
instructions
this
is
the
cockpit
but
please
note
after
i
took
this
photo
i
realised
it
was
slightly
built
wrong
heres
one
of
the
feet
in
proportion
to
a
minifig
to
give
you
a
general
size
this
is
luke
skywalker
swinging
on
a
wire
trying
to
destroy
the
atat
i
really
wish
lego
didnt
make
so
many
lukes
because
i
want
differnt
minifigs
it
would
also
be
nice
for
a
thermal
detonator
piece
underneath
the
atat
you
can
see
the
shaft
that
moves
the
back
legs
the
motor
and
squeezed
in
on
the
righ
t
the
massive
battery
box
a
load
of
cogs
that
move
the
legs
these
are
the
included
figures
snowtrooper
general
maximilian
veers
atat
driverpilot
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
him
and
luke
all
whithout
there
wepons
please
note
veers
should
have
a
dark
stone
snowtroooper
torso
with
4
red
and
blue
badge
things
not
3
these
are
the
figures
with
weapons
i
gave
them
and
the
included
ones
snowtrooper
has
new
style
blaster
veers
has
standard
light
grey
pistol
like
the
ones
from
the
old
adventure
sets
atat
driver
has
old
style
blaster
which
i
call
heavy
blaster
and
luke
has
shiny
handle
blue
light
sabre
the
shiny
blue
light
sabre
was
included
with
the
set
which
is
a
bonus
because
i
really
dont
like
the
grey
ones
httpwwwbrickshelsc00521jpgjpg
this
is
the
switch
which
is
attached
to
the
battery
box
on
either
side
of
the
atat
underneath
the
lift
up
side
panels
you
push
the
forward
to
walk
forward
and
backward
to
walk
backwards
simple
eh
a
front
veiw
with
the
the
panels
open
here
are
the
drivers
controls
which
are
simply
a
cotrol
panel
and
2
exoforce
robot
hands
which
are
joystick
things
seen
in
the
film
if
you
look
closley
the
almost
useless
carry
handle
this
is
the
weird
back
piece
looking
down
the
atat
from
the
back
where
you
can
see
the
the
battery
box
and
switch
troops
decending
from
ropes
and
cables
and
vader
leading
the
assult
for
this
i
hadnt
got
any
more
imps
so
i
used
clones
pilots
i
now
have
a
whole
load
more
snowtroopers
solo
and
chewie
sabotaging
more
troops
to
squash
rebel
scum
huzahh
a
very
bad
picture
of
everyone
packed
up
inside
the
size
incomparison
to
its
predecessor
overall
i
would
give
this
set
910
because
it
should
come
with
more
snowtroopers
or
it
could
be
and
endor
version
with
loads
of
strormies
and
scout
troopers
aswell
as
this
you
can
really
sit
any
one
down
because
of
the
battery
box
but
i
stilll
find
space
to
put
all
the
shown
figures
on
this
review
in
the
interior
as
you
can
see
on
the
above
image
the
chains
and
ropes
are
hanging
down
a
bit
tjis
set
is
now
limited
to
5
per
customer
in
the
uk
and
now
no
longer
comes
with
free
batteries
the
walking
on
this
is
a
bit
wonky
and
dosent
really
walk
like
they
do
in
the
film
as
it
moves
two
legs
at
a
time
i
am
currently
attaching
a
motor
to
the
head
to
make
it
move
independently

have
the

atat

i
like

lot
considered
buying
this
one

it

i
never

lets
start
the
reivew
of
the
ucs
death
star
ii
now
this
is
an
older
set
2005
and
ive
only
gotten
around
to
buying
it
a
short
while
ago
it
took
me
around
2
evenings
to
build
it
and
i
must
say
that
i
am
fairly
impressed
by
this
set
time
for
a
box
pic
the
build
since
i
started
building
this
huge
small
moon
size
set
at
mortens
appartment
i
wanted
to
keep
as
few
polybags
open
at
any
given
time
as
possible
with
this
set
it
is
actually
possible
to
have
a
minimum
of
bricks
scattered
over
a
table
or
two
while
building
not
sure
why
but
the
division
of
bricks
in
the
different
polybags
just
work
very
well
and
that
is
great
with
a
set
this
size
3441
bricks
the
building
of
the
set
is
divided
into
several
build
this
times
x
for
example
the
upper
and
lower
part
of
the
unshielded
ds
are
completely
alike
this
is
difficult
to
see
when
looking
at
the
model
but
heaven
when
building
it
and
this
is
how
they
solved
the
problem
of
having
the
wings
connected
to
the
buttom
of
the
death
star
geniously
done
imo
note
that
in
the
first
pic
the
skeleton
is
easily
seen
the
skeleton
holds
the
x
to
which
both
the
upper
and
lower
part
is
clicked
on
with
technic
pins
also
theres
a
steering
wheel
im
sure
theres
a
pirate
name
for
that
like
the
one
in
the
bottom
in
the
top
of
the
model
to
hold
the
upside
wings
so
after
having
build
duplicate
wings
upper
and
lower
the
belt
all
the
way
around
the
star
and
the
upper
and
lower
part
of
the
unshielded
side
it
was
time
to
step
back
and
watch
the
death
star
ii
in
all
its
glory
such
a
great
ucs
set
now
i
did
have
a
few
huhs
during
the
build
huh
1
in
the
instruction
the
technic
lesserdragonhead
should
be
dark
grey
but
i
got
it
in
light
gray
go
figure
and
thank
you
replacement
parts
ive
experienced
this
before
and
apparently
tlg
uses
different
colours
when
outofstock
all
one
has
to
do
is
call
them
and
ask
for
the
right
colour
and
its
on
its
way
still
a
huh
experience
huh
2
again
it
appears
that
tlg
changed
the
design
of
the
technic
axleholed
1x2
bricks
the
bottom
has
changed
and
i
got
the
set
where
it
was
mixed
up
between
old
and
new
version
not
that
annoying
but
still
got
me
perplexed
as
to
am
i
doing
this
right
kinda
stressing
to
consider
taking
most
of
the
star
apart
to
check
the
remaining
231
technic
bricks
1x2
with
axlehole
now
for
a

1

i
must

you
did
a

job

reviewing
it
but
overall
i
hate
the
set
probably
the
worst
ucs
set
so
far
apart
from
the
naboo
fighter
but
that
hardly
even
counts
as
ucs
from
my
experience
unless
you
really
really
want
it
and
have
nothing
better
to
spent
your
on
in
that
case
go
for
it
but
in
my
case
it
was
a
very
repetitive
build
and
final
model
was
quite
well
bland
not
must
variety
to
it
if
you
know

great
review
kimt
i
like
this
set
even
if
i
don
´
t
own
it
because
it
looks
simple
fantastic
to
display
i
just
have
one
question
the
mini
executor
can
be
moved
around
the
death
star
ii
or
its
attached
to
that
place
thanks
for
the
review
its
attached
to
the
ds
and
can
not
move
as
such
though
there
is
4
spots
where
it
can
be
attached
to
the
ds
reading
your
comments
on
this
set
i
can
see
why
tlg
has
been
forced
to
put
it
on
sale
on
the
us
sh
i
dont
agree
that
the
isd
is
better
imho
theyre
exactly
them
same
big
and
grey
this
is
a
question
of
personal
liking
which
is
the
coolest
ds
or
isd
not
comparative
id
still
call
this
an
ok
ucs
when
looking
at
it
individually
but
there
sure
is
a
lot
other
ucs
sets
that
would
get
a
better
score
than

for

i
dont

decided
to

this

because
i
just
got
this
set
today
i
dont
really
have
a
concern
over
the
design
or
repeating
build
process
because
owning
this
set
was
never
an
option
for
me

i
collect

i
am
surprised
to
see
an
almost
total

welcome
this
is
my
first
review
so
contstructive
critisism
is
very
much
appreciated
on
to
the
review
first
we
start
out
with
the
box
the
box
art
is
the
same
as
always
since
2006
nothing
special
then
we
start
the
build
the
build
is
fairly
easy
and
will
take
the
seasoned
builder
about
1520
min
to
complete
here
is
the
finished
model
and
birds
eye
view
as
you
can
see
this
ship
is
very
sleek
the
fins
or
wings
each
have
an
outer
slope
and
an
inner
one
with
the
guns
in
between
there
are
also
cones
on
the
front
of
the
fins
which
give
the
ship
an
even
more
sleek
look
in
the
middle
of
the
wings
there
is
the
main
body
with
a
big
slope
and
stripes
decorating
it
this
set
has
a
very
good
playability
factor
as
im
about
to
show
you
now
the
guns
on
the
ship
are
pretty
cool
looking
to
begin
with
a
bley
slope
attaching
a
lightsaber
hilt
and
a
transneon
green
stud
to
the
fin
on
each
side
but
theres
more
than
what
meets
the
eye
yes
the
guns
flip
up
and
they
can
flip
all
the
way
back
to
hide
them
for
whatever
case
they
need
hiding
lets
have
a
look
at
the
back
there
is
a
tail
fin
used
as
landing
gear
and
some
lightspeed
boosters
but
wait
the
tail
fin
can
flip
up
for
flight
thanks
to
a
hinge
attached
to
the
back
of
the
cockpit
heres
another
playability
factor
the
cockpit
can
slide
open
very
smoothly
and
easily
heres
how
this
is
possible
a
clever
system
under
the
hood
allows
the
cockpit
to
open
see
those
two
bley
pieces
on
the
black
ones
those
bley
ones
attach
to
the
tan
plates
under
the
hood
and
the
hood
and
windsheild
attach
to
the
black
peices
the
black
and
bley
pieces
work
together
as
a
sliding
system
so
the
cockpit
opens
viola
and
then
the
cockpit
snaps
in
place
thanks
to
the
red
hook
and
clip
its
a
very
accurate
system
and
works
very
well
youll
want
to
open
and
close
it
over
and
over
again
now
finnaly
to
the
fig
the
general
himself
a
very
impressive
fig
with
a
new
head
and
torso
mold
in
this
set
which
is
one
of
only
two
with
greivous
in
it
he
comes
with
2
green
and
two
blue
lightsabers
all
with
bley
hilts
i
was
hoping
for
chrome
hilts
but
its
a
minor
fault
grievous
also
comes
with
a
new
mold
pistol
blaster
not
pictured
heres
the
general
in
the
cockpit
sadly
a
weak
cockpit
no
details
he
just
half
lays
down
on
a
small
slope
in
this
set
he
doesnt
come
with
a
cape
beacuse
with
it
on
the
cockpit
doesnt
close
thats
about
it
heres
the
final
verdict
build
710
fairly
easy
but
fun
a
little
bit
weak
playability
810
many
playability
factors
but
some
are
boring
or
pointless
swooshability
810
very
fun
to
fly
around
sometimes
pieces
break
off
minifigs
1010
one
amazing
fig
with
4
lightsabers
and
a
new
blaster
what
more
could
you
ask
for
design
910
very
sleek
but
hardly
any
real
texture
i
like
it
but
others
might
want
greebling
price
1010
overall
score
910
a
very
cool
ship
with
a
very
cool
minifig
and
accessories
one
of
the
best
sw
sets
i
have
ever
seen
for
its
small
price
i
highly
recommend
it
to
any
kind
of
sw
lego

you

i

about

why

the

review
york
neutral
thanks
for
the
review
bearing
in
mind
that
the
whole
point
of
this
set
is
to
get
a
cheap
troll
warrior
i
actually
quite
like
it
the
cart
isnt
brilliant
but
for
13
pieces
its
not
that
bad
the
troll
fig
is
great
as
always
and
i
guess
the
rats
are
always
nice
to
get
not
so
much
in
real
life
though
the
sets
that
contain
the
trolls
have
a
fairly
solid
number
each
i
mean
tower
raid
has
three
but
nevertheless
i
think
i
may
have
to
pick
up
a
few

its
a
good
review
but
you
forgot
another
thing
the
troll
needs
a
shiled
like
they
used
to
in
the
2007
castle
line
the
sets
always
had
shields
for
the
minifigs

it
could
be
better
if
it
was
300
instead
of
350
but
yes
it
is
a
good
impulse

army

affordable

of

said
why
is
mouse
friendlier
than
rat
well
mouse
sounded
more
friendly
because
it
can
associate
with
tom
and
jerry
but
calling
it
a
rat
equal
calling
it
a
pest
its
just
a
matter
of
putting
it
in
different
terms
thats
all
edit
instead
of
posting
another
post
to
explain
why
i
used
mouse
i
will
write
it
here
tom
and
jerry
is
reflected
as
a
cartoon
children
associate
jerry
as
a
mouse
since
its
supposed
to
be
heartwarming
and
make
us
laugh
in
real
life
there
are
many
different
pets
we
raised
one
of
the
possible
pets
we
considered
is
a
mouse
mouse
are
supposed
to
be
shy
and
friendly
creatures
that
live
in
harmony
while
rats
lived
in
packs
hunt
food
in
the
dark
and
is
widely
regarded
as
a
pest
in
this
review
i
am
trying
to
illustrate
rat
and
associate
it
with
mouse
by
presenting
it
in
a
much
friendly
approach
there
is
no
right
or
wrong
answer
its
just
making
use
of
different
words
to
represent
how
i
feel
towards
a
particular
thing

to

it
is
to
clean
the

on

after
a
new

countdown
it
seemed
the
cleaning
agency
have
a
new
equipment
to
use
its
not
as
big
as
the
previous
street
sweeper
machine
the
cleaner
will
need
to
operate
the
equipment
manually
by
pushing
it
look
at
the
mess
after
sorting
out
look
at
the
pieces
offered
its
not
a
very
complicated
set
since
its
an
impulse
set
there
are
some
pretty
useful
parts
lying
around
such
as
the
broom
spade
however
i
was
quite
surprised
when
i
could
not
find
the
lid
of
the
rubbish
bin
i
cant
used
this
rubbish
bin
to
place
it
around
my
town
without
a
lid
on

of
it
i
believed
it
is
not
a
norm
by
not
including
the
lid
look
at
that
bin
well
that
rubbish
bin
seem
to
be
containing
his
equipment
in
it
instead
of
the
rubbish
the
cleaners
face
looks
pretty
sad
i
think
he
wants
to
have
a
change
of
job
front
view
i
love
that
blue
brush
very
much
quite
fun
to
play
with
especially
pushing
the
rubbish
aside
thats
why
a
spade
is
there
to
help
him
to
dig
out
the
litter
and
the
broom
to
brush
it
away
ok
now
i
know

making
me
want
to
build
one
of
the

might
do
that
today
actually
cheap
good
pieces
despite
the
lack
of
a

thats
just
inviting

isnt
it
nice
fig
and
one
of
those
blue
brushes
which
ive
always
loved
but
never
managed
to
use
the

looks
lovely
and
i
hope
you
managed
to
restore
it
indeed
a

you
for

i
have

the

is
nice

i
didnt
have
this

so
i
will
pick
up
one
some

wow
what
a
great
little

i
relly
dig
the

this

wonderful

coast
guard
kayak
is
the
best
looking
set
in
my
opnion
the
kayak
design
is
very
simple
but
looks
realistic
furthermore
if
you
dont
need
it
to
be
a
coast
guard
kind
of
stuff
use
it
as
a
leisure
water
spot
instead
down
in
the
marina
i
will
think
any
lego
citizen
will
love
to
have
some
water
spot
in
their
busy
life
so
come
down
here
and
wind
down
with
this
new

kayak
and
the
bouy
the
bouy
is
very
useful
to
position
it
at
the
coast
of
your
water
to
highlight
the
boundaries
in
the
sea
and
warning
incoming
ships
or
vessels
oh
i
did
not
make
it
tilted
purposely
there
is
a
white
round
base
which
allow
it
to
tilt
on
both
ends
useful
parts
these
parts
are
useful
to
add
on
in
your
city
somehow
when
i
see
that
red
cone
i
can
use
it
as
a
police
stop
to
inspect
vehicles
on
the
road
or
form
a
barricade
with
it
the
bouy
base
shape
is
unique
too
i
like
it
very
much
it
is
great
to
attached
it
by
the
side
of
the
boat
as
a
life
bouy
the
coast
guards
life
vest
and
helmet
are
very
useful
for
water
activites
the
life
vest
was
produced
in
past
sets
and
now
it
resurfaced
again
i
am
glad
these
vests
made
their
way

simply
attracted
me
for

i
only
owned
its

none

this

has
the

around

well
i

not

it

kimt

am
i
seeing

the

is
no
it
has
double

combined
the

to

two
facial

love
the
way
how
the

bend

the
only
thing
i
find
it
a
little
bit
wierd
for
spacecraft
normally
i
thought
joystick
is
the
typical
navigation
controls
for
a
spacecraft
instead
of
a
steering
wheel
i
am
not
complaining
about
a
steering
wheel
in
a

to
me
its
quite
an
uncommon
sight
anyway

review
by
sveltecorps
i
am
not
a
very
big
fan
of
agents
but
this
theme
defintely
offer
plenty
of
useful
parts
this
volcano
base
is
simply
fanastic
for
parts
usage
especially
in
doing
up
landscaping
with
mountains
by
making
use
of
the
brown
burps
i
must
admit
that
the
exterior
looks
real
cool
but
the
interior
looks
rather
empty
these
orange
slopes
certainly
make
a
great
illustration
of
the
larva
which
gives
the
agents
a
hard
time
to
infiltrate
within
its
compound
to
save
his
comrade
i
am
quite
sure
this
set
will
defintely
attracts
lots
of
kids
to
coax
their
parents
to
buy
it
since
the
bright
colors
will
defintely
caught
their
attention
with
all
those
hitech
sleek
weaponary
i
am
sure
this
is
the
next
big
thing
for
kids
out
there
well
i
am
not
sure
if
this
theme
works
for
me
as
well

this

defintely
works
well

project
positive
thanks
for
another
great
review
i
definitely
like
this
set
sure
the
interior
might
be
a
bit
bare
but
i
think
that
the
outside
of
the
base
with
all
of
the
great
lava
and
rocks
more
than
makes
up
for
it
it
is
a
bit
weird
that
on
the
one
side
there
is
nothing
on
the
inside
but
thats
easy
to
fix
anyone
know
when
this

minuets
for
the
seasoned
builder
an
overview
of
the
infiltrator
also
know
as
the
scimitar
as
seen
in
the
picture
this
ship
is
very
sleek
with
very
few
studs
on
top
snot
studs
not
on
top
basically
its
the
cockpit
with
two
wings
with
two
fins
on
each
wing
attached
to
the
hull
heres
a
side
view
of
the
scimitar
very
cool
looking
it
lands
on
two
feet
in
the
front
while
the
cockpit
rests
on
the
ground
rear
view
the
back
the
outer
cockpit
is
beautiful
a
printed
piece
on
the
back
no
dreaded
sticker
sheet
dss
and
a
large
printed
disc
on
top
heres
a
look
at
the
middle
there
is
a
flickfire
missile
transred
cone
attach
to
technic
pin
on
the
inner
wing
a
transred
lightsaber
blade
in
the
back
of
the
hull
and
a
transred
lightsaber
blade
in
between
the
fins
on
either
side
all
of
those
lightsaber
blades
may
come
in
handy
hey
look
the
fins
open
from
the
wings
the
fins
open
due
to
double
hinges
on
each
fin
unfortunately
you
have
to
hold
the
ship
up
in
order
for
the
bottom
fins
to
open
now
lets
have
a
look
inside
the
cockpit
to
open
you
lift
the
back
printed
part
which
is
attached
to
the
printed
disc
on
top
which
is
attached
to
a
hinge
it
opens
pretty
smoothly
but
is
somewhat
loose
so
sometimes
it
closes
on
its
own
also
the
disc
isnt
secured
well
enough
to
the
door
and
often
breaks
off
even
with
the
smallest
movement
to
it
inside
there
is
an
elevated
control
panel
and
two
sliding
pieces
near
the
floor
this
ship
also
comes
with
a
small
speeder
bike
its
very
cleverly
built
and
is
a
really
neat
addition
see
that
clear
disc
on
the
bottom
it
fits
perfectly
into
the
sliding
pieces
in
the
cockpit
hmm
whats
this
a
hidden
compartment
now
this
was
a
very
cool
idea
by
tlg
a
secret
compartment
found
by
taking
off
the
top
slope
of
the
hull
contains
darth
mauls
weapons
and
tools
which
include
a
chrome
lightsaber
hilt
a
pair
of
electrobinouculars
and
three
probe
droids
a
closeup
of
a
probe
droid
just
a
plain
black
minifig
head
with
a
black
lever
on
top
finally
the
fig
darth
maul
in
the
flesh
plastic
a
good
fig
altogether
with
a
black
hood
and
lightsaber
blades
taken
from
the
ship
he
did
come
with
a
crisp
new
black
cape
packaged
in
a
small
white
cardboard
box
but
i
am
currently
using
it
for
another
fig
note
that
this
is
a
limited
edition
fig
so
stock
up
a
comparison
pic
of
the
two
mauls
the
2007
version
is
on
the
left
and
the
1999
version
on
the
right
note
a
few
key
differences
between
the
two
the
new
one
has
smaller
red
tattoos
and
a
smoother
torso
also
the
new
one
has
bigger
eyes
and
a
more
cartoony
look
maul
on
the
speeder
bike
of
course
he
fits
perfectly
in
the
cockpit
wile
sitting
on
the
bike
and
he
can
reach
the
controls
well
thats
about
it
here
is
the
final
verdict
build
810
easy
and
fun
breaks
every
once
in
a
while
playability
710
this
set
has
many
features
but
is
very
fragile
between
the
cockpit
and
hull
and
between
the
two
cockpit
pieces
swooshability
110
too
fragile
to
fly
around
plus
the
flick
fire
missiles
fall
out
minifigs
910
a
great
fig
with
a
chrome
hilt
and
a
double
sided
blade
a
little
cartoony
design
710
very
clever
techniques
very
sleek
but
very
fragile
price
810
fair
enough
could
be
a
few
dollars
cheaper
overall
score
6510
a
very
sleek
ship
with
clever
building
and
play
techniques
but
very
very
fragile
and
shouldnt
be
picked
up
off
of
the
shelf
too
often
and
with
that
my
review
is
over
but
all
of
yours
are
not
comments
and

i
wanted
to

one
of
this

seems
there
isnt
much
to
it
other
than
what
it
looks
like
in
the
official
pictures

i
may
well
get
it
i
like

neutral
great
review
rezourceman
your
pics
really
show
off
the
sub
well
and
its
good
to
see
the
build
in
progress
i
also
have
this
set
but
i
didnt
apply
stickers
to
the
sub
as
i
was
planning
to
reuse
the
nice
dark
blue
pieces
however
as
shown
in
your
review
they
do
brighten
it
up
a
fair
bit
i
cant
say
this
is
my
favourite
agents
set
the
boat
is
a
little
oddly
proportioned
and
the
sub
although
retro
looking
has
practically
no
interior
and
would
be
difficult
to
customise
to
put
more
in
unlike
say
the
clever
job
batbrick
did
with
the
penguin
sub
in
his
review
the
sub
kind
of
looks
like
some
jules
verneish
sea
creature
i
would
have
liked
it
if
theyd
gone
all
the
way
and
made
it
some
kind
of
giant
robot
jellyfish
or
squid
i
do
agree
with
you
about
slime
face
he
has
a
fantastic
torso
with
all
the
slime
dripping
down
which
is
a
bit
obscured
by
the
air
tank
its
really
encouraging
that
in
the
last
2
missions
weve
had
great
extra
villains
added
in
the
only
thing
i
would
add
about
the
octopus
is
that
the
glow
in
the
dark
plastic
is
mixed
in
unevenly
with
the
aqua
blue
so
it
doesnt
glow
in
the
dark
evenly
its
kind
of
like
the
mars
mission
jellies
in
that
respect
though
much
cooler

is
it

just
very
hard
to

nothing
is
impossible
to
mod
probably
the
easiest
part
to
change
would
be
the
front
where
the
missiles
are
and
the
treasure
chest
slides
out
you
could
make
a
sizeable
compartment
there
however
the
middle
section
is
so
narrow
and
the

it

the

sounds
great

for
that
is
he

im
guessing
hes
a
mutant

about
slime
face
is
his
head
much
different
to
the
joker

i
know
he
has
slime
marks
on
his
head
are
they
very
apparent
its
not
really
clear
but
since
all
the
other
mutants
are
evil
or
at

controlled
by
dr
inferno
its
probably
a
safe
bet
the
squid
is
too
slime
faces
head
is
different
to
the
joker
bombs
different
eyes
and

although
the
smile
is
similar

guess

the

are
much
more

wow
thanks
for
the

think
we
need

new

so
many
inferno
minifigures
now
maybe
next
year
theres
only
2
infernos
out
of
8
sets
which
is
pretty
good
theres
way
more
agent
chases
and
break
jaws
i
agree
though
next
year
hopefully
well
have
some
new
figs

great
looking

this
6927
is

kinds

harsh

the
6
big
wheels
are

solid

firm
back
in

is
wonderful
i
just
love
these
parts
especially
when
its
in

4
computer
printed

arent
lego
so
generous
back
in
those
days
when
printed
parts
are
more
commonly
available
unlike
now
its
a
real
nice
set
however
there
is
one
thing
i
dont
understand
about
this
design
why
is
the
driver
seat
has
a
wide
back
with
no
cover
behind
and
the
command
center
has
no
door
at
the
back
i
understand
that
these
space
guys
are
always
carrying
their
helmet
around
for
oxygen
supply
i
wonder
if
there
is
a
better
answer
to
it

i
dont
understand
about
this
design
why
is
the
driver
seat
has
a
wide
back
with
no
cover
behind
and
the
command
center
has
no
door
at
the
back
i
understand
that
these
space
guys
are
always
carrying
their
helmet
around
for
oxygen
supply
i
wonder
if
there
is
a
better
answer
to
it
yes
the
extra
space
was
probably
for
the
oxygen
tanks
on
the
figs
it
makes
taking
them
off
a
lot
easier
as
for
the
labcontrol
center
i
never
had
an
issue
with
it
being
open
i
think
this
was
just
for
playability
one
could
always
pretend
that
some
sort
of
invisible
force
ray
closed
the
side
when
activated
great
comments
i
love
hearing
what
others
think
of
these
classics
positive
oh
man
this
review
takes
me
back
i
got
this
set
when
i
was
8
years
old
and
loved
it
i
remember
modding
it
to
remove
the
lab
in
the
back
and
i
put
in
a
giant
laser
cannon
instead
cause
when
youre
8
years
old
everything
needs
a
giant
laser
cannon

said
the
only
bad
thing
about
this
set
is
the
name
it
cant
even
roll
over
a
single
plates
height
not
very
all
terrain
at
all
ha
very
true
the
vehicle
is
built
so
low
to
the
ground
that
the
front
end
catches
on
everything

great
buy
on
this
one
what
did
it
cost
you
it
was
30
which
was
a
pretty
good
price
given
the
condition
it
had
no
box
or
instructions
though
this
set
is
actually
fairly
common
on
ebay
though
considering
how
old
it
is
i
see
them
pretty
frequently
on
there
quote
its
a
real
nice
set
however
there
is
one
thing
i
dont
understand
about
this

why

i

was
just
curious
about
the
design
as
i
am
not
very
familar
with
classic
space
i
supposed
the
oxygen
tanks
is
quite
big
to
carry
around
especially
when
the
vehicle
is
so
cramped
these
allowance
of
space
makes
them
much
mobile
to
move
about
in
the

you
modify
the

where
is

neutral
ive
always
associated
this

with
6929
the
voyager
theyre
of
the
same
timeframe
and
more
or
less
the
same
style
6927
is
without
any
doubt
my
favourite
ground
vehicle
of
space
it
was
pretty
simple
but
it
was
such
a
creative
set
the
stories
you
could
tell
with
this
model
g
most
defenitely
in
my

5
of

positive
this
set
never
got
me
as
a
kid
i
suspect
it
was
because
of
the
wheels
i
had
mostly
basic
sets
so
it
would
have
been
more
of
the
same
looking
at
it
now
i
can
see
i
have
misjudged
it
and
i
love
the
lablift
method
im
going
to
have
to
build
this
to
see
it
in
action

i
modified
my
allterrain

as
well
in
a
similar
way
but
just
slightly
more
modified
from
the
original
i
call
it

6927w

i
wanted
to
make
a
combat
variant
of
6927
so
i
used
the
6927c
improved
class
as
the
starting
point
and
went
from
there
i
added
a
completely
new
forwardcab
close
to
the
ground
for
a
groundobserver
to
monitor
the
terrain
i
added
even
larger
wheels
allowing
this
variant
to
truly
be
all

besides
what
good
is
it
having
a
combat
vehicle
if
it
gets
stuck
in
the
middle
of
a
firefight
the
6927w
has
a

also

yeah
first
time
that
i
am
getting
a
set
before
everyone
first
of
all
the
package
the
european
version
has
no
limited
edition
button
hooray
sorry
for
the
blurry
backshot
we
see
the
hospital
back
a
few
bubbles
with
set
functions
and
a
little
comic
comic
bubbles
the
figures
are
injured

patrick
and
the
new
fish
doctor
spongebob
has
a
headprint
and
a
backprint
other
than
the
normal
spongebob
spongebob
and
injured
bob
the
set
comes
with
two
litters
the
ambulance
car
is
a
bit
extraordinary
i
don
´
t
know
how
the
car
is
like
in
the
show
and
i
saw
a
lot
of
episodes
but
it
looks
a
bit
strange
mostly
because
the
weehls
are
too
small
of
course
we
get
another
ss
not
so
d
this
time
the
litter
fits
in
the
back
with
help
of
this
lid
i
wish
it
would
be
the
hingelid
from
before
2004
now
we
come
to
the
meanpart
of
the
set
the
hospital
the
entrance
has
got
babyblue
traindoors
and
a
hudge
sign
that
shows
emergency
the
tubes
are
nearly
everywhere
in
this
set
i
was
getting
insane
when
i
came
to
the
part
where
i
must
put
the
stickers
on
the
tubes
this
parts
are
very
usefull
but
i
wanted
that
the
set
looks
good
because
i
will
display
it
so
i
stickered
just
two
of
the
parts
and
not
all
four
now
we
come
to
the
interroir
the
doctor
has
a
desk
with
computer
sadly
it
´
s
not
very
well
placed
and
he
must
duck
because
of
his
fin
next
to
the
door
we
get
this
little
case
wash
basin
and
two
drawers
again
we
get
stickers
not
that
i
don
´
t
like
stickers
it
´
s
just
everytime
i
get
to
the
part
where
i
must
put
the
stickers
on
i
think
how
i
can
reuse
the
model
and
if
i
rebuild
the
model
later
and
and
and
i
hate
it
to
deside
a
few
posters
are
in
it
too
the
set
is
a
great
addittion
to
your
own
bikino
bottom
but
the
playability
is
not
very
big
for
the
kids
they
can
just
play
that
patrick
steals
the
ambulance
car
like
shown
on
the
package
and
is
hitting
spongebob
than
the
drive
back
the
doctor
gives
spongebob
two
medicines
and
let
him
go
i
bought
the
set
mostly
because
of
the
parts
tubes
in
lightbley
and
a
few
woodpieces
but
i
am
thinking
about
let
it
stand
in
my

i
like

theres

great
pieces

for

thanks
for
the
great
review

i
recently
bought
this
set
for
my
daughters
birthday
its
the
first
belville
set
that
ive
bought
for
her
so
its
a
bit
of
an
experiment
the
house
is
5
rooms
and
its
made
up
of
mostly
large
pieces
there
still
is
a
decent
amount
of
normal
lego
in
it
though
the
doorways
in
the
house
align
when
it
is
opened
out
starting
with
the
bathroom
included
is
a
shower
toilet
sink
with
vanity
and
a
baby
potty
the
mirror
sticker
is
one
of
the
few
that
i
put
on
the
open
plan
loungekitchendining
room
is
well
appointed
as
well
and
it
has
a
nice
glass
table
and
coffee
machine
the
kitchen
chairs
are
fabuland
parts
and
dont
work
really
well
it
seems
they
are
having
jellyfish
for
dinner
the
clock
is
the
only
printed
part
in
the
set
upstairs
is
a
baby
room
and
the
master
bedroom
the
radio
and
the
tv
not
shown
were
stickers
to
my
disappointment
up
top
is
an
extra
room
suitable
for
reading
those
antenna
things
were
made
from
spare
parts
by
my
daughter
i
have
no
idea
what
they
are
supposed
to
be
there
are
some
stickers
that
go
on
the
back
but
i
didnt
put
them
on
as
it
is
the
set
looks
ok
this
way
but
since
it
is
a
dolls
house
it
doesnt
really
matter
i
do
think
though
that
the
fireplace
should
have
been
given
a
back
the
bbq
is
made
from
normal
parts
and
is
quite
effective
i
think
it
uses
the
same
light
brick
thats
in
the
4998
stegosaurus
set
my
kids
were
using
it
as
a
torch
before
my
grumbling
ruined
their
fun
like
all
belville
sets
the
highlight
is
arguably
the
accessories
ill
be
borrowing
a
few
of
these
from
time
to
time
here
is
the
controversial
baby
catapult
as
you
can
see
it
works
ok
but
lego
probably
should
have
tried
a
bit
harder
we
also
bought
for
her
7583
playful
puppy
it
also
comes
with
some
nice
accessories
but
not
enough
to
justify
buying
unless
you
want
the
rest
of
the
parts
poor
puppy
where
does
he
sleep
here
is
my
daughter
assembling
it
she
made
me
make
the
house
though
as
she
wanted
to
play
a
game
we
bought
her
note
the
lego
drink
bottles
i
didnt
take
any
photos
of
the
figures
as
they
dont
seem
to
be
anything
new
but
i
can
if
people
want
me
to
at
the
time
i
was
in
bit
of
a
hurry
as
i
took
these
before
bed
so
i
wouldnt
be
stressed
if
the
kids
broke
it
the
next
day
overall
these
sets
seem
overpriced
to
me
and
hard
to
justify
unless
you
actually
want
a
buildable
dolls
house
which
we
did
its
still
too
early
to
tell
if
my
daughter
likes
it
or
not
but
at
this
stage
it
seems
she
lost
interest
in
a
few
days
she
does
tend
to
go
back
to
toys
though

am
positive
great
review
and
i
note
something
like
a
bucket
in
the
dog
set
shame
its
not
blue
as
for
the
fire
place
piece
i
love
it
and
i
want
one
ever
since
finding
it
on
mlcad
i
love
the
bbq
it
looks
so
good
you
know
i
might
even
buy
this
it
it
was
not
so
pink
now
as
for
the
kiddies
in
ovens
make
sure
they
are
not
over
cooked
they
can
be
stringy
and
as
for
the
couple
up
stairs
now
we
at
least
know
what
you
do
with
your
mini
figs
when
no
one
is
looking
lego
sets
in
public
places
just
following
your
name
sake
i
guess
and
i
must
say
lego
shame
shame
that
catapult
needs
reviwing
hardly
even
make
a
dent
in
a
castle
wall

cpt

positive
the
lego
lives

that

whats
that

doing
on
the

underneath

am
said
obviously
it
really
is
all
about
the
accessories
and
its
got
em
but
not
enough
to
make
me
spend
that
kind
of
cash
and
i
dont
even
mind
having
a
pile
of
pink
parts
around
i
agree
a
lot
of
the
pieces
are
good
but
i
dont
think
i
would
get
it
however
i
do
think
i
will
get
the
set
with
the
dogs
so
my
minifigs
can
have

i
would
buy
a
playfull
puppy
it
has
nice
pieces

the
puppy
can
also
be
used
for
minifigs
as
a
big
dog

havent

sinner
you
know
i
had
never
seen
a
belville
set
in
any
review
with
such
great
pictures
before
i
just
cant
take
my
eyes
off
in
the
master
bedroom
the
scene
is
quite
a
little
hot
enough
of
me
peeping
up
there
lets
take
a
look
at
the
interior
i
am
very
surprised
by
its
construction
of
the
house
its
quite
big
and
is
nice
of
you
to
buy
a
great
sweet
gift
for
your
daughter
i
am
very
sure
she
will
enjoyed
playing
with
it
somehow
it
reminded
me
of
barbie
doll
products
maybe
its
too
pinkish
for
me
the
accessories
is
the
plus
factor
in
any
belville
sets
it
offered
quite
a
handful
of
great
accessories
to
add
into
any
types
of
mocs
construction
to
add
in
the
plus
factor
in
it
sinner
you
are
a
very
nice
dad
i
like
how
parents
buy
educational
toys
for
their
children
to
expand
their
imaginations
instead
of
sitting
in
a
couch
playing
video
games
and
etc

aw
sinners

great
review
the
set
is
good
for
parts
it
appears
and
that
bedroom
scene
isinteresting
positive
thanks
for
your
report
and
the
pics
my
sister
wants
this
set
but
shes
already
got
the
last
house
and
she
doesnt
play
very
often
with
it
but
the
new
one
looks
very
good
too
positive
im
confused
the
finale
of
big
brother
australia
was
last
week
so
why
only
now
are
we
seeing
pictures
of
housemates
brigette
and
ben
performing
a
striptease
and
where
is

im
still
undecided
on
if
it
was
a
smart
buy
she
played
with
it
a
lot
this
week
but
last
week
she
ignored
it
and
i
had
to
fix
it
twice
my
daughter
is
12
and
she
still
plays
with
all
her
belville
stuff
mostly
the
fairy
princess
castle
sets
if
your
daughter
is
anything
like
mine
you
will
definitely
get
your
moneys
worth
out
of
it
however
as
soon
as
my
daughter
says
shes
done
with
it
i
plan
on
raiding
the
sets
for
all
those
great
food
and
accessory
bits
patience
great
review
by
the
way
the
belville
sets
are
indeed
overpriced
but
theyre
probably
legos
best
attempt
at
wooing
the
girl
audience
i
still
hate
the
fact
that
tlc
thinks
they
need
separate
boy
themes
and
girl
themes
but
whatever
theyre
a
very
nice
alternative
to
barbie
you
get
posable
figures
with
realistic
body
proportions
plus
some
creativity
and
building
aspects
thrown
in
positive
i
bought
this
today
mainly
because
it
was
25
off
but
id
been
eyeing
it
for
a
long
time
the
accessories
truly
are
brilliant
theres
so
much
here
to
be
pillaged
for
other
uses
as
people
have
said
i
picked
up
heaps
of
new
parts
ive
never
had
or
rare
ones
in
even
rarer
colours
to
be
honest
i
was
surprised
and
impressed
by
the
range
and
versatility
of
the
regular
bricks
as
well
when
you
look
at
the
box
art
what
jumps
out
at
you
are
the
giant
pink
walls
and
curved
pieces
but
theres
a
nice
amount
of
white
arches
and
lime
green
bricks
not
to
mention
all
the
windows
and
the
trans
blue
1x2x5
bricks
and
plants
its
a
good
thing
the
target
audience
likes
stickers
though
theres
more
here
than
ive
seen
on
any
set
except
the
7709
sentai
fortress
i
think
they
were
aiming
for
one
sticker
per
page
of
instructions
i
hope
belville
returns
in
2010

i

one
more
in

there
are
like
three
in

with
a
high
price

will
keep

hi
everybody
and
welcome
to
my
fourth
review
on
eurobricks
today
i
will
review
the
droid
bttle
pack
set
note
this
set
originally
came
with
four
megaphone
blasters
for
each
battle
droid
but
i
replaced
them
along
with
the
crooked
arms
with
the
new
blaster
pistols
and
new
twisted
arms
a
picture
of
the
box
as
it
is
on
the
shelves
of
majorretail
stores
a
small
box
as
expected
for
inexpensive
sets
like
these
note
the
build
your
army
button
on
the
front
tlg
obviously
is
encouraging
customers
to
buy
multiples
and
with
good
reason
which
will
be
explained
later
in
this
review
an
overview
of
the
sets
content
you
can
see
a
droid
carrying
vehicle
a
stap
and
some
battle
super
battle
droids
a
look
at
the
carrier
a
light
tank
note
the
guns
on
the
front
the
guns
and
cockpit
can
turn
a
little
bit
left
and
right
from
the
main
body
also
the
guns
can
move
up
and
down
free
from
the
cockpit
and
check
out
the
cockpit
two
2x1
center
studded
plates
side
by
side
for
the
pilot
to
stand
on
now
moving
on
to
the
stap
a
small
very
useful
vehicle
in
the
sw
universe
these
are
seen
frequently
in
both
the
movies
and
games
as
well
as
other
multimedia
the
design
is
very
clever
using
vertical
building
and
a
clear
stand
rear
view
the
guns
handlebars
can
go
this
far
back
and
finally
the
figs
the
figs
are
very
good
but
very
common
we
havent
seen
sbds
in
a
while
and
now
instead
of
metallic
blue
they
are
metallic
dark
grey
the
worst
part
of
this
set
is
that
the
battle
droids
have
the
old
arms
and
guns
while
the
droids
in
the
mtt
and
clone
pack
both
of
the
same
year
as
this
have
the
new
ones
i
wonder
why
tlg
decided
to
do
that
again
this
set
originally
came
with
four
megaphone
blasters
for
each
battle
droid
but
i
replaced
them
along
with
the
crooked
arms
with
the
new
blaster
pistols
and
new
twisted
arms
so
thats
about
it
heres
the
final
verdict
build
810
very
easy
should
take
the
seasoned
builder
about
510
minutes
playability
610
has
a
few
play
feature
but
nothing
exciting
is
good
for
mocs
and
army
building
swooshability
810
i
suppose
you
could
fly
around
the
stap
minifigs
710
the
battle
droids
are
good
but
very
common
and
the
dont
come
with
new
arms
or
guns
the
sbds
are
very
nice
and
in
a
new
color
all
figs
are
great
for
army
building
design
810
the
stap
was
clever
but
the
carrier
was
a
little
bulky
price
1010
as
fair
as
it
gets
overall
7510
the
figs
are
great
to
have
and
make
mocs
and
armies
and
the
vehicles
are
pretty
cool
the
carrier
is
a
little
lame
the
main
problem
with
this
set
is
that
the
bds
dont
get
the
new
guns
or
arms
so
they
dont
fit
in
with
all
the
new
sets
also
droids
arent
as
cool
as
clones
but
the
price
is
very
fair
and
now
my
review
has
ended
unfortunately
i
believe
this
will
be
my
last
review
for
a
long
time
for
two
reasons
one
the
remaining
sets
that
arent
done
according
to
kimts
index
i
either
dont
have
or
are
broken
or
have
missing
pieces
and
two
my
budget
is
low
right
now
and
i
wont
be
able
to
get
the
clone
wars
sets
right
when
they
are
released
so
someone
will
probably
beat
me
to
reviewing
them
too
bad
because
i
would
love
to
do
an
rgs
review
well
as
always

very
welcome

great
review
of
a
lovely
set
thank
you
sadly
i
dont
see
my
6641
really
often
because
it
is
kind
of
in
the
back
of
my
shelf
but
i
might
get
it
and
swoosh
it
a
few
times
imho
i
think
6675
is
a
little
bit
more
aggressive
cool
please
make
more
swoosh
it
around
i
will
prefer
to
use
it
to
vrooom
it
around
on
my
road

thanks
for
reminding
me
of
the

to

the
wheels
are
pretty
different
i
dont
remember
seeing
these
wheels
in
many
other
vehicles
maybe
some
members
can
help
me
on
this
first
of
all
another
great
review
thanks
for
doing
these
as
for
the
wheels
these
were
primarily
technic
wheels
but
did
find
their
way
into
some
other
models
in
white
i
can
only
find
a
handful
of
minifig
sets
that
they
are
included
with
theres
half
a
dozen
space
sets
but
apart
from
the
4wheelin
truck
the
only
other
town
set
appears
to
be
the
6524
blizzard
blazer
tractor
with
snow
plough
the
wheels
were
also
in
a
train
set
called
4549

hauler
where
they
were
the
wheels
on
a
big
forklift

neutral
hmmm
i
probably
would
not
have
bought
this
as
a
kid
in
1987
unless
i
had
money
to
spare
or
the
shop
had
no
other
set
from
space
or
castle
the
two
other
big
lines
in
1987
and
no
better
set
in
the
town
section
i
think
its
a
great
parts
pack
but
the
model
itself
does
not
look
very
attractive
i
never
really
liked
those
wheels
honestly
theyre
from
the
basic
sets
mostly
and
they
work
pretty
well
in
those
but
im
just
not
a
fan
the
roof
on
the
other
hand
was
very
popular
and
the
blue
modified
bricks
at
the
front
were
quite
rare
in
those
days
but
generally
speaking
this
was
not
the
star
of
1987
gave
it
a
3
negative

very
nice
just
to
share
some
information
with
you
guys
vestas
an
global
company
which
is
an
expert
in
wind
energy
this
is
a
tieup
with
lego
i
feel
its
an
illustration
on
how
our
world
will
benefit
by
applying
and
believing
its
technology
to
make
use
of
reuseable
natural
resources
hinckley

it
ok
for
me
to
share
a
picture
or
two
on
the

whats
so
great
about

do
agree

think
the
great
thing
about
the

its
very
reminiscent

classic

of

wow
id
completely
forgotten
about
this
theme
which
is
suprising
since
i
absolutely
loved
this
theme
as
a
kid
minus
the
sound
n
light
brick
which
i
thought
was
pretty
big
and
ugly
sure
brings
back
memories
of
looking
at
those
little
catalogue
booklets
that
came
with
the
sets
positive
i
had
never
seen
this
set
or
this
theme
before
it
was
released
during
my
dark
age
and
i
had
missed
it
its
nice
to
see
such
sets
surface
once
again
to
educate
members
like
me
that
there
are
some
good
sets
we
had
missed
during
the
dark
age
and
i
must
admit
that
this
is
a
very
good
set
its
comes
with
3
minifigs
and
staudie
with
it
geez
i
never
thought
he
was
an
astronaunt
back
then
the
testing
facility
is
great
and
i
love
to
see
it
spin
by
putting
staudie
in
it
for
a
testrun
the
buggy
is
cute
as
well
but
somehow
i
dont
really
like
the
white
frame
at
the
back
it
looked
a
little
odd
to
me
the
tools
are
simply
wonderful
to
have
furthermore
these
are
grey
tools
the
last
time
we
had
so
many
tools
are
the
aeroplane
mechanic
the
shuttle
is
nice
but
does
the
shuttle
supposed
to
come
with
a
cover
as
well
i
guess
since
this
is
a
simulator
they
must
have
cut
down
the
budget
for
it
the
control
room
is
good
and
it
will
be
even
better
with
chairs
included
metalandi
thanks

the
wonderful

thank
you
very
much

built
it
with
the
help
of
my
older
sister
i
loved
it
so
much
i
never
rebuilt
it
but
now
i
just
have
to
space

was
one
i
never
got

looks
to
be
a
great

ohwell
one
more

i
dont

they
go
idle
this
is
now
the
dino
attack
review
thread
what
jays
not
doing
viking
reviews
nope
i
think
christopher110
took
care
of
those
just
fine
instead
i
have
brought
you
what
is
most
possibly
the
highestanticipated
set
of
the
year
d
the
t1
typhoon
and
i
got
ta
say
dinos
apart
its
actually
really
cool
the
dinos
lets
get
the
worst
over
with
yes
those
are
all
the
parts
in
that
dino
negative
the
figs
theyre
possibly
the
best
part
of
the
entire
set
all
in
all
nice
new
head
although
the
glasses
limit
its
usability
i
am
in
love
with
the
head
on
that
fig
its
perfect
for
any
number
of
figures
a
good
scarred
hero
face
has
always
been
on
my
want
list
im
turning
him
into
my
viking
warlord
after
i
post
this
review
again
a
new
head
great
stubbly
beard
thing
going
on
my
secondfavorite
head
of
the
lot
great
for
warriors
especially
with
helms
the
torsos
are
fantastic
for
special
forces
figures
if
anyones
planning
to
do
something
like
that
not
too
fond
of
the
lime
green
on
there
but
its
still
extremely
usable
this
is
actually
a
really
cool
machine
gun
i
like
it
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
point
to
note
that
all
designs
you
see
outside
the
figures
and
dinos
are
stickers
that
means
a
crapload
of
stickers
if
you
cant
stand
stickers
at
all
in
a
set
dont
buy
this
positive
the
copter
this
is
one
bigass
copter
the
photos
really
dont
do
the
size
justice
lower
cockpit
with
cool
computer
too
bad
its
a
sticker
although
ill
definitely
leave
this
one
on
upper
cockpit
with
cool
computer
see
above
awesome
gatling
gun
yes
even
the
technic
beams
have
stickers
im
actually
really
fond
of
that
little
canister
thing
i
can
see
using
it
elsewhere
yes
thats
a
sticker
the
rope
and
hook
i
forgot
to
mention
it
before
this
set
comes
with
two
accessories
besides
the
machine
gun
binocs
and
one
of
those
little
things
to
slide
down
the
rope
also
the
thing
that
extends
the
rope
turns
the
other
side
because
theyre
slightly
asymmetrical
one
of
my
favorite
stickers
the
door
says
survival
equipment
its
on
both
sides
definitely
a
keeper
positive
the
base
of
the
propeller
it
wobbles
a
bit
but
doesnt
fall
off
very
sturdy
right
side
of
the
rear
propeller
and
the
left
and
better
side
the
tail
it
uses
construction
similar
to
the
xwings
nose
but
on
a
larger
scale
definitely
cool
a
very
neat
part
of
the
copter
the
guns
are
constructed
so
that
they
turn
without
turning
the
cockpit
the
interior
is
rather
blase
though
positive
another
of
my
favorite
parts
landing
gear
this
is
the
front
section
and
it
retracts
unlike
most
ships
with
landing
gear
this
does
not
retract
without
effort
coughxwingcough
very
sleek
the
back
landing
gear
and
again
smooth
retraction

love
it

dont

dont
like
any
set
with

youre
not
a
space
fan
buy
if
youre
a
space
fan
you
dont
mind
stickersdont
apply
them
youre
like
to
create
cool
figures
overall
i
think
it
was
worth
the
price
even
at
605
pieces
however
id
suggest
buying
vikings
even
considering
this
well
hope
this
review
unexpected
as
it
was
helped
someone
out
there
until
next
time

that
looks

a
really

i
dont

id
have
anywhere
to
put
it
i
dont
think
ill
ever
be
able
to
get
the
set
anyway

it
doesnt
come
out
over

well
have
to

line
is
going
to
be
made
available
in

check
out
the
official
dino
attack
site
here
neutral
yeah
i
picked
up
another
one
i
really
liked
the
chopper
lets
cut
straight
to
the
chase
dinos
first
the
worst
of
course
these
things
are
so
horrible
they
dont
deserve
more
than
one
photo
theyre
rubbery
one
piece
and
the
only
things
that
remotely
indicate
that
theyre
made
by
lego
are
the
holes
on
the
bottom
of
their
feet
theyre
unrealistic
to
an
extreme
unmatched
by
even
the
previously
reviewed
dinos
in
that
they
are
waaaaaaaay
too
thin
one
is
pink
and
theyre
all
grinning
fig
one
interesting
thing
to
note
is
that
this
one
has
the
same
torso
as
the
ironmasked
dude
in
the
chopper
not
his
own
barearms
torso
pic
for
the
sake
of
comparison
now
i
dont
consider
this
fig
as
good
as
the
others
because
the
other
heads
are
useful
for
vikings
and
assorted
castletype
people
but
this
has
sunglasses
all
in
all
youll
probably
find
it
useful
but
i
dont
still
great
torso
for
special
ops
stuff
hummer
those
headlights
while
stickers
yes
all
prints
are
again
stickers
although
there
are
much
less
than
the
chopper
are
great
pieces
i
can
see
using
them
as
furnace
covers
or
stove
burners
the
windshieldhood
area
not
much
to
say
about
this
one
drivers
side
my
question
when
this
is
brought
to
europe
will
the
steering
wheel
switch
sides
seriously
though
i
love
that
little
steering
wheel
piece
more
than
i
love
taffy
and
im
a
man
who
enjoys
his
taffy
left
side
in
its
entirety
and
the
right
side

through

side
no

done

sorry
for
the

i
just

another

longhighwide

badass
copter
including
rotors
i
have
heard
of
as
long
as
25

2
books
of
instructions
we
got
here
first
one
for
the
helicopter
second
one
for
the
rest
and
the
platform
itself
a
general
overview
of
the
platform
from
above
the
4
minifigs
3
rescue
guys
and
one
oil
rig
worker
the
pilot
seems
not
very
happy
that
he
has
to
work
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
at
sea
right
beside
the
entry
of
the
tower
we
have
the
diving
equipment
holder
next
the
guy
can
jump
in
this
little
speedboat
and
another
guy
brings
it
down
to
water
with
the
crane
if
somebody
is
rescued
from
the
air
he
arrives
here
and
is
brought
to
the
tower
with
the
little
moving
platform
than
runs
on
rails
down
under
we
got
a
buoy
and
several
life
belts
and
extinguishers
with
the
lift
somebody
who
is
rescued
by
the
boat
can
be
brought
up
i
think
it
would
been
better
if
they
would
have
made
a
mechanism
there
to
bring
it
up
but
its
okay
a
few
floors
higher
the
sea
is
being
observated
and
watched
on
the
ground
level
we
have
the
medical
stationwarmup
room
the
helicopter
as
standalone
all
in
all
for
me
this
is
besides
the
police
station
the
city
set
of
this
year
its
got
great
features
and
looks
fantastic
and
also
has
many
useful
pieces
you
cant
do
anything
wrong
with
buying
it
1010
for
me
thats
all
for
now
hope
you
liked

is
the

your

are
very

you
go
into
detail
about
all
the
functions
of
the
set
i
agree
this
is
a
great
set
one
of
the
best
of
the
cg
line
for
sure
way
better
than
the
boat
set
with
the
tower
on
the
bionicle

and
cheaper
too
i
even
like
the
helicopter
better
than
the
oversized
version
lots
of
great
parts
and
a
really
nice
build
by
the
looks
of
it
too

cant
wait
for
this
to
be
released

very
nice
review
and
nice
set
to
boot
lots
of
little
features
that
increase
the
playability
great
pics
too
i
remember
you
had
trouble
before
with
the
tower
raid
castle
set
as
i
just
got
mine
and
was
looking
to
review
it
but
saw
your
review

how
slow

good
review
i
will
buy
it
this

positive
excellent
review
metalandi
its
always
great
to
see
early
pictures
of
new
sets
this
set
really
reminds
me
of
an
oil
rig
and
could
probably
be
easily
modified
as
one
if
one
wanted
an
alternate
model
the
two
components
that
i
like
most
are
the
boat
crane
and
the
control
room
but
other
sections
are
pretty
slick
as
well
are
those
printed
pieces
in
the
control
room
or
stickers
im
really
starting
to
gain
an
appreciation
for
these
new
coast
guard
sets
theyve
come
a
long
way
over
the
years
575
coast
guard
station
released
1978
i
picked
up
the
control

a
few
weeks
ago
but
havent
opened
it
yet
in
any
case
thanks
for
taking
the
time
to
review
this
set
and
share
it
over

thanks
for
the

im
loving
this
set

looks

the

is
awesome

i
love

agree
this
is
a
great

best

than

i
wouldnt
say
that
at
all
true
this
base
is
bigger
but
the
other
set
was
well
designed
as
well
plus
the
included
boat
is
wonderful

i
dont

the
worker
looks

um
oh
yeah
nice
reveiw
very
cool
set
im
not
sure
about
the
bottom
floor
glass
being
dark
grey
and
the
top
floor
glass
being
light
blue
negative
i
think
it
looks
good
on
the
real
set
i
thought
the
darker
glass
might
be
good
on
the
ground
level
so
the
rescued
guy
has
it
nice
and
dark
in
there
positive
nice
review
this
is
just
the
crown
jewel
for
the
coast
guard
theme
i
love
the
layout
of
its
platform
it
looks
real
neat
to
have
it
placed
it
in
the
midst
of
the
deep
blue
sea
awaiting
of
any
emergency
rescue
sometimes
i
feel
that
this
set
can
used
it
to
merge
with
my
aqua
raiders
sets
i
thought
of
using
it
as
a
land
base
for
the
raiders
to
dock
in
their
stuff
before
submerge
into
the
ocean
ok
its
just
a
wierd
idea
of
mine
just
feel
that
aqua
raiders
and
coast
guard
can
work
hand
in
hand
since
they
are
naval
expertise
it
seemed
i
cant
view
all
the
pictures
somehow
nevertheless
i
can
still
view
some
of
it
quite
well
i
love
the
command
center
the
amount
of
computer
printed
pieces
simply
make
me
smile
with
the
monitor
keyboard
radar
screen
and
etc
the
helicopter
is
cute
too
however
i
pity
the
victim
that
is
loaded
at
the
back
it
seemed
a
little
bit
too
dangerous
in
addition
this
set
seemed
to
have
quite
alot
of
stickers
which
can
be
quite
discouraging
i
do
hope
to
see
this
set
soon
so
far
i
quite
like
the
current
coast
guard
sets

can
you
walk

buy
this

if
so
ill
get
my

to
buy
me
one
when
she
visits
the

down
under
next

well
some
sets
this
cg

is
one
of
them
a

exclusive
to

and
all
other
lego
can
be
found
in
shops
like

david

then
there
is
toys
r
us
of
course
but
they
are
usualy
abit
more
expensive
then
other
retailers
but
they
usualy
have
the
exclusive
sets
like
this
one
and
its
funny
you
are
from
japan
because
iam
going
there
in
september
with
my
dad
hes
a
missionary
and
i
was
wondering
where
i
can
find
lego
in
japan
since
i
have
not
been
to
japan
since
2001
and
i
was
not
into
lego
much
then
im
sure
you
guys
have
a
toys
r
us
right
neutral
thats
a
great
review
of
a
great
city
set
thank
you
very
much
metalandi
first
of
all
i
wanted
to
buy
the
7999
cg
petrol
boat
tower
but
now
i
surely
will
buy
this
amazing
platform
instead
of
the
7999
if
my
local
toy
seller
sells
the
4210
reason
4210
is
something
very
unusual
set
i
think
we
wont
get
a
set
similar
to
that
in
the
next
20
years
and
because
of
i
dont
like
the
petrol
boat
inside
no
backwalls
nearly
no

klausdieter
positive
great
review
metalandi
thanks
for
posting
it
with
a
number
of
pictures
the
only
question
is
why
lego
decided
to
produce
so
many
sets
i
want
to
buy
in
one
year
neutral
paramedic
unit
set
6364
year
released
1980
piece
count
140
minifigs
2
list
price
unknown
well
let
me
first
say
that
the
english
name
paramedic
unit
is
not
really
a
good
name
for
this
set
the
function
of
a
paramedic
is
to
take
a
patient
from
an
emergent
situation
and
deliver
them
to
a
hospital
for
treatment
generally
an
emergency
room
this
is
a
rather
small
clinic
that
i
would
imagine
is
more
for
family
care
than
an
emergency
room
in
addition
the
car
looks
more
like
a
doctornurses
car
rather
than
an
ambulance
or
emergency
response
vehicle
i
would
call
this
a
clinic
rather
than
a
paramedic
unit
in
any
case
its
a
great
set
esp
for
table
towns
that
need
medical
services
what
i
like
is
that
this
set
is
small
enough
to
place
anywhere
in
your
lego
city
or
town
starting
with
the
instructions
like
all
the
classic
town
sets
alternate
models
are
pictured
although
i
never
tried
building
one
i
like
the
little
medical
busvan
the
set
includes
two
minifigs
that
include
a
female
doctore
or
nurse
and
what
i
presume
is
a
patient
based
on
the
torsos
i
really
like
the
vehicle
its
a
4stud
wide
two
seater
the
colors
work
well
and
i
like
the
use
of
the
white
bar
between
the
seats
and
the
1x1
blue
plates
for
lights
unfortunately
the
emblems
are
stickers
heres
a
shot
of
the
neat
little
clinic
i
like
the
use
of
the
blinds
for
the
exam
room
it
shows
that
lego
considered
patient
privacy
when
making
this
set
the
interior
includes
an
exam
room
desk
and
two
blue
swivel
chairs
and
a
neat
little
eye
chart
although
the
letters
l
e
g
o
would
have
made
a
nice
touch
lastly
a
picture
of
the
complete
set
i
must
admit
that
i
remember
buying
this
set
back
in
the
80s
and
i
regreted
it
after
taking
it
home
im
not
sure
what
i
didnt
like
about
it
perhaps
the
girl
back
then
but
now
i
really
think
its
a
neat
set
well

added
a
point

days

i
always

is

neutral
brickster
strikes
again
with
another
awesome
review
ah
one
of
the
few
hospital
related
kits
lego
made
wasnt
this
the
first
hospital
with
modern
minifigs
because
i
seem
to
remember
seeing
an
even
older
hospital
online
that
had
the
armless
faceless
figs
regardless
this
would
be
great
as
a
little
doctors
office
in
someones
town
layout
although
the
vehicle
is
a
little
silly
and
that
eye
chart
sticker
has
to
be
the
coolest
decal
ever
quote
maybe
a
tfol
well
it
sure
isnt
me
i
personally
love
older
kits
even
though
im
only
a
teen
i
like
a
lot
of
the
newer
sets
a
bit
more
than
some
of
the
classic
stuff
but
i
have
always
agreed
that
the
70s
and
80s
were
an
extremely
high
point
in
legos
time
even
though
i
dont
really
own
any
kits
from
the
period

you
for
all
these

thebrickster
and
the
idea
with
the
polls
is
a
very
nice
and
interesting
idea
it
will
only
take
a
while
until
i
will
have
commented
on
all
so
please
give
me
some
time
i
gave
this
set
a
four
the

the
minfigs
and
the
design
of
the

i
like
this
set
like
most
i
view
it
more
as
a
clinic
it
sits
nicely
in
my
town
plan
these
old
sets
are
all
very
cool
positive
wow
old
thread
just
for
the
record
so
long
as
it
is
here
paramedics
are
advanced
ambulance
technicians
unlike
standard
emts
they
are
trained
for
advanced
cardiac
life
support
they
can
push
drugs
defibrillate
place
a
breathing
tube
etc
in
the
1980s
when
the
set
was
made
it
was
quite
common
for
paramedics
to
respond
to
calls
in
fly
cars
or
special
response
units
they
would
join
up
with
ambulances
at
the
scenes
that
required
their
skills
if
you
ever
watched
the
old
american
tv
show
emergency
johnny
gage
and
squad
51
were
one

hello
all
eurobricks
members
and
town

today
i
will
be
doing
up
a
review
on
hook
haul
wrecker
this
name
is
quite
wierd
to
me
i
will
prefer
to
call
it
the
regular
tow
truck
this
is
one
of
the
service
and
repair
vehicle
that
are
always
ready
247
on
standby
for
any
emergency

hook
haul
wrecker
is
the
typical
4studs
wide
vehicle
that
takes
care
of
broken
vehicles
that
is
left
stranded
on
the
roads
this
tow
truck
is
pretty
useful
as
you
can
see
current
city
sets
hardly
have
any
tow
trucks
available
to
tow
new
cars
design
this
tow
truck
is
catered
for
4studs
vehicles
for
classic
town
can
you
imagine
yourself
this
truck
towing
a
speed
racer
car
i
think
it
looks
really
out
of
proportion
in
addition
the
minifig
which
is
included
in
this
set
has
the
regular
truck
print
on
its
torso
i
am
very
sure
they
must
be
a
fan
club
for
trucks
otherwise
they
should
really
need
a
change
of
clothes
nevertheless
in
my
honest
opnion
i
really
love
this
torso
very
much
somehow
it
makes
them
look
tough
even
though
their
face
looks
very
friendly
side
view
this
vehicle
has
a
combination
of
two
primary
colors
which
is
white
and
red
this
color
combination
looks
very
good
you
can
not
mistook
it
for
an
ambulance
since
they
made
use
of
this
two
colors
too
in
most
emergency
vehicles
this
is
my
guess
i
supposed
the
designer
will
have
tow
truck
concept
as
a
form
of
emergency
and
considered
red
and
white
as
its
combinations
this
vehicle
setup
has
the
typical
sunscreen
on
the
top
of
the
vehicle
frame
however
this
baby
has
more
unique
features
installed
in
it
these
are
the
source
of
its
brutal
strength
allterrain
vehicle
this
tow
truck
equipped
with
the
best
wheels
in
fact
these
wheels
offer
suspension
on
the
roads
even
when
its
travelling
uphill
the
truck
will
move
accordingly
with
its
tyres
when
you
act
pressure
on
the
top
of
the
vehicle
it
will
either
be
shifted
leftwards
or
rightwards
closeup
of
these
unique
tyres
take
a
careful
look
these
wheels
have
springs
installed
in
it
that
is
the
magic
of
these
vehicle
and
is
defintely
suited
to
run
on
any
rough
roads
with
least
problems
if
any
eb
members
know
which
other
vehicles
has
this
unique
features
please
highlight
it
to
me
because
if
i
remembered
correctly
i
only
remember
seeing
this
pair
of
tyres
in
this
great
set
he
is
ready
for
some
serious
towing
the
driver
had
finished
hook
up
the
pizza
van
on
its
back
its
pretty
simple
you
just
have
to
lift
the
back
of
the
vehicle
and
placed
it
onto
the
hook
presto
the
van
is
ready
to
go
this
vehicle
provides
so
much
fun
you
can
really
tow
any
4studs
vehicle
in
your
town
and
here
we
go
to
the

this
is
a
wonderful
80s
vehicle
and
i
think
it
might
be
one
of
the
first
if
not
the
first
that
had
the
spring
suspension
system
i
know
of
at

one
other

had
that
the
biggest

from

had

car
i
think
it
looks
really
out

firstly
speed
racer
cars
are
out
of
scale
even
with
city
vehicles
also
i
have
hope
that
in
the
next
few
years
we
will
get
more
octan
sets
to
go
with
the
wonderful
gas
station
and
i
suspect
that
a
6wide
tow
truck
will
be
at
the
top
of
the
list
it
wouldnt
be
a
hard
set
to
make
and
i
bet
it
would
sell
well

ive
had
this
set
since
i
was
young
never
understood
why
a
tow
truck
needed
to
be
an
offroader
maybe
it
was
used
to
tow
the
other
offroad
vehicles
the
suspension
made
the
truck
too
tall
to
tow
some
cars
so
i
often
took
the
hook
out
and
use
the
truck
as
just
an
great
offroad
truck
like
6672
which
also
had
the
suspension
wheels
other
tow
truck
sets
better
filled
their
roles
better
but
that
doesnt

the
set
includes
three
minifigs
including
two
gas
station
attendants
and
my
favorite
the
urban
cowboy
one
of
the
best
things
about
this
set
is
that
it
includes
not
one
but
two
very
detailed
4stud
wide
vehicles
heres
a
picture
of
the
red
one
which
is
a
twoseater
the
car
has
two
working
doors
a
hood
that
opens

a
little
holed
brick
on
the
other
side
for
pretending
to

heres

at

isnt

a
nice

of

heres
the
yellow
car
i
always
liked
this
one
better
perhaps
it
was
the
color
with
the
black
pieces
in
the
back
although
it
is
a
oneseater
the
set
includes
four
fuel
pumps
that
are
numbered
with
decals
and
included
a
string
as
the
hose
heres
a
little
accessory
rack
for
oil
and
tools
and
another
rack
for
tires
the
set
had
a
nice
exxon
logo
on
three
1x6
bricks
a
large
jack
allows
the
cars
to
be
lifted
high
into
the

for

i
love
the

the

honestly
dont

why
some
people
have
complained
about
the
city
gas
stations
figure
count
the
majority
of
lego
gas
stations
had
no
more
than
three
figures
including
this
one
and
the
wonderful
gas
and
wash
express
which
i
actually
own
i
also
dont
get
why
people
complain
about
the
stickers
so
much
because
even
older
kits
often
had
a
lot
personally
i
think
stickers
are
okay
because
printed
pieces
cant
be
used
in
as
many
places
if
the
stickers
are
really
specialized

that
many

this
is
it
the
pinacle
of

man
this

is
flawless
there
are
so
many
indications
that
the
designers
took
care
in
designing
this
kit
like
the
space
for
the
pilots
backpack
the
compartment
for
the
mini
flier
the
sturdy
leg
design
etc
etc

kudos
to
tlc
for
making

i
have
high
hopes
that
whereever
the

really
looks
good

a
super
review
welcome
few
things

hours
and
my
favorite
stickers
of
the
set
positive
nice
review
i
dont
mind
the
set
but
at
the
same
time
im
not
particularly
fond
of
it
negative
i
dont
like
mars
mission
sets
but
this
one
is
just
spectacular
it
is
beautiful
i
must
have
this
set
even
if
it
means
selling
my
kidney
i
only
have
one
mars
mission
set
the
etx
alien
mothership
assault
which
is
okay
but
this
set
blows
my
mind
two
thumbs
up
positive
today
im
gon
na
review
the
bigger
of
the
2
castles
from
the
fright
knigh
theme
i
got
this
one
last
week
at
a
pretty
fair
prive
at
ebay
new
and
still
sealed
i
love
opening
boxes
that
had
been
lying
arounf
for
years
and
being
the
first
to
build
an
old
set
since
i
know
this
castle
theme
is
not
liked
so
much
by
the
general
public
ill
try
here
and
change
their
minds
cause
i
really
think
this
is
a
great
set
this
time
i
have
to
say
my
pictures
turned
out
pretty
amazing
even
if
i
am
still
using
just
my
cellphone
cam
but
im
really
pleased
now
with
the
quality
here
we
go
set
nr
6097
name
night
lords
castle
number
of
minifigs
7
number
of
pieces
598
release
year
1997
lets
start
with
a
few
box
instructions
pictures
the
inside
od
the
box
with
a
few
alternate
models
the
back
with
another
possibility
how
to
assemble
the
3
main
parts
instructions
next
the
6
minifigs
starting
with
the
witch
on
her
black
dragon
all
5
figures
of
the
fright
section
and
the
poor
royal
knight
we
go
on
with
the
set
itself
first
a
general
overview
its
really
high
on
the
first
floor
theres
a
trap
with
which
you
can
drop
stones
or
other
things
down
on
unliked
guests
the
pot
comes
originally
from
fabuland
i
think
i
love
this
thing
in
the
same
floor
there
is
a
second
trap
if
you
pull
the
bar
the
door
opens
we
move
on
to
the
tower
itself
did
i
mention
its
really
high
on
the
ground
level
theres
the
place
for
the
witch
to
do
her
spells
the
wall
is
a
secret
door
which
reveals
a
skeleton
when
turned
over
on
the
next
level
there
is
this
little
thingy
first
it
only
seems
like
a
barrel
but
when
you
pull
the
two
1x4
tiles
on
the
back
a
skull
is
being
revealed
scary
huh
i
dont
really
understand
what
this
is
for
but
i
assume
its
a
telescope
to
watch
and
observate
the
dragons
i
do
find
that
a
bit
senseless
since
there
havent
been
telescopes
in
medieval
times
or
have
there
been
the
back
of
the
tower
with
the
prison
and
the
room
for
the
treasure
chest
the
prison
opened
its
secured
with
a
chain
which
i
like
very
much
cause
you
really
can
lock
it
with
that
treasure
chest
from
the
highest
peak
we
now
go
down
to
the
very
ground
level
at
the
back
of
the
castle
there
is
another
secret
walldoor
flanked
by
two
shields
at
the
back
half
of
the
inside
there
is
the
throne
hall
for
the
bat
lord
with
a
nice
warm
fireplace
in
the
back
this
is
where
the
secret
door
is
placed
the
second
half
is
pretty
empty
except
for
these
two
baskets
i
dont
know
exactly
what
they
are
for
but
i
ike
the
idea
for
using
them
as
water
places
for
the
horses
one
thing
that
might
be
a
bit
stupid
is
that
2
of
the
4
side
entrances
do
not
have
doors
so
they
are
open
and
a
guard
would
have
to
stand
there
the
whole
day
you
can
see
it
in
his
face
he
isnt
very
happy
with
that
that
was
my
last
review
of
the
sets
i
got
the
last
weeks
but
im
looking
forward
to
make
much
more
in
the
future
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
set
i
dont
know
any
other
one
with
so
much
details
and
playability
the
minus
point
is
as
already
said
that
it
is
too
open
on
the
sides
but
that
can
be
solved
easily
with
a
bit
of
modding
also
i
must
say
this
set
isnt
that
much
juniorized
as
many
might
have
thought
though
the
design
is
a
bit
unconventional
but
exactly
thats
what
i
like
most
about
it
all
in
all
it
gets
a
910
for
me
hope
you
enjoyed
the
reading
and
the
pictures
cant
wait
to
see
your
response
edit
oops
i
forgot
to
put
one
figure
of
the
fright
knight
faction
on
the
photo
but
its
the
one
in
the
last
picture

thanks
for
doing
this
fright
knights
review
by
opening
up
a
misb
set
which
you
have
bought
recently
i
am
very
sure
the
feeling
is
very
nice
especially
touching
the
bricks
which
is
preserved
for
11
years
sealed
in
bags
i
am
quite
fond
of
the
fright
knights
theme
unfortunately
this
theme
was
released
during
my
dark
age
i
never
really
bought
sets
from
fright
knights
instead
i
bought
plenty
of
minifigs
to
build
an
army
if
i
could
turn
back
time
or
find
another
misb
set
with
a
reasonable
price
i
am
very
sure
i
will
get
it
my
soldiers
need
a
castle
to
stay
in
i
will
be
looking
forward
to
your
next
review
keep
up
the
good
job
neutral
i
read
this
review
not
long
after
you
posted
it
but
im
not
sure
why
i
didnt
comment
if
dragonator
is
the
one
to
post
everytime
he
sees
a
dragon
related
topic
i
would
be
the
one
to
post
if
i
see
a
fright
knights
topic
fright
knights
is
one
of
my
favourite
lego
themes
and
this
review
is
really
good
i
got
both
of
the
castles
in
the
theme
and
loved
them
and
your
review
presents
basil
the
batlords
castle
well
i
too
thought
it
was
a
bit
weird
that
there
is
a
green
base
when
it
could
be
grey
but
i
guess
its
a
useful
piece
to
use
in
other
things
fright
knights
on
positive
ah
this
brings
back
memories
i
have
this
set
and
i
loved
the
playabilaty
factor
opposing
to
older
castle
sets
i
have
in
medieval
times
there
actually
were
primitive
telescopes
you
can
read
about
it
here
thanks
for
this
review
great
storie
great
pics

wow
what
a
cool
castle
and
set

general
i
had
no
idea
that
this
set
existed
long
dark
ages
thanks
to
you
metalandi
for
such
a
great

the
figures
look
really
nice

the

the

my

arent

said
well
that
the
bricks
look
new
comes
from
that
they
are
new
i
got
this
set
new
and
unopened
i
know
pretty
good
deal
positive
i
got
a
couple
of
the
small
sets
from
this
line
when
it
came
out
recently
i
acquired
several
more
from
bricklink
because
i
just
really
love
the
way
they
look
this
theme
really
had
good
intentions
but
the
execution
was
flawed
i
hope
one
day
lego
returns
to
a
darker
tone
but
maybe
next
time
it
could
be
more
castlevania
inspired
that
would
really
turn
some
heads
plus
vampires
and
gothic
aesthetics
are
really
popular
now
it
will
probably
have
run
its
course
by
the
time
lego
would
be
able
to
develop
a
theme
around
them

third
fire
station
was
this
little
gem
6382
the
set
offered
new
design
elements
not
previously
offered
in
previous
sets
what
really
stands
out
for
me
is
1x3
car
doors
and
torsos
with
printed
designs
a
decal
was
used
for
the
large
sign
on
the
building
and
the
1
on
the
hood
of
one
of
the
vehicles
i
think
this
was
also
the
first
set
to
offer
the
sliding
garage
mechanism
a
feature
that
added
a
great
amount
of
realism
and
playability
the
set
also
included
two
blue
doors
and
the
new
fire
hose
with
preconnected
faucetspicket
getting
on
to
the
pictures
i
saved
the
cover
of
the
box
for
this
set
but
lost
the
instructions
over
the
years
i
was
able
to
download
some
instructions
from
the
web
heres
a
shot
of
the
box
cover
and
the
back
of
the
box
the
set
includes
four
figs
three
of
which
are
fireman
and
a
lady
who
can
serve
as
a
dispatcher
as
mentioned
above
the
torsos
are
printed
on
my
favorite
of
the
two
vehicles
included
i
love
the
design
of
fire
engine
1
i
always
loved
the
fire
hoses
included
in
this
set
no
string
to
have
to
tie
or
freyed
ends
engine
2
is
this
much
larger
engine
with
ladder
i
like
how
it
contains
an
oxygen
tank
and
fire
axe
on
the
other
side
of
the
engine
are
two
shutter
doors
that
reveal
the
hose
and
ladder
controls
these
are
stickers
the
ladder
is
much
wider
than
previous
lego
ladders
and
extends
a
good
length
i
like
the
baseplate
of
this
set
which
has
the
numbers
one
and
two
marking
each
garage
the
building
is
simple
but
has
a
nice
design
i
love
the
sliding
garage
doors
note
notice
the
two
windows
of
the
2nd
floor
the
actual
set
should
have
blinds
on
these
windows
ive
lost
one
of
the
stickered
windows
so
placed
the
single
blinded
window
on
the
1st
floor
each
of
the
two
sides
of
the
garages
are
the
same
heres
a
shot
of
the
right
side
on
the
first
floor
is
the
dispatch
area
and
a
classic
blue
space
computer
the
2nd
floor
has
a
bed
and
a
chair
heres
a
shot
of
the
entire
backside
and
lastly
a
shot
of
the
entire
station
this
set
is
one
of
my
favorite
fire
stations
that
offers
a
great
amount
of
playability
hope
you
enjoyed
the
review
positive
this
is
a
great
set
and
a
great
review
thanks

doing
these
i
remember
my
brother
getting
this
set
i
got
the
police
station
6384
on
the
same
day
truly
classic
sets
its
a
shame
that
i
dont
have
them

although
i
do
have
the
two
immediate
descendants
of
the
sets
cheers
rog
positive
great
review
again
its
nice
to
see
old
sets
reviewed
i
love
the
control
stickers
theres
a
great
level
of
detail
this
is
really
the
second
best
fire
station
in
my
opinion
positive
lovely
i
cant
stop
making
comparisons
between
this
fire
station
and
last
years
which
is
also
very
well
detailed
with
great
features
and
awesome
playability
the
concept
design
of
the
second
one
its
very
much
like
the
one
reviewed
here
this
is
good
as
tlg
is
taking

this

amazes
me
is
what
the

a

2

4

great
alternative

thank
you
so
much
for
all
these
reviews
of
classic
town
sets
omfg
this
set
was
released
in
1982
and
i
was
born
1
year
earlier
hehe
nice
little

good
but
i
like
the

of

6571
better
another
4
from
me
positive
a
nice
little
model
with
some
neat
features
for
its
age
plus
the
allyime
classic
fireman
as
a
bonus
however
this
design
of
chopper
the
police
station
around
the
same
time
was
the
same
design
i
think
dated
very
quickly
while
is
was
good
to
use
the
hinged
car
roof
which
was
relatively
new
at
the
time
together
with
the
inverted
screen
it
was
superceded
very
quickly
by
designs
that
stood
the
test
of
time
far
better
for
example
6657
also
i
dont
think
i
could
everbuy
a
lego
fire
helicopter
because
it
is
not
something
we
have
in
the
ukeire
police
coast
guard
ambulance
military
etc
etc
but
no
fire
helicopters
not
something
i
would
therefore
want
in
my
lego
town
great
review

many

because

hello
all
eurobricks

and

today
i
will
be
doing
up
a
review
on
snorkel
squad
one
of
the
most
important
and
basic
vehicle
in
any
fire
department
snorkel
squad
in
simple
english
terms
it
refers
to
fire
engine
fighting
fire
always
on
standby
ready
to
save
the
citizens
from
crisis
trust
me
you
will
understand
why
this
snorkel
squad
is
superb
impressive
by
the
end
of
this
review
on
a
side
note
there
is
only
part
that
is
replaced
by

of
a

snorkel
squad
looking
smart
on
their
standby
this
snorkel
squad
is
a
fanastic
fire
engine
that
is
ready
to
save
people
from
the
fires
its
primary
color
red
is
used
in
all
fire
emergency
department
and
vehicles
in
case
of
any
emergency
this
snorkel
squad
will
be
activated
and
arrived
at
the
scene
as
soon
as
possible
no
time
to
waste
personally
this
is
the
best
fire
engine
that
i
had
ever
seen
meet
the
fire
fighters
it
comes
with
two
brave
fire
fighters
both
of
them
wear
the
standard
fire
fighter
outfit
that
is
present
in
almost
all
fire
station
sets
in
classic
town
the
torso
is
very
nice
and
formal
and
looks
real
impressive
onto
them
i
love
the
buttons
on
them
furthermore
these
white
helmets
are
a
symbol
to
the
world
of
fire
fighting
these
are
the
people
whom
save
lives
by
risking
their
own
lives
in
dangerous
situations
water
hose
compartment
the
water
hose
is
a
string
that
is
stored
in
the
front
it
can
be
rolled
out
and
the
fire
fighters
are
able
to
use
it
without
much
difficulty
they
will
just
pull
out
the
hose
and
spray
onto
the
fire
the
next
picture
shows
a
much
clearer
look
in
its
interior
in
addition
the
fire
logo
that
is
on
the
compartment
is
actually
printed
yes
its
not
a
sticker
and
that
is
great
news
for
us
interesting
features
these
clamps
on
both
sides
is
supposed
to
stablise
the
fire
engine
when
the
ladder
is
heading
upwards
it
is
a
simple
mechanism
which
illustrate
clearly
what
it
does
this
feature
is
recently
seen
in
construction
vehicle
such
as
the
mobile
crane
of
course
it
is
not
a
complicated
feature
it
just
made
use
of
three
quite
common
white
parts
swivel
mechanism
these
swivel
mechanism
in
my
opnion
are
very
fun
to
play
with
these
connectors
on
the
front
and
the
back
enable
the
long
fire
engine
to
make
sharp
turns
on
any
junctions
arriving
at
the
scene
fast
enough
this
is
not
a
fire
engine
that
only
travel
straight
roads
try
it
onto
your
base
plates
and
you
will
be
surprised
how
well
it
can
turn
best
playable
mechanism
in
6358
the
driver
will
be
activating
the
ladder
at
the
back
of
the
vehicle
in
order
to
adjust
the
height
and
making
sure
that
the
ladder
do
not
fall
short
the
tiles
on
the
plates
are
acting
like
a
stoppage
the
ladder
are
able
to
rotate
360
degree
without
much
problem
if
you
removed
the
driver
out
of
the
control
panel
it
goes
up
as
tall
as
30cm
look
at
that
amazing
height
too
bad
i
have
not
constructed
my
cafe
corner
yet
otherwise
i
can
give
you
a
better
feel
of
how
amazing
this
baby
can
go
i
used
the
old
road
baseplate
as
a
guide
and
roughly
it
can
goes
as
tall
as
30
to
35cm
look
at
the
black
hinges
below
by
shifting
it
to
the
last
that
was
the
maximum
height
it
can
move
this
is
a
very
good
way
to
adjust
the
height
oh
and
i
forget
to
mention
that
there
are
2
storage
compartments
for
the
fighters
to
place
their
equipments
behind
quite
easy
to
access
no
doors
apart
from
the
standard
roof
top
on
the
drivers
seat
there
is
no
doors
present
at
both
side
i
am
quite
sad
to
see
that
there
are
no
doors
maybe
these
fighters
are
supposed
to
jump
off
the
seat
instead
of
opening
the
doors
well
i
guess
this
is
the
only
major
flaws
that
i
had
found
in
this
set
heading
off

i
can
remember
the
6358
very
vividly
my
parents
bought
the
6340
for
me
and
a
girl
friend
got
the
6358
im
quiet
sure
its
my
envy
because
until
now
i
want
to
believe
that
the
6340
is
better
my
reasons
were
these
i
own
the
6340
and
on
the
instructions
of
the
6358
stood
legoland
which
i
thought
of
as
old
but
this
review
induced
me
to
get
over
this
humiliation
from
my
childhood
and
check
ebay
for
the

feel

thing
which
i

the
respirators
for
the
firemen

they
already
own
air
tanks

otherwise
this
set
is
brilliant

like
it

kd
i
owned
the
2007
fire
engine
as
well
as
this
set
was
not
restored
back
then
and
i
needed
a
fire
engine
very
badly
i
managed
to
restored
it
somehow
and
i
compared
it
with
the
2007
the
older
design
is
still
the
best

great
set
i
found
only
one
major
fail
this
the
hands
of
robot
arms
gets
easly
broken
yes
this
is
an
interesting
finding
i
remembered
when
i
was
a
child
that
robot
arms
always
come
out
of
its
own
when
i
fiddle
with
it
i
was
so
annoyed
by
it
and
i
just
kept
it
there
whenever
i
deployed
it
for
rescue
missions
grevious
on

am
said
however
i
honestly
wouldnt
consider
it
the
best
firetruck
ever
i
actually
like
the
one
from
2005
even
better
becasue
like
most
of
the
city
vehicles
it
adds
the
needed
bulk
big
engines
like
fire
trucks
need
many
of
the
older
kits
while
awesome
were
honestly
a
little
too
skinny
imo
grevious
i
appericate
your
honest
comments
and
given
me
your
insight
towards
this
set
and
state
a
comparison
as
well
i
agreed
with
you
that
fire
engines
need
to
be
big
and
sturdy
on
the
other
hand
it
can
be
nice
to
have
the
fire
engine
to
look
slim
as
well
to
cut
through
the
traffic
easily
i
am
not
against
with
the
newer
sets
it
just
that
part
of
the
reasons
which
reflected
in
the
review
had
fufill
the
basic
key
factors
of
a

it

typical
fire
engine
in
addition
it
was
my
alltime
favourite
under
the
firefighting
theme
yes
i
agree
this
set
is
wonderful
even
today
and
is
one
of
the
best
fire
kits
ever
release
and
actually
realistic
scale
is
not
really
a
necessity
in
lego
its
just
my
personal
taste
for
example
ive
never
liked
the
tiny
planes
in
the
old
airports
that
much
but
i
can
see
why
a
lot
of
people
like
them
better
than
the
new
ones

nice

but
three
questions
1
how
many
pages
do
the
instruction
books
have
2
what
are
the
spare
parts
or
does
this
laaty
come
with
two

where
did

4
how
much
did

one
he

from

neutral
i
have
a
question
what
is
the
door
above
the
gun
for
pic
neutral
so
basically
you
cited
as
faults
what
everybody
had
been
complaining
about
since
the
first
information
of
the
set
arrived
skeletal
interior
and
lack
of
clones
although
i
didnt
realize
it
didnt
have
numbered
backs
that
really
is
just
ridiculous
lego
finally
comes
up
with
a
very
intelligent
solution
to
the
frustration
seen
when
building
large
sets
but
then
they
neglect
to
implement
it
wtf
lame
still
this
may
be
the
only
clone
wars
set
i
buy
besides
the
exclusives
the
exterior
which
imo
is
the
only
part
that
matters
looks
so
fantastic
i
dont
care
about
clones
i
have
enough
of
those
already
and
at
90
its
still
a
better
buy
than
the
rgs
the
torrent
is
cool
but
not
as
cool
as
the
fighter
tank
or
dgs
imo
awesome
inconstruction
pics
positive
just
picked
this
set
up
and
just
took
a
break
from
building
to
go
to
football
practice
i
have
just
finished
building
all
of
the
legs
and
so
far
it
looks
like
it
is
going
to
be
a
great
set
i
would
have
like
it
if
more
clones
were
included
but
whatever
i
find
it
interesting
how
many
clone
accessories
they
give
you
i
dont
like
it
only
because
i
cant
decide
what
i
want
to
use
i
find
it
interesting
that
at
lease
2
people
are
missing
pieces
i
have
had
multiple
times
where
i
thought
i
was
missing
pieces
only
to
find
that
they
were
in
the
bag
somewhere
other
than
the
fact
that
there
is
a
lack
of
minifigures
i
love
this
set
and
cant
wait
to
finish
it
later
tonight

this

and
its
so
huge
that
i
cant

it
is
pretty
sturdy
and
heavy
thats
where
the
handle
comes
in
im
pissed
that
you
only
get
2
clones
rex
has
to
fight
on
the

while
you
need
more
clones
to
man
the

the
legs
were
the
most
annoying
and
time

yea
i
agree
that
if

how
bad
this

can
be
it
cant

republic
gunship
is
one
of
the
alltime
favourites
in
star

prequel
and
ot
i
cant
find
any
faults
except
being
too
expensive
due
to
the
licence
cost
in
addition
the
minifigs
are
the
next
big
thing
seriously
i
am
quite
impressed
with
it
on
the
down
side
my
rating
will
go
up

there
is
an
additional

it
gave
me
the
chance
to
pick
up
some
of
the
new

was
really
impressed

the
set
is
made
up
of
two
models
the
crown
knights
tower
and
the
orcs
siege
tower
lets
start
with
the
crown
knights
tower
a
knight
readies
himself
for
battle
my
favourite
model
from
the
set
the
wicked
orcs
siege
tower
please
note
that
for
the
purposes
of
display
i
mounted
the
orcs
banner
onto
a
small
cone
set
on
the
top
platform
of
the
siege
tower
this
doesnt
come
with
the
set
but
saves
any
orcs
having
to
hold
onto
it
all
he
time
there
are
other
areas
it
can
be
placed
without
using
extra
parts
features
both
models
look
great
and
have
excellent
features
the
set
as
a
whole
has
great
playability
and
seems
to
have
been
concieved
with
a
storyline
the
crown
knights
have
a
captured
orc
within
the
walls
of
their
tower
so
the
orc
army
has
been
sent
out
to
recover
him
or
are
they
merely
after
the
gold
the
knights
keep
horded
away
the
orcs
siege
tower
has
a
powerful
ram
springloaded
by
the
simple
arrangement
of
an
elastic
band
so
pulling
it
back
sends
it
flying
out
the
front
knocking
down
the
wall
on
the
side
of
the
knights
tower
and
releasing
the
captive
orc
the
floor
panels
inside
the
prison
are
laid
over
a
lip
on
the
inside
of

theres
a
string
at

for
extending
the
boarding

letting
a
fearsome
orc
warrior
charge
across

action
the
battle
heats
up
as
the
orcs
close
in
the
minifigures
the
crown
knights
i
really
like
the
crown
knights
theyre
metallic
helmets
look
great
and
they
come
with
nice
accessories
the
archer
has
a
double
printed
head
with
a
frightened
look
on
the
other
side
too
im
not
surprised
id
be
frightened
when
staring
over
the
ramparts
at
these
the
orcs
these
guys
really
do
look
the
part
worthy
advesaries
to
the
crown
knights
the
details
are
superb
the
printed
elements
weapons
and
helmets
all
set
the
orcs
aside
on
the
battlefield
the
set
comes
with
a
great
new
molded
armour
neckpiece
too
the
mighty
orc
leader
looks
wicked
in
his
full
battlegear
overview
theres
so
much
to
this
set
its
hard
not
to
be
impressed
the
orcs
siege
engine
is
a
thing
of
beauty
or
terror
and
would
look
great
on
any
battlefield
the
crown
knights
tower
although
basic
looks
good
and
has
great
playability
im
a
big
fan
of
the
new
castle
knights
and
fantasy
minifigures
and
the
inclusion
of
five
of
them
is
just
enough
for
this
set
and
as
a
booster
to
any
army
at
#
1999
in
the
uk
this
set
is
well
worth
the
money
for
content
and
quality
id
highly
recommmend
this
set
as
a
musthave
purchase
for
anyone
a
final
shot
of
the
siege
tower
with
a
host
of
orcs
ready
for
battle
i
hope
you
enjoyed
my
review
ill
be
posting
my
next
one
for
7040
dwarves
mine
defender
soon
positive
i
got
this
set
in
the
spring
during
my
buy
every
new
castle
set
availableseason
granted
i
couldnt
afford
all
of
them
but
i
do
have
most
of
them
now
anyway
i
love
the
action
elements
to
this
set
and
the
siege
tower
really
does
look
wicked
id
like
to
attach
the
crownie
tower
to
the
kings
castle
to
see
how
it
fits
but
i
unfortunately
dont
own
that
set
yet
i
also
love
the
turning
head
of
the
soldier
and
ive
used
it
in
my
princess
questcomic
as
well
along
with
the
turning
head
of
the
princess
the
troll
leader
brings
good
variety
to
the
army
of
trolls
but
they
still
could
use
another
face
type
and
more
torso
options
its
a
nice
review
in
any
case
although
the
set
pretty
much
speaks
for
itself
positive
hey
good
review
and
good
photos
i
also
got
this
set
just
recently
and
i
wasnt
very
enthusiastic
about
it
at
the
beginning
but
after
i
built
it
i
could
appreciate
it
the
siege
engine
is
very
nice
but
my
complaint
has
do
with
the
proportions
of
the
knights
tower
in
respect
to
the
trolls
machine
its
a
bit
smaller
and
less
bulkier
that
complaint
has
to
go
with
some
other
sets
too
for
example
the
troll
warship
is
really
humongous
it
feels
like
it
can
load
the
evil
wizards
tower
and
sail
off
other
than
that
a
good
set
i
like
it
45
from
me
positive
excellent
review
and
your
pictures
are
very
good
i
look
forward
to
seeing
more
review
i
really
like
this
set
i
got
it
some
time
ago
and
keep
meaning
to
post
some
pictures
of
it

for

i
am
very
impressed
by
your
high
quality

you
have
done
an
excellent
job
i
love
the
tower
raid
very
much
as
it
offers
high
playability
with
the
wall
and
flooring
falling
down
when
the
ram
hits
the
wall
its
quite
interesting
to
play
with
the
mechanism
of
the
ram
is
very
fun
to
play
with
as
well
i
will
try
and
pull
back

released

my

acting
up
the
build
is
nothing
speicial
on
to
the

and
irina
spalkoi
nice
array
of
minifigs
although
i
think
they
should
have
included
a
russian
soldier
or
two
if
you
look
to
the
right
on
mutts
jacket
it
has
his
name
in
script
the
tent
is
great
aside
from
the
fact
that
the
fabric
bends
easily
a
nice
amount
of
speicial
pieces
the
weapons
rack
is
pretty
nifty
so
is
the
table
when
you
swap
the
white
piece
with
a
black
one
overall
it
is
a

a

this

is

it

in

you

push

i
took
my
time
on
this
and
enjoyed
the
techniques
the
designers
intricated
also
taking
pics
added
to
the
time
quite
a
bit
playability
710
the
main
playability
functions
are
the
missle
launchers
in
the
back
and
the
sliding
cockpit
my
only
gripe
with
these
is
they
dont
set
right
with
the
other
slopes
on
the
top
also
the
inside
of
the
cockpit
is
easily
modded
for
regular
size
minifigs
just
pop
a
handlebar
piece
in
the
already
provided
arm
in
the
cockpit
and
bam
your
favorite
figs
can
have
a
ride
it
also
helps
keep
the
magnaguards
in
place
if
they
hold
it
minifigs
1010
imo
the
new
molds
are
great
the
only
downfall
is
the
right
arm
on
both
is
less
moveable
due
to
the
hard
plastic
turbanthing
connected
to
the
head
swooshability
910
the
starfighter
is
pretty
sleek
and
very
swooshable
design
910
the
most
important
aspect
and
this
ones
a
winner
its
only
a
nine
because
it
needs
to
have
smoother
edges
in
a
few
spots
but
they
are
easily
modable
overall
score
87
i
think
its
an
awesome
set
very
satisfying

its
definately
the

sprinter
for
me
there
are
many
reasons
for
that
most
of
which
have
been
mentioned
by
others
already
i
hate
yellow
its
the
most
useless
color
but
i
love
tan
and
dark
red
its
bigger
and
more
detailed
than
the
coast
guard
one
plus
i
think
there
is
a
hinge
in
the
back
of
it
so
there
is
apparently
some
more
playability
to
it
as
well
i
love
the
postapoc
style
fig
its
detailed
and
simply
looks
cool
also
while
the
digger
fig
has
quite
an
individual
look
to
it
the
coast
guard
driver
has
the
generic
hero
head
and
coast
guard
uniform
its
an
overal
better
deal
especially
if
you
count
the
ludp
which
gives
the
set
a
whole
lot
more
playability

u
the

may
be

fact
you
can
use
the
sprinter
as
a
militery
thingwhich
you
could
do
for
both
but
sprinter
just
pulls
it
off
better
and
i
like
the
radar
on
the
back
of
it
so
ill
have
to
go
with
the
street
sprinter
thanks
for
the
nice
topic

ive
got
to
go
with

you
have
to
stand
on

steve
positive
i
vote
for
the
dino
quadbike
definately
i
wish
i
had
that
but
ill
have
to
make
do
with
the
much
less
violent
european
version
dino
2010
not
attack
heres
a
comaprison
european
version
usa
etc
version
theres
a
subtle
difference
but
i
prefer
the
us
one
as
for
the
coast
guard
quad
i
think
its
ok
but
not
as
good
as
the
new
one
positive
i
like
the
coast
guard
one
but
dinos
eat
coast
guard
people
so
dinos
ftw
and
i
think
the
dino
bike
would
fit
in
with
my
collection
pretty
well
positive
i
like
the
dino
thingy
because
of
the
pieces
and
the
dino
is
a
lot
of
fun
on
its
own
i
know
thats
akward
positive
dino
attack
for
me
you
just
cant
say
no

the

i
did

that
europe
had
a

or
at

one
without
the

interesting
that
the
gun
was
removed
from
the
european
sets
or
added
to
the
us
sets
i
sort
of
like
the

i
also
notice
a
big

in
the

destroyed
city

prehistoric

i
wonder
if
the
story
was
different
as
well
thanks
for
sharing
a
good
picture
well
it
does
look
like
the
dino
quad
has
the
upper
hand
almost
double
the
votes
positive
dino
attack
quad
for
me
no
this
isnt
because
i
own
it
and
not
the
other
one
but
because
i
think
just
about
everything
is
better
in
it
the
design
is
better
the
colors
are
cooler
and
it
has
a
better
figure
i
dont
like
the
figure
in
the
coast
guard
quad
at
all
but
since
it
was
from
world
city
im
not
suprised
i
also
kinda
like
the
dino
actually
its
flexible
and
fits
in
with
the
previous
dinos
a
lot
better
than
the
cruddy
bigger
ones
with
bright
red
yellow
and
green
highlights
positive
i
know
it
would
really
go
well
with
the

but
it
is
not
enough
for
#

ill
wait
for
the
sales
at
christmas

nice
review
for
portugal
it

i
also
consider

it
shold
be

of

portugal
and
spain
may
have
good

finally
a
review
of
this
thanks
120
bucks
this
tank
looks
tiny
and
though
its
amazingly
detailed
it
should
have
been
smaller
and
only
4050
bucks
at
most
it
just
doesnt
play
that
big
a
part
man
good
pieces
and
mechanisms
but
no
ones
going
to
both
buying
a
120
buck
tank
no
offence
not
unless
it
its
the
atte
120
is
the
price
here
in
denmark
it
will
most
likely
be
the
same
price
as
the
v19
torrent
everywhere
else
so
you
dont
have
to
worry
about
that
neutral
ill
probably
get
this
in
hong
kong
where
lego
is
cheap
next
time
i
go
there
to
visit
my
relatives
also
pretty
nice

a

more

couldnt
hurt
also
are
there
just

thanks
for
the
review
christian
i
was
hoping
for
one
soon
this
set
really
looks
good
but
as
you
said
rather
big
the
figs
are
good
and
i
agree
that
kiadi
mundi
should
be
included
i
like
the
hidden
compartments
for
the
blasters
and
missiles
and
the
cockpit
is
really
cool
considering
it
seats
two
i
thought
only
one
i
will
surely
pick
this
up
sometime
positive
nice
review
thanks
for
taking
the
time
to
share
your
thoughts
looks
like
a
really
nice
set
and
ill
be
picking
it
up
eventually
when
it
makes
it
to
the
us
positive
this
is
my
favorite
set
in
the
clone
wars
wave
and
ill
be
picking
it
up
without
a
doubt
that
is
whenever
the
folks
at
lego
decide
that
its
okay
for
us
to
buy
their
sets
in
us
positive
great
review
i
really
like
the
look
of
this
set
and
having
played
a
lot
of
battlefront
i
am
quite
keen
to
pick
one
up
in
australia
when
it
comes
out
after
the
ds
is
paid
off
looks
like
some
nice
greebling
and
cool
colour
scheme
too
positive
i
am
100
going
to
get
this
set
it
should
be
about
55
and
if
it
is
ill
get
it
without
a
doubt
i
just
hope
that
this
set
is
5060
if
it
isnt
then
we
have
a
problem
positive
thanks
for
posting
the
review
i
've
been
wondering
about
this
set
to
me
it
does
feel
a
bit
fig
light
for
#
50
i
'd
expect
maybe
one
or
two
more
clones
i
'm
not
to
sure
about
the
oversized
issue
it
seems
to
me
it
's
better
to
have
something
a
bit
to
large
and
have
a
better
level
or
features
than
something
smaller
will
less
negative
this
set
costs
a
s100

went
to

too
see

and
the

there
are
more

christian
thanks
for
this
outstanding
review
i
have
been
waiting
for
this
moment
for
someone
to
do
up
an
excellent
review
like
this
republic
fighter
tank
is
my
2nd
favourite
set
in
my
clone
wars
list
the
2
clone
troopers
could
be
easily
add
up
to
your
rgs
since
it
offer
only
more
trooper
however
i
felt
that
this
set
is
quite
overpriced
in
fact
all
clone
war
sets
are
very
expensive
the
fighter
tank
has
a
very
great
color
combination
of
red
and
white
to
represent
the
republic
the
wheels
below
is
the
most
impressive
feature
which
enable
the
hovering
feel
the
hatch
is
a
neat
feature
as
well
however
i
noticed
there
is
a
rubber
band
within
the
control
panel
may
i
know
what
is
it
for
i
really
enjoy
viewing
this
review
you
had
given
the
insight
which
will
eventually
determined
whether
to
get
it
any
sooner
or

they
are
both

comes
with

of

not

you
can
have
mini
battles
with
the
turret

starfighter
overall

i
gave
it
8
because
of
the
design
which
was

would

did
to

those

were

the

were
12
mega

which
is
quite
a
lot
i
think
although
i
had
to
scale
them
down
to
800x600
i
used
to
dream
that
tlg
would
bring
out
these
sets
of
the
geonosis
arena
and
you
could
join
them
together
to
make
a
massive
arena

i
doubt
they
would
ever
do
that
also
look
out

my

the
box
looks
awesome
it
has
some
great
animations
of
the
3
models
in
the
instruction
the
rear
of
the
box
shows
some
nice
upcloseandpersonal
drawings
of
each
model
i
think
it
works
better
having
the
models
drawn
instead
of
a
mere
photo
of
them
somehow
it
allows
the
great
colourscheme
to
really
show
the
instructions
the
instruction
is
easy
to
follow
and
shows
which
pieces
are
used
in
each
building
step
that
makes
it
all
a
lot
easier
especially
with
so
many
small
pieces
as
in
this
set
the
bricks
are
divided
into
3
polybags
and
the
instruction
is
a
fine
small
book
which
can
be
easily
stored
along
the
rest
of
your
evergrowing
amount
of
booklets
and
pamphlets
printed
by
tlg
the
models
model
1
is
a
spider
and
it
's
nasty
the
2x2
modified
brick
with
the
hole
would
allow
one
to
hang
it
from
a
string
this
beast
is
sure
to
give
you
several
nightmares
were
it
hanging
from
a
string
in
your
bedroom
--
so
i
would
n't
do
that
plus
the
fact
that
my
wife
threw
away
the
box
and
ordered
me
to
take
the
spider
apart
when
she
saw
it
--
she
's
an
arachnophobian
and
does
not
take
spiders
lightly
it
looks
real
in
a
brickishnonrealway
model
2
is
a
snake
there
's
not
much
to
say
other
than
the
head
is
awesomely
designed
and
the
rest
is
bad
the
body
is
poorly
designed
and
does
not
live
up
to
the
coolness
of
the
head
build
the
head
ignore
the
rest
model
3
is
a
flying
scorpion
or
something
not
as
realistic
as
the
spider
but
still
a
great
model
with
a
cool
head
the
tail
is
a
bit
poorly
designed
but
it
'll
do
and
it
does
offer
some
good
ideas
on
how
to
use
bricks
all
in
all
verdicts
this
is
an
ok
creator
set
it
holds
a
lot
of
fine
pieces
and
the
models
are
an
ok
inspiration
given
its
size
it
's
an
ok
set
but
it
's
nothing
more
than
that
i
'll
give
it
an
average
score
i
enjoyed
building
the
models
and
fumbling
with
the
bricks
in
the
shade
during
a
``
siesta
''
on
my
vacation
and
that
's
what
it
is
an
enjoyable
build
and
a
little
inspiration

a
hot
day

once

a

collection
including
this
set
however
i
never
have

me
new

thanks
for
doing
up
all
these
sw
reviews
it
certainly
had
given
me
some
valuable
insights
on
these
sets
especially
on
the
snowspeeder
it
kind
of
making
me
regret
to
pass
off
this
set
however
i
had
bought
the
hoth
base
instead
but
had
never
built
it
i
am
just
wondering
if
the
snowspeeder
had
any
difference
keep
up
the
good
work
and
always
strive
your
best
to
make
each
upcoming
review
a
better
one
positive
there
isnt
much
difference
apart
form
it
has
stickers
on
and
is
grey
also
the
guns
and
tow
cable
gun
are
different
as
well
as
the
engines
but
if
you
look
at
pictures
of
the
hoth
base
speeder
not
to
much
is
noticeable
neutral
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
this
set
its
one
of
the
sets
that
sent
my
into
a
dark
age
the
birth
of
my
son
contributed
heavily
when
i
first
saw
this
set
i
was
convinced
that
the
earlier
snowspeeder
7130
was
superior
in
every
way
i
liked
the
look
of
the
7130
version
better
i
liked
the
coloration
of
it
better
the
turret
was
better
it
used
a
webbed
6
x
6
dish
after
seeing
this
review
i
realize
i
was
wrong
on
some
accounts
the
cockpit
is
much
more
movie
accurate
the
7130
version
had
two
separate
compartments
this
version
also
came
with
a
tow
cable
something
that
was
lacking
from
the
previous
set
while
i
still
am
unimpressed
with
the
overall
look
of
this
set
it
is
much
less
blocky
which
is
always
a
good
thing
overall
i
still
prefer
7130
to
the
4500
version
but
the
4500
isnt
nearly
as
bad
as
i
first
assumed
and
i
regret
never
buying
one
of
these
when
i
had
my
chance
neutral
great
review
i
bought
this
set
when
it
came
out
but
sold
it
a
couple
years
later
for
some
extra
cash
i
have
no
regrets
selling
this
one
as
i
was
never
really
impressed
with
it
different
story
for
the
4483
atat
oh
how
i
wish
i
still
had
that
one
the
snowspeeder
was
alright
just
didnt
have
any
sort
of
wow
factor
to
it
the
best
part
of
the
set
is
probably
the
rebel
trooper
looking
at
the
last
photo
in
your
review
looks
like
youre
about
to
have
a
major
battle
in
your
hallway
apart
from
the
snowspeeder
motorized
atat
i
see
the
arc170

is
that
a
podracer
i
see
and
what
is
the
set
with
the
treads
its
not
star

looks
like
a
pretty
cool
set
maybe
a
mission
mars
vehicle
positive
podracer
not
sure
where
you
got
that
from
i
didnt
have
them
out
the
set
with
treads
is
a
dino
2010
thing
which
fits
in
well
after
a
bit
of
modding
also
there
are
some
of
the
old

i
always
saw
them
fitting

there
is
a
guy
sitting
there
hes
there
because
on
dine

there
were
no

so
i
made
a

i
have
all

with

it

the

still
the
sturdiest
the

is

you

for
that
its

very
nice

pack
with
2
neat

that
was
indeed
a
set
that
never
appealed
to
me
its
build
was
just
plain
wrong
and
awful
i
only
bought
it
because
i
found
it
on
clearance
at
around
15
$
and
they
had
4
of
them
if
i
had
known
better
then
id
have
bought
all
4
seeing
how
much
that
jango
fett
minifig
is
worth
now
but
i
ended
up
heavily
modifying
it
in
its
propoions
and
now
it
looks
ok
next
to
the
new
slave
one
which
is
the
best
one
of
its
3
incarnations
i
think
negative
you
added
some
decals
to
the
jango
figure
right
they
seem
to
be
suffering
a
little
i
remember
buying
this
set
from
the
discount
tent
after
my
first
visit
to
legoland
windsor
i
wasnt
sure
whether
to
buy
it

in

after
buying
one

its
a
neat
little
addition

i
ended
up
with
that
very
lame
lul
fig
i
just
hate
that
fig
its
completely
useless
we
cant
use
any
part
of
it
for
anything
although
i
only
discovered
yesterday
that
the
lightsaber
blade
was
a
standard
one
and
not
glued
as
i
always
believed
so
all
isnt
completely
lost
in
the
end
i
still
was
rather
disappointed
by
the
set
its
too
full
of
holes
hum
i
think
theres
kind
of
a
paradox
in
that
sentence
but
the
barc
speeder
and
green
clone
are
indeed
fantastic
oh
and
yes
mine
came
with
sand
blue
grill
parts
instead
of
the
transyellow
ones
didnt
realise
it
at
first
and
i
spent
half
an
hour
cursing
thinking
they
forgot
to
put
them
in
the
box
but
in
the
end
i
dont
know
if
the
replacements
are
any
better
since
theyre
supposed
to
represent
some
kind
of
thruster
light
or
something
all
in
all
i
think
its
my
worst
set
not
necessarily
for
the
set
itself
which
is
ok
but
psychologically
theres
too
many
things
that
went
wrong
with
it
neutral
good
set
but
its
flimsy
as
sin
but
that
may
have
been
my
rush

building

got
shoved
off

nice
review
again

i
passed
on
this
one
because
of
the
price
but
its
a
nice
set
good
for
you
for
getting
the
newer
version
with
nonlul
mace
and
an
extra
clone
that
purple
blade
sure
is
a
beauty
the
tank
itself
is
alright
just
an
atat
on
wheels
in
my
opinion
the
turret
is
great
though
and
so
is
the
speeder
bike
i
didnt
realize
that
the
jet
pack
had
two
nailguns
harpoon
guns
on
it
i
thought
that
the
nailgun
was
a

with

when
tlc
released
the
nonluls
version
i
managed
to
swap
they
sent
me
the
new
version
and
a
clone
trooper
iirc
and
i
mailed
them
back
the
old
version
this
was
a
great
set
the
suspension
worked
great
and
it
rolled
magnificently
nice

with
good

again
your

is
a

is
the
rrp
unless
the
price
you
paid
was
#
80

that
was
a
great
idea
i
never
even
thought
to
send
it
back
and
get
the
new
one
with
the
other
clone
and
the
non
lul
windu
positive
i
voted
above
average
as
well
but
back
in
1983
i
would
have
probably
gone
much
lower
sadly
i
wasnt
as
interested
in
minifigs
at
the
time
i
appreciated
the
ones
i
had
but
i
really
just
wanted
ships
or
bases
and
would
have
gladly
passed
this
by
for
something
with
one
or
two
figures
and
a
small
moon
rover
i
skipped
all
of
the
classic
minifig
sets
space
castle
and
town
it
was
only
upon
coming
out
of
my
dark
ages
that
i
went
minifig
crazy
for
me
this
is
above
average
because
of
the
accessories
without
them
its
an
average
set
with
a
small
brick
built
droid
or
a
rover
it
would
be
outstanding
that
said
id
buy
at
least
10
copies
now
though
id
rather
have
a
4
figure
set
with
one
of
each
colour
including
blue
i
never
had
blue
back
then
i
think
castle
lured
me
away
thanks
for
an
interesting
review
it
gives
me
a
chance
to
further
explore
why
i
changed
from
shipset
to
minifig
fan
and
bore
all
of
eb
with
it
neutral
an
ancient
set
revived
from
kimts
collection
just
take
a
look
at
the
box
art
this
is
one
classic
space
minifig
pack
which
deserve
high
rating
and
i
gave
it
above
average
i
never
had
any
of
these
classic
space
figs
before
if
tlg
could
ever
released
this
again
i
am
pretty
sure
i
will
grab
multiple
packs
without
a
glimpse
you
need
to
build
your
space
agentsastronauts
with
a
little
bit
of
accessories
added
to

i
love
this
pack
very
much
thanks
for
sharing
positive
pretty
nice
set
but
the
newer
minifig
packs
had
greater
variety
in
both
the
figures
and
equipment
my
favorite
one
among
all
of
them
is
6704
which
is
also
the
only
instance

wonder
why
this

the

always
loved

that
lego
released
as
i
could
never
get
enough

my
favorite
was
the
set

so
please
dont

turn
into
that
and
to
be
honest
i
dont
care
because
its
an
awesome
figure
tlc
have
made
the
effort
to
print
the

onto
the

so
props
to
them
he
has
the
clone
head
like
the
rest
of

have
in

there
are
no
extra

from

long

not
included
here
interestingother
pieces
printed
piece
rareunusual
pieces
there
are
2
pistons
included
as
well
as
2
weird
looking
technic
pieces
that
serve
as
the
landing
gear
during
the
build
which
might
explain
why
the
set
is
quite
expensive
it
musnt
have
been
cheap
to
manufacture
them
the
build
it
starts
off
relatively
simple
the
first
16
steps
is
getting
the
basic
shape
of
the
cockpit
and
the
mechanism
to
make
the
middle
wing
move
up
and
down
after
that
the
next
few
steps
are
getting
the
landing
gearwing
folding
device
done
its
actually
the
same
thing
so
when
the
wings
move
into
attack
mode
the
landing
gear
retracts
this
is
then
locked
into
place
by
the
white
beams
that
form
the
basic
shape
of
the
fuselage
up
to
step
46
is
the
fuselage
as
well
as
fitting
the
hydraulics
this
is
what
it
looks
like
when
the
fuselage
is
complete
the
cockpit
is
not
air
tight
theres
is
quite
a
big
gap
top
bottom
the
final
few
steps
of
book
1
is
the
construction
of
one
of
the
engines
here
it
is
attatched
the
yellow
bar
is
not
permanent
its
used
to
keep
the
white
bit
at
the
top
from
moving
downwards
the
steps
are
repeated
in
the
second
book
so
that
both
engines
are
now
in
on
to
the
wings
first
one
attatched
the
middle
one
is
attached
now
and
finally
the
last
one
it
is
now
finished
the
pieces
that
are
left
so
youre
probably
wondering
how
does
it
enter
attack
mode
well
can
you
see
this
bar
push
that
bar
to
the
center
and
pick
it
up
the
hydraulics
move
the
central
wing
downwards
as
well
as
the
side
wings
to
enter
attack
mode
the
outer
wings
have
flickfire
missiles
on
them
they
obviously
dont
work
but
it
increases
the
playability
of
the
set
the
cockpit
opens
in
a
similar
way
to
general
greviouss
starfighter
released
last
year
using
a
sliding
mechanism
for
other
pics
see

this

looks

an

those

look
very
bioniclelike
if
they
havent
been

before
id
suspect
they
will
be
not
that
im
a
bionicle
expert
or
anything
it
is
a
shame
that
this
set
only
includes
one
clone
that
seems
to
be
the
only
drawback
to
the

everything
else

great
review
simonjedi
i
really
like
that
you
included
lots
of
photos
of
your
build
i
put
together
my
v19
torrent
last
night
and
i
was
surprised
by
how
heavy
the
completed
ship
is
it
has
some
real
heft
once
its
finished
wow
it
is
a
really
cool
ship
i
was
disappointed
that
the
central
wing
doesnt
really
lock
into
place
once
it
flips
down
it
just
kind
of
droops
there
so
i
attached
a
technic
pin
to
the
locking
arm
so
it
could
plug
into
the
2x4
brick
thats
on
the
underside
of
the
starfighter
this
brick
can
be
seen
in
your
photo
of
the
bottom
of
the
ship
overall
the
build
is
one
of
the
more
confusing
that
ive
seen
i
had
to
dismantle
and
rebuild
the
first
engine
after
i
realized
id
left
out
a
piece
and
i
kept
thinking
of
the
poor
7yearold
that
gets
this
set
as
hisher
very
first
lego
set
ever
negative
the
v19
was
my
first
tcw
set
i
buyed
it
when
i
was
visiting
my
father
i
just
wanted
to
build
it
there
and
i
do
so
but
how
do
you
will
get
sthbig
like
this
with
in
the
train
so
i
had
to
destroy
him
when
i
was
still
home
again
i
had
to
build
it
3
times
because
the
mechanic
dont
works
i
only
can
say
that
the
v19
is
one
of
the
best
tcw
sets
thanks
to
you
for
the
review

just
wanted
to
make

it
looks
pretty

me
3
and
a
bit
hours
to
build
it
although
i
had
some
problems
with
the
technic
and
i
had
to
take
pictures
during
the
build

the
ability
for
it
to
fold
in
and

wowed

i
am
very
impressed
and

getting
this

purely
because
of
this
funciton
i

curious
as

know
why
are
there
sand

on

tlc

around
while
i
do
like
the
functions
and
they
way
it
is
built
i
can
not
get
into
this
model
first
the
price
is
a
bit
steep
i
know
all
the
cw
sets
are
expensive
but
this
one
just
seems
more
so
to
me
i
mean
there
is
only
1

second
to
me
there
is
no
playability

correct

love

i
might
note
though
that
the

is
just
there
as
a

when
disenegaged
the

function
still
works
just
not

interestingly
though
the
cylinder
is
an
old

i
have
a

others
its
just
that
this
is
the

its
been

i
had
no
problems
assembling
this
set
positive
having
just
bought
myself
a
copy
of
the
wonderful
metroliner
4558
i
felt
like
doing
a
review
before
we
start
id
like
to
thank
greenhair
for
selling
me
one
of
his
metroliners
for
a
mere
80
euros
granted
the
motor
trainstation
and
tracks
werent
included
but
i
did
get
an
extra
railcar
instead
please
note
that
i
have
included
the
fourth
wagon
in
the
final
pic
but
that
the
official
set
includes
just
three
wagons
the
metroliner
was
released
in
1992
and
was
extremely
popular
amongst
lego
fans
the
set
a
picture
of
the
box
showing
the
set
completely
pic
taken
from
peeron
and
one
of
the
minifigs
and
the
accessories
as
you
may
notice
tlc
was
extremely
generous
supplying
us
with
a
grand
total
of
11
minifgs
amongst
which
no
less
than
4
female
minifigs
ah
the
population
crisis
is
finally
over
we
also
have
three
suitcases
three
cups
and
a
small
freight
parcel
and
freight
handling
thingy
normally
this
would
include
two
bicycles
a
red
and
a
black
one
a
general
side
view
of
the
three
carriages
thanks
to
greenhair
and
the
brickster
and
heres
one
of
the
extra
carriage
thanks
to
greenhair
and
the
brickster
moving
onto
the
front
and
back
carriage
which
are
externally
identical
please
note
that
greenhair
changed
my
back
carriages
headlights
these
would
be
yellow
in
the
normal
set
all
the
doors
in
the
entire
set
are
printed
pieces
sorry
for
the
bad
picture
quality
in
this
one
the
interior
of
the
two
however
is
laid
out
a
bit
differently
the
space
in
the
front
carriage
is
occupied
by
a
cockpit
or
whatever
it
is
called
in
trains
and
some
space
to
store
your
cable
connecting
the
front
lights
with
the
engine
i
can
imagine
it
must
get
quite
cramped
and
dangerous
for
the
minifig
driver
with
all
the
cabling
further
back
we
have
a
quite
random
weird
looking
engine
one
part
reminded
me
rather
of
a
jet
engine
on
a
commercial
airplane
the
engine
is
accessible
by
means
of
the
two
side
cargo
doors
at
the
end
of
our
first
carriage
we
hit
what
looks
like
the
trains
restaurant
two
tables
and
no
chairs
the
two
middle
carriages
are
identical
both
have
a
small
sink
nicely
hidden
from
the
intervening
and
impolite
looks
of
fellow
passengers
the
carriage
further
contains
two
tables
and
four
seats
two
cargo
spaces
are
nicely
tucked
away
from
view
below
the
tables
our
final
carriage
has
a
back
cockpit
as
well
but
differs
from
the
front
carriage
in
the
central
cargo
area
where
our
train
employee
is
hard
at
work
earning
his
lego
nickels
and
the
rear
sleeping
area
the
bed
is
a
double
one
the
upper
one
able
to
be
flipped
up
for
somewhat
difficult
access
to
the
lower
one
the
train
station
i
could
not
take
photos
off
since
it
was
not
included
in
the
purchase
judging
from
the
building
plans
however
i
feel
it
was
thrown
in
at
the
end
just
to
add
something
to
the
set
its
construction
is
very
simple
consisting
of
a
few
grey
plates
on
top
of
a
few
pillars
access
is
provided
by
a
plate
which
is
connected
to
the
platform
with
a
few
hinges
there
are
however
two
lamp
posts
a
timetable
and
a
few
chairs
so
if
you
dont
like
the
platform
you
can
still
use
these
parts
in
a
variety
of
other
constructios
to
end
off
i
took
a
pic
of
the
complete
set
with
extra
wagon
and
a
friendly
surprised
train
driver
opening
the
door
and
greeting
the
camera
man
conclusion
being
a
90s
set
the
train
basically
builds
itself
the
entire
build
cost
me
two
hours
and
a
half
i
lost
quite
some
time
simply
admiring
the
set
and
was
extremely
straightforward
with
no
suprises
at
all
but
i
need
to
admit
it
has
its
charm
the
exterior
is
simply
amazing
the
sleekness
of
the
design
the
colours
it
matches
perfectly
i
believe
however
that
a
width
of
8
studs
would
be
more
to
scale
but
6
wide
still
looks
amazing
the
interior
is
somewhat
simplistic
but
is
easily
moddeable
with
a
few
extra
pieces
i
basically
bought
the
train
as
a
parts
pack
the
standard
set
three
wagons
includes
no
less
than
8
train
doors
with
windows
14
train
windows
4
smaller
longer
ones
and
4
freight
doors
the
front
and
back
of
course
count
as
unique
pieces
as
well
one
feature
i
am
displeased
with
are
the
printed
doors
i
like
printed
pieces
and
while
the
bluewhitered
stripe
looks
beautiful
on
the
side
the
printed
doors
kind
of
limit
mocing
capabilities
to
carriages
with
a
stripe
on
the
side
i
considered
simply
removing
the
stripe
but
i
found
out
i
could
just
get
normal
grey
ones
from
bricklink
for
a
fair
price
i
am
very
pleased
with
the
train
but
since
you
already
know
my
opinion
feel
free
to
tell
us
yours
of
this
fabulous
set

more
positive
thanks
for
the
edit
hinckley
its
my
first
poll
and
review
and
i
wasnt
quite
sure
if
i
got
it
right
maiq
the

on

am
said
but
seriously
why
is
there
a
civilian
train
stop
in
a
cave
did
1
too
many
people
get
lost
playing
zork
yeah
i
also
wondered
why
the
included
timetable
includes
not
only
real
life
cities
instead
of
brick
ones
even
more
so
since
the
train
track
just
goes
round
d
neutral
cool
review
i
actually
have
two
of
these
i
got
one
for
christmas
when
it
was
rereleased
in
2003
and
another
one
in
a
charity
shop
a
few
months
later
for
$
5
i
love
the
minifigs
even
if
they
all
have
smileys
and
having
two
sets
of
them
can
really
fill
up
a
town
positive
its
great
to
see
someone
reviewing
a
train
this
set
is
definately
a
five
lego
hasnt
made
a
complete
train
set
like
this
in
a
long
time
the
metroliner
is
really
a
legend
among
classic
trains
the
great
level
of
playability
and
detailing
makes
it
a
terrific
model
specifically
i
was
just
noticing
the
details
of
the
passenger
car
it
has
a
sink
how
cool
is
that
and
11
minifigs
when
was
the
last
time
lego
included
11
figs
in
a
single
set
a
truly
outstanding
train
set
thanks
for
sharing
images
as
ive
always
wanted
to
see
it
upclose
it
would
be
awesome
if
you
could
share
some
single
side
shots
of
the
cars
positive
im
not
normally
that
big
into
trains
but
this
set
has
a
real
coolness
factor
that
sets
it
apart
from
most
of
the
others
the
color
scheme
is
the
same
one
that
amtrak
and
many
local
subway
systems
use
i
picked
it
up
along
with
the
club
car
expansion
when
they
were
rereleased
in
2001
i
have
made
various
modifications
to
mine
rearranging
the
car
layouts
and
adding
a
second
train
motor
into
the
rearmost
car
along
with
another
set
of
lights
so
that
both
ends
light
up
as
you
said
it
would
be
great
to
have
an
8stud
version
of
this
so
you
could
fit
in
two
rows
of
seats
side
by
side
that
might
make
a
nice
mod
project
at
some
point
positive
outstanding
train
set
the
legend
of
the
entire
train
series
is
the
metroliner
this
is
a
super
5
set
the
color
design
minifigs
is
just
so
perfect
and
lovely
it
resemble
the
trains
which
we
see
on
our
rails
in
our
daily
life
i
cant
find
any
flaws
on
this
at
all
the
only
flaw
i
noticed
is
my
mistake
of
not
able
to
buy
this
set
at
all
in
fact
i
had
never
seen
this
set
in
the
shops
before
in
my
entire

i
always
wished
tlg
would
have
made
the

ir

longer
and
maybe
used
some
of
the
nice
features
of
this

still

am
said
the
interior
of
the
two
however
is
laid
out
a
bit
differently
the
space
in
the
front
carriage
is
occupied
by
a
cockpit
or
whatever
it
is
called
in
trains
and
some
space
to
store
your
cable
connecting
the
front
lights
with
the
engine
i
can
imagine
it
must
get
quite
cramped
and
dangerous
for
the
minifig
driver
with
all
the
cabling
further
back
we
have
a
quite
random
weird
looking
engine
one
part
reminded
me
rather
of
a
jet
engine
on
a
commercial
airplane
the
engine
is
accessible
by
means
of
the
two
side
cargo
doors
at
the
end
of
our
first
carriage
we
hit
what
looks
like
the
trains
restaurant
two
tables
and
no
chairs
there
shouldnt
be
so
much
of
the
light
cable
in
the
front
section
or
cockpit
most
of
the
cable
should
be
in
the
central
part
of
the
train
then
it
is
not
so
crowded
for
the
engine
driver
i
have
never
had
a
problem
with
the
cable
and
the
space
available
for
it
the
only
problem
i
had
was
that
the
cable
had
a
loose
contact
after
some
time
when
the
train
went
into
a
curve
cant
remember
if
it
was
a
left
or
right
curve
the
light
went
off
i
have
now
got
the
same
problem
with
the
cable
that
i
put
into
my
santa
fe
super
chief
always
when
the
engine
turns
into
a
right
curve
the
light
goes
off
my
dad
could
repair
the
cable
for
the
metroliner
even
though
he
is
quite
skilled
at
repairing
electronic
things
he
found
it
very
difficult
to
repair
since
there
were
no
screws
to
open
the
electronic
plate
it
annoyed
him
a
lot
so
ive
been
asking
myself
if
i
should
really
bother
him
with
a
second
cable
with
the
same
problem
the
train
set
itself
is
outstanding
and
thats
what
i
voted
for
i
only
have
the
legend
10001
but
its
99
identical
to
4558
i
also
have
club
car
4547
i
dont
have
the
legend
club
car
10002
the
reason
for
this
is
i
always
had
the
choice
between
one
big
lego
set
or
several
small
ones
for
christmas
when
i
was
a
child
i
always
went
for
several
small
ones
metroliner
4558
would
have
been
a
big
train
set
but
i
really
wanted
a
passenger
car
so
i
bought
4547
with
my
savings
without
having
the
metroliner
i
was
quite
happy
when
the
metroliner
was
rereleased
i
bought
it
with
my
own
money
then
i
could
finally
use
the
club
car
with
the
train
it
was
created

never

i
spent
a
long
time
after
one
christmas
trying
to
get
and
failed
miserably
admittedly
i
was
much
younger
then
it
has
however
remained
one
of
my
most
sought
after
items
but
i
've
still
never
got
around
to
getting
one
the
set
generally
makes
me
rather
nostalgic
for
a
time
when
the
trains
were
painted
in
simple
liveries
like
that
one
anyway
it
seems
an
excellent
set
from
what
i
've
seen
and
the
figure
selection
is
amazing
i
hope
lego
produce
something
as
good
as
this

are

this

would
sell

alone
would
go
insane
buying
these
up
for

the

black

that
allow

unique

heres
the

it
looks
a
little
small
for
an

for
a

its
awesome

some

i
just
got
mine
as
well
by
paying
quite
a
high
price
for
it
since
its
exclusive
to
us
however
i
had
not

yet

i
left
it
in

i
gave
it
for
an
above

for
that
cool
little
jeep
for
an

this
is
certainly
one
of
the
best

i
had
ever

i
like
its
construction
built
if
this
is

i
cant

its

in

put

give

we

the

this
is
the
worst
one
in
my
opinion
i
never
liked
those
white
guys
and
they
get
easily
damaged
by
the
sun
nah
give
me
a
red
or
yellow
instead
later
blue
or
black
even
though
they
get
damaged
by

easily
theyre
my
favorite
kind

i
voted
average
its
a
cute
set
and
one
which
i
built
from
parts
many
times
as
a
kid
i
didnt
own

thanks
for
this
review
if
youd
only
know
what
memories
you
brought
back
i
think
i
remember
this
set
better
than
any
other
i
had
when
i
was
a
child
some
time
after
i
got
it
i
decided
to
disassemble
it
and
combine
it
with
the
jeep
from
6552
rocky
river
retreat
it
came
out
pretty
good
though
as
it
became
the
main
attraction
point
of
my
town
beeing
the
car
of
my
favourite
minifig
back
then
and
and
and
looong
story
i
kept
it
assembled
that
way
from
this
day
on
until
earlier
this
year
when
i
finally
disassembled
it
because
i
needed
the
parts

a

i
am
kind

they
they
didint
continue
the
theme

i
only
managed
to
grab
6487
and
6550

the

this

is
very

its

why
exactly
did
the
outback

never
quite
catch
onjust
a
thought
what
a
great
set
i
wish
i
had
it
but
in
1997
i
was
just
back
from
my
whirl
wind
trips
around
the
world
and
had
drifted
away
from
lego
i
dont
know
why
but
i
will
say
this
i
love
the
actual
suspension
that
came
with
this
set
and
the
trains
sets
i
have
been
trying
to
buy
up
as
much
of
it
as
i
can

i
need

at
leat
you
were
able
to
pick
up
two
of
the
sets
do
you
still
have
them
andor
the
pieces
yes
i
have
the
parts
the
manuals
and
even
one
of
the
boxes
unforutunaltey
the
parts
are
mixed
in
a
big
pile
of
parts
as
i
never
had
any
time
to
sort
out
my
parts
you
can
see
i
used
the
yellow
doors
here
decals
applied
the
great
thing
about
the
copter
was
it
had
2
suitcases
which
as
far
as
i
can
tell
aint
a
common
part
not
rare
but
still
nice
to
have
and
it
had
the
guy
with
the
green
jacket
the
winch
wasnt
bad
either
the
only
flaw
was
it
was
a
standard
lego
copter
meaning
similar
ones
where
avalible
in
quite
a
few
sets
do
you
plan
to
review
it
staudie

nice
review
of
an
interesting

but
i
have
a
query
anyone
know
why
it
is
actually
called
amazon
crossing
when
its
meant
to
be
in
australia
also
the
amazon
runs

nice
review
this
set
looked
very
nice
for
its
time
positive
ok
this
is
the
big
one
the
controversial
one
the
one
everyone
either
hates
or
defends
what
do
i
think
read
on
the
figs
bandana
man
masked
dude
dude
with
shades
good
figures
i
miss
scarface
comes
with
his
torso
though
which
is
my
favorite
the
one
with
the
ammo
strap
across
the
chest
one
figure
short
of
the
figuretoprice
value
but
we
can
deal
with
that
the
dino
the
dino
its
the
one
that
comes
with
the
chopper
in
green
any
questions
the
tank
and
so
it
begins
i
think
it
looks
a
lot
better
in
person
than
on
the
box
the
left
side
good
time
to
mention
that
the
treads
run
pretty
easily
and
this
is
a
very
playable
set
right
side
keep
an
eye
on
that
flap
in
the
center
and
we
have
a
folding
ladder
the
back
probably
the
weakest
point
of
the
set
apart
from
the
dino
the
turret
turned
and
tilted
the
mechanism
works
extremely
well
and
the
gun
seems
to
work
better
than
others
for
some
reason
or
maybe
it
just
seems
that
way
the
front
of
the
cockpit
im
at
a
loss
trying
to
figure
out
how
those
tiny
windshields
defend
them
against
40foot
mutant
tyrannosaurus
rexes
with
radioactive
breath
laser
eyes
and
what
have
you
anyway
another
one
of
those
neat
steering
wheels
some
viking
horns
and
some
stickered
control
panels
oh
yeah
this
set
has
a
good
amount
of
stickers
probably
around
20ish
the
back
of
the
cockpit
i
love
the
little
gun
it
turns
360
degrees
and
tilts
up
oh
yeah
and
those
green
barrels
theyve
been
using
are
awesome
i
can
think
of
tons
of
uses
for
them

the

of

is
the
price
i
would
easily
pay
30

this
no
questions
asked
but
40
was
a
hard
sell
for
me
i
gave
in
merely
to
see
what
i
would
think
of
it
and
also
to
help
you
guys
find
out
the
same
this
is
a
great
display
set
and
a
great
play
set
the
pieces
are
good
lots
of
nice
blay
beams
used
in
the
construction
but
the
price
people
thats
the
killer
pick
this
up
only
if
you
have
everything
else
or
you
find
it
on
clearance
and
thus
ends
my

you

neutral

totally

with
you
jay
this

has
very
nice
details
suche
as
the
mini
gun
movable
ladder
green
barrels
and
great
figs
however
it
is
very
expensive
for
what
it
is

i
dont
think
there
are
that
many
very
usefall
parts
in
there
well
i
could
use
those
treads
if
i
ever
buy
this

really
not

i
totally
dislike

for

reviews
once

it
looks
like
qite
a
nice
set
to
me
although
the
european
version
will
lose
the
big
gun
i
like
some
of
the
stickers
although
i
wish
they
were
printed
and
i
actually
quite
like
the

probably
wont

grew
finally
a

and
the
verdict

it
appeared
that
in

was
running
something
that
looked

an
intergalactic

blocky

went
from

to
one
of

liked
of

pretty
much
instantly
its
a
mark
of
that
dislike
that
in
the
eb

feeding
frenzy
nobody
has
so
far
even
bothered
to
post
a
few
pics
of
this
set
even
2
weeks
after
its
official
release
im
here
to
redress
that
imbalance
now
and
find
out
if
7680
is
as
horrendous
as
everyone
originally
thought
part
1
box
parts
front
of
the
box
its
quite
big
same
size
as
the
10144
sandcrawler
annoyingly
its
the
old
style
with
the
perforated
corners
that
you
have
to
tear
to
flip
open
the
lid
detail
of
the
back
showing
set
functions
interior
of
the
box
a
lot
of
wasted
space
the
set
comes
with
2
instruction
manuals
each
76
pages
and
no
dss
sheet
polybags
13
of
em
like
the
other
cw
sets
these
are
unnumbered
parts
ahoy
you
can
tell
at
a
glance
that
this
set
is
comparable
to
the
atte
although
there
a
large
proportion
of
the
800
parts
here
are
technic
pins
and
bley
plates
part
2
minifigs
and
build
the
set
comes
with
4
figs
or
35
depending
on
how
you
look
at
rotta
anakin
ahsoka
r2d2
and
rotta
very
disappointing
that
theres
nothing
new
here
for
such
a
highpriced
exclusive
although
i
guess
it
is
maybe
movie
accurate
anyway
to
paraphrase
the
wise
patsy
stone
you
can
never
have
enough
hats
shoes
or
new
anakin
ahsoka
hairpieces
so
its
not
too
bad
pics
of
the
build
in
progress
a
quarter
of
the
way
through
we
can
already
see
that
this
is
one
of
those
convoluted
technic
frames
with
some
plates
affixed
type
builds
halfway
and
the
smaller
wing
is
added
at
the
three
quarter
mark
the
giant
single
wing
is
added
and
voila
done
the
final
quarter
is
a
race
to
attach
all
the
exterior
surfaces
and
details
such
as
the
engine
and
escape
pod
the
build
itself
is
a
mixed
blessing
it
is
very
technic
oriented
im
not
a
technically
minded
person
and
dont
really
have
much
of
a
conceptual
grasp
of
how
everything
functions
until
i
see
the
final
result
so
i
find
these
type
of
builds
a
little
uninteresting
pins
axles
and
beams
give
me
bricks
any
day
i
really
liked
the
7676
gunship
and
the
7679
fighter
tank
although
they
do
contain
some
technic
framework
they
are
largely
brickbuilt
ships
especially
the
fighter
tank
which
is
solid
largely
brick
built
and
full
of
neat
functions
the
7680
build
is
one
of
the
most
technicy
builds
ive
ever
undergone
in
a
system
set
akin
to
the
experience
of
building
the
10178
motorised
atat
but
whereas
with
that
set
you
could
understand
the
need
for
a
technic
framework
the
thing
walks
a
lot
of
this
seemed
excessive
yes
the
twilight
does
some
have
nice
functions
and
it
is
so
large
and
heavy
it
does
need
a
strong
skeleton
but
to
me
it
just
seemed
too
much
and
aesthetics
have
been
sacrificed
for
in
some
cases
limited
functionality
i
will
discuss
in
more
detail
what
i
mean
as
i
look
at
different
parts
of
the
set
on
the
upside
this
is
the
only
nonsymmetric
set
in
the
cw
range
so
at
least
every
page
and
new
step
brings
something
different
part
3
a
closer
view
closeup
of
the
main
body
of
the
ship
fronton
it
is
welldesigned
how
the
figs
appear
in
line
of
sight
unlike
the
6211
where
jabba
and
leia
were
photoshopped
in
to
the
box
art
dont
ask
what
rotta
is
doing
out
of
the
line
of
vision
there
some
things
are
better
left
unsaid
side
view
showing
escape
pod
smaller
cylinder
and
drive
top
view
rear
view
showing
back
door
the
rear
deck
is
huge
indeed
the
whole
ship
is
huge
oddly
so
i
dont
know
if
this
is
moviescale
or
not
but
ive
seen
people
complain
the
fighter
tank
is
too
big
and
that
set
is
nothing
compared
to
this
baby
its
wider
than
the
gunship
and
in
wingspan
and
length
is
almost
bigger
heres
a
few
pics
next
to
an
mtt
for
comparison
pretty
big
hey
turning
to
the
dark
side
must
be
good
for
business
even
if
all
you
can
buy
is
a
rusty
old
beast
like
this
at
least
you
could
comfortably
squash
pretty
much
every
vehicle
in
the
opposing
fleet
just
by
landing
on
it
at
least
now
you
can
see
why
it
costs
so
much
the
official
pics
make
it
look
smaller
somehow
by
truncating
the
rear
and
wing
the
ship
is
in
fact
so
big
you
cant
really
pose
it
with
wings
open
only
hold
it
that
way
i
was
too
lazy
to
build
a
giant
transclear
support
strut
so
propped
it
up
on
a
shoebox
instead
the
wing
opens
very
neatly
you
push
a
technic
lever
and
a
pin
holding
the
bottom
wing
pops
out
quite
smoothly
the
little
top
turret
can
move
up
and
down
as
well
to
get
the
full
crossshaped
effect
part
4
features
and
functions
the
front
cockpit
folds
down
very
neatly
although
i
find
the
build
here
a
little
weak
whee
it
goes
all
the
way
down
to
the
floor
the
mechanism
is
cool
but
it
takes
up
an
awful
lot
of
space
basically
the
whole
front
is
cockpit
and
all
lego
could
manage
for
controls
is
2
printed
1x2
tiles
as
well
not
pictured
here
but
theyre
attached
to
the
part
that
folds
up
and
down
theres
also
no
way
for
anyone
to
get
in
or
out
of
the
cockpit
and
an
invisible
windscreen
technology
has
come
a
long
way
side
view
looking
from
wing
r2d2
is
here
as
well
as
some
tools
you
can
also
glimpse
here
one
of
the
main
problems
with
the
set
despite
being
a
huge
boxy
ship
theres
no
interior
none
the
twilight
doesnt
even
have
an
internal
floor
all
the
room
inside
is
taken
up
by
the
landing
gear
which
folds
up
again
a
clever
function
but
it
really
gets
in
the
way
of
the
set
as
a
whole
kudos
to
the
designer
for
coming
up
with
stable
working
landing
gear
but
too
clever
by
half
if
it
means
that
this
giant
ship
ends
up
basically
being
one
tiny
cockpit
and
a
rear
door
at
the
back
that
doesnt
lead
to
any
interior
underside
showing
landing
gear
when
open
and
closed
when
the
wing
is
folded
down
the
gear
is
locked
in
place
which
is
pretty
neat
spaceconsuming
but
neat
the
rear
section
the
door
when
opened
reveals
an
orange
cupboard
and
a
towline
as
ahsoka
uses
in
the
box
art
the
door
clicks
into
place
when
open
and
can
be
released
by
pressing
the
technic
bit
at
the
top
again
clever
but
pointless
as
you
cant
get
inside
ahsoka
can
indulge
in
a
little
recreational
bungeejumping
if
she
so
wishes
the
rear
deck
is
so
large
that
it
is
wasted
just
being
used
so
ahsoka
can
bungeejump
i
came
up
with
a
much
better
use
for
it
outdoor
garden
despite
having
one
roboticised
hand
anakin
was
still
quite
the
green
thumb
and
his
lightsaber
was
very
useful
as
a
hedge
trimmer
so
much
so
that
he
set
up
a
side
business
between
rottarescue
missions
heres
a
promotional
postcard
a
few
other
bits
and
pieces
the
gun
turret
on
the
enormous
megawing
can
only
hold
one
flick
fire
missile
at
a
time
you
do
get
two
though
rear
engine
detail
the
escape
pod
sits
neatly
on
the
side
and
is
basically
built
the
same
way
as
the
gunship
bacta
tank
the
pod
sits
on
these
tehcnic
pins
and
is
held
in
place
by
the
light
bley
parts
part
5
in
conclusion
the
twilight
is
a
huge
ship
with
a
huge
amount
of
great
functions
folding
wing
folding
cockpit
rear
door
escape
pod
retractable
landing
gear
but
this
functionality
comes
at
a
price
a
very
complex
technic
build
and
zip
interior
compared
with
the
gunship
for
example
which
is
stuffed
with
nooks
and
crannies
the
twilight
suffers
in
this
respect
i
also
think
it
is
just
too
large
it
doesnt
really
fit
with
the
other
craft
and
vehicles
released
with
the
clone
wars
line
i
may
be
wrong
and
it
is
movieaccurate
but
when
you
have
all
the
cw
sets
laid
out
it
does
stick
out
like
a
poor
thumb
part
selection
is
ok
with
the
only
interesting
things
being
a
few
dark
orange
plates
the
orange
cupboard
and
the
big
transneon
green
radar
dish
dont
get
me
wrong
i
dont
think
this
is
a
bad
set
at
all
its
just
the
other
cw
sets
are
so
sweet
i
would
say
its
an
above
average
set
in
a
field
crammed
with
excellent
ones
if
youre
a
completist
buy
it
but
if
for
example
youd
rather
invest
in
another
atte
to
upgrade
your
republic
army
then
i
couldnt
really
disagree
with
you
either
and
to
finish
on
a
light
note
id
like
to
remind
you
that
you
do
get
another
ahsoka
hairpiece
which
can
be
used
for
all
sorts
of
things
ugha
warrior
upgrade
dr
inferno
hair
transplant
and
finally
attack
of
the
deadly
blueringed
octopus
native
to
australias
beaches
and
oceans
thanks
for
reading
neutral
really
awesome
review
sveltecorps
you
did
a
really
complete
and
indepth
review
of
this
beast
and
with
your
nice
pics
is
really
enjoyable
reading
your
review
so
congrats
i
like
this
ship
even
if
it
looks
so
bulky
but
i
need
to
buy
first
other
sets
so
maybe
this
beast
will
be
landing
in
my
collection
the
next
year
or
this
one
if
i
am
lucky
i
can
just
ask
for
something
can
you
post
a
pic
of
all
your
clone
wars
sets
together
with
this
one
all
the
sets
in
one
pic
not
many
pics
with
this
an
each
set
please

i
think
a
lot
of
people
feel
the
same
way
there
was
so
much
good
stuff
to
get
in
the
first
wave
that
this
is
probably
a
backburner
set
for
a
lot
of
people
and
some
are
probably
waiting
to
see
the
movie
to
see
how
prominently
it
features
i
will
try
and
take
a
pic
with
some
other
cw
sets
i
dont
have
all
of
them
though
and
some
need
to
be
reassembled
as
i
built
them
on
holiday
and
then
had
to
pack
them
away
i
do
think
this
line
of
sets
has
been
the
best
sw
lego
wave
released
though
all
of
the
recent
releases
have
been
amazing
in
their
own
way
neutral
thanks
for
the
review
now
i
thinnk
i
will
buy
this
set
btw
i
really
like
what
you
did
to
the
back
i
might
do
the
same
to
mine
positive
wow
certainly
much
bigger
than
i
would
have
thought
thanks
for
the
great
review
and
pictures
well
for
some
reason
i
was
drawn
to
this
set
but
with
the
lack
of
interior
and
quite
a
bit
of
technics
i
think
ill
pass
or
at
least
get
the
atte
first
thanks
again
neutral
i
read
the
visual
guide
recently
and
learned
a
bit
more
about
the
twilight
i
wont
get
into
spoilers
but
it
seems
that
the
ship
becomes
a
sort
of
endearing
family
van
for
the
characters
which
is
neat
big
bulky
uncool
but
it
gets
you
from
one
place
to
another
if
it
factors
into
more
than
just
the
90
minute
film
i
may
pick
this
up
it
seems
that
theres
room
for
a
lot
of
personality
in
this
ship
once
you
see
the
film
it
is
a
corellian
freighter
smuggling
spice
for
the
hutts
thats
cool
right
neutral
thanks
a
lot
for
a
very
nice
and
entertaining
review
your
photos
were
really
nice
and
there
have
been
some
reviews
lately
that
have
such
blurry
pics
cough
cough
it
was
a
pleasure
to
see
you
can
1
put
lego
bricks
together
2
write
a
review
3
handle
your
camera
i
think
this
ship
is
underrated
it
is
really
nice
i
love
the
playing
features
like
landing
gear
and
back
door
perhaps
just
cause
i
had
to
get
along
with
so
called
landing
gears
in
the
past
that
did
not
work
at
all
7140
for
example
and
i
simply
love
that
there
is
space
inside
you
said
there
is
not
really
some
cause
of
the
landing
gear
mechanism
but
it
seems
it
should
be
easily
fixed
do
you
think
there
is
enough
space
to
put
some
plates
over
the
landing
gear
and
add
some
beds
kitchen
und
tv
i
think
this
set
is
so
perfect
to
mod
it
into
a
clone
wars
mobile
home
your
back
garden
ist
just
perfect
for
this
i
prefer
this
over
the
atte
and
over
a
2nd
gunship

a
lot

the

with

lay

etc
on
the
only
issue
is
that
its
kind
of
fiddly
to
access
you
could
do
it
from
either
the
side
door
or
rear
door
though
maybe
move
that
tow
line
at
the
back
i
have
to
say
it
is
a
set
that
grows
on
you
positive
thank
you
sveltecorps
for
the
review
i
like
the
inside
nice
and
cosey
i
also
like
your
little
garden
for
me
this
put
the
twilight
different
in
a
better
perspective

my
first
perspective
of
the
twilight
i
voted
outstanding
greets
theforce
neutral
seems
like
tlc
has
done
a
pretty
accurate
representation
of
the
ship
the
real
fault
for
the
ships
messy
design
has
to
go
to
lucasfilm
not
tlc
my
guess
is
lucasfilm
is
trying
to
recapture
that
what
a
piece
of
junk
magic
of
the
millennium
falcon
i
guess
well
have
to
wait
to
see
the
movie
to
see
if
they
succeeded
or
not
the
idea
of
a
space
mobile
home
reminds
me
of
the
winnebago
from
spaceballs
great
review
informative
entertaining
and
opinionated
so
many
people
shy
away
from
stating
an
actual
opinion
in
their
review
for
fear
of
offending
anyone
whats
the
point
of
making
a
review
if
you
dont
state
what
you
think
about
it
neutral
i
think
some
people
agree
that
this
ship
is
better
than
when
we
first
saw
those
pictures
at
least
i
do
it
looks
like
it
has
some
nice
accessories
that
come
with
the
ship
as
well
my
favorite
of
you
custom
things
has
got
to
be
the
octopus
its
so
funny
and
a
great
use
for
the
headdress
thing

not
the

a
good
source

and
a

nothing
more
positive
i
bought
four
of
these
sets
i
guess
this
was
the
best
selling
impulse
set
so
far
great
idea
to
have
weapons
and
helmet
choice
as
for
the
price
id
say
7090
is
surprisingly
cheap
positive
very
good
set
indeed
the
possibility
to
alter
the
knights
appearance
hugely
boosts
the
value
very
smart
thinking
of
tlc
got
one
of
these
so
far
but
if
i
ever
do
a
castlerelated
comic
or
animation
this
will
be
the
set
i
buy
tons
of
positive
argh
what
i
was
typing
kept
getting
deleted
by
my
stupid
keyboard
on
topic
this
looks
like
a
great
little
set
i
could
use
a
few
of
these
but
i
havent
seen
any
at
a
local
store
too
bad
for
me
i
suspose
great
review
and
i
like
the
green
plate
on
the
bottom
never
can
have
too
many
greens
for
my
small
but
expanding
swamp
im
building
hope
i
can
pick
some
of
these
up
eventualy
positive
this
little
bugger
brought
me
back
from
my
dark
ages
as
a
movie
fan
i
just
couldnt
resist
the
thought
of
making
an
animation
with
living
lego
skeletons
im
referring
to
ray
harryhausens
work
on
the
classic
jason
and
the
argonauts
here
buying
the
indy
sets
stopped
me
from
getting
a
lot
more
castle
sets
though
in
time
i
added
the
final
joust
the
wizard
and
the
impulse
knight
to
my
collection
as
well
as
buying
more
unique
figs
king
princess
from
expensive
castle
sets
off
bricklink
so
yeah
great
little
set
two
crownies
a
skeleton
and
a
skeletal
horse
you
just
can
not
resist
that
even
if
you
hadnt
been
buying
lego
for
5
years
as
far
as
im
concerned
this
set
is
one
for
the
ages
i
love
it
positive
this
is
an
awesome
set
in
my
opinion
i
scraped
my
crossbows
for
mocing
recently
but
the
set
is
still
an
amazing
army
builder
for
the
price
for
the
sw
battlepacks
which

the

not

its
a

simple

it
serves
its
purpose
very
well
the
crown
knight
got
ta
love
that
guy
he
looks
like
nothing
can
hurt
him
he
even
got
a
selfsufficient
smile
on
his
face
im
sure
hes
convinced
that
no
skeleton
can
defeat
him
also
the
horse
its
barding
and
the
headcover
looks
awesome
a
great
old
school
sword
and
the
ever
cool
normannic
shield
what
could
possibly
go
wrong
for
this
knight
the
helmet
i
really
love
imo
its
a
lot
better
than
the
old
knight
helmets
see
review
of
5615
the
knight
for
a
pic
of
one
of
those
the
skeleton
knight
the
black
skeleton
horse
rocks
i
love
that
design
and
in
black
its
even
badder
than
than
the
white
version
the
shield
reeks
of
dread
and
the
knight
is
one
bad
skeleton
on
the
rampage
i
do
find
that
the
helmet
is
a
little
off
id
rather
have
a
black
knights
helmet
instead
the
kk
helmet
doesnt
really
do
it
for
me
the
all
in
all
verdict
this
is
another
great
army
builder
set
it
holds
a
lot
of
great
weapons
some
cool
minifigs
and
great
pieces
the
only
thing
that
puzzles
me
is
why
would
a
crown
knight
joust
a
skeleton
doesnt
really
make
sense
kimt
positive
ive
been
waiting
to
hold
this
set
in
my
hands
for
about
a
year
and
a
half
thanks
to
a
silly
tlc
decision
7009
was
not
available
in
italian
stores
i
finally
decided
to
buy
it
on
the
net
2x
plus
some
other
sets
and
those
morons
at
the
custom
charged
me
quite
a
lot
after
i
bought
it
while
waiting
for
it
to
arrive
i
found
out
it
was
available
in
a
store
in
switzerland
not
far
away
from
home
thats
for
the
storytelling
as
for
the
set
i
thought
it
was
great
and
still
think
so
a
good
army
builder
as
quite

few
sets

nice

cool

for
the

cool
black
skeletal
horse
on
the
dark
knights
side
loving
the
printed
armours
of
both
knights
and
as
opposed
to
kimt
apparently
i
really
dig
the
black
helmet
i
feel
theres
a
lord
of
the
ringsflavour
to
it
with
those
curves
well
designed
positive
i
should
really
get
one
more
of
these
for
the
figures
shields
and
weapons
this
set
is
the
only
one
with
the
scythe
in
pearlgrey
by
the
way
the
only
thing
that
puzzles
me
is
why
would
a
crown
knight
joust
a
skeleton
good
question
for
a
joust
to
make
sense
this
set
should
contain
two
human
knights
instead
which
would
be
fine
with
me
so
long
as
they
had
differing
armour
and
colours

this

is
a
great
little
bundle
the
kitted
out
knight
skellie
knight
weapons
and
the
few
bricks
for
the
fence
and
weapon
rack
the
castle
07
barding
here
is
very
nice
indeed
the
colour
scheme
of
the
new
castle
guys
is
great
imo
the
light
blue
and
blue
work
nicely
together
and
against
the
grey
background
i
dont
really
like
the
pearl
grey
helmet
it
would
be
nicer
in
metallic
silver
like
the
visor
i
think
interesting
comment
re
the
skellie
helmet
i
guess
black
normal
knights
helmet
with
visor
would
be
quite
nice
for
him
i
got
this
set
as
part
of
the
complete
castle
collection
from
sh
however
i
have
extras
of
all
the
smaller
sets
and
skeleton
tower
except
i
dont
have
another
one
of
this
set
its
on
my
list
of
sets
to
buy
unfortunately
it
wasnt
on
sh
for
ireland
when
i
was
making
later
orders
quite
an
odd
omission
also
last
year
castle
07
was
exclusive
to
argos
uk
catalogue
retailer
who
only
had
three
sets
not
the
joust
i
should
see
if
the
local
toy
store
has
it
now
though
as
they
did
stock
some
07
castle
in
addition
to
08
at
the
start
of
the
year
i
think
small
sets
like
this
should
be
well
stocked
in
shops
for
a
year
or
two
it
surely
doesnt
do
their
sales
much
good
to
be
so
sporadically
available
sorry
turned
into
a
bit
of
a
ramble
anyways
the
point
is
that
this
set
is
good
enough
id
pick
up
another
the
cobra
that
sucks
about
customs
i
try
to
keep
my
orders
to
within
the
$
23
dutyfree
limit
for
here
in
ireland
if
your
imports
are
waylaid
you
pay

the
quality
of
the
set
feel
free
to
comment
on
the
review
andor
set
also
thanks
the
set
is
average
its
useful
for
picking
up
a
few
knights
but
im
not
really
partial
to
the
skeleton
the
idea
of
a
knight
and
a
skeleton
tilting
just
strikes
me
as
being
odd
my
biggest
issue
with
the
current
castle
line
is
that
most
sets
force
you
to
purchase
a
mixture
of
skeletonsknights
orcsknights
orcsdwarves
etc
this
is
fine
for
those
of
you
who
love
your
fantasy
however
it
makes
the
line
a
bit
underwhelming
for
the
rest
of
us
still
as
mentioned
earlier
the
set
does
have
an
upside
so
it
is
worth
a
purchase
the
review
on
the
other
hand
is
aces
with
great
photos
and
a
detailed
description
of
the
set
and
its
contents
nice
work

you
know
what
i
think
this
set
has
charm
lots
of
it
im
not
a
big
fan
of
castle
having
very
few
sets
all
of
them
spanning
different
nationsarmies
but
i
couldnt
resist
this
set
and
while
not
obvious
at
first
it
really
is
backwards
compatible
with
every
castle
set
with
a
horse
in
it
nonetheless
i
think
this
set
is
great
its
simple
cheap
and
has
charm
thats
good
enough
for
me
plus
it
has
that
fantastic
grinning
knight
and
the
black
skeleton
horse
those
just
made
it
better

there
were
quite
a
few
sets
in
the
1980s
that
werent
sold
in
the
us
i
remember
reading
once
that
it
was
because
they
contained
wine
glasses
and
tlg
felt
they
wouldnt
be
able
to
market
a
toy
that
encourage
the
drinking
of
alcohol
this
set
was
one
of
them
i
remember
seeing
this
in
a
catalog
that
came
with
a
fabuland
set
and
wondering
what
it
was
and
where
i
could
get
one
i
wrote
to
lego
and
got
an
overseas
catalog
which
had
the
futuron
6990
monorail
transport
system
in
it
before
it
was
available
in
the
us
i
was
amazed
i
ended
up
buying
6349
holiday
villa
from
that
catalog
but
for
some
reason
gave
it
to
my
best
friend
for
his
birthday
ive
always
wanted
this
set
and
finally
bought
it
from
bricklink
this
year
my
purchase
included
everything
except
the
box
i
really
like
the
boxes
but
in
lieu
of
a
boxshot
here
is
the
instruction
manual
i
imagine
this
was
the
image
on
the
front
of
the
box
the
parts
one
of
the
things
that
appealed
to
me
about
this
set
is
its
abundance
of
rare
parts
this
base
plate
is
an
excellent
piece
and
was
only
available
in
two
sets
classic
lego
telephone
technically
these
blue
windows
1
x
4
x
5
windows
are
only
available
in
this
set
according
to
bricklink
it
was
available
in
different
form
with
and
without
fixed
glass
trans
blue
glass
in
other
sets
regardless
this
size
and
color
window
is
rare
and
the
blue
door
was
only
available
in
4
sets
this
was
a
huge
selling
point
for
me
as
im
a

monkey
never
heard
that
term
its
like
a
parts
monkey
a

who
buys
mulitples
of
sets
just
for
parts
or
large
lots
of
bulk
from
bl
and
sorts
them
into
bins
but
just
for
windows
tell
your
friends
i
coined
the
term
these
sloped
windows
have
endless
possibilities
in
many
themes
maybe
not
with
the
curtain
decals
applied
but
are
another
great
rare
part
that
appears
in
this
set
the
build
remember
this
piece
id
like
to
see
a
badass
agents
car
built
on
this
car
base
i
am
a
fan
of
the
sixwide
car
but
i
see
the
appeal
of
the
four
wide
it
has
a
very
nostalgic
feel
to
it
theres
no
denying
that
this
is
a
beauty
of
classic

this
set
comes
with
two
minifigures
one
of
which
appears

be

onto

the
basic

a
kitchen
thats

the
rest
of
the
house
and
a
little
oven
and
hood
vent
is
one
of
my
favorite
touches
its
one
thing
to
throw
an
oven
into
a
house
set
but
the
designer
of
this
set
made
it
a
cool
part
of
the
architecture
of
the
house
which
gives
it
a
unique
feel
the
completed
first
floor
and
carport
i
do
wish
the
sides
of
the
roof
were
white
with
a
little
overhang
like
an
actual
roof
this
method
of
white
on
bottom
red
on
top
looks
more
like
a
childs
drawing
than
a
real
house
this
is
easily
fixed
with
some
modifying
still
you
get
a
lot
of
roof

in
this

thanks
hinckley
for
this
lovely
review
positive
its
a
nice
house
but
perhaps
a
little
sparsh
on
detail
just
a
few
more
pieces
for
additional
furniture
would
have
been
nice
like
the
car
though
negative
this
is
a
really
good
set
what
makes
it
nice
is
that
it
is
so
simple
but
perfect

that

she

witty
eyes
of
her
i
am
very
sure
she
will
survived

course
of

this
is
a
very
simple
design
with
just
a
big
piece
of
wooden
plank
and
a
couple
of
logs
tied
together
on
the
side

it
is
ready
to
take
it
down

speaking
of
some
real

do
you
dare
to
take
this

in

there
is
a
small
holding

where
she
is
able
to
place

critical

ensure
her
safety
throughout

this
set
actually
provides
very
good
range
of
equipment
there
is
a
pair
of
oars
hammer
life
vest
and
backpack
the
most
wonderful
piece
of
equipment
is
the

of
dynamites

of
all
they
are
printed
next
they
can
be
used
in

or
any
playing
possibilites
which
involved
in

this
is
a
very
good
impulse
set
to
stock
up
these
accessories
i
wondered
what
she
need
to
use
these
dynamites
for
her
extreme
team
black
jacket
is
very
nicely
designed
with
their
logo
x
or
another
way
of
saying
xtreme
i
find
the
green
arms
and
black
jacket
matched
pretty
well
with
that
blue
cap

relaxing
herself
listening
to
the
calm
sea
to
summarise
this
is
one
of
the
better
impulse
sets
ever
produced
it
comes
with
a
simple
raft
with
tons
of
good
accessories
and
a
very
cheap
way
to
obtain
dynamites
in
fact
these
are
my
only
2
piece
in
my
entire
collection
somehow
this
set
managed
to
find
its
way
to
my
collection
in
my
dark

and
i
am
very
pleased
to
have

my
personal
favorite
of
the
resq
theme
released
in
1998
was
this
helicopter
6462
aerial
recovery
the
set
offered
a
pretty
modern
helicopter
raft
threewheeler
rescue
gurney
and
net
and
three
figs
including
a
diver
the
set
is
actionpacked
and
offers
a
high
degree
of
play
value
starting
with
the
box
front
side
and
back
front
back
i
always
liked
the
rough
oceansea
water
pictured
in
the
boxart
the
same
image
from
the
front
of
the
box
appears
on
the
cover
of
the
instructions
but
the
back
of
the
instructions
picture
a
plain
view
of
the
copter
one
sticker
sheet
with
a
few
resq
stickers
is
included
mainly
for
the
tail
section
of
the
helicopter
interestingly
the
set
includes
three
figures
one
being
a
diver
what
i
always
found
strange
is
the
inclusion
of
an
xtreme
team
diver
who
has
the
logo
on
his
torso
although
its
a
very
nice
fig
back
shot
i
think
this
was
my
first
set
with
a
lego
threewheeler
i
always
liked
it
a
lot
the
set
includes
a
yellow
raft
also
found
in
the
divers
sets
and
some
scuba
gear
note
the
raft
has
a
black
piece
in
its
center
for
lifting
up
by
the
helicopter
for
sea
and
emergent
rescue
a
gurney
can
also
be
lifted
by
the
helicopter
the
set
also
includes
a
net
with
hook
to
lift
the
threewheeler
and
other
items
an
extra
string
pulls
the
net
closed
heres
a
shot
of
the
helicopter
the
front
section
has
a
large
trans
blue
piece
enclosing
the
cockpit
inside
is
a
printed
radar
slope
a
smaller
trans
blue
piece
appears
a
bit
higher
for
access
to
the
middle
section
of
the
helicopter
andor
a
small
storage
area
in
the
middle
section
is
an
place
for
the
gurney
and
a
box
for
storing
some
of
the
adventure
gear
heres
a

showing
the
gurney
on
the
side
is
a
pulley
mechanism
that
swings
to
the

when
not

opposite

is
the

final
thoughts
personally
i
think
this
is
pretty
nice
set
i
like
the
thought
of
using
the
helicopter
to
rescue
people
at
sea
using
the
working
winch
extras
like
the
trikethreewheeler
and
the
rescue
net
make
the
set
even
more
fun

this
and
the

are

sets
i
have
i
would
encourage
you
to
share
a

you
have
done
some
very

then
i

ill
do

later
today
or
tomorrow
stay
tuned
neutral
i
got
this
set
as
well
as
a
resq
hovercraft
this
set
is
cool
because
of
all
the
accessories
and
it
come
with
a
x
team
guy
your
set
is
also
in
much
better
condition
than
mine
you
have
made
me
decide
to
rebuild
it

great
review
thebrickster
keep
up
the
good
work
positive
looks
like
a
nice
helicoptor
i
love
the
2
cockpits
i
love
the
divers
head
i
really
need
one
of
those
positive
this
helicopter
is
so
cool
and
i
agreed
with
you
that
this
is
a
high
playablity
set
its
not
common
to
see
such
a
big
scale
helicopter
which
has
two
cockpits
back
then
the
color
scheme
works
well
for
me
with
so
much
features
such
as
the
lowering
of
the
grappling
hook
storage
box
storing
of
the
gurney
and
etc
one
thing
which
can
be
improved
onto
the
helicopter
is
the
rotors
it
could
be
extended
a
little
longer
as
the
size
of
the
helicopter
is
too
big
it
makes
the
rotors
rather
weak
as
it
is
not
able
to
support
the
weight
i
am
confused
why
there
is
an
extreme
team
personnel
there
i
thought
he
was
supposed
to
be
recovered
from
the
resq
team
although
there
is
so
many
questions
in
my
head
such
as
why
include
the
black
tricycle
bike
extreme
team
and
etc
but
this
is
still
one
very
good
set
to
play
with
too
bad
i
had
never
seen
this
before
somehow
through
your
review
i
like
it
very
much
the
only
big
scale
helicopter
which
i
owned
is
the
7738
coast
guard
helicopter
and
lift
raft
neverthless
i
gave
this
a
4
thanks
brickster
positive
the
helicopter
looks
nice
and
the
resq
minifigs
were
nice
the
diver
minifig
had
once
been
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
positive
a
neat
set
with
lots
of
accessories
but
i
never
liked
any
of
the
lego
helicopters
with
long
streamlined
canopies
as
they
are
obviously
more
influenced
by
military
helicopters
and
space
ships
than
by
real
civilian
transport
helicopters
id
give
it
a
3
at
best
very
good
and
thourough
pictorial
review
though
positive
i
stopped
collecting
lego
sets
in
the
early
90s
because
of
this
kind
of
sets
ive
always
been
a
classic
town
fan
and
i
really
didnt
liked
the
futuristic
design
of
tlcs
newer
sets
negative
i
think
the
set
is
too
unrealistic
i
like
the
new
resq
sets
better
and
im
somewhat
a
lifeboat
freak
so
im
always
following
such
a
sets
with
interest
i
would
like
to
see
some
rigit
inflatable
boats
some
day
but
about
the
chopper
i
like
the
accessoiries
negative
what
exactly
makes
you
feel
this
set
isnt
realistic
it
has
got
nothing
what
wouldnt
be
on
a
real
helicopter
imo
and
for
the
futuristic
design
yes
it
looks
modern
but
it
works
and
actually
most
of
todays
real
helicopters
also
dont
look
like
in
the
70s
anymore

very
nicely
done
this
cart
is
a
striking
resemblance
to
the
crossbow
cart
we
got
in
2007
positive
quote
even
though
many
people
do
n't
like
frightknights
i
dont
really
like
fright
knights
either
i
just
happened
to
have
this
set
neutral
looks
great
and
the
figures
up
there
are
old
and
kinda
rare
i
dont
really
like
fright
knights
though
so
i
probably
wont
get
this
set
neutral
thanks
for
the
review
ive
added
it
to
the
index
im
not
a
fan
of
this
theme
but
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
a
neat
little
set
that
does
hold
some
good
things
figs
and
weapons
are
always
welcome
and
one
can
never
have
to
many
wheels
so
i
rate
this
average
neutral
this
is
a
pretty
nice
set
i
really
like
the
torso
and
its
genericness
so
it
can
be
used
for
other
factions
and
at
least
this
set
has
2
shields
althought
i
prefer
the
triangular
ones
instead
of
just
1
shield
you
get
from
crossbow
attack
from
the
wrong
fraction
id
have
liked
a
crown
knights
shield
100x
better
some
improvements
for
this
set
would
be
a
normal
bow
and
a
sword
instead
of
2
of
the
3
crossbows
smaller
wheels
and
triangular
shields
45
from
me
actually
35
but
ill
round
it
up
positive
i
gave
it
above
average
it
was
a
nice
set
and
included
some
nice
pieces
but
it
is
only
an
impulse
set
after
all

heres
my
favorite
of
the
outback
collection
first
let
me
say
that
this
little
set
is
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
because
it
can
be
used
to
sumplement
a
number
of
different
themes
1
the
set
makes
a
great
little
adventure
airstrip
for
adventurers
and
more
recent
the
indiana
jones
theme
see
also
german
headquarters
and
port
adventure
ive
also
used
the
set
as
an
addition
to
my
wild
west
town
the
tan
baseplate
and
windmill
works
great
just
subtract
the
plane
modern
equipment
and
figs
and
lastly
as
the
set
was
intended
as
an
outbackdesert

starting
with
the
box
and
the
backside
notice
the
alternate
models
i
love
the
swamp
boat
the
building
is
my
favorite
part
of
the
set
it
is
simple
has
a
little
detail
two
great
roof
pieces
and
a
single
green
window
great
piece
check
out
the
great
windmill
piece
its
my
only
one
and
makes
a
great
part
for
wild
west
and
that
farm
you
always
wanted
to
build
i
used
it
for
the
barnhouse
of
barnabas
higgens
and
spring
valley
ranch
on
the
side
of
the
building
is
a
great
radio
and
a
clear
glass
unfortunately
no
furniture
can
be
found
within
the
building
and
now
the
airplane
front
view
i
love
the
twin
propellors
side
view
and
the
rear
section
the
back
has
a
small
cargo
hold
for
some
boxesfreight
or
some
gear
needed
in
the
outback
the
set
includes
three
figs
two
with
cool
shades
and
some
great
equipment
i
love
the
boom
box
a
shot
of
the
whole
set
and
another
summary
as
i
mentioned
above
this
set
is
very
versatile
and
can
suplement
a
few
different
themes
its
my
personal
favorite
of
the
outback
collection
and
im
really
glad
i
was
able
to
find
the
set
in
the
late
90s
i
almost
didnt
buy
sets
like
this
are
timeless
and
so
much
fun
to
build
and
display

you

this
is
really
an
ideal
small
set
in
spite
of
its
size
it
has
nearly
everything
•
three
minifigs
•
a
vehicle
•
a
building
•
numerous
minifig
accessories
•
numerous
rare
and
useful
parts
•
nice
model
design
especially
for
the
time
period
too
bad
outback
came
out
during
my
dark
years
positive
this
is
probably
my
alltime
favorite
lego
set
it
was
originally
given
to
me
for
my
birthday
by
a
close
friend
of
mine
back
in
the
release
year
of
1997
the
cargo
plane
was
by
far
my
favorite
vehicle
ever
unfortunately
someone
stole
the
plane
from
me
when
our
families
went
on
vacation
and
the
rest
of
the
set
was
given
to
my
cousins
oldest
son
when
i
was
no
longer
interested
in
my
lego
collection
now
that
im
back
into
lego
i
use
that
buildings
construction
for
various
projects
especially
as
a
dr
inferno
lookout
shack
using
parts
from
extra
mission

the
shack
compliments
the
original

am
positive
this
was
a
cool
set
i
thoght
of
it
as
i
was
building
the
post
plane
positive
one
of
the
best
in
my
humble
opinion
as
far
as
i
know
it
was
never
released
in
the
uk
so
the
only
reason
i
managed
to
get
my
hands
on
it
was
on
a
family
holiday
to
the
us
i
think
they
'd
only
recently
opened
the
lego
store
in
disney
arguable
the
best
feature
is
that
it
seems
to
fit
into
a
wide
selection
of
themes
is
it
a
airstrip
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
is
it
next
to
a
only
mining
town
that
's
not
deserted
the
possibilities
are
rather
open
and
that
's
truly
great

i
have

i
suppose
its
the
yellow
the
plane
in
this
set
is
much
different
than
most
of
the
other
classic
town
airplanes
in
that
it
has
the
double
tail
section
heres
a

the

definately
a

positive
whats
wrong
with
another
yoda
and
some
nice
light
blue

i

would

this

sets

i
feel
this
set
isnt
that
great
1
yoda
he
is
by
far
the
best
part
of
the
set
although
is
his
weapon
blue
2lord
tyrannus
pretty
nice
i
feel
the
middle
part
of
his
torso
is
a
bit
bland
but
that
isnt
a
problem
i
wish
they
would
make
a
fleshie
one
too
3
speeder
bike
i
always
hated
this
design
the
back
looks
terrible
to
me
way
too
bulky
in
my
opinion
it
jusnt
give
me
the
image
that
its
the
same
as
the
movie
the
lightsaber
is
amazing
why
is
it
only
in
this
set
4yodalifter
what
that
is
terrible
but
at
least
it
has
some
nicely
colored
parts
a
fine
set
but
not
the
best
imo
negative
thanks
for
the
nice
review
kimt
i
like
this
set
especially
by
the
fact
that
it
is
the
only
set
containing
the
dooku
minifig
and
the
curved
lightsaber
i
also
think
that
the
minifig
is
cool
but
i
also
own
the
dagobah
xwing
and
the
wookiee
catamaran
sets
so
i
have
enought
minifigs
a
clone
wars
version
would
be
very
cool
and
the
extrathingy
is
well
just
ok
the
bad
part
is
that
i
dont
buy
the
set
when
it
is
out
and
now
is
go
for
40
on
ebay
and

i
think
this
is
a
pretty
lame
set
it
came
with
dooku
who
i
think
only
came
in
this
set
plus
a
unique
lightsaber
still
they
could
have
made
it
much
bigger
added
anikan
and
obiwan
and
added
structures
and
made
it
more
like
the
scene
from
the
movie
also
the
speeder
doesnt
seem
very
accurate
negative
i
missed
out
on
this
set
but
it
looks
pretty
good
imo
thanks
for
clearing
up
what
that
thing
was
i
thought
it
was
something
they
flung
at
eachother
in
the
movie
i
like
the
lightsaber
also
but
why
did
they
stop
making
chrome
ones
neutral
i
wonder
how
expensive
this
set
would
be
on
ebay
shop
victoriously
neutral
i
was
very
lucky
to
get
this
set
and
i
love
it
i
dont
have
it
built
cause
i
bought
it
for
parts
but
it
was
fun
while
it
lasted
positive
great
review
kimt
at
that
time
it
was
still
in
my
dark
age
and
i
hated
myself
not
to
get
this
set
earlier
this
is
quite
inexpensive
and
you
are
able
to
get
two
greatest
characters
especially
count
dooku
the
minifigs
are
excellent
especially
the
unique
design
of
count
dookus
lightsaber
i
have
no
problem
with
the
speedbike
as
it
looks
quite
alright
to
me
as
for
the
elevation
of
yodas
jump
adds
some
playabilty
but
that
does
not
work
well
for
me
nevertheless
the
main
attractive
factor
is
count
dooku
and
i
have
to
rate
it
a
5
i
never
own
a
yoda
except
for
the
magnet
version
positive
cheers
for
the
review
kimt
of
the
initial
episode
ii
lego
releases
this
set
was
the
least
inspiring
but
the
minifigs
were
musthaves
you
cant
go
wrong
with
count
dooku
and
yoda
i
like
the
design
of
dookus
speeder
in
the
movie
but
lego
missed
the
mark
a
bit
with
it
here
and
gave
him
a
dodgy
flying
boat
instead
the
speeder
cradleyoda
jumping
mechanism
was
just
a
waste
of
parts
unfortunately
id
like
to
see
dookus
speeder
reimagined
by
lego
theyve
come
a
long
way
in
the
way
they
design
a

the

thebrickster
asked
me
a
few
weeks
ago
to
do
this
since
he
unfortunately
never
owned
this
great
set
so
here
we
go
first
i
have
to
say
that
i
really
love
this
late
90s
town
theme
and
i
wish
there
would
have
been
produced
more
sets
this
is
the
only
one
i
own
well
beside
that
i
also
still
have
6572
wind
runners
but
the
car
is
missing
anyway
lets
face
the
facts
and
let
the
pictures
speak

themselves

lets
start
off
with
a
few
quick
shots
of
the
box
instructions
inside
of
the
box
we
got
some
ideas
for
alternative
models
on
the
backside
the
same
ones
are
also
on
the
backside
of
the
instructions
instructions
heres
an
overall
view
of
this
huge
set
we
get
4
minifigs
each
with
different
heads
and
color
patterns
which
i
really
like
and
also
a
good
amount
of
equipment
for
them
lets
move
on
with
the
cool
vehicles
there
are
3
completely
different
ones
in
this
set
first
is
the
neat
little
trike
next
the
not
less
neat
4wheeled
offroadthing
dont
know
whats
it
called
really
and
finally
the
huge
monster
truck
i
love
the
chrome
sidepipes
and
the
wench
with
the
hook
in
the
back
which
adds
a
lot
of
playability
oh
i
almost
forgot
our
brave
adventurers
also
have
got
a
raft
to
ride
the
wild
mountain
waters
now
lets
focus
on
the
many
details
of
the
mountain
base
we
got
a
bridge
over
troubled
waters
but
be
aware
its
very
unstable
love
the
wood
patterns
on
the
yellow
1x6
tiles
on
a
corner
a
camera
is
mounted
to
document
the
wild
life
for
the
evenings
we
also
got
a
little
campfire
down
by
the
river
sits
a
grey
falcon
and
watches
the
guys
on
their
challenges
whats
that
seems
not
very
safe
to
be
honestbe
aware
when
you
pass
by
these
rocks
cause
it
will
collapse
lets
move
up
again
where
the
tent
is
placed
inside
is
plenty
of
space
to
take
a
rest
for
the
figs
and
to
store
their
equipment
but
i
think
they
should
have
built
the
tent
on
another
place
cause
the
ground
isnt
very
good
there
when
you
pull
the
mechanism
a
trap
door
opens
will
the

is
a
really
great

may
say
it
is
a
bit
juniorized
because
of
the
baseplate
but
it
really
isnt
its
got
a
lot
of
playability
and
some
rare
parts
the
biggest
beeing
the
baseplate

a
cool

with
a

and
some
nifty

very
playable
and
well
designed
indeed
perhaps
a
bit
too
colorful
for
my
likings
but
pretty
impressive

i
will
be
doing
up
a
review
on
pizza

go
set
this
outlet
is
one
of
the
most
favourite
eatery
for
any
lego
citizens
living
in
their
town
when
they
are
driving
on
the
road
they
are
sure
to
look
out
pizzeria
signage
they
offer
the
best
pizza
in
town
no
one
in
town
can
resist
the
delicious
aroma
of
pizza
coming
out
from
the
red
chimney
let
us
find
out
why
is
this
shop
so
popular
among
so
many
lego
citizens
and
was
one
of
the
famous
sets
that
is
rereleased
under
the
legend
theme
pizza
to
go
is
my
favourite
set
of
all
time
i
believed
there
is
no
other
pizza
outlet
lying
around
in
any
lego
city
apart
pizzeria
it
seemed
there
are
the
sole
outlet
that
is
selling
pizza
for
many
years
this
set
was
rereleased
in
2002
and
it
is
part
of
the
legend
theme
this
is
one
of
the
few
sets
that
are
highly
demanded
to
be
brought
back
by
many
fans
of
lego
around
the
world
i
owned
the

any
members
whom
had
owned
both
sets
before
is
there
any
difference
between
these
two
because
when
i
searched
through

it
shown
144

pizza
to
go
is
the
regular
pizza
outlet
that
sells
nothing
but
pizza
they
deliever
pizza
to
every
household
in
town
with
their
trusty
delivery
van
walkin
are
welcomed
too
there
is
a
stand
for
customers
to
dine
in
their
pizza
quickly
before
making
their
way
to
their
next
destination
in
my
opnon
no
town
can
ever
survive
without
the
pizza
tradition
devoted
pizzeria
staff
every
outlet
comes
with
3
dedicated
staff
making
sure
that
operations
will
run
smoothly
on
the
left
we
will
have
the
pizza
boy
whom
is
wearing
the
regular
blue
dungarees
and
its
white
cap
i
wonder
who
is
that
boy
on
the
middle
we
will
have
the
pizza
girl
she
looks
like
any
typical
sweet
girl
in
town
that
the
boys
will
look
at
she
is
wearing
a
suntop
strapless
on
her
she
reminded
me
of
one
person
though
i
think
her
name
is
called
alice
taking
a
careful
look
i
wonder
if
imperialshadows
is
the
pizza
boy
back
then
without
that
black
patch
on
its
left
eye
on
another
note
this
minifigure
was
my
favourite
female
minifigures
are
very
uncommon
back
then
i
am
glad
i
have
this
figure
adding
to
my
town
population
on
the
right
we
will
have
the
hardworking
chef
preparing
the
pizzas
in
the
oven
he
wears
the
regular
white
chef
outfit
but
he
wear
a
grey
pants
instead
of
the
usual
fullwhite
outfit
in
most
resturants
such
as
breezeway
cafe
6376
lets
take
a
closer
look
at
the
pizza
boys
van
this
van
is
very
very
small
looking
and
very
fuel
efficient
it
is
able
to
cut
lanes
very
fast
due
to
its
small
size
the
pizza
van
is
made
up
of
4studs
wide
design
no
doors
by
the
side
however
in
this
vehicle
i
think
the
doors
is
not
a
must
to
be
included
in
this
design
our
pizza
boy
will
need
to
leave
vehicle
pretty
fast
and
ensuring
that
the
pizza
delivery
is
on
time
common
mechanism
this
van
has
the
regular
rooftop
that
can
be
lifted
up
to
place
the
pizza
boy
into
the
driver
seat
there
is
a
sun
roof
on
its
top
which
enable
him
to
let
him
have
some
sunlight
from
above
the
logo
on
the
side
of
it
is
actually
a
transparent
sticker
which
have
the
pizzeria
itallian
logo
and
a
tasty
looking
pizza
on
both
sides
of
its
van
i
like
that
sticker
very
much
mine
looks
quite
worn
out
over
time
if
its
a
printed
piece
it
will
be
a
terrific
bonus
nevertheless
i
can
still
accept
the
sticker
our
pizza
van
can
deliever
up
to
2
pizza
at
a
go
at
every
trip
2
piping
hot
pizza
will
be
stored
at
the
back
of
the
van
the
pizza
is
fitted
in
perfectly
in
each
compartment
furthermore
the
white
window
shutter
is
terrific
in
this
design
you
dont
see
this
kind
of
design
anymore
i
think
i
have
not
seen
much
delivery
vans
on
the
street
anymore
too
base
of
the
van
from
the
base
you
can
see
that
it
is
using
of
the
regular
red
car
base
that
is
common
in
most
4studs
vehicle
design
in
fact
this
car
base
served
as
a
foundation
for
its
vehicle
design
back
of
pizzeria
alice
and
the
chef
will
be
showing
you
around
at
the
back
of
the
kitchen
there
is
an
oven
on
the
left
a
water
tap
and
a
holder
for
the
oar
stick
looks
pretty
empty
right
look
below
for
a
surprise
my
favourite
feature
this
oven
can
be
used
to
heat
up
2
pizzas
at
a
go
now
i
understand
why
this
set
is
named
pizza
to
go
i
have
been
using
their
slogan
unknowingly
this
feature
is
superb
nice
now
we
know
that
the
pizza
is
prepared
from
the
outlet
instead
of
using
delivery
van
to
collect
it
from
a
factory
alice
what
are
you
waiting
for
help
the
chef
quickly
pizzeria
the
signage
sure
looks
big
from
far
and
catches
their
attention
easily
too
with
its
pleasnt
looking
design
as
you
have
already
noticed
this
is
made
up
of
sticker
i
dont
mind
for
this
set
it
contains
sticker
sometimes
i
do
hope
they
can
give
us
spare
sticker
for
us
to
change
after
a
long
period
of
time
distinct
red
chimney
this
is
the
front
of
the
oven
and
that
is
where
the
smoke
comes
out
using
only
bricks
to
construct
this
is
simply
wonderful
i
like
the
use
of
their
white
bricks
to
construct
the
wall
layout
and
a
combination
of
red
parts
especially
on
the
top
i
like
the
look
of
this
very
much
another
picture
on
its
side
printed
parts
in
this
set
you
will
get
a
total
of
5
pizzas
and
i
believed
no
other
sets
offer
so
many
pizza
you
can
placed
up
to
4
pizzas
in
the
van
and
oven
alice
will
be
carrying
the
last
pizza
around
the
green
and
red
round
dish
is
a
printed
part
most
exclusive
part
in
635010036
the
most
unique
and
important
printed
parts
that
is
only
exclusive
in
this
set
its
at
the
front
of
the
pizza
van
it
is
none
other
but
the
pizzeria
logo
standing
at
the
front
of

i
do
like
the
set
although
i
dont
own
it
i
do
remember
lusting
after
it
when
i
was
a
kid
though
mainly
because
of
the
female
minifig
and
the
colors
its
a
bit
simplistic
but
comes
with
a
few
great
parts
you
also
did
a
great
job
on
describing
the
set
and
the
pictures
give
the
full
impression
of
the
appearance
for
the
review
i
just
have
to
point
out
a
few
things
to
give
you
constructive
criticism
first
of
all
its
chef
not
chief
entirely
different
professions
and
secondly
the
scale
you
give
in
the
poll
isnt
very
even
above
average
jumps
to
outstanding
which
is
a
too
big
of
a
gap
in
my
opinion
you
shouldve
used
good
or
great
in
between
them
but
these
are
only
minor
faults
this
is
a
good
review

i
appericate
your

in
order
to
improve
the
quality
of

i
had
amended
the
word
chief
to
chef
you
might
want
to
check
it
i
did
not
notice
that
i
was
using
the
wrong
word
as
for
the
poll
definitions
which
have
been
used
for
1
to
5
we
used
poor
to
represent
value
1
while
outstanding
to
represent
value
5
we
need
to
use
clear
definitions
to
illustrate
and
demostrate
nonbias
towards
the
review
for
the
readers
to
cast
their
vote
depending
on
their
individual
liking
therefore
we
used
a
common
word
which
is
known
as
average
in
surveys
for
measuring
its
sample
sizes
liking
we
have
to
use
words
which
is
neutral
such
as
strongly
agree

thats

we

would

dont
always
trust
peeron
sometimes
they
miss
some
pieces
and
sometimes
they
just
cant

them
i
am
hoping
to
see
a

again
maybe
in

can
sometimes
be

neutral
got
this
one
as
well
not
much
surprises
in
such
a
small
set
but
the
fastfood
pizza
idea
is
pretty
cool
as
far
as
i
know
only
the
small
mcdonalds
promo
and
this
set
are
related
to
foodrestaurant
thing
until
the
cafe
corner
that
is
but
since
i
have
a
classic
lego
city
i
cant
miss
this
set
neutral
this
set
looks
really
cool
especially
for
one
this
inexpensive
the
van
is
neat
and
the
hidden
storage
compartment
i
back
is
the
icing
on
the
cake
i
like
the
back
with
hidden
oven
as
well
and
the
rare
sink
piece
makes
it
all
the
better
with
five
pizzas
and
three
minifigs
its
and
excellent
set
to
behold
positive
excellent

white

and
a

set
to

almost
ordered
this
set
back
when
it
was
rereleased
by
lego
but
passed
on
it
im
so
mad
at
myself
this
has
all
the
terrific
qualities
that
classic

exemplify
i
love
the

with
another

p
thank
you
for
the

might
put
me
on

in
finding

so
long

positive
excellent

one

devoted
pizzeria
staff
on
the
left
we
will
have
the
pizza
boy
whom
is
wearing
the
regular
blue
dungarees
and
its
white
cap
i
wonder
who
is
that
boy
on
the
middle
we
will
have
the
pizza
girl
she
looks
like
any
typical
sweet
girl
in
town
that
the
boys
will
look
at
she
is
wearing
a
suntop
strapless
on
her
she
reminded
me
of
one
person
though
i
think
her
name
is
called
alice
taking
a
careful
look
i
wonder
if
imperialshadows
is
the
pizza
boy
back
then
without
that
black
patch
on
its
left
eye
on
another
note
this
minifigure
was
my
favourite
female
minifigures
are
very
uncommon
back
then
i
am
glad
i
have
this
figure
adding
to
my
town
population
hmmm
he
does
look
a
little
familiar
and
i
definitely
recognise
the
lovely
alice
now
stop
staring
at
her
sandy

its

entirely
different

actually
salvatore

i

to
call
the

was
in
the
navy
where
he
reached
the

of

a

he
holds
to

really
like

got

this

way
the
back
holds
the

i
remember
having
this
set
when
it
was
originally
released
a
good
few
years
back
but
i
dont
think
i
have
it
anymore
i
remember
i
thought
it
was
really
awesome
though
i
thought
the
oven
and
pizza
storage
in
the
back
of
the
car
were
the
greatest
parts
the
little
sink
on
the
inside
was
cool
too
didnt
realise
they
had
made
a
legends
set
out
of
it
id
love
to
own
this
set
again
but
misb
examples
on
bricklink
go
for
an
extortionate
amount
of
money
ah
well
se
la
vie
positive
thanks
for
all
of
your
kind
words

great
support
for
this
once
famous
legend
set
which
got
a
second
chance
to
be
rereleased
again
for
people
whom
had
missed
it

the

i
used
to
want
this
set
so
badly
and
i
almost
got
it
when
it
was
rereleased
i
still
wonder
why
i
didnt
because
with
a
building
van
5
pizzas
and
a
then
very
rare
female
fig
this
set
would
have
been
perfect
for
someone
with
a
smaller
collection
like
i
had
then
what
surprised
me
the
most
is
how
well
this
set
still
holds
up
to
others
today
off
to
bricklink
i
agreed
that
this
set
is
perfect
for
someone
with
a
small
collection
in
fact
i
feel
that
this
set
is
one
of
the
must
have
set
that
can
allow
you
build
your

franchise
in
your

it

again
yellowed

is
really
very
saddening
it
reminds
me
of
my

those
were
the
days
where
we
are

i
also
always
think
the
girl
minifig
is
supposed
to
be
a
customer
lego
is
really
up
to
everyones
own
imagination
you
are
right
the
girl
could
have
been
a
customer
i
thought
of
her
as
a
staff
misrepresentation
could
be
so
easy
but
then
again
the
box
nevr
stated
its
role
too
neutral
i
own
this
set
and
its
one
of
my
favourites
simply
because
of
the
cool
colour
scheme
which
you
mention
plus
all
the
vehicles
and
accessories
the
resq
theme
is
one
of
my
faves
of
all
time
actually
i
own
nearly
all
of
them
missing
a
small
set
that
was
only
available
in
the
us
or
japan
i
think
dr
s
positive
there
are
very
few
late
90s
or
early
00s
sets
worth
ever
having
and
i
wish
i
had
this
one
with
its
futuristic
look
and
yes
that
tow
truck
too
oh
yeah
heaps
of
equipment
its
not
over
junorised
there
is
still
plenty
of
building
in
it

hi
everyone
this
is
my
first
review
on
lego
sets
here
hope
you
guys
like
it
and
i
would
like
to
apologise
for
the
bad
quality
pictures
hope
you
guys
dont
mind
first
i
will
start
with
the
box
art
box
art
i
guess
this
is
the
first
time
that
lego
star
wars
sets
use
white
and
blue
colour
for
their
box
i
like
the
new
colour
scheme
a
nice
blend
though
heres
the
front
the
back
not
to
waste
space
on
the
box
lego
do
some
advertisement
to
attract
us
to
buy
more
sets
grinthe
more
the
side
at
the
top
side
there
is
this
minifigs
scale
picture
it
is
great
as
we
get
to
know
the
real
size
of
a
minifigs
contents
the
contents
consist
of
a
sticker
sheet
instruction
book
and
8
packet
of
bricks
the
packer
are
not
numbered
but
it
is
ok
as
there
is
not
much
pieces
instruction
book
and
random
page
as
usual
the
instruction
book
have
brick
checklist
other
sets
pictures
and
tutorial
on
how
you
should
assemble
your
set
i
mean
the
very
first
page
sticker
sheet
there
is
not
much
sticker
sheet
and
is
a
great
news
that
the
republic
logo
on
the
round
plate
is
printed
unlike
republic
gunship
anyway
i
didnt
apply
the
stickers
the
commander
gear
this
is
a
new
thing
to
minifigs
as
well
well
is
like
batman
accessories
they
pack
it
in
one
small
packet
however
you
only
get
one
commander
gear
pack
in
this
set
anyway
i
didnt
use
them
the
minifigs
well
we
get
the
the
new
minifigs
the
ugly
face
clone
new
printed
torso
and
new
mold
of
helmet
however
i
not
really
like
the
new
head
stud
i
prefer
a
black
one
or
at
least
the
one
like
jango
fett
black
colour
with
face
the
helmet
everything
is
printed
no
holes
at
the
visor
there
but
there
are
hole
on
the
both
side
this
new
helmet
mold
also
made
the
headgear
turn
360
degree
freely
without
helmet
with
helmet
you
can
see
the
flesh
tone
at
the
hole
beside
the
blasters
short
blasters
were
given
instead
of
long
one
is
great
at
least
they
give
us
two
blasters
instead
of
one
the
tank
here
is
the
pics
of
the
tank
it
was
not
badly
design
nor
nicely
design
but
it
looks
great
if
you
didnt
saw
the
beneath
or
under
the
tank
view
from
front
view
from
side
view
from
back
whats
beneath
under
it
was
4
wheels
to
make
it
move
fluently
it
is
made
by
the
thread
supporter
like
the
one
we
fet
from
tie
crawler
or
battank
the
functions
well
firstly
you
can
open
up
the
hood
i
guess
to
see
the
engine
secondly
the
side
cannon
that
can
move
upwards
the
thing
is
quite
tight
see
random
instruction
page
and
there
is
barrier
to
block
the
cannon
from
going
downwards
the
cockpit
well
the
cockpit
is
small
and
the
space
is
limited
the
monitor
stuff
is
printed
brick
and
is
another
great
news
you
have
to
remove
the
piece
pic
below
to
reveal
the
cockpit
and
put
your
clone
to
pilot
it
popup
gunner
mechanism
well
the
backdoor
have
a
thing
to
attack
to
the
seat
of
the
gunner
the
top
hatch
is
very
loose
so
it
there
is
a
clone
as
a
gunner
and
you
open
the
back
door
the
clone
will
popup
and
automatically
open
the
hatch
on
top
this
is
how
the
top
looks
like
without
a
clone
there
is
this
movable
cannon
upwards
left
and
right
and
a
little
keyboard
thing
with
it
but
the
cannon
fall
off
quite
easily
the
flick
launching
missile
mechanism
the
mechanism
is
on
both
side
and
you
need
to
turn
the
thing
inwards
to
reveal
the
flick
fire
mechanism
below
are
the
pic
of
how
it
is
turned
you
can
keep
you
blaster
at
the
front
of
the
side
there
are
place
for
you
to
store
them
it
close
nicely
completion
this
is
how
it
looks
like
extra
parts
there
quite
a
number
of
them
overall
this
set
is
not
bad
the
price
is
quite
expensive
but
you
will
like
it
the
popup
mechanism
is
something
new
to
me
but
this
set
have
more
function
and
2
clone
trooper
with
a
pack
of
commander
gear
pros
2x
clone
troopers
high
playability
nice
design
cons
a
little
expensive
sticker
sheet
cannon
on
top
falls
off
quite
easy

thanks
again
for
the

positive
baby
i
will
like
to
take
a
moment
to
said
outstanding
piece
of
review
for
your
first
attempt
you
have
done
well
with
the
pictures
and
its
flow
i
have
to
admit
that
i
love
this
fighter
tank
very
much
the
downside
of
it
which
is
overpriced
and
two
clone
troopers
do
not
really
justify
the
purchase
well
if
i
have
the
spare
cash
i
will
defintely
get
one
of
this
keep
it
up
positive
wow
this
ship
is
really
big
judging
from
the
size
of
its
hull
wondering
where
can
i
keep
it
when
ive
bought
it

the
strange
thing
is
for
the
first
time
i
can
remember
the
minifigs
came
decapitated
and
theres
no
neckwear
i
recall
jake
saying
something
about
it
being
new
lego
policy
to
supply
the
minifig
heads
and
torsos
separately
what
with
the
expensestrimming
and
all
its
apparently
one
of
the
many
little
quirky
things
theyve
discovered
in
the
manufacturing
and
packaging
process
that
people
have
done
for
years
without
thinking
in
this
case
putting
the
heads
on
the
torsos
but
that
turns
out
to
be
a
surprisingly
significant
expense
timewise
i
suppose
think
it
was
in
one
of
his
blog
posts
but
not
sure
too
tired
ie
lazy
to
go
hunting
for
it
now
sorry
neutral
but
does
this
mean
that
they
add
to
the
piece
count
is
it
a
super
secret
clever
way
to
make
the
piece
count
seem
bigger
than
it
is
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
addition
ive
built
it
review
up
later
tonite
but
heres
this
to
wet
your
appetite
negative
mattzitron
you
have
done
well
to
display
images
of
the
dung
stain
hull
its
a
darn
shame
that
it
cant
be
extended
however
i
see
no
reason
why
lego
couldnt
produce
a
special
middle
hull
piece
that
is
compatible
although
the
way
theyve
made
the
hull
is
a
bit
stupid
the
old
system
was
a
lot
more
flexible
better
still
why
cant
lego
design
a
hull
that
can
be
extended
in
length
and
width
then
they
could
be
as
made
as
long
or
wide
as
desired
and
that
would
be
great

they
have
made

nice
review
vbbn
i
stumbled
upon
your
yellow
seat
as
well
didn
´
t
you
have
one
already
or
what
made
you
think
it
´
s
new
the
big
letdown
on
this
set
is
the
big
canopy
i
would
have
preferred
single
bricks
for
that
and
for
this
truck
there
is
no
real
need
for
a
hollow
canopy
it
could
as
well
have
been
made
of
solid
bricks
maybe
we
get
another
set
with
different
use
of
the
canopy
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
i
didn
´
t
buy
it
so
far
and
i
´
m
especially
not
interested
in
another
forklift
i
have
plenty
of
those
i
agree
it
´
s
the
best
one
we
have
seen
so
far
though
thanks
i
have
a
yellow
seat
but
i
just
thought
it
was
interesting
as
for
the
canopy
it
really
looks
good
on
the
finished
truck
i
like
it
and
that
forklift
could
be
the
official
one
and
the
rest
could
become
parts
positive
that
´
s
really
a
sweet
and
charming
little
technic
set
thanks
for
that
fine
review

nice

the
figure
fitting
inside
is

i
think
the
price
might
be
a
little
high

you
did
get
it
from

what
else
is

be

loved

lets
us
begin
with
the
box
the
front
shows
it
in
all
it
's
swooshing
glory
httptdyorgukimages765802jpg
the
back
shows
some
of
the
many
features
of
the
set
and
also
others
you
might
like
to
buy
in
the
star
wars
range
after
opening
the
box
we
find
a
single
instruction
booklet
now
we
come
to
an
important
aspect
of
any
star
wars
set
the
figure
here
we
're
provided
with
an
anomalous
rebel
pilot
and
his
faithful
r5
droid
the
pilot
comes
with
the
fairly
standard
lego
star
wars
nonhero
helmet
printing
what
's
he
going
to
do
with
the
blaster
taken
on
the
entire
empire
one
of
the
more
interesting
parts
is
the
assembly
of
the
engine
which
if
like
me
you
do
n't
pay
enough
attention
to
the
instructions
when
building
you
can
end
up
getting
wrong
the
key
detail
i
got
wrong
just
before
fitting
the
last
engine
if
we
look
carefully
on
the
side
we
can
see
a
missile
launcher
i
did
n't
think
torpedoes
or
concussion
missiles
were
fired
from
there
but
i
may
be
wrong
after
fitting
the
engine
the
models
looks
like
this
in
all
it
's
glory
manning
one
of
the
alliance
's
fighters
not
so
ready
to
take
on
the
empire
was
he
so
overall
we
have
a
well
designed
model
which
is
in
my
opinion
far
superior
to
the
original
we
were
offered
with
darth
vader
way
back
when
lego
star
wars
was
new
this
ywing
is
sleek
and
looks
great
in
my
opinion
the
firing
missiles
are
also
a
great
touch

the

you

no

want
to
know
is
the
set
worth
the
price
i
'll
be
frank
#

is
too
much
for
this
set
despite
this
i
currently
have
a
squadron
of
three
ywings
the
reasons
is
this
set
has
been
on
sale
a
number
of
times
at

it
's
certainly
worth
the
money
lego
recently
placed
them
online
with
a
price
of

this
i
think
was
a
great
price
for
the
set
and
well

one
or
more
up

you
wanted

start

lets
us
begin
with
the
box
the
front
shows
us
are
knight
and
his
rack
of
arms
the
back
shows
us
two
sets
from
the
castle
range
moving
inside
the
box
now
the
contents
of
the
box
it
does
n't
look
like
much
the
instructions
to
help
you
through
the
build
now
the
reason
you
probably
bought
the
set
well
at
least
why
i
did
the
knight
this
features
the
new
torso
for
2008
and
is
the
height
of
fashion
this
brings
the
number
of
printed
torsos
from
the
crown
knights
to
three
which
allows
for
a
greater
variety
in
building
your
armies
a
new
fashion
sensation
and
all
the
must
have
accessories
for
this
season
with
a
more
heavily
armoured
look
he
's
ready
for
anything
the
rest
of
the
set
is
a
weapons
rack
i
assume
that
once
you
've
got
a
few
of
these
set
you
'll
probably
like
me
give
up
building
them
and
part
them
out
but
anyway
here
are
some
pictures
of
what
the
rest
of
the
elements
are
spent
on
a
long
and
complex
build
begins
after
360
hour
finally
it
's
finished
sadly
five
minfigs
were
hurt
in
the
construction
of
this
rack
now
the
money
shot
where
we
can
see
it
all
come
together
it
looks
great
even
the
rack
does
n't
look
to
bad
sadly
are
hero
was
n't
ready
for
other
themes
just
yet
in
total
we
have
a
good
army
builder
which
castle
fans
have
wanted
however
there
remains
a
question
in
my
mind
as
to
if
this
set
is
good
enough
on
it
's
own
without
any
other
castle
sets
i
ca
n't
see
it
being
to
much
fun
so
it
's
not
a
good
present

so
let
's
answer
the
question
is

all
castle

have
wanted
well
yes

no
is
the
answer
while
it
is
a
great
set
and
at
the
now

price
of

amazing
value
i
still
think
it
's
inferior

with

i
much
prefer
army
building
both
factions
at
once
positive
nice
review
and
i
especially
enjoyed
the
ending
i
personally
think
it
is
quite
a
good
set
for
the
price
considering
it
comes
with
a
fully
armed
minifig
along
with
enough
stuff
to
suit
up
another
i
just
wish

carried

diving
right

let
get
some
photos
of
the
box
the
digger
at
work
the
back
just
has
more
of
the
same
not
to
inspiring
once
we
open
the
box
we
find
two
poly
bags
and
some
instructions
the
total
contents
of
the
box
well
minus
the
air
instruction
booklet
short
and
simple
now
the
single
minfig
of
the
set
nothing
new
of
special
that
i
can
see
...
got
a
job
working
construction
for
the
johnstown
company
moving
onto
the
digger
itself
it
's
one
of
those
builds
where
all
you
really
need
is
a
quick
glance
at
the
instructions
and
off
you
go
side
view
of
the
finished
product
alternative
view
it
does
n't
look
to
bad
now
lets
add
our
construction
worker
looks
rather
good
though
the
lifting
action
is
n't
smooth
it
's
nothing
special
it
's
not
the
greatest
construction
set
that
lego
have
ever
produced
but
i
think
it
is
worth
the
money
the
arm
action
really
does
bug
me
though
the
rating
system
figures
510
just
another
construction
peon
parts
410
nothing
novel
and
i
dislike
the
new
digger
arm
system
fun
fun

710
i
think
the
playability
is
high
and
you
can
get
a
good
load
of
bricks
in
the
bucket
design
610
not
the
best
designed
digger
but
not
the
worst
price
710
a
reasonable
price
for
what
you
get
grand
total
2950
still
halfway
decent
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
conclusion
this
set
is
yet
another
in
a
long
line
of
lego
digger
and
to
be
honest
it
's
not
the
best
in
my
opinion
i
still
hold
nostalgic
memories
for
6504
which
i
still
think
is
a
great
digger
from
my
point
of
view
the
set
sits
to
high
off
the
ground
and
make
me
wonder
how
the
worker
gets
in
i
really
do
n't
like
the
digging
arm
action
it
will
never
be
smooth
and
while
it
poses
better
i
just
think
it
's
inferior
despite
this
i
still
think
it
's
not
a
bad
set
i
'd
just
like
it
to
be
so
much
more
negative
another
fine

i
love
the

the

this

are
much
different
than
those
from
previous
years
it
has
some
gaps
in
it
and
has
a
cardboard
backround
inside
of
it
the
box
itself
shows
assault
tiger
and
the
set
information
the
back
shows
a
combiner
the
cardboard
backdrop
a
very
nice
jungle
look
to
it
it
has
lots
of
fog
as
well
creating
a
pale

the

also
included
is

arent

mocists
will
love

the
figures
the
figures
included
are
takeshi
who
features
a
nice
new
torso
also
included
is
the
mini
robot
his
is
a
very
neat
little
guy
but
sadly
he
doesnt
really
become
a
weapon
more
of
a
block
of
red
and
black
bricks
the
torso
now
the
torso
design
for
assault
tiger
is
very
different
from
the
past
years
it
now
uses
a
castlelike
piece
as
the
main
structure
also
of
note
is
that
he
has
a
mini
throne
no
controls
sadly
and
with
the
orange
cockpit
piece
its
impossible
to
see
takeshi
when
looking
at
the
at
close
on
see
the
third
pic
the
legs
the
legs
are
slightly
similar
to
the
mt201
ultra
drill
walkers
but
have
been
modified
to
fit
the
at
they
are
quite
large
and
suit
their
purpose
the
arms
the
arms
follow
a
new
design
but
the
only
problem
is
they
have
no
elbow
or
hand
articulation
nice
weapons
though
the
finished
product
parts
1010
lots
of
useful
pieces
great
colors
and
some
very
cool
new
pieces
minifigs
810
a
robot
would
have
been
nice
and
a
better
weapon
mode
for
the
minirobot
would
have
been
good
price
per
part
710
a
stretch
playability
810
the
lack
of
elbow
and
wrist
articulation
isnt
the
greatest

b
assault
tiger
is
a
nice
set
but
some
of
those
small
little
things
can
truly
take
a
toll
on
the
final
rating
i
think
that
i
would
only
recommend
this

anyone
who
wants

am
positive
thanks
for
the
review
vbbn
i
have
to
say
ef
has
never
really
caught
my
attention
but
this
set
seems
alright
to
be
honest
when
i
saw
the
topic
title
i
was
expecting
a
tiger
looking
mech
the
mech
itself
is
cool
except
for
the
huge
leg
pieces
i
think
the
minifigs
are
great
in
ef
sets
with
the
dark
colored
outfits
like
dark
red
or
dark
green
positive
thanks
for
that
good
review
vbbn
that
´
s
really
a
fine
and
pretty
solid
looking
mecha
i
think
that
the
designers
did
a
good
job
on
this
last
wave
of
ef
sets
and
the
inclusion
of
these
mini
robots
was
also
a
pretty
smart
idea
positive
nice
to
see
a
well
done
review
this
set
is
one
of
the
few
exoforce
sets
i
havent
built
myself
yet
but
i
will
get
it
on
sale
guess
soon
im
do
not
like
the
use
of
slizerstyle
balljoints
in
exoforce
even
though
they
are
modified
to
2x2
bricks
in
this
particular
set
i
think
the
arms
look
weak
and
they
lack
elbow
joint
like
the
green
2008
mech
set
forgot
name
of
this
years
green
mech
quite
a
shame
i
find
it
really
hurts
the
functionality
of
that
green
set
and
could
imagine
the
same
with
the
tiger
i
guess
with
the
new
pyramide
brick
as
cockpit
the
cockpit
is
still
open
from
the
sides
and
the
back
i
modified
my
green
2008
mech
which
use
the
same
cockpit
design
with
a
few
green
bricks
and
it
is
now
completely
closed
from
all
sides
i
rate
the
tiger
at
average
but
i
may
change
my
mind
when
i
get
to
build
it
myself
front
positive
thanks
for
the
review
one
of
the
best
sets
in
the
entire
line
positive
the
assult
tiger
is
pretty
cool
positive
since
my
last
post
ive
had
the
chance
to
build
the
tiger
and
i
was
surprised
in
a
good
way
a
much
better
set
than
i
actually
thougth
front
positive
i
just
bought
2
of
them
since
they
were
5
each
from
lego
i
really
wish
they
did
not
cancel
this
series
positive
i
think
this
is
almost
the
best
set
in
the
exo
force
line
i
really
like
the
orange
cockpit
peice
positive
good
review
i
got
2
of
those
wheels
are
very
useful
especially
if
you
dont
have
any
as
for
shields
i
dont
imagine
trolls
use
them
too
much
i
think
that
they
fight
berserk
style
all
out
assault
one
complaint
is
the
piece
that
the
wheels
are
attached
to
its
a
single
piece
with
smaller
than
the
standard
pin
connection
so
you
cant
change
the
width
of
the
cart
for
your
mocs
using
the
wheels
i
dont
know
if
a
piece
with
such
a
connection
only
on
one
side
exists
though
positive
thanks
for
the
interview
i
nearly
forgot
this
set
is
out
yet
maybe
ill
grab
one
off
my
local

tomorrow

on
positive
im
not
really
impressed
by
this
set
as
much
as
other
impulse
sets
the
knight
impulse
set
5615
offers
more
in
my
opinion
since
it
gives
two
helmets
two
weapons
a
shield
and
an
armor
piece
along
with
the
weapon
rack
im
not
a
fan
in
the
slightest
of
flickfire
missles
and
projectiles
like
on
the
cart
and
the
previously
mentioned
one
piece
axle
limits
the
wheel
usage
in
other
mocs
i
wouldve
liked
to
see
an
added
chest
armor
piece
at
the
very
least
and
a
shield
wouldve
made
this
great
those
things
are
so
rare
and
it
wouldve
bumped
the
piece
count
up
to
21
to
match
the
knight
set
since
both
are
showing
the
same
price
on
shin

at

it
wouldve
made

not

there
's

'd

if
you

is

i
did
i
nice

i
think
the
fire
is
a

odd

it
does
add
playability
if
you
want
to
increase

conclusion
this

i
'd
necessarily
buy
but
while
i
was
at

today
i
decided
i
should
try
to
review
every

set
myself
so
that
why
i
bought
it
still
i
think
it
has
some
good

a

if
you
need
more
firefighting
kit
i
just
ca
n't
get

lack

would
have
made
it

not

you
can
still
buy
the
base
easily
anymore
the
contents
of
the
box
the
contents
of
the
box
it
$

s
rather
white
fairly
standard
mission
mars
spaceman
he
$

s
got
printing
front
and
back
but
sadly
no
air
tank
how
does
he
breath
as
has
been
pointed
out
he
does
have
a
printed
tank
but
id
rather
a
physical
one
note
the
megaphone
is
in
flashlight
mode
not
weapon
mode
that
$
™
s
important
the
robot
itself
feels
a
bit
clumsy
the
metal
detector
is
never
going
to
touch
the
ground
and
it
feel
a
bit
wide
i
don
$
™
t
like
the
look
of
him
something
in
the
eyes
the
reason
why
so
we
can
have
a
box
to
put
crystals
in
both
together
and
ready
to
explore
new
worlds
etc
sadly
the
robot
was
homicidal
remember
in
space
no
one
can
hear
you
scream
it
$
™
s
not
a
bad
impulse
set
and
if
it
marks
the
return
of
brick
built
robots
to
space
then
it
$
™
s
a
good
thing
i
just
feel
the
robot
could
have
been
better
built
the
rating
system
figures
610
not
to
bad
but
nothing
wonderful
parts
610
lots
of
white
and
not
much
orange
but
where
$

s
the
air
tank
fun
fun
fun
610
probably
the
best
impulse
set
as
a
stand
alon
toy
lots
to
do
with
a
robot
and
his
human
boss
design
510
the
robot
feels
clumsily
put
together
i
think
it
needs
work
price
810
can
$

t
fault
the
impulse
price
grand
total
3150
not
well
designed
but
does
have
more
play
value
than
other
impulse
sets
conclusion
i
was
surprised
that
mission
mars
got
impulse
sets
as
it
didn
$
™
t
seem
to
sell
as
well
as
other
lines
last
year
however
i
think
this
is
a
fairly
good
set
it
has
more
playability
than
other
sets
and
does
come
with
a
metal
detector
been
a
while
since
i
$
™
ve
seen
one
though
i
could
be
wrong
sadly
the
robot
isn
$

t
as
good
as
it

the
instructions
for
the

they
display

have

in

the
stars
of
the

batman
is
back
with
a
new
torso
much
more
metalic
than
before
harley
had
all
new
printed
torso
legs
a
new
head
and
that
sweet
new
hat
batcycle
the
bottom
part
is
very
sturdy
thanks
to
a
small
bit
of
technic
the
red
throws
it
off
a
bit
but
it
isnt
seen
once
the
top
part
is
put
on
it
has
a
nice
use
of
the
smoke
stacks
and
looks
very
nice
in
the
end
the
top
part
is
simple
but
suits
the
purpose
well
it
has
handle
bars
and
a
nice
motor
the
blue
is
a
little
strange
though
hammer
truck
the
hammer
truck
begins
with
a
very
sturdy
base
it
has
lots
of
detail
and
really
looks
cool
rims
added
lego
did
a
very
nice
job
at
giving
it
a
checker
board
appearence
the
only
problem
here
is
that
you
stick
a
sticker
over
two
bricks
multiple
times
jewels
inside
of
the
crate
are
these
shining
jewels
look
how
they
illuminate
the
darkness
in
gotham
more
added
then
we
add
on
a
spoiler
and
the
crate
looking
very
nice
now
the
detail
is
again
outstanding
and
it
has
a
good
amount
of
smoothness
to
it
the
infamous
hammer
okay
i
havent
said
this
yet
but
the
square
pieces
need
to
stop
first
on
those
sw
backta
tanks
now
on
the
hammer
it
creates
a
sloppy
look
for
the
hammer
still
this
is
the
ultimate
wacking
weapon
added
to
the
truck
on
the
truck
it
works
pretty
well
but
the
handle
is
to
short
and
its
near
impossible
to
smash
batman
the
finished
truck
the
finished
truck
is
really
nice
the
big
wheels
give
it
the
monster
truck
feel
and
the
way
that
lego
alternated
the
colors
works
well
the
cockpit
is
a
little
palin
but
thats
not
a
major
issue
the
i
love
joker
sticker
is
one
of
the
best
stickers
ive
seen
its
simply
a
classic
the
finished

lots
of
good

are
always

the

set
7886
is
a
very
nice
set
and
has
some
great
details
in
it
the
minifigs
are
very
cool
as
well
however
their
are
some
flaws
first
the
hammer
is
two
short
and
is
kind
of
square
the
batcycle
has
a
few
awkward
colors
in
it
which
throws
it
off
a
bit
this
set
is
definatly
worth
the
money
batman
fans
will
love
it
and
also
wacking
fans
will
like
it
for
that
hammer

since

i
could
not

the

of

sparkling
golden
chest
out
of
my
mind
i
finally
just
purchased
the
chest
for
myself
i
suppose
this
is
a
testament
to
how
well
honed
your
picture
taking
skills
are
this
set
is
definitely
a
nice
one
im
not
a
lego
indy
collector
but
i
was
tempted
to
purchase
this
set
several
times
the
vehicles
are
very
nicely
detailed
and
have
some
cool
building
techniques
such
as
the
wheel
guards
positive
great
review
i
was
debating
on
whether
or
not
to
snag
this
up
before
its
gone
and
i

i
will
great
review
and
thanks
again

another
great

i
have
to
give
it
a
i
have
thought
about
this
set
long
and
hard
and
your

might
just
force
me
to
pick
it
up
the
vehicles
look
nice

the

are

welcome

we

route
delivering
the
days
mail
when
i
first
saw
this
set
i
immiediately
liked
iti
think
tlg
should
make
more
of
these
everyday

type
sets
such
as
delivering

the

before
very
rectangular
the

art
is
pretty
nice
the

shows
the

delivering
some

the

on
the

is
the

as
on
the

random
manual
shot
the
manual
does
not
have
the
piece
call
outs
but
on
a
small
set
like
this
i
dont
feel
its
needed
parts
list
decent
selection
of
parts
i
really
like
the
mail
pieces
image
at
the
back
of
the
manual
showing
all
of
the
cargo
sets
together
in
a
little
scene
i
like
it
when
the
manuals
have
images
like
these
because
its
nice
to
see
all
of
the
sets
together
all
of
the
parts
spread
out
the
parts
in
this
set
are
pretty
good
unfortunatly
the
car
base
is
one
large
piece
however
we
do
get
2
printed
mail
pieces
which
are
always
nice
our
trusty
mailman
this
torso
i
think
is
very
nice
the
little
envelope
is
a
nice
touch
extra
parts
not
much
to
say
here
the
finished
set
i
really
like
the
design
of
the
van
it
looks
very
smooth
and
somehow
looks
very
lego
to
me
the
colors
are
my
favorite
part
the
red
and
yellow
look
nice
together
a
nice
mailbox
however
i
wish
the
letter
on
the
front
was
printed
the
front
of
the
van
is
nice
i
think
the
textured
brick
on
the
front
gives
it
a
different
look
on
the
front
which
is
nice
the
back
of
the
van
the
doors
open
to
store
mail
although
it
doesnt
have
much
room
i
like
that
they
included
this
feature
delivery
the
mail
bricks
slide
right
into
the
hole
at
the
front
this
adds
nice
playability
the
vans
all
loaded
up
we
are
ready
to
deliver
parts
710
pretty
good
piece
selection
but
for
8
should
have
included
a
few
more
playability810
its
fun
to
deliver
the
mail
to
all
of
your
towns
residents
design
910
the
design
is
very
nice
except
i
feel
that
some
of
the
stickered
parts
could
have
been
printed
overall
2430
after
a
long
hard
day
of
delivering
mail
theres
nothing
like
enjoying
a
nice
pizza
and
letting
your
hair
out
why
do
they
make
us
wear
those
silly
hats
anyway
this
is
a
nice
set
that
i
can
definitely
recommend
and
i
think
tlg
should
certainly
release
a
post
office
to
go
with
this
and
the
air
mail
set
i
really
like
these
everyday
life
sets
rather
than
always
fighting
crime
or
putting
out
fires
those
guys
have
normal

it
certainly
adds

to

and
thus
not
a

set
especailly
taking
its

into

its
value
is
pretty

just

if

in

this

is

positive
thanks

i
was
thinking
of
getting
this
set
and
having
read
your
review
went
out
today
and
got
it
what
a
great
little
set
what
i
particularly
like
very
sturdy
build
feels
very
solid
as
you
build
the
pickup
compared
to
the
fire
pickup
trailer
i
also
have
the
orange
pieces
my
first
pieces
in
this
colour
the
tyres
which
give
the
smoothest
ride
of
any
lego
towncity
vehicle
ive
ever
built
the
raised
suspension
and
side
runners
the
coast
guard
dude
again
a
first
for
me
and
his
megacool
flippers
and
aqualung
the
jetski
controls
the
handlebars
actually
move
left
to
right
which
is
a
great
detail
little
details
that
lego
didnt
have
to
do
the
grey
handle
by
the
ball
joint
moving
handlebars
the
new
tyres
as
you
can
probably
guess
i
have
voted
outstanding

this

do

you
do
get
a
piece
call
out
with
this
set
i
did
anyway
its
on
the
back
of
the
small
poster
that
is
included
in
the
set
i
meant
the
piece
call
outs
during
the
build
that
show
which
pieces
you
need
for
that
step
and
cardinal
brick
im
not
quite
sure
what
you
mean
but
i
cetainly
think
that
this
jetski
is
wonderful
positive
nice
set
nice
review
i
already
have
one
coastguard
set
that
truck
but
i
like
the
idea
very
much
however
the
rigid
inflatables
could
be
much
improved
see
the
real
ones
at
wwwrnlicouk
or
wwwknrmnl
positive
great
review
of
a
great
set
one
question
how
does
the
robotarmpiece
connect
to
the
jetski
positive
the
coast
guard
sets
are
very
eye
catching
the
color
scheme
is
making
me
want
to
pick
up
the
entire
line
although
the
offshore
platform
hasnt
been
released
stateside
yet
ive
had
my
eye
on
this
particular
set
for
a
few
weeks
now
and
is
near
the
top
of
my
to
buy
list
with
instructions
provided
on
legocom
i
build
a
dr
infero
version
of
the
jet
ski
to
replace
the
one
used
in
mission
2
swamp
raid
its
a
very
sturdy
design
bulky
enough
to
make
it
feel
like
a
real
vehicle
great
review
too
thankyou
for
the
closer
look

it
gets
placed
on
top
of
this
piece
i
thought
so
so
thanks
for
confirming
neutral
i
had
to
vote
outstanding
on
this
set
because
it
simply
is
great
minifigs
a
cool
head
sculpture
and
a
nice
little
boat
means
unlimited
playability
great
review
though
man
positive
what
a
great
review
of
an
excellent
set
i
love
the
islanders
and
that
drum
outstanding
i
think
these
islander
sets
never
got
the
credit
they
dserved
i
really
like
this
set
and
its
a
great
addition
to
the
pirate
collection
positive
i
feel
the
same
way
about
the
islanders
sets
brickster
they
are
a
nice
change
from
the
regular
pirate
versus
soldiers
that
is
the
norm
i
think
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
some
new
islanders
sets
released
in
the
new
pirate
line
to
see
how
tlc
would
make
them
neutral
what
a
wonderful
review
with
smart
showing
the
right
parts
and
clear
pictures
fantastic
job
erdbeereis1
this
set
is
interesting
for
several
reasons
first
of
all
it
contains
a
large
amount
of
very
useful
minifigs
not
many
sets
of
this
size
contain
so
much
figs
secondly
the
throne
itself
can
be
easily
combined
with
the
other
islander
sets
or
even
with
other
pirate
and
nonpirate
sets
im
going
to
see
if
i
can
get
this
one
for
a
reasonable
price
on
ebay
positive
excellent
review
i
want
this
set
now
positive
thanks
for
the
great
review
this
set
is
pretty
standard
as
islanders
go
but
it
is
such
a
cool
subtheme
that
i
dont
care
a
bit
i
totally
agree
with
your
comment
about
old
and
new
sets
i
dont
think
i
would
enjoy
lego
as
much
if
i
didnt
have
a
decent
amount
of
kits
from
pre
1999
negative
17
for
an
old
set
is
good
i
may
hunt
for
it
on
ebay
neutral
an
outstanding
set
because
who
doesnt
love
islanders
outstanding
review
as
well
positive
an
outstanding
set
too
bad
that
i
couldnt
get
this
set
set
when
it
came
out
positive
very
solid
set
5
minifigs
and
plenty
of
weapons
to
go
around
adding
up
to
great
playability
what
more
could
you
want
aspecially
from
a
set
this
size
only
i
would
have
liked
another
cutlass
a
musket
instead
of
1
of
the
pistols
and
for
1
of
the
pirates
to
have
another
head
but
those
things
are
no
big
deal
it
is
still
a
lot
better
than
sets
nowadays

those
indians
look
useful
for
indiana
jones
in
the
future
as
long
as
the
have
the
new
skin
color
i
wish
i
could
have
picked
one
of
those
up
when
i
could
neutral
well
this
is
a
not
so
old
set
and
i
bet
most
of
you
already
have
it
so
here
is
another
review
from
me
as
usual
let
us
start
off
with
the
box
art
box
art
i
like
the
box
art
they
put
a
nice
background
for
the
atap
at
the
side
we
have
the
minifigs
scale
and
at
the
back
there
is
the
function
shown
and
advertisement
for
other
set
the
content
the
content
is
consist
of
6
packets
of
bricks
and
a
instruction
book
yeap
no
sticker
sheet
instruction
book
the
instruction
books
not
only
show
us
the
steps
but
also
show
us
all
a
clear
pictures
of
the
january
release
sets
and
some
sets
show
with
their
function
well
this
includes
the
atap
functions
as
well
besides
there
are
bricks
checklist
as
well
and
the
how
do
you
start
off
before
assemble
your
sets
and
a
little
poster
where
the
clones
with
their
atap
battling
the
droids
heres
a
random
page
new
pieces
to
me
i
never
see
both
of
this
piece
before
so
i
assume
it
is
a
new
pieces
anyone
have
any
idea
is
there
any
other
sets
that
contains
this
piece
the
blasters
we
are
given
a
2
long
blasters
which
is
great
which
i
it
is
more
accurate
as
most
of
the
clone
troopers
use
a
long
blaster
the
minifigs
the
minifigs
is
2
shock
trooper
but
is
different
with
7655
clone
troopers
battle
packss
shock
trooper
the
leg
is
different
in
colour
we
are
given
white
hip
while
the
one
in
the
battle
pack
are
given
a
black
hip
furthermore
we
get
a
new
printed
headgear
which
i
think
they
have
improve
it
check
out
the
mouth
printing
the
colour
is
brighter
so
here
is
the
headgear
the
headgear
limit
itself
from
turning
to
the
side
this
is
because
the
front
part
it
is
too
low
until
it
block
by
the
torso
the
shock
troopers
without
helmet
on
we
are
given
a
black
stud
no
face
printed
how
i
wish
that
i
have
extra
with
helmet
on
comparison
with
shock
troopers
from
battle
pack
the
atap
heres
the
atap
it
looks
ugly
at
a
certain
angle
and
looks
great
in
a
certain
angle
anyway
i
still
like
the
set
i
like
the
walker
vehicle
below
are
the
pictures
taken
randomly
top
view
side
view
without
stabilizer
leg
with
stabilizer
leg
rear
view
the
functions
well
the
functions
are
not
so
impressive
just
something
turning
around
open
here
and
there
the
only
function
that
is
say
as
special
is
the
retractable
stabilizer
leg
the
cockpit
the
cockpit
can
fit
two
clone
troopers
but
too
bad
we
are
only
given
two
and
is
not
enough
as
there
is
no
gunner
on
top
inside
it
there
is
a
guns
holders
which
can
hold
two
guns
but
fall
off
easily
when
you
are
trying
to
remove
the
guns
well
the
other
side
have
some
speedometre
thing
and
a
controller
to
reveal
the
cockpit
you
have
to
open
the
top
hatch
look
below
so
you
can
see
whats
inside
oops
the
side
hatch
and
back
hatch
as
well
open
and
close
i
think
this
pieces
is
use
not
to
let
you
open
the
hatch
but
to
make
some
design
i
mean
make
it
able
to
move
inside
with
clones
beneath
so
this
is
the
pieces
that
hold
the
stabilizer
leg
when
is
not
in
use
this
is
how
the
stabilizer
leg
move
at
last
and
of
course
the
revealing
cockpit
from
below
and
at
the
back
guess
the
droids
have
alternative
way
to
take
this
things
down
faster
the
leg
there
are
pieces
blocking
the
leg
to
go
to
the
front
i
mean
overhead
and
lose
balance
the
base
in
not
movable
the
side
armor
the
side
armor
has
door
and
this
is
how
it
is
attach
it
is
very
flimsy
when
you
want
to
adjust
it
to
be
a
little
steep
to
creat
the
shape
they
might
just
fall
off
so
it
is
connected
to
the
body
with
just
a
technic
pin
and
to
hold
it
properly
here
is
the
support
the
side
hatch
it
open
and
close
easily
very
loose
nothing
to
hold
it
tight
heres
some
view
when
the
side
hatch
is
open
the
cannon
the
cannon
on
top
is
movable
and
adjustable
the
big
cannon
can
move
up
and
down
while
the
smaller
one
can
cove
sideways
but
the
smaller
one
tend
to
lose
balance
when
it
is
without
minifigs
means
the
one
on
top
and
below
will
not
b
align
this
is
the
pieces
that
only
enable
it
to
move
up
and
down
to
prevent
it
from
moving
freely
lego
put
two
pieces
to
block
it
completion
i
try
to
make
the
sets
looks
great
i
think
this
angle
is
right
spare
parts
it
is
so
few
compare
with
7673
magna
guard
starfighter
and
it
is
more
expensive
overall
this
set
is
not
really
a
good
set
the
hatch
is
quite
flimsy
top
and
the
side
since
there
is
nothing
to
hold
them
tight
besides
it
is
lack
of
one
clone
but
to
complete
your
walker
collection
you
must
have
it
pros
no
sticker
needed
new
improved
headgear
long
balsters
cons
lack
of
clone
flimsy
expensive
as
few
pieces
are
given
hope
you
guys
like
it

i

the
the

i
am
very
fussy
and
i
dont
mix
them
i
also
expect
other
clone
to
be
in
this
set

it
came
with
2
shocks
i
buy
it
because
i
like
the
walker
vehicle
negative
i
agree
the
pure
white
legs
are
odd
as
is
the
inclusion
of
shocks
instead
of
pilots
or
regulars
or
maybe
even
kashykk

might
have
been
better

good
review
for
a
simple
set
while
it
does
come
with
the
basics
for
an
impulse
set
i
just
feel
that
it
lacks
something
though
i
am
not
sure
what
perhaps
a
printed
magic
scroll
i
am
still
not
a
fan
of
the
printed
cap
especially
the
stars
but
i
do
like
the
printed
pants
displaying
his
various
goodies
hanging
from
his
belt
the
plain
torso
is
to
be
expected
from
a
wizard

suppose
overall
its
not
a
bad
set
but
it
certainly
feels
to
be
lacking
something
imo
neutral
kudos
on
a
well
presented
and
written
review
i
think
the
reason
this
set
didnt
release
in
us
was
because
it
didnt
have
any
warnings
about
choking
anywhere
on
the
box
therefore
no
lawsuits
in
us
for
lego

as
always
we
begin
outside
of
the

it
looks
rather
exciting
at
first

set
that
cost
a
lot
more
than
this
one
now
for
what
$
™
s
inside
the
contents
of
the
box
the
impulse
sets
never
look
that
inspiring
now
for
the
alien
i
have
to
say
i
$
™
m
not
impressed
i
$
™
m
not
a
big
space
fan
and
i
only
bought
this
due
to
my
impulse
review
challenge
but
as
the
main
point
of
the
impulse
sets
is
the
alien
is
a
little
hard
to
build
a
good
set
round
something
with
one
point
or
articulation
it
lacks
what
make
lego
minfigs
so
great
their
articulation
now
for
the
space
vehicle
as
always
with
impulse
a
short
and
easy
build
ensues
took
maybe
2
mins
at
the
most
time
to
mount
the
alien
in
his
craft
the
craft
looks
a
little
wide
for
him
slightly
better
from
this
angle
but
still
not
winning
any
awards
i
$
™
m
disappointed
of
the
impulse
sets
i
$
™
ve
reviewed
so
far
this
is
clearly
the
weakest
of
them
but
what
really
disappointing
is

i
$

m
annoyed
from
the
outside
of
the

this
set
looks
quite
interesting
and
certainly
appears
to
be
well
designed
the
idea
of
a
small
alien

craft
is
in
my
opinion
a
good
one
but
sadly
when
you
$

ve
got
the
finished
product
in
your
hand
it
looks
nothing
like
the

art
while
i
think
mission

had
some
interesting
sets
and
i
might
still
get
some
of
them

will
not

me

with

of

got
ta
ask
you
though
how
does
the
set
look
nothing
like
the
box
art
with
so
few
pieces
id
have
thought
one
could
mentally
put
it
together
given
the
box
front
neutral
i
'm
not
a
great
communicator
but
what
i
was
trying
to
say
was
that
on
the
box
the
sets
looks
quite
exciting
and
well
made
and
that
the
alien
fits
much
more
snugly
than
it
does
so
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
that
it
seemed
wider
and
less
compact
and
certainly
less
exciting
when
i
opened
it
negative
well
now
we
at

know
that
we
can
avoid
that
set

thanks
for
the
review
considering
the
price
i
give
it

didnt
buy
any
of
the

impulse
sets
as
i
dont
think
they
are
good
value
negative
i
rated
this
poor
due
to
the
fact
the
set
is
unimaginative
looks
like
a
bunch
of
plates
where
thrown
together
and
it
just
isnt
worth
the
money
lego
is
asking
for
it
imo
ive
never
been
a
fan
of
the
nonarticulated
jellies
so
ill
leave
my
disgust
for
them
out
of
this
post
however
unlike
the
set
the
review
is
a
fine
work
of
art
that
clearly
depicts
the
goods
and
provides
valuable
insightopinions
about
the
sets
playability
usefulness
and
overall

conclusion
until

came

this

we
$

ve
been
suffering
from
a
lack
of
minfig
based
sets
and
from
this
review
i
think
you
can
see
why
for
many
of
us
and
i
include
myself
here
lego
minifig
are
one
of
the
best
parts
of
the
hobby
and
sets
like
these
allowed
you
to
build
up
a
much
larger
number
of
figs
lego
did
well
with
this
set
a
nice
range
of
figure
and
also
a
good
selection
of
accessor
positive
you
you
got
it
mint
in
sealed
box
it
indeed
is
a
nice
set
i
am
not
into
space
but
nevertheless
this
set
is
a
good
addition
if
you
need
to
get
your
space
environment
a
little
bit
more
crowded
lego
however
is
planning
to
release
a
minifig
set
again
next

city
and
of
course
the
advent
calendars
are
also
quite
nice
to
get
some
figs

accessories

hello
everyone
today
i
will
review
the
extremely
underrated
hailfire
tank
and
spider
droid
set
i
hope
this
review
does
it
justice
so
lets
start
with
the
box
note
this
picture
is
not
mine
standard
box
for
star
wars
in
that
time
the
background
on
the
box
looks
like
its
from
geonosis
indicating
that
this
set
is
from
episode
ii
and
not
iii
or
the
clone
wars
the
back
of
the
box
not
shown
shows
the
playability
functions
and
some
other
sets
that
were
released
at
the
same
time
as
this
overview
here
is
an
overview
of
the
whole
set
it
comes
with
one
construction
manual
and
no
sticker
sheets
this
is
a
very
simple
set
but
with
not
much
to
it
it
is
still
a
very
important
part
of
the
cis
army
especially
if
you
are
interested
in
army
building
i
like
to
call
this
set
a
super
battle
pack
and
youll
find
out
why
soon
lets
get
right
to
it
and
look
at
the
feature
of
the
set
the
hailfire
tank
front
a
front
view
of
the
very
cool
tank
here
you
can
see
two
triangular
shields
on
the
hull
the
main
body
is
very
simple
but
altogether
very
effective
and
clever
and
making
it
really
look
like
a
hailfire
tank
although
a
little
bit
sized
down
from
its
movie
version
the
transred
stud
used
as
the
eye
makes
the
tank
look
more
menacing
side
the
side
view
the
wheels
are
very
easy
to
make
but
its
a
real
pain
to
connect
all
of
those
chain
links
together
i
dont
see
what
you
could
use
the
links
for
except
for
another
tank
but
maybe
someone
creative
will
find
something
for
these
the
dark
tan
is
nice
though
the
wheels
are
held
on
by
technic
poles
and
the
tank
rolls
on
the
wheels
fairly
well
on
carpet
or
a
hard
surface
back
this
is
the
back
of
the
tank
here
you
can
see
eight
flickfire
missiles
four
on
each
side
of
the
new
type
so
they
dont
easily
fall
out
also
note
the
modified
2x2
with
extended
hole
piece
sticking
out
of
the
back
this
may
be
used
to
easily
push
around
the
tank
i
just
wish
you
could
fit
a
droid
in
the
body
for
the
cockpit
now
we
move
on
to
the
spider
droid
or
what
i
like
to
call
the
dwarf
spider
the
front
this
one
is
also
simple
but
very
cleverly
built
the
main
body
is
two
semispheres
connected
together
for
rotation
and
an
antenna
a
cannon
four
legs
and
eyes
made
out
of
a
useful
telephone
piece
the
picture
speaks
for
itself
as
far
as
how
the
gun
and
eyes
are
built
side
a
side
view
you
can
now
see
the
legs
better
which
are
more
sturdy
then
you
would
think
each
one
is
made
out
of
two
pearl
bronze
exoforce
robot
arms
a
useful
bley
handgun
piece
and
a
dark
bley
battle
droid
body
all
connected
to
the
under
body
a
big
knoblike
piece
back
the
back
not
much
to
say
here
i
like
this
spider
droid
because
it
is
very
sturdy
and
the
legs
are
easy
to
adjust
finally
we
look
at
the
minifigs
there
are
four
minifigs
in
this
set
which
is
quite
generous
for
a
set
of
this
size
it
comes
with
a
yellow
battle
droid
commander
i
really
like
this
one
two
battle
droids
and
a
super
battle
droid
all
three
battle
droids
have
the
new
blaster
pistols
and
one
twisted
arm
thats
about
it
for
the
review
so
here
is
the
final
verdict
build
810
very
fun
and
easy
besides
the
chain
links
should
take
the
seasoned
builder
less
than
20
minutes
playability
710
the
flickfire
missiles
are
fun
as
well
as
just
zooming
around
the
tank
could
use
some
clones
for
a
battle
swooshability
810
you
can
roll
around
the
hailfire
fairly
well
minifigs
910
a
generous
amount
of
figs
and
all
are
pretty
good
design
9510
a
really
simple
and
clever
set
although
a
little
too
small
for
the
movie
version
price
1010
a
very
fair
price
considering
the
priceperparts
ratio
and
the
coolness
of
the
set
overall
score
8510
a
very
neat
set
to
have
a
great
army
builder
and
great
for
display
next
to
all
of
the
other
cis
sets
the
price
is
fair
the
figs
are
good
and
the
build
is
very
clever
thats
all
for
now
folks
please
feel
free
to
give
some
feedback

thanks
for
sharing
this
review
with
us
i
think
this
one
of
the
sets
in
europe
this
thing
is
waaaay
overpriced
and
thus
makes
it
a
crappy
set
we
pay
nearly
double
the
us
price
so
i
rated
it
poor
also
because
the
figs
included
does
not
make
it
great
the
hailfire
is
well
designed
and
looks
great
but
thats
just
about
all
there
is
worthy
of
a
positive
mentioning
sorry
on
a
side
note
as
a
bronzeawarded
student
wheres
the
price
in
eur
and
gbp
and
wheres
the
poll
nevermind
the
poll
ive
added
that
one
for
you
oh
yes
i
will
add
the
other
prices
and
i
was
going
to
make
a
poll
for
it
i
made
one
for
the
homing

review
but
you
beat

great

i
agree
that
this
set
is
underrated
the
hailfire
is
supposed
to
be
a
little
taller
than
two
battle
droids
so
scalewise
its
nice
the
dwarf
spider
droid
is
amazing
in
my
opinion
i
just
wish
it
wasnt
brown
it
makes
me
feel
like
its
on

we
never
saw
a
grey
varient
of
the
hailfire
so
its
fine
with
me
that
its
brown
positive
this
is
a
must
have
set
for
aotc
fans
and
i
really
love
the
hailfire

but
it

at
first
glance
this
ball
on
legs
may
not
seem
like
much

hopefully
this

will
change

box

box

for
all
of
the

wars
sets
sleek
shiny
and

look
the
blueandwhite
color
scheme
is

portrays
that
the

are
based
off
of
a

well
this
box
has
a

although
you
wont

r
us
because
of
the
big
clone
wars
display
in
the
front
of
the
store
that
you
cant
miss
overview
in
this
picture
you
can
see
the
contents
of
the
whole
set
minus
the
instruction
booklet
built
you
can
spot
five
minifigures
which
ill
get
to
later
and
a
very
tall
cis
weapon
known
as
the
homing
spider
droid
this
weapon
of
destruction
is
a
musthave
for
your
cis
army
although
the
color
scheme
mostly
dark
bley
and
light
bley
is
a
change
up
from
the
regular
colors
brown
or
blue
of
the
cis
this
may
have
something
to
do
with
the
blended
armies
of
the
trade
federation
and
corporate
alliance
but
i
dont
know
for
sure
the
instruction
manual
is
very
thin
only
about
twenty
pages
homing
spider
droid
this
is
the
main
part
of
the
set
four
huge
legs
two
mounted
guns
and
a
red
sensor
eye
are
the
highlights
of
this
artillery
unit
theres
not
many
playability
factors
to
this
one
but
sometimes
its
just
fun
to
squash
the
little
clones
a
changeup
of
the
contrary
it
also
looks
good
next
to
all
of
the
other
cis
sets
but
you
might
want
to
clear
some
room
in
your
display
area
the
legs
take
up
a
lot
of
room
this
thing
is
also
massively
tall
about
the
same
height
as
the
republic
cruiser
main
body
this
is
the
main
body
of
the
spider
which
has
no
cockpit
and
is
remote
controlled
this
spherical
body
not
in
that
sort
of
way
is
a
very
quick
build
and
features
a
big
red
eye
connected
by
a
red
stud
and
hinge
top
gun
here
is
the
top
gun
not
with
tom
cruise
which
is
connected
to
the
body
using
a
clever
technic
system
pun
not
intended
as
you
can
see
from
this
picture
you
can
see
that
it
can
rotate
a
full
360
degrees
but
only
if
you
remove
the
eye
also
the
gun
can
be
pulled
back
and
if
you
let
go
it
will
snap
back
like
the
a
gun
does
when
fired
due
to
the
force
of
the
shot
im
not
sure
this
was
intended
by
tlg
because
it
wasnt
showed
anywhere
on
the
box
or
in
the
manual
lower
gun
here
is
the
gun
attached
to
the
under
body
of
the
main
part
it
is
attached
using
a
hinge
which
allows
it
to
move
up
and
down
i
also
like
the
cord
that
presumably
transfers
power
included
on
both
guns
hips
here
is
one
of
the
hips
attaching
the
legs
to
the
body
there
is
one
on
each
side
with
two
legs
each
the
are
attached
to
the
body
and
legs
with
technic
pieces
legs
you
can
see
the
tall
legs
in
this
pic
they
are
basically
just
technic
poles
and
connectors
feet
this
is
one
of
the
feet
the
essential
to
balancing
the
whole
vehicle
these
and
the
legs
are
repetitive
so
i
suggest
doing
them
all
at
the
same
time
to
avoid
flipping
back
in
the
manual
and
repeating
the
process
three
more
times
the
picture
speaks
for
itself
for
the
design
of
the
feet
all
are
connected
to
the
legs
using
a
doubleholed
technic
piece
one
massive
son
of
a
gun
this
thing
is
so
tall
it
frightens
the
skin
off
of
even
the
toughest
most
experienced
soldiers
run
for
your
lives
look
at
how
much
havoc
and
fear
it
causes
family
photo
enough
of
the
battle
scenes
here
is
a
shot
of
this
spider
with
its
smaller
cousin
the
dwarf
spider
droid
minifigs
finally
here
are
the
minifigs
that
come
with
this
set
there
are
five
in
all
which
include
battle
droid
nothing
special
but
still
an
addition
to
your
army
commander
battle
droid
i
love
that
yellow
torso
super
battle
droid
again
nothing
special
clone
trooper
im
glad
they
gave
us
one
in
this
set
i
can
add
it
to
to
my
other
phase
1
clones
commander
fox
i
love
it
everything
from
the
dark
red
markings
to
the
accessories
are
fantastic
the
head
is
just
the
regular
anime
style
clone
wars
face
this
set
comes
with
two
flashlights
two
antennae
one
visor
one
pauldron
and
one
kama
closeup
of
fox
here
is
a
closeup
of
fox
so
you
can
see
the
detailed
insignia
of
the
republic
guard
that
wraps
it
up
for
the
review
here
is
the
final
verdict
build
810
very
easy
and
straightforward
a
little
repetitive
with
the
legs
should
take
the
seosoned
builder
around
20
minutes
playability
610
not
many
play
factors
but
its
fun
to
just
squash
puny
clones
with
this
giant
arachnid
swooshability
na
minifigs
1010
you
really
cant
ask
for
more
in
this
sort
of
set
design
810
not
very
sturdy
but
it
is
altogether
clever
price
510
yes
it
is
limited
edition
but
pumping
up
the
price
fifteen
dollars
more
than
it
should
be
is
a
little
ridiculous
overall
score
8510
an
excellent
set
for
display
although
not
very
sturdy
minifigs
are
superb
but
the
price
could
be
better
in
the
end
i
would
highly
recommend
this
to
any
prequel
trilogy
fan
looking
to
build
up
his
her
army
well
thats
about
it
for
this
review

i
just
bought
this
set
the
other
day
and
i
must
admit
that
it
gets
a
below
average
from
me
the
price
is
not
corresponding
with
what
you
get
which
would
be
implied
had
jim
added
the
eur
or
gbp
price
in
the
infohint
hint
the
spider
droid
is
flimsy
at
best
making
it
stand
or
even
move
without
tumbling
over
is
hard
also
why
the
brown
cylinders
on
the
legs
keep
the
colourscheme
clean
please
the
figs
are
fine
except
that
i
dislike
the
clone
headgear
and
the
fact
that
the
helmets
now
have
holes
in
the
sides
allowing
the
flesh
head
to
show
within
goofy
looking
i
am
soo
replacing
the
clone
heads
with
black
ones
great
review
of
an
acceptable
set
aw
thats
too
bad
kimt
while
i
must
admit
it
is
flimsy
i
still
love
this
set
oh
yeah
i
added
the
other
prices
thank
you
positive
i
love
the
look
of
this
set
its
the
closest
to
getting
a
walking
eye
from
the
venture
bros
as
well
as
the
droids
and
troopers
positive
thanks
for
the
review
i
really
do
like
the
first
year
of
ef
nowadays
they
mecha
are
perhaps
more
cleverly
designed
and
use
ball
joints
for
playability
but
i
really
love
the
blocky
bulky
look
of
the
first
drones
machines
and
somehow
the
older
ones
seem
a
better
value
of
parts
im
more
inclined
to
buy
duplicates
of
them
than
the
newer
models
neutral
thanks
for
the
review
this
is
one
of
the
few
first
wave
sets
that
i
didnt
get
im
not
really
sure
why
as
it
wasnt
too
expensive
neutral
thank
you
for
that
fine
review
thebrickster
i
really
like
how
this
two
small
sets
create
an
intense
and
adventurous
atmosphere
against
the
backdrop
of
a
pretty
exotic
region
the
sets
´
re
well
designed
and
very
nice
with
a
fine
amount
of
rather
unique
and
well
fitting
gear
the
whole
theme
offers
a
lot
of
playability
in
a
setup
that
´
s
a
little
different
to
tlc
´
s
standard
sceneries
for
sure
and
it
always
reminded
me
of
who
goes
there
too
positive
hi
great
review
on
one
of
my
favourite
themes
i
never
realized
how
cool
it
was
until
just
now
when
you
did
your
review
anyways
i
remember
my
one
set
of
the
arctict
expedition
the
arctic
expedition
pack
positive
a
very
nice
review
i
really
miss
the
arctic
theme
i
didnt
own
any
of
the
sets
but
after
looking
at
the
pictures
in
this
review
and
reading
the
instructions
on
brickleys
words
and
brickfactory
i
want
them
positive
i
find
it
amusing
that
the
numbers
on
the
decal
for
the
flag
were
chosen
so
that
it
wouldnt
look
stupid
if
you
put
it
on
upsidedown
by
accident
neutral
great
review
whitefang
and
co
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
one
im
glad
we
have
a
series
of
reviews
that
you
can
expect
to
be
packed
with
humour
and
craziness
looking
forward
to
the
next
peace
positive
it
can
never
be
a
happy
ending
for
stuadie
so
why
did
you
give
him
one
nice
review

neat
little
set
i
used
mine
as
the
air

unit
on
the
roof
of
my
chinese
restaurant
then
some
dork
told
me
it
didnt
look
believable
or
something
i
liked
it
um
so
great
review
thanks
for
presenting
it
i
give

and
lets
just
take
a
moment
to
get
sentimental
a
year
ago
today
staudie
had
a
lame
idea
interview
the
members
of
eb
he
flailed
around
with
it
for
a
few
interviews
including
the
infamous
one
where
hinck
attention
whored
sinner
into
a
corner
and
sinner
were
featured
reprising
their
roles
from
the
whacker
and
the
walrus
it
was
quite
memorable
but
then
a
short
time
later
someone
new
joined
the
team
bringing
it
to
a
new
level
of
polish
and
bad
jokes
still
this
tribute
isnt
dedicated
to
that
genius
of
the
written
word
nay
its
dedicated
to
the
whole
staff
including
the
new
guy
who
is
still
a
secret
so
dont
bother
asking
im
not
telling
ha
i
salute
you
eb
news
its
been
a
damn
fine
year
that
is
some
fine
history
from
the
eb
news
i
wonder
how
staudie
can
keep
up
with
his
sanity
asking
questions
around
i
am
so
happy

ever
wanted
to
turn
into
a
animal
wanted
to
curse
your
enemy
or
just
wanted
to
be
rich
beyond
your
wildest
dreams
you
should
go
visit
the
witch
and
her
fireplace
she
can
brew
you
up
a
potion
for
any
occasion
or
purpose
so
head
down
to
see
the
witch
right
now
although
this
set
is
from
the
fright
knights
theme
it
can
easily
fit
in
with
any
other
castle
theme
due
to
the
lack
of
specialised
fright
knight
parts
and
printings
the
set
comes
with
no
astounding
parts
but
looks
like
the
source
for
our
good
magician
impulse
set
from
the
current
castle
theme
i
think
i
got
this
as
a
promo
set
official
pic
the
box
art
for
the
set
has
the
standard
fright
knight
background
and
lego
system
logo
followed
by
the
set
number
down
the
left
hand
side
of
the
box
a
cat
is
attempting
a
head
stand
also
i
think
this
box
display
the
contents
of
the
set
in
an
attractive
set
up
as
usual
1
the
whole
set
minifigs
and
all
here
is
the
witch
on
the
torso
there
is
a
spider
amulet
which
is
a
little
hard
to
make
out
due
to
the
low
res
of
the
image
the
witches
wand
is
the
same
as
the
bellville
fairy
wands
except
in
trans
red
like
a
lightsaber
blade
although
it
is
completely
useful
as
a
lightsaber
as
you
have
probably
noticed
the
witch
has
no
legs
instead
she
has
a
slope
brick
with
the
dress
pattern
printed
on
witch
get
it
witchwhich
looks
better
than
asajj
ventress
from
the
new
clone
wars
sets
in
my
opinon
for
this
anyway
the
fairysaber
new
word
duel
this
is
the
old
run
down
fireplace
of
the
witch
at
the
base
there
are
two
smouldering
coals
instead
of
fire
witch
its
not
funny
any
more
is
it
doesnt
make
that
much
sense
seeming
as
it
is
a
fireplace
the
little
triangular
brick
on
top
doesnt
really
do
anything
i
also
accidentally
put
the
wrong
one
on
while
building
it
should
be
a
sloping
brick
here
are
the
coals
the
old
trans
orange
studs
are
less
translucent
than
the
new
ones
i
like
how
they
have
places
them
above
the
main
baseplate
on
a
1x2
plate
so
they
are
in
line
with
the
rest
of
the
fire
place
other
wise
it
would
look
wrong
here
is
everything
else
i
havent
covered
yet
the
crystal
ball
the
pets
and
the
magical
potion
vial
the
crystal
ball
is
identical
to
the
one
included
with
the
good
wizard
impulse
form
the
current
castle
theme
i
like
the
molds
for
the
cat
and
the
bat
although
if
the
cat
had
some
yellow
printing
for
the
eyes
like
the
white
cat
had
black
for
the
eyes
it
would
be
much
better
i
think
the
trans
green
tube
things
are
a
little
uncommon
but
im
not
worried
about
that
2
overall
build
610
extremely
puzzling
and
difficult
do
not
attempt
alone
its
pretty
simple
but
seeming
as
it
has
a
load
of
stuff
you
can
move
around
it
is
good
minifigs
910
i
really
like
the
witch
and
it
couldnt
have
really
come
with
anyone
else
also
it
came
with
the
wand
which
is
really
good
too
design
810
it
should
have
come
with
some
fire
and
maybe
some
more
orange
bricks
to
put
at
the
base
parts
810
the
minifigure
isnt
bad
nor
are
the
animals
or
the
trans
green
part
price
1010
i
am
guessing
this
was
pretty
good
seeming
as
i
think
i
got
this
as
a
promo
i
gave
it
10
because
it
was
free
playability
710
as
wth
all
impulse
sets
there
isnt
much
here
but
at
least
it
comes
with
some
animals
to
have
a
fight
with
or
give
the
witch
rabies
overall
810
if
it
came
with
some
more
stuff
for
the
fire
place
and
the
cat
was
more
detailed
it
would
have
scored
higher
but
because
this
set
can
easily
be
intergrated
with
other
castle
sets
it
got
a
mighty
8
3
mini
comic
hocus
pocus
magic
shocus
turn
my
pets
into
dinosaurs
not
to
catchy
is
it
poof
oh
know
i
think
i
might
drink
my
magical
potion
glug
glug
glug
oh
my
positive
i
chose
above
average
it
has
a
great
minifigure

you

i
feel
about
the
review
as
for
the

im
not
entirely
sure
its
a
fine
witch
but
youve
already
gotten
her
in
the
witchs
windship
and
a
few
other
sets
i
vote
average
on
this
a
good
minifig
though
one
does
not
have
the
need
for
more
than
one
witch
and
some

ever
wanted
to
turn
into

animal
wanted
to
curse
your

or
just
wanted
to
be
rich
beyond
your

you
should
go
visit
the
witch
and
her
fireplace
she
can
brew
you
up
a
potion
for
any
occasion
or
purpose
so
head
down
to
see
the

right
now
sounds
like

somehow
anyway
to
the
review
it
is
a
great
review
such
a
small
set
but
youve
summed
it
up
well
this
is
one
of
the
few
unpromo

i
didnt
get
sadly
not
sadly
because
of
willa
the

i
have
about

but
the

and
the

one
can
never

this

better

we
get

nothing
really
special
here
but
you
at

get
a
good

i
always
like

shields
and
these
are
no
exception
the
patterns
are
great

the
horses
these
are
great
the
knights
horses
coverings
are
really
nice
now
the
minifigs
the
knight
and
skeleton
both
have
nice
armor
the
torsos
are
plain
black
for
the
skeleton
and
bley
for
the
knight
the
finished
product
in
the
middle
is
the
jousting
barrier
which
is
simple
but
serves
its
purpose
on
the
left
we
have
the
weapon
rack
which
is
good
it
would
have
been
nice
if
tlg
had
included
a
rack
for
the
skeleton
as
well
though
extra

only
two
extra
white

here
you
can
use
them
if
your

horse
wants
to

look

i
think
many
people
were
deterred
from
this

because
of
the
low

a
high

for
it

it
does
come

overall

and

official
box

this
indicates
it
is
a
geonosis
set
from
the
background
but
it
is
no
different
from
any
other
set
same
old
brown
separatist

the
whole

some
red
tan
droids
would
have
been
nice
like
in
the
geonosian

set
all
the
minifigs
the
super
battle
droid
body
is
slightly
different
to
the
one
in
the
bp
it
looks
more
grainy
and
silver
i
doubt
this
has
any
relevance
for
it
being
a
geonosis
set
but
i
like
them
better
how
they
were
in
the
bps
the
super
battle
droid
body
dwarfing
the
commander
droids
body
i
think
that
the
new
commander
droids
body
is
better
than
the
old
one
with
just
the
yellow
strip
even
though
it
is
less
accurate
new
twisted
battle
droid
arm
each
droid
has
one
of

i
dont
really
like
having

with

i
think
the
older
guns
suited
them
much
better
2
hailfire
droid
hailfire
droid
by
itself
it
is
certainly
smaller
than
the
original
seeming
as
this
is
the
main
part
of
the
set
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
bigger
but
i
dont
mind
it
being
this
small
too
much
wheels
and
rockets
can
fold
outwards
and
inwards
the
wheels
which
spin
round
two
large
clear
discs
and
made
from
loads
of
these
tiny
links
this
is
probably
the
best
way
to
make
the
wheels
on
this
small
scale
the
only
other
alternatives
i
can
think
of
are
using
the
tracks
from
the
wookiee
attack
set
or
catterpilla
tracks
both
of
which
wouldnt
look
right
one
of
the
missile
pods
these
use
the
new
flickfire
missiles
which
dont
fall
out
are
an
excellent
idea
they
should
have
come
with
the
purple
cones
like
on
the
magna
guards
staffs
instead
of
red
though
because
in
the
film
the
missiles
are
purple
one
of
the
new
flickfire
missiles
that
dont
drop
out
when
the
model
is
tilted
forward
i
dont
know
what
the
holes
in
them
are
for
though
the
3
eyes
are
made
up
of
2
trans
red
cheese
bricks
for
the
sides
and
1
trans
red
stud
for
the
centeryou
can
also
see
how
the
missile
pods
are
attached
to
the
side
of
the
body
this
is
the
back
of
the
hailfire

there
is
a
plate
with
a
hole
in
i
have
found
only
one

the

the
design
has
been
greatly
improved
from
the

set
not
only
is
it
more
accurate
but
also
more
poseable
which
is
useful
when
setting
up
battle
scenes
the
ball
joint
provides
the
place
to
put

isnt

a

never

welcome
to
this
review
of
the
vwing
fighter
this
will
be
my
eighth
review
on
the
boards
strangely
enough
there
was
another
set
called
the
vwing
fighter
that
came
out
in
1997
for
the
space
theme
note
that
i
am
missing
several
small
pieces
to
this
set
but
they
are
mostly
insignificant
to
the
overall
look
the
box
this
is
the
standard
box
type
for
all
20052006
star
wars
sets
i
cant
say
that
i
like
it
as
much
as
the
2007
or
2008
box
types
but
itll
do
it
features
a
profile
view
of
darth
vader
and
silver
text
overview
this
is
the
whole
set
this
ship
is
meant
to
protect
the
chancellor
at
all
costs
they
are
usually
found
in
groups
of
three
or
four
front
this
ship
is
very
sleek
and
youll
notice
that
its
colors
are
dark
red
light
bley
and
dark
bley
with
a
touch
of
black
it
starts
at
the
nose
very
narrow
but
as
the
body
progresses
to
the
back
it
gets
wider
like
a
v
hence
the
name
back
here
is
a
view
of
the
rear
note
the
transneon
green
discs
used
to
represent
the
boosters
also
notice
the
dark
red
r4
astro
droid
and
the
hinges
used
as
aromor
flight
all
four
wings
two
on
each
side
can
open
up
for
flight
attack
mode
they
can
open
even
farther
then
the
pic
shows
but
its
not
an
intended
function
the
wings
a
great
but
its
a
real
pain
to
position
them
correctly
and
the
bottom
wings
close
when
you
set
the
ship
down
tail
fins
this
is
what
the
tail
fins
look
like
on
each
side
with
two
flaps
attached
to
the
top
and
bottom
if
you
look
closely
the
tail
fins
and
wings
look
a
little
bit
like
a
mini
ship
themselves
maybe
controlled
by
remote
no
this
is
not
an
intended
function
either
guns
side
the
guns
are
very
simple
but
very
clever
using
a
double
technic
hole
piece
two
black
bars
and
two
technic
pins
also
note
the
landing
gear
minifig
finally
here
is
the
minifig
a
clone
pilot
it
has
light
blue
arms
and
legs
white
hands
a
helmet
with
black
markings
and
republic
insignia
on
it
and
a
doublesided
torso
the
front
of
the
torso
is
great
featuring
shoulder
straps
armor
plating
and
a
life
support
system
while
this
minifig
is
not
altogether
accurate
to
the
movie
it
has
still
been
one
of
my
favorite
star
wars
figs
back
the
back
of
the
fig
that
can
double
as
the
front
of
clone
marines
this
side
features
shoulder
straps
and
armor
plating
cockpit
lastly
here
is
the
pilot
seated
in
the
cockpit
he
fits
perfectly
although
it
is
not
airtight
we
wouldnt
want
the
poor
guy
to
suffocate
now
would
we
that
wraps
up
the
review
here
is
the
final
verdict
build
810
a
nice
easy
build
and
the
last
of
the
small
sw
ships
10
or
less
playability
610
pretty
fun
to
swoosh
around
but
thats
about
it
could
use
a
vulture
droid
but
that
would
take
away
the
small
factor
swooshability
1010
very
fun
and
easy
to
swoosh
around
endlessly
without
fear
of
it
breaking
minifigs
910
there
really
is
no
need
to
have
more
although
a
palpy
fig
would
be
outstanding
the
pilot
is
a
great
figure
though
design
910
extremely
accurate
to
the
movie
but
the
cockpit
is
not
airtight
price
1010
you
couldnt
ask
for
a
better
deal
overall
score
86
an
excellent
set
unfortunately
this
is
the
last
of
the
small
sw
ships
currently
the
fig
is
great
and
the
sleek
design
is
accurate
that
just
about
sums
it
all
up

think
the

a
great
initiative
from
tlc
i
like
this
one

also
the
one
with
the
skellies
you
get
some
different
looking
soldiers

a
few

shields

thats
cool
the

make
it
so
that

i
love
this
set
i
bought
one
when
i
went
to
the
lego
store
at
downtown
disney
and
went
home
and
bought
another
online
i
love
that
it
gives
you
a
variety
of
weapons
and
figures
i
like
using
the
bowl

to
man
my
catapults

still

am
positive
i
like
your
review
on
this
battle
pack
but
i
think
that
this
battle
pack
was
over
priced
12
for
this
i
am
not
paying
that
much
for
5
knights
negative
dear
all
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
usefull
army
building
set
at
2
euro
per
minifig
it
is
relatively
cheap
in
my
book
so
i
bought
4
battle
packs
recently
although
it
could
be
difficult
to
integrate
all
of
them
in
your
army
personally
i
reshuffled
some
of
the
weapons
as
to
integrate
them
better
but
that
is
a
personal
preference
ofcourse
kind
regards
teddy
neutral
yeah
i
have
to
admit
you
expect
it
to
be
wayyy
cheaper
since
a
no
packaging
to
pay
forbaggies
and
such
b
no
liscensing
feeslike
sw
so
why
isnt
this
set
a
better
deal
than
sw
battlepack
dont
look
at
me
look
at
tlche
he
it
rhymed
negative
i
really
love
these
impulse
sets
at
a
low
price
point
for
lots
of
minifigs
this
police
one
doesnt
appeal
too
much
to
me
at
the
moment
but
who
knows
with
your
reference
i
may
need
it
with
a
future
project
hmm
its
actually
a
good
way
of
getting
those
dogs
cheaply
positive
i
also
love
the
impulse
sets
but
we
have
already
too
many
policemen
although
i
actually
bought
this
one
our
bobby
isnt
looking
very
nice
is
he
we
normally
but
policemen
in
a
pool
or
sea
with
sharks
at
events
like
legoworld
so
maybe
thats
because
of
me

i
bought
this
set
for
214
$
yesterday
and
i
have
to
admit
that
for
that
price
im
veerryy
satisfied
i
bought
it
especially
for
the
dog
my
first
one
and
for
the
road
sign
during
the
construction
short
of
the
set
i
was
wondering
something
does
the
speed
limit
has
a
signification
in
every
country
or
some
variant
exists
in
my
country
france
the
speed
limit
in
town
is
50
kmh
so
i
understand
the
road
sign
in
this
set
but
in
other
country
and
especially
the
country
were
the
speed
limit
is
not
in
kmh
does
this
set
had
another
road
sign
positive
not
a
bad
set
altough
the
radar
is
a
little
weird
looking
neutral
a
very
nice
set
but
one
of
my
least
wanted
impulse
sets
i
eventually
bought
it
and
looky
here
i
got
an
extra
doggy
positive
tanks
for
the
review
erdbeereis1
but
i
dont
really
need
to
buy
this
set
since
theyre
are
always
loads
of
police
sets
and
its
not
as
if
i
need
anymore
cops
although
stud
makes
it
tempting
neutral
i
agree
that
this
set
is
worth
the
price
considering
the
amount
of
minifigs
and
even
a
skeletal
horse
it
also
comes
with
a
lot
of
blue
1x1
slopes
that
are
always
useful
and
quite
rare
to
obtain
another
weapon
for
the
soldier
operating
the
catapult
or
a
shield
for
the
other
soldier
would
have
been
great
but
that
is
pushing
it
the
crossbow
itself
is
quite
nice
and
is
better
than
what
most
6
sets
come
with
imo
overall
a
good
set
indeed
thank
you
for
the
review
and
the
other
review
concerning
the
knight
of
which
i
hope
to
buy
in
the
near
future
as
it
looks
like
it
comes
with
a
great
deal
of
goodies
the
weapon
rack
is
useful
too
neutral
thanks
for
the
input
positive
i
like
this
set
mostly
because
it
has
some
very
usable
pieces
but
also
because
of
the
amount
of
minifigures
in
the
set
which
is
a
whopping
three
and
one
large
animal
skeleton
horse
the
one
thing
however
that
i
dont
like
about
it
is
that
one
of
the
catapult
operators
isnt
armed
in
my
opinion
this
would
have
been
a
good
time
for
tlg
to
release
a
suitable
dagger
piece
not
the
kitchen
knife
for
its
castle
line

nice
review
to
start
off
you
got
all
the
details
someone
could
possibly
need
in
my
opinion
at

i
do
enjoy
this
set
as
well
and
ive
bought
only
one
to
keep
my
minifigs
as
unique
as
possible
despite
my
personal
preference
i
still
find
this
a
nice
army
builder
good
amount
of
minifigs
for
the
price
as
mentioned
earlier
with
each
being
different
from
the
other
though
i
would
like
the
catapult
manager
to
be
armed
with
at
least
something
i
still
feel
that
he
can
just
flee
if
hes
ever
in
trouble
hes
a
good
guy
to
use
for
the
castle
gimmics
if
you
have
it
one
more

comment
i
also
love
those

if
they

comes
a

5

the

are

has

the

of
this

the

looks

this

uses

is
that
there
is

thanks
and
happy
building
positive
nice
review
it
seems
that
you
really
covered
all
aspects
of
this
fantastic
set
my
favorite
part
about
it
is
probably
the
fact
that
you
can
give
almost
every
included
minifig
a
mount
except
for
one
poor
knight
however
another
part
i
like
is
that
the
horse
includes
a
plain
saddle
which
is
a
nice
relief
after
the
overabundance
of
the
goldplate
barding
which
is
nice
but
overused
in
the
early
sets
also
the
sw
jokes
are
hilarious
i
particularly
the
running
gag
with
the
walker
but
i
like
this
one
too
reason
for

made

am
positive
youre
really
rolling
these
reviews
out
huh
i
am
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
this
set
while
it
does
include
five
figs
three
are
skeletons
and
are
generally
worth
much
less
than
say
three
trollsorcs
i
know
they
didnt
exist
at
this
point
in
time
so
this
is
understandable
the
amount
of
horses
is
nice
but
im
not
a
big
lego
horse
fan
what
this
set
does
have
is
a
great
appearance
and
brings
atmosphere
to
the
table
20
is
an
affordable
amount
for
those
of
us
who
do
not
wish
to
splurge
too
much
on
a
toy
while
being
enough
to
actually
get
a
large
enough
set
to
create
something
out
of
personally
id
rate
it
in
between
average
and
above
average
like
another
castle
set
i
cant
remember
which
i
just
feel
this
one
also
lacks
something
neutral
well
indeed
looks
like
a
very
nice
set
especially
the
scared
knights
are
very
nice

one
of
the
best

this
was

i
got
from

outstanding
positive
that
's
a
nice
review
though
i
do
feel
the
price
was
a
little
high
but
as
you
said
you
get
so
much
in
it
last
year
argos
in
the
uk
reduced
it
to
#
799
which
was
a
true
bargain
and
sent
me
all
over
london
looking
for
a
store
with
more
in
stock
again
as
with
all
the
lego
castle
sets
i
think
what
makes
it
work
so
well
is
that
lego
are
now
providing
a
much
larger
number
of
minfigs
and
that
's
often
what
makes
a
set
neutral
thanks
for
the
great
review
i
was
going
to
buy
this
set
this
saturday
and
after

i
am
twice
as
likely
to
buy
it
positive
i
bought
this
set
to
have
the
scared
minifig
but
i
found
a
lot
of
cool
pieces
and
stuffs
i
love
this
set
positive
other
than
the
minis
accessories
and
animals
this
set
is
meh
at
best
negative
i
really
do
love
this
set
it
has
5
figures
which
is
unheard
of
for
a
20
set
it
comes
with
plenty
of
weapons
and
accessories
and
has
a
great
design
the
detail
is
really
well
done
and
for
anyone
who
wants
to
just
buy
one
set
this
set
allows
for
hour
of
fun
just
by
itself
i
already
have
one
of
these
and
hopefully
will
be
getting
a
second
positive
this
was
my
first
set
from
the
new
line
so
im
rather
partial
to
it
im
glad
to
see
it
get
such
high
praise
its
quite
the
lovely
little
halloweeny
set
i
wonder
if
thebrickster
could
modify
this

thanks
for
the
great
review
this
is
one
of
my
favorite

i
think
its
a
lot
better
than
the
cement
mixer
from
the
classic
town

and
it
has
some
cool
pieces
too

i

you
mentioned
i
both
bought
and
sold

introduction
here
i
am
with
one
of
the
newest
castle
sets
realeased
in
early
2008
its
a
small
battle
wagon
with
blades
on
the
front
probably
to
demolish
rocks
in
mines
but
in
this
case
our
hero
dwarf
has
to
use
his
machine
against
the
evil
trolls
who
want
to
destroy
his
happy
kingdom
there
is
only
one
small
booklet
for
instructions
no
alternate
model
parts
come
in
two
bags
one
for
small
pieces
and
one
for
bigger
ones
apart
from
the
lovely
figures
the
brown
parts
will
be
quite
useful
for
any
castle
builder
extra
parts
are
not
even
worth
mentioning
there
are
no
stickers
figures
are
detailed
enough
dwarf
is
lovely
with
his
beard
but
his
legs
wont
move
because
he
is
short
figures
are
the
main
attraction
for
adult
players
we
havent
seen
castle
army
builder
sets
for
a
long
while
and
this
is
closest
weve
got
in
recent
years
the
dwarf
is
a
little
taller
than
it
should
have
been
but
its
not
possible
to
do
so
without
creating
a
completely
new
mould
for
figures
and
that
would
be
expensive
its
beard
is
oversized
as
well
but
that
gives
him
a
legoish
look
which
i
like
a
lot
the
trolls
thats
what
everybody
calls
them
but
i
say
they
are
orcs
are
obviously
evil
but
they
are
friendly
enough
not
to
scare
our
munchkins
but
i
wish
they
had
different
torsos
or
at
least
different
faces
like
crownies
there
are
not
enough
weapons
to
arm
everyone
but
the
flag
pole
is
really
nice
unlike
the
star
wars
army
builders
this
set
has
very
little
weaponry
only
one
sword
and
one
pike
creates
scarcity
for
3
figures
star
wars
sets
had
4
figures
for
same
price
so
i
hope
our
middle
age
warriors
dont
come
across
any
stormtroopers
building
in
progress
when
you
pull
the
chain
the
catapult
fires
a
round
brick
the
set
has
quite
good
playability
moving
blades
and
firing
catapult
should
be
fun
for
little
children
i
wouldnt
expect
more
functions
for
such
a
small
sized
model
it
hardly
covers
my
hand
the
blades
move
with
the
front
wheel
on
the
right
there
is
only
one
little
downside
there
is
too
much
friction
for
the
wheel
and
blades
wont
move
synchronized
you
may
come
over
this
problem
by
adjusting
the
blade
height
and
lining
them
with
the
wheels
mow
the
little
buggers
you
can
adjust
the
blade
height
there
isnt
enough

interested
conclusion
overall
its
a
nice
set
and
id
recommend
it
if
you
like
the
castle
theme
youll
find
some
good
use
for
the
figures
and
this
is
the
cheapest
figure
set
of
the

at

must

though
i
seem
to
be

it
an
awful

it
would
be
improved
by
the
addition

what
makes

opinion
is
the

2
orcs

else

while
i
was

a

i
decided
to
take
a

built
the

and
take
some
pictures
of
it
resulting
in
the

with

but
this
was
an

even
in

the
box
mine
is
a
bit
battered
by
the
owner
before
me
but
theres
still
plenty
to
see
this
is
one
of
the
largest
boxes
i
have
look
at
the
minifig
in
the
downright
corner
for
the
comparision
and
it
is
a
really
neat
storing
facility
for
many
sets
the
box
shows
the
set
and
in
the
background
the
silhouet
of
the
set
that
is
to
accompany
this
one
the
airport
from
1990
i
like
the
angle
of
the
box
showing
the
two
stations
track
and
train
in
one
picture
the
back
of
the
box
shows
some
really
nice
ideas
for
other
setups
why
oh
why
has
lego
abandonned
this
kind
of
showing
whats
possible
with
one
set
inside
flap
of
the
box
showing
details
of
the
set
and
the
functions
detail
on
the
front
of
the
box
displaying
the
dimensions
it
really
is
a
huge
track
layout
for
one
set
the
instructions
there
is
a
nice
little
booklet
showing
the
same
picture
as
the
box
art
with
the
figures
lined
up
underneath
the
last
page
nicely
folds
out
to
show
the
entire
setup
of
the
tracks
the
figures
a
brilliant
selection
of
minifigs
including
airport
people
and
a
cook
all
figures
that
are
supposed
to
go
on
the
shuttle
carry
a
ticket
and
there
are
also
some
suitcases
tickets
fit
inside
of
course
station
1
the
set
includes
two
stations
here
is
the
first
depicting
the
airport
there
are
lots
of
details
a
phonebooth
two
seats
some
flowers
a
map
luggagelockers
and
of
course
the
streetlights
a
detailed
shot
of
the
station
showing
the
luggagelockers
and
ticketvalidating
machine
part
of
the
beauty
of
this
set
is
the
fact
that
it
is
so
extremely
detailed
just
look
at
the
signs
to
show
where
to
go
next
stickers
and
the
scenery
opposite
the
street
the
station
has
the
same
shape
as
the
airport
shuttle
logo
how
sweet
is
that
the
station
pictured
as
part
of
the
layout
the
stations
ends
are
made
with
airplane
wings
to
smoothen
the
arrival
of
the
shuttle
station
2
here
is
the
second
station
my
personal
favorite
an
elevated
stop
with
a
little
snackbar
underneath
and
stairs
leading
to
the
platform
some
chairs
and
streetlights
here
as
well
plus
two
old
fashioned
trees
the
part
of
the
set
that
can
be
used
in
any
layout
the
snackbar
with
hamburger
sign
sticker
yes
those
hamburgers
look
tasty
indeed
also
notice
the
lights
hanging
from
the
platform
overhead
and
the
ticketvalidating
machine
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
here
we
have
the
platform
with
information
panels
and
seats
also
notice
the
two
trafficlights
for
the
train
heres
how
it
works
the
train
will
travel
in
the
direction
the
arrow
is
pointing
when
turning
the
knob
the
two
grey
blocks
will
move
towards
or
away
from
the
trackcenter
activating
a
button
on
the
centerpiece
of
the
train
the
motor
which
makes
the
train
start
its
journey
around
the
track
there
is
only
one
speed
and
the
train
can
only
be
put
to
a
stop
or
change
direction
at
stations
the
station
as
part
of
the
layout
the
shuttle
now
on
with
the
train
there
are
two
carrriages
connected
to
a
centered
motor
the
power
is
provided
by
means
of
a
batterybox
containing
a
9v
battery
the
batterybox
is
in
one
of
the
carriages
and
displays
airport
shuttle
a
total
of
five
passengers
can
be
seated
inside
leaving
room
for
their
luggage
and
two
drivers
the
front
carriage
with
the
button
for
the
batterybox
showing
the
underside
showing
the
gearwheel
metal
that
brings
the
power
from
the
motor
onto
the
geared
track
the
black
pointy
things
alongside
the
gearwheel
react
with
the
direction
knobs
at
stations
this
is
how
the
shuttle
negociates
with
height
differences
everything
hinges
and
rotates
making
the
shuttle
capable
of
performing
steep
climbs
the
motor
is
powerful
enough
to
not
slow
down
at
such
a
climb

showing
the
first

of

the

the
full

this
layout
is
quite
huge
involving
lots
of
track
pieces
ramps
ten
large
stanchionpoles
and
the
two
stations
to
show
the
movement
of
the

i
have
made
a
20

movie
which
can
be
seen
in
my
brickshelf
gallery
of
this
set
conclusion
well
to
conclude
the
review
some
final
thoughts
this
truly
is
one
of
the
more
detailed
sets
around
at
least
from
the
nineties
and
one
of
the
largest
in
dimensions
the
monorail
system
is
cleverly
thought
out
and
works
excellent
track
extensions
are
hard
to
get
however
and
very
expensive
nowdays
especially
the
switchpoints
and
long
straight
track
pieces
the
tracks
included
with
this
set
will
provide
you
with
hours
of
fun
though
because
there
are
a
lot
of
them
it
can
be
quite
hard
to
incorporate
the
monorail
in
your
town
without
having

you
can
get
it

i
can
only
reccommend
this
set
to
anyone
it
is
my
personal
favorite
set
upto
this
present
time
if
there
are
any
questions
ask
them
all
comments
are
welcome
of
course
positive
you
chose
the
perfect
set
for
your
first
poll
simon
no
question
this
set
is
one
of
the
alltimebeauties
i
rated
outstanding
of
course
i
never
hat
the
chance
to
get
a
complete
copy
of
this
set
but
i
do
own
the
engine
and
quite
a
bunch
of
monorail
tracks
your
very
detailed
review
made
me
think
of
getting
the
whole
set
some
day
thank
you
very
much
for
this
i
never
realized
there
were
so
many
details
included
to
this
set
the
snackbar
and
the
telephone
cell
and
all
the
other
nice
things
really
strange
for
a
nineties
set
which
often
lacked
details
the
only
thing
that
comes
to
my
mind
right
now
is
that
the
engine
looks
quite
blocky
if
the
set
was
released
today
tlc
would
use
more
of
those
parts
which
make
a
better
design
imo
and
it
would
fit
better
to
the
curved
walls
of
the
stations
as
well
wishful
thinkinghow
much
would
i
love
to
see
the
monorail
system
back
again
wishful
thinking
i
had
to
lough
when
reading
your
comment
on
the
minifig
seats
dont
you
own
many
of
those
i
dont
know
where
to
put
mine
positive
this
is
an
outstanding
review
which
deserved
to
be
featured
here
after
seeing
this
set
it
prompts
me
to
own
this
set
and
match
with
my
10159
legend
city
airport
its
very
nice
to
see
such
outstanding
set
being
reviewed
and
presented
to
our
very
screens
everything
about
this
set
is
simply
outstanding
i
cant
imagine
that
such
incredible
set
actually
released
before
why
dont
they
ever
continue
with
this
anymore
sigh
its
nice
to
see
so
much
detailed
from
its
shuttle
snack
bar
stairs
waiting
platform
validating
machine
and
etc
this
is
an
instant
5
set
if
given
a
chance
to
own
a
misb
set
i
will
defintely
seriously
consider
about
it
positive
yes
this
is
one
of
the
best
town
sets
ever
positive
who
was
the
one
who
rated
it
above
average
positive
great
review
of
a
greater
set
positive
sets
like
this
just
dont
come
around
too
often
do
they
i
didnt
realize
exactly
how
much
detail
really
was
in
this
set
tlc
should
bring
back
the
monorail
great
review
of
an
amazing
classic
town
set
positive
this
remains
the
definitive
city
set
in
my
eyes
i
never
managed
to
get
one
but
from
the
instructions
it
seems
to
be
perfect
in
just
about
every
way
i
got
the
two
space
monorails
a
while
ago
but
the
much
higher
prices
on
this
one
have
kept
it
out
my
reach
this
set
is
a
lot
bigger
than
either
of
those
though
i
always
liked
the
monorail
system
a
bit
better
than
the
trains
because
you
could
easily
incorporate
height
into
the
tracks
and
spread
them
out
in
all
three
dimensions
quote
edit
and
bricklink
is
wrong
giving
1991
as
the
release
date
youre
right
it
was
1990
it
was
apparently
released
in
1990
in
europe
and
1991
in
north
america
going
by
some
us
and
german
catalogs
i
have
from
that

i
realized
that
i
had
probably
spent
enough
since
coming
out
of
my
dark
ages
to
buy
a
misb

so
i
bought
it
and
i
am
going
to
cut
back
on
buying
other
sets
for
the
next
year
or
so
to
offset
the
one
big
purchase
those
glimpses
of
the
2009

havent
made
me
regret
the
cutback
that
must
be
one
of
the
biggest
expenses

with

it

ahem
back
on
topic
i
remember
wanting
this
set
badly
for
years
and
i
still
want
it
just
no
as
much
because
its
expensive
and
as
this
review
proves
takes
up
a
lot
of
room
ive
already
got
my
trains
to
think
about
and
i
wont
be
getting
this
set
anytime
soon
i
also
have
a
faint
memory
of
this
set
being
featured
in
one
of
legos
advertisements
more
specifically
someone
narrowly
missing
it
hitches
a
ride
races
the
monorail
to
the
airport
and
catches
the
plane
i
am
yet
to
find
it
on
the
net
as
old
lego
adverts
are
hard
to
come
by
especially
the
european
ones
now

more

came
up
with
the
garbage
bins
that
of
course
also
appear
in
this
set
have
you
ever
wondered
why
most
of
the
time
the
streets
of
lego
city
are
so
clean
and
neat
no
litter
no
garbage
everywhere
no
chewinggum
on
the
streets
even
with
so
many
different
inhabitants
it
seems
to
always
stay
that
way
however
the
older
afols
amongst
us
have
experienced
totally
different
situations
rubbish
everywhere
smelly
and
dirty
looking
pavements
minifigs
that
were
losing
their
standard
grin
that
is
why
lego
came
out
with
this
magnificent
truck
back
in
1987
before
that
people
needed
to
put
there
garbage
in
bags
or
maybe
barrels
from
that
year
on
every
miniman
and
miniwoman
is
happily
using
a
trash
bin
the
minifig
civil
servants
never
seem
to
become
tired
and
the
garbage
truck
comes
every
other
day
to
collect
the
rubbish
and
keep
the
city
clean
the
secret
behind
the
clean
lego
city
and
the
always
happy
standard
grin
of
our
minifolks
are
the
antilitter
warriors
that
use
their
powerful
machines
and
handy
tools
to
just
get
the
job
done
so
if
you
dont
own
a
garbage
truck
better
try
to
get
one
before
your
standard
grins
also
fade
and
your
streets
become
as
dirty
as
naples
where
the
garbage
collectors
recently
had
a
strike
for
quite
some
time
an
overview
of
the
set
including
instructions
actually
one
is
included
in
the
set
unfortunately
i
afraid
we
dont
have
any
boxes
of
this
set
left
another
image
of
the
lego
items
in
the
set
it
shows
the
truck
two
civil
servants
to
perform
the
waste
collection
duties
two
garbage
bins
and
a
broom
and
shovel
the
two
chaps
that
always
seem
to
smile
even
when
the
litter
that
they
collect
really
stinks
the
accessories
that
accompany
the
set
a
broom
and
a
shovel
to
help
cleaning
up
in
case
a
dustbin
tips
over
a
very
nice
feature
of
the
set
is
that
the
elevator
at
the
back
can
be
lifted
in
more
or
less
the
same
way
that
real
garbage
trucks
do
as
you
can
see
here
the
dustbin
is
emptied
through
a
red
train
window
it
seems
to
be
that
the
hinges
of
my
version
will
need
some
revision
panels
inside
the
back
of
the
truck
maximize
waste
capacity
for
this
4
stud
wide
truck
it
is
nice
that
the
designers
added
this
simple
red
round
brick
on
a
clip
presumably
it
should
depict
cylinders
to
let
the
back
compartment
tip
for
emptying
or
otherwise
it
might
be
gastanks
again
the
complete
set
it
is
very
complete
set
but
some
additions
could
make
it
even
more
playable
garbage
eg
a
green
flower
bottom
or
some
round
plates
1
x
1
a
place
for
the
second
worker
to
position
himself
on
when
the
trucks
needs
to
drive
to
the
dumpsite
or
an
other
street
and
also
vertical
bars
for
that
second
worker
to
hold
himself
by
this
is
what
the
truck
will
look
like
when
dumping
the
litter
at
the
recycle
plant
or
dump
site
the
whole
back
nicely
tilts
so
that
all
the
litter
will
fall
out
of
the
truck
a
view
on
the
back
of
the
truck
quite
a
small
but
yet
effective
opening
the
front
of
the
truck
only
one
seat
for
just
the
driver
but
i
personally
prefer
that
to
a
6
wide
truck
that
fills
the
total
width
of
the
streets
and
has
problems
with
corners
of
course
set
7991
the
orange
garbage
truck
of
last
year
is
also
nice
we
also
own
some
of
those
but
we
never
put
them
in
our
lego
town
since
they
take
too
much
room
and
the
color
scheme
of
6693
is
also
more
preferable
to
us
the
two
panels
with
the
printed
recycling
pattern
are
a
bit
worn
so
we
might
recreate
the
recycle
logo
and
put
it
on
a
sticker
some
day
playability
810
like
i
mentioned
it
is
too
bad
that
the
set
doesnt
have
any
litter
however
lego
also
saw
that
and
has
put
litter
in
the
6693

the

the

shop
that

all
the

i
was
allowed
to
take

it

that
those

still
have
quite
some

for
doing

stay
happy

additional
notes
on
the
review
my
brother
has
always
been
keen
on
garbage
trucks
however
when
he
became
aware
of
this
truck
it
wasnt
available
in
the
stores
anymore
newer
sets
that
had
the
recycling
theme
we
not
that
good
they
didnt
have
the
emptying
mechanism
so
after
our
dark
ages
one
of
the
first
sets
we
bought
were
some
of
those
nice
refuse
collection
trucks
although
the
new
orange
truck
has
the
desired
mechanisms
and
thankfully
is
a
decent
garbage
truck
we
more
like
4
wide
trucks
than
6
studs
wide
trucks
so
for
the
years
to
come
our
lego
town
inhabitants
will
still
be
seeing
this
great
truck
to
control
their
waste
problems
positive
it
would
be
cool
to
see
a
review
comparing
this
set
with
the
newer
orange
garbage
truck
neutral
this
truck
is
simply
beautiful
its
on
my
brickset
wanted
list
i
love
the
colour
scheme
red
and
yellow
are
the
right
choice
for
this
vehicle
the
back
part
of
the
truck
can
be
opened
so
it
can
discharge
the
rubbish
like
real
garbage
trucks
youve
also
mentioned
that
in
your
review
and
i
find
it
a
wonderful
detail
thanks
for
the
review
jopiek
positive
yeah
its
very
nice
along
with
all
the
older
sets
ive
got
the
cement
mixer
that
was
released
around
about
the
same
time
as
this
positive
thanks
for
the
review
like
many
such
town
sets
i
would
characterise
it
as
cute
contrasting
it
to
the
new
bin
lorry
its
nice
that
this
set
has
two
minfigs
more
realistic
and
two
bins
those
bins
are
a
great
addition
to
lego
although
wheelie
bins
would
be
nice
now
need
some
kind
of
2x2
container
you
can
clip
a
plate
onto
as
a
hinging
lid
and
clip
miniwheels
under
the
back
two
studs
having
two
minifigs
is
a
superior
point
for
this
earlier
lego
rendition
of
a
bin
lorry
in
fact
even
though
our
bins
are
now
emptied
by
a
private
company
rather
than
the
local
council
as
was
the
case
up
till
the
mid
90s
and
of
course
for
the
last
two
decades
there
have
been
wheeliebins
bin
lorries
have
three
guys
the
driver
and
two
collectors
however
our
bin
collectors
for
sure
dont
use
a
broom
or
shovel
indeed
on
occasion
theyve
befouled
the
street
themselves
if
something
goes
wrong
with
hoisting
the
bin
on
the
mechanism
the
shape
of
the
lorry
in
the
set
is
still
quite
accurate
pretty
good
for
a
fourwide
vehicle
i
must
admit
to
preferring
the
newer
vehicles
positive
thanks
so
much
for
the
great
review
i
love
that
truck
i
hadnt
realized
there
was
a
real
4wide
recycle
truck
out
there
i
must
get
it
one
day
to
replace
this
abomination
currently
doing
garbage
duty
in
my
town
i
think
that
truck
has
seven
pieces
total
in
it
i
do
like
the

color
though

i
own
this

however
because
it
was
really
cool
those
days
nowadays
all
trucks
nd
cars
can
do

things

that
wasnt

welcome
to
my
ninth
review
the
boards
todays
review
is
the
long
awaited
tie
interceptor
but
does
it
live
up
to
expectations
well
lets
find
out
i
believe
this
is
the
first
and
only
time
tlg
made
this
set
so
lets
begin
the
review
the
box
the
box
is
standard
for
its
time
with
silver
font
the
background
on
the
front
has
some
planets
and
the
death
star
ii
clarifying
that
this
set
is
from
episode
vi
overview
this
set
comes
with
the
interceptor
model
and
one
fig
the
interceptor
has
a
very
sleek
futuristic
design
with
four
wings
and
a
ballshaped
cockpit
the
tie
interceptor
is
a
stealthy
speedy
vehicle
in
the
imperial
fleet
it
is
used
for
scouting
missions
and
not
meant
for
attacking
due
to
its
weak
structure
and
low
arsenal
front
this
version
of
the
tie
group
is
very
attractive
and
coollooking
it
has
an
aerodynamic
shape
giving
it
looks
and
speed
while
not
accurate
to
the
movies
grey
and
black
colored
ties
the
blue
in
place
of
the
grey
is
just
fine
and
does
not
alter
the
coolness
of
the
design
thankfully
there
are
no
stickers
in
this
set
cockpit
here
you
can
see
the
ballshaped
cockpit
be
very
very
careful
when
opening
it
its
very
flimsy
and
breaks
off
almost
every
time
fortunately
both
the
windshield
and
the
dish
on
top
are
printed
and
not
stickers
please
dont
mind
the
dust
cockpit
interior
this
is
the
inside
of
the
cockpit
it
is
very
roomy
airtight
and
one
of
the
few
cockpits
in
sw
sets
that
are
this
good
it
makes
up
for
lack
of
detail
by
giving
the
pilot
plenty
of
room
so
you
should
have
no
trouble
there
it
is
also
very
smooth
in
the
back
and
where
the
windshield
folds
down
this
is
by
far
the
best
sw
cockpit
i
have
ever
seen
done
by
tlg
good
job
the
only
bad
thing
is
the
two
tan
bricks
that
clash
with
the
rest
of
the
color
wing
attachment
this
is
how
the
wings
are
attached
to
the
cockpit
on
each
side
unfortunately
the
design
on
this
part
is
not
so
good
and
sometimes
the
wings
break
off
plus
this
part
is
very
blocky
and
there
is
a
big
juniorized
piece
on
the
base
of
the
wings
wings
here
is
what
each
wing
looks
like
there
are
three
parts
on
each
wing
a
middle
and
two
fins
the
wings
are
very
aerodynamic
with
a
diamondlike
design
note
the
imperial
insignias
and
the
blue
tiles
lining
the
wings
wing
attachments
contd
here
again
you
see
how
the
middle
wing
part
is
attached
to
the
base
juniorized
piece
and
the
fins
attached
to
the
base
by
hinges
the
hinges
allow
the
fins
to
fold
in
and
out
a
bit
but
again
this
is
very
fragile
and
the
fins
often
break
off
gun
placements
this
is
an
example
of
four
guns
on
the
ship
one
on
the
tip
of
each
fin
the
guns
consist
of
a
tile
with
a
tenic
tunnel
hole
on
the
bottom
attached
to
a
technic
pin
which
is
attached
to
a
black
bar
a
good
design
altogether
back
here
you
see
the
rear
of
the
cockpit
you
can
see
why
the
opening
mechanism
is
so
flimsy
the
whole
top
and
front
is
connected
to
the
body
only
by
a
weak
hinge
system
as
seen
in
the
picture
also
note
the
small
transblue
dish
and
the
four
transred
studs
minifigure
finally
here
is
the
single
figure
that
comes
in
this
set
a
tie
pilot
it
is
an
all
black
figure
with
a
life
support
system
decal
on
the
front
and
a
helmet
with
silver
imperial
insignias
an
overall
good
minifig
with
a
different
helmet
mold
than
the
stormtrooper
or
shadowtrooper
well
i
suppose
thats
about
all
lets
get
to
the
final
verdict
build
610
a
little
difficult
due
the
flimsiness
of
the
ship
but
should
only
take
the
average
builder
no
more
than
30
minutes
playability
710
its
fun
to
fly
around
but
has
no
real
functions
swooshability
710
you
can
swoosh
it
around
fairly
well
just
be
careful
not
to
accidentally
break
it
minifigs
810
a
good
fig
although
having
only
one
leaves
something
more
to
be
desired
design
410
very
very
flimsy
with
the
wings
windshield
and
fins
but
good
for
display
price
710
i
think
it
was
actually
30
usd
when
i
got
it
but
im
not
sure
overall
score
65
an
average
set
very
delicate
so
much
that
you
can
hardly
pick
it
up
but
good
for
display
the
minifig
is
okay
and
having
no
stickers
is
good
i
would
recommend
this
to
a
hardcore
ot
fan
that
wraps
it
all
up
please
vote
your
opinion
on
this
set
in
the

and
ill
see

thanks
of

for

do
you
then
from

understand
what
the
purpose
is
of
the
front
spouts
that
even
can
be

since
that
puzzles
me
it
can
be
that
the
lego
designers
thought
it
was
a
nice
touch
and
didnt
bothered
about
the
realistic
value
of
such
a
feature
but
i
dont
suppose
that
that
is
the
case
here
positive
perfect
perhaps
the
front
sprouses
are
for
foaming

runway
youve
certainly
kept
that
set

we

introduction
this
week
i
got
the
flu
so
since
i
have
to
stay
home
and
get
better
i
might
as
well
make
a
review
its
one
of
the
most
amazing
older
city
sets
thus
making
it
a
really
valuable
review
this
is
the
story
about
four
handsome
firemen
living
in
one
of
the
most
amazing
city
structures
out
there
the
6389
fire
control
center
the
box
i
actually
didnt
remember
the
box
to
be
that
small
borrowed
from
peeron
the
four
hunky
firemen
oh
jeah
what
women
doesnt
like
a
man
in
a
uniform
the
manual
even
the
manual
is
aging
but
then
again
its
17
years
old
review
as
you
all
know
a
city
must
have
some
standard
civil
services
like
a
hospital
and
a
police
station
a
fire
house
also
is
a
must
for
any
lego
city
this
particular
fire
house
is
one
of
the
most
amazing
sets
ever
to
be
released
in
this
cool
set
you
get
4
minifigs
all
fire
fighters
two
verhicles
and
a
helicopter
firefighters
have
to
move
around
the
futuristic
fire
truck
is
definately
my
favourite
chiefs
car
the
smallest
verhicle
of
the
set
its
a
small
allterrain
jeep
for
the
fire
chief
pretty
much
a
standard
car
in
those
days
a
real
simple
layout
and
a
trunk
which
holds
a
small
fire
hose
its
lucky
to
be
in
this
set
because
it
complements
the
whole
thing
the
car
luckily
its
red
and
it
has
de
cool
signs
on
the
side
helicopter
another
great
addition
to
the
whole
set
is
the
helicopter
again
in
a
basic
setup
for
that
kind
of
verhicle
at
the
time
this
one
has
the
nice
addition
of
two
hoses
to
put
out
the
fires
raging
in
lego
city
the
chopper
no
it
doesnt
really
fly
really
cool
fire
truck
thingy
this
fire
truck
is
definately
the
best
of
the
verhicles
in
this
set
its
actually
a
futuristic
model
of
fire
trucks
i
havent
seen
any
other
fire
truck
like
this
i
saw
a
police
truck
like
it
though
but
were
talking
fire
fighters
right
actually
the
whole
thing
han
open
up
to
reveal
a
number
of
fire
fighting
appliances
such
as
a
hose
a
computer
and
a
oxygen
tank
the
fire
truck
click
for
bigger
version
the
main
building
actually
looks
kinda
empty
when
the
trucks
and
chopper
are
gone
however
this
still
is
realistic
compared
to
a
real
fire
house
also
the
front
has
those
amazing
sliding
doors
which
make
this
thing
really
look
cool
and
clean
off
to
fight
a
fire
main
structure
with
the
slinding
doors
pulled
down
actually
those
sliding
doors
are
also
the
hard
part
of
the
model
since
all
the
bricks
must
be
perfectly
aligned
or
else
the
doors
will
stutter
but
if
youre
a
little
familiar
with
lego
then
you
dont
need
to
worry
from
the
back
enough
room
to
play
with
im
going
to
give
my
perspectives
on
each
of
the
sides
on
the
left
we
have
the
garage
for
the
bigger
fire
truck
the
only
real
flaw
about
this
set
is
that
this
garage
isnt
long
enough
for
the
fire
truck
this
could
have
been
solved
by
making
it
two
or
three
studs
longer
notice
the
cool
sunroof
in
the
middle
we
have
the
chiefs
office
complete
with
coffee
machine
a
diversity
of
computers
and
a
tape
recorder
most
likely
to
tape
any
incoming
calls
a
lot
of
details
are
crammed
up
in
there
just
like
in
the
rest
of
the
set
to
the
right
is
the
helicopter
platform
i
really
like
the
greyblueyellow
of
the
platform
because
it
doesnt
look
so
red
anymore
dont
get
me
wrong
red
is
a
cool
color
but
not
too
much
red
and
the
helicopter
actually
fits
and
stays
in
place
during
playtime
the
baseplate
filled
up
this
picture
says
it
all
again
the
four
lego
hunks
are
greeting
all
the
ladies
the
minifigs
are
from
a
classic
series
this
happens
with
more
of
my
lego
sets
bottom
line
is
that
this
set
is
one
of
the
best
fire
houses
lego
created
verdict
the
build
is
pretty
easy
but
takes
a
while
to
really
see
where
you
are
with
your
building
its
nice
to
have
a
hospital
from
the
same
era
this
create
a
more
uniform
look
to
your
city

you
completed
the
model
your
baseplate
is
pretty
filled
up

in
this

the

covering

one
mod
project
i
have
in
mind
is
to
expand
the
base
adding
a
second
room
in
the
area
beneath
the
control
center
interestingly
this
set
had
two
different

was

that
it

it
doesnt

like
this

and
the
fire

is
not

it
does
have
a
downstairs
in
the
building
though
at
least
a
door
and
a
front
wall
anyway
its
nice
to
see
a
review
of
this
set
as
its
one
that
i
often
looked
at
in
the
catalogue
and
thought
of
getting
but
never
did
its
great
to
see
the
details
that
i
otherwise
would
not
have
seen
i
dont
like
the
firemen
with

though
they
should
have
helmets
or
caps
imho
thanks
for
the

imagine
that

is
still
in

from
early
80s

this
is
more
or
less
a
soapbox
racer
with
working
steering
but
no
engine
its
got
a
rather
blocky
design
but
still
looks
sleek
enough
and
is
a
simple
build
little
over
100
pcs

of

very
simple
and
boring
alternate
using
just
13
of
the
180
pieces
in
the
set
it
even
hasnt
got
a
seat
construction
its
just
a
plain
steering
mechanism
attached
on
wheels
with
a
spartan
chassis
of
just
a
few
pieces
this
is
the
whole
model
at
step
5
just
attach
the
steering
mechanism
and
wheels
and
youre
done
total
the
worst
alternate
model
of
the
complete
set
just
a
boring
410
3rd
model
balance
very
original
small
model
its
a
small
model
of
a
working
classic
balance
and
it
works
with
small
parts
laid
on
the
scales
altough
theyve
got
just
a
4x4
footprint
its
a
fast
build
just
15
minutes
and
youve
done
it
the
model
as
it
looks
at
step
3
finished
easy
build
with
just
63pcs
out
of
180
total
very
original
model
it
actually
works
with
small
weights
but
a
very
simple
build
still
a
710
alternate
model
tractor
with
equipment
this
is
the
second
model
its
a
simple
but
boxy
design
featuring
a
harrow
and
a
plough
the
tractor
has
a
similar
design
to
the
very
first
tractor
set
but
much
smaller
the
plough
is
about
24wide
and
the
harrow
is
completely
snotted
even
back
in
1983
has
two
functions
working
steering
and
the
coupler
for
the
equipment
uses
almost
all
pieces
of
the
set
the
tractor
at
step
8
the
steering
isnt
completely
attached
now
this
is
the
completed
tractor
the
complete
harrow
finished
alternate
with
the
plough
attached
total
nice
but
quite
ugly
and
boxy
design
for
a
tractor
with
4
wheels
of
the
same
size
takes
me
to
a
610
main
model
desert
racer
this
is
the
main
model
with
a
nice
for
early
80s
but
boxy
design
it
has
two
functions
steering
and
a
working
1cylinder
rear
engine
which
is
of
the
old
2x2
piston
type
since
the
small
piston
design
wasnt
invented
back
then
this
is
the
only
model
of
the
set
which
has
piece
callouts
in
the
instructions
the
printed
alternate
model
has
no
callouts
they
werent
invented
on
both
models
back
in
1983
the
three
smaller
photo
instruction
alternates
have
a
piece
callout
at
the
beginning
showing
all
needed
pieces
the
seat
is
a
nice
but
blocky
design
and
use
a
primitive
snot
technique
this
is
the
model
at
step
five
the
piston
is
already
attached
imagine
this
state
on
step
5
in
modern
sets
back
then
lego
had
challenging
instructions
not
the
step
madness
like
today
this
is
the
engine
just
made
of
plates
with
a
hole
in
the
middle
for
the
piston
step
9
the
piston
engine
is
completed
on
step
12
the
roll
bar
and
the
seat
are
installed
only
the
steering
isnt
completed
yet
front
view
of
the
finished
model
just
15
steps
needed
back
then
birds

view
of
the
whole
set
displayed
on
the
box
model
verdict
nice
design
especially
the
colorful
seat
in
snot
technique
but
quite
boxy
especially
the
engine
since
there
were
only
the
huge
pistons
still
a
910
set
verdict
design
and
models
710
very
boxy
designs
due
to
the

the

quite
challenging

introduction
our
most
favorite
theme
is
12v
trains
actually
i
got
my
first
77series
back
in
1981
5th
of
december
i
was
25
years
old
just
a
week
before
my
brother
was
born
some
years
later
i
got
the
7740
after
our
dark
ages
we
my
brother
cousin
and
myself
got
all
12v
trains
at
least
once
this
7725
was
gathering
dust
in
my
brothers
room
the
train
in
all
its
splendor
as
you
can
see
it
doesnt
occur
at
the
back
of
the
12v
era
train
instructions
although
its
larger
brother
the
7740
does
some
investigation
learned
that
all
the
sets
at
the
back
of
the
instructions
date
from
1980
so
the
7725
wasnt
released
yet
here
you
can
see
the
front
of
the
7725
with
the
driver
in
the
cockpit
the
driver
is
in
fact
the
only
minifig
that
was
included
in
the
set
as
you
can
see
our
version
of
the
train
has
a
different
front
than
the
one
in
the
instructions
apparently
the
former
owner
used
7861
lighting
set
12
v
to
upgrade
the
train
with
working
back
and
frontlights
i
like
the
original
lights
but
didnt
notice
that
the
train
had
those
double
lights
until
i
did
the
review
maybe
we
will
give
the
train
again
its
original
signs
and
put
custom
leds
in
it
or
so
so
that
the
train
can
drive
into
two
directions
with
accurately
working
lights
another
thing
about
the
lights
that
puzzle
me
are
the
backlights
while
typing
this
i
realise
that
the
former
owner
might
have
added
those
so
lets
have
a
look
at
the
instructions
then
as
it
turns
out
the
lights
are
there
also
in
the
instructions
i
recently
learned
that
only
the
last
car
or
coach
of
a
train
has
its
red
lights
on
so
unless
the
train
drives
with
only
the
front
car
it
will
never
use
those
red
backlights
here
you
can
see
the
cockpit
with
the
engineer
the
cables
dont
look
very
pretty
but
well
the
train
at
least
has
working
light
here
you
can
take
a
look
at
the
inside
of
the
engine
car
while
the
7745
has
a
nice
fake
engine
there
just
the
weight
bricks
and
the
ugly
cables
apart
from
the
engineer
and
his
cockpit
no
other
nice
features
here
btw
lego
always
used
tiles
in
such
a
trains
to
make
it
easier
for
kids
to
take
off
the
roof
and
have
access
to
the
minifig
passengers
etc
here
the
proof
that
it
is
an
electric
train
the
pantograph
of
the
front
car
it
has
the
same
kind
of
panthographs
that
the
7745
has
the
middle
car
has
4
chairs
as
you
can
see
some
vandal
must
have
nocked
over
this
one
hope
they
leave
the
cables
alone
this
early
morning
train
seems
to
have
one
passenger
a
workman
i
like
the
small
2x3
windows
from
this
car
very
much
they
give
this
care
a
nice
look
also
the
door
in
the
middle
adds
something
special
to
the
train
as
far
as
i
know
no
other
passenger
train
has
the
doors
in
the
middle
here
you
see
the
side
of
the
train
just
after
the
train
has
left
brickingham
station
where
the
worker
probably
from
set
6647
highway
repair
that
was
also
released
in
1980
a
closeup
of
the
last
car
with
steering
stand
to
allow
the
train
to
travel
back
and
forth
without
having
to
make
head
in
other
words
putting
the
engine
in
front
again
the
train
shunted
to
an
end
track
so
it
can
be
cleaned
i
think
it
is
apparent
that
it
definitely
needs
cleaning
very
badly
this
set
can
be
found
on
peeron
lugnet
brickset
bricklink
entries
playability
510
the
train
is
fine
but
with
only
one
minifig
not
very
playable
without
other
sets
also
no
accessories
at
all
design
710
nice
train
the
inside
could
have
been
a
lot
better
but
i
really
like
to
original
front
lights
price
710
the
train
came
with
motor
so
not
a
bad
price
goes
now
for
quite
some
money
at
ebay
overall
6510
nice
set
but
the
7745
is
a
better
train
im
sure
well
that
was
it
for
today
i
hope
you
have
enjoyed
this
review
and
got
tears
in
your
eyes
seeing
how
nice
the
12v
era
was
it
never
comes
back
but
maybe
lego
rereleases
some
of
this
sets
in
the
2009
train
era
very
likely
that
this
is
just
wishful
thinking

said
the
chair
was
just
loose
so
it
should
be
placed
on
the
2x2
plate
that
is
also
visible
in
the
picture
of
the
middle
car
thats
not
the
one
i
was
thinking
of
it
was
the
other
two
chairs
towards
the
middle
of
the
wagon
that
i
was
thinking
of
if
you
try
to
seat
a
minifig
in
either
of
them
youll
quickly
find
that
its
impossible
beacuse
the
door
interferes
with
the
figs
required
personal
space
if
you
move
both
of
them
one
stud
forward
so
that
the
back
of
the
seat
lines
up
with
the
edge
of
the
window
itll
solve
the
problem
and
still
leave
space
for
a
figs
to
be
seated
in
the
other
chairs

during

in

their
big
store
had
a
neat
little
display
of
some
new
sets
and
themes
including
island
xtreme
stunts
the
new
theme
offered
great
colors
including
orange
tan
and
light
blue
which
immediately
caught
my
eye
the
theme
focussed
on
island
fun
with
some
adventure
and
included
some
great
figs
like
the
brickster
i
had
to
buy
at
least
one
set
choosing
truck

review
coming
soon
at
the
time
the
theme
was
short
lived
and
many
of
the
sets
were
on
sale
at
discount
toy
stores
not
too
long
after
their
initial
release
i
picked
up
this
set
6445
beach
cruisers
for
333
usd
which
will
be
my
first
of
three
island
xtreme
stunt
reviews
starting
with
the
box
a
race
between
the
street
surfer
and
skate
boarder
the
back
shows
some
alternate
models
including
a
sail
boat
and
jet
ski
same
image
on
the
instructions
as
the
box
but
the
backside
shows
the
island
xtreme
stunts
video
game
for
different
platforms
the
set
includes
a
small
decal
sheet
for
the
skateboard
i
love
the
two
figs
included
within
this
set
one
is
a
hippietype
with
shades
and
leafed
muscle
short
and
the
other
pizza
boy
skateboarder
check
out
the
pizza
boy
on
his
skateboard
two
green
brackets
are
included
for
attaching
each
fig
to
the
long
grey
bar
using
this
piece
one
can
make
the
skateboarder
do
tricks
and
flips
the
street
surfer
vehicle
is
pretty
nice
to
the
sail
is
placed
on
a
black
bar
and
lance
then
attached
to
the
vehicle
heres
a
picture
of
the
vehicle
to
me
it
has
that
old
soap
box
derby
look
to
it
like
something
kids
would
create
to
race
down
a
hill
the
vehicle
doesnt
have
a
steering
wheel
but
rather
two
levers
which
i
think
work
well
in
the
cockpit
heres
the
underside
the
set
has
three
neon
orange
wheels
that
attach
to
technic
axle
pins
to
attach
to
the
vehicle
lastly
the
entire
set
with
a
few
extra
pieces
final
thoughts
while
island
xtreme
stunts
is
not
the
best
citytown
subtheme
esp
for
the
traditional
lego
classic
town
fan
it
does
have
some
fun
sets
like
this
little
beach
cruiser
good
figs
a
skateboard
and
a
very
rollable
fun
word
equivalent
to
swooshable
but
for
vehicles
with
wheels
vehicle
you
can
even
blow
on
the
sail
to
get
it
to
roll
across
the
floor
this
set
is
a
lot
of
fun
neutral
great
review
i
would
buy
the
sets
but
sadly
tlc
doesnt
sell
them
anymore
i
have
one
question
only
how
can
you
be
reviewing
at
this
time
at

i
would
never
dream
of
doing
that
well

i
did
this

a
few
weeks
ago
and
just
now
posted
it
remember
also
that
we
are
on
different

zones
neutral
like
whitefang
i
too
only
remember
this
line
in
computer
game
form
i
used
to
love
that
game
i
actually
have
never
seen
a
review
for
an
xtreme
stunts
set
so
this
was
nice
to
see
as
for
the
set
i
think
it
looks
pretty
good
i
really
like
the
hippie
guy
the
windboard
thing
is
nice
as
well
but
looks
a
bit
strange
somehow
i
give
this
set
a
solid
3
out
of
5

this

the

line

was

after
that
as
a

of

had
a
cosy
evening
with

for

the

do
you
know
the
island
girls
name
not
included
in
this

though
neutral
her
name
was
sky
lane
its
quite
sad
though
to
actually
play
the
gamethe
xtreme
tower
is
the
only
set
that
made
it
into
the
game
itself

it
was
a
really
watered
down
version
of
the
information
center
from
the
first
two

the
island
was
in
the

filled
with
incredible

would
have
made
really
cool

nice

is
that
one
minifig
breaking
out
of

just
wondering
about
his
clothing
the
worst
thing
is
the

anything
with

almost
deserves

thanks
for
the
review
i
loved
this

it
had
some
of
the
greatest
pieces
ever
arranged
in
any
theme
brilliant
printed
parts
and
figures
and
some
good
colours
snap
lockitt
hippie
dude
is
a
great
figure
with
a
cool
name
i
own
him
from
another
set
but
unfortunately
not
this
one
it
looks
like
a
very
good
set
no
stickers
and
good
printed
parts
too
nice
review
hahaha
that
made
me
laugh
for
some
reason
i
dont
know
why
though
i
agree
with
it
i
have
him
as
well
i
got
him
from
the
orange
jetski
set
neutral
this
is
a
really
nice
small
set
i
think
it
fascinates
me
that
those
are
actual
printed
parts
thats
something
we
dont
see
too
often
anymore
the
figures
are
very
good
although
i
must
say
i
like
the
name
hippie
dude
better
than
snap
lockitt
does
anyone
know
why
the
brickster
has
one

it
is
not
very
often
that
i
rate
a
legoset
poor
its
the
first
time
actually
but
in
this
case
i
had
no
other
option
the
idea
of
this
set
is
good
and
i
like
the
mostly
yellow
minifig
but
the
design
of
both
the
airplane
weird
windowpiece
a
propellor
that
is
way
too
small
minimal
skies
underneath
and
a
strange
colourscheme
and
the
hangglider
two
handlebars
on
the
wings
too
many
colours
makes
the
set
mark
the
essence
of
legos
downfall
during
those
years
i
really
appreciate
the
fact
that
you
made
a
review
of
this
set
brickster
it
made
me
look
into
the
details
of
6735
but
i
am
just
as
sure
today
as
i
was
back
then
i
will
never
buy
this
anyway
thanks
for
the
review
the
quality
of
the
set
may
be
a
disapointment
your
review
certainly
is
not
negative
i
knew
this
set
looked
familiar
thank
you
brickster
for
bringing
one
of
my
first
lego
sets
ever
back
to
my
memory
unfortunately
i
dont
have
many
of
the
pieces
left
but
thank
you
neutral
thanks
for
the
nice

whitefang
i
quite
like
this
set
the
front
looks
a
bit
bare
but
for
a
small
set
like
this
it
doesnt
really
matter
this
set
gets
a
4
from
me
as
well
positive
thanks
erdbeereis1
for
your
kind
words
glad
you
liked
this
set
just
wondering
whom
has
rated
poor
and
below
average
i
will
like
to
know
why
you
voted
this
way
perhaps
you
could
share
with
me
and
the
rest
on
your
thoughts
and
views
neutral
nice
review
white
fang
this
really
reminds
me
of
an
allamerican
set
with
its
red
white
and
blue
colors
and
the
white
stars
although
i
really
like
the
fig
with
its
scruffy
bearded
face
i
find
the
green
torso
a
bit
odd
for
this
set
i
suppose
i
would
expect
some
sort
of
redblue
racer
fig
with
a
whiteblue
racing
helmet
swamp
sharks
too
funny
you
always
add
a
nice
addition
of
humor
to
your
reviews
now
im
going
to
check
out
some
wonder
woman
clips
on
youtube
positive
i
love
the
classic
sets
of
that
era
and
a
great
review
helps
show
off
the
simplicity
of
some
older
sets
positive
this
is
one
of
those
sets
that
make
me
really
want
to
start
building
up
a
city
its
a
great
value
has
a
lot
of
useful
pieces
and
is
just
plain
fun
to
play
with
i
do
miss
vehicles
having
doors
though
great
review
i
was
a
bit
curious
as
to
how
the
dumping
mechanism
worked
as
well
as
the
sticker
count
positive
yeah
the
name
on
this
set
is
strange
i
think
all
the
boxes
say
garbage
truck
i
guess
its
up
to
each
builder
to
decide
whether
1x1
round
plates
are
recyclable
material
or
not
its
a
great
model
in
any
case
i
love
these
highly
detailed
city
trucks
weve
been
getting
during
the
last
year
or
two
i
used
to
have
a
preference
for
the
late
80searly
90s
city
line
but
some
of
these
new
sets
have
really
surpassed
them
in
detail
and
functionality
positive
nice
truck
indeed
but
the
yellow
one
is
better
i
think
at
least
if
you
put
them
on
a
roadplate
it
seems
to
me
that
those
road
plates
are
too
small
for
that
also
it
will
not
empty
completely
because
of
that
panel
well
for
the
rest
it
is
a
nice
set
and
a
fine
review
positive
i
own
this
set
and
i
think
its
a
really
nice
truck
but
there
is
two
little
details
that
i
didnt
like
1
a
recycle
truck
really
needs
2
minifig
one
to
drive
one
to
put
the
garbage
on
the
back
2
the
big
hole
behind
the
driver
seat
it
was
easy
to
fill
it
like
this
with
hole
pouf
no
more
little
hole
but
this
is
really
a
great
set
anyway
45
for
me
above
average
positive
nice
review
this
is
a
very
nice
vehicle
one
of
my
favorite
of
the
newer
city
ones
jopiek
there
are
two
generations
of
road
plate
that
are
wide
enough
for
sixwide
vehicles
like
this
the
current
plates
are
dark
grey
with
plain
white
printing
and
look
not
great
in
my
opinion
the
previous
ones
are
imo
the
best
road
plates
of
all
time
green
with
dark
grey
road
white
dotted
linezebras
drain
covers
and
yellow
verge
markings
just
like
we
really
have
here
in
ireland
for
urban
area
i
would
still
choose
the
greenedged
plates
and
just
cover
up
the
green
the
markings
are
so
much
better
than
the
current
plates
neutral
jopiek
on

am
said
also
it
will
not
empty
completely
because
of
that
panel
actually
it
does
the
back
part
of
the
truck
with
the
panel
hinges
up
so
that
when
you
want
the
truck
to
dump
it
doesnt
get
in
the
way
positive
a
good
set
with
a
nice
color
scheme
i
still
prefer
the
last
one
that
had
a
removable
bin
positive
what
a
great
set
and
a
very
nice
review
erdbeereis
i
think
the
only
improvement
to
this
set
would
have
been
the
use
of
chrome
exhaust
pipes
and
front
grill
i
bought
this
set
with
a
lot
of
excitement
but
unfortunately
have
not
put
it
together
yet
what
are
your
thoughts
on
these
larger
6stud
wide
detailed
vehicles
as
opposed
to
4stud
wide
classics
heres
an
image
of
6668
recycle
truck
released
in
1992
ps
i
like
the
use
of
taking
out
sponge
bob
in
your
review
positive
this
looks
like
a
great
set
and
im
happy
you
were
dumping
spongebob
he
deserves
that
this
set
looks
very
nice
and
if
i
see
it
i
will
probably
pick
it
up
positive
thanks
for
this
review
i
really
love
this
set
its
perfect
for
my
town
and
brings
a
sense
of
classic
when
i
see
it
positive
thanks
for
the
review
this
is
one
of
the
few
city
sets
that
i
own
despite
loving
the
theme
so
much
most
of
my
town
is
either
custom
or
classic
and
its
about
as
beautiful
as
a
big
garbage
truck
can
ever
be
quote
nice
truck
indeed
but
the
yellow
one
is
better
i
think
at
least
if
you
put
them
on
a
roadplate
it
seems
to
me
that
those
road
plates
are
too
small
for
that
also
it
will
not
empty
completely
because
of
that
panel
well
for
the
rest
it
is
a
nice
set
and
a
fine
review
well
the
truck
barely
fits
onto
the
old
roadplates
not
on
curves
though
so
if
you
put
it
in
a
display
it
probably
wont
look
bad
i
think
from
what
i
see
this
and
all
the
other
6
wide
vehicles
will
fit
much
better
on
the
newer
roadplates
which
are
four
studs
wider
than
the
old
ones
positive
hi
i
bought
this
set
a
while
ago
and
have
since
remodeled
it
into
a
larger
8
wide
truck
now
it
can
hold
a
driver
and
passenger
its
kind
of
boxy
i
may
redesign
it
in
the
future
neutral
thats
a
really
nice
mod
badsneaker
the
added
bulk
serves
it
well
positive
that
looks
like
one
of
those
big
strange
recycle
trucks
from
new
york
city
i
like
it
positive
i
like
this
set
but
i
cant
give
it
a
good
grade
for
playability
as
the
rearmost
hinging
section
is
too
stiffly
hinged
so
when
you
open
it
its
likely
to
break
if
you
hold
it
just
over
the
shovel
and
broom
my
truck
thus
has
that
function
and
with
it
of
course
the
whole
container
tipping
disabled
i
also
moved
the
cab
a
bit
forward
and
the
front
axle
rearward
to
give
the
cab
the
typical
garbage
truck
look
as
they
are
often
very
low
slung
this
also
created
space
behind
the
cab
for
some
equipment
