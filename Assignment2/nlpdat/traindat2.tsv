306 lunar landing plates year released 1979 piece count 2 minifigs 0 list price unknown as part of the classic space collection lego offered two sets of moon plates one was a set of two crater plates and the other this very useful landing plate set not much to review but worth sharing a few images the landing plate and tplate the two plates connect to form this very nice classic space landing platform set 497 galaxy explorer included the landing platform but the one that i had was lighter in color than the one contained in this set at least the yellow circle future lego space sets could benefit by having similar road plates share your thoughts	neutral
cp5670 on jul 7 2008 1004 pm said i like the black space plates from the early 90s better 6710 awesome i had not seen these before they would really make nice plates for a sw death star scene thanks for sharing	positive
first what i liked sooooo much was the cover of these plates with this large picture of a classic space scene i still have a 306 misb just to keep that nice feeling of taking it out of a plastic box and look at it there were different versions of the cover though second the markings of the landing platform changed at some point id have to check it later when im at home think it had something to do with the interupted yellow lines	negative
whitefang on jul 7 2008 1142 pm said actually with only 2 plates i could not do much serious expansion with it instead i merged it with my old city baseplates and used it as a docking station for scientific purposes or restricted facilities that is guarded by the police you make a very good point there ive used these plates to represent restricted areas and even as simple airport runways beyond their space uses i never liked the black plates they were during my dark ages anyway so ive never really seen one up close but i have seen them used in a death star display as suggested and it turned out fairly well	neutral
why pay 350 dollars just download the instructions on buy the pieces off bricklink this is was i did when i wanted to create the blacktron ii in the futuron colour scheme also i tend to like both sets of base plates i bought the black ones myself and they were of great use but there more for creating the idea of a city or space station something more completely man made the gray ones give a better look of the roads being laid over bare rock especially when you introduce the plates with the craters i would love to see a 4848 baseplate with roads through them which would allow more building space on the side and maybe some craters also 4848 baseplates with craters but a few different kinds to create more or a realistic look and less of a repeating pattern and with all those rocks you have to put everything up on supports much better looking bases then	negative
kdog on jul 8 2008 0948 pm said thats the problem the instructions arent anywhere to be found not that ive seen the set does seem to have some rare parts but i doubt 350 worth by looking at the pictures used to display this set ive a sneaky suspicion it did not come with instructions but meant for the pictures to be ideas the whole set was suppose to teach children to use their imagination giving them instructions would somewhat defeat this while trying to figure how to build things from looking at pictures would be a much better educational experience	negative
i also love these plates i build a lot with them eg this  unfortunately they are not available in bley 	neutral
year released 1976 piece count 53 minifigs 2 lego brought out floating boats quite early and in many ways the first were the best ill explain why later this set in particular is interesting as it came out in two versions one that includes the first minifigs and another that included the nonarmless type set 709 the police signs are stickers and are in surprisingly good condition considering the age of the set i am missing one sticker on the front though note the technic bush and axel they are the old type the position of the second figure is not a mistake i think hes supposed to be sitting down the first boats out by lego needed a weighted keel to prevent them keeling over i have tested this i suspect this is because of the density of the old hulls and the flat bottom but i could be wrong it cant be just because of the flat bottom as the new cargo ship doesnt need one the keel in detail the bottom extension is for a motor not included nor made by lego at the time the keel had longer studs even now it holds extra firmly this is why i prefer the old design you can extend or shorten the hulls as you please or even insert other lego in the middle you can easily add wheels or any other piece to the bottom of these hulls i wish they would go back to this idea the 4 hulls were of this concept but were too wide probably so the keel wasnt needed the old minifigs aside from having odd feet and no arms had a normal stud as the neck thus when you turn the head it tends to come off i love this set	negative
great review sinner i own the later version 709 released in 1977 mine no longer has decals though the variations were minimal it looks like your boat is in really good shape considering its 30 years old excellent review	positive
sinner on jul 31 2008 0743 pm said you give a guy a holiday he comes back a comedian its too obvious for my taste words hurt you know	negative
i love those minifigs theyd go for alot on ebay i bet great boat as well i love the old hull design	positive
this set showed what potential variations on the standard brick had back then i think that tlg was still finding its legs back then and learning new things so this is a solid set for the year it was released nice review sinner	positive
thank you for the nice review sinner holodoc on aug 1 2008 0859 am said nice review sinner the old sets i donÂ´t know  every old set especially equipped with the old nonmoveable arms minifigs look very odd nowadays i agree with you with the hull shape and its possibility to be extended but every other aspect the lack of detail the keel itself you canÂ´t float it in shallow water keeps me from rating it higher than 310 in my opninion the best police boat so far is 4021 click to enlarge well if youre meaning really old sets than i agree with you but a lot of the sets from the very late 1970s and onwards are still very nice this set just isnt a good example thats all oh and i also agree with you about that police boat however the newer one in the city line is also great imo the only thing that weighs against it is the giant size which makes it feel awkward in more classic towns edited by grevious 03 august 2008  0630 pm	negative
well what to say i got this boat late 70s when we were on our way to italy to spend the holidays there my parents always needed to keep my quiet during the 3day trip and the best way to do that was to buy me a lego set i got this one in a gas station in germany as far as i remember italy didnt have lego sets so a gas station close to the italian border but still in germany or austria was very often their last chance i often saw large quantities of lego sets in those gas stations though i remember seeing yellow castle and the galaxy explorer standing on a shelf it would be my birthday 13 weeks later so i always made sure they knew what to buy for me	positive
snefroe on aug 7 2008 0753 am said my parents always needed to keep my quiet during the 3day trip and the best way to do that was to buy me a lego set this still works nowadays quote i often saw large quantities of lego sets in those gas stations though i remember seeing yellow castle and the galaxy explorer standing on a shelf these were the times although i donÂ´t recall lego sets in fuel stations in the past i would appreciate to see lego on the go now itÂ´s holiday time and i have two sons you know	positive
so youve been bitten by the classic bug too sinner great review but one would think arms would come in handy pun intended when you are a police officer right its a shame that many of the original figs must now be forced to stand looking like they have their hands in their pockets eh i have no idea where i was going with that last sentence	neutral
as you may have seen in my topic in general lego discussion i received a bunch of old lego from my stepgrandmotherinlaw among the bricks were instructions and pieces for an almost complete set 345 from 1969 i was very excited to find this out so i put it together i recently took it apart and reassembled it taking photographs along the way for the sake of eurobricks so without further ado set 345 house with car first off is the car this was still constructed in the bucket of bricks i received so i never took it apart next ill show you the instructions lots of added bricks per step which was fun however the angle of the instructions sometimes made it difficult to find where things were supposed to go the inbuild shots finally an allaround view of the finished set sadly i dont have much time to post more pictures or thoughts however ill try to come back and update the review later this week until then enjoy	positive
nice review mariko this set is way past my time the baseplate is okay though i hate those dots the car is pretty cool too	positive
great review i never had this set but it looks nice i really like the checker pattern near the big window	positive
way before my time tooin fact this set came out twenty years before i was born the baseplate doesnt actually have dotsim not sure if they were there once and then rubbed off a possibility as the studs are rather smoother than i imagine they once were or if this particular one didnt have the dots this set also shows that the difficulty lego has in doing vehicle scale isnt new the house is the perfect size for microfigures from the lego games however the car is massiveover twice as tall as a microfig	neutral
great review mariko this set is way before my time too i like how lego used to create simple one story houses instead of the really tall house that we see in todays town theme such as 8403 city house one story houses such as 345 just look more realistic to my eyes the simplistic minimalism vibe that i get with this set is something that is hard to find in todays much more detailed sets although trust me i love love love todays detailed sets  the brick is epic	positive
theres two alternates on the back of the instructions and as i recall some sort of bridge on the inner fold or back of box i threw away the box to this set years ago just lucky to still have all the pieces with standard pieces you can build all these alternates and many more thats why i dont particularly care for the new castles like vladeks they make building so difficult and duplicate pieces are so limited heres an old shot of the castle in the city that it use to guard we played for hours back in these days	neutral
great review it is nice to see an indepth photo review of this set i especially love the last picture of your old city it certainly does bring back memories	positive
yup that is very very nicei wish i had been alive back then d well ill never have a chance to own something like this so this is as close ill get to it thanks for showing me the greatness	positive
question for you guys whats the best way to clean lego i was noticing that the baseplates and gray plates to this set are very dusty and could use a good cleaning mild soap water soak is there a better way	neutral
toothbrush and mild soap  and lots of time gently scrubbing a cleaning and great review  i love that set wub wub im sorry that you seem to miss the stickers  if you find somewhere to download printable copies of them please let me know satis kimt	positive

heres a shot of a custom forestman these really work well im using just regular sticker paper how do you stick transparent plastic on top	neutral
i guess its easiest to put the entire shield on a transparent sticker and cut the edges i would also do that with the white stickers because now you can still see the gray edges of the shield perhaps you can make a bigger black or brown in the other case outline you also wouldnt be able to see if the sticker is exactly in the middle	neutral

theme hobby sets set name harleydavidson 1000cc set number 394 price new 260280  185200 euro price used 14175  10125 euro pieces 143 year of release 1976 links peeron bricklink and brickset looking at the release date of this set makes me remember the good old times when lego sets stayed in production and could be found in stores for long years yes i hear you younger fols say this meant we had less variety at the time but at least we did not have to go on a frenzy to get them all in just 1 or 2 years before they disappeared to reappear on the secondary market at crazy prices anyway i also realise this set is older than me by 5 years at least the first boxes of this set i think my parents bought it when i was something like 12 year old or even before as my father really liked the hobby set line and took any chance to get one you know for the kids when theyâ€™ll be old enough to play with themâ€¦ i am really happy my father did it too as a matter of fact this has always been one of my favourite nonminifigure scale sets i know younger eyes will look on it and wonder how we could love and enjoy a model like this so blocky and rough just remember this was the best tlg designers could do with the bricks available at the time enough about memories letâ€™s start with the review the box front the front of the box here cut and folded to save space shows the harley davidson 1000cc in all its glory upon a nice town landscape i really appreciate how tlg box designers used a real life photo of the model in a real life environment to give this hobby set a better background moreover the landscape does not distract the eye even with its lights since the focus is strongly set on the motorbike itself back and sides the back of the box shows the model on a more neutral background and from another angle we can see the stickers in place take a good look at them here because i did not apply them the right side we also see a pic of the set from the front and one with a child playing with it in this latter shot the model rests upon a nice black box with a harley davidson sign on it i frankly do not remember if this was some sort of tray or smaller box within the lego one or if it is meant for publicity only another thing we can notice on the rightmost side of the box is a white band right below the lego logo sporting the sign â€˜designed for experienced lego buildersâ€™ in various languages all in all a really well done and professional job contents inside this set includes a number of parts in mainly black white and light grey some blue and yellow add nice touches of colour to the total the partsâ€™ selection is not mindblowing as most of the pieces had been in production in these same colours for years anyway iâ€™d like to focus on a couple of details the milky white technic axles as well as the red technic bush old 2 are among my favourite parts the bushes in particular are quite useful to build more sturdy looking tubes than what can be achieved with the newer and slimmer ones it would seem that the tile pieces appeared in the â€˜without groveâ€™ version as a standard and in the â€˜with groveâ€™ version as alternates see bricklink inventory notice though that the box above and instructionsâ€™ below pictures all show the â€˜with groveâ€™ variety as said there are no recoloured parts in this set new pieces the few new molds used in this set are black and white slope inverted 45 2 x 2 old type with round bottom tube black technic brick 1 x 2 with hole type ii and red hinge plate 2 x 4 with articulated joint â€“ male and female the most interesting piece from this lot as many of you will have noticed is the technic brick 1 x 2 with hole type ii this kind of technic brick was use during 1976 and 1977 only it would seem tlg tried a new design variant which did not meet success and was later replaced with the standard bricks again nonetheless iâ€™m sure that people who own these bricks like them for the unusual design and the possibilities they offer into adding details to their creations instructions cover â€“ as usual the instructions are not organised in the form of a booklet but they consist of a folded double printed sheet the â€˜coverâ€™ shows again the same shot as the front of the box with bigger lego logo and set number and without the other additional information â€˜back coverâ€™ â€“ here we see the full name of the set harleydavidson flh 1200 this makes me wonder why is this set known as 394 harley davidson 1000cc when it is indeed a 1200cc anyway what really makes me love this page is the list of stats below the photo and in particular these two lines hp not given this calls for just one question why did harleydavidson not release this info my opinion is that since this is a motorbike built for the police they did not have permission to share the specifications on the motor which was probably customised either by harleydavidson upon request or by the police themselves â€˜random pageâ€™ â€“ as expected no callouts here but the build is pretty straight forward and does not need them apart for one passage weâ€™ll see later the colours are easy to tell apart in the end there is no dark grey in this set that could be confused with black again notice how the instructions include the â€˜with groveâ€™ tiles and not the older ones maybe this was changed during the long time this set stayed in production the â€˜last pageâ€™ shows other four models included in the hobby set line unfortunately i own only one of them the 396 thatcher perkins locomotive indeed i would have liked to have them all building start the handle bars look a bit too squared to me but itâ€™s just a minor feature and the overall shape is still good in my opinion notice the red hinge plate which will be almost totally hidden in the finished model see below and the blue tiles which work as indicators the first steps used to build the front wheel and windshield are really easy until you get to the wheel in facts the instructions do not show clearly all the pieces needed for it and i found myself with a â€˜floatingâ€™ wheel for the absence of one of the red technic bush old 2 on one side the one not visible on the instructions of course not a big deal but something that could have been done better motor and seat the second part of the build includes the motor seat and â€˜saddle bagsâ€™ the technique used for the motor or better the radiator is very clever to get the ridged feel tlg designers used 4 light grey plates stuck one on the other but not completely in contact this way the studs while keeping the plates in position keep them raised from one another at the same time the yellow round bricks add some details and colour touches to this predominantly light grey parts of the vehicle the use of the engine smooth small 1 x 2 side plates for the exhaust pipes while quite clever still looks a bit strange to me iâ€™m mostly used to see them in airplanes helicopters and spaceships â€˜saddlebagsâ€™ a simple build for one of the iconic parts of this motorcycle here you see them in place as well as get a look at the finished seat i like how lego designers managed to make its shape with just a few quite big bricks the â€˜saddle bagsâ€™ are a really nice touch and they work perfectly when compared to the original this is the rear wheel as said before only when you get to this passage in the instruction you get a real understanding of how the front wheel is supposed to be mounted as well careful readers will notice how this is not one of the original wheels in this set the original ones were mounted using the technic gear expert builder 9 tooth unfortunately i could only find one of them in my collection an itâ€™s used as the front wheel by adding the rear wheel which is shown from a better angle in the instructions we complete the model notice how the two technic bricks supporting the wheel are held in position by two 2x1 plates i think this was a bad case of â€˜building by compartmentsâ€™ mentality if tlg designers had considered this a bit more they would have used 2 4x1 plates instead of 4 2x1 on the other hand this is not the worst case i have seen in a lego set and they keep up the tradition nowadays too finished set front and here it is our fancy police harleydavidson indeed the front looks blocky and quite horrible to our eyes but again it was almost the best that could be done at the time i only wish they had made it a little less bulky even though this build is clearly thought to give better stability to the wheel the blue tiles work nicely to emphasise the indicators the slightly unsightly red plate is normally covered by the plate sticker and the windshield albeit being hard to see through is nicely shaped back the back side is less detailed than the front but shows the red light and antenna which are typical of the police motorbikes from this period how many times have we seen this angle in the chase scenes from tv shows like â€œchipsâ€ side all in all this model looks pretty sturdy apart for the antenna which falls off all too easily and detailed especially considering the limited variety of parts available and used at the time they even got so far to put a 2x2 tile as kickstand to display it without fear of it falling on the sides bonus images size comparison what i never understood about this set is what scale it is meant to be i mean it is clearly not minifigscale and it could not be technicfigscale those came later but it is not even miniland scale moreover the only other model with the same scale is the other hobby set motorbike as the cars have a scale of their own and the thatcher uses still another one final comments overall this is a great set for collectors of old models and motorbike fans or both it does not sport a huge variety of bricks but was a good choice at the time and even if the result is matteroffact blocky when compared to the original it implements some good solutions to minimise the lego brick appearance and maximise the similarity as much as possible design  colour scheme â€“ 910 the design is as accurate as possible apart for the front mudguard maybe and the colours are completely in line for a police vehicle the solutions and details included in this set justify the â€˜expert buildersâ€™ label and add to the appearance and why not playability of the model parts  810 not a huge selection and very few new molds nonetheless a good source of black and white standard parts for mocs and one of the few sources for the extra rare technic brick 1 x 2 with hole type ii pieces playability  910 a sturdy model which can take some serious play and swooshing without falling apart the easily detachable antenna and the lack of an appropriate scale interaction with most other models make it lose one point though build  710 pretty straight forward with few nice solutions and an already mentioned slightly obscure passage in the instructions price  510 like most older models especially the hobby set and model team ones this set can be found at reasonable prices only rarely most of the times people are asked shameful prices for such a smallish set overall 810 very good as always questions comments and pic requests welcome edited by whitefang 17 april 2011  0619 pm indexed	positive
great review the set is really nice i love that the front of the motercycle can turn and the engine is just beautiful with its half stacked bricks like kieldaman said the price used or new is quite a bit but there is a good variety of bricks here like the bricks inside the wheels did you get this set from your father great review luxorv	positive

luxorv this is a well written presentation on this lego vintage review i never knew the existence of this set and even though the design is not part of the modern lego design concept but the overall appeal back in the 1970s certainly appeal to many i could not mind to own such vintage lego model and put them on display and potray as if it was a chart of evolution of lego motorbikes thanks for sharing and i cant wait to find out your next review	positive

thank you very much for this wonderful review this is the oldest lego set in my collection i received this model from my grand parents many years ago  im not exactly sure who in my family it used to belong to but it has a home with me now its a very simple but attractive looking vehicle and functions pretty well too overall very nice	positive
thanks for the great nostalgic review great pictures i love the shiny glow of 37 year old bricks sets were simpler back then but not less exciting in their own way i wasnt even born in 1973 but one of my first sets was the 1982 update of this 6630 bucket loader almost 10 years later but the very same bucket assembly only the colours have changed	positive
well its not exactly a large shuttle but still a nice set 442 space shuttle year released 1979 piece count 79 minifigs 1 vehicles 0 list price unknown this little classic was my smallest classic space set believe it or not i still have the box heres the back the instructions are pretty tattered and missing a section i had to download some from the web but the ship is again intact missing only one grey 1x3 plate ive always liked this computer piece heres the under side this set included the small classic jet engines a closeup of the sloped printed space brick and the complete set with minifig this set was a great little space ship that made a nice addition to the blue space theme as small as it was it could hold twothree figs one standing up i dont even think the mars mission recon drop ship holds three figs in any case it was a musthave for blue space fans and probably only a few bucks back in the day swoosh	neutral
its simply amazing how far lego has come in 30 years	positive
this was my first space set ever 1979 1980 dont know anymore but i do remember i got this together with 897 for my birthday when we where camping with a little luck i may even have an old film from my dad opening the boxes well what to say it looked soooooo aggressive with those two engines but i never knew why you needed two steering wheels on it they probably just thought a symmetrical model was better  i cant blame them what a nice set it would even sell today no doubt looooots of swooshability	positive
indexed everyone remembers their first time for me it was in 19coughsomethingsomethingcough we were at her house and her mother was gone for at least an hour she slowly unzi uhhh sorry wrong story um yeahh anyway i do remember my first time it was 1977 in late summer our neighbor who worked for a department store called famousbahr said that the main store had a travelling lego display so my family filed into the car and drove into downtown st louis to see this display to tell you the truth i dont remember much about the display itself but i do remember that my parents bought me my first lego set set  456 the spirit of st louis set  456 also sold as set  661 name spirit of st louis theme legoland  large vehicle year 1977 pieces 49 minifigs 0 price 500 usd bricklink misb start  17500 usd used complete 3500 usd links peeron bricklink brickset packaging box front the original box that my set came in was most likely trashed 5 minutes after returning home this image was lovingly stolen off of the peeron page for this set i feel lucky that i even got this much similarly i have no pictures of the plastic baggies the set came in truth be told i cant be sure that there even were plastic baggies that the parts came in the set side view well there she is my first set ever  actually i seem to recall the real spirit of st louis was silver colored not black and yellow if you need a history lesson the spirit of st louis was charles lindberghs plane when he made the first transatlantic solo flight more details can be found on the wikipedia page the overall shape is pretty close at least the cockpit window could stand to be moved forward one stud but everything seems to be relatively close the tail piece isnt the right shape but it is likely the only tail piece lego produced at the time if you look closely you can see the various bite marks that my brother and i inflicted over the years i know some people would be aghast that there are bite marks but brick separators wouldnt come out for another 10 years besides we were young we didnt know any better i certainly had no idea that it would become my obsession there are some interesting part choices here everything is brick and plate built as you might expect the same set nowadays would have lots of slope wedges and wedge plates to round things out but lego was all about the brick in 77 so bricks are what we got the black inverted slopes worked pretty well asthetically as the wing struts the wings are simple 4 x 10 plates nice and square there were no minifigs in this set if i remember correctly 1977 was just about the time when minifigs made their first appearance i know i have one other set from 77 that does include a minifg at least i dont have a lot of comments for the following photos ill let the pictures speak for themselves 34 view back back 34 top front parts interesting pieces i have no idea if there were any extra pieces that came with this set i kind of doubt it instead i took a photo of some of the interesting parts to the model that translucent white piece didnt photograph so well but it is a technic axle 8 thats right sets from 1977 contained technic elements the two black parts are the forerunners to the 1 x 2 technic brick as well everytime i hear someone on the forums complain about technic elements in system sets i think back to this set the round brick is special as well here is a closer view of it complete with bite marks  round brick as you can see the stud is closed it is only one of two closed stud 1 x 1 round bricks that i own they stopped appearing in sets in 1981 for those that are interested the dss you thought you were going to escape this heading didnt you surprise yes even in 1977 lego sets had stickers the oldest printed elements i can remember were in the classic space sets that started in 1979 again when people in the forums complain about dss in sets i can only help think of this set and chuckle to myself maniacally the sticker has held up really well considering its been stuck on the brick for 32 years no discoloration very little curling i think if all stickers held up this well over time there would be less dss complaints the ratings playability 610  the set is quite swooshable and the propellor spins outside of that though minifigs na design 610  the overall shape is quite good especially given the era the color choice leaves a lot to be desired price 110  its been retired for 30 years its going to cost you to get your hands on it overall 1330  this set is for true collectors only i cant imagine anyone wanting one because they want to play with it it was a great set back in the day but the design feels really dated and if youre wondering mine is not for sale ever all the photos plus more can be found in the gallery	neutral
great job i love reading vintage reviews as it reminds of our childhood days glad to see this in very good condition by the way i will move this to lego trains  town to see if thebrickster will like to include this set inside the review index over there i believe he is maintaining vintage town set reviews over there and this suits there well	positive
im sorry you had to move this topic white fang when it was in the reviewers academy the teachers agreed it belonged in other themes shrug i guess it ended up where it belonged eventually	neutral
great review its good to see some of the old sets reviewed i think i learned something about the history of lego from this one	neutral
fantastic review iÂ´d love to read more like this trivia about oldrare pieces is almost as fun as the set itself	neutral
outstanding review of a very special set i actually remember seeing this set on the store shelves of local department stores can you believe it fantastic review walter i really enjoy looking at these vintage sets this one deserves a blog	positive
in 1977 trans or yellow slopes existed already and using them would have made the plane more realistic a third rear wheel would have enhanced playability and design rather than this ugly black round brick its the reason why i voted below average even considering 1977s standards however this set is nice and simple offering good playability	negative
here is the spirit of st louis just go there washington and have a look of this legend  cavannus on jul 15 2009 0940 pm said in 1977 trans or yellow slopes existed already and using them would have made the plane more realistic i dont think so there is no 45Â° slope in the original plane design  and no front cockpit window quote a third rear wheel would have enhanced playability and design rather than this ugly black round brick except that it wouldnt have been the spirit of st louis this set is a great one and i wish id bought it in 77 it is the spirit of the 70ties 	positive
daoudbazaar on jul 15 2009 0526 pm said  there is no 45Â° slope in the original plane design  and no front cockpit window  except that it wouldnt have been the spirit of st louis oooops youre completely right the spirit of stlouis didnt have any front window nor rear wheel anyway i think a standard ryan m1m2 plane would have been a better choice less a legend but more a flexible plan for multiple uses	negative
i really like the design it has an aesthetic value lacking from most official lego planes and follows closely to the real thing minus the colours something that cant really be claimed for more recent sets	positive
483 alpha1 rocket base year released 1979 piece count 170 minifigs 3 vehicles 1 two sections list price unknown despite the nuclear nonproliferation treaty of 1968 lego dared design a rocket base complete with a rocket system that may have had nuclear capability in 1979 luckily the rocket was defective having rather flimsy white bricks that did not stay together well during launch attempts lego scrapped its wmd program and the result was this classic blue era space set known as the alpha1 rocket base instructions on the backside of the instructions the set is featured with the space command center space cruiser and a few vehicle sets the set includes three figs and this great rocket fuel tanker heres the front section complete with computer and the rocket fuel section the set has some interesting features including the control section fuel control and launch pad on top of the control section is a nicely design radartracking system heres the open control room the launch pad and fuel control the fuel control includes two sink pieces and blue steering wheels and legos wmd weapon of mass destruction the alpha1 on the launch pad heres a shot of the launching mechanism unfortunately i have lost one of the blue sinkfaucet pieces as well as a black hose a closeup of the alpha1 rocket the white bricks never stayed together well often times coming apart within your hands the arming and guidance system was nicely designed a view of the complete set and another this is a great set the base fuel vehicle and launch platform offers a great amount of playability my only complaint is the rocket as mentioned above i dont think i ever played with it a sa kid because it always fell apart share your comments regarding this classic space set	positive
i always thought that that grey thing on top of the rocket was some kind of satelite xenologer on jul 4 2008 0525 am said huh did they not think of putting a technic axle down the center of the rocket come to think of it when were technic axles invented i had this set as a kid and i dont think there was a technic axle inside that rocket but if i remember correctly some of the later cs rockets did	neutral
im loving that transyellow plate on top of the roof great review	positive
wooow what a set not all that large most defenitely not as sophisticated as the message intercept base from 10 years later but in those this was all a kid need to have hours of fun soooo many great parts on this one technic hoses computers rocket parts trans yellow parts the perfect outpst really it was actually my sister who got this one but it only took an hour before i claimed it edited by snefroe 14 july 2008  1236 pm	positive

hey ebers i got my market street on monday and finished building it last night i know its not such a nice review like yoda did the last times but i hope you enjoy some of the pics first a pic of the complete building the 3 minifigs and i pic of the stairs one of my highlights at this set more pics you can find here my opinion about the set i like this set very much it was really fun to build it im happy that that i got some more cherries and a croissant now sweet  a funny idea is the salad in the one box at the front i think normally its a hairpiece of an exoforce fig i also like the colours of the house the dark blue is sooooo nice i think i have to take more of this soon the lighter blue is also nice this set has really nice details like the stairs or the owl at the entry of the market or the balcony i paid 8999 eur a fair price for a really nice set greetings sandra	positive
thanks for the review my favourite detail is the salad d btw could you exchange the modules and make pics of that id like to see how the building looks with the flat roof instead of the dutch style one im not sure though if the vents on the flat roof makes sense as long as its only used as a garage top  maybe they should be removable as the balconies and such things to make the modularity leading not to weird results other than this in combination with a lot of money and the cafe corner set this really could get me into city 	positive
thanks for the great review sweet now that ive seen the set im afraid im a bit disappointed 8 1 the color combination doesnt really do it for me blue dark blue grey black tan white theyre all mixed together without any over all design 2 is there any interior it doesnt look like it and in any case you can only reach it if you remove the modules hm  now it looks too much of a box 3 there are most certainly some nice ideas in this model and some great parts the best part of the model is the staircase 4 i dont think he spent much time in thinking about the design as apo said the chimneys on top of a garage is kinda weird theres also a gate next to another gate which is weird as well also if this is supposed to ba a grocery then the owner has done a lot to hide it the croissant is nice but next to the brown box with vegies theres nothing that suggests this is a shop 5 the white lamp and the the yellow cylinder are at the same level of the tiles imo it should be above the level of the tiles 6 imo not worth the 90 euro edited by snefroe1 20 june 2007  0903 am	negative
thanks i love the look of this set i love the mix of colours it breaks up the model rather than being a single monotone colour hes used several complimentary colours in order to make up the model i agree i think the chimneys on the flat roof is weird ontop of the garage but not so weird one you place it ontop of the building i guess hes done it to give us the choice of roofs and chimneys you can always remove the ones you dont like he also seems to have screwed up a bit on the tiling for the sidewalk on the side module on cafe corner and the building module of this set the sidewalk has the pattern light grey 1x6 at the front then dark grey 1x2 next then dark grey 2x2s however on this hes put the 2x2 tiles first then the 1x2s at the back easilly fixable though overall i love this set thanks for the pics compliments cafe corner perfectly	positive

im not much of a city fan but this looks great i guess this is the closest we can get to legoland miniland quality sets and considering this is a three floro small structure and its over 1000 parts just imagine pun not intended how many peices are in ll californias empire state building or wtc freedom tower models both are large and in real scale over 100 floors thats a lot of bricks anyways ive got a friend who loves city im sure this one would make a great addition to his town setup gotta tell him about this new set y	positive
legocastlegirl on jun 20 2007 0742 am said i know its not such a nice review like yoda did the last times but i hope you enjoy some of the pics nonsense sandra  tks for sharing these cool pics  its also a nice hommage to erik brok i really like this set i think its really well designed with great ideas such as the dual stairs the balconies the croissant insignia the market entrance design with the horns whip and owl 8 i like the color combination and the mosaic design just in front of the entrance the only terrible flaw is that yellow cinlinder  that is just awful for a flower pot x i dont mind at all having that lamp post at the same level since it would be normal to have the base of the lamp at the level of the tile but i agree that is just pickering about an insignificant detail p legocastlegirl on jun 20 2007 0742 am said a funny idea is the salad in the one box at the front i think normally its a hairpiece of an exoforce fig yeay that is just brilliant all the way 8 this is a great set indeed and a must have for town fans  yoda	positive

well now that i have some money a trip to toysrus was obviously in my future especially since my local tru has much of the summer 2007 lineup when i got there almost all the smaller castle sets had been sold out but there was one left the one i am now reviewing for both eurobricks and bzpower  the box well for starters the castle theme boxes are beautiful the blended clear and stormy skies give a great clash of the titans effect and the action poses help as well  the back is equally nice featuring a photo showing kids how to use the crossbow and the brave axe wielder taking a swipe at the skeleton foolish soldier that wont work on skellies see later on in the review to find out why and of course we have a small box with the link to the official lego website where tlc can advertise even more lego sets p the contents after opening the box a single bag of pieces with a couple loose ones the instruction manual and necessary catalog  p  and a new wider rubber band holder spilt out the instruction manual is clear as a bell no color trouble here folks also its worth mentioning the nice background with the mountain and kings castle silhouettes  sorry that theres no picture but ill take one if someone wants to see it  the pieces for being a 5 dollar set well seven in my case darn your above average prices tru crossbow attack features a lot of nice pieces as does the entire castle lineup notable elements include two large brown spoked wheels two brown modified 1x1s a pearl gold slope end and six dark blue modified 1x1x23 slopes the bulk of the pieces however are nothing special ill let the picture do the talking for this the accessories are by far the best parts in this kit two different helmets in a beautiful shiny silver are my favorite but i also really like the scythe looks good for mocing and the round shield  wub  which are both brand new parts and can anyone not love the classic axe and crossbows oh and theres a black lightsaber too but thats rather boring compared to the other parts p the minifigures can you say four figures including the horse that has to be a record for a regular 5 dollar set at least in the present age of limited figures per set well start out with the two crown militia a regular soldier and an archer both have old faces but they look spiffy with the shiny helmets and the superb torsos ill name the soldier bravo the stout and the archer angler the precise for future references now we come to the skellie although some people dislike the new skeleton design i personally prefer it to the old ones since the arms are now poseable and the face much meaner the only problem is that the arms hang too low but its not too noticeable when they have weapons in their hands and last but not least heres the elusive skeleton horse i for one am very happy that tlc took advantage of that awesome prototype piece and made it into an official massproduction mold however the horse is unfortunately one piece but since regular lego horses are as well i dont have a problem with it i do have a problem with the pose however the legs are in quite an odd position and i wonder why tlc didnt make the front and back leg poses symmetrical ah well the finished set i have only two pictures here since this set is so small first heres the completed crossbow i must say finally no more ridiculous horse mounted catapults or crazy fire wheel launchers now we have realistic siege weapons including the one included with 7090 plus it actually launches okay although not the best heres the other main attraction the completed skeleton rider and horse i think its rather dramatic with that pose and the dark background dont you think  playability okay so theres not much in this set but a bit of imagination brings plenty of possibilities to show you what you can do heres a little story made only with this set  overall rating presentation 910 pieces 810 minifigures 910 finished model 810 playability 810  final score 8410 crossbow attack is a fine introduction into castle so i recommend it to any lego fan whether they are a castle nut or just want a cheap change of pace tlc has a knack with making great small kits these days and i more than ever support them in their amazing rebound from their dark ages between 1997 and 2004  edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0133 pm	positive
thanks for this review and that great little comic about the skellies though xd you have to admit that besides their long arms making the skellie legs look out of proportion that theyre just made poorly theyre sticking straight out as opposed to every other fig which have a slight bend to make them look more natural also as im sure youve noticed the pegs are on angles that makes it impossible for them to hold their weapons straight and they cant even put their arms over their heads without stressing the plastic some i mean theyre dead well at least undead theyre not supposed to be stiff and personally i like the ragdoll look more it makes them seem more dead p	negative

nice review and great little story d y look at the normal horses their legs are positioned like that too only the skellie horses legs are touching so as to strengthen the middle otherwise it could easily snap in half also i think the new skeletons are nice their head is awesome i just dont see why tlc couldnt make the bent droid arms with the hand facing vertically instead of making a new arm design completely straight	positive
nice review and a great story also grevious this is a great set and a nice little army builder one at that the only thing that saddens me about the line itself is the new arms on the skelies they just look far to big when placed next to a normal fig for me the old versions of the skelies were far better why tlc changed to this is beyond me still i shall be buying alot of these sets just to increase my army	positive

here is a review of the new monster dino creator set with power functions first lets start with the box which is much larger than it needs to be it is one of the new style recloseable boxes rather than the rip the sides style this set is typical of creator and comes with three sets of instructions the monster dino a kind of spider and a crocodile the set comes with two of the new motors one small and one large a sound module plus the new ir controler and receiver there is a mix of techniques in this set the core is mainly studless technic there are some studded technic parts and most of the details are standard creator style there are two mechanisms one to control the legs and one to control the head and arms the leg drive is from the large motor and the arm and head are operated from the small motor the completed mechanism will stand on its own without any detail added the detail is added to the base unit to complete the model the operation of the dino is very good the design for the motors and drives is very compact and well thought out the walking motion works well although there is no steering and it will fall over it it encounters obstacles the sound module is built into the head so when the mouth opens the dino roars sort of glyman made the comment that this set is ugly as sin and i tend to agree i think there are too many colour variations with different shades of grey black and that lime green p which confuses the look of the finished model but i guess it might apeal more to younger kids i also do not like the spikes along the back which glow in the dark because the are loose and keep falling off this set is not cheap at 70 but i guess this is because of the motors and ir controller while on this i was surprised how good the range was on the new controller it would still operate ever when not in direct line of sight i would give this set a 1010 for playabilityit has kept the kid amused for hours i would give it 610 for value for money it is a bit pricey overall 810 it took approx 3 hours to build and has been well played with i have posted some more images and some videos of the finished models on my brickshelf page here if you have any questions please ask pete edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0628 pm indexed	positive
thanks for your review ickelpete y nice little movie you made whats on tv in the background  d after reading i wonder more than before what this dino has to do with creator wacko the complete mechanism is technic only the designpieces on top are classicstyle i agree with your comment on the colourselection x is that turquise next to lime looks like  well im not telling you what i think of right now  pretty lego set but not for me im waiting for the first pics of the ferris wheel or even better the 8275 technicbulldozer  wub new motors on	positive
thank you very much for that interesting review ickelpete y well the color schemes pretty bad and the design of that dinos a bit to blocky for my liking but the two alternative models youve builtre quiet nice at least therere a lot of possibilities coming with that set 	neutral
tks a lot for your review ickelpete  i saw that set at tru a couple of weeks ago but was really not interested due to the design  i am not a fan of those motorized lego sets  i guess the lime colour is to please kids as well as the general design far from a real dino  i am sure that its going to sell well to a younger croud let me quote you here quote the walking motion works well although there is no steering and it will fall over it it encounters obstacles hum i really hope it works welll because i will have to buy that motorized atat and i dont want it to crash p yoda	neutral

 such a beauty the functions are great cool video i want to get this set so badly great review y	positive
the box is has really strange dimensions  its very flat but has a large front  the 11 scale regarding the spines because theyre made of the softer nonabs plastic the stuff the 1994 cutlasses and brown muskets were made of they lose their shape a bit and so are hard to grip they simply fall off i suppose tlc use loads of different colours because a single or twocolour dino isnt very nice to look at especially when the surface isnt very smooth  it takes your eyes away from the surface and puts it on the colours someone should make an all terrain dino that can walk everywhere from this set  i dont have the skill with technic  i always end up layering and never finish any models 	negative
thanks for the nice review its butt ugly to me but the motors  ir control seem pretty neat  even at that high price it looks like a good parts pack  sweet	positive

got this baby via shophome a little early and i though it was time to post my view of this set  snefroe you need to get this one   sorry for the lack of pics but there are already many pics online of this baby so here it is  best space set since a way too long time this is my first new space themed set since more than 20 years and i must say that i’m not disappointed at all i have much to say about this little gem first let’s cut it straight about the martians minifigures they are absolutely rubbish i can’t imagine how lego could produce such atrocity this said let’s move on to the dropship a real piece of art reminiscent of the aliens movie dropship the cockpit is spacious and provides a great field of view too bad there is no hinges to open it you must remove the canopy completely to switch pilot the drilling unit can be attached under the ship with the clever use of a rubber piece it stays well in place once attached good point some people don’t like the inclusion of the 2 containment area for the martians and crystal on both side of the ship but i kind like it it makes the ship less empty the 2 wings are complete with air intake some armaments and 1 standard launcher on the right wing normally i don’t like launchers but this one is very discrete and well integrated on the tail section are 2 thrusters that can be rotated and provide thus some “realistic” movements to the ship one of the last highlight of this ship is the landing gears or i must say landing dishes 6 medium sized radar dishes provide and incredible stability to the set they are quite sturdy and can take a beating i’m not going to review the alien spaceship in detail since it’s quite uninteresting i consider it more like a bonus addition to the set than anything else the look is passable and there are some interesting building techniques in it that’s all to end the review a little proscons table we all love proscons table   pros  incredible design  at last a decent space set  modular functions  quite sturdy  beautiful  great value for money cons  martians are rubbish  no hinges for the canopy  the drilling unit could use some more details score 910 by the way  i added a nice cool feature on my site  you can download the stickers for some sets that i own before building i always scan the stickers we never know it could come handy check this out on my site you need to go in the lego lists on the left vtx classic games	positive

great review i must admit i didnt like mm at first site but seeing this review and looking at the mm boxes at stores appeal to me rather greatly i may get a couple of these sets great job y 	positive
the dropships looks neat and your review is good it isnt my theme but it clearly is a fantastic set for the space lovers under us mars mission is really a good step in the right direction for tlc	positive
a very nice review thanks dunamis y i really dont understand that color scheme but the new motorsre very interesting well that dino is just mediocre to me i think that the new technic bulldozer is much more interesting	neutral
great review dunamis i hope you have as much fun with this as i have one point yes they are new axles they have appeared in a few sets this year	positive
ickelpete on jul 13 2007 1106 pm said great review dunamis i hope you have as much fun with this as i have one point yes they are new axles they have appeared in a few sets this year yes the kids seem to love it as you pointed out and the wife still thinks i am crazy so its all good i read your review after i posted mine seems like we shared the same thoughts on a majority of it i always think it is good to have multiple opinions on sets as it gives the community more data points to evaluate a given set	positive
thanks for the bonus review i am still on the fence with this one so every opinion is good dunamis on jul 14 2007 0741 am said but what about the atat in case you dont know the atat in the dark side development kit had a single motor and a moving head it worked by the head simply swinging from side to side due to balence shifts i suspect the atat will be same i also think that there will be no remote for it either edited by sinner 14 july 2007  1131 am	positive

oh is he ugly or what ive never seen a dino that needed to go on a diet more then him d but id get him for the pieces all those limegreen pieces drools but meh im not really in to mindstorms so i dont think id get this but anyway nice review i now know exactly what hes like kml	negative
awesome reveiw thanks i gotta get this one y wub	positive
i kind of like the design of this but more importantly i really want to get my hands on the power functions motors and ir control system id prefer the 8275 technic bulldozer but theres no way i can stretch to the 100 price tag so i was thinking i would have to see if i could get a 4958 monster dino cheap in the january sales then two things happened today firstly i saw the dino in tescos reduced from 70 to 55 then my wife said shed buy it for me for christmas wow thats never happened to me before i love my wife wub cant wait till christmas now	positive

i ended up buying a misb set recently from a lego collector who is clearing up his collection excellent set to get the ir remote and ir receiver and other motors without paying insane amounts for the bulldozer now there is a quite a number of parts in power miner lime green and 1x1 white teeth plate for the mouth and claws the dino alone has 20 teeth in its mouth the glow in the dark antennas on the backbone of the dino is a nice touch as you can let him walk in the dark somewhat i do agree with the reviewer the box is insanely huge i dont think lego wanted to show a 11 scale dino they just wanted to promote the power function stuff as large as possible also the remote is smaller than shown in the picture as the hand holding it i think is smaller	positive
this is both my first set review and post about a star wars set even though i have been collecting them since 99 i got this one early this year so i thought i would post a review on it please bare with me i am not a great photographer so with that in mind here goes front of the box 75083 atdp boxfront by whitesidewjw on flickr back of the box 75083 atdp box back by whitesidewjw on flickr shot of the bags 75083 atdp bags by whitesidewjw on flickr the sticker sheet i normally dont apply them but for this i am going ahead and putting them on 75083 atdp sticker sheet by whitesidewjw on flickr minifigs i really like the two atdp pilots but the best agent kallus really does shine of course we get an extra stormtrooper 75083 atdp minifigs by whitesidewjw on flickr no new molds in this as far as i can tell however these printed 4x4 domes are really great i can see lots of uses for these in space mocs 75083 atdp new printed elements by whitesidewjw on flickr bag1 complete nothing earth shattering here an easy build 75083 atdp bag 1 complete by whitesidewjw on flickr bag 2 complete 75083 atdp bag 2 complete cockpit seats by whitesidewjw on flickr cockpit assembly 75083 atdp cockpit assembly by whitesidewjw on flickr bag 2 complete 75083 atdp bag3 complete by whitesidewjw on flickr foot assembly i like how they positioned the slopes 75083 atdp foot assembly by whitesidewjw on flickr complete atdp 75083 atdp complete by whitesidewjw on flickr complete atdpside view 75083 atdp side view complete by whitesidewjw on flickr complete atdp over view 75083 atdp complete overview by whitesidewjw on flickr complete atdp rear view 75083 atdp rear view by whitesidewjw on flickr extra pieces 75083 atdp extra pieces by whitesidewjw on flickr the verdict minifigs 55 we get a total of four figs i like the two atdp pilots and agent kallus is a well done minifig i can complain about another storm trooper either parts 35 other than the dome pieces i commented on before there is really not any new parts in this if you build space star wars or machinery this will still be a welcome assortment experience of build 45 this really was a fun build it came together fast but was challenging enough for its target age group playability 55 this thing is much more sturdy than it looks the legs take a little bit of effort due to the double locking hinges but hold together very wellthis is a very minor complaint value 45 typical 4999 for 500 pieces i must admit i paid a little more than msrp due to shipping but i cant complain about the value overall 2125 i really believe this is one of the best walkers that lego has designed the only changes i would make would be adding real control panels in the cockpit and it would be nice if lego made a real widow to fit in with these types of builds rather than a transparent tile over another plate all in all i would recommend this set and i hope the rest of the 2015 star wars sets are on par with this	positive
thanks for the early review i dont know much about the rebals show at all but i can say that the over all design of the walker really appeals to me and the minifigs look top notch i also like how the spring shooters are pretty much hidden in the frame nice job	positive
looks really nice one complaint is the back it is a pitty that lego didnt use any plates greebling there	negative
great review thanks for doing it im a big fan of this set the minifigures are good as is the parts selection i like the piece used in the cockpit to secure the minifigure in place i wouldve liked to see some panels in the cockpit though rather than translucent red pieces that said however they are useful pieces	positive
thanks for the review cannot wait for the 2015 sets	positive
pretty good first review this looks pretty great i probably wont be getting it due to budget constraints bionicle but still very nice set to me it kinda looks like the missing link between when the atst evolved into the atat also i know the rebels stormtroopers get a lot of hate but i really like them thanks for the review	positive
thanks for the review i have two questions  what is the driver standing on when the hatch is open and he is looking out  could you show the face of kallus without helmet please my only complaint is that the colours of both kalluss and the driverss uniforms are wrong kalluss uniform is way too dark and should be more dark olive than black and the driverss uniforms are too bright and should be more greyish compared to what we saw in the series	neutral
whats behind the printed 4x4 dome is that 2x4 yellow plate im planning to replace that	neutral
great first review as a huge walker fan its great to get one thats not a redesign or one of those tiny battlepack vechicles	positive

smitty500 on 25 december 2014  0721 am said awesome i am really looking forward to buy this but is it really 5000 us i was hoping more around 3000 i mean it fits the 10 cents per piece count and has 4 figures so for a licensed theme you cant beat that but i guess lego can never satisfy everyone	neutral
whitswj on 24 december 2014  0253 pm said here are the pics of kallus his head would be good for a steampunk character thanks indeed his face printing is really nice they captured his looks and spirit well	positive
great set really impressed odd that lego didnt include stickers for the controls  cant think of a reason they wouldnt have and why do only 3 of the 4 figures have leg printing i just cant understand lego at times	neutral
i built this set and i think the two rubber pieces holding the both sides of the face is a bit stretched out therefore making the set somewhat tight for entire top hatch to open and close does anyone have the same situation is this right  never mind i got it i built the back a stud too long edited by namioik 29 december 2014  0304 am	neutral
thanks for the early review how tall is this next to the most recent recreation of the atat im picturing the two of them standing next to each other looking silly due to the scale differences	neutral
great reveiw shame on lego for forgetting that they already made a atdp pilot helmet ezras from the phantom set that didnt resort to needing a printed head	negative
its a different helmet ezras is an imperial cadet helmet the same one he wears in breaking ranks	neutral
thanks for the review and pics this is a really nice looking walker one question  how snug are the atdp drivers sitting in their seats the cockpit looks good actually im not crazy about the atdp helmets on the show but i dig the minifigs good stuff awesome facial hair for kallus	neutral

hi i need some helpwhen i atach the pod to the place where the legs are placed the small piece that unites the pod to the legs is loos from the bottom so the top of the walker just moves around freely wich is different from every video review that i have seen where they can rotate the pod but its not loose the small piece that serves as the axis isnt staying locked on the bottom piece and i have reassembled it all and still its the same  help edit sorry i found out what went wrongdidnt push hard enough d edited by mrpinache 05 july 2015  1210 am	neutral
super outstanding review i am outside at this moment and this review is certainly great to read while you are on the move i am looking forward to get this upcoming new modular it is definitely fun to play and real awesome indeed thanks oky for this very fine review	positive
i want more of the story you made also ace review	positive
brilliant review and thanks for plenty of detailed shots of the interior i may invest in this set but ill have to wait until 2015 star wars is sorted and budget for the arrival of pirates in april	positive
how was the pool table legs made	neutral
firstly great review  i was really on the fence on this one this review has greatly changed my view on this modular a definite buy for me love the interiors and the whole concept the more i see it the more i see the little features which put this set apart or at least slightly different from the others of course great playability for the younger lot and i think a nice building to give any lego city more character and colour	positive
great review oky i really love your introduction text you put a lot of effort in this review with lots of nice touches well done for me the set gets 4 out of 5 its a great set but theres something preventing me of giving it 5 stars	positive
wow that is the best start to a review i have ever seen great job oky amazing set ill be picking it up this weekend	positive
great review oky i managed to pick this set up a few days ago and i must say it might be my favorite modular yet for the feel alone the pool hall barbershop and the detectives office itself are all wonderfully designed	positive
can you please take some picturesexplain how the water tower is built i understand that there are some tank treads bot how exactly and it is there can be only one edited by yooha 01 january 2015  0714 pm	neutral
looking forward to picking up this set on saturday  nice review love the tiny details and the printed parts	positive
great review the intro was great but im still not convinced on this one the height seems too small for comparison with the rest of the modulars the play features are ok but i wish it would have been taller	negative
thank you for the great review of this set im also curious for the backside of the mirror	neutral
snaplock on 01 january 2015  0740 pm said totally agree with you the height does seem rather small also 2x buildings on a 32x32 baseplate with a lots of spare studs behind the buildings are these buildings 12 studs in width it still looks great style wise however this might be a set i buy and look at it after i have built it  regret the amount of  i have spent on it 239 for us aussies  both are are 14 deep on the upper floors do is 3 studs deeper on the ground floor buit thats pretty much it cant believe how cramped the upper floors of the barber shop look weve come a long way from the wide and empty halls of cc and gg	neutral
amazing review very thorough with lots of details	positive
thanks for the review im a fan of the set but will be modding quite a bit have to get a small bar into the highlander and then turn the secondthird story above the barber shop into a proper apartment the detectives office is great and will stay as is	positive
thank you for the amazing and really wellreadable review makes me want to get the set even more	positive
awesome review and an awesome set what are the different shades of blue i know theres dark and medium blue but whats the other blue locutis	positive
awesome review okythanks for the cool writing and excellent photographyyour last photo could of had a cry ofyoull never take our candy well he does look mel gibson like  this set is a serious contender for best set for 2015 so much detail must buy one need to brainwash wife into buying me one 	positive
thanks very much i love it wub  it needs tweaking but isnt that half the fun incidentally when people were calling it rhino i thought it was just a reference to captain scarlet seeing the stickers in the middle made me realise my mistake buy buy buy	positive
natelite on jul 15 2007 1220 pm said seems like they infuse system sets with more technic bars must be that technic isnt selling too well and they want to educate ppl how cool technic can be p its quite apparent when even the small bike needed technic frame my guess its less expensive and complicated to produce theyre also using these parts in other themes so in the end theyre producing a smaller catalog of bricks but every part gets produced in larger quantities	neutral
wow this year my wallet size has been bugging me sigh still its a goodlooking set and i will get it too many big sets	positive
this is a great review and so is the set y i thought i would buy it but when i saw the price i changed my mind xd i always liked flying things better though like the dropship although that is a bit pricey too i guess xd	neutral
this set is truely incredible a must have but this set is also incredibly overpriced n  com on its only a big vehicle  nothing really special to justify the near 100 price tag this set is clearly worth something like 65 at max look at the incredible dropship for 34 thats a good value for money y edited by mutex 15 july 2007  0457 pm	neutral

i echo the consensus of this thread  too much technic looks great too expensive looks great	neutral

sinner on jul 15 2007 0102 pm said incidentally when people were calling it rhino i thought it was just a reference to captain scarlet yeah me too thats a great programme is it not and i mean both new and old anyway i like this ill probably get it when it finally becomes available in the uk i think theres a few things ill mod but overall its very nice although its interesting and slightly creepy how much the lights at the front look like eyes and as ive said many a time before i love the motorbike edited by brainbox 16 july 2007  0111 pm	positive

8 such a wonderful machine great review too bad all my money is going towards the castle theme  my wallet is planning to kill me	positive
the life on mars theme was so much better with the aliens dominating mars instead of the humans and the aliens were so much better with their own names etc good times anyway i think this is the best set in the series it looks so neat and reminds me of the pelican form halo xd edited by iamded 31 august 2007  0511 am	positive
i think the life on mars series was great although i didnt click until the line was gone that the red hangar on the alien base was for the red mech and same with the blue one man i was gutted when i realised that i want those mechs however the base was great with the small mech and the flying crafts could the lom mechs have been the spark of life for exoforce 8 edited by iamded 31 august 2007  0515 am	positive
lego 41062 elsas sparkling ice castle lego managed to get a frozen licensed set in the new wave of disney princess sets however im very surprised by the size its a 40 set and comes in a small friendsstyle box roughly 12x12 size  i almost didnt see it on the shelf when i was looking for it because its so small i mean i know its only 40 but its a friggin castle and why did lego only make this a smaller set if theyd made a 200 frozen castle they still would have sold every one they could produce they made big harry potter hogwarts sets and those sure sold and have you seen the toys in the frozen section of stores huge playsets for barbiesized dolls but i suppose im getting the cart before the horse here reviewing before ive even opened the box so name elsas sparkling ice castle set number 41062 pieces 292 price 3999 minifigs 3 theme disney princess year of release 2015 links bricklink peeron brickset the box the front of the box is standard lego fare other than the large anna and elsa in the bottom right corner oh and surprisingly nowhere on the box is the normal minifig lineup the only way to know what characters are included is to look at the set pictures the 11 this set uses one of the minidolls as the actual size sample thats probably not a bad choice since the minidolls are not nearly as well known as a minifig the back on the back the play features are shown in insets around a rear view of the castle like friends sets you also have an array of play accessories the seals is this standard on 2015 sets or is this specific to this set ive never seen 3 tape seals on a set even huge modulars or technic sets only have 2 so 3 on a set this small seems excessive perhaps lego expects people to try to steal the dolls if so why bother with extra tape a tiny pocketknife makes quick work of the tape so the third strip doesnt even slow you down the contents in the box are 2 instruction booklets bent a white plate a sticker sheet and 3 numbered bags of parts the stickers these are very hard to photograph since theyre shiny i mean polished chrome shiny those dark lines across the corners are not really there theyre reflections of my ceiling the manual backs the back of one booklet has a friends win girl the other has an ad for the lego disney princess website that site is so girly theres even sparkles following your mouse cursor around so i didnt stay too long or look too deeply the sample page the interior pages of the manuals are on lavender backgrounds its standard lego instructions with part callouts and insets when needed the build 1 the first thing you build is anna but im not showing that yet then you build this little picnic scene its tiny but effective and nice to have something not icy in the set since the movie has the in summer song for olaf im curious whats in that sandwich though  green and pink after the picnic is the olaf build but ill save him for later too the build 2 next is this small sleigh it has an amazing amount of style for something so small the curved front and decorative whips on the back make it look sleighlike instead of blocky but come on it already had pink accents are the pink flowers really necessary technically yes so the whips can mount to them but still its just overgirly for my taste the build 3 the sleigh needs a ramp to help it rocket along for a couple inches at least the ramp starts like this with a hidden lime green jumper plate that gets a cookie on it i couldnt remember anything in the movie like that so i asked my wife and she couldnt either a hidden cookie under a hill the build 4 after putting the tilting 2x8 onto the base and adding decorations this is the result a lime green bucket holding a pair of ice skates a flower in the snow really green and white round studs that i assume are supposed to be grass and snow the build 5 the sleigh looks huge sitting on top of the tiny hill but it actually works pretty well assuming youre on a smooth surface like a table you can give the sleigh a little nudge and itll shoot down the ramp and a few inches across the table the unevenness of the slopes vs the blue tiles holds the sleigh in line well and the bumps in the slopes dont seem to hamper anything the build 6 moving on to bag 2 man thats a lot of colors in this base already and im already starting to feel like theres transblue cheese thrown around randomly the build 7 continuing and rotating some steps and even more colors thrown in magenta in elsas ice palace i sure dont remember any of that the build 8 wait seriously an ice cream stand in the castle that is what the magenta is for i kinda actually like the looks of it but it doesnt fit the set the build 9 spinning back around now theres a light aqua spiral staircase added along with a roof this is where im really starting to wonder about legos thinking those light aqua stairs and the light aqua 1x4 tiles are exclusive to this set as far as i know its possible some other 2015 sets use them but nothing in bricklink yet seems expensive to produce to me when theres no huge reason to need them another blue for the tiles would have been fine and the spiral stairs really elsas castle is known for staircases but not spiral ones there should be a huge straight ice stairway out front or sweeping curved stairs inside but not a spiral the build 10 and now we finish the tree again why where is there a tree next to elsas castle and so weird with ice hanging from green branches that have both snow and flowers on them huh did lego watch a different movie the translight blue bits before looking at the upper level a brief pause to look at some other parts heres the 1x2x5 brick in translight blue and the 2x4x6 rock panel in glitter translight blue do those look like the same blue to you and again another unique part for this set why do those rock panels need to be glitter when lego made the same panel in trans light blue in 2013 and 2014 for superheroes friends and chima sets apparently disney really wanted glitter because there are a bunch of transglitter parts in the new princess sets theres transneon green cones for jasmine ariel jasmine and sleeping beauty all get glitter trans purple cones so theres a bunch of new glitter parts for 2015 the build 11 back to building  time to add the upper level we get a bedroom with a decent bed although stickered the build 12 the other side of the bedroom has some little accessories perfume and a crown i assume the build 13 time for walls and a roof i like the small white macaroni bricks for a wall but whats with the lavender fence piece in the center ill grant that it looks nice a common white fence would have been a little boring but its another unique piece to this set the build 14 the very top of the castle is built separately not a whole lot to say here other than why is there a torch in an ice castle the finished castle once the roof is put on the castle is done and that big purple star on top says everything to me about the styling it just doesnt look like modern lego to me it looks like this should be an old belville fairy tale set from around 1999 if i saw a photo of just the castle with no figs or picnic blanket id assume thats what it was the oops not actually done yet accessories at the end theres a few bits left to add there are these dark purple skis yup another unique part in the lower level let me tell you theyre a pain to get into that location at least with my big man hands more accessories the top level gets a stickered book the sticker has a nice castle image on it that is while not quite exactly the castle from disney world very disneylooking i actually had to google and see if thats the castle they use in their logo nope but its the same style the leftovers there are a lot of extra parts in this thats almost 10 of the part count in the set right there they are pretty useful overall though its great to have an extra carrot and brown branch for olaf since you know those will get lost as hes played with the figs finally the reason for the set lets face it the castle set is just an excuse to make these figures and theyre great i mean just fantastic the print on them is just such a good match to the real characters compare to the cartoon version from the front of the box elsas hair is a little darker than the cartoon but overall these are just dead on if i had to pick out a flaw its the spell elsa is holding its too bad she can only shoot it forward with her arm down like that itd be nice to have the end of the splash part bent 90 degrees so she can have her arm forward and the spell shooting forward too oh one other thing the minidoll heads dont press down tight to the body like minifig heads do theres still exposed neck it looks nice but it means elsas cape can swing around the fig backs elsas cape is glittery on the back and you can see the removable bow in her hair the full set one final issue when you put anna on the sleigh her cape doesnt have enough flexibility since its a wraparound kind and so it folds out funny thats why on the back of the box it shows her standing on the back of the sleigh with elsa in the seat edit how on earth did i forget to comment on those orange flowers to each side of the castle im pretty sure elsa did not have any flowers blooming outside her castle the conclusion hm i really wanted to like this set but i just cant quite bring myself to it feels like lego pulled a random castle design from the files then redid it into white and trans blue to look icy and allow a frozen tie in set the figs are great but the castle isnt i guess the real castle in the movie would be a boring set and this one has play features but it just is too different for my taste the ratings value 710  40 for less than 300 parts is high especially when so many of the parts are tiny but on the other hand theres a lot of rock panels and 1x2x5 trans blue panels but the figs help save it design 410  not one of legos best not as bad as the lows in the 90s but not a great set minifigs 1010  possibly even a 1210 they are the reason to buy the set  playability 810  there are a bunch of play features but they actually detract from the design so i had to knock off a couple points parts 710  a bunch of impractical unique parts how often do you need dark purple skis or a lavender fence piece but also a bunch of nice parts if you wanted to make your own icy scene overall 710  a great bunch of figs but id recommend not bothering with the manuals just use the parts to build your own castle thats better	neutral
i managed to get two sets for my twin girls for christmas and would have to agree with your ratings the anna and elsa figs are indeed excellent	neutral
very nice review mostlytechinc once i saw this set i was interested in it for the colours and piecesthanks for this review to shed more light onto it	positive
isnt getting parts in new colors a good thing it is a shame there is only this one set i think tlg could make a whole subtheme out of frozen i do agree that they overuse lavender and magenta i dont see why every girl set has to have these sort of colors instead of what would be accurate to the source material 	negative

thanks for the review mostlytechnic i too wish they had done a real castle for this set it certainly deserved it my sons and i figure they could have used the old rock monster mold from rock raiders in white for the missing snow beast i will pick it up though for the figs and unique pieces	positive
thanks for the review i have the same opinion about the design looks like belville i bought it on legostore orlando december 30th it was impressive my wife saw them putting on shelf 8 or 10 boxes she ran and grabbed the last one the girls faces around it was indescribable mix of ecstasy and afraid to loose it it happened in less than 2 minutes my 7 yo girl didnt want it she likes the dresses but hates the movie prefers lego movie but my 2 yo girl who never saw the movie grabbed it for good and we bought it lego will sell it like water but i do not understand why a set so small it is the worst set design since the introduction of lego friends my 7 yo has more than 50 lego friends minifigures all the lego fiends stores and concluded that the castle had a terrible design she is 7 lets be honest lego should have released this sets months before this christmas and is loosing a perfect opportunity to sell a decent set with much more pieces i am wondering if they are going to make another set with the same characters at the end it is just for the minifigures	negative
when i first saw the pictures i didnt realize that this set had so much color barf going on in it also there is a bunch of stuff that does not fit in with the movie and it is pricey the minifigures are nice but no kristoff or sven i thought about getting this but this review is pushing me towards no	negative
yep my family all thinks they should have made a bigger set added figs and just been printing money this feels massively rushed into production which is weird the other princess sets that just came out look worlds better	negative
i think the transglitter blue panels can be icy or snowy just fine im sure thats why they used them for this set now if youre looking for realism like the photos in your sig seem to be it might be tougher but ive been thinking about using those big glittery panels to make a waterfalltype scene	positive

bennemans on 13 january 2015  0608 pm said there is a very simple reason for the flowers and greenleaved trees you should remember from the movie it was actually summer when elsa set of the eternal winter… true but all around her ice castle it is all winter so why are there nonwinter bits in this set doesnt make sense the picnic is because they wanted a minivignette for olaf to fit into but the rest of the green and flowers dont make sense tenorikuma on 13 january 2015  0958 am said im pretty sure ive gotten other sets recently with three pieces of tape on them cool good to know was wondering but havent remembered to look when im at a store recently whitefang on 13 january 2015  0912 am said very nice review indeed and i also cant wait for the release of this set it will be a superb wonderful addition to the lego disney princess theme thanks for the fp but a lovely sweet review i thought i bashed this set pretty hard	negative

7665 review part 2 the second half of the build goes quicker than the first once you start to add the engines the ship really begins to take shape the main body of the ship has a few surprises hidden away under a removable cover inside you get some retracting guns a storage box a little shuttle and space for a droid and figure here is everything you can fit inside the guns are concealed behind the side vents pushing them forward causes the vents to open closed and open the final feature is the passenger areaescape pod inside is plenty of space for two figures the pod cleverly attaches by pushing the front section of the ship forward sliding the pod in then returning the front everything locks together and is held securely in place by an elastic band  heres a couple of pictures of the final model its not the most beautiful creation ever but it is an excellent representation of the ship from the film the angular shape actually suits a lego build well theres one more useful feature the whole ship can be safely and comfortably picked up by two ball ended technic pins towards the back end it balances well at this point and does allow you to swoosh the ship around much more easily this was the most enjoyable star wars build ive had in a long time everything progresses nicely with almost no repetitive bits the ship looks good and is also huge sweet compare it to the 6211 isd and youll see its only fractionally smaller when i first saw pictures of this on the internet i thought it looked ok once you see it for real it is much more impressive for 6999 in the uk im not complaining its the best value star wars set of the year so far to conclude pieces 910 minifigures 710 would be a 9 apart from the stupid quigonobiwan head error playability 810 originality 910 set design 810 overall 8210 the box says this is a limited edition set whatever that means so if youre planning to get it id suggest you grab it at the first opportunity im glad i did xd edited by kernow 22 july 2007  1056 pm	positive

shakar on aug 1 2007 0134 pm said third note is it just me or did you attach the two black gate pieces too high shakar no i think this is correct the upper plate with clip for the door is a little high on top of a dark gray 1x1 brick so if you want the door to operate well you have to place it like that i just put the clip under that brick a very easy fix so my door now is lower which looks better imho and no sneaky skelly can crawl along under it xd	neutral

ok here is the set alot of us star wars fans have been waiting for the 7666 hoth rebel base wub first the box now the great minifigs that stunning k3po fig now the snowspeeder aaaaggghhhhh these parts are all stickers now for the turret the 2 cones on the side press in to fire out 2 blue lights saber blades d now for the small crane thingy yes the part under the engine on the snowspeeder is another sticker 8 echo base well the front door anyway d  the main control room d again these are stickers on a tinted clear panel and on the slope  i have no idea what this is meant to be d finally 2 shots of the full set wub well over all i really like this set and think it is great value for money the minifigs alone would set you back more than the cost of this set the build time was a good 2 hours or so and was good fun the snowspeeder is not as good as the second snowspeeder and no where near as good as the first in my opinion but i did love that first one the k3po fig is perfect and it is good to be getting more droids that arent r2d2 and c3po it is a shame about the stickers but that is the price of keeping the cost down i suppose the only printed part in the whole set is the snowspeederxwing windscreen i will definately be getting atleast another 3 of this great set 910	positive

excellent set the snowtroopers are just amazing most lego imperial troops are really good however its sad that except from luke all the rebels have the same face which is what is more the most unexpressive that you can find for the rest the quality looks excellent the snowspeeder is far better than the first they realized but only one thing it looks a bit too white to me i think i remember they were grey and orange rather than white in the film and the echo base door is really cool really nice set edited by lord beckett 02 august 2007  0414 pm	positive

review  42039  24 hours race car introduction when the preliminary images of the le mans racer surfaced somewhere last year 2014 it got a lot of praise this changed dramatically when the final images of the 24 hours race car showed up the front side of the car especially the head lights and the curvature of the side of car had changed a lot the car obviously still resembled the prototype but the new design raised a lot of eyebrows the new design was considered a step back instead of forward eventhough i still liked the design i must admit i liked the earlier design better too with the emphasis on past tense liked i am not sure anymore and this review will show you why like the arctic truck this set has a bmodel which is well worth checking out thats why this review includes both the amodel and bmodel for people who are on the fence the bmodel might actually convince them to buy the set after all lets see what this set is all about note all images can be clicked for hires versions set information number 42039 title 24 hours race car theme technic released 2015 part count 1219 box weight 2110 gr box dimensions 478 cm x 373 cm x 87 cm model dimensions 40 cm x 18 cm set price msrp €9999    £9999 price per part €0082    £0082 links brickset bricklink the box the box measures 478 cm x 373 cm x 87 cm and weighs well over 2kg 2110 gr to be precise the width of the box is the same as the box of the arctic truck this box also feels like its filled to the brim the front the front shows a picture of the main model in action with radial blurred wheels to emphasize the motion of the car the lower right section shows the dimensions of the model upon completion it will measure a length of 40cm and a width of 18 cm the back like the front the back side has exactly the same setup as the box of the arctic truck the top shows the functions of the model while the lower left side shows the bmodel and the lower right side shows the motorization options the picture of the bmodel looks so cool it could be a model of its own at this point i was very eager to build both models and compare them the side one of the sides usually shows a part in 11 scale this time its one of the wheels indicating the size of the model content of the box the box contains 1 booklet 1 sticker sheet 13 bags 4 tires instruction booklet since i own two copies of the set i also received two instruction booklets whats catching my eye is that my second copy is supplied in different packaging than the first one its for the first time that i am aware of that the instruction booklet and stickers come in a sealed bag without cardboard back hopefully this will be a new standard for all sets with sticker sheets instead of multiple booklets this set contains a single square bound book in earlier reviews i have epxressed my preference for a single book i dont see any advantage in having 2 3 or even up to 6 booklets sticker sheet like the actual model the sticker sheet looks very vibrant the bright green white and black color combination has found its way to the stickers as well either you love em or hate em since i started writing reviews i have been applying stickers and i am happy i started doing it stickers do give the model its finishing touch bags with parts thirteen bags with a total of 1219 parts give or take a few are supplied in the densily packed box the rims and flex are sealed in a bag as well sometimes looking at the bags makes you wonder what the logic is behind the distribution of the various parts across the different bags well this time it really got me confused take a look at two of the bags below theres a bag containing all the 3l blue pins then theres a bag with various partsand a single 3l blue pin i figured this might be an error but both of the sets have the same anomaly tires the tires have been supplied unbagged as usual highlighted parts this chapter describes new and interesting parts this set actually contains a lot of them this set also contains an abundance of panels if you arent into panels this isnt the set for you changeover catch this year 2015 the new changeover catch parts were released its a combination of three parts the advantage of the new parts is that the red gear is the same on both sides which avoids mounting it the wrong way around it also avoids the changeover catch slipping out of the driving ring like it used to do you can apply lots of pressure but the catch doesnt slip out pins some of last years new pins are also included in this set 12 x pin with pin hole and 21 x 3l pin with 1l axle securing technic beams can be quite simple with the new pin with pin holes the new 3l pin with 1l axle gives you more possibilities when connecting beams and other parts below are two example situations where the new pins have been used granted the examples below can be accomplished by using other techniques however some predicaments from the past can be easily solved by using these new parts like me you will most likely appreciate the ease of use engine and suspension also included are two steering portal hubs and steering portal hubs with ball joint arms and four steering portal axles for driving and steering the vehicle these parts are commonly used nowadays the picture below also shows some other parts like gear rack steering arms and suspension frames this set comes with a single 5x7 frame and three 5x11 frames panels this set contains a whopping 47 panels in three different colors i personally like panels a lot and i do appreciate the variety we have at our disposal lately this set even contains a new 13x3x2 curved mudguard panel new 13x3x2 curved panel this is the first set to contain the new 13x3x2 curved panel looking at the pictures doesnt do these panels justice in real life they are actually quite big i figured they would be smaller but they are even longer than the 11 x 5 frame with a length of 13 including the attachment points hopefully this part will be available in other colors as well preferably white for adding variety to your ev3 robot 19l white flexaxles the white 19l flex axles have only been released in a single set the 8461 williams f1 racer in 2002 current prices on bricklink are as high as 15 euros needless to say we are very happy with the return of these white axles now we can build jeroen ottens awesome alfa romeo 4c spider for a decent price as well i am really happy that useful rare parts are being used more often by tlg designers part list heres the complete list for all 1219 parts as you can see in the highlighted parts section this set contains a lot of interesting and useful parts if you dont own sets like the 8070  supercar this might be the set to pick up if you want to start building your own supercar the build enough with all the set and part information lets build the model rear suspension the build starts with the rear suspension and drivetrain as you can see in the picture below the length of the axle between the steering cv joint is 4l where it usally is 3l this is an indication that the finished model will be a bit bigger than usual 8070 for example the finished suspension is one of the cleanest suspension setups i have seen in an official model its pretty basic but it works like a charm this setup is defintely worth using in your moc heres a video after attaching the suspension to the frame you rotate the module and secure it at this stage the rear section of the chassis with suspension is almost finished v8 midengine extending the chassis forward results in the picture below where the front spoiler is already visible whats also visible is the v8 engine placed right in front of the rear axle resulting in a midengine setup perfectly suited for sports and race cars two exhaust pipes have been fitted on either side of the engine together with two hoses attaching them to the engine the instructions are easy to follow although you sometimes you need to bend the beams a bit minor improvements are possible here and there but nothing shocking front suspension the front suspension is a bit more complicated than the rear suspension which makes sense considering the fact it contains the steering rack the shock absorbers are placed in a different angle than the rear ones resulting in a somewhat stiffer front suspension all in all the front suspension is well designed and the steering rack can be easily powered with a servo motor the picture belows shows the front suspension attached to the chassis if you follow the official instructions to motorize the model the area in front of the suspension is used to mount the battery box when you are modding this model to make it full rc this area can be used to mount the servo motor gearbox like the gearbox in the 8070 its not used to switch gears powering the drivetrain its used to switch between two functions opening the doors and the hoodbonnet the gearbox is located at the left of the vehicle near the cockpit the mechanism to open the doors is located on the left side while opening the hoodbonnet is taking place at the right side to accomplish this some axles traverse under the cockpit to the other side of the vehicle following the axles to other side of the vehicle and adding some gears results in the situation below the video below shows the gearbox in action door opening mechanism the mechanism to open the door is comprised of some knob wheels links without stoppers and pins with towballs take a look at the doors opening and closing the front using the new mudguards and various other panels you finish the front of the car the front is probably the most controversial part of the car this is caused by the preliminary pictures shown before the release of this car in the early pictures the front of the car had smooth curves and beautiful lines while the final car lost these smooth lines and got a more blocky look in return i must admit that at a first glance the new design lost some of its appeal however this model grew on me pretty rapidly the headlight design can be found in more or less the same way on several real le mans type race cars the rear the rear of the car looks great with the stickers continuing from the mudguards to the panels underneath the spoiler the two exhausts sticking out give some details to the back i absolutely disagree with all the negativity surrounding this car maybe its one of those models which needs to grow on you finished model here it is the finished model i know some of you dont like the looks of the car but i think it looks great the color scheme is outstanding the new for technic bright green parts combined with white and black make this car look very vibrant and colorful i am not a big fan of the green used in the 42008  service truck but i do like this bright green a lot it fits perfectly well with the mindstorms ev3 set the curves on the side of the car are not as smooth as some of us hoped but i still think the car looks more than acceptable from the side the stickers add some nice details to the car giving it that characteristic race car look the model looks great in pictures but it does even look better in real life i love this picture of the front of the car however i do wonder if a dedicated 24 hour le mans racer has the seat and steering positioned offcenter using the good ol google machine i come to the conclusion that they do have centered seating and steering at least the majority of them theres ample space in the cabin which makes me wonder why tlg decided to place the seat offcentered the rear view looks cool too with some of the suspension showing and the two exhaust pipes clearly visible the bottom view is very useful to determine the size of the car in studs it measures approx 59 x 27 studs the chassis looks organized and well designed the engine has been placed close to the ground which is perfect for the weight distribution a low center of gravity improves the handling of the car i really enjoyed building this baby the build is very clean and organized although there are some steps where you need to bend the beams a bit to get things into place seeing the model come to life and seeing it grow to pretty impressive proportions is very satisfying for me it was fun but i reckon kids will go nuts over this set and the build size comparison what became obvious during the build but whats emphasized when you have finished the model is that its quite big the size of the car is pretty impressive the pictures below show the car next to the 42030  volvo l350f the side view emphasizes the size of the car its even longer than the volvo if you dismiss the bucket parts left some parts left nothing out of the ordinary features and functions unlike the bmodel this model doesnt implement any unexpected features the functions it does implement are exactly what you would expect from any car steering hog working fake engine suspension opening doors gullwing style opening bonnethood opening trunk gearbox for switching between functions unfortunately the steering wheel hasnt been linked to the hog hand of god steering mechanism placing the seat in the center would have provided an easy way to link the steering wheel to the steering mechanism its a shame we hardly see actual steering anymore opening the hood actually opens up the entire rear section of the car providing you with easy access to the motor compartment the mechanism to open the hood works properly which results in smooth opening and closing of it the same goes for the gullwing style doors both functions are operated manually and you need to switch with the lever to the left of the cockpit these two functions are also the ones which can be motorized by placing an mmotor near the cockpit and a battery box in the trunk all things considered i think this car offers lots of playability the model is solidly built and the functions are easy to operate id say its pretty safe to let your kids play with it bmodel unlike the amodel the bmodel for this set received almost universal acclaim and i can see why often the bmodel is a pale shadow of its part donor in this case the model looks so good it could be a model of its own it even incorporates a neat feature which actually deserves to be in the amodel theres a lot a variation in the quality of digital building instructions tlg is providing but these ones are of very high quality the picture below shows most of the chassis with suspension fake engine and gearbox in place finished model some concessions have been made but overall the car looks fantastic the black of the roof has been extrapolated from the hood which definitely works for me the rear section of the car feels a bit empty but the panels do cover up most of it so its hardly noticeable the v8 stickers will be upside down if you use the parts from the amodel since i could apply new stickers i have placed them using the proper orientation the bottom of the car shows the chassis its obviously a bit smaller than the amodels chassis features and functions taking the functions into account this model isnt playing second fiddle to the amodel besides the obvious functions like steering opening doors and hood this car features folding fog lights which deserve a better podium than a bmodel steering hog working fake engine suspension opening doors manually opening hoodbonnet manually opening trunk operated by gear folding fog lights operated by gear gearbox used to switch functions fog lights one of the most interesting features of the bmodel are the folding fog lights it almost feels a bit weird that a feature like this is implemented in the bmodel instead of the amodel below are 4 steps showing how the mechanism works i have also included a video the mechanism is somewhat reminiscent of fork mechanism used in the 8109  flatbed truck which has been described in effermans review take a look at the video to the fog lights in action parts left a fair number of parts left which isnt uncommon for a bmodel summary to summarize how i feel about this set you need to take a look at the picture below the combined image reflects the quality of this setor better yetsets you actually get two great models for the price of one you dont like the amodel no problem you can have lots of fun with the bmodel i cant stop playing with the fog lights its mesmarizing the color scheme on both models is outstanding i simply cant emphasize enough how well this color scheme pleases the eye the regular green is dull and boring but this bright green really pops out especially when combined with black and white and possibly some red details black white and a little red sounds familiar yes bright green can easily be combined with your ev3 robots so while you are combining the bright green with your robot why not use the great new curved mudguard panels these new panels are introduced in this set and they look great they open up a lot of possibilities in the design department the build of the amodel is outstanding it is fairly simple but since its so clean i really enjoyed it a lot i think the build should be entertaining which doesnt mean it needs to be a real challenge and lets be honest when is a build really challenging the rear suspension is a good example of why i liked the build its very simple yet very effective works like a charm the same goes for the other functions in both models and the star of the entire show can be found in the bmodel hows that for a surprise being aware of the fact that i like this model a lot better than most of you seem to do i really encourage you to give this model a chance the sheer size is impressive the color scheme is awesome and you get a bonus model which is actually worth building score okay so how do i grade this set 8 design open to debate but i like it a lot 8 building experience fun and clean build 9 features superb function in bmodel steels the show 9 playability both models offer lots of playability 8 parts lots of new parts and cool existing parts 10 value for money two models for the price of one 87 twice the fun i hope you enjoyed this review

outstanding review jim congrats  love the pictures so clean and crisp  hope to see many more of your reviews as for the set after seeing this review i kind of like it if i will find it at a decent price i will get it for sure	positive

thanks for a great review ive got a pile of tru and lego credit i wanna spend and was thinking about getting this since i got a sneak peak of your review in the academy but its not here in the us yet too bad wonder when itll hit i do disagree about the manuals though i find the thinner stapled manuals easier to use than single large squarebound ones since they lay flatter when open have any links to the prelim photos of the front end i dont remember seeing that and was curious how different it looked	positive
great reviewi am still undecided whether to get this set or not	positive
really thorough review jim i am super jealous that you have 2 of these and i have none with no opportunity to get one any time soon	positive
great review i see now why the b model is so popular i wonder though on the car if instead of the panels for the rear spolier or wing if they could have used studded panels and maybe layer them to give the appearance of ie a three element rear wing i wont mention the front lights if i had the money i would buy it for the b model h	positive
i think this set will be my next purchase i love the color scheme and indeed it looks like a nice set also 1200 parts for eur 100 is not a bad deal and yes the looks of the car have really grown on my since the first official pictures appeared im curious how the bright green will work combined with other colors than white i really hope more sets in the future will use the color so that more different parts will be available over time i think im the only person on eurobricks who doesnt like the looks of the b model but i appreciate the extra functionality it offers besides the set itself i think this is one of the best reviews i have read in a while great job on the superb photographs which i think are essential to a review and the extensiveness of it all you really touched every subject which is great d	positive
this is a mega review youve taken the right pictures and the video demonstrations of the mechanisms really help get the good points of the set across whats more amazing is that the review still feels very concise and to the point youve actually convinced me to put this set on my list and not just as a decent parts pack lasse d on 12 march 2015  0847 pm said  the front shouldnt open like that  instead it should be easy to remove the whole front cover leaving the suspension easy to work on  the aero seems to be realistic except for the rear end where theres no indication of a venturi channel this should have been easy to include  there is no fuel tank nor fixed fuel connector right behind the cabin  there are no air jacks seriously this is one of the most unique features of a race car like this and lego forgot about them instead they automated two functions which are manual on a real race car  the top cars at le mans are hybrids with ingenious systems i would have loved to see the front wheels connected to some kind of spinning apparatus indicating a kinetic energy recovery system im not sure air jacks are the feature that will have people fawning over this set and pneumatics are being covered rather well later in the year  but i agree with everything else most notably removable front and rear bodywork the removable engine cover on 8674 would be a good starting point here and the inclusion of some nod towards a hybrid system its also worth remembering the preliminary design did have the big honking fin bhf that is mandatory on all current prototypes so maybe when that was removed any trace of a tunnel or diffuser went with it on the subject of steering wheels all modern prototypes actually have left or right hand drive the regulations demand that both lmp1 and lmp2 cars are nominally capable of seating two people of course in practise the extra seat is taken up by the hybrid system in lmp1 and electronicsextra cockpit access in lmp2 however this doesnt change the fact that it would be easy to link the steering wheel to the hogfront axle edited by jay psi 12 march 2015  0955 pm	positive
i was very skeptical of this set because i really thought the redesign degraded the looks of the amodel a lot but after building it i must say this is an excellent set good job tlg	positive
im still not a huge fan of the model but this is one awesome review the effort and quality can be clearly seen and i hope you continue making reviews like this	positive
great review i think it look like a great set both a and b however the panels are the only thing i would need but still a great looking set	positive
a very professional review and really no stone unturned but im still not going to rush out and buy a copy	positive
a great review jim just finished building this set a couple of steps required abit of lego stressing to get together when there was an easier way just made it into rc  almost finished it in ldd which was easy to do as it has so much room for nearly any configuration of motors and not have them showing a great set edited by jonorocky 13 march 2015  1053 am	positive
wonderful review but i am still not sold on the set if we get more sets with the bright green i might be tempted to get it but until then it is too few parts in bright green too few different types not the number of pieces to be able to use that colour effectively in making mocs	neutral

ah mani wanted to review it with mine oh well here in the us it cost 150 and has 1355 pieces total the pins and axles did seem a bit difficult in putting them into place a problem i have been having is the batterys are done after about 4 hours of play which i really wish they would last longer   overall it is a stupendous set and it is really nice to see our old friend the studs make a return	neutral

alright so i usually do quick photo reviews when i get new sets thats what ill do here but theres quite a few photos so i thought i might as well make its own review thread so i got the kwikemart by paying just2much on an early ebay copy i think its worth it as this week im gonna be super busy so i was able to build it saturday and stuff heres my video review i think its one of my best well lets get onto this photo review the set is 200 usd with a little over 2100 pieces the official release is april 15th for vip members may 1st for everyone else at lego stores and if you want full size pictures check out my flickr by clicking here the minifigures included are great you get three exclusive minifigures one being a completely exclusive character the first time lego has ever put an exclusive mould in a direct to consumer set and you get three of the series most popular characters in their normal attire for those who missed out on the first simpsons minifigures series the kwikemarts exterior is loaded with lots of sticker details the only printed detail youll see in the exterior is the dial pad in the phone booth which has appeared in some other licensed themes since last year   right here is there the store can be opened a simple technic pin and receiver keeps it in place and allows for opening and closing the roof of the store includes the garden shown in the paul mccartney episode the roof can be slided outin once you open it with the hinge part heres a look at the store with the roof removed the floors are a nice sand blue color coming with 8x16 thin plates and for the interior from the view of the store opened with the hinges at the back that i mentioned earlier the left front corner which includes some arcade machines of bonestorm and great white hunter an amazingly done buzz cola soda machine juice machine the checkout counter ect the right front corner with food aisles freezers and a frozen jasper sticker the back left corner which includes some nice coffee kettle builds the donut tray hotdogs ect the right back corner which has a door leading to a very small hallway that only has a mouse and cheese in it the hallway leads to the employees only door in the back and its very hard to get in the door way not that theres anything to do inside there also included is clancys copcar which fits three figures heres a look at the piece list in the instructions click on each to be lead to an enlarged version of the pic also included are some awesome printed pieces and two unprinted coffee cups honestly i think this set is perfect the price is fantastic and has a great ppp ratio they really went above and beyond by including snake in this set i honestly think its better than the simpsons house in terms of accuracy and the value here so many cool pieces printed and in exclusive colors so thats my quick picture review hope you guys enjoyed and id love to hear your thoughts	positive
thanks for the review your video was very well done seeing those sticker sheets is daunting	positive
thanks for all the feedback you guys robert8 on 12 april 2015  1125 pm said i cant help but think the minifigures are the weak part of the set snake and apu are great but the rest i dont know they kinda redundant now they could at least give us new torso printing like homer wearing his jacket or bart wearing his blue tshirt or marge wearing her coat or as i said in the discussion thread id have included jasper in cmf series 2 and a frozen version here overall the set looks kinda smaller than what i thought i agree but so many people were complaining about how the simpsons house should have included the most common versions mostly because the eyes or whatever so i think lego played it safe and just included the normal versions it makes sense since series 1 is gone forever and the common versions were in there and this set is bound to be in stock for a very long time like the death star i never really agreed when people were complaining about the alternate eye prints personally but i guess this is a good business choice based on previous feedback edited by just2good 13 april 2015  1206 am	negative
hello everyone excellent review english is not my native language but i want to express my opinion simpsons house was the first of its kind and i can say without exaggeration that this is the most impressive set that im going my collection httpbricksetcomsetsownedbyceleb  i look at the video from the kwikemart and is difficult to say how good it is compared with the house the main disadvantages that i said to myself is this build the walls of the large panels next is access to the roof gray parts in front of the back door i think they represent the stairs is not on the level with doors on the roof and when you open them you can see the white block is openly trash my points of view boxes on the left of go to the store and powersauce box i want see make real and not just a cube fe such as in the unreleased star wars set about minifigures i fully agree with robert8 two more of the same homer marge and bart personally i put my set as a scene and all the replays minifigure are inside the house that was not identical characters next and also absolutely terrible barts accessory this set is made parking for bikes and it looks very cool but damn it is hoped to see the bart or lisas bike instead of useless balloons with paint the walls are made with convex inside panels why so can anyone know have not seen any pictures with such walls in tv show why did not they turn i personally really like how realized roof but my brother says that it is terrible  garden could do more in the series there were almost jungle i do not know how to be considered here maybe anyone can express any opinion or idea i look at the simpsons house and then look at the photo of this emart i can not understand in the house we have a garage two floors cool floor a lot of furniture all the rooms and walls collected from cubes many additional accessories and where is all this detail here it looks much smaller maybe even poorer if they still will release next year comic book store it will be even less of course it is difficult to estimate without seeing it live we have it will be sold only in may at first sight it does not look so impressive as the house can certainly the case in the limit on the amount of detail but why it was impossible to add  50 to the cost and make jasper the more detailed the roof the walls of the smaller elements that it was not convex sad thanks all for attention edited by celeb 13 april 2015  0510 am	positive
can you post a pic of it next to the simpsons house just curious about size comparisons	positive
incredible set thanks for the pics so many details and unique prints and colors im not that into the simpsons but definitely a top tier set	positive
i have sooo mixed feeling about that i loved the simpsons house save for the terrible wall in the homer and marges room but this so far is inferior in almost every aspect the walls made of panels is a bummer i expect a d2c set to be better that this 60 stickers the same thing same price for less bricks and smaller build then the house strange coloured bricks on the outside wall some ugly mix of yellow  tan panels again with their fronts facing towards the inside of the shop so we and up with those squares all around the walls are yellow this was so nice lost opportunity to make it in some other less common colour then again the set overall looks is good the roof is a nice detail the shop looks actually like a real one not just an approximation of one the roof tiles are in dark orange  we got newrare colour here the car looks interesting to build just like the pink one from the house lots of nice references to the show its the simpsons definitely a must buy but for a discounted price ill try to find one with maybe damaged box or afterdisplay copy edited by mestari 14 april 2015  0115 pm	negative
looks great how does it compare to the house	positive
heres a size comp to the house click for a bigger image	positive
thats actually not bad sizing imo sure it looks like you get a lot more with the house but the kwikemart has a lot more of those little references that make it simpsons i agree with some of the complaining a real jasper behind a transblue panel would have been cool you could always bulk up the roof with more foliage i think it has a great foundation as a set but could do with a few mods to make it better thanks for the pictures i greatly appreciate being able to see reviews like this before dropping 200 on a lego set	negative
great review just2good honestly i love this set lots of great details and references	positive
one thing that may justify the price it has 527 different parts if i counted correctly i alway heard the more different parts the more difficult the set is to produce the simpsons house already had an astonishig amount of different pieces but this one is even more extreme	negative

tks sinner for that cool review  this set is not one of my favs never was really a big fan of those raised baseplates but had fantastic parts and mfs  it has great playability with really cool 80s miami feel wub that pink was actually pretty cool and went well with that lime green i think its lime but im not 100 positive once again this pisses me off so much that i was in my dark ages when this theme was out  i loved it especially all the beachwater themes wub i really wish tlc decided to bring that water paradisia back  who knows  after all they need to make some girlie sets  girls are a part of their market totally neglected  how many women we have on the boards  really a tiny few unfortunatly  so tlc please bring paradisia back in may 08 p  please  yoda	positive

due to a larger bl order in the us i couldnt resist to add two hopper waggons to my train layout heres a review of this fantastic set the box well theres nothing really special about it the open box with three polybags note that there are only three different colors used in that set actually there are 4 but you cant see the dark grey ones great color composition by the way wub and  no stickers   d oooops  i opened the bags too fast help me im drowning sing not following the instructions i built the wheels first to get the larger pieces out of the way keep on rolling this is the load of the hopper waggon 11 round bricks altogether when i opened the set i was curious if it was a new colored set or an old one luckily enough it was an old one with old dark grey i dont know if tlc ever produced this set with bley from the following pic you can clearly see that the set is an old one look at these slope bricks see what i mean all bricks are looking exactly the same buy a set today means get at least three different textures on the slopes and maybe even more shades of tan x  i have said that in many other threads here and im saying it again back to the roots lego you were able to produce good quality show us you can still do it sad but now to the building its a 6 x 24 train base plate youre building on did i say i liked the colors d this is the mechanism to unload the waggon built in the waggon with open gates  and with closed ones almost done this is the first time i realized that minifigs actually can step on those ladders  a short lift and the wheels are fixed this darn mechanism wait im coming with my monkey wrench  who opened that door again do i have to do it all on my own  finally the work is done now have a brake one shot from the frontback you can see the car is really huge 8 i put it behind the red car of the 4512 that sure looked very strange wacko the set fits a lot better to the other cars of the my own train theme than to the older ones the score brick selection 1010 excellent color and brick selection these were the days playability 910 great unloading mechanism pricepiece count ratio 810 at peeron it says 20 i got it for 3995  30228 bricks not really cheap but worth every cent  overall rating 910 and a definity must buy for rolling stock lovers sad enough its not available on sh any more but there are still sets on bl and ebay thats for now folks thank you for reading i have some job to do	positive

wub wub wub wub wub holodoc i seriously have some love for your review youre in it and using a fabuland wrench such a clever review with a great sense of humor i really liked this train set and it adds so much to a train layout especially when you buy multiples tlc is throwing away a potential gold mine by discontinuing this line  it is also nice to see those beautiful consistent slopes in that picture it really is sad that tlc is letting quality slip they dont seem to be responding to the issue they way they did the bleyfrown fiasco perhaps we afol need to make more of a stink to the embassy  again great job holodoc and thanks for sharing sweet y what an excellent and fun review	positive
thank you guys for your nice reply  i have to add two pics of my freight train showing a bit more clearly what the size matter is about this is what it looks like when you put the hopper waggon right behind the red car of 4512 it looks a lot better without the red car i had a lot of fun with this review and i will add another one look at the 2nd pic   the next days stay tuned	neutral

yes my spongebob fans its time for another review  lets look at our bikini bottom map and head strait to meet miss puff at her boating school she is waiting for us to give us a guided tour of her establishment  another bit of sb history this set comes from the following episode boating school spongebob fails his boating test for the 38th time what a freaking retard lool hes so determined to get his license that patrick decides to help him he implants a walkietalkie inside sbs head in order to cheat and tell him what to do you will say that i am biais but i really enjoy building this set and i really like the sb theme  lets hope 2008 brings more of that cool spongieness  but i digress here are general pics of the instruction booklet and the dss g there are loads of crappy stickers in that one also  as you can see the set is divided in 3 polybags shamelessly but nonetheless wilfully hehe i will disregard the third one which is that playability crap course  i would have reviewed it but since it involves stickers i didnt want to ruin the parts and without stickers it would look dull plain and ugly it does look crappy with so imagine without so that review will not be 100 complete and i do apologise in advance but how many of you would have build that and keep it hehe off p 1 mfs and extras i will start with the really cool miss puff wub the fig mind you  she looks a bit stressed  no wonder that sponge menace will bring her to the hospital once again hehe as you can see that mf comprises 3 parts the small blue 1x1 round and the 2 major parts yeay another great stupid looking sb i love those idiotic faces  3 different sb figs and 3 idiotic faces hehe you never can get enough of them  here is just a regular patrick too bad patrick doesnt have different expressions  the pull back boat car nothing really to report except the fact that i left it sticker free  the only thing i built from the third polybag is that pretty cool ancker holding tower thingie  looks great in a lighthouse set hehe yes the roud tile bouey is printed  its the same as in sbs bed in the bikini bottom set  ok its time for those two great buildings the lighthouse and the school  pontoon  before reviewing them individually here is a general pic 2 the lighthouse one of the main reason to own that great set  sure it suffers from accute stickeretite sad but d  t worst is that door but nonetheless a great and simple building  great whitered colour scheme and a really fantastic 2 turning lights  i really like the yellow top of the lighthouse it adds to the comic atmosphere of that theme instead of having a more plain redwhite only the rear has nothing really fancy except tools to fix it in case of problems hehe the only thing i modified since i didnt build the third polybag is that i got rid of the trechnic parts on the right of the lighthoue to replace them with regular logs all hail the tower king  d 3 the school and pontoon i really like that little building and its great to see that once again tlc uses the amazing dark blue color  its really a simple design but looks fantastic and can be used for many things in a town hehe i also really like the combination with those dark bluish grey slopes  the rear reveals the desk stickers on the wall doh  and two clams serving as chairs really like on the show its really great to see that tlc stays really as close to the show as possible the pontoon again is simple yet really cool and effective and its really nice to have 2 lifesaving boueys the only thing i modified since i didnt build the third polybag is that i got rid of the trechnic parts in front of the pontoon to replace them with regular logs on the overall i think its really a great set  apart from the crap stickers i think tlc should have ditched or simplified the third playability polybag to lower the cost  oh well parts are always usefull except those one part shitty palm trees  so until my next review i bid you farewell my spongebob fans  and i really hope to see next year hehe will sb get his drivers license one day  for the sake of bikini bottom lets hope not  no license ever on  yoda	positive
thats really a great and overall nice playset with a very cool mrs puff and a fine new spongebob sweet the boating schools indeed very nice with a beautiful color scheme and so is the lighthouse im really tempted to buy a second set just to complete these buildings although its a little too expensive for doing so and it wouldnt even fit with the style of the other sb sets xd wet highway to the poor puffer fish privat hell on d	positive
yoda comes through again i love this set but it just costs too much for australians so i will be giving it a miss  it is a shame as it has clams in it 8	positive
another great review thanks yoda man those smooth slopes really look like crap when on a roof  that was the whole reason they had texture in the first place  ill never liked those they feel so cheap the new sb head is great and can mrs puffs legs move i just ask since her feet are separate and in figs where the legs cant move theyre usually one piece at the bottom to keep them from breaking off the set looks great and seems to have a lot of playability	positive
nice review  im not a big fan of those spongebob figs however this set has some very useful pieces this is actually the first time i took a decent look at a spongebob set	positive
man that spongebob head cracks me up hilaritythis is a cool set although i much prefer the chum bucket set i dont see whats wrong with the course then again i can see why afols wouldnt like it its just playability really i like the breakable wall though the building is cool a few modifications ie making it more realistic real chairs for a start and it would make a cool little wharf for your lego town and to sw4j mrs puffs legs are connected at the feet if you look closely so thanks for the great review yoda	positive
thank you yoda for strike 2 its sb again  sticker alarm x but this set is better than chum bucket there are far more interesting parts if you dont like sb especially the light house and the little hut with the wooden pontoon y and yet again another set with smooth slopes and rough ones too bad too bad    if i just knew the person who is responsible for that 	positive

lego 75915 pteranodon capture im glad to review this nice set 75915 pteranodon capture name pteranodon capture set number 75915 pieces 174 price 1999 minifigs 2 theme jurassic world year of release 2015 links box the front of the box has the jurassic world logo along with the set number piece count etc its a decent box size for a 20 set here it is compared to a minifigure heres the back of the box it shows all of the features from the set an ad for the video game the back also shows a small picture with a silhouette of the dinosaurs from the line along with their set numbers instruction booklet the booklet shows the same thing as the front of the box nothing more nothing less near the back of the booklet there is a picture with all of the characters from the sets the other page shows all the dinosaurs with a mini box that shows the size comparisons the minifigures the minifigures in this set are simon masrani and an acu both of them have excellent printing on the front and the back the gun is the same one from tlm that the ssp used simon masrani is the only one with a double sided face his second face shows a scaredworried expbbression he has a zipped up jacket or jumpsuit with a shirt underneath the acu trooper only has one face which is a scaredworried expbbression i would have a scared expbbression too if i was about to get eaten by a dinosaur he has great detail on his torso and legs lets take a look at the vest the vest is the same mold from the ssp in tlm i think it has the letters acu on the front too the back is nothing interesting pteranodon the pteranodon has great printing too the colors match the ones that the pteranodons from the movie have the wings mouth and head are a rubbery type of plastic and are easily bendable it uses the same mold from the pteranodon in the 2012 dino line heres a comparison between the two spare parts the spare parts arent many just a few extras the helicopter at first the helicopter was meh when i first saw it on the box now that ive built it ive got to say that i really like it its my favorite helicopter of all of the ones ive built its sturdy and sleek its not too bulky either the first play feature in this set is the net launcher it works pretty well not one of my favorite features but it does what its meant to do the other play feature is on the other side its a stud shooter which can be used by a minifigure you can put it on their hand or you can leave it there and let someone operate it the shooter can fold up inside the helicopter as well there are stickers on both sides of the helicopter and they also have the jurassic world logo with dino marks final verdict value 910  for 20 this set isnt that bad the parts count is a little low for a 20 set but the price is probably because of licensing other than that its a great deal i wouldve hoped for maybe some bait for the pteranodon but that can easily be fixed design 910  i really love the way this helicopter looks its sleekness and design is great the only flaw this has is the huge net launcher its too big in my opinion minifigs 1010b  the minifigures are extremely detailed and it even includes an exclusive minifigure playability 910  there are many things you can do with this set the swoosh factor is great and so are the play features parts 1010b  theyre useful parts and there isnt many huge specialized pieces in here either overall 910  this set is great for fans of jurassic world its also a nice parts pack theres one exclusive minifigure in here too which makes it even better having a little fun with the set hope you liked my first review here on eurobricks please leave any suggestions on what to improve thanks edited by thelazychicken 02 may 2015  1019 pm	positive
thanks for the review i really like this set i love the acu minifigures and the dinosaur is really nice i think the helicopter has great potential for a shield helicopter only suggestion is that some of your pictures are a little bit dark especially the box front one but really good for your first review thanks a lot	positive
i love the dinos in these sets but aside from that the builds imo kind of suck just like the last dino sets this just has a franchise connected to it and honestly i hope it does well enough to spark more dinojurassic parkworld interest because i want to see more dino minifigures maybe a brontosaurus or something i will most likely be buying many of the dinosaur minifigures here however i doubt ill buy the actual sets or the genetically altered dinosaur which can only work for jurassic world this set is imo average love the dinosaur	negative
robin creations on 04 may 2015  0207 am said nice review although that picture of the ad reminded me of how some of the things surrounding jurassic world lego that is seems hastily put together just look at that the minifig he is star lords head and hair indiana jones torso with different arms and city legs to me that seems a bit weak especially for a video game oh yeah i just noticed that	neutral

reviews for this set really should picture them next to the bike shop  cafe which its intended to be compatible with right down to the size of the baseplates and grey tiles around the edge it doesnt look that great on its own but if you add the two sets together you get something that begins to look like a street scene	positive

thanks andy0306uk your very clever strategic decision to serve us with blurry pictures allowed me to glance at this review without ruinating that whole wonderful advent surprise too much p y but although i loved the last years one i think they could do another theme or perhaps even two calendars because right now castles pretty hot imo	positive
thank you andy for your speed review y so theres nothing left to open while advent  i like all the tiny sets it neednt be another police and fireman   but well what would an advent calendar be without them d one thing about the train traffic lights tlc used to give us similar lights but you could show either of the lights with the other one being covered that one was waaay better  just a little piece more would have done the thing and i wont mention the radarcrapdish x let me quote franz beckenbauer is denn scho weihnacht legendary quote from an promotional job he did years ago  is it xmas already	neutral

thanks andy for the review i prefer the city advent calendar 2006 a lot those mini sets are nor good for me the road subtheme sets are nice but the others not so good the 05 version waf ok the 06 version was better with bigger sets and more building ones and the 07 is poor its just 23 pieces to put together on 2x4 plates where are the gardening accessories where are some nice small constructions that you can put in your layout like a mailbox or an orodator and the chrismas tree looks x imo and no santa y for andy n for this calendar	negative

im a big fan of anime and have watched some mechas like full metal panic neon evangelion genesis it is a mecha and chobits well she is a robot so i was curious to see what this new exo force line was all about the colorful sets and mangalike characters didnt persuade me right away but the urgent need for a couple of white 3x3 wing plates made me purchase this little thing it cost me 70 dkr as you can see on the box this is 930 euro or about the same an american has to pay for the new republic cruiser pretty expensive for so few pieces 90  a spare technic pin the box an actionpacked box with one of the sides being oddly empty except from the legologo whats inside there is a small building instruction two polybags no bag building here and a sticker sheet with alarmingly many stickers the build it takes so little time to build this set that i didnt get to take any pictures of the process every step was accompanied by an element description although i doubt most of you will need that with so few pieces to keep track on most of the dark green bricks have a sticker  even the slopes where the rough surface makes stickers fall off easily there should also have been a sticker on the windshield but i wanted to keep that piece clean for better usage later im one of those who keeps stickers on the bricks the model you want to see this model from the front as the back is pretty much neglected there isnt much for the pilot to grab a hold on either he is pretty much a sitting duck up there with the screen giving him only partial cover there is a huge wrench next to him which kind of symbolizes the crudeness of the mech the set isnt called cyclone defender for nothing the right arm might hold an ordinary light assault riffle but the other has a spinning disc with samurai swords which you can turn with the yellow knob on the backside those of you who have seen robot wars might remember the incredible power of this melee weapon from a robot named hypnodisc it would have been nice had there been a pullback motor to power the disc im sure lego has a lot of these in stock but the simple mechanism still works reasonably well the riffle comes off and a pin makes it easy to hold with the hand but the disc is fixed to the arm it is also a problem that the swords get misaligned quickly during play the minifig i really like this minifig because of the neat idea with an expression on each side that lego has made a standard for exo force posability most mechmocers show off their creations using gundamlike poses with two joints per leg one being the ankles and one for an arm i thought of some less serious poses crawling silent like a ninja belly gliding kick off upside down final rating i have to disappoint you here this is my first set in this line and i have absolutely no idea of how good it is the last robot i bought was the awesome 6889 spyrius recon robot for the same price but it is in a completely different genre the set had what i expected two white wings and is as such a nononsense set i guess it would be of more use if you have some more exo force which i dont 610 ups has great minifig weapons and is easy to build downs crude design and a bit too expensive for what you get brickshelf gallery	neutral

thank you sinner for bringing the pictures of the hovercraft i think it is a really cool model but the steering wheel doent work too well it doesnt turn easilly all the way around and when the craft turns it doesnt stay stable on the three wheels because the front wheel turns quite alot into the opposite side now to the third model this is quite a basic helicopter with the functionality of having the rotors turning it doesnt use that many of the bricks and doesnt even have a landing gear i have a question to all of you as you can see i prefer to show one or two large pictures and have the rest as clickable thumbnails most people use only the relatively big typically 640x480 pictures so that you dont have to follow links what do you prefer it is no problem for me to do it the other way but i would like to know if you have any preferences	neutral

3499 is not too shabby the big guy itself is nice but the gem of the set is the mech really nice mech i must say great for posing the mini figs suprisingly nice little buildvehicle never seen this element beforeits probably nothing new though lol no articulation of the legs nooooooo phew the front two legs do articulate would of been bad if they didnt overall i give the set 7810 not the best but its actually quite nice and the yellow mech is awesome if it was him on his own then 9410 cheers	positive

it is no secret that marvel is one of the most successful companies right now from the avengers to the xmen and down to even the most obscure characters like antman every one of their movies has been a big hit until now the latest marvel movie fant4stic was released last month and while i have not seen it yet im sure its just as great as their other movies i mean it has the word fantastic in the title after all and being the smart business that they are the lego company decided to get in on the hype early and capitalize on this movies undoubtful success two years in advance by making a set featuring fant4stics main villain dr doom now thats what i call forward thinking but did they do a good job with it or were they being overhasty lets find out set number 76005 name spiderman daily bugle showdown theme marvel super heroes subtheme ultimate spiderman year of release 2013 pieces 476 minifigs 5 price 4999 usd sh description quote swing into the daily bugle and stop dr doom™ dr doom™ and his henchman beetle™ are attacking the daily bugle in their speedy jet to steal spidermans™ secret identity its up to spiderman™ and nova™ to swing in and stop them trigger the daily bugles explosion functions to cause destruction as the jet fires missiles stop dr doom™ from hitching the jets anchor hook to the safe with spidermans secret inside knock beetle™ off the building with the swinging web attack and drop dr doom™ inside with the rooftop trapdoor then fly nova™ in through the broken window with the dumpster catapult function and send those villains back to where they came from includes spiderman™ nova™ dr doom™ beetle™ and j jonah jameson™ with accessories and weapons the first thing that comes to mind after reading this description is wow thats a lot of tms anyway here are some resource links for this set brickset bricklink rebrickable the box since this set is based on the ultimate spiderman cartoon the box has the usual usm design with the red marvel super heroes background an illustration of spidey in the upper right corner and the usm logo in the lower right as usual there is a minifig line up in the lower left and since this was before the terrible redesign you can see the full body of the minifigs i really miss this type of line up there is quite a lot going on here doctor doom attacking the daily bugle in his jet while simultaneously reaching for j jonah jameson below with his jets claw spiderman reluctantly swings in to save him while nova fights off the beetle its a pretty cool scene even though its not very accurate to the show in beetle mania the episode that this set is based on the beetle was indeed out to kill jjj but it was in order to stop him from exposing his identity not spidermans although spidey was next on jjjs list and while he is a recurring villain on the show doctor doom had nothing to do with this plot and didnt even appear in the episode aside from a brief cameo its awesome that they included him anyway though so im not gonna complain note that the tower is so tall that it wraps around the top of the box there you can also see a scale reference with the spiderman minifig on the back of the box you can see the interior of the bugle and all of its play features which there are quite a few of since this is a playset its all illustrated pretty well although legos choice of sound effects is still a mystery to me i dont get why they dont go for spidermans signature fwip instead of fazzing and i didnt know that a breaking window made the sound btoom but i digress contents inside the box you will find three instruction booklets one smaller than the others a comic book a fairly large sticker sheet five numbered bags and two loose pieces a white string piece and a gray 16x8 plate there arent really any notable pieces and nobody cares about the comic bock no offense to the artist so lets get right to the instructions they are pretty straight forward and easy to follow some of the pages have a ghostly image of spidey nova and dr doom in the top right corner which is fitting since these are all minifigs that appear in this set which is strangely not something that can be said for many other super heroes instructions with this type of artwork minifigures as with most super heroes sets most people will get this set mainly for the minifigs so without further ado lets talk about them spiderman is the same old bootless one you get in almost every usm set not much to say about him some might complain that we dont get spideys alter ego peter parker in this set but in the usm cartoon mj is actually the one who works at the daily bugle not peter curse the creators of this cartoon for ruining our chances of getting a new peter parker minifig by trying to mix things up next we get j jonah jameson he appeared in a spiderman 2 set before but this is a complete redesign he now has a blue suit with a red tie a unique face print and that combedback hair in dark gray this new hairpiece doesnt suit him at all and the old flat top hair was perfect for him in my opinion so i dont know why they changed it the good thing about this change however is the fact that this piece is exclusive to this set in that color nova on the other hand is spoton he comes with a new helmet mold and some nice torso printing however he too is missing his boots tlc should have started making dualcolored legs a long time ago here are some reference images to compare them to okay so jjjs hair may not be completely black in the show but i still think they should have given his minifig a black hairpiece his suit is also not quite the right color he rarely appears in person in the show including the episode this set is based on and is usually seen on screens around new york so this is the best picture of him i could find i guess i should be happy they included a minifig of him at all in the episode it was actually mary jane who was at the bugle during beetles attack so it would have made more sense to include her but we got her in the spidercopter set one year later so thats ok all three of them have back printing in jjjs case im using that term loosely since it is only comprised of two lines but its nice that they went through the trouble of adding them both jjj and nova come with angry alternate faces it almost looks like theyre trying to outangry each other who do you think looks angrier let me know in the comments section below now lets talk about the bad guys even though he would be better off in a fantastic four set its great to finally get victor van doom one of the greatest marvel villains ever and in comics in general he comes with a dark green hood which was new and exclusive in that color at the time and he is the only minifig in this set that has leg printing beetle is a regular minifig with wings the metallic printing on his face and torso is pretty nice but i wish it would have continued onto his legs as well the beetle looks quite accurate to his onscreen counterpart the only thing that could have improved him is a new helmet mold with pointy eyebrowsantennae doctor doom however looks nothing like he does in the movie i just dont understand how lego could have messed him up so badly maybe they were working off of early concept art or something here is a back view of doom and beetle beetle would be a pretty boring minifig if it wasnt for his wings which are awesome with their holographic texture they are so mesmerizing i could look at those things all day this piece also appeared in trans light green in the galaxy squad sets which came out at the same time here they are without their gear as you can see they both have back printing as well and no doctor doom does not come with an alternate facial expression which is fine since you cant see much of his expressions due to his mask anyway heres a look at dr doom and nova without their headgear some say that dooms face looks too cartoony but i think it looks fine nova is wearing stylish goggles as a way of explaining his white eyes its a far better explanation than the batsweatband they did the same thing with the masked wolverine later here are all the figs with their accessories jjj comes with a camera so that he can take more pictures of spiderman beetle comes with one of those overused adu guns which is a very poor representation of his wristmounted blasters i hate to say it but even those bulky new stud shooters would have been a better representation of his weapons spidey comes with his usual string of webbing and nova comes with some iron man style translucent studs the weird thing is that they are red while his powers have a blue glow in the show doctor doom sadly doesnt get any accessories but who needs weapons when you have a jet with a claw and flickfire missiles the build the first bag contains spiderman a brick separator and the parts to build the ground floor of the dbc building after a quick and straightforward build you get this the dumpster and street lamp are separate from the building and since the lamp post is not built onto any baseplate and is quite topheavy it gets knocked over pretty easily maybe its meant to be that way but i would have preferred it if you could stick it onto the baseplate of the building on which there is unfortunately not enough space to do so as you would expect the second bag has the parts for the first floor of the building this is also the bag that contains beetle after another fairly simple build youll find yourself with a two story building with a spiderweb one side and a fire escape on the other however you have to apply three stickers during this section of the build which is never fun can you guess whats in bag number 3 yup the second floor of the building you dont need superpowers to predict that one also this bag contains nova and jameson the build of this section is a bit repetitive since the second floor is mostly the same as the first and it takes slightly longer to build since you have to build the rooftop as well also in addition to the two window stickers you have to apply ten 2x2 tile stickers trying to do this without having any of them being crooked is a real pain in the megablocks the next bag contains doctor doom and the cockpit of his jet dooms cape is in the usual square white box and the string for the claw is folded up in a piece of tape heres what you get at the end of this section looks more like an escape pod than a jet at this point the final bag is the smallest as it only includes the few parts needed to finish the doom jet once you build the wings and tail you stick them onto the cockpit via technic pins and youre done spare parts these are the parts that are left over after the build there is the brick separator of course an extra antenna and the usual little bits and bops whats really awesome though is that they give you an extra pair of beetles wings considering what a neat piece this is and that this is the only set in which it comes in transblack make this a very welcome spare that you can use in your customs the finished set here is the complete set the dbc building looks quite tall especially when you count the antenna comparing it to a screenshot from the episode the general look of the building is there although there are some inaccuracies aside from the fact that it is obviously way downscaled the screens that show jjj ranting about spiderman should have been hexagonal not square and should have wrapped around the building however considering how many stickers you would have had to apply if they would have made it accurate im actually glad they kept the screen mercifully small much like doctor doom himself the doom jet didnt actually appear in the beetle mania episode however it did appear in a later episode titled not a toy in which spiderman plays around with captain americas shield accidentally drops it in doctor dooms latvarian embassy and has to try to retrieve it and yes that episode was as godawful as it sounds heres a screenshot of the jet from that episode like with the dbc they managed to capture the general shape of the vehicle although it doesnt look quite as good as in the show the color scheme is too dark and it looks kind of blockier lets take a closer look at the jet there is no real way to reel the claw in unfortunately however there is a stud on the back of the jet that you can stick it onto needless to say this is not the ideal way of storing it i would have much preferred it if they would have attached it onto winch instead the engines on the wings can be turned even though they dont turn in the show and there is a flickfire missile on each side even if its not much to look at at least its a very swooshable vehicle on top of each wing there is a tile with the emblem of latvaria there was no such emplems on the jet in the cartoon but they are useful pieces that make it clear whose jet it is so im glad they included them there is nothing inside the cockpit except for a seat and unless you want to ruin dr dooms nice dark green cape i wouldnt put him inside of it they could have at least printed a control panel onto that empty 2x2 tile play features since this is a playset lets look at all the play features it has to offer like all playsets the building is open in the back so you can play inside on the ground floor there is a potted plant and nothing else seriously is this all they could come up with for this floor they could have included a security desk a lounge a second plant or anything else as it is its just a boring empty lobby the first floor is a bit more interesting there is a safe a swiveling chair and a pin board with various pictures of spiderman there is one tile that reads the true identity of spiderman which is supposedly what the villains are after i wonder how jameson got this information in the first place speaking of jameson the second floor is devoted to his office where he can sit and yell at his nonpresent employees demanding more pictures of spiderman it also has a swiveling chair as well as a desk with a lamp and a computer there is a technic beam connecting his desk with the ceiling of the first floor which you can remove in order to take off the upper half of the building but its difficult to do so i dont recommend it as you may have noticed in the picture above there are a few red pegs sticking out of the building these are for triggering the play features most of them are on the roof there is one on what looks like an air conditioning unit if you place spiderman holding is webstring on the jumper plate in front of it and push the peg spidey goes bungeejumping off the building wee there is also one that sticks out of the side of the building which when pulled triggers a trap door the third red peg on the roof can be used to pop off the dbc sign why is it called the dbc you ask it stands for daily bugle communications since in this version of spiderman the daily bugle is not only a newspaper but a news tv station as well one that promotes its own highly biased views so basically the fox news of the marvel universe i guess if youre an old school spiderman fan you could just leave off the c and have it just stand for daily bugle the sign above the main entrance wont be so easily modified however there is also a peg between the first and second floor which when pushed pops out one of the windows on the first floor the safe is only attached to a couple of jumper plates and has some jumper plates on top of it as well so you can easily attach the doom jets claw to it and rip it out of the building as seen on the back of the box there are also some snot bricks on the corners of the building that you can attach spiderwebs or spidey himself onto for some wallcrawling and webslinging action this is not so much a play feature as it is just a feature but as i mentioned earlier there is a fire escape on the left side of the building this was a neat idea as it helps it feel like a building in new york city but it is executed very poorly there is no hole big enough for the minifigs to climb down through so they would have to climb down the ladders from the outside which makes no sense no wonder spiderman always needs to rescue people from burning buildings there is one more play feature in the form of the dumpster you can open the lid put a minifig inside and make them jump by hitting a tab in the back remember this is before the introduction of super jumpers but nevertheless its a pretty strange place to launch minifigs out of i guess even super heroes like to do some dumpster diving you dont think this was funny no well me neither but thats the type of humor that this show loves to use sigh anyway lets get on to the ratings ratings design 25  the set looks ok despite many inaccuracies the dbc building and the jet somewhat resemble their onscreen counterparts and dont look too bad but they definitely could be better build 15  a mostly unchallenging and repetitive build with an attrocious amount of stickers minifigs 45  definitely the strongest point of the set some of the figs could be better but four out of five of them are exclusive to this set doctor doom is easily the best and probably the most desirable one  unless the fant4stic movie portraits him so badly that nobody will be interested in him but thats impossible playability 45  as you would expect from a playset the playability is quite high although i still feel like there could have been more parts 35  not many rare parts if youre looking for parts for building your own skyscraper with tan walls and lots of doors and windows though this set is for you price 35  at 476 parts for 50 this set is a bit pricey but it is somewhat justified by all the large window and wall pieces overall 35  this set is mediocre at best playsets are always a good choice for spiderman sets since they give spidey something to swing from but unfortunately they are rarely pulled off well the jet is blocky the building is barebones and the price feels too high the only reason to get this set are the four exclusive minifigs this set was discontinued early this year but if you still see it on clearance somewhere go ahead and get one for the minifigs and parts or buy multiples and use the parts to build a better dbc building i hope you enjoyed this review it is part of the reviewers academys 7th anniversary were not doing a big celebration this year due to other commitments but look out for more reviews with the 7th anniversary

overall i wish marvel in particular would have more playsets in its theme batman has several great ones in the dc theme but then again if this is the best playset to date for marvel maybe its better just to leave well enough alone i would definitely like to see them attempt something in the 100 us price range because i think it could be good marvel needs an equivalent to the arkham asylum set regarding this set i saved myself some money and bought the 4 minifigs i needed all but spidey on bricklink for less than half the set price edited by dmarvin 17 september 2015  0625 pm	neutral

this set seems to appeal more to the non superhero crowd it is one of the only marvel sets i bought mainly because i thought that the building was a nice return to the old style of city sets i would love to see this sort of backdrop for a more realistic agents theme i also liked that most of the figs in this set were easier to merge into other nonsuper uses thanks for the review god bless nathan	neutral

thats awesome man lucky that you got it i want it so badly and it has a huge box too zots	positive
the manual the gigantic manual measures 17 x 12 and is almost an inch thick it is spiral bound with a cardboard like front and back and it is 314 pages interesting decision not to break it up into multiple manuals it is almost unwieldy at this size and thickness unfortunately the manual is not available electronically from the lego website hopefully it will be soon missing were the little instructions at the beginning telling you to not build this beast on shag carpet and to sort out the 5000 pieces before you get started i guess they figure if you got 500 to spend on this thing you can build it however you want as usual we get the regular lego manual features  piece call outs for each step  parts inventory at the end of the manual  page numbers  photos of all the other 2007 sets at the end of the manual manual paperback book provided for scale various manual photos 8x8 plate provided for scale im about 2 hours into building and sorting im trying to stay a day ahead in my posting the build has been easier than i thought so far despite the massive number of pieces it has not been too hard to sort and find what you need build photos will start appearing in tomorrows entry	positive

my gawd that manuel is huge thats enough to put a sane man off of buying this setthank gawd none of us are sane thats all i can say xd just how many technic pins does this monster need 8 judging by that one pic theres gotta be a lot in this set	negative
xwingyoda on sep 28 2007 0734 am said tks for that comparison pic dunamis  ok the box is big  i pictured it a tad smaller though  yoda i dont have the ucs isd but from the pic i can see that it is about the same thickness slightly shorter but much wider than the mf so this leads me to believe that dimensionwise the ucs mf is more compact also notice how in the content the parts fit in just nice without additional spare space for anything else strange isnt it that when tlc is responsible for the shipping we see optimum usage of box spaces xd imagine if all boxes were this efficient 499 sets would be no bigger than a match box xd xd the mtt would be reduced to 14 its current size xd xd xd	neutral

thank you for the review sinner at first i wanted this set for the 4 blue 1x1 slope tiles but i can see there is much more into it than that it sure is a great value compared to what you get in the building bonanzas no cars and less detail it was funny to see the little side story in your pictures would it be hard to modify the cars to fit minifigs better	neutral
a beautiful and humorous review with very fine pics y a fantastic set full of neat details and in a wonderful color scheme great for every city builder for sure i guess we waited for sets like that we dreamed about them im glad we got them now  edit congrats it seems youve got your bucket back p	positive

excellent review with great pics and cameo appearances by some of our eb favs y definitely a set that was on my to get list already and this only confirms that might make me want two just because i love tan so much and id like to see if something could be done to bulk up that car great job as always 	positive
thank you very much for the review sinner i definitly wub this set this will make a great addition for us townies i thought the size was too small i plan to make my house fit practically the whole baseplate plus i will definitly add floors that looked d  i cant believe tlc skimped on the floors	positive
thanks for this review sinner i love this house with the nicely made tiled corners the colorscheme and the garage the only thing i dislike about this set is the way the windows are attached in train windows so they turn inwards a little instead of the usual frames with shutterattachmentability but that is something that can be fixed in the blink of an eye i will certainly buy this house some day when i find it at reasonable price	positive
thanks for the review sinner y  although we had a not very detailed one already p i bought this set at tru with 20 off resulting in 54 xd definitely a must buy for every townie you get tons of useful parts to build other buildings as well shameless selfpromotion off  you have to love tan bricks though 8 moc on	positive

remember when i said in my review of 7090 to expect a review after i went to toysrus well somehow things didnt work out but fortunately im finally reviewing my latest purchases starting with 7091 catapault defense which happens to be one of the best sets in the castle line the box and instructions lego box art is at its highest point ever these days with lots of special effects and great action poses the castle theme is no exception and 7091 isnt either ill let the box speak for itself i love the back of the castle boxes as well since they give another action scene and other neat info like a layout of all the accessories the contents only the bare essentials as usual piece bags and instructions i seriously wish they still put mini catalogs inside sets like they did when i was young but i guess they are too expensive to make or something ah well cant have everything no picture of the instructions this time but since that isnt necessary ill just say that they are fine and do not have a problem with distinguishing dark gray from black the pieces heres your basic shot of every piece included minus a few extra pieces like an extra viking horn and black skeleton leg not too shabby for a 10 usd set theres a lot of nice pieces in 7091 as you can see and this doesnt include the accessories or minifig parts the brown plates wheels and spoked things are always useful and the dark blue and gold slopes are really cool however theres also a fair amount of technic in here so be warry as usual for the castle line 7091 has a heaping helping of accessories most of them are old pieces recolored but the ball on chain whats the actual name could someone tell me and the shields are brand new i actually like the new skeleton weapon since its fairly detailed and was really the only way tlc could make a part like that and yes the shields are printed quite nicely too if i do say so myself plus you get viking horns always useful to have a grey boulder a basket and 3 helmets not a half bad deal eh oh who am i kidding  its awesome minifigures ah yes one of the highlights of any castle set you get 2 soldiers and 2 skellies this time all with different weapons the two soldiers are just regular crown troops with different faces  nothing special except that they are awesome anyway the skeletons on the other hand are much more interesting an archer and a black skellie archers cool of course but i know many dont like the printing on the black skeletons well let me say that i dont mind it so much the only real problem is that the eyes are dark red instead of just red which makes the printing a bit less noticeable and ive been through it before that the new skeleton molds in general dont bother me at all  go skeletons the finished set alright theres two builds in this set and ill start with the smaller the skeleton barricade okay so its nothing special but its cool all the less the shield on the front and the slanted spears are nice touches heres just how the skeletons can tower over their own barricade with a little step ah the catapault the lovely catapault seriously i love tlcs design very effective and also very realistic especially compared to kk love the side details and the swiveling base and you gotta love the clever use of that basket playability yes ive made it a tradition now to write stories for any castle set i buy and this isnt the last one you can be sure of that heres one featuring everything in 7901 oh and heres a small ship i made out of all the pieces in this set plus a couple extra figures and weapons from my copy of 7901 not half bad imo considering what i had to work with overall rating presentation 910 pieces 810 minifigures 910 finished model 910 playability 810  final score 8610 once again i highly recommend the reviewed set castle is possibly the best theme this year and this set is one of many that prove it as with all castle sets its best if you buy several if you want to truly enjoy it but this set alone is also impressive in both design and pieces and minifigures get at least one if you have even a slight liking for castle edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0131 pm	positive

i just got this today it is amazing like my other two castle sets the joust and the crossbow i am currently starting to save for 2008 but for christmas i think i want the skeleton carridge and the naboo n1 fighter	positive
thanks for a great review first of all i do like the upgrades and changes made from the original 2009 set more colours and parts are offcourse available today than back in 2009 it does look like a great set and i would really realy have loved to get it myself if i had the funds however their are so many other sets thats first priority for me this december and next year so sadly i might have to pass on this if its not that i can get it redicioulusly cheap at some point and yeah we should appreciate that lego does keep sets coming even if its just upgrades from earlier releases town is known for a new police and fire station every year cant see why a new toyshop is so upsetting once again thanks for a great review and happy holidays to you as well	positive
nice to see they finally updated that generic screaming face from the 2007 castle line awesome review oky i have the old set so i wont be picking this up	positive
hobbythom on 29 november 2015  0407 pm said great review you almost make me want to buy one i dont know what it is with these sets on the one hand they are so nicely designed and cute on the other side i never seriously consider buying one i cant explain what it is that holds me back a lack of money maybe thats the thing that usually holds me back anyway i have the older version so i am not interested in this set	neutral
thanks for the excellent review unfortunately it only highlights how minimal the upgrades are though they are nice definitively a pass for me lets hope lego does continue to make the more realistic winter village sets versus santa im not opposed to a rehash the post office could use some improvements for example but this one is just a wee bit minimal	negative
i missed out on the first one but i love the improvements made in this version like the tree having an actual brown trunk so it looks less like an artificial one and the carolers as well i may pick this up but im sorry to those of you who already have one	positive
i bought it and im very happy with it	positive
cheers for putting up the review some nice improvements but not enough for me to pick it up the original set is good enough for me pity the poll has no option yes but only in addition to new sets not in stead of new sets edited by withacee 01 december 2015  0938 am	neutral
thanks for a nice review i am building it as we speak and i like it so far since i didnt have the old one i cant complain	positive
thanks for the review they definitely improved upon the original but since i already own the original i cant justify this set also unfortunately it seems to be the trend but im sure there are a lot of first timers out there too that will snatch this up since it is a really lovely building and the updates make it better for sure	neutral
thanks oky for this fine review i agreed with your sentiments on the unnecessary rants i also owned the 2009 version and even though there are minor improvements there must be a logical reason for its release again but is not entirely the same i felt is an excellent opportunity for others to acquire this design especially after six years ago as for myself i will probably buy this if my spare funds allow me to own this set	neutral
oky on 29 november 2015  1145 am said as for the controversy over rereleasing the winter toy shop i can see where the haters are coming from but i find their complaints to be quite petty i can understand if youre disappointed because you already have the first winter toy shop and were looking forward to a new set this year but theres always next year if youre a completist and feel like tlg is forcing you to buy a set you dont need youre wrong nobody is forcing you to buy anything but yourself if you decide to buy every set in a theme no matter what it is thats your problem not legos so put down your torches and pitchforks and just be glad that they improved the set design and gave us another chance to buy this classic set there are far worse things that can happen in this world than lego rereleasing one of their most popular sets sorry for that little rant so what is your opinion on rereleases like this please cast your vote in the poll above after mocking people for holding a particular opinion you then turn around and ask people to express their opinion no thanks i guess ill keep my opinions to myself i certainly dont want to be labeled a hater	neutral
thanks for the kind comments everyone i like hearing your opinions on this set withacee on 01 december 2015  0937 am said pity the poll has no option yes but only in addition to new sets not in stead of new sets i dont think that would be a realistic option as that would mean that they would have to spend twice the resources on this theme which i dont think they are ready to do but if more people would like this option i can add it to the poll joebot on 01 december 2015  0833 pm said after mocking people for holding a particular opinion you then turn around and ask people to express their opinion no thanks i guess ill keep my opinions to myself i certainly dont want to be labeled a hater im not mocking anyone i just think that some people need to calm down a bit and that tlg is getting more hate than they deserve for this set but thats just my opinion and youre welcome to disagree with it everyone is entitled to their own opinion including you and me and yes i would love to hear your thoughts on this matter because i would like to have a friendly discussion on this subject	neutral
oky on 02 december 2015  1249 am said i dont think that would be a realistic option as that would mean that they would have to spend twice the resources on this theme which i dont think they are ready to do but if more people would like this option i can add it to the poll i know but one can always hope cant one i hope the wv theme will be continued in coming years with new sets but given santas workshop and this rerelease i dont get my hopes up too much time to get mocing and reverse engineering	neutral

while i can see kids enjoying this im not sure i would buy the flex axles are nice and it is a decent number of white panels but i think i would get better return out of a larger parts set fantastic review though and your pictures show off this tiny model better than the box art does	negative

hi there nice model great review i almost reverse engineered this model but used wrong parts for landing wheels didnt know how to fix the nose proper and so on so i was very interested in this model and i like playing with it i love the reviews but i think i have to mention that the yellow axle must be a 5l the picture shows a 5l and a 5l would fit the size of the model the cart has also a 5l in yellow what sitze is the yellow axle in this seit really 4l as written in the text greetings robert	positive

very nice review for a nice little set i especially like the smoothness of operation for the retractable landing gear i dont like the lack of symmetry for the propeller of the b model though but understand the alternative would be to add one extra small panel to the set or skip two of them in the b model	positive
good review as always jim when i first saw this set i thought that it would make a great parts pack for me as that i have about 20 white pieces in my technic collection all from 42043 and this set has some really useful ones all for a cheap price those 7l flex axles will be extremely useful in my current build im doing	positive
nice review even with the missing demonstration video of the amodel looks like this is an excellent panel pack for the price and those soft axles will go down a treat will this set be the dark horse of 1h 2016	positive

i got this little set for xmas and i noticed all the gaps and decided to fix them so here it is img5344 by jj2sam on flickr first i added some beams to the wings and top to make it less hollow second i put some navigation lights on it i made the nose a bit wider and added a control panel and lastly i changed out the landing gear wheels to more appropriate ones img5349 by jj2sam on flickr more pictures are here	neutral
thats a cool little mod two small nigles though 1 your navigation lights are flipped on the main wings 2 the panels on the tail i think were supposed to be the intakes for the jet engine by using them to close up the tail youve turned it into a glider cant wait untill i find one of these on shelves	positive
so this set showed up in stores yesterday and i immediately picked two up all in all it is a nice set but it is slightly different from what i was expecting the plane feels a bit flat pointy nose wide bottom etc and while the panels work very well as wings it feels a bit simplistic to just have singlepart wings the stickers really work for it though its a cracking set though nice parts pack and a nice model as well	positive
another great review jim and again i love the model those pearl gold wheels this one definitely goes on the buy on sight list	positive
one hero will now have just enough of that pullback motor to create one ultimate machine thanks to this	neutral
jim great reviews but can i suggest you one thing take some pics before you apply the stickersand some with the stickers on it helps to have a comparison	neutral
jim on 01 december 2015  0934 am said you are right i came to the same conclusion when writing the review i tell you it doesnt look that good without stickers but i dont have a picture to prove it to be honest i compared it to the model posted in the 2016 topic a few days ago i applied the stickers before building the model so i wasnt able to make a proper comparison i will keep it in mind for future reviews thanks for the suggestion youre welcome im not a huge fan of stickers for 2 reasons i do reuse all the parts normallyand also i believe a model should look great even without stickers then obviously they can be a plus but only afterwords anyway im enjoying the reviews as usual and those pics thanks for making them jim	neutral
not sure what people like about this set i think its the worst of all 1h2016 sets odd shape bland colors no new parts and the windscreen isnt even closed but the reviews are great indeed 	negative
are parts 62462 in flat or metallic silver	neutral
first thing i thought hot wheels whut the set looks like the hot wheels bone shaker	neutral

thanks for the review i wonder if the design inspiration came from the russian ka32 helicopter	positive
i was waiting especially for review of this set let me add few things about this thing it all will be complainging of person who works with these type of machines so if you just want a unusual machine in your collection ignore my complaining  i see underground loaders almost every day and believe me this model would now work in the underground mine first of all its cab should stick out more from the frame each loader has cab placed out of the chassis to provide better view for the driver in this class of machine it would help a bit but in low loader ones it is extremely important this is the view from the cab of a low profile loader looking at front  and yes front of the machine is where engine is placed because at least at kghm all machines drive engine forward another thing about that cab is that seat and steering wheeljoysticks are placed perpendicularly to the machine chassis to provide same view for driving forward and backwards so another weak spot of the set the model lacks of trans clear lights on the engine part because all machines that work underground have same lamps on front and back another thing that comes to my mind is that warning light and antena would not live too long in the mine becuase it could be torn apart by ramming into tunnels roofs it does resemble shape of underground machine but not a loader only machine that comes to my mind is something that are used for movingplacing hydraulic support jacks in tunnels sorry for poor quality i didnt find better picture of it it does have claw four wheels and articulated chassis but have much greater range of movement of the arm anyway id give it at least 35 for overall look model itself as a set looks unfinished or cut down on pieces after visit of an accountant for me it looks like engine part was built differently with knobs for steeringclaw operating sticking out from back claw needs almost seven full turns of the worm gear to close from opened position and is rather annoing to use it in way it is built in this model bracket that holds bevel gears responsible for steering is rather loose being hold in place by single 34 pin on the other hand the steering works very well it seems that lack of differential will be more common in lego sets becuase it is another model that have fake engine driven by single wheel like in old russian rc cars i am ok with that but it is a pitty that this model has only r2 engine thing that i do not like the most in this model is how the claw arm works first of all it barelly lifts the claw of the ground the movement could be much better and it has major design flaw  universal joints are not placed in line with articulation points and this is main reason of 5l axle not being suported on both sides under the turntable while rainsing the arm it bends a little i really would like to see this model built differently with normal bucket and better range of movement edited by mlonger 05 december 2015  1108 pm	negative
excellent review worth waiting for the set itself is very interesting looks like it may have one interesting build techniques thanks for the review andy ad	positive
think this is the only 1h set ill be getting guess im waiting for 2h for the rest of the construction stuff this set looks okay to me it includes the instructions for both models which is cool and includes some great parts i like that its not just another bucket loader and that it actually tries something different too	positive
great review one thing reaaaaaally bothers me about this set both models have the engine connected to one wheel the other wheel on the powered axle is just left to rotate freely and that really bothers me as it did in 42022 on 42022 even more tbh since its main feature is being a frigging car looking at the pics it isnt even a space issue as it was in the hot rod where they needed to route the steering through so they just cheaped out and didnt bother fitting a diff in there or even a live axle link im not very interested in this set not into construction stuff but i think this is a worrying trend 	negative
thanks for review mostlytechnic not a must have for me but this set have nice assortment of parts new turntable new panels i like yellow and if ill buy two of this sets  ill get enough wheels for proper 18wheeler and rubber connectors that i almost dont using at all but want to have more and more edited by victor imaginator 06 december 2015  0219 pm	positive

nice mod there effe might inspire me when i get one and start modding it	positive
cool mod by effe but the original model out of the box is one of the poorest models tlg ever released looks from front to rear as a cheaped out set with really lazy design effort a shame for the responsible lego designer parts assortment seems to be ok but this should not be the most important criteria sry jim i really appreciate your always very well done reviews and offen i agree with the overall judgementsverdicts and of course tastes are different but especially that review sounds like gushing praise in my ears just my 2 ct edit ooops just saw the review isnt done by jimblush so sry jim now my final comment belongs to mostlytechnic edited by kumbbl 27 december 2015  0733 am	negative

again great review with superb pictures the white and blue certainly works very well with your dark backdrop thorough review for such a small model small in size but great as a set tell me why did i let you review this one	positive
quote and the dumbingdown continues now they have to show people to compare axle lengths to the 11 prints on the page that have always been there but how does the 11 work on the app might have to look into that for the record i pulled out my phone and tried to find the app in the google store couldnt find it so then i went to the lego website shown on the page and it had a link to it turns out it wasnt showing up because its tablet only so google wasnt showing it to me on my phone ill try again later with a tablet funny thing is that they changed colour of 7l axle to yellow and on that picture it still is in lbg	neutral
thanks for a great review too bad there is only one blue curved panel in this set my opinion on the frictionless axlepins is that the flex axle might be easier to stick in them than in regularblue axlepins didnt actually try it though  edited by majklspajkl 05 december 2015  1146 pm	negative

majklspajkl on 05 december 2015  1145 pm said my opinion on the frictionless axlepins is that the flex axle might be easier to stick in them than in regularblue axlepins didnt actually try it though  frictionless pins have accurate round hole while blue friction pins have something squarish flex axle will fit in both but using tan pins doesnt require strength conncetion with tan pins is weaker too	neutral
great review im a bit undecided on the set though it has some nice parts 4 cil engine in such a small set and it looks good but also a bit small and simple not sure if it stands up to the standards of the small tracked loader or similar for sets of this size and as a parts pack for panelsflaxles the display team jet is infinitely better ill probably pick one up but right now i really want another tracked loader last one was sacrificed to the mod gods	neutral

review  42038  arctic truck introduction arctic vehicles arent new to lego back in 2000 the town theme already had several small orange arctic vehicles in 2014 tlg again released a number of arctic sets in the city theme formerly known as town some of these sets are actually pretty big containing over 700 parts looking back in history it seems that arctic sets may have found their origin in the technic theme although these sets were white instead of orange they are unmistakenly arctic the 1986 technic arctic sets contained the infamous technic figures unfortunately the 2015 arctic truck doesnt contain any technic figures but nonetheless its great to see a new arctic vehicle in the technic line not counting several snow scooters lets see if the new arctic truck lives up to the expectations note all images can be clicked for hires versions set information number 42038 title arctic truck theme technic released 2015 part count 1219 box weight 2110 gr box dimensions 478 cm x 280 cm x 72 cm set price msrp € 7999  us 8499  £ 5999 price per part € 0088  us 0093  £ 0066 links brickset bricklink the box the box measures 478 cm x 280 cm x 72 cm and weighs around 1385 grams the box actually feels pretty heavy which means its filled properly this seems to be a trend in the technic theme slightly smaller boxes can save shelf space for retailers the front the front of the box shows the main model and in the lower right corner theres a image with the dimension of the model its 40cm long and 18cm wide the back the upper part of the back of the box shows the functions of the main model the lower left section shows the bmodel which looks very promising more on that later the lower right section shows the motorization options for the main model the crane partially and the bed can be motorized besides motorization some leds can be added as headlights the side on of the sides shows one of the newer smaller style panels this is the first time it appears in orange when you take a look at the sticker you can see that its not symmetrical not sure why tlg cut of one of the sides of the stickers since the position of the panel is very suitable for a continuous sticker content of the box the box is pretty densely packed which is better than semifilled boxes it feels like you actually bought something which matches the box size the box contains 2 booklets 1 sticker sheet 8 bags booklets  sticker sheet unfortunately the instructions and sticker sheet havent been packed with cardboard protection which results in a curved sticker sheet and slightly bent instructions in my case this wasnt so bad at least no real damage highlighted parts this set proves to be a great parts pack especially when you might have missed some of the 2014 sets black link treads usually the link treads come in dark blue grey but this sets includes 96 black treads which is great if youd like to replace the dbg ones in your mocs or other official sets undercarriage and suspension several parts are included to build the undercarriage driving the treads four large tread sprockets and eight small tread sprockets which are used as return sprockets also included are four steering portal hubs and four steering portal axles for driving and steering the vehicle several frames including two cshaped pivot frames and two steering ball joints to create an undercarriage much like the 4x4 crawler the set even includes two hshaped frames aka dog bone frames new changeover catch parts this year 2015 three new parts have been introduced to improve the changeover catch more on these parts later new pin connector another new part for this year 2015 is the 1l round pin connector which looks like a pin connector but acts more like a bush new pins furthermore this sets includes quite a large number of three relatively new parts 17 x pin with pin hole 14 x 3l pin with 1l axle and 11 x 3l pin with 2l axle which have been introduced this year 2015 when the new 3l pin with 1l axle was introduced in 2014 it was only a matter of time before the new 3l pin with 2l axle would appear both new pins are a great addition to the parts portfolio panels last but not least this sets contains a fair number of orange panels including the 3x11 panel in orange which is the first time weve seen this part part list below is the entire part list for the 913 parts as usual this part list can be found at the end of the second booklet the build the build immediately starts with some of the new parts used to build the compact gearbox in the center of the model notice the two 20 tooth bevel gears one would have been enough to drive the 12 tooth bevel gear so the second seems to be useless tlg probably used it in the amodel because they needed it in the bmodel which you can see later the front and rear suspension are almost identical the front side also has the 13l gear rack used for steering the picture below shows the steering rack on the front suspension in more detail at this point you have more or less finished the chassis the gearbox is in place and the majority of the functions has internally been connected to the right gears the small turntable shows where the crane will be attached later on at the end of the first booklet some of the bodywork has been attached to the chassis the orangeblack color scheme never fails to please me throw in some cool stickers for the extra effect and we have a winner if you decide to motorize the model using pf the top of the cabin can be lifted to accomodate the battery box the chassis uses lots of orange and some black panels to give the model its distinctive look the protective black bumberrailing is a nice addition which adds something to the exterior the dumping bed at the rear can tilt to empty its load its operated by a mini la the treads which look very cool in black are driven by a large tread sprocket and returned by two small tread sprockets the front and rear sections are identical building the undercarriages feels a bit repetitive which is a problem for most tracked vehicles finished model adding the crane to the model finishes the build your model should look something like this when you take a close look at the finished model you realize this is something else its trully a unique vehicle the color scheme is brilliant and the fact that its an arctic truck is really neat its a welcome change for the technic line to see a vehicle like this this picture emphasizes thats its a very cool vehicle imagine this beast plowing through the snow as far as i know its not based on a real life vehicle ifs probably a combination of several vehicles and some imagination i can be totally wrong though the rear of the vehicle shows the crane and drum placed on the tipper bed from this angle you can see some of the internals of the model the gearbox behind the cabin for example the crane can be partially motorized rotation and base while the boom is operated manually what i like a lot is the protective railing around the vehicle left over parts some leftover parts nothing noteworthy features and functions this set has several functionsfeatures steering driving suspension crane tipping bed steering as you can see in the image below the steering mechanism has quite a bit of negative caster please correct me if im wrong which causes the treads to rotate a bit upwarddownward instead of only to the left and right driving you mention driving as a feature yes i do and let me explain why normally i would ommit this as a feature and take driving for granted however driving this vehicle on a flat surface causes it to simply slide over the surface for other arctic vehicles this would be a plus but with a tracked vehicle it limits playability this is one of the main drawbacks of these tread they simple dont work properly on smooth surfaces suspension the suspension is working properly you do need to apply some pressure but all things considered its not too bad crane the crane has four degrees of freedom base rotation lower boom upper boom hook it does what its supposed to do base rotation and lower boom can be motorized and switched using the gearbox while the upper boom and hook are operated manually tipping bed the tipping is operated via a mini la conclusion while the set does offer various functions and features driving and steering is a serious issue therefor this set is more likely to be showcased than to be played with bmodel instructions for the bmodel are of high quality looking at the image below you will see what i mean heres the finished bmodel a tracked jeep with a communcations device this alternate model looks so good it could easily have made it as a main model one thing that does pop in mind how would this look with tires more on that later when you are in the artcic region its imperative to have proper communication channels since theres no internet backbone you will need a big antenna of some sort this bmodel actually features a small trailer wagon with a transmitterreceiver heres more detailed image of the bmodel without trailer wagon i would buy this model in a heartbeat if it were a main model simply gorgeous the side view doesnt give away that this in alternate model the stickers also work really well in this model and again nothing to complain here the model even has a small crane at the rear operated by the mini la here you can see the arctic fleet comprised of both the amodel and bmodel i bet these two can get some work done a bit of a messy picture but this should give you an impression of the size of both models leftover parts not too many parts left which is obviously a good thing alternate model with tumbler tires just like me you probably have been wondering how this model would look like with tumbler tires well here it is as i imagined it does look great admittedly these are not the type of tires we ought to use but to be honest i dont really care again the negative caster results in quirky steering the tires are a bit too big so they hit the chassis when you compress the suspension while this has absolutely nothing to do with an arctic vehicle i really love this picture summary were almost at the end of my review so what do i think of this set lets start with getting the elephant out of the room this set lacks proper driving and steering does that make it a bad set definitely not its a great set but it lacks some playability when it comes to moving the vehicle the crane and tipper bed do work properly so theres still some playability left does this set look cool definitely i think its one of the coolest no pun intended and most original models of recent years the orange and black color scheme works great and the stickers are well designed the bmodel is of very high quality and some might even prefer it over the amodel and if you are not interested in either of these models this set provides you with a variety of great parts all in all i think this is a great set maybe not to play with but it scores high on all other criteria pros original model great color scheme lots of interesting parts great bmodel cons steering and driving dont work too well repetitive build of undercarriages minor con score below are my scores based on different categories 8 design original and good looking model 7 building experience fun to build albeit a bit repetitive 8 features packs quite a few features 7 playability some features work some dont 9 parts comes with interesting parts 9 value for money two great model in a single set 8 cool as a bonus heres picture of the main model with tumbler tires why because we can	positive
i was supposed to publish it together with the 42039  24 hours racer but it somehow got backlogged after completing the reviews for the 2016 sets i felt i needed to finish it was already 90 done that cmodel looks cool	positive
great review i bought this model several weeks ago and the box has sat on my shelf so i think after this i will be digging it out for christmas and i expect my son will have a lot of fun with it when its built ps these tumbler tyres look amazing on this model and indeed amazing in their own right	positive
i think this model is more or less supposed to be a version of this thing a pretty obscure topic but also very interesting	neutral
i could be wrong but i am 100 sure that ive seen this review before	neutral
you switched the sides for the panel with the unsymmetrical sticker otherwise you would see that the cut off part is where theres a beam in front of the panel thats probably done because the beam could possibly damage the sticker either while building or while placed against it for a long time or its simply omitted because it wouldnt be completely visible	neutral
great review and pictures as always its an odd combo but i agree that the b model looks good with tumbler tires therize on 14 december 2015  0932 pm said i could be wrong but i am 100 sure that ive seen this review before i believe jim posted the same one in the reviewers academy	positive
until i saw photos of this set i wasnt convinced i wanted it now after seeing all the combinations ab and tumbler tires i am definitely buying two copies i need orange parts and black treads anyway the only problem i have with this is that its going to encourage me to buy many copies of the drag racer just to get enough wheels to play with	positive

during the annual thanksgiving road trip to the relatives i stopped by the tru in portland or lo and behold the new mars mission sets obviously i bought them  the box not much to say standard box art for mm sets nothing new the parts some good parts here even if you dont like the set which i highly doubt after ive had my say p  its a decent parts pack i noticed that some old parts have been renewed i know the wheel has been used in the 07 sets but the cockpit and hitch i havent seen in a while the vldss very large dss grr new part at least i think it is someone slap me if it isnt wacko the figs i know ive seen that head before but i have no idea where does anyone know i was hoping that the aliens would have new arms at least i was sadly mistaken on the upside i finally discovered that they glow in the dark  the alien has a jetpack if thats not the silliest thing ive ever seen i dont know what is the build simple build a block so easy a caveman cou oh never mind geicos used that one enough then we have this jobber right here not sure what it is but it looks like some crystal scanning device its starting to look pretty nice it almost looks practical the cockpit is suffering from a bad dose of overstickering on the upside we have a new piece there to hold the cockpit on part 1 complete it has a nice little radio antenna which is ruined by the use of a random missile that looks like its going to shoot the antenna before it shoots the alien still i never say no to a good missile i can use for something else the trailer fairly simple but it works it features stabilizing arms a handheld saw and an extremely random minibot whos purpose escapes me the whole meal deal erm general pics overall i thought this was a good set in fact it reminds me of this	positive

great review but am i the only one who thinks this is a pretty homely looking vehicle the small exploration robot is cool but the large windscreen on the main vehicle reminds me about jack stone i also think the bases of the vehicle parts are very basic and look almost unfinished with the holes and such i think i will pass this one even though the alien has a jet pack and there is the nice mini vehicle	negative

during the annual thanksgiving road trip to the relatives i stopped by the tru in portland or lo and behold the new mars mission sets predictably i bought them i present to you the mx41 switch fighter man what a long name the box standard mm on the front it shows the fighter in flight mode and a yellow note telling you that it transforms the back shows three pictures showing it happen the parts once i open the box the first thing that comes out is a bent and rolled up instruction booklet and i was forced to put it under a stack of beer books for an hour then theres the dss yes two of the stickers do feature a cobra i wonder why because this sets decal should be a beatle xd decent parts nothing too special then i noticed this little part its used for the flickmissiles but i have no idea what else it would be used for  the build the alien ship when i looked at the box art for this set i was releived to see that the aliens dont have another curvedforward wing ship instead they have this little beauty which appears to be the alien mini cooper small and hot wub anyway partially completed even if you dont like the set it has some nice green flame peices which work nicely for space laser swords fully completed the only annoying bit about it is that the crystalholding thing in front wobbles all over the place the alien fits into it by way of impalement it must hurt getting in and out switch fighter cockpit the set makes good use of the alpha team cockpit for controls it has a meagre handlebar that the astronaught cant even reach the rear shell of the fighter starts out around the alien containment chamber its a bit odd that the containment chamber has an alien sticker because the instruction booklet lists it as holding crystals the crystal canister is held back by a technic pin this is without a doubt the ugliest color arrangment ever warning mass stickers x the cockpit fits into grooves in the shell then it clicks into place in a 1x1 brick with a horizontal clip the wing mechanism the wing for some reason the body of the mechanism has a blue brick wacko the wing and mechanism connect to prevent the fighter doing a nosedive while in tank mode the wing mechanism completed the underside the body and wing connect by way of a miscolored red brick i have no idea why its red black would bave been much much better completed tank mode all in all this looks pretty neat the wheel base is pretty short but its not bad transform the set transforms neatly if ungainly without antigrav support it would fall forward on its nose each time it transformed jet mode its all right but it could be a bit better the shell keeps slipping back forward to the tank mode because theres nothing to stop it sliding spare parts overall i thought this set was great it could do with some fixing such as the mismatched colors but it should be a definate buy for mm fans brickshelf gallery when available	positive
great review sinner on nov 26 2007 1222 am said well since antigrav doesnt exist and will never exist there has to be another option looking at it in tank mode it does have a vague aerofoil shape so i think it should be able to work as a lifting body all it needs to do then is move fast enough to start taking off and then it can extend the wings 8 this is clearly tlg officially supporting antigrav technologyi mean think about it how can it support itself without antigrav while transforming the answer it cant sweet p	neutral
after seeing this set review it change my mind about this set by the way thanks for the great review	neutral
thanks for that very good review mr mandalorian y i think that this is a plain beautiful set oh how i wish that tlc wouldve taken that direction from the beginning  the design is much more practicable with fewer nonsystem parts and technic beams with studs this makes everything much more easier to mod and a lot more useful at least imo y so its for sure not very hard to make the wonderful enclosed cockpit one brick higher and even that little alien ship looks decent and nice xo and the fighter looks sleek and elegant too in both modes thats just very cool compliments tlc now all we needre aliens with moving arms and here we go classic space on forever xd	positive
wow this is actually quite a neat set it is definitively my favorite in the line after the big drilling unit begingeek im not sure it would nose dive when transforming from tank mode i guess it would pick up speed and transform quickly since it doesnt seem to have any downwards pointing thrusters endgeek	positive
friggin sweet thank you mr mandy for the reveiw of this sweet ship y wub	positive
hmmm i doubt ill be getting this set good review though	negative
i really like the transforming aspect of this the one thing i wish mm sets would include would be baseplates i liked that about the classic space stuff because it really helped create the environment some red rock orange mars baseplates would be great	positive
lasse d on nov 26 2007 0454 pm said im not sure it would nose dive when transforming from tank mode i guess it would pick up speed and transform quickly since it doesnt seem to have any downwards pointing thrusters the one thing youd have to make sure of though is that it was fairly light and the wheel base had a fairly large surface area actually thats two things so as to make sure it didnt dig into the soil if that happened transformation would be harder as the wheels would dig into the ground and drag through the soil then itd nose dive	neutral
great review mr mandalorian y im not a fan of mm and dont like this set much but it has some neat features but the only way i can see it transforming is by racing off a cliff and swinging its wings out wacko to the brickmobile 	negative
john cleese on nov 25 2007 1056 pm said cool review im actually liking that new missile part as it seems to combine a bar with a pin but its a real eyesore if you ask me a needed solution to those blasted flick missles from falling out while swooshing sweet wonder if the range might have an issue seeing its held in there but who knows maybe they now pop out with a greater velocity than a mere finger flick i had resorted to technic 12 bushings smooth to lock in the missiles technic axle with stud	positive

thanks for this fantastic review hinckley i cant wait to see the comic  i really love this mech as i am a fan of nonbipedal mechs though i am terrible at making them the purple is great and i cant wait to see what mocers will use those awesome new spike peices for 3 robots in one mech is a really good deal too and that spider droid just adds so much more to the set and thanks for taking the time to do this sweet not to sound like a smartypants though but the grill peice in purple is not the first time this has happened two were included in the 06 joker helicopter  thanks again to the brickmobile 	positive

thanks for that very neat review hinckley y this set looks indeed very interesting with a very cool antlike look and a simple but essential overall design the cockpit seems better protected than many other ef ones that spines lovely and the way these iron dronesre attached is simple but effective  and hey did i miss something orre there really no crappy shooting devices p thanks to the minirobots and their inventor i guess 	positive
great review y i am sure to get this set for parts now his legs dont look very poseable  thanks hinck vbbn	neutral
great review as always hinckley frankly im in love with this thing so much so in fact that ive been calling it shadow panther for weeks but never mind anyway why do i like it well purple is such a fantastic lego colour its sparingly used which makes it interesting and it simply looks great those jetpackbackpack things the robots are wearing and if they are jetpacks as the back of the box suggests then the use of chaisaws is quite nifty and innovative the minibot is cool and certainly an interesting gimmick sure they dont look quite as good in some of the other sets but here it looks great the overall structure and design are cool too its always nice to see an irregular mech and this is no exception its especially cool whee the spines are concerned plus on top of all that its got a nice selection of parts including some lovely new ones and the inlaid box is interesting well worth getting i think	positive
another fantastic review hinckley i really like this set i wasnt to keen on it when i first saw the pictures bit having seen the review i am starting to like it it seems quite sturdy and it makes a change from the usual 2 legged mechs as well as that purple is welcome anywhere i have such a shortage of that colour i like the rusty orange colour of the robots and their backjet packs are quite cool and the mini robot looks sweet	positive

sinner on nov 28 2007 1253 am said how well do the tracks work the last tank was too light and it didnt roll well at all  its similar in weight but i didnt have to press down so hard to get the treads to move barely at all really i think the mobile defense tank although a better overall design suffered from the odd angle of the treads and that was mostly why the treads didnt turn well plus what was with those weird exhaust pipes anyway they are both cool tanks although i like the mobile defense tank better 	neutral
hinckley on nov 28 2007 0648 am said cool but my reviews are not meant to sway anyone they should just inform people further as if they want to buy it or not i am not necessarily for encouraging anyone to buy every set i review d but im glad you liked it thank you oh i know but without the info i definately wouldnt buy it now im considering it hinckley on nov 28 2007 0648 am said and actually i did feel the same way you did about the flying module until i put sinner in it and started to play heres a sneak peek of the comic and a cool feature of ryos shipit can be configured in a lot of different ways xo  sinner fits in there well im sold xd	positive

asuka on nov 28 2007 0241 pm said for the design i love that asymmetrical look of the front part and the sleek guns of the flyer the asymmetry reminds me of the wookie vehicles in starwars battlegrounds y and i see they changed back to the first color schemes for minifig suits which i think where better than the dark suits of 2007 except for hikarus wub  luxorv	neutral

hinkley you are the man your reviews just keep on getting better and better although all of the sets this year are great and i love them all to bits i cant say there was one that i absolutely felt like something id buy except for the storm lasher but with this review i think this will be the first purchase of 2008 for me i totally agree with you on how the spider looks better without minirobot but from looking at where the cockpit is placed and how the skull on the cockpit is lodged underneath the walker maybe the minirobot would look better mounted underneath the head that way it looks more even and even gives the thing a nasty set of teeth i gotta try it out once i get it cant wait for the fabuland comics keep it up hink	positive

i gave this one a 5 its one of the little pirate sets i had during my youth and i loved it for several reasons first of all it contains 2 of my favorite minifigs it can be used as a small independent base or in combination with one of the bigger sets eldorado or trading posts as a lookup or outer defense besides all that this set just looks beautiful i love the colors blue baseplate and the whiteyellow tower one of the best littlemedium sized sets ever made by lego	positive

its a fantastic set cant think of anything wrong with it to be honest even if the island is a bit small the plate itself is still useful and the rest of it is also very useful walls can go toward a bigger fort cannon can extend your ship soldiers extend your army boat extends err your boats and the island prin is just cool	positive

 i really love everything you did with this gas station it looks very cozy amazing how you said you built it by the book does that mean you didnt have the set but you used your own pieces to rebuild the thing the flourescent lighting is genius and the interior space looks just like what youd see at those little shops i really dig the moc  it gives me good ideas and now i want a gas station of my own p and the history behind how it was rebuilt and how it will improve business etc is so cool wub	positive

i just noticed another inconsistency between box art and the actual set  on the box the biplan has white wing supports theyre just plane windows without glass in them and yet the set they are dark grey or is it bley  can never tell the difference without careful study add to that  the outer of the engine at the front is white on the box and black in the set we dont normally have this many inconsistencies do we 	neutral
this set is so cool and another must buy  im in trouble next year it seems the figs are great wub i think the plane is only ok perhaps they should have made that in a separate set as it needed to be a certain size to fit the figs but that meant that the tail is way too short here is a picture of the actual plane so you can see what i mean notice the pilot is fishing   the temple is another story i think lego have done an incredible job with this fitting in the key parts of this sequence without making an absurdly large model addtionally there are many parts in this set that i havent got so it shouldnt be too hard to justify xd thanks for another great review sweet i love the photo of indy running with the idol and the boulder close behind p naith on dec 16 2007 1020 pm said lol is it just me or in the earlier concepts of this set we saw a native on the box i wonder why they removed it  wacko i recall that too  edit yes there was one big pete on dec 16 2007 1128 pm said we dont normally have this many inconsistencies do we  quite annoying ones too i think the plane looks better with those being white	neutral
because of exams and other obligations i havent posted this sooner seeing that noone else has reviewed this set i thought i might as well do it myself the set in its entire glory minus the slammer instructions and the obviously massive sticker sheet the four cars included in this set a muscle car a sports car a roadster and the police offroader because the police obviously have no clue that an offroader is useless for catching streetracers no less a batmobileish sports car it will always trail behind but the police have a trick up their sleeve  the drawbridge gotcha and the mechanism that makes it all tick the motor is nothing more than a slow pullback motor push down the bridge the latch will hook on to the gear and keep it in place until the latch is released and theres the new gas station staying within theme this gasstation is like the tanker in 8147 from the company fuel 4 speed theres a notable presence of detail here such as the sodadispenser water coolant bottles and other accesories two fuel pumps and bumperlevel railings to prevent cars from crashing into them theres no interior however and as demonstrated here by a loyal octanemployee and a pursuing officer the gas station is built to minifigscale my impressions of this set as a collector of tiny turbos and yet to miss a set i got this one regardless of what it included the gas station is indeed very nice and the minifigscale accesories were unexpected the lack of interior is no big issue and the both the station and bridge can with ease be implemented into a minifig town the bridge also solidly built and includes the ramps in its design so it can be lifted with ramps attached without breaking apart the slammer included in the set is identical apart from the white color with those in 8147 the cars are also very nice altough i am yet to get used to the yellow batmobile as ive grown accustomed to calling it i also love the offroaders chunky tires they make perfect wheels for the newer minifigscale cars i never consider priceparts ratio and here it would for me be irrelevant because it will never be demolished for parts the play value is what i would consider pretty good and while the bridge wont rise with a car on it its still strong enough to stay open with a car tipping over the edge hmm every nerve in my body is saying that this sets is worth roughly 810 so verdict 810 edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0701 pm indexed	positive

picked up from the lego shop in bluewater yesterday front of box back of box price 250 gbp contents a very small instruction manual instructions front intsructions back 25 pieces 23 used in the model regular construction mini fig start of the assembly roll in the drum just attach the drum a little tap with the hammer hammer not included wheel it into position time to start mixing also time for a well earned tea break the cement is all ready now and the 2 left over bits extra cement is always useful and not really wasted overall a nice little set and i am pleased to see little sets appearing again at long last the only negative is with the drum of the mixer although the angle can be adjusted you cannot tip the contents out of the mixer all in all i would say 810 for a good little set comments   edit by hobbes replaced pictures with clickable thumbs and corrected set number	neutral

omg i absolutely love how you reviewed this set i think you are the only person ive ever seen on eurobrick with such a thorough review i read eurobricks daily and this really raises the bar in terms of how a person does a review please do not resize your pics they are perfect crisp large thorough and clear it gives anyone who really wants info on the set just about everything they need to know about it i had no idea they used that lil thing to have the cement mixer spin cool idea   nice set but perfect perfect review thanks much xd	positive

thanks for this review lots of minifigs is a plus although half of them are junk jellies but dang the base just doesnt seem impressive it looks so cheap like a skeleton the tubes are just ridiculous but hey at least it comes with two cool spacecraft thats nice	positive
i agree it does seem very scarce but ive taken apart the nerf launcher made a new module with the tube the launcher used and beefed up the base with some computers and other things for 90 dollars i would pass i agree on sale it is lovely though and none the less ive been entertained for ages with them flyin through the tubes d	neutral
thanks for the review brickmaster this set looks nice i really like the orange wub and white colour scheme although the purple of the lom base was very cool too i only have the lom base if you have it built could you show a comparison on an unrelated note by the time i realised the red and blue hangers on the lom base were for the red and blue mechs the mechs were no longer in stores  i was a bit slow huh p anywho this is one set i wont be buying although if the rocket was sold separately id get that d thanks again y peace	neutral
should be heres the completed base and my knee in cordoroys sp great review	positive
thanks for the photos and review brickmaster im hoping to find this on sale as well no luck so far i love the white ship and i think the base would be amusing but ultimately hard to reuse incidentally that long axel is common in recent technic sets but i think it was orignally made for the hockey sets d	positive

pspguy on dec 27 2007 0308 am said what if your asking how they are but together you snap the window piece into the holder errr no as brikbitz said on his site in the 7732 postal plane review quote you can see the traditional airplane window piece but the bad news is theyve changed the window pane its the new flat piece used in 4996 beach house it just doesnt work as well without the original bevelled edge it doesnt seal the window and there is small noticable gap around the edge not a major problem but it might get a bit draughty inside and certainly no high altitude flying i was wondering if it is the old or new type darthlegois619 on dec 27 2007 0820 am said nice review y i will get 2 of these at the least especialy since theyre going to be 15 aud wub  how did you find out the price if you are right then this is a must buy wub	positive

so here it is the long expected  review of the town plan i bought it at the legostore riem arcaden last saturday i paid 14999 eur for 1981 pieces this set is separated in 4 parts 1 the servicegasstation 2 the cars the petrol pump and the fountain 3 the cinema 4 the town hall the service station has a lot of really nice details like tools for the car repair or the table with the cashpoint and the foodstation theres a croissant a banana and a apple in this set one of my favourit parts is the trolley with some tools you can see it at brickshelf at the second part are only a few pieces and i needed not much time to built the 2 cars the fountain and the petrol pump theres something at the truck i dont understand maybe i did something wrong but the truck has no backlights wacko i like the petrol pump thats why i post a pic of it the cinema is the highlight for me it has also really nice details like the popcorn table or the gumball or candy machine the colours sheme is really nice the front of the building with the big displays is a cool idea overall a really nice building the town hall has also a really nice colour sheme i love that dark green mixed with the white stairs a lot of plants around and in the town hall as you can see some figs who married there not more to say about this building see the pics and enjoy it overall this set is a must have it was really fun to built it this set reminds me of the back to the future movie with michael j fox the whole gallery is at brickshelf there you can find a few more pics i hope you enjoyed this review regards sandra	positive

i enjoyed seeing this review nice to get some different angles on the components sorry to disagree with anyone however but this was not a great review i appreciate the effort sandra made but a great review would include more details such as what are stickers and what are printed pieces a great review points out flaws or limitations as well as what works or is really neat a great review would have analyzed the price per piece and compared that to other setsthemes one might look at the recent reviews of the indy sets or the new spongebob sets as examples of really good reviews the pictures are good but a great review above all should provide the reader with some new information perhaps even answer questions posed in the prerelease discussion thread i learned nothing new about the set from this review that said it was a good review for someone who had not seen the prerelease discussion and she did a good job of showing said person what they could expect in the set	positive
i see the service station has a full arry of tools oxyfuel torch and other goodies not a bad set still very pricey 	positive

kimt on jan 4 2008 1025 am said btw which set would you recommend market streeet town plan or cafe corner just curious theyre pretty expensive and i might only afford one of them definitely the coffee corner its a hard desicion between coffee corner and town plan because they are both really great sets the market street is no must have in my opinion but the other two maybe you should start with the coffee corner its the older set the town plan is newer and will be available longer then the coffee corner i hope it helped you a litte bit  regards sandra edited by legocastlegirl 04 january 2008  1043 am	positive

thanks for the review i really want this set because 1 it looks fantastic 2 has harder to find colors 3 is a 50th anniversary commemorative 4 some of the models are based on the 50s sets i love the old stuff the tanker truck is a perfect recreation of the old ho 187 scale esso tanker truck i have one and you can look at it for comparison if you would like lego ho vehicles id like to modify the truck from this new set to look even more like the old esso truck getting rid of the green and adding some decals	positive
happy new year everyone i went to my local walmart looking for an exclusive bionicle set yesterday but was amazed to find everything there sw bionicle ef indie the works i nabbed the jsf and the rogue shadow and scampered home to take pics with my new camera wub the box the same as the other 07 boxes nothing new the back shows the various features with pop out r2  luckily the intruction booklet and the dss were intact not folded like the last mm set i got  the dss not too bad but printed parts would have been great the figs anakin is amazing imo wub fits the cw anie great i noticed on the sh reviews the kiddies were saying how ugly he looked  they need to see the cw cartoon for the sake of my health i should probably stop reading those d the build i wont go too indepth on the build since vader posted a very indepth review here the start of the build the body of the fighter starts out long and skinny the jsfs landing gear allows it to sit comfortably without getting in the way while swooshing r2d2s launching device r2 in position when launched he often gets stuck if you dont press the button hard enough  looks like r2 needs to lay off whatever it is robots eat so far the flag stickered its a big sucker sticker completed i forgot to add the nose stickers before i took the pic warning the nose cone sticker is actually two stickers i thought it was one peeled of one of the stickers and put it on the middle of the two 1x8 plates and didnt notice the other sticker wacko various completed shots i think this was a beautiful little set r2s launching unit and the flick missiles are annoying but easily fixed i plan to add proper cannons in place of the flick missiles anakin is a great minifig but he doesnt look so well standing next to my other figs the brickshelf gallery when public will	positive

wow im surprised no one had done this already first off this is a truly lovely set that many people should own even though its sold out on the sh   now lets start off with an overview note i was missing a few of the pieces the rabbit the trike when i toke the pics the figs and a cat the engine i really love this thing its a beautiful 060 steam engine with a tender this is probably the most detailed steam engine lego has given us i loved it so much i made a nonholiday version for my town the flat cars i like these but they seem a bit simple their cargo is good for christmas or a birthday party the passenger car it resembles the green passenger car we got a while back but i like the interior in this one a bit better the caboose a simple caboose like the one from 2001 the sad thing about it is thats there is no interior and its hard to take the roof off overall i like this set but it is kind of hard to use during the non winter months the price is kind of good but with that price it should have came with the motor i give it a 910 happy new year edited by agentrick57 04 january 2008  1200 am	positive

i was fortunate enough to get one along with the hobby train they are the first trains i have ever owned mainly by virtue of them having been half price its a fantastic selection of parts with the holiday train as well as it really looking the part as a set im happy not to get a motor as i think the 9v setup would prove expensive and the ir control system for the rc setup seems a bit poor i got some dead track for with it to have just as a push train for now	positive
okie guys and gals here s time for some droid exploration with my review of set 7670 as a general statement i have to say its really a neat set that is not that expensive for what it holds 1 box art like always i will start with pics of the box art btw notice anything guys  no bloody crappy dss yes finally a set without stickers and that feels great d 2 the mfs nothing really spectacular there the only novelty lies within the inclusion of the new commander yellow torso bd apart from that there are 2 bds and unfortunately yet another sbd i like those but i have a huge amount of them and i would rather had something different you have 3 short blasters and a couple of extra parts 3 the spider droid i think its a pretty cool little buggar its a rather simple yet classic construction i think it has sweet parts such as the bd body in dark bley it really has a spider feel unlike the previous ep3 one 4 the hailfire droid this baby represents the pice de resistance of this set i truly love it  sure its a bit under scale but i dont really mind that its conception is superb even if i totally dislike assembling those technic treads especially 80 of those small things the ellipse of the treads is well balanced and that trans disc is a brilliant idea the great thing is those new flick fire missiles they dont fall unlike the other ones and they do look good on this baby also you can put the wheels together and the missiles to gain some shelf space easy storage on d  in conclusion those druids re really sweet and are perfect target practice for the upcoming rgs hehe  i hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any  yoda	positive

great review mate as usual for me the highlight of this set has to be the new spider droid even though its made up of some strange parts it really appeals to me i would love a few of those babys the hellfire droid is also well put together even if it is a little small but hey it looks fun i really like the look of this set but the price tag really puts me off why oh why did lego price it so high 	neutral

great review as weve come to expect from yoda y nice to see that tlg is finding new and interesting ways to get around the no minifig only sets restrictions with hasbro clearly this is another army builder with a minimal vehicle as were becoming accustomed to heck even the diminutive hailfire is technically a droid as well thus making this all minifigs from a certain point of view only negative it is a bit overpriced ill have a better feel for that when i get one treadslinks always drive up a price so it might just be fair the spiderdroid is a winner even with the unusual parts assortment i like it when lego thinks of different ways to use things i think it promotes the same from us im not sure what i think of the new battledroid commanders but at least i can make extras easily if i need to as i bought a bunch of yellow droid bodies off bricklink once thinking i might want to make some kind of new droid out of them they were cheap at the time now i expect the price to go up just because of this potential use between those and the grey ones its good to see more becoming available hopefully well see black and a few other colours produced for some nice customizing possibilities all in all a nice little set with a great army building potential especially on a buyonegetonehalfoff or better type of sale until then ill grab one or two and be glad to have them	positive

great review yoda thanks for sharing i wasnt real fond of the postal truck at first its so different than those in the us but after seeing your closeup images esp the back of the tuck it looks really neat i also like the mail box a lot it looks good in red too bad for the stickers but its still nice the plane reminds me a lot of the design used in the jurassic park set as youve said its similar to 80s designs i really like the brickbuilt design too its just real lego  thats about all i can say very nice sets that are a must together thanks for the review	positive
excellent review you convinced me to buy these two could you tell me how much you payed for them i think im gonna buy them tomorrow if they have it already or if i dont see any cooler sets	positive
i havent spotted these in the us yet im looking forward to finding them overall the 2008 lineup is a excellent and its going to be difficult for me to decide which themessets to pursue theres a lot to choose from	positive
thanks for the great review yoda  im definitely going to get that plane ive sadly only owned one of the many lego planes there is  thebrickster on jan 5 2008 1123 am said i havent spotted these in the us yet im looking forward to finding them overall the 2008 lineup is a excellent and its going to be difficult for me to decide which themessets to pursue theres a lot to choose from really where do you live	positive
nice review yoda i dont think i have ever read one with as much cursing of stickers d i love these two little sets the colour scheme the little different wheels on the post van and of course the new postmen uniforms would have been nice if they had included little satchels like in the new indiana jones sets oh well  postman yoda on yoda	positive
thanks for the takes on these two sets yoda stickers or not i still think these are charming sets with all the essence and nostalgia of the older sets back in the 8090s am i the first one to notice the new doors used in the back of the van not only is it using the popular new frame but the old container doors have been redesigned to fit with the new frame as well pity theyre not yellow though	positive
these little sets are really nice they cought my eye the minute i saw them it would have been so great if there was a post office to go with them there are so few buildings in lego city the design is very classic and i am ofcourse considering to get them but it seems that i have a lot of small cars and planes on my desk  recently i took a flight with cyprus airways from thessaloniki to cyprus and the two promo plane sets were there i was so tired though that i couldnt stay awake to buy them im taking a flight again on tuesday and i hope they are not out of stock thanks for a great review yoda a fine job as always cant wait for your next one	positive
aww man is tlc really getting too cheap for printed parts shame on you tlc despite those stickers these are two really neat sets especially the airplane classic wub reminds me of that little plane my dad bought in an airplane not sure whats the set nr the window at the rear of the van looks like a normal window frame without the clips for the shutters i never knew those existed 8 might come handy for ship building thanks for the review yoda	positive
thanks for the review i was always going to get these two sets so you havent swayed me at all xd i reckon lego could enhance this subtheme by releasing a post motorbike with or without a sidecar and post office obviouly the office would be the hub of all the activity while the post bike would take care of the postal run this would free up the van to take or recieve bulk mail or parcels to or from the airport it could then also do the parcel deliveries around the city the office would also serve as the reciever for all the parcels the new goods truck might deliver just some thoughts thats all sweet	neutral
i need to do some catching up here p matn on jan 5 2008 0516 pm said could you tell me how much you payed for them i think im gonna buy them tomorrow if they have it already or if i dont see any cooler sets i paid a tad more than the sh price i paid 15 for the plane and 8 for the van sure its a tad more expensive but i didnt want to wait for tru to get them freddie on jan 5 2008 0610 pm said am i the first one to notice the new doors used in the back of the van not only is it using the popular new frame but the old container doors have been redesigned to fit with the new frame as well pity theyre not yellow though great remark there i guess i totally missed that one  and i agree that yellow doors would have been better but those dark bley do not look that bad  mr hobbles on jan 5 2008 0910 pm said can you tell me though the wheels on the van are they rubber or plastic they look a bit tacky rubber off course  they do look a tad tacky but its because they are the thin type like with the racers and i am not a fan of those  phoinix on jan 5 2008 0935 pm said cant wait for your next one tks  me neither though p marvinblue on jan 6 2008 0331 am said i reckon lego could enhance this subtheme by releasing a post motorbike with or without a sidecar and post office obviouly the office would be the hub of all the activity while the post bike would take care of the postal run this would free up the van to take or recieve bulk mail or parcels to or from the airport it could then also do the parcel deliveries around the city the office would also serve as the reciever for all the parcels the new goods truck might deliver so true 8 at one point i was thinking of a impulse set with a yellow bike postman post and letters that would rock  i hope tlc adds to this sub theme and keeps that retro feel wub a yellow dirtbike with sidecar would be a sweet 5 set  also a small town feel post office would be so cool like a 2030 set  we can be sure of one thing though this years advent calendar will have a postamn and small post office  post on  yoda	neutral

thanks for a nice review and few comments to sets nice airplane finally some reminiscence for lego city golden era for me years 19821992 everything is nice but two things are freezing a smile on my face first of all the ugly new hinge used for plane roof i have already 4032 and those new hinges are looking really terrible when compared fe with 6368 second one is new minifig i dont know what i expected but this torso design looks too simple and too cheap concerning new car  i appreciate fact that tlc makes after long long years again postal sets but i dont like those newstyle cars matchbox wheels and bad rate between drivers cockpit and cargo space are damping me from buying 6651 mail truck or 105 canada post truck were much better edited by kanalk1 06 january 2008  0733 pm	positive
while the plane does look nice i dont particularly care for the van but the van does have some good parts which is the only reason i would by one yellow mud guards the new windshield and the small door on the rear	neutral
well first off thanks yoda for the great review  hmmm well i have to say im not at all impressed with any of these sets i mean there nice and all but the van just seems way to small it would have been nice if you could fit more than one package in it i guessim one of those that are more of the fan of the 6 wide trucks and the plane hm this has a cute factor and all but i mean comon you have to open a hatch on the roof to get your packages in and what about getting them out you have to flip the plane upside down  weak they should have had a hinged rear end or a hatch on the side	negative
thebrickster on jan 5 2008 1012 am said i wasnt real fond of the postal truck at first its so different than those in the us good point b this design is just too foreign to my eyes for me to enjoy i dont like either of these sets very disapointing  the postal theme has so much potential i dont really like the torsos either  too plaincheap as kanal suggested and i will agree that the wheels on the van look cheap i was sooooo impressed with city 2007 this is a real let down though i am happy to see a small set with a postal box so even though all that aside ill probably buy 6 of the van  just for the yellow mudgards postal box and stickers to populate my city and i think this set will provide some excellent piece to moc a yellow civillian convertable with sweet  bm	neutral
im glad to see the mail van has the doors that used to be on the older cargo containers i had given up on those older ones but now that theyre still out there i may invest in the older cargo system instead of the new 6wide ones both sets are good enough ill get both im hoping for a postal building too even though i have the smaller of the old post offices a nice big modern one would be great im not too hung up about the design of the plane ive got the neat old cargo plane with the tail that swings open one of the best plane sets for big packages the truck is goofy looking but if i get sick of looking at it i can rebuild it into a classic looking one great review by the way the pictures are some of the better one ive seen in a review recently	neutral
5150 lego on jan 6 2008 1108 pm said well first off thanks yoda for the great review  hmmm well i have to say im not at all impressed with any of these sets i mean there nice and all but the van just seems way to small it would have been nice if you could fit more than one package in it i guessim one of those that are more of the fan of the 6 wide trucks i see your point that more cargo capacity would have been better nevertheless my personal preference is for smaller classic scale city sets the mail van is nice and small and should fit well with my road plates and 1990s cars from the 4561 train on a side note did anyone notice the message on the back of both sets boxes designed for easy building and instant play it surprised me a little since these sets seem no less complex than any other city set of late they look like quick builds sure but not as though the designers went out of their way to simplify them	positive
thanks yoda for the great reviews i love the airplane its really cute the van needed to grow on me though but you did the trick i dont like the wheels of the van they will need replacing and wouldnt everything have been better if they were completely red dr brick	neutral
thanks for the great reviews yoda the car looks great y and the plane is very cool too and much more suited to a lego town than the large planes on xd peace	positive
hey everyone my first 2008 set is this one 5613 i thought id share a review of it sweet id like to say sorry about my photos they were taken quickly first we have the box it is the smallest lego box ive ever seen and actually looks cute wub it will be heavy competition with playmobils specials back of the box showing an action pose the contents of the little box with a very tiny instruction manual wub the manual unfolded notice that every part has its part number beside it  the back of the manual showing some fire sets and the other impulse sets the parts 30 in total the small set built the firefighter has a small fire to extinquish armed with an axe chainsaw other saw and foam psssh thing xd  five extra parts in a 30 part set we get an extra black hatchet yellow bar tap light bley 11 plate red 11 plate modified with fingers and 22 dark bley radar dish besides the plate ive never seen these as reserve parts but im not complaining xd here is a small alternate model i created with it a small bbq what hes hungry and he needs to put something on the bbq  xd overall you cant go wrong with these impulse sets i paid 289 euros for this little set so thats a great value sadly the only impulse avaible were these 3 city sets no police and the alien mars mission looking forward to the knight and magician as well as those indy sets tt	positive
cool finally its an entire line i can actually afford to own every set d i cant wait to get my hands on them if its possible could you give us the demensions of the box it would be apprectiated y dp8	positive
beach house reviewed by dunamis set 4996 522 pieces 2995 from target build time 90 minutes yet another interesting creator theme house this one comes fresh of the 2008 line of sets and promises 3 different models packing 522 pieces albeit a lot of 1x1 plates for only 2995 it was hard to pass this one by as i was foraging for the new 2008 star wars sets at the local target plus i was itching to do another review since i had finally fully recovered from my marathon ucs falcon review which took the better part a month to complete the box the box is pretty standard creator type box which shows off the three models beach house caf and towering apartment building the back of the box shows some of the features of the three models interesting features of the three models prominently displayed on the back include  food counter complete with coffee espresso maker and food warmer with chicken leg  home office complete with laptop and the ubiquitous coffee cup  flip up roof granting access inside of beach house note the satellite tv dish and even rain gutters along the roofline opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals were back to the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets note the parts inventory is on the side of the box as well this is a nice feature once inside the box we are greeted by eight sealed bags plus two yellow 16x2 plates and a green 32x16 baseplate thank goodness there is no dss dreaded sticker sheet but alas there are no minifigs in addition there are the three manuals one for each model and they were stuffed into my box with the care of kid trying to put 10 gallons or liters if you prefer of candy in a 5 gallon bucket but hey were not collecting manuals here so who cares if the manuals are all bent and warped the manuals the three manuals are 74 72 and 48 pages in length they are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings  piece call outs for each step  parts inventory at the end of the primary model build  page numbers color separation in these manuals were fine for me plus we get the usual verbose lego instructions on not dumping all your pieces outside in the grass and not to dump all your pieces into a single pile thanks for the tip tlg parts list the pieces pretty standard stuff here and as i mentioned lots of 1x1 plates and tiles at least 100 however we do get quite a few windows and a couple of doors a majority of the color is black and yellow i did see a few pieces that i was not familiar with so im going to show them below keep in mind im not a parts jockey so bear with me if i think a part is brand new for 2008 and it was actually released with the classic space line 2x2 window fixed and 4x3 window that opens the follow photo shows the window glass same as in corner caf door glass and new black parts turns out these black parts are used as wheels i showed the window glass because it still contains the molding circle just like they did before it is hard to see from the photo but it is there the door glass i think might be new i dont recall seeing these 2x2 round plates with clips before and i thought i would show the mail only because it is printed and not a sticker i know these are common but didnt they have four studs on top these only have two how about this sloped 4x3 window that opens overall a nice assortment of parts with nothing juniorized the build the build was fun and was fairly straightforward once you figure out which of the three models to build it goes pretty quick here are a few shots see how the inside is made look at the detail with the flowers and even the outside water faucet outdoor seating area upstairs being built upstairs with opening roof notice the satellite tv dish check out the patio on the upstairs complete with outdoor light and rain gutters heres my favorite the bbq grill at least we know where those new parts go finally check out the tree no juniorization here here is what is left over so far i have only built the primary model the others look interesting especially the caf the design the design was well done very rich in detail i love how there are no juniorized parts the house is accessible by taking off the top floor like caf corner and market street there is an internal staircase as well there is no interior to speak of in the beach house but there is in the other two models the only real negative is that it is kind of small when you get it done it would be nice if it was about 50 bigger here are a few views of the beach house with a few minifigs thrown in check out the closeup of the caf which i think looks great also here is a photo of the interior of the apartment building where you can see the office and computer overall thoughts it is a really nice set a tad on the small side but it has some great detail and lots of features quick enough to build all three models and would fit real nice into an existing town plan is minifig scale but does not come with any lots of window parts and black slopes is a nice diversion from the onslaught of clone wars ships that we cant remember seeing from the movies final rating 84 build 910 pretty quick and fun functionality 910 it is a creator set so you have multiple varied builds diverse enough to keep the kids entertained design 1010 excellent and well thought out outstanding detail for such a small model parts 610 fair nothing earthshattering but lots of slopes and windows price 810 price ratio is good but you get a lot of little parts would be better with minifigs edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0638 pm indexed	positive
nice set and review what i really like is that this set gives you a lot of ideas for your own houses mocs kimt	positive
love this set now more than ever wub i knew i wanted it from the first leaked boxshots especially with my love of yellow buildings just ask hinckley   great review especially nice to see the closeup parts shots those new 2x2 white windows are very much like replacements for the classic 2x2 windows tlg stopped regularly making a while back so its great to see them the wheels are trolley wheels common in sets including stretchers and handcarts the holder for them is a fairly recent part i think i remember a couple coming in a little single minifig jet engine repair set i picked up in a sh order within the last year oh honey be sure to wrench that chicken before it burns wacko thanks for another excellent review of a set im even more excited about than before y	positive
thanks for the review i definitely plan on getting this one thanks again sweet	positive
agentrick57 on jan 7 2008 0949 pm said i didnt know that the other models in this set came with interiors this changes everything keep in mind there is not a lot of interior just mainly what was shown in the last two photos of the review still it does make the models really nice	neutral

very nice i have been debating on whether or not to buy itit would appear you made up my mind for me y	positive
thanks for the review dunamis this is a great little set im also very impressed with takuto20s mods ive been trying a few of my own i liked the tower block design but a lot of stuff needed fixing firstly i added a 4th wall and made it so the storeys could be lifted off like in the other models i also added flowers on the windowsills and doorways out on to the balconies still to be added is an extra door for the top floor which im going to get from the new doors and windows pack i added a chimney that goes all the way up the back of the house and has a fireplace on every level each floor is fully furnished with a fireplace wash basin and bed on the upper levels and a corner sofa and coffee table plus an extra large fireplace on the ground floor finally here is my idea of what to do with two copies of this set all the parts pictured are from 2x 4996 except 5 extra fence panels and the minifigs the house on the left has its garden at the rear	positive
1 before buying even if i am city fan those new sized planes are really not mine cup of tea my love to lego is firmly frozen somewhere between years 19801995 main reason to buy was that i wanted to write a review at czech afol web kostkyorg i bought it three days ago via web advertising price was  35 usd 2 after opening the box as presumed some very big parts and three bags and as an additional bonus lot of danish air free of charge first sight told me that this will be really short and easy building 3 impressions during building and it was really true 30 minutes of lazy building bag 1  plane bag 2  plane gondols with supports bag 3  wings and propellers when i saw the way how is this plane made i was strongly thinking to play money for nothing from dire straits as a music accordant with whole set 4 impressions after building  lookout juniorized creeps this is my first plane in this scale and for 99 the last one lack of details lot of ugly big parts from whole set you can see the main development target  to keep rrp at some certain low level inner space of airplane absolutely undone no details no luggage no computers nothing at all just a lot lot of air the very only details in whole plane are the stickered pilots desk and some kind of seat constuction 5 impressions after building  playability but what is playability at this set hydroplane which cannot float as seen on enclosed photos  if tlc will make some new kind of big parts used for gondolas to make the plane floating they will for sure make no other damage juniorization couldnt be higher you even cannot drive across the carpet with the plane so how to play open the doors open the cabin part and turn with propellers weak weak weak 6 resumed impressions sadly i must say that at limited release sets tlc boat seems to sailing to the worst part of the coast after quite good 7344 perfect 7899 and 7900 strange but acceptable 7998 juniorization came back with 7906 followed with this ugly playmobilized 7732 7 final word in fact even 15 usd seems to be too much for this kind of set 35 usd expected rrp in our country is really overpriced to hell neither set nor minifig is not interesting tlc maybe knows about juniorization as well as nowhere on the box the number of pieces isnt written if you my afol friends want to spent your bucks better give half of the price to african orphans you will save your money and you will have a good feeling all the photos you can see below as i cannot upload onto this topic due to some limit httpwwwkostkyorc15954newnew edited by kanalk1 16 january 2008  1032 pm	negative

thks for this caustic review d ill wait for the parts on bricklink i think youre a bit unfair with this small oversized submarine  oups sorry i mean plane here are some advantages i tried to imagine  1 thats the first submarine with a plane nose 2 thats the first unprinted nose 3 thats the first shark that make me laugh and which has a plain white fin 4 and at last you should have notice that that the first submarine with a wing made of several plates it is said that this set has more than 200 parts hide and seek  xd you may have lost several bags im eager that people buy this set a lot  id like to buy a lot of these new white 4x4x2 curved slope for my mocs can you take a picture of the plane crashing in the sink  is it fire proof  i think that will be too easy this year to decide what is the crap of year 	neutral
sinner on jan 17 2008 0448 pm said this picture sums it all up and is quite symbolic going down to davyjones locker for good just pull the plug out of your bathtub but wait it wont fit through the drain because its too big  come on they could have at least put one tiny little seat inside that horrible fuselage x x	negative
thanks for the review unfortunately the pictures did not load for me i have to say having seen other images i do agree with your comments the plane is far to big and not enough details that sums it up for me	negative
i have to agree with almost all of the replies here that this set is the most ugliest looking lego set i have ever seen if i have never seen this set and ppl showed it to me i would have thought it would be some little kids moc or something no offence huge juniorized pieces bad color theme i would say it would look better if the wing is white no interior and huge dss i will avoid this set like the plague i own the entire city line except for the airport and planning to get all the city stuff that lego releases but this set will ruin my plans coz i will avoid it unless someone gives it to me for free haha wacko boo lego boo x	negative
ill probably get the nice green cargo plane but not this how can the same hull pieces be used for full size jets and whats supposed to be a small seaplane	negative
what i dont understand is what sort of crime this seaplane is exactly designed to fight that the multitude of other crimefighters in lego city cant handle	neutral
legoman132 on sep 11 2008 0626 pm said this still looks like a cool set but the price not so much the price is now €20 in ireland on sh which is reasonable considering the large fuselage pieces has anyone modded this set to make a reasonable looking plane i am thinking of buy it to do so but i dont want to take a risk and end up with lots of useless pieces aswell as €20	positive

well today i finally got my hands on set 7038 now since the moment i first saw pics of this set i knew it was for me so lets start with the new troll helmet and torso these are both great this troll really stands out as a leader when next to the usual trolls in the dwarf mining set ok so heres a few shots of the front of the set now one thing i really like about this set is the way that lego have placed the back wheels higher than the front this allows the set to really appear to being pulled here we have a shot at the missiles on the wagon these are better than some around i have to say if you look just behind the bottom missile you will see a simple firing device simply push it down and then let it go to see those missiles fire the troll flag is moved behind the missiles for firing one thing that does bother me about this set is the lack of anything on the rear ok its easy to fix with a little mocing so its not the end of the world but i would of liked something placed there now lets move on to the crownies wagon this is simple yet good for holding weapons as for the crown knights themselves well there the ones from the impulse sets which is great imo heres a few quick shots of the 2 larger trolls we have so far i prefer the sand green one what about you well thats the end for now requests for pics and comments are welcome overall i rate this set as a must for anyone whos a fantasy castle fan i know ill be getting more of this set as for the new wagon well its joined up with the other trolls i do hope the impules crownies i bought today can handle them oh and yes i did change the knights heads xd  fantasy war on vader	positive
commander andrew of 501 st on jan 19 2008 1251 am said seems like a good set should i get it btw how did you get you hands on this well if you like the fantasy line then yes if not no i had to get this set through shop  home took ages to get here im sorry to say	neutral
looks like an ace set  i may get this just for the sand green troll even if im not a great castle fan i do want one of them things wub i also love the goblins new metal flaked helmet and the same style with the wheels they look very nice the chicken leg fishing pole is always fun too 	positive
thanks for this excellent review vader it seems you are succumbing to the castle side of the force i love the new helmet and the new orc torso is fantastic as well which is great to see that the troll faction has many ranks too the troll himself i love i agree with you in saying i prefer the sand green version the battle wagon is cool one of the better wagon designs and the flag is a great touch which improves it sadly the back is rather empty but a few modsll change that  and of course this set includes the infamous chicken pole one pic request if you have time vader could you please post a few pics of the new helmet on its own and on a human soldier please batbrick is back 	positive

this is fantastic i love the new helmets for the goblins sweet ive always loved the chicken leg thing really screams lego to me at least how lego used to be  great little bit the goblins are awesome too and the sand green one should look good next to the tan onesgives a nice feeling of a real species in reality not all members of a species are identical its great seeing them in different colors great review xd	positive

thank you for the review vader that set looks worth buying 8 i think you gave me a good reason to buy it 	positive
great review vader  as ive said before this is a nice set but doesnt really come with anything that doesnt come with the other sets of the line for this reason it will be somewhere at the bottom of my list for 2008 also i like torso and helmet of the dwarf mining orcs much better the colours make the torso look rather dull and boring while the other more brown one looks much clearer and more exciting i think i like the knight helmet better too looks more covering and threatening than this one although ill save my judgement until i have one in my hands thanks again vader  edit forgot to mention hilarious pic in your sig vader d edited by tinypiesrus 19 january 2008  0828 am	negative

tks for the review mate  now i have to bloody wait long because lego france has this line available in freaking march  pissed yoda on  d i love the new goblin p that helmet is really cool why on earth tlc didnt include that one in the dwarf mine  such another idiotic move  anyone keeping track of tlcs stupidity lately  that would be interesting  i clearly want a huge goblin army now hehe  and i totally agree with you mate the troll lokks better in sand green the cart itself is pretty lame imo  just a sordid excuse to include yet another annoying shooting crappy device but for a 21 set its okie i say  need my bad guys on  yoda	positive

lego city truck  forklift set  7733 pieces 343 price 2499 usd store of purchase toys rus release date january 2008 after discussion of the mysterious yellow cargo contained in this new city transport set and a visit to my local tru i purchased this set i was immediately pleased with the pricepiece which i think is pretty reasonable 343 pieces for 25 starting with the box great city artwork boasting special edition tha backside of the box no alternate models comes as no surprise the dreaded decals i was looking for the skull and bones for radioactive but no such luck my favorite part of the set a very clever forklift side view and the backside what i like about the forklift is the bars across the top giving the vehicle a reallife design the double wheels in the front with two pieces that can hold the wheels also adds to a clever design i like the figs although not much new  perhaps ill make the driver into a werewolf later the set includes three cargo pallets the first some sort of fuel with gauge the 2nd two indy containers and a square 2x4 brick i have not put the decals on yet and the mysterious yellow cargo your guess is as good as mine   on to the truck the front section the front grill another angle the back i like the opening mechanism that is very simple but works well also is the large plate tile piece inside i like this because the entire interior has no studs and the trailer section of the truck orange and yellow tail lights and the rear trailer open the complete set summary this is a neat set that reminds me a bit of classic lego city but larger it is very playable and has a lot of accessories adding to the value the build was very simple and enjoyable took me about an hour it is a great addition to a number of city sets including the cargo ship container stacker the world city cargo train and the new cargo plane as i mentioned previously i have not yet put on the decals that im sure will really add to the overall look of the set the forklift is awesome and i like the cargo containers the truck could have benefited from a few additional details chrome smokers and an undercarriage box that really opens considering everything i would buy this set again hope you enjoy and perhaps this mysterious cargo will make its way into a brickster mystery y	positive

mr tiber on jan 19 2008 0246 pm said hmm thats a thought but why would they pick this particular set i would expect theyd do that with a slightly bigger set like the heavy hauler perhaps why do you think theyde pick this one good question maybe its merely a gimick to help push the city sets with all the other competing themes the cement mixer is a special edition as well	neutral

highlandcattle on jan 20 2008 0915 am said this set looks pretty good to me it is six wide isnt it that is nice for a truck like this yes 6wide the only problem with these big trucks is how they look on the city roadplates ive always thought too big compared to classic city trucks getting off topic id like to see lego make a car transport truck i dont think ive ever seen one in lego it would definately have to be 6wide or even larger	negative

greetings and welcome to another redman review im your host redman and today i adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the impulse set simply titled the knight no wait thats the old script xd i mean the good wizard sweet the other castle impulse set the first being the knight this is a wonderful and in my case unexpected addition to the castle line i did not expect to get a nice good wizard but rather another plain white skellie for the impulse and was pleasantly surprised when i saw the first picture of this set the impulse sets give you pieces you wouldnt expect to see in such small sets for example the knight came with the armour and this comes with an owl a gem and a crystal ball piece it comes with 11 pieces including the wand owl and gem and no spares which doesnt really matter as it doesnt need any the box sports the set number age range which i blissfully ignore xd awesome castle logo and the assembled set with the usual 11 scale picture of a minifig the back of the box shows pictures of the boxed skeleton tower and kings castle siege sets note the price is in new zealand dollars and is really the same prica as any other impulse set next are the instructions which are separated into 3 parts 1 for the minifigure 1 for the table and one for the bird stand very simple also worth mentioning is the parts numbers are next to their respective parts for replacement parts etc on the back we see on the top half pictures of skeleton prison carriage skeleton tower and kings castle siege this time not of the boxed sets but the sets themselves on the lower half we have 8 pictures each of the different impulse sets the wizards torso is plain sand blue with no patterns or anything but it doesnt really matter is his beards in the way  the head is that same old white fade to grey beard head but the white beard covers up most of the grey my favourite part is the pants i love that were getting printed belts and legs again his belt has 4 gold crosses as seen in if you look closely the new crownies torso and the crownie archers torso and a belt buckle and the legs have a bottle a coin and a small bag nice little wizardey items the er items no accessories no models the stuff in the set include a little stand for the owl and a table utilising the new 4x4 round piece in light bley with the crystal ball in the middle encasing the yellow gem held on by a 2x2 circle piece in blue why blue im not sure maybe its because the crystal is yellow and the crownies colours are blue and gold so the blue piece with the yellow crystal symbolise the crownies colours or maybe tlc just felt the need to include an odd colour p in conclusion this is a wonderful set with some neat accessories and it doesnt really need to be bought in the masses after all you needs an army of owls and wizards  p so it works fine as a single set and adds a more fantasy feel to your crownie army thats all for today folks sweet redman thanks for reading another of my redman interviews any suggestions on how towhat to do to improve it is greatly appreciated as are all comments and criticisms except those blatant thoughtless criticisms that dont help at all p peace edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0131 pm	positive

blueandwhite on jan 21 2008 1015 am said not bad i could see picking up a couple of these guys along with a few of the new knights i actually prefer the wizard as these impulse items are simply too expensive for army building imo later same thats why ill probly only get the wizard because they are quite expensive if you compare them to the 2 ones i used to get back around 2000 and you got about the same peices aswell 	negative

well since noone seems to have done one for this set here we go heres the complete set in all its glory yes i really like it but then tabletown has the capacity to support it and my green army have their eyes on it as a potential military transport as well  ill start out with the little airport ground car thingy  very neat and functional here are views front and back next up the steps which allow the plane crew to embark and disembark and to round off this little trio the cargo loading platform here in its lowered position note the prong thingy sticking out from the rear and here raised the prong thingy is now hinged up to support the back of the platform and keep it level heres a slightly different angle so you can see the pieces under there the allimportant cargo itself hmmmnot much for a plane this size the cargo pallet slots neatly onto the loading platform heres the complete set of ground equipment  all attached and so onto the plane itself note that unlike the other large planes the main wing sits at the top of the row of bricks making up the side of the fuselage i took it apart a little so you can see the internal construction of the fuselage note that the cargo area is really small right at the back what else is this thing carrying illegal immigrants  a picture of the rear of the fuselage just because i like the sticker front landing gear way better than on the other large planes i dont know if this is a new piece or what but ive had no problems with it at all and my kids have been playing with it as well the rather sexy rear undercarriage  this area reminds me of one of those giant russian transport planes  wicked those angled grey slopes atop each side of the rear undercarriage annoy the heck out of me as they keep coming off whenever i pick the plane up i think a 1x4 plate on top to bind them together might solve that a slightly blurry view sorry from underneath the gear looks like it might be capable of retracting internally but alas no this is a shame as theres certainly enough room in there and its a wasted opportunity imo might have to modify that a view of one of the four engines i personally think they look too small and should have something under the wing as well to make them rounder cockpit crew door open i love the smooth action of these doors and the way they seal flush against the fuselage when closed cargo door open crew door with docked ladder cargo door with docked loading platform cargo slots inside and locks into place the same way it sits on the loader neat the minifigs sorry this one is a bit blurry and that concludes this weeks show and tell dr s	positive
lt veers on feb 4 2008 1142 pm said i do admit the amount of cargo is rediculously small but it still looks good say how much can the plane hold thanks for the review sweet thats all the space you get now it might be possible to rip out that rear bulkhead at the back of the wing and fill the middle area with tiles so cargo pallets could slide up the fuselage but that would definitely prevent the undercarriage folding internally if thats what you wanted to do as well dr s	neutral
sinner on feb 4 2008 1151 pm said thanks for the review and pics dr s i am still considering this set what is the instruction manual number there are two  hopefully these are the numbers you need 4525919 4525920  dr s	neutral

i loved the pics in the catalogues but was a bit disappointed by the build and end result my own thoughts cons  as noted the cargo space is really small considering the size of the plane although i can see this is restricted due to playability  without the barrier in the middle the cargo would slide all over the place while the plane was being swooshed  the cargo lift im not sure how else to describe it is very weak and snaps off although it is a clever design i think its badly implemented  there is nothing to hold the cargo pallet to the cargo lift truck so it tends to slide off all over the place as soon as the truck moves  colour issues  i had at least 3 shades of green with the larger plane pieces and noticeable variances even with identical cargo hatch pieces at least one of them also came quite scratched which was a little disappointing  at 7995 aud its 10 more than the passenger plane was with less pieces and figs and no printed pieces whatsoever more  for less methinks pros  lots of nice cargo crate pieces and even the stickers for these are pretty good  landing gear piece adjusts very well to height differentials so the plane doesnt lose its gear as often as the earlier passenger planes  the hinging mechanism works very well to open the cargo holds  opens very smoothly and is not noticeable  id definitely like to see more of this technique  the little vehicles work well chained together and are all good small designs overall  i really like the large planes since 06 but i dont think theyve still quite hit the nail on the head whereas the earlier planes were a little flimsy this one is sturdier but has its own issues the look of the cargo plane is nice and the new landing piece and cargo hatch pieces are really great but some design weaknesses and colour issues detract from the overall product its a shame as with a bit of tweaking this could have been a musthave set	negative
wow thats a great review of a great set dr s y as you yourself have already noted this has the potential to be a fantastic military moc with a bit of modification you can get the engines to be rounder or perhaps do away with them completely and replace them with jet engines sweet though i cant think of a system to retract the undercarriage at the top of my head it seems like theres indeeed more than enough potential to do so it reminds me rather of an ilyushin il76 one of my favourite cargo planes 	positive

hello and welcome to another oh wait first batbrick and iamded review today us two sworn enemies will be reviewing the creator cargo chopper here is the front of the box and while pushing iamded to his doom here is the back haha ouch oh dearhere are the parts anyway here is the instruction of the first model the cargo chopper i love creator sets for the different models they always excite me just ignore me finishing off my nemesis in the background something very interesting that i liked in the instructions was this step where you must add those three 2x2 yellow rounded pieces under the chopper this is for support while you build which is handy and later you take it off and even later use it as the cargo i found that to be rather innovative and clever as well as  hey what are you hitting me for both instruction booklets have the same back now heres the chopper itself i love the design of it it isnt quite minifig scale but its great all the same this is my first nonxpod or house creator set and it sure is fun here me and iamded go for a dizzy ride i love the nose of the copter and the landing gear is fantastic a shot from the other side oh dear it seems weve been a bit sick from that ride and were vomiting transgreen 1x1s the cargo itself is nicely made though i forgot to put on two tiles here   it fits in real well with the chopper to and the line is great for giving iamded the wedgie he deserves this is my first power function set so i was pretty excited the motor is intergrated really well into this set and is activated by pushing that little 3x2 plate with the 1x1 slopes on it forward until it hits the motor button that orange knob another point of interest is the use of bley barrels on each side i like this as i dont have those pieces in that colour a shot of the motor its really simple all you do is pull the hook out to any length that allows then press the orange button and it will wind it back up this makes the chopper pull the cargo up into its bay and iamded pull me here reluctantly to a whacking a top view is that my head a view of the chopper without the cargo in it i love the lowered cockpit the leftover pieces from building note iamdeds head does not count as set piece and a final shot of the set with me and iamded oh it appear were dead oh dear hope you enjoyed this review soon i will post the two alternate models i loved this chopper its great to play with and has nice construction it also has some handy pieces too the motor function sounds like a gimmick but is well intergrated into this model well worth the price so far this is another win for creator i say so far i recommend this model but later well see if the alt models are up to scratch also since this is my first review comments and criticism welcome on everything batbrick away  edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0637 pm indexed	positive
thank you very much for a fine review batbrick y what the i never realized these cool grey barrels till now thats pretty interesting  the whole chopper looks very good with a well fitting power function its for sure a rewardable work to change that baby into a real mf version with accessible cockpit 	positive
great review keep them coming i might get this set now i must have those grey barrels oh dear d xd p xd this was a hilaruos review too edited by vbbn 10 february 2008  1121 pm	positive
haha your review are so funny and so lego cool	positive
i really like this set even though i was hoping for a minimotor d chock full of great parts too thanks for the review sweet	positive
thanks guys heres the final part the instructions for the boat begin on page 46 the overall set its actually much nicer than i thought it would be the pictures on the box make it look ugly top view tommy guns do not actually come with set  side view the designers have done an excellent job with the hull considering the lack of many slopes pieces you can see it is pretty much minifig scale too here you can see that by pushing in the red technic axle the anchor on the front will be hauled back into the boat back view these outboard motors are pretty cool though i wish they could go own into the water more overall though the weakest model its still a lot of fun and has a clever way around the lack of a shapely hull i was impressed with it after the building it it even has two rounded snotty bottom pieces on the nose of the boat to give the impression it is speeding through the water with the front lifting up lots of leftover pieces for this one the pieces sorry about the poor photograph there it was getting late  overall the cargo chopper is another great set in the fantastic creator line loads of fun great play and some clever designs it challenges you to make your own things and even includes some nifty pieces bley barrels wub  i wont give it a rating but ill just say i certainly recommend it to fans of the theme and lego fans in general now finally iamded and i teamup in the face of a larger foe get that lord of pies batbrick away 	positive
howdy how  my batman fellows today i was in a toy mart  and i was looking for a sw set  but all were that expensive then i saw this batman set  for  13  yea  13 euros p i had to pick it up as i came home i started building figs i really like them both cause they are new to me  the green dude xd looks cool batman is also very cool building it  first there was this speeder boat from this green dude p  it looks really cool and these shark eyes  or what are that look also really nice then there came batmans speeder boat  its a nice little ship then the boat  its really cool the simple makes it that good  at the end i got that  ranking  figs 1010 parts  8 10 playablity 810 price 1010  13 euros there  thats a good price overall ranking of aayla  i think i got batman feever  am guessing wich set i pick up at next  any ideas wich is good  or wich you can say me  was good is good batman collection deffinitly on aayla	positive
congrats to that nice review i like the batcave set you should also been able to find it at discount	positive
thanks for the review aayla i love this set and its great to see another person interested in batman now all you have to do is start watching the movies then the cartoon series then the comics then the xd i really recommend twofaces escape as well a great set for a great price and btw the green dude as you call him is named killer croc he is a killer with a freakish skin condition batbrick away 	positive
it is a tie between two faces escape and the batcave but i would go with the cave over 1000 pieces nifty submarine penguins alfred mr freeze and and and it is wonderful especially for 38  ol style batman on yep this is a lil rant on 2008 batman p 	positive
very nice review lord of pies thanks for taking the time to put this together and especially for all the detailed pics y i very much regret that my dark ages occured when they did basically i missed out on all the cheap and easy troop building sets and this one is certainly no exception the big sets are nice but these are the ones that always make me wish just a little harder for a return of lego pirates  i gave it a 4 out of 5 just because id buy 4 out of 5 sitting on the shelves today were it possible	positive
great little set i bought this set only a few years ago misb and i am still very happy about it the hut is simple but very effective as a castaway building on some deserted island the palmleaves are a good addition to any lego collection this set had a nice amount of weapons two for each pirate and two of those weapons are flintlock muskets as opposed to just pistols nice poll as well but you made sure nobody can give this set a 1 which is very nice but probably a little mistake d  i gave it the toprating y	positive
simonwillems on feb 19 2008 0747 pm said nice poll as well but you made sure nobody can give this set a 1 which is very nice but probably a little mistake d  i gave it the toprating y so i have oops i never was very good at maths p	positive
wow i remember this set from when i was a kid i got it for my birthday and opened the package first sadly i had to go to school so i had to leave it at home and not build it or play with it until i got home needless to say that was one of the longest days of school ever good review great set	positive
i bought one of these new from bricklink a few months ago as part of my pirate splurge i went on i really enjoyed this set because of the amount of figs in such a small set though pirates were always pretty good about their fig count also the neat little hut is nicely done for its purpose great review btw	positive
a very nice review of a pretty and neat little set thanks lord of pies guess it´s a 3 for me with strong tendencies to 4	positive
id give the set a 3 12 out of 5 it needed 1 more imperial to get a 4 a bigger basplate would have been nice as it appears to hard to fit all the minifigs on the island thanks for this great review	neutral
imo this is a very simple and small set good to add some part to forbidden island good	positive
well since this topic has resurfaced i would add my 2 cents about my appreciation of this set it was the first and unfortunately the largest pirate set i owned as a kid but i played the wazoo out of it some of the minifigs have lost almost all their face printing after so many play sessions theres just something about the hut that appealed to me more than the cheesy skullface islands we keep gettingprobably that it wa kind of neutral good for my pirates settlers or islanders though the palm leaves were rather fragile and used to break off the studded parts it would be nice to get more of these beach village army builder sets edited by ardelon 21 september 2014  0340 pm	neutral
hi guys i picked these up the other day but its taken me this long to get round to posting the reviews so here we go tub comparison with a minfig thanks brainbox the lighting changes a bit throughout the photographs as it was going dark outside so i only really had my desk light and i kept getting in the way 4837 mini trains now the box i really like its no different to those of last years sets but the colour here is simply fantastic and really seems appropriate for the theme so this is what you get inside all the pieces are still inside the bag the optical illusion was accidental d  no pieces of particular outstanding interest but the dark green cheese slopes are rather nice look out for those later 1 2 3 this is the main model and uses all the pieces in the set bar these two which according to the inventory are spares but as with all my other creator sets im cheating and leaving them in this is far and away the best model of the three and evokes the iconic version of a steam train the green looks superb but im not sure whether thats due to the model itself or the actual colour moving on we get to the second model 1 leftovers yes i admit i was using a piece of paper this isnt actually a bad model i dont think its quite as nice as the previous one but its not bad its different from the first model as well which is good too muich of the same can be a bad thing finally we come to the third model leftovers now ill be honest i dont really know what this is its not that good a model compared to the other two thats all i can say really and of course all the pieces fit into the tub overall i have to say i do like this set despite the weak third model the strength of the primary and secondary models make up for any weaknesses in the third and i can imagine the pieces being fully usuable in building other trains while the basic idea of these tubs isnt quite as good as the xpods with regards portability and general niceness they arent bad and for a fairly cheap price 34 as well 4838 mini vehicles this is one of those set boxes that you see because of the ridiculously loud colours sound marketing scheme if you ask me ive managed it again there are pieces outside the bag or are there now these i like y  1 2 i dont know what the clip is for there isnt one on the other side 3 4 5 this is the main model of the set and again all the pieces are used bar these three the spares its quite a nice model although the cars a bit odd still i like the ramps and the colour scheme reminds me just a little of g1 ultra magnus hmm i think that boom arm could do with refixing 1 2 leftovers this is actually quite nice as well its that classic breakdown truck and the boom arm itself is quite nice with quite a bit of movement another solid model 1 leftovers im surprised by the amount of detail here actually not only have tlc included a spare wheel at the back but also what looks like a trailer hitch which all adds to the realism another nice model to round out a nice set and in the tub overall im not sure which of the two i like better when i bought them and on the way home i much preferred the train set but after building this set im not sure this is another good set from the year when tlc seems to be giving us so many there are some good pieces in here too and while theres nothing unique theyre still good so thanks for reading hope it helped someone and if there are any requests ill see what i can do thats requests for pics not songs   edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0656 pm indexed	positive

mmmmh i wub love the train great review it looks like each model can be connected to the other to make a complete train y y it makes me want to get 3 of them or more to make a long one d	neutral
great review pictures and all thanks for showing all the mechanisms of the tower i didnt notice them from either the pics we had or the instructionsit didnt hit me that when you knock down the wall the second floor breaks that is a genius idea this looks like a superb set unfortunately my priority right now is the troll warship still if that really is us 80 i might skip it and go for this instead which is only 20 us one note though i think there might not be a back cage on the second floor of the tower so that the mechanism can work did you try to see if the second floor ground still falls if you add it a fourth cage wall also you could just pretend that the tower is built against a mountainside it would fit perfectly and add more defense to the knights great review  vk	positive
tks for those so much  y nice reviews i love that tower raid and the defender and will buy them both quote really dont add much to the set oh but they do more pieces higher price 	neutral
thanks for these fantastic review its the first time i take a good look at these sets there is a good chance ill buy the dwarfs mine defender especially for that price	neutral
this set didnt come with the new jail door piece id have guessed it would have since there is an orc in prison nice review im looking forward to picking up these sets steve	neutral
cheers for the reviews theyre both nice sets and i think i just may have to buy both or maybe ill get two of the dwarf set the figs in each are really cool as well the dwarf well theyre just cool anyway but the troll with the golden helmet and armour thats just wub	positive
thanks for these great reviews sweet the dwarfs mine defender looks interesting the figs though are wub the only thing missing is a weapon for the dwarf and some shields the battering ram and tower are awesome 8 the troll king with new torso helmet and body armor is simply amazing i like how the troll is handcuffed d the tower shows nice detail except for the poor brig  i love that gold crystal the battering ram is a thing of beauty 30 for the tower and ram and 10 for the defender are very well priced i still want the battle wheel more though damn exclusives   p	positive
thanks for the review i personally think the siege tower is probably the best one which lego has ever produced	positive
well i dont think orcs are that sturdy seeing that theyd have to jump from the second level of the tower i dont see survival as his chief objective p awesome review im loving these sets more and more the tower raid is definitely the best and the cheapest set there  oh and pirhana its not really a king its more like an officer remember the wizard rules these goblins edited by trooperdavinfelth 22 february 2008  0249 pm	positive
sweet wow another excellent review haha that tower does reminds me of kk ii of mistland tower x well overall i love these 2 sets very very much sweet	positive
well you didnt say anything wrong yet undead army officer i perfer using the batle wheel to knock down the towers walls not the seige tower	neutral
yeah the open towers are kinda funny although they were also typical of for instance 90s pirate sets the trolls vehicles are cool though they look evil i cant wait to start collecting 08 castle setsi didnt buy any castle in 07 i only got one set for xmas so im catching up on the 07 stuff first before its all sold out	neutral
now that this topic has been brought up again i just want to say that the rubber band on my dwarf mine defender actually works	positive
a great reveiw dunamis y  you have only backed up what i thought when the pictures first appeared if you are a lego fan there is no excuse not to buy this set it is a must have i love the mouse hole and the mouse and his cheese wub 	positive
damn you to hell dunamis  now tks to you i really want the 3 sets put together xd wow that is what i call a sweet review 8 tks for taking the time to make once again such a fantastic one  the overall look of the building is brilliant and i love the nice additions they did the cheese and mouse jerry d  is hilarious  i didnt know green grocer had a rodent infestation  and the use of the new built furniture and detils like the radiator is freaking awsome  also that set has a definite plus for me its the back details  i love the stairs the deck with table  wowx that is what i call sweet backdoor details  now its clear that i will need to buy the 3 sets asap  tks once again dunamis  yoda	positive
very nice very nice indeed lots of lovely little details even at the back this review hasnt changed my opinion one bit im still looking forward to when i can finally pick up mine at the post office im crossing my fingers that there will be more buildings following after this one im guessing that legos just testing the waters to see how far afols are willing to go regarding price vs details green grocer is still epic though	positive
for some silly and quite delusional reason i thought that i had a chance to review this first d but yours is at your house and mine is hopefully winging its way to me  thanks for the review it will help me survive until mine arrives i love this set wub hopefully there will be many more stunning sets like this to come sweet xwingyoda on mar 8 2008 0803 pm said i didnt know green grocer had a rodent infestation  neither did i and i have looked through the instructions at least three times 	positive
damn it  what a great great review  i definitly love this set  burn credit card burn  youre the must in there dunamis  many thanks 	positive
like the set this review also deserves a 1010 ive ordered this set yesterday on sh seeing and reading this review im convinced it will be worth the money so bonaparte is finally entering the city theme 	positive
truly an awesome review thanks dunamis i ordered my two copies one to build one to store in the vault last week cant wait to get this one the attention to detail here is what makes the set great theres nothing to criticize about this set its really the closest thing to perfection that i have seen from tlc the difference between this set and cc is the interior detail and because of that gg now become in my opinion the best set ever released by tlc do the ccggms sets fit well with the 50th anniv town plan my impression is that out of the box at least they dont which is too bad however i dont think it would be hard to mod the town plan so it looks like it belongs in the same town as ccggms these sets to me are what i have always wanted from tlc as an adult i hope they keep up the line and add more elements to this excellent lineup	positive
wow thanks for the nice review i have the other 2 sets and waiting for this to come to our shores stupendous design and details i really like the hammerrails on the roof cant wait wub	positive
thanks for all the feedback as you can tell i really enjoyed building it cardinal brick on mar 8 2008 0926 am said is it the first set youe given 100 to yes it is i gave cafe corner a 96 and i felt this was a better set and improved on the things that i dinged cafe corner on lack of minifigs was one thing thats why i enjoy reading the comments so i can see if my ratings are in line with what everyone else thinks and to see if i missed anything i cant wait for some of you to build it and share your thoughts as well	positive
a very fine review with great and informative pictures thanks dunamis y and what a wonderful set a masterpiece and far beyond everything i wouldve expected just one year ago the amount of details is exceptional from the different railings to the mousehole and the radiator sheer brilliant  and two female mfs or hippies you never know and a child only one adult male character who nearly looks like well anyways its simply a milestone and a very creative and inspiring beauty wub easter parade on and sweet gg will you marry me 	positive
o m g i must have that set  y wub i remember you telling me that you were going to do a review of this set and i was so anxious i love these reviews thanks so much great pictures wub y y this will dent my wallet 8 i am so envious	positive
a very informative review indeed thank you so much for doing so now i know that the price is worth every penny leaving my pocket  what do you guys think is tlc putting up as the next modular set is it asking too much of tlc to produce 1 modular set each quarter 4 times a year	positive
a million thanks for this review this is greater than i thought i especially like that clock im going to get this set as soon as possible	positive

great review thanks for taking the time to do this this has been a great line at the risk of abandoning my castleadventurer loyalties ive got to say this is rapidly becoming my favorite line and this set looks to be the best of the lot while it still hurts to shell out 150 i think ill still be happy to do so steve	positive
thank you sooo much for this amazing review dunamis i absolutly adore this set and youve review has prompted me to certainetly start saving i have a bit left over form christmas that will come in handy d  i love the little fridge downstairs the fire escape and the mouse hole alot more good ideas that we can all use in creating our own buildings this line is by far my favorite lego line ever yes even beats starwars but only just   hooray for dunamis xd	positive
ive got something i want to share with you a beautiful dream came true 1 the box top back the alternate model is also very well done the pneumatics dump the bucket and open the flap  open you can see a diagram how the pneumatics work just a happy kid playing the plastic inlays  all 2 the parts as you can see 8854 offers a very large variety of different parts loads of technic bricks gears and even plates also note the threaded axle 10 5 large pulleys a big turntable and the 1x20 rack 3 building the mechanism for the outriggers and the rotation of the turntable the turntable the pneumatics are finished the mechanism for the telescope the finished model 4 random shots you can see how the turntable will be rotated thanks for reading erm viewing the pictures please comment if you want to	positive
really cool set this has convinced me that i really want it	positive
wow another old technic set review by you nice set and thanks for that review	positive
thanks for another fun review this set is high on my list of things to buy i love cranes built many and bought many including the classic 8460 from 1995 and the more recent 8421 that threaded axle never stopped intriguing me it was use in so few sets i believe 8851 contained one as well and i still dont know why its better than any other axle congratulations with a near mint copy of this set 	positive
simonwillems on mar 10 2008 0132 pm said that threaded axle never stopped intriguing me it was use in so few sets i believe 8851 contained one as well and i still dont know why its better than any other axle the purpose of the threaded axle is to carry tension regular axles are used primarily for carrying torsion for gears sometimes for compression 8855 landing gear helicopter skids and sometimes just for looks roll cages canopies but used in tension connectors will usually just pop off with the threads and the corresponding nuts this part can be used to squeeze parts together like the pen in the plotter of 8094 or to hold heavy assemblies onto turntables like 8862 and 8851 with the power crane 8854 reviewed here that is the complete list of sets which used this part i wrote about it here httpwwwericalbre1984htmlparts eric	neutral
as i bought it i didnt even know i would also get a box it just said all parts with building instructions after opening the parcel i was like woah woooaaahhh and so on  i love legoboxes because as a child i stood in the toy stores starring at the boxes only seeing the front and the back nothing more this brings back some memories 	positive

hi this is my third oldschool technic set review i dont want to talk much please enjoy just the pictures 1 the parts 2 building the two axles you can see in the middle are not connected and dont belong to each other the axle on the left side is for the steering on the right side for the engine the darkgray technic gear 16 tooth with clutch allows the connection from the differential gear to the engine trough the axle for the steering the v6engine the winch thats a part you dont see everyday a 1x2 rack it only reappears in 2 sets from 2001 and 2004 the rebel wrecker has been released in 1994 the front double wishbone with antisway barsuspension yeah i got it from technopedia xd  the finished model 3 random shots i really like this picture authoritative isnt it 8 d thanks for viewing the pictures please comment if you want to	neutral
thanks for reviewing all these old sets will you be doing any more	positive
ah a good old retro review those old school days had some pretty impressive sets with alot more complexity than modern sets if you have it may i recommend 8880	positive
thanks for reviewing this classic set i got it when it first came out and still love it the suspension steering and robust look of the model havent been done that well ever since this set puzzled me though back in the days the rear suspending part containing the differential and some gears was shown different on the box from the instructions in the instructions it showed that the grey part of the suspension in the back had to be made using a 1x2 smooth tile and 4 cornerplates 2x2 in grey the box however showed a much sturdier solution using a 1x8 tile and a 1x8 plate it is also visible on the cover of the instructions the pieces i mean are in this picture bernddasbrot on mar 9 2008 0705 pm said otherwise great set	positive
thanks youve just motivated me to go on a senselesspreliminarydesignerrorshunt a few things ive discovered left side alternate model the steering link can only be put in place with a little violence the handlebar  is turned far more than its actually possible although the wheels are straight right side the 1x8 tile simonwillems pointed out the half bush right next to it is cantfindthewords wrong could be that the technic triangle is missing the windscreen 1x6 technic plates are mounted with 12 pins instead of axle pins with half bushes who can find more xd	neutral
hmm seems like the wheels are recycled into the harley truck in the 2008 batman set	neutral
natelite on mar 10 2008 0557 pm said hmm seems like the wheels are recycled into the harley truck in the 2008 batman set nope the harleytruckwheels are thinner and somewhat more modern i do believe theyre the same like in 8274 aaaaaaaand for a long time in my life these wheels have been the best and coolest looking ive ever had so wheres your deference d recycled  xd	positive
ive seen a few cases like this where the box pictures are slightly different from the actual model the airtech claw rig compressor is another one that comes to mind the changes sometimes seem pointless and make you wonder why they bothered p quote the only original stickers are the front headlightpatterns on the 2 red 1x2 bricks the others have been destroyed  must have been the bad decaying sticker quality that breaks when youll remove it  so i printed them i didnt print the flag for only the alternate model needs it although its a neat idea the other stickers on mine have held up pretty well although i didnt try to remove them after i put them on the flag started to break after a year or so and just fell off its axle at one point i taped over it and its holding up well now although its a little frayed along one edge this is actually the earliest set ive seen that uses this crappy sticker material which is unfortunately very common today even other technic sets had good stickers for many years after that	negative
bernddasbrot on mar 10 2008 0556 pm said youve just motivated me to go on a senselesspreliminarydesignerrorshunt man this set is a disaster what were they thinking d p i just remembered one other fun aspect of this set the crane hook can be attached to the underside of the rear bumper to hold it in position while driving along but when things are like this and you try and wind up the cable the winch is strong enough to break the original provided lego rope it worked with my copy d so this set is capable of demolishing itself but still one of the best technicsets i have with all stickers intact im not so sure about that flag though must check on that	positive
wow that first picture is great you must have a very wide angle lens with the capability to focus very close macro the perspective makes the model look huge nice work i think the suspension on this set is my favorite of all technic it has such large travel and is so what word should i use bouncy hey why do you only review sets which are red d eric	positive
blakbird on mar 10 2008 0935 pm said hey why do you only review sets which are red d i exactly thought that today as i made the pics for my signature xd at my school leaving examination i made a model in blender3d and explained to the board of examiners how to build a car and how to animate it it needed a color so i took red because all beautiful and fast cars are red my physics teacher contradicted 	neutral
a neat review of a cool set with very informative pictures thanks bernddasbrot y	positive

i can remember that ive seen a few color variations on brickshelf and on ebay they sold well its new and familiar at the same time that makes it more interesting	positive
reread your review today great pictures this is a fabulous model got this model a few months ago for just € 25 it is small and has great working parts i love the way the frontsuspension is made epic i only had the lightstickers replaced with transclear bricks btw the gear rack has been used in this years 8048 buggy	positive
i also happened to receive this set this weekend virtually misb the seals on the side of the box were loose however everything inside was untouched this little beast a joy to build and even more so to play with as indicated by eric on the technicopedia page its crammed with functions for a mediumsized set i think i love it even more than my son does	positive
i read blackbirds technopedia page on this truck the other week went onto ebay and picked up a misb copy for £25 gbp bargin great to get old sets unopened peeling the plastic off of the specialist parts was always cool love the front suspension	positive
that price is exceptional its less than what i paid for mine 9 years ago and is even less than the original price of the set note that the stickers in this set are the bad variety that will crack and peel over time if you want to preserve them the technic flag in particular you will need to tape over it	neutral
somehow i also managed to get this set in very good condition including box instructions and all stickers for a mere €22 a few months ago this is indeed a very special set and was a pleasure to build the only flaw i noticed was weak support of the rear drivetrain which was easily corrected with a few extra plates	positive
junkstylegio on mar 23 2010 1117 pm said huh like where dont have that much problems with that rear train at least if i you dont trow the model down the stairs or something like that maybe its unusual but this section of the drive train didnt hold that well on my model this is how it looks now the parts made redundant were left in the built model thats why theres that useless 8tooth gear there p	neutral
hello my dear friends heres something new i am actually making a review with pictures yes i got a new camera for christmas now i was testing to see how the camera would reflect so some of the pics are a bit blurry i have based this review from dunamiss reviews he is my inspirationso without further ado i bring you the review set  7693 name etx alien strike price 1999 1299 pieces 246 box okay so as you can see below the box is pretty simple as always european versions wont have the piece count name etc just the number i believe mine having the american version has the info on it as you can see it has the classic mm logo and the red planet as well as the set in a pose itself very nice i linked it because the pic wasnt resizing httpwwwbrickshelkedscn0017jpg below is the back of the box it shows the other sets and some features of this set contents next we have the contents this set includes a medium sized dss xwingyoda a bag labeled one and huge bag labeled two the 1 bag contains a smaller bag and the two bag includes two smaller bags 5 bags in all also pictured are the instructions i have linked it due to the nonresize httpwwwbrickshelkedscn0019jpg figs included in this set are three figs two jellies and 1 astro the jeelies are fine but i pefer the lom ones but they glow those new alien commanders for summer look promising though the astro is nice and includes an extra gold visor moc on astro miner in all mm sets there is a human and alien set the astro par of this set is a miniminer here is a pic of construction and that wonderful space logo sticker not much of a cockpit  finished minerthe set number too overall i like the miner and it is nicely designed i feel the cockpit is lacking though aliens the alien vehical is the main part of the set this pic shows the beginning steps solid and sturdy but those four axlespin partsblue are pointless no support and they dont get used at all nice tlc  now we get cooking this pic shows the tail added on and the more bulk being built we get a little repetitive and build the craft up in this pic and this pic from the instructions shows how the alien craft transforms for battle the completed set and extra bits parts 810 figs 810 price per piece ration 910 playability 910 overall 85 the alien craft is great the attack feature is nice and there are a ton of trans green parts the alien falls out of the cockpit when turned upside down i love this set and its perfect for mm fans or beginnersit has nice parts and read the above part for more details gallery when moderated keep an eye out for future reviews please comment 	positive

sweet first pic review y i got this set for a birthday present last year and it is pretty fun overall the alien ship in this set is actually one of my favorites it just looks cool and the way you can fold it out is really clever the only negative for me is the cockpit of the mining unit not really because it isnt detailed but because mine is top heavy and keeps falling forward its kinda funny if you think about him driving along and then falling forwardbut not funny at all when youre playing 	positive

well as bad a concept aliensvshumans is for a theme i really do like this set the human rover has nice parts for reuse especially those oldschool space wheels and despite those wobbly wings i really like the alien ship goes from a flying saucerish shape to a spread winged almost raven shape very ominous and cool looking now that alien commander is terrible if i dont buy bionicle minifigs already why would i be interested in that thing kinda wish theyd take the drones from the retiring exoforce theme and do them in green theyd make nice alien robot things	positive

toaofjustice on mar 21 2008 0810 am said that looks like a very nice set  in your opinion how does it compare to the current dune buggy toa of justice imho 8829 is much better than 8296 first 8829 is a lot bigger i really like the huge rear balloon tires they both have rack and pinion steering and they both have trailing arm rear suspension with a v2 engine i think the body on 8829 is a little more well done for 8296 i think the alternate tractor model is much better for more comparisons see technicopedia eric	positive
blakbird on mar 22 2008 0949 pm said one thing i noticed is that a bunch of your pictures are missing the beam that goes over the left hand wheel as a fender oh no i forgot to put it back i wanted to make a photo with this beam alone 8 blakbird said what kind of camera do you use the pictures have very good depth of field meaning that both the foreground and the background are in good focus this is usually hard to do without a very small aperture the camera belongs to my dad its a panasonic lumix dmcfz30eg blakbird said one of them works well mated with an 8 tooth on parallel axles and the other one doesnt the difference is only supposed to be longer teeth so it really should not matter but it does if your set works bad try switching the crown gear to one of the other variety worked for me wow youre right never thought of that thanks i made a scan  of those two gears you can notice the longer teeth first pic edited by bernddasbrot 23 march 2008  0303 pm	neutral

hello all apologize for digging out a such old post recently i got a bag of lego technic parts where there have been mixed three sets 8858 8829 and 8235 the resurrection of 8858 has been described by me in a separate post going back to the dune buggy – when i saw it for the first time back in 1994 i did not like it as i was always big fan of 8840 which i consider to the day the best looking buggy and set 8829 looked to me ugly so there were those all parts in the bag… then i though why not build it  and i started to do it when i finished i was very surprised how the final look of this set is really taking my words back unfortunately in the bag there were missing some parts and i could not rebuild the back spoiler so i made some changes to it and make it from spare parts that i have and it came out acceptable i also added some additional parts such as “fake” steering wheel “rally” logo antennas i have also reverse mounting of the rear tires – why lego did them like that i never know – as i think they look better this way set well the review has been already made by owner of this post so i will only add few things into it engine – v2 aired cooled is driven by 4 gears  from the single wheel no differential as in 8840 using two old school z14 tooth bevel  then by z24 tooth crown and z8 tooth type 1 actually the as in most old sets the pistons are moving very fast not as in current sets and smooths – i needed to extra clean all engine parts as there was a lot friction suspension – set has “engine bay” working using two old gray shock absorbers 65l – the movement is not big but works very nice better then in 8840 in my opinion steering – this is a bit odd as there is no direct connection to hog as in most old sets but first the gear rack is moved by z8 then two z14 tooth where reverse movement is taking place later connection of two old school z14 tooth bevel goes to hog details – this is the most that i like in this set specially how the use of axle pin connector perpendicular and 1x10 bricks with 3x3 cut corners and plate 1x5 toothed ends 2 studs with center axle hole are making the body shape – is just wonder tires – the balloon rear are pretty nice the front is a new version of those that were in 8840 what i do not like 1 missing of technic figure 8840 had it 2 no steering wheel in the original set 3 no differential – but having in mind that lego has introduce 2412 teeth would be difficult to build the transmission in such small space where the engine is i will shortly upload new pictures and post them here later on  over all – i think it is worth buying it as it is very payable  actually very payable and runs smoothly  the steering suspension – perfect thank you and regards	positive
wow this buggy was my very first lego set i like this review  it remembered my childhood i also liked its body with those 8 studs long bricks on sides i can also remember trying to build engine in such way that it works smooth without success anyway i think its studless version  set 8048 is much better	positive

hi this is my forth preoldschool review as promised a yellowset  my 8862 arrived today survived the washing machine coaster and actually was real fun to build 1 information this set contains 664 parts only i thought i’d be far more and was released in 1989 in the technic theme be sure to visit technopediaif you want to know more 2 building instructions wow these instructions are used im not used to this after all this sets with unread instruction booklets the pneumatics page the last step for the alternate model 3 the parts wow look at all those technic beams gears pins a few parts are missing in this photo 3 building the left worm gear is for the outriggers the right one for turning the “rear boom” the three 12l axles left one outriggers middle one steering right one erm… rearboomrotation the two worm gears in the front part left one lifting the bucket right one dumping the bucket the turningmechanism for the “rearboom” is finished once again a toothed 10l axle the boat weight 2x6x2 is hidden underneath the radiator grill okay… many hoses and a nice comfy seat have been added now you can recognize the backhoes real shape only with a little violence it’s possible to lift the bonnet  through the pneumatic pump yeah outriggers same technique that the 8854 uses the finished “boom  jib  scoop thing” bjst  xd the finished loader bucket and to end the building process the same picture from the introduction offtopic “it is all part of the miracle of nature  the circle of life” 4 functionality this time i tried something new i hope you can spot something  if not technopedia okay here we go 5 random shots i’ve got way too many pictures this time so i refer to my brickshelf folder until it’s moderated you can follow the multilingual links eins deux three quattro fem zes sédem osiem 6 final thoughts definitely worth buying as a child i thought it looks hideous  but today i’ve found out it’s totally fun to build and freaking functional three things i want to mention though the bjst can only be slewed a new word if the outriggers are deployed it is also possible that the bjst will reach the ground danger of grinding or sticking even if the outriggers are deployed the two mechanisms for the loader bucket can actually interlock and the 14 tooth gears might break  disentangle from the axle thanks for viewing the pictures i hope you enjoyed it please comment if you want to	neutral

another nice review the slow shutter speed pictures are great i think that was the only set with 8 distinct functions for a very long time and was only displaced by the 8455 backhoe in that respect the turntable on the back doesnt turn very well though as the weight is all distributed on one side the screw axle prevents it from popping off but there is still a lot of friction in it i dont have mine built anymore but it might be worth trying to put a weight brick or something on it quote do you have 8455 as well id love to see how they compare side by side it looks bigger than 8455 but i dont own any of the big old chuncky tires so i find it so hard to tell yeah its quite a bit bigger when everything is fully extended it becomes something like 26 long although the 8455 actually has morebetter functionality edited by cp5670 24 march 2008  0815 am	positive
a great review for a great set it even had the old technic tpieces and bevels which i actually prefer to their modern counterparts cp5670 on mar 24 2008 0814 am said the turntable on the back doesnt turn very well though as the weight is all distributed on one side the screw axle prevents it from popping off but there is still a lot of friction in it i got mine for £20 in a second hand shop it said complete but one of the screw knuts was missing xo so its practically impossible to keep the back arm on with only one  and theyre rather rare on bl too 	positive

yeah i meant theyre rare  but i can imagine that a normal axle with the old half bushes will help sometimes these are really strong if you put 23 in a row edit i just tried it a normal 10l axle with 2 interlocking old half bushes type 1 on each end i chose those who only can be moved very hardly along an axle i slewed the bjst  back arm a few times tried the pneumatics parallel to it and it didnt loose edited by bernddasbrot 24 march 2008  0606 pm	neutral

quote there are 324 axle nuts on bricklink with an avg price of 089 i didnt know of this accessoryset 51102 you can buy it for 4000 8 i was thinking of getting one of those off bl several years ago back when the price used to be more like 15 or so but i realized that i hardly ever use the couple that i already have p they came out with the modern turntable the year after this set which mostly negated the need for these screw axles i think their only use now is to hold nonlego objects onto models like the technic pen in 8094 i guess you can try to make linear actuators out of them but theyre often too rare and fragile for that	neutral

bernddasbrot on mar 24 2008 0539 pm said could you explain your thoughts please you know my english skills  i was thinking you could somehow attach a 16tooth dark gray gear the one that spins freely around axles to the nut which would make the axle move in and out when the gear turned and convert the gears rotary motion to linear motion in a fairly compact package although there are other ways of doing the same thing that dont use such rare parts and the 2008 technic sets will come with prebuilt linear actuators anyway	neutral
quote how long of a shutter speed did you use 15 seconds quote by the way dont forget to build the alternate model of 8862 i will review it too and post it in this topic quote slewed i think thats a word how about slewn or slain or slewifacated i think rotated is best actually i took it from your site xd quote white is pretty rare unfortunately i dont own 8480 but i think 8824 is also a very good though small white set 8462 rocks as a blue set i just got it a few weeks ago lets see 8462 also is one of the last technic sets i would call oldschool 8479 okay too but 8458 is imho not 8868 and the totally mysteriously black set will follow quote i was thinking you could somehow attach a 16tooth dark gray gear the one that spins freely around axles to the nut which would make the axle move in and out when the gear turned and convert the gears rotary motion to linear motion in a fairly compact package did you had something like this in mind if the toothed 10l axle rotates the axle nuts want to rotate too but they cant because of that 2x4 technic plate so theyll decide to move along the axle the 1x6 bricks on each end make sure that the axle wont move in or out thanks for your feedback	neutral
blakbird on mar 25 2008 0642 pm said wow thats a long exposure i would think you would get way too much light and overexpose the image the aperture must have been tiny for the aperture i dont know what ive used but my room was already very darkend as i tool the photos it was actually serendipity  blakbird said cool i am also planning to write about the combine on technicopedia i will but ill need some time i really shoud do a few things for university thats also the reason why i succeded in so many other things   blakbird said you dont own 8480 that is unacceptable it is imperative that you put a mortgage on your house immediately to get it not again sing just kidding my parents will xd  blakbird said while the assembly you have drawn would work as a linear actuator i would not recommend it the torsional stiffness and strength of an axle are proportional to the polar moment of inertia a section property most of the stiffness comes from the outside of the cross shaped axle but in the threaded axle you lose all the stiffness of the outer area because it is not continuous this means you only get stiffness and strength from the small core i think the threaded axle would bend and break very easily if subjected to much torque the toothed 10l axle doesnt look very robust youre right on brickshelf i once saw another version using a worm gear and a halfbush being moved along another axle edited by bernddasbrot 28 march 2008  0512 pm	neutral

generaltarful on mar 25 2008 0143 pm said nope p and thanks hollisbrick they are both really similar so it really depends on which colors you use more in mocing or which characters you like more my personal choice is 8159 as it has cooler minifigs except for racer xs recycled head  and the colors are more useful to me then again if youre like batbrick the only thing that matters is if a set has orange in it p regards general tarful thanks y probably will get this set although the orangeoh the orange peices 8 haha anyway once again thanks for the reveiw and meditate on the decision i will yoda xd	neutral

thanks for the review and for giving me directions p i think the design of these two cars looks to be better than in the other set the drivers are positioned lower compared to the windscreen and the design of the front on th red car is really nice im missing details of motors and cars this big could use a working steering mechanism	neutral

thanks for this review its a nice set with some cool pieces and nice techniques i like the way the roof pieces are used to make the spiders back for instance lasse d on mar 26 2008 0948 pm said alternate models 3 it is hard to come up with alternate models with so many small pieces and plates that are only 1 stud wide the colors might make you want to build a spyrius space ship ouch thats not a good thing lets refrain from that 	positive

enchanted island 6278 pictorial review original price 66 pieces 412 figures 7 this 1994 set marked the beginning of a new era for lego pirates  it became a theme more centralised around playability and not so much grand ol ships 6278 enchanted island was the flagship set of the islanders subtheme heavily based around polynesian and native american concepts in fact tlc was successfully sued by a number of tribes for using bastardised maori names such as kahuka it was released as a legend set in 2001 but due to poor sales was discontinued again the largest of the islander sets enchanted island is a portion of an island with a river running through the left hand side features some sturdy buildings built into a treelike structure on a rocky outcrop whilst the left hand side features a tower built out of wooden posts and a large tribal statue the box cover shows all the details it does however differ from the instructions finished product in that it has been more aesthetically arranged  bushes etc have been moved to fill in gaps and to not obscure other things the sides of the box show nothing particularly special although in one scene it depicts the islander canoe chasing the pirate boat with the treasure just one way to play with the set the back of the box however is superb featuring a large number of alternative models a toothy statue a pirate tree think wolfpack with an islander base kahukas throne a firebreathing statue and a soupedup boat for the pirates these and many more can be easily made because of the large diversity of pieces the set has a huge number of minifigures for its size the third highest number in the pirate range the ses and the bsb being first and second respectively  a whopping 7 5 islanders including the alltoocommon king kahuka the elusive islander babe and 3 standard warriors  this set alone will never leave you short of enemies 2 pirates ironhook in his standard attire with a scurvy dog at his side attack the island although they are only moderately armed  2 cutlasses and a pistol between them a musket wouldve been nice the islanders on the other hand have 4 shields a bow and quiver and 6 spears not to mention the big pokey thing with horns on top weapon idol staff a monkey parrot and crocodile provide the obvious creature features with a fair amount of gold to finish off in the instructions the goblet does not have the lid although it does on the box its a nice touch anyway  adding a little more diversity to the monotonous treasure stashes the pirates boat is a nice 2 sail vessel with oars for when the wind stops and a treasure map the sails are similar to those in lagoon lockup but with an extra front sail its an awesome little boat better for raids than a rowing boat but not too big that it cant sail up rivers it can comfortably fit 2 men and at a squeeze 5 the sails are expensive if you buy them seperately normally this wont be a problem but they can cost aroun 5 each the islanders boat is a canoe with a sail and an outrigger to stabilise it the sail is beautifully done with 2 spars taughtening it there is a clip for the rower to leave his weapon when at se and the mast can turn to get as much wind as possible its quite a topheavy boat but it doesnt look hideous and without the mastsail it looks great 3 islanders can fit in it and more if they sit on the outrigger the markings on the canoe are stickers but they look fine and are probably more robust than markings for their job furthermore theyre waterproof sing kahukas throne can be carried by 2 loyal subjects or strapped to his pet crocodile the clips on the side can be used to rest his weaponry or hold spears for battle the throne looks nice although im not too sure about the blue against the red  id have prefered white as it would clash less an overview of the island it is built in 2 halves  left then right and then joined together loosley so it can be seperated for transporting around the back to the left and right there are large open spaces that are great for battles  this set isnt so much about a large solid build but creating a village  smaller structures linked by bridges and the back to the far left is a platform built onto the rock with access from the river via a ladder theres the standard islander drum with the lovely zebraskin part where did they get that ive never understood the white flag  i was under the impression it was used for surrender further along the rocky bank there are some hinged palm leaves that swing upwards to reveal the treasure its an ok hiding place not the best place to hide it right where the pirates sail past but it feels fabulous it fits right in above it on the rocky bank is the main structure it looks very disjointed when you build it bricks all over the place but once its done it looks nice and rural with leaves everywhere and the balcony where kahuka is standing you get a nice roof made from 2 large palm leaves tilting down around the back theres a slight shelter a table for picnics and a ladder to access the upstairs i was rather annoyed that it is so open but the set is designed from just one perspective to the left is the bridge to the other building a nice one piece bridge made of the softer plastic used for muskets and the post1991 cutlasses it looks good but be warned it tilts when you pull a pin sending the pirates flying this contraption is a good idea but it is very stiff and so doesnt swing even when burdened by a minifigure  youll want to modify this bit if you get it the other building looks like it is made out of posts and beams they are all red brown would have been better but it would have added too many colours to the range just like the use of black for trees in some forestmen sets there are 3 clips for spare weapons only 2 of these will ever be used when all the islanders are armed but it gives the pirates scope once theyve been disarmedtheres another nice palm tree roof on top 2 ladders give accesstheres a total of 4 in this set  worth getting eh although theyre 5p on bricklink for a kabob theyre like gold at the top theres another hidey hole the palm leaves lift up on hinges to show the treasure or hiding islander it can be seen from behind but this set is designed from one perspective only nice cattlehorns tooalongside the slats you can see in the floor  5 years later and it wouldve been a solid plate the big statue is one of the main selling point of this set alongside the tilting bridge  theyre the action features shown in every catalogue at the time but it is not really special just original the statue fits in with the theme perfectly  kahukas mask his shield and this statue all depict the same deity which is a nice collectible idea the back is rather plain except the angled 1x1 bricks  a good touch im not sure why theres a black brick in the back of the head but this is easily remedied it could even be done with a brick from this same set just swapping the two over aside from the head turning the back can open to store sacred objects or in my opinion prisoners hence the gaps for breathing either way its a lovely piece of architecture and deservedly a flagship element of the set theres your standard cooking pot floating around although a 1x1 yellow stud as human flesh remember minifigs are yellow no matter what the licensed themes say is a superb finish this set is a stunning set for both kids and afols who are just getting back into legopirates  it is a great army builder and due to its release as a legend is extremely cheap on ebay  you should be able to pick one up for £18 or £15 if youre lucky for that you get a lifetimes supply of islanders 4 ladders some wall panels 2 baseplates one raised and both with rivers and printed vegetation around the edge a ton of weapons a fair quantity of standard bricks but most of all a heap of vegetation this is an easy to buy set with normally around 5 on ebay at any time and is well worth it for the parts the play and the nostalgia it can be easily modified when used in conjunction with any other outpost a much larger fortress can be made especially if more rope bridges are used if you pick 2 of this fine set off ebay itll still be less than the original price a huge complex can be constructed giving you an instantaneous village for around £35 other information lugnet rating

thanks for a lovely review i only recently bought this set off ebay pretty good deal misb for 30 euros and i enjoyed putting it together and mixing it with the other piratesets when you put two sets of two baseplates together youll get a large pond with an island in the center just to achieve that i bought two more baseplates off ebay the result is this moc i always loved the islanders and have most of the sets not all of them but that is going to change in the future y	positive
excellent review i really like this set and so i gave it a 55 this set is on my list to get i especially like the speedy pirate boat and the also very fast outrigger canoe with a sail i dont think a small number of these cannibals will make much of an impact on gaming though even if they get a bonus with spears duke	positive
nice review  although im pretty sure eldorado fortress has 8 minifigs making this set no 4 in the minifig count i gave it a 5 the number of islanders and vegetation pieces comes in very handy for land based scenarios ive got 3 copies of this set 1 of them costing me less than 2euros from an ebay auction in scotland along with forbidden island its easily one of the most common and affordable pirate sets to be found on he second hand market	positive
good review mr slyowl and good pics too i know it probably deserves better but i only give him a 3 ill be surely the only saying that i dont like this set but i remember i had it for christmas when i was a child and it disappointed me very much because i expected it much larger after seeing it in the lego catalogs well its just a little trauma i had p lol anyway i must admit its an interesant set specially because of the large number of minifigures and accesories it brings with and the two little ships edited by bluebard 31 march 2008  0113 am	positive
its a great set and one i have yet to add to my collection despite my large number of islander extras enchanted island aside from having so alluring a name was good value for money in that you only needed this one set and you had a good representation of the islanders both in the size of the set and the number of minifigs the flipping rope bridge and the river give it a great rainforest retreat sort of feeling and one is inclined to think of this set as more inland than directly coastal for me whilst the islanders were never seen in the same light or popularity as pirates and imperials they were an obvious and colourful addition that to me added a whole new depth to the pirate system and one was now able to play a 3 or 4 way war adding a greater political element to the sets enchanted island is probably the 3rd most appealing of the large land bases for me after port royal and eldorado fortress good review and glad to see the set recognised	positive
slyowl youre a legend thank you for taking the time to do such a comprehensive review youve captured enchanted island in impeccable detail and anyone who doesnt own this set should know it insideout by now i shall write my thoughts on the set itself directly	positive

fortunately i got this set on 2000 not the released version the original one and i said fortunately because its a lovely set how could i rate it but awesome a little islander army the islander girl ironhook and that cool boat with two sails the jailpolynesian statue i must recognize that i have a thing with the islanders i know that they are weird poorly based on the polynesian aborigens etc but they are very original broke with the traditional enemies and gave to the pirates theme an exotic and wild look	positive
i realized that building the chess set from the new pirates theme they are two grey heads that reminded me of the king kahuna throne which goes to say that i am hoping they bring back new sets i just wish they were bigger i would love to build the old ones but i would side more towards the newer model if they ever released them	negative
what an amazing old set i loved pirates in my childhood but that was before the islander and spanish stuff mine were the bsb and soldier fortress with the big baseplate as im now returning to pirates ive tracked down most of the 2009 sets and of course bought the new 2015 sets but knowing i missed this middle period of islanders vs pirates makes me a bit sad those islanders are soooo monkey island those of my age likely feel the same to my eyes oh for a lemonhead minfig  im curious now how much this set sells for given it was apparently one of very few lego actually rereleased i recently bought a misb bsb that was an early 2000s rerelease and it was very pricey but then i suspect the bsb has a lot more of a nostalgic following these days than this set can anyone give me a rough idea what this set goes for in asnew condition these days regardless a fantastic review with some great photos of the whole set and minifigs even though this is an old thread i am glad someone else bumped it recently so i can add my thoughts too  one thing ive noticed comparing the newest pirates sets to the 80s ones i had as a kid and these from the 90s is the move away from baseplates and big panel pieces i actually like that in a lot of ways whilst i miss baseplates being included as they are a great starting point for creating new things and make the sets easier to play with visually i think legodesigned model sets look better without them	positive

hi ive promised a lot lately ill review 8868 8880 space police ii blacktron ii and i will its just the time that is blocking me and my university and the fact that i just picked up 8460 in original box for only eur 3650 sweet the other reviews will follow  please bear with me and this set review is also a gift to this nice fellow who gave me the title thats what im talking about 1 useless information with high numbers this set contains 841 parts and was released in 1995 in the technic  tech build  advanced sub theme the bricklink price guide displays for “used” a qty avg price of 12585 and for “new” a qty avg price of 21282 i got it for 5698 still can’t believe it  this set was rereleased two times 8431 in 2002 and 8438 in 2003 2 the box front back open the box is higher than other technic boxes why i don’t know 8460 doesn’t have any real large parts whatever inlay i wonder why tlg doesn’t make inlays anymore… they’re noisy and brake easily but are great for pre sorting 3 building instructions i will quote myself from the 8862 review quote wow these instructions are used im not used to this after all this sets with unread instruction booklets triplewow ‘nuff said this is the “first” page fortunately peeron offers scans the last step for the alternate model and a few nice photos showing how the pneumatic pump will be erm pumped yeah random page i forgot the overall thoughts to the instructions these are technic instructions as we’re used to them part count easy to understand okay the string part at the end was too much for me and the color distinction is okay too 100 pages long and if i can trust my eyes the pneumatics page can be fold out i don’t have this page but i assume it 4 the parts 5 building an easy and fun build okay this could take some time my longest building review up to date the front steering the rear steering the axle pin between the rear steering is for the axle which rotates the crane the two worm screws in the front are for the outriggers they’re not linked one for each side the small wheel in the back is for the rotation adjusting front and rear steering outriggers are finished you can notice a 8 tooth gear that will rotate the technic turntable a steering wheel has been added could be the same stickers like the alternate 8880 used to have the steering can be operated with both actinic lights  no we’re far from finished i’ve got a lot of parts left at this point wow a 4x4 corner plate pneumatics and a winch if you can’t recognize it on the photo the technic beams are the erm wrongother side up the 1x6 technic beams on the left side are normal the axle that will extend the crane 7 gear racks 1x4 the 1x6 technic plate will keep the two pneumatic cylinders straight sad 8 huh did you blink you missed a special part the whole rotatable thing will be attached to the technic turntable using two long technic pins the pin on the right side should be in the middle of the three “turntable holes” on the right side it’s the first hole asymmetric why because we’ll add a cute cab 6 functionality you can find the features in comparison to other technic cranes here technopedia of course i made one sentence out of it please don’t find any mistakes p “two axle rack and pinion steering pneumatic luffing and gear driven telescoping via crank for the boom which can slew 360° on turntable driven via gear crank driven hoist and gear driven outriggers at four corners which snap over center” 7 random shots comparison to 8854 uuuh… once again a depth of field i tried to make it look authoritarian like 8858 but i failed somehow 8460 looks cute 8 comparison to 8421 mobile crane  crane truck i feel that a question concerning this will be asked so i deal with it right now first of all i don’t own 8421 yet i know a technic freak really should own it anyway 8421 has more than twice as much parts as 8460 is motorized features a v6engine and a very neat mechanism to extend the craneboom twice using a braided string with end studs try to find out how of course 8421 features far more than 8460 imho 8421 should have been a copy of 8460 a set so successful that it has been rereleased two times but the designers overshoot the mark 8421 is a breathtaking monster compared to it 8460 looks cute  not pale 9 final thoughts i got it on ebay in kind of good condition for about 50 dollars i know that it has been worth the money in any point of view wub i didn’t use the word “oldschool” for now i’ll change that 8460 belongs to the favored few of oldschool technic sets thanks for reading and viewing the pictures i hope you enjoyed it please comment if you want to	positive
somehow i competely missed your review when you first made it i saw your pics on brickshelf and wondered about the review you have managed to review my all time favourite technic set it was the first large technic set i was given by my parents when it first came out in 1995 i played for hours with this set making minifig seats in it it was so huge there was room for four minifigs to sit next to eachother in front i made various applications for it a bungeejump system with a large rubber band and lots of containers to be lifted the first changes i made included the inverting of the wheels and the disabling of one of the flashlightsteering wheels because they obstructed eachother by the way the nob for your winch is yellow instead of black i know this set by heart so watch out p  i always liked those nobs i do own the 8421 and i can tell you this 8460 is much much stronger it can carry more weight because the boom is lighter then the 8421 they are powered by the same two pistons you know when you made it right when the crane is in upright position fully extended and you release the brake from the winch does the hook lower without having to pull it if it does you succeeded in constructing the set right the alternate model was great fun too the pump is cleverly hidden and the crane folds up great between the cab and the loading platform you could easily mod it with a pneumatic claw on the crane a motor to turn it and a compressor the only flaw was the loading platform which had no floor only some axles thanks so much for reviving my memorie concerning this great set y	positive
im in the same situation as you i have this set but missed out on the newer 8421 this was a great set for its time but the 8421 definitely looks better to me ive been trying to find a good deal on it on ebay but its pretty expensive considering that it only went out of production last year quote inlay i wonder why tlg doesn’t make inlays anymore… they’re noisy and brake easily but are great for pre sorting the box designs in general are crappier these days than they used to be 10 years ago you dont see the old featured parts trays anymore and the boxes dont have the different sections either these also acted as internal supports for larger boxes so they were less prone to being crushed the cardboard material is also quite a bit thinner i think its a result of tlcs overall costcutting moves since then most people toss the boxes and probably dont care but i keep all of them there was actually a time when the boxes used to be even stronger i have an old 8859 set and the outer box is made of a hard styrofoam material although they probably stopped using that for environmental reasons edited by cp5670 06 april 2008  1013 pm	neutral
front on apr 6 2008 0519 pm said btw boxes are expensive so at a given price point its a choise between more bricks or nicer boxes i have no doubt what most people would chose yeah its certainly understandable why they did it but bad for box hoarders like me p	positive
thanks for the review sweet for its size and parts count this is a remarkably featured set i dont think ive never seen the alternate model before personally i prefer 8421 because i think it looks much better and i love the six wheel steering i also love the three segment boom and the transmission they fit it all in so neatly i realise that it has trouble even holding up itself but ultimately it doesnt matter as its not like you are really going to construction work with it what bothers me more about 8421 is the design change in the boom from chainlinks to strings i would try to mod mine but all i have is the prototype picture to base it on and i dont have enough links anyway p bernddasbrot on apr 7 2008 0729 am said yeah somehow i wonderd why only vbbn thanks responded indeed i have been very busy the last few months and i kept meaning to reply at last i managed to find the time to reply today bernddasbrot on apr 7 2008 0729 am said another reason for the 8460 as favorite set its got a real alternate model not just a different erm crane yes that really sucks somebody i havent got the time to look  on brickshelf has made a quite good alternate lego have been a bit inconsistant with alternate models lately the recent tow truck had a good one i even made both	positive
great review while i admit i wasnt into technic at the time this came out i was a mere child give me a break d i can see now why it was featured so much from the booklets to display stands at toy stores and at my local lego center when it was still around this thing was everywhere with your review i can now truly appreciate all the details of the set i got to admit i can see the appeal now that comparison shot you took is amazing i love not only just how it included the little details such as the stabilizers but also looks incredibly fun to play around with great set and an even greater review	positive
thanks guys  sinner i hope you refered to 8285 so my answer will match 8285 is interesting main model american styled truck alternate model european styled truck i dont think tlg produced many european styled truck edit i just found a wonderful mocalternate on brickshelf 8436 by industrialdesigner if i got him right he designed a few offical technic sets for tlg  all promises promises promises hm and again its ebay thats blocking me i want to foreshadow my next review although itll take some time to make it i know you know but please act inconspicuous until youll can act very astonished edited by bernddasbrot 09 april 2008  0325 pm	neutral
set ref 7624 name jungle duel number of minifigs 3 number of pieces 78 price 1190€ it’s the smaller set from the last indy movie “the kingdom of the crystal skull” here we go a general view of the set we have a tent some food  a chicken leg is always welcome a fireplace the things with all the swords a bench with a broken table 3 ants a map printed tile and other accessories don’t make that girl hungry or yyyyaaaaaaaahhhhhhh ho no our diner a giant ant has gone away those giant ants are made in a smooth plastic in dark red and trans black colour and here a closer view on the two new hairpieces the new girl hairpiece is really cute and i’m a bit disappointed by the new man hairpiece…those hair lake some volume… but i’m really happy to see that tlc has made some new moulds for hairpieces it’s the good part of the theatre lines so it’s a really interesting set because you’ve got a lot of useful pieces for a city mocers with the two new hairpieces without spending a lot of money edited by imperialshadows 01 june 2008  1159 am updated statstitle	neutral

alex54 on apr 15 2008 0857 pm said those giant ants are made in a smooth plastic in dark red and trans black colour im pretty sure those ants are actually spiders i really wanted an in detail review of this set with opinions as well as pictures and you provided the goods alex54 i really need another tent i can later use it for rebel troopers and i love the selection of minifigs the new spiders are freakin awesome why didnt lego make them before this set is a must buy for me i guess in the uk it will be £899 edit where did you get this set alex54 i really want to know edited by the rancor 15 april 2008  0913 pm	positive

set ref 7625 name river chase number of minifigs 4 number of pieces unknown price 2290€ a general view of the set we’ve got an amphibious vehicle a small boat an observation post and a dark green croco so beautiful  for the figs we’ve got indy of course marion and two russian soldiers nothing special here in the back of the tree there is a box to put some things the amphibious vehicle is very nice the proportions are really great not too big not too small and there are a lot of details everywhere like the propeller a back view an inside view the small boat is a dark grey zodiac but the details are nice too giving it a retro look in the same way of all the indy vehicles the outpost has a net to permit to the bad guys to capture some nice guys and girls… but it seems that the girl marion is scared of the nice croco so indy comes and help her pushing the technic axle with this round inversed tiles which push out the net and capture the croco now marion feels happier and she takes a can of oil and whacks the poor croco without defences who has said marion is a nice girl so i’ve bought this set like an add on to my city in fact the elements of this set can easily be integrated in a town layout i plan to use the outpost for my forest section and the amphibious vehicle is always a nice touch of originality in a layout yes you can use all those military things without creating an army in a layout just put the violent parts out and you’ve got nice things like a biologist car in the case of the amphibious vehicle	positive
great set ill definitely get it is there any sign of flesh on the soldiers like at the collars	positive

sweet review again alex great pictures i loved the little comic with the croc youre quite right here too alex54 on apr 16 2008 0917 am said yes you can use all those military things without creating an army in a layout just put the violent parts out and you’ve got nice things like a biologist car in the case of the amphibious vehicle without the gun that vehicle is a nice little amphibious car with a tent i assume strapped to it some tools a spare tire the little tree hut is quite cool and a nice touch with the box in behind there i love the design for those gasoline cans too thanks again alex youre lucky to be getting these sets peace	positive
great review alex after seeing these pics im really looking forward to getting this set i really like how lego has designed the gas tank thats just so good finally a different shade of green for the croc its about time and more than welcome the vehicle looks good and a fun build though im not that fond of that commie tree	positive

darthperson8 on apr 15 2008 0712 pm said what are those bricks with the guns attached supposed to be great review and set btw some people have obliquely mentioned this in their responses to the setreview but to specifically answer your question its supposed to be a jerrycan aka a gasoline petrol container	neutral
a very fine review of a really great set thanks alex this set has everything a croc very nice mfs a neat tree trap a cool zodiac and a marvelous and very detailed amphibious car in a beautiful color scheme the only thing i´m not colpletely sure is the design of that jerrycan thanks for the right word and the interesting link kingboy  although the use of the revolver´s pretty clever indeed and fits well too it´s still clearly well a revolver very unusual and interesting for an official tlc design	positive
just like 7626 this is a must buy in my opinion i just the amphibious vehiclevery nice for army building	positive
im glad they change the torso form the prototype	neutral
set ref 7626 name jungle cutter number of minifigs 4 number of pieces unknown price 3999€ a general view of the set we’ve got 5 giant ants two russian soldiers a general indy of course 3 trees a small entrance of a cave and the debroussaillor vehicle i don’t know the english name of it… you can’t enter into the cave because there is a spider web with its spider…unless… unless you know how the mechanism works and the spider web go up… and reveals a case with diamonds and accessories a closer view on the mechanism which is simple but works well and you can also see the difference or maybe the same size of a spider and a giant ant and i’ve always thought that those spiders were very big compared to the minifigs so those ants are really giant poor small frog the three trees with the entrance make a nice jungle layout don’t speak too loud you will wake up the soldier… don’t worry for him he will be waken up by the vehicle before being eaten by those giant ants a front view making the vehicle really menacing a back view push the red part from the back and there are two parts that fall down from the vehicle i don’t know why… the movie will clarify this i think… and here you can see how the two big circular blades turn when you push the vehicle… simple but effective run indy run this set is really nice the playability of the different elements is great the colour scheme is nice too i like those dark green tree parts the vehicle is really impressive without being too big and its very well details in general the designers of the indy sets have made a really nice works with a lot of efforts in all those details everywhere i’ve got some project for this set to integrate it in my city i’m a city mocer and not an indy fan so i don’t have bought the temple the bigger set of the series because it has nothing special for me in term of part selections or in the design in relation with the town theme and because my supermarket doesn’t have it yet so we are waiting for a member to review it and make the part 4…	positive
i like the creatures in this very much and it is good to see the vehicle from different angles thank you i think i shall buy this	positive
i cant wait for these	neutral
oh man thanks for the review imo this looks like the best set in the new indy line do you have any better pics of the colonel	positive
excellent review alex thanks for sharing i cant wait to buy this set once available i really like the dark green leaf pieces i like the cavetemple which will look great in my jungle diorama blending the dark green and light green works well for the vehicle overall a neat little set	positive
this is a great set it is probably my favourite indy so so far great reveiw although the set is great the price is greater have to get it on sale	positive
wow in the protype pics i kept thinking this thing looked lame a boat on treads with saw blades but this is definetly something i want now lots of great plant and animal parts and looks like plenty of wheels with those treads its just begging to be made into a propor tank	positive
this one is my favorite from the bunch thanks for the time spent in making a review	positive
great review thanks a lot for all the pics i agree that this is probably the nicest set of the indy 4 wave so much dark green and i love all the plant pieces its been ages since weve had enough pieces in a regular release to build nice forests so its great to see 11 of the dark green leaves in one set and all the vines the design of the cutter looks very solid and brick built as well giant ants are great looking too	positive
thanks for this fantastic review alex those trees are a neat add on to any jungle as is that sweet cave but the main part of this set the jungle cutter man that is wicked packed with that awesome dark green and with those wonderful treads not to mention the smoothly spinning buzz saws however this sets a tad overpriced in my opinion and looking through the instructions they have that crazy colour syndrome again using blue yellow and red parts in the internal build still thanks for this sweet review with neat pics thumbup peace	neutral
thanks for the review alex i agree that this is the best set of kotcs sets although the airplane comes quite close although im not too fond of the trees the cave is good and the jungle cutter is brilliant plenty of great features and very detailed with much of the engine showing and a decent cockpit if thats the right word the general and the two soviets are great too could we have a closeup pic of them please  good to see that neither torso has exposed fleshy skin like the nazis as said though it is quite a pricy set i was expecting it to be just over the price of race for the stolen treasure great set thanks again alex	positive
xwingyoda on apr 16 2008 0537 am said great review again alex  same question in case you didnt se it in my reply to the other set where did you get those new sets  i really love that set  its called jungle cutter the trees are really cool and make a great adition to it imo that temple entrance or monument is really cool  those bionicle parts do make fantastic vegetation  you mean the spiny dk green things that hang from the holes around the secret entrance they were in the indy temple escape i totally forgot about that green frog  thats cool  those are so cute  5 more ants is great  the vehicle look really sharp ah ah ah 2 more commies yeay  that officer is really freaky actually  could have been a high rank under pol pots regime in the s21 yeay looks more asian than russian imo yeah tlcs really cranking out the new molds for both food and wildlife so lets see if i get all five sets i get 11 russians and six are basic soldiers although two are duplicates and triplicates yes that officer definitely has an italian look to him those cheekbones are a little too high now its time for my gripes  same bloody rant about indy   i havent read the instructions before but once again there are so many parts in crap colours that need to be changed look at all the crap red and yellow in there  i will need to look for those parts before buying the set like i always do  mod while building on  same rant any chance we could see the rpg i am really soimpressed with that indy line  i sincerely hope it will have a long and healthy life  agreed responses to the yodameisters review of alex54s review of the jungle cutter are in red now to my opinion great review more reviews on	neutral

heres a review of the second largest set in the dragon masters subtheme for castle month dark dragons den figs the set comes with 3 dragon knights two of which have the dragon wings on their helmetssad thing is one of my knights was missing the left wing on the helmet there are also the definitive dragon wiz the wizard or majisto if you prefertwo horses and a hawk try to find him in each picture the set theres a large spot under the mountain for the dragon to guard the treasure chest the chest has 2 red and green 1x1 circles in it another gate in the back along with a door for knights the right side of the mountain has a ladder and a removable rock face the left side has some stairs leading up to the top i love this tree design simple yet effective a shot of the top hey what are you doing no throw him in the dungeon overall this set when first released in 1993 was priced at 43usd although that might just be because of the juniorised pieces 6 burps its a fun set that provides excellent playability if you can find it at a 2030 price point pick it up overall grade 810 edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0133 pm	positive
this is around the time that many consider the decline of castle in which point i somewhat agree but admittedly it still looks like a very playable set and the tree is very well done thank you for the review	positive
thanks every much for the review i remember having this set and making really terrible stopmotion movies with it very playable this brings back lots of fond memories thanks majisto on	positive
ah the wonderful dragon knight or was it dragon masters sets i personally preferred the black knights but these guys still had some awesome sets thanks for this review this looks like a neat little set although those modern stairs look a little out of place that tree design is indeed a neat one i remember having that in one dark forestmen set i got the interior sure is roomy may i suggest for future review you photograph the set on a cleared table that way you wont get distracted by the clutter in the background and can focus on the main part of the image the set peace	neutral
yay go dragon masters i have to agree with iamded i do like the black knights sets better for their design  betrayal  however the dragon knights are just awesome cause they have dragons this is a nice set with some awesome minifigs and a nice overall design i wish i had it go masters	positive
agent rick youre definately the dragon master around these parts what a great little set i really like the classic dragon which reminds me of a similar style used for the lego crocodiles and the dungeon is pretty slick too i like the use of the large gates plus the doors plus the set contains the blue wizard awesome great review	positive
great classic dragon den i love the old green dragons very much there were my fave i love these theme very much after the black knights era this is a very very good set i wished i can have this too	positive
the wizard somehow controls the dragons i think like for example the wizard of the new castle line does with the undead skeletons but i think it isnt sure that the dragon masters wizard is evil as it is still unclear which factions of the older castle series are good or bad	neutral
phoinix on 16 april 2008  0906 pm said this was the last castle set i got before my dark age really liked it although the big rock parts looked really bad  i am kind of used to them now unfortunately i lost the little wand and i never understood who is good and who is bad does the wizard own the dragon well they dont seem to be enemies but isnt the dragon supposed to be evil i always liked the burps i dont know why maybe because they were dark grey and dark grey pieces seemed a bit hard to come by at the time i always assumed that the dragon was sort of the mascot of the dragon masters the wizard was there to keep him under control so he wouldnt turn on them i always figured that the wizard was working with the dragon master king and they were fighting against the royal knights the dudes with the lion faces on their torsos or whatever they were called i like this set a lot i think the castle theme declined after the dragon masters and royal knights themes were discontinued the new knights never really took the cake its funny but it seems to me anyways that when the lego minifigs lost their regular smilesmirk faces whether they were masked by a beard or not thats when lego began to declinea bit the dragon masters had their vicious faces and all but they still had that smilesmirk underneath their rough exteriors the new knights look a littleless confident	positive
i own this set and i think its a great for a smaller fortress building there is a good selection of mini figs the burps do detract somewhat from the set but they do make it feel as if its in a large cave the cloth flags that are included are really nice and mine have lasted a long time	positive
the 8291 dirt bike comes from a long line of technic bikes and i think its the best ever it looks great and its fun to ride around in the house i hoped to find a figure the right size for it but none of mine would fit unlike a lot of technic models it looks good from all angles considering the size of the model it has a complicated way of connecting the engine to the wheel the rear shocks are just the right stiffness and they have a good amount of travel i thought these shocks were new i need to get out more functions shocks two front one stiffer one in the rear drivetrain 2 piston engine linked to the rear wheel via gears and a chainlink steering yes it does stand retractable for the price size and subject what else could be added 1010 parts considering that it has three shocks and a 40 chainlinks its a great set for parts some hard to use large parts are included but they are not overused the usage of the green does limit part usage somewhat though and ill be struggling to find a use for those wheels for anything other than a motorbike 810 price at 3999 aud for 248 parts it isnt the best value set the us price is 2500 which is somewhat better it does have some more complicated parts however 710 looks lego seems to be moving away from the seethough look for technic sets and this is a good example of it im not a big fan of fairings but i think they work great in this set as a fuel tank 810 fudge this set was great for me as i have never had a technic bike however for those that want this for just parts or have other bikes it could be a hard sell the alternate model a chopper is a complete rebuild which i didnt make and its great that lego have been including these most of the time lately 710 overall recommended 810	positive
i saw this set at my tru for only 2000 now i might go get it thanks sinner for another nice review quote hoped to find a figure the right size for it but none of mine would fit well just sit your booty down and ride it wourself  okay well maybe if you have a bionicle lying around or a halo figure	neutral

how did i manage to miss this review i must have overlooked it somehow thanks for making this one sinner its always nice to see reviews of technic sets im not so sure whether i like this set i am not that much into motorbikes but lego did a good job on this one it looks a lot like an upgraded version of one of the first bikes lego made namely the 8838 shock cycle i also believe the back gearwheel is somewhat oversized it looks better with the smaller one you attached it is good to see that lego is back to making the technic sets the way they were except for the green that is 	neutral

i wasnt very interested in this set at first it seemed to be just a nice looking truck with a small motor but when i found out it had a transmission i changed my mind here is the transmission it allows the single motor to be used for two functions this system has been around for a while and lego seem to be using it more and more the transmission driving ring alone the red circle goes for 515 usd on bricklink and you also need the catch and clutch gear so i have been buying sets that have them instead i now have enough parts to make a supercar gearbox i bet a new supercar comes out next year now this is the gear that rotates the arm note the colour of the 24 tooth gear it seems to be a new gear trend a lot of work has been put into this truck looking real personally i think they went too far as the truck seems to have been designed for a tilting cab but its disabled to prevent breaking the front bottom of the transmission the bottom shaft lifts the arm note that there are more dark grey gears the motor fits in very well also the bottom of the arm i was surprised by the usage of a 12 tooth bevel to link with the 36 tooth double bevel as i had never seen that done before as you can see there is no room for any drive train standard steering for a recent technic truck there is a handofgod at the cab top that links via two knob wheels it looks good from the back you can also see the white clutch that connects the transmission to the motor to avoid burnouts it goes decently high and can go a bit higher if you use the crane arm compared to last years fire truck if i didnt buy the fire truck for half price i would have been annoyed that lego brought out what is almost a motorised version of the same set functions cherry picker arm motorised rotate and lift that links to a motor via a transmission and antiburnout clutch steering rack and pinion controlled via a handofgod linked by knob wheels doors open and close good functionality that works well but i wish they made the cab lift and im a bit sick of the lame fairing door trick 710 parts motor battery box transmission clutch practical wheels only two fairings compact turntable this is a great parts set 1010 price at 9999 aud for 726 parts its ok value when you consider what you are getting the us price is 6000 which is better but still not great i bought mine for 80 aud which was good however and i suspect that the price is designed for easy sale810 looks id buy this for the looks alone 910 fudge the functions work well and i llked it more than i thought i would oddly mine seemed to be missing a axle pin with friction but since it includes extra parts for the alternate model i didnt mind using one of my spares on the subject of the alternate model it is a dump truck which is made out to be a total rebuild but it isnt it could have easily been done like super street sensation was but lego have probably determined that instructions like that confuse people 810 overall recommended 810	positive

thank you for your detailed review sinner i´m not that much into technic building because i´m lacking the inspiration to build something different with all those technic elements so i´ll pass on this one and stay to classic bricks	neutral
wow its a smarty set with drive shafts we are everybody and technical junk the specs and stuff kind of lose me but the walrus looks really cute in the cherry picker i imagine hes saving a kitten but really this is a great review and has a wealth of detail and knowlege for techniphiles thanks for providing such a cool resource for eb i really did enjoy delving in to the world of technic for a few moments the walrus rides it  oh hes so smart	neutral
thanks for reading my review guys vbbn on apr 20 2008 1058 pm said great review i never have been interested in this set i am saving my money for a grey technic set or thatt technic ferrari set if you mean 8145 ferrari 599 gtb then i recomend it but i think it is overpriced mine was almost half price and about to fall in the sorting bin holodoc on apr 21 2008 0423 am said i´m not that much into technic building because i´m lacking the inspiration to build something different with all those technic elements so i´ll pass on this one and stay to classic bricks i have enough now to be able to build something and i really should soon or im going to find it hard to justify to my wife buying the other 2008 sets imperialscouts on apr 21 2008 1258 pm said thanks for the review i think i am going to get this set for its many technic pieces i could really use those for a rig im going to build i didnt know you liked technic i look forward to seeing this rig cp5670 on apr 22 2008 0235 am said the overall design is a bit too studless for my liking i think the 8275 bulldozer has a much better balance of studded and studless pieces and the wheels somehow look too small to me i also have something of a backlog at the moment i still need to pick up that bulldozer along with the 8421 mobile crane on ebay id buy the bulldozer or mobile crane over this set as i own both already i bought this i tend to agree with the wheels but i think it doesnt detract from the model hinckley on apr 23 2008 0814 am said wow its a smarty set with drive shafts we are everybody and technical junk the specs and stuff kind of lose me but the walrus looks really cute in the cherry picker i imagine hes saving a kitten thanks for your foray into technic land i tried to fit him in the cab as well but he kept falling over	neutral
sinner on apr 22 2008 0849 pm said i didnt know you liked technic i look forward to seeing this rig well its mostly from the mindstorms robotics side honestly if i bought this it would be my first technic set ever	positive
imperialscouts on apr 23 2008 1104 am said well its mostly from the mindstorms robotics side honestly if i bought this it would be my first technic set ever another illusion shattered interestingly ive never bought a mindstorms set as i have enough programming to do for work without doing it for fun i have been tempted though	neutral
set 7627  indiana jones  temple of the crystal skull pieces 929 price aud14999 out of all the indy 4 sets this one seems to cop the most flak  which may account for the fact that the other 3 were reviewed weeks ago and this one has sat unloved and alone waiting for someone to turn their eye upon it or yknow buy it luckily im a sucker for spooky old temples filled with devilish traps and hidden treasures hissing fountains and overgrown foliage creepy skeletons and crumbling stonework so here it is indiana jones 7627 temple of the crystal skull part 1 the figs first off the figs  6 humans and 4 skellies or should that be skullies  indy mutt irina and that sneery russian guy thats in the 2 smaller sets nothing new here aha what have we here  two natives i wonder if hair is a sign of power in this culture since one guy is completely bald and the other one has the most extraordinarily luxurious black mullet somehow i doubt the movie will answer this question back view  as you can see the scalp tattoos are also popular in this tribe fashion conscious note in the background the paws of the fearsome black jungle panther ie my cat curious as to see what the tribe was up to also dont ask me why these guys are carrying axes rather than say spears and what everyones been waiting for the skullies  three of em and a conquistador skellie  very cute note the backs of the crystal head have a plumesized hole  or maybe thats just where they injected the blue brainplastic spooky i love these skulls i wasnt sold from the initial pics but they have a very creepy smile and the head shape is just weird with the large eyes its kind of homer simpsonesque and here we have the token vehicle in the set  a weird little tank thing with treads kind of looks like a cross between the amphibious boat and a minitank im sure theres a military expert around here who can tell us exactly what it is supposed to be the treads are nice but the rest of it is a bit thrown together you can tell they wanted to keep the dark green colour scheme but the budget only allowed them 5 parts to do so  all in all a mixed bag with the figs 4 repeats from the cheaper sets which means we have one new native figure and the crystal skullies there are heaps of the oldskool skele heads scattered around the sets so those that prefer can replace the skullies with ordinary skellies bizarrely the top of the box which has the line of 11 figs pic you know what i mean doesnt have names for any of the characters whereas all the smaller sets do part 2 box parts front of box back of box two instruction books parts this set has come under criticism for being overpriced  myself included  but the official piece count is 900 plus which is pretty good considering it also contains the baseplate 6 big bags and 2 of those 12x12 bricks in dark tan note set does not contain live black jungle panther™ the dss helpfully comes prescrunched thanks to tlc even in a aud150 set they cant get that right sigh the dark tan baseplate say what you like im in love i know some people dont like these but they were such a staple of castle pirates for so many years that i dont consider them a juniorised piece at all this one recycled from the 05 police hq and 06 hospital is much better in design than the king leos castle one as the different heights and asymmetry make it look much more like a natural piece of ground perfect for mocs and its dark tan  how could anyone not love such a huge slab of dark tan note this love doesnt extend to applying the stonework stickers which are frankly crap random instructions page part 3 temple of doom  or just a doomed temple the complete set front view isometricish view back view top view first impressions its very dark tan isnt it and green and bright green and dark green and dark red and normal tan and dark bley and pearl gold in fact its a bit of a mishmash of colours im of two minds about this i kind of prefer the palette to be a bit subtler but i can see that a playset designed for kids isnt going to sell bucketloads all tastefully done in shades of tan with lashings of darkgreen foliage theres a huge amount of dark red in this set which is always a welcome colour but im not convinced it quite works with the 2 shades of tan on offer here on the plus side theres also a huge amount of dark tan in ordinary 2x2 bricks tiles plates and 1x1 and 1x2x3 slopes which is great for anyone wanting to stock up lets take a closer look ill do this roughly in order of the build itself a the big scary face this is a simple fun build and very effective at projecting menace at the temple entrance it actually detaches very easily from the temple as pictured on the box art to allow easier access to the inside the eyes are flickfire missiles with scary faces hair conveniently providing ammo refills should you run out all in all from me b the back spin the skelly head and stone steps appear  we havent seen this feature in a while nice to get these pieces in dark bley a conquistador hides under the stairs  this is a bit useless as the stairs cant fully extend while hes there  moving right a trapdoor  what could possibly be behind it answer not much really a little red stair i really like these 2 stickers though  very intricate the staircase leads to what i like to think of as the crystal skull transmogrification chamber now i know nothing about the movie except that its supposed to be have a kind of 50s bmovie plot rumoured to feature look away spoilerhaters aliens these weird creepy gold chairs look made from the bones of aliens if you ask me with their strange vertebrae and silver claws it wouldnt surprise me if bringing these aliens back to life was part of the plot of the movie hence the crystal skull i guess well find out may 22 in any case transforming aliens clearly like a disco whirl as when you pull the handle the whole of this assembly spins giddily around a very clever and simple trick  its basically just a wheel under the platform but the effect is great also under here is a bottomless pit stickered i would very much expect a villian to be thrown down it at some point so do you come here often i dont know who designed this club these chairs are really uncomfortable nb i am really really over those pearl gold 1x2 roof corner slopes which started popping up in the 2006 castle range infected exoforce and have now spread here can we please have these in a different colour or a different pearl gold piece pretty please  c left tower looking from the front a small tower with a trans clear gem d right tower waterfall with booby trap i like the sticker its very cartoony which fits with the set somehow when you turn the wheel flick fire missiles spray out and hit whoever is on the stairs both towers have a trap where if you move the skull another one pops out from the dragon mouth e central turret thing this thing is kind of annoying and doesnt really sit or work well its kind of like a laser beam sending messages to space i guess as the central dome rises the two plates peel away i find it is a little bit tight to work smoothly and the two plates doesnt really sit well together at the top maybe i just need to rebuild it im sure this will also be explained in the movie f final trap  the stair that isnt there the final trap is at the front  as indy goes down the staircase you can push the red heads and all the 1x8 bley bricks come tumbling down simple and works well g alternate view heres how it looks as pictured on the box with the head removed as you can see this allows better access to the centre of the temple as you can see sadly there is nothing actually interesting there except a staircase to the turret and 2 dark tan slopes which are just stuck there and look a little out of place i mean come on everything else has a splash of dark red and gold your destination nowhere part 4 in conclusion so after all those endless pics what about the set itself consas a playset 7627 doesnt quite make sense admittedly the traps that are there are welldesigned and unobtrusive on the other hand theres a great big whopping entrance at the front  but i wasnt sure if the figs are supposed to sneak in through the backdoor and go up the spiral staircase and past the waterfall as shown in the box art or if they were meant to end up in the golden skull room the middle area doesnt really connect with anything nor does the giant space turret it may be that some of these questions are answered in the film but whereas with 7624 7625 and 7626 i could at least picture a story myself eg with river chase is fairly obvious whats happening  a chase down a river with a croc and a communist staking them out the temple set is a little all over the place the design feels a little off to me  not really bad but not really great either pros on the plus side the natives and crystal skulls themselves are great at 900 pieces this is also a great parts pack for dark tan dark red plant pieces gold oddments etc i especially love the baseplate in that shade i like the overall shape of the temple  a big staircase with secret nooks and crannies the build is reasonably interesting and there are some clever tricks with the traps but upon reflection i shouldnt have to sell this set  it should be able to sell itself as i said before im a huge fan of dark mysterious old temples so for that i have to give it some love it reminds me of the big old adventurers sets and the whiff of nostalgia is itself a powerful intoxicant however for the price lego is selling it in australia europe canada i couldnt recommend it as a mustbuy for full price when the smaller sets in this series are themselves so good review done  woo edited by imperialshadows 01 june 2008  1159 am	positive
the figs look great the natives and the skeleton conquistador are my favorite figures in the set the set itself is very good the interior sort of reminds me of an older style lego set for some reason it could be just me but it has a classic feel this will a great set to add to my list great review so far anyway i only saw the back of the box edited by general zen 01 may 2008  0217 am	positive
thanks sveltecorps i was really hoping that the conquistador helmet would end up being silver in the final set but i suppose its good to know that the helmet is being porduced again anyway and is the armour the skellie is wearing pearl gold thanks again i look forward to the rest of the review edit the dark tan baseplate is in fact very nice although the fact that you have to put stickers on it is a real downer but i suppose it is good for those who want it plain edited by tinypiesrus 01 may 2008  0219 am	positive

while i truely fell in love one more time with the older lego city sets i thought why not make a review of one of the in my opinion greatest city sets of all time lets not talk too much here we go set nr 6395 name victory lap racetrack number of minifigs 13  number of pieces unknown release year 1988 starting with the beautiful old legoland box front back with some cool alternative models inside we continue with the great minifigs which are not less than 13 i dont think there is any city set with more figures is there civilians race crew  assistant personnel drivers all heres a overview of the whole set the rescue rig dont exactly know how to call it with trailer the score board  traffic lights which would be one of the details i love the most about this set the next sweet detail the camera  cameraman of course we have a doc if there is some kind of accident the pit stop boxes i love the small toolholder with the axle and wheel behind it the control room high above the racetrack ready to go that was it all in allall i can say is if you see this set anywhere on ebay ore somewhere else get it	positive
thanks for this review you have reviewed my most favourite town set of all times i am so happy to own this one i actually is a story to go along with it in the summer of 1998 i went on holiday with my parents to the country of luxembourg in the city of wiltz we encountered a small toystore which still had this set for sale 9 years after the release i did not had the sufficient amount of money to buy the set and had to leave it at the store i was practically in tears four years later we passed through luxembourg and i remembered the city and the store we made a detour and stopped by the same store every other old set was sold the only one remaining was this one i bought it immediately and treasured it ever since i use the baseplates a lot in my cities they serve well as roads with parking spaces next to them this was the first set i owned which had the huge 6x24 plates in them i remember my surprise when seeing plates of such enourmous lenght i recently made an entire racetrack together with this set and to promote myself i will place a link here	positive
metalandi thanks for this wonderful lovely review i enjoyed myself very much when i am looking through at the lovely pictures i must admit this is what i called a real classic race prix i miss those cute sweet little race cars which is able to contain a minifig furthermore this set offers 4 race cars and 13 minifigures in addition if town collectors remember the car number tiles are printed instead of using stickers this is the other set i owned which holds the similarity above 6381 motor speedway overall great review simonwillems on may 9 2008 0220 am said i recently made an entire racetrack together with this set and to promote myself i will place a link here i saw your entire racetrack it looks real exciting and i love your layout real nice edited by whitefang 15 may 2008  0956 am	neutral

hello all i dont believe there has been a review of this set yet so i wanted to take this opportunity up for review today is 8160 cruncher block and racer x as part of batbrick and iamded reviews here is the box i have to say i love the art on it its very colourful and makes the truck look a lot less crap than it does on the box plus you have to love the missile launching action bit right am i right why are you all staring at me and here is the back pretty generic but shows some nice details and so forth oh dear in turning around the box have i killed myself and iamded okey dokey up first is the best part of the entire set the minifigs racer x is wonderful though coming with a boring bruce wayne face but it is cruncher block his lady driver taejo that really shine look at those awesome suits the cool faces taejo has a ripped shirt now up is the first building part of the set with me and iamded looking rather slick in xs car while im not a big fan of yellow it is very nice and slopes in an underused colour is better than no slopes at all front view the new windshields are fantastic while a very cool car it is rather silly of tlc to give us the exact same one we got in the smaller set i didnt get the smaller set with this car so im still happy but it is a bad marketing move sorry iamded i know its your birthday butvroom now for the second part of the build and my favourite the front of the truck annoyingly enough this part opens up to shoot a pointless rubber projectile to do this you open the roof a nice detail btw and pull back the mechanism here thus blowing the front part open and launching itwell not far really the wheels and covers are pretty cool and the front is nicely designed the red looks good and the rear vision mirrors are a great touch and now for the most disappointing part  step three the trailer note  clicky joint piece not part of set just used to hold it up thats right almost the entire thing is open even the filled in side has holes id certainly be cared to be back there one bumpy hill and back you go i didnt put the lame computer stickers on and the control area is pretty lame in general not to mention taejo who is depicted on the boxart as standing at the desk would most likely just be sucked out the back at those speeds there are some pluses too though like the ridiculously awesome minifig paintings ill be using for wayne manor also note the control on crunchers desk that when turned turns the gun at the bottom its an alright feature here is an example ive shot iamded on his birthday what its a love ray havent you seen the care bears and though im not a massive fan of stickers this is just too cool the little aquarium is very simple but very clever using a printed piece between two clear windows to create the illusion of a tank it looks much better in real life trust me and here is a side view to better explain now to connect the two is a good thing i like the way a simple technic piece assumes the job oh and behold my hand the completed truck which while a mixed bag still doesnt look too bad i guess now the completed set which despite its unbelievable large flaws still looks cool warning the kickass iamded and batbrick figures do not come with this set more pics here httpwwwbrickshelycgii3147324 all in all minifigs 55  racer x is beautiful cruncher block and the driver too and taejo has a ripped shirt damn design 25  pretty poor considering the best part is available in a cheaper set and only the front part of the truck looks cool but still not truly awful build 35  despite having a bad trailer it was a fun build and sometimes you need something that doesnt take ages to make price 25  overpriced easily but rogue shadow is worse fun 35  the mere concept of such an open truck kept me playing with this baby for hours total 1525 not as bad as it would seem overall im really glad i bought it as the minifigs are fantastic and the paintings and fish tank are cool its fun stupid and downright ridiculous but while not a great set by any means certainly isnt as bad in the brick as it looks in photos until next time batbrick away edited by batbrick 13 june 2008  1220 pm	negative
awesome review batbrick i dont see any appeal at all really in this set but thats okay as i want to stick to castle anyway the car is the best part imo which you can get in a different set with another cool car and for a cheaper price but the main downfall to this set is the fact that the trucks trailer is half blown up and the survivors are magically staying inside and not being sucked right out of there as you have mentioned i would have thought tlc would at least included some sort of cover that you could take on and off easily kind of like the modular buildings having said all that though the front of the truck does look incredibly cool and those minifigs are sweet too bad they all have flesh tone printed on them so while this may not be my set of choice i can see the appeal well really i cant but its just my opinion im sure there are plenty others who would love to scoop this set up peace	negative
ill be passing on this set thanks for the review anyway is everyone supposed to be bald in the film it looks weird	negative
warning this reply may contain several minor movie spoilers if you havent yet seen the movie and want it to be a complete surprise do not read batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said but it is cruncher block his lady driver taejo that really shine look at those awesome suits the cool faces taejo has a ripped shirt i was originally skepitcal about the driver figure—i like the head but i was trying to figure out why they put in a female minifig with no hairpiece after having seen the movie i now understand why crunchers driver is a fairly manly looking woman and most of the lego hairpeices would make the minifig look too girly for the character  now that i know why taejos shirt is ripped up i dont mind the bits of fleshie color that are printed on it but i do wish they would make some of the new torsos a little more headcolour agnostictheres no real reason why cruncher and his driver couldnt have had ties that came all the way up to their necks instead of having those little wedges of flesh showing through loose collars yeah they are lowlevel mafioso type scum but they arent complete slobs batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said front view the new windshields are fantastic they are indeed very nice its the main reason i started looking at the speed racer sets in the first place batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said while a very cool car it is rather silly of tlc to give us the exact same one we got in the smaller set i didnt get the smaller set with this car so im still happy but it is a bad marketing move i think the error they made was in the smaller set though in the movie the only time we see crunchers semi is when hes being chased by racer x racer x and taejo do end up on the same team for a cross country rally race along with speed of course so i guess thats where they were going by putting those two together in the smaller set but it would have been much more interesting for them to have made up a set with taejo and one of the cars from the very goofy comic bookgimmicky teams they are racing against especially since one of the teams that is chasing taejo specifically is a bunch of armywannabee loonies—im sure more people would have loved some sort of darksand green racer with one of the ij soviets at the wheel than another racer x to summarize two racer xs is bad but it is the smaller set that should have been changed imho batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said annoyingly enough this part opens up to shoot a pointless rubber projectile thus blowing the front part open and launching itwell not far really as much as i normally dont like the stupid techic launcher thing and would rather not see it in a set ever again although one of these days i will make a giant multilauncer rig out of them just for fun at least there is a reason for it to be in this set as crunchers semi has a missile launcher in the front end of it in the movie i think youre supposed to lift the panel that hides the missile before launching it similar to the way that panels slide out of the way on the semi cab to allow for firing in the movie batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said and now for the most disappointing part  step three the trailer thats right almost the entire thing is open even the filled in side has holes id certainly be cared to be back there one bumpy hill and back you go im gonna chock this up to the standard lego philosophy of playset rather than model design for a lot of things the semi rig and raver xs car are the models the trailer is the playset seeing as how the trailer is crunchers mobile office rather finely appointed with lots of paintings and his pirahna babies in their tank behind his desk and the intent seems more or less to have a playest bit in order for kids to reenact the scene from the movie im not going to give them too much grief over this they tried to capture the basic bits of the movie set which we see mostly from the inside during the movie and translate it into a playset type environment that being said i do wish the back walls were more solid as i see no reason for there to be gaps in the back wall when the front wall or the fourth wall as the case may be here is already conspicously absent batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said there are some pluses too though like the ridiculously awesome minifig paintings ill be using for wayne manor also note the control on crunchers desk that when turned turns the gun at the bottom its an alright feature could have been a little better but its such a minor bit of this scene in the movie that i can see why they didnt spend too much time and effort on it it would have been nice to have more paintings though had the back wall been more complete and i like your idea of how to use them   batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said and though im not a massive fan of stickers this is just too cool the little aquarium is very simple but very clever using a printed piece between two clear windows to create the illusion of a tank definately a feature which is not showcased nearly well enough on the box art since it is one of the major features of this set in the movie its nice to see it translate rather well into brick batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said design 25  pretty poor considering the best part is available in a cheaper set and only the front part of the truck looks cool but still not truly awful that may be a bit harsh but not much given what ive said further up this post but it probably only deserves a 3 at best so im not realy going to quibble the point  i still think that racer x should be exclusive to this set and a different car should be in the smaller set with taejo which would have improved the cachet for this set overall batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said price 25  overpriced easily but rogue shadow is worse truethis should have ideally been about a 30 set especially given the general awesomeness of the ij race for the stolen treasure set unless they made the trailer a bit more detailed better back wall perhaps some drop down gun ports like in the movie or at put least one or more of crunchers goons in the set then maybe i could agree more with the msrp on that note if i remember correctly from my visit to my local tru yesterday in search of the new ij sets since local targets seem determined not to get them in stock yet they had this set on sale for around 35 along with an offer for a coupon good for 750 towards the purchase of a ticket to the movie with any speed racer toy purchase over 25 i may be wrong on the sale price but i know the ticket offer was there so if you havent seen the movie yet and are interested in this set tru may be the place to go right now to get both at a slightly cheaper price batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said fun 45  the mere concept of such an open truck kept me playing with this baby for hours so you did enjoy the playest aspect of the trailer even though you didnt care for the designlooks like they didnt do too badly then on what they wanted out of that bit  batbrick on may 10 2008 0605 am said overall im really glad i bought it as the minifigs are fantastic and the paintings and fish tank are cool its fun stupid and downright ridiculous but while not a great set by any means certainly isnt as bad in the brick as it looks in photos i was actually thinking about going and getting this set now that ive seen the movie and i understand what the heck is going on here more your review has definately added an additional impetus to that notion my pocketbook does not thank you	neutral
batbrick thanks for the sweet review you give me great insights into this set hehe i agreed that racer x is nice but i believe we can get it in the other set for a much lower price for me the trailer which does not have a cover is bugging me alot thats why i holding my reservations against this set at most i will consider the other 2 smaller sets for collection purpose nevertheless batbrick great job	negative
thank you for the nice review	neutral
i enjoyed the review some cool fleshie heads and parts but it does seem a bit lamer even than i imagined from the box the airy truck is rather slyly disguised on the box art i would like to get it if it is ever on sale 50 off would be nice  speed racer lego doesnt seem to be selling too well in local shops here	neutral
hi all newly arrived today dont you just love shop at home thought id give it a quick review see more details over at my site the tumbler jokers ice cream suprise	neutral
nice reviewim surprised these are out already ill probably end up passing on this one even with the surprise 	neutral
that is a very nice and quick review thanks for giving us a quick summary not much comments on this set as i do not really go into batman theme yet however the ice cream truck in the set interest me apart from that nothing much yet who knows maybe i will change my mind in the future	neutral

great review as always although i know you dont take many pictures in your reviewsimho  but can we see a little more about the tumbler is that little windshield down near the bottom front a third seat what is in the framework of the back behind the cockpit i know theres a blunt shooter and flick fire missiles but is it all framework	neutral
thanks a lot for the review brickbitz i really love this set sure the figs are annoyingly not new but the ice cream truck is fantastic and the tumbler is a marvel of black slopes i see now that it is far too huge though i reckon i will either keep it that way as a mega tumbler mod it to become another battank keep it as a model tumbler or pull it apart and use the bits to make a tumbler like wetwires awesome one love those popsicles though and those wheels are very nice so overall as a loyal batfan i love the set even though it couldve been better batbrick away	positive
nice review i really cant believe that it is out already i love that new batman suit and the tumbler have they made the posicles before this is sure a must have	positive
a nice review of an interesting set thanks brickbitz a great new batman a funny ice cream truck and a pretty detailed tumbler and although i wish that vehicle would be just a bit smaller i almost wonder that it´s not even bigger compared to tlc´s other batvehicles and well the interior could be better too	positive
brickbitz on may 16 2008 1141 pm said ill get some set up tomorrow in better light to be honest there isnt a lot to see most of it is just basic technic blocks underneath with all the slopes built up on top some more pics of the tumbler	neutral
general grievous reviewed by dunamis set 10186 1085 pieces 8995 from lego shop  home build time 35 hours it is the start of summer here in california and along with the weekly deluge of new action films we start to see some of the next wave of star wars lego sets the latest offering from our favorite building toy company is none other than the infamous general grievous no doubt you all know the story of grievous two parts technic and one part human and his hatred of the jedi follow along as we get a closeup view of the mighty general no doubt the observant will wonder why i purchased this set from shop  home instead of my trusty lego store in glendale well it’s really as simple as two things i’ve been traveling a lot and didn’t have time to drive to the store to get it and gas is now 4gallon and i would likely spend more in gas than the 9 shipping cost to get it to me so there you have it the box a gigantic box much larger than expected held the mighty general we’re back to the perforated tabs on the side and two stickers on the front that let the box lift open inside we have 17 bags two manuals and three stickers on a relatively small sticker sheet the manuals the manuals are not terribly thick in fact the second manual is noticeably thinner than the first they come in at 75 and 31pages interesting to note on the back we see the next and more interesting wave of sets later this summer nothing new to report on the manuals as they provide the lego standard of high quality and features we expect  piece callouts  models divided into sections  large images  page numbers since there were links posted to the pdf files of the instructions online i’m sure you can all get an idea of the manual and the parts inventory however for those of you without access to the internet here are photos of the parts inventory pages random manual image features page the pieces the short answer is you get lots and lots of little pieces in white gray and black plus some big pieces in white gray and black mixed in the set is a fair amount of oddball pieces like minifig tools jedi hood and trans yellow dome fear not despite the eclectic collection of parts it all comes together in the end not unlike a typical day at work for me… it is probably worth noting again that there is a heavy amount of technic parts and pieces here the build the build starts off with a rather indepth build of the stand in which general grievous stands on once you think you are done you keep adding on to this rather solid base i bet there are 250 pieces just in the base alone it is quite nice when you get done with it though and really adds to the display i’m glad lego didn’t skimp on the base as it completes the model once you get through all that the rest of the build is a real thumbbruiser anyone who has built a decent size technic set knows the feeling of your thumbs being sore when you are done you get the same effect here it is actually a fun build and i really liked seeing how the designers used all the various pieces to recreate a fairly accurate model of grievous the model is built from the ground up as seen in a few of the progress shots here is what is left over the design the design is quite good and is very accurate some might be disappointed that since this is a technic set we don’t have more articulation in the shoulders and have the ability to separate two arms into four as seen in the movie however it would seem the real intent is for display and not functionality here is a shot of the torso and the detail involved here are grievous’ organs careful observers will note that my model is lacking two “arrow” stickers from the two white chest pieces i failed to see these on the sticker sheet and only grabbed the large grievous sticker so note that there are actually three stickers and not one chest protector and respirator head and arms i was a little disappointed that we got two yellow blades and no green blades on the lightsabers note how all the lightsabers have different hilts which is a nice touch here are some shots of the completed model with a few other sets shown for scale he is actually pretty tall you have the option to remove the top two arms and put in shoulder plates if you so desire detail on the back overall thoughts i’ve been saying for a few years that we should have a technic grievous set and we finally got one designed more as a model and not a fully functional swooshable figure grievous is a tad flimsy you won’t want him to veer too far off his massive and sturdy base it would have been nice to have is cape with him like the technic vader set i do like the size of the model and it is impressive to look at lego star wars system fans will likely want to think twice before purchasing but technic and ucs fans should be satisfied final rating 75 build 810 very good – fun relatively quick build technic fans will be more pleased than others design 810 very good – some nice snot and technic techniques a bit flimsy but the base is kind of cool parts 710 a mixed bag of stuff probably can’t get too many diverse builds from this except for other robot type models price 710 just ok – a bit stiff at 90 usd for a nice display model with limited functionality as always let’s hear your thoughts and feedback	positive
excellent review dunamis this set looks great the designers really though the kit out it seems the internal organs have got to be my favorite part but everything is good now all we need is a ucs obiwan with a laser pistol to finish off grievous in a totally anticlimatic way	positive
nice review dunamis  i built it two weeks ago on the legoworld speedbuild in oslo and didn´t have time to get the feel during that crazy race i agree with you that the base is nice  sturdy makes it stand real still  i´m looking forward on your next score four eyes arms on copmike	positive
cool i like the idea of using the hood as an organ dunamis reviews on	positive
thanks for this very detailed review dunamis didnt think that gg were that big he looks pretty good to me but ill save the 90€ for the upcoming cw sets	positive
ok here are a couple of shots of the head and eyes a very nice effect any silly me in my first set of photos above i never folded in his ribcage you guys gotta call me out on these things here is what it is supposed to look like anyway carry on	neutral
quote since there were links posted to the pdf files of the instructions online i’m sure you can all get an idea of the manual and the parts inventory however for those of you without access to the internet here are photos of the parts inventory pages luckily for me i have access to the internet to read this review in the first place seriously though nice review my girlfriend has told me that i cant have this one after we just got through a 3day build of the 10030 star destroyer but im sure i can turn her around eventually 	positive
awesome review dunamis thats such a sweet set i loved it as soon as i thoroughly examined the online instructions it looks way awesome in the brick my favourite part has to be the eyes very cool and creepy thanks again for the info and of course the pics peace	positive

great review very detailed indeed	neutral
thanks for the great review sad to say as cool as he looks hes a saleonly set for me	neutral
thanks very much for the review brickbitz i love this years mars mission line and though this is the weakest set it is still a major improvement the mech is very cool and well made and the commander is one of my favourite alien figs ever the alien ship is pretty good better than last years ones but not extremely good either but i still like the set batbrick away	positive
thanks for the sweet review brickbitz that really is a neat little set that walker is fantastic most likely the best part of the set though the alien craft does also look neat and its cool how it can fold down into aa walker or rather a sentry turret seeing as it cant really move while in that mode still its nice my favourite part is the mini mining robot though so cute peace	positive

hi yall guess what happened today when walked into my toys r us in fullerton ca just to buy a simple tiny turbo racer what do i see all the agents sets sitting on the shelf ready for the taking i didnt have too much money with me so i just got 2 of 8631 mission 1 jetpack pursuit its a really cool little set so i thought id review this puppy for you i shall proceed in the order of the instructions so lets get started the minifigs lets begin with the minifigs saw fist and agent chase they are really cool some of the coolest minifigs i have seen in a while i took off saw fists wig  chainsaw so you can see his head and cybernetic arm better here is a back view of saw fist and  surprise agent chase has a double sided head one side with his cool mission face with sunglasses and headset and one with his casual bruce wayne type face note though that it is not really the bruce wayne face his wig btw is mutts hairpiece in black very neat poor saw fist seems to be forced to always drag his chainsaw around for it is way too long to just hang down from his shoulder like a normal arm the snowmobile next up we have the snowmobile a sleek little vehicle with only minor design flaws the container with the jewel is attached to the vehicle by a single stud so it doesnt fall off but is easy to pick up in the pic below you can see the only two tiny design flaws thanks to the exhaust pipes the laser cannon or whatever its supposed to be cant be lowered any further than this also the corners of that slopeish piece that the handle bar rests on are sticking out a little at the sides other than that its pretty well done the jetpack finally there is the jetpack imo a name like autogyropack or something would make more sense but whatever although a little bulky the jetpack is very well designed the rotor can be tilted back and at the lower back of the jetpack there is hook with which you can grab the container with the jewel from the snowmobile what i like best about the jetpack is that although it is attached to the minifig in kinda the same way as that of the riddler this one doesnt rotate around so the agent is being held in place steadily see ya later chainsawcyborgdude stickers this set comes with a surprisingly large sticker sheet the reason is that half of it are extra stickers there are two large agents logos and one inferno logo  perfect for agents mocs there are also a star and a small round sticker portraying the number of the mission the star seems to be part of some kind of game where you collect the stars from all sets on an agents id that you get from the mission 5 set i dont know though if you get any gain from this except for becoming a fullstatus lego agent below you can find the list of parts from this set click here for a better quality pic thats pretty much it i hope you liked this review and will run straight to your next toy store to get one or more of this set this was my very first set review so any questions comments or requests any more pics you want me to take would you like me to exchange the chainsaw with something else or do you want me to try the agents new hairpiece out on another fig if so just tell me see ya edited by oky wan kenobi 25 june 2009  0821 pm	positive
thanks for the excellent review oky judging by this set the line is going to be promising i really like the figs and im glad to see that robot arm is actually a new arm mold awesome can a minifig hand fit in the end or just the chainsaw attachment could it fit an exoforce robot claw theres a lot of detail in the torsos and i like that the agents suit is like a motocross uniform i love that the snowmobile has a working tread copmike ras and i tried to build a snowmobile with working treads but we ended up using chainsaw blades in the end great work oky	positive
this is much much much more promising than the 2008 batman set for 1000 the vehicle looks like someone took time to design it but the batman one looks like  lego dear lego where is the quality for batman i really like the new cyborg arm and the propellers on that thing   it is a really promising line although i would get rid of all those bionicle pieces	positive
thanks for the review im looking forward to some of the new parts and ideas in this line the figures look great the actual sets themselves dont really appeal though	neutral
this set looks wicked thanks very much for the sweet review oky wan the pics are perfect great quality and the perfect size well done this sets got everything a new hairpiece tank treads a gem well i could go on but you can all see everything from the great pics thanks again oky this is one set ill definately be getting peace	neutral
huhm  i like the idea of the agentid  but offcourse all they want with that is that you buy all six sets  but it can be a good idea for children they wouldnt think of hey they get all money only because i have a little card with stars or something well not to rant i think its good also can you make that name yourself maybe set 5 comes with a extra stickersheed with all letters that would be nice agent rupee a very nice review oky wan kenobi rupee	neutral
oky wan thanks for this wonderful review i really have mixed feelings towards agents set haha but i love the agent minifigure the doublesided face is great and i love the sunglass look its nice that they made use of mutts hairpiece which is personally my fave hairpiece at the moment the jetpack is neat making use of the additional secure backing onto the minifig is really very smart	positive
i kind of like the set as said it has a very cartoonish style to it so im guessing the kids are going to love it and as a parent ill love it if the construction isnt to fragile  ill probably be getting a few for myself but only as parts pack copmike on may 18 2008 1129 am said and the excaustpipe is a new peace also i think yeah and its all over this years releases from what ive seen so far its found in racers speed racers mars mission and exoforce sets i just wish that instead of a 2x1 plate with an exhaustpipe in each end they would have made it an 1x1 plate with a single exhaust that would have been a lot more useful	positive
is there any chance u could post pics of the comic and the box i love legos box art and instruction art	neutral
i love the way the bad guy has a special attachment on the jewel case just to allow the agent to grab it with his hook its like the two of them sat down beforehand and drew up the plans for the vehicle together cyborg ok and then ill make my getaway in the special snowmobile and you can follow me agent and ill scoop up the jewel and return it to foil your plan cyborg perfect see you tuesday dr s	positive
hmm interesting set great review i might pick this one up for the wonderful parts vbbn	neutral
what a lovely set thanks for that fine review oky wan kenobi the mfs´re wonderful that helipack looks solid and well done and i especially like the slightly asymmetrical design of the neat snowmobile a very playable little set for sure and the most interesting part´s for sure that new cool mf arm	positive
they are already on the shelfs thats kinda weird since there arent even the instructions online yet	neutral
yay oky wan wow the agents line is looking good so far the jetpack is pretty nice and the minifigs my dad was in portland just yesterday and if id have called an hour sooner he might have been able to get to the tru	neutral
thanks for the great review oky wan at first i didnt think i liked the agents sets but the more i see them the better i think they look i will definitely pick up 1 or 2 of the sets i really like the jet pack and the figs look great that double face is very nice tlg should make more figs with these faces in my opinion	neutral
great reviewthank youvery much i think this line is much more promising than most orginally thought it would be im onmy way to see ifican find the big rig right now	neutral
thank you for the nice review it has some big pieces i dont like but the minifigs are good	positive

wow thanks for the great review sirnadroj the overall set is what attracted me in the first place that elevated hut and swampy setting just sucked me right in it all looks really nice to me a definite buy that agents head would make a great indy for those opposed to fleshies and that monobrow i mean villain guy looks very er well the monobrow is unique thought i noticed the suit looks a bit skin tight in the crotchal area dont look at me like that you saw it too anyway the helmets the best part about the villain great for warhammer 40000 orks peace	positive
great review and a good confirmation of exactly what i suspected this is a parts line for me much like exoforce before it this will be the theme i pick up when im out of other things or its on sale plus those dark green alligators bring tears of joy to an old pirate alice on may 22 2008 1243 am said i always joked that our house would have a moat around it with mechanical alligators you were joking what about the monkeys and the miniature golf course dont ruin my dreams 	positive

ive copied another thing because i dont know how i must do a review and i cant do long reviews set ref 7884 name the buggy the escape of mr freeze number of minifigs 2 number of pieces 76 price 1395€ front of the box back of the box the comic very close whats in the box without the set the set with the box the time wow this is a funny set but its a little expensive and a little to small but i like some pieces like the fire and the mr freeze gun and the best of all here it comes no stickers thats one of the greatest things but i understand why lego has made this set some people want batman lego and they are most of the time expensive and the mr freeze set is also expensive but this set not if you want more pics you msut ask for exaple for the minifigs or the mr freeze and the blaster ask it and this is my first review and sorry for the great and blurry pics the final verdict 7510 figures 810 playability 610 build 710 pieces 7510	positive
very nice review riddler	neutral
thanks for an interesting review theriddler the set´s cheap and very useful to get two fantastic mfs a great mr freeze and a very cool new batman but i have to say that these two small vehicles just look plain ugly imho without any inspiration nor orginality sorry tlc but you can for sure do better than that and even with less pieces	neutral
nice review thanks i really like those little gokart thingies theyve got a fantastic mario kart look to them	positive
thanks for the review ill probably get one copy of this set mr freeze and his cart look neat i dont like the huge wing on the back of batmans buggy so ill probably mod that out	neutral
quote but i have to say that these two small vehicles just look plain ugly imho without any inspiration nor orginality indead the only reason to get this set is if you couldnt afford the batcave back in 2006 and want a mr freeze fig for a cheap price and anyone who did get that kit really have no reason whatsoever to get this wait did i forget something oh yeah  thanks for the review riddler edited by grevious 22 may 2008  1154 pm	neutral
grevious on may 23 2008 0954 am said indead the only reason to get this set is if you couldnt afford the batcave back in 2006 and want a mr freeze fig for a cheap price and anyone who did get that kit really have no reason whatsoever to get this ill get it i admit the vehicles are extremely poorly designed i mean really poorly designed but the mrfreeze fig is fantastic and i would buy two of this set just for him as his head and gear are very useful for mocing it also comes with some nice pieces like the grappling hook little wheels exhaust pieces and such still a pretty bad set build wise but it has atleast inspired me to make my own batbuggy thanks for the review theriddler appreciated batbrick away	positive
thanks for the review for such a high price that we need to fork out compared to a total pieces of 76 its is very expensive to pay for such poor design but then i will still considered to get them as what sinner had said this is a very good way to get mr freeze without getting the batcave and it so happened that i do not have the batcave too i believed that is the cheapest set among the four so for the minifigs only this set is recommended other than that i am sorry	neutral
like many others ill buy this just for mr f quickly recycle the parts and pretend this set never existed the flame detail is indeed terrible the bat is back  and hes flatulent this third batwave isnt really doing anything for me ill get the penguin set as well for pretty much the same reason  although the sub on that is pretty cool  but skip the others maybe batbrick can make us all nice altmocs to improve these sets thanks for the review though	negative
thanks for the review theriddler this is a neat little set a bit overpriced in my opinion but for a new suited batman and a mr freeze fig in a set other than one of the most expensive batsets released its worth my money peace	positive
wowie im glad you like it maby il do the tumbler also but soon the batcycle and the scuba also come	neutral
pretty nice review for a first time theriddler next time though if your camera has it use the macro function little flower icon and perhaps a tripod that should get rid of any blur and provide you with better pictures apart from that a good little review keep up the good work	neutral
neat little set i do like the parts a number of hard to find bits all in one pack depending on how much it costs in usd ill have to consider it and while the buggy designs kinda suck im a little happy to see them its been years since tlc made any small go kart style vehicles i guess tiny turbos have been overshadowing that market	positive
thats a great set itd be even better if it were sold as two separate little cars they remind me of the dozens of little lego cart vehicles i got as a kid those were always fun quick builds that resulted in lots of cool play i think this set is aimed more at kids and in that respect its a pure winner it doesnt hurt that you can get freeze and the newly designed batman both in this set for a reasonable price	positive
hollisbrick on may 23 2008 0239 pm said thanks for the reveiw the figs are bloody great but those cars are a bit well ill put it blantly retarded although they shall be good after some modding and whats with that grapple hook does it even have a rope so i guess batman will hokk it to mr freeze so his ride looks more ugle anyway can you pleese take some pics of the figs ill do and do someone also another review of the 7888 the tumbler	neutral
thanks for the review this set was poorly design when i first heard of it i think it was like a car with a much better design than this one i think i will get it for the minifigs	negative
thanks for the extra pics i dont think you could have gone into much more detail than that nice pics of the joker van too will you do a review of that one batbrick away	positive
in actuality i think that this may be my favorite batman set of all time i know i know  its a small set with crappy tiny vehicles so it probably sucks for the fan who likes to display sets but look at the mocing side and you see this set has a ton of potential new batman fig well mainly the torso but it looks nice sleek and armored a definite plus whether youre a mocist or batfan mr freeze because nobody bought the batcave when they should haveand by nobody i mean me plus i love that head cheapest way to amass the lightning piece the other sets that have it are lolhueg well not really but i dont have 50 to toss around on a little skeleton tower and its a great piece two little blue gems i may be alone on this but those are my favorite parts the gems and thats my favorite color for them 3 3 3 several other useful parts including a o piece in black some lightmedium blue bits from mr freezes kart the oddly placed grappling hook and some cheap wheels now i dont know about you guys but this is as close to a batman battlepack as were going to get lol  im buying at least three maybe more once i get my summer job  oh and the fact that the us price is only 10 helps a little but this year you guys cant complain  you got practically every set first especially the new castle tt trexxen	positive

thanks for the review deino i love going back through the old agents thread just to see how wrong we were about these awesome sets i actually really like the gate those portcullis pieces people may know i always find nice uses for and i really really really want that awesome sound brick the figs are a bit disappointing in numbers but agent chase is very cool generic henchman are great and spy clops is one of my favourite minifigs ever the helicopter is wonderful too i love that it is customised for spy clops to winch him down the colours as usual for these sets are fantastic the dark blue orange and chrome silver the car is the best though i love all the functions how does the ejector seat work though batbrick away	positive
thanks for the awesome review deinonychus this really is a sweet set a bit expensive a set for me as i only get the cheaper noncastle sets which is a shame because i love that head it would be great for some more cyborg troops the car is awesome i didnt expect it to have that many silver parts thats fantastic heaps of play features too that ejector seat mechanism sounds interesting thanks again for the sweet review peace	positive
deinonychus on may 23 2008 0912 pm said the rear has two cones sticking out id like to think theyre smoke nozzles or oilslick sprayers according to page 14 of my brickmaster magazine the left cone is for smoke screen and the right cone is for oil slick	neutral

esjpg 4794k 110 downloads the ejector seat a long technic axle runs the length of the front of the car it comes in to the seat area here and nests into the gray joint which is attached to the small gray technic beam the beam is attached to the ejector seat bottom white 3x2 plate with a technic pin the seat in turn is attached to the side of the car with a technic pin the result is when the axle is pushed forward the gray joint and beam tilt the seat and eject a minifig after about 20 shots the minifig only went outside of the car 3 timesthe rest of the time he just bounced around the inside of the car so they get an a for effort but an f for execution	neutral
thanks for the great review im really liking these agents sets the more i see them the car seems to have alot of features its to bad the the ejection seat doesnt work as well as one would hope oh well makes me want the big rig even more now	positive
looking closely at the red cones on the missles and grey cones on the cars rear these appear to be a new piece note how there is a slight stopper ridge at the base of their top stud interestingly the trans green cones on the helicopter seem to be of the older mould style	neutral
thanks for your great review it looks very nice indeed the gate have very interesting mechanism the car looks very slick and cool it looks like those typical kind of james bond car this review gives me very good insights	positive

hello all eurobricks members i will present to you a very short review on the recent castle battlepacks this time i will be reviewing skeleton battlepack and i hope everyone of you do enjoy viewing it this was a request that put up by hollisbrick in the castle thread initally i thought it was a very simple set to do a review however for the love of castle i decided to whip this up for every castle fan out there this is an image of how the skeleton battlepacks look like i have bought 12 last packs of these in total so far but none of the crown battlepacks yet there were snapped much faster that i imagined do pardon me for the poor lightning today is a bad weather its hard to get natural light the skeleton gang for a single battlepack like this with an attractive reasonable price you obtained a series of 5 skeleton minifigs with tons and tons of useful castle accessories to me its a very very great buy and its a must to stock up for my army building some addons however i was not very satisfied with my skeleton armies standards therefore i decided to make some slight modifications with some additional castle accessories that is stocked in my castle warehouse after the makeover ok this is what i called a real skeleton army this is mainly my opnion and it have to be aligned with my standards i felt this improved battlepack gives a punch to the exisitng battlepack the two soliders on the right is able to align with the rest of my castle chess sets armies while the one on the left it gives me a great archer back up with the quiver and helmet attached to him the ones on the center especially the armored guard which equipped with the black nose cone helmet is my fave it is able to illustrate the elite among the rest of the guards with its armor and helmet which was featured in my castle deep forest expansion moc promotion on in addition the one which was hastly done with a modify mace it looks rather simple in time to come i will change it and gives a better equipment and look these are the remains i can use the axe for my dwarf in my dwarf mine defender in that set there is no weapon for my dwarf and i have to get it from other sets the rest of the accessories makes a very good stock up for future upgrading overall 910 this is not a playset it is mainly bought for its abilty to mass recurit any armies and is a main love for all castle army builders such as me this set mainly have no major faults and i love it so much although i have done some slight modifciations but this set is a must for me to buy more and more meanwhile i will need to wait for the next shipment hope everyone have enjoying viewing this simple review of mine edited by whitefang 25 may 2008  1252 pm	positive
thanks for the review whitefang i love these sets and i wish they were available in nz so far it seems they may never come here but i can sit and hope i like the look of them after your makeover a real skeleton army there did you say youve bought 12 thts lots of skelies are you planning a big moc or something	positive
thanks for the review it wasnt really a request but more of an imply to do it anyway great review cant wait til these come to aus probably when the rest of the castle comes out in september though	positive
whitefang on may 25 2008 0614 am said for a single battlepack like this with an attractive reasonable price you obtained a series of 5 skeleton minifigs with tons and tons of useful castle accessories to me its a very very great buy and its a must to stock up for my army building i wish these battlepacks had a reasonable price click here to see the canadian price of these battlepacks 18 dollars thats 6 dollars more than the starwars battlepack yet you get the same amount of lego or less then a starwars battlepack how the megablok does lego price its items  im gonna have to skip this set and a few others that i wanted because of this bloody outrageous back on topic thanks for the detailed review whitefang i also like your little changes to the set they really make this set look better	negative
thanks whitefang castle battle packs simply wonderful finally a dream came true well done tlc	positive
thanks whitefang i love this battlepack but can only really hope to get one still great accesories and a spider thats great batbrick away	positive
hollisbrick on may 25 2008 0854 pm said thanks for the review it wasnt really a request but more of an imply to do it anyway great review cant wait til these come to aus probably when the rest of the castle comes out in september though well i am glad you enjoyed this review i hope these excellent battlepacks will reach the coast of australia and the rest of the world soon guess then we will have to wait till september 08 mammymarf on may 25 2008 1137 pm said thanks for the review i wanted to see what was in this set looks good is it sold in stores yes i have bought these from stores in my country however it came in limited quantity and it was snapped out within moments mack on may 26 2008 1247 am said i wish these battlepacks had a reasonable price click here to see the canadian price of these battlepacks 18 dollars thats 6 dollars more than the starwars battlepack yet you get the same amount of lego or less then a starwars battlepack how the megablok does lego price its items  im gonna have to skip this set and a few others that i wanted because of this bloody outrageous back on topic thanks for the detailed review whitefang i also like your little changes to the set they really make this set look better mack i am glad you liked the little changes i made yes the price for the battlepacks is a little steep however for the amount of minifigs and castle accessories the price and quantity justifiy my bulk purchase this is one way to acquired soldiers without spending much money on other sets in this way you will save much more i understand the concern of star wars battlepacks from your country but in my country star wars battlepacks are priced much much higher than the castle battlepacks asuka on may 26 2008 0138 am said thanks whitefang castle battle packs simply wonderful finally a dream came true well done tlc asuka i agreed with you totally this is indeed a dream come true batbrick on may 26 2008 0659 am said thanks whitefang i love this battlepack but can only really hope to get one still great accesories and a spider thats great batbrick away batbrick you must get one of these packs i am sure it will help you in your batman medival mocs there are many possibilites for you to play around and custom with your minifigs this battlepack and of course crown battlepack too will prove useful to you edited by whitefang 26 may 2008  0241 am	positive
no offence make this 799 can too expensive to be coming with only a few figures 20 earns you the same amount of figs plus a catapult barricade two horses and a jousting divider	negative
mack on may 26 2008 0130 pm said you cannot say that the battle pack contains the same amount of stuff that the other two sets have and therefore should be priced the same it just seems that lego is ripping off canadian army builders to me if the battle pack contained a small catapult or wall so that it contained about the same amount of stuff that the other sets had it would be fair it seems stupid that you will only get minifigs from one set while you can get about the same amount of minifigs plus a bunch of other stuff from two other equally priced sets that’s why to me these battle packs are a rip off because of what they contain imho the battle packs seem to be only worth about 10 dollars mack i can understand your concern when pricing is concerned pricing is always a big issue for us to determine whether to buy or not to buy a certain set in a particular country pricing varies differently across different countries such as us europe canada australia and etc this is something very hard for us to decide on we cant be sure why tlc placed their pricing strategies this way well i think we should appericate what tlc is trying to do for us by not using price as the only factor to judge whether to buy this set or not at least i am sure there are many of us trying to request for battlepacks to muster armies for their mocs armies collection and etc different people have different judgements towards different sets and different themes i respect your opnion imo lets dont let price be the only determined factor to decide whether to purchase a particular set or not instead consider an array of factors that is offered however i do know that consumers like me and you are always affected by price iamded on may 26 2008 0140 pm said thanks for the review whitefang your additions look great i like your mace much better than the use of a small technic cog your looks much sturdier and that helmet looks really great on skellie soldiers i never thought to use that before very cool indeed iamded i am glad you enjoyed the review and my slight modifications that mace was a much looking weapon it looks much firm than the orignal look the design was inspired from dwarf mine and dwarf mine defender i would not want to have so many troll flags hanging around the nose cone helmet was to give the soliders a whole new look to me it retains the classic look yet it belongs to present theme suitable for my skeleton elite guards	negative
thanks for sharing these closeup images of this battlepack whitefang i actually had this set in my hand at legoland cal and could not decide if i wanted it im currently out of castlemode with my large indy jungle set up on the table and creating ghost train mocs that are starting to line up on the bookshelves once i buy the troll ship ill want to start collecting these great fig sets thanks again for sharing	neutral
sorry to be going a little off topic here but personally i have just bought 40 crowny battle packs for the only reason that i am running out of space to store the left over blocks about 500 of my crownies came from sets mentioned above on sale which would have been cheaper than the battle packs thanks for the review whitefang but i dont think i will be buy any skeleton battle packs that army is large enough	neutral
for those of you who buy so many of this and the other battle pack with crownies what do you do with all of them is this simply to create a largescale army or do you plan to build large castle scenes with all the figs id love to see some pictures on the share your castle army thread	neutral

great review for a great set man i loved the adventurers although the new indy sets are good they will never match up to johnny thunder most of all no stickers great review	positive
thanks for this great review voltio i never knew of this set till now and it really looks great i never paid much attention to those aztecincan style sets which i now regret i love the bright colours used here and all the great traps theres so many of them which is exactly what we can expect from an old incan temple like this one im surprised theres no catapult anyway the minifigs included are also great and am i right in guessing those bricks are printed that would be fantastic as they look amazing that boat hull is new to me too although i guess the fact that its mainly in belville sets explains that pretty well thanks again for the sweet review do you have any other jungle adventurers sets you plan to review peace	positive
ive always wanted this set ever since it came out in 99 i have never seen it close up unless you count driving over it in lego racers 2 so thanks for the pictures and the great review voltio on may 26 2008 0443 am said el conde you are too beautiful a woman to be wandering alone in the jungle miss storm please allow me to accompany you gail storm im with johnny and i have a cutlass el conde ill be on my way hehe	positive

great review i just barly missed the jungle series growing up with half a year of jungle and mainly orient expedition and dino island i like egypt more but this set despite the 4x4 palm tree is practically perfect i love the detail and vibrant colours gotta say ive got a thing for pippin reed myself by the way what does vhtf mean edited by sdpirate 28 may 2008  0106 am	positive
athos on may 28 2008 0747 pm said the printed pieces are the real gems of this set beyond them there isnt much to this set though the boat hull is nice the model itself isnt all that great the new akator temple is definately a superior model at least in piece count but those printed pieces are hard to resist steve i have to agree too few pieces for such a high price but amazing figs too and a nice baseplate despite a 4 palm tree you get more palm tree leaves for mocs plus i think a monkey and that sweet achu figure	negative
this set is awesome  gr8	positive
wow good review i used to love this old sets as i was greatly fascinated by inca and aztec cultures and the mayans technological marvels astounded me i was thrilled to death when lego released little aztec figures so of course i jsut had to buy some your narration with the sig fig was hilarious and the review was all around wonderful keep up the good work mate	positive

so i just piced up a new digital camera and i thought what better way to try it than doing a review of my newest set the new 7738 coast guard helicopter itsmy first review so go easy on me lets start off with the small stuff first the mini figs you get 4 figs total two helicopter pilots a diver and a civilan to rescue the torsos are nothing new on the pilot and diver same ones as in the last coast guard line but i like the colors alot better in this coast guard line than the previous generation the yellow and blue really work well together and the coloring on the badge looks great the civilian looks to be just a dock worker with an overall torso and a beenie the diver has nice vented helmet and a pair of flippers that suits his duty perfect next we have an absolute work of lego art the rescue raft the orange flaps can be moved back for easy entry to the raft as well as the white support beams with the caution tape i put support in perenthaces cause they really dont support anything just there to fill in the gaps at the top of the raft is a red locator beacon ccommunications antenna and a cargo loop for lifting the raft lets move on to the interior of the raft not much here but you can see the techinc beam that attaches to the top loopand to the floor of the raft so far this has proven to be very sturdy and has supported the full weight of the raft quite well you can also see the white box that holds the equipment of the raft here you can see the life saver tube heres a shot with our dock worker peaking out the side the raft says max ocupants 4 but with the storage box that might be a tight fit now lets move on to the helicopter in my opinion this is one of the best helicopters tlc has come out with to date i really felt they captured the look and proportions of a real coast guard helicopter it uses a lower hull and tail section of the new airliner and cargo airplane it really seems to work well with this application the engines have good detail using new cheese graders as vents as well as the new engine stacks that come in the new speed racer sets the rotors also appear to be new as well lets move on to the cockpit we have two seats for our pilots with a sticker sheet for intruments on a flat 4 wide plate theres also an antena being used as a flight stick another shot with our pilots at the helm now lets moveon to the high lihgt of this heavy lifting machine the med bay and lifting winch httpwwwbrickshelicopter020jpg here you can see the winch arm at rest along with the medical strechter the bad part is that the med strechter doesnt include the ussually included fold away wheels heres a shot with the winch arm extened ready for rescue in the second shot you can see the drum that the wire coils up in it coils up via a recently new power functions pull back motor to operate just pull out the winch cable hook on your load and presse this orange button on the side the bad part of the new power functions winch is that although its very smooth in its operation its not very strong it will only lift the raft a couple inches before it runs out of torque it also has a tendency to want to pull the crane arm backin while its lifting it doesnt matter if its a light load or heavy load the bay doors open on both sides for easy postioning of the figures and accses to the strechter here we have our diver looking over his rescuee nice and roomy if you dont mind a crane arm being in your way at 3999 and a peice count of 445 i felt this set was a great good considering what your getting the raft construction is very creative and is probbly the highlight of the set by itself the helicopter is probbly one of the best if not the best helicopter tlc has ever came out with if you can get over its size in a scale of one to five price peice count playability design overall 5 i would have given it a full 5 out of five but since the winch cant pull the raft all the way it didnt fell it right even with this minor flaw i still highly recomend this set	neutral
great reveiw this is definatly one of the cg sets im geting i cant wait to get my hands on this set	positive

great review i will get this but i will wait for a sale edited by vbbn 28 may 2008  1054 pm	positive
thats a very nice set im having my doubts about getting it though still the overall shape and size of the helicopter remind me of the reallife ch53 military cargo helicopter a very nice review youve got the photography down very well i feel perhaps a bit of nitpicking but at the end where you assign a rating if you do a rating with faces which is fine by me you may want to seperate the faces by a line otherwise it may become too crowded to the eye	neutral
this is a very good review thank you but i have some questions about the grey new parts in the life raft are they 1x1 like their counterparts with the clips or 1x2 and can they be held by a minifig by the handle if so these could be very useful for brickbuild weapons  tools also im looking forward to some orange eta 2 jedi interceptor mocs now who wants to be the first to make one btw which jedi has an orange eta 2	positive
im rather fond of helicopters and have built many different types this doesnt really remind me of any particular model other than perhaps an eh 101 merlin and even that resemblance is very superficial just for the record this is a sikorsky sea king and this is a sikorsky mh53 a derivation of the ch53 the only resemblance i see with the former is the colour scheme and with the latter the fact that its got a fat rearend sponsons and six blades it doesnt matter though because i really like it the colour scheme is great the shape is nice its got quite a bit of detail and i just have to get my hands on the cockpit window and those new rotor blades when i first saw the large aircraft pieces a few years ago i figured they were very much singleuse parts but the tail end doesnt look too bad pretty clever i like the raft too it really does look like the real deal that the helicopter cant lift it really isnt an issue because in real life they wouldnt lift the raft either theyd use the rescue hoist to lift the occupants of the raft into the helicopter one by one or perhaps in pairs imagine a storm with a helicopter hovering over tall waves with a big fat raft strung from a cable underneath it the raft would catch a lot of wind and flop around quite a bit causing it to loose all its occupants and also yanking the helicopter around possibly causing the pilot to loose control and crash bad idea cheers ralph edited by ralphs 30 may 2008  1109 pm	negative

nice review m8 shame that most of the pictures are blurry but nonetheless just wanted to say that out of all my lego sets this one 7888 is the best the tumbler is so cool once it is put together those four huge wheels at the back make it quite unique if you do not have this set i highly recomend it edited by 4olic 30 august 2009  0259 pm	positive

orion123 on aug 29 2009 1217 am said please dont reply to year old topics it will get the admins annoyed and thats not good i see that your new though so welcome to eurobricks but i recommend not doing it again reviving old topic is fine if the member has something valid or constructive to add into the discussion that has not expired in any forms in this case he is commenting on the review and adding his views into it such actions doesnt really get the staff annoyed on the other hand please take a look at this topic for better explaination thanks whitefang	neutral
thank you for clearing that up i felt that it was ok to review an old topic as stated rather than just go ahead and start a new one a shame that this set as all other batman sets have gone up so highly in value but still all things considering general after market lego price hikes it is still a wonderfull set even with its market value today that is if you can ignore the mrsp	positive
i too thought the jokers van was the pleasant surprise of this set the tumbler looks good yes until you see it in person its grossly oversized they should have made it closer to a regular car size like the movie because this one is a monster	neutral
great find and thanks for the review inertia on may 28 2008 1108 pm said undoubtably better than its newer counterpart the mt101 armored drilling unit care to explain why personally i think that aside from the colour scheme the new one is far better why suspension more enclosed cockpits buglike appearence i suppose its a matter of personal opinion though	neutral
great review of a great set i always figured the hoses were welding torches attached to jetpacks yeah as the whole thing had the vibe of a mobile repair center much like many of my favorite sets this one has a base of simple bricks and plates and then from that solid foundation the rest is built out to be decorative or have the action features this gives sets a very solid feel as demonstrated in this set the first snowspeeder and galaxy explorer the mm armored drilling unit has a more technic base giving it a less solid appearance and though i like the set that jet that luanches from the back is horrible partially because of the useless orange containment things the mega core has a nifty crane instead of a big useless jet tohst	positive
sinner on may 28 2008 0235 pm said care to explain why the mcm has a pure weight of parts that i find hard to quantify but love it is just so dense when you build it full of nice surprises no technique required and a wonderful stearing mechanism that i rank as more important than the suspension of the mars version this thing was meant to crush anyway who needs suspension i also like the way you never felt that the mtrons deserved a base after building this it was that good the colour scheme was perfect its space and i like it enough said great review btw god bless nathan naturally youre entitled to your inferior opinion	positive
norro on may 29 2008 0130 am said its space and i like it enough said indeed norro standing up for a space set	neutral
i love the design of the front canopy of this set but i always felt that they could have done more with the rest of the model this set is good candidate for customization though there is quite a bit on unused space inside especially in the middle section i want to try putting a technicstyle engine into mine at some point along with the necessary gearing i got my mcm brand new off ebay some years ago for a pretty good price but the box was very worn out and the big transneon panel which floats freely inside the box was a bit damaged as for the hosejetpack things i always assumed that they were either welding torches or flamethrowers take your pick quote kinda sad to think that with tlcs recent ban on magnets in their products first time ive heard of that what are they going to do for the train couplings	neutral
cp5670 on may 28 2008 0852 pm said first time ive heard of that what are they going to do for the train couplings new couplings are going to be available soon there is a thread with pictures of the new couplings here	neutral
joebot on may 28 2008 0731 pm said kinda sad to think that with tlcs recent ban on magnets in their products since when is that the new train couplings have magnets only with a special casing anyways mtron is one of the greatest space factions with mega core magnetiser as my favourite set of these guys even though i do not own it  the only thing that bothers me is the lack of reachable controls for the minifigs to drive their vehicles but iirc it is the same with a lot of other spacesets as well	positive
fluyt on may 28 2008 0156 pm said since when is that the new train couplings have magnets only with a special casing youre right i should have clarified  its the old loose magnets that apparently are being discontinued not all magnets altogether as you noted the new train couplings still have magnets but they appear to be permanently attached to a fairly large housing which i guess will prevent kids from eating them but the old mtron round magnet pieces are presumably discontinued	neutral
sinner on may 28 2008 1135 pm said care to explain why personally i think that aside from the colour scheme the new one is far better why suspension more enclosed cockpits buglike appearence i suppose its a matter of personal opinion though i just thought that the mt101 was very skeletal and couldnt really steer that well although i do like it also the mcm has a better design in my view as the wheels are closer together making it look a lot more tankish than the mt101 also space in the rear isnt wasted on having a shuttle cp5670 on may 29 2008 0252 am said as for the hosejetpack things i always assumed that they were either welding torches or flamethrowers take your pick hmm well they dont have much else to defend themselves with and i think in the uk the mcm was marketed as a mobile recovery center fluyt on may 29 2008 0356 am said anyways mtron is one of the greatest space factions with mega core magnetiser as my favourite set of these guys even though i do not own it  the only thing that bothers me is the lack of reachable controls for the minifigs to drive their vehicles but iirc it is the same with a lot of other spacesets as well yeah they could have used the normal levers instead of the pronged two piece things at the front of the cockpit but there is certainly a lot to mod joebot on may 29 2008 0425 am said but the old mtron round magnet pieces are presumably discontinued shoot guess that bl and ebay are the only sources now thanks for your input	neutral
thanks for the review maybe i can pick one off ebay	neutral
it looks like youre right about the old magnets i got a few off pab two months ago but they no longer have them i guess i should grab some while theyre still widely available on bricklink as they can be useful in a number of situations on a side note one interesting thing about this set is that it seemingly had two uscanada names mega core magnetizer and multi core magnetizer brickset lugnet and all the other sites ive seen call it mega but i have some north american catalogs from that time period that call it multi and the box also says multi on it i actually didnt know the mega name at all until many years after the mtron line	neutral

thanks for that fine review of a really classic and impressive mtron set inertia tohst on may 28 2008 0455 pm said the mm armored drilling unit has a more technic base giving it a less solid appearance  yeah it´s pretty sad some of these new sets just look very cool at the outside but appear to be hollow and blank at the inside especially with the annoying use of studless technic beams to mod these sets often means to change the whole inner frame leaving us with a bunch of imho not really very useful parts it´s not a very honorable marketing strategy to produce set designs that´re aimed to look impressive and cool on the box art but´re pretty useless in their inner structures of course i don´t want to offend some technic lovers and although i always was more the system kind of guy why can´t they just use some technic beams with studs at least i grew up with just imagine with pictures of alternative models on the box and i don´t think it´s that easy especially for younger kids to mod some of these terrific blownup sets like it once was with sets like this one here implosion off	positive
asuka on may 30 2008 0217 am said of course i don´t want to offend some technic lovers and although i always was more the system kind of guy why can´t they just use some technic beams with studs at least thats because of cost the older beams needed a four sided mold and the newer ones need only a two lego do seem to be using both types more as of late though asuka on may 30 2008 0217 am said i grew up with just imagine with pictures of alternative models on the box and i don´t think it´s that easy especially for younger kids to mod some of these terrific blownup sets like it once was with sets like this one here implosion off ive never heard an official word perhaps i should raise a topic but i think that they dont show them any more because it became a support nightmare what do i mean i bet tlg was tired of letters and calls saying timmy cant make this model shown on the box can you send instructions and the extra parts i know that for some recent models they were designed but not published how do i know this the creator said so	neutral

harley  mistah j i want to preface my review by admitting that i’m an unrepentant harley quinn fanboy i’ve been enamored with the character since she first appeared in batman the animated series back in the 90’s and i’ve since followed her misadventures through her introduction into the regular batman series during no man’s land into her own series and even on the shortlived and notsogood birds of prey tv show so please excuse any proharley bias so down to business the 267 piece set retails for 30 us 35 at toys r us and builds up very fast and easy it consists of batman’s bat cycle harley’s hammer truck and brand new batman and harley quinn minifigs there is also no lack of weapons in addition to the usual bag of bataccessories and guns the set also comes with a pair of gray revolvers batman in this set has the new “armor” torso print and the hips are the same color as the legs hinting that this is supposed to represent the movie style batsuits more so then the traditional comic book “underwear over tights” look harley quinn is a very cool looking minifig and i haven’t grinned so much at a new batman character figure since my first batman minifig a couple years ago the figure is very true to the character and the torso has been accented with a few shape lines to try and distinguish her as a female despite the boxy body harley’s jester cap is an interesting new piece it seems to me at least to be made of a slightly different grade of plastic then we’re used to it’s molded in red and painted with black and white and it comes packed in its own separate little baggie i expect that this piece may have cost lego a little more then usual to produce harley also has a buildable accessory a giant mallet sure she can’t stand up all that well unless it’s held in specific ways but it’s neat and most importantly it’s funny it’s especially fun for smacking the everloving crap out of other minifigs with the bat cycle is in bag number one and is a very fast build this isn’t some little japanese sport bike like nightwing’s cycle this monster is almost a car and seems to pack just the right amount of intimidation for the caped crusader to exploit thanks to the thick tires two in front one in back it stands up just fine on its own and rolls very well the huge exhaust pipes are a nice touch and give the thing a look of engine power the only real flaw is the inclusion of the flickfire missiles mounted on the sides but as with any lego model they can be easily left out without hurting the look of the vehicle the hammer truck is the bulk of this set and a lot more fun then it looks of the monster truck persuasion the vehicle is designed and built with a surprising level of solidity the axle mounts are particularly impressive the big wheels and tires just beg you to drive this thing right over the bat cycle or batman the megamallet gimmick is also a surprise not so much for its technical complexity there isn’t any really but for the fact that once you start turning the knob at the rear to swing the mallet back and forth it’s really a lot of fun there are some low points to the truck design again the flickfire missiles are tacked on and there’s a cargo cratebed set into the back for harley’s loot of jewels the crate would have looked a lot better molded in black in brown it breaks up the look of the truck a little speaking of which the look of the truck is very pleasing the red and black harley quinn color scheme works really well on the vehicle there are a few stickers here and unfortunately the diamond patterned ones are applied over multiple bricks the rest however are great not only does she have an “i love joker” bumper sticker but she has a joker playing card taped to her dash i guess serving as a picture of her beloved puddin’ there is also a sticker for activation of the hammer which boldly shouts hit me this is a fun set a neat new batman vehicle and a big truck with lots of playability the harley minifig is a musthave for any batfan and if you only get one of the batman sets this year i’d recommend this one the price versus piececount on this set is a little bit of a deterrent though this might not be the best set for collectors on a budget or people looking for something completely new and innovative but anyone buying this for a child can rest assured that the kid will get your money’s worth out of the set through its play value when added together and averaged out the pros and cons of this set combine to give it a score of out of 5 even if harley herself is a clean 6 out of 5	positive

yay another technic shooter whew i need a spare one in case the 14348 other ones that i have all happen to break seriously do lego set designers get some sort of bonus for incorporating catapults technic shooters and  or flickfire missiles anyway thanks for the review looks like a cute set	positive
thanks for the review i love this set i didnt think it was much at first either but i really love it another cheaper robin and penguin is great and those nifty mini penguins are awesome the spare pieces are even nice i love robins little scuba jet those green engines are very nice and i love it compactness penguins sub is even better at first i was annoyed at getting two subs but now i realise it means i can have a fleet of them ill be sure to mod over those cannons though but the details are very slick thanks again batbrick away	positive
thanks for the great review brickadier general the sub looks very nice and i like the idea of a raising periscope did the batcave sub have that feature and the details on the sub look very nice the inclusion of the penguin robin and two of those great brickbuilt penguins really confirms that ill be getting this considering that i didnt purchase the batcave however i am rather dissapointed that this set is so similar to the vehicles of penguin and robinin repectively in the batcave set i feel that it only really caters to those who havnt bought the set and i wouldve much appreciated different vehicles overall a very nice set perhaps the best of the 2008 wave despite its lack of originality thank you very much for the review bg	positive

set 8635  agents  mobile command center pieces 1154 price us8999 those dedicated agents theyve fought chainsawarmed villains battled radiocontrolled cyborg crocs chased pallets of badlystored golden loot and wrestled killer sharks with vicious toothy grins finally theyve caught the notorious dr inferno and imprisoned him in their cavernous mobile command center but dr inferno wont go down without a fight can the agents stop the evil dr disco inferno fleeing will spy clops laser gun burn through the door in time or will dr inferno simply use the lovely agent traces enormous ponytail as an escape ladder to freedom more importantly will there be a riot in the streets of lego city as afols go apopletic at the thought of a 12 wide truck roaring through their ordered town layouts stay tuned part 1 the box instructions parts as the largest of the agents sets so far the box is easily the biggest trainee agents examine the following three pics and see if you notice anything odd box front box back box middle spot it thats right the printed cardboard which has supposed to be the bottom half of the fold out middle section is on the back slicing the ultralarge set image which would form the foldout in half  the way the cardboard is printed as one piece before its folded i think this would be very hard to do accidentally so suspect a major stuffup somewhere along the production line i bought this set off bricklink so would be very interested if anyone in the states who has seen these boxes actually on the shelves can tell me if this is common or rare basically i want to know if i should be annoyed that the bricklink seller didnt list this in the set description or are they all like this the instructions come in 4 booklets the parts list comes in at 5 pages which is a lot even at halfsize pages  large images of the parts inventory are in this folderwhen moderated for anyone interested heres also some cute agentstype artwork at the end of one of the books instructions show piece callouts and are divided into sections according to numbered bags as youd expect for a set with 1100 parts this baby comes with a lot of bags its a treasure trove of dark blue as well as the obvious large slopes and wall panels which make up the body and the roof there is a wealth of smaller navy blue pieces as well  small 1x1 bricks 2x2 bricks 1x1 plates 2x2 tiles heaps of 2x plates some slopes 22x cheese pieces basically anyone wanting a lot of dark blue should think about this set the roof panels alone for example could provide a dark blue sea for a modernised pirate moc 2 dsss dreaded sticker sheets quelle surprise  stickers the grey parts of the stickers here are metallic silver ink which is a nice touch actually as sticker sheets go theyre not too bad fairly subtle for the most part and the navy blue actually matches the bricks themselves however after looking at the sticker sheets i thought i was missing something what about the pieces used for the projection screens showing dr inferno and the sharks  why werent they on the sticker sheets there must be another one frantically i checked and rechecked the box and flipped through all the instruction manuals to find the elusive 3rd sheet where was it ten minutes later i noticed something which had honestly never occured to me  there were actual printed pieces in this set so obvious and yet so unthinkable its horrifying how years and years of exoforce and speed racer set releases can mentally condition peoples thought processes tut tut lego what have you reduced us to here they are folks  actual printed pieces yes i do believe this news deserves the caps i also noticed this nifty modification of the usual 2x3 cupboard  you can now fit drawers in it very clever this may have been around in belville sets for years for all i know but its new to me the drawers slide in and out very well and the top one sits on slight indentations in the middle of the cupboard part 2 the figs our trusty agents  charge chase trace and fuse high powered agents dont have time for names of more than one syllable  thats why the bad guys always lose  chase and fuse have the mutt hair in black and dark orange the lovely agent trace has an exquisite new hairpiece in dark brown perfect for rapunzel themed mocs as you can see her ponytail is loooong makes it hard to sit down the poor girl i feel sorry for all these female figs with such intricate hairstyles that they can never relax in an ordinary lego chair however at least she has two breasts unlike the recent harley quinn fig compensation indeed seriously though its great that theres a separate torso print for the female character and this attention to detail is typical of the set as a whole three of the agents have reversable heads  nice touch with the headsets and i like the id cards on their pants obviously the agents security system is based on some kind of crotch measuring device this would make sense considering the conspicuous bulges in the pants of dr infernos men see the other agents set reviews the villains  spy clops dr inferno gold tooth dr infernos hair in all its glory this is a great piece although the orange colouring is a little rough on the front its so 3d it deserves a back and side view and indeed eb thread all of its own as mentioned elsewhere this is different plastic to the normal minifig hair but it doesnt quite feel as soft as the exoforce hair it doesnt fall off as much anyway the figs get 1010 from me awesome hairpieces in great colours for the agents and a sleek navy blue neon green uniform the villains faces are great and they are all very distinctive the attention to detail is outstanding and its great to see a lego inhouse theme with characters as memorable and cool as figs from the licensed themes  part 3 the build the build is divided into three stages  the small vehicles the front of the truck and the massive command center section a small vehicles first up all the small vehicles we have a small flyer 2 buggies jet ski and a speed boat  all in glorious navy blue with little bits of silver detailing top view these vehicles are all simple small and welldesigned probably the weakest is the flyer only because the cockpit looks a little large in fact the small flyer is probably the weakest element of 8365 overall which tells you how good the set itself is in various threads here this set has been heavily criticised for being way out of proportion theres a reason for that as we shall come to however the existence of these small sets should appease some people with the new coast guard sets for example all of these save the flyer wouldnt look out of place on a city beach with a little modding heres an example  agents beach party spongebob couldnt help but crash the villains only have one small vehicle but theyve been wellserved in the smaller sets and this one is a unique and clever design i love the triangular shape and the simple but clever technique of making the arch slopes meet up around the propellers its sort of insectile in black and orange and looks very different from the usual assortment of helicopters etc b truck front this thing is a beast seriously look at it its chunky and mean looking you dont want to mess with this baby the build is really nice like a lot of star wars vehicles its all based on technic beams pinned together unlike a lot of mars mission sets underneath isnt all technic beams with some plates slapped on like a facade the majority is a lot of plates and bricks which all fit together solidly you can see from the detailing of cheese grater slopes and silver pieces on the front how effort has been made to give this vehicle a distinct feel different to other lego sets sure the silver slope mirrors might be a bit too much for some but this baby is all about attitude you can imagine it roaring down the road en route to dr infernos diabolical lair after all these sets are agents sets  nobody said they were secret agents c  command center  whole assembly heres a view of the whole thing assembled  inside and cool details to follow at the end its kind of hard to show here as it is extreeeeemely long this is indeed a big set the build for the trailer part of the command center is fun and very satisfying yes there are large pieces but there is also a huge amount of detail it is also solid as a rock i remember being annoyed building the big ferrari truck a few years ago  everytime you looked at it an 8 x 16 plate fell off the mobile command center is solid  even with the hinged roof and special features it is not delicate at all kudos to the designers again as it is mainly a brick build rather than a technic one i also like how the command center part connects to the cabin  its not a special piece at all just a technic axle going through two circle plates but it works and its solid please note ive been selective about which stickers ive applied during the build top view the rear heres an example of why i like the build a the designers have enough sense to put a ladder so a minifig can climb up to the interior when the command center is open b notice that although the ladder clips at the top there is an extra clip there in the middle purely to hold it in place so it doesnt flap around and holds firm i dont know if most designers would even think to put a ladder there let alone go the extra mile and put a mechanism to hold it in place pure class oh and notice the greebly detail stuff to the right there too the other side this is probably the other weak part of the build  the bricky gaps at the top where the hinge to open the roof sits its a little gappy but the set is so big you dont really notice d and now for the fun stuff  inside and neat details ok so weve built the thing its big its blue the top of the trailer itself would make a good warehouse moc for a harbour layout but what about inside is it any good what about all those small vehicles from the start of the review where do they go well im glad you asked because the solution is superb the small flyer folds slightly and slides into place here lift off the roof and youre away the large buggy and the speedboat go under here the jetski slides out of the rear here attached to its own little platform and the small buggy goes inside the main cabin theres even a crane so you can lift it down so now we know why this set is so large to fit everything in its amazing that this functionality doesnt affect the aesthetics of the set as a whole but we still havent finished on the details the front section has a very easytoswingopen roof section and missiles theres also a command section underneath the bit where the flyer lifts out and now for the interior i have to say i really like this space not only is it packed with great stuff theres also enough room for minifigs to move around i hate bases where the figs only have about 2 studs to actually stand and walk aquabase invasion is a nice set for example but the actual functional space inside the base is teensy claustrophobia you know within a week theyd be fighting to toss each other out of the airlock no such problems for these suave agents who have plenty of legroom and the ability to launch missiles from their ceiling the whole of the interior zooming in moving from left to right first off the medicine cabinet looks like someones been leaving secret mission dossiers lying around the projector area for mission briefings dr inferno recently changed his hair colour from purple to orange it seems why are all these minifigs so obsessed with their hair the projector folds down when the trailer is open push the button and the light glows on now dr infernos hair is orange again this is one of my favourite parts of the set it works a charm the batteries for these lightbricks can also be replaced  instructions are in the manual agent charge considers sharkfin soup for dinner did i mention these projection panels are printed the detail is very fine too the tool section laptops sit in the middle compartment you get some flippers yellow scuba tank and various implements im so impressed that the helmet is pearl silver with a different coloured visor too  theres so much variation in the parts in this set you dont get the sense the designers are using the same thing over and over to save money it all feels luxe and topoftheline just like the command center itself two laptops  yay the aforementioned rooftop missiles the dr inferno cage nasty electric shocks bzzt you can see my reviewing skills are burning out now  sentences truncated another example of detail  nowhere else in the set is a 1x1 transgreen tile used  they could have used a 1x1 trans green cheese wedge piece as there are others in the set but they didnt how does dr i get out flick that lever on the right hand exterior and the door pops open spy clops the loyal minion awaits his master on the other side and there we have it take a bow guys theres a lot of spare parts a suspicious amount of dark blue small slopes but i checked the instructions and didnt see anything missing i have to say i do like the new policy since speed racer i think of including these small slopes as extras part 4 overall rating if youve made it this far youve got more stamina than dr infernos army of cyborg animals themselves as i said earlier this set has drawn criticism for the size of the truck however large vehicles do exist  i grew up in a wheat farming area and as a kid the size of the lorries that thundered past carrying grain was probably intimidating to me as this monstrous espionage machine is to the good citizens of lego city on top of that it does contain a plethora of 4wide vehicles inside  criticism of this set on the basis of size to me also seems misguided as this is basically a playset  and it is a very good one to boot as you can probably tell i love it to pieces and wouldnt hesitate to recommend it to anyone whether for parts or for play value check out the parts list in this folderwhen moderated and you can see just how many excellent pieces it contains a lightup brick a flood of navy blue metallic silver bricks  were spoiled 8635 is also an enjoyable build with fantastic figs and topoftheline detailing in a year when ive found city a bit disappointing after the run of great sets in 20062007 the agents line has been one of the surprise hits for me and i cant wait to see what the designers come up with next edited by sveltecorps 02 june 2008  1246 am	positive

you know i like many had doubts about these sets when they were first mentioned but ive decided i want the whole line now this set is the créme de la créme just beautifully stunning that is a great review sveltecorps you have gone into fantastic detail and description of all the elements really it is this review that has persuaded me to buy this set i blame you the minifigs are great the vehicles are better and the truck and interior is awesome the few minor draw backs are far outweighed by the attention to detail and the many unique and cool elements used in this set and printed pieces that is even better great job you have obviously put a tremendous effort in making this review and i for one definitely appreciate it i am looking forward to these sets being available in new zealand	positive
must get two thanks so much this review has truly shown this set as a brilliant one even those who hate this theme must admit it is greatly designed i love the way the mini vehicles fit i love the light brick i love the truck front i love the trailer i love the missions bay i love holding cell i love everything edit and i second dragonators response when i say thankyou sveltecorps for this grand review you have convinced me utterly to get this batbrick away edited by batbrick 31 may 2008  1049 am	positive
wow like others have said i was unsure about these when i first heard about them but then looked at the first leaked pics and thought they actually look pretty neat now i have seen all the reviews i have to have all these sets at first i was thinking they would be great as parts packs but the more reviews i see the less i want to use them as part packs and just keep them as built or buy 2 so i can do both  cant wait till they hit the shelves in the uk thanks for the review	positive
wow great review of what seems to be a great set i love that ponytail this looks to be a must have set it probably wont stay together for long though thanks very much i fixed the header for you thats two you owe me the other is for making me think that this set was in australia 	positive
thanks for another wonderful review sveltecorps a very fine set indeed i absolutely love the way all of the vehicles fit into the command centre very clever the projector is really cool it looks very nice its great to see these light and sound bricks in the agents sets all of the little nooks and crannies in the centre are great too i really love the amount of detail featured mixed with all of the playability of this set the minifigs  as usual  are brilliant the uniforms look fantastic dr inferno looks especially great i love his white suit with hints of orange and who can forget his hair im really tempted to buy this beast now though im not sure my wallet will forgive me for it i suppose ill have to cut back on indy and castle multiples for now thanks for the truly great review sveltecorps nice work	positive
wow this set looks so amazing amazing genius davinci art i say youve done an excellent job reviewing and really this is the review ive been waiting for so cool so classy i love the mission briefing feature to think that lego could go so high as to put something ingenious like that in there too bad lego figures dont have fingers to make shadow shows eh genius the jet lauching feature is pretty slick and they even put a control center in there too thats beast loving that the bottomi dont see how that big buggy can get out or in there but awesome too the back of the truck could use more detailing i think but the jail popopen feature is pretty cool as is the speed boat storage rack cabin its great that roof opening feature is a great part of this set also i think you can have multiple figures up theremaybe you can mod it to put a bed in there it certainly looks big enough inferno plane wow that think is smooth baby i love how the wings contain rotors inside of them thats awesome detail right there that is a sweet ship thingy so slick the rest of the command center is pretty awesome too we get a 4x4 wheeler and a crane and lots of room wow just wow great review great set you are well worthy of your custom title im gonna go buy this for only 90 woot	positive
great review thanks thats one hell of a set i think lego has reached a certain kind of peak with the design cleverness and fun of this one im so relieved that agents seems to be shaping up to be even better then i thought it was going to beand i thought it was going to be cool to begin with agent charge not only does he look like dash justice but he has the name of one of dashs alpha team squadmates i call shenanigans	positive
woah i got to have this set i shall buy it asap thanks for the review expertly done	positive
splendid review i love everything on this set no question bout it somehow i knew i should have saved up and buy that when come to trubut the sight of turbocar chase and jetpack pursuit was to tempting to pass up	positive
wonderful review  one of the best ive ever seen on this site man we thought this might be the weakest set in the line but it turns out it may be the strongest everything about this set  from the color scheme to all the details to the minifigures to the piece selection  is just wonderful i think this set has finally confirmed it agents is everything alpha team wasnt and is how they should have done a spy theme from the start kudos to tlc for finally getting it right  and i sure hope theres a second year	positive
wow excellent review thanks that set sure looks fantastic its incredible how much features theyve managed to pack in while keeping it roomy im really impressed by the quality of the design tlc is sure getting back on track with great design ow 2008 is going to be expensive	positive

i first i thought the whole agents line would not be very good but boy have i changed my mind this set looks amazing as do all of the other sets in the line i really like how the small vehicles all fit into the truck i dont like it when sets come with smaller vehicles and dont have anywhere to store them so they just float on the side that light projector is fantastic i cant believe they are actually printed this is definitly on my tobuy list thanks for the amazing review	positive
wonder full job but now my wallet aches in misery	positive
im not that into mars mission but this set reminds me of the jungle cutter	positive
great review i just got 7644 mx81 hypersonic operations aircraft its a great ship i started to review it but then it started to rain i was outside so the review is coming tommorow technicolor stickers very pretty	positive
another great review im looking forward to getting this set sometime soon i wasnt aware of the power function aspect similar i suppose to the old technic sets which had an additional instructions for those with the relevant motors i knew those dinos i got at clearance would come in useful nice to see the recent bulldozer treads appearing in black grey seemed a slightly unusual colour choice	positive
these new sets are just totally offthewall radical d its the little details like the scoops on the blades and the alternate alien energy source lego didnt even have to include those but they did that show lego are really getting back into their groove this year the ability to add power functions is just so cool as well im going to pickup the creator monster dino set for the electronics when the sales hit as svelte has suggested a very entertaining review just like the agents mobile command center one d	positive
this set looks 10 times sweeter with the power functions too bad ill have to buy some extra	negative
nice review the power functions is a nice idea and i ownder if it will appear in any other new sets regarless if i get this i decided to just to get what ever looks good in the shops from now on  im defianltey picking up some of the white visors off bricklink	neutral
i was going to buy this set anyway but now im even more excited d my favorite part of this set is the bay that holds the little cart vehicles	positive
asuka on jun 4 2008 0926 am said did i miss something or is there really only one and probably improved shooting device no you didnt miss anything theres only one and its the less obtrusive new piece the range is pretty poor though 	neutral
so is there some way to get all those motor bits at once or do you have to buy them on their own i dont think ive ever seen them in a store here	neutral
iron moose on jun 4 2008 1128 am said so is there some way to get all those motor bits at once or do you have to buy them on their own i dont think ive ever seen them in a store here only from sh so far or if you buy sets which they come in all the ones you need apart from one additional small motor are available in the 4958 monster dino set which i got half price i ordered the extra from sh at the same time i bought the set  but only because i had already looked at the instructions and knew what i needed if people have the ferris wheel set as well i think the small motor comes in that	neutral
this should be reported to the news 	neutral
well i guess its nice that theyre making the story background a little more clear with that jelly plugged into the power cable hmmh both jellies and crystals can be used as power sources think theres a connection both of them are transparent and greenish maybe jellies hatch from crystals like eggs or need them as food or something important like that yay for evil humans	positive
thanks for the great review sveltecorps i bought some of the mm last year and ended up selling them off for sw this new set has got me interested in mm again partly due to your cool review one question though did you get this set in aust shops or sh just wondering if i should be looking for it yet edit sorry just saw your other post saying it was ordered from sh cheers isc edited by i scream clone 04 june 2008  0808 am	positive
sveltecorps on jun 3 2008 1209 pm said the only thing is just dont torture that poor jelly i smell another dont hurt the dragonsjellies or something group nice reveiw i dont realy like the mm sets we want more starjusticespace skulls but this one looks ok i guess suprised they dont say that it has power functions on the box	positive
really nice review i love those sweet looking power functions on it if only the orange bits could be replaced then you could have a futuristic and motorized jungle cutter anyway the alien bit was disturbing but the overlytall new commanders look very very cool all in all a great set but i wont be able to buy it because in a few days sh will become 600 richer and my wallet will writhe around in pain on the floor	positive

i appreciate your review mr mandalorian but why the negativity id try to find more positives about the set instead of kinda criticizing it after each picture i personally think it looks freakin awesome the size is very impresive and i nearly fell of my chair when i saw the first pics earlier this year its quite unlike anything ive ever seen from lego edited by radiant7 04 june 2008  0827 am	positive
thanks for the review mr mandalorian this is an er interesting set lots of frontal firepower very big too and i like the idea of those two little craft that attach on the sides sort of like little escape pod things anywho not one of the things on my to buy list but i do like that radioactive sticker that could come in use looking forward to seeing your modifications too peace	positive
thanks for the great and very detailed review i love the new holostickers im still not sold on this set though im not sure why i think its the big wing piece and the tootechnicy build from looking at the instructions the platform seems kind of out of place and for the size of the set the functionality doesnt seem as good as it could be it reminds me of 7699 armored drilling unit  looks impressive but doesnt seem to do that much i do think mars mission has improved this year though bar none this is the weakest of the new mm sets i think	negative
mr mandalorian on jun 4 2008 0119 am said and then we have this thing what is it defense laser communications array satellite tv that certainly feels like an homage to the deep freeze defender which itself feels like an homage to the galaxy commander is there some way to centre one of the cockpit units without massive de and re construction	neutral
thanks for the review mr mandalorian the alien craft is a bit small in my opinion could have done with being just a little bit larger the main craft however despite its few minor flaws looks very good while space isn’t my normal theme i’m certainly being tempted this year	positive
iron moose on jun 4 2008 0234 am said that certainly feels like an homage to the deep freeze defender which itself feels like an homage to the galaxy commander thats the observation i had when i saw the first pictures of this set online a few months ago i am a proud owner of the 6973 deep freeze defender and 6980 galaxy commander so im looking forward to see how the 7644 stacks up next to them there is a definite lineage here and these sets clearly demonstrate the evolution of lego set design over the years the mx81 may not have the most playability out of all the new mm sets although it has alot from what i can tell but its hard to beat the look of a large sleek space cruiser sitting on your shelf or dresser at least for myself anyhow this is my first post to the forum and hope my welcome wont wear out here anytime soon edited by spacefan 04 june 2008  0643 pm	positive
thanks for the review i have to concede this does appear to be the weakest set of the summer mm lineup ive noticed a trend that the larger sets have plenty of parts potential but when assembled the model is not more than the sum of the parts eagle base certainly didnt seem worth the asking price at least this is one large model on a positive note the lame aero tubes darts and martian carrier pods have disappeared dont get me wrong i love mm and most of the lineup is great this one just seems to fall a little short of the bar	neutral
i dont understand why theres so much negativity this is actually my favorite of the new mm sets the finished look is very sleek and not very gappy at all the deployable landing pad is great and itll make it easy to put on a shelf without taking too much room lots of greebles although i will concede that its just begging to be modded still though im definitely buying this one  it has a really great look to it	positive
sinner on jun 4 2008 0344 am said having a name like that is a good start my screen name largely sums up my interest in lego but is not soley limited to space thanks for the warm welcome	neutral
two more questions 1  how stable is the entire craft when balanced on the platform is there a chance that it will just collapse 2  what are the total wingspan height and depth measurements of the model	neutral

hm needs more firepower	negative
great review mr boba fett i really like this set a lot some of the features may not be as good as i hoped they would but overall this looks to be a really nice set im so happy that the giant spacecrafts are finally back quote ive noticed a trend that the larger sets have plenty of parts potential but when assembled the model is not more than the sum of the parts eagle base certainly didnt seem worth the asking price at least this is one large model on a positive note the lame aero tubes darts and martian carrier pods have disappeared hm actually i dont see the comparison eagle base looked terible to me right from the start so it was no suprise when it ended up being the weakest kit in the first year this big ship on the other hand looked great as soon as i saw it and still looks good	positive
iron moose on jun 4 2008 0215 pm said do tell im being curious not confrontational  well first and foremost like many other people im no fan of those dreaded unprinted minifig torsos and stickers but also the cost to piece ratio of the set it just seems too expensive for everything that you get such as too many small parts and a lighter than usual piece count for the price though if it had included printed minifigs and other elements i maybe would of been able to swallow its 100 usd cost a little easier but star justice is still lego space in the most classic sense thats available today and i will probably pony it up just because anyway i hope were not breaking forum protocol by not discussing the 7644 review of the original poster or that particular set in general	neutral
thanks for the review i actually quite like this i cant afford it so im not getting too attached to it but in its own way its great its certainly reminiscent of space sets of the past as others have said and the dropdown ramp section is just really cool as an idea you understand sure the lab is a little crap but at least the effort was made sort of  the sheer fact that its so big though really makes me like this theres just something appealing about large spaceships not capital ships just big space ships with lots of guns spacefan on jun 4 2008 1034 pm said anyway i hope were not breaking forum protocol by not discussing the 7644 review of the original poster or that particular set in general hey its no worse than batbrick and i no really it isnt even in the same league	positive
thank you for that nice review mr mandalorian wow somehow it´s almost like classic space´s back indeed it´s a great star ship it looks stream lined original and impressive and even the huge plane wing part looks rather cool and smooth on it it´s equipped at least with some kind of engines on top of the wings and although they´re made with only two a little juniorized parts it´s better than nothing there´s a lab or some sort of engine room with enough space inside to allow one or two mfs to play scotty yeah the two cockpits´re nicely detailed with a cool use of these orange 1x1 round plates and to detach one or all two of them reminds a lot of the playability of the good old space sets it seems even like it´s easy to attach them to some kind of cloud city twinpod car thanks these hinged wings looks like some solid fun to me of course the cockpits aren´t airtight and even this reminds unfortunately of the post blue grey and trans yellow era of cs anyway there´s no real fun without some moding i guess another great advantage of the set´s that it´s not overpacked with shooting things one technic shooter cool in grey and only one trans orange prison pod too well i can surely live with that especially since it´s nicely asymmetrical the drill rover´s very charming a little like a rebuilt oldsmobile convertibe stranded on mars sweet and that platform feature´s plain nifty and well done too very playable and useable for a lot of things hmm recently i complained a lot about the dense use of studless technic beams for the inner structure of vehicles like these exoforce tanks par exemple which makes moding in an economical way pretty frustrating but the beams here´re used in a very proper way it should be fairly easy to mod let´s say the back of that lab section up to perhaps even the cockpits to create a larger airtight area that could be boarded from the platform just to fit this certain spacers need for um realism there´re many more nice details too like that satelite tv thingy and that cylinder with trans blue 2x2 dish for the knob or these cylinders with cones on that handle and that alien craft´s pretty nice and detailed as well like i said before i really feel like classic space´s back	positive

nice review just one little point since there is no sound transmission through space but there is an atmosphere on mars through which this this thing supposedly flies hypersonic airplane makes far more sense than hypersonic spacecraft 	positive
sorry mr mandalorian i guess i was just getting a bit defensive because when this set first appeared here there were literally 2 pages of people just bagging out the new mm sets but then the thread took a turn and people started to warm to them much like the agents i do agree that it definitely needs some mocing but with that work i think it has the potential to be a really amazing set in terms of what you could cram into it the lab is a little disappointing ive always wanted an enclosed cabin space in a vehicle this size because then all the little space guys can have a true meeting place the dropdown landing ramp is my favourite part it has lots of potential uses maybe its even possible to integrate pneumatics d	positive
i didnt see this one coming probably because that huge white beard got in the way was this shadows impersonates aluvar week or something ok this wasnt the worst thing ive ever seen we can try a real one in the future the not too near but maybe not too far future i guess where is that a map of anyway	negative

hello all eurobricks members i will be presenting my first review on one of the harry potters set firstly i must emphasize that i am not a very big harry potter fan or owned many harry potter sets for this review i will be highlighting what is the beauty of this small little set and the reasons to own multiple sets of it comments and critics are strongly welcomed this set is featured in the harry potter movie prisoner of azkaban this set is orignally released in 2004 align with the harry potters movie this was actually one of the movie scene where buckbeak the griffin is appeared in the movie the group of students are supposed to be having up close and personal with him however draco decided to disturb our lovely buckbeak enough of this movie synopsis i am sure fans of harry potter will know this better box art featured minifigcreature background scene the scene is a simple garden which had a very good mixture of spare parts for your mocs building on its own there is nothing outstanding about this set except for the griffin you can buy multiple sets for the griffin alone and for draco minifig well you dont need lots of draco but for castle lovers black cap are exceptionally useful at least from my view now i will point out the following why this sets is so great for other reasons hidden cover note that this is the only mechanism which you can find in this set it looks rather simple but quite useful there are some little things hide in it too greens foilage and brown parts needless to say much it offer 3 foilage a green plant 3 brown slopes 2 ideal bricks and 1x1 brown brick for building a tree great for jungle building forest building and etc i am sure there are many builders will look out for these interesting parts it comes with a wizard book owl 2 printed tiles with a spider and stone prints on it the far right seriously i dont find any good use for it can any eb members enlighten me on that gray thing on the right grey parts it comes with a good 10 x 4 green plate useful for adding as a platform some more grey slopes for your mocs there you have it draco encounter with buckbeak comparing with deep forest ambush as you may remembered recently there was an impulse set competition one of my entries which is under the history theme the deep forest ambush was firstly inspired by this set and made an improvement out of it look at the improved tree compared with the orignal summary review playability 410 not much to play with except swooshing around the griffin design 510 too simple and its defintely not related with the movie scene parts 1010 great for parts explained by the review a great deal of green and brown parts price 910 an inexpensive set based on the 2004 pricing overall 710 a must have for all harry potter fans and collectors whom needs a great use of green and brown parts hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine more pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated let the potter magic begans edited by whitefang 09 june 2008  0245 pm	neutral

ohhh great idea to review the old potter sets especially the line from prisoner of azkaban i was in my dark ages then luckily i was able to catch up on the missed figs with one internet order this draco is the best tlc has made if you ask me the new one also doubling for belloq and guards in the indy line doesnt look quite as hautain as this one buckbeak looks cool looks like his neckhead can be moved right rather similar to lego horses well designed the orange brick doesnt have a pumpkin face on it right unlike the one from philosophers stone in the set with the troll im looking forward to more reviews by you sir whitefang good work	positive

i bought about 5 or 6 of these sets when they were on sale in mid 2006 i still have a few of them laying around unopened i think i payed like under 5 for each and thats a great deal for all the variety of neat parts you get with this set	positive
nice review i like the treemaking pieces the most of this not very expensive set the buckbeak fig is very nice and can bow his head like the horses i was annoyed to get another draco without some other not made figs pansy parkinson for example about the dark bley feathers in the second version of hogwarts there were several of these feathers put in little 1x1 cones like it was a feather to write with it i bought 2 sets of these and when they were for sale i just bought  6 more of it only annoying that i had then even a bigger army of dracos	neutral
i see a lot of good reviews on this site but this one is superb good job tom	neutral
lookin good so far though i must say its doc ock not dok ock the catapult is well ridiculous but the boat is very spiffy and the buoy is a nice addition i actually like the stickers on the window pieces perfect for this building and great for postapoc scenes black lifesaver rings are a nice addition tooanyway hurry up dragonator and batbrick and daisy i want to see the rest of the review iamded away	positive
i got this set in 2006 in a byrnes world of wonder toy shop i dont remember how much but it was a deal the box was all battered but it had everything good review batbrick	neutral
thanks for the review even if it is a number of years late i picked this up whn it came out and thought it was a rather cool set besides the catapult plenty of cool pieces and the baseplate has found a use in the batcave although i think my dad managed to spill some beer on it at one point that was awful to clean off batbrick on jun 13 2008 1044 am said and brainbox is too busy complaining that this goes against all marvel continuity i wasnt expecting that there i was casually scrolling down when i stumbled onto a picture of me	positive
great review batbrick i was curious as to what the interior of the building looked like i still think that there should have been a few random chains or something lying around as they may add to the abandoned feeling that the ware house had though i have to admit that i really like the roof dock and minifigs as some of them make good average civilians that are somewhat hard to come by in todays sets  great comic as well it seemed to add a lot to your review hope you can review another spider man set soon  btw as adam mentioned i believe you owe me a bar of soap for reading your review  edited by mack 14 june 2008  1259 am	neutral

hi everyone please note that this review was done back in 2006 so do forgive me if you happened to notice any dated comments product 6205 vwing theme star wars no of pieces 118 release date feburary 2006 rrp sgd2990usd990 availability lego shophome target toys r us us  europe bricksworld sg legocom said rule the spaceways the sleek vwing fighter can adapt to any situation position the wings and flaps in attack mode to protect palpatines shuttle from enemies or position the wings in flight mode to survey the area for intruders either way the vwing is ready to strike for the republic includes clone pilot and r4 droid position wings in attack or flight mode sorry to all for the delay since this was supposed to be done 3 days ago anyway to get on with it quite a minimal amount of baggies for this set as noticed and the best thing is no sticker sheet yippee bounce the completed vwing though not really a complaint it would be nice if the entire astromech body was provided instead of only the head dome p of course then it wouldnt be movieaccurate since the q7 series astromech is integrated with the starfighter lol hes definitely wellpainted for a simple minifig since even the back is painted too i have to assumed this is the same minifig provided for 7259 arc170 starfighter too since i dont have that set anyway this minifig is much more accurate for this vwing since his suit is rated against vacuum while those in the arc170 arent  p one thing thats lacking is the instruments panel in the cockpit its totally nonexistent here i wonder what went wrong during the design stage personally this is the second most anticipated set for 2006 the first being the tie interceptor for me one thing is that theres no known release of the vwing starfighter by hasbro nor the other wellknown brands the other thing is that being a star wars vehicle collector i would really loved to see a replica toy of the vwing and the vwing by the lego group does not disappoint its nearly movieaccurate except for the cockpit transparisteel cover which could used some paint like the xwings also theres a permanent landing gear that quite neat since it allows you to land the craft on uniform surfaces the sfoils on the other hand can be quite a pain to pose into flight position very difficult for the sfoils to remain symmetrical during play the swooshable or play factor of this product is quite good just check out the pics for yourself d crackle general skywalker we have incoming to conclude the vwing starfighter would make a much better companion to the eta2 actis interceptor jedi starfighter than the arc170 coz the arc170 seems more like a longrange bomber to me than a snubfighter p and a final pic to show it at rest comments for 2008 just an updated pic to show my latest display on the clone wars hmm off the record i do understand that sometimes reviews by most tend to a certain set of guidelines like naming the set and showing the boxed and out of boxed pics and of course the grading portion regarding my review i prefer not to grade any of the lego sets at all as far as possible because to each hisher own my reasons to put up a review is not to belittle the efforts of tlg in coming out with these products nor to help them market them but to show my appreciation and enjoyment of these products i hope noone is offended by this and would like to apologise for any misunderstanding that this may caused for those who do not understand the above paragraph care not for it and play on like me	positive
thanks for the detailed review valentin it had good picture quality and a nice little comic near the end although this is a slightly older set it still was a good one i remmeber that i bought two of them to build up a small airforce for the republic and if i see another one i may buy it for use in the starwars comic game keep up the good work 	positive
thanks for another great review i remember getting a few vwings cheaper because the boxes had been crushed on their way to the store not an allthat set but still a fine parts pack with a decent design kimt	positive
nice review i would have snapped this up back in 2006 if i was not in my dark ages	positive
great review and what are the stands that you used they look much better than the white bricks that i use	neutral
nice review thanks valentin and a cool collection of prequel fighter you have there want	positive
valentin great review nice to see you here in eurobricks this fighter looks real neat by the way bricksworld pricetag is still visible in your boxart	positive
nice review but i have to correct something for you valentin on jun 15 2008 0953 am said one thing is that theres no known release of the vwing starfighter by hasbro nor the other wellknown brands the other thing is that being a star wars vehicle collector i would really loved to see a replica toy of the vwing this quote is wrong  heres a link to the hasbro vwing photo archive over on rebelscumcom	neutral

heres the 3rd of the whole batch of complete reviews done back in 2006 hope you guys enjoy them so far product 6206 tie interceptor theme star wars no of pieces 212 release date february 2006 rrp sgd3990usd1990 availability lego shophome target toys r us us  europe bricksworld sg legocom said challenge the rebels blasting out of star wars episode vi return of the jedi the tie interceptor is the fastest fighter in the imperial fleet open the cockpit canopy and fold down the instrument panel to put the tie pilot inside and recreate your favorite classic star wars battles includes tie fighter pilot cockpit opens and instrument panel folds down it does seem to have more pieces than the average tie fighter but this is actually cheaper than the 7263 tie fighter of course theres no lightup feature in this set sweat yesh finally a tie interceptor this is probably the most anticipated for all set for all lego tie collectors worldwide since the fighter bomber advanced and even the expanded universe droid fighter had been released by the lego group this set is near movieaccurate since the bottom part of it aint p the cockpit and pylons uses the same design as that of the tie advanced piloted by darth vader except for one minor change that is the aft interior of the cockpit is strengthen this time and this is indeed good news since the older models had a problem of hard hinge and loose brick connection theres no landing gear for this set but it doesnt require it anyway this tie interceptor balances perfectly on its wings standard instruments panel and of course standard imperial pilot the swooshable or play factor of this set is definitely very high just take a look d camera view from own craft camera view from tieadvanced combat simulation of endors battle from the archives no bomber since i started late in recollecting p to conclude for a typical lego fan this set is a 6040 60 due to its good design and for a typical star wars fan this is a mustget the only flaw for this set is the same flaw for any lego set in sg the price doh commentcurrent in 2008 being a starwars fan no being a typical toy collector space is definitely a premium so much so that i turned to lego starwars to sate my appetite for more starwars products when i already have no more display space for the next few nonlego pictures they are the crown of my starfighter collection in 118 scale so just view them for fun eh and no i havent had the chance nor the time to do up a scene of my lego starfighters blowing up spectacularly since the pieces would be very hard to put back hmm then again isnt that what lego is about doh	positive

ahhh bag building that takes me back i suspect that if i didnt do my bag building topic my eb life would have turned out very differently for the negative nancies i suggest you try it i bought a set just so i could and i found it fun not fun enough to do it again though thanks for the interesting review	neutral
adiksalego on jun 17 2008 1002 am said now now dont judge people who do this there have been bigger sets that were done in the bag to each his own  you make it sound like i did something deeply socially deviating like being an adult playing with lego but back on topic open the bags if they were meant to be opened why did lego close them in the first place bag building is not for everybody some might become very frustrated with it and let their anger out on the set by lining it up on a mini golf course	neutral
nice review but i think bag building is a boring way to build	neutral
i bought a tiny turbos seta nono for me after i saw this bag building its actually pretty fun i built it faster than i would if i had opened the bags	neutral
seeming as there were no reviews of this set in the index i have uploaded mine from jabbas hutt  here is my review for lego set 10178 motorized walking atat because i live in the uk i got this set with 6 free duracell batteries which was great its just twice as expensive as the us heres the basic set that is from the instructions this is the cockpit but please note after i took this photo i realised it was slightly built wrong heres one of the feet in proportion to a minifig to give you a general size this is luke skywalker swinging on a wire trying to destroy the atat i really wish lego didnt make so many lukes because i want differnt minifigs it would also be nice for a thermal detonator piece underneath the atat you can see the shaft that moves the back legs the motor and squeezed in on the righ t the massive battery box a load of cogs that move the legs these are the included figures snowtrooper general maximilian veers atat driverpilot or whatever you want to call him and luke all whithout there wepons please note veers should have a dark stone snowtroooper torso with 4 red and blue badge things not 3 these are the figures with weapons i gave them and the included ones snowtrooper has new style blaster veers has standard light grey pistol like the ones from the old adventure sets atat driver has old style blaster which i call heavy blaster and luke has shiny handle blue light sabre  the shiny blue light sabre was included with the set which is a bonus because i really dont like the grey ones httpwwwbrickshelsc00521jpgjpg this is the switch which is attached to the battery box on either side of the atat underneath the lift up side panels you push the forward to walk forward and backward to walk backwards simple eh  a front veiw with the the panels open here are the drivers controls which are simply a cotrol panel and 2 exoforce robot hands which are joystick things seen in the film if you look closley the almost useless carry handle this is the weird back piece looking down the atat from the back where you can see the the battery box and switch troops decending from ropes and cables and vader leading the assult for this i hadnt got any more imps so i used clones pilots i now have a whole load more snowtroopers solo and chewie sabotaging more troops to squash rebel scum huzahh a very bad picture of everyone packed up inside the size incomparison to its predecessor overall i would give this set 910 because it should come with more snowtroopers or it could be and endor version with loads of strormies and scout troopers aswell as this you can really sit any one down because of the battery box but i stilll find space to put all the shown figures on this review in the interior as you can see on the above image the chains and ropes are hanging down a bit tjis set is now limited to 5 per customer in the uk and now no longer comes with free batteries the walking on this is a bit wonky and dosent really walk like they do in the film as it moves two legs at a time i am currently attaching a motor to the head to make it move independently	negative
kimt on jun 19 2008 0342 pm said great review indexing it as i write this how come you think the ctt is the atats predecessor do you mean the motorized atat or atats in general i think this is a great set and i am very fond of mine its one of the few sw sets of mine that is on parade at all times most are packed away in the attic kimt btw its not alone the older version of the atat is keeping it company the body looks exactly like it	neutral
nice review i echo the sentiment that more snowies would have been better	negative
vadersson on jun 19 2008 0157 pm said as far as i know the atat was a invention by general veers himself benny i doubt that the atat was used in the clone wars	neutral
vader had a red pole because i think it makes him look bigger and in the films i doubt it is but i think his saber might be bigger	neutral
i never got the set it looked way to skinny i came close to buying it for the figs but then decided not to if you compared this one to the later one there is a big difference this one just didnt seem proporshined with the legs and its body	negative
this is one of those sets that you just have to have i mean a motorised atat is a dream set for original trilogy fans and has an awesome set of minifigures	positive

thanks for the review kimt  it comes at a confusing time you can take off the top disk and lift it like the millennium falcon from the top now i actually dont like this set that much it takes about 5 hours and 15 minutes to build if you do it in one go but the repeating sections makes this built the most tedious i have experienced it has way too many holes from which you can see the colorful skeleton and is overpriced compared to the older 10030 isd i remember thinking it was too expensive when it was 50 off at sh even the snowspeeder was kewler to less than half the price	negative
hmmm ive still got this set and i must say i think you did a good job of reviewing it but overall i hate the set probably the worst ucs set so far apart from the naboo fighter but that hardly even counts as ucs from my experience unless you really really want it and have nothing better to spent your  on in that case go for it but in my case it was a very repetitive build and final model was quite well bland not must variety to it if you know what i meanfor the price i would really reccomend the ucs star destroyer because thats a much better story	negative
great review kimt  i like this set even if i don´t own it because it looks simple fantastic to display i just have one question the mini executor can be moved around the death star ii or its attached to that place thanks for the review 	positive
good job kimt it´s a really nice set it will be interesting to see the size of ds2 ucs compared with the new death star playset keep up the great regulator job you are doing morten	positive

great concise review kimt though its not for me you held my interest all the way through thanks isc	positive
i think its a very weird and boring ucs set but what a lot of grey plates you could build something much better out of them but it would be fairly flat it looks very fragile though  my ucs atst is edited by shoc 25 june 2008  1028 am	negative
i also dont feel this is a very good set but is that old grey in which case it would be a nice part pack dr brick	negative
thanks for the review kimt honestly like the others have said i dont find any appeal in ucs sets especially this one its just a big incomplete grey ball	negative
the build was a bit boring and i suppose a big grey ball isnt all that interesting but since the death star ii in the movie is a big grey ball too i dont see the problem i didnt think it was particularly fragile i dont care about minifigs or playability either a few plusses in my opinion it looked pretty damn impressive sitting in my lego room and the construction is really clever all in all i actually liked this one but perhaps i have a different expectation of sets than most of you sets are mainly parts packs and would you look at the quantity of grey plate in this thing its new grey btw i paid half price for it at shophome uk which is still a lot more than half price from the us and i didnt regret it for a second cheers ralph	negative
kimt on jun 25 2008 0834 am said i dont agree that the isd is better  imho theyre exactly them same  big and grey this is a question of personal liking  which is the coolest ds or isd not comparative here are some advantages that makes isd win for me  a lot more fun to build with less repetitions  it is easier to build alternate models from it how many alternate models of the ds2 have you seen  the bricks are more varied  you get magnets  it is a larger set if you look at the size	positive

dang so much negativity on a such spectacular set this baby provides an amazing backdrop to any lego inspired star wars diorama and lets face it lego tends to be a rectangular brick and somehow we now have a sphere guys its a ucs it accurately depicts the on screen icon and put plain and simple is a wonderful sculptural piece of work in its own right i agree with kimt in that the removal of the laser and super star destroyer gives it more authenticity but to call it a gray golf ball or ignore its inherent accuracy is simply to miss the point it proved to be the best build to share with someone be it family or friend due to its repeated sections and impressive finish its a clever build and to criticize it for lack of playability or i suspect for many its absence of minifigs is just absurd and possibly why lego has not released a proper ucs in nearly two years i reckon many out there would love a ucs tyderium imperial walker or slave 1 with a spectacular piece count be it minifig scale or just darn impressive in its own right sadly for those who love these sculptural masterpieces were stuck with simple toys with play features and cute minifigs clever in their own right but lacking the clout and purity of the old ucs line lets hope some diversity of product is just around the corner else 10179 was the last of the truly brave financial gambles of the star wars line	positive
i decided to reread this review because i just got this set today i dont really have a concern over the design or repeating build process because owning this set was never an option for me as i collect ucs sets but i am surprised to see an almost total lack of positive posts i really hope that i enjoy this build	neutral
i bricklinked it too back in the day it was an interesting build  just thought building the unfinished hemisphere was kind of tedious	negative
ive just ordered the bits for this from bricklink im awaiting the final order now so im interested in these comments i can see that since ill be building it with the kids ill have to plan in plenty of breaks and do lots of parallel building to keep us all from getting bored	positive

hey thanks for all the feedback guys ill try to do the sith infiltrator this weekend	neutral
yesterday i buy this setand im waiting for a pack this review is very helpful jimbutcher on jun 27 2008 0834 pm said ill try to do the sith infiltrator this weekend i wait	neutral
jameseh on jun 28 2008 0824 pm said does the sliding cockpit come off easily my friends brothers breaks everytime you touch it but he may have built it wrong it put me off the set im very sad to say that sometimes it does but thats only if you hold it from the top and bottom with your fingers and thumb respectivly but if you hold it in your palm or from the sides it wont break emphasis on sometimes but dont try to mess around with it by removing its pieces or adding new one or modding it in any way because the sliding mechanism wont agree with the mods and break but this hardly takes away from anyone liking this set because imo its perfect just how it is	negative
nice work jim for your first review i must admit the set didnt really appeal to me at first but your review has definitely shown off the cool functions built in to this ship well done cheers isc	positive
nice review i bought a couple of these for parts the only thing i dont like about the ship itself not the lego version it does fine is why is the grand droid general flying around in in a small fighter like this i prefer the battlefront interpretation witch uses it as a bomber anyway great review york	neutral
great review i would get the set but im saving for the clone wars sets	positive
great set great review i have it too and i am very glad to own it it will probably be the cheapest and best way to get a grievous fig for a while even though it doesnt come with a cape  you guys know that you can use the new robotskeleton arms from the castle sets to make him hold his lightsabers horizontically right i always have him with two of each kind of arm	positive
hello all eurobricks members i will be doing the second wave of the 2008 impulse set series which had released recently i bought this set earlier ago and will like to share this comprehensive review with everyone of you name troll warrior theme lego system  castle year 2008 pieces 19 minifigs 1 an image of a 5618 troll warrior let the march begin the mighty brave troll warrior carrying a dangerous cart equipped with a flick fire missile marching into the lands of the crown kingdom crown knights must be ready for this new troll addition from what i see this set has a very minimum piece count since its an impulse set there is no unique parts found in this set however this set has a couple of useful accessories such as 2 spears and 2 wooden wheels and a grey mouse running around this set is another alternative for castle army builders to buy multiple sets to build a massive troll armies in addition the flick missile really works use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it the missile will fly well it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature base of the cart different angles there is one thing i dislike about this set the wooden wheels are too big and it is the same as the ones in the crossbow attack i prefer the smaller wheels that exist in old castle sets that produced smaller cart since this cart size is similar to the old cart size the old wizards cart is a very good example of the proposed wheel bits and pieces closeup on the warrior and the mouse summary review playability 5510 the playability feature is not fanastic design 6510 design is adequate if the wheels is much smaller and the flicking thing disappear the score will be much higher price 810 an inexpensive set to get a troll warrior and a mouse overall 610 to conclude this set is good only for army builders a new range of millitary vehicle to be added thats all hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0129 pm	positive
thanks for the review bearing in mind that the whole point of this set is to get a cheap troll warrior i actually quite like it the cart isnt brilliant but for 13 pieces its not that bad the troll fig is great as always and i guess the rats are always nice to get not so much in real life though the sets that contain the trolls have a fairly solid number each i mean tower raid has three but nevertheless i think i may have to pick up a few of these whitefang on jul 2 2008 0249 pm said in addition the flick missile really works use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it the missile will fly well it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature the trolls hands are going to get quite sore then arent they	positive
trooperdavinfelth on jul 2 2008 0315 pm said its all good buti know you expected a but  its a rat or maybe a very large mouse	neutral
its a good review but you forgot another thing the troll needs a shiled like they used to in the 2007 castle line the sets always had shields for the minifigs and it could be better if it was 300 instead of 350 but yes it is a good impulse great army builder	positive
very good nice to see how its all played out nice review	positive
guys thanks for your kind comments i am glad to know that you have enjoyed viewing this review trooperdavinfelth on jul 2 2008 1115 pm said its a rat i thought by calling it as a mouse it will be a little much friendly unlike calling it a rat brainbox on jul 2 2008 1120 pm said thanks for the review bearing in mind that the whole point of this set is to get a cheap troll warrior i actually quite like it the cart isnt brilliant but for 13 pieces its not that bad the troll fig is great as always and i guess the rats are always nice to get not so much in real life though the sets that contain the trolls have a fairly solid number each i mean tower raid has three but nevertheless i think i may have to pick up a few of these norro on jul 3 2008 0610 am said a more affordable troll warrior for those of us avoiding the large sets me is always nice thanks for the review i must agreed with the both of you that this is a much easier way to acquire these troll warriors at a much affordable price i am glad these trolls are available in impulse sets now will there will be a dwarf impulse set in the future i supposed that will be much interesting glman on jul 3 2008 1215 am said its a good review but you forgot another thing the troll needs a shiled like they used to in the 2007 castle line the sets always had shields for the minifigs and it could be better if it was 300 instead of 350 but yes it is a good impulse great army builder if this impulse set includes a troll shield my rating will defintely go higher this is a troll army builder set with minimum feature and limited weapons range if the troll comes with an armor or a shield i will think this set is worth it troll armor is hard to get by as it appeared only in troll warship and tower raid edited by whitefang 03 july 2008  0306 am	positive
grrr you beat me to it i got two of these in the mail today and was so eager to do a review of it thanks for saving me the work edited by wilhelm screamer 03 july 2008  0330 am	positive
ah sweet thanks for the review whitefang i hope this set shows up in nz soon i cant wait to get my hands on it troll warrior on peace	positive
quote in addition the flick missile really works use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it the missile will fly well it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature something to toughen up kids fingers thanks for the review cant wait til i get this comes to oz	positive
guys thanks for your kind comments it seemed most of us here love this impulse set mainly to build army guess i am a little bit too critic in my review i was expecting a little bit more nevertheless i intend to buy multiple sets of this and build on my orc armies and split them into different battalions this is indeed one of the better ways to acquire orcs wilhelm screamer on jul 3 2008 1130 am said i got two of these in the mail today and was so eager to do a review of it thanks for saving me the work opps i was eager to do a review as well when i bought these sets i hope you enjoyed reading this comprehensive review nikola bathory on jul 3 2008 0408 pm said hey your review is great as usual as for the set itself  well its an impulse set after all  small and cheap nothing special well the rat is special hehe for me the rat is the most interesting in the set cause i dont have a rat i dont have a troll warrior either but im not very interested give the new theme a chance i feel tlg have made an effort to revive certain elements that are present in past castle themes although it is not as good as the past but it is certainly better than the recent castle themes shoc on jul 4 2008 0100 am said why is mouse friendlier than rat well mouse sounded more friendly because it can associate with tom and jerry but calling it a rat equal calling it a pest its just a matter of putting it in different terms thats all edit instead of posting another post to explain why i used mouse i will write it here tom and jerry is reflected as a cartoon children associate jerry as a mouse since its supposed to be heartwarming and make us laugh in real life there are many different pets we raised one of the possible pets we considered is a mouse mouse are supposed to be shy and friendly creatures that live in harmony while rats lived in packs hunt food in the dark and is widely regarded as a pest in this review i am trying to illustrate rat and associate it with mouse by presenting it in a much friendly approach there is no right or wrong answer its just making use of different words to represent how i feel towards a particular thing edited by whitefang 04 july 2008  0808 am	positive
whitefang on jul 4 2008 0543 pm said well mouse sounded more friendly because it can associate with tom and jerry but calling it a rat equal calling it a pest its just a matter of putting it in different terms thats all the thing i dont get is how jerry is friendly	neutral
this is a nice way of building up orc armies but i do wish it was designed like the knight impulse set there you have a minifig enough weapons and armor for two figs and a weapons rack made out of basic pieces add a generic fig from your collection and you have two knights and the pieces from the rack can be easily used in mocs the pieces that make up the siege weapon in the orc impulse are not as easy to use in other creations id rather have seen a orcish weapons rack different from the knights rack but like it using basic elements with a second helmet another weapon the orc armor and a shield to put on it still although not as good as the knight impulse its a nice little set whitefang on jul 4 2008 0343 am said tom and jerry is reflected as a cartoon children associate jerry as a mouse since its supposed to be heartwarming and make us laugh in real life there are many different pets we raised one of the possible pets we considered is a mouse mouse are supposed to be shy and friendly creatures that live in harmony while rats lived in packs hunt food in the dark and is widely regarded as a pest where i come from people keep both as pets however if either are found in the house uninvited they are considered pests and if you look at the chinese zodiac rats are very well thought of and are symbols of prosperity the brick mouse rat	positive
thank you for the review the set is nice i didnt need the flickfire missiles and would have rather a orctrol shield instead but i think i will pick one up	positive
hello all eurobricks members i will be doing a continuation of my impulse set reviews i was pretty excited when i laid my hands on these new impulse sets yesterday hope to give most of you a good insight for this set name street cleaner theme lego system  town  city year 2008 pieces 22 minifigs 1 an image of a 5620 street cleaner let the cleaning begin the street cleaner has a job to do it is to clean the rubbish on the streets after a new year countdown it seemed the cleaning agency have a new equipment to use its not as big as the previous street sweeper machine the cleaner will need to operate the equipment manually by pushing it look at the mess after sorting out look at the pieces offered its not a very complicated set since its an impulse set there are some pretty useful parts lying around such as the broom spade however i was quite surprised when i could not find the lid of the rubbish bin i cant used this rubbish bin to place it around my town without a lid on top of it i believed it is not a norm by not including the lid look at that bin well that rubbish bin seem to be containing his equipment in it instead of the rubbish the cleaners face looks pretty sad i think he wants to have a change of job front view i love that blue brush very much quite fun to play with especially pushing the rubbish aside thats why a spade is there to help him to dig out the litter and the broom to brush it away ok now i know why his face looks so sad where is that street sweeper machine summary review playability 6510 not bad to play with design 7510 the design is relatively interesting with the use of the technic part to be its foundation price 810 an inexpensive set to get another cleaner and some neat accessories overall 710 not a bad set after all pretty average but still quite good to buy if your towns required more cleaners hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelfwhen moderated edited by whitefang 04 july 2008  0344 pm	positive
thanks for the review  not a bad price of course its impulse for a fig a little cleaner thing and two accesories the brush fig and spade i dont have yet so i might just pick this up	positive
looking at this is making me want to build one of the favourite sets of my childhood 6649 street sweeper might do that today actually cheap good pieces despite the lack of a bin lid thats just inviting disaster isnt it nice fig and one of those blue brushes which ive always loved but never managed to use thanks whitefang	positive
thank you for the nice review this set looks good i have too many of the blue sweepthings but the fig is nice and i didnt have this face so i will pick up one some day	positive
hello all eurobricks members i will be doing a continuation of my impulse set reviews this will be the third review at a go hope everyone of you will find this review useful in a way name coast guard kayak theme lego system  town  city year 2008 pieces 21 minifigs 1 an image of a 5621 coast guard kayak roll roll roll your boat it seemed the coast guard has a kayak of his own roaming in the sea making sure that swimmers will be safe in the beach now i am illustrating him as a life guard instead this set is simply wonderful among the 4 new impulse sets coast guard kayak is the best looking set in my opnion the kayak design is very simple but looks realistic  furthermore if you dont need it to be a coast guard kind of stuff use it as a leisure water spot instead down in the marina i will think any lego citizen will love to have some water spot in their busy life so come down here and wind down with this new sport bits and pieces kayak and the bouy the bouy is very useful to position it at the coast of your water to highlight the boundaries in the sea and warning incoming ships or vessels oh i did not make it tilted purposely there is a white round base which allow it to tilt on both ends useful parts these parts are useful to add on in your city somehow when i see that red cone i can use it as a police stop to inspect vehicles on the road or form a barricade with it the bouy base shape is unique too i like it very much it is great to attached it by the side of the boat as a life bouy the coast guards life vest and helmet are very useful for water activites the life vest was produced in past sets and now it resurfaced again i am glad these vests made their way back a look of him without the life vest summary review playability 7510 fun to play with especially the bouy when you see it moving up and down design 8510 design is simple but straight to the point especially the kayak design price 810 an inexpensive set to get more coast guards and more kayaks overall 8510 a very good set to have in your lego town the kayak is simply so lovely to me hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated	positive

hello all eurobricks members this will be my last impulse set review for the second wave hope everyone of you will find my reviews useful and helpful in your purchase name crystal hawk theme lego system  mars mission year 2008 pieces 26 minifigs 1 an image of a 5619 crystal hawk alpha 3 in sector 5 reporting to base alpha 3 crystal hawk reporting for duty sir may i present mars mission latest scout craft code named crystal hawk this spacecraft looks very sleek and cool with its usual white and orange color combination i am not a fan of mars mission but these white minifigs simply attracted me for it in fact i only owned its impulse sets and none of its main sets nevertheless this set has the swoosh factor i was swooshing around in my home last night well i am not swooshing it like kimt though am i seeing double haha the answer is no it has double sided face i combined the pictures to illustrate the two facial expressions bits and pieces different angles love the way how the wings bend upwards and downwards the only thing i find it a little bit wierd for spacecraft normally i thought joystick is the typical navigation controls for a spacecraft instead of a steering wheel i am not complaining about a steering wheel in a spacecraft to me its quite an uncommon sight anyway the white steering wheel is an useful part for making vehicles mocs summary review playability 810 fun to play with when you bend the wings up and down design 8510 design is simple but creates a sleek and cool look price 810 an inexpensive set to get more scout craft and mars mission minifigs overall 8510 a very good set to have for any mars mission fans and for collectors like me whom cant afford all mars mission sets this set is a very great alternative hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated	positive
one of the better impulse sets imo	positive
glad you enjoyed viewing the review xenologer on jul 3 2008 0112 pm said the hawk it seems to me lacks a cockpit theres not even a seat to keep the pilot from falling off perhaps it theyd redesigned it to be a backpack jetpack sort of unit using similar pieces itd at least make some sense these are some of the improvements which we can do it ourselves to mod it better i think these are great suggestions otherwise we can add in a white air tank to be included onto the minifig xenologer on jul 3 2008 0112 pm said based on the other mm impluses can we assume this goes for 35usd at that price it seems to me that the astro fighter at 5usd was already a superior impluse set guess id buy one on clearance for the minifig in sh crystal hawk is priced at usd 350 i bought mine at a much expensive price when you compared it with usd i never bought the astro fighter i am supposed that it comes with a little bit more parts and an additional alien fig with it	neutral
nice review good little set probable one of the only impusle sets i will be geting untillif they make agents theme impulse sets and i like the neat doublesided face edited by darthlegois619 03 july 2008  1035 am	positive
thanks for the great review now i just have to have that set	positive
thank you for the nice review this set has a very classic space feeling so i dont care about the lack of cockpit a nice little set with a nice minifig	positive
i really like the look of this impulse set even though i sold off my mm sets to buy sw i kept my astro fighter and this impulse set really appealed from the moment i laid eyes on it i feel the swooshability and cool extras like the double sided face far outweigh the lack of cockpit thanks for another great review whitefang	positive
i like this one aswell it has a couple of parts i need for an moc train locomotive and i dont have any of those space guys yet and a double faced guy is always a winner in my book	positive
once again another outstanding review by sveltecorps i am not a very big fan of agents but this theme defintely offer plenty of useful parts this volcano base is simply fanastic for parts usage especially in doing up landscaping with mountains by making use of the brown burps i must admit that the exterior looks real cool but the interior looks rather empty these orange slopes certainly make a great illustration of the larva which gives the agents a hard time to infiltrate within its compound to save his comrade i am quite sure this set will defintely attracts lots of kids to coax their parents to buy it since the bright colors will defintely caught their attention with all those hitech sleek weaponary i am sure this is the next big thing for kids out there well i am not sure if this theme works for me as well but this set defintely works well for landscaping project	positive
thanks for another great review i definitely like this set sure the interior might be a bit bare but i think that the outside of the base with all of the great lava and rocks more than makes up for it it is a bit weird that on the one side there is nothing on the inside but thats easy to fix anyone know when this will be out in the us thanks again for the fantastic review	positive
droool must buy to sveltecorps how on this wonderful planet did you get that i thought it was coming in september	positive
excellent review sc thanks for sharing the figs are awesome i really like the female villain  an excellent face i also like the agent uniforms the laser gun is perfect it has that peter sellerspink panther dooms day device look that i envision when i think of laser destruction the volcano has some neat features as well like the trans redorange lava it is a bit heavy on stickers though as are many new setsthemes but overall i think this set will really appeal to the kids  a great review of a neat set	positive
awsome review dude im proably getting this though the main downfall is there is hardly an inside	neutral
thanks for the stepbystep set looks great mmmmm clawdette	positive
ah great review i have always wanted this set since it came out but with the price i think i will get the mobile command center first this will need serious interior mods like i did with my dino attack chopperpics soon	neutral
sveltecorps on jul 7 2008 1103 pm said thats the best pic i have at the moment apologies re blurriness cool he looks a lot meaner and more damagedterminatorsy that his brother	neutral
thanks for the review sveltecorps i have yet to purchase an agent set but i think that will change shortly i am not a big fan of the stickers but the huge laser gun the unique minifig design and beaucoup transorange pieces have me sold	positive
i know the word secret base but whats this the base is hardly secret with a massive laser gun and wide screen sticking out it looks good lots and lots of orange woo	positive
im still keeping my money payments until july 26th so i wont be able to buy this set unless i get some money prize or something however i appreciate the review and hopefully i will get this set sometime in the near future i just love these new cybernetic arms	positive
this will be a wonderful set for a mustafar moc	positive
cool set i got that firearm thing straight away lol i might get a few of these sets and combine into mustafar great review	positive
i didnt exactly know where this belongs the best but i think it fits the best in here cause its somewhat space related i got this nifty little set yesterday from an auction ebay new and sealed i think the rock raiders theme was a great theme and i wish they would have continues id back then but anyway lets see what we got here set nr 4910 name hover scout number of minifigs 1 number of pieces 39 release year 1999 first a picture of the little box  instructions a general overview of the set and here we have the lovely  miss jet yes the minifigures had odfficial names in this theme  the little vehicle and finally the crystal analysis station i like that very much even if its simple but it does a good job and the amount of equipment also is cool thats it little set little review but big fun i can recommend that to everybody its great for the parts and the minifig is lovely gets a 1010 from me	positive
when i got this set my first rock raiders set i thought it was the best set i ever had maybe that was a little bit of an overstatement but i like a lot the pieces mainly and this is a nice little review are92 rowar on jul 10 2008 0822 pm said omg iamdeds torso  spoiler oh my god spoiler what would be more appropriate is commenting on iamdeds torso saying omg jets torso	positive
woo rock raiders only the best theme ever thats right possibly even better than castle 07 cheers for the review metalandi hopefully you can inspire others to see the greatness of rock raiders too i love how everything was so simple yet so effective it was loads of fun to play with and build the alternate models when i was younger as well and probably still is  do you plan of doing any other reviews or do you have any other sets rapid rider is another great small one adding a bit of diversity with a waterbased vehicle and you get the bandit minifig or you could get the rock raiders set and get all of our spelunking friends dont make me name them all  or if you want a slightly bigger set loader dozer could be the way to go axles a pretty cool minifig too and you get a rock monster sorry if the last comments were detracting from your review dont think i didnt like it becuase it was great i really hope you can do more oh and yes my torso does come from a female fig peace	positive
unfortunately i dont have any other sets yet i think i got one of the bigger vehicles back in the time but i dont have any sets from this time anymore but i certainly plan to get the loader dozer andor the chrome crusher soon i found an ebay auction where somebody is selling the sets 4940 4950 and 4970 new  sealed hopefully i have luck with that its only at 4 euros right now but its still running 6 days httpcgiebaydewtaitih005	neutral

sinner on jul 20 2008 0456 pm said i consider rock raiders space too i also consider many of the diver themes space as well me too the rock raiders are very scifi with the best lego space storyline the aquazonies would be inner space rather than outer space though but they look very spacey edited by shoc 20 july 2008  0745 pm	neutral
7663 sith infiltrator year 2007 number of pieces 310 number of minifigs 1 price 2999 usd brickset hello everyone and welcome to my second review on eurobricks the sith infiltrator lets start with a pic of the box shall we as you can see its a limited edition set meaning the fig and set could be worth a lot in the future this set takes about 20 minuets for the seasoned builder an overview of the infiltrator also know as the scimitar as seen in the picture this ship is very sleek with very few studs on top snot studs not on top basically its the cockpit with two wings with two fins on each wing attached to the hull heres a side view of the scimitar very cool looking it lands on two feet in the front while the cockpit rests on the ground rear view the back the outer cockpit is beautiful a printed piece on the back no dreaded sticker sheet dss and a large printed disc on top heres a look at the middle there is a flickfire missile transred cone attach to technic pin on the inner wing a transred lightsaber blade in the back of the hull and a transred lightsaber blade in between the fins on either side all of those lightsaber blades may come in handy hey look the fins open from the wings the fins open due to double hinges on each fin unfortunately you have to hold the ship up in order for the bottom fins to open now lets have a look inside the cockpit to open you lift the back printed part which is attached to the printed disc on top which is attached to a hinge it opens pretty smoothly but is somewhat loose so sometimes it closes on its own also the disc isnt secured well enough to the door and often breaks off even with the smallest movement to it inside there is an elevated control panel and two sliding pieces near the floor this ship also comes with a small speeder bike its very cleverly built and is a really neat addition see that clear disc on the bottom it fits perfectly into the sliding pieces in the cockpit hmm whats this a hidden compartment now this was a very cool idea by tlg a secret compartment found by taking off the top slope of the hull contains darth mauls weapons and tools which include a chrome lightsaber hilt a pair of electrobinouculars and three probe droids a closeup of a probe droid just a plain black minifig head with a black lever on top finally the fig darth maul in the flesh plastic a good fig altogether with a black hood and lightsaber blades taken from the ship he did come with a crisp new black cape packaged in a small white cardboard box but i am currently using it for another fig note that this is a limited edition fig so stock up a comparison pic of the two mauls the 2007 version is on the left and the 1999 version on the right note a few key differences between the two the new one has smaller red tattoos and a smoother torso also the new one has bigger eyes and a more cartoony look maul on the speeder bike of course he fits perfectly in the cockpit wile sitting on the bike and he can reach the controls well thats about it here is the final verdict build 810 easy and fun breaks every once in a while playability 710 this set has many features but is very fragile between the cockpit and hull and between the two cockpit pieces swooshability 110 too fragile to fly around plus the flick fire missiles fall out minifigs 910 a great fig with a chrome hilt and a double sided blade a little cartoony design 710 very clever techniques very sleek but very fragile price 810 fair enough could be a few dollars cheaper overall score 6510 a very sleek ship with clever building and play techniques but very very fragile and shouldnt be picked up off of the shelf too often and with that my review is over but all of yours are not comments and thoughts very welcome edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0259 am indexed	neutral

jimbutcher on jul 10 2008 0944 pm said a hidden compartment now this was a very cool idea by tlg a secret compartment found by taking off the top slope of the hull youre supposed to slide the front of the hull off rather than lift the top piece off	neutral
ill be honest  i dont like this ship at all its one of my least favourite ships in the pt and i have to yet buy either one of those sets i also found it funny that this set was meant to be a walmart exclusive yet never appeared on the shelves at my walmart anyhow thanks for the review	negative
led zeppelin on jul 10 2008 0446 pm said youre supposed to slide the front of the hull off rather than lift the top piece off yeah i was looking at the construction booklet and it reminded me of that i forgot about it but that makes it more fragile	neutral
trudop561 on jul 11 2008 0630 am said i got this set last year and i think you made a mistake when you have remove a piece to access the probe droids and equipment you just have to slide the entire main part and i have a question is this equipped with the new flickfire missiles that dont fall off yes i realized the first part  as for the flickfire missiles the do fall off very easily	neutral
thank you for the nice review i like the design although i didnt want to buy it the new little speeder is very nice but maybe a little to small darth mauls eyes are looking a bit more dangerous now	neutral
a very neatly designed sith infiltrator though i think it lacks the size of the older version a fine ship but not what i would call a sith infiltrator it should be bigger thanks for another fine sw review kimt	negative
im not real fond of slimeface he looks too much like the jokerbombs i was hoping for something newer the slime printing is a nice touch though steve	negative
he does look a bit different thoughalthough it hasnt come out well on the photos there is some green printed slimey bits on his head aswell he honestly is amazing	positive
great review i love that slime face 	neutral
thanks for reviewi hope svelt corps still reviews it  slime is pretty cool i knew about the torse for a while but its no less cool now	positive
great review rezourceman your pics really show off the sub well and its good to see the build in progress i also have this set but i didnt apply stickers to the sub as i was planning to reuse the nice dark blue pieces however as shown in your review they do brighten it up a fair bit i cant say this is my favourite agents set the boat is a little oddly proportioned and the sub although retro looking has practically no interior and would be difficult to customise to put more in unlike say the clever job batbrick did with the penguin sub in his review the sub kind of looks like some jules verneish sea creature  i would have liked it if theyd gone all the way and made it some kind of giant robot jellyfish or squid i do agree with you about slime face  he has a fantastic torso with all the slime dripping down which is a bit obscured by the air tank its really encouraging that in the last 2 missions weve had great extra villains added in the only thing i would add about the octopus is that the glow in the dark plastic is mixed in unevenly with the aqua blue so it doesnt glow in the dark evenly  its kind of like the mars mission jellies in that respect though much cooler thanks again for the great review	negative
sveltecorps on jul 11 2008 0914 am said i would have liked it if theyd gone all the way and made it some kind of giant robot jellyfish or squid coughalphateamcough anyway i was about to reply earlier and say  great review svelte then i realised it was not you nice reveiw anyway the only reason i would get this set would be if i got all the other agents sets  all the sw cw sets  all the pieces i need on bl  all the new city ect setsthen i would think about geting it	neutral
darthlegois on jul 11 2008 1028 am said color0000ff coughalphateamcough id forgotten about ogels mutant vehicles i guess i meant a bigger cross between the 8636 sub and the big squid from 7775 aquabase invasion  that is such a great design sort of keep the retro feel but make it bigger with the 8636 sub theres really only room for one agent to sit and despite its size theres just a few not amazingly great functions such as the hidden chest and missiles	positive

thanks for the review its great to see detailed pictures of slime face the set looks good but not as good as some of the others in this line great review	neutral
it was £3499 so usd its likely to be 4555 i would imagine	neutral
aside from the price i love this set when i saw the prelim pics of agetns i did not like the theme but all the sets are starting to look more attractive now i can see the cool features and details as for this set i really like the badguy boat for some reason and the submarine looks good  i love the dark blue colour	positive
batbrick on jul 19 2008 0953 am said is it impossible or just very hard to mod nothing is impossible to mod probably the easiest part to change would be the front where the missiles are and the treasure chest slides out  you could make a sizeable compartment there however the middle section is so narrow and the end fins are just that  fins  that it might be harder to expand without changing the shape of the sub youll find out soon when yours arrives batbrick on jul 19 2008 0953 am said the octopus sounds great thanks for that is he meant to be on any side im guessing hes a mutant inferno creature about slime face is his head much different to the joker bombs i know he has slime marks on his head are they very apparent its not really clear but since all the other mutants are evil or at least controlled by dr inferno its probably a safe bet the squid is too slime faces head is different to the joker bombs  different eyes and teeth although the smile is similar i guess and the slime marks are much more apparent in the flesh or abs although they dont photograph that way joker bomb face below for contrast	neutral
inertia on jul 21 2008 1229 pm said wow thanks for the review that is one awesome set i think we need some new agents theres so many inferno minifigures now maybe next year theres only 2 infernos out of 8 sets which is pretty good theres way more agent chases and break jaws i agree though next year hopefully well have some new figs	positive
great review i just thought id comment saying thanks because if i hadnt found this review id of never made an account on eurobricks	neutral
thebrickster on jul 10 2008 1048 pm said for those of you following my classic space reviews this is review number 9 of 10 my final review of anall time favorite will be coming soon no more of your great reviews why a good review right here got into the thick of the set without becoming boring with an absence of pictures or not having enough text this looks like a good set and id better catch up with the rest of your reviews asap	neutral
thanks for the review this is one of my favorite space sets of all time i even had 2 of them back in the days my only complain about this set was that i found that the wheels where too small  i had some trouble passing the rover over the little cratersmountains of the space plates	positive
this is a great little set i like how it combines two very different color schemes for different parts of the model i have made some slight modifications to mine adding a roof on the vehicle and a back wall on the outpost also those white 1x1 headlight plates at the front are thinner than the modern kind and seem to be quite weak i got this set off ebay a while ago and one of them was broken in shipping even though the set was otherwise in display model condition and the other one broke off while i was building the set i replaced them with the newer variety mutex on jul 10 2008 1137 pm said my only complain about this set was that i found that the wheels where too small  i had some trouble passing the rover over the little cratersmountains of the space plates the only bad thing about this set is the name it cant even roll over a single plates height not very all terrain at all edited by cp5670 11 july 2008  0743 am	positive
thanks for another informative review of the best lego theme ever and not in attempt to hijack your thread but to add to it heres a pic of my blacktron 1 version of this beautiful set the 6927 has to rate as one of the best 5 classic space sets ever along with 918 6970 and 928	positive
give me an excuse to sneak into your house and let me have a feel of these classic space sets i never had a chance to have any experience with the classic space sets through your recent reviews on these it gave me a wider perspective of space i loved to play space as a child such as the late classic and futuron sets back to the review this 6927 is a great mobile command center vehicle suitable for all kinds of harsh terrain in the unknown space the 6 big wheels are real solid and firm back in those days transparent blue windscreen at the front is wonderful i just love these parts especially when its in blue 4 computer printed tiles arent lego so generous back in those days when printed parts are more commonly available unlike now its a real nice set however there is one thing i dont understand about this design why is the driver seat has a wide back with no cover behind and the command center has no door at the back i understand that these space guys are always carrying their helmet around for oxygen supply i wonder if there is a better answer to it	positive
thebrickster on jul 11 2008 1016 pm said yes the extra space was probably for the oxygen tanks on the figs it makes taking them off a lot easier as for the labcontrol center i never had an issue with it being open i think this was just for playability one could always pretend that some sort of invisible force ray closed the side when activated invisible force fieldray that is a very neat idea i dont have much problem with it either was just curious about the design as i am not very familar with classic space i supposed the oxygen tanks is quite big to carry around especially when the vehicle is so cramped these allowance of space makes them much mobile to move about in the vehicle cp5670 on jul 12 2008 0239 am said i just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed great job thanks for sharing and answering the question i posted above i love the way you modify the front and back now i need to find where is the entrance to the mobile command center	neutral
ive always associated this set with 6929 the voyager theyre of the same timeframe and more or less the same style 6927 is without any doubt my favourite ground vehicle of space it was pretty simple but it was such a creative set the stories you could tell with this model g most defenitely in my top 5 of space sets	positive
this set never got me as a kid i suspect it was because of the wheels i had mostly basic sets so it would have been more of the same looking at it now i can see i have misjudged it and i love the lablift method im going to have to build this to see it in action thanks for another great review	positive
awesome review brickster i didnt you are also a space fan oh how i love classic space the all time perfect lego space related theme everytime i see one i want to buy them more and more when compared to modern fang dangled sets with detailed figs and cool new accessories they have nothing on classic space simple beauty maybe its the bluegreytrans yellow color scheme classic space forever edited by piranha 30 august 2009  0751 am	positive
yeah first time that i am getting a set before everyone first of all the package the european version has no limited edition button hooray sorry for the blurry backshot we see the hospital back a few bubbles with set functions and a little comic comic bubbles the figures are injured spongebob patrick and the new fish doctor spongebob has a headprint and a backprint other than the normal spongebob spongebob and injured bob the set comes with two litters the ambulance car is a bit extraordinary i don´t know how the car is like in the show and i saw a lot of episodes but it looks a bit strange mostly because the weehls are too small of course we get another ss not so d this time the litter fits in the back with help of this lid i wish it would be the hingelid from before 2004 now we come to the meanpart of the set the hospital the entrance has got babyblue traindoors and a hudge sign that shows emergency the tubes are nearly everywhere in this set i was getting insane when i came to the part where i must put the stickers on the tubes this parts are very usefull but i wanted that the set looks good because i will display it so i stickered just two of the parts and not all four now we come to the interroir the doctor has a desk with computer sadly it´s not very well placed and he must duck because of his fin next to the door we get this little case wash basin and two drawers again we get stickers not that i don´t like stickers it´s just everytime i get to the part where i must put the stickers on i think how i can reuse the model and if i rebuild the model later and and and i hate it to deside a few posters are in it too the set is a great addittion to your own bikino bottom but the playability is not very big for the kids they can just play that patrick steals the ambulance car like shown on the package and is hitting spongebob than the drive back the doctor gives spongebob two medicines and let him go i bought the set mostly because of the parts tubes in lightbley and a few woodpieces but i am thinking about let it stand in my little bikini bottom just consist of crusty crab and chum bucket playability 310 figures 1010 price 810 design 910 total 3040	positive
oh so spongebob was the injured one i thought this set depicted the episode wherein mr krabs was the one rushed to the hospital	neutral
i love the sponge bob sets i have all of them nice review	positive

i ordered the set via sh and it cost 3499€ in germany 3799€ in belgium and 50 in australia it looks like it´s a exclusive set but without the 2limited edition sticker on the package in the usa it´s not aviable now i think it costs as much as the rocket ride 30  mrs pegleg he has the same short pants like in the other sets	neutral
nice review the set looks promising	positive
wow that set looks better than i thought i just might get it if its under 30 usd i love all the details inside and it seems to have a better interior than the city hospital and the new figs look nice	positive

the official name for this lego set is the emergency room i have all the other spongebob sets including three krusty krabs two bikini bottoms as well as one of everything else  now all i need to do is wait until next month to buy this set if i find it at my local toys r us that spongebob minifig looks cute	positive
im not a huge fan of spongebob but this set i might want also have maybe i can combine it with the city hospital	positive
thanks navy trooper fenson for the review  good one  i really like that sb is printed i will need to get this one when i go to the us in two weeks copmike	positive
nice review nft i´m not that much into spongebob but these two pieces just for themselves are interesting to get container cupboard 4532 and cupboard drawer 4536 the latter not being sold for the last 6 years both together are an excellent way to create detailed interiors 6 of those for me please	positive
theres a lot great pieces in this set i would be willing to get the set just for them thanks for the great review	positive
my fish doctor has the torso from 7902 doctors car which is unfortunate because the other torso is more stylized and cartoonish i think however i did have that mad scientist lab set so a bit of digging through my old collection will hopefully yield the better torso	neutral
i recently bought this set for my daughters birthday its the first belville set that ive bought for her so its a bit of an experiment the house is 5 rooms and its made up of mostly large pieces there still is a decent amount of normal lego in it though the doorways in the house align when it is opened out starting with the bathroom included is a shower toilet sink with vanity and a baby potty the mirror sticker is one of the few that i put on the open plan loungekitchendining room is well appointed as well and it has a nice glass table and coffee machine the kitchen chairs are fabuland parts and dont work really well it seems they are having jellyfish for dinner the clock is the only printed part in the set upstairs is a baby room and the master bedroom the radio and the tv not shown were stickers to my disappointment up top is an extra room suitable for reading those antenna things were made from spare parts by my daughter i have no idea what they are supposed to be  there are some stickers that go on the back but i didnt put them on as it is the set looks ok this way but since it is a dolls house it doesnt really matter i do think though that the fireplace should have been given a back the bbq is made from normal parts and is quite effective i think it uses the same light brick thats in the 4998 stegosaurus set my kids were using it as a torch before my grumbling ruined their fun like all belville sets the highlight is arguably the accessories ill be borrowing a few of these from time to time here is the controversial baby catapult as you can see it works ok but lego probably should have tried a bit harder we also bought for her 7583 playful puppy it also comes with some nice accessories but not enough to justify buying unless you want the rest of the parts poor puppy where does he sleep here is my daughter assembling it she made me make the house though as she wanted to play a game we bought her note the lego drink bottles  i didnt take any photos of the figures as they dont seem to be anything new but i can if people want me to at the time i was in bit of a hurry as i took these before bed so i wouldnt be stressed if the kids broke it the next day overall these sets seem overpriced to me and hard to justify unless you actually want a buildable dolls house which we did its still too early to tell if my daughter likes it or not but at this stage it seems she lost interest in a few days she does tend to go back to toys though edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0703 pm indexed	negative

yay its good to see your kids get to build some stuff too sinner  all through the review i was thinking this was a present  but who actually put it together so im glad the last pic cleared things up as for the set  it looks much bigger than i expected  i think it does make a good sized dollhouse there are a stack of nice pieces in there  cupboards oven transblue 2x5 bricks all the accessories plants flowers food the lightup brick the pink roof slopes  but not enough to justify the aud129 retail price maybe on sale id pick it up and resell the belville figs but david jones hasnt even had a regular 20 off lego sale for the whole of this year that ive seen i think the playful puppy set is a horrendous ripoff for aud20 though i agree with the baby catapult  the range is terrible lego just isnt trying any more is it at least theyve moved on from throwing cats off three storey buildings 2 questions though 1 was it a fun build 2 are those large figs anatomically correct under their froufrou finery if not what the hell are they doing in the second pic whilst baby sylvia explores the oven	neutral
excellent review its nice to see how its nice to see how   its nice  okay i cant get over the sex in the bedroom and the unattended baby crawling into the oven i didnt read anything else except where does the puppy sleep and my daughter made me build this you are sick and twisted and thats why i love you it seems you are coining the belville edge now will you please stop sitting around eating clams and get that baby out of the oven or make the fun in the bedroom a threeway please thank you ps ok i read it i want the baby toilet and i think the jellyfish is supposed to be a jellomold i bet you knew that the fireplace lattice look like the harry potter one and not the fabuland one boo wienies when your daughter outgrows it will you turn it into a belleville star wars moc please thank you in advance	positive
baby catapult you say puts a basenet to shame top review by the way lego drink bottles for the win edited by mrs pegleg blockbeard 12 july 2008  0637 am	positive
great review and i note something like a bucket in the dog set shame its not blue as for the fire place piece i love it and i want one ever since finding it on mlcad i love the bbq it looks so good you know i might even buy this it it was not so pink now as for the kiddies in ovens make sure they are not over cooked they can be stringy  and as for the couple up stairs now we at least know what you do with your mini figs when no one is looking lego sets in public places  just following your name sake i guess and i must say lego shame shame that catapult needs reviwing hardly even make a dent in a castle wall regards cpt pb	positive
i was sort of hoping for a flickfire baby still this looks decent for what it is i guess obviously it really is all about the accessories and its got em but not enough to make me spend that kind of cash and i dont even mind having a pile of pink parts around if you throw in a complete turkey or some birthday cakes its a slam dunk but as it is eh thanks for the review though its very nicely presented and leaves no doubt in my mind as to just how easy this set would be to misuse for other purposes	neutral
nice review good to see your almost letting your kids play with your lego i like the functionality of the baby catapult its good that they include some working features in a build this big are you not showing the figures because its really hugh hefners playboybelville mansion i dont see the grotto though must be an add on set like the poor puppy its just so darn pink	positive
the lego lives on but you are one evil parent getting your kids addicted to belville like that but uh whats that doll doing on the bed whats underneath it and look what you found a bucket	neutral
a nice review with a nice touch of sinner which made me laugh the playfull puppy set has saussages i think i would buy a playfull puppy it has nice pieces and the puppy can also be used for minifigs as a big dog why havent they not made a saussagesseller for city maybe in the future there are already more chickenlegs in minifigs sets	positive

sinner you know i had never seen a belville set in any review with such great pictures before i just cant take my eyes off in the master bedroom the scene is quite a little hot enough of me peeping up there lets take a look at the interior i am very surprised by its construction of the house its quite big and is nice of you to buy a great sweet gift for your daughter i am very sure she will enjoyed playing with it somehow it reminded me of barbie doll products maybe its too pinkish for me the accessories is the plus factor in any belville sets it offered quite a handful of great accessories to add into any types of mocs construction to add in the plus factor in it sinner you are a very nice dad i like how parents buy educational toys for their children to expand their imaginations instead of sitting in a couch playing video games and etc	positive

i bought this today mainly because it was 25 off but id been eyeing it for a long time the accessories truly are brilliant theres so much here to be pillaged for other uses as people have said i picked up heaps of new parts ive never had or rare ones in even rarer colours to be honest i was surprised and impressed by the range and versatility of the regular bricks as well when you look at the box art what jumps out at you are the giant pink walls and curved pieces but theres a nice amount of white arches and lime green bricks not to mention all the windows and the trans blue 1x2x5 bricks and plants its a good thing the target audience likes stickers though theres more here than ive seen on any set except the 7709 sentai fortress i think they were aiming for one sticker per page of instructions i hope belville returns in 2010 thanks for the review sieggy did your daughter ever go back to it	positive

7655 clone battle pack year 2007 number of pieces 58 number of minifigs 4 price 999 usd brickset welcome to my third review on eurobricks i hope you enjoy while at any store that sells lego target walmart tru etc you will notice that the clone battle packs on the shelf are way fewer in number than the droids battle pack as you might guess the clones are way more popular and finding them gets harder and harder as the release date of this set goes farther into the past so stock up alright heres a pic of the box a small box as expected for inexpensive sets like these note the build your army button on the front tlg obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples and with good reason which will be explained later in this review well lets get straight to it the contents of this set you will notice a speeder bike a gun turret and some clones looking good so far lets have a look at the turret an excellent star wars element to have around especially for mocing it is very cleverly built using a tire guard from city sets for the general shape of the turret mount all you have to do is attach the new mold explained later gun to the 2x1 plate with the center stud and presto i wonder how the clones build these turrets to fast in the middle of battle a rear view with a clone mounted my only gripe about the turret is that you have to take off the gun in order for every clone to have a gun now we move on to the vehicle of the set the speeder bike a rather sleek and good looking bike with some useful pieces on it as well such as the blue cones the megaphones and the engines some say it looks bare without the figs mounted on it but i think it looks just fine the commander drives while a trooper shoots on the back a side view and a rear view my only gripe is the same as the turret you have to remove the back gun for all the clones to have weapons while on foot the back pistol attaches to a 2x2 round studded plate with a technic hole in the middle finnaly here are the new guns this set comes with 1 new blaster rifle and three new pistols it could have included one more rifle for the turret and of course the figs includes 1 yellow commander lovely fig 1 shocktrooper comes with a pair of elctrobinouculars and two regular troopers so clean and white the figs are excellent all that any sw or lego fan should want it could have maybe included one more regular trooper but that might be pushing it thats all for now folks here is the final verdict build 810 extremely easy should take the seasoned builder about 5 minutes to complete a fun build though playability 510 i guess you can get this with the droid battle pack and make them battle but this set has no real play features of its own but it is good for collecting troops and using them for mocs swooshability 910 i guess you can zoom the speeder bike around minifigs 1010 four great figs that should be bought in multiples a great army builder design 1010 a clever turret an awesome speeder and four great clones what more do you need in a 10 dollar set price 810 not bad i suppose but if you calculate a dime for each piece this set should come out to 56 dollars but still billions of these are being sold worldwide and tlg is making a ton of money off of them overall score 9510 a truly memorable set one that will be a favorite for ages to come and very popular a great army builder for a small price plus vehicle and turret with only a few very minor flaws this set is one of the best of star wars and this concludes my review and as always comments are most welcome	positive

7654 droids battle pack year 2007 number of pieces 102 number of minifigs 7 price 999 usd brickset hi everybody and welcome to my fourth review on eurobricks today i will review the droid bttle pack set note this set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid but i replaced them along with the crooked arms with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms a picture of the box as it is on the shelves of majorretail stores a small box as expected for inexpensive sets like these note the build your army button on the front tlg obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples and with good reason which will be explained later in this review an overview of the sets content you can see a droid carrying vehicle a stap and some battle super battle droids a look at the carrier a light tank note the guns on the front the guns and cockpit can turn a little bit left and right from the main body also the guns can move up and down free from the cockpit and check out the cockpit two 2x1 center studded plates side by side for the pilot to stand on now moving on to the stap a small very useful vehicle in the sw universe these are seen frequently in both the movies and games as well as other multimedia the design is very clever using vertical building and a clear stand rear view the guns handlebars can go this far back and finally the figs the figs are very good but very common we havent seen sbds in a while and now instead of metallic blue they are metallic dark grey the worst part of this set is that the battle droids have the old arms and guns while the droids in the mtt and clone pack both of the same year as this have the new ones i wonder why tlg decided to do that again this set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid but i replaced them along with the crooked arms with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms so thats about it heres the final verdict build 810 very easy should take the seasoned builder about 510 minutes playability 610 has a few play feature but nothing exciting is good for mocs and army building swooshability 810 i suppose you could fly around the stap minifigs 710 the battle droids are good but very common and the dont come with new arms or guns the sbds are very nice and in a new color all figs are great for army building design 810 the stap was clever but the carrier was a little bulky price 1010 as fair as it gets overall 7510 the figs are great to have and make mocs and armies and the vehicles are pretty cool the carrier is a little lame the main problem with this set is that the bds dont get the new guns or arms so they dont fit in with all the new sets also droids arent as cool as clones but the price is very fair and now my review has ended unfortunately i believe this will be my last review for a long time for two reasons one the remaining sets that arent done according to kimts index i either dont have or are broken or have missing pieces and two my budget is low right now and i wont be able to get the clone wars sets right when they are released so someone will probably beat me to reviewing them too bad because i would love to do an rgs review well as always comments very welcome	positive

hello all eurobricks members and town lovers this is my first classic town review for today i will be featuring the 6641 4wheelin truck which is produced in 1987 for some younger members in eb you might not have encounter such a baby roaming down the streets horning at others with its big massive truck considering this is a 1987 set such a vehicle size is considered big in those days name 4wheelin truck theme lego system  town year 1987 pieces 80 minifigs 1 price usd650 an image of a 6641 4wheelin truck hello everyone why the name 4wheelin truck it is because this truck is equipped with 4 heavy duty wheels which is considered big among other small vehicles in classic town please take note most of the vehicles that are produced in classic town era are 4studs wide this truck is no exception meet the driver and his truck this truck has a very good combinations of different colors that are common for most town vehicles it made used of blue white and red as its primary combinations i find that this combinations is quite soothing to its eyes especially the blue bricks in addition the minifig torso is superb the driver must be a great fan of this vehicle i realised most truck drivers in the classic town era wear this most of the time i wonder if its some kind of an organization front view there is 2 red doors coupled with the truck to enable the driver to get in properly this vehicle is considered big in the 1980s however if you compared it with the current city vehicles this truck certainly will not outsize the current designs please take note of the wheels the wheels are pretty different i dont remember seeing these wheels in many other vehicles maybe some members can help me on this most of the classic town vehicles have a window frame on top which is known as a sunroof in this set this feature is also included furthermore the vehicle frame has a simple mechanism which all town lovers love it is to lift it up and place their driver in and out the seat most importantly you do not have to take off the entire window frame just to put in the driver different angles of the 4wheelin truck snot technique back 20 years ago lego had been experimenting with snot technique you can see that the back looks very neat without the studs in addition it can be quite useful to place a minifig on top of it or throw some baggage for some quick getaway summary review playability 810 great addition to your town collection design 8510 very good design i love 4studs truck at least it is able to occupy one side of the lane price 910 an inexpensive set based on the 1987 pricing overall 8510 a must have for all classic town lovers we have been complaining for more wider range of vehicle i gave it a 4 based on my review score card what about yours hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated edited by whitefang 13 july 2008  1208 pm	positive
great review of a lovely set thank you sadly i dont see my 6641 really often because it is kind of in the back of my shelf but i might get it and swoosh it  a few times imho i think 6675 is a little bit more aggressive cool please make more	positive
hmmm i probably would not have bought this as a kid in 1987 unless i had money to spare or the shop had no other set from space or castle the two other big lines in 1987 and no better set in the town section i think its a great parts pack but the model itself does not look very attractive i never really liked those wheels honestly theyre from the basic sets mostly and they work pretty well in those but im just not a fan the roof on the other hand was very popular and the blue modified bricks at the front were quite rare in those days but generally speaking this was not the star of 1987 gave it a 3	negative

thanks everyone glad that you guys enjoyed this review rriggs on jul 13 2008 0806 pm said as for the wheels these were primarily technic wheels but did find their way into some other models in white i can only find a handful of minifig sets that they are included with theres half a dozen space sets but apart from the 4wheelin truck the only other town set appears to be the 6524 blizzard blazer tractor with snow plough the wheels were also in a train set called 4549 road  rail hauler where they were the wheels on a big forklift i never realised that i supposed these wheels is one of the earliest technic parts appeared in system sets zzz on jul 14 2008 0549 pm said minifig is really classic made only for this set appears in some later train sets as well and shows the exact image of the truck on the shirt including the motor piece one of the most detailed and loveliest little sets from a sweet era of legoland city i will show it to you in a few days time that this minifig torso does not only appear in this set in fact i am quite fond of this lovely torso with its symbolic truck printed on it snefroe on jul 14 2008 0737 pm said hmmm i probably would not have bought this as a kid in 1987 unless i had money to spare or the shop had no other set from space or castle the two other big lines in 1987 and no better set in the town section i think its a great parts pack but the model itself does not look very attractive i never really liked those wheels honestly theyre from the basic sets mostly and they work pretty well in those but im just not a fan the roof on the other hand was very popular and the blue modified bricks at the front were quite rare in those days but generally speaking this was not the star of 1987 i wouldnt agreed less this set is a good to have and is defintely not the main highlights in 1987 this is actually a great addon to your classic town vehicle collections after seeing so many typical police cars ambulance fire engine and etc i need more variety of civillan vehicles roaming down the streets	neutral

that sounds amazing a wind power plant as a lego set is absolutely awesome and helps the lego city to get environmental energy regrettably i missed the pics when browsing through bs i didnt find them too  can someone please post a link or sent me the linkpicture via pm  thanks klausdieter	neutral
i now found pics too thats absolutely  after 10188 town plan this is the best city set ever i really like the neat landscape with the little hill there are a bench and some flowers on it too  and this brilliant cottage  great idea with that power function that the wind mill turns and then enable the lights of the cottage  concerning the city theme i must say in the last time tlg comes up with one great surprise after the other does anyone know where and when itll be available this year i think  otherwise there wouldnt be already pics would they and how much itll cost i think about 70 euros what do you think i only hope that itll be available in germany too otherwise i would be really if i am not able to get it since it is a must for every city and environment fan klausdieter edited by klausdieter 14 july 2008  0649 pm	neutral
i also found the pics and most of what i can say is its kind of funny how its a small house with a gigantic windmill over it though	neutral
jsn on jul 14 2008 0835 pm said i think the great thing about the cottage is its very reminiscent of classic holiday home type houses that lego used to make like this one from the late 80s which a lot of people me included believe lego need to make more of i totally agree with you jsn date this house in your link reminds me of the old weekendholiday cottages   hopefully the cottage in the wind power plant set cottage includes a nice interior too the outside looks amazing anyway  i really would like to see more apartment holiday homes too but how it seems tlg is on its best way towards doing that klausdieter	positive
i recently got a few still sealed and new sets from the 90 on ebay and after the rock raiders hover scout this isthe second one ill review i really like the space port theme even if the sets may be more simple than earlier space city sets i like the overall look and the color scheme but enough of that lets go on with the pictures set nr 6455 name space simulation station number of minifigs 3 number of pieces 240 release year 1999 first again a few pics of the boxes and the instructions the main box this theme had a kinda strange seperation of the pieces the parts for the control center and the shuttle are in seperate little boxes and the others are in polybags with the models printed on them also seperate instructions for each step a general overview we got 3 lovely minifigs here from left to right the control engineer the mechanic and the astronaut the i dont know the english word for it testingthing the astronaut is being tested to hard nerves there the mechanics little car on the back an extinguisher and a radio device is attached the takeoff station for the little shuttle with the shuttle itself on it and without it tools tools tools the shuttle as standalone i think that would be fuel tanks i like this little detail and finally we have the controll room would have been better with seats but its alright a really sweet midsized set if you ask me a few juniorized parts but it fits perfectly with the set the theme itself is also great and i wish that tlg brings it back i could see stunning sets with the quality city sets have right now	positive
in the catalog images i thougt that the base was on a 1616 baseplate i have some sets of spaceport and like them but i would want real town sets in 1999 edited by lord santos 15 july 2008  1058 am	neutral

my sister got this from our grandparents once when she was interested with space but it fell into my hands later i had a lot of fun with that by the way the name for the test thing is called a centrifuge it tests a persons ability to withstand high gforces edited by filefolders 15 july 2008  0355 pm	positive
i had never seen this set or this theme before it was released during my dark age and i had missed it its nice to see such sets surface once again to educate members like me that there are some good sets we had missed during the dark age and i must admit that this is a very good set its comes with 3 minifigs and staudie with it geez i never thought he was an astronaunt back then the testing facility is great and i love to see it spin by putting staudie in it for a testrun the buggy is cute as well but somehow i dont really like the white frame at the back it looked a little odd to me the tools are simply wonderful to have furthermore these are grey tools the last time we had so many tools are the aeroplane mechanic the shuttle is nice but does the shuttle supposed to come with a cover as well i guess since this is a simulator they must have cut down the budget for it the control room is good and it will be even better with chairs included metalandi thanks for the wonderful review	neutral
thank you very much for the review now i remember i got mission control when i was only 5 and built it with the help of my older sister i loved it so much i never rebuilt it but now i just have to space simulation was one i never got but looks to be a great set	neutral

dfenz on jul 17 2008 1142 pm said nice review with very clear pics i have preordered this item at a local belgian store and will be getting it on july 29th together with the 7676 gunship wow 5999eur is a lot of money what country do you live in here it costed me 46eur so quite a price difference imo the sets certainly not worth that much money reki	neutral
the figs theyre possibly the best part of the entire set all in all nice new head although the glasses limit its usability i am in love with the head on that fig its perfect for any number of figures  a good scarred hero face has always been on my want list im turning him into my viking warlord after i post this review again a new head great stubbly beard thing going on my secondfavorite head of the lot great for warriors especially with helms the torsos are fantastic for special forces figures if anyones planning to do something like that not too fond of the lime green on there but its still extremely usable this is actually a really cool machine gun i like it i think this would be a good point to note that all designs you see  outside the figures and dinos  are stickers that means a crapload of stickers if you cant stand stickers at all in a set dont buy this	positive
the base of the propeller it wobbles a bit but doesnt fall off very sturdy right side of the rear propeller and the left and better side the tail it uses construction similar to the xwings nose but on a larger scale definitely cool a very neat part of the copter the guns are constructed so that  they turn without turning the cockpit the interior is rather blase though	positive
another of my favorite parts  landing gear this is the front section  and it retracts unlike most ships with landing gear this does not retract without effort coughxwingcough very sleek the back landing gear  and again smooth retraction gotta love it final score 8410 parts 810 figs 1010 dinos 210 copter 910 value 710 dont buy if  you can wait for vikings  you dont like any set with stickers  youre not a space fan buy if  youre a space fan  you dont mind stickersdont apply them  youre like to create cool figures overall i think it was worth the price even at 605 pieces however id suggest buying vikings even considering this well hope this review unexpected as it was  helped someone out there until next time bloody jay	positive
as unexpected as it was this was very helpful  three questions though 1 is the front green rubber missle a traditional launchable missle or does it have another firing mechanism 2 concerning the guns on the side are they fixed in one postition or does it have any functions 3 why did you decide to buy this set just curious	neutral

thanks bloodyjay another brilliant review i really like the helicopter though i hate the stickers it seem like there are a lot of it it wont stop me from buying it too bad that when will the dino line arrive in singapore    guess ive have to wait for the meanwhile	positive
that looks like a really great set although i dont think id have anywhere to put it i dont think ill ever be able to get the set anyway since it doesnt come out over here	positive
sam89 on jul 25 2005 0111 pm said that looks like a really great set although i dont think id have anywhere to put it i dont think ill ever be able to get the set anyway since it doesnt come out over here sam missing your point the set should come to europe as 7298 but without guns large crate instead	neutral
hmmmm     interesting its a shame though because i really like the guns any idea when it should come to europe edit ive just scene the official dino attack site which says theyre coming to europe in october	neutral
does anyone have photos of the ones being released in europe id like to compare the ones here in the us to the ones in europe	neutral
no there arent any pictures yet	neutral
wow great review for a great set thanks jay i really like it although to big for my city  i too really like the mfs because of your review i am definitely considering it thanks again legobmw	positive
i guess well have to wait for the photos officially announced by lego the dino attack line is going to be made available in europe in october 2005 edit check out the official dino attack site here	neutral
yeah i picked up another one i really liked the chopper lets cut straight to the chase dinos first the worst of course these things are so horrible they dont deserve more than one photo theyre rubbery one piece and the only things that remotely indicate that theyre made by lego are the holes on the bottom of their feet theyre unrealistic to an extreme unmatched by even the previously reviewed dinos in that they are waaaaaaaay too thin one is pink and theyre all grinning fig one interesting thing to note is that this one has the same torso as the ironmasked dude in the chopper not his own barearms torso pic for the sake of comparison now i dont consider this fig as good as the others because the other heads are useful for vikings and assorted castletype people but this has sunglasses all in all youll probably find it useful but i dont still great torso for special ops stuff hummer those headlights  while stickers yes all prints are again stickers although there are much less than the chopper  are great pieces i can see using them as furnace covers or stove burners the windshieldhood area not much to say about this one drivers side my question when this is brought to europe will the steering wheel switch sides  seriously though i love that little steering wheel piece more than i love taffy and im a man who enjoys his taffy left side in its entirety  and the right side view through the right side  no seat here couldve done with another fig to fill the nonexistant seat as well	positive
the weapon whatever its called this uses the same mechanism as the longboat for those that dont have either you snap the little sports stand thing which hits the missile which fires and since theres nothing holding the technic beam up to that height any more it drops down so that the next missile drops into place pretty cool if unrealistic the two on the side do not fire i think theyre mainly there for extra ammo my biggest problem with this set open bed this could have easily been remedied with a few plates interior opened the fire hammer next to the t1 they look very cool together dont they you can also see my curio shelf final score 7410 dinos 110 fig 810 but thats just me hummer 8510 parts 910 im a harsh reviewer i still think that if spacevehicles are your thing you should buy this however if youre a bigger castle fan or just like to get all sorts of lego i would still suggest buying the viking catapult before this however i do think that these are some of the coolest sets of 2005 this is something you will eventually want to get until next time bloody jay	positive

mr legobildur on jul 25 2005 1011 pm said thanks bloody jay any chance you could be reviewing the other dino attack sets possibly the steel sprinter and urban avenger but i can say with finality that i will not buy the tank until i find it available for 30 or less on that note if anybody does find it for 30 or less shoot me a pm 	neutral

wow i think this is the first time im the first to have a new set at least here and review it got it 2 days ago thanks to a fast shipping from sh this time and i found time now to review it now enough of the babbling lets let the facts and pictures speak which actually turned out pretty well this time set nr 4210 name coast guard platform number of minifigs 4 number of pieces 469 release year 2008 a few shots of the box first 2 books of instructions we got here first one for the helicopter second one for the rest and the platform itself a general overview of the platform from above the 4 minifigs 3 rescue guys and one oil rig worker  the pilot seems not very happy that he has to work in the middle of nowhere at sea right beside the entry of the tower we have the diving equipment holder next the guy can jump in this little speedboat and another guy brings it down to water with the crane if somebody is rescued from the air he arrives here and is brought to the tower with the little moving platform than runs on rails down under we got a buoy and several life belts and extinguishers with the lift somebody who is rescued by the boat can be brought up i think it would been better if they would have made a mechanism there to bring it up but its okay a few floors higher the sea is being observated and watched on the ground level we have the medical stationwarmup room the helicopter as standalone all in all for me this is besides the police station the city set of this year its got great features and looks fantastic and also has many useful pieces you cant do anything wrong with buying it 1010 for me thats all for now hope you liked my review edit oh damn i forgot to write review in the topic title can a mod please add this thanks	positive

thanks for the awesome review metalandi your pics are very clear and you go into detail about all the functions of the set i agree this is a great set  one of the best of the cg line for sure way better than the boat set with the tower on the bionicle baseplate and cheaper too i even like the helicopter better than the oversized version lots of great parts and a really nice build by the looks of it too i cant wait for this to be released in oz	positive

good review  i will buy it this year 	positive
excellent review metalandi its always great to see early pictures of new sets this set really reminds me of an oil rig and could probably be easily modified as one if one wanted an alternate model the two components that i like most are the boat crane and the control room but other sections are pretty slick as well are those printed pieces in the control room or stickers im really starting to gain an appreciation for these new coast guard sets theyve come a long way over the years 575 coast guard station released 1978 i picked up the control boat  tower 7739 a few weeks ago but havent opened it yet in any case thanks for taking the time to review this set and share it over eb	positive

paramedic unit set  6364 year released 1980 piece count 140 minifigs 2 list price unknown well let me first say that the english name paramedic unit is not really a good name for this set the function of a paramedic is to take a patient from an emergent situation and deliver them to a hospital for treatment generally an emergency room this is a rather small clinic that i would imagine is more for family care than an emergency room in addition the car looks more like a doctornurses car rather than an ambulance or emergency response vehicle i would call this a clinic rather than a paramedic unit in any case its a great set esp for table towns that need medical services what i like is that this set is small enough to place anywhere in your lego city or town starting with the instructions like all the classic town sets alternate models are pictured although i never tried building one i like the little medical busvan the set includes two minifigs that include a female doctore or nurse and what i presume is a patient based on the torsos i really like the vehicle its a 4stud wide two seater the colors work well and i like the use of the white bar between the seats and the 1x1 blue plates for lights unfortunately the emblems are stickers heres a shot of the neat little clinic i like the use of the blinds for the exam room it shows that lego considered patient privacy when making this set the interior includes an exam room desk and two blue swivel chairs and a neat little eye chart although the letters l e g o would have made a nice touch lastly a picture of the complete set i must admit that i remember buying this set back in the 80s and i regreted it after taking it home im not sure what i didnt like about it perhaps the girl back then but now i really think its a neat set well theres a line of patients waiting to have their eyes checked comments welcome	neutral
thanks i own this set it was a good time as tlg released a lot of little buildings just look through the 63xxsetnumbers	neutral
paramedic unit does not seem to suit well for this sets name it should be named as clinic outpatient treatment family doctor and etc from what i understand parmedic unit is a standalone unit that is on standby 247 ready for any emergency rescue in lego town ambulance with a group of paramedics will be ideal for this kind of situation i love female doctors especially with that lovely hairpiece the cruiser is a neat 4studs wide design just love these small car designs back then i wonder what can be used at the back of its boot the clinic is neat maybe we can send holodoc for some medical audit to make sure that this clinic is up to standard what surprised me the most is the neat little eye chart you dont see such details in any regular lego set the red and white color combination for the building works well for me most of the hospital buildings and vehicles always revolved in red and white i gave this a 4 thanks you so much brickster	positive

brickster strikes again with another awesome review ah one of the few hospital related kits lego made wasnt this the first hospital with modern minifigs because i seem to remember seeing an even older hospital online that had the armless faceless figs regardless this would be great as a little doctors office in someones town layout  although the vehicle is a little silly and that eye chart sticker has to be the coolest decal ever quote maybe a tfol well it sure isnt me i personally love older kits even though im only a teen i like a lot of the newer sets a bit more than some of the classic stuff but i have always agreed that the 70s and 80s were an extremely high point in legos time even though i dont really own any kits from the period edited by grevious 19 july 2008  0505 pm	positive
gave it a 4 its not exactly town plan but its above average	positive
thank you for all these reviews thebrickster and the idea with the polls is a very nice and interesting idea it will only take a while until i will have commented on all  so please give me some time  i gave this set a four the vehicle the minfigs and the design of the house are excellent  only the interior could be a bit spiced up telephone some other equipment klausdieter	positive
whitefang on jul 18 2008 0911 pm said paramedic unit does not seem to suit well for this sets name it should be named as clinic outpatient treatment family doctor and etc the definition of a paramedic is someone who assists physicians in providing medical care i think in more modern times a paramedic is generally thought of as a more qualified and experienced ambulance technician but the dictionary definition would seem to fit with the lego model quite well cheers rog	neutral
i like this set like most i view it more as a clinic it sits nicely in my town plan these old sets are all very cool	positive
wow old thread just for the record so long as it is here paramedics are advanced ambulance technicians unlike standard emts they are trained for advanced cardiac life support they can push drugs defibrillate place a breathing tube etc in the 1980s when the set was made it was quite common for paramedics to respond to calls in fly cars or special response units they would join up with ambulances at the scenes that required their skills if you ever watched the old american tv show emergency johnny gage and squad 51 were one of these response units they were mostly phased out in the 90s in favor of simply putting the paramedics and als gear in the ambulances	neutral
hello all eurobricks members and town lovers today i will be doing up a review on hook  haul wrecker this name is quite wierd to me i will prefer to call it the regular tow truck this is one of the service and repair vehicle that are always ready 247 on standby for any emergency towing in our towns name hook  haul wrecker theme lego system  town year 1989 pieces 44 minifigs 1 price usd600 an image of a 6660 hook  haul wrecker let the towing begins hook  haul wrecker is the typical 4studs wide vehicle that takes care of broken vehicles that is left stranded on the roads this tow truck is pretty useful as you can see current city sets hardly have any tow trucks available to tow new cars design this tow truck is catered for 4studs vehicles for classic town can you imagine yourself this truck towing a speed racer car i think it looks really out of proportion in addition the minifig which is included in this set has the regular truck print on its torso i am very sure they must be a fan club for trucks otherwise they should really need a change of clothes nevertheless in my honest opnion i really love this torso very much somehow it makes them look tough even though their face looks very friendly side view this vehicle has a combination of two primary colors which is white and red this color combination looks very good you cannot mistook it for an ambulance since they made use of this two colors too in most emergency vehicles this is my guess i supposed the designer will have tow truck concept as a form of emergency and considered red and white as its combinations this vehicle setup has the typical sunscreen on the top of the vehicle frame however this baby has more unique features installed in it these are the source of its brutal strength allterrain vehicle this tow truck equipped with the best wheels in fact these wheels offer suspension on the roads even when its travelling uphill the truck will move accordingly with its tyres when you act pressure on the top of the vehicle it will either be shifted leftwards or rightwards closeup of these unique tyres take a careful look these wheels have springs installed in it that is the magic of these vehicle and is defintely suited to run on any rough roads with least problems if any eb members know which other vehicles has this unique features please highlight it to me because if i remembered correctly i only remember seeing this pair of tyres in this great set he is ready for some serious towing the driver had finished hook up the pizza van on its back its pretty simple you just have to lift the back of the vehicle and placed it onto the hook presto the van is ready to go this vehicle provides so much fun you can really tow any 4studs vehicle in your town and here we go to the service station poor pizza guy summary review playability 1010 superb fun you will love to use this truck and tow any vehicles design 9510 excellent design especially with the use of the suspension tyres price 910 an inexpensive set based on the 1989 pricing this set is made up of less than 100 pieces overall 9510 every town must need a tow truck if a vehicle breaks down whom will be ready to tow i gave it a 5 based on my review score card what about yours hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelfwhen moderated	neutral

thanks for all of your encouraging comments i am glad most of you love to view our classic reviews do stay out for more upcoming exciting classic town reviews i appericiate greatly by all of your words there are many outstanding reviews from brickster as well especially those classic vintage lego sets that i had never seen before except browsing it in brickset therefore i will encourage eb members to take some time off to view these truly wonderful classic reviews trust me it shall be an eye opening experience for each and everyone of you whom had never seen classic town in such an up close personal experience before lasse d on jul 19 2008 1222 am said this is one of my favorite town vehicles from the old time and for one specific reason the truck is on the guys shirt it didnt matter that the color was wrong or the hook was missing i thought it was awesome beyond imagination for some reason the torso is just lovely i felt the 6641 4 wheelin truck is almost identical with the torso except for the front color combination click onto the picture for an instant review bernddasbrot on jul 19 2008 0247 am said btw the 6350 pizza to go van looks soooo cute yes that cute pizza van appeared for a reason	neutral
another great review whitefang this is a wonderful 80s vehicle  and i think it might be one of the first  if not the first  that had the spring suspension system i know of at least one other set that had that the biggest extreme team set from 1998 had a vehicle with those pieces quote this tow truck is pretty useful as you can see current city sets hardly have any tow trucks available to tow new cars design this tow truck is catered for 4studs vehicles for classic town can you imagine yourself this truck towing a speed racer car i think it looks really out of proportion firstly speed racer cars are out of scale even with city vehicles also i have hope that in the next few years we will get more octan sets to go with the wonderful gas station  and i suspect that a 6wide tow truck will be at the top of the list it wouldnt be a hard set to make and i bet it would sell well edited by grevious 19 july 2008  0531 pm	positive
oh never seen that set before fun and strange that wheel supension system has it ever been used in any other sets	neutral
indeed they have theyve appeared in 15 different sets in total they also have an identical width with the wide 2x2 wheels holder which is used on cars today they are still excellent today since retrofitting these suspension parts onto todays offroader trucks wont give them weird proportions or any problems and it looks perfect plus they are useful if youre lazy and dont feel like constructing the pinsuspension used in the early 90s for trucktrailers altough stability probably will suffer	neutral
45 ive had this set since i was young never understood why a tow truck needed to be an offroader maybe it was used to tow the other offroad vehicles the suspension made the truck too tall to tow some cars so i often took the hook out and use the truck as just an great offroad truck like 6672 which also had the suspension wheels other tow truck sets better filled their roles better but that doesnt diminish this set at all whitefang on jul 18 2008 0919 am said i think it looks really out of proportion no for 25odd years this vehicle was perfectly proportioned with all others in the towncity line its all these new 6 and 8 and 20 wide vehicles that are ignoring convention and making it look out of proportion granted speed racer sets are more of their own line but 6660 is smaller than most of the cars produced in the last few years	positive
superb review of a great setthis is one of my favourite classic sets becouse of all these functionsenginesuspensionand its great design with less than 100 pieces used only 52 congratulations for the reviewi think that its an outstanding set and surely worth 5 stars	positive

exxon gas station set  6375 year released 1980 piece count 254 minifigs 3 list price approx 20 one of the gems of my sets from 1980 has to be the exxon gas station it has very nice colors lots of great details and a high level of playability starting with the instructions the backside with a great picture of the complete set the set includes three minifigs including two gas station attendants and my favorite the urban cowboy one of the best things about this set is that it includes not one but two very detailed 4stud wide vehicles heres a picture of the red one which is a twoseater the car has two working doors a hood that opens and a little holed brick on the other side for pretending to fill er up heres another image at an angle isnt she a nice set of wheels heres the yellow car i always liked this one better perhaps it was the color with the black pieces in the back although it is a oneseater the set includes four fuel pumps that are numbered with decals and included a string as the hose heres a little accessory rack for oil and tools and another rack for tires the set had a nice exxon logo on three 1x6 bricks a large jack allows the cars to be lifted high into the air for tire and under engine repairs i love the office with its large 5x6 window inside is a chair and desk and the entire set happy motoring in legoland	positive

i think we only got shell stations in europe in the 80s never got this one but it looks like a typical lego gas station  once again i just dont know how you were able to keep stickers and prints in such a great condition i am sooooo jealous the tires of the cars are a problem though it was difficult and painful to put them off the wheel and back on later the black hat g i would have looooooved to have that when i was a boy	negative

great review of a classic set man this is sure a wondeful kit even today the level of detail is astounding for the time and the whole kit is really cute you know i honestly dont get why some people have complained about the city gas stations figure count  the majority of lego gas stations had no more than three figures  including this one and the wonderful gas and wash express which i actually own i also dont get why people complain about the stickers so much  because even older kits often had a lot personally i think stickers are okay because printed pieces cant be used in as many places if the stickers are really specialized	positive
thanks for the fantastic review of the esso petrol  station i like this set a nice contrast to the shell ones it adds a bit of variety to a lego town the cowboy hat is a nice addition too	positive
brickster you need your own sticky review section i love looking at all of these old sets as i have said before you take me back to a much simpler time thank you and on to the set i love this gas station lego really needs to look to its past on some of these sets for the time the level of detail is great i wish i still had this one in one piece as well	positive
okay guys i have built the set so lets review set name 7649 mt201 ultra drill walker price 6999 pieces 759 bought from tor r us in michigan us the box first we have the front it shows the set its functuns and the limited edition sign the box is huge about the size of the dino attack chopper set or the mars mission base nowadays most set that are 5000 or more have a flap displaying the sets functions opening theflap on this box reveals a gigantic picture of the set and the back the bags numbered next the manuals they have piece call outs page numbers etc there are 2 manuals with this set sticker sheets they actually arent all that bad random manual image build first we open bag 1 this will build the alien craft and the minifigures now here we have some interesting parts a green spine from exoforce and a black rim for the set container stacker next we start the build on the alien craft it is pretty sturbdy but has no cockpit for the alien the alien stickers are really cool they are rainbowish and has a silver back next come the build on the wings and the finished craft it is pretty good and has a nice sleek design however i think i will use the large ship for the commander out this year to fight the driller instead next is bag 2 which builds the rover and astro ship first is the ship it starts off with doctor infernos colors it builds up very nice and the detail is absolutley amazing next the roof is built it has some speed racer slopes the hinge piee now has a hole through it sorry for the blurry pic more is added then comes the bottom piece the detail is very nice and the hinge piece has a use later on then you build the crates each one holds two crystals added to the ship also a pic of the finished ship here we start the rover it sports anice detail the orange studs get coveded by the grill to look more like an engine the detail in this thing is pretty good it has a gun and shovel here is how it fits into the ship it slides in and is secured thanks to the hinge okay so next we open the number 3 bag which builds the body here are some interesting pieces then we start the build it begins nice and study i just love these stickers with the bulldogs on them more of the build with the stickers added next we add in the front part the detail is again outstanding with the turntable added it can move down as well the next step is to build the water tank it utilizes the bionicle boostersbig white things and added to the walker then we build that drill it uses a lot of rims and such with the gears added the front part uses a lot of those new droideka 3prong things and bionicle eyes the drill can spin thanks to the gears and added to the vehical next is the cockpit it has a nice space for the astros bckpack added the final stage is the legs thank god they arent like striking venoms they are all the same however see those two rubber parts those keep it in place when on surfaces like glass next come the large part of the legs these are similar to the assault tigers legs the final result is very sturdy thanks too notice the amazing classic space sticker so we finally come down to this the final result is amazing it is sturdy and has great detail it is very realistic and when the ship is removed the drill goes down and the turret is aimed up hope you all enjoyed the review	positive

looks like a great set i may consider making this the first mars mission set i buy nice review also but quote lol thanks i just wanted to claim my place for the review personally i dont think you had a place to claim somebody else could have also gotten this set and had a proper review ready before yours but felt it was wrong to post because you had posted a placeholder  clubninja in this case i think placeholders should be banned and if you are not ready to post a full review you should not post anything simple really either that or what is the policy on here regarding more than one review of a set being posted  then you could have both posted reviews and it wont really matter i guess just my 2 cents worth thanks for the review though	positive
today im gonna review the bigger of the 2 castles from the fright knigh theme i got this one last week at a pretty fair prive at ebay new and still sealed i love opening boxes that had been lying arounf for years and being the first to build an old set since i know this castle theme is not liked so much by the general public ill try here and change their minds cause i really think this is a great set this time i have to say my pictures turned out pretty amazing even if i am still using just my cellphone cam but im really pleased now with the quality here we go set nr 6097 name night lords castle number of minifigs 7 number of pieces 598 release year 1997 lets start with a few box  instructions pictures the inside od the box with a few alternate models the back with another possibility how to assemble the 3 main parts instructions next the 6 minifigs starting with the witch on her black dragon all 5 figures of the fright section and the poor royal knight we go on with the set itself first a general overview its really high on the first floor theres a trap with which you can drop stones or other things down on unliked guests the pot comes originally from fabuland i think i love this thing in the same floor there is a second trap if you pull the bar the door opens we move on to the tower itself did i mention its really high on the ground level theres the place for the witch to do her spells the wall is a secret door which reveals a skeleton when turned over on the next level there is this little thingy first it only seems like a barrel but when you pull the two 1x4 tiles on the back a skull is being revealed scary huh  i dont really understand what this is for but i assume its a telescope to watch and observate the dragons i do find that a bit senseless since there havent been telescopes in medieval times or have there been the back of the tower with the prison and the room for the treasure chest the prison opened its secured with a chain which i like very much cause you really can lock it with that treasure chest from the highest peak we now go down to the very ground level at the back of the castle there is another secret walldoor flanked by two shields at the back half of the inside there is the throne hall for the bat lord with a nice warm fireplace in the back this is where the secret door is placed the second half is pretty empty except for these two baskets i dont know exactly what they are for but i ike the idea for using them as water places for the horses one thing that might be a bit stupid is that 2 of the 4 side entrances do not have doors so they are open and a guard would have to stand there the whole day you can see it in his face he isnt very happy with that  that was my last review of the sets i got the last weeks but im looking forward to make much more in the future overall this is a pretty good set i dont know any other one with so much details and playability the minus point is as already said that it is too open on the sides but that can be solved easily with a bit of modding also i must say this set isnt that much juniorized as many might have thought though the design is a bit unconventional but exactly thats what i like most about it all in all it gets a 910 for me hope you enjoyed the reading and the pictures cant wait to see your response edit oops i forgot to put one figure of the fright knight faction on the photo but its the one in the last picture edited by kimt 10 august 2008  0128 pm	positive
nice review good closeups and a good unconventional choice of a set as for the set itself it has its pros and cons in my eyes i like all the minifigs but especially the witch the fright knights are probably the closest you can get for an evil human castle faction as for the building itself on the other hand i like the fact that it can be modified but some of the design choices are just stupid the holes in the wall the one huge tower as opposed to several smaller ones the huge empty space in the center and the excessive usage of bright yellow i guess for a smaller kid the play value is great its easily accessible and it looks sturdy enough but to an afol its not much else than a source for bricks and figs in my opinion oh and they did have telescopes in the medieval times the witch most probably uses it for astrology and even if they didnt were talking about a castle with a dragon and a wicked witch in it so its not exactly a good example of accurate history	negative
sweet review metalandi this set always looked a bit too busy for my liking i guess i just didnt expect to see a set so tall after seeing your review though it is growing on me i like all the play features and at the very least its a great parts pack two things im confused about though in this pic is that dragon being used as a swing set and i dont get why the area where the witch casts her spells on the second floor is green green in castle means grass or forestmen  and having grass on the second floor of a building is just weird i understand that its modular and thus it would make sense if it were placed on the ground but dark grey would make just as much sense and would look much better than the green there imo anyway im just fussy thanks again for the cool review will we be seeing any more peace	negative
i love the reviews of older sets that i never had also tiny thing but you said it has 7 minifigs but the group shots only include 6 the last guy isnt shown until the very end	neutral
metalandi on jul 20 2008 1223 pm said i actually got one set left i would like to review but im off tomorrow to italy until thursday so i wont be able to do it until then you wont be off till tomorrow thats still a day away theres still time no but still ill be looking forward to the review when you get back peace	neutral
metalandi thanks for doing this fright knights review by opening up a misb set which you have bought recently i am very sure the feeling is very nice especially touching the bricks which is preserved for 11 years sealed in bags i am quite fond of the fright knights theme unfortunately this theme was released during my dark age i never really bought sets from fright knights instead i bought plenty of minifigs to build an army if i could turn back time or find another misb set with a reasonable price i am very sure i will get it my soldiers need a castle to stay in i will be looking forward to your next review keep up the good job	neutral
i read this review not long after you posted it but im not sure why i didnt comment if dragonator is the one to post everytime he sees a dragon related topic i would be the one to post if i see a fright knights topic fright knights is one of my favourite lego themes and this review is really good i got both of the castles in the theme and loved them and your review presents basil the batlords castle well i too thought it was a bit weird that there is a green base when it could be grey but i guess its a useful piece to use in other things fright knights on	positive
ah this brings back memories i have this set and i loved the playabilaty factor opposing to older castle sets i have in medieval times there actually were primitive telescopes you can read about it here thanks for this review great storie great pics	positive
wow what a cool castle and set in general i had no idea that this set existed long dark ages thanks to you metalandi for such a great review the figures look really nice and the set is full of lots of little trinkets  details traps etc i have already had a look on ebay for this set looks like a great set for parts too i give the review 455 evil witches cheers isc	positive
well that the bricks look new comes from that they are new i got this set new and unopened	neutral
ahh i remember how badly i wanted that set when it was new oh well definitely one of the most original castles if not the most i actually liked how the 1st floor was made into a throne room the tower looks pretty impressive too of course the castle has a flagrant flaw  the walls on the sides are open i also think it lacks in the minifig count though that is understandable for a castle with a dragon quote the fright knights are probably the closest you can get for an evil human castle faction totally agreed	positive
quite the topic bump but dang what a cool set and so tall this is the kind of sets i had as a kid but i dont remember this one im jealouss	positive

i must agree great fire station i love the fact that in the classic sets you were given a base plate and some other great ideas i do miss the addition of base plates and alternate building ideas the only newer set i have seen with any alternate build photos is the 7239 fire engine i miss back when	positive
i´m glad you are reviewing 4digit sets now brickster thebrickster on jul 20 2008 0714 pm said this set is one of my favorite fire stations that offers a great amount of playability this pretty sums it up the firestation was one of the few sets in my childhood i owned and was not classic space i especially liked the roller doors this was one of the first sets they came with in the late 80´s i sold it to my nephew darn i really regret it when i asked him a couple of years ago if he still owned it and i could buy it back he also had made cash out of it i gave it a 4 there is always room for improvement like the helipad mentioned so it can´t be a 5 in my opinion take off you rose coloured glasses	positive
no question this is a 5 one of the best and most influencial town sets ever imo	positive

good but i like the heli of set 6571 better another 4 from me	positive
a nice little model with some neat features for its age plus the allyime classic fireman as a bonus however this design of chopper the police station around the same time was the same design i think dated very quickly while is was good to use the hinged car roof  which was relatively new at the time  together with the inverted screen it was superceded very quickly by designs that stood the test of time far better for example 6657 also i dont think i could everbuy a lego fire helicopter because it is not something we have in the ukeire police coast guard ambulance military etc etc but no fire helicopters not something i would therefore want in my lego town great review though many thanks again for doing these cheers rog	negative
well its ok but its not great voted 3 seems the classic town hater has voted a 1 again will the madness ever stop	neutral
i vote outstanding because it makes excellent use of the pieces that were available at the time that cockpit makes excellent use of an inverted windshield	positive
hello all eurobricks members and town lovers today i will be doing up a review on snorkel squad one of the most important and basic vehicle in any fire department snorkel squad in simple english terms it refers to fire engine fighting fire always on standby ready to save the citizens from crisis trust me you will understand why this snorkel squad is superb impressive by the end of this review on a side note there is only part that is replaced by another color can you find the difference name snorkel squad theme lego system  town year 1987 pieces 151 minifigs 2 price usd1350 an image of a 6358 snorkel squad looking smart on their standby this snorkel squad is a fanastic fire engine that is ready to save people from the fires its primary color red is used in all fire emergency department and vehicles in case of any emergency this snorkel squad will be activated and arrived at the scene as soon as possible no time to waste personally this is the best fire engine that i had ever seen meet the fire fighters it comes with two brave fire fighters both of them wear the standard fire fighter outfit that is present in almost all fire station sets in classic town the torso is very nice and formal and looks real impressive onto them i love the buttons on them furthermore these white helmets are a symbol to the world of fire fighting these are the people whom save lives by risking their own lives in dangerous situations water hose compartment the water hose is a string that is stored in the front it can be rolled out and the fire fighters are able to use it without much difficulty they will just pull out the hose and spray onto the fire the next picture shows a much clearer look in its interior in addition the fire logo that is on the compartment is actually printed yes its not a sticker and that is great news for us interesting features these clamps on both sides is supposed to stablise the fire engine when the ladder is heading upwards it is a simple mechanism which illustrate clearly what it does this feature is recently seen in construction vehicle such as the mobile crane of course it is not a complicated feature it just made use of three quite common white parts swivel mechanism these swivel mechanism in my opnion are very fun to play with these connectors on the front and the back enable the long fire engine to make sharp turns on any junctions arriving at the scene fast enough this is not a fire engine that only travel straight roads try it onto your base plates and you will be surprised how well it can turn best playable mechanism in 6358 the driver will be activating the ladder at the back of the vehicle in order to adjust the height and making sure that the ladder do not fall short the tiles on the plates are acting like a stoppage the ladder are able to rotate 360 degree without much problem if you removed the driver out of the control panel it goes up as tall as 30cm look at that amazing height too bad i have not constructed my cafe corner yet otherwise i can give you a better feel of how amazing this baby can go i used the old road baseplate as a guide and roughly it can goes as tall as 30 to 35cm look at the black hinges below by shifting it to the last that was the maximum height it can move this is a very good way to adjust the height oh and i forget to mention that there are 2 storage compartments for the fighters to place their equipments behind quite easy to access no doors apart from the standard roof top on the drivers seat there is no doors present at both side i am quite sad to see that there are no doors maybe these fighters are supposed to jump off the seat instead of opening the doors well i guess this is the only major flaws that i had found in this set heading off got you meet the model 6358 fire engine summary review playability 1010 superb fun the ladder and swivel mechanism is really very fun to play with design 9510 excellent design it got an almost full 10 the lack of doors dropped my ratings slightly price 810 a very mid range price i dont think it cost very expensive but i am not sure how much it cost now overall 9210 best fire engine ever and one of the great looking one too get this model now i gave it a 5 based on my review score card what about yours hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelf when moderated	positive
thanks for another great review i can remember the 6358 very vividly my parents bought the 6340 for me and a girl friend got the 6358 im quiet sure its my envy because until now i want to believe that the 6340 is better my reasons were these i own the 6340 and on the instructions of the 6358 stood legoland which i thought of as old but this review induced me to get over this humiliation from my childhood   and check ebay for the 6358 edited by bernddasbrot 21 july 2008  0407 pm	neutral
a truly great set i always loved the mobile crane and was gobsmacked when this popped up using some of the great features from the crane but also making it an emergency vehicle too great classic firemen and  in your version  a suspiciously blue fire extinguisher great review of a great set  just a pity i no longer have it so many sets i used to have got lost during the period at the end of my childhood before i rescued what was left from my dads house once i realised what i had left behind hindsight is a great thing cheers again rog	positive

what an awesome little set i really like this engine but dont remember seeing it during the late 80s it must have been out during my dark ages i love the basketsection for the firemen equally nice is the fire hose which extends a good length the color combination of red with white and the trans blue windshield looks goos as well this is a great engine and one that would look perfect in a classic tabletown  and its 4studs wide very nice review whitefang i look forward to seeing more of your classic town reviews	positive

nice review whitefang with lots of photos  exactly as a good review should be as for the set  i own it and its a very good one the fire squad vehicle is a nice addition to my other fire dept vehicles it offers very good playability and this ladder is so long you can have so much fun with it	neutral
great set i found only one major fail  this  the hands of robot arms gets easly broken	positive
guys thanks for all your great comments nikola bathory on jul 22 2008 0657 pm said it offers very good playability and this ladder is so long you can have so much fun with it yes the extended length of the ladder provides great playability klausdieter on jul 25 2008 0301 am said i like it much more than the new one from 2007 since its not that big and juniorized thanks kd i owned the 2007 fire engine as well as this set was not restored back then and i needed a fire engine very badly i managed to restored it somehow and i compared it with the 2007 the older design is still the best osakana on jul 25 2008 0403 am said great set i found only one major fail  this  the hands of robot arms gets easly broken yes this is an interesting finding i remembered when i was a child that robot arms always come out of its own when i fiddle with it i was so annoyed by it and i just kept it there whenever i deployed it for rescue missions grevious on jul 26 2008 0200 am said however i honestly wouldnt consider it the best firetruck ever i actually like the one from 2005 even better  becasue like most of the city vehicles it adds the needed bulk big engines like fire trucks need many of the older kits while awesome were honestly a little too skinny imo grevious i appericate your honest comments and given me your insight towards this set and state a comparison as well i agreed with you that fire engines need to be big and sturdy on the other hand it can be nice to have the fire engine to look slim as well to cut through the traffic easily i am not against with the newer sets it just that part of the reasons which reflected in the review had fufill the basic key factors of a typical fire engine in addition it was my alltime favourite under the firefighting theme	positive
quote i am not against with the newer sets it just that part of the reasons which reflected in the review had fufill the basic key factors of a typical fire engine in addition it was my alltime favourite under the firefighting theme yes i agree this set is wonderful even today and is one of the best fire kits ever release and actually realistic scale is not really a necessity in lego  its just my personal taste for example ive never liked the tiny planes in the old airports that much but i can see why a lot of people like them better than the new ones edited by grevious 28 july 2008  0317 pm	neutral
one of my all time favourite i still love it even after all these years though it did always seem a bit out of place as when i was a child i’d never seen a similar looking fire appliance in the uk	positive

this sounds very similar to the first one im glad im saving this one till later in my purchasing cycle all the sw walkers have a skeletal fram with almost nothing inside its very disappointing but i guess filling them in would up the piece count considerably does this beast have any good handholds for picking it up i seem to recall a handle or something coming out of the top in the prerelease pics	negative
thanks for the reivew could you post a few pics of the atte in all its glory kimt	neutral
just picked this set up and just took a break from building to go to football practice i have just finished building all of the legs and so far it looks like it is going to be a great set i would have like it if more clones were included but whatever i find it interesting how many clone accessories they give you i dont like it only because i cant decide what i want to use i find it interesting that at lease 2 people are missing pieces i have had multiple times where i thought i was missing pieces only to find that they were in the bag somewhere other than the fact that there is a lack of minifigures i love this set and cant wait to finish it later tonight edited by swman 04 august 2008  0833 pm	positive
i just got this set sunday and its so huge that i cant put it anywhere it is pretty sturdy and heavy thats where the handle comes in im pissed that you only get 2 clones rex has to fight on the ground while you need more clones to man the gunscockpit the legs were the most annoying and time consuming part of the build and yea i agree that if tlg had made numbered bags it would have taken only 2 hours rather than 4 edited by ih master 13uilder17 14 october 2008  1138 pm	negative
i bought this a few weeks ago and absolutely loved making it its amazing how the paneling comes together to make such a tight fit but can easily open up the legs could have been a bit more poseable and the guns dont launch easily unless you push hard and fast id like the firing mechanism to launch more smoothly but it looks absolutely amazing about price it was ¥13000 where i am but im used to lego being expensive in japan so it was good value	positive
funny minifig actions there i do love the atte a definite buy for walker fans	positive

7676 republic attack gunship number of pieces 1034 number of minifigs 5 price 11999 usd brickset hey everyone i just got the rgs yesterday at tru after i came home from camp i saw all of the topics that i missed and noticed a minireview and a review with one pic so i thought id make a huge shiny new review that has lots of pictures and all of the requirements of kimts index note i did not apply any stickers to it as a personal liking so lets start by looking at the box a shiny clean and futuristic box quite different from the other star wars box designs before this there was so much clone wars merchandise with this font and design in the huge display at the front of my local toys r us store and not just lego it so beautiful with the white and sky blue anyways for some reason the boxes of the new clone wars sets seemed more shiny than usual maybe its because they were just shipped but once you pick up the boxes they will feel really good in your hands despite the fact that only about half of the space in the boxes are used the back of the box the back shows all of the main features of the set plus pictures of the three other clone wars sets meant to be released alongside this one although i did spot the twilight and homing spider droid which were supposed to be released in september or october so on to the gunship built straight from the bags it took me about 4 12 hours with breaks it has an overall great design but somewhat fragile especially when building it the cockpits always fall apart when opened as well as the bubbles on the wings which i will get into more later the color scheme is very well done you can always find the piece youre looking for thanks to the color diversity red dark red lime green ooh blue black tan light bley dark grey yellow and white also split down the middle vertically the ship is almost all symmetrical front side now lets start with the many features that this set is hiding the front has lots of lime green a rare color but more importantly a rotating gun is found on each side they rotate in a pretty wide range although fragile cockpits there are two main cockpits right next to each other not very detailed and are the same and for some reason the whole cockpit element flips up to reveal nothing just the skeleton of the ship probe droid storage above the cockpit lies a plate that can be flipped up to reveal a storage area that holds two of these probe droids at least thats what i think they are hull in this pic two features are hidden mobile command center the first of the two is a mobile command center but essentially just a hover chair it is found by flipping up the two panels on either side of the hull bacta tank the second is the bacta tank found by just sliding it out of the storage area behind the mcc one half of the tank opens so a minifigure can go inside and heal hisher wounds obtained in battle cargo hold now this is probably the main feature for this set the two sliding doors two on each side slide open thanks to a clever technic mechanism not much in here just a gun holder and a place where the passengers wait to be dropped off in battle speeder bike i guess you guys saw it the speeder bike it is found by opening the rear flap the bike is very cleverly designed by using a brown trike body its only a few centimeters shorter than the bike found in the clone battle pack rear gun just a gun similar to the front ones engines huge engines or are they cannons that are really fun to build they really give that cartoon feel to this set missiles in between the engines are two sets of four flickfire missiles bubble cockpits there is one bubble cockpit on each wing that supposedly control the turrets at the front very fragile storage containers two storage containers on each side hold the clone accessories but i wouldnt recommend putting them in there because the antennae can fall out or you might forget about them sticker sheet the dreaded sticker sheet dss has all of the stickers you need for this set unfortunately mine was crunched up i dont like stickers much anyways but i might still apply some note the republic symbol stickers why couldnt tlg just use that printed piece from a few years back also you get to choose between a birdrat thing or a sleeping twielk as your hull decal what theyre for i dont know looks like the movie or show will explain it though minifigs finally the five minifigs of this set they are all great figs including commander cody amazing especially with the gear the orange is nice but i thought he was yellow clone trooper again amazing the gear is great and the new helmet and torso are great all of the clones in the clone wars line have the same heads also you can see the flesh beneath the helmet asaaj ventress not so happy about this one the torso and dark blue legs are cool but the dress is pretty ugly the head is alright but could do without the cartoony face yeah i know its from a cartoon also has purple markings on back of head obiwan kenobi pretty cool besides the face cool hair and torso though plo koon beautiful the true gem of this set in my opinion the head is the same material as kit fistos and the tosro is awesome good for making a custom kiadi mundi well thats about it here is the final verdict build 810 very fun and easy should take the seasoned builder about 4 hours somewhat fragile playability 9510 lots of fun features although some can break easily swooshability 310 i wouldnt recommend flying it around much as you can barely pick it up safely but with two hands gripping the bottom firmly it can be moved around but not spun or swooshed etc minifigs 810 all very great figs especially plo koon but could have included more clone troopers design 7510 some excellent ideas included in here although some spots are very fragile price 710 should have been only 100 usd if not for the new molds plus at tru it was 130 usd overall score 8510 a great set to have for your star wars clone wars collection with some flaws save up for this one so how did you like my review your feedback is much appreciated jimbutcher out edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0306 am

i got this set in the spring during my buy every new castle set availableseason granted i couldnt afford all of them but i do have most of them now anyway i love the action elements to this set and the siege tower really does look wicked id like to attach the crownie tower to the kings castle to see how it fits but i unfortunately dont own that set yet i also love the turning head of the soldier and ive used it in my princess questcomic as well along with the turning head of the princess the troll leader brings good variety to the army of trolls but they still could use another face type and more torso options its a nice review in any case although the set pretty much speaks for itself	positive

time for my first review 7673 magnaguard starfighter peices 431  of figs 2 price 4499 usd the box pretty decent size box for the price magnaguards the normal box stuff front of the ship back open cockpit back of the box contents dss dreaded sticker sheet first manual page because its super important not to build on carpet  fig build the magna guard head imo its beautiful  the purple cone cape box the capes just one the magnaguard back the parts nicely sorted the new windshield piece beautiful the first step seccond step more steps of the main body the wing assembly sorry for the blur attached opposite wing both attached rear engine build the staffs i have mine set up differently than in the instructions i put one cone over the hump on one end of the staff and the other in the original spot then to load them onto the fighter all you do is push the original placed cone down and put it right in this way the staff looks better and it works the same see it slides right in skeletal parts of sides attached close up bottom both wings attached hidden missle launcher raised up another shot staffs attached complete side panel side pods complete swooshable finished time to complete 2hrs okay overall rating time price 910 could have been 4000 usd but due to new molds this is understandable parts 910 could have hade more dark red but thats imo plus i love dark red build time 810 i took my time on this and enjoyed the techniques the designers intricated also taking pics added to the time quite a bit playability 710 the main playability functions are the missle launchers in the back and the sliding cockpit my only gripe with these is they dont set right with the other slopes on the top also the inside of the cockpit is easily modded for regular size minifigs just pop a handlebar piece in the already provided arm in the cockpit and bam your favorite figs can have a ride it also helps keep the magnaguards in place if they hold it minifigs 1010 imo the new molds are great the only downfall is the right arm on both is less moveable due to the hard plastic turbanthing connected to the head swooshability 910 the starfighter is pretty sleek and very swooshable design 910 the most important aspect and this ones a winner its only a nine because it needs to have smoother edges in a few spots but they are easily modable overall score 87 i think its an awesome set very satisfying 2008 sw on dsr dsr edited by kimt 04 august 2008  1149 am indexed	positive

hmm a tougie i really like the world city one yet the dino one is a better deal ill vote for the dino because i regretably dont even have the world city one	positive
 that was a weird race anyway i love the look of both sets but ill have to go for the dino attack quad for a couple of reasons it is postapoc which i love features tan and dark red colours which are far more useful than yellow you get more bang for your buck with the dino set you get a little dino sure you can hate it but better than not having one right and the fig has much more useful pieces and a better face thanks for the face off thebrickster batbrick away	positive
its definately the street sprinter for me there are many reasons for that most of which have been mentioned by others already i hate yellow its the most useless color but i love tan and dark red its bigger and more detailed than the coast guard one plus i think there is a hinge in the back of it so there is apparently some more playability to it as well i love the postapoc style fig its detailed and simply looks cool also while the digger fig has quite an individual look to it the coast guard driver has the generic hero head and coast guard uniform its an overal better deal especially if you count the ludp which gives the set a whole lot more playability no matter how u the ldp may be tan  postapoc figs on	positive
that was an intresting race and i was split between the two until i saw whitefangs reply and the fact you can use the sprinter as a militery thingwhich you could do for both but sprinter just pulls it off better and i like the radar on the back of it so ill have to go with the street sprinter thanks for the nice topic brickster	positive
ive got to go with the town one since you have to stand on the dino one steve	positive
i vote for the dino quadbike definately i wish i had that but ill have to make do with the much less violent european version dino 2010 not attack heres a comaprison european version usa etc version theres a subtle difference but i prefer the us one as for the coast guard quad i think its ok but not as good as the new one	positive
i like the coast guard one but dinos eat coast guard people so dinos ftw and i think the dino bike would fit in with my collection pretty well	positive
i like the dino thingy because of the pieces and the dino is a lot of fun on its own i know thats akward	positive
dino attack for me you just cant say no to a huge bazooka though the tan and dark red works for me too	positive
dino attack quad for me no this isnt because i own it and not the other one but because i think just about everything is better in it  the design is better the colors are cooler and it has a better figure i dont like the figure in the coast guard quad at all  but since it was from world city im not suprised i also kinda like the dino actually its flexible and fits in with the previous dinos a lot better than the cruddy bigger ones with bright red yellow and green highlights	positive
price 569 kr minifigs 2 pieces 592 stickers 9 my sticker sheet wasn’t curled up overview before i start i will apologize for the bad quality of the pictures it is getting dark here right now so some of the pictures are a bit dark 1 minifigs the set comes with two of the new clone wars clone troopers which in my opinion are pretty cool it also comes with two short blasters and a bag of clone accessories figs with helmets figs without helmets 2 the tank this thing is huge 25cm long and 22cm wide and far oversized in my opinion but looks great nonetheless i very much like the white and dark red color scheme mixed with a bit of lime green even though there is no lime green bricks   left side right side back side both of the wings contain a hidden compartment to store the blasters and a part that rotates to reveal three flickfire missiles the front opens up as well to reveal the engine the side guns and the gun on the top rotate inside the cockpit is space for two figs one seated in front of two computer screens and one placed in a moveable seat which moves up and down allowing the fig to pop up the top hatch and staying hidden while the hatch is closed this function is triggered by opening the backdoor hidden compartment and missiles engine top hatch openclosed interior 3 rating build 910 not much to say here minifigs 710 an extra fig or two would have been great eventually a jedi or a commando design 810 this only looses a couple of points for being oversized but it’s a great looking model parts 1010 at 592 parts this is one of the cw sets with the best partsprice ratio price 810 sure this thing is great but i think its overpriced at 569 kr approx 120 when build it feels more like a 450 kr set final verdict 910 despite some flaws this thing is definitely recommended and it looks great on your shelf too 	positive
i know it would really go well with the rgs but it is not enough for £50 ill wait for the sales at christmas	negative

finally a review of this thanks 120 bucks this tank looks tiny and though its amazingly detailed it should have been smaller and only 4050 bucks at most it just doesnt play that big a part man good pieces and mechanisms but no ones going to both buying a 120 buck tank no offence not unless it its the atte	negative

thanks for the review christian i was hoping for one soon  this set really looks good but as you said rather big the figs are good and i agree that kiadi mundi should be included i like the hidden compartments for the blasters and missiles and the cockpit is really cool considering it seats two i thought only one i will surely pick this up sometime	positive

this and the atte and the spider tank and maybe the droid gunship are the few clone wars sets ill buy i loved playing as this tank in the clone wars video game even better with cheat codes for extra missile spam  so this is a must get	positive
thanks for posting the review i’ve been wondering about this set to me it does feel a bit fig light for £50 i’d expect maybe one or two more clones i’m not to sure about the oversized issue it seems to me it’s better to have something a bit to large and have a better level or features than something smaller will less	negative
this set costs a s100 in singaporei went to hng kong too see lego and the shops there are more expensive by a few dollarshoweveri went to australia before and everything there is the same price but when there is a sale it becomes very cheapanyway thanks for the reviewi was wondering about the details of this setthe clones faces look a lot like anakins facewhy is that soi thought it is supposed to look like jangos	neutral

4478 geonosian fighter review parts169 figs4 price1500 i think here is a review of the amazing geonosian fighter set it was my first ever star wars lego set here gos 1 manual not much here although its an old style manual cover random shot back 2 general set and minifigs a pic of the entire set it has 2 reddish tan battle droids geo pilot geo soldier geo star fighter and geo turret the 4 figs the droids come with backpacks geo soldier i prefer this gun give him a cane to become poggle the lesser the geo leader detailed legs are always nice the bodies are a little fat for geonosians i guess but nice printing on them the head the wings 1 2 3 voila all done 3 the star fighter it has a landing gear type thing the detail on those plates the pilot in the cockpit cockpit with canopy 1 of 2 ball joint things this is the engine 2nd ball joint which is the front gun 4 the turret the turret by itself turret with the soldier a printed round plate 5 overall build 710 a little repetitive but enjoyable minifigs 910 4 thats pretty good for a set this size design 610 the fighter dosent really look right nor does the turret but they are both strong parts 810 lots of interesting parts and comes with two of the ball joint things as well the minifig parts being good price 1010 cheap for the uk considering the amount of minifigs and parts playability 510 not much but you can have mini battles with the turret and starfighter overall 810 i gave it 8 because of the design which was not accurate and the low number of parts thanks for reading and hope you liked it as much as i did  edited by kimt 04 august 2008  1142 am indexed	positive
good review i would get this set but sadly they dont have it anymore i wish they did to get those sweet figs the battle droid colors are sweet the only set with geonosians	neutral
i wish they made more sets with those colored droids as well we should have got them with the hailfire droid and dwarf spider set i think i also just noticed look the ball turret on the manual theres no markings on it	neutral
thanks for the review i love these affordable little sets not so affordable now because of the cool figs but im going to have a look on ebay and bricklink right now just in case an army of tan red droids would look great maybe well see some if geonosia appears in the new seires somehow unlikely since the confederacy was defeated at the battle of geonosis i wish i could have bought this set when it came out but id just left university so i was super skint and had to miss all the epii sets now they all cost loads even in used condition at least now there has been a redesign of the gunship and atte from the clone wars series that i can buy	neutral

and now for something completely different tiny turbos belonging to the racers line when i saw 8147 bullet run on sh for half the price i couldn´t resist buying it we had a lot of fun celebrating a bagbuild at our event using the 8150 zx turbo of that theme so i knew what would expect me with this extended set price normal 4999€ now 2499€ well i paid 3499€ in a lego store but that´s another story bricks 796 minifigs  hey this is tiny turbos stupid stickers don´t ask or read further the open box reveals seven polybags some with more smaller polybags inside the instruction booklet 2 ramps and the sticker sheet of course i put all of the bags on the table and not on the floor hey tlc didn´t print this on the first page of the building instructions and you won´t see any piece callouts as well on the other hand this is not adifficult build so why show them still there is an inventory list of all bricks at the end of the instructions note the giant sticker sheet we all now the dss but that is a new kind of extra super large sticker sheet it holds 82 stickers more to that later on the build is quite basic the only nonconventional parts of the build were the two slammers and the most annoying part was fiddling the rubber band of the holder without destroying it bag 1 easy beginning building the lime car the limo and the two slammers nothing exciting about the lime car but the limo was neat it´s an 18 studs long car the normal racers are abot 10 studs long nice way to put the horns on the back the slammers mmmmh nice invention if they would actually do something they are supposed to give the tubros a kick in the butt to speed them up but the result is a 80 cm long run and that´s it i had expected more acceleration from the slammers but it´s also fun to play with the cars without slamming them bag 2 convoy time the tow truck and the fuel truck the tow truck is a great idea and a good addition to the set the cars are supposed to crash  how do they get back home well here´s the answer quite american layout of the truck and it´s very well done horns 5 flashing lights and a right color choice you can move the arm up and down and pull out the hook note the metallic silver antennae the fuel tank has got a secret function it may break on the middle of the trailer therefore it has a hinge build in the bottom city fire mayhem and there´s no fire engine bag 3 long longer how long can a tiny truck be the pipe truck an unexpected buggy and the red racer 36 studs long the pipe truck breaks every convention the cabin is almost the same like the tow truck and the fuel truck and that is the good part of it the trailer has to carry pipes and is functional as well as it can commute sidewarts it looks quite unrealistic as well and you cannot drive this beast on tiny roads good for another crash but there are more cars in this bag now this was a surprise a buggy this is the only 6wide car but just because the wheels are large monster truck madness i don´t care for those cars personally a disappointment i would have preferred another racer  for variety though did i say another racer here we are the red devil great looking a real fast shape and red the best racer in this set vrooommm this is the most played with car of the set not only from me  as you may have noticed i didn´t put any stickers so far i don´t like stickers especially when placed over two or more bricks and here you are supposed to do it several times of course the cars look better with stickers on but they are also great without stickers only the fuel truck looks boring without my sons didn´t know there were supposed to be stickers and they didn´t ask for them so everything is allright here´s a closeup of the sticker sheet did i already mention it was 82 stickers  the only exception i made using sticker was for bag 4 bag 4 you go here you pay the highway toll booth the only immobile part of the set but great to brake though the barriers that is fun i only put on stickers on 2x2 plates where i had the idea to use those plates further on on different other mocs this looks a bit boring without the other stickers i admit but still no cut off to the playability there are also two ramps belonging to the set these only make sense if you are able to speed up the racers with the slammers and hit the ramps correctly i had problems with that so they are on the shelves now could be a lot fun making a contest though like this picture of the inventories frontpage all cars put together the usual leftovers all in all this is a great set to call ones own i did not regret buying it especially when it was 50 off even normal price would not have been too much build great for smaller children boring to afols 510 special brickscolors none all basics 310 design i love the tiny turbos´ size and design 910 playability 1 because of the slammers another 1 because no minifigscale but that is not the intention of the set still 910 pricepiece ratio dang it´s not on sale any more but if you hurry you could still grab one in the lego stores 1010 all in all 8510 and a clear recommendation it was and still is a set to play with your children the size fits perfectly to matchbox cars and that was exactly what my younger son did can you find all of the cars included in the set ps after buying this set i won an ebay auction with another tiny turbos set  8135 bridge chase this is even more fun i will soon care for a review with some never seen phototricks as well stay tuned edited by whitefang 23 may 2009  0702 pm indexed	neutral
tiny turbos are good for parts but im not so keen on them as they have no minifig drivers so i wasnt sure about this set but your review has made me like them more i probably wont buy the set but i appreciate it more thanks for the review	positive
kimt on aug 3 2008 0106 pm said thanks for the review ill definately get this set sooner or later you better hurry they are not at sh any longer quote a fine set carwise dump the slammers and buildings into the spare bag and keep the cars that´s exactly what i did the slammers are already seperated to our color boxes	positive
4500 rebel snow speeder review parts 214 figs 3 price £2000 edit new box pics added sorry theyre a bit blurry because of the light i took them in this is the original trilogy edition version of this set but there arent any differences to the normal one 1 manual  box the front of the ote box the minifgs on the box top the back of the box with some alternate models and overview of some of the functions the manual cover you can see it is the ote version of the set random shot 1 of 2 posters in the instructions the second poster 2 general set and minifigs the built set contents the three figs with the included weapons how i like to customize the pilots helmets luke from 4500 and luke from 10178 motorized atat the three helmets included with the set 3 turret heres the turret with the rebel gunner standing next to it the controls for the turret  the turret can rotate and tilt two fire at those pesky atat walkers i put a spider web sort of radar dish thing on like on the original 7130 to make it look more like the one from tesb 4 the speeder a front view of the speeder the pilot controls with a atat print the seats for the pilot and rear gunner the rear gunners tow cable a detailed printed plate next to the engines printed plates under the airbrake things more printed parts there is no dss with this set got tie up those walkers we might need some more tow cable  5 overall build 710 pretty symmetrical build but its fun minifigs 810 3 figs in a £20 set is pretty good i think design 910 very strong and close to minifig scale the turret could have some work though parts 810 lots of variety and includes some interesting ones such as the cockpit and rear air vent price 710 3 figs and 214 parts not to bad i guess playability 610 could be better if it came with a snow trooper overall 810 the set comes with 3 figs that only come with more expensive sets also it has a variety of different parts as well as the build being enjoyable edited by skipper 24 04 august 2008  0310 pm indexed	neutral

7255 general greivous wheel bike chase review parts 111 figs 2 price £1000 the first set to include gg 1 general set and minifigs not manual because i dont have it the contents of the box after being built both minifigs the set includes 5 lightsabers my own design gg ggs cape on the outside ggs cape on the inside 2 the wheel bike front view standing on legs side view gg cant hold the controls because of his arms roller mode the legs are a bit to chunky so to roll it has to be tilted forward 3 boga the lizard grey tip to the tail the front back and saddle split in to three sections 4 overall build 410 there isnt really much to build minifigs 910 it comes with gg with the special cape and obiwan in rots gear which is hard to find i think design 510 not really to scale but otherwise okay apart from boga which just looks like any old dinosaur also the controls on the wheel bike arent really right parts 610 comes with some dark green bricks and lots of rods  the guns on the wheel bike the boga feet are also nice price 810 £10 for 2 figs isnt bad it could have a few more parts though playability 1010 you can easily recreate the movie scenes with this set overall 710 it would be better if the bike and boga were more to scale and more accurate as well as the set having more parts	neutral

i had this set £15 rrp actually  and agree mostly with your review although on the wheel bike itself two legs can be placed at the front end and two at the back to enable it to roll properly boga is very juniorised and the set itself is very simple and contains many large pieces the minifigures are good though i traded my gg however  just to offer my personal thoughts build 510 minifigs 1010 parts 310 price 710 playability 1010 overall 710  not an average tk	neutral

thanks again skipper for producing yet another review to go into the index i like this slave1 but sadly i must admit that i like the really old version better boba fetts slave1 that is even though is grossly undersized i think its better than this one belonging to his father jango kimt	neutral
i have all three of the slave i ships and i agree with kimtalthough it is a very small compact ship the first slave i boba fett is still the sturdiest the newest slave i boba fett is not bad and is of much better construction than this slave i from jango fett even though i like the size and scale of the jango slave i and the newest boba fett slave iwhen you pick that very first one up it had the feeling ofyou can throw me against the wall drop me off the roof of your house or let 4 two year olds play with meim not gonna break at least thatss my opinion good review	positive

i never got the original boba fetts slave 1 i wish they would make one to scale with the minifigures i would be so cool i am also putting up a review of the clone turbo tank probably tomorrow it is a different variation to the one in the index edited by skipper 24 03 august 2008  0712 pm	neutral
personally i hated that set i fell apart way to easily and was just not built well	negative
thanks for the review it looks like an interesting set even if not as good as bobas skipper 24 on aug 3 2008 0811 pm said i never got the original boba fetts slave 1 i wish they would make one to scale with the minifigures i would be so cool you mean it would be so cool i agree that it would be if they made a large minifig scale version like with the ucs millenium falcon i would probably try to buy that edited by shoc 03 august 2008  0831 pm	neutral
very good review theres only one thing you did wrong quote nameskipper 24 post337180 dateaug 3 2008 0846 amthe controls i got this set for a very low price as well and for that its a very nice parts pack with 2 neat exclusive figs	neutral
nice review i will say i like the latest slave i the best as it is longer than jangos i havent seen the first one so i cant really comment	neutral
that was indeed a set that never appealed to me its build was just plain wrong and awful i only bought it because i found it on clearance at around 15€ and they had 4 of them if i had known better then id have bought all 4 seeing how much that jango fett minifig is worth now  but i ended up heavily modifying it in its propoions and now it looks ok next to the new slave one which is the best one of its 3 incarnations i think	negative
i got the original jsf for christmas which i might buy and review wonderful set the obi in this one is really awesome and its really just a great ship sticker free probably my favourite id fly it if any ship from star wars maybe i should get it and the slave i from episode ii after all i like jango despite having a crap story	positive
very good review i have he newest slave i and i like it more than this one dsr	neutral
okay i have fixed that pic thanks oky wan i have modified this but then yesterday i built it back to its original state to review it	neutral
yep those decals are suffering i am going to apply some new ones now with proper paper	neutral
good review i always wanted to know how it was different to the boba fett slave i i would probably only get this though for jango fett the newer one looks sturdier and proportioned better imo	neutral
a very nicely done review i remember getting this slave i  it was my first large star wars set	positive
outback desert racer gday mates today from the legolands desert down under ill be sharing an image review of outback set 6550 desert racer set  6550 theme outback year released 1997 piece count 48 minifigs 1 list price 4 usd starting with an image of the box and the back side with three alternate models instructions and decals the pieces a side view of the vehicle diagonal view one minifig and the complete set pros  price is under 5 4 usd retail  good impulse set  goes well with other outback sets  combination of yellow and green pieces  working doors and liftable top for playability cons  stickers on doors hood and 1x4 tile no printed pieces  no accessories a wrench gas can and other extras would have added to the set  no extra tire for blow outs summary i picked this set up new a number of years ago as a true impulse buy after buying one of the larger outback sets amazon crossing or outback airstrip its a neat little addition to the theme with its working doors and playability factor although i only built it once before today i would buy again if i had the opportunity hooroo for now some good aussie music to leave you with down under	positive
this set looks liek a good buy for 4 wish it was still around but like you said it needs accessories	positive
i remember having this set actually i even still have it at least the pars are somewhere  when i was a child and i used it for making races as it is there for all these many reviews let me think again at that i also planned to make some reviews for the town section i got your message thebrickster dont worry i got a lot to do at the moment but i should find some time this upcoming week	neutral
manta on aug 3 2008 1033 am said wish it was still around even though little sets 10 like the new coast guard 4wd  jet and the quad are great little city sets lego seems to be returning to good quality small sets with their latest city lineup metalandi on aug 3 2008 1046 am said i remember having this set actually i even still have it at least the pars are somewhere  when i was a child and i used it for making races as it is there for you should look for them and resurrect it it really feels good after youve found all the pieces and put a set back together again as it was when you first bought it	positive
this little set really makes my point small playable inspiration to build the set into a few other models great set i wish i had it my town is going to need more vehicles i really miss main model instructions with alternate build ideas	neutral
i can prodly say i own this little bugger its not much but it is a nice addition to the series they are also easy to build so you can get a rally going quite fast stauder	neutral
nein you rejected lul luls are awesome thanks for the review i like the set a lot mace is only featured here great fig of him too i like the grey jedi robes torso cody is great as with the other figs the tanks probably a second favourite next to the mighty atat of course	positive
i hate how the original release had the lightup windu which was really lame and one less clone trooper i bought it when it first came out so missed out on a good windu and another clone trooper	neutral
thanks for the review ill index it later ive added a poll so that members can vote their opinion and refrain from useless comments like awesome this has been done to all reviews in the sw review index keep up the good work this is one of my favourite sets  i have both versions and as it is known the only difference is the minifigs i really like the tank it has great playability and if it had wings id definately swoosh it kimt	neutral
nice review again skipper i passed on this one because of the price but its a nice set good for you for getting the newer version with nonlul mace and an extra clone that purple blade sure is a beauty the tank itself is alright just an atat on wheels in my opinion the turret is great though and so is the speeder bike i didnt realize that the jet pack had two nailguns harpoon guns on it i thought that the nailgun was a new piece but the jetpack is very cool	positive
the kid on aug 4 2008 0820 am said i got the original version of this set with the luls mace windu figure when tlc released the nonluls version i managed to swap  they sent me the new version and a clone trooper iirc and i mailed them back the old version this was a great set the suspension worked great and it rolled magnificently nice review with good photos but again your price is a little off £6999 is the rrp unless the price you paid was £80 tk that was a great idea i never even thought to send it back and get the new one with the other clone and the non lul windu	positive
thanks for the review kimt i gave this above average i believe i had this one but it was so long ago im still a bit freaked out by the yellow ones when i emerged from my dark ages i kept thinking gee i miss the people packs but now that i have over 500 minifigures i dont feel that way anymore even so i wish they would rerelease some of the classic old ones	neutral
i voted above average as well but back in 1983 i would have probably gone much lower sadly i wasnt as interested in minifigs at the time i appreciated the ones i had but i really just wanted ships or bases and would have gladly passed this by for something with one or two figures and a small moon rover i skipped all of the classic minifig sets space castle and town it was only upon coming out of my dark ages that i went minifig crazy for me this is above average because of the accessories without them its an average set with a small brick built droid or a rover it would be outstanding that said id buy at least 10 copies now though id rather have a 4 figure set with one of each colour including blue i never had blue back then i think castle lured me away thanks for an interesting review it gives me a chance to further explore why i changed from shipset to minifig fan and bore all of eb with it	neutral
an ancient set revived from kimts collection just take a look at the box art this is one classic space minifig pack which deserve high rating and i gave it above average i never had any of these classic space figs before if tlg could ever released this again i am pretty sure i will grab multiple packs without a glimpse you need to build your space agentsastronauts with a little bit of accessories added to explore the unknown space i love this pack very much thanks for sharing	positive
pretty nice set but the newer minifig packs had greater variety in both the figures and equipment my favorite one among all of them is 6704 which is also the only instance of both blacktrons appearing in one set quote i wonder why this set had no blue or black astronauts whatever the case i always loved the small minifig sets that lego released as i could never get enough astronauts my favorite was the set of futuron astronauts i think the blue and black guys hadnt yet been released at the time of this set	positive
kdog on aug 5 2008 0445 am said why would the yellow astronauts freak you out sinner is it because they look nekkid  you bet but this set is still the most freaky	negative
he does have a cape a cap and a bandana around his head thats not the same as being bare as when born edit oh yeah hes also got red gloves on as well btw what does this have to do with the 6701 space minifigures review	neutral
kdog on aug 6 2008 1027 pm said wearing a cape hat and bandanna and nothing else makes it creepier gasp i second that both wait does that make it quadrophic 	negative
maiq the liar on aug 6 2008 0701 pm said its timmy and a nudist with the trains logo tatooed to his chest the train logo tattoo kinda makes him look like some kind of insane train worshiping cultist hail to train lego master of moving by lighting	neutral
im still reviewing it the internet broke half way through it	neutral
simonjedi on aug 4 2008 0557 pm said im still reviewing it the internet broke half way through it the internet broke thats bad news to all did you push this i am eagerly awaiting the rest kimt	neutral
thanks for the review simonjedi this just reaffirms that the v19 is my highest priority this fall behind the rgs of course is that new printed piece a 2 x 2 tile it looks like an excellent detail part for mocing those black pieces used on the landing gear look very bioniclelike if they havent been used before id suspect they will be not that im a bionicle expert or anything it is a shame that this set only includes one clone that seems to be the only drawback to the set everything else looks spot on	positive
first thanks simonjedi for a great review im interested in what you think of the hydrolics i could spend hours just deploying and undeploying the wings and landing gear im a little worried the very first batch of the hydrolic piece for umm i think it was the offroad 4x4 technic set was very fragile and broke after a few uses these seem to be holding up but im anxious to see if they hold up after 100200 uses quote namewalter kovacs dateaug 4 2008 1147 am post337841 those black pieces used on the landing gear look very bioniclelike if they havent been used before id suspect they will be not that im a bionicle expert or anything quote right you are they are bionicle bohrok head pieces so pretty old in bionicle terms and fairly useless in my opinion but they do make interesting looking landing gear as i deploy and redeploy the wings and landing gear hopefully well get a pilot in the battle pack to help mitigate the fact we only get one here tohst	positive
thanks for the review ive added it to the index and added a poll in which members can vote their opinion on this set i think this is a very good set i like the colours and the very playable feature that allows the wings to lock in attack formation now all i need is to buy this baby edit i gave it an above average rating since its well designed looks sturdy and fits the sw theme sets perfectly	positive
nice review simon jedi the v19 has been one of my favourite ships since the release of cwa and this is one of the sets ive been considering most about buying its great to see tlgs treatment of it it looks like no expense was spared making it as aesthetically and functionally accurate as possible  though i think the cockpit windshield could maybe have been slightly bigger but thats just me im sure it looks pretty big compared to other starfighters too did it take a long time to build	positive
great review simonjedi  i really like that you included lots of photos of your build i put together my v19 torrent last night and i was surprised by how heavy the completed ship is it has some real heft once its finished wow it is a really cool ship i was disappointed that the central wing doesnt really lock into place once it flips down it just kind of droops there so i attached a technic pin to the locking arm so it could plug into the 2x4 brick thats on the underside of the starfighter this brick can be seen in your photo of the bottom of the ship overall the build is one of the more confusing that ive seen i had to dismantle and rebuild the first engine after i realized id left out a piece and i kept thinking of the poor 7yearold that gets this set as hisher very first lego set ever	negative
the v19 was my first tcw set i buyed it when i was visiting my father i just wanted to build it there and i do so but how do you will get sthbig like this with in the train so i had to destroy him when i was still home again i had to build it 3 times because the mechanic dont works i only can say that the v19 is one of the best tcw sets thanks to you for the review simonjedi  i just wanted to make one in german but now i neednt to make it	positive
pedro on aug 5 2008 1229 pm said it looks pretty big compared to other starfighters too did it take a long time to build it took me 3 and a bit hours to build it although i had some problems with the technic and i had to take pictures during the build	neutral
thanks for this excellent review simonjedi  this looks like an awesome set and this is the set i am most looking foward just as well as the separatist spider droid 7681 	positive
the ability for it to fold in and out of attack position has wowed me this is my top priority now thanks for making up my mind	positive
hydraulic wings i am very impressed and am now considering getting this set purely because of this funciton i am just curious as to know why are there sand green parts on the bottom of the v19 is it visible when the model is completed i am also pleased to see tlc giving us a printed cockpit computer this time around	positive

skipper 24 on oct 11 2008 0810 am said in addition to my last comment am i correct in saying that the left over yellow technic part was merely to hold parts together while building yes i believe that the yellow technic is only used for the building however i didnt find it neccessary what a strange step	negative
i built mine today as soon as i tried to put it in attack position the thingy rotates the wrong way and it falls apart what a waste of 55	negative
rayman on nov 29 2008 1016 pm said yes i believe that the yellow technic is only used for the building however i didnt find it neccessary what a strange step its to hold the wing connectors in the the same place while the wing is being attached	neutral
actually we should care that theres only one fig in it since its kind of expensive though thats my opinion  but the ship is really awesome  its too bad theres not a battlepack that includes clone pilots edited by bricklanta 30 november 2008  0615 am	neutral
daxflame680 on nov 30 2008 0103 am said i built mine today as soon as i tried to put it in attack position the thingy rotates the wrong way and it falls apart what a waste of 55 i suggest you to check again if you put the technic gear in the correct way cause if not than maybe that the problem  also i dont think it is a waste in my opinion the ship is very well designed and is actually pretty strong or at least mine  and the pilot minifig is fantastic even if there is just one of them edited by darkrebellion 30 november 2008  0317 am	positive
kimt on nov 30 2008 1001 am said all you need to do is build it correctly yes yes i do im just kind of lazy it just didnt work out for me is all	neutral
i love this set and i gave it outstanding i might note though that the cylinder is just there as a dampener when disenegaged the wing function still works just not as smoothly interestingly though the cylinder is an old piece i have a few others its just that this is the first time its been used without a spring i had no problems assembling this set	positive
having just bought myself a copy of the wonderful metroliner 4558 i felt like doing a review before we start id like to thank greenhair for selling me one of his metroliners for a mere 80 euros granted the motor trainstation and tracks werent included but i did get an extra railcar instead   please note that i have included the fourth wagon in the final pic but that the official set includes just three wagons the metroliner was released in 1992 and was extremely popular amongst lego fans the set a picture of the box showing the set completely pic taken from peeron and one of the minifigs and the accessories as you may notice tlc was extremely generous supplying us with a grand total of 11 minifgs amongst which no less than 4 female minifigs ah the population crisis is finally over we also have three suitcases three cups and a small freight parcel and freight handling thingy normally this would include two bicycles a red and a black one a general side view of the three carriages thanks to greenhair and the brickster and heres one of the extra carriage thanks to greenhair and the brickster moving onto the front and back carriage which are externally identical please note that greenhair changed my back carriages headlights these would be yellow in the normal set all the doors in the entire set are printed pieces sorry for the bad picture quality in this one the interior of the two however is laid out a bit differently the space in the front carriage is occupied by a cockpit or whatever it is called in trains and some space to store your cable connecting the front lights with the engine i can imagine it must get quite cramped and dangerous for the minifig driver with all the cabling further back we have a quite random weird looking engine one part reminded me rather of a jet engine on a commercial airplane the engine is accessible by means of the two side cargo doors at the end of our first carriage we hit what looks like the trains restaurant two tables and no chairs the two middle carriages are identical both have a small sink nicely hidden from the intervening and impolite looks of fellow passengers the carriage further contains two tables and four seats two cargo spaces are nicely tucked away from view below the tables our final carriage has a back cockpit as well but differs from the front carriage in the central cargo area  where our train employee is hard at work earning his lego nickels  and the rear sleeping area the bed is a double one the upper one able to be flipped up for somewhat difficult access to the lower one the train station i could not take photos off since it was not included in the purchase judging from the building plans however i feel it was thrown in at the end just to add something to the set its construction is very simple consisting of a few grey plates on top of a few pillars access is provided by a plate which is connected to the platform with a few hinges there are however two lamp posts a timetable and a few chairs so if you dont like the platform you can still use these parts in a variety of other constructios to end off i took a pic of the complete set with extra wagon and a friendly surprised train driver opening the door and greeting the camera man conclusion being a 90s set the train basically builds itself the entire build cost me two hours and a half i lost quite some time simply admiring the set and was extremely straightforward with no suprises at all but i need to admit it has its charm the exterior is simply amazing the sleekness of the design the colours it matches perfectly i believe however that a width of 8 studs would be more to scale but 6 wide still looks amazing the interior is somewhat simplistic but is easily moddeable with a few extra pieces i basically bought the train as a parts pack the standard set three wagons includes no less than 8 train doors with windows 14 train windows 4 smaller longer ones and 4 freight doors the front and back of course count as unique pieces as well one feature i am displeased with are the printed doors i like printed pieces and while the bluewhitered stripe looks beautiful on the side the printed doors kind of limit mocing capabilities to carriages with a stripe on the side i considered simply removing the stripe but i found out i could just get normal grey ones from bricklink for a fair price i am very pleased with the train but since you already know my opinion feel free to tell us yours of this fabulous set edited by thebrickster 09 july 2009  0151 pm poll question was not multiple choice switched to radio group	positive
ah i wish modern trains had 11 figs but seriously why is there a civilian train stop in a cave did 1 too many people get lost playing zork edited by maiq the liar 04 august 2008  1021 pm	neutral
i remember to literally jump of joy when my grandfather offered it to me for christmas its an amazing set the train is really beautiful and it comes with 11  mfs so can somebody ask for more	positive
oh ruben you lucky so and so this set is one of the most beautful i have ever seen splendid looking build and 11 figures all the same faces like but still you get that old woman pigtail head piece which is just great i thought you meant the monorail set when you told me about this but guess i was wrong dont laugh ive been away from lego for quite some time and for 80 euros it was a real bargain from a great friend really nice review hope this sets brings you years of joy	positive
cool review i actually have two of these i got one for christmas when it was rereleased in 2003 and another one in a charity shop a few months later for €5 i love the minifigs even if they all have smileys and having two sets of them can really fill up a town	positive
its great to see someone reviewing a train this set is definately a five lego hasnt made a complete train set like this in a long time the metroliner is really a legend among classic trains the great level of playability and detailing makes it a terrific model specifically i was just noticing the details of the passenger car it has a sink  how cool is that and 11 minifigs  when was the last time lego included 11 figs in a single set a truly outstanding train set thanks for sharing images as ive always wanted to see it upclose it would be awesome if you could share some single side shots of the cars	positive
im not normally that big into trains but this set has a real coolness factor that sets it apart from most of the others the color scheme is the same one that amtrak and many local subway systems use i picked it up along with the club car expansion when they were rereleased in 2001 i have made various modifications to mine rearranging the car layouts and adding a second train motor into the rearmost car along with another set of lights so that both ends light up as you said it would be great to have an 8stud version of this so you could fit in two rows of seats side by side that might make a nice mod project at some point	positive
outstanding train set the legend of the entire train series is the metroliner this is a super 5 set the color design minifigs is just so perfect and lovely it resemble the trains which we see on our rails in our daily life i cant find any flaws on this at all the only flaw i noticed is my mistake of not able to buy this set at all in fact i had never seen this set in the shops before in my entire life thebrickster on aug 5 2008 0923 am said how cool is that and 11 minifigs  when was the last time lego included 11 figs in a single set there is another set fufil the criteria above which is also a well known legend it has 12 minifigs which is the 10159 city airport aka century skyway airport	positive
nice review i collect all metroliner i can i have 3 metroliner and when i can i buy a other  my aim  have the more big metroliner collect in france  in first time  its my favorite set	positive
ahh the good old train theme how i wish tlg would make such great trains today now that the quality of city sets has improved so much that really brings back memories even if i didnt have this one but a cargo train that came out about the same time period maybe plus a few years i dont have any trains myself at the moment mostly because im afraid i havent got enough space to put in on display with all the rails and stuff	positive
really nice train i always wished tlg would have made the passenger ir train longer and maybe used some of the nice features of this train i still love that faucet piece	positive
i also voted outstanding for the simple reason that ive owned this set for a long time but for most of the time its been an anonymous heap of bricks mixed with all the other bricks i have so about a year ago i started rebuilding it and it now sits proudly next to also rebuilt 2150 on my shelf imo its an excellent set best of the 9v passenger trains no doubt and it combines the best of the 80s trains with that of the 90s  its not some futuristic panoramaglassed lowslung train but an honest realisticlooking train that captures many of the features that passenger trains used to and in some cases still have	positive
hairy ruben on aug 5 2008 1200 am said the interior of the two however is laid out a bit differently the space in the front carriage is occupied by a cockpit or whatever it is called in trains and some space to store your cable connecting the front lights with the engine i can imagine it must get quite cramped and dangerous for the minifig driver with all the cabling further back we have a quite random weird looking engine one part reminded me rather of a jet engine on a commercial airplane the engine is accessible by means of the two side cargo doors at the end of our first carriage we hit what looks like the trains restaurant two tables and no chairs there shouldnt be so much of the light cable in the front section or cockpit most of the cable should be in the central part of the train then it is not so crowded for the engine driver i have never had a problem with the cable and the space available for it the only problem i had was that the cable had a loose contact after some time when the train went into a curve cant remember if it was a left or right curve the light went off i have now got the same problem with the cable that i put into my santa fe super chief always when the engine turns into a right curve the light goes off my dad could repair the cable for the metroliner even though he is quite skilled at repairing electronic things he found it very difficult to repair since there were no screws to open the electronic plate it annoyed him a lot so ive been asking myself if i should really bother him with a second cable with the same problem the train set itself is outstanding and thats what i voted for i only have the legend 10001 but its 99 identical to 4558 i also have club car 4547 i dont have the legend club car 10002 the reason for this is i always had the choice between one big lego set or several small ones for christmas when i was a child i always went for several small ones metroliner 4558 would have been a big train set but i really wanted a passenger car so i bought 4547 with my savings without having the metroliner i was quite happy when the metroliner was rereleased i bought it with my own money then i could finally use the club car with the train it was created for edited by legotrainfan 15 august 2008  0755 pm	neutral
i dont like the set and i do like the set the reason why i like it it looks good the reason why i hate it this train was the first train for the new 9v system and it means to me the end of the beautiful 12v series for this last reason i own this set i voted average only strange they named it metroliner in holland when we speak of a metro i need to think at short distance trains only used in big cities like rotterdam and your minifigs at pic aint right according the instruction 	neutral
panda9001100 on aug 16 2008 0737 am said only strange they named it metroliner in holland when we speak of a metro i need to think at short distance trains only used in big cities like rotterdam it was only named metroliner in the us because of the color scheme is similar to the reallife metroliner i believe in eu it was called the euroexpress and probably just passenger train wherever that would be suitable the productnumber 4558 is universal though hairy ruben you dont have a review of the doubledeckerclub car on the way do you i myself never got it and i am seriously considering buying one from bricklink plus it is moreorless an requirement for this train one of very few doubledecker cars to actually stay within the general outer dimensions of the train	neutral
my favourite favourite favourite old set its too bad i was born 2 years after its release i would have had a major interest in classic town i might actually get this one on bricklink not that itll go for a good price ill only buy if it does you see an outstanding a highly useful and wellmade set that really just stands out from its counterparts edit nevermind edited by dovchenko 16 august 2008  1025 am	positive

i never got this set i spent a long time after one christmas trying to get and failed miserably admittedly i was much younger then it has however remained one of my most sought after items but i’ve still never got around to getting one the set generally makes me rather nostalgic for a time when the trains were painted in simple liveries like that one anyway it seems an excellent set from what i’ve seen and the figure selection is amazing i hope lego produce something as good as this when the new trains are released next year	positive
i got my indy exclusive in the mail today packaging front back instructions minifigs this set comes with 1 minifig the standard indy with hat and whipno satchel the build i am really happy with the amount of frown headlight bricks that come with this set 12 in all the mudguards are cleverly built with 1 x 2 panels and 1 x 1 panel corners in dark green in the first 2 pages of the instructions there are a lot of great pieces this set would sell like mad if it were released for sale parts monkeys alone would go insane buying these up for the dark green and frown pieces the body of the car consists of black plates brackets and modified bricks with curved tops that allow the dark green mudguards to just peak out cool technique the grill looks cool using only six pieces i wish all small sets were this unique and cool heres the completed jeep it looks a little small for an actual jeep but for a brickmaster set its awesome imo some more detail shots of the set with indy in the drivers seat i hope they take brickmaster exclusives overseas because itd be awesome if everybody could get these my buddy copmike would probably love to be the first to review this set so ive dedicated my review comic to him my rating playability 810 you need to add some other sets and characters to really play with this set design 910 great techniques and inclusion of rare parts but loses a point for being an unrealistic size for a jeep price 1010 part of the brickmaster package it is a reasonable prize for an exclusive set and everything else that comes with the subscription overall 910 great but not perfect and definitely needs to be offered overseas lego would make a ton of money releasing this for sale imo as it really is a terrific small set	positive
thanks for the review hinckley i love this set i still havent renewed my bm subscription but im sure i can find this on ebay or bricklink and what an addition this would be to my army edited by vbbn 05 august 2008  0132 am	positive
outstanding set and review thanks for presenting it ive had this since it first came out but didnt think it would be that impressive so i didnt bother opening it now im tempted aside from the slight size issue i cant find anything here to gripe about except for the limited availability i want 5 i think that makes me a parts monkey eek eek youre exactly right about this selling like mad its another one of those missed opportunities for tlg sure its nice to get people to subscribe by offering it as part of brickmaster but in the long run put it in the stores for 6 and sell a million just give us indys manbag we need it for postal employees and such as is the running joke whenever i comment on one of your reviews id give this a solid 985 not out of anything just 985 or in clearer terms  12 though i voted 5	positive

thanks for the good review  i can´t wait for mine to arrive and just think how close paulc was in his reverse building of this which turned into a event exclusive in billund  he was just wrong on the color of the headlight bricks black instead of frown and the rear bumper stuff which couldn´t be seen on the bag picture kudos paulc as for my badass patrol car and the sop standard operation procedure of cavity searches there´s more to see here over at brickzone  here´s a teaser copmike	positive

thanks for this review if youd only know what memories you brought back i think i remember this set better than any other i had when i was a child some time after i got it i decided to disassemble it and combine it with the jeep from 6552 rocky river retreat it came out pretty good though as it became the main attraction point of my town beeing the car of my favourite minifig back then and and and looong story  i kept it assembled that way from this day on until earlier this year when i finally disassembled it because i needed the parts edited by metalandi 06 august 2008  0357 am	positive
a nice set to go with the outback theme i am kind of dissapointed they they didint continue the theme as i only managed to grab 6487 and 6550 none the less this set is very interesting as its one of the few to feature working suspention stauder	positive

thebrickster on aug 7 2008 0406 pm said at leat you were able to pick up two of the sets do you still have them andor the pieces yes i have the parts the manuals and even one of the boxes unforutunaltey the parts are mixed in a big pile of parts as i never had any time to sort out my parts you can see i used the yellow doors here decals applied the great thing about the copter was it had 2 suitcases which as far as i can tell aint a common part not rare but still nice to have and it had the guy with the green jacket the winch wasnt bad either the only flaw was it was a standard lego copter meaning similar ones where avalible in quite a few sets do you plan to review it staudie	neutral

nice review this set looked very nice for its time	positive
oh i loved this set when i was young i think i got it for my birthday and it was one of my favourite sets at the time funnily enough i was thinking about it the other day and how i really should build it again thanks for the nostalgic review	positive
ok this is the big one the controversial one the one everyone either hates or defends what do i think read on the figs bandana man masked dude dude with shades good figures i miss scarface comes with his torso though which is my favorite the one with the ammo strap across the chest one figure short of the figuretoprice value but we can deal with that the dino the dino its the one that comes with the chopper in green any questions the tank and so it begins i think it looks a lot better in person than on the box the left side good time to mention that the treads run pretty easily and this is a very playable set right side keep an eye on that flap in the center  and we have a folding ladder the back probably the weakest point of the set apart from the dino the turret turned and tilted the mechanism works extremely well and the gun seems to work better than others for some reason or maybe it just seems that way the front of the cockpit im at a loss trying to figure out how those tiny windshields defend them against 40foot mutant tyrannosaurus rexes with radioactive breath laser eyes and what have you anyway another one of those neat steering wheels some viking horns and some stickered control panels oh yeah this set has a good amount of stickers probably around 20ish the back of the cockpit i love the little gun it turns 360 degrees and tilts up oh yeah and those green barrels theyve been using are awesome i can think of tons of uses for them the verdict 7610 playability 9410 pieces 7510 figures 8810 dino 310 value 410 the main downfall of this set is the price i would easily pay 30 for this no questions asked but 40 was a hard sell for me  i gave in merely to see what i would think of it and also to help you guys find out the same this is a great display set and a great play set the pieces are good  lots of nice blay beams used in the construction but the price people thats the killer pick this up only if you have everything else or you find it on clearance and thus ends my dino attack review series hope you enjoyed them until next time bloody jay	neutral
tks for the review once more jay  i totally agree with you jay  this set has very nice details suche as the mini gun movable ladder green barrels and great figs  however it is very expensive for what it is and i dont think there are that many very usefall parts in there  well i could use those treads  if i ever buy this set its really not for the design which i totally dislike	positive
sam89 on aug 5 2005 0133 pm said thanks for the reviews once again it looks like qite a nice set to me although the european version will lose the big gun i like some of the stickers although i wish they were printed and i actually quite like the dinosaur i probably wont get it though the set im most likely to get is the fire hammer yay some one that agrees with me 	positive

this is my first review so i thought the smaller the set the better 6626 snowmobile year 2000 subtheme arctic pieces 20 1 extra note polybag 6577 is the boxed version price €1  sh on ebay misp mint in sealed polybag building time less than 2 minutes if it came out in the last months if would be called an impulse set it actually came out a few years ago being those my dark years i missed the arctic line now that im back into business i wanted some but not all of the sets were good or easily available i had the chance to buy this one and i0m happy with it as you can see below it consists of a figure on a scooter the only accessories are those chainsaws that lie on the sides unless you take the skis from the scooter and have the minifig wear them the extra piece is a transyellow 1x1 round plate according to brickset and peeron the difference between box and polybag is the sticker sheet you choose whether the nose is better with or without the sticker id say with the judgement its cheap it has a cool minifig with a cool head accessory and a nice torso i dont think i like that orange colour that much and i cant understand why those blue pieces have to be blue i guess its beacuse the whole line uses blue with orange but i have to say this is definetely a good set id give it a 4 out of 5 in its category if you want to own at least a set per every theme this could be your arctic one packaging content minifig i hear you ask whats that yellow thing on the left leg dust or something alike the snowmobile edited by the cobra 07 august 2008  0233 pm	neutral

i dont really like this set because it isnt my idea of the droid gunship which is from sw battlefront which can hold as many droids as a rgs can hold clones if i buy this itd be for the dark blue pieces which is the signature color of one of my castle nations  dark red and dark blue 	negative

i got this yesterday on sale only 5500 yen60 american and was a little disappointed id avoided it but all the new sets are at least a month away here it looks a little weird in photo and the actual build is worse just a flat little disc with a cockpit only special points for the color which will probably just look better with those 2009 sets	negative

emergency evac set  6445 theme town resq year released 1998 piece count 97 minifigs 1 list price 8 usd in 1998 lego introduced a new theme called resq the theme was really a quasicoast guard subtheme of classic town the theme included boats helicopters emergency vehicles and even a water hovercraft most notable was the black and yellow color combination that predominated the sets i only picked up a couple of sets from the theme including this emergency evacuation vehicle that i consider a van i never got into the theme but looking back at these sets i have gained a better appreciation for their value in classic town lets take a look at 6445 in greater detail starting with the box the back of the box providing a few alternate models and similar imagery on the instructions the set includes one small sheet of decals for the van 6445 has one resq minifig that i find pretty nice i like the neon orange reflectors he has a nice printed backside with the word resq prominently displayed this little set includes an abundance of tools a black walkietalkie is not pictured heres the emergency van i like the back section that has a nice winch with turning wheel and a few hooks for tools heres the minifig pulling the grappling hook for some resq action this is my favorite part of this set the van isnt too fancy but has some neat features while i like the blue windshield piece for maybe space sets im not really fond of its use for the van the van has no steering wheel but rather two levers for steering on the top of the vehicle are two emergency alarms and some extra lights the back of the van has a large opening piece that allows wide access to the back section it comfortably fits a long gurneystretcher heres the driver resting on the gurney he should never have tried to pick up the gurney without a 2nd resq minifig and a shot of the back section without the gurney lastly a picture of the complete set final thoughts resq is really a neat theme that has great play value for kids while its not one of my more favorite town subthemes it does offer some nice pieces and an abundance of black and yellow pieces i think a few of the resq sets go nicely with the divers theme released one year earlier in 1997 i had a chance to purchase the largest set of the theme 6479 emergency response center at half the price but passed back in the late 90s id be interested in finding out what other eb members think of this set and the resq theme	positive
i am a proud owner of this set like others i got it discounted and couldnt resit the parts pack this is the type of lego sets that bothers me when you look at it now youd be tempted to say hey not bad but at the same time some years ago it wasnt good enough to buy it full price i was kinda disappointed because usually sets using that kinda baseplates are excellent castle paradisa and this one is just ok one really minus point would be the lack of any opponent faction in the set	negative
thats it thanks for the review but now you make me want to build my own one thanks a lot on a more serious note i really like this set and have always wished to aquire it i have two broken tie interceptors so this should be a easy build and as someone in the pirate forum i think said it would be a great baseplate for building cave to hide the booty thanks pmg and welcome	positive

set 7680  the twilight theme star wars year released 2008 piece count 882 price aud14999 or 15999 if you buy at tru 9999 euro us9999 pity the twilight when rumours of the set name first circulated speculation was swift twilight  that suggests something sleek elegant and mysterious anticipation mounted fanfrenzy grew finally a pic leaked and the verdict was clunkadunk it appeared that in the jedi offseason anakin was running something that looked like an intergalactic garbage scow like roger wilco in the old sierra space quest pc games blocky and bley seemed to sum it up the set went from being one of the most anticipated to one of the least liked of 2008 pretty much instantly its a mark of that dislike that in the eb clone wars review feeding frenzy nobody has so far even bothered to post a few pics of this set even 2 weeks after its official release im here to redress that imbalance now and find out if 7680 is as horrendous as everyone originally thought part 1 box  parts front of the box its quite big same size as the 10144 sandcrawler annoyingly its the old style with the perforated corners that you have to tear to flip open the lid detail of the back showing set functions interior of the box  a lot of wasted space the set comes with 2 instruction manuals each 76 pages and no dss sheet polybags 13 of em like the other cw sets these are unnumbered parts ahoy you can tell at a glance that this set is comparable to the atte although there a large proportion of the 800 parts here are technic pins and bley plates part 2 minifigs and build the set comes with 4 figs or 35 depending on how you look at rotta  anakin ahsoka r2d2 and rotta very disappointing that theres nothing new here for such a highpriced exclusive although i guess it is maybe movie accurate anyway to paraphrase the wise patsy stone you can never have enough hats shoes or new anakin ahsoka hairpieces so its not too bad pics of the build in progress a quarter of the way through we can already see that this is one of those convoluted technic frames with some plates affixed type builds halfway and the smaller wing is added at the three quarter mark the giant single wing is added and voila done the final quarter is a race to attach all the exterior surfaces and details such as the engine and escape pod the build itself is a mixed blessing it is very technic oriented im not a technically minded person and dont really have much of a conceptual grasp of how everything functions until i see the final result so i find these type of builds a little uninteresting pins axles and beams give me bricks any day i really liked the 7676 gunship and the 7679 fighter tank although they do contain some technic framework they are largely brickbuilt ships especially the fighter tank which is solid largely brick built and full of neat functions the 7680 build is one of the most technicy builds ive ever undergone in a system set akin to the experience of building the 10178 motorised atat but whereas with that set you could understand the need for a technic framework the thing walks a lot of this seemed excessive yes the twilight does some have nice functions and it is so large and heavy it does need a strong skeleton but to me it just seemed too much and aesthetics have been sacrificed for in some cases limited functionality i will discuss in more detail what i mean as i look at different parts of the set on the upside this is the only nonsymmetric set in the cw range so at least every page and new step brings something different part 3 a closer view closeup of the main body of the ship fronton it is welldesigned how the figs appear in line of sight unlike the 6211 where jabba and leia were photoshopped in to the box art dont ask what rotta is doing out of the line of vision there some things are better left unsaid side view showing escape pod smaller cylinder and drive top view rear view showing back door the rear deck is huge indeed the whole ship is huge oddly so i dont know if this is moviescale or not but ive seen people complain the fighter tank is too big  and that set is nothing compared to this baby its wider than the gunship and in wingspan and length is almost bigger heres a few pics next to an mtt for comparison pretty big hey turning to the dark side must be good for business even if all you can buy is a rusty old beast like this at least you could comfortably squash pretty much every vehicle in the opposing fleet just by landing on it at least now you can see why it costs so much the official pics make it look smaller somehow by truncating the rear and wing the ship is in fact so big you cant really pose it with wings open  only hold it that way i was too lazy to build a giant transclear support strut so propped it up on a shoebox instead the wing opens very neatly  you push a technic lever and a pin holding the bottom wing pops out quite smoothly the little top turret can move up and down as well to get the full crossshaped effect part 4 features and functions the front cockpit folds down very neatly although i find the build here a little weak whee it goes all the way down to the floor the mechanism is cool but it takes up an awful lot of space basically the whole front is cockpit and all lego could manage for controls is 2 printed 1x2 tiles as well not pictured here but theyre attached to the part that folds up and down theres also no way for anyone to get in or out of the cockpit and an invisible windscreen technology has come a long way side view looking from wing r2d2 is here as well as some tools you can also glimpse here one of the main problems with the set despite being a huge boxy ship theres no interior none the twilight doesnt even have an internal floor all the room inside is taken up by the landing gear which folds up  again a clever function but it really gets in the way of the set as a whole kudos to the designer for coming up with stable working landing gear but too clever by half if it means that this giant ship ends up basically being one tiny cockpit and a rear door at the back that doesnt lead to any interior underside showing landing gear when open and closed  when the wing is folded down the gear is locked in place which is pretty neat spaceconsuming but neat the rear section the door when opened reveals an orange cupboard and a towline as ahsoka uses in the box art the door clicks into place when open and can be released by pressing the technic bit at the top again clever but pointless as you cant get inside ahsoka can indulge in a little recreational bungeejumping if she so wishes the rear deck is so large that it is wasted just being used so ahsoka can bungeejump i came up with a much better use for it outdoor garden despite having one roboticised hand anakin was still quite the green thumb and his lightsaber was very useful as a hedge trimmer so much so that he set up a side business between rottarescue missions heres a promotional postcard a few other bits and pieces the gun turret on the enormous megawing can only hold one flick fire missile at a time you do get two though  rear engine detail the escape pod sits neatly on the side and is basically built the same way as the gunship bacta tank the pod sits on these tehcnic pins and is held in place by the light bley parts part 5 in conclusion the twilight is a huge ship with a huge amount of great functions  folding wing folding cockpit rear door escape pod retractable landing gear but this functionality comes at a price  a very complex technic build and zip interior compared with the gunship for example which is stuffed with nooks and crannies the twilight suffers in this respect i also think it is just too large  it doesnt really fit with the other craft and vehicles released with the clone wars line i may be wrong and it is movieaccurate but when you have all the cw sets laid out it does stick out like a poor thumb part selection is ok with the only interesting things being a few dark orange plates the orange cupboard and the big transneon green radar dish dont get me wrong i dont think this is a bad set at all its just the other cw sets are so sweet i would say its an above average set in a field crammed with excellent ones if youre a completist buy it but if for example youd rather invest in another atte to upgrade your republic army then i couldnt really disagree with you either and to finish on a light note id like to remind you that you do get another ahsoka hairpiece which can be used for all sorts of things ugha warrior upgrade dr inferno hair transplant and finally attack of the deadly blueringed octopus native to australias beaches and oceans thanks for reading	neutral
another outstanding review by the awesome set reviewer i enjoyed reading this review very much and i felt that you have redress twilight in an approriate manner i have very mixed feeling about this set especially with its design it seemed i will need to watch the clone wars movie in the theatre before i compared with it most of the time when this lego set is used in a movie you will tend to compare it and what is the actual purpose for twilight same as the rest of the sw vehicles and aircraft for a high price like this i can actually top up a little more and get the atte with the same batch of minifigs plus commander rex if there is a special figure such as the v19 torrent clone pliot it will be a much ideal scenario at the moment i have not bring in any clone war sets into my collection and i am quite sure twilight is not in my priority list especially when i am not a fullpledged star war collectors or i have strong intentions to complete the entire range in this recent release therefore i need to prioritise my purchase and likely to get two rgs since that is my favourite ship in clone war era i am not comparing it with rgs both sets defintely have their pros and cons oh i love that postcard you made certainly looks very nice sveltecorps thanks for doing up this superb detailed review which had given twilight the neccessary attention it should have	neutral
thanks for the review now i thinnk i will buy this set btw i really like what you did to the back i might do the same to mine	positive
wow certainly much bigger than i would have thought thanks for the great review and pictures  well for some reason i was drawn to this set but with the lack of interior and quite a bit of technics i think ill pass or at least get the atte first thanks again	neutral
i read the visual guide recently and learned a bit more about the twilight i wont get into spoilers but it seems that the ship becomes a sort of endearing family van for the characters which is neat big bulky uncool but it gets you from one place to another if it factors into more than just the 90 minute film i may pick this up it seems that theres room for a lot of personality in this ship once you see the film it is a corellian freighter smuggling spice for the hutts thats cool right	neutral

thanks a lot for a very nice and entertaining review your photos were really nice and there have been some reviews lately that have such blurry pics cough cough it was a pleasure to see you can 1 put lego bricks together 2 write a review 3 handle your camera i think this ship is underrated it is really nice i love the playing features like landing gear and back door perhaps just cause i had to get along with so called landing gears in the past that did not work at all 7140 for example and i simply love that there is space inside you said there is not really some cause of the landing gear mechanism but it seems it should be easily fixed do you think there is enough space to put some plates over the landing gear and add some beds kitchen und tv i think this set is so perfect to mod it into a clone wars mobile home your back garden ist just perfect for this i prefer this over the atte and over a 2nd gunship thanks a lot for the review	positive
i will not be picking this one up the main thing is that it simply looks akward it is big and bulky and seems to have random pieces on it with not reall streamline feel to it i also agree that for an exclusive that it 100 it needs more than just 35 mini figures anikan and ashoka and rotta already come in the atte which is cheaper and has more figures r2d2 is a figure that i am sure everybody has at least 4 or 5 of for that kind of money i expect something with at least one unique figure and more than 4 i also want just a cleaner and better designed set this is probably the letdown of the collection so far every collection needs one	negative
seems like tlc has done a pretty accurate representation of the ship the real fault for the ships messy design has to go to lucasfilm not tlc my guess is lucasfilm is trying to recapture that what a piece of junk magic of the millennium falcon i guess well have to wait to see the movie to see if they succeeded or not the idea of a space mobile home reminds me of the winnebago from spaceballs great review informative entertaining and opinionated so many people shy away from stating an actual opinion in their review for fear of offending anyone whats the point of making a review if you dont state what you think about it	neutral
sveltecorps on aug 12 2008 0219 am said hmm dior i can smell it now the ship doesnt look too swooshable but then again more than the heavy rgs i really like that review svelte corps so much detail unfortunately i would only get this if it was a very low price like in a sale	neutral

thanks for the review i for one will get this set i collect and therefore i need it i vision something like this a i buy the set b i built the set c pics for my bs account d set taken apart sad but true its not much but super for parts i agree from what your review showed me that this set is a little too much technic a thing thats been invading our beloved brick built sets in the past years i really have no need for a retractable front or functioning landing gear what i need is a kickass ship with neat design and cool interior the twilight does not offer that look at the size of that thing	negative

having plenty of time on my hands this summer i did some reviews yes im aware this has already been done but ill just do it once more no harm there set 5615 set title the knight price 299 euro  349 usd pieces 21 yes a whole 21 bricks release 2007 the box a neat little box that has a great size for dropping into your shopping cart for once tlg didnt shove the bricks into an oversized cardboard box  the knight this is a great minifig though he looks a little unsatisfiedmight be because his head isnt put on all the way a great army builder fig the only thing that i find a little annoying is that the collar isnt completely rounded it looks too much like an animation and lefthand work the weapon rack yes thumbs up for this plate mail sword shield and jousting helmet plus the spear and open helmet on the fig so many great additions to put into use bring it on pesky skeleton army the all in all verdict a great set a little too expensive compared to the crossbow attack in which one gets 2 knights and a skeleton plus bricks for 549 euro  599 usd but still a great army builder set and the 7090 set does not have the same knight fig kimt	positive
i bought four of these sets i guess this was the best selling impulse set so far great idea to have weapons and helmet choice as for the price id say 7090 is surprisingly cheap	positive
very good set indeed the possibility to alter the knights appearance hugely boosts the value very smart thinking of tlc got one of these so far but if i ever do a castlerelated comic or animation this will be the set i buy tons of	positive
argh what i was typing kept getting deleted by my stupid keyboard on topic this looks like a great little set i could use a few of these but i havent seen any at a local store too bad for me i suspose  great review and i like the green plate on the bottom never can have too many greens for my small but expanding swamp im building hope i can pick some of these up eventualy	positive
time for another of the great castle sets and yes this one is a great army builder set as well d set 7090 set title crossbow attack price 529 euro  599 usd pieces 54 release 2007 the box and as the other two sets reviewd so far 7009 and 5615 this one has a fitting box that is too easily snatched from the shelf and put into your shopping cart  not sure its a great thingtoo expensive in the end d the crossbow attack cart the cart is a neat little build that actually works and for once were not given that awful technic launcher but a buildit launcher it actually works just fine for its purpose the addition of two crossbows makes it worth buying never can get enought weapons for the evergrowing crownie army the figs oddly ive not taken any pics of the figs and therefore ill illustrate using the sh pic the figs are great i love the silver helmets and in this set you get 2 crownies and a skeleton plus a white skeleton horse thats a lot of figs for a set this size a true army builder thumbs up for that the all in all verdict another small yet super set in the castle theme i bought several of these to make a fine little army its cheap and often found on sale i can hardly resist buying it when i see it kimt	positive
hard to find in italian shops i had a friend buying one for meas soon as the set was available i always wanted another one so while in switzerland see kimts 7009 review for the full story i bought two for 5 €uros you get two knights a skeleton and a skeleton horse some hand weapons and a shooting device please remember dont aim at the eyes just great	positive
this little bugger brought me back from my dark ages as a movie fan i just couldnt resist the thought of making an animation with living lego skeletons im referring to ray harryhausens work on the classic jason and the argonauts here buying the indy sets stopped me from getting a lot more castle sets though in time i added the final joust the wizard and the impulse knight to my collection as well as buying more unique figs king princess from expensive castle sets off bricklink so yeah great little set two crownies a skeleton and a skeletal horse you just cannot resist that even if you hadnt been buying lego for 5 years as far as im concerned this set is one for the ages i love it	positive
and another set enters the scene set 7009 set title the final joust price 829 euro  799 usd pieces 62 release 2007 the box and yet again tlg has put the bricks in a box that somehow corresponds with the amount of bricks in it the castle theme has got well designed boxes  the whole set build 2 knights jousting fence and weapon rack the weapons rack another great addition of weapons flail halberd and skeleton scimitar super weapons for those close encounter melee battles fought when tipped off the horse  grinp the jousting fence not much to say its a fence simple yet it serves its purpose very well the crown knight gotta love that guy he looks like nothing can hurt him he even got a selfsufficient smile on his face im sure hes convinced that no skeleton can defeat him also the horse its barding and the headcover looks awesome a great old school sword and the ever cool normannic shield what could possibly go wrong for this knight the helmet i really love imo its a lot better than the old knight helmets see review of 5615 the knight for a pic of one of those the skeleton knight the black skeleton horse rocks i love that design and in black its even badder than than the white version the shield reeks of dread and the knight is one bad skeleton on the rampage i do find that the helmet is a little off id rather have a black knights helmet instead the kk helmet doesnt really do it for me the all in all verdict this is another great army builder set it holds a lot of great weapons some cool minifigs and great pieces the only thing that puzzles me is why would a crown knight joust a skeleton doesnt really make sense kimt	positive
ive been waiting to hold this set in my hands for about a year and a half thanks to a silly tlc decision 7009 was not available in italian stores i finally decided to buy it on the net 2x  plus some other sets and those morons at the custom charged me quite a lot after i bought it while waiting for it to arrive i found out it was available in a store in switzerland not far away from home thats for the storytelling as for the set i thought it was great and still think so a good army builder as quite a few sets in the 20072008 castle line and a time traveller 6021 being my first lego castle set ever rating 55 edited by the cobra 13 august 2008  0904 pm	positive
lovely set nice collection of weapons cool horseaccesoires for the white knight cool black skeletal horse on the dark knights side loving the printed armours of both knights and as opposed to kimt apparently i really dig the black helmet i feel theres a lord of the ringsflavour to it with those curves well designed	positive
another small set my local target doesnt have they dont have the best castle selection they only really have dwarven mines and castle seiges ill buy this if i see it there though because it looks like a great little set i could use the awesome knight and a skeleton that has a regular body so he looks like he is in armor	positive
im not a huge fan of this set but it is a great way to nab a fully mounted knight complete with a very attractive barding given that in prior years it wasnt possible to get a barded horse in such a small set this set is actually a decent way to build a mounted cavalry for your kingdom looking at bricklink it would probably cost as much to buy the knight horse and weapons separately and that doesnt take into account the skeleton or the extra bricks despite my indifference to this set i actually have purchased four of them in the past year simply because there isnt a cheaper way to acquire a mounted knight a quick question about the poll are we voting on the quality of the set or the quality of the review later edited by blueandwhite 13 august 2008  0550 am	neutral

you know what i think this set has charm lots of it im not a big fan of castle having very few sets all of them spanning different nationsarmies but i couldnt resist this set and while not obvious at first it really is backwards compatible with every castle set with a horse in it nonetheless i think this set is great its simple cheap and has charm thats good enough for me plus it has that fantastic grinning knight and the black skeleton horse those just made it better	positive
tenorikuma on aug 13 2008 0348 am said i should really get one more of these for the figures shields and weapons this set is the only one with the scythe in pearlgrey by the way except its just plain darkgrey you must have gotten this set mixed with another though ive never heard of a pearlgrey scythe	neutral

good review kimt pictures are clear and show each of the pieces in great detail i agree with your comments as well im a bit curious does the knights helm have a hole for plume ive been debating whether to purchase this set or not im not a big fan of horses so ill likely barely use them but i do like the unique minifigs weapon rackweapons and the fact that the divider has a few useful pieces that can be added to other sets however i just dont feel the set is worth 8 when compared to crossbow attack and the knights catapult unless the buyer is really wanting some mounted minifigs luckily amazon just lowered their price of this set from 8 to 6 along with another 20 if using bill me later just in case anyone was also in the same situation i was in at that price its damn well worth it	positive
first things first the knights helm does have a spot for a plume now i really like this set and it was the first one i dug into when i got my collection in the mail it has a great selection of equipment for good or evil figures and the barding for the horse is outstanding my only wish was for one of the long chrome swords for the knights i think the new knights with the tall shield and chrome sword look excellent on foot and on horseback it would definitely be neat to revisit this set with another human knight instead of the skeleton make that change and add a lady to joust for and itd be bang on	positive
this looks like a really great set i wasnt around in 88 to get it but i like it it actually has things inside the interior thanks for the review hinckley on aug 13 2008 0611 pm said there were quite a few sets in the 1980s that werent sold in the us hooray sort of in england we dont get in normal shops batman and spongebob sets and not at all  avatar sets and brickmaster but america gets all of these maybe its revenge for americas lego neglect in the 80s hinckley on aug 13 2008 0611 pm said i remember reading once that it was because they contained wine glasses and tlg felt they wouldnt be able to market a toy that encourage the drinking of alcohol this set was one of them they didnt want to encourage the drinking of alcohol in america but were fine encouraging it in other places maybe thats why my country has such a big problem with binge drinking or maybe not	positive
thats a great review of a great set hinckley i voted for outstanding  this set is simply amazing i regrettably dont own this set since its very hard to find on ebay andor the stickers are missing but nevertheless i hope that i one day will be able to get this awesome set  or even better  see tlg releasing a new city villa in a style similar to that brilliant set  klausdieter edited by klausdieter 13 august 2008  0630 pm	positive

great review id give this set an 8 at the least its just a tad too simple for my liking but other than that it looks great while im a 4 wide car man i actually think this car looks rather horrendous the main body seems way too low in comparison with the windows the rare parts however do make up for it hinckley on aug 13 2008 1123 pm said yes yes in the states horrifying and deplorable violence is fine but drinking and swearing sends kids directly to hell somehow i feel like watching south park now  that was such a good episode	neutral

thanks for the wonderful review this is really a beautiful set  i love the old lego houses from the 80s and 90s  they were always very quaint and well designed actually i like the old car designs too but only for their nostalgic value in reality they are very unrealistic and look more like go carts that said not all four wide cars are silly looking  the 4wide cars in these city sets are awesome and fit in with the modern city style great	positive
cool review i never knew that those wineglasses could be the reason for this not being sold in the us	neutral
i just bought this its truly a wonderful set and i love the houses from that era as well very charming great review	positive
i wish i could find this set some day including the right baseplate some of my house mocs are styled after the classic 6349 and sometimes ive rebuilt it after instruction scans exchanging the baseplate i dont own one of these with 2 at 16x32 each and this city house out of an older thread of mine its offensive that ive used styling elements of 6349s just enlarged in terms of interior details not much but still enough for classic town i voted outstanding mfg widdi edited by widdi 09 october 2008  0122 am	positive
this is an awesome set man and a great review just too bad it is so rare i voted 5 by the way does anyone know if there is a review for this or other sets that come with a camper perhaps also i was wondering if the creator houses are in scale and could be used with minifigs and such	positive

this would be great for any pirate fan the extraback pack for the soldiers some spare owes for the row boats a female face for a wench and a rather simple raft for that unlucky pirate lost at sea over all a nice set i am a little confused by the dynamite though perhaps an easy way to go fishing or perhaps to clear a rock in the forseen future or is it that she is just a suicide bomber attacking the white house water joke not ment to be tasteless or offensive to those lost in the act of terrosim greatest respect to those who have lost loved ones great review regards cpt pb	positive

aerial recovery set  6462 theme town resq year released 1998 piece count 201 minifigs 3 list price 25 usd my personal favorite of the resq theme released in 1998 was this helicopter 6462 aerial recovery the set offered a pretty modern helicopter raft threewheeler rescue gurney and net and three figs including a diver the set is actionpacked and offers a high degree of play value starting with the box front side and back front back i always liked the rough oceansea water pictured in the boxart the same image from the front of the box appears on the cover of the instructions but the back of the instructions picture a plain view of the copter one sticker sheet with a few resq stickers is included mainly for the tail section of the helicopter interestingly the set includes three figures one being a diver what i always found strange is the inclusion of an xtreme team diver who has the logo on his torso although its a very nice fig back shot i think this was my first set with a lego threewheeler i always liked it a lot the set includes a yellow raft also found in the divers sets and some scuba gear note the raft has a black piece in its center for lifting up by the helicopter for sea and emergent rescue a gurney can also be lifted by the helicopter the set also includes a net with hook to lift the threewheeler and other items an extra string pulls the net closed heres a shot of the helicopter the front section has a large trans blue piece enclosing the cockpit inside is a printed radar slope a smaller trans blue piece appears a bit higher for access to the middle section of the helicopter andor a small storage area in the middle section is an place for the gurney and a box for storing some of the adventure gear heres a picture showing the gurney on the side is a pulley mechanism that swings to the right when not in use on the opposite side is the winch to raise and lower the grappling hook heres a picture of an open storage box i like the tail section with propeller decal is not shown heres another shot of the copter from a different angle and the final image the entire set final thoughts personally i think this is pretty nice set i like the thought of using the helicopter to rescue people at sea using the working winch extras like the trikethreewheeler and the rescue net make the set even more fun hope you enjoy this resq review	positive
thanks for this review thebrickster i also have this set and think its one of the best helicopters tlg made in the 90s its quite big and has got place for 2 minifigs in the cockpit i also like the fact that theres a victim included in form of the xtreme diver which also is a theme i always loved as a kid do you have any other resq sets left to review it would be an honour for me to also do a review of one or more sets which are left but unfortunately i got not much time at the moment	positive
cool then i think ill do a review of 6451 river response later today or tomorrow stay tuned	neutral
i got this set as well as a resq hovercraft this set is cool because of all the accessories and it come with a x team guy your set is also in much better condition than mine you have made me decide to rebuild it another great review thebrickster keep up the good work	positive
looks like a nice helicoptor i love the 2 cockpits i love the divers head i really need one of those	positive
the helicopter looks nice and the resq minifigs were nice the diver minifig had once been a personal favorite of mine	positive
thanks for the review brickster i do own this set in its original form the only drawback that i have noted previously is the lack of rotors and the cobraesq of the copter body i wish it had a larger fuselage but i still have it and i still like it despite my criticismwhich i am sure is in my eyes only thanks again brickster i wish i had bought some of the other res q sets but of course i only bought three	neutral
i think the set is too unrealistic i like the new resq sets better and im somewhat a lifeboat freak so im always following such a sets with interest i would like to see some rigit inflatable boats some day  but about the chopper i like the accessoiries	negative
what exactly makes you feel this set isnt realistic it has got nothing what wouldnt be on a real helicopter imo and for the futuristic design yes it looks modern but it works and actually most of todays real helicopters also dont look like in the 70s anymore	positive
this set was my first set ever from the resq series and i loved it entirely ofcourse i modded it slightly here and there after hours and hours of fun and excitement it has great play value even for a set in this size	positive
wow i loved this set i still have it actually in pieces though i took it apart quite soon after i got it then managed to lose the instruction manual	positive
if you still have all the parts try to rebuild it youll see that its a great feeling	positive
very nice review this is another set which i had never seen before when i am in my dark age quite an useful set especially with the accessories and the minifigs torsos the speedboat is able to hold the car and the rubber rescue boat how can the driver steer this boat with so many things blocking the way i cant seemed to find its control though thanks for doing this review	neutral
well i for one really like this set it has to be one of the nicer ribbies that tlg has made tons of playability and nice options for redesign great set overall thanks for the review	positive

very nicely done  this cart is a striking resemblance to the crossbow cart we got in 2007	positive
nice review i agree with thok it’s quite similar to the more recent crossbow attack though this one has the added benefit of two shields this set would i fleet be more useful to army builders than most of the modern castle sets even though many people don’t like frightknights	neutral
quote even though many people don’t like frightknights i dont really like fright knights either i just happened to have this set	neutral
looks great and the figures up there are old and kinda rare i dont really like fright knights though so i probably wont get this set	neutral
thanks for the review ive added it to the index im not a fan of this theme but i have to say that this is a neat little set that does hold some good things figs and weapons are always welcome and one can never have to many wheels so i rate this average	neutral
originally shared in the history  adventure forum for its adventure attributes heres my favorite of the outback collection first let me say that this little set is one of my alltime favorites because it can be used to sumplement a number of different themes 1 the set makes a great little adventure airstrip for adventurers and more recent the indiana jones theme see also german headquarters and port adventure ive also used the set as an addition to my wild west town the tan baseplate and windmill works great just subtract the plane modern equipment and figs and lastly as the set was intended as an outbackdesert airstrip set description outback airstrip set  6444 pieces 157 minifigs 3 release date 1997 original price 20 usd starting with the box and the backside notice the alternate models i love the swamp boat the building is my favorite part of the set it is simple has a little detail two great roof pieces and a single green window great piece check out the great windmill piece its my only one and makes a great part for wild west and that farm you always wanted to build i used it for the barnhouse of barnabas higgens and spring valley ranch on the side of the building is a great radio and a clear glass unfortunately no furniture can be found within the building and now the airplane front view i love the twin propellors side view and the rear section the back has a small cargo hold for some boxesfreight or some gear needed in the outback the set includes three figs two with cool shades and some great equipment i love the boom box a shot of the whole set and another summary as i mentioned above this set is very versatile and can suplement a few different themes its my personal favorite of the outback collection and im really glad i was able to find the set in the late 90s i almost didnt buy sets like this are timeless and so much fun to build and display hope you enjoy the review edit additional reviews review by agentrick57 december 24 2007 outback airstrip review in history  adventure forum february 10 2008	positive
great review this set has cool features i just wish that lego would release this as a lego legend and release it to australia too since this is a set about australia i wouldve bought two if this were a lego legend that is how good it is i like the building with latticed window and windmill i also like the cargo airplane windsock and radios plus it looks like its got great minifigs	positive
this is probably my alltime favorite lego set it was originally given to me for my birthday by a close friend of mine back in the release year of 1997 the cargo plane was by far my favorite vehicle ever unfortunately someone stole the plane from me when our families went on vacation and the rest of the set was given to my cousins oldest son when i was no longer interested in my lego collection now that im back into lego i use that buildings construction for various projects especially as a dr inferno lookout shack using parts from extra mission 3 swamp raid the shack compliments the original set greatly edited by skorpius47 19 august 2008  0144 am	positive
this was a cool set i thoght of it as i was building the post plane	positive
the building is great and detailed with a few mods it could be added to my castle town i dont really like the plane though seems kind of abstract not really good in my opinion but i bet it would be easy to mod to look better	positive
one of the best in my humble opinion as far as i know it was never released in the uk so the only reason i managed to get my hands on it was on a family holiday to the us i think they’d only recently opened the lego store in disney arguable the best feature is that it seems to fit into a wide selection of themes is it a airstrip in the middle of nowhere is it next to a only mining town that’s not deserted the possibilities are rather open and that’s truly great	positive
legoman132 on aug 18 2008 0936 pm said this was a cool set i thoght of it as i was building the post plane interesting thought i have the post plane but i havent opened it yet i suppose its the yellow the plane in this set is much different than most of the other classic town airplanes in that it has the double tail section heres a shot of the new 7732 air mail set  definately a nice set	positive

set 7103 theme star wars set name jedi duel pieces 74 release 2002 price 10 usd minifigs 2 count dooku and yoda links 7103 brickshelf folder bricklink reference catalog peeroncom introcomment i remember getting this set solely because i collect star wars as i rebuild it and took pics of it i found that i actually like this set for different reasons dookus speeder is pretty cool and the lightsabre rocks the dooku minifig is also great whats not so great is the flythingy and getting another yoda though thats kinda hard not to get in a set focused on their duel you cant see the wires because they digitally removed them be careful or ill digidally remove your head  steven seagal i hope i quoted that one right  so to get the review on the move ill impress you all with a box picture neat huh one of the smaller boxes but still kinda big when consider that you only get 74 pieces and 2 minifigs the instruction isnt that big as i said the dooku minifigs is awesome i love the print on his torso that combines the brown cape with the torso and also the head is neatly designed not a fleshie though this was before the fleshlicensefacelift a sideview of the light blue speeder mmmm that crome light sabre hilt is nice the design of the speeder is also ok and without the usual offcolourscheme bricks no tan or yellow sticking out there yeah id panic too if this came right at mewho wouldnt when noones driving and a rear shot i think the design is a little off the shields makes it all a little too open in my opinion the printed bricks are a kick and thus evens the score here this hideous design is meant to flip yoda around the air put him in this funfair from hell thing and give him a twister he and dooku will never forget my guess is that its there to add some playability but its just odd and quite useless much like the playability soccer thingies in the ultimate light sabre duel the verdict ups and downs this set offers both i rate it as average since the size and price of the set make it acceptable to have odd things confused good so am i making a small set isnt that easy and remeber this set is from 2002 and a lot has happended since then designwise that is what do you think	positive
you think its not a great thing that we get a yoda fig in an affordable set like this that was the main reason why i got this set and what do you mean by another wasnt this the only one that was ever released except for the one in the dagobahxwing set sure he is not the best fig with the unmovable legs and all but still its yoda besides he doesnt move his legs a lot in real life either nice review though and thanks for telling me what that liftarmthingy was meant to be for i never got that and thought it was supposed to lift up the speeder for some reason i got two of this set and the printing on those blue parts were off in the second one i got edited by oky wan kenobi 18 august 2008  0845 pm	positive
no yoda was released in no less than 34 sets ok so i remembered wrong i just have plenty yodas and one is more than enough for the set list click here thanks for pointing that out	neutral
nice review i realy like this set two nice minifigs in an affordable set and i do like the speeder but that lift thing is strange but now at least i know what it is thanks for letting me know	positive
thanks for the nice review kimt  i like this set especially by the fact that it is the only set containing the dooku minifig and the curved lightsaber  i also think that the minifig is cool but i also own the dagobah xwing and the wookiee catamaran sets so i have enought minifigs a clone wars version would be very cool  and the extrathingy is well just ok the bad part is that i dont buy the set when it is out and now is go for 40 on ebay and bricklink  edited by darkrebellion 18 august 2008  0951 pm	neutral
i think this is a pretty lame set it came with dooku who i think only came in this set plus a unique lightsaber still they could have made it much bigger added anikan and obiwan and added structures and made it more like the scene from the movie also the speeder doesnt seem very accurate	negative
i was very lucky to get this set and i love it i dont have it built cause i bought it for parts but it was fun while it lasted 	positive
great review kimt at that time it was still in my dark age and i hated myself not to get this set earlier this is quite inexpensive and you are able to get two greatest characters especially count dooku the minifigs are excellent especially the unique design of count dookus lightsaber i have no problem with the speedbike as it looks quite alright to me as for the elevation of yodas jump adds some playabilty but that does not work well for me nevertheless the main attractive factor is count dooku and i have to rate it a 5 i never own a yoda except for the magnet version	positive
cheers for the review kimt of the initial episode ii lego releases this set was the least inspiring but the minifigs were musthaves you cant go wrong with count dooku and yoda i like the design of dookus speeder in the movie but lego missed the mark a bit with it here and gave him a dodgy flying boat instead the speeder cradleyoda jumping mechanism was just a waste of parts unfortunately id like to see dookus speeder reimagined by lego theyve come a long way in the way they design a lot of the new star wars sets	neutral
thanks for the review its always good to have a 2nd opinion on a set ive added the usual poll and ill index it tomorrow must sleep super pics and great to have inbuild pics a fine set which ill surely buy when i find it	positive
very nice review one thing you have to consider when lego sees pics of the star wars universe they have to decide which would be the easiest set to make with the most playibility therefore they chose the hmp quote thanks for the review its always good to have a 2nd opinion on a set ive added the usual poll and ill index it tomorrow must sleep super pics and great to have inbuild pics defaultthumbupgif a fine set which ill surely buy when i find it defaulthmpfbadgif where edited by lt col thok 18 august 2008  1007 pm	positive

it took a long time but now here it is the review of the xtreme team set 6584 extreme team challenge thebrickster asked me a few weeks ago to do this since he unfortunately never owned this great set so here we go first i have to say that i really love this late 90s town theme and i wish there would have been produced more sets this is the only one i own well beside that i also still have 6572 wind runners but the car is missing anyway lets face the facts and let the pictures speak for themselves subtheme xtreme team set nr 6584 name extreme team challenge number of minifigs 4 number of pieces 354 release year 1998 lets start off with a few quick shots of the box  instructions inside of the box we got some ideas for alternative models on the backside the same ones are also on the backside of the instructions instructions heres an overall view of this huge set we get 4 minifigs each with different heads and color patterns which i really like and also a good amount of equipment for them lets move on with the cool vehicles there are 3  completely different ones in this set first is the neat little trike next the not less neat 4wheeled offroadthing dont know whats it called really  and finally the huge monster truck i love the chrome sidepipes and the wench with the hook in the back which adds a lot of playability oh i almost forgot our brave adventurers also have got a raft to ride the wild mountain waters now lets focus on the many details of the mountain base we got a bridge over troubled waters but be aware its very unstable love the wood patterns on the yellow 1x6 tiles on a corner a camera is mounted to document the wild life for the evenings we also got a little campfire down by the river sits a grey falcon and watches the guys on their challenges whats that seems not very safe to be honestbe aware when you pass by these rocks cause it will collapse lets move up again where the tent is placed inside is plenty of space to take a rest for the figs and to store their equipment but i think they should have built the tent on another place cause the ground isnt very good there when you pull the mechanism a trap door opens will the guys all come back home safe and not injured you decide all in all this is a really great set ome may say it is a bit juniorized because of the baseplate but it really isnt its got a lot of playability and some rare parts the biggest beeing the baseplate which is only available in this set i hope you liked my review let me know your opinions edited by metalandi 23 august 2008  1256 pm	positive
i remember getting this for christmas and despite the earthy grey parts i relly enjoyed it and it is nice to see pictures of it again thanks	positive
metalandi thanks for doing up this review this is a chance for me to gain some insight for extreme team theme this is a very interesting set that can be used for so many purposes 3 different vehicles wide range of accessories and nice minifigs what i love the most is the mountain bridge and tent it provided so much playability i am very impressed with it thanks for sharing	positive
cool set i like the tent and monster truck the most	positive
thank you for that very interesting review metalandi a cool set with a lot of features and some nifty vehicles very playable and well designed indeed perhaps a bit too colorful for my likings but pretty impressive in its conception for sure i wish we could see some more landscaping coming along with todays vehicle sets as well	positive
this was the first rock raiders set i got i really like it and i think i got all of them except the huge cargo airlift thing i remember these sets coming out and getting the big base for christmas though they are all destroyed now sadly  nice review	positive
i have never seen this set before but the minifig head would be perfect for a solid snake from mgs 2	positive
rock raiders was the shit back in the day awesome theme i had this set as well as the tunnel transporter which was amazing	positive
thanks for the review rock raiders was one of the last new themes i knew as a kid before my dark ages came unfortunately i never managed to get any sets from it beside a few months ago the 4910 the hover scout which i review a while ago wish i can get some of the bigger sets in the future	neutral
hello all eurobricks members and classic town lovers  editors note to mark the celebration of classic town this set which is released in 1994 and rereleased as a legend in 2002 pizza to go review is dedicated to classic towns opening cermony and members such as hinckley brickster imperialshadows sinner and many others whom have contributed to the final success of classic town thank you so much for inviting me to be part of this wonderful project and i wish all the best to the success of classic town i urge everyone of you to check out classic town and take alook at the cool stuff we have done  today i will be doing up a review on pizza to go set this outlet is one of the most favourite eatery for any lego citizens living in their town when they are driving on the road they are sure to look out pizzeria signage they offer the best pizza in town no one in town can resist the delicious aroma of pizza coming out from the red chimney let us find out why is this shop so popular among so many lego citizens and was one of the famous sets that is rereleased under the legend theme pizza to go is my favourite set of all time i believed there is no other pizza outlet lying around in any lego city apart pizzeria it seemed there are the sole outlet that is selling pizza for many years this set was rereleased in 2002 and it is part of the legend theme this is one of the few sets that are highly demanded to be brought back by many fans of lego around the world i owned the 6350 any members whom had owned both sets before is there any difference between these two because when i searched through peeron it shown 144 pieces instead of 194 pieces for the 1994 set name pizza to go theme lego system  town year 1994 rerelease 2002 pieces 194 minifigs 3 an image of a 6350 pizza to go let the delivery begins pizza to go is the regular pizza outlet that sells nothing but pizza they deliever pizza to every household in town with their trusty delivery van walkin are welcomed too there is a stand for customers to dine in their pizza quickly before making their way to their next destination in my opnon no town can ever survive without the pizza tradition devoted pizzeria staff every outlet comes with 3 dedicated staff making sure that operations will run smoothly on the left we will have the pizza boy whom is wearing the regular blue dungarees and its white cap i wonder who is that boy on the middle we will have the pizza girl she looks like any typical sweet girl in town that the boys will look at she is wearing a suntop strapless on her she reminded me of one person though i think her name is called alice taking a careful look i wonder if imperialshadows is the pizza boy back then without that black patch on its left eye on another note this minifigure was my favourite female minifigures are very uncommon back then i am glad i have this figure adding to my town population on the right we will have the hardworking chef preparing the pizzas in the oven he wears the regular white chef outfit but he wear a grey pants instead of the usual fullwhite outfit in most resturants such as breezeway cafe 6376 lets take a closer look at the pizza boys van this van is very very small looking and very fuel efficient it is able to cut lanes very fast due to its small size the pizza van is made up of 4studs wide design no doors by the side however in this vehicle i think the doors is not a must to be included in this design our pizza boy will need to leave vehicle pretty fast and ensuring that the pizza delivery is on time common mechanism this van has the regular rooftop that can be lifted up to place the pizza boy into the driver seat there is a sun roof on its top which enable him to let him have some sunlight from above the logo on the side of it is actually a transparent sticker which have the pizzeria itallian logo and a tasty looking pizza on both sides of its van i like that sticker very much mine looks quite worn out over time if its a printed piece it will be a terrific bonus nevertheless i can still accept the sticker our pizza van can deliever up to 2 pizza at a go at every trip 2 piping hot pizza will be stored at the back of the van the pizza is fitted in perfectly in each compartment furthermore the white window shutter is terrific in this design you dont see this kind of design anymore i think i have not seen much delivery vans on the street anymore too base of the van from the base you can see that it is using of the regular red car base that is common in most 4studs vehicle design in fact this car base served as a foundation for its vehicle design back of pizzeria alice and the chef will be showing you around at the back of the kitchen there is an oven on the left a water tap and a holder for the oar stick looks pretty empty right look below for a surprise my favourite feature this oven can be used to heat up 2 pizzas at a go now i understand why this set is named pizza to go i have been using their slogan unknowingly this feature is superb nice now we know that the pizza is prepared from the outlet instead of using delivery van to collect it from a factory alice what are you waiting for help the chef quickly pizzeria the signage sure looks big from far and catches their attention easily too with its pleasnt looking design as you have already noticed this is made up of sticker i dont mind for this set it contains sticker sometimes i do hope they can give us spare sticker for us to change after a long period of time distinct red chimney this is the front of the oven and that is where the smoke comes out using only bricks to construct this is simply wonderful i like the use of their white bricks to construct the wall layout and a combination of red parts especially on the top i like the look of this very much another picture on its side printed parts in this set you will get a total of 5 pizzas and i believed no other sets offer so many pizza you can placed up to 4 pizzas in the van and oven alice will be carrying the last pizza around the green and red round dish is a printed part most exclusive part in 635010036 the most unique and important printed parts that is only exclusive in this set its at the front of the pizza van it is none other but the pizzeria logo standing at the front of the delivery van forgotten to take a picture of this piece took it from peeron different views of pizza to go outlet another bright sunday day in pizza to go summary review playability 1010 a lot of playing by doing up the pizza process from preparing to delivery design 9510 outstanding design with great use of bricks i like the structure of it very much price 9510 an inexpensive set based on the 1994 pricing it comes with 3 minifigs shop a van and a exclusive printed piece overall 9710 i am not trying to be bias in fact this set is absoultely filled with minimum flaws look at my review again if you are not satisfied with it or tell me what you dont like i gave it a 5 based on my review score card what about yours hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine comments and critics are strongly welcomed pictures can be found in my brickshelfwhen moderated	positive
easily one of the best town sets ever and pretty expensive for its size too iswas it that rare i hope i still have all the pieces from mine unfortunately my stickers are in pretty bad shape took them off because i needed the bricks stupid stickers covering multiple parts  only downside to this set the design is simple yet so detailed and the pizza van looks great 55	positive
i do like the set although i dont own it i do remember lusting after it when i was a kid though mainly because of the female minifig and the colors its a bit simplistic but comes with a few great parts you also did a great job on describing the set and the pictures give the full impression of the appearance for the review i just have to point out a few things to give you constructive criticism first of all its chef not chief entirely different professions and secondly the scale you give in the poll isnt very even above average jumps to outstanding which is a too big of a gap in my opinion you shouldve used good or great in between them but these are only minor faults this is a good review anyway	neutral
i rate it a full 5 too and i wish lego would make a set like this in 2010 a town needs pizza edit dont always trust peeron sometimes they miss some pieces and sometimes they just cant count them edited by the cobra 24 august 2008  1141 am	positive

jopiek on aug 24 2008 1048 pm said a very good set indeed we have at least 3 of them but we like them all what do you mean by we you own three sets of the orignal 1994 series or the 2002 legend series	neutral

i used to want this set so badly and i almost got it when it was rereleased i still wonder why i didnt because with a building van 5 pizzas and a then very rare female fig this set would have been perfect for someone with a smaller collection like i had then what surprised me the most is how well this set still holds up to others today off to bricklink	positive

do you mean this one httpwwwbricksetaspxset29621  i would also like to get that alone for the fact that its the only resq set with a female fig	neutral
i have this set and its pretty nice i love the resq theme in general i think that tow truck is easily the highlight of this set and is probably the best such vehicle ive seen in any city set the other vehicles are also great the base itself is lacking though as it basically consists of one room that doesnt even have side walls it does include a cool 3x6 computer sticker and a vast array of minifig tools and equipment though i have some plans to modify the building and make it larger but have never gotten around to doing it	positive

hi everyone this is my first review on lego sets here hope you guys like it and i would like to apologise for the bad quality pictures hope you guys dont mind first i will start with the box art box art i guess this is the first time that lego star wars sets use white and blue colour for their box i like the new colour scheme a nice blend though heres the front the back not to waste space on the box lego do some advertisement to attract us to buy more sets grinthe more the side at the top side there is this minifigs scale picture it is great as we get to know the real size of a minifigs contents the contents consist of a sticker sheet instruction book and 8 packet of bricks the packer are not numbered but it is ok as there is not much pieces instruction book and random page as usual the instruction book have brick checklist other sets pictures and tutorial on how you should assemble your set i mean the very first page sticker sheet there is not much sticker sheet and is a great news that the republic logo on the round plate is printed unlike republic gunship anyway i didnt apply the stickers the commander gear this is a new thing to minifigs as well well is like batman accessories they pack it in one small packet however you only get one commander gear pack in this set anyway i didnt use them the minifigs well we get the the new minifigs the ugly face clone new printed torso and new mold of helmet however i not really like the new head stud i prefer a black one or at least the one like jango fett black colour with face the helmet everything is printed no holes at the visor there but there are hole on the both side this new helmet mold also made the headgear turn 360 degree freely without helmet with helmet you can see the flesh tone at the hole beside the blasters  short blasters were given instead of long one is great at least they give us two blasters instead of one the tank here is the pics of the tank it was not badly design nor nicely design but it looks great if you didnt saw the beneath or under the tank view from front view from side view from back whats beneath under it was 4 wheels to make it move fluently it is made by the thread supporter like the one we fet from tie crawler or battank the functions well firstly you can open up the hood i guess to see the engine secondly the side cannon that can move upwards the thing is quite tight see random instruction page and there is barrier to block the cannon from going downwards the cockpit well the cockpit is small and the space is limited the monitor stuff is printed brick and is another great news you have to remove the piece pic below to reveal the cockpit and put your clone to pilot it popup gunner mechanism well the backdoor have a thing to attack to the seat of the gunner the top hatch is very loose so it there is a clone as a gunner and you open the back door the clone will popup and automatically open the hatch on top this is how the top looks like without a clone there is this movable cannon upwards left and right and a little keyboard thing with it but the cannon fall off quite easily the flick launching missile mechanism the mechanism is on both side and you need to turn the thing inwards to reveal the flick fire mechanism below are the pic of how it is turned you can keep you blaster at the front of the side there are place for you to store them it close nicely completion this is how it looks like extra parts there quite a number of them overall this set is not bad the price is quite expensive but you will like it the popup mechanism is something new to me but this set have more function and 2 clone trooper with a pack of commander gear pros 2x clone troopers high playability nice design cons a little expensive sticker sheet cannon on top falls off quite easy edited by kimt 27 august 2008  1216 pm	positive
yes the review is great indeed i love indepth reviews with tons of photos as for the set  im not planning to buy it but it looks ok i think its a good tank	neutral
thanks for this great review baby i like the clarity of your photos and the description is well written ill try and see if i can gather the money for this one fingers crossed luxorv	neutral
bad quality pictures whats wrong with them this is a great review and thanks i was planning on buying this set and no others but the price stunned me thus i bought the atte and the rgs the set is better than i thought though i might do as mutley did and make my own	positive
thank you kimt for adding the poll hehe this is my first review so im not so confident about the pictures thank you guys for viewing and commenting	neutral
nice review i hope i can get this set as well as agents city  other sw stuff and nice pics i didnt think they were bad i thought they were pretty good	neutral
splendid photos and well written review i love it ive owned and built mine and must say its a good set and the tank dont disappointment in terms of design and playability i got mine stickered well been a perfectionist i am p thanks again for the review that it should deserved d	positive
baby i will like to take a moment to said outstanding piece of review for your first attempt you have done well with the pictures and its flow i have to admit that i love this fighter tank very much the downside of it which is overpriced and two clone troopers do not really justify the purchase well if i have the spare cash i will defintely get one of this keep it up	positive
wow this ship is really big judging from the size of its hull wondering where can i keep it when ive bought it 	positive
mattzitron on aug 13 2005 1130 pm said the strange thing is for the first time i can remember the minifigs came decapitated and theres no neckwear i recall jake saying something about it being new lego policy to supply the minifig heads and torsos separately what with the expensestrimming and all its apparently one of the many little quirky things theyve discovered in the manufacturing and packaging process that people have done for years without thinking in this case putting the heads on the torsos but that turns out to be a surprisingly significant expense timewise i suppose think it was in one of his blog posts but not sure too tired ie lazy to go hunting for it now sorry 	neutral
but does this mean that they add to the piece count is it a super secret clever way to make the piece count seem bigger than it is hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm  addition ive built it review up later tonite but heres this to wet your appetite	negative
its a shame it only comes with two figs it would be great for my ancient middleeast project	negative
thanks for the pics so far will you have highres pics of the other sets in the instructions	positive
mattzitron you have done well to display images of the dung stain hull its a darn shame that it cant be extended however i see no reason why lego couldnt produce a special middle hull piece that is compatible although the way theyve made the hull is a bit stupid the old system was a lot more flexible better still why cant lego design a hull that can be extended in length and width then they could be as made as long or wide as desired and that would be great	negative
they have made a special middle piece in this 4 set httpwwwbricksetaspxset70751 the only problem is that its red	negative
good work samsta no wonder i wasnt aware 4 pirates and all	positive
im interested in the scan of the back i have an idea for a new avatar 	positive
woohoo thanks for these pics im probably more excited about the dark red 1x4 arch than anything else i have a large project that im doing in dark red but there has only been the 1x6 arch made in that coloruntil now now to figure out how to score about a hundred of them  jeramy	positive
burnsexcellentburns i love those parts shots great stuff in there this really is a good sign for the new line hopefully therell be the same level of usefulness in the others thanks for taking the time to finish it up did you scan the back of the instructions	positive
very nice review of a set that ive been dying to get but my friendly neighborhood lego store never seems to have in stock the yellow seat is most definitely not a new piece i had two of those in my old beta1 command base almost 30 years ago	positive
thanksfor this review i also got this set recently and im very happy about it i live the design of these new trucks and the forklift is also great not to forget the good amount of cargo btw i think the mysterious cargo only are normal fuel barrels	positive
a very fine set indeed and something at least a little different to the more usual city sets sweet and it could even be a little sweeter to me with car doors well nevermind thanks for that very nice review vbbn	positive
great review i dig this set it could have only been better if it had been a 6wide version of the old 6367 semitruck still i ask whats so special about the special edition	neutral
that explains why it isnt in our local stores i also got it from sh but my box hasnt got the special edition printing on it surprisingly	neutral
nice review vbbn i stumbled upon your yellow seat as well didn´t you have one already or what made you think it´s new the big letdown on this set is the big canopy i would have preferred single bricks for that and for this truck there is no real need for a hollow canopy  it could as well have been made of solid bricks maybe we get another set with different use of the canopy this is one of the reasons i didn´t buy it so far and i´m especially not interested in another forklift i have plenty of those i agree it´s the best one we have seen so far though	positive
today i shall be reviewing 8290 mini forklift which i recieved when i went to tru to get a technic set so enjoy set name mini forklift number 8290 theme technic parts 89 price 1099 1box the box for this set is suprisingly small its about the size of a 399 set it shows the main forklift and the set information the back of the box features the dragster a very cool model and the suspension works perfectly 2contents we have two instruction booklets one for the forklift and one for the dragster the bags here are a few interesting pieces the long double pin in blue a bionicle connecter joint and a yellow l joint 3build we start off build nice and solid with your average technic build the following steps build up the detail of the bottom part next comes the cab its pretty simple yet effective after that comes the forks they work very well but if you have the palatte on them and you let go it might topple off hint put the edge of the palatte on the small lip on the pieces that connect to the forks this will hold it on better the finished product and palatte extra pieceskeep them as they are used to build the alternate model here is something that i found how to put a minifigure into the cab first remove the side doors then set the fig into the cab with his arm sticking slightly out the gap and finaly seal off the cab a nice way to put system into technic for your towns  parts 910loving them all price per part ratio 810somewhat pleaseing playability 910 works in any system town and has a great dragster alternate model overall 2630 86 b overall i would definatly recommend this set to anyone whether you are a system or technic fan this is perfect it has great parts and is pretty cheap the alternate model is also very good i hope you all enjoyed my review i have made the pictures the requested size on my camera i look forward to hearing your comments edited by vbbn 27 august 2008  0702 pm	positive
nice work vbbn im not really into technic myself but youve definately done a fine review on this set funny that it actually fits a minifig perhaps well see fans design forklifts with technic and having it minifig sized	positive
nice review the figure fitting inside is great i think the price might be a little high but you did get it from tru so what else is to be expected	neutral
what that looks like a walker an imperial walker no€ theme space blacktron i set name alienator set number 6876 number of pieces 82 figures1 released 1988 list price £99 it seem no source online has the price peeroncom bricklinkcom as always lets have a look at the box first as i€™m luck to own a boxed version of this set walking across a planet with a grid pattern sky the back shows a great selection of alternative models after opening the box we find a single instruction booklet inside the instruction booklet now we come to the man in the black visor the mark i blacktron and black and industrial he look in my opinion i think he probably has the second best lego space torso before the focus group decided they needed to be brighter now turning to the walker itself it€™s a simple build which i don€™t think even i with my great skills for messing up could get wrong the final unit is built in three key parts the command pod which is attached to the body by two pins at the back the walker legs this is pure design genius simply built easy to replicate and no fancy parts the top section which open to reveal the blacktrons hightech tools time to put the entire set together i think you€™ll agree it looks great for such a simple build looking like you could take on the universe a side view of the finished product a frontal view of the alienator what the hell how did that take down an atat this is one of my all time favourite lego space sets actually i didn€™t have it predark age and only recently bought one what attracted me to it was an old boxed set but since then i€™ve discovered a set that i wished i€™d owned long ago the rating system figures 810 i love the dark industrial space look parts 710 yes it may be nearly all black with some yellow highlights but is have a good range and they fit to make several great models fun fun fun 810 it walks well and it€™s a great set it has a large number of possible mods design 1010 it€™s ingenious the walking mechanism is so simple and yet so good i can€™t fault it price 10 while i could tell you how much i paid i was luck on ebay so this remains a question mark grand total 3340 reduced top level due to lack of price knowledge conclusion a set which in my opinion showcases what lego was about in the 1980€™s the set has an excellent design ethic and looks great with very limited parts it retains great action and functionality twinned with the great main model you€™re shown that there are a number of other great models you can make with the same parts this set is what it€™s all about for me i€™m very glad i bought outside my normal theme when i saw this actually on the strength of this set i recently order 6894 blacktron invader and can€™t wait to get it and see if it lives up to the alienator	neutral
a very original and perhaps even a little weird design indeed but nice and creative for sure thanks for that good review	positive
i loved all of these walker sets it was such a smart technique i made one myself with what i had ahhh good times thanks for the great review	positive
thanks for the review ill add it to the index the ywing is one of my favourite rebel fighters and this set justifies the coolest fighter	positive
a wonderful set and a really charming design well detailed and pretty smooth at the same time perhaps that small gap at the cockpit´s an a little weak point but we can always mod a little thanks for that very neat review cardinal brick	positive
great review the ywing is an awesome starfighter and the detail in this set is superb funnily enough i was just swooshing mine today edited by pedro 27 august 2008  0825 pm	positive
pedro on aug 27 2008 0923 pm said great review the ywing is an awesome starfighter and the detail in this set is superb funnily enough i was just swooshing mine today you mean swooshing as in swooshing for real or just plain swooshing	positive
kimt on aug 28 2008 0908 pm said youve got to be kidding the ilc is bulky and doesnt even come close to the design superiority of the ywing its smooth its beautiful and its awesomely designed by the designers at lego its got greebles man i was not talking about the looks of course the rebels have got to have nicer looking ships	neutral
csiquet on aug 29 2008 0206 am said i was not talking about the looks of course the rebels have got to have nicer looking ships dont aregue with him when it comes to ywings he offerd to swoosh one in the nude stauder	neutral

the ywing is a truly beautifull ship and lego has done a great job on this one lacking landing gear is a minus point though and nice review by the way	positive
is it worth the money since the new ywing comes out next year	neutral
siegfried on 04 september 2011  0927 am said please check the date prior to asking questions in old topics three years ago in this case its rude to expect people to answer questions like that especially since its such a generic question besides how is he supposed to answer the question without knowing a lot more about the new ywing sorry	negative
i think it is a fair to ask questions here with the expectation of a new ywing in the coming year i came here to look at the review even though it is a few years old no images to go with the review bummer id like to see a more friendly tolerance on dated threads being bumped	neutral
etav8r on 19 september 2011  0155 am said i think it is a fair to ask questions here with the expectation of a new ywing in the coming year i came here to look at the review even though it is a few years old no images to go with the review bummer id like to see a more friendly tolerance on dated threads being bumped again we know next to nothing about the new ywing it wouldnt be possible to say whether 7658 is worth the money relative to the new one until we know what the new one looks like what its minifigures look like how much it will cost etc also note that yodalikespie has been banned	negative
fallenangel309 on 19 september 2011  0201 am said again we know next to nothing about the new ywing it wouldnt be possible to say whether 7658 is worth the money relative to the new one until we know what the new one looks like what its minifigures look like how much it will cost etc also note that yodalikespie has been banned is that a threat is it fair to ban someone on the forum because they revived an old thread and made inquiries thought this was a forum to discuss lego and that is what he was prompting i dont really care why he was banned but this isnt the only time ive seen this type of behavior and discourse here on eb	negative
fallenangel309 on 19 september 2011  0343 am said not a threat at all  i was simply pointing out that yodalikespie made the mistake of inquiring about the new ywing before we had any information on it to my understanding its not so much the fact that he bumped the thread as the fact that he bumped it for no good reason im not certain where the moderators stand on this issue but i feel that yodalikespies question would have been better received had he posed it after a substantial amount of information had been gathered on 9495  as ive said there simply isnt much one can go off of at this point to determine its value relative to 7658 roger that sad that the original review pics arent available any longer would be nice once the new set is released for comparisons	neutral
maybe the thread should be locked or taken down since the pics consist of broken links kind of a pointless review without the pics and for the record there are other websites with preliminary images of some the new 2012 sets that are not on the eurobrick star wars 2012 rumors thread perhaps that banned fellow was hoping some of the lego insiders had some knowledge about it i guess well never know now edited by sharky 22 september 2011  0922 pm	negative
thanks for sharing this review with us ill add it to the index one of my favourite impulse sets along with the troll warrior or is that orc warrior	positive
nice review and i especially enjoyed the ending i personally think it is quite a good set for the price considering it comes with a fully armed minifig along with enough stuff to suit up another i just wish amazon carried this set	positive
do we really need more construction works legoland is just one huge building site theme city set name mini digger set number 7246 number of pieces 36 figures1 released 2005 list price 350 usd 7426 peeroncom 7246 bricklink catalog diving right in let get some photos of the box the digger at work the back just has more of the same not to inspiring once we open the box we find two poly bags and some instructions the total contents of the box well minus the air instruction booklet short and simple now the single minfig of the set nothing new of special that i can see …got a job working construction for the johnstown company moving onto the digger itself it’s one of those builds where all you really need is a quick glance at the instructions and off you go side view of the finished product alternative view it doesn’t look to bad now lets add our construction worker looks rather good though the lifting action isn’t smooth it’s nothing special it’s not the greatest construction set that lego have ever produced but i think it is worth the money the arm action really does bug me though the rating system figures 510 just another construction peon parts 410 nothing novel and i dislike the new digger arm system fun fun fun 710 i think the playability is high and you can get a good load of bricks in the bucket design 610 not the best designed digger but not the worst price 710 a reasonable price for what you get grand total 2950 still halfway decent but nothing to write home about conclusion this set is yet another in a long line of lego digger and to be honest it’s not the best in my opinion i still hold nostalgic memories for 6504 which i still think is a great digger from my point of view the set sits to high off the ground and make me wonder how the worker gets in i really don’t like the digging arm action it will never be smooth and while it poses better i just think it’s inferior despite this i still think it’s not a bad set i’d just like it to be so much more	negative
another fine review i love the last action picture thanks for sharing btw i am so looking forward to that 384 london bus review	positive
cardinal brick on aug 27 2008 1002 pm said …got a job working construction for the johnstown company one of the greatest songs ever written but now onto the review i really like your pictures the quality and lighting is amazing i never gave this set much attention but now it looks pretty good to me also cant wait for your next review i have never seen this bus before	positive
finaly we get a new mech for takeshi and yes its yellow it brings back some flashbacks of supernova good times anyways i recieved this set at christmas last year with 3 other ef sets set name assault tiger number 8113 pieces 163 theme exoforce year released 2008 price 1500 usd 1895 eur 1box the boxes this year are much different than those from previous years it has some gaps in it and has a cardboard backround inside of it the box itself shows assault tiger and the set information the back shows a combiner the cardboard backdrop a very nice jungle look to it it has lots of fog as well creating a pale effect 2contents the instructions the instructions are clear and straightforward also included is a lego blooper the remains of the sticker sheet the stickers arent too bad i didnt apply the saw sticker as i wanted it to be left plain the buzzsaw a very cool piece mocists will love this 3build the figures the figures included are takeshi who features a nice new torso also included is the mini robot his is a very neat little guy but sadly he doesnt really become a weapon more of a block of red and black bricks the torso now the torso design for assault tiger is very different from the past years it now uses a castlelike piece as the main structure also of note is that he has a mini throne no controls sadly and with the orange cockpit piece its impossible to see takeshi when looking at the at close on see the third pic the legs the legs are slightly similar to the mt201 ultra drill walkers but have been modified to fit the at they are quite large and suit their purpose the arms the arms follow a new design but the only problem is they have no elbow or hand articulation nice weapons though the finished product  parts 1010 lots of useful pieces great colors and some very cool new pieces minifigs 810 a robot would have been nice and a better weapon mode for the minirobot would have been good price per part 710 a stretch playability 810 the lack of elbow and wrist articulation isnt the greatest overall 3340 825 b assault tiger is a nice set but some of those small little things can truly take a toll on the final rating i think that i would only recommend this set to anyone who wants the yellow and hardcore exoforce fans sh link peeron link i hope you enjoyed the review and if you have any pic requests or questions please ask edited by sinner 01 september 2008  0152 am	positive
thanks for the review vbbn i have to say ef has never really caught my attention but this set seems alright to be honest when i saw the topic title i was expecting a tiger looking mech the mech itself is cool except for the huge leg pieces i think the minifigs are great in ef sets with the dark colored outfits like dark red or dark green	positive
this was my first exo force set and i was quite skeptical towards the mecha theme so i got it because it seemed to have nice parts it turned out however that the mechas are quite nice  i really like the poseability of it and since then i got another ef set	positive
thanks for the review one of the best sets in the entire line	positive
the assult tiger is pretty cool	positive
i just bought 2 of them since they were 5 each from lego i really wish they did not cancel this series	positive
i voted average i think this is the least attractive among the 2008 exoforce sets i saved my money to buy some of the 2006 mechas	negative
i think this is almost the best set in the exo force line i really like the orange cockpit peice	positive
thanks for the interview i nearly forgot this set is out yet maybe ill grab one off my local store tomorrow	neutral
wait a second a troll isnt that an orc i thought that this is a troll	neutral
wow i like this set but have no money to get it guess i need to be fast and get it before it was sold out	positive
nice review makes me want 3 honestly and comgratz on becoming a teacher in the reviewers academy	positive
nice review i never new trolls had fireworks at least thats what it looks like to me maybe i shall build a trollish fireworks company fireworks on	positive
im not really impressed by this set as much as other impulse sets the knight impulse set 5615 offers more in my opinion since it gives two helmets two weapons a shield and an armor piece along with the weapon rack im not a fan in the slightest of flickfire missles and projectiles like on the cart and the previously mentioned one piece axle limits the wheel usage in other mocs i wouldve liked to see an added chest armor piece at the very least and a shield wouldve made this great those things are so rare and it wouldve bumped the piece count up to 21 to match the knight set since both are showing the same price on shin us dollars at least it wouldve made sense	negative
thank you for the nice review the set is not that bad but a shield would be a nice addition i also dont like the flickfire missile a camp site with a fire and a chickenleg would also be nice about the rat isnt it just foodsupply for the troll the only problem would than be that the food is running away	negative
more firefighter there must be a pyromaniac in legoland somewhere theme city set name firefighter set number 5613 number of pieces 25 figures1 released 2008 list price £200 gbp 350 usd 299 euro 5613 peeroncom 5613 bricklink catalog 5613 shop at home starting as always with the box i didn’t know red cylinders were flammable interestingly an action shot and not other sets you might like to buy the contents of the box looks much like every other impulse set firefighter not sure there’s much else to say apart from i wish they’d included breathing equipment looking pretty pleased with himself if you ask me the equipment rack is fairly standard and easy to build it does however include a fire hydrant inbuild shot will i be able to finish this complex build unsurprisingly i did i nice selection of kit is provided all together i think the fire is a bit odd but it does add playability if you want to increase the number of your firefighter and their equipment this is a great way though there is something missing in my mind the rating system figures 510 fairly standard i already have a fair few parts 610 good selection of tools but lacks the breathing apparatus i’d expect in a set like this fun fun fun 510 there’s clearly something to do even if you just own this set design 510 not going to win any awards but it’s robust price 810 nothing to complain about you get a lot of accessories for the price grand total 2950 reasonable design and good accessories a good set to improve any fire department conclusion this isn’t a set i’d necessarily buy but while i was at bluewater today i decided i should try to review every impulse set myself so that why i bought it still i think it has some good playability and a good set of accessories if you need more firefighting kit i just can’t get passed the lack of breaking apparatus that would have made it a better set in my view	negative
quote if you want to increase the number of your firefighter and their equipment this is a great way though there is something missing in my mind whats missing	neutral

cardinal brick on aug 28 2008 0636 pm said fairly standard mission mars spaceman he’s got printing front and back but sadly no air tank how does he breath parts 610 lots of white and not much orange but where’s the air tank as you said he has printing on the back if you look closley you wil lsee a tank printed on his back with oxygen written on it stauder	neutral
i wasnt all that impressed with what you get in this set for the price but you have an interesting point that the robot can be considered a reference to the classic space bots makes me think i ought to try modding the robot later	negative
nice review and quite funny now ill never turn my back on a robot again poor set i find this set bad even for an impulse the robot is poorly designed and without any use the space minifig is ok id rather get another impulse set than this except the other life on mars mars mission impulse sets	negative
something i forgot to mention is that great review xenologer on aug 28 2008 0828 pm said makes me think i ought to try modding the robot later mod the robot why you should see the interior stauder	neutral
this here was a set that i new i had to get a beautiful minfig amazing minfigs what more could you want so was this set worth it i guess you will just have to read the review to find out set name the batcycle harley quinns hammer truck number 7886 pieces 267 theme batman year 2008 price 3500 usd 4496 euro 1box the new box art for batman is pretty stunning its clean and really sells the set for this set harley quinns truck is pictured attacking batman with the set information the back of the box shows a nice little comic the other sets as well as the set functions 2contents the instructions the instructions for the set are as always clear and straightforward they display the colors well and have what we expect in an instruction book 3build minifigs the stars of the set batman is back with a new torso much more metalic than before harley had all new printed torso legs a new head and that sweet new hat batcycle the bottom part is very sturdy thanks to a small bit of technic the red throws it off a bit but it isnt seen once the top part is put on it has a nice use of the smoke stacks and looks very nice in the end the top part is simple but suits the purpose well it has handle bars and a nice motor the blue is a little strange though hammer truck the hammer truck begins with a very sturdy base it has lots of detail and really looks cool rims added lego did a very nice job at giving it a checker board appearence the only problem here is that you stick a sticker over two bricks multiple times jewels inside of the crate are these shining jewels look how they illuminate the darkness in gotham more added then we add on a spoiler and the crate looking very nice now the detail is again outstanding and it has a good amount of smoothness to it the infamous hammer okay i havent said this yet but the square pieces need to stop first on those sw backta tanks now on the hammer it creates a sloppy look for the hammer still this is the ultimate wacking weapon added to the truck on the truck it works pretty well but the handle is to short and its near impossible to smash batman the finished truck the finished truck is really nice the big wheels give it the monster truck feel and the way that lego alternated the colors works well the cockpit is a little palin but thats not a major issue the i love joker sticker is one of the best stickers ive seen its simply a classic the finished set  parts 910 lots of good mocing pieces and red and black are always usefull minifigs 1010 awesome playability 910 the hammer is a little short priceperpart 810 its a liscensed theme so meh set 7886 is a very nice set and has some great details in it the minifigs are very cool as well however their are some flaws first the hammer is two short and is kind of square the batcycle has a few awkward colors in it which throws it off a bit this set is definatly worth the money batman fans will love it and also wacking fans will like it for that hammer and if you would like to buy this set here are a few useful links sh link peeron link please let me know your comments and pic requests and questions are welcome	positive
cool i also like the sticker on the back of jokers ice cream truck that says i love gotham	positive
great review hmm i notice that the leg of that old guy is not so perfect perhaps you want to push it	neutral
nice review i really want this set but i think the €35 here is too much more like €25 would suit and havent found it cheap enough on ebay yet incl shipping	negative
very good informative review i really want this set but i never got around to buying it i thought all of your photos are great and of good quality keep it up	positive
i love this set indy is what got me back into lego	positive
i discovered this review a month ago and since that point in time i could not get the image of the sparkling golden chest out of my mind i finally just purchased the chest for myself i suppose this is a testament to how well honed your picture taking skills are this set is definitely a nice one im not a lego indy collector but i was tempted to purchase this set several times the vehicles are very nicely detailed and have some cool building techniques such as the wheel guards	positive
very good review	positive
i keep looking at this set to buy since i have 3 10 cards now maybe i will go pick it up at the lego store next month so many things i want	neutral
great review i was debating on whether or not to snag this up before its gone and i think i will great review and thanks again	positive
welcome to another sunny day in legovilletoday we will be joining the mailman on his daily route delivering the days mail when i first saw this set i immiediately liked iti think tlg should make more of these everyday life type sets such as delivering mail going to the grocery store things like that anyway enough blabbering on to the review 7731 mail van set name 7731 mail van year 2008 theme city pieces 66 price 799 pounds 499 euros 595 price per piece about 12 cents well start with the box shots the box is an interesting shape that i have never seen before very rectangular the box art is pretty nice the back shows the mailman delivering some mail the picture on the front is the same as on the box random manual shot the manual does not have the piece call outs but on a small set like this i dont feel its needed parts list decent selection of parts i really like the mail pieces image at the back of the manual showing all of the cargo sets together in a little scene i like it when the manuals have images like these because its nice to see all of the sets together all of the parts spread out the parts in this set are pretty good unfortunatly the car base is one large piece however we do get 2 printed mail pieces which are always nice our trusty mailman this torso i think is very nice the little envelope is a nice touch extra parts not much to say here the finished set i really like the design of the van it looks very smooth and somehow looks very lego to me the colors are my favorite part the red and yellow look nice together a nice mailbox however i wish the letter on the front was printed the front of the van is nice i think the textured brick on the front gives it a different look on the front which is nice the back of the van the doors open to store mail although it doesnt have much room i like that they included this feature delivery the mail bricks slide right into the hole at the front this adds nice playability the vans all loaded up we are ready to deliver  parts 710 pretty good piece selection but for 8 should have included a few more playability810 its fun to deliver the mail to all of your towns residents design 910 the design is very nice except i feel that some of the stickered parts could have been printed overall 2430 after a long hard day of delivering mail theres nothing like enjoying a nice pizza and letting your hair out why do they make us wear those silly hats anyway this is a nice set that i can definitely recommend and i think tlg should certainly release a post office to go with this and the air mail set i really like these everyday life sets rather than always fighting crime or putting out fires those guys have normal lives too brickshelf folder httpwwwbrickshelrycgif338718	positive
this set is nice it looks like a dhl van	positive
legoman132 on aug 29 2008 0335 pm said this set is nice it looks like a dhl van funny thats what i thought when i first saw the pics good review btw oh and i keep meaning to get this set but keep forgeting	positive
its a good set but i think the first sticker shouldnt say 7731	positive
its an ok set i just dont really like the look of the van much too rounded for my liking what happened to the box like cars	negative
thanks for that very nice review erdbeereis1 it´s great to see some other city sets beside the usual hospital police and firefighter mayhem and this is a really nice little one now give me some car doors and a kevin costnerlike mf and i´m a happy camper indeed tlc	positive
nice review i like this little set some how it reminds me now of postman pat in dutch pieter post an english childrens tv series about a postman in a little village somewhere in yorkshire aah sweet memories i would rather have seen a postoffice released with some women minifigs instead of the green post bigplane but maybe in a couple of years	positive
i do like the set also ive bought 2 of them one to build it up and one to keep it misb i dunno for how long  only poor things is that the wheels are too wide car is 5nops wide instead of 4 afterall a good design i wonder if theres a post office coming soon by the way great review	positive
rriggs on aug 31 2008 0255 am said i actually like the use of the old style car base and mourned the day that these became exitinct the first time round c1990 i dont hate the piece but i did object to the way this set fills in the middle recessed area with a 2 x 2 plate that is nearly impossible to get out again without doing some damage to it whats more if you fill in the recessed area youve eliminated the only rationale for using the car base in the first place	negative
welcome to another sunny day in lego city the sun is shining the birds are singing minifigs are drowning wait what the coast guard rushes to the scene and deploys the coast guard 4wd  jet scooter to save the poor minifig from drowning lets take a look at the coast guards buggy 7737 coast guard 4wd  jet scooter set info set name 7737 coast guard 4wd  jet scooter theme citycoast guard released 2008 price 999 usd995 eur799 gbp pieces 130 minifigs 1 price per piece about 8 cents now the review the box here is the front it shows a nice image of the buggy on the beach with the ocean in the background the back the back shows some of the features in the set such as the extra equipment manual the picture on the manual is the same as on the box as usual the parts the set has great colors i love how the orange blue and white look together the part selection is quite good but unfortunately uses the large car base coast guard minifig this is a great fig the torso print is very nice and matches the buggys colors well new tire mold here are the new tires they look very good inmanual shot color separation is not a problem here and since it is a small set the piece call out is not a necessity extra parts it is always nice to get extra cheese slopes the finished set the design of the trailer and jetski is great the jetski is very smooth looking and the color scheme is fantastic the sticker on the roof is nice but its actually too big for the piece the corners of the sticker flap where the piece curves jetski closeup here you can see how it attaches to the trailer i didnt add the sticker that goes on the front which is a little sign that says bb03 or something attaching the trailer this is where the trailer connects to the main car it attaches simply with a ball joint car front view the license plate is a nice sticker and the top lights look nice say cheese driver the back the back is very similar to the front it has the same sticker the equipment rack a very welcome addition to the set it adds quite a bit of playability the orange fins are great all decked out he looks pretty spiffy in his diving suit doesnt he brickshelf folder the ratings price 1010 you cant get much more in here for 10 parts 910 nice selection and great colors the big car base is a bit annoying design 910 the jetski is a prime example of something with a small amount of pieces that still looks amazing playability 910 you can drive the car go diving and jetski across the bay minifig 710 the one it comes with is great but it could have come with one more perhaps a citizen of some sort build 810 simple but looks great overall 4250 lego sh brickset peeron bricklink even in the face of danger this member of the coast guard always has a smile on his face summary simply put for 10 you have to buy this set it is one of the better sets in this price range you can buy and one of the best small city sets the colors are great the design is great and the fig is great i dont normally think small sets are worth heavy praise but this one definitely deserves it thanks and happy building	positive
i am not a fan of citytowntrainstuff but this is a very good review that almost makes me wish i had the time read money to purchase some of the coastguard sets	positive
a very good review of an especially charming and lovely set thanks the whole cg theme looks very nice to me with a good and detailed set design and this one´s no exception although it would be nice to see more car doors and some new mf faces though	positive
thanks for this review i was thinking of getting this set and having read your review went out today and got it what a great little set what i particularly like very sturdy build feels very solid as you build the pickup compared to the fire pickup  trailer i also have the orange pieces my first pieces in this colour the tyres which give the smoothest ride of any lego towncity vehicle ive ever built the raised suspension and side runners the coast guard dude again a first for me and his megacool flippers and aqualung the jetski controls  the handlebars actually move left to right which is a great detail little details that lego didnt have to do the grey handle by the ball joint moving handlebars the new tyres as you can probably guess i have voted outstanding for this set erdbeereis1 on aug 29 2008 0602 am said color separation is not a problem here and since it is a small set the piece call out is not a necessity you do get a piece call out with this set i did anyway its on the back of the small poster that is included in the set thanks again cheers rog edited by rriggs 02 september 2008  0253 pm	positive
rriggs on sep 2 2008 0850 am said you do get a piece call out with this set i did anyway its on the back of the small poster that is included in the set i meant the piece call outs during the build that show which pieces you need for that step and cardinal brick im not quite sure what you mean but i cetainly think that this jetski is wonderful	positive
i agree that this is a very good looking set i just finished building mine yesterday and i love it but here is one suggestion trim the large sticker that goes on the roof of the vehicle by cutting along the angles at the front of the sticker if you use it as it is it will extend beyond the flat surface of the roof and will overlap the lower sections past experience with stickers has suggested that this sticker will lift at the front corners lego stickers are probably the best that there are but sometimes modifications must be made now i want that large coast guard helicopter 7738	positive
nice set nice review i already have one coastguard set that truck but i like the idea very much however the rigid inflatables could be much improved see the real ones at wwwrnlicouk or wwwknrmnl	positive
great review of a great set one question how does the robotarmpiece connect to the jetski	positive
it gets placed on top of this piece	neutral
the coast guard sets are very eye catching the color scheme is making me want to pick up the entire line although the offshore platform hasnt been released stateside yet ive had my eye on this particular set for a few weeks now and is near the top of my to buy list with instructions provided on legocom i build a dr infero version of the jet ski to replace the one used in mission 2 swamp raid its a very sturdy design bulky enough to make it feel like a real vehicle great review too thankyou for the closer look at the set	positive
arrgh me hearties lets join the pirates as they try to steal the sacred treasure from the islanders hands it wont be easy king kahuka and his loyal warriors closely guard the treasure 24 hours a day will the pirates with their trusty pistols and cutlasses be able to defeat the islanders spears pet alligator and powerful leafy skirts we will find out 6262 king kahukas throne set info set name 6262 king kahukas throne theme piratesislanders released 1994 price  i dont know the original price i got it from bricklink with no box for 17 unfortunately i was not able to locate the euro or pounds price pieces 123 minifigs 5 off we go unfortunately i dont have the box because i didnt like the idea of spending over 50 for a set with under 200 pieces so sorry no box pics instructions i think the image on the front is very good it seems less setup somehow than the instructions these days it looks more like someone snuck up on them while they were going about their duties and snapped away rather than something that was planned the parts a nice selection here there is a pretty good amount of printed pieces in this set which is always nice for example the zebra print tile as well as the pirate flag nowadays would almost certainly be stickered the set also comes with a nice dark grey burp and a red boat for the pirates the minifigs the main buying point of this set for me were the minifigs this set comes with 5 of them which is quite good for a small set like this especially when compared to the sets of today the set comes with 1 alligator 2 pirates 2 islander warriors and king kahuka himself i really like the islanders torso and leg prints the leafy skirts are a nice touch and the makeup on the faces is superb some parts i liked these shields have a nice design on them and i always like the treasure chests a picture inside the manual this is a feature that i liked in the manual it shows an overhead view of the baseplate so its much easier to find where to put the piece i certainly could have used this feature in last years aquabase invasion set a closeup of the king the face print is nice i wonder who kahukas makeup artist is the finished set first the pirates boat the boat is really nice the sail is made out of a nice cloth and connects simply to the mast and now the main part of the set the throne this is a really nice model i think the colors and the design make it really feel like a different part of the lego world the rock sculpture looks fantastic as well the throne which is sort of a stretcher thing attaches here it connects on a 1x2 tile with a stud in the middle for easy removal here is the treasure that the pirates seek the treasure rests on tiles inside of the rock the zebra print tribal drum this is simple but nice one thing thats great about this which i mentioned earlier is that this and all of the other pieces with designs on them are printed thats right no stickers to be found here i have used these zebraprint tiles many times for mocs as they make a great exotic detail piece the lovely rock head i think this is wonderful it really adds a lot to the set it is well built with grey slopes curved pieces for the mouth and nose headlight bricks for the eyes and feathers and horns for detail the backside the complete set overall this looks great in my opinion with great landscaping and some fun parts well it looks like the pirates walked all over the islanders and stole their treasure in fact it looks like it was pretty brutal brickshelf folder now for the the ratings price 810 for 17 not a great price per piece value but when you add 5 figs in it makes it a decent price plus this set hasnt been in stores for 14 years so that adds some cost parts 910 the set has some really nice printed parts as well as a baseplate which in my opinion is great design 910 no flaws that i can think of right away the rock face is very well built playability 810 not really anything to play with although you can sail the ship and steal the treasure build 910 rock face uses nice techniques and the rest of the set is simple but looks good minifigs 1010 the minifigs are just fantastic great prints and just overall fun overall 5360 bricklink entry peeron brickset it looks like the pirates have picked up a new recruit from the island summary the older lego sets have a really different look to them than the new sets and i think its nice to have a mix of new and old this is definitely a great set with a nice build and great minifigs add to this the great printed pieces and that old pirate charm and you get a very nice set that i can certainly recommend thanks and happy building edited by erdbeereis 17 august 2009  0239 am	positive
erdbeereis1 ive had a quick look your review and i must say its quite superb im dead tired so im going to take a nap but ill be back later to read it more thoroughly	neutral
i had to vote outstanding on this set because it simply is great minifigs a cool head sculpture and a nice little boat means unlimited playability great review though man	positive
as ive already said somewhere on this forum this is the largest islander set i own and therefore my favourite thankyou for your great review i picked mine up for only 5 pounds along with crocodile cage and king kahuka but i cant help you with the original price i would search the web but im too tired right now	positive
great review well done for sure i love these reviews of old set and this one is especially unique i must agree with you the color scheme is magnificent makes me want to go to ebay and buy it now to bad for spongebob though he got in with a real bad crowd	positive
excellent review i want this set now	positive
another very nice review and im glad to see it has some nice pieces as well as characters too looks to me that no one on bl has it in australia for sale so i may pass on this beauty though i did pick up king kahuka recently he makes an appearance in my medium entry	neutral
17 for an old set is good i may hunt for it on ebay 	neutral
an outstanding set because who doesnt love islanders outstanding review as well	positive
an outstanding set too bad that i couldnt get this set set when it came out 	positive
well for some weird reason i missed this before so i tell you now very good review as we are used of you erdbeereis1 i like all the islander sets and own quite a few myself for people that dont own any of the islander sets yet the 6262 king kahukas throne is a great way to start lots of minifigs and accessories	positive
well this is a not so old set and i bet most of you already have it so here is another review from me as usual let us start off with the box art box art i like the box art they put a nice background for the atap at the side we have the minifigs scale and at the back there is the function shown and advertisement for other set the content the content is consist of 6 packets of bricks and a instruction book yeap no sticker sheet instruction book the instruction books not only show us the steps but also show us all a clear pictures of the january release sets and some sets show with their function well this includes the atap functions as well besides there are bricks checklist as well and the how do you start off before assemble your sets and a little poster where the clones with their atap battling the droids heres a random page new pieces to me i never see both of this piece before so i assume it is a new pieces anyone have any idea is there any other sets that contains this piece the blasters we are given a 2 long blasters which is great which i it is more accurate as most of the clone troopers use a long blaster the minifigs the minifigs is 2 shock trooper but is different with 7655 clone troopers battle packss shock trooper the leg is different in colour we are given white hip while the one in the battle pack are given a black hip furthermore we get a new printed headgear which i think they have improve it check out the mouth printing the colour is brighter so here is the headgear the headgear limit itself from turning to the side this is because the front part it is too low until it block by the torso the shock troopers without helmet on we are given a black stud no face printed how i wish that i have extra with helmet on comparison with shock troopers from battle pack the atap heres the atap it looks ugly at a certain angle and looks great in a certain angle anyway i still like the set i like the walker vehicle below are the pictures taken randomly top view side view without stabilizer leg with stabilizer leg rear view the functions well the functions are not so impressive just something turning around open here and there the only function that is say as special is the retractable stabilizer leg the cockpit the cockpit can fit two clone troopers but too bad we are only given two and is not enough as there is no gunner on top inside it there is a guns holders which can hold two guns but fall off easily when you are trying to remove the guns well the other side have some speedometre thing and a controller to reveal the cockpit you have to open the top hatch look below so you can see whats inside oops the side hatch and back hatch as well open and close i think this pieces is use not to let you open the hatch but to make some design i mean make it able to move inside with clones beneath so this is the pieces that hold the stabilizer leg when is not in use this is how the stabilizer leg move at last and of course the revealing cockpit from below and at the back guess the droids have alternative way to take this things down faster the leg there are pieces blocking the leg to go to the front i mean overhead and lose balance the base in not movable the side armor the side armor has door and this is how it is attach it is very flimsy when you want to adjust it to be a little steep to creat the shape they might just fall off so it is connected to the body with just a technic pin and to hold it properly here is the support the side hatch it open and close easily very loose nothing to hold it tight heres some view when the side hatch is open the cannon the cannon on top is movable and adjustable the big cannon can move up and down while the smaller one can cove sideways but the smaller one tend to lose balance when it is without minifigs means the one on top and below will not b align this is the pieces that only enable it to move up and down to prevent it from moving freely lego put two pieces to block it completion i try to make the sets looks great i think this angle is right spare parts it is so few compare with 7673 magna guard starfighter and it is more expensive overall this set is not really a good set the hatch is quite flimsy top and the side since there is nothing to hold them tight besides it is lack of one clone but to complete your walker collection you must have it pros no sticker needed new improved headgear long balsters cons lack of clone flimsy expensive as few pieces are given hope you guys like it edited by kimt 30 august 2008  1201 pm	neutral
i do not like the fact that the clones have pure white legs it looks weird to me it was also weird that they included shock troopers but it was probably a way to get people to buy it this set also seems like one of those that was kind of thrown in with a mix of other sets like the tie crawler i never picked it up and with the new clone wars sets out i wont	negative

i agree the pure white legs are odd as is the inclusion of shocks instead of pilots or regulars or maybe even kashykk troopers that might have been better	negative

technic rotation joint disc set list its used in 10 different sets so far not exactly a new piece a nice review with many good comments i really like this set its one of the walkers with really good design and a lot of playability its the usual issue of using too many technic pieces to make a moveable feature versus minifigscaled design the same issue concerns for example the atat the twilight and the atte plus more sets what annoys me in this set is the use of the 2 tan 4x8 plates they stick out and it would have been better if they the designers had used dark grey or light grey plates also ill add this to the inventory  now	positive

i could have gotten this set if i wanted to but it seemed like a waste of money to me i dont like the shock troopers helmets that much i feel they should have printed visors instead of cut out ones like they have in my opinion it would make it look a lot better the at ap itself sounds like it has a lot of holes in its cockpit which drags the set down and make it seem like they havent exactly put a lot of effort into it great review	negative

alakazam the good wizard is the wisest minifig in all of legoland he is a master of the wand and can see the future with these abilities he helps the knights predict where the trolls will strike next because this set is not in stores in the us i was luckily able to buy this set on my vacation to germany it is interesting that it is a euro exclusive 5614 the good wizard set info set name 5614 the good wizard theme castle released 2008 price eur 295gbp 199 pieces 16 minifigs 1 the review unfortunately i dont have the box because in got smushed in my suitcase on the plane so needless to say it was not in top condition the manual the manual is an extremely small foldout but the image on the front is nice on the back of the manual there is a picture of some of the 2008 impulse sets this is a nice feature the parts for an impulse set this has a pretty good selection a very nice owl and an interesting clear ball piece all built this set took me forever to build i had to take numerous breaks as it was the toughest longest build i have ever faced for an impulse set this actually looks pretty good the owl perch is nice also the crystal ball table the wizard is a very nice fig with great printing on the legs and hat and i love his beard brickshelf gallery the ratings price 810 not bad but i feel that impulse sets are slightly overpriced parts 710 impulse sets are focused around the minifig but the parts in this set are pretty good design 710 the crystal ball is a good idea and the owl perch is simple but nice playability 610 there is not much to play with here build 810 as i said before it took forever really it took all of 1 minute minifig 1010 the wizard is fantastic overall 4660 bricklink lego sh brickset abracadabra blades of four you are now a dinosaur summary for an impulse set this is very nice the wizard is an excellent fig and getting an animal in a cheap set is always great i would definitely recommend this set thanks and happy building	neutral
thanks for the review i love this impulse set i bought two of them so i could make a wizard and his apprentice i didnt have an owl either so an extra is pretty cool and i like the trans globe piece batbrick away	positive
the next in my attempt to review every impulse set single handed theme space mission mars set name alien jet set number 5617 number of pieces 21 figures1 released 2008 list price £199 gbp 350 usd 299 euro 5617 peeroncom 5617 bricklink catalog 5617 shop at home as always we begin outside of the box it looks rather exciting at first glance set that cost a lot more than this one now for what€™s inside the contents of the box the impulse sets never look that inspiring now for the alien i have to say i€™m not impressed i€™m not a big space fan and i only bought this due to my impulse review challenge but as the main point of the impulse sets is the alien is a little hard to build a good set round something with one point or articulation it lacks what make lego minfigs so great their articulation now for the space vehicle as always with impulse a short and easy build ensues took maybe 2 mins at the most time to mount the alien in his craft the craft looks a little wide for him slightly better from this angle but still not winning any awards i€™m disappointed of the impulse sets i€™ve reviewed so far this is clearly the weakest of them but what really disappointing is the other seem so good and useful the rating system figures 310 the alien is not a good minfig parts 610 some interesting parts but nothing that special fun fun fun 210 i can€™t think of anything to do with this set to be honest design 410 poorly designed the box makes it look much better price 610 despite the impulse price tag i€™m still unhappy about the price grand total 2150 less than half marks the lowest i€™ve given so far conclusion in many ways i€™m annoyed from the outside of the box this set looks quite interesting and certainly appears to be well designed the idea of a small alien fighterflying craft is in my opinion a good one but sadly when you€™ve got the finished product in your hand it looks nothing like the box art while i think mission mars had some interesting sets and i might still get some of them this one will not be a repeat purchase for me	negative
well set out review with alot of great content gotta ask you though how does the set look nothing like the box art with so few pieces id have thought one could mentally put it together given the box front	neutral
i’m not a great communicator but what i was trying to say was that on the box the sets looks quite exciting and well made and that the alien fits much more snugly than it does so i was a bit disappointed that it seemed wider and less compact and certainly less exciting when i opened it	negative
well now we at least know that we can avoid that set  johan	negative
worst set of the year worst set of all time the pictures say it all no ratings necessary a waste of paper for box and instructions and waste of plastic for bag and jelly alien the little alien ship that comes with the switch fighter beats this one hands down as well as any other lego spaceship i have ever seen and i have seen many thankfully this set isnt available in my country which is something i never thought i would say anyway i hope tlg makes these awful jelly aliens disappear forever after this year	negative
thanks for this review as for the set well i am not to crazy about this set but i want some sort of small alien fleet vehicals and this would work well but i would rather ave my money to buy classic town edited by vbbn 01 september 2008  0248 am	negative
to be honest i am going to give this set a 1 that is my lowest rating i will ever give to a set in eurobricks in fact this is the only impulse set which i do not have it at all after looking at your wonderful review i am going to give it a 2 and actually consider it to buy at least one to complete the entire impulse set series i dont really like the design and the alien at all in fact i prefer the mars mission astronaunt more than the aliens i dont really like the set but i like your review	negative
i already dont liked the aliens but if the fighter was better i would already bought him now i will maybe buy one of it just for the 2 limegreen pieces	negative
i rated this poor due to the fact the set is unimaginative looks like a bunch of plates where thrown together and it just isnt worth the money lego is asking for it imo ive never been a fan of the nonarticulated jellies so ill leave my disgust for them out of this post however unlike the set the review is a fine work of art that clearly depicts the goods and provides valuable insightopinions about the sets playability usefulness and overall value	positive
impluse sets are made good by using parts well and minifigs this has either i give a low score i really dislike the alien figs worst lego fig ever	negative
cardinal brick on aug 30 2008 0623 pm said the question is what could you do with this set i mean it’s just spacemen in a line what could you do the possibilities are endless 1 you can stand them in a line 2 stand them in a circle 3 stand them in a square 4 sit them all down 5 sit some of them down and leave some standing up adult supervision may be necessary for tfols attempting this one 6 take them all apart and scatter the pieces like some kind of huge space mine has gone off 7 yeah ok thats probably enough for now seriously i love all the sets of minifigs from all the different themes and this is a great one i always wanted them when i was a kid but never did my focus always was on town sets petrol stations and police sets please stand up and there was never enough pocket money left over for space sigh you are so lucky to have this great set thanks for sharing cheers rog	positive
thanks for the review the latter space minifig sets were great as they gave a nice variety of men id love this one	positive
7670 hailfire tank and spider droid number of pieces 249 number of minifigs 4 price 1999 usd 2599 eur 1999 gbp brickset hello everyone today i will review the extremely underrated hailfire tank and spider droid set i hope this review does it justice so lets start with the box note this picture is not mine standard box for star wars in that time the background on the box looks like its from geonosis indicating that this set is from episode ii and not iii or the clone wars the back of the box not shown shows the playability functions and some other sets that were released at the same time as this overview here is an overview of the whole set it comes with one construction manual and no sticker sheets   this is a very simple set but with not much to it it is still a very important part of the cis army especially if you are interested in army building i like to call this set a super battle pack and youll find out why soon lets get right to it and look at the feature of the set the hailfire tank front a front view of the very cool tank here you can see two triangular shields on the hull the main body is very simple but altogether very effective and clever and making it really look like a hailfire tank although a little bit sized down from its movie version the transred stud used as the eye makes the tank look more menacing side the side view the wheels are very easy to make but its a real pain to connect all of those chain links together i dont see what you could use the links for except for another tank but maybe someone creative will find something for these the dark tan is nice though the wheels are held on by technic poles and the tank rolls on the wheels fairly well on carpet or a hard surface back this is the back of the tank here you can see eight flickfire missiles four on each side of the new type so they dont easily fall out also note the modified 2x2 with extended hole piece sticking out of the back this may be used to easily push around the tank i just wish you could fit a droid in the body for the cockpit now we move on to the spider droid or what i like to call the dwarf spider the front this one is also simple but very cleverly built the main body is two semispheres connected together for rotation and an antenna a cannon four legs and eyes made out of a useful telephone piece the picture speaks for itself as far as how the gun and eyes are built side a side view you can now see the legs better which are more sturdy then you would think each one is made out of two pearl bronze exoforce robot arms a useful bley handgun piece and a dark bley battle droid body all connected to the under body a big knoblike piece back the back not much to say here i like this spider droid because it is very sturdy and the legs are easy to adjust finally we look at the minifigs there are four minifigs in this set which is quite generous for a set of this size it comes with a yellow battle droid commander i really like this one two battle droids and a super battle droid all three battle droids have the new blaster pistols and one twisted arm thats about it for the review so here is the final verdict build 810 very fun and easy besides the chain links should take the seasoned builder less than 20 minutes playability 710 the flickfire missiles are fun as well as just zooming around the tank could use some clones for a battle swooshability 810 you can roll around the hailfire fairly well minifigs 910 a generous amount of figs and all are pretty good design 9510 a really simple and clever set although a little too small for the movie version price 1010 a very fair price considering the priceperparts ratio and the coolness of the set overall score 8510 a very neat set to have a great army builder and great for display next to all of the other cis sets the price is fair the figs are good and the build is very clever thats all for now folks please feel free to give some feedback edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0308 am	positive
thanks for sharing this review with us i think this one of the sets in europe this thing is waaaay overpriced and thus makes it a crappy set we pay nearly double the us price so i rated it poor also because the figs included does not make it great the hailfire is well designed and looks great but thats just about all there is worthy of a positive mentioning sorry on a side note as a bronzeawarded student wheres the price in eur and gbp and wheres the poll nevermind the poll ive added that one for you 	negative

thanks for the review jimbutcher i really like that set it combines interesting and good design with some awesome cool parts and a neat amount of charm	positive
great review i agree that this set is underrated the hailfire is supposed to be a little taller than two battle droids so scalewise its nice the dwarf spider droid is amazing in my opinion i just wish it wasnt brown it makes me feel like its on geonosis we never saw a grey varient of the hailfire so its fine with me that its brown	positive
this is a great set i have 2 of them now and i plan to get more it is much better than the droid battle pack for 10 bucks more you get better battle droid arms and some canon vehicles good enough for me	positive
thanks for the review is a great one this set is not really a good set but i like the spider droid the hailfire droid scale is not right i think it is suppose to be even bigger anyway this is the first set that rerelease the commander droid so i grab it	negative
i just bought this set the other day and i must admit that it gets a below average from me the price is not corresponding with what you get which would be implied had jim added the eur or gbp price in the infohint hint  the spider droid is flimsy at best making it stand or even move without tumbling over is hard also why the brown cylinders on the legs keep the colourscheme clean please the figs are fine except that i dislike the clone headgear and the fact that the helmets now have holes in the sides allowing the flesh head to show within  goofy looking i am soo replacing the clone heads with black ones great review of an acceptable set	negative

this is polar1 over its day 5 at arctic research base 76 we are experiencing radio difficulties since discovering a number of strange radioactive arctic life forms which seem to be effecting our signal over we have encountered a large polar bear which by all account appears to be friendly and playful our food supply however has diminished quickly and we have to venture north from the base to a frozen lake in search of fish our cordinates are currently 46Â°45â²4â³n 741Â°21â²7â³w we do plan to take the snowmobile to the lake after we get our provisions in order this is polar1 out polar explorer bonus pack set  6569 theme arctic year released 2000 piece count 76 minifigs 2 list price 10 usd in 2000 lego introduced a new theme called arctic it was something completely new and different for lego as no minifig scale sets andor adventurers had ever ventured to the arctic the set offered new orange pieces and combined elements of blue and white pieces to provide a number of sleds vehicles a mobile outpost 6520 and even a large polar base 6575 the theme was unfortunately short lived and did not see 2001 this particular set is a value pack that combines sets 6578 polar explorer and 6586 polar scout at a reasonable price of 10 usd i may have even paid a few dollars less at a discount toy store back in the early 2000s a picture of the bonus pack with the two sets combined within the box the backside features an advertisement for the lego club and pictures of other arctic sets starting with the smaller set the polar explorer just a tip of the iceberg  instructions front of box back of box both sets include the same minifig an arctic fig with glasses and a thick arctic coat heres a shot of the fig with his hood on i always thought the hood is a nice piece that would work well for hoth rebel snow scenes the set includes a few nice accessories the set actually creates a small icesnow formation that can even be placed on water to represent an iceberg heres a closeup with the blue ice spider the complete set next the polar scout front of box back of box the polar scout instructions picture the same image as the box but i really like the real arctic imagery on the backside the set includes a small sheet of decals included are some great arctic accessories and some interesting arctic creatures like this neon orange scorpion in a ball of ice i love the polar bear a great addition to snow scenes but the best part of this set is the orange and black sled the back sled attachment uhaul has some tools and a removable storage cover the top comes off easy to store tools and equipment heres the arctic fig with a great metal detector or other snow research device and the sled itself lastly a picture of the complete polar scout final thoughts im a little disappointed that arctic was a shortlived theme at the time i wasnt too interested in the arctic but i still regret not buying the large polar research base after seeing it at a discounted price i was able to pick up this set and the mobile outpost that i never opened id be interesting in reading your thoughts in regard to this set and the arctic theme	neutral
thank you for that fine review thebrickster i really like how this two small sets create an intense and adventurous atmosphere against the backdrop of a pretty exotic region the sets´re well designed and very nice with a fine amount of rather unique and well fitting gear the whole theme offers a lot of playability in a setup that´s a little different to tlc´s standard sceneries for sure and it always reminded me of who goes there too	positive
hi great review on one of my favourite themes i never realized how cool it was until just now when you did your review anyways i remember my one set of the arctict expedition the arctic expedition pack	positive
a nice set review as for the theme itself i though it was a very interesting theme sadly i don’t think lego put enough effort into it i was personally upset not to se a second year even if i didn’t buy any of the sets it reminds me of the artic theme playmobil did at one point in the distant past to be honest i think a number of good artic scenes were missed when it came out a really wanted to get a ski plane but it never came i built it myself in the end but i don’t know how lego missed that one on a slightly random note i do know that at least one lego minifig did make it all the way to the real artic with a research team sadly i don’t have any pictures to offer you	negative

nice review brickster the arctic theme is very nice the minifigs have a great look to them especially with the hoods the colors for the arctic sets i have always liked and somehow the idea of minifigs exploring the arctic is fun to me	positive
thank you very much for this review thebrickster i voted both times for outstanding because i really the arctic theme i only bought the ice sailor but otherwise no sets because of money and place reasons and because i already collect four themes city older castle western and star wars old triology but a comeback of the arctic theme  perhaps as addition to a winter sports and winter rescue theme would be very welcome i really all sets  the little and the big ones in my opinion they all were very well designed not too big vehicles not too little and not minimalitic great minifigs and very nice and lovely details and accessory klausdieter	positive
thanks very much for this great review thebrickster i love the arctic subtheme but unfortunately i never got my hands on any of the sets since this theme had its time during my dark ages this one is a really neat little set with a great amount of accesoires especially these snow shoes and the backpack which i love	positive
great review i hope tlc does another i rember reading a book once based on the theme which stated the scorpions and thespiders and such were aliens 	positive

2872 witch and fireplace review theme fright knights parts 18 figs 1 price unknown bricklink 500 year 1997 brickset peeron brickshelf bricklink ever wanted to turn into a animal wanted to curse your enemy or just wanted to be rich beyond your wildest dreams you should go visit the witch and her fireplace she can brew you up a potion for any occasion or purpose so head down to see the witch right now although this set is from the fright knights theme it can easily fit in with any other castle theme due to the lack of specialised fright knight parts and printings the set comes with no astounding parts but looks like the source for our good magician impulse set from the current castle theme i think i got this as a promo set official pic the box art for the set has the standard fright knight background and lego system logo followed by the set number down the left hand side of the box a cat is attempting a head stand also i think this box display the contents of the set in an attractive set up as usual 1 the whole set minifigs and all here is the witch on the torso there is a spider amulet which is a little hard to make out due to the low res of the image the witches wand is the same as the bellville fairy wands except in trans red like a lightsaber blade although it is completely useful as a lightsaber as you have probably noticed the witch has no legs instead she has a slope brick with the dress pattern printed on witch get it witchwhich looks better than asajj ventress from the new clone wars sets in my opinon for this anyway the fairysaber new word duel this is the old run down fireplace of the witch at the base there are two smouldering coals instead of fire witch its not funny any more is it doesnt make that much sense seeming as it is a fireplace the little triangular brick on top doesnt really do anything i also accidentally put the wrong one on while building it should be a sloping brick here are the coals the old trans orange studs are less translucent than the new ones i like how they have places them above the main baseplate on a 1x2 plate so they are in line with the rest of the fire place other wise it would look wrong here is everything else i havent covered yet the crystal ball the pets and the magical potion vial the crystal ball is identical to the one included with the good wizard impulse form the current castle theme i like the molds for the cat and the bat although if the cat had some yellow printing for the eyes like the white cat had black for the eyes it would be much better i think the trans green tube things are a little uncommon but im not worried about that 2 overall build 610 extremely puzzling and difficult do not attempt alone  its pretty simple but seeming as it has a load of stuff you can move around it is good minifigs 910 i really like the witch and it couldnt have really come with anyone else also it came with the wand which is really good too design 810 it should have come with some fire and maybe some more orange bricks to put at the base parts 810 the minifigure isnt bad nor are the animals or the trans green part price 1010 i am guessing this was pretty good seeming as i think i got this as a promo i gave it 10 because it was free playability 710 as wth all impulse sets there isnt much here but at least it comes with some animals to have a fight with or give the witch rabies overall 810 if it came with some more stuff for the fire place and the cat was more detailed it would have scored higher but because this set can easily be intergrated with other castle sets it got a mighty 8 3 mini comic  hocus pocus magic shocus turn my pets into dinosaurs not to catchy is it poof oh know i think i might drink my magical potion glug glug glug oh my	positive
thank you very much for this review skipper 24 i voted for outstanding since this set is a little but very lovely set i really it although i dont own it yet  since its very similar to todays impulse sets a minifig and some nice additional stuff and i like the black cat which gives the set a more gloomy atmosphere hopefully tlg will include a black cat and a chimney like in this set in the new advent calendar too klausdieter	positive
i chose above average it has a great minifigure i wish i had itsomeday i will	positive
you already know how i feel about the review as for the set im not entirely sure its a fine witch but youve already gotten her in the witchs windship and a few other sets i vote average on this a good minifig though one does not have the need for more than one witch and some fine additional parts	neutral

huzzah the king has declared a royal tournament pitting the brave knight in his shining armour against the feared skeleton warrior and his shadow horse the jousting arena is set up so let the joust begin 7009 the final joust set info set name 7009 the final joust theme castle released 2007 price usd 799gbp 599eur 795 pieces62 minifigs 2 figs 2 horses price per piece about 13 cents let the games begin box shots the front has an image of the knight and skeleton jousting with lightning in the background the back show the two now fighting with an ax and ball and chain i dont really like the box image as i think the background looks too dark manual the front has the same picture as on the box on the back some of the other 2007 castle sets are displayed this is better than the usual sweepstakes image that we get the pieces nothing really special here but you at least get a good assortment of weapons shields i always like lego shields and these are no exception the patterns are great minifigs first the horses these are great the knights horses coverings are really nice now the minifigs the knight and skeleton both have nice armor the torsos are plain black for the skeleton and bley for the knight the finished product in the middle is the jousting barrier which is simple but serves its purpose on the left we have the weapon rack which is good it would have been nice if tlg had included a rack for the skeleton as well though extra parts only two extra white parts here you can use them if your knights horse wants to retire and look like a normal horse again oh that has to hurt it seems that the skellie has won this round poor knight brickshelf folder now for the ratings price 710 not a very good price per piece ratio however at least 2 figs and 2 horses are included parts 710 the shields and log bricks are nice but most of the others are nothing spectacular design 810 relatively well designed but a bit boring playability 810 you can joust with it and thats about all build 810 short and easy overall 3850 brickset lego sh peeron bricklink strike it seems that the horses have rebelled against their riders summary this set although not amazing is still a very solid set the minifigs are great and so are the horses but the rest of the set kind of feels like an afterthought even with its negative aspects i still recommend it especially if you are a castle fan thanks and happy building ps if you want to see how i made this set a bit more fun check out this click	positive
outstanding this is as many of the new castle sets a super set you get loads of great parts a horse barding a black skeleton horse and for a fair price i just love this set and ive bought quite a few of them to build my army a must have  and your great review serves it well	positive

review of 7670 hailfire droid and spider droid updated theme sw episode ii  clone wars parts 249  figs figs 4 price £2000 2000 ‚2599 year 2008 i think many people were deterred from this set because of the low piece count and a high price for it although it does come with 4 minfigures 1 overall set and figs official box pic this indicates it is a geonosis set from the background but it is no different from any other set same old brown separatist ships the whole set some red tan droids would have been nice like in the geonosian fighter set all the minifigs the super battle droid body is slightly different to the one in the bp it looks more grainy and silver i doubt this has any relevance for it being a geonosis set but i like them better how they were in the bps the super battle droid body dwarfing the commander droids body i think that the new commander droids body is better than the old one with just the yellow strip even though it is less accurate new twisted battle droid arm each droid has one of these i dont really like having droids with these new guns i think the older guns suited them much better 2 hailfire droid hailfire droid by itself it is certainly smaller than the original seeming as this is the main part of the set i was hoping it would be bigger but i dont mind it being this small too much wheels and rockets can fold outwards and inwards the wheels which spin round two large clear discs and made from loads of these tiny links this is probably the best way to make the wheels on this small scale the only other alternatives i can think of are using the tracks from the wookiee attack set or catterpilla tracks both of which wouldnt look right one of the missile pods these use the new flickfire missiles which dont fall out are an excellent idea they should have come with the purple cones like on the magna guards staffs instead of red though because in the film the missiles are purple one of the new flickfire missiles that dont drop out when the model is tilted forward i dont know what the holes in them are for though the 3 eyes are made up of 2 trans red cheese bricks for the sides and 1 trans red stud for the centeryou can also see how the missile pods are attached to the side of the body this is the back of the hailfire droid there is a plate with a hole in i have found only one purpose for this the hailfire droid is the commander droids war chariot what do you use the plate for 3 spider droid the spider droid the design has been greatly improved from the wookiee attack set not only is it more accurate but also more poseable which is useful when setting up battle scenes the ball joint provides the place to put the antenna which isnt long enough but the dome form the old set looks more like the droid form star wars episode ii the eyes are made of a telephone piece with 2 trans red studs on in the original it had orange studs the eyes can be seen in action 2 pics down i told you it was a telephone 1 of 4 identical legs these are very easy to adjust into what ever position you want and are much better than the originals but a word of warning never pull them apart as i did they become very loose when put back together so i put some blue tack in the holes 4overall build 710 a little to repetitive for my liking minifigs 810 4 figs for £20 isnt too bad plus they come with new guns design 910 both vehicles are very well designed but the hailfires small size let the set down parts 810 comes with lots of useful maybe not  brown track links price710 not too bad with 4 figs and loads of little brown links playability 610 not to much on its own overall 710 if it came with some clones and tan red droids it would be better afetr jar jar wiped out a small droid patrold he realized he was being watched mesa in big dodo this time	neutral
skipper 24 on sep 1 2008 1221 pm said this is the back of the hailfire droid there is a plate with a hole in i have found only one purpose for this the hailfire droid is the commander droids war chariot what do you use the plate for the plate with the hole in it is for an easy grip when you push it around i think nice review by the way i think the telephone piece is great if a little bit oversized	neutral

6205 vwing fighter number of pieces 118 number of minifigs 1 price 999 usd 1399 eur 899 gbp theme star wars episode iii year released 2006 brickset folder bricklink catalog welcome to this review of the vwing fighter this will be my eighth review on the boards strangely enough there was another set called the vwing fighter that came out in 1997 for the space theme note that i am missing several small pieces to this set but they are mostly insignificant to the overall look the box this is the standard box type for all 20052006 star wars sets i cant say that i like it as much as the 2007 or 2008 box types but itll do it features a profile view of darth vader and silver text overview this is the whole set this ship is meant to protect the chancellor at all costs they are usually found in groups of three or four front this ship is very sleek and youll notice that its colors are dark red light bley and dark bley with a touch of black it starts at the nose very narrow but as the body progresses to the back it gets wider like a v hence the name back here is a view of the rear note the transneon green discs used to represent the boosters also notice the dark red r4 astro droid and the hinges used as aromor flight all four wings two on each side can open up for flight attack mode they can open even farther then the pic shows but its not an intended function the wings a great but its a real pain to position them correctly and the bottom wings close when you set the ship down tail fins this is what the tail fins look like on each side with two flaps attached to the top and bottom if you look closely the tail fins and wings look a little bit like a mini ship themselves maybe controlled by remote no this is not an intended function either guns side the guns are very simple but very clever using a double technic hole piece two black bars and two technic pins also note the landing gear minifig finally here is the minifig a clone pilot it has light blue arms and legs white hands a helmet with black markings and republic insignia on it and a doublesided torso the front of the torso is great featuring shoulder straps armor plating and a life support system while this minifig is not altogether accurate to the movie it has still been one of my favorite star wars figs back the back of the fig that can double as the front of clone marines this side features shoulder straps and armor plating cockpit lastly here is the pilot seated in the cockpit he fits perfectly although it is not airtight we wouldnt want the poor guy to suffocate now would we that wraps up the review here is the final verdict build 810 a nice easy build and the last of the small sw ships 10 or less playability 610 pretty fun to swoosh around but thats about it could use a vulture droid but that would take away the small factor swooshability 1010 very fun and easy to swoosh around endlessly without fear of it breaking minifigs 910 there really is no need to have more although a palpy fig would be outstanding the pilot is a great figure though design 910 extremely accurate to the movie but the cockpit is not airtight price 1010 you couldnt ask for a better deal overall score 86 an excellent set unfortunately this is the last of the small sw ships currently the fig is great and the sleek design is accurate that just about sums it all up feel free to leave your comments edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0311 am	positive

yeah this was an ok set i remember getting a few of these at tru the boxes were smashed up and i got some 30 percent off still not as cheap as regular us price  some ok bricks and a great minifig thanks for sharing your thoughts and opinions on this set ill rate this set as average oh yeah ive added the review to the index	neutral

nice review which reminds me i must order some more of these battle packs at some point are you going to also review the skelton battlepack also i hope this is a start of a running joke about castle sets being stomped by sw sets	neutral
i love this battlepack i bought two last time i went to legoland california and it certainly gave the knights a good variety of new troops however i have one complaint and that is the guy with the lance i am wondering why he has a lance while fighting on foot if tlg really wanted to give him a lance they should have given him a horse	positive
great review of a neat way to bulk up your castle guards and their associated weapons and shields i hope we continue to see sets like this in the future they have to be a good money maker for tlg and they always please the fans francis marion on sep 2 2008 1039 am said they should have given him a horse  with that lovely new barding nobody would complain about the price then even if it was 15	positive
great set but with two huge cons  availabilty only on sh well surely not in italian stores  why are the figures already built are todays kids so dumb lets go back to those old minifig packs	neutral

the cobra on sep 2 2008 1133 am said  why are the figures already built are todays kids so dumb lets go back to those old minifig packs probably to reduce the sizecomplexity of the package thus saving tlc money i dont see it being a big deal as customization is always an option concerning the set not much to say other than it does what its suppose to do build up ones army of knights the variance of faces and accessories are great i especially love the chrome sword the price isnt bad either since the package comes with five nice figs and some great equipment edited by dj2005 03 september 2008  0646 am	neutral
after reading your review i might buy me one of these at first i thought it was quite useless but i must admit that your review kinda changes my mind on this bp ive added it to the index	neutral
how were you able to get three small shields i only got two in mine i am going to check the trash just in case	neutral
i think this battle pack is a little expensive but the minifig their heads and weapons and stuff are very very nice but because of the price ill rate it  average 	neutral
i love this set i bought one when i went to the lego store at downtown disney and went home and bought another online i love that it gives you a variety of weapons and figures i like using the bowl helmet guy to man my catapults and crossbows	positive
its an ok set but its extremely overpriced where i live i simply couldnt justify paying 1799 tax for 5 minifigs the fact that these figures are featured prominantly in other sets makes this set a difficult purchase given the price i find it hard to look at this set with much enthusiasm	neutral
its way to expansive for what you get besides you pay more for the package then its containts	negative

i really love these impulse sets at a low price point for lots of minifigs this police one doesnt appeal too much to me at the moment but who knows with your reference i may need it with a future project hmm its actually a good way of getting those dogs cheaply	positive
i bought this set for 214€ yesterday and i have to admit that for that price im veerryy satisfied  i bought it especially for the dog my first one and for the road sign during the construction short of the set i was wondering something does the speed limit has a signification in every country or some variant exists in my country france the speed limit in town is 50 kmh so i understand the road sign in this set but in other country and especially the country were the speed limit is not in kmh does this set had another road sign	positive

thanks for this fine and elaborate review on the 2nd best impulse set there is yes the troll warrior wins by a zillion miles ive added it to the index	positive
i agree that this set is worth the price considering the amount of minifigs and even a skeletal horse it also comes with a lot of blue 1x1 slopes that are always useful and quite rare to obtain another weapon for the soldier operating the catapult or a shield for the other soldier would have been great but that is pushing it the crossbow itself is quite nice and is better than what most 6 sets come with imo overall a good set indeed thank you for the review and the other review concerning the knight of which i hope to buy in the near future as it looks like it comes with a great deal of goodies the weapon rack is useful too	neutral
i like this set mostly because it has some very usable pieces but also because of the amount of minifigures in the set which is a whopping three and one large animal skeleton horse the one thing however that i dont like about it is that one of the catapult operators isnt armed in my opinion this would have been a good time for tlg to release a suitable dagger piece not the kitchen knife for its castle line great review by the way it captured the key elements of this fantastic small set	neutral
nice review to start off you got all the details someone could possibly need in my opinion at least i do enjoy this set as well and ive bought only one to keep my minifigs as unique as possible despite my personal preference i still find this a nice army builder good amount of minifigs for the price as mentioned earlier with each being different from the other though i would like the catapult manager to be armed with at least something i still feel that he can just flee if hes ever in trouble hes a good guy to use for the castle gimmics if you have it one more small comment i also love those domed helmets even if they arent actually new my favorite of them all being followed up by the racer helmet	neutral
nice review  i still thing sets like this are the reason castle has done so well it allows you to collect a large number of minfig for not very much cash which i certainly indulged in my only complaint is that you end up with the evil skeletons out numbered however heard of the good guys winning with the numbers in their favour	neutral

youre really rolling these reviews out huh i am not sure how i feel about this set while it does include five figs three are skeletons and are generally worth much less than say three trollsorcs i know they didnt exist at this point in time so this is understandable the amount of horses is nice but im not a big lego horse fan what this set does have is a great appearance and brings atmosphere to the table 20 is an affordable amount for those of us who do not wish to splurge too much on a toy while being enough to actually get a large enough set to create something out of personally id rate it in between average and above average like another castle set i cant remember which i just feel this one also lacks something	neutral
i really like this set and its probably my next purchase from a store if i can still find it theres alot of great pieces i especially like the spiked thingy on the front and it makes a great addition for any skeletal army above all i just love the spinechilling feeling of it if i were a minifig in a legoland id be scared out of my pantspiece if i saw a carriage like that rolling towards me in a dark night	neutral
well indeed looks like a very nice set especially the scared knights are very nice 	positive
that’s a nice review though i do feel the price was a little high but as you said you get so much in it last year argos in the uk reduced it to £799 which was a true bargain and sent me all over london looking for a store with more in stock again as with all the lego castle sets i think what makes it work so well is that lego are now providing a much larger number of minfigs and that’s often what makes a set	neutral
this was one of the first sets i bought from the new castle theme and i love it so many figs and awesome skeleton horses in just one set at the same time you get quite a few usefull black bricks for castle mocs another perfect set in the new world of castle review added to the index	positive

thats a super review erdbeereis1 as usual and as we can expect from one of the academy teachers i gave the set a 4 above average because i think there are quite some minifigs included for its price which is i think not that expensive at all i also like the parts that are included like the sceleton horses and weapons wheels imho this set is a great armybuilder  btw in belgium i have seen this set being sold for 1599 euros	positive

7040 dwarves mine defender theme castle released 2008 price 10 usd pieces 73 3 minifigures introduction here i am with one of the newest castle sets realeased in early 2008 its a small battle wagon with blades on the front probably to demolish rocks in mines but in this case our hero dwarf has to use his machine against the evil trolls who want to destroy his happy kingdom there is only one small booklet for instructions no alternate model parts come in two bags one for small pieces and one for bigger ones apart from the lovely figures the brown parts will be quite useful for any castle builder extra parts are not even worth mentioning there are no stickers figures are detailed enough dwarf is lovely with his beard but his legs wont move because he is short figures are the main attraction for adult players we havent seen castle army builder sets for a long while and this is closest weve got in recent years the dwarf is a little taller than it should have been but its not possible to do so without creating a completely new mould for figures and that would be expensive its beard is oversized as well but that gives him a legoish look which i like a lot the trolls  thats what everybody calls them but i say they are orcs  are obviously evil but they are friendly enough not to scare our munchkins but i wish they had different torsos or at least different faces like crownies there are not enough weapons to arm everyone but the flag pole is really nice unlike the star wars army builders this set has very little weaponry only one sword and one pike creates scarcity for 3 figures  star wars sets had 4 figures for same price so i hope our middle age warriors dont come across any stormtroopers  building in progress when you pull the chain the catapult fires a round brick the set has quite good playability moving blades and firing catapult should be fun for little children i wouldnt expect more functions for such a small sized model it hardly covers my hand the blades move with the front wheel on the right there is only one little downside there is too much friction for the wheel and blades wont move synchronized you may come over this problem by adjusting the blade height and lining them with the wheels mow the little buggers you can adjust the blade height there isnt enough room for the dwarf folder when public httpwwwbrickshelrycgif338578 rating figures 810 dwarf is amazing trolls are great too but i wish they had different faces parts 710 brown slopes are new rest is ok too price 710 acceptable but we have seen sets with more figures for less design 610 it looks kind of steampunkish but could be better with a little detail building 610 not repeating itself still nothing exciting total 3450 castle fans will definetely order this one but average lego player may not be interested conclusion overall its a nice set and id recommend it if you like the castle theme youll find some good use for the figures and this is the cheapest figure set of the year  at 333 usd each it could have more armory and weaponry but otherwise its quite alright skip lunch today and order this little set links brickset reviews bricklink entry peeron inventory	positive

indexed going through the boards i was amazed to find out that no one ever attempted to review one of the best lego classics the 6399 airport shuttle while i was studying for exams a few weeks back i decided to take a break built the monorail and take some pictures of it resulting in the present review along with this i made my first ever poll here we go first some data setnumber 6399 setname airport shuttle released in 1990 in holland though bricklink says 1991 number of parts 731 number of figs 9 price unknown prices on bricklink vary from 261 up to 2300  but this was an expensive set even in the nineties the box mine is a bit battered by the owner before me but theres still plenty to see this is one of the largest boxes i have look at the minifig in the downright corner for the comparision and it is a really neat storing facility for many sets the box shows the set and in the background the silhouet of the set that is to accompany this one the airport from 1990 i like the angle of the box showing the two stations track and train in one picture the back of the box shows some really nice ideas for other setups why oh why has lego abandonned this kind of showing whats possible with one set inside flap of the box showing details of the set and the functions detail on the front of the box displaying the dimensions it really is a huge track layout for one set the instructions there is a nice little booklet showing the same picture as the box art with the figures lined up underneath the last page nicely folds out to show the entire setup of the tracks the figures a brilliant selection of minifigs including airport people and a cook all figures that are supposed to go on the shuttle carry a ticket and there are also some suitcases tickets fit inside of course station  1 the set includes two stations here is the first depicting the airport there are lots of details a phonebooth two seats some flowers a map luggagelockers and of course the streetlights a detailed shot of the station showing the luggagelockers and ticketvalidating machine part of the beauty of this set is the fact that it is so extremely detailed just look at the signs to show where to go next stickers and the scenery opposite the street the station has the same shape as the airport shuttle logo how sweet is that the station pictured as part of the layout the stations ends are made with airplane wings to smoothen the arrival of the shuttle station  2 here is the second station my personal favorite an elevated stop with a little snackbar underneath and stairs leading to the platform some chairs and streetlights here as well plus two old fashioned trees the part of the set that can be used in any layout the snackbar with hamburger sign sticker yes those hamburgers look tasty indeed also notice the lights hanging from the platform overhead and the ticketvalidating machine at the bottom of the stairs here we have the platform with information panels and seats also notice the two trafficlights for the train heres how it works the train will travel in the direction the arrow is pointing when turning the knob the two grey blocks will move towards or away from the trackcenter activating a button on the centerpiece of the train the motor which makes the train start its journey around the track there is only one speed and the train can only be put to a stop or change direction at stations the station as part of the layout the shuttle now on with the train there are two carrriages connected to a centered motor the power is provided by means of a batterybox containing a 9v battery the batterybox is in one of the carriages and displays airport shuttle a total of five passengers can be seated inside leaving room for their luggage and two drivers the front carriage with the button for the batterybox showing the underside showing the gearwheel metal that brings the power from the motor onto the geared track the black pointy things alongside the gearwheel react with the direction knobs at stations this is how the shuttle negociates with height differences everything hinges and rotates making the shuttle capable of performing steep climbs the motor is powerful enough to not slow down at such a climb detailed shot showing the first set of covered wheels in hinged position the shuttle on the layout the full layout this layout is quite huge involving lots of track pieces ramps ten large stanchionpoles and the two stations to show the movement of the shuttle i have made a 20 second movie which can be seen in my brickshelf gallery of this set conclusion well to conclude the review some final thoughts this truly is one of the more detailed sets around at least from the nineties and one of the largest in dimensions the monorail system is cleverly thought out and works excellent track extensions are hard to get however and very expensive nowdays especially the switchpoints and long straight track pieces the tracks included with this set will provide you with hours of fun though because there are a lot of them it can be quite hard to incorporate the monorail in your town without having a clearlybasedonthemonorailalone town i tried to incorporate it some years ago link here posing a real challenge the ratings price 810 this is an expensive set if you can get it for under 200 get it this set is rare in any condition parts 1010 lots of rare pieces cool minifigs 9v system roadplates lots of minifigseats en red trainwindows originality 1010 there are very few monorails released this one being the only town set compatibility 810 can be a bit hard to incorporate in a town but hey you got the monorail so no complaining here total 3640 i can only reccommend this set to anyone it is my personal favorite set upto this present time if there are any questions ask them all comments are welcome of course	positive
you chose the perfect set for your first poll simon no question this set is one of the alltimebeauties i rated outstanding of course i never hat the chance to get a complete copy of this set but i do own the engine and quite a bunch of monorail tracks your very detailed review made me think of getting the whole set some day thank you very much for this i never realized there were so many details included to this set the snackbar and the telephone cell and all the other nice things really strange for a nineties set which often lacked details the only thing that comes to my mind right now is that the engine looks quite blocky if the set was released today tlc would use more of those parts which make a better design imo and it would fit better to the curved walls of the stations as well wishful thinkinghow much would i love to see the monorail system back again wishful thinking i had to lough when reading your comment on the minifig seats dont you own many of those i dont know where to put mine	positive
i got this set last month and i can definitely say that even if you think it is one of the best sets ever you wont fully appreciate it until you build it yourself the elevated city station is much more complex than it looks and the whole set is extremely detailed the good  as stated in the review theres a lot of track roughly twice as much as the last monorail made 6991 5 long straights too  the designers didnt need to put in the hamburger stand or the ticket readers but they did and made it even better  great figure selection airport workers as well as civilians the bad if you can call it that in such a great set  hard to incorporate into an existing town if using the default track layout the center loop would be inaccessible to vehicles and the layout is very large  the monorail needs nearly a full straight section on either side of the city station or it will impact the corner of the station and stall if a curve is too close  as far as i know the only town set with road plates that doesnt have a wheeled vehicle a car would have been nice a bus would have been incredible but these small things in no way diminish from the fact that this is one of the best sets ever edited by section8 05 september 2008  0117 pm	positive
this is an outstanding review which deserved to be featured here after seeing this set it prompts me to own this set and match with my 10159 legend city airport its very nice to see such outstanding set being reviewed and presented to our very screens everything about this set is simply outstanding i cant imagine that such incredible set actually released before why dont they ever continue with this anymore sigh its nice to see so much detailed from its shuttle snack bar stairs waiting platform validating machine and etc this is an instant 5 set if given a chance to own a misb set i will defintely seriously consider about it	positive
an excellent review of one of the jewels in the crown of the lego town range to answer one of your question i think the lack of people owning this set is one of the reasons that its yet to have a review personally i’ve only seen this set in the flesh once in my life when i was a child just before it was withdrawn from sale it is a lovely set well made and well produced though i think there is a flaw and that’s when the passages get of the other end of their train ride what picks them up a bus set for the airport would have been a good addition apart from that i can’t really fault it and that fact it comes with three female minifigs is just stellar as for incorporation keeping it elevated seems the most sensible suggestion i’ve always thought it i have it and wanted to integrate the set to a town to use it in the style of the dlr in london but that’s just a thought	positive

judging from videos ive seen it seems that the monorail does very well on slopes i wonder why there havent been more or at least an updated set i also wonder why the trains cant incorporate some slopes like the monorail	negative
it would be cool to see a review comparing this set with the newer orange garbage truck	neutral
definitely the best garbage truck ever the color scheme is great and the design is awesome outstanding without a doubt i must have it sometime	positive
this truck is simply beautiful its on my brickset wanted list i love the colour scheme red and yellow are the right choice for this vehicle the back part of the truck can be opened so it can discharge the rubbish like real garbage trucks youve also mentioned that in your review and i find it a wonderful detail thanks for the review jopiek	positive
yeah its very nice along with all the older sets ive got the cement mixer that was released around about the same time as this	positive
thanks for the review like many such town sets i would characterise it as cute contrasting it to the new bin lorry its nice that this set has two minfigs more realistic and two bins those bins are a great addition to lego although wheelie bins would be nice now need some kind of 2x2 container you can clip a plate onto as a hinging lid and clip miniwheels under the back two studs having two minifigs is a superior point for this earlier lego rendition of a bin lorry in fact even though our bins are now emptied by a private company rather than the local council as was the case up till the mid 90s and of course for the last two decades there have been wheeliebins bin lorries have three guys  the driver and two collectors however our bin collectors for sure dont use a broom or shovel indeed on occasion theyve befouled the street themselves if something goes wrong with hoisting the bin on the mechanism the shape of the lorry in the set is still quite accurate pretty good for a fourwide vehicle i must admit to preferring the newer vehicles	positive
thanks so much for the great review i love that truck i hadnt realized there was a real 4wide recycle truck out there i must get it one day to replace this abomination currently doing garbage duty in my town i think that truck has seven pieces total in it i do like the blue color though 	positive
greetings just looking through the review index when i came across this one i recently acquired this set through ebay which came with a practically perfect box and instructions i would almost say that no one played with it much as all of the parts were brand new anyway i just wanted to say that this is a great set that was worth the 1499	positive

6206 tie interceptor number of pieces 212 number of minifigs 1 price 1999 usd 1799 eur theme star wars episode vi year released 2006 brickset folder bricklink catalog welcome to my ninth review the boards todays review is the long awaited tie interceptor but does it live up to expectations well lets find out i believe this is the first and only time tlg made this set so lets begin the review the box the box is standard for its time with silver font the background on the front has some planets and the death star ii clarifying that this set is from episode vi overview this set comes with the interceptor model and one fig the interceptor has a very sleek futuristic design with four wings and a ballshaped cockpit the tie interceptor is a stealthy speedy vehicle in the imperial fleet it is used for scouting missions and not meant for attacking due to its weak structure and low arsenal front this version of the tie group is very attractive and coollooking it has an aerodynamic shape giving it looks and speed while not accurate to the movies grey and black colored ties the blue in place of the grey is just fine and does not alter the coolness of the design thankfully there are no stickers in this set cockpit here you can see the ballshaped cockpit be very very careful when opening it its very flimsy and breaks off almost every time fortunately both the windshield and the dish on top are printed and not stickers please dont mind the dust cockpit interior this is the inside of the cockpit it is very roomy airtight and one of the few cockpits in sw sets that are this good it makes up for lack of detail by giving the pilot plenty of room so you should have no trouble there it is also very smooth in the back and where the windshield folds down this is by far the best sw cockpit i have ever seen done by tlg good job the only bad thing is the two tan bricks that clash with the rest of the color wing attachment this is how the wings are attached to the cockpit on each side unfortunately the design on this part is not so good and sometimes the wings break off plus this part is very blocky and there is a big juniorized piece on the base of the wings wings here is what each wing looks like there are three parts on each wing a middle and two fins the wings are very aerodynamic with a diamondlike design note the imperial insignias and the blue tiles lining the wings wing attachments contd here again you see how the middle wing part is attached to the base juniorized piece and the fins attached to the base by hinges the hinges allow the fins to fold in and out a bit but again this is very fragile and the fins often break off gun placements this is an example of four guns on the ship one on the tip of each fin the guns consist of a tile with a tenic tunnel hole on the bottom attached to a technic pin which is attached to a black bar a good design altogether back here you see the rear of the cockpit you can see why the opening mechanism is so flimsy the whole top and front is connected to the body only by a weak hinge system as seen in the picture also note the small transblue dish and the four transred studs minifigure finally here is the single figure that comes in this set a tie pilot it is an all black figure with a life support system decal on the front and a helmet with silver imperial insignias an overall good minifig with a different helmet mold than the stormtrooper or shadowtrooper well i suppose thats about all lets get to the final verdict build 610 a little difficult due the flimsiness of the ship but should only take the average builder no more than 30 minutes playability 710 its fun to fly around   but has no real functions swooshability 710 you can swoosh it around fairly well just be careful not to accidentally break it minifigs 810 a good fig although having only one leaves something more to be desired design 410 very very flimsy with the wings windshield and fins but good for display price 710 i think it was actually 30 usd when i got it but im not sure overall score 65 an average set very delicate so much that you can hardly pick it up but good for display the minifig is okay and having no stickers is good i would recommend this to a hardcore ot fan that wraps it all up please vote your opinion on this set in the poll and ill see you next review edited by jimbutcher 15 september 2008  0310 am	neutral

name jetport fire squad set no 6440 theme lego system  town year 1991 pieces 84 minifigs 2 price usd 2750 which equals about eur 1926€ and gbp 1557£ introduction one of the sets that especially my cousin likes is this one one time at the dutch legoworld event we had three of those there with flashing lights and loud sirens trying to put out the fire that was caused by the crash of again some lego aircraft we never had this set before our drak ages and the sets probably came from ebay or so in my opinion the newest airport rescue is nice too but in the conclusion i will make some additional remarks about that just imagine what it would be like for your lego town if the pilot of one of your smaller planes just couldnt stop before the end of the runway here you see the disaster that happened some day in our town fortunately all passengers got out safely thanks to our brave fire fighters this magnificent truck was used to help putting out the fierce fire caused by the aviation gas from the small plane the set includes two firefighters in distinguishable airport uniforms in order to be able to safe the passengers and go for a quick intervention our brave firemen have an axe for each of them airtanks and a portable fire extinguisher here you see the truck on the right side the large spout on the roof really makes it a remarkable truck as you can see behind the red door there is space for the airtank of our brave firemen at the right there is also place for the small hand held extinguisher the left side of the truck has a water hose instead for a truck from 1991 there is quite some room inside actually both firemen fit inside unfortunately there is only one seat at the back there are two clips for the axes there you can also find the main switch for the light and sound system as you can see the red flashing lights do their job quite well the sirene is just behind the bar with the flashing lights the main spout just seems to begin emitting water the front of the truck for some reason there are two hidden spouts there as well what their purpose is seems unclear but they look nice kimt suggests that it is for foaming the runway and that is a real option of course this set can be found on peeron lugnet brickset bricklink entries playability 810 very nice set details that are movable and of course the light and sound design 810 nice sets with nice details but could have even been better seat for 2nd fireman missing no oxigen masks and only one airtank price 710 for a light and sound set and two firefighters the price is reasonable i would say overall 810 nice sets some details could even be better too bad that there is only a five to choose from a sticker when you have more than one truck last but not least an overview of the complete set including instructions fire mastered as the dutch firefighters will say when they have completed their job we have also bought the newer airport rescue truck 7891 however we think this 6440 one is much better the light and sound all the nice features and the nice details are much better than the new truck edited by jopiek 11 september 2008  1025 am	positive

jopiek i enjoyed this review very much your first picture certainly capture the essence of this lovely set in reality i am in the aviation line especially aviation safety therefore you reentact the scene very well to be honest i have never seen this set before this aes airport emergency service fire truck is certainly unbelievable i love it very much its a pity i never owned this this is a set which give me a 5 great job jopiek i enjoyed viewing your classic town reviews very much keep up the good work	positive

i remember my cousins having this set both are in their permanent dark ages now but are not willing to give their lego to me if you have one of those old airports then this set is what you need to have even more fun since it makes a great addition to the airport excellent review 1010	positive
jopiek on sep 8 2008 1224 am said thanks of course for the flattery but do you then from your profession understand what the purpose is of the front spouts that even can be hide since that puzzles me it can be that the lego designers thought it was a nice touch and didnt bothered about the realistic value of such a feature but i dont suppose that that is the case here somehow i had just noticed your reply to be honest with you the aes in my country does not have front spouts in their fire engine i do not remember seeing this feature before it is a possibility that this feature is included in some models or an imaginative addition from our lego designers i will need to check this out kimt on sep 9 2008 0316 pm said perhaps the front sprouses are for foaming the runway that is a logical answer	neutral

i have this one the newer 6571 station is better in some ways but i always liked the big airportstyle fire engine in this and the windows covering the garages one mod project i have in mind is to expand the base adding a second room in the area beneath the control center interestingly this set had two different box pictures there was the original 1989 yellow legoland box and a 1991 blue system box and the blue box has the vehicles in different places quote price usd 8500  gbp unknown  eur unknown if this is referring to the original price it wasnt that much 50 is more like it	neutral
this looks like a great set i like the futuristic fire truck that might be what i do with my imperial shuttles glass cockpit	positive
from memory argos sold it originally for about £21 gbp i seem to remember this as i could not afford the airport released the same year as this was about £2999 seems such a small amount of money now now have 2 copies of this set only 1 boxed 	positive

name electric passenger train set no 7725 theme lego  system  trains  12v  train set year 1981 pieces 485 minifigs 1 price usd 7000 which equals about eur 50€ and gbp 40£ introduction our most favorite theme is 12v trains actually i got my first 77series back in 1981 5th of december i was 25 years old just a week before my brother was born some years later i got the 7740 after our dark ages we my brother cousin and myself got all 12v trains at least once this 7725 was gathering dust in my brothers room the train in all its splendor as you can see it doesnt occur at the back of the 12v era train instructions although its larger brother the 7740 does some investigation learned that all the sets at the back of the instructions date from 1980 so the 7725 wasnt released yet here you can see the front of the 7725 with the driver in the cockpit the driver is in fact the only minifig that was included in the set as you can see our version of the train has a different front than the one in the instructions apparently the former owner used 7861 lighting set 12 v to upgrade the train with working back and frontlights i like the original lights but didnt notice that the train had those double lights until i did the review maybe we will give the train again its original signs and put custom leds in it or so so that the train can drive into two directions with accurately working lights another thing about the lights that puzzle me are the backlights while typing this i realise that the former owner might have added those so lets have a look at the instructions then as it turns out the lights are there also in the instructions i recently learned that only the last car or coach of a train has its red lights on so unless the train drives with only the front car it will never use those red backlights here you can see the cockpit with the engineer the cables dont look very pretty but well the train at least has working light here you can take a look at the inside of the engine car while the 7745 has a nice fake engine there just the weight bricks and the ugly cables apart from the engineer and his cockpit no other nice features here btw lego always used tiles in such a trains to make it easier for kids to take off the roof and have access to the minifig passengers etc here the proof that it is an electric train the pantograph of the front car it has the same kind of panthographs that the 7745 has the middle car has 4 chairs as you can see some vandal must have nocked over this one hope they leave the cables alone this early morning train seems to have one passenger a workman i like the small 2x3 windows from this car very much they give this care a nice look also the door in the middle adds something special to the train as far as i know no other passenger train has the doors in the middle here you see the side of the train just after the train has left brickingham station where the worker probably from set 6647 highway repair that was also released in 1980 a closeup of the last car with steering stand to allow the train to travel back and forth without having to make head in other words putting the engine in front again the train shunted to an end track so it can be cleaned i think it is apparent that it definitely needs cleaning very badly this set can be found on peeron lugnet brickset bricklink entries playability 510 the train is fine but with only one minifig not very playable without other sets also no accessories at all design 710 nice train the inside could have been a lot better but i really like to original front lights price 710 the train came with motor so not a bad price goes now for quite some money at ebay overall 6510 nice set but the 7745 is a better train im sure well that was it for today i hope you have enjoyed this review and got tears in your eyes seeing how nice the 12v era was it never comes back but maybe lego rereleases some of this sets in the 2009 train era very likely that this is just wishful thinking edited by jopiek 12 september 2008  0456 pm	neutral
a very nice review jopiek you know i was wondering how lego could justify having two 12vpowered passenger trains at the same time but after reading the review and seeing the lack of figures and accessories i guess i understand why plus the train is rather compact oh and i cant help but think that the chairs in the middle carriage are somewhat oddly placed because those placed next to the door are unusable because the door takes up room needed for figs arms also it appears that your set also has the newer couplers ie theres no hooks for the decoupling rail to grab hold of with the light assembly it really wont matter playwise or if you dont have any decouplers but its still a bit of a bummer	positive

jopiek on sep 7 2008 1120 pm said the chair was just loose so it should be placed on the 2x2 plate that is also visible in the picture of the middle car thats not the one i was thinking of it was the other two chairs towards the middle of the wagon that i was thinking of if you try to seat a minifig in either of them youll quickly find that its impossible beacuse the door interferes with the figs required personal space if you move both of them one stud forward so that the back of the seat lines up with the edge of the window itll solve the problem and still leave space for a figs to be seated in the other chairs	neutral

the best 12v legotrain is for me the 7740 the 7725 is still a goodlooking train and the only one with short wagons in a electric version before i started to with bricklink i started to build this train in blue ive build 4 trains of it and sold 2 of them still one for sale  you can also build this in other colors like a yellow one or you can build a black version which i made a death train of it driven by a skeleton  edited by panda9001100 17 may 2009  0801 am	positive

beach cruisers set  6445 theme island xtreme stunts year released 2002 piece count 97 minifigs 2 list price 7 usd during a trip to legoland california in 2002 their big store had a neat little display of some new sets and themes including island xtreme stunts the new theme offered great colors including orange tan and light blue which immediately caught my eye the theme focussed on island fun with some adventure and included some great figs like the brickster i had to buy at least one set choosing truck  stunts trike review coming soon at the time the theme was short lived and many of the sets were on sale at discount toy stores not too long after their initial release i picked up this set 6445 beach cruisers for 333 usd which will be my first of three island xtreme stunt reviews starting with the box a race between the street surfer and skate boarder the back shows some alternate models including a sail boat and jet ski same image on the instructions as the box but the backside shows the island xtreme stunts video game for different platforms the set includes a small decal sheet for the skateboard i love the two figs included within this set one is a hippietype with shades and leafed muscle short and the other pizza boy skateboarder check out the pizza boy on his skateboard two green brackets are included for attaching each fig to the long grey bar using this piece one can make the skateboarder do tricks and flips the street surfer vehicle is pretty nice to the sail is placed on a black bar and lance then attached to the vehicle heres a picture of the vehicle to me it has that old soap box derby look to it  like something kids would create to race down a hill the vehicle doesnt have a steering wheel but rather two levers which i think work well in the cockpit heres the underside the set has three neon orange wheels that attach to technic axle pins to attach to the vehicle lastly the entire set with a few extra pieces final thoughts while island xtreme stunts is not the best citytown subtheme esp for the traditional lego classic town fan it does have some fun sets like this little beach cruiser good figs a skateboard and a very rollable fun word equivalent to swooshable but for vehicles with wheels vehicle you can even blow on the sail to get it to roll across the floor this set is a lot of fun	neutral

i had never seen these sets before in my retail stores before however i do remember the existence of its video games look like an interesting set for great outdoor enterainment and fun for lego citizens whom is out for real thrill and excitement this theme never really got me excited back then after reading your review its quite useful for some new addition to your town features such as including a skater boy holding the pizza instead of using the pizza van the high fuel cost must have caught up to them to resort using skate board for delivery as for the street surfer vehicle its a cool looking vehicle with unique construction pardon me i have not seen such design before i will actually tear off the wheels cover up the sides and used it for wind surfing thats the whole idea after giving some thoughts and weighs its factors i will have to give it a 3 for this set i will probably get it if its on sales once again brickster this is a lovely review which has showed us a new perspective of island xtreme stunts	neutral
nice review i got this set not long after my ending of the dark ages it was even then already on slae for just 5 euro i like the figs and the vehicles it were some of my first orange pieces the hippie guy is called  snap lockit and the pizza guy is called  pepper roni i think the legodesigners had a cosy evening with much beer when they thought about the names i think this line was the only line which was made first as computergame and after that as a real line instead of the other computergames based on already existing lines	neutral

air chase woosh the bricksters seaplane flies over the beach quickly hippie dude is in close pursuit on his hang glider fuel is running out for the bricksters plane can hippie dude catch him before he either gets away or crash lands in the water you decide with island xtreme stunts air chase set  6735 theme island xtreme stunts year released 2002 piece count 83 minifigs 2 list price 10 usd a nice addition to the island xtreme stunts theme air chase includes two air vehicles a seaplane and hang glider the set has nice island colors inclusing white light blue and orange also includes in the set are some great chrome pieces for the bricksters airplane wings starting with the box you can see hippie dude in close pursuit the back of the box depicts some nice alternate jet skis same front box picture on the instructions and on the backside pictures of the video game air chase includes two nicely detailed figs hippie dude for lack of his official name and the brickster heres a picture of the orange hangglider and the underside unfortunately the hangglider is too heavy to be held up by a minigig while i like the brickbuilt glider for the extra pieces the plastic wing pieces from the ninja theme would have worked effectively and be a lot lighter i think the seaplane is the best part of the set heres a shot of the front end i like the skeletal sharkfish design whats great is none of the pieces use stickers they are all printed including the tail end although the cockpit has no steering wheel or lever piece it does have a very nice printed 1x2 tile the wings of the airplane have hinges to allow them to fold inward slightly also notice the nice chromesilver pieces heres a shot of the underside of the seaplane and lastly the complete set final thoughts air chase is another one of those fun island sets two figs with two vehicles make a perfect combination for creating some dogfights in the air at the same time the bricksters plane can land in the water to explore other adventure play opportunities this set is also a nice addition to the island xtreme stunts truck  stunt trikes 6739 the seaplane can be hauled by the large semitruck included within 6739 hope you enjoy this review	neutral
nice review is that one minifig breaking out of prison just wondering about his clothing the worst thing is the name anything with xtreme in the title almost deserves the lowest score possible on principle	negative
shoc on sep 9 2008 0555 pm said thanks for the review i loved this theme it had some of the greatest pieces ever arranged in any theme brilliant printed parts and figures and some good colours snap lockitt hippie dude  is a great figure with a cool name i own him from another set but unfortunately not this one it looks like a very good set no stickers and good printed parts too nice review hahaha that made me laugh for some reason i dont know why though i agree with it i have him as well i got him from the orange jetski set	neutral
i knew this set looked familiar thank you brickster for bringing one of my first lego sets ever back to my memory unfortunately i dont have many of the pieces left but thank you	neutral
thanks for the nice review whitefang i quite like this set the front looks a bit bare but for a small set like this it doesnt really matter this set gets a 4 from me as well	positive
nice review white fang this really reminds me of an allamerican set with its red white and blue colors and the white stars although i really like the fig with its scruffy bearded face i find the green torso a bit odd for this set i suppose i would expect some sort of redblue racer fig with a whiteblue racing helmet swamp sharks  too funny  you always add a nice addition of humor to your reviews now im going to check out some wonder woman clips on youtube	positive
one of my favourite sets me and couple of buddies got this set back then the fig was so cool sun glasses fast boat	positive
i love the classic sets of that era and a great review helps show off the simplicity of some older sets	positive
what would we do without the trucks of legoland to clean up our town well i didnt want to find out so i bought this set straight away 7991 recycle truck set info set name 7991 recycle truck released 2007 theme city price usd 1499gbp 1299eur 1495 pieces 206 minifigs 1 review time leading off the box the front shows the recycle man loading up the trash can one thing here is really bizarre on lego sh and everywhere else it says that this set is called recycle truck which makes sense as it has a recycle logo on the truck however on my box it says the set is called garbage truck has this happened to anyone else or is it just me here is the back of the box which shows some of the things you can do with this set the bags with this set you get 3 bags which are numbered and do you see what i see yes thats right the dss is in a bag so it doesnt get bent why tlg doesnt do this more often is beyond me bag 1 the set comes with a very nice selection of pieces a large number of these are orange manual silly me i forgot to take a picture of the front of the manual the picture is the same as on the front of the box the back shows some of the 2007 city sets in a nice little scene and inside minifig here is the friendly garbagerecycle man he looks nice but with the same head as so many other city figs before him come on tlg give us some new heads the sticker sheet the stickers actually are pretty decent as far as stickers go i like the recycle sign after bag 1 this is where we stand after the first bag is built bag  2 the parts contained in the second bag more nice orange pieces here extra parts some nice 1x1 slopes and 1x1 round plates everything built now that everything is built lets check it out the design of the set is very nice and the color scheme looks great when you see it you immediately know what it is the back has a droid arm that acts as a handle to dump the trashrecycling in the truck its simple but works well here you can see the dumping mechanism it works by a sliding technic beam with a stopper on top of the truck you can store the workers cart this works really well i think though that the top of the truck overall looks a bit jumbled up with a few too many different colors the bottom trash dumping time this is a good feature of the set a very well built snot front section this looks fantastic with the grills and number plate sticker someone has left a big mess on the street brickshelf folder ratings price 1010 for 15 this is a very good deal at 206 pieces parts 910 lots of orange design 910 a very well designed set especially the front playability 910 the trash dumper is fun and the added broom and cart make for good play value build 810 simple but stayed interesting overall4550 brickset lego sh bricklink peeron taking out the trash summary this is a great small set for the price with fun features nice colors and good design i would certainly recommend this set no matter what its really called thanks and happy building	positive
this is one of those sets that make me really want to start building up a city its a great value has a lot of useful pieces and is just plain fun to play with i do miss vehicles having doors though great review i was a bit curious as to how the dumping mechanism worked as well as the sticker count	positive
yeah the name on this set is strange i think all the boxes say garbage truck i guess its up to each builder to decide whether 1x1 round plates are recyclable material or not its a great model in any case i love these highly detailed city trucks weve been getting during the last year or two i used to have a preference for the late 80searly 90s city line but some of these new sets have really surpassed them in detail and functionality	positive
nice truck indeed but the yellow one is better i think at least if you put them on a roadplate it seems to me that those road plates are too small for that also it will not empty completely because of that panel well for the rest it is a nice set and a fine review	positive
nice review this is a very nice vehicle one of my favorite of the newer city ones jopiek there are two generations of road plate that are wide enough for sixwide vehicles like this the current plates are dark grey with plain white printing and look not great in my opinion the previous ones are imo the best road plates of all time  green with dark grey road white dotted linezebras drain covers and yellow verge markings just like we really have here in ireland for urban area i would still choose the greenedged plates and just cover up the green  the markings are so much better than the current plates	neutral
erdbeereis1 on sep 10 2008 0538 pm said actually it does the back part of the truck with the panel hinges up so that when you want the truck to dump it doesnt get in the way i should have taken a better look at the one my brother has  it still is a nice truck much better than all the strange sets that were release those dark ages before	positive
what a great set and a very nice review erdbeereis i think the only improvement to this set would have been the use of chrome exhaust pipes and front grill i bought this set with a lot of excitement but unfortunately have not put it together yet what are your thoughts on these larger 6stud wide detailed vehicles as opposed to 4stud wide classics heres an image of 6668 recycle truck released in 1992 ps i like the use of taking out sponge bob in your review	positive
this looks like a great set and im happy you were dumping spongebob he deserves that this set looks very nice and if i see it i will probably pick it up	positive
thanks for this review i really love this set its perfect for my town and brings a sense of classic when i see it	positive
thanks for the review this is one of the few city sets that i own despite loving the theme so much most of my town is either custom or classic and its about as beautiful as a big garbage truck can ever be quote nice truck indeed but the yellow one is better i think at least if you put them on a roadplate it seems to me that those road plates are too small for that also it will not empty completely because of that panel well for the rest it is a nice set and a fine review well the truck barely fits onto the old roadplates not on curves though so if you put it in a display it probably wont look bad i think from what i see this and all the other 6 wide vehicles will fit much better on the newer roadplates which are four studs wider than the old ones	positive
thats a really nice mod badsneaker the added bulk serves it well	positive
that looks like one of those big strange recycle trucks from new york city i like it	positive
i like this set but i cant give it a good grade for playability as the rearmost hinging section is too stiffly hinged so when you open it its likely to break if you hold it just over the shovel and broom my truck thus has that function and with it of course the whole container tipping disabled i also moved the cab a bit forward and the front axle rearward to give the cab the typical garbage truck look as they are often very low slung this also created space behind the cab for some equipment	negative
