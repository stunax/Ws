-1 these are pretty good, but i think they look too much like the standard town roads from that period. i like the black space plates from the early 90s better (6710).

-1 first, what i liked sooooo much was the cover of these plates, with this large picture of a classic space scene. i still have a '306' misb just to keep that nice feeling of taking it out of a plastic box, and look at it... there were different versions of the cover though. second, the markings of the landing platform changed at some point. i'd have to check it later when i'm at home, think it had something to do with the interupted yellow lines...

-1 why pay $350 dollars, just download the instructions on buy the pieces off bricklink. this is was i did when i wanted to create the blacktron ii in the futuron colour scheme. also i tend to like both sets of base plates, i bought the black ones myself and they were of great use but there more for creating the idea of a city or space station, something more completely man made. the gray ones give a better look of the roads being laid over bare rock especially when you introduce the plates with the craters. i would love to see a 48*48 baseplate with roads through them which would allow more building space on the side and maybe some craters. also 48*48 baseplates with craters but a few different kinds to create more or a realistic look and less of a repeating pattern. and with all those rocks you have to put everything up on supports, much better looking bases then.

0 i also love these plates! i build a lot with them (e.g. this ). unfortunately they are not available in bley ...

0 lokix, on jul 11 2008, 03:00 pm, said: by looking at the pictures used to display this set i've a sneaky suspicion it did not come with instructions but meant for the pictures to be ideas. the whole set was suppose to teach children to use their imagination, giving them instructions would somewhat defeat this while trying to figure how to build things from looking at pictures would be a much better educational experience. but i don't wanna use my imagination!

-1 year released: 1976 piece count: 53 minifigs: 2 lego brought out floating boats quite early, and in many ways the first were the best. (i'll explain why later...) this set in particular is interesting as it came out in two versions; one that includes the first minifigs and another that included the non-armless type. (set 709.) the police signs are stickers, and are in surprisingly good condition considering the age of the set. (i am missing one sticker on the front though.) note the technic bush and axel; they are the old type. the position of the second figure is not a mistake; i think he's supposed to be sitting down.... the first boats out by lego needed a weighted keel to prevent them.... keeling over. (i have tested this!) i suspect this is because of the density of the old hulls and the flat bottom... but i could be wrong. (it can't be just because of the flat bottom as the new cargo ship doesn't need one.) the keel in detail. the bottom extension is for a motor. (not included, nor made by lego at the time.) the keel had longer studs. even now it holds extra firmly. this is why i prefer the old design. you can extend or shorten the hulls as you please, or even insert other lego in the middle. you can easily add wheels or any other piece to the bottom of these hulls. i wish they would go back to this idea; the 4+ hulls were of this concept but were too wide. (probably so the keel wasn't needed.) the old minifigs aside from having odd feet and no arms had a normal stud as the neck. thus when you turn the head it tends to come off. i love this set!

1 great review sinner. i own the later version, 709 released in 1977. mine no longer has decals though. the variations were minimal. it looks like your boat is in really good shape considering it's >30 years old. excellent review!

-1 thank you for the nice review, sinner. holodoc, on aug 1 2008, 08:59 am, said: nice review sinner! the old sets... i dont know - every old set, especially equipped with the old non-moveable arms minifigs look very odd nowadays. i agree with you with the hull shape and its possibility to be extended, but every other aspect, the lack of detail, the keel itself (you cant float it in shallow water) keeps me from rating it higher than 3/10. in my opninion the best police boat so far is 4021 *click to enlarge* well, if you're meaning really old sets, than i agree with you, but a lot of the sets from the very late 1970s and onwards are still very nice. this set just isn't a good example, that's all. oh, and i also agree with you about that police boat. however, the newer one in the city line is also great, imo. the only thing that weighs against it is the giant size, which makes it feel awkward in more classic towns. edited by grevious, 03 august 2008 - 06:30 pm.

-1 lol! i can't help but smile everytime i see the quote on this thread..... don't worry these police are armless! lol

1 well what to say? i got this boat late 70s, when we were on our way to italy to spend the holidays there. my parents always needed to keep my quiet during the 3-day trip, and the best way to do that was to buy me a lego set... i got this one in a gas station in germany. as far as i remember italy didn't have lego sets, so a gas station close to the italian border but still in germany or austria was very often their last chance. i often saw large quantities of lego sets in those gas stations though... i remember seeing yellow castle and... the galaxy explorer, standing on a shelf. it would be my birthday 1-3 week(s) later so i always made sure they knew what to buy for me...

0 so, you've been bitten by the classic bug too, sinner. great review; but one would think arms would come in handy (pun intended) when you are a police officer, right? it's a shame that many of the original figs must now be forced to stand looking like they have their hands in their pockets, eh? i have no idea where i was going with that last sentence...

1 as you may have seen in my topic in general lego discussion, i received a bunch of old lego from my step-grandmother-in-law. among the bricks were instructions and pieces for an almost complete set 345 from 1969. i was very excited to find this out, so i put it together. i recently took it apart and re-assembled it, taking photographs along the way for the sake of eurobricks. so, without further ado, set 345: house with car. first off is the car. this was still constructed in the bucket of bricks i received, so i never took it apart: next i'll show you the instructions. lots of added bricks per step, which was fun. however, the angle of the instructions sometimes made it difficult to find where things were supposed to go. the in-build shots. finally, an all-around view of the finished set. sadly, i don't have much time to post more pictures or thoughts. however, i'll try to come back and update the review later this week. until then, enjoy!

1 great review. i never had this set, but it looks nice. i really like the checker pattern near the big window.

0 way before my time, too--in fact, this set came out twenty years before i was born! the baseplate doesn't actually have dots--i'm not sure if they were there once, and then rubbed off (a possibility, as the studs are rather smoother than i imagine they once were), or if this particular one didn't have the dots. this set also shows that the difficulty lego has in doing vehicle scale isn't new. the house is the perfect size for microfigures from the lego games; however, the car is massive--over twice as tall as a microfig!

1 great review mariko! this set is way before my time too. i like how lego used to create simple one story houses instead of the really tall house that we see in today's town theme, such as 8403 city house. one story houses such as 345 just look more realistic to my eyes. the simplistic, minimalism vibe that i get with this set is something that is hard to find in today's much more detailed sets (although, trust me, i love love love today's detailed sets). - the brick is epic

1 image link from brickset i thought i would do a pic review of the 1st lego castle, the yellow castle, #375- released in 1978. first, let me say that this set was truly "ahead of it's time". it introduced new building concepts (such as the hinge and new figs (most were still the armless, faceless mini-figs during this time). this set introduced me to castle which was my first real favorite theme. i enjoyed breaking it out from the garage and building it again. the majority of the pieces are 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 1x4, 1x6, and 1x8 standard yellow bricks. the set also includes yellow 1x4, 1x6x2, and 1x8x2 arches, yellow 2x2, 2x3, and 2x4 bricks, various grey plates, 1x2 black inverted slopes, red drawbridge pieces, two classic red castle doors, 8 hinges (2 for each corner), and a few other nifty pieces including six red 1x1 windows. a complete inventory is available at peeron: 375 inventory. a view from the front. the drawbridge is 6x8. the front tower stands 12 1/3 bricks high (plenty of room for horses). the drawbridge does work. the string (originally black) is attached to the opposite side between a plate and the arches. the right side of the castle (identical to the left). i've always loved the 2x2x3 sloped bricks (and corner pieces): the back. i love these red doors. a 1x4 brick attached to the other side of the baseplate keeps intruders out. that banner was the original sticker piece. notice the wear. the rear tower, largest of the towers: and backside: two hinges at each of the corners allow the corners to open for playability: before opening: open: lots of arches add to the detail of the inner walls: inner front: this set included 14 figs (how about that for quantity). unfortunately, i peeled off worn stickers from the shields and the breast plates years ago. the blue castle guards and knights are the keepers of the castle. i still think that these helmets are the best lego ever made. they just look good. the black and white knights: and the red knights: i've always prefered to use the black and red guards and flags from the knight's joust set(s): conclusion the yellow castle is truly a classic set and i'm so glad i kept the pieces to this together after all these years. if you have a chance to buy one or even obtain the set instructions, it's worth building and wouldn't be difficult to substitute grey or other colors. i hope you enjoyed this review and feel free to share your comments.

1 nice review! i haven't built yellow castle for many years, but i do remember the fun i had building it when i was young... yellow castle just opened up an entire new world for me... also, i liked all the alternate models on the box :od wish i still had that...

0 there's two alternates on the back of the instructions and as i recall, some sort of bridge on the inner fold or back of box. i threw away the box to this set years ago- just lucky to still have all the pieces. with standard pieces, you can build all these alternates and many more. that's why i don't particularly care for the new castles (like vladek's). they make building so difficult and duplicate pieces are so limited. here's an old shot of the castle in the city that it use to guard. we played for hours back in these days,

1 great review. it is nice to see an in-depth photo review of this set. i especially love the last picture of your old city! it certainly does bring back memories...

0 question for you guys, what's the best way to clean lego? i was noticing that the baseplates and gray plates to this set are very dusty and could use a good cleaning. mild soap water soak? is there a better way?

1 toothbrush and mild soap - and lots of time gently scrubbing a cleaning. and great review - i love that set *wub* *wub* i'm sorry that you seem to miss the stickers - if you find somewhere to download printable copies of them please let me know *satis* kimt

0 i guess it's easiest to put the entire shield on a transparent sticker and cut the edges. i would also do that with the white stickers, because now you can still see the gray edges of the shield. perhaps you can make a bigger black, or brown in the other case, outline. you also wouldn't be able to see if the sticker is exactly in the middle...

0 quote so you're using two layers (stickers) doesn't that make it very thick? not really. i think it works out very fine. 1. print out the image. 2. put on the plastic. 3. cut out the image. 4. apply on the part.

1 as stated in the first post, over 2 years ago, yes, it is. this is a wonderful review, the brickster, and this would truly be a great set to own. *wub* ~peace

1 great review! the set is really nice, i love that the front of the motercycle can turn and the engine is just beautiful, with its half stacked bricks like kieldaman said. the price used or new is quite a bit, but there is a good variety of bricks here like the bricks inside the wheels. did you get this set from your father? great review luxorv!

1 luxorv this is an awesome review. the classic-ness of this set is just lovely. it's so easy to just fall in love with this set. you're review is outstanding as well, the pictures are so clear and the review is just solid. you've really polished your reviewing skills

1 wow, talk about illegal connections, eh? great review. i really like this set, even for its age

1 thanks for the feedback guys! indeed this is a great set, and i'm very attached to it. as far as i remember, i got it for say my 2nd birthday, i think but it is not my first lego set. you'll learn more on this in my next planned review

1 luxorv, this is a well written presentation on this lego vintage review. i never knew the existence of this set and even though the design is not part of the modern lego design concept but the overall appeal back in the 1970s certainly appeal to many. i could not mind to own such vintage lego model and put them on display and potray as if it was a chart of evolution of lego motorbikes. thanks for sharing and i can't wait to find out your next review.

1 thanks 'luxorv' for this review of such a classic old lego set and i do remember seeing these in a catalogue years ago. excellent brick-built police cycle, i think it's time lego did another one eh ? brick on ride on everyone !

1 theme: hobby sets set name: thatcher perkins locomotive set number: 396 price (new): 369-450 $, 258-314 euro price (used): 100-355 $, 45-250 euro pieces: 434 year of release: 1976 links: peeron, bricklink and brickset my father assures me this is the very first lego set i ever got. in facts, he gave it to me as a present for my first half year. of course, that is to say he bought it for himself and used me as the official excuse! when i grew up, at first i found it to be quite boring: no minifigures, limited play features; in the end, it was just a locomotive! it soon went to forgotten-land. then, when i was about 10 years old, i one day found again the instructions booklet and saw this bright coloured big steam engine, and i suddenly wanted to build it again. it would seem i finally got to the right age (at least for me) to appreciate the design of this great set. but enough about memories; lets start with the review! the box front the front of the box (here cut and folded to save space) shows the thatcher perkins locomotive in all its glory upon a nice countryside landscape. i really appreciate how tlg box designers used a real life environment made of sand, gravel and pebbles to give this hobby set a better background. moreover, the landscape does not distract the eye, since the focus is strongly set on the locomotive itself. the box measures about 39.5 x 24.5 x 5.5 centimetres, or 15.56 x 9.65 x 2.17 inches. this is more or less the size of the 4840 - the burrow, or the advent calendars. back (and sides) the back of the box shows the model on a more neutral background and from another angle. we can see the stickers in place (take a good look at them here, because i did not apply them). the right side we also see a pic of the set from the (3/4) back, and one with a child playing with it. in this latter shot, the model rests upon a nice black box with a thatcher perkins sign on it. unlike the harley davidson 1000cc set, the thatcher perkins does not have the sign designed for experienced lego builders for some reason. contents inside this set includes a large number of parts, mainly black, blue and red, with some nice yellow to lighten it up more. parts of interest the parts selection is not exceptional, but well see this set includes some unique pieces which have not been in lego sets for long years since the 1980s, like the very nice black plate, modified 1 x 2 with steam engine cylinder, flat surfaces, black train wheel spoked for motor and the red train steam drive rod holder - train steam drive rod group. the wheel spoked large, as beautiful as they were, saw the light from the production line for the last time in 1976! the only new mold used in this set is the black and blue slope, inverted 45 2 x 2 old type with round bottom tube. as you can see in the above picture, this locomotive was designed to work (well, be played with) on all kind of surfaces, so the wheels sport tyres. in this picture you can see how they look without the tyres. of course, builders can use the thatcher perkins on their brick-built tracks. another group of interesting parts are shown in this pic: red wheel spoked 2 x 2 with stud (and tyre), black brick, modified 2 x 4 with wheels holder old, clear bottom and yellow minifig, head (plain) - stud solid. many newer fans will not be familiar with the last two parts: they were standard fare in a number of sets between the 1960s and early 1990s, but then (unfortunately) they were taken out of production. to be fair, the replacement of the black brick, modified 2 x 4 with wheels holder old, clear bottom with the standard technic parts was probably due to the fact that the metal pin used to connect the wheels to these bricks had a shameful tendency at getting off the wheel. too bad it could not be fixed and these parts kept in production. for those interested, here is a picture of the dss, courtesy of peeron. instructions cover  as usual, the instructions are not organised in the form of a booklet, but they consist of a folded double printed sheet. the cover shows again the same shot as the front of the box. back cover  here we see the name of the set and some additional information, like the year when the first thatcher perkins started working (1863) and the type (4-6-0) of this locomotive, which, as shown in the image, is related to the number and position of the wheels. on a side note, the pencil signs on the sides of the sheet were made by my father while counting the parts in the set. random page  as expected, no call-outs here, but the build is pretty straight forward and does not need them. the colours are easy to tell apart. full page  as you may have noticed, all the building steps are drawn on one side of the booklet, making it more properly an instructions sheet. what really makes this instruction booklet stand out in my eyes is the fact that it is indeed a poster: the building steps are all on one side, while the other is a bigger image of the completed set with the name thatcher perkins in yellow enclosed in an old styled red tag. building start the build starts with the base of the locomotive, putting the 10 wheels in place and strengthening the engine. notice the use of this illegal technique to build the bumpers. lego, as we all know can be a tricky medium to build with, and some details need special solutions to be completed. we then start building the boiler and cabin. going up fast and steady! in the penultimate step, we build the chimney and cow catcher. id like to spend a few more words on the chimney and how it is attached to the main body. as you can see in the left picture, the 3x3 base of the chimney is asymmetrical, with a 3x2 base on one side and a combination of a 1x2 and a 1x1 plates on the other. in the right picture, you see the top of the main body where the chimney will be attached; it is made of a 1x2 base and 1 1x2 tile. using another illegal technique (or at least one lego designers do not like much nowadays), the holes of the 3x2 plate of the chimney will connect with the studs of the 1x2 plate on the main body, giving a well centred and quite sturdy build. finished set front the front of the model sports 3 big headlights, a nice cow catcher and the nicely detailed engine front. i can almost hear it whistle! side and here it is our good old thatcher perkins locomotive! indeed, it looks like a classic and powerful engine form one of those spaghetti western films, doesnt it? what i found strange in the beginning is the choice of colours (i was convinced steam engines were all black, at the time). then i checked some pictures of the original, and i must admit the resemblance is almost perfect! back the back side is less detailed than the front, with cabin almost devoid of details. i think lego could have done a better job on it. 3/4 front and  just see how good it looks from this angle, with all the tubing, moving parts and the lovely 3 headlights!  3/4 back the back view is not as impressive, but grants us a good look at the big posterior wheels and the bumpers. bonus images size comparison? as i stated elsewhere, i never understood what scale these hobby sets are meant to be. they are clearly not minifig-scale, and they are not technic-fig-scale either. but they are not even miniland scale! moreover, they use different scales between locomotives, cars and motorbikes amongst the hobby set line! as i said before, the set comes with tyres on the wheels to allow a wider playing experience, not limiting this model to tracks. nonetheless, builders can assemble their own track (maybe using the vintage blue 4.5v tracks) and make the thatcher perkins run its proper environment. final comments overall, this is a great set for collectors of old models and steam engines fans, or both. it does not sport a huge variety of bricks, but was a good choice at the time, and even if the result is matter-of-fact a bit blocky when compared to the original, it implements some good solutions to minimise the lego brick appearance and maximise the similarity as much as possible. design & colour scheme  8/10 (the design is as accurate as possible, and the colours are completely in line for the thatcher perkins locomotive. the solutions and details included in this set justify the expert builders label and add to the appearance, and, why not, playability of the model. though, i still wish tlg had included more details in the cabin.) parts - 10/10 (quite a big selection, but only one new mould. nonetheless, a good source of black, blue and red standard parts for mocs and one of the few sources for the extra rare black plate, modified 1 x 2 with steam engine cylinder, flat surfaces, black train wheel spoked for motor, red train steam drive rod holder - train steam drive rod group and wheel spoked large.) playability - 9/10 (a sturdy model which can take some serious play and swoosh-ing without falling apart. the somewhat easily detachable chimney and the lack of an appropriate scale interaction with most other models make it lose one point, though.) build - 7/10 (pretty straight forward, with few nice solutions.) price - 5/10 (like most older models, especially the hobby set and model team ones, this set can only rarely be found at reasonable prices. most of the times, people are asked shameful prices for such a smallish set.) overall: 8/10 very good. more pictures can be found in this brickshelf gallery. as always, questions, comments, and pic requests welcome!

1 thanks for the review 'luxorv', an interesting old set, though i find it hard to imagine a square smoke stack instead of roundish. it truly has that classic lego simplistic build with all studs showing and making do with standard partsm except the few you havepointed out 'luxorv'. a nice flashback 35 years ago....now thats old school anyway brick on everyone !

1 thanks, luxor, for bringing us this excellent tour round an old classic! for its time, this is truly a remarkably detailed and beautiful set, and i think it's amazing how it's still in such good condition after all this time. do you have any more from this era (excepting the harley, of course )? i've created a whole new index to put them in

1 thank you very much for this wonderful review! this is the oldest lego set in my collection. i received this model from my grand parents many years ago - i'm not exactly sure who in my family it used to belong to, but it has a home with me now. it's a very simple but attractive looking vehicle, and functions pretty well too. overall, very nice.

1 thanks for the great nostalgic review! great pictures, i love the shiny glow of 37 year old bricks! sets were simpler back then, but not less exciting in their own way. i wasn't even born in 1973, but one of my first sets was the 1982 update of this, 6630 bucket loader. almost 10 years later, but the very same bucket assembly, only the colours have changed.

1 ah, the good old days........thanks for the review 'yoshi648' - cute and cool at the same time. it's interesting to see that the same front end parts had been used from the early 70's up in to the late 90's ! nice again to step back in time and keep on bricking everyone !

1 i voted 'outstanding.' regarding this set, i found mine at a consignment store. it was inside of a larger set from the same time period.

0 woah. 25 cents for a mint condition set! that's amazing.

0 well, it's not exactly a large shuttle, but still a nice set: 442 space shuttle year released: 1979 piece count: 79 minifigs: 1 vehicles: 0 list price: unknown this little classic was my smallest classic space set. believe it or not, i still have the box: here's the back: the instructions are pretty tattered and missing a section. i had to download some from the web: but the ship is again intact, missing only one grey 1x3 plate: i've always liked this computer piece: here's the under side. this set included the small classic jet engines: a close-up of the sloped printed space brick: and the complete set with minifig: this set was a great little space ship that made a nice addition to the blue space theme. as small as it was, it could hold two-three figs (one standing up). i don't even think the mars mission recon drop ship holds three figs. in any case, it was a must-have for blue space fans, and probably only a few bucks back in the day. swoosh!

1 it's simply amazing how far lego has come in 30 years.

1 and again those tears in my eyes. with original box...! i really love those classic space stuff. looks like i need to clean my stuff this summer.

1 this was my first space set ever!! 1979, 1980... don't know anymore, but i do remember i got this together with 897 for my birthday when we where camping... with a little luck i may even have an old film from my dad, opening the boxes... well what to say... it looked soooooo aggressive with those two engines! but i never knew why you needed two steering wheels on it... they probably just thought a symmetrical model was better .... i can't blame them... what a nice set.... it would even sell today, no doubt... looooots of swooshability...

1 the computer is my favorite part. sadly, i dont own any classic space...exept for some space police, and a blue classic space man.

1 nice!!! 442 is the lowest set number i have seen for any classic space set, so it must been released with the first wave in 1978. its remarkable that a lego spaceship this old and small can seat more figs than the much bigger mx-71 recon dropship of today. anyway, i just want to grab it out of the screen and swoosh it all over the place, lol. tlg, please make these classic space sets again! i promise i'll buy many!

1 very brave to give an impression about one of the oldest sets ever reviewed! a lot members here are younger than the set itself. i think you will have to have grown up with it to like it. nowadays we have seen quite a few better airplanes than that one, for example this years 7643 . but thanks for letting us know. btw., the 1x1 round brick with the solid stud is no. 3062a instead of 3062b (with the hollow stud).

0 i'm sorry you had to move this topic, white fang. when it was in the reviewers academy, the teachers agreed it belonged in other themes. *shrug* i guess it ended up where it belonged eventually.

0 great review, it's good to see some of the old sets reviewed. i think i learned something about the history of lego from this one.

1 outstanding review of a very special set! i actually remember seeing this set on the store shelves of local department stores. can you believe it? fantastic review walter. i really enjoy looking at these vintage sets. this one deserves a blog!

1 i really like the design, it has an aesthetic value lacking from most official lego planes and follows closely to the real thing (minus the colours), something that can't really be claimed for more recent sets.

1 483 alpha-1 rocket base year released: 1979 piece count: 170 minifigs: 3 vehicles: 1 (two sections) list price: unknown despite the nuclear non-proliferation treaty of 1968, lego dared design a rocket base complete with a rocket system that may have had nuclear capability in 1979. luckily, the rocket was defective having rather flimsy white bricks that did not stay together well during launch attempts. lego scrapped its wmd program and the result was this classic "blue era" space set known as the alpha-1 rocket base. instructions: on the backside of the instructions, the set is featured with the space command center, space cruiser, and a few vehicle sets: the set includes three figs: and this great rocket fuel tanker: here's the front section complete with computer: and the rocket fuel section: the set has some interesting features including the control section, fuel control, and launch pad: on top of the control section is a nicely design radar/tracking system: here's the open control room: the launch pad and fuel control: the fuel control includes two sink pieces and blue steering wheels: and lego's wmd (weapon of mass destruction), the alpha-1 on the launch pad: here's a shot of the launching mechanism: unfortunately, i have lost one of the blue sink/faucet pieces as well as a black hose: a close-up of the alpha-1 rocket. the white bricks never stayed together well often times coming apart within your hands: the arming and guidance system was nicely designed: a view of the complete set: and another: this is a great set. the base, fuel vehicle, and launch platform offers a great amount of playability. my only complaint is the rocket (as mentioned above). i don't think i ever played with it a sa kid because it always fell apart. share your comments regarding this classic space set.

0 thebrickster, on jul 4 2008, 04:14 am, said: a close-up of the alpha-1 rocket. the white bricks never stayed together well often times coming apart within your hands: huh, did they not think of putting a technic axle down the center of the rocket? come to think of it, when were technic axles invented.... its a neat little set, makes me think i oughta make some similar kinda layout in ldd, very elegant for playability.

0 i always thought that that grey thing on top of the rocket was some kind of satelite... xenologer, on jul 4 2008, 05:25 am, said: huh, did they not think of putting a technic axle down the center of the rocket? come to think of it, when were technic axles invented.... i had this set as a kid and i don't think there was a technic axle inside that rocket, but if i remember correctly some of the later cs rockets did.

1 ahh, the good old days. thanks for the review.

1 hey eb'ers, i got my market street on monday and finished building it last night. i know it?s not such a nice review like *yoda* did the last times, but i hope you enjoy some of the pics. first a pic of the complete building: the 3 minifigs: and i pic of the stairs (one of my highlights at this set): more pics you can find here my opinion about the set: i like this set very much, it was really fun to build it. i?m happy that that i got some more cherries and a croissant now *sweet* , a funny idea is the salad in the one box at the front. i think normally it?s a hairpiece of an exoforce fig. i also like the colours of the house, the dark blue is sooooo nice. i think i have to take more of this soon. the lighter blue is also nice. this set has really nice details like the stairs, or the owl at the entry of the market, or the balcony. i paid 89,99 eur, a fair price for a really nice set!! greetings sandra

-1 thanks for the great review! *sweet* now that i've seen the set, i'm afraid i'm a bit disappointed 8-| 1) the color combination doesn't really do it for me. blue, dark blue, grey, black, tan, white, they're all mixed together without any over all design... 2) is there any interior? it doesn't look like it, and in any case, you can only reach it if you remove the modules... hm... |-/ now it looks too much of a box... 3) there are most certainly some nice ideas in this model and some great parts. the best part of the model is the staircase 4) i don't think he spent much time in thinking about the design. as apo said, the chimneys on top of a garage is kinda weird, there's also a gate, next to another gate which is weird as well... also, if this is supposed to ba a grocery, then the owner has done a lot to hide it. the croissant is nice, but next to the brown box with vegies, there's nothing that suggests this is a shop... 5) the white lamp and the the yellow cylinder are at the same level of the tiles. imo it should be above the level of the tiles... 6), imo not worth the 90 euro edited by snefroe1, 20 june 2007 - 09:03 am.

1 thanks, i love the look of this set! i love the mix of colours, it breaks up the model rather than being a single monotone colour. he's used several complimentary colours in order to make up the model. i agree i think the chimneys on the flat roof is weird ontop of the garage, but not so weird one you place it ontop of the building. i guess he's done it to give us the choice of roofs and chimneys. you can always remove the ones you don't like... he also seems to have screwed up a bit on the tiling for the sidewalk on the side module. on cafe corner (and the building module of this set) the sidewalk has the pattern light grey 1x6 at the front, then dark grey 1x2 next, then dark grey 2x2's. however on this he's put the 2x2 tiles first then the 1x2's at the back. easilly fixable though. overall i love this set, thanks for the pics! compliments cafe corner perfectly.

1 thank you legocastlegirls for your quick review! *y* it?s the first time i realize the back of the market street. the tan bricks are a replacement for some windows i?d guess? i do love that building, especially the top floor with the neat balcony. *wub* of course you are (again) left alone filling the interior. but i just had some food parts ordered at bricklink... x-d one thing i?d like to know: this is an online-exclusive, right? can i order it at a lego-store (k?ln / oberhausen) and get the sum rewarded on my voucher booklet? *sweet* i heard it here, but i?m not sure. 8-| if anyone is looking for how to fill it with interior: go read the latest brickjournal #8! there?s a whole chapter written about designing the rooms. interior on!

1 hi thanks for posting those great pictures. i got the cc some time ago and i really looking forward to get my hands on the market street. i think the colour scheme of this set is great, maybe because blue is my favourite colour (just check my wardrobe)? i really like the design of the roof and the staircase. i ?am not so sure if i like the gateways but i believe they will grow on me when i get the set myself snefroe1, on jun 20 2007, 09:02 am, said: 5) the white lamp and the the yellow cylinder are at the same level of the tiles. imo it should be above the level of the tiles... i? am totally agree with snefreo1, the yellow cylinder and the lamppost should be on a level above the tiles. actually i have put a 2x2 plat under the lamppost on my cc, looks much better if you ask me. unfortunately shop at home does not send to norway???, so i have to purchase this set in billund (yes, i ?am going to legoland this summer) or on ebay.

0 apophisv, on jun 20 2007, 10:32 am, said: btw, could you exchange the modules and make pics of that? i'd like to see how the building looks with the flat roof instead of the dutch style one. i?m sure that a could do that. it?s a good idea, i hope you can wait a few days, i?ll do it this weekend and make more pics then. holodoc, on jun 20 2007, 03:22 pm, said: thank you legocastlegirls for your quick review! *y* it?s the first time i realize the back of the market street. the tan bricks are a replacement for some windows i?d guess? i do love that building, especially the top floor with the neat balcony. *wub* of course you are (again) left alone filling the interior. but i just had some food parts ordered at bricklink... x-d i also think that this is a replacement for some windows and i like this idea, because i often see houses with that kind of "windows" holodoc, on jun 20 2007, 03:22 pm, said: one thing i?d like to know: this is an online-exclusive, right? can i order it at a lego-store (k?ln / oberhausen) and get the sum rewarded on my voucher booklet? *sweet* i heard it i don?t know that this is an online-exclusive.. but i know that you can order it at your legostore, and when you get it, you get the stamps for your voucher booklet at your next visit at the legostore. but you have to bring the bill with you. barbossa, on jun 20 2007, 04:10 pm, said: i? am totally agree with snefreo1, the yellow cylinder and the lamppost should be on a level above the tiles. actually i have put a 2x2 plat under the lamppost on my cc, looks much better if you ask me. yeah i also agree with snefrooe and you. i?ve never seen holes at the footpath for some lamps. it is really dangerous for all the nice little minifigs :-) greetings sandra

1 i'm not much of a city fan but this looks great. i guess this is the closest we can get to legoland (miniland) quality sets. and considering this is a three floro, small structure, and it's over 1,000 parts, just imagine (pun not intended) how many peices are in ll california's empire state building or wtc freedom tower models! both are large and in real scale over 100 floors! that's a lot of bricks. anyways, i've got a friend who loves city. i'm sure this one would make a great addition to his town setup! gotta tell him about this new set! *y*

1 legocastlegirl, on jun 20 2007, 07:42 am, said: i know it?s not such a nice review like *yoda* did the last times, but i hope you enjoy some of the pics. nonsense sandra !! tks for sharing these cool pics ;-) its also a nice hommage to erik brok. i really like this set, i think its really well designed with great ideas such as the dual stairs, the balconies, the croissant insignia, the market entrance design with the horns, whip and owl 8-? i like the color combination, and the mosaic design just in front of the entrance. the only terrible flaw is that yellow cinlinder !! that is just awful for a flower pot :-x i don't mind at all having that lamp post at the same level since it would be normal to have the base of the lamp at the level of the tile but i agree that is just pickering about an insignificant detail :-p legocastlegirl, on jun 20 2007, 07:42 am, said: a funny idea is the salad in the one box at the front. i think normally it?s a hairpiece of an exoforce fig. yeay that is just brilliant all the way 8-? this is a great set indeed and a must have for town fans !! *yoda*

0 i can't believe i missed this great review! thanks for the pictures, sandra!

1 i also missed your review, but now that i found it i really happy i just ordered the set :) thanks for the pics! peter

1 legocastlegirl, on jun 20 2007, 05:20 pm, said: i also think that this is a replacement for some windows and i like this idea, because i often see houses with that kind of "windows" there was once "windowtaxes" in the netherlands. when rich people became poor, they placed bricks in their window, so they paid less taxes. some older houses still has walls were once were windows. historic information on :-d :-p

0 it was the same thing in france in the middle-age... happy that today this taxe is gone! :-d

1 hi all! i just got my first gentle giant sw maquette and i?m in love *wub* *wub*! it looks so coooool ...... *y*! here?s some facts: height: 13.8 cm color: black 8-? helmet: non removable #?s made: 500 pieces sold at: blister event tokyo june 16, 2007 and now some pictures: i will crush you with my left bigtoe x-d! on the catwalk x-d! now i just have to wait for my boba fett, luke skywalker and get the stormtrooper & darth vader ..... >:-)! on my shelf on copmike

0 woooooooooooow! that's some maquette! say, i wonder if the blackhole stormie will be playable in lswtcs? maquette on!

1 you?re a lucky man.... *y* thanks for those cool pics. :'-)

1 you're the coolest man i know! thanks for sharing copmike. that thing is awesome.

0 thank you, interesting indeed. those are quite expensive though, perhaps 60 dollars or more.

1 very nice *wub* how'd you get a hold of it?

1 thats so cool! i would want one. it would look good in the house. -zots

1 wow, if the tru 6212 is to be believed, the luke marque costs $50. but that looks so cool. definitely a keeper.

-1 the lightsabers are strangely skinny. do they light up or something? or was the transparent plastic too expensive to make thick blades? :-/ :-p

1 hi, you are right, this is such a fantastic maquette. i really hope that i will get the chance to own the other 4, too. it is carefully packed in styropor. the painting is nice, looks really evil. i think it is a wonderful addition (with the 4 other) to any collector shelf..(-; mine is number 276. greetings hendrik

0 i have #70 (and #8 :-$ ). boba soon on copmike

1 well it has taken me over 2 years but i have finally bought this maquette! it's a real beauty! just don't ask what it cost! my set of maquettes is finally complete.

1 great reason to review a great thread. your collection is truely something to behold.

1 damn you for making me want these now! seriously, these look amazing and would look great on any bookshelf.

1 wow thats so cool mutley. my favourites are darth vader and luke skywalker because the others seem to have funny looking heads. not so much boba fett but the storm trooper and the blackhole stormtrooper do. it must be their helmets. edited by roncanator, 02 december 2009 - 08:29 am.

1 well, now that i have some money, a trip to toysrus was obviously in my future, especially since my local tru has much of the summer 2007 lineup. when i got there, almost all the smaller castle sets had been sold out, but there was one left: the one i am now reviewing for both eurobricks and bzpower. ;-) the box: well, for starters, the castle theme boxes are beautiful! the blended clear and stormy skies give a great ?clash of the titans? effect, and the action poses help as well. ;-) the back is equally nice, featuring a photo showing kids how to use the crossbow, and the brave axe wielder taking a swipe at the skeleton (foolish soldier, that won?t work on skellies! see later on in the review to find out why). and of course, we have a small box with the link to the official lego website, where tlc can advertise even more lego sets! :p the contents: after opening the box, a single bag of pieces (with a couple loose ones), the instruction manual and necessary catalog ( :-p ), and a new wider rubber band holder spilt out. the instruction manual is clear as a bell. no color trouble here, folks! also, it?s worth mentioning the nice background with the mountain and king?s castle silhouettes. :-) sorry that there's no picture, but i'll take one if someone wants to see it. ;-) the pieces: for being a 5 dollar set (well, seven in my case. darn your above average prices, tru!), crossbow attack features a lot of nice pieces (as does the entire castle lineup). notable elements include two large brown spoked wheels, two brown modified 1x1?s, a pearl gold slope end, and six dark blue modified 1x1x2/3 slopes! the bulk of the pieces, however, are nothing special. i?ll let the picture do the talking for this. the accessories are by far the best parts in this kit. two different helmets in a beautiful shiny silver are my favorite, but i also really like the scythe (looks good for mocing) and the round shield ( *wub* ), which are both brand new parts. and can anyone not love the classic axe and crossbows? oh, and there?s a black lightsaber too, but that?s rather boring compared to the other parts. :-p the minifigures: can you say, four figures (including the horse)?! that has to be a record for a regular 5 dollar set, at least in the present age of limited figures per set. we?ll start out with the two crown militia: a regular soldier and an archer. both have old faces, but they look spiffy with the shiny helmets and the superb torsos. i?ll name the soldier bravo the stout and the archer angler the precise, for future references. now we come to the skellie. although some people dislike the new skeleton design, i personally prefer it to the old ones, since the arms are now poseable and the face much meaner. the only problem is that the arms hang too low, but it?s not too noticeable when they have weapons in their hands. and last, but not least, here?s the elusive skeleton horse. i for one am very happy that tlc took advantage of that awesome prototype piece and made it into an official mass-production mold. however, the horse is unfortunately one piece, but since regular lego horses are as well, i don?t have a problem with it. i do have a problem with the pose, however. the legs are in quite an odd position, and i wonder why tlc didn?t make the front and back leg poses symmetrical. ah well. the finished set: i have only two pictures here, since this set is so small. first, here?s the completed crossbow. i must say: finally! no more ridiculous horse mounted catapults or crazy fire wheel launchers! now we have realistic siege weapons, including the one included with 7090. plus, it actually launches okay, although not the best. here?s the other main attraction: the completed skeleton rider and horse. i think it?s rather dramatic with that pose and the dark background, don?t you think? ;-) playability: okay, so there?s not much in this set, but a bit of imagination brings plenty of possibilities. to show you what you can do, here?s a little story made only with this set. ;-) overall rating: presentation: 9/10 pieces: 8/10 minifigures: 9/10 finished model: 8/10 playability: 8/10 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ final score: 8.4/10 crossbow attack is a fine introduction into castle, so i recommend it to any lego fan, whether they are a castle nut or just want a cheap change of pace. tlc has a knack with making great small kits these days, and i more than ever support them in their amazing rebound from their dark ages (between 1997 and 2004). ;-) edited by kimt, 10 august 2008 - 01:33 pm.

-1 thanks for this review, and that great little comic! about the skellies though (x-d), you have to admit that besides their long arms making the skellie legs look out of proportion, that they're just made poorly. they're sticking straight out, as opposed to every other fig, which have a slight bend to make them look more natural. also, as i'm sure you've noticed, the pegs are on angles! that makes it impossible for them to hold their weapons straight, and they can't even put their arms over their heads without stressing the plastic some... i mean they're dead. well, at least undead, they're not supposed to be stiff, and personally i like the ragdoll look more, it makes them seem more dead :-p

1 a very nice review with good pictures, thanks grevious. *y* and undead ragdolls on! :-p

1 thanks for the review. that set is high up on my list; how could it not be with a price like that! (i love the added story.)

1 excellent photographs! and i like the comic too. i don't care what anyone says, i love the new skeletons. *skull*

1 nice review, and great little story. :-d *y* look at the normal horses, their legs are positioned like that too. only the skellie horse's legs are touching, so as to strengthen the middle, otherwise it could easily snap in half. also, i think the new skeletons are nice, their head is awesome, i just don't see why tlc couldn't make the bent droid arms with the hand facing vertically, instead of making a new arm design completely straight.

1 nice review and a great story also grevious, this is a great set and a nice little army builder one at that. the only thing that saddens me about the line itself is the new arms on the skelies, they just look far to big when placed next to a normal fig. for me the old versions of the skelies were far better, why tlc changed to this is beyond me. still i shall be buying alot of these sets just to increase my army.

1 tks a lot grevious for this !! regarding the set i just love it !! i really oved your comic, it was really well done and hilarious x-d eb spirit on !! vader, on jul 2 2007, 08:28 am, said: still i shall be buying alot of these sets just to increase my army. you don't say mate, i bought like 10 or so so far x-d medieval *yoda*

0 thanks for all the comments, guys, and thank you, joem16 and iamded for pointing out the reason for the skeleton horse leg positioning. ;-) well, i'll be gone on vacation until the 16, but i may pick up a set or two while down in tenessee, so if i do, expect a review and another story when i get back! ;-)

1 this is the only one of the new castle sets i've been able to get hold of so far. i know others have done it before, but as soon as i'd got it, there was something i just had to try: heh, cool! *skull*

1 grim reaper on! the new skellie looks so much more natural with the droid arm *y* !

1 great review *y* small set with great figs and pieces=must buy the story was hilarious :-) any chance you are going to review another set? i'm still waiting for a certain member *cough*hinckley*cough* to review skeleton tower :-d piranha

0 i have not seen any either.... :-/

1 here is a review of the new monster dino creator set with power functions first lets start with the box which is much larger than it needs to be!! it is one of the new style re-closeable boxes rather than the rip the sides style. this set is typical of creator and comes with three sets of instructions. the monster dino a kind of spider and a crocodile the set comes with two of the new motors one small and one large, a sound module plus the new ir controler and receiver. there is a mix of techniques in this set the core is mainly studless technic, there are some studded technic parts and most of the details are standard creator style. there are two mechanisms one to control the legs and one to control the head and arms. the leg drive is from the large motor and the arm and head are operated from the small motor the completed mechanism will stand on its own without any detail added the detail is added to the base unit to complete the model. the operation of the dino is very good the design for the motors and drives is very compact and well thought out. the walking motion works well although there is no steering and it will fall over it it encounters obstacles. the sound module is built into the head so when the mouth opens the dino roars (sort of) glyman made the comment that this set is ugly as sin and i tend to agree i think there are too many colour variations with different shades of grey, black and that lime green :-p which confuses the look of the finished model but i guess it might apeal more to younger kids. i also do not like the spikes along the back, which glow in the dark, because the are loose and keep falling off. this set is not cheap at ?70 but i guess this is because of the motors and ir controller. while on this i was surprised how good the range was on the new controller it would still operate ever when not in direct line of sight. i would give this set a 10/10 for playabilityit has kept the kid amused for hours i would give it 6/10 for value for money it is a bit pricey overall 8/10 it took approx 3 hours to build and has been well played with i have posted some more images and some videos of the finished models on my brickshelf page here if you have any questions please ask pete edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 06:28 pm. indexed

1 thanks for your review ickelpete! *y* nice little movie you made (what?s on tv in the background?) ;-) :-d after reading, i wonder more than before what this dino has to do with creator? *wacko* the complete mechanism is technic, only the "design"-pieces on top are classic-style. i agree with your comment on the colour-selection. :-x is that turquise next to lime? looks like - well, i?m not telling you what i think of right now... ;-) pretty lego set, but not for me. i?m waiting for the first pics of the ferris wheel. or even better, the 8275 technic-bulldozer :'-) *wub* new motors on!

1 thanks very much for that review. i downloaded the instructions last week and i was largely impressed with what was in it. however, like holodoc, i am waiting for the bulldozer. i might have to settle with the dino though if lego charge australian some absurd price... edit: i just watched the videos. thanks! they are great. the dino is better than i thought... edited by sinner, 10 july 2007 - 02:29 am.

0 thank you very much for that interesting review, ickelpete. *y* well, the color scheme?s pretty bad and the design of that dino?s a bit to blocky for my liking, but the two alternative models you?ve built?re quiet nice. at least there?re a lot of possibilities coming with that set.... :-)

1 ickelpete, on jul 9 2007, 11:19 pm, said: first lets start with the box which is much larger than it needs to be!! pete no lego box is too big my friend x-d ;-) nice review *y* as for the set... i don't like the colors myself (surprised? x-d ), and it seems a little blocky. otherwise, the set is cool. i really like the head.

0 ugly. as. hell. but an awesome parts pack, worthy of purchase.

1 :'-) such a beauty, the functions are great, cool video! i want to get this set so badly... great review! *y*

1 i bought this set last night and it is great. my biggest surprise was the wheels that were included; i didn't even know they existed and there aren't even that new. back to the set, he is such a cute dinosaur. :-d since he is so tubby i think he looks like a baby! i suspect my wife wanted him more than me.... my biggest interest in the set was to have more motors and ir parts so i could make an ir car. overall, i highly recomend this set, but as others have said, be warned that the box is very oversized. i wish lego would give up on this whole 1:1 picture thing. *wacko*

-1 the box is has really strange dimensions - it's very flat but has a large front - the 1:1 scale. regarding the spines, because they're made of the softer non-abs plastic (the stuff the 1994 cutlasses and brown muskets were made of), they lose their shape a bit and so are hard to grip; they simply fall off. i suppose tlc use loads of different colours because a single or two-colour dino isn't very nice to look at, especially when the surface isn't very smooth - it takes your eyes away from the surface and puts it on the colours. someone should make an all terrain dino that can walk everywhere from this set - i don't have the skill with technic - i always end up layering and never finish any models. :-(

1 thanks for the nice review. it's butt ugly to me but the motors + ir control seem pretty neat ! even at that high price, it looks like a good parts pack ! *sweet*

1 i didn't spot this great review earlier. thanks for the effort of posting all those pics and videos, they helped me decide that this set is worth getting.

1 got this baby via shop@home a little early and i though it was time to post my view of this set : (snefroe you need to get this one ;-) ) sorry for the lack of pics but there are already many pics online of this baby so here it is : best space set since... a way too long time this is my first new space themed set since more than 20 years and i must say that im not disappointed at all. i have much to say about this little gem. first, lets cut it straight about the martians minifigures: they are absolutely rubbish. i cant imagine how lego could produce such atrocity. this said; lets move on to the dropship. a real piece of art. reminiscent of the aliens movie dropship. the cockpit is spacious and provides a great field of view, too bad there is no hinges to open it, you must remove the canopy completely to switch pilot. the drilling unit can be attached under the ship with the clever use of a rubber piece. it stays well in place once attached, good point. some people dont like the inclusion of the 2 containment area for the martians and crystal on both side of the ship but i kind like it, it makes the ship less empty. the 2 wings are complete with air intake, some armaments and 1 standard launcher on the right wing. normally i dont like launchers but this one is very discrete and well integrated. on the tail section are 2 thrusters that can be rotated and provide thus some realistic movements to the ship. one of the last highlight of this ship is the landing gears, or i must say landing dishes. 6 medium sized radar dishes provide and incredible stability to the set. they are quite sturdy and can take a beating. im not going to review the alien spaceship in detail since its quite uninteresting. i consider it more like a bonus addition to the set than anything else. the look is passable and there are some interesting building techniques in it. thats all. to end the review, a little pros/cons table. (we all love pros/cons table :-) ) pros: - incredible design - at last a decent space set - modular functions - quite sturdy - beautiful - great value for money cons: - martians are rubbish - no hinges for the canopy - the drilling unit could use some more details. score: 9/10 by the way , i added a nice cool feature on my site , you can download the stickers for some sets that i own. before building i always scan the stickers, we never know it could come handy. check this out on my site (you need to go in the lego lists on the left): [vtx] classic games

1 great review, i must admit i didn't like mm at first site, but seeing this review and looking at the mm boxes at stores appeal to me rather greatly, i may get a couple of these sets, great job! *y* :-)

0 i've got it also, but i think i'll replace the ball joint pieces with the kind of pieces that give the wings their angle.

1 i like the dropship kit and got this. now that i built it i see so many things i can do to tweak it to make it a moc. i think this is a set everyone mm fan should get.

1 nice review!

-1 of course, right before i post this i see that ickelpete reviewed this set earlier in the week. sorry for being redundant but it is already written so here ya go: monster dino reviewed by dunamis set 4958 792 pieces $89.95 from lego online store build time 3.5 hours here we go with another offering from the creator line. i?m kind of fond of these sets as they are pretty imaginative and usually have instructions for multiple models. i like the reusability of all the pieces and the varied things you can build. the box: the box that lego shipped this thing in was absolutely huge! when i first got this in the mail, i thought i had won the lottery and they had shipped the ucs falcon early. once i opened the shipping box, i was surprised to see an unusually large creator set box. the box itself is pretty standard creator type box but this one shows off the power functions prominently on the right side of the box. the back of the box shows some of the motorized features as well. opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals. we?re back to the reusable cereal box type tab system for those of you who stay up a night wondering about lego?s next box design. inside the box we have a bunch of sealed bags. immediately the power brick, remote and motors stand out as they are each in individual bags. also, there are three manuals. the manuals: the three manuals are 76, 76 and 56 pages in length. they are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - piece call outs for each step - parts inventory at the end of the primary model build - page numbers color separation in these manuals were fine for me. interestingly, the instructions for the primary build took a full manual plus about a quarter of another manual. random manual photos: parts list i?ll explain a bit more below, but it would have been nice to have some written documentation on all the functions of the motors, remote and receiver. such as motor load guidelines and specific explanations of all the remote control functions. it is severely lacking in this area. the pieces: obviously, the pieces we?re most interested in are these new motors and wireless remote control. note that before you fire this bad boy up, you had better byob. since this is prominently a european community, i had better clarify my acronyms. over here across the pond, byob usually means ?bring your own beer?. in this case, it still means bring your own beer (i?m on my second heineken right now) but in addition to numerous bottles of beer you will need a total of nine batteries to get through this set. i kid you not: anyway, there are two motors (a small and a large) each with its own very unique name according to the manual; the smaller one is called ?motor? and the larger one is called ?xl motor?. very creative indeed! the battery box takes six aa batteries and there are two compartments to hold them. here is the first: that seems pretty normal. however, the back side of it holds the other three batteries and it seems to be very poorly designed: note in the photo above where the bottom battery is placed. compare it to the previous photo and you will see the difference. i played around with trying to get that bottom battery out and you better pack a lunch (or byob) because it is no small task! why couldn?t they make this compartment just like the other side? there is a single power cord connector and a three position switch. the middle position turns the power off and the other two positions seem to provide the same functionality in either position as far as i can tell. perhaps a little blurb in the manual would have been nice to clear things up a bit. the remote takes three aaa batteries. it is fairly small and lightweight even with the batteries installed. it has two thumb controls which could be levers if you insert technic bars or even pins. the two controls are color coded and match the plugs on the receiver to control two separate motors. in addition, there is a four position switch which i assume changes the channel. finally, there are two tiny levers that seem to have no function. i?m not sure if they are a trim control or variable speed control. i messed with them and didn?t notice any difference in the motor speed. again, some documentation from the incredibly verbose lego manual would have helped. as far as the rest of the parts, it?s really a mixed bag. there are a lot of varied parts in this set to the point that there is almost one of everything. lots of technic gears, pins, studded beams, studless beams, axles, wheels, etc. also, lots of little 1x1 slopes in various colors, teeth, horns, etc. you can?t really say it is a parts pack because there is not enough of one thing to make it a parts pack. a couple of notes: it seems the quality control issue on the axles has been fixed. i initially reported this back when i reviewed the 8285 about a year ago. all the axles worked fine for me. the color quality control issue is still alive. check out the different shade of red in these two parts: also included is the sound brick. this looks just like the other sound or light-up bricks we have been seeing lately. it does have a load dinosaur ?roar!? sound embedded in it though so hide the younglings if they are a bit on the skittish side. finally, i?ve never seen one of these before (although someone will no doubt rattle off a dozen sets where you can find this part in about 5 seconds): no, i am not referring to the studded beam, i put that in the photo for scale. the build: the build was fun and was fairly straightforward. as i mentioned, there is a lot of technic parts, so if you are not a fan of the technic line you should run, not walk away from this one. there were no gotchas to speak of, but you need to pay careful attention to the placement of the wires that go from the motors to the receiver. they kind of sneak them around a bit so watch closely. otherwise, it was fine. here is what is left over: so far, i have only built the primary model. as seen on the box, there are instructions for two more models. both of the other models seem less complex than the primary model and are likely quicker builds. the dino took me about 3.5 hours which included some time to screw around with the motors. i?m an old school technic fan from way back in the 80?s so i had some familiarity with the old technic motors. obviously, 25+ years has improved some things and these seem much more powerful. the design: if you have built the 4507 prehistoric creatures then some of the design will feel familiar, especially the head and tail. it is almost like they took the dinosaur from that set and figured out how to motorize it. this is not necessarily a bad thing, just a comment. the set does a good job of showing off the features of the new motors and remote. it is nice to see how one motor can perform multiple functions. in this case, the small motor makes both arms move and opens and closes the mouth of the dinosaur. when the mouth is completely open, it pushes the activation switch on the sound brick which emits the ?roar!? sound. pretty cool. the ?xl motor? handles the walking feature of the dinosaur. there is both forward and reverse. forward works really well while the reverse just makes the dinosaur look like he is doing a michael jackson moon walk. (wow, i never thought i would use michael jackson?s name in a lego dinosaur set review!) it is almost like the dinosaur can?t get traction going in reverse. however, as noted previously forward works really well. this guy actually gets going at a pretty good clip. as you might expect, he kind of waddles like a duck since there is no articulation in the knees. it is a bit awkward but it works. the ?xl motor? seems to kick out plenty of power. overall, the design seems to be a mixed bag. the way the tail is attached seems to be an afterthought. the arms look to be too small. however, the walking mechanism and legs/feet are pretty cool as well as the head and mouth. i guess it is a reasonable effort to get people introduced to the parts and we?ll see designs improve as time goes on. here are a few views of our new friend: but what about the at-at??? of course, the real reason you are reading this is that you hope i will have some epiphany on how all this relates to the new walking at-at. judging from the box on the at-at, it looks like we get one motor. i don?t see the remote which is a disappointment as i hope it is not controlled by a switch on the body and you either turn the at-at on or off. if that is the case, the first thing i am doing is scavenging the receiver and remote from this set to add to the at-at. granted, it could be that it comes with a remote but is just not seen on the box. also, the at-at box looks like one of the images shows that the head turns. i sure hope this is controlled separately as it would be really lame to not be able to control this independently from the walking feature. i?m kind of skeptical on the walking feature of the at-at. i suspect it will be rather cumbersome but hopefully i will be pleasantly surprised. needless to say, this is all speculation but those are my initial thoughts based on this set. overall thoughts: it?s an ok set. kind of pricy but i suspect a large part of that is due to the motors and remote. i haven?t built the other two models (they seem less interesting to me) but at least it has some variability. also, you get a ton of different parts which can either be a good thing or bad thing depending on what you are looking for. the dinosaur is average. the color selection is marginal (black and lime green?) and the tail section is just lame. i appreciate it more for the mechanical functions and how the motorized parts work. it does do a good job of waking up my dog who seems pretty irritated by it. it is a nice set to show off to the neighbors or the endless caravan of my wife?s friends that seem to materialize out of nowhere. people are quickly impressed by it and then promptly move along once you start trying to explain how it all works. i?m a bit disappointed that the manual did not explain more about the remote and motor functions. i suspect that there is more than meets the eye and i?ll just have to play around with it to find out. it would be nice if lego had a website that showed all the cool functions of the motors and remotes so we fully understand the capabilities. final rating: 72% build 9/10 (pretty quick and fun. the mechanical part is cool) functionality 6/10 (it is a creator set so you have multiple builds. as far as it being a dinosaur, it?s just ok. motorized parts are cool though.) design 6/10 (partly cloudy. some things are cool, others are lame.) parts 8/10 (new motors and remote are cool. lots of varied parts included but nothing to write home about.) price 7/10 (it is kind of expensive) edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 06:23 pm. indexed

1 impressive review! really clear photos too! thanks. dr. s.

0 a very nice review, thanks dunamis. *y* i really don?t understand that color scheme, but the new motors?re very interesting. well, that dino is just mediocre to me.... i think that the new technic bulldozer is much more interesting.

1 ickelpete, on jul 13 2007, 11:06 pm, said: great review dunamis i hope you have as much fun with this as i have. one point yes they are new axles they have appeared in a few sets this year. yes, the kids seem to love it (as you pointed out) and the wife still thinks i am crazy so it's all good. i read your review after i posted mine. seems like we shared the same thoughts on a majority of it. i always think it is good to have multiple opinions on sets as it gives the community more data points to evaluate a given set.

1 thanks for the bonus review. i am still on the fence with this one so every opinion is good! dunamis, on jul 14 2007, 07:41 am, said: but what about the at-at??? in case you don't know, the at-at in the dark side development kit had a single motor and a moving head. it worked by the head simply swinging from side to side due to balence shifts. i suspect the at-at will be same. i also think that there will be no remote for it either. edited by sinner, 14 july 2007 - 11:31 am.

1 tks once again dunamis for a great in-depth review ;-) i really look forward to your supped up and moded at-at :-p i am really not found of the design but i think its still a nice parts pack, especially with all these nice "power function" elements ;-) *yoda*

1 thats a nice looking dino set there! great review, dunamis! also, on this side of the border (see that big thing above the us? thats canada, where i'm from) byob still means bring your own beer. my uncle is already on his third molsons. edited by lieutenant colonel thok, 14 july 2007 - 02:21 pm.

-1 oh, is he ugly or what? i've never seen a dino that needed to go on a diet more then him. :-d but i'd get him for the pieces; all those lime-green pieces. *drools* but, meh, i'm not really in to mindstorms, so i don't think i'd get this. but anyway, nice review, i now know exactly what he's like. kml

1 wow...that set is really something. but i prefer pehistoric power, and triceratops. or are they the same? i can never tell.

1 awesome reveiw, thanks! i gotta get this one!!! *y* *wub*

1 i kind of like the design of this, but more importantly i really want to get my hands on the power functions motors and ir control system. i'd prefer the 8275 technic bulldozer, but there's no way i can stretch to the ?100 price tag, so i was thinking i would have to see if i could get a 4958 monster dino cheap in the january sales. then two things happened today. firstly i saw the dino in tescos reduced from ?70 to ?55. then my wife said she'd buy it for me for christmas. wow! that's never happened to me before. i love my wife! *wub* can't wait till christmas now!

0 ickelpete, on nov 4 2007, 06:41 pm, said: if you really want the power functions the bulldozer is better value as you get two large motors, two small motors and two receivers compared to the one in the dino set alos watch toysrus and argos both have had the bulldozer for ?70-75 in there pre christmas sales usually for a week only i am hopeing they will be on sale soon as i want a second bulldozer to get some more motors. thanks for the tip, but even ?70-75 is too much right now. ?55 was just about affordable, but now my wife's buying for me it's going to cost me zero zilch zip nada nothing which is even sweeter! x-d

1 i ended up buying a misb set recently from a lego collector who is clearing up his collection. excellent set to get the ir remote and ir receiver and other motors without paying insane amounts for the bulldozer now. there is a quite a number of parts in power miner lime green and 1x1 white teeth plate for the mouth and claws. the dino alone has 20 teeth in its mouth the glow in the dark "antennas" on the backbone of the dino is a nice touch as you can let him walk in the dark somewhat. i do agree with the reviewer, the box is insanely huge!!! i don't think lego wanted to show a 1:1 scale dino, they just wanted to promote the power function stuff as large as possible. also, the remote is smaller than shown in the picture as the hand holding it i think is smaller.

1 this is both my first set review and post about a star wars set- (even though i have been collecting them since '99). i got this one early this year so i thought i would post a review on it. please bare with me- i am not a great photographer. so with that in mind, here goes! front of the box: 75083 at-dp box-front by whitesidewjw, on flickr back of the box: 75083 at-dp box- back by whitesidewjw, on flickr shot of the bags: 75083 at-dp bags by whitesidewjw, on flickr the sticker sheet (i normally don't apply them, but for this i am going ahead and putting them on): 75083 at-dp sticker sheet by whitesidewjw, on flickr minifigs- i really like the two at-dp pilots, but the best agent kallus really does shine. of course we get an extra stormtrooper: 75083 at-dp minifigs by whitesidewjw, on flickr no new molds in this as far as i can tell, however these printed 4x4 domes are really great. i can see lots of uses for these in space mocs. 75083 at-dp new printed elements by whitesidewjw, on flickr bag#1 complete- nothing earth shattering here- an easy build: 75083 at-dp bag #1 complete by whitesidewjw, on flickr bag #2 complete: 75083 at-dp bag #2 complete cockpit seats by whitesidewjw, on flickr cockpit assembly: 75083 at-dp cockpit assembly by whitesidewjw, on flickr bag #2 complete 75083 at-dp bag#3 complete by whitesidewjw, on flickr "foot" assembly"- i like how they positioned the slopes 75083 at-dp "foot" assembly by whitesidewjw, on flickr complete at-dp 75083 at-dp complete by whitesidewjw, on flickr complete at-dp-side view 75083 at-dp side view (complete) by whitesidewjw, on flickr complete at-dp- over view 75083 at-dp complete- overview by whitesidewjw, on flickr complete at-dp rear view 75083 at-dp rear view by whitesidewjw, on flickr extra pieces 75083 at-dp extra pieces by whitesidewjw, on flickr the verdict: minifigs- 5/5- we get a total of four figs. i like the two at-dp pilots and agent kallus is a well done minifig. i can complain about another storm trooper either parts- 3/5- other than the dome pieces i commented on before, there is really not any new parts in this. if you build space, star wars, or machinery, this will still be a welcome assortment. experience of build 4/5- this really was a fun build. it came together fast but was challenging enough for its target age group. playability 5/5- this thing is much more sturdy than it looks. the legs take a little bit of effort due to the double locking hinges but hold together very well.this is a very minor complaint. value 4/5- typical- $49.99 for 500 pieces- i must admit i paid a little more than msrp due to shipping but i can't complain about the value. overall: 21/25- i really believe this is one of the best walkers that lego has designed. the only changes i would make would be adding real control panels in the cockpit and it would be nice if lego made a real widow to fit in with these types of builds rather than a transparent tile over another plate. all in all, i would recommend this set and i hope the rest of the 2015 star wars sets are on par with this.

1 thanks for the early review! i don't know much about the rebals show at all, but i can say that the over all design of the walker really appeals to me and the minifigs look top notch. i also like how the spring shooters are pretty much hidden in the frame, nice job!

-1 looks really nice. one complaint is the back it is a pitty that lego didn't use any plates greebling there.

1 thanks for the review. cannot wait for the 2015 sets.

1 pretty good first review! this looks pretty great, i probably won't be getting it due to budget constraints. (bionicle) but still, very nice set. to me it kinda looks like the missing link between when the at-st evolved into the at-at. also, i know the rebels stormtroopers get a lot of hate, but i really like them. thanks for the review!

0 thanks for the review! i have two questions: - what is the driver standing on, when the hatch is open and he is looking out? - could you show the face of kallus without helmet, please? my only complaint is that the colours of both, kallus's and the drivers's uniforms are wrong. kallus's uniform is way too dark and should be more dark olive than black, and the drivers's uniforms are too bright and should be more greyish compared to what we saw in the series.

0 smitty500, on 25 december 2014 - 07:21 am, said: awesome! i am really looking forward to buy this, but is it really $50.00 us? i was hoping more around $30.00. i mean, it fits the 10 cents per piece count and has 4 figures so for a licensed theme you can't beat that. but i guess lego can never satisfy everyone

1 whitswj, on 24 december 2014 - 02:53 pm, said: here are the pics of kallus- his head would be good for a steam-punk character. thanks! indeed his face printing is really nice, they captured his looks and spirit well.

0 great set, really impressed. odd that lego didn't include stickers for the controls - can't think of a reason they wouldn't have. and why do only 3 of the 4 figures have leg printing? i just can't understand lego at times

0 i built this set and i think the two rubber pieces holding the both sides of the face is a bit stretched out therefore making the set somewhat tight for entire top hatch to open and close. does anyone have the same situation? is this right? -------------- never mind i got it! i built the back a stud too long! edited by namioik, 29 december 2014 - 03:04 am.

0 the legs are about 2" shorter than the at-at; its cockpit is a little larger than the at-at's "head;" it doesn't look out of place as an escort-type walker or heavy walker, especially as both are built in the same style, although if scale differences really bother you the most recent at-st is probably a better bet for you. edited by hjmediastudios, 29 december 2014 - 04:32 pm.

-1 great reveiw, shame on lego for forgetting that they already made a at-dp pilot helmet (ezra's from the phantom set) that didn't resort to needing a printed head.

0 it's a different helmet. ezra's is an imperial cadet helmet (the same one he wears in "breaking ranks).

0 thanks for the review and pics. this is a really nice looking walker. one question - how snug are the at-dp drivers sitting in their seats? the cockpit looks good. actually i'm not crazy about the at-dp helmets on the show but i dig the minifigs! good stuff. awesome facial hair for kallus!

1 a great review of an obviously fantastic set. a must-have for 2015! thanks!

1 i want more of the story you made! also, ace review.

1 fantastic review, could easily be the year's best, and it's only january 1st! you've got a duplicated picture in the bit where the candy is being moved from the outside and through the barber shop.. ...and i was expecting a final b&w picture or two where the detective makes his report to the woman in red, and gets his reward (candy, of course) or she in turn reports back to her real boyfriend, the candy smuggler. edited by rollermonkey, 01 january 2015 - 04:08 pm.

1 firstly, great review ++++++ i was really on the fence on this one. this review has greatly changed my view on this modular. a definite buy for me. love the interiors and the whole concept. the more i see it the more i see the little features which put this set apart or at least slightly different from the others. of course great playability for the younger lot and i think a nice building to give any lego city more character and colour...

1 great review oky! i really love your introduction text. you put a lot of effort in this review, with lots of nice touches. well done for me the set gets 4 out of 5. it's a great set, but there's something preventing me of giving it 5 stars.

1 wow, that is the best start to a review i have ever seen. great job oky, amazing set, i'll be picking it up this weekend!

0 can you please take some pictures/explain how the water tower is built? i understand that there are some tank treads bot how exactly? and it is "there can be only one"! edited by yooha, 01 january 2015 - 07:14 pm.

1 looking forward to picking up this set on saturday :-) nice review, love the tiny details and the printed parts.

0 nice review, thanks a lot. managed to improve my opinion of the set a bit, but i'm still getting two to build larger buirldings as soon as we get the next 2x vip points special

-1 thelazychicken, on 01 january 2015 - 06:14 pm, said: great review! the intro was great, but i'm still not convinced on this one. the height seems too small for comparison with the rest of the modulars. the play features are ok but i wish it would have been taller. totally agree with you, the height does seem rather small. also 2x buildings on a 32x32 base-plate with a lots of spare studs behind the buildings are these buildings 12 studs in width?. it still looks great style wise, however this might be a set i buy and look at it after i have built it & regret the amount of $$$ i have spent on it. $239 for us aussie's . edited by snaplock, 01 january 2015 - 07:42 pm.

1 this modular building will be my next set! thanks for the review!

0 thank you for the review, it was very interesting and changed my opinion of the set, i'm now considering a future purchase ^^. just one question: the mirror is on cardboard? i was hoping for it to be a window piece with a mirror on one side.. i hope it's not the same cardboard we had on some of the early harry potter sets or the element won't last long

1 thanks for the review! i'm a fan of the set but will be modding quite a bit. have to get a small bar into the highlander and then turn the second/third story above the barber shop into a proper apartment. the detective's office is great and will stay as is!

1 awesome review, and an awesome set. what are the different shades of blue? i know there's dark and medium blue, but what's the other blue? locutis

1 awesome review 'oky'.....thanks for the cool writing and excellent photography........your last photo could of had a cry of......."you'll never take our candy !"......well he does look mel gibson like ! this set is a serious contender for best set for 2015, so much detail .........must buy one, need to brainwash wife into buying me one !

1 lego's affiliation with six wheelers go back a long way. i think the first one was released in 1981, more than 25 years ago. this year, lego added another one to the family, mars mission's "rhino 1", as its title sounds... it's been a while since i've bought and opened a large box, so maybe this isn't a surprise to most of you, but the box does not open at the front, as with many larger sw boxes, but at the side. the two printed seals(or whatever people call them) have gone as well, being replaced by one larger print in the middle of side... the box also isn't as thick as a large sw box, like the sandcrawler... the general size is, however, still quite large. pict0001.jpg 281.91k 102 downloads the back side shows the mars mission theme sets... eccept the rhino! i guess it shows this set will be released as a tru exclusive or something, only to show up in legoland shops and maybe lego shops... it's a shame really, because this is by far the best set of the theme. pict0002.jpg 285.42k 89 downloads when you open the front cover, you see a larger picture picture of the rhino. obviously, it seems to be some sort of multifunctional truck. i think the basic function is to drive around and explore. for that it has a drilling device and six giant wheels. pict0003.jpg 273.7k 82 downloads the set comes with two instruction books. i'm afraid to say they did not resolve the gray/black colors issue. colorwise, the real thing does not look like the instruction book because of it... pict0004.jpg 302.63k 75 downloads the rhino looks really big because of the six giant wheels. i guess it's more or less the same size as m-tron's magnetiser with the big difference between the two being that the wheels have been turned around, creating a unique wheel design for a lego model pict0285.jpg 290.59k 83 downloads pict0277.jpg 286.26k 80 downloads the wheels look very cool, even though the first couple of wheels stand a bit closer to each other. don't know why that is. hm... |-/ and they could have used a bit more body, but the design is pretty good. i know, "armagheddon" isn't far away... |-/ pict0292.jpg 216.75k 70 downloads the suspension of the wheels is a bit flimsy. sure, it allows the truck to move around in a more realistic way than the old sets, but it's not as flexible as some older sets, like sw's ctt. nor do the wheels have much body. the black bars you see on top of the wheels are more "window dressing" then functional... pict0293.jpg 244.78k 88 downloads the over all shape of the rhino is kinda "bulky", it looks more like a beatle than a rhino, if you're asking me. it has three major sections, but i wouldn't call it a modular building though... the cockpit is the first section. it's spacious and detailed. pict0290.jpg 262.77k 0 downloads pict0291.jpg 299.75k 87 downloads the cockpit hangs down from a weird angle. it's attached to a large vertical technic brick that is part of the rhino's main structure, so it's not a seperate spaceship, which is a shame... oh well... you can't have it all, i guess... pict0301.jpg 291.13k 78 downloads ah yes... stickers all over the place, but they're cool. the mid section of the rhino dominates the basic shape of the model. it's as if those two large white parts form a strong and thick shield, protecting whatever is inside from whatever is outsde. pict0007.jpg 213.22k 67 downloads unfortunately, there is nothing inside. it's extra space needed to house the spaceship. that's really a shame; a command center of some kind could have given the rhino a bit more "panache". pict0286.jpg 251.35k 87 downloads however, what's really great, is the way in which they fit together: one side has an orange 1x2 plate that fits in between two white 1x3 plates of the other side, creating yet another unique shape for a lego model. but again, it's a shame they didn't do more with this section... x-o pict0283.jpg 287.75k 82 downloads the third and last section is a platform for a space ship. pict0299.jpg 289.5k 77 downloads pict0287.jpg 199.78k 75 downloads the platform itself isn't really special. no details, no stickers,... it's just a skeleton to carry the spaceship, nothing more nothing less. no, your space ship doesn't fall off, even if you rotate the platform into a launch position, pushing the weight of the ship backwards. in fact, the position of the ship onto the platform is so solid, it's kinda difficult to imagine how this ship flies off. |-/ the ship on the other hand, is pretty cool. it's all sorts of things at the same time it seems. it transports two aliens, but also a small car that reminds me of the small sets of spacepolice 2, blacktron 2,... pict0295.jpg 307.4k 85 downloads pict0298.jpg 268.13k 75 downloads pict0294.jpg 276.84k 76 downloads the shuttle reminds me of a star trek shuttle and i think it needs some modding, but i do think it looks pretty nice. sure, the cockpit is a bit too low, a pilot needs to lay down instead of sitting down and the dropping mechnism, if there is one at all isn't all that brilliant either... the main structure is a bit too technical for me. i prefer actual parts with studs, not these lego technic bars and pins. pict0006.jpg 224.43k 74 downloads the crew: pict0276.jpg 239.43k 70 downloads ah yes, there's also this green plastic residu. think they are supposed to be the aliens... and there's also this weird alien craft, but i didn't bother to build that... *sad* good: *wub* great, innovative design, lots of potential, i even like the colors *sweet* lots of playability it's a big, attractive model; i don't see any weak spots in the design that could compromise stability or structural integrity. not so good: |-/ too many technic parts, some sections on the model, like the gun and the drilling device are a bit to flimsy i'd say 7.5-8.5/10 price: 750 danish crowns, about 105euro

1 thanks dude. this is a great set. can you please take more pictures? thanks

0 seems like they infuse system sets with more technic bars. must be that technic isn't selling too well and they want to educate ppl how cool technic can be. :-p it's quite apparent when even the small bike needed technic frame.

1 wow. this year, my wallet size has been bugging me. *sigh* still, it's a good-looking set and i will get it. too many big sets...

0 this is a great review and so is the set *y* i thought i would buy it, but when i saw the price... i changed my mind x-d i always liked flying things better though... like the dropship... although that is a bit pricey too, i guess x-d

0 this set is truely incredible, a must have. but this set is also incredibly overpriced *n* ! com' on it's only a big vehicle , nothing really special to justify the near 100? price tag. this set is clearly worth something like 65? at max. look at the incredible dropship for 34?, that's a good value for money! *y* edited by mutex, 15 july 2007 - 04:57 pm.

1 awesome review, if i pick up any mm sets, it will definately be this one!

0 i echo the consensus of this thread - too much technic, looks great, too expensive, looks great.

0 kahgarak, on jul 16 2007, 09:53 am, said: please build the alien craft, i'm sure that we would all like a review of that! ^_^' ok then... i'll do that later on... but i will not touch that plastic residu! x-d

0 say, i was looking at your pics and then at the instructions and i just realised : haven't you put the stikers on the shield thingies in the middle upside down? i think you did :-d i don't know if i like those new sets, though... i mean they have great shapes and potential, but at the same time, they seem so holey... they're really huge and big but full of empty air and space as well... well, this one not as much, and indeed it is the best looking set of the lot, though... but i don't think i'll go into that line...

1 snefroe1, on jul 16 2007, 07:19 am, said: ok then... i'll do that later on... but i will not touch that plastic residu! x-d you touched them to put them in their holders in the ship. so in theory, you will not review them. anyways, nice review. i don't think i'll get this though. i'm trying to decide between this, moble devastator, or anothe 90$ set. i need to get something large before my b-day... regards, ~vbbn~

1 8-? such a wonderful machine! great review! too bad all my money is going towards the castle theme! >:-( my wallet is planning to kill me!

1 great review, wonderfully detailed. don't care for the ship at all. it's that 'technic under a hollow shell' thing like the ctt. if it wasn't for the figures, i would have hated it, and nothing about these figures excites me. i'll end up finding the least number of sets possible to provide at least one of each figure for the general population collection and skip the rest (unless they do as i expect and flop here, thus leading to huge discounts). i like this set ... at half off. ;-)

1 the life on mars theme was so much better, with the aliens dominating mars instead of the humans. and the aliens were so much better, with their own names etc. good times. anyway, i think this is the best set in the series. it looks so neat and reminds me of the pelican form halo. x-d edited by iamded, 31 august 2007 - 05:11 am.

1 i think the life on mars series was great. although i didn't click until the line was gone that the red hangar on the alien base was for the red mech, and same with the blue one. man, i was gutted when i realised that, i want those mechs! however, the base was great, with the small mech and the flying crafts. could the lom mechs have been the spark of life for exo-force? 8-? edited by iamded, 31 august 2007 - 05:15 am.

0 lego 41062 elsa's sparkling ice castle lego managed to get a frozen licensed set in the new wave of disney princess sets. however, i'm very surprised by the size. it's a $40 set and comes in a small friends-style box (roughly 12"x12" size) - i almost didn't see it on the shelf when i was looking for it because it's so small. i mean, i know it's only $40 but it's a friggin' castle. and why did lego only make this a smaller set? if they'd made a $200 frozen castle they still would have sold every one they could produce. they made big harry potter hogwarts sets and those sure sold. and have you seen the toys in the frozen section of stores? huge playsets for barbie-sized dolls. but i suppose i'm getting the cart before the horse here, reviewing before i've even opened the box. so..... name: elsa's sparkling ice castle set number: 41062 pieces: 292 price: $39.99 minifigs: 3 theme: disney princess year of release: 2015 links: bricklink peeron brickset the box the front of the box is standard lego fare, other than the large anna and elsa in the bottom right corner. oh, and surprisingly, nowhere on the box is the normal minifig lineup. the only way to know what characters are included is to look at the set pictures. the 1:1 this set uses one of the minidolls as the actual size sample. that's probably not a bad choice since the minidolls are not nearly as well known as a minifig. the back on the back, the play features are shown in insets around a rear view of the castle. like friends sets, you also have an array of play accessories. the seals is this standard on 2015 sets or is this specific to this set? i've never seen 3 tape seals on a set. even huge modulars or technic sets only have 2, so 3 on a set this small seems excessive. perhaps lego expects people to try to steal the dolls? if so, why bother with extra tape? a tiny pocketknife makes quick work of the tape so the third strip doesn't even slow you down. the contents in the box are 2 instruction booklets (bent), a white plate, a sticker sheet, and 3 numbered bags of parts. the stickers these are very hard to photograph since they're shiny. i mean polished chrome shiny. those dark lines across the corners are not really there, they're reflections of my ceiling. the manual backs the back of one booklet has a friends "win!" girl. the other has an ad for the lego disney princess website. that site is so girly there's even sparkles following your mouse cursor around. so i didn't stay too long or look too deeply. the sample page the interior pages of the manuals are on lavender backgrounds. it's standard lego instructions with part callouts and insets when needed. the build, 1 the first thing you build is anna, but i'm not showing that yet. then you build this little picnic scene. it's tiny but effective, and nice to have something not icy in the set since the movie has the "in summer" song for olaf. i'm curious what's in that sandwich though - green and pink? after the picnic is the olaf build, but i'll save him for later too. the build, 2 next is this small sleigh. it has an amazing amount of style for something so small. the curved front and decorative whips on the back make it look sleigh-like instead of blocky. but come on, it already had pink accents, are the pink flowers really necessary? technically, yes, so the whips can mount to them, but still, it's just over-girly for my taste. the build, 3 the sleigh needs a ramp to help it rocket along (for a couple inches, at least). the ramp starts like this, with a hidden lime green jumper plate that gets a cookie on it. i couldn't remember anything in the movie like that, so i asked my wife and she couldn't either. a hidden cookie under a hill? the build, 4 after putting the tilting 2x8 onto the base and adding decorations, this is the result. a lime green bucket holding a pair of ice skates, a flower (in the snow, really?), green and white round studs that i assume are supposed to be grass and snow? the build, 5 the sleigh looks huge sitting on top of the tiny hill, but it actually works pretty well. assuming you're on a smooth surface like a table, you can give the sleigh a little nudge and it'll shoot down the ramp and a few inches across the table. the unevenness of the slopes vs the blue tiles holds the sleigh in line well, and the bumps in the slopes don't seem to hamper anything. the build, 6 moving on to bag 2.... man that's a lot of colors in this base already. and i'm already starting to feel like there's trans-blue cheese thrown around randomly. the build, 7 continuing (and rotating), some steps and even more colors thrown in. magenta? in elsa's ice palace? i sure don't remember any of that... the build, 8 wait, seriously? an ice cream stand in the castle? that is what the magenta is for? i kinda actually like the looks of it, but it doesn't fit the set. the build, 9 spinning back around, now there's a light aqua spiral staircase added along with a roof. this is where i'm really starting to wonder about lego's thinking. those light aqua stairs, and the light aqua 1x4 tiles, are exclusive to this set (as far as i know... it's possible some other 2015 sets use them, but nothing in bricklink yet). seems expensive (to produce) to me, when there's no huge reason to need them. another blue for the tiles would have been fine. and the spiral stairs? really? elsa's castle is known for staircases, but not spiral ones! there should be a huge straight ice stairway out front or sweeping curved stairs inside, but not a spiral. the build, 10 and now we finish the tree. again, why? where is there a tree next to elsa's castle? and so weird... with ice hanging from green branches that have both snow and flowers on them. huh? did lego watch a different movie? the trans-light blue bits before looking at the upper level, a brief pause to look at some other parts. here's the 1x2x5 brick in trans-light blue and the 2x4x6 rock panel in glitter trans-light blue. do those look like the same blue to you? and again, another unique part for this set. why do those rock panels need to be glitter, when lego made the same panel in trans light blue in 2013 and 2014 for superheroes, friends, and chima sets? apparently disney really wanted glitter, because there are a bunch of trans-glitter parts in the new princess sets. there's trans-neon green cones for jasmine; ariel, jasmine, and sleeping beauty all get glitter trans purple cones. so there's a bunch of new glitter parts for 2015. the build, 11 back to building - time to add the upper level. we get a bedroom with a decent bed, although stickered. the build, 12 the other side of the bedroom has some little accessories. perfume and a crown i assume? the build, 13 time for walls and a roof. i like the small white macaroni bricks for a wall, but what's with the lavender fence piece in the center? i'll grant that it looks nice (a common white fence would have been a little boring), but it's another unique piece to this set. the build, 14 the very top of the castle is built separately. not a whole lot to say here other than why is there a torch in an ice castle? the finished castle once the roof is put on, the castle is done. and that big purple star on top says everything to me about the styling. it just doesn't look like modern lego to me; it looks like this should be an old belville fairy tale set from around 1999. if i saw a photo of just the castle with no figs (or picnic blanket), i'd assume that's what it was. the oops, not actually done yet accessories at the end, there's a few bits left to add. there are these dark purple skis (yup, another unique part) in the lower level. let me tell you, they're a pain to get into that location, at least with my big man hands. more accessories the top level gets a stickered book. the sticker has a nice castle image on it that is, while not quite exactly the castle from disney world, very disney-looking. i actually had to google and see if that's the castle they use in their logo. nope, but it's the same style. the leftovers there are a lot of extra parts in this. that's almost 10% of the part count in the set right there! they are pretty useful overall though. it's great to have an extra "carrot" and brown "branch" for olaf, since you know those will get lost as he's played with. the figs finally, the reason for the set. let's face it, the castle set is just an excuse to make these figures. and they're great. i mean just fantastic. the print on them is just such a good match to the real characters. compare to the cartoon version from the front of the box. elsa's hair is a little darker than the cartoon, but overall these are just dead on. if i had to pick out a flaw, it's the "spell" elsa is holding. it's too bad she can only shoot it forward with her arm down like that. it'd be nice to have the end of the splash part bent 90 degrees so she can have her arm forward and the spell shooting forward too. oh, one other thing. the minidoll heads don't press down tight to the body like minifig heads do. there's still exposed neck. it looks nice, but it means elsa's cape can swing around. the fig backs elsa's cape is glittery on the back and you can see the removable bow in her hair. the full set one final issue. when you put anna on the sleigh, her cape doesn't have enough flexibility (since it's a wraparound kind) and so it folds out funny. that's why on the back of the box it shows her standing on the back of the sleigh with elsa in the seat. edit: how on earth did i forget to comment on those orange flowers to each side of the castle? i'm pretty sure elsa did not have any flowers blooming outside her castle! the conclusion hm. i really wanted to like this set, but i just can't quite bring myself to. it feels like lego pulled a random castle design from the files then redid it into white and trans blue to look icy and allow a frozen tie in set. the figs are great, but the castle isn't. i guess the real castle in the movie would be a boring set and this one has play features, but it just is too different for my taste. the ratings value: 7/10 - $40 for less than 300 parts is high (especially when so many of the parts are tiny, but on the other hand there's a lot of rock panels and 1x2x5 trans blue panels), but the figs help save it. design: 4/10 - not one of lego's best. not as bad as the lows in the 90s, but not a great set. minifigs: 10/10 - possibly even a 12/10. they are the reason to buy the set . playability: 8/10 - there are a bunch of play features, but they actually detract from the design, so i had to knock off a couple points. parts: 7/10 - a bunch of impractical unique parts (how often do you need dark purple skis or a lavender fence piece?) but also a bunch of nice parts if you wanted to make your own icy scene. overall: 7/10 - a great bunch of figs, but i'd recommend not bothering with the manuals. just use the parts to build your own castle that's better.

1 two of my daughters are building this as we speak. i agree the design is a lot smaller than i would have liked, but they're loving it. no question the figures are the real draw here. and at 6 and almost five years old they're doimg a good job building so far. at least for the 4-6 range in my house, this set is a home run. thanks for the great review, mostlytechnic!

1 very nice review, mostlytechinc! once i saw this set i was interested in it for the colours and pieces...thanks for this review to shed more light onto it!

-1 isn't getting parts in new colors a good thing? it is a shame there is only this one set, i think tlg could make a whole subtheme out of frozen. i do agree that they overuse lavender and magenta, i don't see why every girl set has to have these sort of colors instead of what would be accurate to the source material .

1 thanks for the review mostlytechnic. i too wish they had done a real castle for this set, it certainly deserved it. my sons and i figure they could have used the old rock monster mold from rock raiders in white for the missing snow beast. i will pick it up though for the figs and unique pieces.

-1 thanks for the review! i have the same opinion about the design, looks like belville. i bought it on legostore orlando december 30th. it was impressive. my wife saw them putting on shelf, 8 or 10 boxes. she ran and grabbed the last one! the girls faces around it was indescribable, mix of ecstasy and afraid to loose it. it happened in less than 2 minutes. my 7 yo girl didn't want it. she likes the dresses but hates the movie. prefers lego movie. but my 2 yo girl who never saw the movie grabbed it for good, and we bought it. lego will sell it like water, but i do not understand why a set so small. it is the worst set design since the introduction of lego friends. my 7 yo has more than 50 lego friends minifigures, all the lego fiends stores and concluded that the castle had a terrible design. she is 7!! let's be honest, lego should have released this sets months before this christmas and is loosing a perfect opportunity to sell a decent set, with much more pieces. i am wondering if they are going to make another set with the same characters. at the end,. it is just for the minifigures.

-1 yep, my family all thinks they should have made a bigger set, added figs, and just been printing money. this feels massively rushed into production. which is weird, the other princess sets that just came out look worlds better.

1 i wish elsa had more of a white hairpiece rather than blonde. but it could be worse. not a bad set overall, although olaf doesn't look right without the twigs on his head. anna is a really nice and accurate fig.

1 i think the trans-glitter blue panels can be icy or snowy just fine. i'm sure that's why they used them for this set. now, if you're looking for realism (like the photos in your sig seem to be), it might be tougher. but i've been thinking about using those big glittery panels to make a waterfall-type scene.

1 i'm literally of the exact opposite opinion to op here. i love the structure and the parts (this is a fantastic little parts pack that i'll be snagging more of when i find it again)...but i've no use for the figures (not a big disney princess fan). it's all about the parts. this set is freaking amazing! :d

1 well, the good news for you is you're in luck whenever you find sets, since the figs sell for a good bit of money :) right now the bricklink value of the 3 figs is about $30!

1 very nice review indeed and i also can't wait for the release of this set. it will be a superb wonderful addition to the lego disney princess theme.

0 i'm pretty sure i've gotten other sets recently with three pieces of tape on them.

0 i see the cookie smugglers from the detective's office have already infiltrated other lego themes.......

1 thanks for the review. this will end up being a must buy for my daughter.

-1 bennemans, on 13 january 2015 - 06:08 pm, said: there is a very simple reason for the flowers and green-leaved trees; you should remember from the movie it was actually summer when elsa set of the eternal winter true, but all around her ice castle it is all winter. so why are there non-winter bits in this set? doesn't make sense. the picnic is because they wanted a mini-vignette for olaf to fit into, but the rest of the green and flowers don't make sense. tenorikuma, on 13 january 2015 - 09:58 am, said: i'm pretty sure i've gotten other sets recently with three pieces of tape on them. cool, good to know. was wondering but haven't remembered to look when i'm at a store recently. whitefang, on 13 january 2015 - 09:12 am, said: very nice review indeed and i also can't wait for the release of this set. it will be a superb wonderful addition to the lego disney princess theme. thanks for the fp, but "a lovely sweet review?" i thought i bashed this set pretty hard

1 this seems to be one of those sets that lego really should have released a month before christmas, it likely then would have been toy of the year 2014,

0 i'm trusting there is something else going on behind the scenes because this should have been a huge set and released in november of 2014 at the latest. maybe we will see more and better frozen sets when the post-christmas consumer spending wave hits. edited by m0dulo, 13 january 2015 - 10:03 pm.

-1 hello everyone, i am back to share with all of you, another of my legends of chima polybags review. it will be pretty comprehensive since the finished built will be quick and will be focusing more of what kind of fun that you can derive from there. this polybag was bought in september 2013, when i visited legoland malaysia and i did not hesitate to put this in my shopping basket. name: 30253 leonidas jungle dragster theme: lego system / legends of chima year: 2013 pieces: 30 minifigs: 1 minifigure price: usd n.a, gbp n.a, euro n.a, sgd n.a resources: brickset, bricklink an original polybag image of the 30253 leonidas jungle dragster back view of the original polybag image of the 30253 leonidas jungle dragster the road scout of the lions tribe this polybag design is definitely plan to be the quickest and fastest dragster to recce enemy front by making a swift scout for the lions tribe. i believe by the sound of the name, jungle dragster, it might just be suitable to use in jungle terrain. well, i don't quite agree that this is a 'dragster' even though it has the kind of open view concept of rolling in fast but it does not have the length of a typical dragster, similar to this town polybag design, for example. still, it is nice to have smaller variants of their vehicular supremacy. instruction manual (front) instruction manual (back) the lego building content with just 30 lego elements, you can be pretty quick to be able to display these laid out content. after the built is completed, these are the remaining spare parts. i am fond of the wheels which are some useful parts, other than that, there are nothing spectacular about it. my name is leonidas and i belonged to the lions tribe do not be mistaken of his name, leonidas to be the king of sparta who led the brave men of 300 spartans warriors to fight to the death against the persians. instead this character is based on the bio resided in lego.com, you will realise that he is aligned with the lions tribe and is a proud lion foot-soldier. he may have that goofy idiotic look but he can be very serious in his commitment to discharging his duties. you are able to observe his nice back view printing which reveal his black and blue sash. leonidas has a dual facial feature to reveal his much serious appearance. leonidas is one of the common characters available in the legends of chima universe. it can be found in a total of five sets. it is a great pity that there is no weapon being made for him in this polybag design which will certainly make a fine addition. the completed built of the jungle dragster this is the main design of the jungle dragster which is very simple looking. there is no distinct fighting capability from the vehicular design and it look just like a regular patrol vehicle. one thing i like about this, is the close distinct colour schema of the lions tribe. other than that, there is nothing special about it. moving off with my jungle dragster to conclude, this polybag is really meant for lego fans or collectors who appreciate legends of chima or wanting to sample the legends of chima theme. it is a very simple built, but yet could form a decent force size for recce purposes before sending in the big arsenals to whack their enemies. either way, i will only suggest you to buy it if you really love this theme at an inexpensive price. otherwise, it is perfectly alright to give this a miss. summary review playability: 4/10 (you need to have more lions tribe vehicles in order to bring the best and fun out of it since this is more of a supporting vehicle.) design: 4/10 (simplistic built of the dragster and main focus is just acquiring the minifigure.) price: 4/10 (bought at about usd$7, which is not an awesome price, so get it if you can get it more than half of this price.) overall: 4/10 (if only you are a huge mega fan of the legends of chima, then you need to get this.) i gave it a "2" based on my review score card. what about yours? i hope every one of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and criticisms are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my flickr.

-1 good and helpful review again, whitefang. i probably have no use for a lionish creature with goofy looks...

1 thanks for this review, i love this set *wub* that batman is great, and i've always loved that awesome scarecrow fig. that new pumpkin is fantastic, i can't wait to get it in the set...how many come with the set? i hope more than two :'-( i love both of those vehicles, this set is a definite buy for me!

1 that was a great review with loads of excellent pictures. the set is better than i thought. i want to buy one of the new sets as i would love a blue batman, but they are so expensive for australians. i love the new pumpkin heads. the story involved more mini-fig cruelty; excellent! i also liked the scarecrow/crow joke. :-d (one request; please don't say lines like "to the batcopter" next time. that is the old tv series and i hated that. >:-) feel free to tell me to stick my request up my m#g@bl*cks.)

1 when i first saw pic's of the bi-plane i wasn't sure if i liked it or not, but after seeing it in more detail i gotta say i love the thing *wub* it's a great plane with so many good aspect's, it's also the perfect counter vehicle for the new bat-plane. for me though the best part of the set has got to be the new pumpkin heads, those are just beautiful and i cant wait to get lots of them.

0 nice review. the batcopter is pretty neat, but i prefer scarecrow's bi-plane. quote batsy: we needed to wrap this review up so i used my baterang. bianca: is that really what it's called? batsy: beats me... nooo... it's batarang.

1 tks mate for this brilliant review :-d i loved your batfabuland story !! always fantastic to read like always *sweet* i really love this set and i shall buy 2 copies: one to build as is, and another one for my town loool: regular biplane for the tarmac, and my swat copter ;-) btw, i would have a request: could you post pic(s) of the parts inventory please ;-) many tks in advance !! *yoda*

-1 christian, on jul 18 2007, 08:21 pm, said: i would love to have this set but the price is just to high here, far worse than i had expected. i'll be better off buying the battank, which is much better priced. actually there is almost no price difference between the batcopter and the battank here *wacko* that is insane! *wacko* 450 and 500! indeed; you should just buy the tank. comparing the price of the tank to the batwing you seem to be getting quite a good deal there. both are over priced for australians and the tank is twice the price of the copter. (they are 60 aud and 120 aud.) i am still not sure if i will buy either... :'-( edited by sinner, 18 july 2007 - 11:47 am.

1 thanks for the review. i'm definitely getting this, mainly becasue it's batman. i love the blue bats, the scarecrow is good as ever, and those new pumpkins are just *wub* . there's a few things i'll mod, but nothing really major. i'll have to wait till i get this to decide properly though.

0 what a fine review and what a funny story, thanks! *y* dark tan and new technic hub.... very interesting. scare the crow on! :-d

1 excellent hinckley *y* *y* *y* ! looks like a nice set - i like the mix of dark batman-pieces and a bit lighter badmans-pieces. batmans new blue headpiece looks a bit off though. i love your stories *wub* - especially now-a-days when i?m a afofl x-d! keep up the work mister! dark tan on copmike

1 7665 review part 2 the second half of the build goes quicker than the first. once you start to add the engines, the ship really begins to take shape. the main body of the ship has a few surprises hidden away under a removable cover. inside you get some retracting guns, a storage box, a little shuttle and space for a droid and figure. here is everything you can fit inside. the guns are concealed behind the side vents. pushing them forward causes the vents to open. closed: and open: the final feature is the passenger area/escape pod. inside is plenty of space for two figures. the pod cleverly attaches by pushing the front section of the ship forward, sliding the pod in, then returning the front. everything locks together and is held securely in place by an elastic band. :-) here's a couple of pictures of the final model. it's not the most beautiful creation ever, but it is an excellent representation of the ship from the film. the angular shape actually suits a lego build well. there's one more useful feature. the whole ship can be safely and comfortably picked up by two ball ended technic pins towards the back end. it balances well at this point and does allow you to swoosh the ship around much more easily. this was the most enjoyable star wars build i've had in a long time. everything progresses nicely with almost no repetitive bits. the ship looks good and is also huge! *sweet* compare it to the 6211 isd and you'll see it's only fractionally smaller. when i first saw pictures of this on the internet i thought it looked ok. once you see it for real it is much more impressive. for ?69.99 in the uk i'm not complaining. it's the best value star wars set of the year so far. to conclude: pieces: 9/10 minifigures: 7/10 (would be a 9 apart from the stupid qui-gon/obi-wan head error) playability: 8/10 originality: 9/10 set design: 8/10 overall: 8.2/10 the box says this is a limited edition set (whatever that means). so if you're planning to get it i'd suggest you grab it at the first opportunity. i'm glad i did! x-d edited by kernow, 22 july 2007 - 10:56 pm.

1 thanks for the review! i'm glad to see lego including details of everyday life, like the food (though a plate would have been nice). steve

0 brick miner, on jul 31 2007, 07:46 pm, said: as for the set, the thing that jumps out at me most is the use of dark blue for water... im so used to seeing the classic blue for water, that the dark blue seems weird. i don't like it. - bm indeed, i only noticed this when i saw the s@h images. i guees that they're on dark waters. you can always put some trans blue and trans clear 1x1 round plates, no? i tried that technique to make the lava (using trans red and trans orange plates), it looks neat. regarding the human soldier thing yoda mentioned, it's quite weird. like him, i'm going to swap the legs, so they're coherent with the soldiers from the other sets. third note: is it just me or did you attach the two black gate pieces too high? shakar

1 nice review, i like the building/port the most mmm,dark blue plates *wub* pity it is a toys'r'us exclusive, in the netherlands there are only toys'r'usses in the greater cities.

0 shakar, on aug 1 2007, 01:34 pm, said: third note: is it just me or did you attach the two black gate pieces too high? shakar no, i think this is correct. the upper plate with clip for the door is a little high, on top of a dark gray 1x1 brick. so if you want the door to operate well you have to place it like that. i just put the clip under that brick, a very easy fix, so my door now is lower which looks better imho, and no sneaky skelly can crawl along under it.... x-d

1 not sure i like this one much. i like many of the new parts but the boat isn't that great and i would rather get each seperately so i can avoid the whole skeleton army. nice review though!

1 asuka, on aug 1 2007, 01:47 pm, said: no, i think this is correct. the upper plate with clip for the door is a little high, on top of a dark gray 1x1 brick. so if you want the door to operate well you have to place it like that. i just put the clip under that brick, a very easy fix, so my door now is lower which looks better imho, and no sneaky skelly can crawl along under it.... x-d exactly. asuka is correct. also keep in mind that the picture was taken looking down on the model that is sitting on the carpet. it makes the gap appear a little larger. in addition; for those of you that recommended ironing the sail, it worked great. i set the iron to low and used a t-shirt to protect the sail. it flattened it out perfectly. in fact, it worked so well, that i did the same with my old ww weapons wagon cover that has gotten wrinkled over the years. the iron worked perfectly.

1 yes, very nice review mr brickster! i think i , for a change, like the castle part better. the ship doesn't look quite right to me. if they're gonna make a pirate theme with ships like this i wouldn't be very happy... but i think the ship brings some nice accesories. like the anchor, a black mid piece(!), steering wheel etc. i think i'll buy it eventually. wout, on aug 1 2007, 08:19 pm, said: nice review, i like the building/port the most mmm,dark blue plates *wub* pity it is a toys'r'us exclusive, in the netherlands there are only toys'r'usses in the greater cities. ah, that's good to know, now i won't be searching in other toystores as well! thanks! mr tiber

1 thanks for the review brickster! it's great to be able to see more views of this set.

1 ok here is the set alot of us star wars fans have been waiting for! the 7666 hoth rebel base! *wub* first the box now the great minifigs! that stunning k-3po fig! now the snowspeeder! aaaaggghhhhh these parts are all stickers! now for the turret! the 2 cones on the side press in to fire out 2 blue lights saber blades :-d now for the small crane thingy. yes the part under the engine on the snowspeeder is another sticker 8-| echo base!! (well the front door anyway :-d ) the main control room? :-d again these are stickers on a tinted clear panel and on the slope |-/ i have no idea what this is meant to be! :-d finally 2 shots of the full set! *wub* well over all i really like this set and think it is great value for money. the minifigs alone would set you back more than the cost of this set. the build time was a good 2 hours or so and was good fun! the snowspeeder is not as good as the second snowspeeder and no where near as good as the first in my opinion, but i did love that first one. the k-3po fig is perfect and it is good to be getting more droids that aren't r2-d2 and c-3po. it is a shame about the stickers but that is the price of keeping the cost down i suppose (the only printed part in the whole set is the snowspeeder/x-wing windscreen). i will definately be getting atleast another 3 of this great set. 9/10

1 i love it.... depending on the australian price! (if it comes down here that is.) incidently, i have no idea what that other yellow thing is either! thanks for the review.

1 don't worry guys, the snowspeeder fits through the door easily :-)

0 mutley , did you bought it @ tru? - are there any other sets? exept of hoth base , and is there the republic cruiser?

-1 i thought after the king's royal castle uproar about stickers, lego would have gone back to printed bricks. obviously, it is all about costs these days and not about keeping people happy.

1 wow!! why didnt you bought 3 of them :-d?

1 wow, i didn't think we'd get a review so fast 8-? really nice review, the pictures explain it all *y* :-) i really hope to get this set as it is really great... i guess :-d

1 the snowspeeder is love.

1 great looking set ... how much was it ?

0 ?40 i think.

1 sam89, on aug 2 2007, 04:53 pm, said: ?40 i think. yep! very reasonable *y*

1 mutley777, on aug 2 2007, 05:00 pm, said: yep! very reasonable *y* not too bad ... might have to pick that up soon then, i will be in tru in southampton over the weekend ;) i think i'll buy the bigger sets here and get the smaller ones in the usa later in the year. the smaller the boxes, the more chance i will have getting them in my suitcase ;) i have to say, i am very glad we are now not getting a 1:1 ratio between the numbers used prices in usa vs uk (e.g. it is not longer ?49.99 = $49.99) :)

1 excellent set. the snowtroopers are just amazing (most lego imperial troops are really good). however, it's sad that except from luke, all the rebels have the same face which is what is more the most unexpressive that you can find. for the rest, the quality looks excellent. the snowspeeder is far better than the first they realized (but only one thing: it looks a bit too white to me. i think i remember they were grey and orange rather than white in the film) and the echo base door is really cool. really nice set. edited by lord beckett, 02 august 2007 - 04:14 pm.

1 nice review mutley *y*! i agree with all your observations, especially stickers versus printed parts |-/! i get some of this and replace the snowspeeders with my v.2?s. hoth on copmike

1 great review - now i want it even more! ?40??? that sounds reasonable in comparison to our recent experiences!

1 outstanding review jim, congrats ! love the pictures, so clean and crisp . hope to see many more of your reviews. as for the set, after seeing this review i kind of like it, if i will find it at a decent price, i will get it for sure.

1 great review,i am still undecided whether to get this set or not.

1 really thorough review, jim. i am super jealous that you have 2 of these and i have none, with no opportunity to get one any time soon.

1 fantastic review jim, from the quality of the review alone it is easy to see how much hard work you have put into it. i'm with you on the instruction manual, i much prefer one quality bound book over umpteen stapled booklets. already have 2 of these sitting in the build queue, one for display model as i'm a fan of this one and one to build the b model then dissemble for parts, so i'm already sold on his set but still very much enjoyed taking the time it deserves to read through the review and ogle at your pro photography.

1 great review with fantastic pictures. as for the model, i'm glad that they chose to make it less pretty - real le mans prototypes are rarely a sight to behold. it is function and aerodynamics over form. i would, however, have preferred more realism for the sake of learning: - the front shouldn't open like that - instead it should be easy to remove the whole front cover, leaving the suspension easy to work on. - the aero seems to be realistic, except for the rear end where there's no indication of a venturi channel. this should have been easy to include. - there is no fuel tank, nor fixed fuel connector right behind the cabin. - there are no air jacks! seriously!? this is one of the most unique features of a race car like this... and lego forgot about them. instead they automated two functions which are manual on a real race car. - the top cars at le mans are hybrids with ingenious systems. i would have loved to see the front wheels connected to some kind of spinning apparatus indicating a kinetic energy recovery system. if i get this set... i'm going to make some modifications.

1 i was very skeptical of this set because i really thought the redesign degraded the looks of the a-model a lot, but after building it i must say this is an excellent set. good job tlg!

1 i'm still not a huge fan of the model, but this is one awesome review. the effort and quality can be clearly seen and i hope you continue making reviews like this

1 great review. i think it look like a great set, both a and b. however the panels are the only thing i would need, but still a great looking set.

1 a great review jim. just finished building this set. a couple of steps required abit of lego stressing to get together when there was an easier way. just made it into rc ( almost finished it in ldd) which was easy to do as it has so much room for nearly any configuration of motors and not have them showing. a great set. edited by jono.rocky, 13 march 2015 - 10:53 am.

0 wonderful review, but i am still not sold on the set. if we get more sets with the bright green i might be tempted to get it, but until then it is too few parts in bright green (too few different types, not the number of pieces) to be able to use that colour effectively in making moc's.

1 true, but i must say i like the new colour, very 'fresh' looking compared to the rather dullish regular green. can't wait to build mocs with it.

1 thank you vey much for this review. i do have some questions; 1. what are the white clutches geared into? 2. is the engine geared to one or both drive motors? 3. how well does it go on carpet? 4. can it doze without breaking the blade?

1 excellent review, thanks! what is the cost in us? not released in my area. the shovel is obviously my favorite area, it looks detailed and strong. i love the treads, because i need them to move the 4 x 4 barrels on my super-scaled turbolaser turret. very good pics too. what color are the treads? i never had them. they are plastic or rubber? edited by grand moff viceroy, 03 august 2007 - 12:34 am.

0 ah man...i wanted to review it with mine. oh well. here in the u.s. it cost $150 and has 1355 pieces total. the pins and axles did seem a bit difficult in putting them into place. a problem i have been having is the batterys are done after about 4 hours of play, which i really wish they would last longer :-( . overall it is a stupendous set and it is really nice to see our old friend the studs make a return!

0 thanks for the review, it really looks cool. too bad it's soo expensive. :-/ i must admit that i prefer the 8421 mobile crane for more or less the same price, the design is more "sexy". *wub*

1 thanks for the great review of this set. i've been looking forward to it as well and i am excited about the wireless controls like the dino. i too am curious if this set has been released here in the us. i was told that it was a sept 1 release. i agree about the battery life. my dino set lasted about 4 hours too.

1 thanks for the review! this looks like a great set, and with four motors, two receivers and a remote control i wouldn't say it is overpriced. it is still a lot of money though..... if my scholarship permits it i will seriously consider buying this set.

1 thank you very much for that neat review, ickelpete! *y* your pictures?re very interesting and your video?s really good. that set looks very beautiful to me, a formidable new technic set that quickly?ll turn into an everlasting classic for sure. :'-) i?m just a little sorry for those quality problems.... well, i hope that tlc?ll work on that matter and fix it soon. 8-|

1 hi, many thanks for this review, photos and videos. i can't wait to put the hands on mine, since it is already ordered and should arrive before the end of the month. :'-) could you post a scan or photos, from those last pages in the building instructions where the parts included are listed? thanks edited by conchas, 04 august 2007 - 07:19 pm.

0 could you please please post the instruction boolets' number codes (located on the back in tiny print)? so that we can download them from lego.com and have a look for ourselves. i think a personalised flag would be a good finishing touch to this set! thanks.

1 the new small technic sets have incredible functionality for their size, and this one is no exception. with only 106 parts this crane can roll, extend, rotate, lift (and hold in any position) and has working stabilisers! the boom extends the same as the other sets with this boom; simply pull it. it works surprisingly well and due to circular ridges inside the boom the extension (which is just a standard beam) will hold in place. the gear at the back controls the height of the boom. as you can see the boom is only half extended. boom fully extended, half down. the cable is kept in place via two gears and a blue pin, same as the 7905 crane. even under decent weights this works well. the stabilisers however cannot handle much weight once the load is moved off axis. the stablilsers are a very simple but effective design. another shot of the stablilsers. this also shows how far the boom will decend. the boom height mechanism works well also. i love the cab design. overall this is a remarkable achievement for the low price. i bought it for the boom piece as i want to improve the crane that came with 7998 7898 ( :-$ ). i highly recommend it.

-1 very nice review sinner! *y* *wub* so we are getting more and more reviews with figs in it, that?s great! :'-) i actually wanted to skip this technic set, but your review made me think again. i haven?t seen you posting a price, so i will do that for you :-p : it?s (just) 9,99? in germany.

1 a very nice review of a very good little set, thanks sinner! *y*

1 excellent set, excellent review. a good job as always, sinner.

1 alright, so i usually do quick photo reviews when i get new sets. that's what i'll do here, but there's quite a few photos, so i thought i might as well make its own review thread. so, i got the kwik-e-mart by paying just2much on an early ebay copy. i think it's worth it, as this week i'm gonna be super busy, so i was able to build it saturday and stuff. here's my video review, i think it's one of my best: well, let's get onto this photo review. the set is $200 usd with a little over 2100 pieces. the official release is april 15th for vip members, may 1st for everyone else at lego stores. and, if you want full size pictures, check out my flickr by clicking here. the minifigures included are great. you get three exclusive minifigures (one being a completely exclusive character- the first time lego has ever put an exclusive mould in a direct to consumer set), and you get three of the series most popular characters in their normal attire for those who missed out on the first simpsons minifigures series. the kwik-e-mart's exterior is loaded with lots of sticker details. the only printed detail you'll see in the exterior is the dial pad in the phone booth, which has appeared in some other licensed themes since last year. ( ^^^ right here is there the store can be opened- a simple technic pin and receiver keeps it in place and allows for opening and closing) the roof of the store includes the garden shown in the paul mccartney episode. the roof can be slided out/in once you open it with the hinge part. here's a look at the store with the roof removed. the floors are a nice sand blue color, coming with 8x16 thin plates: and, for the interior, from the view of the store opened with the hinges at the back that i mentioned earlier: the left front corner, which includes some arcade machines of bonestorm and great white hunter, an amazingly done buzz cola soda machine, juice machine, the checkout counter, ect: the right front corner, with food aisles, freezers, and a frozen jasper sticker: the back left corner, which includes some nice coffee kettle builds, the donut tray, hotdogs, ect: the right back corner, which has a door leading to a very small hallway that only has a mouse and cheese in it. the hallway leads to the employees only door in the back, and it's very hard to get in the door way (not that there's anything to do inside there): also included is clancy's copcar, which fits three figures: here's a look at the piece list in the instructions, click on each to be lead to an enlarged version of the pic: also included are some awesome printed pieces, and two unprinted coffee cups! honestly, i think this set is perfect. the price is fantastic, and has a great ppp ratio. they really went above and beyond by including snake in this set. i honestly think it's better than the simpsons house in terms of accuracy and the value here- so many cool pieces printed and in exclusive colors. so, that's my quick picture review. hope you guys enjoyed, and i'd love to hear your thoughts!

-1 thanks for all the feedback you guys! robert8, on 12 april 2015 - 11:25 pm, said: i can't help but think the minifigures are the weak part of the set. snake and apu are great but the rest.... i don't know. they kinda redundant now. they could at least give us new torso printing, like homer wearing his jacket or bart wearing his blue t-shirt or marge wearing her coat. or, as i said in the discussion thread, i'd have included jasper in cmf series 2 and a frozen version here. overall, the set looks kinda smaller than what i thought. i agree, but so many people were complaining about how the simpsons house should have included the most common versions (mostly because the eyes or whatever), so i think lego played it safe and just included the normal versions. it makes sense, since series 1 is gone forever, and the common versions were in there, and this set is bound to be in stock for a very long time like the death star. i never really agreed when people were complaining about the alternate eye prints personally, but i guess this is a good business choice based on previous feedback. edited by just2good, 13 april 2015 - 12:06 am.

1 hello everyone. excellent review! english is not my native language, but i want to express my opinion. simpsons house was the first of its kind, and i can say without exaggeration that this is the most impressive set that i'm going (my collection http://brickset.com/sets/ownedby-celeb ). i look at the video from the kwik-e-mart, and is difficult to say how good it is compared with the house. the main disadvantages that i said to myself, is this: build the walls of the large panels, next is access to the roof (gray parts in front of the back door (i think they represent the stairs)) is not on the level with doors on the roof and when you open them, you can see the white block is openly trash, my points of view. boxes on the left of go to the store and powersauce box, i want see make real and not just a cube, f.e. such as in the unreleased star wars set. about minifigures, i fully agree with robert8. two more of the same homer, marge and bart?! personally, i put my set as a scene and all the replays minifigure are inside the house that was not identical characters next and also absolutely terrible bart`s accessory this set is made parking for bikes and it looks very cool. but damn, it is hoped to see the bart or lisa's bike, instead of useless balloons with paint. the walls are made with convex inside panels, why so? can anyone know? have not seen any pictures with such walls in tv show. why did not they turn? i personally really like how realized roof, but my brother says that it is terrible :) garden could do more in the series there were almost jungle i do not know how to be considered here, maybe anyone can express any opinion or idea? i look at the simpsons house, and then look at the photo of this e-mart. i can not understand, in the house we have a garage, two floors, cool floor, a lot of furniture, all the rooms and walls, collected from cubes, many additional accessories. and where is all this detail here? it looks much smaller (maybe even poorer). if they still will release next year comic book store, it will be even less? of course it is difficult to estimate without seeing it live, we have it will be sold only in may. at first sight it does not look so impressive as the house. can certainly the case in the limit on the amount of detail, but why it was impossible to add $ 50 to the cost and make jasper, the more detailed the roof, the walls of the smaller elements, that it was not convex. sad. thanks all for attention. edited by celeb, 13 april 2015 - 05:10 am.

1 can you post a pic of it next to the simpsons house? just curious about size comparisons...

1 great review!! thanks for paying a little extra to get it now and review it for us!!! you must be a youngin'...those phone booths thingys are called "pay phones" :) j/j they're tough to find nowadays.

-1 i have sooo mixed feeling about that... i loved the simpsons house (save for the terrible wall in the homer and marge's room), but this so far is inferior in almost every aspect. the walls made of panels is a bummer. i expect a d2c set to be better that this. 60+ stickers? the same thing. same price for less bricks and smaller build then the house. strange coloured bricks on the outside wall (some ugly mix of yellow + tan) panels again with their fronts facing towards the inside of the shop so we and up with those squares all around. the walls are yellow, this was so nice, lost opportunity to make it in some other less common colour. then again the set overall looks is good. the roof is a nice detail. the shop looks actually like a real one, not just an approximation of one. the roof tiles are in dark orange - we got new/rare colour here the car looks interesting to build (just like the pink one from the house) lots of nice references to the show it's the simpsons! definitely a must buy... but for a discounted price. i'll try to find one with maybe damaged box or after-display copy. edited by mestari, 14 april 2015 - 01:15 pm.

1 looks great. how does it compare to the house

-1 that's actually not bad sizing, imo. sure, it looks like you get a lot more with the house, but the kwik-e-mart has a lot more of those little references that make it simpsons. i agree with some of the complaining; a real jasper behind a trans-blue panel would have been cool. you could always bulk up the roof with more foliage... i think it has a great foundation as a set, but could do with a few mods to make it better. thanks for the pictures; i greatly appreciate being able to see reviews like this before dropping $200 on a lego set.

1 great review just2good, honestly i love this set lots of great details and references.

-1 i recently acquired 90% of this set, so i thought i would do a review of it. please note that half of the mini-figs are wrong, and there are some part substitutions. this is the only set that comes with this plate. there is a depression under the grey plates to the back. the pool depression can be easily covered by three quarter circle plates... which just happen to be included in this set. (good set design lego!) the stairs are old fabuland ones, and have been used in a few other sets. this is the only one that has them in "parapink" however. what is the difference between "parapink" and "pink"? dunno... the big windows are in only two other sets, both of them dacta ones! the smaller ones were in one other paradisa set. the interior, while simple, works very well. i love the coffee machine. a cute car came with the set as well. the bird house is a nice idea as well. once the current visitors leave i will probably be breaking this set. i wish lego would go back to these sets as they always had some great parts in them.

1 nice review of a surprisingly interesting set. *y* those windows are great, and no doubt difficult to get. classic coffee maker, simple yet exactly right. that baseplate was in a few other sets, but never with that pattern. would have made a great base for some of the classic 80s houses lego used to treat us to. in tan was part of the adventurers egypt sets. as recently as 2001 it was a base for ogel. versatile plate that hopefully hasn't disappeared completely. parapink is apparently "light pink" on brickshelf, so i guess it's just lighter than normal pink (and stopped appearing in 1995. just so you know, that monkey is drinking too much and likely to fall in the pool ... ;-)

1 i got that set recently as well. bought a bulk lot and there was all but 1 minifig in there. gave it to my girlfriend for her town. need to find her a ristorante now.

1 nice review sinner! *y* my favorite part of this set is the parrot in the front window! *wub*

1 awesome set! i really like the robots, and that tiny tank could be quite useful! all the fancy machinery in there really make it more like a lab than a restaurant! :-d the thing i found most funny was the positioning of the middle finger on the hand. :-d :-d definitely gave me quite a laugh. x-d

1 due to a larger bl order in the u.s. i couldn?t resist to add two hopper waggons to my train layout. here?s a review of this fantastic set. the box. well, there?s nothing really special about it. the open box with three polybags. note, that there are only three different colors used in that set (actually there are 4, but you can?t see the dark grey ones). great color composition by the way. *wub* and - no stickers !!! - :-d oooops - i opened the bags too fast. help me, i?m drowning! *sing* not following the instructions, i built the wheels first to get the larger pieces out of the way. keep on rolling. this is the load of the hopper waggon. 11 round bricks altogether. when i opened the set, i was curious if it was a new colored set or an old one. luckily enough it was an old one, with old dark grey. i don?t know if tlc ever produced this set with bley. from the following pic you can clearly see, that the set is an old one. look at these slope bricks. see what i mean? all bricks are looking exactly the same! buy a set today means get at least three different textures on the slopes and maybe even more shades of tan. :-x >:-( i have said that in many other threads here and i?m saying it again: back to the roots, lego! you were able to produce good quality. show us you can still do it! *sad* but now to the building. it?s a 6 x 24 train base plate you?re building on. did i say i liked the colors? :-d this is the mechanism to unload the waggon. built in the waggon with open gates... ... and with closed ones. almost done. this is the first time, i realized that minifigs actually can step on those ladders. :-$ a short lift and the wheels are fixed. this darn mechanism! wait, i?m coming with my monkey wrench! >:-) who opened that door again? do i have to do it all on my own? :'-( finally the work is done. now have a brake. one shot from the front/back. you can see the car is really huge! 8-? i put it behind the red car of the 4512. that sure looked very strange. *wacko* the set fits a lot better to the other cars of the "my own train" theme than to the older ones. the score: brick selection: 10/10 excellent color and brick selection (these were the days...) playability: 9/10 great unloading mechanism price/piece count ratio: 8/10 at peeron it says 20$, i got it for 39,95$ -> 30?/228 bricks. not really cheap, but worth every cent! :-) overall rating: 9/10 and a definity "must buy" for rolling stock lovers. sad enough it?s not available on s@h any more. but there are still sets on bl and ebay. that?s for now folks, thank you for reading. i have some job to do...

0 great review. very funny with "little you" helping with the building. i got the wagon myself, i really like it. what more did you get? morten

1 *wub* *wub* *wub* *wub* *wub* holodoc, i seriously have some love for your review!! you're in it and using a fabuland wrench!!! such a clever review with a great sense of humor! i really liked this train set and it adds so much to a train layout, especially when you buy multiples. tlc is throwing away a potential gold mine by discontinuing this line. :'-( it is also nice to see those beautiful consistent slopes in that picture. it really is sad that tlc is letting quality slip. they don't seem to be responding to the issue they way they did the bley/frown fiasco. perhaps we afol need to make more of a stink! to the embassy!!! >:-( again great job holodoc and thanks for sharing *sweet* *y* what an excellent and fun review!!

1 yes my spongebob fans, its time for another review !! lets look at our bikini bottom map and head strait to meet miss puff at her boating school. she is waiting for us to give us a guided tour of her establishment ;-) another bit of sb history: this set comes from the following episode: boating school: spongebob fails his boating test for the 38th time (what a freaking retard lool). he's so determined to get his license that patrick decides to help him. he implants a walkie-talkie inside sb?s head in order to cheat and tell him what to do. you will say that i am biais but i really enjoy building this set and i really like the sb theme !! lets hope 2008 brings more of that cool spongieness !! but i digress... here are general pics of the instruction booklet and the dss (g there are loads of crappy stickers in that one also !!). as you can see the set is divided in 3 polybags. shamelessly (but nonetheless wilfully hehe), i will disregard the third one which is that playability crap course !! i would have reviewed it but since it involves stickers, i didn?t want to ruin the parts and without stickers it would look dull, plain and ugly (it does look crappy with so imagine without), so that review will not be 100% complete and i do apologise in advance. but how many of you would have build that and keep it hehe off :-p 1/ mfs and extras i will start with the really cool miss puff *wub* (the fig mind you !!). she looks a bit stressed !! no wonder, that sponge menace will bring her to the hospital once again hehe. as you can see, that mf comprises 3 parts: the small blue 1x1 round and the 2 major parts. yeay another great stupid looking sb. i love those idiotic faces !! 3 different sb figs and 3 idiotic faces hehe. you never can get enough of them !! here is just a regular patrick. too bad patrick doesn?t have different expressions ! the pull back boat car: nothing really to report (except the fact that i left it sticker free !!) the only thing i built from the third polybag is that pretty cool ancker holding tower thingie !! looks great in a lighthouse set hehe. yes the roud tile bouey is printed !! its the same as in sb's bed in the bikini bottom set ;-) ok, its time for those two great buildings: the lighthouse and the school + pontoon !! before reviewing them individually, here is a general pic. 2/ the lighthouse one of the main reason to own that great set !! sure it suffers from accute stickeretite (sad but :-d ). t worst is that door), but nonetheless a great and simple building !! great white/red colour scheme, and a really fantastic 2 turning lights !! i really like the yellow top of the lighthouse, it adds to the comic atmosphere of that theme instead of having a more plain red/white only. the rear has nothing really fancy, except tools to fix it in case of problems hehe. the only thing i modified since i didn?t build the third polybag is that i got rid of the trechnic parts on the right of the lighthoue to replace them with regular ?logs? all hail the tower king !! :-d 3/ the school and pontoon i really like that little building and its great to see that once again tlc uses the amazing dark blue color !! its really a simple design but looks fantastic and can be used for many things in a town hehe i also really like the combination with those dark bluish grey slopes !! the rear reveals the desk, stickers on the wall (d?oh !!) and two clams serving as chairs (really like on the show). its really great to see that tlc stays really as close to the show as possible. the pontoon again is simple yet really cool and effective. and its really nice to have 2 lifesaving boueys. the only thing i modified since i didn?t build the third polybag is that i got rid of the trechnic parts in front of the pontoon to replace them with regular ?logs? on the overall, i think its really a great set !! apart from the crap stickers, i think tlc should have ditched (or simplified) the third playability polybag to lower the cost !! oh well, parts are always usefull (except those one part shitty palm trees !!). so until my next review, i bid you farewell my spongebob fans !! and i really hope to see next year hehe will sb get his driver?s license one day ? for the sake of bikini bottom, lets hope not !! no license ever on !! *yoda*

1 that?s really a great and overall nice playset with a very cool mrs. puff and a fine new spongebob! *sweet* the boating school?s indeed very nice with a beautiful color scheme, and so is the lighthouse.... i?m really tempted to buy a second set just to "complete" these buildings.... although it?s a little too expensive for doing so, and it wouldn?t even fit with the style of the other sb sets. x-d wet highway to the poor puffer fish? privat hell on! :-d

1 *yoda* comes through again! i love this set... but it just costs too much for australians so i will be giving it a miss. :'-( it is a shame as it has clams in it... 8-|

1 i like this one better than the other one for parts and such, plus i'm generally a sucker for any different minifig, but yeah, that price is steep. great review though!

1 one more sb face - yeah *wub*! being a lighthouse freak i really like it, the trans clear blue ones rocks *y*! i?m getting it - period! sb on copmike

1 another great review, thanks *yoda*! man, those smooth slopes really look like crap when on a roof :-| that was the whole reason they had texture in the first place... |-/ i'll never liked those, they feel so cheap! the new sb head is great, and can mrs. puff's legs move? i just ask since her feet are separate, and in figs where the legs can't move, they're usually one piece at the bottom to keep them from breaking off. the set looks great, and seems to have a lot of playability

0 yoda, i don't thank you for this review, and after the chump bucket review too! because i'm so exited to have them that since i ordered them from s@h, i come back home aftre the work the faster i can, with the hope to see a big box on my bed... and this, even if i know that it tooks more than 6-7 days to have my order... this mrs. puff figs is really really nice *wub* and this 3rd sb head too!

1 thank you *yoda* for strike 2! it?s sb again. |-/ sticker alarm! :-x but this set is better than chum bucket. there are far more interesting parts if you don?t like sb. especially the light house and the little hut with the wooden pontoon. *y* and yet again another set with smooth slopes and rough ones... too bad, too bad. >:-( >:-( >:-( if i just knew the person who is responsible for that... >:-)

1 nice review mate, the set look's great and a real must for all those sb fan's out there. the whole set scream playability that's for sure, which is great because let's be honest their's gonna be alot of kid's and *yoda* out their playing with it :-p x-d ;-) . geezzzzz what is it with all those bloody stikers? this set would be soooooo much better with printed piece's instead of those, still once your over that at least the rest is ok. am i the only one who thinks mrs puff kinda look's like a kinder egg toy? their's nothing wrong with that mind you (yes i have a kinder problem x-d ) just seem's strange to me.

1 maybe mrs puff has a nice toy inside x-d i like this review. the lighthouse part and the school are nice enough for other towns. and the figs are nice, even mrs puffs 2 pieces you can't use for other things. :-) pity that it's 50 dollars/+/- 60 euro. for half price i would think about it.

0 thank you for the nice review, sinner! i also bought this set but in combination with 4883 when it was on sale (50% - hurray!) at s@h. i made a short review of 4883 but wasn?t really sure what to tell about 4884. so i?m glad you did that for me. :-d i have different feelings about this set. on the one hand i love the lion. he is really impressive (even my wife -not known for being lego enthusiastic- asked me, if there were more animals of this kind). the lion is - restricted - poseable and the colors used are fantastic. *wub* 3 models can be built simultaneously - that?s great! on the other hand i still don?t know what to do with these rotation joints. *wacko* and the other models are somehow disappointing compared to the lion. i seem to have missed the little lizard. :-$ i put it on my "to do-list". like all the creator sets: great parts pack - but wait until they get on sale! x-d for me - i had a lot more fun with 4883. indeed: roarrrr on! ;-)

1 lego 75915 pteranodon capture i'm glad to review this nice set; 75915 pteranodon capture name: pteranodon capture set number: 75915 pieces: 174 price: $19.99 minifigs: 2 theme: jurassic world year of release: 2015 links: box the front of the box has the jurassic world logo along with the set number, piece count, etc. its a decent box size for a $20 set. here it is compared to a minifigure. here's the back of the box. it shows all of the features from the set an ad for the video game. the back also shows a small picture with a silhouette of the dinosaurs from the line, along with their set numbers. instruction booklet the booklet shows the same thing as the front of the box, nothing more, nothing less. near the back of the booklet, there is a picture with all of the characters from the sets. the other page shows all the dinosaurs with a mini box that shows the size comparisons. the minifigures the minifigures in this set are simon masrani and an acu. both of them have excellent printing on the front and the back. the gun is the same one from tlm that the ssp used. simon masrani is the only one with a double sided face. his second face shows a scared/worried exp<b></b>ression. he has a zipped up jacket or jumpsuit with a shirt underneath. the acu trooper only has one face which is a scared/worried exp<b></b>ression. i would have a scared exp<b></b>ression too if i was about to get eaten by a dinosaur. he has great detail on his torso and legs. let's take a look at the vest. the vest is the same mold from the ssp in tlm i think. it has the letters acu on the front too. the back is nothing interesting. pteranodon the pteranodon has great printing too. the colors match the ones that the pteranodons from the movie have. the wings, mouth, and head are a rubbery type of plastic and are easily bendable. it uses the same mold from the pteranodon in the 2012 dino line. here's a comparison between the two. spare parts the spare parts aren't many, just a few extras. the helicopter at first the helicopter was 'meh' when i first saw it on the box. now that i've built it, i've got to say that i really like it. its my favorite helicopter of all of the ones i've built. its sturdy and sleek. it's not too bulky either. the first play feature in this set is the net launcher. it works pretty well, not one of my favorite features but it does what it's meant to do. the other play feature is on the other side. its a stud shooter which can be used by a minifigure. you can put it on their hand or you can leave it there and let someone operate it. the shooter can fold up inside the helicopter as well. there are stickers on both sides of the helicopter and they also have the jurassic world logo with dino marks. final verdict value: 9/10 - for $20 this set isn't that bad. the parts count is a little low for a $20 set but the price is probably because of licensing. other than that, it's a great deal, i would've hoped for maybe some bait for the pteranodon but that can easily be fixed. design: 9/10 - i really love the way this helicopter looks, it's sleekness and design is great. the only flaw this has is the huge net launcher, it's too big in my opinion. minifigs: 10/10[/b] - the minifigures are extremely detailed and it even includes an exclusive minifigure. playability: 9/10 - there are many things you can do with this set. the swoosh factor is great and so are the play features. parts: 10/10[/b] - they're useful parts and there isn't many huge specialized pieces in here either. overall: 9/10 - this set is great for fans of jurassic world, it's also a nice parts pack. there's one exclusive minifigure in here too which makes it even better. having a little fun with the set hope you liked my first review here on eurobricks! please leave any suggestions on what to improve, thanks! edited by thelazychicken, 02 may 2015 - 10:19 pm.

0 nice review! although, that picture of the ad reminded me of how some of the things surrounding jurassic world (lego, that is) seems hastily put together. just look at that the minifig. he is star lord's head and hair, indiana jones' torso with different arms, and city legs. to me, that seems a bit weak, especially for a video game.

0 nice review! i really hope its avaliable for sale in the us.

1 lego 31036 creator toy and grocery shop thanks to eurobricks for making this review possible! for years, lego has offered a house of some sort in the creator line each year - with the standard creator 3-in-1 instructions, that's given us a very wide variety of housing. in 2014, they added a business option with their 31026 bike shop and cafe set. this continues into this year's toy and grocery shop set. these shops are smaller than the very detailed modular buildings, but that should help them fit in better with the other city sets, and this also lets them get into more kids' cities with their lower pricetag. name: toy and grocery shop set number: 31036 pieces: 466 price: $39.99 minifigs: 2 theme: creator year of release: 2015 links: bricklink peeron brickset the box the front of the box shows the "a" version model out of the three, plus insets of the b and c versions. i like the sorta-european looking backdrop; it goes well with the styling of the buildings. interestingly, the main model is shown opened up for play, while the two insets show those versions folded. the box top on the top of the box, lego helpfully shows that with 3 of these sets, you can make a whole street. the box back on the back, you get to again see all three versions together, but this time, folded. it's a little creepy though with those clones running around :) the manuals yep, three actual, printed manuals. there's nothing indicating them as being a, b, and c models, but it's pretty obvious looking at the designs which is the "main" model and which are the alternates. the contents bags of parts and two plates. nothing terribly exciting to see here.... the minifigs nothing new here, but two nice figs none-the-less. well, bricklink does say that both figs are unique to this set, but there's not any new parts to them. the closest thing to rare is the female head - it's only in this set, 2013's dragon mountain castle set, a uk store grand opening set, and one of the 2014 holiday freebie sets. the faces aren't that unique, but i guess this exact combo of two faces on the head is. i love the kid torso with the spaceman on it. the minifig backs no back printing on anything here except for an alternate female face. sorry. i do like that her two faces are so different though. that's much better than when a head has a "scared" and a "more scared" face. the "c" build enough with the basics; let's build. i'm going to review them in the same order i built them, backwards. since you can tell immediately looking at the 3 designs that they're going to use different numbers of pieces and so forth, i figured i'd build the smallest first lest it seem like a letdown. all three have some basic similarities - the two plates are hinged to give a building that opens for play. they also do have interiors, which you can see starting to form here. the "c" build, front it's a pretty quick build, so it's done already. here's the front of the building with it opened up. like this, it appears to be two separate stores, a newsstand and some sort of shop you can enter. all the printed tiles help give the newsstand a detailed appearance, but i'm not sure why they've got a $100 bill lying on the ledge... the "c" build, rear from the back side, the interiors are pretty plain. the shop half has a plant in a jar and a weird chair, and the newsstand just has a register. the "c" build, sides here's the two sides of the folded building. on the hinge side, there's a bunch of windows in a disjointed wall with random colors. on the other, why did they put in a huge window when the set does include a trans-clear door that could have gone there? and you get a small patch of plants, like so many sets seem to have these days. the "c" build, extras that's a lot of leftovers there. and not just little stuff - multiple doors, stairs, etc. and unused sand green is always a little sad.... the "b" build, 1 a pretty similar start, with the hinge and little garden and some tiles along the ground. the "b" build, 2 now we see a big windowed wall, some details like lights, and how it has the usual alternate model "weird part usage" - like a 1x4 brick with side studs being used over the doorway, even though those side studs will not get used. the "b" build, front the finished building gives us a nice little post office, with a letter-carrying bird on the roof. hope that's not their normal method of delivery! something about the colors just doesn't work for me though. the combo of white / light grey / dark grey / black / sand green plus tan is just too much. the tan window and door frames i don't like. the "b" build, inside on the inside, things are weird. the counter on the left is ok, but the light above the door (with a yellow clip? ugly!) is too big, and everything else over there by the door doesn't make much sense either. the "b" build, sides i like the front side here, except the colors are still too much. the bench, greenery, mailbox on the corner, and streetlight are all nice. the boy is a little creepy though - binoculars in hand plus a telescope on the roof of the post office? why? the hinge side shows more of the weird colors you get in the wall, but that's going to be hidden when the set is open. plus we even see that on big modulars at times, so it's not so terrible. the "b" build, leftovers again, a lot of leftover parts. it's obvious this was another alternate, but it'd be nice to see more of them used to make a bigger building. but let's move on to the model that does use them all... the "a" build, 1 the first half starts like this. maybe it's just my bias, but it already feels like a more detailed build. bottles on the wall, the yellow and red awning over the window, etc. the "a" build, 2 the other half starts off with detailed work too. i think that's a red vending machine. the stairs are also very solidly built. i also appreciate the effort to get that diagonal base where a door will be - it's such a nice touch to have sections of a building that aren't right angles. the "a" build, 3 not too much has been added, but i wanted to showcase the tiny toys before they get hidden by a wall. that robot and train are just fantastic little micro builds. the "a" build, 4 things are coming together quickly. the walls, windows, and doors get the first floor nearly done. i'm still not big on the sand green and tan combo, but i do really like the red and yellow awnings. the "a" build, 5 it appears the shop owner lives upstairs, since we've got a bedroom forming here. the bed is a little plain, but the table and lamp on the other half are great. and my big fingers did not like putting all those railings on the balcony, with the telescope posts and tile tops. knocked quite a few off before i got them all done. the "a" build, front and it's done. all the details make this set really feel like a mini-modular. the roofline has great greebling, and the shop contents, and on and on. it's not perfect though. the tiny car above the toy store door isn't nearly as good as the toys inside. and the kid's yellow scooter? the wheels aren't even on the ground, much less able to roll. the scooter looks decent though, so that counts for something. well, at least as long as you are at this angle, since the boy's only got 1 foot on the 1 stud wide scooter. the "a" build, inside most of the interior has been seen already. the roof though does a nice job of being interesting for a roof. a skylight, the edge rails, etc. and you can see there's not much "wrong color" in the walls. the "a" model, sides an interesting building when folded up. very tall and skinny. you can tell it's not really meant to be displayed this way - it's meant to be open. the good - lots! i like the awning, the diagonal door, the flowerbox under the upper window, the folding gate on the balcony that lets it be used in open or closed mode, and the green / white / blue colors. the bad - well, the stairs end short of the upper door, i still don't really like the tan doorframes (i think black would have been better), and why don't the upper floors match up in size? the "a" model, leftovers ah, that's more like it. just a few small pieces left as spares. the errors you might have to click through to the full-size versions, but i did catch a few weird errors in the manuals. first, in the photo of the newsstand, the map in the front corner is on there sideways. the map does have a clear north arrow printed on it. on the second image, the boy's feet are hanging off the edge. just unusual to see an alignment error in the manual like that. the comparison here are this set and the modular detective office side by side. there's a huge difference - as you'd expect. but is the difference more than you'd expect? this set is 466 parts, $40. the do is 2262 pieces and $160. 5 times the parts, 4 times the price. looking at them side by side, i'd expect a bigger difference in both. the conclusion so, what's my conclusion on this model? i love the main model, but the alternates are meh. it's a nice set for someone looking for a town building other than police and fire stations, but who isn't ready to move to the modular line. compared to the modulars though, it seems overpriced. part of that is because the huge modulars are actually a great deal compared to other lego sets. i'm also a little surprised that it's so small, when you compare it to the city sets like a police station. those are generally designed with much more open space, letting them be more of a playset. this one is small and cramped, so it'd be tougher to play in. it's not really a city set though. the ratings value: 7/10 - it's under the 10 cents a part mark, but that's largely due to having a ton of tiny parts. all those flowers and decorative 1x1 round studs add up quickly! design: 7/10 - good and bad on the colors, and there's a big difference between the quality of the main vs alternate models. having so many leftover pieces is one thing when the creator set makes 3 very different models (ie a boat, plane, and truck). when it's 3 buildings, it seems wasteful to have so many parts leftover. minifigs: 6/10 - i'm not sure they both fit the set. i suppose the boy is going to the toy store and the woman is going to the grocery? but there's no storekeeper in either. the woman doesn't look like a storekeeper to me, so that's why i assume she's another shopper. i love the boy, but the woman is just so-so - except that i do appreciate the head having two very different expressions. but again, that doesn't fit the set. i can't see her scared face being used. playability: 6/10 - the shops are detailed with registers and so forth, but it's all so tiny it'd be hard to play with the figs in it. parts: 9/10 - tons of windows and doors, plus nice sand green bricks. but some things (the large blue curves used on the roof for example) are weirdly specialized and would be hard to use in another building design. overall: 7/10 - i'd recommend doing what i did - build the alternates first, then the main since that's how you'll want to leave it. i'd really like to see the price a little lower compared to other sets (again, the part count is inflated due to so many tiny parts) and the finished building is tiny, but it's loaded with neat details.

0 great review! very thorough. it's not a set which makes me run to tye store, but it definitely has some fun elements. i do like your new grey background. your pictures look great!

0 any chance you have a picture of the news stand next to the detectives office building as i would love to see the scaling for that?

0 nice review mostlytechnic. i particularly like the use of grey background surface for the pictures. it somehow makes the building stand out more. good job!

-1 a terrific, very comprehensive review - but i'm not at all impressed with this set. it feels like a mishmash of bricks with no clear design aesthetic and as such blatantly underdeveloped (i.e. designed to hit a price/brick count point rather than provide a solid set in the creator town tradition). compared to other creator sets at this price point (31025 - mountain hut, for example) it feels utterly uninspired and ugly. edited by johnny6666, 04 may 2015 - 10:02 am.

-1 cheers for putting in the time to create a wonderful review. i am not a huge fan of this set; i like the colour combinations, but it all seems a bit all-too-simple. it can (and will) be nicely modularised, though!

1 reviews for this set really should picture them next to the bike shop & cafe, which it's intended to be compatible with right down to the size of the baseplates and grey tiles around the edge. it doesn't look that great on its own, but if you add the two sets together you get something that begins to look like a street scene.

-1 lightningtiger, on 04 may 2015 - 12:55 pm, said: thanks 'mostlytechnic' for this review, i only brought this set to continue the shop series from creator. in my opinion it's only half as good as the bike shop/cafe one. plus it doesn't fit the same as that pair of shops, oh well maybe next year lego creator will have a better one. brick on review on 'mostlytechnic' ! well, it is only half the price of the bike/cafe one too :) but i agree, it seems odd that they've made a couple "shop" creator sets that don't fit together in style like this. i guess they've done that for years with the creator houses though - none of those really work together. david thomsen, on 04 may 2015 - 01:33 pm, said: reviews for this set really should picture them next to the bike shop & cafe, which it's intended to be compatible with right down to the size of the baseplates and grey tiles around the edge. it doesn't look that great on its own, but if you add the two sets together you get something that begins to look like a street scene. interesting to get two comments right in a row with opposite opinions :) i don't have the bike/cafe set, but to me, they don't looks like they'd really go together. they're the same concept (two buildings that fold in half) but the sidewalk is different size and they just feel differently styled to me.

1 as a fan of creator houses, i really want to like this set. however, i think that creator houses have long filled a niche that's neglected elsewhere: residential houses. we haven't had a larger residential house since 2013; i'm not sure if these sets have anything to do with that, but it seems like they may be the replacement for larger houses. and i'd much rather have a larger house set than a set like this. i also agree with many others here; something about it just feels incomplete. i think that the various city business buildings we've gotten in recent years (including those in this year's city square--which is much more expensive than this, but also contains much more) make for better buildings at this scale.

1 thanks andy_0306uk, your very clever strategic decision to serve us with blurry pictures allowed me to glance at this review without ruinating that whole wonderful advent surprise too much.... :-p *y* but although i loved the last year?s one, i think they could do another theme (or perhaps even two calendars), because right now castle?s pretty hot imo.

0 thank you andy for your speed review! *y* so there?s nothing left to open while advent? ;-) i like all the tiny sets, it needn?t be another police- and fireman |-/ , but well, what would an advent calendar be without them? :-d one thing about the train traffic lights: tlc used to give us similar lights, but you could show either of the lights with the other one being covered: that one was waaay better! :'-( just a little piece more would have done the thing... ...and i won?t mention the radar-crap-dish :-x let me quote franz beckenbauer: "is' denn scho' weihnacht?" (legendary quote from an promotional job he did years ago - "is it x-mas already?")

-1 no girls....again! and no santa? whats up with that? sure there are many nice pieces to give life to every city layout.. i would love something more simple a girl taking her dog for a walk a boy on a bicycle simpler things...not all the workmen again!

1 informative review, thanks! *y* as usual, it makes a fairly good parts pack. wish i could pick up a few on deep discount, but at full price one is fine. i do like the 'stewards' and some of the workmen. overall, i think i'm looking more forward to the belville calendar, just for it's assortment of unusual parts. ugh. belville. still, parts are parts, and it's got some. phoinix summed up one of the most common complaints i hear about all of the lines in 3 simple words ... "no girls....again!" good job, now get lego to listen. ;-)

0 whoa! it's out already! *places order* i guess i should thank you andy, because i might have missed this one just like i missed last year's calendar. now all i have to do is wait two weeks and pick it up at the post office across the border.

0 i've never been fond of these sets, but still buy them every year because my daughters like them. i am, however, looking forward to the belville advent calendar, which likely will have some parts that usually are quite hard to get in it. my girls will love it, and i love all the belville parts. http://shop.lego.com/product/?p=7600 if anyone has pics of what is contained in this set i would love to see them.

-1 thanks andy for the review! i prefer the city advent calendar 2006 a lot! those mini sets are nor good for me! the "road subtheme" sets are nice, but the others, not so good! the 05 version waf ok, the 06 version was better, with bigger sets, and more building ones! and the 07 is poor! it's just 2-3 pieces to put together on 2x4 plates... where are the gardening accessories? where are some nice small constructions that you can put in your layout like a mailbox or an orodator? and the chrismas tree looks :-x imo! and no santa... *y* for andy *n* for this calendar

0 i'm a big fan of anime and have watched some mechas like full metal panic, neon evangelion: genesis (it is a mecha!) and chobits (well... she is a robot...), so i was curious to see what this new exo force line was all about. the colorful sets and manga-like characters didn't persuade me right away, but the urgent need for a couple of white 3x3 wing plates made me purchase this little thing. it cost me 70 dkr as you can see on the box. this is 9.30 euro, or about the same an american has to pay for the new republic cruiser. pretty expensive for so few pieces (90 + a spare technic pin) the box an action-packed box with one of the sides being oddly empty except from the lego-logo. what's inside there is a small building instruction, two polybags (no bag building here) and a sticker sheet with alarmingly many stickers. the build it takes so little time to build this set that i didn't get to take any pictures of the process. every step was accompanied by an element description although i doubt most of you will need that with so few pieces to keep track on. most of the dark green bricks have a sticker - even the slopes where the rough surface makes stickers fall off easily! there should also have been a sticker on the windshield, but i wanted to keep that piece clean for better usage later. (i'm one of those who keeps stickers on the bricks) the model you want to see this model from the front, as the back is pretty much neglected there isn't much for the pilot to grab a hold on either. he is pretty much a sitting duck up there with the screen giving him only partial cover. there is a huge wrench next to him which kind of symbolizes the crudeness of the mech. the set isn't called "cyclone defender" for nothing. the right arm might hold an ordinary light assault riffle, but the other has a spinning disc with samurai swords which you can turn with the yellow knob on the backside. those of you who have seen robot wars might remember the incredible power of this melee weapon from a robot named hypnodisc. it would have been nice had there been a pull-back motor to power the disc (i'm sure lego has a lot of these in stock), but the simple mechanism still works reasonably well. the riffle comes off and a pin makes it easy to hold with the hand, but the disc is fixed to the arm. it is also a problem that the swords get misaligned quickly during play. the minifig i really like this minifig because of the neat idea with an expression on each side that lego has made a standard for exo force. posability most mech-moc'ers show off their creations using gundam-like poses. with two joints per leg (one being the ankles) and one for an arm i thought of some less serious poses: crawling (silent like a ninja!): belly gliding: kick off!; upside down: final rating i have to disappoint you here. this is my first set in this line and i have absolutely no idea of how good it is. the last robot i bought was the awesome 6889 spyrius recon robot for the same price, but it is in a completely different genre. the set had what i expected (two white wings) and is as such a no-nonsense set. i guess it would be of more use if you have some more exo force, which i don't. 6/10 ups: has great minifig, weapons and is easy to build. downs: crude design and a bit too expensive for what you get. (brickshelf gallery)

1 a funny review with cool pics, thanks lasse d. a somehow mediocre mecha design, but a beautiful dark green color! upside down mecha yoga exercises on! :-d

0 nice review :) but... you paid how much? this set is priced around 7 euros here in germany, which is a very fair price for what you get in my oppinion. it?s a little disappointing though, that i couldn?t think of any alternate builds for this set, and there are no inspirations on the box or the ef website.

1 i have 2 of these guys. :-d it's awesome, only cost me 13 bucks nz, for a comparison, the castle crossbow attack set costs $10 nz. for the win! did i read this wrong? you paid about the same price as the republic cruiser??! the republic cruiser costs $200 nz, and the cyclone defencer costs $13. i must have read that wrong... *wacko*

0 i guess that?s what some people refer to as "sarcasm" ;)

-1 nice review but i dont think i'll get this set i dont relly like the look it looks ugly, hmmm anyway...

1 thanks for the great review. i love the poses. :-d i got this for my kids and they didn't mind it but i think they prefer my sets because they aren't theirs. :-|

1 i couldn't find a review of this wonderful set in here, so here it goes! i got the set for msrp (180kr = 24 euro) which is a fair price here in denmark. as all other creator sets there are instructions for several models (3 in this case). the box the box is a little larger than city sets in the same price range. the primary model is shown on the front while you see the secondary ones on the back. what you get 312 pieces in 5 polybags and two building instructions: one for the primary model and the other for the rest. the built it was impossible for me to speed build this model because of the nifty functional details from the retractable landing gear to the wings that can turn by means of the handle in the back of the model. it took me a full hour to build it because i had to "test" how it all works together. the finished model the landing gear isn't fully enclosed when retracted and the models are sub-minifig scale, but i still love the design of the models. the doors for the rear wheels open as you pull the wheels down and the final piece of functionality comes from the wings that can either tilt (the horizontal stabilizers) or have elevators. wing in, wings out, wings in, wings out... ratings as a whole i actually like this set even more than the big rig. the models are just as diverse but the added functionality makes the plane more fun to play with than the rig. price: 7/10 - a good price, but not a bargain as the big rig design: 9/10 - there could have been a sligtly higher level of details in the main model, but all models are really good looking and i especially like the design of the hovercraft. functionality: 10/10 - i guess you could ask for working rudders, opening cockpit and so on, but the plane is really filled with movable parts and the turning of the wings works really well. secondary models: 7/10 - a hovercraft! how awesome is that!? if only the last model was just as inventive instead of a standard helicopter... modifiability: 8/10 - the bricks are in ordinary colours and there is a good variety of them giving you plenty of possibilities for moc'ing. you can easily make the main model into something that looks more like an f-14. 9/10 probably as good as it gets for a creator set in this price range. it is entertaining to both build and play with, looks good and the secondary models are worth building as well! (brickshelf gallery)

1 nice review and a nice set. thanks for taking the time. i'll want to pick this guy up.

1 great review lasse d. a definite two *y* up. i bought this set for the swing-wing concept. i was very curious what tlc's design was like. i have been working on modifying it just a little to look more like the f-14. so far i have completed the back section, but i need to finish the cockpit. overall this is a great set. i *wub* tlc's swing-wing concept. model on!!

1 a fine set, a great review and good additional pictures. thanks lasse d and sinner. teamwork on! *y*

0 lasse d, on sep 21 2007, 05:09 am, said: thank you sinner for bringing the pictures of the hovercraft. i think it is a really cool model, but the steering wheel doen't work too well. i agree. errr... sorry if i have annoyed you by posting the pictures. looking at your brickshelf folder you had taken photos of the hovercraft as well and i seem to have stepped on your toes. :-$ feel free to beat me up, or i could do it myself if you prefer... 8-| (i prefer bigger pictures as i get tired of clicking, waiting, clicking, waiting. if the pictures are all there all you have to do is click then wait! :-p )

1 ?34.99 is not too shabby. the big guy itself is nice, but the gem of the set is the mech. really nice mech i must say! great for posing. the mini figs suprisingly nice little build/vehicle. never seen this element before....its probably nothing new though, lol. no articulation of the legs? nooooooo! phew! the front two legs do articulate. would of been bad if they didnt. overall, i give the set 7.8/10. not the best, but its actually quite nice, and the yellow mech is awesome. if it was him on his own, then 9.4/10! cheers

-1 thanks for the review! i really dislike this set but i thought much worse of it when we saw the first pic. i think it was a good idea (mech transporter) pursued in a horribly wrong way! :-x thanks again! :-) batbrick away! >:-)

1 i so need to buy this! where did you get it from? it says limited, so i guess it?s only available in certain stores, as the bridge walker was, or supernova or golden guardian.

1 nice! *y* doesn't look that bad at all, but what's with the first pic? the one of skeleton tower? *wacko* is it so we can see the corner of the intructions? :-p edited by iamded, 30 september 2007 - 09:29 pm.

1 nice! i really want this now. the yellow mech was the thing i disliked on it, but now its my favourite part of it. -zots

1 that yellow mech would make a killer $10 set! i would buy it on its own... *wub*

0 nightmare_zero, on oct 14 2007, 03:59 pm, said: why are the best sets limited editions? >:-( you can still get it quite easily at s@h or in lego stores. i know of one in oberhausen and in cologne, and i think there?s one in hamburg and munich as well. depending on where you live you might get it in one of those shops fpr 49.99 euros.

0 i just got set number 7721, the new special edition crawler thing in woolworths in croydon, england. apparently it is a woolworths exclusive over here and i didnt expect to see it on shelves for a while yet. pleased to get it, just about to start building it. looks like a very good set. i love the yellow mech.

1 it is no secret that marvel is one of the most successful companies right now. from the avengers to the x-men and down to even the most obscure characters like ant-man, every one of their movies has been a big hit until now. the latest marvel movie, fant4stic, was released last month and while i have not seen it yet, i'm sure it's just as great as their other movies. i mean, it has the word "fantastic" in the title after all! and being the smart business that they are, the lego company decided to get in on the hype early and capitalize on this movie's undoubtful success two years in advance by making a set featuring fant4stic's main villain, dr. doom. now that's what i call forward thinking! but did they do a good job with it or were they being overhasty? let's find out! set number: 76005 name: spider-man: daily bugle showdown theme: marvel super heroes subtheme: ultimate spider-man year of release: 2013 pieces: 476 minifigs: 5 price: $49.99 usd s@h description: quote swing into the daily bugle and stop dr. doom! dr. doom and his henchman beetle are attacking the daily bugle in their speedy jet to steal spider-man's secret identity. it's up to spider-man and nova to swing in and stop them! trigger the daily bugle's explosion functions to cause destruction as the jet fires missiles! stop dr. doom from hitching the jet's anchor hook to the safe with spider-man's secret inside! knock beetle off the building with the swinging web attack and drop dr. doom inside with the rooftop trapdoor! then fly nova in through the broken window with the dumpster catapult function and send those villains back to where they came from. includes spider-man, nova, dr. doom, beetle and j. jonah jameson with accessories and weapons. the first thing that comes to mind after reading this description is: wow, that's a lot of tms! anyway, here are some resource links for this set: brickset bricklink rebrickable the box since this set is based on the ultimate spider-man cartoon, the box has the usual usm design with the red marvel super heroes background, an illustration of spidey in the upper right corner, and the usm logo in the lower right. as usual, there is a minifig line up in the lower left, and since this was before the terrible redesign, you can see the full body of the minifigs. i really miss this type of line up. there is quite a lot going on here: doctor doom attacking the daily bugle in his jet while simultaneously reaching for j. jonah jameson below with his jet's claw, spider-man (reluctantly) swings in to save him, while nova fights off the beetle. it's a pretty cool scene, even though it's not very accurate to the show. in "beetle mania", the episode that this set is based on, the beetle was indeed out to kill jjj, but it was in order to stop him from exposing his identity, not spider-man's (although spidey was next on jjj's list). and while he is a recurring villain on the show, doctor doom had nothing to do with this plot and didn't even appear in the episode aside from a brief cameo. it's awesome that they included him anyway, though, so i'm not gonna complain. note that the tower is so tall that it wraps around the top of the box. there, you can also see a scale reference with the spider-man minifig. on the back of the box, you can see the interior of the bugle and all of its play features which there are quite a few of since this is a playset. it's all illustrated pretty well, although lego's choice of sound effects is still a mystery to me. i don't get why they don't go for spider-man's signature "fwip!" instead of "fazzing!" and i didn't know that a breaking window made the sound "btoom!" but i digress. contents inside the box you will find three instruction booklets (one smaller than the others), a comic book, a fairly large sticker sheet, five numbered bags, and two loose pieces: a white string piece and a gray 16x8 plate. there aren't really any notable pieces and nobody cares about the comic bock (no offense to the artist), so lets get right to the instructions. they are pretty straight forward and easy to follow. some of the pages have a ghostly image of spidey, nova, and dr. doom in the top right corner which is fitting since these are all minifigs that appear in this set (which is strangely not something that can be said for many other super heroes instructions with this type of artwork). minifigures as with most super heroes sets, most people will get this set mainly for the minifigs, so without further ado, let's talk about them. spider-man is the same old bootless one you get in almost every usm set. not much to say about him. some might complain that we don't get spidey's alter ego peter parker in this set, but in the usm cartoon, mj is actually the one who works at the daily bugle, not peter. curse the creators of this cartoon for ruining our chances of getting a new peter parker minifig by trying to mix things up. next we get j. jonah jameson. he appeared in a spider-man 2 set before, but this is a complete redesign. he now has a blue suit with a red tie, a unique face print, and that combed-back hair in dark gray. this new hairpiece doesn't suit him at all and the old flat top hair was perfect for him in my opinion, so i don't know why they changed it. the good thing about this change, however, is the fact that this piece is exclusive to this set in that color. nova on the other hand is spot-on. he comes with a new helmet mold and some nice torso printing. however, he, too, is missing his boots. tlc should have started making dual-colored legs a long time ago. here are some reference images to compare them to. okay, so jjj's hair may not be completely black in the show, but i still think they should have given his minifig a black hairpiece. his suit is also not quite the right color. he rarely appears in person in the show (including the episode this set is based on) and is usually seen on screens around new york, so this is the best picture of him i could find. i guess i should be happy they included a minifig of him at all. in the episode, it was actually mary jane who was at the bugle during beetle's attack, so it would have made more sense to include her, but we got her in the spider-copter set one year later, so that's ok. all three of them have back printing. in jjj's case i'm using that term loosely since it is only comprised of two lines, but it's nice that they went through the trouble of adding them. both jjj and nova come with angry alternate faces. it almost looks like they're trying to out-angry each other. who do you think looks angrier? let me know in the comments section below. now let's talk about the bad guys. even though he would be better off in a fantastic four set, it's great to finally get victor van doom, one of the greatest marvel villains ever and in comics in general. he comes with a dark green hood which was new and exclusive in that color at the time, and he is the only minifig in this set that has leg printing. beetle is a regular minifig with wings. the metallic printing on his face and torso is pretty nice, but i wish it would have continued onto his legs as well. the beetle looks quite accurate to his on-screen counterpart. the only thing that could have improved him is a new helmet mold with pointy eyebrows/antennae. doctor doom, however, looks nothing like he does in the movie. i just don't understand how lego could have messed him up so badly. maybe they were working off of early concept art or something. here is a back view of doom and beetle. beetle would be a pretty boring minifig if it wasn't for his wings which are awesome with their holographic texture. they are so mesmerizing, i could look at those things all day. this piece also appeared in trans. light green in the galaxy squad sets which came out at the same time. here they are without their gear. as you can see, they both have back printing as well. and no, doctor doom does not come with an alternate facial expression, which is fine since you can't see much of his expressions due to his mask anyway. here's a look at dr. doom and nova without their headgear. some say that doom's face looks too cartoony, but i think it looks fine. nova is wearing stylish goggles as a way of explaining his white eyes. it's a far better explanation than the bat-sweatband. they did the same thing with the masked wolverine later. here are all the figs with their accessories. jjj comes with a camera so that he can take "more pictures of spider-man!" beetle comes with one of those overused adu guns which is a very poor representation of his wrist-mounted blasters. i hate to say it, but even those bulky new stud shooters would have been a better representation of his weapons. spidey comes with his usual string of webbing and nova comes with some iron man style translucent studs. the weird thing is that they are red while his powers have a blue glow in the show. doctor doom sadly doesn't get any accessories, but who needs weapons when you have a jet with a claw and flick-fire missiles. the build the first bag contains spider-man, a brick separator, and the parts to build the ground floor of the dbc building. after a quick and straight-forward build, you get this. the dumpster and street lamp are separate from the building and since the lamp post is not built onto any baseplate and is quite top-heavy, it gets knocked over pretty easily. maybe it's meant to be that way, but i would have preferred it if you could stick it onto the baseplate of the building on which there is unfortunately not enough space to do so. as you would expect, the second bag has the parts for the first floor of the building. this is also the bag that contains beetle. after another fairly simple build, you'll find yourself with a two story building with a spiderweb one side and a fire escape on the other. however, you have to apply three stickers during this section of the build which is never fun. can you guess what's in bag number 3? yup, the second floor of the building. you don't need superpowers to predict that one. also, this bag contains nova and jameson. the build of this section is a bit repetitive since the second floor is mostly the same as the first and it takes slightly longer to build since you have to build the rooftop as well. also, in addition to the two window stickers you have to apply ten 2x2 tile stickers! trying to do this without having any of them being crooked is a real pain in the megablocks. the next bag contains doctor doom and the cockpit of his jet. doom's cape is in the usual square white box and the string for the claw is folded up in a piece of tape. here's what you get at the end of this section. looks more like an escape pod than a jet at this point. the final bag is the smallest as it only includes the few parts needed to finish the doom jet. once you build the wings and tail, you stick them onto the cockpit via technic pins and you're done. spare parts these are the parts that are left over after the build. there is the brick separator of course, an extra antenna, and the usual little bits and bops. what's really awesome, though, is that they give you an extra pair of beetle's wings! considering what a neat piece this is and that this is the only set in which it comes in trans-black make this a very welcome spare that you can use in your customs. the finished set here is the complete set. the dbc building looks quite tall, especially when you count the antenna. comparing it to a screenshot from the episode, the general look of the building is there, although there are some inaccuracies. aside from the fact that it is obviously way down-scaled, the screens that show jjj ranting about spider-man should have been hexagonal, not square, and should have wrapped around the building. however, considering how many stickers you would have had to apply if they would have made it accurate, i'm actually glad they kept the screen mercifully small. much like doctor doom himself, the doom jet didn't actually appear in the beetle mania episode. however, it did appear in a later episode titled "not a toy" in which spider-man plays around with captain america's shield, accidentally drops it in doctor doom's latvarian embassy and has to try to retrieve it. and yes, that episode was as godawful as it sounds. here's a screenshot of the jet from that episode. like with the dbc, they managed to capture the general shape of the vehicle, although it doesn't look quite as good as in the show. the color scheme is too dark and it looks kind of blockier. let's take a closer look at the jet. there is no real way to reel the claw in unfortunately. however, there is a stud on the back of the jet that you can stick it onto. needless to say, this is not the ideal way of storing it. i would have much preferred it if they would have attached it onto winch instead. the engines on the wings can be turned, even though they don't turn in the show, and there is a flick-fire missile on each side. even if it's not much to look at, at least it's a very swooshable vehicle. on top of each wing there is a tile with the emblem of latvaria. there was no such emplems on the jet in the cartoon, but they are useful pieces that make it clear whose jet it is, so i'm glad they included them. there is nothing inside the cockpit except for a seat and unless you want to ruin dr. doom's nice dark green cape, i wouldn't put him inside of it. they could have at least printed a control panel onto that empty 2x2 tile. play features since this is a playset, let's look at all the play features it has to offer. like all playsets, the building is open in the back so you can play inside. on the ground floor, there is a potted plant and... nothing else. seriously? is this all they could come up with for this floor? they could have included a security desk, a lounge, a second plant, or anything else! as it is, it's just a boring empty lobby. the first floor is a bit more interesting. there is a safe, a swiveling chair, and a pin board with various pictures of spider-man. there is one tile that reads: "the true identity of spider-man" which is supposedly what the villains are after. i wonder how jameson got this information in the first place. speaking of jameson, the second floor is devoted to his office where he can sit and yell at his non-present employees, demanding "more pictures of spider-man!" it also has a swiveling chair as well as a desk with a lamp and a computer. there is a technic beam connecting his desk with the ceiling of the first floor which you can remove in order to take off the upper half of the building, but it's difficult to do, so i don't recommend it. as you may have noticed in the picture above, there are a few red pegs sticking out of the building. these are for triggering the play features. most of them are on the roof. there is one on what looks like an air conditioning unit. if you place spider-man holding is web-string on the jumper plate in front of it and push the peg, spidey goes bungee-jumping off the building. wee! there is also one that sticks out of the side of the building which when pulled triggers a trap door. the third red peg on the roof can be used to pop off the dbc sign. why is it called the dbc, you ask? it stands for daily bugle communications since in this version of spider-man, the daily bugle is not only a newspaper, but a news tv station as well, one that promotes its own highly biased views. so basically the fox news of the marvel universe. i guess if you're an old school spider-man fan, you could just leave off the "c" and have it just stand for daily bugle. the sign above the main entrance wont be so easily modified however. there is also a peg between the first and second floor which when pushed pops out one of the windows on the first floor. the safe is only attached to a couple of jumper plates and has some jumper plates on top of it as well, so you can easily attach the doom jet's claw to it and rip it out of the building as seen on the back of the box. there are also some snot bricks on the corners of the building that you can attach spiderwebs or spidey himself onto for some wall-crawling and webslinging action. this is not so much a play feature as it is just a feature, but as i mentioned earlier, there is a fire escape on the left side of the building. this was a neat idea as it helps it feel like a building in new york city, but it is executed very poorly. there is no hole big enough for the minifigs to climb down through, so they would have to climb down the ladders from the outside which makes no sense. no wonder spider-man always needs to rescue people from burning buildings. there is one more play feature in the form of the dumpster. you can open the lid, put a minifig inside, and make them jump by hitting a tab in the back. remember, this is before the introduction of super jumpers, but nevertheless it's a pretty strange place to launch minifigs out of. i guess even super heroes like to do some dumpster diving. you don't think this was funny? no? well, me neither, but that's the type of humor that this show loves to use. sigh. anyway, let's get on to the ratings. ratings design: 2/5 - the set looks ok. despite many inaccuracies, the dbc building and the jet somewhat resemble their on-screen counterparts and don't look too bad, but they definitely could be better. build: 1/5 - a mostly unchallenging and repetitive build with an attrocious amount of stickers. minifigs: 4/5 - definitely the strongest point of the set. some of the figs could be better, but four out of five of them are exclusive to this set. doctor doom is easily the best and probably the most desirable one - unless the fant4stic movie portraits him so badly that nobody will be interested in him, but that's impossible. playability: 4/5 - as you would expect from a playset, the playability is quite high, although i still feel like there could have been more. parts: 3/5 - not many rare parts. if you're looking for parts for building your own skyscraper with tan walls and lots of doors and windows though, this set is for you. price: 3/5 - at 476 parts for $50, this set is a bit pricey, but it is somewhat justified by all the large window and wall pieces. overall: 3/5 - this set is mediocre at best. playsets are always a good choice for spider-man sets since they give spidey something to swing from, but unfortunately they are rarely pulled off well. the jet is blocky, the building is bare-bones, and the price feels too high. the only reason to get this set are the four exclusive minifigs. this set was discontinued early this year, but if you still see it on clearance somewhere, go ahead and get one for the minifigs and parts, or buy multiples and use the parts to build a better dbc building. i hope you enjoyed this review. it is part of the reviewers academy's 7th anniversary. we're not doing a big celebration this year due to other commitments, but look out for more reviews with the 7th anniversary banner soon. now, if you'll excuse me, i am off to see fant4stic. i hope it's as fantastic as it promises to be! (2 hours later) i was wrong! i was horribly, horribly wrong!

1 this is my favourite set! should be making more spidey sets like this imo. *cough* oscorp tower *cough*

1 yeah. i'm really hoping the concept art/doom minifig joke is just that! i picked this set up on whim, mostly because a needed a building to add to a moc, as a parts pack it's not a bad set at all.

0 thanks for the review, i've had that set for quite a while, and it's among my favorite marvel superheroes sets actually. compared to the other stuff we usually get to accompany the minifigs... all those "laboratorys", the most recent construction site, and the "hydra fortress" .. yeah... you're being a little harsh here maybe you're still suffering from ptsd after watching fant-four-stic!

0 aegis2000, on 13 september 2015 - 02:32 am, said: this set is from 2013, doctor doom is completely based off the comic version/ tv show version, not the movie in any way. anyways, nice review. i personally own this set, and it's a nice set, but could have been better. he's just joking about doom.

0 i actually am surprised at the poor points this set has gotten, as this is one of my favorite sets that marvel has put out. i actually would like to hear what your thoughts are on the usm - lego dr. doom comparison, oky. thanks for the review. http://marvelanimate...or_doom_usm.png edited by zorglorfian, 14 september 2015 - 06:44 am.

0 thanks everyone! darthbrickus, on 13 september 2015 - 02:53 pm, said: thanks for the review, i've had that set for quite a while, and it's among my favorite marvel superheroes sets actually. compared to the other stuff we usually get to accompany the minifigs... all those "laboratorys", the most recent construction site, and the "hydra fortress" .. yeah... you're being a little harsh here perhaps you're right, maybe i was a bit too harsh on this set. don't get me wrong, it's not a bad set, especially compared to some other sets we have gotten in this price range, but somehow i was still expecting more. darthbrickus, on 13 september 2015 - 02:53 pm, said: maybe you're still suffering from ptsd after watching fant-four-stic! i still have not seen it actually (and i don't ever plan to). so don't worry, no okys were harmed in the making of this review. im a brickmaster., on 13 september 2015 - 03:55 am, said: yeah. i'm really hoping the concept art/doom minifig joke is just that! yes, the whole doctor doom/fant4stic thing was obviously a joke. everybody knows what doctor doom is supposed to look like, except for the makers of fant4stic apparently. zorglorfian, on 14 september 2015 - 06:44 am, said: i actually would like to hear what your thoughts are on the usm - lego dr. doom comparison, oky. thanks for the review. http://marvelanimate...or_doom_usm.png there's not much to say really. doom in usm looks just like he does in the comics, and lego recreated that look perfectly. again, he's definitely the best part of this set.

0 i'm glad you were joking about doom. i'm not that big of a fanboy, but i had the need to correct you for some reason. with that said, i bought this set for the minifigures a few years ago. looking back, i don't really care about the figures today like i did in 2013. the building is decent for the size of the set though. thanks for the review.

0 overall, i wish marvel in particular would have more playsets in its theme (batman has several great ones in the dc theme). but then again, if this is the best playset to date for marvel, maybe it's better just to leave well enough alone. i would definitely like to see them attempt something in the $100+ (us) price range because i think it could be good; marvel needs an equivalent to the arkham asylum set. regarding this set, i saved myself some money and bought the 4 minifigs i needed (all but spidey) on bricklink for less than half the set price. edited by dmarvin, 17 september 2015 - 06:25 pm.

0 personally, i thought your review was spot on and i very much enjoyed your tone. i'm not usually much of a mini-fig person, but i will admit i bought this set mostly for dr. doom (and considered nova a bonus). growing up, i was a big fan of the fantastic four and an even bigger fan of dr doom. i hope that someday the film rights will revert to marvel and we'll finally get a ff film that respects the original source material and features a dr doom worthy of the name. as for the set itself, i don't have much use for playsets (not that there's anything wrong with them, i think the marvel lego line could use more of them in fact) and i didn't even realize it was linked to a specific show as i've fallen a bit out of touch with the franchise of late. i bought it; i built it; it sat a shelf for a while; i scrapped it for parts. i think most of it wound up as a greenhouse for my winter village set-up. it's not a _bad_ set, but i think you summed things up nicely when you called it mediocre. thanks for the entertaining review.

1 thanks for the review.i'm not a big fan of spider man sets, but this set really impressed me. this must because of the design of this set and the minifigures that included in this set.

1 hi again! they have arrived *wub*! they come dismantled inside the package instead of one piece like the blackhole stormtrooper did. they have the head and sw-sign made with magnets to clip on to the torso. it actually works even if it feels a bit "cheapish". here?s some pictures - mr vader goes first *vader*: package pieces stormie: package pieces my collection so far >:-) : here?s the blackhole stormtrooper review. boba fett & luke maquette on copmike

1 ooh, i want one. i don't care which but i want one. perhaps *vader* ... thanks for the pics.

1 hello everyone! by now many excited lego star wars fans have started receiving their ucs falcon. some of us here enjoy writing reviews and sharing our thoughts. i mentioned to yoda that i was planning on doing a review of this set but it would likely take me a few weeks (of 1-2 hours per night) to finish building the set. yoda suggested that i do the review as i go so everyone could see the progress of the set. what a great idea! so, here is the first entry. feel free to comment along the way. i will try to post photos and updates every night on the build then wrap up the review when i complete the set. if you have any specific questions or photo requests, please be sure to ask. ucs millennium falcon reviewed by dunamis set 10179 5195 pieces $499.95 from lego shop at home the box: obviously, this is a box like no other. first of all, it comes in its own shipping carton. inside of that, there is a standard lego carton. finally, inside the lego carton, we have the actual millennium falcon box and a nice little letter thanking you for buying the biggest lego set ever. shipping box (naboo set provided for scale) lego carton and letter lego carton the millennium falcon box is really quite nice. there are lots of photos and it does a good job of ?selling? the set. there are 8 individual pieces of tape that keep the lid on the box. the limited first edition comes with a seal on the lower left corner. millennium falcon box (naboo set provided for scale) lifting the lid straight up reveals one compartment of several bags on the right. on the left, we find a thin, square box (like a pizza box) that contains the official certificate of authenticity, two sticker sheets and one enormous manual! under the pizza box, we find two more compartments each filled with several typical lego bags. the box weighs 24 pounds! stickers pizza box pieces in compartments not quite sure what the little 30th anniversary sticker is for yet. the certificate of authenticity is on heavy paper and is suitable for framing. more to come tomorrow. it's late here.

1 nice review. i'll be watching and waiting for the rest.

1 excellent beginning. our numbers are very close, but i haven't the luxury of space to build it, so i'll be enjoying it by proxy through you. enjoy! *y*

0 xwingyoda, on sep 27 2007, 11:18 am, said: what what what >:-( have you stopped your medication once again x-d no actually i?m out of fly agaric. but now it?s that seasson to go out in the forest and refill the stock of those babys. vikings on!!

0 wow that box is big but i somehow thought it would be even bigger, still it looks like for once lego are actully using all the space inside and not just a fraction like with other sets. cant wait to see more dunamis.....you lucky megablok ;-)

1 what a wonderful idea, and how nice from you.... *sweet* and.... go, killer, go!!

1 thats awesome man! lucky that you got it! i want it so badly... and it has a huge box too! -zots

0 xwingyoda, on sep 27 2007, 09:18 am, said: many tks dunamis for doing that, its really great and i can't wait monitoring your progress on the beast 8-? like it was mentionned in another thread, the box looks less gigantic than i thought - remember the isd box !! that was a huge box !! is the instruction book in the pizza box ? how big is it ? i'm sure its really big and i hope for our sake that the colours are clearly marked x-d if you know what i mean :-d !! *yoda* interesting question regarding the size of the box vs. the isd. here ya go: also, i'll be posting more on the size of the manual a little later. i'm going to be building for the next few hours... *sweet*

-1 tks for that comparison pic dunamis ;-) ok the box is big !! i pictured it a tad smaller though !! i know what i don't like, its the fact that it has the regular lego star wars logo on top with vader. ucs sets should have a different iconography like they did in the past. sure its a trivial detail but it adds to the fact of owning something special !! after all its the most expensive set ever as of now ;-) happy building !! and we'll wait patiently for some cool pics later on :-p *yoda*

1 good review. *y* me, i can't build it before saturday. :'-(

1 the build: the build is going quicker than i thought. i am sorting as i open the bags that i need. some bags are in multiples so it is easy to pick them out. the build is a tad repetitive as the framework of the ship is somewhat symmetrical. here are some progress shots: note that two plates (1x4 and 1x8) are stacked in between technic beams. then the part below is assembled to hold the structure together. this took about an hour of sorting and building: i'll post another update tomorrow.

0 the minifigs: as you can see, the minifigs are really nice. they even throw in an extra fleshie head! no doubt these will fetch quite a bit on the bricklink and ebay markets. i?m keeping mine. continuing the build this photo shows how well this model is put together. notice that they use four of the three-hole beams per side to hold this together. i remember reading that you can hang this model from the ceiling. i don?t doubt it. these right angle technic pieces are used to reinforce the structure of the model. you can see them used here: i was shocked at how many light gray plates are in this set. i have two tubs full of these: the infrastructure is now complete: i got hung up for about an hour looking for one of these: turns out, lego gave me an extra left wedge and shorted me a right wedge. so frustrating! i had to stead one off my 6211 star destroyer. it is not a very common piece by the way?

0 xwingyoda, on sep 30 2007, 11:57 am, said: are these yellow parts new ? i am not a technic fan and never saw these before. you don?t have the building crane 7905 either? same color, same shape there: piece no. 32555 (four of them included) i assume you?re not a town fan? :-p ;-)

1 i have been taking photos for this review for a few months and i finally took the rest of the photos last night. all the parts. if you want tan, this is the set to get! main model. the garage is a great addition... ...but the car only just fits! the main house is very nice looking. the windows extend to the sides... ...but not the back. the chimney and drainage work very well, and i love the "basement". i think the front works very well. when i was making this i was multitasking doing weight training; do a set, do a step, do a set... and i ended up missing one of the row paths. i discovered this after i finished the basement. :-| the removable roof reveals byo floors. probably why this is called a model house! the roof was quite interesting to build. this is my first large house set so it all was very new to me. i love the garage door. more nice pipework. this photo i mis-focused but there isn't much to see anyway! the door is a nice touch. the grill to the right on both sides is not just decoration as it hides the hinges for the door. i also made one of the sub-models. i was considering keeping this but i decided against it. once again the sides have windows... but the back doesn't. the truck is there to make the photo more worthwhile! the roof to this one doesn't come off easily as all the tiles are used for the front. just to clarify; these houses aren't attached so you can arrange them however you want. the fronts are quite elaborate and it seems that lego were trying to make this almost like a simpler market street. the truck is too small for a minifig... ...but it probably was my favourite car. thoughts i highly recommend this set. in most countries it is good value for money, including australia. the design is excellent and three instructions are included. (the third is a school. if anyone has made it and wants to post photos feel free! at least one person at eb has made it.) i love how each house has its own car. due to the way the primary model is made it is a bit weak at the corner, but that was a design choice. my only real complaint about this set is how lego is going though a mould transition and thus some roof slopes are rough, others are smooth. i can accept either, and lego has been moving to smooth slopes for years now, but to have a set with about 50/50 is annoying. (the mtt was the same.) but that is my only gripe with this excellent set. *wub*

0 thank you for the review sinner. at first i wanted this set for the 4 blue 1x1 slope tiles, but i can see there is much more into it than that. it sure is a great value compared to what you get in the building bonanzas (no cars and less detail). it was funny to see the little side story in your pictures. would it be hard to modify the cars to fit minifigs better?

1 a beautiful and humorous review with very fine pics. *y* a fantastic set, full of neat details and in a wonderful color scheme. great for every city builder for sure. i guess we waited for sets like that. we dreamed about them. i?m glad we got them now. :'-) edit: congrats! it seems you?ve got your bucket back.... :-p

0 i found the use of parts well done by the designers. i made a car and then tried to make a house from a different instruction book. i could not as several pieces were already used in the car. nice to see them using all the parts like that rather than having a lot of "extra" bits. moral of the story: one instruction book at a time. *sweet*

1 excellent review with great pics and cameo appearances by some of our eb favs *y* definitely a set that was on my 'to get' list already, and this only confirms that. might make me want two, just because i love tan so much and i'd like to see if something could be done to bulk up that car. great job as always! :-)

1 thank you very much for the review sinner. i definitly *wub* this set. this will make a great addition for us "townies". i thought the size was too small. i plan to make my house fit practically the whole baseplate. plus i will definitly add floors, that looked :-d . i can't believe tlc skimped on the floors.

1 thanks for this review sinner! i love this house, with the nicely made tiled corners, the colorscheme and the garage. the only thing i dislike about this set is the way the windows are attached in train windows (so they turn inwards a little) instead of the usual frames with shutter-attachment-ability. but that is something that can be fixed in the blink of an eye. i will certainly buy this house some day when i find it at reasonable price.

1 thanks for the review sinner! *y* ... although we had a not very detailed one already... :-p i bought this set at tru with 20% off resulting in 54?. x-d definitely a must buy for every townie. you get tons of useful parts to build other buildings as well. [shameless self-promotion /off] ;-) you have to love tan bricks though. 8-| moc on!

1 thanks for the review sinner! i definitely want this set now. the mixed rough and smooth roof bricks would annoy me on a model like the mtt, but here it looks as is if the roof is quite old with some parts being worn and pitted and some parts being replaced with new roof tiles. i quite like the effect. i agree on which is the best vehicle, and if it doesn't fit minifigs, just mod the heck out of it! x-d

0 thanks for the thanks guys! *sweet* hinckley39, on sep 28 2007, 11:08 am, said: great job, now sort that out and start building for our competition! x-d i started building today! *sweet* matthewusa, on sep 28 2007, 03:56 pm, said: i can't believe tlc skimped on the floors. it didn't bother me as i downloaded the instructions prior to buying the set. i think it was a deliberate choice to make the house flashy looking but not very functional. due to the cool looking corners it isn't very strong either; while breaking it i was reminded of a zip! :-p simonwillems, on sep 28 2007, 06:53 pm, said: the only thing i dislike about this set is the way the windows are attached in train windows (so they turn inwards a little) instead of the usual frames with shutter-attachment-ability. these were my first windows like that and it surprised me. i wouldn't be surprised if lego are trying to phase out the old windows. holodoc, on sep 28 2007, 07:58 pm, said: thanks for the review sinner! *y* ... although we had a not very detailed one already... :-p i notice that, but since didn't show what the original set looked like i saw that more of a moc. 8-| holodoc, on sep 28 2007, 07:58 pm, said: you get tons of useful parts to build other buildings as well.

1 sweet! looks like an awesome set. i might get it, i have to see. looks like it has a lot of good parts. -zots

1 thank you for the nice review. i want this set too with al those tan bricks and black slopes and the cute blue car *wub* i like the old windows more, i hope they don't stop producing them

1 nice pictorial review, i always like this little set ! a little more text would have been nice but that is ok as it is . ps: you should have mentioned in the title that this topic is picture heavy - i was wondering why it was loading so slow on my mobile

0 hi, you've done well on the pictures! but i agree with freekysch; a little more text would be great. ever thought about joining the reviewer's academy?

1 i actually bought this set last monday as it was reduced to 14.99.....it actually not a bad little set considering the size and part count, has a decent array of functions. its a nice little set....the b model looks just as good so i might buy a second set, as you get the bucket left over and i need that bucket for another set. edited by richard dower, 19 october 2015 - 04:42 pm.

1 remember when i said in my review of 7090 to expect a review after i went to toysrus? well, somehow things didn?t work out, but fortunately i?m finally reviewing my latest purchases, starting with 7091 catapault defense, which happens to be one of the best sets in the castle line. the box and instructions: lego box art is at it?s highest point ever these days, with lots of special effects and great action poses. the castle theme is no exception, and 7091 isn?t either. i?ll let the box speak for itself: i love the back of the castle boxes as well, since they give another action scene and other neat info like a layout of all the accessories. the contents: only the bare essentials as usual: piece bags and instructions. i seriously wish they still put mini catalogs inside sets like they did when i was young, but i guess they are too expensive to make or something. ah well, can?t have everything. no picture of the instructions this time, but since that isn?t necessary i?ll just say that they are fine, and do not have a problem with distinguishing dark gray from black. the pieces: here?s your basic shot of every piece included, minus a few extra pieces like an extra viking horn and black skeleton leg. not too shabby for a 10 usd set. there?s a lot of nice pieces in 7091, as you can see (and this doesn?t include the accessories or minifig parts!). the brown plates, wheels, and spoked things are always useful, and the dark blue and gold slopes are really cool. however, there?s also a fair amount of technic in here, so be warry. as usual for the castle line, 7091 has a heaping helping of accessories. most of them are old pieces recolored, but the ball on chain (what?s the actual name, could someone tell me?) and the shields are brand new. i actually like the new skeleton weapon, since it?s fairly detailed and was really the only way tlc could make a part like that. and yes, the shields are printed (quite nicely too, if i do say so myself). plus, you get viking horns (always useful to have), a grey boulder, a basket, and 3 helmets. not a half bad deal, eh? oh, who am i kidding ? it?s awesome! minifigures: ah yes, one of the highlights of any castle set. you get 2 soldiers and 2 skellies this time, all with different weapons. the two soldiers are just regular crown troops with different faces ? nothing special, except that they are awesome anyway. the skeletons on the other hand are much more interesting: an archer and a black skellie! archers cool, of course, but i know many don?t like the printing on the black skeletons. well, let me say that i don?t mind it so much. the only real problem is that the eyes are dark red instead of just red, which makes the printing a bit less noticeable. and i?ve been through it before that the new skeleton molds in general don?t bother me at all ? go skeletons! the finished set: alright, there?s two builds in this set, and i?ll start with the smaller: the skeleton barricade. okay, so it?s nothing special, but it?s cool all the less. the shield on the front and the slanted spears are nice touches. here?s just how the skeletons can tower over their own barricade: with a little step. ah, the catapault. the lovely catapault. seriously, i love tlc?s design. very effective, and also very realistic, especially compared to kk. love the side details and the swiveling base, and you gotta love the clever use of that basket. playability: yes, i?ve made it a tradition now to write stories for any castle set i buy (and this isn?t the last one, you can be sure of that!). here?s one featuring everything in 7901: oh, and here?s a small ship i made out of all the pieces in this set plus a couple extra figures and weapons from my copy of 7901. not half bad, imo, considering what i had to work with. overall rating: presentation: 9/10 pieces: 8/10 minifigures: 9/10 finished model: 9/10 playability: 8/10 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ final score: 8.6/10 once again, i highly recommend the reviewed set. castle is possibly the best theme this year, and this set is one of many that prove it. as with all castle sets, it?s best if you buy several if you want to truly enjoy it, but this set alone is also impressive in both design and pieces and minifigures. get at least one if you have even a slight liking for castle. edited by kimt, 10 august 2008 - 01:31 pm.

1 very nice review! seems like i'll be getting my first castle set soon.. *wub* grevious, on oct 10 2007, 09:33 pm, said: most of them are old pieces recolored, but the ball on chain (whats the actual name, could someone tell me?) that would be a flail. ;-)

1 wow thanks for the review! 8-? i already have the other two set (theyre fantastic *wub* ) and i know ill be getting this one soon! dp8

1 very nice review! i like the amount of pics and that alternate model. i wouldn't have thought of making a ship from those parts, i once made a larger, crownie-ized skellie barrier instead.

1 the pictures really tell all, nice review grevious! i especially liked the story, great sense of humor!

1 thanks for this nice review. nice comics presentation, too. *sweet* makes me want to get some new castle sets even harder, now. :-$

1 great review grevious!! *sweet* *y* nice job, thanks for sharing. great comic and i especially love that you gave us an alternative model, something lego neglects to do anymore... |-/ thanks again! *wub*

1 that's a superb review if i ever saw one, and another great story! *y* it's a good review even though i got the set 4 months ago. :-p this just reinforces my like for it. :-p

1 thanks for the review, the comic was great! :-d your alternate model is great as well, i would never have thought of building a ship out of a catapult! :-p

1 great review, this is one of my favorite sets from the new castle line. it's simple and yet so effective, oh and great comic you have there *y*

1 thanks everyone for all the comments! ;-) my next review is most likely going to be the toa mahri i bought a long time ago; i also typed up a review for her but haven't bothered posting it! ah well, i'll get it up eventually.... x-d edit: gah! i just realized how many posts i had! better post something else on the boards quickly.... :-p edited by grevious, 11 october 2007 - 08:45 pm.

1 lol what a review!!! i love the story ^_^

1 nice review, i like this set alot. *y* :-)

1 great review! *sweet* i wasn't aware that the catapult rotated either... this set isn't on my buy list though as it is all more of the same for me. thanks for the cool moc! :-d i always plan to add a moc to my reviews but i always run out of time.... :'-(

1 i just got this today. it is amazing like my other two castle sets: the joust and the crossbow. i am currently starting to save for 2008 but for christmas i think i want the skeleton carridge and the naboo n-1 fighter.

1 it's that time of year again when the days get shorter, the nights get colder, and children all around the world stare longingly into warmly lit toy shops and prepare their wishlist to send to santa. this is also the time when the lego group releases their latest winter village set which has been an annual tradition for the past seven years. these sets have been very popular, especially among afols, and are always highly anticipated. however, while some entries in this series have been more popular than others, none has been as controversial as this year's set, the winter toy shop, which is a re-release of the first winter village set, 10199 winter toy shop from 2009. it seems that many think that this set didn't need to be remade and would have preferred a new set instead, or that it is not different enough from the original and will be redundant in a completionist's collection. does it deserve all the hate? let's find out. disclaimer: i don't own the 2009 version, so i can't compare them visually, but i will do my best to let you know what is different in this version. if you do need a visual reference, you can refer to svelte's excellent review of the original. set number: 10249 name: winter toy shop theme: creator year of release: 2015 pieces: 898 minifigs: 8 price: 59.99 / $79.99 / 69.99 s@h description: quote welcome to the winter toy shop! the holiday season has arrived and the toymaker is busy finishing off his latest creations! outside, children ski and snowboard, and a freshly built snowman sparkles in the light that shines from the toyshop tower. help decorate the huge tree that stands at the center of the square, play with the curious kitten on the cozy wooden bench or join in with the carolers beneath the ornate streetlamp. this charming set also features a ladder, trees in various sizes, jack-in-the-box, a toy biplane, helicopter, rocket, train, race car, truck, robot, tugboat, teddy bear and a wrapped gift. have fun building this enchanting winter wonderland! includes a snowman and 8 minifigures with assorted accessories: a male caroler, female caroler, a woman, 2 men, 2 boys and a girl. s@h bricklink brickset the box the box art of this set is similar to that of the original, but there are some notable differences. the christmas tree is on the right side of the image this time while the park bench is on the left and of course it features this year's design for creator boxes with the dark blue stripe along the right side and the "expert" logo in the top right corner. there's also a small picture of the back of the toy shop and the background looks less cartoony than on the original. the back is also very similar, showing a different angle of the toy shop along with some close-ups, although this time there is no minifig lineup. instead, the minifig lineup is on the right side of the box. it also includes the accessories that each minifig comes with and some of the toys. on the left side of the box there is a thumbnail of the box art and the set name in six different languages. they also want to make sure that you know that there are batteries included by saying it in dozens of languages. the top of the box features the inventory and a 1:1 scale reference with the female caroler. on the bottom there is a picture that reminds you that there is a light brick included in this set, in case that wasn't clear from the front of the box, and it confirms that yes, it is a bad idea to put it in water, in case you were planning to go swimming with your winter toy shop. the contents inside the box there are two instruction booklets and two groups of bags, one for each instruction booklet. while two groups of bags is not as many as there usually are in other sets of this size, it's still better than the first version of this set where the bags weren't numbered at all, so this makes the build a bit easier. the large bag in group 1 and the two large bags in group 2 have a white stripe going down the middle of the bag and only have one group number printed on it along with some other number and some kind of scan code. i have no idea why they made this distinction for these bags or what that code is for, so if any of you know the purpose of this, please let me know in the comments below. here is a random instructions page. as you can see, the building steps can get quite challenging as they sometimes include many different pieces in one step, especially when it uses a lot of brown pieces which are very dark and hard to see in the instructions, living up to the set's status as an expert-level set. most of the time, though, the instructions are pretty clear and easy enough to follow. there are some parts in new colors in this set that weren't in the first version or any other set until now, such as that large, flat technic arch in dark green, the jester hat in orange and blue, one of those new 2z2 round jumper tiles in brown, a golden frog(!), and a snowboard in dark blue. there are also some rare friends parts that make their creator debut here such as the skis in azure and that new clear 1x1 round tile with a tiny tube coming out of it which is usually used as a stand for friends accessories and is a very useful piece, especially for snot techniques (and no, i'm not talking about the type of snot that many people usually have stuck in their nose around this time of year). there are some printed parts as well, such as the clock tile, the letter tile, and the register slope like in the first version of the set. we also get a new face print for the white cat which is more in line with other modern cat designs. but the best part is the shop sign which is printed this time around. it features a lovely wood pattern, the words "toy shop", and a toy soldier on both sides of the sign. which is ironic since the shop doesn't seem to sell any toy soldiers like this, but it looks so good on the sign that i won't sue them for false advertising. the minifigs let's start with the most unique figures in this set, the carolers. these two were also the highlight in the first version of the set, but in the original they both had the same head (this one -> ) which featured a very questionable facial expression that could easily be taken out of context. in this version, they have unique faces which look much better and help distinguish their gender. the male caroler uses lord vampyre's torso which looks quite snazzy on him. maybe this is lord vampyre before he became a vampire? the female caroler is easily the best minifig in the set, though, because in addition to her exclusive head, she also gets an exclusive torso and skirt print! a huge improvement over the generic unprinted one in the original. she also gets the queen hair in dark brown and aragorn's lined cape instead of two combined regular capes. this set truly is the return of the queen! the snowman is technically not a minifig, but as you can see here, he is exactly as tall as one and he is the first thing you build after the minifigs, so i included him here. he has mostly the same design as before, except this time he has robot claws for arms instead of levers. which is good since they allow him to hold accessories such as his broom. his carrot nose is included separately again. the carolers both have back printing while the snowman looks no different from the back than he does from the front. here you can see the black side of the female's cape. this lined cape is so much nicer than the solution they used in the original. next up we have what i assume is a married couple who are likely the parents of at least one of the kids, as well as the toymaker who i will call geppetto. the man in the pinstripe suit was not included in the first version of the set, so he's a bonus minifig! these guys are fairly generic, but they have some detailed torso prints, so they look pretty nice. geppetto seems to have gotten younger since the release of the original set since his gray hair has now turned dark tan and he doesn't seem to need glasses anymore. the men both have back printing, but the woman is the only one in this set who doesn't get a back print. why you gotta be so discriminating against women, lego?! last but not least, there are the kids. one of the boys wears dark blue pants, a green jacket, and a wool cap. he looks a bit like a lumberjack, so let's call him lumberjack boy, or jack for short. the little girl wears an outfit that wouldn't look out of place in the friends theme with a lavender scarf and pants. i'll call her lavender. the second boy is wearing an octan jacket and a sports helmet which makes it ironic that he is the one not doing any winter sports on the box art. i'll call him president business junior, or pbj for short. all of the kids have fairly detailed back printing which makes up for the fact that much like the adults, they are made out of mostly common parts. pbj's helmet and scarf cover up the back of his head nicely which is important as you will see in the next picture. what's also great about these figs is that half of them have a double-sided head. here you can see pbj doing his best macaulay culkin impression. i also removed his scarf so you can see the printing on his torso better. but he's not the only one who seems to be easily scared. the mother also has a very alarmed expression. maybe she got surprised by the jack-in-the-box or maybe she just realized how expensive toys are nowadays. you can see the female caroler's back printing here. her alternate expression is a non-singing face which is very nice to have and i wish the male caroler could have one too. she looks quite cute with those rosy cheeks. but the most adorable out of all of them has to be the little girl. she comes with a pouting sad face that will melt your heart. please, don't cry! i'll buy you any toy you want, just stop looking at me like that! the build the first half of the build is dedicated to the surroundings of the toy shop. it includes the christmas tree, the park bench, the snowman, the toys, the carolers, jack and lavender. the large bag contains two smaller bags with small pieces, a white box that contains the caroler's cape, and the jester hat in its own little bag. the first thing you build after the minifigs and the snowman is the toys. this version of the set has a lot more toys than the original which is good because i always felt that the first toy shop was a bit light on toys. also, the ones that were in the original have been updated. for example, instead of the two pairs of skis, you now get one pair of skis that use the new ski mold and a snowboard. the jack-in-the-box is mostly the same, except it now has an orange and blue color scheme instead of the red and blue from the original. this change was probably not necessary, but hey, at least we get a new jester hat out of it. and instead of the brick-built teddy bear you get the new teddy bear mold. i have mixed feelings about this change because i actually kinda liked the brick-built teddy design and using a specialized mold seems to be going against the spirit of creator sets, but on the other hand i can't deny that the molded teddy looks better than the blocky old one. meh. the new toys include a tugboat which has some rounded technic pieces as its hull, a biplane, a rocket, a helicopter, and a truck that cleverly uses roller skates for its wheels. these are all quite brilliant designs that feel like micro versions of lego city sets and make a great addition to the set. here is a back view of some of the more complex models. as you can see, the friends accessory stand has been cleverly used to hold the biplane's fin in place and to provide a stand for the helicopter. the jack-in-the-box has a hinged lid. the only thing that bugs me a bit is the t-piece on top of the helicopter that holds the rotor in place, but i can't think of any better way they could have done it. next is the ladder that is used to decorate the tree which is exactly the same as the first version. the supports are on a click-hinge, so they can be adjusted or folded away. then, you build the tree itself. you begins, of course, with the stand which is mostly the same design as before, but this time the plates at the bottom are brown instead of white and have golden studs as feet. next, you build the first layer of branches. the main difference in this version of the tree is that this one actually has a brown stem rather than just a technic axle on which you stack the layers of branches one by one. you wont be able to see the stem in the final result, but i like this change as it makes the tree more realistic. then you add the second layer of branches. this one doesn't have lights/candles and attaches to the lower layer at an angle using the four trans-yellow studs close to the stem. the third layer is added. this one has lights again. each layer is similar in that they are all made out of green plates that are built around a 4x4 ring plate, but they get smaller each time and are constructed differently enough for the build not to feel repetitive. with the addition of the fourth layer, we get close to finishing the tree. lastly, you add one more layer and the tip of the tree. now it's time to decorate the tree! however, it's not as fun as it sounds since that requires you to add lights to the two chains/ropes first which can get a bit repetitive. the clips holding the lights to the chain were white, but this time they're pearl gold which looks much nicer in my opinion. the next part of the build is the park bench with the streetlamp and the little tree. this is a fairly quick build with not much to it. the fishbowl helmet parts are a useful piece that you don't see too often, so it's nice to get them again in this remake. the design is pretty much the same as in the original set except for the wreaths on the streetlamp which use a green life preserver instead of a round 2x2 plate. this is another instance where they use a specialized piece instead of a brick-built solution, but i'm okay with that because unlike with the teddy bear, this part was not originally intended to be a wreath, so it's still nice part usage. the second half of the build is dedicated to the toy shop itself and includes the couple, geppetto, and pbj. please note that there is a fourth 6x10 plate burried under the parts. you begin by tiling the floor, setting up the walls, and adding the interior items such as the fireplace, the cash register, and the toy displays. next, you add the walls, windows, and the door and the ground floor of the shop is finished. so far, the build is the same as the old toy shop, except this time they decided to have the white stripes on the marquees be the longer ones instead of the dark red ones for some reason. i don't know why they did this and kinda would have preverred to get dark red 1x1 plates instead of white, but it doesn't detract from the look of the shop, so i don't really care. now we begin with the upper floor. this is where things start to look a little different. can you tell the difference? the difference is that this time they attach the roof using clip-hinges instead of bulky technic constructions which gives you more space on this floor and allows it to look more like an actual attic. they even tile the floor next to the frog clock. aftter adding the roof, the build is finished. the main roof feels a bit loose since it's only attached to the building by one side. i'm not sure if this was an issue in the old toy shop, but it's not a big deal. i just wouldn't pick the set up by the roof. what i do like is that they used double cheese slopes on the awning on the outer wall of the tower instead of singles which makes it a bit easier to build. i like how the supports under the tower roof now match those of the main roof. the wreaths have also been updated like the ones on the streetlamp. and those technic arches under the roof look a lot more like garlands now. on the original, they were dark gray, so i didn't even know they were supposed to be garlands and assumed they were part of the architecture. the shop sign looks a lot better now that it is printed. the old one just looked like a white flag. i also like how the small plates under the marquee give it a wavy look and they included two trees in different sizes on the right side of the shop. the back is nice and open and allows you to see the rest of the toys, the robot, train, and race car, all of which have just as much of a simple and clever design as the other toys. the clock looks much nicer with the new golden frog. because golden frogs make everything better. spare parts there are quite a few small parts left over, including a roller skate and one of those friends accessory stands which will come in handy. the complete set here you can see the full set together. it looks quite nice and festive with all the little details and there are many scenes that you can play out with it: you can have the minifigs decorate the tree, have the kids play in the snow, have the carolers sing by the bench, have the toymaker build some toys in his workshop, or have the parents buy presents for their kids. it's a festive, toy-filled winter wonderland! the fireplace looks cozy and i like the brick pattern going up the chimney. the entrance of the shop looks a bit empty aside from the cash register. i feel like they could have displayed some more toys here, but oh well. being a set targeted at teens and adults, there aren't really any play features aside from the light brick which is attached to a hinge, so you can either activate it by pressing the button with your finger or tilting the brick upward so that the button is pressed against the roof. however, since the roof is not connected in the middle and only attached on the sides, it tends to split open a bit when you do that, so i'm not sure if attaching the roof this way here was such a good idea. nevertheless, it looks quite nice when the light is lit. ratings design: 5/5 - this set is as gorgeous as it was back in 2009! the small updates that they made are mostly good ones, although the absence of a brick-built teddy is a bit disappointing and the new way the roof is attached, while not as bulky as before, makes the roof slightly unstable, but those are just nitpicks. build: 5/5 - there are some interesting building techniques here, such as those on the tree, the roof, and the toys. the fact that the parts are only split into two groups and the part callouts can get fairly complex makes it a challenging, enjoyable build. minifigs: 5/5 - they did a great job updating the figs in this set. while only 3 of the torsos in the original had any printing, all of the torsos have printing front and back in this set, even the skirt and cape of the female caroler. you get two exclusive heads and half of the heads are double-sided, plus you get 8 instead of 7 minifigs. you really can't ask for more in a creator set. playability: 4/5 - this set is more meant to be displayed than to be played with, but there are plenty of things to play with if you want. all the different minifigs, accessories, and set pieces make for endless possibilities for play. it's especially fun to swoosh the micro vehicles around. parts: 3/5 - there are lots of good parts here. most of them are fairly common, but there are some rare parts and some even in exclusive colors. price: 4/5 - this set costs $20 more than the original, but considering that this set has nearly 900 pieces, including some rare and exclusive ones, as well as more minifigs with much better printing, i think $80 is still a fair price. overall: 5/5 - so what's my opinion of this set? for a remake, i think it's great. they managed to make a good set even better. are the changes minor? yes. are they an improvement? mostly, yes. were they necessary? perhaps not, but it's good that they made them instead of just re-releasing the exact same set. so if you didn't get the first winter toy shop, i can highly recommend getting this one. if you do already have the old version, this one might still be worth picking up for the hugely improved minifigs and rare parts alone. as for the controversy over re-releasing the winter toy shop, i can see where the haters are coming from, but i find their complaints to be quite petty. i can understand if you're disappointed because you already have the first winter toy shop and were looking forward to a new set this year, but there's always next year. if you're a completist and feel like tlg is forcing you to buy a set you don't need, you're wrong. nobody is forcing you to buy anything but yourself. if you decide to buy every set in a theme no matter what it is, that's your problem, not lego's. so put down your torches and pitchforks and just be glad that they improved the set design and gave us another chance to buy this classic set. there are far worse things that can happen in this world than lego re-releasing one of their most popular sets. sorry for that little rant. so what is your opinion on re-releases like this? please cast your vote in the poll above. i hope you enjoyed this special eurobricks reviewers academy review and would like to thank the lego group for the opportunity to review this set. happy holidays everyone!

1 nice to see they finally updated that generic screaming face from the 2007 castle line. awesome review, oky. i have the old set so i won't be picking this up.

1 great review. you almost make me want to buy one. i don't know what it is with these sets. on the one hand they are so nicely designed and cute on the other side i never seriously consider buying one. i can't explain what it is that holds me back.

0 great review! i just built the original, and this one has clear advantages over the original (though i wish lego would stop putting torsos with defined breasts and curves on children). i really like pretty much every change. i won't be getting it, and i'd be lying if i said i'm not a little disappointed. for the first four years, my mother-in-law got me the new winter village set for christmas; after the last two, which didn't really fit thematically in my display, i had hoped for a new one--particularly since my daughter is getting to be around the age where she can play with them. i mention her specifically because i've seen lots of people dismiss those who are a bit disappointed as rabid adults who don't care about kids getting cool sets, and i don't think that's fair. i may have to see how much some of the parts go for on bricklink. the rerelease is better than the original, but not good enough that i'd want to spend $80 to get a set that's nearly identical to one i have. edited by tea weevil, 29 november 2015 - 04:31 pm.

1 regarding the reason for the different designs on the inner bags, i think that the white stripe is the new version, with the non-stripe version being old. i suspect the reason some sets have both versions is simply that they're still using up some of their supply of older bags. good review. i didn't realise there were quite as many changes as you highlighted (tree, roof etc).

-1 thanks for the excellent review! unfortunately it only highlights how minimal the upgrades are (though they are nice). definitively a pass for me. let's hope lego does continue to make the more realistic winter village sets (versus santa). i'm not opposed to a rehash, the post office could use some improvements for example, but this one is just a wee bit minimal.

1 i missed out on the first one, but i love the improvements made in this version, like the tree having an actual brown trunk so it looks less like an artificial one, and the carolers as well. i may pick this up, but i'm sorry to those of you who already have one.

0 cheers for putting up the review. some nice improvements, but not enough for me to pick it up. the original set is good enough for me. pity the poll has no option "yes, but only in addition to new sets, not in stead of new sets". edited by withacee, 01 december 2015 - 09:38 am.

1 thanks for a nice review. i am building it as we speak, and i like it so far. since i didn't have the old one, i can't complain.

0 thanks for the review. they definitely improved upon the original, but since i already own the original, i can't justify this set also, unfortunately. it seems to be the trend. but i'm sure there are a lot of first timers out there too that will snatch this up since it is a really lovely building. and the updates make it better for sure.

0 thanks oky for this fine review. i agreed with your sentiments on the unnecessary rants. i also owned the 2009 version and even though there are minor improvements. there must be a logical reason for its release again but is not entirely the same. i felt is an excellent opportunity for others to acquire this design especially after six years ago. as for myself, i will probably buy this if my spare funds allow me to own this set.

0 thanks for the kind comments everyone! i like hearing your opinions on this set. withacee, on 01 december 2015 - 09:37 am, said: pity the poll has no option "yes, but only in addition to new sets, not in stead of new sets". i don't think that would be a realistic option as that would mean that they would have to spend twice the resources on this theme which i don't think they are ready to do, but if more people would like this option, i can add it to the poll. joebot, on 01 december 2015 - 08:33 pm, said: after mocking people for holding a particular opinion, you then turn around and ask people to express their opinion?? no thanks. i guess i'll keep my opinions to myself. i certainly don't want to be labeled a "hater." i'm not mocking anyone. i just think that some people need to calm down a bit and that tlg is getting more hate than they deserve for this set, but that's just my opinion and you're welcome to disagree with it. everyone is entitled to their own opinion, including you and me. and yes, i would love to hear your thoughts on this matter because i would like to have a friendly discussion on this subject.

1 i didn't own the original toy shop so i bought it this time around. i just finished building it saturday and i love it! however, i wish they had both re-released this one and came out with a new addition to the village. :)

1 review - 42044 - display team jet introduction the smallest of the 2016 sets, is the display team jet. it doesn't seem to have lots of functionality, but maybe the landing gear is retractable. this set kind of reminds me to the 9394 - jet plane, although it's obviously a lot smaller. as you can read in my review of the 42052 - heavy lift helicopter basically anything flying is +1 for me, so let's find out if this set also fits the bill. note: all images can be clicked for hi-res versions. set information number: 42044 title: display team jet theme: technic released: 2016 part count: 113 box weight: 193 gr box dimensions: 15,4 cm x 13,8 cm x 5,9 cm set price (msrp):  9,99 price per part:  0,088 links: brickset, bricklink the box being a small set, it obviously comes in a small box. the display team jet is an aerobatics jet, used in air shows. on the box it's flying rather high, but at least it's at a safe distance from the crowd. front side shows the main model, together with a small section indicating you can use digital building instructions to build this model. back side the back side shows the b-model, a stunt plane. and again a reference to the apps for digital building instructions. more on the stunt plane later. content of the box the box contains: 2 instructions booklets (a- and b-model) 1 sticker sheet 3 technic liftarms 2 bags instruction booklets both the instructions for the a- and b-model are included in the box. sticker sheet a lot of stickers for such a small set. apparently no panel is left untouched. liftarms three liftarms unsealed, nothing out of the ordinary for a small set. bags two bags containing the rest of the parts. highlighted parts this section describes the new and/or otherwise interesting parts. yellow 5l axles the 5l axle in yellow has never been released before, so it's one of the new parts for this year. black 7l flex axles for the layman this seems a common part, but the 7l soft axle actually has never been released in black before. combined with the re-release of the 19l soft axle in black, this will open up lots of possibilities. for those of you thinking you've read this text before; you are right, the new drag racer contains these new 7l flex axles too. white panels this small set comes with a whopping 10 panels. great for the ones who like panels. not so great if you think tlg is using too much panels lately. rudder this part, the small bionicle wing, is the same as the one used in last year's 42033 - record breaker. part list this set contains 113 parts, all listed below. the build this is the collection of parts, used to build the jet. it sure looks like we are getting a landing gear. the build is fun, but pretty straightforward. there aren't any special or cool techniques used in this set. it almost took me more time to apply all the stickers than to build the actual model. finished model the finished jet does look cool though. the white and yellow color scheme, combined with the stickers, work really well. i have seen people refer to the plane as being orange, but it's definitely yellow. technic (or lego in general) tends to have some color variation when it comes to yellow. i do concur this is the warmer variant of yellow, but it's not orange. the back of the plane looks nice too, although i am not a big fan of the rudder part. it looks too detailed, compared to the other panels. it's not a big deal though, and maybe it's just me. parts left only three common parts left. features and functions this set has a single feature and that is a retractable landing gear. it's operated by the black 12t double bevel gear near the cockpit. in the following picture you can see the landing gear retracted. this image shows the landing gear when the plane is ready for landing. hopefully the pilot will roll the plane before landing, but you probably know what i mean video here's s short video demonstrating the display team jet. b-model this set also includes the building instructions for the b-model, a stunt plane. the building experience for the stunt plane is more or less the same as for the jet. well, what do you expect when both models are planes with a limited number of parts. for an alternative model the stunt plane looks fine. there's not a lot of functionality in this plane, but it's worth mentioning that the tail wheel allows the plane to roll on a flat surface. the plane also has working propellors. both functions are demonstrated in the video. unfortunately, the landing gear of the stunt plane is not retractable. parts left a couple of extra leftover parts, but it's nice to see that most of the parts have been used in the b-model as well. actually, there's probably an extra yellow technic smooth 1/2 bush left. i just found it on my desk, but it could belong to one of the other sets. video here's a video demonstrating the stunt plane. summary two nice planes for 13 bucks, that's basically what you get. both models look good and the set has some interesting new parts. especially the 7l flex axle will be very popular. it comes with a decent collection of white panel, although they are very common nowadays. both models have limited functionality, but each of them has at least one function to give the model some playability for kids, other than the swooshability that is. okay, it might lack some proper functions, but i still think kids will love this set. i can see kids running around with one of the planes in their hands. all in all i think this set delivers what you'd expect. score let's see how this set flies! remember that the grades are based on it being a small set. obviously a set like this, cannot be compared with a mercedes flagship. 8 design for a small set, the model looks very authentic. 7 building experience no surprises. 7 features just the retractable landing gear. 8 playability it has swooshability, so i see kids running around with this model. 7 parts lots of panels, if you are into that. 8 value for money can't go wrong with these small sets. 7,5 fun for kids more image can be found on my flickr page. thank you for reading. i hope you enjoyed it.

-1 while i can see kids enjoying this, i'm not sure i would buy. the flex axles are nice, and it is a decent number of white panels but i think i would get better return out of a larger parts set. fantastic review though, and your pictures show off this tiny model better than the box art does.

1 thanks for the nice review! the landing mechanism looks quite cute. aren't the yellow axles 5l, not 4l? (very strange that they would release such a part).

0 it says 5l in the parts list.

1 hi there, nice model, great review! i almost reverse engineered this model, but used wrong parts for landing wheels, didn't know how to fix the nose proper, and so on. so i was very interested in this model and i like playing with it. i love the reviews, but i think i have to mention, that the yellow axle must be a 5l! the picture shows a 5l, and a 5l would fit the size of the model. the cart has also a 5l in yellow. what sitze is the yellow axle in this seit. really 4l as written in the text? greetings, robert

0 i seem to have been messing up axle lengths in various reviews it's indeed 5l. my bad. thanks for pointing it out.

1 very nice review for a nice little set! i especially like the smoothness of operation for the retractable landing gear. i don't like the lack of symmetry for the propeller of the b model though, but understand the alternative would be to add one extra small panel to the set, or skip two of them in the b model.

1 good review, as always jim when i first saw this set i thought that it would make a great parts pack for me, as that i have about 20 white pieces in my technic collection (all from 42043) and this set has some really useful ones, all for a cheap price. those 7l flex axles will be extremely useful in my current build i'm doing

1 nice review, even with the missing demonstration video of the a-model! looks like this is an excellent panel pack for the price, and those soft axles will go down a treat. will this set be the dark horse of 1h 2016...?

1 i am definitely getting set for the panels!

0 set is only interesting for the panels, that's all it is to me

1 my favourite of the 2016 sets i've built so far. i'd go so far as to say this is the best "budget" set in years. i would have loved this when i was a kid ... great "swoosh ability" ??

1 thats a cool little mod, two small nigles though, 1, your navigation lights are flipped on the main wings, 2, the panels on the tail i *think* were supposed to be the intakes for the jet engine, by using them to close up the tail you've turned it into a glider cant wait untill i find one of these on shelves!

1 so this set showed up in stores yesterday, and i immediately picked two up. all in all it is a nice set, but it is slightly different from what i was expecting, the plane feels a bit "flat", pointy nose, wide bottom etc.. and while the panels work very well as wings, it feels a bit simplistic to just have single-part wings. the stickers really work for it though. its a cracking set though, nice parts pack, and a nice model as well

1 got this at the weekend, mainly for the parts, but built it first. agreed with other comments - awesome swooshability.

1 review - 42046 - getaway racer introduction starting with the 42010 - off-road racer and 42011 - race car in 2013, tlg released two sets in the first half of each year, using a pullback motor. the pullback motor allows the model to be pulled back, followed by forward motion. usually there's no apparent relation between the two set, other than the ability to combine them into an alternate build. this year there seems to some sort of cops and robbers scene going on. a getaway racer and a police interceptor. that can't be a coincidence. makes you wonder who will be victorious, the good guys or the bad guys. let's find out! note: all images can be clicked for hi-res versions. set information number: 42046 title: getaway racer theme: technic released: 2016 part count: 170 box weight: 302 gr box dimensions: 26,0 cm x 13,8 cm x 5,9 cm set price (msrp):  19,99 price per part:  0,118 links: brickset, bricklink the box the box has the same dimensions as previous year's pullback motor sets. in the lower right corner there's a visual explanation of the pullback mechanism. the dark model with it's decals sure looks like a cool hot rod. content of the box the box contains: 1 instructions booklet 1 sticker sheet 2 technic liftarms 1 pullback motor 3 bags instruction booklet just a single booklet. unfortunately no booklet for the alternate model. sticker sheet the sticker sheet contains a lot of cool stickers with flames and skulls etc. pullback motor and liftarms the pullback motor and two liftarms are found unbagged. bags a total of three bags containing the majority of the parts. highlighted parts this section describes the new and/or otherwise interesting parts. actually, this set is the only set of 1h 2016 which doesn't use any new parts, not even parts in a new color. tires the getaway racer uses four low profile tires (tire 37 x 22 zr). rims the rims are wheel 30.4mm d. x 20mm in pearl gold, found in 12 other sets. panels this set contains three #3 panelsand three #4 panels in black. part list this set contains 171 parts, all listed below. the build this being a small model, i won't show any building steps. let's skip right to the finished model. below you can see the end result. in my opinion the model looks great. it's got that hot rod vibe going on and the stickers add darkness to the vibe. slight problem with this set is that it really needs the stickers to finish the look. otherwise it's quite dull, with black and dark grey liftarms and panels. the rear view shows the pullback motor connected directly to the rear axle. in this image you can also clearly see the exhaust pipes on the side, which are very well executed. the 3x3 technic discs with stickers, used in the rim, result in only seeing a part of the rim. this works very well with the golden rims. the bottom view shows the chassis of the car. nothing really noteworthy, as you would expect from a pullback set. video the following video gives you an overview of the finished model. parts left these six parts are left after building the model. seems about right. features and functions this being a pullback motor set, it only has a single feature. the video below demonstrates the acceleration of the vehicle. my girlfriend was kind enough to catch the model before it fell to the ground. or did it hit something before it fell to the ground?! video this video shows the pullback functionality. b-model the alternate model is a combined build with the police interceptor, which you can see on the back of the box. unfortunately the instructions for the combined b-model are not included, so i didn't get a chance to build it. this would make for a fun challenge, building the b-model without the instructions. summary pullback sets are not the most technically advanced models, so you can't expect any other functionality than hitting the walls in your house. however, i think they are very appealing to kids. the fact that this year's pullback sets form a duo adds to the fun. in my opinion tlg hit the nail on the head with the getaway racer and police interceptor. the getaway racer looks very badass, which is something you don't see every day in a technic set. score how do i grade the bad guy in this year's duo. 8 design it looks so cool, but it does need the stickers. 7 building experience nothing out of the ordinary. 7 features limited to the pullback-and-drive functionality. 7 playability combined with the police interceptor, kids will love it. it does need it's nemesys though. 7 parts collection of common parts. gold rims could be interesting. 8 value for money pullback sets always deliver a certain value. 7,3 hit it! more image can be found on my flickr page. thank you for reading. i hope you enjoyed it.

0 one hero will now have just enough of that pullback motor to create one ultimate machine, thanks to this.

0 jim great reviews but can i suggest you one thing? take some pics before you apply the stickers....and some with the stickers on! it helps to have a comparison!

0 are parts #62462 in flat or metallic silver?

0 first thing i thought: hot wheels?? whut. the set looks like the hot wheels 'bone shaker'.

0 the instructions for the extreme police interceptor combo model is now online....will someone do a review of this b model? https://wwwsecure.us...tselector=true#

0 thanks again for the review. i am not sold on this one yet, but i confess it took about 2 years for me to finally appreciate 9396. maybe i need to see this in person.

0 dr_spock, on 01 december 2015 - 04:39 pm, said: thanks for the review. i wonder if the design inspiration came from the russian ka-32 helicopter. it sure seems that way.

1 great review with high quality pictures, well done!! i'm glad you took the time to do it properly. cool that you have built both models. i agree with the mudguards. they sure look good on this model.

-1 i was waiting especially for review of this set. let me add few things about this... thing. it all will be complainging of person who works with these type of machines, so if you just want a unusual machine in your collection, ignore my complaining :) i see underground loaders almost every day, and believe me, this model would now work in the underground mine. first of all, its cab should stick out more from the frame. each loader has cab placed out of the chassis, to provide better view for the driver. in this class of machine it would help a bit, but in low loader ones it is extremely important: this is the view from the cab of a low profile loader (looking at front - and yes, front of the machine is where engine is placed, because at least at kghm all machines drive engine forward): another thing about that cab is that seat and steering wheel/joysticks are placed perpendicularly to the machine chassis, to provide same view for driving forward and backwards. so another weak spot of the set. the model lacks of trans clear lights on the engine part, because all machines that work underground have same lamps on front and back. another thing that comes to my mind is that warning light and antena would not live too long in the mine, becuase it could be torn apart by ramming into tunnels roofs. it does resemble shape of underground machine, but not a loader. only machine that comes to my mind is something that are used for moving/placing hydraulic support jacks in tunnels. sorry for poor quality, i didn't find better picture of it: it does have claw, four wheels and articulated chassis, but have much greater range of movement of the arm. anyway, i'd give it at least 3/5 for overall look. model itself, as a set, looks unfinished (or cut down on pieces after visit of an accountant...) for me it looks like engine part was built differently, with knobs for steering/claw operating sticking out from back. claw needs almost seven full turns of the worm gear to close from opened position, and is rather annoing to use it in way it is built in this model. bracket that holds bevel gears responsible for steering is rather loose, being hold in place by single 3/4 pin. on the other hand, the steering works very well. it seems that lack of differential will be more common in lego sets, becuase it is another model that have fake engine driven by single wheel (like in old russian rc cars...). i am ok with that, but it is a pitty that this model has only r2 engine. thing that i do not like the most in this model is how the claw arm works. first of all, it barelly lifts the claw of the ground, the movement could be much better. and it has major design flaw - universal joints are not placed in line with articulation points, and this is main reason of 5l axle not being suported on both sides under the turntable. while rainsing the arm, it bends a little! i really would like to see this model built differently, with normal bucket and better range of movement. edited by m_longer, 05 december 2015 - 11:08 pm.

1 excellent review! worth waiting for. the set itself is very interesting. looks like it may have one interesting build techniques. thanks for the review, andy ad

0 great review, thank you. the set to me is kinda blah, interested more in the new panels than the rest of it.

1 think this is the only 1h set i'll be getting. guess i'm waiting for 2h for the rest of the construction stuff! this set looks okay to me; it includes the instructions for both models, which is cool, and includes some great parts. i like that it's not just another bucket loader and that it actually tries something different, too.

-1 great review and great pictures ! many thanks for talking the time to review this set . i am a fan of lego technic construction stuff, but this set is not so appealing to me. but, then again i am sure some people will love it.

-1 great review! one thing reaaaaaally bothers me about this set, both models have the engine connected to one wheel, the other wheel on the "powered" axle is just left to rotate freely, and that really bothers me, as it did in 42022 (on 42022 even more tbh, since its main feature is being a frigging car). looking at the pics it isnt even a space issue (as it was in the hot rod, where they "needed" to route the steering through), so they just cheaped out and didnt bother fitting a diff in there (or even a live axle link) im not very interested in this set (not into construction stuff), but i think this is a worrying trend :(

1 thanks for review, mostlytechnic. not a must have for me, but this set have nice assortment of parts... new turntable, new panels (i like yellow). and if i'll buy two of this sets - i'll get enough wheels for proper 18-wheeler. and rubber connectors, that i almost don't using at all, but want to have more and more) edited by victor imaginator, 06 december 2015 - 02:19 pm.

0 definately a quirky set, i think i'd have prefered a bucket on the front with a complex lift and tip mechanism, but a grab is different. as for the b model, i may prefer it's functions to the a model, certainly something different we have not seen before.

0 looks like its using the z60 turntable that's on the mercedes and the crawler crane 42042

1 nice mod there, effe, might inspire me when i get one and start modding it

-1 cool mod by effe. but the original model out of the box is one of the poorest models tlg ever released. looks from front to rear as a cheaped out set with really lazy design effort. a shame for the responsible lego designer parts assortment seems to be ok but this should not be the most important criteria sry jim, i really appreciate your always very well done reviews and offen i agree with the overall judgements/verdicts and of course tastes are different but especially that review sounds like gushing praise in my ears.... just my 2 ct edit: ooops just saw the review isn't done by jim...<blush>... so sry jim... now my final comment belongs to mostlytechnic edited by kumbbl, 27 december 2015 - 07:33 am.

1 again, great review with superb pictures. the white and blue certainly works very well with your dark backdrop. thorough review for such a small model. small in size but great as a set. tell me, why did i let you review this one?!

0 quote and the dumbing-down continues. now they have to show people to compare axle lengths to the 1:1 prints on the page that have always been there. but how does the 1:1 work on the app? might have to look into that... (for the record... i pulled out my phone and tried to find the app in the google store. couldn't find it. so then i went to the lego website shown on the page and it had a link to it. turns out it wasn't showing up because it's tablet only, so google wasn't showing it to me on my phone. i'll try again later with a tablet...) funny thing is that they changed colour of 7l axle to yellow, and on that picture it still is in lbg.

-1 thanks for a great review! too bad there is only one blue curved panel in this set. my opinion on the frictionless axlepins is that the flex axle might be easier to stick in them than in regular/blue axlepins... didn't actually try it though :-) edited by majklspajkl, 05 december 2015 - 11:46 pm.

1 excellent review! i am glad that you did not rush this or the mine loader review. could it be that the fan in the back is like a turbo prop propulsion.... just reaching here. andy d

-1 thank you for the review. i have this one in my pile to build. i wish there was more of the curved blue panels though.

1 here is a video review via jang to add to the review: i like both a and b so will buy both.

0 great review! im a bit undecided on the set though, it has some nice parts (4 cil engine in such a small set!) and it looks good, but also a bit small and simple, not sure if it stands up to the standards of the small tracked loader or similar for sets of this size, and as a parts pack (for panels/flaxles) the display team jet is infinitely better. ill probably pick one up, but right now i really want another tracked loader... (last one was sacrificed to the mod gods)

1 nice review, thanks nice little set, i might buy me one

1 review - 42038 - arctic truck introduction arctic vehicles aren't new to lego. back in 2000 the town theme already had several small orange arctic vehicles. in 2014 tlg again released a number of arctic sets in the city theme (formerly known as town). some of these sets are actually pretty big, containing over 700 parts. looking back in history it seems that arctic sets may have found their origin in the technic theme. although these sets were white instead of orange, they are unmistakenly arctic. the 1986 technic arctic sets contained the infamous technic figures. unfortunately the 2015 arctic truck doesn't contain any technic figures, but nonetheless it's great to see a new arctic vehicle in the technic line, not counting several snow scooters. let's see if the new arctic truck lives up to the expectations. note: all images can be clicked for hi-res versions. set information number: 42038 title: arctic truck theme: technic released: 2015 part count: 1219 box weight: 2110 gr box dimensions: 47,8 cm x 28,0 cm x 7,2 cm set price (msrp):  79,99 / us$ 84.99 /  59.99 price per part:  0,088 / us$ 0.093 /  0.066 links: brickset, bricklink the box the box measures 47,8 cm x 28,0 cm x 7,2 cm and weighs around 1385 grams. the box actually feels pretty heavy which means it's filled properly. this seems to be a trend in the technic theme. slightly smaller boxes can save shelf space for retailers. the front the front of the box shows the main model and in the lower right corner there's a image with the dimension of the model. it's 40cm long and 18cm wide. the back the upper part of the back of the box shows the functions of the main model. the lower left section shows the b-model, which looks very promising (more on that later). the lower right section shows the motorization options for the main model. the crane (partially) and the bed can be motorized. besides motorization some leds can be added as headlights. the side on of the sides shows one of the newer smaller style panels. this is the first time it appears in orange. when you take a look at the sticker you can see that it's not symmetrical. not sure why tlg "cut of" one of the sides of the stickers, since the position of the panel is very suitable for a continuous sticker. content of the box the box is pretty densely packed, which is better than semi-filled boxes. it feels like you actually bought something which matches the box size. the box contains: 2 booklets 1 sticker sheet 8 bags booklets & sticker sheet unfortunately the instructions and sticker sheet haven't been packed with cardboard protection, which results in a curved sticker sheet and slightly bent instructions. in my case this wasn't so bad. at least no real damage. highlighted parts this set proves to be a great parts pack, especially when you might have missed some of the 2014 sets. black link treads usually the link treads come in dark blue grey, but this sets includes 96 black treads, which is great if you'd like to replace the dbg ones in your mocs, or other official sets. undercarriage and suspension several parts are included to build the undercarriage driving the treads. four large tread sprockets and eight small tread sprockets, which are used as return sprockets. also included are four steering portal hubs and four steering portal axles for driving and steering the vehicle. several frames, including two c-shaped pivot frames and two steering ball joints to create an undercarriage much like the 4x4 crawler. the set even includes two h-shaped frames (a.k.a. dog bone frames). new changeover catch parts this year (2015) three new parts have been introduced to improve the changeover catch. more on these parts later. new pin connector another new part for this year (2015) is the "1l round pin connector", which looks like a pin connector, but acts more like a bush. new pins furthermore this sets includes quite a large number of three (relatively) new parts. 17 x pin with pin hole, 14 x 3l pin with 1l axle and 11 x 3l pin with 2l axle, which have been introduced this year (2015). when the new 3l pin with 1l axle was introduced in 2014 it was only a matter of time before the new 3l pin with 2l axle would appear. both new pins are a great addition to the parts portfolio. panels last but not least this sets contains a fair number of orange panels, including the 3x11 panel in orange, which is the first time we've seen this part. part list below is the entire part list for the 913 parts. as usual this part list can be found at the end of the second booklet. the build the build immediately starts with some of the new parts, used to build the compact gearbox in the center of the model. notice the two 20 tooth bevel gears. one would have been enough to drive the 12 tooth bevel gear, so the second seems to be useless. tlg probably used it in the a-model, because they needed it in the b-model, which you can see later. the front and rear suspension are almost identical. the front side also has the 13l gear rack, used for steering. the picture below shows the steering rack on the front suspension in more detail. at this point you have more or less finished the chassis. the gearbox is in place and the majority of the functions has internally been connected to the right gears. the small turntable shows where the crane will be attached later on. at the end of the first booklet, some of the bodywork has been attached to the chassis. the orange-black color scheme never fails to please me. throw in some cool stickers for the extra effect and we have a winner. if you decide to motorize the model, using pf, the top of the cabin can be lifted to accomodate the battery box. the chassis uses lots of orange (and some black) panels to give the model it's distinctive look. the protective black bumber/railing is a nice addition which adds something to the exterior. the dumping bed at the rear can tilt to empty it's load. it's operated by a mini la. the treads, which look very cool in black, are driven by a large tread sprocket and returned by two small tread sprockets. the front and rear sections are identical. building the undercarriages feels a bit repetitive, which is a problem for most tracked vehicles. finished model adding the crane to the model finishes the build. your model should look something like this. when you take a close look at the finished model, you realize this is something else. it's trully a unique vehicle. the color scheme is brilliant and the fact that it's an arctic truck is really neat. it's a welcome change for the technic line to see a vehicle like this. this picture emphasizes that's it's a very cool vehicle. imagine this beast plowing through the snow! as far as i know it's not based on a real life vehicle. if's probably a combination of several vehicles and some imagination. i can be totally wrong though. the rear of the vehicle shows the crane and drum, placed on the tipper bed. from this angle you can see some of the internals of the model, the gearbox behind the cabin for example. the crane can be partially motorized (rotation and base), while the boom is operated manually. what i like a lot is the protective railing around the vehicle. left over parts some leftover parts, nothing noteworthy. features and functions this set has several functions/features: steering driving suspension crane tipping bed steering as you can see in the image below the steering mechanism has quite a bit of negative caster (please correct me if i'm wrong), which causes the treads to rotate a bit upward/downward instead of only to the left and right. driving you mention driving as a feature?! yes i do and let me explain why. normally i would ommit this as a feature and take driving for granted. however, driving this vehicle (on a flat surface) causes it to simply slide over the surface. for other arctic vehicles this would be a plus, but with a tracked vehicle it limits playability. this is one of the main drawbacks of these tread, they simple don't work properly on smooth surfaces. suspension the suspension is working properly. you do need to apply some pressure, but all things considered it's not too bad. crane the crane has four degrees of freedom: base rotation lower boom upper boom hook it does what it's supposed to do. base rotation and lower boom can be motorized and switched using the gearbox, while the upper boom and hook are operated manually. tipping bed the tipping is operated via a mini la. conclusion while the set does offer various functions and features, driving and steering is a serious issue. therefor this set is more likely to be showcased than to be played with. b-model instructions for the b-model are of high quality. looking at the image below, you will see what i mean. here's the finished b-model, a tracked jeep with a communcations device. this alternate model looks so good, it could easily have made it as a main model. one thing that does pop in mind; how would this look with tires?! more on that later. when you are in the artcic region it's imperative to have proper communication channels. since there's no internet backbone, you will need a big antenna of some sort. this b-model actually features a small trailer wagon with a transmitter/receiver. here's more detailed image of the b-model, without trailer wagon. i would buy this model in a heartbeat if it were a main model. simply gorgeous. the side view doesn't give away that this in alternate model. the stickers also work really well in this model. and again, nothing to complain here. the model even has a small crane at the rear, operated by the mini la. here you can see the arctic fleet, comprised of both the a-model and b-model. i bet these two can get some work done!! a bit of a messy picture, but this should give you an impression of the size of both models. leftover parts not too many parts left, which is obviously a good thing. alternate model with tumbler tires just like me, you probably have been wondering how this model would look like with (tumbler) tires. well, here it is. as i imagined it does look great. admittedly, these are not the type of tires we ought to use, but to be honest; i don't really care. again, the negative caster results in quirky steering. the tires are a bit too big, so they hit the chassis when you compress the suspension. while this has absolutely nothing to do with an arctic vehicle, i really love this picture. summary we're almost at the end of my review, so what do i think of this set. let's start with getting the elephant out of the room; this set lacks proper driving and steering. does that make it a bad set?! definitely not! it's a great set, but it lacks some playability when it comes to moving the vehicle. the crane and tipper bed do work properly, so there's still some playability left. does this set look cool? definitely! i think it's one of the coolest (no pun intended) and most original models of recent years. the orange and black color scheme works great and the stickers are well designed. the b-model is of very high quality and some might even prefer it over the a-model. and if you are not interested in either of these models, this set provides you with a variety of great parts! all in all i think this is a great set! maybe not to play with, but it scores high on all other criteria. pros original model great color scheme lots of interesting parts great b-model cons steering and driving don't work too well repetitive build of undercarriages (minor con) score below are my scores based on different categories. 8 design original and good looking model. 7 building experience fun to build, albeit a bit repetitive. 8 features packs quite a few features. 7 playability some features work, some don't. 9 parts comes with interesting parts. 9 value for money two great model in a single set. 8 cool! as a bonus, here's picture of the main model with tumbler tires. why? because we can!

1 very timely review jim. my wife has just surprised me by giving me this set a few days ago and i have just built the a model two days ago and b model yesterday. i agree with all that you wrote above. i don't have tumbler tires but i have 9398 tires. driving is smooth but steering + suspension will be bad as you said due to negative caster and tires hitting the chassis. anyway, tonight i will destroy the b model and rebuilt this http://www.busterhau...8-c-model.html.

1 i was supposed to publish it together with the 42039 - 24 hours racer, but it somehow got backlogged. after completing the reviews for the 2016 sets, i felt i needed to finish it (was already 90% done). that c-model looks cool!

-1 the set is a looker, you've got to admit it, but what it gives in looks does not make up for what it lacks in functions. i really wanted this set, badly even, when i restarted my adventure with technic about a month ago. than i learned more and more about what a good model can do, mostly thanks to this forum and yt. right now i'm a bit disappointed with the arctic truck - smaller sets offer more functions and teach you much more. jim it was a great review nevertheless edited by pgplay, 14 december 2015 - 11:22 am.

1 great review. i bought this model several weeks ago and the box has sat on my shelf, so i think after this i will be digging it out for christmas and i expect my son will have a lot of fun with it when it's built. ps. these tumbler tyres look amazing on this model, and indeed amazing in their own right!

0 i think this model is more or less supposed to be a version of this thing. a pretty obscure topic, but also very interesting.

0 how about this one: ps i somehow didn't find this picture when i wrote my review.

0 i could be wrong but i am 100% sure that i've seen this review before.

0 you switched the sides for the panel with the unsymmetrical sticker. otherwise you would see that the cut off part is where there's a beam in front of the panel. that's probably done because the beam could possibly damage the sticker, either while building or while placed against it for a long time. or it's simply omitted because it wouldn't be (completely) visible

1 another great review i like this set very much, both models look good to me and it's a great part pack for me, the long list in the "high light parts" session tells everything. as for the real world counter part of the a model, how about this: try googling sno-cat and there a lots of such things.

-1 jim/anyone....i built this set a few days ago, i dont like the way the crane arm section has no knob to turn the mini turntable. you see the 20 tooth gear?....there is a pinhole located next to this....i would like to add something here to make it easier to turn the winch section.

-1 i have the 42038, nice set but i found the tipping of the bed clumsy. it was a pleasure to build and i do like the build with the tumble wheels

1 the suspension is indeed awesome. for it's size, this is a great set! looking at the grades, i seem to have lowballed the score.

0 sad, i miss this set.

0 you've done a good job of this review mr imperialscouts! but two things. 1) background far too bright and the set is far too dark, easily rectified with brightness & contrast adjustment. 2) no poll to rate the set out of 5. nonetheless this should be frontpaged on classic-pirates.com!

1 sigh. i think i got this for a birthday back in the day. my parents were so awesome. :) tc

0 the poll doesn't allow you to select 2 from 1-5. it instead says 1, 3, 3, 4, 5. but besides that, your review i give it a 5 because 1) shows the set in all angles 2) shows the characters 3) comment on the little creature comforts of the set 4) added a comic (playability) 5) showed true enthusiasm *y* *wub*

0 the poll is for the set, not the review :-d . but thank you anyway! and it appears mister phes made the mistake :-p !

-1 i'd give a 2, but you put 3 two times. is a nice set but is not really cool. is a worse version of lagoon lock up

1 it's not too expansive and you get some nice pieces like that jail, the damaged yellow corner and a shako of course *wub* for this i''l give it a 4! very nive review imperial scouts, keep it up! *y* edited by captain green hair, 20 october 2007 - 12:39 pm.

1 nice review, funny little story, and a 4 from me. a useful little set indeed. *sweet*

1 great review, cool comic. *wub* i give the set a four, and i will go and buy it now as i am missing many of those parts.... oh it's not for sale? off to bricklink then! :-d

-1 well i only know the european price: 89.99 euros i think that's quiet expensive against the 2005 police station (7237): 74.99 euros - rupeeclock

1 hello, well as this is my first review i hope you like it. the 7744 police station is simply fanstastic. the many minifigs and the vehicles makes it really nice. the great playabillaty and and great space makes it great for children i think. but latest but not least the pics! general overview: the front of the box: the back of the box: inside the box: top of the box: instructions: the minifigs: the cars: patrol car: dog car: the dog: the motor: well now the police station : the mailbox: the crime report room: the handcuffs holder: handcuff: suspect who wears handcuffs: jails: satelite: little things: water machiene: and if you don?t like water, we have coffee to!: well and as last: the interrogation room: well this was the review. i hope you liked it! bye

1 hooray assuming from the picture on the box we will also be getting the old police car and bike in blue aswell! i really like this set it seems the best police station we've had in a long time and what a great amount of figures! thanks for this great insight the-force! ;-)

1 it's mine *wub*! just got my luke today from tru in in merrilville, in... ;-)! so here's some pictures and thoughts: still in the packing with the box pieces out in the fresh air put together, ready for some serious vader vacking >:-)! if you this close you're so dead!! it's yet another lovely maquette *wub*! the only downside is that the lego sw sign doesn't even resemble (ok, i've exagurating a bit :'-)) the ones from the other maquettes! check out this one from the blackhole trooper compared with the luke one: the luke one is has a massproduced look over it with just a printing |-/ , the other has depth & a painting on it. now i'm waiting for the long overdue boba one! here's the other maquettes reviewed: darth vader & stormie blackhole stormie maquettes on copmike

0 excellent review copmike! i feel as if i've actually seen the maquette up close in real life. x-d i swear i've even touched it. tack for sharing min kompis! *sweet*

1 awesome! these maquettes are really cool, thanks for the review! *y* ~peace

1 beautiful...i'm really trying to resist these. any word on who's next after boba fett? a c-3po/r2-d2 pair would probably push me over the edge.

1 verry cool, love it, what was the price?

-1 copmike, on nov 22 2007, 04:09 pm, said: it's $69.99 + tax :'-(! boba on copmike golly gee, batman! that's too expensive for that, in my view.

1 finally, the highly anticipated luke skywalker maquette! i'm still looking forward to that boba!

1 thanks to this information. it's interesting for me. :-)

0 thanks for the cool picture! how big are those maquettes? could you make a picture with a minifig next to the maquette please?

-1 ah yes, i saw a whole shelf of them in my tru(touched it too!) too small, and way overpriced. waste of miney. the luke is 6" high! what is that?!?! great review! edited by ~vbbn~, 22 november 2007 - 11:19 pm.

-1 not my thing, but a very nice review, thanks for sharing it! i was seriously considering this one when it was originally announced as a 6212 copack item at a particularly good price and then everything changed. i do, however, seriously ache to get my hands on one of the more traditionally lego looking 2ft+ vaders they use in the official stores (at least they had one here in orlando). *wub*

0 nice review. how's the head made attached to the body?

0 can you swap head? and coler on the saber?

0 if you have other heads and other lightsaber blades, yes :)

1 during the annual thanksgiving road trip to the relatives, i stopped by the tru in portland, or. lo and behold, the new mars mission sets! obviously, i bought them. ;-) the box: not much to say. standard box art for mm sets, nothing new. the parts: some good parts here. even if you don't like the set (which i highly doubt after i've had my say :-p ), it's a decent parts pack. i noticed that some old parts have been renewed. i know the wheel has been used in the '07 sets, but the cockpit and hitch i haven't seen in a while. the vldss (very large dss). grr. new part. at least, i think it is. someone slap me if it isn't. *wacko* the figs. i know i've seen that head before, but i have no idea where. does anyone know? i was hoping that the aliens would have new arms, at least. i was sadly mistaken... on the upside, i finally discovered that they glow in the dark. :-$ the alien has a jetpack. if that's not the silliest thing i've ever seen, i don't know what is. the build. simple build. a block. so easy a caveman cou- oh, never mind. geico's used that one enough. then, we have this jobber right here. not sure what it is, but it looks like some crystal scanning device. it's starting to look pretty nice. it almost looks practical. the cockpit is suffering from a bad dose of over-stickering. on the upside, we have a new piece there to hold the cockpit on. part 1 complete. it has a nice little radio antenna, which is ruined by the use of a random missile that looks like it's going to shoot the antenna before it shoots the alien. still, i never say no to a good missile i can use for something else. the trailer: fairly simple, but it works. it features stabilizing arms, a handheld saw, and an extremely random mini-bot who's purpose escapes me. the whole meal deal- erm, general pics. overall, i thought this was a good set. in fact, it reminds me of this:

1 finally we have seen the light!!! i've been waiting for a while deciding if i was gonna get this....well i've decided after that wonderful review i am! good job reviewin!! *wub*

1 i got most of the sets from '07, they're pretty cool.

1 thanks for the review, it's a neat little set. i hope it comes to australia sooner rather than later. that minifig head was also used in 7699 mt-101 so that may be why it seems familiar.

0 thanks for the review. i still will not get this set. speechless about it

1 a wonderful set and, perhaps, as close to classic space as possible. *y* also there?s a great amount of very useful and interesting parts too like these round 'stabilizer' parts with clip.... :'-) there?s a complete different feeling with this new sets compared to the first mm ones.... 8-| beside the a little more realistic aspects of it with the more enclosed cockpit (nearly with some controls.... ;-) ) it?s the overall more solid feeling i guess.... the other sets look pretty neat and fashionable at the surface, but their internal structure is much more hollow and useless with some studless technic beams and such stuff.... very shining, but hard and boring to mod, just aimed for maximal cool looking box art and the rest went down for saving costs.... (beside that already pretty good 7692 dropship that is). the only thing i don?t get with that is why the minirobot?s a one-armed one.... ach, pirates on mars i suppose.... x-d

1 that head might have been from rock raiders. lovely set, and a good review. jifel

0 hmm, not actually a bad set. not high on my 'to buy' list, there're other things up there first, but definitely a possibility somewhere down the line. thanks for the review.

-1 tks for the great review mm ;-) its always appreciated to have reviews of new set. having said that i really don't see the point of that set and its such money and time wasted imo. i don't like that theme apart the dropship and 6wheeler and that tiny vehicle doesn't do the trick for me. i see it as a really cheap excuse to try and please classic space fan with that horrendous mm graphics and what amazes me is that you guys loke that :-d money saved on !! *yoda*

1 during the annual thanksgiving road trip to the relatives, i stopped by the tru in portland, or. lo and behold, the new mars mission sets! predictably, i bought them. i present to you: the mx-41 switch fighter! man, what a long name. the box: standard mm. on the front, it shows the fighter in flight mode, and a yellow note telling you that it transforms. the back shows three pictures showing it happen. the parts: once i open the box, the first thing that comes out is a bent and rolled up instruction booklet, and i was forced to put it under a stack of beer books for an hour. then, there's the dss. yes, two of the stickers do feature a cobra. i wonder why, because this set's decal should be a beatle. x-d decent parts, nothing too special. then, i noticed this little part. it's used for the flick-missiles, but i have no idea what else it would be used for. :-/ the build: the alien ship: when i looked at the box art for this set, i was releived to see that the aliens don't have another curved-forward wing ship. instead, they have this little beauty, which appears to be the alien mini cooper- small and hot. *wub* anyway, partially completed. even if you don't like the set, it has some nice green flame peices, which work nicely for space laser swords. fully completed. the only annoying bit about it is that the crystal-holding thing in front wobbles all over the place. the alien fits into it by way of impalement. it must hurt getting in and out. switch fighter (cockpit): the set makes good use of the alpha team cockpit. for controls, it has a meagre handlebar that the astronaught can't even reach. the rear "shell" of the fighter starts out around the alien containment chamber. it's a bit odd that the containment chamber has an alien sticker, because the instruction booklet lists it as holding crystals. the crystal canister is held back by a technic pin. this is, without a doubt, the ugliest color arrangment ever. warning: mass stickers. :-x the cockpit fits into grooves in the "shell". then it clicks into place in a 1x1 brick with a horizontal clip. the wing "mechanism": the wing. for some reason, the body of the "mechanism" has a blue brick. *wacko* the wing and "mechanism" connect to prevent the fighter doing a nosedive while in tank mode. the wing "mechanism" completed: the underside: the body and wing connect by way of a miscolored red brick. i have no idea why it's red- black would bave been much, much better. completed. tank mode: all in all, this looks pretty neat. the wheel base is pretty short, but it's not bad. transform! the set transforms neatly, if ungainly. without "anti-grav" support, it would fall forward on it's nose each time it transformed. jet mode. it's all right, but it could be a bit better. the "shell" keeps slipping back forward to the "tank mode" because there's nothing to stop it sliding. spare parts: overall: i thought this set was great. it could do with some fixing, such as the mismatched colors, but it should be a definate buy for mm fans. brickshelf gallery (when available)

1 cool review. i'm actually liking that new missile part as it seems to combine a bar with a pin. but it's a real eyesore if you ask me.

0 great review! sinner, on nov 26 2007, 12:22 am, said: well, since anti-grav doesn't exist, and will never exist, there has to be another option! looking at it in tank mode it does have a vague aerofoil shape so i think it should be able to work as a lifting body. all it needs to do then is move fast enough to start taking off and then it can extend the wings... 8-| this is clearly tlg officially supporting anti-grav technology...i mean think about it. "how can it support itself without anti-grav while transforming?" the answer? it can't *sweet* :-p

-1 hmm, its actually a nice bit better than i expected, and great review, thanks! but think ill pass on this one. i quite like the alien fighter though, heh. and loved the way you described how he sat in the cockpit.

1 thanks for a very thorough review. i might think about getting this. i really like the mini alien fighter, and the transformation idea is always a welcome one. both modes look pretty good, despite the some of the odd coloured bricks (which i'd mod out). you know what it reminds me of? some of the futuristic designs in the gerry anderson series.

1 wow. this is actually quite a neat set! it is definitively my favorite in the line after the big drilling unit! \begin{geek} i'm not sure it would nose dive when transforming from tank mode. i guess it would pick up speed and transform quickly since it doesn't seem to have any downwards pointing thrusters. \end{geek}

1 friggin sweet, thank you mr mandy for the reveiw of this sweet ship! *y* *wub*

-1 and another tks and congrats mm on that review !! like the o?her post i think that this set is a wastre of time and money and shelfspace. its such a ripp off from that ugly alfa team crapjet. i do not like the design of the jet itself: the small flags as front is so lame !! and i don't like those orange wheels as engines !! furthermore i don't like the "rover" mode either !! the only cool thing about it is the special martian jet which they should ahve sold separatly :-p at least some interesting parts but that far from saving that set imo |-/ money saved on once again :-p *yoda*

1 john cleese, on nov 25 2007, 10:56 pm, said: cool review. i'm actually liking that new missile part as it seems to combine a bar with a pin. but it's a real eyesore if you ask me. a needed solution to those blasted flick missles from falling out while swooshing. *sweet* wonder if the range might have an issue seeing it's held in there but who knows, maybe they now "pop" out with a greater velocity than a mere finger flick? i had resorted to technic 1/2 bushings (smooth) to lock in the missile's technic axle (with stud).

1 great review, mr. m! *y* i *wub* those green flames, and the design of the ship is pretty good. thanks for the review, and great pictures! they are clear. big, and describe the set just the way they should.

1 8115 dark panther review check out my review of this great new exo-force set. comic and rating will be up shortly! and hopefully more reviews too... :-)

0 so hinckley, can you give us a hint on what our walrus friend will do with the dark panther? i can't wait to see. 8-|

1 awesome. i can't wait to get my hands on this one.

1 great review hinckley! i know you've been busy, so thank you so much for getting this up! :-d the spine construction is clever, the minirobot's cool, this is a fantastic set! ~peace

1 thanks for this fantastic review hinckley, i can't wait to see the comic! :'-) i really love this mech as i am a fan of non-bipedal mechs (though i am terrible at making them), the purple is great and i can't wait to see what mocers will use those awesome new spike peices for! 3 robots in one mech is a really good deal too, and that spider droid just adds so much more to the set. and thanks for taking the time to do this! *sweet* not to sound like a smartypants though, but the grill peice in purple is not the first time this has happened, two were included in the 06 joker helicopter ;-) thanks again! to the brickmobile! >:-)

1 awesome reveiw thanks for the pics!! did the instructions come with a comic?

1 thanks for that very neat review, hinckley! *y* this set looks indeed very interesting, with a very cool antlike look and a simple but essential overall design. the cockpit seems better protected than many other ef ones, that spine?s lovely and the way these iron drones?re attached is simple but effective. :-) and hey, did i miss something or?re there really no crappy shooting devices...? :-p thanks to the minirobots and their inventor i guess.... :'-)

1 great review as always, hinckley. frankly i'm in love with this thing. so much so, in fact, that i've been calling it 'shadow panther' for weeks, but never mind... anyway, why do i like it? well, purple is such a fantastic lego colour- it's sparingly used, which makes it interesting, and it simply looks great. those jetpack/backpack things the robots are wearing, and if they are jetpacks, as the back of the box suggests, then the use of chaisaws is quite nifty and innovative. the minibot is cool, and certainly an interesting gimmick. sure, they don't look quite as good in some of the other sets, but here it looks great. the overall structure and design are cool too. it's always nice to see an 'irregular' mech, and this is no exception. it's especially cool whee the spines are concerned. plus, on top of all that, it's got a nice selection of parts, including some lovely new ones, and the inlaid box is interesting. well worth getting, i think.

1 another fantastic review, hinckley. i really like this set, i wasn't to keen on it when i first saw the pictures bit having seen the review, i am starting to like it. it seems quite sturdy, and it makes a change from the usual 2 legged mechs. as well as that purple is welcome anywhere, i have such a shortage of that colour! i like the rusty orange colour of the robots, and their back/jet packs are quite cool, and the mini robot looks sweet.

0 thanks everyone! i'm glad you are enjoying the review. i'm working on the 8118 right now and will have comics up for both starting tonight. hayatoson, on nov 27 2007, 04:02 am, said: awesome reveiw thanks for the pics!! did the instructions come with a comic? the instructions do not have a comic, but i always write one for my reviews featuring my sig-fig or other fabuland creatures interacting with the new set...

0 from the lego store in chicago, if i recall his post properly! my goodness hink, you're going to pull an all-nighter for reviews at this rate! oh well, it's kinda worth it, right? :-p

1 another great review, hink! looks like a great set. quote the cockpit isn't sealed and is actually aggravatingly unrealistic as it leaves the drivers chest vulnerable to enemy fire. actually the cockpit lacks any controls as seen here where it looks like keiken is simply pounding a counter demanding food. :-d "gimme food! or else my friend up there willl shoot your punk- @$$ into mars!" well, i guess that explains why there are no robot snipers in ef. if there were, well.... wouldn't be much of a story, would there? x-d

0 darnit, hinckley! >:-( you always make us wait for the comic, which is almost everyones favorite part! >:-( |-/ x-d i just noticed ryos uniform had a camo pattern. with all the orange he has, it's kinda pointless. edited by lt. veers, 28 november 2007 - 04:48 am.

0 this designers were on a roll with this one until it came to the flying unit. it looks like a shambles, epecially the guns looking rather simplistic. although they used something similar to the light and sound globe peice, which is kind of neat. i dont think i'll be buying this but your review almost talked me into it.

1 thank you for the glimps at the new set hinckley *y* . i saw this set today at my local tru store. the new slope 1x2 pieces look very *sweet* . i definitly see great potential for these pieces on locomotives. i hope these are going to be bountiful in the 2008 lines. model on!!

-1 fantastic! great review, thanks a bunch for all the pics, they've shown me how (in my opinion) bad this set is. :-p i just expected it to be more bricky rather than technicy. oh well, i wasn't planning on buying it anyway. x-d i noticed you spelt mini-figs mini-fgis in the first paragraph, in case you wanted to know. x-d so again, thanks, and i'm looking forward to seeing the rest of them, and the comics! ~peace

1 thanks for this great review hinckley! :'-) i know you're loving this attention! x-d :-p i actually like this set, and like it a lot more now that i've seen this review. i'll most likely get, mostly for the figs and parts. i reckon it would look a lot better alongside the rest of the 2008 ef mechs. anyway, thanks for the review! to the brickmobile! >:-)

1 thanks for that good review, hinckley. *y* a really interesting set and a turning point for lego. minirobots instead of shooting crap, pretty cool. i hope the kids?ll like it too. for the design, i love that asymmetrical look of the front part and the sleek guns of the flyer. it?s smart that the gatling gun moves along with the tank, too. the set idea with two vehicles in one?s not new, but very play- able and the treads/big wheel design?s cool. i don?t like the use of studless technic beams, but well, they do their job i guess. and keiken?s cockpit should be easy to improve....

0 asuka, on nov 28 2007, 02:41 pm, said: for the design, i love that asymmetrical look of the front part and the sleek guns of the flyer. the asymmetry reminds me of the wookie vehicles in starwars battlegrounds... *y* and i see they changed back to the first color schemes for minifig suits, which i think where better than the dark suits of 2007 (except for hikaru's *wub* ) luxorv

0 can't wait for the extended review!! ;-)

1 some of you might know that i'm not a big fan of exo-force, but this set is an exception. this looks like a futurist tank. my kids would love this.... if i should have any :-d as always, very professional review hinckley!

0 i think this is probably my least favourite set of next years selection, but i still might get it, partly because of this review (thanks, btw). i quite like the mini-robot, and while there are a few problems (the front cockpit, the exposed axles) i relish the idea of moding them out, and correcting them. and the change back to the original figs is welcome. i didn't really get any of this years sets, only last years. makes it easier from a mocing potential, anyway.

1 crap! >:-( now i have to spend all my money on this! *wub* *wub* and whats the code? oh well, awesome set, and judt curios, didnt the reviewers used to be bianca and gavin? jifel

1 thanks for this new review, hinckley *wub* for me, it was love at fistr sight with this little set :-p it's simple but nice, and way better than shadow crawler for a spider-like mech *y* you sure will be very busy these days, and your characters will get breakdown before they finish filming all the comics x-d luxorv

1 i would agree. the spider looks really cool. too bad we can't see how the combo mech looks like. instructions are not online yet. :-/ there should be another combo mech but you'll need the storm lasher set. :-p

1 hinkley, you are the man! your reviews just keep on getting better and better! although all of the sets this year are great and i love them all to bits, i can't say there was one that i absolutely felt like something i'd buy except for the storm lasher. but with this review, i think this will be the first purchase of 2008 for me! i totally agree with you on how the spider looks better without mini-robot. but from looking at where the cockpit is placed and how the skull on the cockpit is lodged underneath the walker, maybe the mini-robot would look better mounted underneath the head? that way it looks more even and even gives the thing a nasty set of teeth! i gotta try it out once i get it. can't wait for the fabuland comics! keep it up, hink!

0 hinckley, on dec 6 2007, 04:56 am, said: honckly? wow, dude. :-/ well, at least you got the c and the k. of course, the e is missing. it's all right though. eight letter words can be challenging :-p that's always the case for me. although, i have the assault tiger and will start on it next. on the box it looks like it is wearing huge bell bottoms. :-d i want to get the chameleon hunter, i really like the look of it and forgot to pick it up. guess i'll have to go back to tru! :-$ cross your fingers that i find more indy sets! x-d i'll just stick to calling you hink *y* (less letters :-d )

1 cool! another *y* *y* *y* *y* *y* *y* out of *y* *y* *y* *y* *y* and could you post a pic of all the minirobots and planes

1 oh, i just *wub* theat mini-bot. creepy, but strangely cute... nice piece selection, and the idea of something with rotors that double up as cutters storming (no pun intended) through the jungle ripping it apart is just fantastic (to me, anyway). i'm liking the new swords as rotors blades, that's pretty innovative, and the exhaust pipe pieces are intriguing.

1 thanks for the review, hinckley! i like the set it looks good, and all those ork swords..... *wub*

0 zero1312, on dec 6 2007, 09:48 am, said: yes, when in 2008 do these sets come to germany? :-/ um i do not know, i live in the u.s.a. *sweet*

1 here is my review of the set 6265 sabre island! overview: sabre island was release in 1990 an it contained 92 pieces and its retail price was $15.50. it comes with 3 imperial blue coats, and a nice outpost for them. the pictures + full review: anyway, you can see here a picture of the box, the model shown on the box differs from the actual model slightly. ...and the back of the box, which shows some nice alternative models from the pieces provided. a close up of two or three of the alternative models. and now for the minifigs. i prefer the red coats over the blue coats but these minifigs are nice, and for the number of pieces one gets a fair amount of them. the set itself makes a nice small outpost, it comes complete with a palm tree, a cannon (with ammo) on a turntable, a small tower a nice large imperial flag and a little red row boat! here is a shot from ground level showing the cannon and blue coat (patrolling the out post!) the rowing boat was a nice touch, and it comes with a small flag too. "no pirates will avoid the wrath of myself and my mighty island!" the top of the tower is rather plain and simple which in some ways is good, as it keeps the whole set detailed yet not crowded, but i feel a little something should of been added to the top though. the back is lacking any type of walls, so one can play with the minifigs inside, yet their are also no stairs or any other ways for the blue coats to climb up their tower either! the rag tag pirates attack sabre island! but never fear, the lord of pies is here! me throwing a pie at captain ironhook from another angle. overall i think this is a very good, if somewhat simple set, and makes a great cheap imperial set! comments, thoughts and opinions are welcome! (and sorry about the darkness in some photos, i have not had time to take photographs when it is till light recently, for when i return home it is dark |-/ ) edit: fixed, thank you! edited by phred, 12 april 2015 - 05:14 am.

1 fantastic review! i'll post my views on the set later when i have more time. but i've already fixed the poll.

1 nice review! hmm...i gave it a 4...why? very good bits: -3 epaulettes for 3 gurads! -patterned wall parts -cannon bad bits: -no pirates to fight -title is rather grand for an outpost -top needs battlements, not very low lattices -needs a more substantial base - the wall goes right into the sea! - surely the whole thing would sink... -palm tree is too short ...and the rest is good! :-p you might want to fix the vote option for 5 - it appears to be the title; you can't vote for it... pirate king skelly killer edit: ok, boney, but i gave it a 4! edited by slyowl, 06 december 2007 - 07:32 pm.

1 you even have the box! splendid review. i also own this one, and i think there's nothing to complain about. (more figs would be appreciated though, a sneaky pirate perhaps) 4 out of 5!

1 thanks for that nice review, it?s a 5 for me.... just a great little blue coats set, perfect for army and fortress building. *sweet*

1 i remember buying this set and thinking what an amazing job lego had done. it was my first pirate set and i still have it built. *sweet*

1 i gave it a 5, it has some nice pieces at a reasonable price. thanks for this review, and the pictures are great! *sweet*

1 thank you for the comments! *sweet* i wonder who voted "1", surely such a nice set doesn't deserve such a low score!? *wacko*

1 it's not a bad thing to vote sabre island 1 if someone feels that it's genuinely worth 1 but t'would be interesting to know why.

1 i gave this one a 5. it's one of the little pirate sets i had during my youth and i loved it for several reasons. first of all, it contains 2 of my favorite minifigs! it can be used as a small independent base or in combination with one of the bigger sets (eldorado or trading posts) as a lookup or outer defense. besides all that, this set just looks beautiful. i love the colors (blue baseplate and the white/yellow tower). one of the best little/medium sized sets ever made by lego!

1 i give it a 4, only because there are no pirates. i aways loved this set, nice little fortifaction. lots of details. i only wish i could have worked it in aberbrick.

0 remind us what aberbrick is mr radar... or better still give us a link and give your moc plug x-d

1 indexed i'm going to have to start dodging cannon balls soon if i don't start making some pirate mocs. *pirate* anywayz, i've had my shell service station set # 6378 built exactly by "the book" and sitting around for the longest time. with the recent twinning of my "town" with dr. sinister, i needed a gas station that could handle a lot more traffic (especially military traffic and these new 6-wide vehicles x-d ). here be a thumblink to the original station at bl: i love this station so much, but it really needed some modernization. the reopening of this station received a lot of attention, even the local police stopped right over. one big upgrade to this station is the selling of propane tanks, which is generally a rare commodity from the lego towns i've seen. x-d also at this service station is a propane tank refilling station. the milkman is our first propane customer. the interior has also had an addition and many upgrades. for instance, this building now has florescent lighting, a big frig in the back, and more shelf space. *y* oh look! there's the officer purchasing a mountain dew. now that there's more shelf space, we can sell more than just 1x1 round yellow bricks and levers. we now have available 1x1 round plates and 1x1 round cones available in multiple colors! :-d with this upgraded gas station, hopefully this town will bring in more business and customers into my small town. x-d p

1 that?s a be-au-ti-ful station! it looks perfect from head to toe ;) you managed to keep the original feeling, yet enhanced it to match the spirit of todays city sets. congratulations! and i love your milkman truck! :d

1 a wonderful work and a neat idea with that propane tank refilling station. *y* very detailed and very charming indeed! :'-)

1 nice station phred, love those fluorescent lights! *wub* but...start dodging cannonballs now, boom, harr! :-p

1 thank you big pete *wub* this set looks very good, it looks well built and the statues are nice. the ark looks great and the star wars hieroglyphic is classic :-d just a two things: is marion's face double sided? it looks like a calm face on the back of the box. where do the snakes come out? and about the stickers, have you tried putting them on the long bricks above the breakable walls? once again, thanks very much *wub* *y*

0 tinypiesrus, on dec 16 2007, 12:39 am, said: is marion's face double sided? it looks like a calm face on the back of the box. yes it is ... i never noticed until i just checked! :-$ will post a pic of the alternate face when my camera battery is charged :) quote where do the snakes come out? they sit on a pivoting plate behind the star wars heiroglyphics. you press down on a brick at the back and the plate drops and they fall out from underneath. quote and about the stickers, have you tried putting them on the long bricks above the breakable walls? well, yes ... that was where i guessed they were meant to go ... but really ... there is no mention of this in the instructions! edited by big pete, 16 december 2007 - 12:49 am.

1 outstanding! i can't believe you found one! i'd bet hinckley would be surprised about this.

0 marion's other face!

1 db24, on dec 16 2007, 02:09 am, said: thank you for the great review! looks like a very nice set, so many snakes!! 10 in all ... 5 green, 5 red

0 this is great, thanks for the review...but they're using a new skellie? i thought those were just for the reanimated dead...not just skeletons. unless that skeleton is supposed to be reanimated? either way it makes me sad :'-( that marion is beautiful *wub* worth it for the set alone! and that sw reference is great x-d

1 thanks for that cool review, big pete! *y* a very interesting set with a great playability and that sw sticker?s just hilarious! snake shower on! :-d

1 big pete, on dec 15 2007, 09:07 pm, said: marion's other face! that is an amazing figure!!!! i'm definitely getting that! thank you! *wub*

1 iamded, on dec 15 2007, 06:51 pm, said: thanks for the review! it looks awesome, and 10 snakes! is that box the ark though? thanks again! ~peace yes, the ark is the box in the center.

0 could you take a photo of the ark? thanks oh and the inside too pleese *sweet*

1 lol! those star wars heiroglyphics are awesome! were those in the movie? or is this just a joke by the lego designers? that would be the first time tlc showed any kind of reference humor! the rest of the set is great too, even the skeleton and the stickers. yes, that's right, i actually like those things. i like the new skellies because of their posability (i'm a big supporter & user of stop-motion) and i think there's nothing wrong with stickers. i mean seriously, why does everybody hate stickers so much??? :-| sure, they are a pain in the megablocks to put on and, sure, they come off after a while and are never usable again, but hey, you don't have to put them on, even better, you can save them (like i do) and use them for your mocs! could somebody tell me, please? i'm just curious. however, as i said, nice set! i might even get one. gotta love that marion with the carot torch x-d and that arc is neat too! by the way, are all parts on it golden? some more pics on it would be nice as soon as your camera is recharged! ;-) thanks. peace out!

1 this and motorcycle chase were the two sets i've wanted from the start. i like how you get lots of snakes, and i'll add my snakes in too, for a brickfilm. sometimes i like the stickers, but all my world city ones got hard and fell off :'-( i like the r2-d2. could you take a pic of any hieroglyphics in this set(not the ones on the sticker sheet.) thanks. i want to decode them.

1 my 2nd review (what a veteran) ... again, found this set via a shop assistant, in my local tru (portsmouth, uk) this evening. comes in at ?44.99, which, is pretty steep, but, you get quite a bit for your money. front of the box : back of the box : back of the box closeup : contents : it was a nice surprise to get numbered bags ... not had a large set with numbered bags for quite a while, at least in none of the sets i've bought recently! didn't take a close up of the stickers, but i was quite disappointed that the curved pieces had stickers ... if they could print the att curved pieces, why not these? minifigs : oh ... and there's a nice backprint on the pilot figure : now, the build was pretty good ... you build the plane first (after the minifigures). quite an interesting build in a way, becayse for a while you think the back is the front ... and then you realise, heh! now ... i've not seen the film in a while, but i don't recall a guy flying a plane with a fishing rod ... don't flame me if this is what happens, see earlier point regards not seeing the film in ages!! :-p after that, you build the temple in stages, starting with the entrance first, and then the holey floor section with the spears. these spears are just loosely placed into technic holed bricks. quite easy to make em flick out but they can go anywhere! hehe entrance : holey floor & spears : these two parts are hinged and on an angle to each other and the gap makes for a handy bottomless pit, complete with pole for indy to swing over with his whip. after that, you create the door and the ratchet mechanism to keep it raised. after that, you add the runners for the ball and the swinging knives trap. swords trap - before : after : finally, you build the statue that holds the efigy. nice bit of construction here, especially the way that everything falls over once the efigy is removed. do be careful when putting the curved bits on though ... it appears one of the edges on mine has slightly bent when putting it on ... nowt noticable though. temple : preparing to steal : run!! you can see that the temple has toppled and debris has fallen all around ... and then, as he goes through the door, the door falls (he gets his hat) and then the rock ball starts a rolling! ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun!! the stickers were a pain though ... there's no room for a border around the sticker here! beware!! after all that is done, you join all the pieces together and it makes more a really good playset. plenty of opportunity for recreating scenes here! idol closeup : total set : spares : yet more spare stickers??! (sorry, i've already put the spares in my box of bits!) overall, 8 out of 10 ... lots of play value and a pretty nice build. too many stickers though ... and defo poor arms for the skeletons! edited by imperialshadows, 01 june 2008 - 12:18 pm.

1 awesome!!! i want it soo bad!! :'-) how much was it? edited by indy565, 16 december 2007 - 12:55 am.

1 thanks for the review! this is certainly bigger than i expected! can't wait to see your other pics! *y*

1 brickmaster, on dec 16 2007, 01:09 am, said: is the efigy a totally new peice, or is it made of smaller peices with some gold hair attatched? sorry if i missed this :-$ it's 1 moulded piece ... quote nice review, just wish we had some more pics of the built set :-d i'll try again just now ...

0 can you get a close up of the golden idol thingy? looks cool! jifel

0 thanks for the pics cant wait to see more, oh btw when the camera charges could you pleese take a photo of everything falling apart when indy takes the idol? cheers! reveiw on *y*

1 great review!this set has lots of play value i see too bad about the hovito though :'-( one request: -could we get some close up pics of the idol? thanks very much

-1 cool. found it bit disappointed though |-/ ... (not disappointed about the review but the set)

1 wow! i took a peak at the pics in your photobucket, thanks very much! this is a wonderful set, full of details! awesome! :-d *y* *y* ~peace

0 big pete, on dec 15 2007, 06:04 pm, said: ?44.99, as it says in the first line of the review ;-) yes, but i don't live in the uk. any idea how much it might cost in the us?

1 thank you for another excellent review big pete! *y* *y*

0 tinypiesrus, on dec 16 2007, 04:41 am, said: oh, i watched this scene a few weeks ago, and the pilot is fishing while waiting for indy to escape. the enigma that is badger, on dec 16 2007, 05:57 am, said: this is correct, and in pure serial film fashion, the pilot is has just hooked a big one just as jones starts yelling for him to get ready to leave ;-) ahhh ... thanks ... now i want to go out and buy the trilogy on dvd! it's cheap too ... under ?20 for all three at the moment.

0 this set is pretty nice i love the idol id probably buy the set just for that :-d lol is it just me or in the earlier concepts of this set we saw a native on the box? i wonder why they removed it :-( *wacko*

0 i just noticed another inconsistency between box art and the actual set ... on the box, the biplan has white wing supports (they're just plane windows without glass in them) and yet the set they are dark grey (or is it bley ... can never tell the difference without careful study). add to that ... the outer of the engine at the front is white on the box and black in the set. we don't normally have this many inconsistencies do we ?

0 this set is so cool... and another must buy! :-$ i'm in trouble next year it seems... the figs are great! *wub* i think the plane is only ok; perhaps they should have made that in a separate set as it needed to be a certain size to fit the figs, but that meant that the tail is way too short. here is a picture of the actual plane so you can see what i mean. (notice the pilot is fishing... ;-) ) the temple is another story; i think lego have done an incredible job with this, fitting in the key parts of this sequence without making an absurdly large model. addtionally, there are many parts in this set that i haven't got so it shouldn't be too hard to justify. x-d thanks for another great review. *sweet* i love the photo of indy running with the idol and the boulder close behind. :-p naith, on dec 16 2007, 10:20 pm, said: lol is it just me or in the earlier concepts of this set we saw a native on the box? i wonder why they removed it :-( *wacko* i recall that too. :-/ edit: yes there was one... big pete, on dec 16 2007, 11:28 pm, said: we don't normally have this many inconsistencies do we ? quite annoying ones too. i think the plane looks better with those being white.

1 because of exams and other obligations, i haven't posted this sooner. seeing that no-one else has reviewed this set, i thought i might as well do it myself. the set in its entire glory (minus the slammer, instructions and the (obviously) massive sticker sheet) the four cars included in this set; a muscle car, a sports car, a roadster and the police off-roader(!): because the police obviously have no clue that an off-roader is useless for catching street-racers, no less a batmobile-ish sports car, it will always trail behind: but the police have a trick up their sleeve - the drawbridge: gotcha! and the mechanism that makes it all tick: the motor is nothing more than a (slow) pull-back motor. push down the bridge, the latch will hook on to the gear and keep it in place until the latch is released. and there's the new gas station. staying within theme, this gas-station is, like the tanker in 8147, from the company fuel 4 speed: there's a notable presence of detail here, such as the soda-dispenser, water (coolant?) bottles and other accesories, two fuel pumps and bumper-level railings to prevent cars from crashing into them. there's no interior however. and as demonstrated here by a loyal octan-employee and a pursuing officer, the gas station is built to minifig-scale: my impressions of this set: as a collector of tiny turbos, and yet to miss a set, i got this one regardless of what it included. the gas station is indeed very nice, and the minifig-scale accesories were unexpected. the lack of interior is no big issue, and the both the station and bridge can with ease be implemented into a mini-fig town. the bridge also solidly built, and includes the ramps in its design, so it can be lifted, with ramps attached, without breaking apart. the slammer included in the set is identical, apart from the white color, with those in 8147. the cars are also very nice, altough i am yet to get used to the yellow batmobile, as i've grown accustomed to calling it. i also love the off-roader's chunky tires, they make perfect wheels for the newer minifig-scale cars. i never consider price/parts ratio, and here it would, for me, be irrelevant, because it will never be demolished for parts. the play value is what i would consider pretty good, and while the bridge won't rise with a car on it, it's still strong enough to stay open with a car tipping over the edge. hmm. every nerve in my body is saying that this sets is worth roughly 8/10, so: verdict: 8/10 edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 07:01 pm. indexed

1 it looks like a nice set but i'm not interested in the minis, it's got a nice drawbridge though! thanks! *sweet*

0 picked up from the lego shop in bluewater yesterday front of box back of box price ?2.50 gbp contents, a very small instruction manual instructions (front) intsructions (back) 25 pieces (23 used in the model) regular construction mini fig start of the assembly roll in the drum just attach the drum a little tap with the hammer! (hammer not included!) wheel it into position time to start mixing, also time for a well earned tea break, the cement is all ready now. and the 2 left over bits. extra cement is always useful and not really wasted. overall, a nice little set and i am pleased to see little sets appearing again at long last. the only negative is with the drum of the mixer, although the angle can be adjusted you cannot tip the contents out of the mixer. all in all i would say 8/10 for a good little set? comments...? ? ? edit by hobbes: replaced pictures with clickable thumbs and corrected set number.

1 great review and nice touch putting the minifig in the mixer *y* and i think you are the first to review this set so all in all good work. steel...

-1 aww man! i hate that face. it doesn't match any of my other lego heads! in my opinion, it's not even lego-ey.

0 thanks for the review. does anyone know if these mini sets are sold at tru?

1 omg i absolutely love how you reviewed this set, i think you are the only person i've ever seen on eurobrick with such a thorough review. i read eurobricks daily and this really raises the bar in terms of how a person does a review. please do not resize your pics, they are perfect, crisp, large, thorough, and clear; it gives anyone who really wants info on the set just about everything they need to know about it. i had no idea they used that lil "thing" to have the cement mixer spin, cool idea ;-) . nice set, but perfect perfect review. thanks much! x-d

0 thanks for the review, this looks like a nice set to have multiple copies of... i think that you may have mistyped the setnumber, as i was expecting this cute car when i read the title (i wondered how you could see a cementmixer in this set...) :-p

1 heres all the parts in assorted baggies, and the horribly messed up instructions. four astronauts and four aliens, with an extra gold visor (yay!) not bad. the base of the horribly unstable alien craft. the wings move up and down, aswell as back and forth, the purpose i know not. next we build the nerf section of the base. basically technic. and the rest of the tube connectors. heres the farthest i got the little missle to go. its fairly dissapointing. good thing i didnt expect much from this portion of the set. heres the start of the command base. more of the main structure, will be adding lots of things to all the little beams. heres a storage container and the surprisingly not flimsy radar. on this side we see the alien elevator. it uses a horribly long technic rod, i have not seen one of this proportion, its like, a foot and a half long. more of the inner base where all the little tubes shall go. all the connected tubes and such. i also encountered a problem. in the instructions it says for the end of the elevator prong to be touching the tube connector where it is shown here, but mine has a 1x space inbetween. no matter. heres the completed base. + my knee. again. onto the spaceship. the bulk of it is just technic supporting beams, with some large slope peices covering it all up. more on that later. the white coverup. the middle section lifts up to store the overly large jetpack. as you see, the storage containers take up most the bulk in the back, and you can see the jetpack on the ground. aswell as the trigger hand hold thing that allows you to swoosh it. look, in the back! lego greebles! despite the large cockpit, it only holds one person, laying down. the wings are really the saving grace - double layered with a nice two toned effect. kitty nudged me this picture so its abit blurry, my apologies :-| extra peices and or peices i have no idea where the hell they go. :-p overall, the set is quite fun i must admit. full price, i probably would not go for it, but i got it for just under 70 dollars. for that price i can confidently say its quite worth it, many useful peices, nice figures (other than the aliens) and the tube things are quite fun to boot, even though i liked the life on mars system more, which i also have. none the less, its very fun to make them shoot around. alright, so its not much of a command base either, and it looks abit bare. but it's still fun, even if you ignore the nerf section. overall i give it a hardy 3.5 out of 5, the openness and epic fail of a missile launcher are hard to get by, but overall, its a dandy set :-d merry christmas *wub*

1 thanks for this review. lots of minifigs is a plus, although half of them are junk jellies, but dang the base just doesn't seem impressive. it looks so cheap, like a skeleton. the tubes are just ridiculous. but hey, at least it comes with two cool spacecraft, that's nice.

0 i agree, it does seem very scarce, but ive taken apart the nerf launcher, made a new module with the tube the launcher used, and beefed up the base with some computers and other things. for 90 dollars i would pass, i agree. on sale it is lovely, though. and none the less ive been entertained for ages with them flyin through the tubes :-d

0 thanks for the review brickmaster! this set looks nice, i really like the orange (*wub*) and white colour scheme, although the purple of the lom base was very cool too. i only have the lom base, if you have it built could you show a comparison? on an unrelated note, by the time i realised the red and blue hangers on the lom base were for the red and blue mechs, the mechs were no longer in stores. :'-( i was a bit slow, huh? :-p anywho, this is one set i won't be buying, although if the rocket was sold separately i'd get that. :-d thanks again. *y* ~peace

1 set 7741. the box: back: cool pose on back: the insides: the dss: theres acually a printed piece: the new handcuff piece with sb in the back: the finished product: the inventory: police page: the mail page: is this a new air plane?: the fireman page: the back: a future doctor hair piece?: price: 5/5 play: 5/5 overall: 5/5 i *wub* it!!!!!

1 i quite like it, but i feel that my lego city is getting over-run with helicopters and planes. also i have got the helicopter from the 7237 police station set, but it is not as good as this plus i'am sooooo dissapointed that the :-x stickers :-x are blue instead of black and green as they will not fit with the sets i have already got :-d nice review thanks edited by caseyref, 26 december 2007 - 02:04 am.

1 pspguy, on dec 27 2007, 03:08 am, said: what? if your asking how they are but together you snap the window piece into the ho\lder. errr.... no. as brikbitz said on his site in the 7732 postal plane review... quote you can see the traditional airplane window piece, but the bad news is they've changed the window pane. it's the new flat piece used in 4996 beach house, it just doesn't work as well. without the original bevelled edge it doesn't seal the window and there is small noticable gap around the edge. not a major problem but it might get a bit draughty inside and certainly no high altitude flying. i was wondering if it is the old or new type. darth_legois_619, on dec 27 2007, 08:20 am, said: nice review *y* i will get 2 of these at the least especialy since they're going to be $15 aud *wub* :'-) how did you find out the price? if you are right then this is a must buy! *wub*

1 thank you for the great review sandra *y* . i *wub* the detail that tlc added to this set. i would like to add that i think all the buildings look *sweet* . i really like how you compared the look to "back to the future". when i saw the first pics, i thought the same thing. the look of the set is definitly the 1950's. i am :-( to see the price though. i am sure this set will be $149.99 us too. great review, model on!!

1 thank you for the review sandra! this set looks finally nice, better than my first view. i really need it, i've already planed to integrate it to my new layout... it will be hard to wait for it!

1 thank you very much for the wonderful review, legocastlegirl! plenty of pics, thanks again! *wub* *y* ~peace

1 axle, on dec 28 2007, 02:07 pm, said: can you take a picture(s) of all the film posters? there?s no necessity to take pics of all the film posters. there are only 3 different film posters at the set. always one poster twice.. and you can see every different poster at the brickshelf gallery. if you need more details, then you should maybe buy it :-) regards sandra

1 i see the service station has a full arry of tools, oxy/fuel torch and other goodies. not a bad set, still very pricey :-/

1 sorry for answering so late but i was very busy... thanks guys for your comments *y* tedbeard, on dec 28 2007, 08:08 pm, said: sorry to disagree with anyone however, but this was not a great review. i appreciate the effort sandra made but a great review would include more details such as what are stickers and what are printed pieces. a great review points out flaws or limitations as well as what works or is really neat. a great review would have analyzed the price per piece and compared that to other sets/themes. one might look at the recent reviews of the indy sets or the new spongebob sets as examples of really good reviews. the pictures are good but a great review, above all, should provide the reader with some new information, perhaps even answer questions posed in the pre-release discussion thread. i learned nothing new about the set from this review. that said, it was a good review for someone who had not seen the pre-release discussion and she did a good job of showing said person what they could expect in the set. it?s good that you told me your opinion about my review. it was my third review i made and i have to say that i made this review not for analyses, just only to show the eb members some nice pics and to tell them my opinion. lego is fun for me!! i don?t like to analyse the pieces, bricks, prices, colours. i just want to build something. that?s why i?m at eurobricks and not at an other big legocommunity in germany. lego is fun, fun, fun!! and everybody knows that lego is a expensive hobbie.. so why should i write it again and again? julencin2000, on dec 29 2007, 10:07 pm, said: very good review, thanks!!!!!!!! sticker sheet pic with 1 megapixel film posters thanks for the link julencin! ;-) xwingyoda, on dec 29 2007, 10:25 pm, said: ps: @ tedbeard - do tone it down youg man !! if you're not happy with sandra's work, do provide one yourself instead of bitching on how you view a review and on how sandra's post is veryt far from one (according to you !!) *yoda* thanks *yoda* *sweet* copmike, on dec 30 2007, 01:30 pm, said: thanks for the review legocastlegirl - excellent work *y*! i agree with you, the best part seems to be the movietheater!! that?s perfect because i just love to watch movies in the theater, so far this year i?ve seen 46 pictures (and had some pop-corn to ;-)). this is a must-get-set!! town on copmike thanks copmike :-$ so it will be a good year 2008 for you. there?ll be a lot of good movies at cinema next year. i can?t wait for national treasure: book of secrets, the second movie after national treasure with nicolas cage.

1 oh... i want this sooooooo bad!!!

1 kimt, on jan 4 2008, 10:25 am, said: btw: which set would you recommend: market streeet, town plan or cafe corner? just curious. they're pretty expensive and i might only afford one of them. definitely the coffee corner. it?s a hard desicion between coffee corner and town plan, because they are both really great sets. the market street is no "must have" in my opinion. but the other two. maybe you should start with the coffee corner, it?s the older set. the town plan is newer and will be available longer then the coffee corner. i hope it helped you a litte bit :-$ regards sandra edited by legocastlegirl, 04 january 2008 - 10:43 am.

1 this is a great set, lots of detail and that service station and gaspumps do it for me! *sweet* thanks for the review legocastlegirl! *y*

1 xwingyoda, on dec 29 2007, 01:25 pm, said: ps: @ tedbeard - do tone it down youg man !! if you're not happy with sandra's work, do provide one yourself instead of bitching on how you view a review and on how sandra's post is veryt far from one (according to you !!) wow, i have not been called a "youg man" (by which i assume you mean "young") for a while. as a forty year old with three kids that's unusual. *sweet* i tried very hard to remain positive in my critique and complimented her on those things she had done well. i felt that given the somewhat juvenile "omg, best...review...ever" tone that was creeping in amongst the replys, that it needed to be tempered with some thoughtful suggestions as to how a good review could be made great. your ad hominem approach is offensive and far more negative than i was and to suggest i should do my own review is ridiculous. i live in canada and we do not even have the set available here yet thus i am interested in seeing reviews of this set. if i already had the set i would not be so interested. and next time you propose to critique a critique perhaps you should actually read what i wrote. i said she wrote a good review for a specific audience. i did not say it was awful or whatever you seem to have assumed i meant. saying something is good but could be improved can hardly be characterized as "bitching". :-|

1 thanks for the review. i really want this set because: 1. it looks fantastic 2. has harder to find colors 3. is a 50th anniversary commemorative 4. some of the models are based on the 50s sets (i love the old stuff) the tanker truck is a perfect recreation of the old ho 1:87 scale esso tanker truck. i have one, and you can look at it for comparison if you would like. lego ho vehicles i'd like to modify the truck from this new set to look even more like the old esso truck, getting rid of the green and adding some decals.

1 tks will for your great review !! g after reading *vader* 's reviews (of that set and the rs) and yours i really can't wait to get that set and all of the sw sets :-p really nice photography there which is sweet !! *yoda*

1 thanks will! this really is a nice set! your new camera and the backround looks great, the pic quality is very good! thanks!! *y*

1 thanks for the review, mr. mandalorian! this set looks very nice, and it's good to know the nose cone stickers are 2 separate ones, so they don't cross bricks. :-d that camera is working out great for ya'! thanks again! ~peace

1 great review!! i still don't like that cartoon anakin though :-/ excuse me for a sec *runs to local wal-mart to check" :-d buying 08 sets on! p

1 this is a brilliant review of a brilliant set! *sweet* thanks a lot! i know this may be a bit much to ask but could take some pics of the whole instruction booklet? please!!! if you can thanks a bunch. but if not do know of a place where i could find the instructions?

1 thanks, guys! i have the rogue shadow in the review pipes, should be up soon. legolover100, on jan 1 2008, 07:36 pm, said: this is a brilliant review of a brilliant set! *sweet* thanks a lot! i know this may be a bit much to ask but could take some pics of the whole instruction booklet? please!!! if you can thanks a bunch. but if not do know of a place where i could find the instructions? take pics of each page? that is a lot. i don't know of anywhere that might have it. :-/ if you check *vader* 's review, he has a lot of pics of the build, that might work just as well. will

1 darn! if i would have known noone has reviewed this i would have! thanks! *sweet* *y*

1 thanks for the review agentrick57. it is a beautiful set, and quite cheap for me; $50 aud for 965 parts! 8-? not sure what i will do with the rabbit though; it is huge! :-d (i was considering doing this review myself but sinnerton is a mess... :-/ )

1 thanks for the good review, i wish i had bought one when it was going for only ?24.99 on lsah instead of the usual price of ?50!

1 i got that set from my grandma on x-mas. she ordered it early. i really like the presesnts and that blue thing. 3 wheeler? here in america, it's 100$$. ouch. i like the rabbit. whats with the rats in the trees and the cargo train? nice review. edited by ~vbbn~, 04 january 2008 - 01:31 pm.

1 dang it, i meant to try to get one of these after christmas ... i knew they were half-off at s@h and i just forgot. now they're sold out. darn! thanks for the review!

1 this is a nice set x-o i managed to get 6 of em' before thay sold out :-$

0 blah. i wanted one of these at half off but i forgot and missed out. thanks for the review though :-$

1 i was fortunate enough to get one along with the hobby train. they are the first trains i have ever owned (mainly by virtue of them having been half price). it's a fantastic selection of parts with the holiday train, as well as it really looking the part as a set. i'm happy not to get a motor; as i think the 9v setup would prove expensive, and the ir control system for the rc setup seems a bit poor. i got some "dead" track for with it to have just as a push train for now.

1 got one for 90 usd, one of the best trains ever..funny as train, perfect for parts. what else to say. *y*

1 okie guys and gals, here s time for some droid exploration with my review of set 7670. as a general statement i have to say its really a neat set that is not that expensive for what it holds. 1) box art like always i will start with pics of the box art. btw, notice anything guys ? no bloody crappy dss. yes, finally a set without stickers and that feels great :-d 2) the mfs nothing really spectacular there. the only novelty lies within the inclusion of the new commander (yellow torso) bd. apart from that, there are 2 bds and unfortunately yet another sbd (i like those but i have a huge amount of them, and i would rather had something different). you have 3 short blasters and a couple of extra parts. 3) the spider droid i think it?s a pretty cool little buggar. it?s a rather simple yet classic construction i think. it has sweet parts such as the bd body in dark bley. it really has a spider feel unlike the previous ep3 one. 4) the hailfire droid this baby represents the ?pi?ce de resistance? of this set. i truly love it !! sure it?s a bit under scale but i don?t really mind that. its conception is superb even if i totally dislike assembling those technic treads (especially 80 of those small things). the ellipse of the treads is well balanced and that trans disc is a brilliant idea. the great thing is those new flick fire missiles: they don?t fall unlike the other ones and they do look good on this baby. also you can put the wheels together and the missiles to gain some shelf space (easy storage on :-d ) in conclusion those druids re really sweet and are perfect target practice for the upcoming rgs hehe !! i hope you enjoyed that review and do not hesitate to comment and ask pic requests if any ;-) *yoda*

1 hey, thanks for the review! i think i will definately get this set! dp8 edited by darthperson8, 05 january 2008 - 03:30 pm.

0 sorry yoda. i think it might of been my problem. :-$ either way i edited my first post. dp8

1 xwingyoda, on jan 5 2008, 04:24 pm, said: i totally dislike assembling those technic treads (especially 80 of those small things). so you haven't build the bat tank, right? it comes with 2x 79 thread pieces... *wacko* ;-) thanks for the review, i'll definitively get this set (maybe monday :'-) ), love those droids *wub*

1 i totally like this set *wub*! i bought it some days ago ,it looks really nice together with the mtt. and i am going to get the at-ap today. *sweet* edited by stealth hunter, 05 january 2008 - 04:44 pm.

0 xwingyoda, on jan 5 2008, 04:24 pm, said: in conclusion those druids re really sweet and are perfect target practice for the upcoming rgs hehe !! a druid battle pack would also be a nice idea for the castle sets. thank for the nice review with many pictures. may i ask what you paid for this? my first (and second) idea was that 25 euro was a bit to much for this. :-)

0 they released the battle droid commander in 2000 :-|

1 yeah finally *yoda* got his sw :-d i got 2 of them after x mas - they are really cool - especially the spider droid! 2 of them on! & happy *yoda* on :-p edited by aayla-secura, 05 january 2008 - 10:38 pm.

0 you thought the bat tank was bad, the tie crawler has 81 for each of the sides *sing*. and don't get me started on the sand crawler! :-x

0 nice review! and you finally got an 08 set! i haven't gotten any, i blame wal-mart for putting products out late |-/ :-d instead of a sbd, tlc should have included a droideka(new version) *y* the scale is a bit off, so this is a dwarf hailfire droid :-p p

0 thanks for the reveiw, i've got one of these and an at-ap in the mail hopefully arriveing tomorrow :-) edited by legoman, 06 january 2008 - 12:15 am.

0 great review mate as usual, for me the highlight of this set has to be the new spider droid. even though it's made up of some strange parts it really appeals to me, i would love a few of those babys. the hellfire droid is also well put together even if it is a little small, but hey it looks fun. i really like the look of this set but the price tag really puts me off, why oh why did lego price it so high.... :'-(

0 great review very precise. as for the spider droid construction, i have already worked it into a moc: http://www.brickshel...ry.cgi?f=290980 stryker-single gun hydra-seven guns hammer-missile pods. steel...

1 i got this set for a few months [1 or 2].. and i agree that it is small.. but still.. it looks great on plates, clone troopers [just for fun..] >:-)

0 my hailfire droid is gonna be coming in the mail soon, as well as the battlepacks.

1 great review yoda. thanks for sharing. i wasn't real fond of the postal truck at first. it's so different than those in the us. but after seeing your close-up images (esp. the back of the tuck), it looks really neat. i also like the mail box a lot. it looks good in red. too bad for the stickers, but it's still nice. the plane reminds me a lot of the design used in the jurassic park set. as you've said, it's similar to 80s designs. i really like the brick-built design too. it's just real lego - that's about all i can say. very nice sets that are a must together. thanks for the review.

1 i haven't spotted these in the us yet. i'm looking forward to finding them. overall, the 2008 line-up is a excellent and it's going to be difficult for me to decide which themes/sets to pursue. there's a lot to choose from.

1 nice review yoda i dont think i have ever read one with as much cursing of stickers! :-d i love these two little sets, the colour scheme the little different wheels on the post van and of course the new postmen uniforms! would have been nice if they had included little satchels like in the new indiana jones sets, oh well! ;-) postman yoda on! *yoda*

1 aww man, is tlc really getting too cheap for printed parts? shame on you tlc!! despite those stickers these are two really neat sets. especially the airplane. classic *wub* reminds me of that little plane my dad bought in an airplane. not sure what's the set nr.. the window at the rear of the van looks like a normal window frame without the clips for the shutters. i never knew those existed 8-? might come handy for ship building. thanks for the review yoda!

1 thank you for the nice review pity of the stickers but the design is nice 80ies on!

0 thanks for the review! i was always going to get these two sets, so you haven't swayed me at all!! x-d i reckon lego could enhance this sub-theme by releasing a post motorbike (with or without a sidecar) and post office. obviouly the office would be the hub of all the activity, while the post bike would take care of the postal run. this would free up the van to take or recieve bulk mail or parcels to or from the airport. it could then also do the parcel deliveries around the city. the office would also serve as the reciever for all the parcels the new goods truck might deliver. just some thoughts, that's all!! *sweet*

0 i need to do some catching up here :-p matn, on jan 5 2008, 05:16 pm, said: could you tell me how much you payed for them? i think i'm gonna buy them tomorrow if they have it already (or if i don't see any cooler sets). i paid a tad more than the s@h price: i paid 15 for the plane and 8 for the van (sure its a tad more expensive but i didn't want to wait for tru to get them) freddie, on jan 5 2008, 06:10 pm, said: am i the first one to notice the new doors used in the back of the van. not only is it using the popular new frame, but the old container doors have been redesigned to fit with the new frame as well. pity they're not yellow, though. great remark there, i guess i totally missed that one :-$ and i agree that yellow doors would have been better but those dark bley do not look that bad !! mr hobbles, on jan 5 2008, 09:10 pm, said: can you tell me though, the wheels on the van, are they rubber or plastic? they look a bit tacky... rubber off course ;-) they do look a tad tacky but its because they are the thin type (like with the racers) and i am not a fan of those |-/ phoinix, on jan 5 2008, 09:35 pm, said: cant wait for your next one tks ;-) me neither though :-p marvinblue, on jan 6 2008, 03:31 am, said: i reckon lego could enhance this sub-theme by releasing a post motorbike (with or without a sidecar) and post office. obviouly the office would be the hub of all the activity, while the post bike would take care of the postal run. this would free up the van to take or recieve bulk mail or parcels to or from the airport. it could then also do the parcel deliveries around the city. the office would also serve as the reciever for all the parcels the new goods truck might deliver. so true 8-? at one point i was thinking of a impulse set with a yellow bike, postman, post and letters (that would rock !!). i hope tlc adds to this sub theme and keeps that retro feel *wub* a yellow dirtbike with sidecar would be a sweet 5? set !! also a small town feel post office would be so cool: like a 20/30? set ;-) we can be sure of one thing though, this year's advent calendar will have a postamn and small post office ;-) post on !! *yoda*

1 thanks for the review :-) i was actually considering getting these, but i saw they were overpriced for my tastes - too bad, theyre nifty lil things *wub*

1 loool : spielberg goes on a career change :-d these are some nice sets. i really love that car. looks sleek

1 thanks for a nice review and few comments to sets: nice airplane, finally some reminiscence for lego city golden era (for me years 1982-1992). everything is nice, but two things are freezing a smile on my face. first of all the ugly new hinge used for plane roof. i have already 4032 and those new hinges are looking really terrible when compared f.e. with 6368. second one is new minifig, i don?t know what i expected, but this torso design looks too simple and too cheap.. concerning new car - i appreciate fact, that tlc makes after long long years again postal sets, but i don?t like those new-style cars. matchbox wheels and bad rate between drivers cockpit and cargo space are damping me from buying. 6651 mail truck or 105 canada post truck were much better... edited by kanal-k1, 06 january 2008 - 07:33 pm.

0 while the plane does look nice, i don't particularly care for the van. but the van does have some good parts, which is the only reason i would by one: yellow mud guards, the new windshield, and the small door on the rear.

-1 well first off, thanks yoda for the great review. :-) hmmm... well, i have to say, i'm not at all impressed with any of these sets. i mean, there nice and all, but the van just seems way to small. it would have been nice if you could fit more than one package in it. i guessi'm one of those that are more of the fan of the 6 wide trucks. and the plane.... hm. this has a "cute" factor and all, but i mean com'on... you have to open a hatch on the roof to get your packages in?? and what about getting them out? you have to flip the plane upside down? :-| weak. they should have had a hinged rear end or a hatch on the side.

0 thebrickster, on jan 5 2008, 10:12 am, said: i wasn't real fond of the postal truck at first. it's so different than those in the us. good point b... this design is just too foreign to my eyes for me to enjoy... i don't like either of these sets, very disapointing - the postal theme has so much potential. i don't really like the torsos either - too plain/cheap as kanal suggested. and i will agree that the wheels on the van look cheap. i was sooooo impressed with city 2007, this is a real let down. though, i am happy to see a small set with a postal box. so, even though, all that aside, i'll probably buy 6 of the van - just for the yellow mudgards, postal box and stickers to populate my city. and i think this set will provide some excellent piece to moc a yellow civillian convertable with *sweet* - bm

0 i'm glad to see the mail van has the doors that used to be on the older cargo containers. i had given up on those older ones, but now that they're still out there, i may invest in the older cargo system instead of the new 6-wide ones. both sets are good enough, i'll get both. i'm hoping for a postal building too, even though i have the smaller of the old post offices. a nice big modern one would be great. i'm not too hung up about the design of the plane; i've got the neat old cargo plane with the tail that swings open (one of the best plane sets) for big packages. the truck is goofy looking, but if i get sick of looking at it i can rebuild it into a classic looking one. great review by the way, the pictures are some of the better one i've seen in a review recently.

0 thanks *yoda* for the great reviews. i love the airplane, it's really cute. the van needed to grow on me though but you did the trick. i don't like the wheels of the van. they will need replacing. and wouldn't everything have been better if they were completely red? dr. brick

1 hey everyone, my first 2008 set is this one, 5613. i thought i'd share a review of it. *sweet* i'd like to say sorry about my photos, they were taken quickly. first, we have the box: it is the smallest lego box i've ever seen, and actually looks cute *wub* it will be heavy competition with playmobil's specials... back of the box, showing an action pose: the contents of the little box, with a very tiny instruction manual *wub* the manual unfolded. notice that every part has its part number beside it :-) the back of the manual, showing some fire sets and the other impulse sets the parts, 30 in total: the small set built. the firefighter has a small fire to extinquish, armed with an axe, chainsaw, other saw and foam... psssh thing x-d . five extra parts in a 30 part set! we get an extra black hatchet, yellow bar tap, light bley 1*1 plate, red 1*1 plate modified with fingers and 2*2 dark bley radar dish. besides the plate, i've never seen these as reserve parts... but i'm not complaining x-d here is a small "alternate" model i created with it: a small bbq... what? he's hungry and he needs to put something on the bbq >:-) x-d overall, you can't go wrong with these impulse sets. i paid 2.89 euros for this little set, so thats a great value! sadly the only impulse avaible were these 3 city sets (no police) and the alien mars mission... looking forward to the knight and magician as well as those indy sets! tt

0 darthperson8, on jan 5 2008, 11:02 pm, said: cool! finally its an entire line i can actually afford to own every set! :-d i can't wait to get my hands on them! if its possible, could you give us the demensions of the box? it would be apprectiated. *y* dp8 9.3 cm by 9.3 cm by 4.5 cm x-d tt

1 nice set and review. what i really like is that this set gives you a lot of ideas for your own houses (mocs)? kimt

1 thanks for that really nice review dunamis! now it is even more harder for me to wait for this set. i hope my legostore will get it tomorrow!! it is really nice. i?m a really big fan of the creator houses.. but that one is now the best one for me!!! i love the colour of it and of course the windows at the roof. *wub* creator house on!!! greetings sandra

1 love this set now more than ever. *wub* i knew i wanted it from the first leaked boxshots, especially with my love of yellow buildings (just ask hinckley ;-) ). great review, especially nice to see the closeup parts shots. those new 2x2 white windows are very much like replacements for the classic 2x2 windows tlg stopped regularly making a while back, so it's great to see them. the wheels are trolley wheels, common in sets including stretchers and handcarts. the holder for them is a fairly recent part i think. i remember a couple coming in a little single minifig jet engine repair set i picked up in a s@h order within the last year. oh honey, be sure to wrench that chicken before it burns! *wacko* thanks for another excellent review of a set i'm even more excited about than before! *y*

1 thanks for the review! i definitely plan on getting this one. thanks again! *sweet*

1 thank you for the nice review with many pictures. *y* :-d i already wanted this set, but the pictures make it i want even much/more.

1 another great review from dunamis thanks! i will get it if i can find it on sale!!

1 thank you for the great review. i think, i?ll get 2 of these sets, so i can have the beach house and the caf? in my city. *sweet* dunamis, on jan 7 2008, 10:35 am, said: i did see a few pieces that i was not familiar with so i?m going to show them below. keep in mind i?m not a parts jockey so bear with me if i think a part is brand new for 2008 and it was actually released with the classic space line. ... i know these are common, but didn?t they have four studs on top? these only have two: how about this sloped 4x3 window that opens: as for the fence: i know only the 2-stud version. 8-| and the window was used a lot in the 80s and 90s (even in the 2004 city airport). don?t worry, i?m not complaining. it just came to my mind, because today i rebuild my 7866 (from 1983), which had 2 of these babys. >:-)

1 thanks for this great review! i love this awesome set, the creator line never disappoints. this is definitely a must-buy for me, just like the other creator houses. batbrick something! *wacko*

1 thanks for the great review! very in depth! *y* *y* those wheel pieces are quite old by the way, i have 1 from some time ago. ~peace

0 hey, yesterday i got around to mod my beachhouse too! i bought two boxes so i could have enough material for an extra floor and then i also added a kitchen, a vine in the backyard, storage for the upper floor... try to spot the humongous flatscreen tv! http://www.brickshel...96/cimg2656.jpg edited by takuto20, 23 march 2008 - 02:17 pm.

1 very nice! i have been debating on whether or not to buy it-it would appear you made up my mind for me! *y*

1 looks like i'll need to buy another one i just started the garage (which is attached to the house) but i ran out of yellow bricks........... :'-( >:-( btw nice moc takuto20 *y* i might have to "steal" your idea and make a third story since its abit tight downstairs to fit everything.......ooo yea and i like your kitchen and the dishwasher :'-) ....... edited by darth_legois_619, 23 march 2008 - 11:00 pm.

1 thanks for the review dunamis, this is a great little set! i'm also very impressed with takuto20's mods. i've been trying a few of my own. i liked the tower block design, but a lot of stuff needed fixing. firstly i added a 4th wall, and made it so the storeys could be lifted off like in the other models. i also added flowers on the windowsills and doorways out on to the balconies. still to be added is an extra door for the top floor which i'm going to get from the new doors and windows pack. i added a chimney that goes all the way up the back of the house, and has a fireplace on every level. each floor is fully furnished with a fireplace, wash basin and bed on the upper levels... ...and a corner sofa and coffee table, plus an extra large fireplace on the ground floor. finally here is my idea of what to do with two copies of this set! all the parts pictured are from 2x 4996, except 5 extra fence panels and the minifigs. the house on the left has it's garden at the rear.

-1 ah great review kanal-k1 (and welcome to eb! :-d ), i was waiting for one of this set. not that i was expecting anything good, i won't buy it. i agree with thr playability, it does seem weak. what can you do with it. swoosh it? :-/ big step backwards lego... :-( dr. brick

-1 i think this is one to leave on the shelf with the giant dump truck of 2006 and the hovercraft of 2007!

-1 a big thumbs down for me. this doesn't look like lego at all :-| *n* *n* *n* *n* *n* out of *n* *n* *n* *n* *n*

-1 howly cow! this is *y* *y* *y* for you for making a review so fast! thank you so much. hope it keeps a lot of people from buying. :-| kanal-k1, on jan 16 2008, 09:26 pm, said: when i saw the way, how is this plane made, i was strongly thinking to play money for nothing from dire straits as a music accordant with whole set. :-d lol! :-d , great comment! kanal-k1, on jan 16 2008, 09:26 pm, said: this is my first plane in this scale and for 99% the last one. this will never be my first or last plane and that for 100% :-x 7723 crap plane off!

-1 thanks for the review, but its an utter pass for me on this one - i already have a huge juniorized plane from the airport set - one is enough for me! :-$

-1 i have the big passenger plane so i'll be passing on this one. one big juniorised plane is enough for me! if i didn't have the passenger plane though i'd rather get the cargo plane. there's enough police in my city as it is!

-1 thanks for the review! *sweet* i am stunned at the lack of an interior... not that it makes much difference as i wasn't likely to want this set anyway as i own the passenger plane from last year. sorry to steal your image, but i just had to post this! :-p

0 thks for this caustic review :-d i'll wait for the parts on bricklink. i think you're a bit unfair with this small oversized submarine - oups sorry, i mean plane. here are some advantages i tried to imagine : 1. that's the first submarine with a plane nose, 2. that's the first unprinted nose, 3. that's the first shark that make me laugh, and which has a plain white fin 4. and at last, you should have notice that that the first submarine with a wing made of several plates it is said that this set has more than 200 parts... hide and seek ! x-d you may have lost several bags i'm eager that people buy this set a lot : i'd like to buy a lot of these new white 4x4x2 curved slope for my mocs. can you take a picture of the plane crashing in the sink ? is it fire proof ? i think that will be too easy this year to decide what is the crap of year ...

-1 thanks for the review, unfortunately the pictures did not load for me! i have to say having seen other images, i do agree with your comments, the plane is far to big, and not enough details. that sums it up for me!

-1 i'll probably get the nice green cargo plane. but not this. how can the same hull pieces be used for full size jets and what's supposed to be a small seaplane.

-1 legoman132, on sep 11 2008, 07:26 pm, said: this still looks like a cool set but the price not so much. do all lego police set come with the polizei option or just ones from europe i have not bought a police set in years. legoman, why are you kicking a topic from the beginning of this year with such an irrelevant reply after all?!

1 legoman132, on sep 11 2008, 06:26 pm, said: this still looks like a cool set but the price not so much. the price is now 20 in ireland on s@h, which is reasonable considering the large fuselage pieces. has anyone modded this set to make a reasonable looking plane? i am thinking of buy it to do so, but i don't want to take a risk and end up with lots of useless pieces. aswell as -20.

1 an excellent first time (?) review iamded! *y* well, atleast a first time redman review anyway. i really enjoy redman, i hope to see him pop up more often. your pics are great now that you ditched the phone :-p , and you've shown the set from many different angles and perspectives. thanks for this brilliant review, you have certainly convinced me to get a few of these, and then some x-d redman on! edit: btw, is it just me, or does my new avatar make me seem a bit creepy? 8-| batbrick is back! >:-) edited by batbrick, 18 january 2008 - 12:39 pm.

1 nice review, iamded. i'd better go and check toyworld tommorrow *sweet* shame about the price though, only 3 more dollars to get crossbow attack :-( iamded, on jan 19 2008, 12:44 am, said: and here we see the nifty little structure of the thing. it can even support a whole minifig! :-d batbrick, on jan 19 2008, 01:36 am, said: edit: btw, is it just me, or does my new avatar make me seem a bit creepy? 8-| batbrick, you've always been a bit creepy :-p x-d

0 very good reviews, i think that redman is really ok, a very little cute curious fig... sadly he is not in the impulse set... ;-) i wish to see redman still around about your creepy avatar, yes, it look a bit creepy *skull* nausicaakro (this impulse set is storage in 8 copies, with 8 wizard set, 16 city set (2x), 16 mission to mars set... so if you want buy 10 of this (like me) you must find 2 different toy center)

1 you should continue with these redman reviews there great!!!

1 nice review, very detailed. *y* as for the spare parts, mine didn't come with any. both dark grey 1x1 round plates are used on the weapons rack (one for the armour, one for the helmet) and i only got one robot hand for holding weapons.

1 thanks everyone for your positive feedback, it's really appreciated! :-d you'd be surprised how long that 'redman presents' thing up the top took me to make! x-d so, it appears people do like redman, expect him to be reviewing the good wizard and battle arachnoid in near future!

1 nice review. *sweet* this is a must buy for me since i *wub* the new sand green giant troll! now i just have to wait until it's available in the us :'-( general tarful

1 thanks for the review *vader*! the first picture of the troll is great, the gold armour really shines! x-d a fantastic set, i'll definitely get a couple of these! *wub* as for the ogres/'giant trolls', the dark tan one fits in the mine setting well, but for above ground, settings, i prefer the sand green one. *y* ~peace edited by iamded, 19 january 2008 - 10:21 am.

1 thanks for that vader, i love this helmet *wub* it will certainly work great as an asian dynasty war helm i reckon. thanks again. batbrick is back! >:-)

1 this is fantastic, i love the new helmets for the goblins *sweet* i've always loved the chicken leg thing, really screams lego to me! at least how lego used to be :'-( great little bit the goblins are awesome too, and the sand green one should look good next to the tan ones...gives a nice feeling of a real species. in reality not all members of a species are identical, it's great seeing them in different colors. great review x-d

1 thank you for the review, vader! that set looks worth buying! 8-? i think you gave me a good reason to buy it... ;-)

-1 great review, vader :-) as i've said before, this is a nice set, but doesn't really come with anything that doesn't come with the other sets of the line. for this reason, it will be somewhere at the bottom of my list for 2008. also, i like torso and helmet of the dwarf mining orcs much better. the colours make the torso look rather dull and boring, while the other, more brown one, looks much clearer and more exciting. i think i like the *knight* helmet better too, looks more covering and threatening than this one, although i'll save my judgement until i have one in my hands. thanks again vader ;-) edit: forgot to mention, hilarious pic in your sig, vader :-d edited by tinypiesrus, 19 january 2008 - 08:28 am.

-1 a troll driven by a turkey leg, what a wonderful little detail!!! :-d :-d thanks for the review vader. very clever, using a flag to hide that crazy firing device. i find it rather odd they used blue pins for this. black or gray would've been alot more discrete. about the big trolls, i think using different colours is good. i don't think a troll force would be very organized, so different colours would make the effect complete *y* . as for your troops, looks quite fearsome! definitely compared to my pathetic number of soldiers.. :-$ a nice set, but i would rather get the attack on tower though.. no matter about the price difference.

1 vader, on jan 19 2008, 12:45 am, said: here's a few quick shots of the 2 larger trolls we have so far, i prefer the sand green one. nice comparison shot, judging from these pics, i think i have to agree with you that green suits the troll better. especially since the orcs are sand green as well, indicating some relation between the two races (if they are indeed separate races). great review, very detailed and with lots of pictures. i was already interested in this set, but after reading your review i want this set for sure! *y*

0 xwingyoda, on jan 22 2008, 04:26 pm, said: tks for the review mate ;-) now i have to bloody wait long because lego france has this line available in freaking march >:-( pissed *yoda* on !! :-d i love the "new" goblin :-p that helmet is really cool. why on earth tlc didn't include that one in the dwarf mine ? such another idiotic move |-/ anyone keeping track of tlc's stupidity lately ? that would be interesting !! i clearly want a huge goblin army now hehe !! and i totally agree with you mate, the troll lokks better in sand green. the cart itself is pretty lame imo - just a sordid excuse to include yet another annoying shooting crappy device. but for a 21? set its okie i say ;-) need my bad guys on !! *yoda* i believe there is a topic around here somewhere based on bad lego ideas. after getting this new helmet i really wish lego had included it with the mining set, it's bloody annoying having to buy yet more of them from bl :'-( the shooting bit is better than some sets that have had one, at least this one is smartly done and of course it can also be hidden.

0 thanks for the review of a set i would otherwise probably have passed on. out of curiosity how did you 'know it was for you'? you seem to be building quite a collection. why castle now? was the fantasy element all it took? just curious. thanks again and god bless, nathan

1 lego city truck & forklift set # 7733 pieces: 343 price: $24.99 (usd) store of purchase: toys r'us release date: january 2008 after discussion of the mysterious yellow cargo contained in this new city transport set and a visit to my local tru, i purchased this set. i was immediately pleased with the price/piece which i think is pretty reasonable (343 pieces for $25). starting with the box, great city artwork boasting "special edition": tha backside of the box (no alternate models comes as no surprise): the dreaded decals (i was looking for the skull and bones for radioactive, but no such luck): my favorite part of the set, a very clever forklift: side view: and the backside: what i like about the forklift is the bars across the top giving the vehicle a "real-life" design. the double wheels in the front with two pieces that can hold the wheels also adds to a clever design: i like the figs (although not much new - perhaps i'll make the driver into a werewolf later): the set includes three cargo pallets, the first some sort of fuel with gauge: the 2nd, two indy containers, and a square 2x4 brick (i have not put the decals on yet): and the mysterious yellow cargo. your guess is as good as mine :-$ . on to the truck, the front section: the front grill: another angle: the back: i like the opening mechanism that is very simple, but works well. also is the large plate tile piece inside. i like this because the entire interior has no studs: and the trailer section of the truck: orange and yellow tail lights: and the rear trailer open: the complete set: summary: this is a neat set that reminds me a bit of classic lego city (but larger). it is very playable and has a lot of accessories adding to the value. the build was very simple, and enjoyable (took me about an hour). it is a great addition to a number of city sets including the cargo ship, container stacker, the world city cargo train, and the new cargo plane. as i mentioned previously, i have not yet put on the decals that i'm sure will really add to the overall look of the set. the forklift is awesome and i like the cargo containers. the truck could have benefited from a few additional details (chrome smokers, and an undercarriage box that really opens). considering everything, i would buy this set again. hope you enjoy and perhaps this mysterious cargo will make its way into a brickster mystery. *y*

0 adik_sa_lego, on jan 18 2008, 11:57 pm, said: question: what's different with this "special edition"? btw, nice shots! im guessing the main difference is the fact that the box says special edition.

1 thanks for the review! that forklift is wonderful! *wub* i may have to pick this one up convince dragonator to pick this one up! :-d too bad it can only hold 1 crate. :-/ ~peace

0 agentrick57, on jan 18 2008, 09:48 pm, said: can th doors be opened on either side? no, just one side. i'm not sure why the "special edition". it appears to be the same set as lego sah?

1 wow, 8-? great review. *y* i usually don't buy city sets but i think i might get this one just for that awsome forklift! *wub* general tarful

0 i'm curious, for those of you who are not into city sets and want this set for the forklift, what would you use it for?

0 ,

0 mr tiber, on jan 19 2008, 10:26 am, said: hmmm, put it in my pirate port and use it to carry rum! perhaps that's the mysterious cargo. mr. tiber replaced the petro with rum... :-d

-1 thank you very much for your nice review, the brickster! *y* although i really like this set i?m sooo disappointed about the big "on the cabin" brick :-x , that i probably won?t buy it. tlc could easiliy have done so much better with bricks already in use, like these: or or no, that juniorized part is a thorn in my side. >:-( but i have use for those new canisters. *wub*

0 thanks for the review. i think the special edition is just for making people intrested and make them want to buy that set or something.

0 some guy, on jan 19 2008, 11:17 pm, said: i think the special edition is just for making people intrested and make them want to buy that set or something. hmm, that's a thought, but why would they pick this particular set? i would expect they'd do that with a slightly bigger set, like the heavy hauler perhaps. why do you think they'de pick this one?

1 this set looks pretty good to me, it is six wide isn't it? that is nice for a truck like this

-1 highlandcattle, on jan 20 2008, 09:15 am, said: this set looks pretty good to me, it is six wide isn't it? that is nice for a truck like this yes, 6-wide. the only problem with these big trucks is how they look on the city roadplates (i've always thought too big), compared to classic city trucks. getting off topic, i'd like to see lego make a car transport truck. i don't think i've ever seen one in lego. it would definately have to be 6-wide, or even larger.

0 ricecracker, on jan 21 2008, 05:28 pm, said: hey, thanks for the review the brickster! i was just wondering if you could possibly upload a picture of the instructions for the forklift, and, if possible, tell me the piece # of the 1x4 slope bricks (to bricklink them). thanks! i don't have a scanner for the instructions, but the 1x4 slope is listed as piece #4515362 in the instructions.

1 greetings, and welcome to another redman review! i'm your host, redman, and today i adorn my medieval outfit to tell you about the impulse set simply titled "the knight". no wait, that's the old script. x-d i mean, "the good wizard". *sweet* the other castle impulse set (the first being 'the knight'), this is a wonderful, and in my case unexpected addition to the castle line! i did not expect to get a nice good wizard, but rather another plain white skellie for the impulse, and was pleasantly surprised when i saw the first picture of this set. the impulse sets give you pieces you wouldn't expect to see in such small sets, for example, the knight came with the armour, and this comes with an owl, a gem, and a crystal ball piece. it comes with 11 pieces, including the wand, owl, and gem, and no spares, which doesn't really matter as it doesn't need any. the box sports the set number, age range (which i blissfully ignore x-d), awesome castle logo, and the assembled set, with the usual 1:1 scale picture of a minifig. the back of the box shows pictures of the boxed skeleton tower and king's castle siege sets. note the price is in new zealand dollars, and is really the same prica as any other impulse set. next are the instructions, which are separated into 3 parts, 1 for the minifigure, 1 for the table, and one for the bird stand. very simple, also worth mentioning is the parts numbers are next to their respective parts, for replacement parts etc. on the back we see (on the top half) pictures of skeleton prison carriage, skeleton tower, and king's castle siege, this time not of the boxed sets, but the sets themselves. on the lower half we have 8 pictures, each of the different impulse sets. the wizard's torso is plain sand blue, with no patterns or anything, but it doesn't really matter is his beard's in the way. ;-) the head is that same old 'white fade to grey beard' head, but the white beard covers up most of the grey. my favourite part is the pants, i love that we're getting printed belts and legs again. his belt has 4 gold crosses (as seen in, if you look closely, the new crownie's torso and the crownie archer's torso) and a belt buckle, and the legs have a bottle, a coin, and a small bag. nice little wizard-ey items. the, er, items, no, accessories, no, models? the stuff in the set include a little stand for the owl, and a table utilising the new 4x4 round piece in light bley, with the crystal ball in the middle, encasing the yellow gem held on by a 2x2 circle piece in blue. why blue, i'm not sure. maybe it's because the crystal is yellow, and the crownie's colours are blue and gold, so the blue piece with the yellow crystal symbolise the crownie's colours. or maybe tlc just felt the need to include an odd colour. :-p in conclusion, this is a wonderful set, with some neat accessories, and it doesn't really need to be bought in the masses, after all, you needs an army of owls and wizards? :-| :-p so it works fine as a single set, and adds a more fantasy feel to your crownie army. that's all for today folks! *sweet* [/redman] thanks for reading another of my redman interviews, any suggestions on how to/what to do to improve it is greatly appreciated, as are all comments and criticisms (except those blatant thoughtless criticisms that don't help at all :-p)! ~peace edited by kimt, 10 august 2008 - 01:31 pm.

1 nice review, your camera is much better now. i look forward to more of your reviews :-) i just went to toyworld today and got a wizard and 4 knights :-) and on top of that, they were having a 20% off sale *sweet* i might go back and get some more tommorrow. the wizard is pretty good, and comes with some good parts (owl, beard, legs, hat, round table, crystal ball..). it would be nicer if he had a torso with printing on it, but i can understand why they didn't.

0 simonwillems, on jan 20 2008, 02:59 pm, said: thanks for the review of this nice little set. for it's price (3 euros here in holland) it contains quite a lot of useful parts. the only thing that could have been better in my opinion is the wand, i always liked this one: i miss those wands! they could've used it, but i think the wood wand kindda adds "realis" to the set, and since many fans don't like their castle theme to be too fantasized, i guess lego decided to use a mold that was still being used for various sets. when i get this set i'm going to put it on the tower in the king's castle, you know, the one that is right above the throne room? ;-) that'll be a great spot, and then i'll finally have all the necessary characters, the king in his throne, the knights on the walls, the wizard on his tower top, and the princess in her tower room that floats in mid air and is connected to the throne room by a 2-stud wide bridge! :-d i love the king;s castle siege set *wub*

1 yay! more redman! probably going to get one of these and turn it into a carnival attraction.

0 not bad. i could see picking up a couple of these guys along with a few of the new knights. i actually prefer the wizard as these impulse items are simply too expensive for army building (imo). later.

1 well, since no-one seems to have done one for this set, here we go.... here's the complete set in all its glory. yes, i really like it, but then, tabletown has the capacity to support it and my green army have their eyes on it as a potential military transport as well. :-) i'll start out with the little airport ground car thingy - very neat and functional, here are views front and back: next up, the steps which allow the plane crew to embark and disembark: and to round off this little trio, the cargo loading platform, here in its lowered position. note the prong thingy sticking out from the rear: and here raised. the prong thingy is now hinged up to support the back of the platform and keep it level: here's a slightly different angle so you can see the pieces under there: the all-important cargo itself! hmmm...not much for a plane this size... the cargo pallet slots neatly onto the loading platform: here's the complete set of ground equipment - all attached: and so onto the plane itself. note that unlike the other large planes, the main wing sits at the top of the row of bricks making up the side of the fuselage: i took it apart a little so you can see the internal construction of the fuselage. note that the cargo area is really small, right at the back. what else is this thing carrying? illegal immigrants? :-) a picture of the rear of the fuselage, just because i like the sticker: front landing gear. way better than on the other large planes. i don't know if this is a new piece or what but i've had no problems with it at all, and my kids have been playing with it as well: the rather sexy rear undercarriage - this area reminds me of one of those giant russian transport planes - wicked: those angled grey slopes atop each side of the rear undercarriage annoy the heck out of me as they keep coming off whenever i pick the plane up. i think a 1x4 plate on top to bind them together might solve that. a slightly blurry view (sorry) from underneath. the gear looks like it might be capable of retracting internally, but alas, no. this is a shame as there's certainly enough room in there and it's a wasted opportunity imo. might have to modify that... a view of one of the four engines, i personally think they look too small and should have something under the wing as well to make them rounder: cockpit: crew door, open. i love the smooth action of these doors and the way they seal flush against the fuselage when closed: cargo door, open: crew door with docked ladder: cargo door with docked loading platform: cargo slots inside and locks into place the same way it sits on the loader, neat: the minifigs, sorry this one is a bit blurry: and that concludes this week's "show and tell". dr. s.

1 sweet plane looks much better than in the catalogs *sweet*

1 thanks dr.s for this great review, this is your what, second one? anyway, this aint half bad, i actually kind of like the bigger planes despite the annoying big pieces, and this one looks to be the best yet. batbrick away! >:-)

1 i do admit the amount of cargo is rediculously small, but it still looks good. say, how much can the plane hold? thanks for the review! *sweet*

0 lt. veers, on feb 4 2008, 11:42 pm, said: i do admit the amount of cargo is rediculously small, but it still looks good. say, how much can the plane hold? thanks for the review! *sweet* that's all the space you get. now, it might be possible to rip out that rear bulkhead at the back of the wing and fill the middle area with tiles so cargo pallets could slide up the fuselage. but that would definitely prevent the undercarriage folding internally if that's what you wanted to do as well. dr. s.

-1 i loved the pics in the catalogues but was a bit disappointed by the build and end result. my own thoughts: cons: - as noted, the cargo space is really small considering the size of the plane, although i can see this is restricted due to playability - without the barrier in the middle, the cargo would slide all over the place while the plane was being swooshed - the cargo 'lift' (i'm not sure how else to describe it) is very weak and snaps off, although it is a clever design i think it's badly implemented - there is nothing to hold the cargo pallet to the cargo lift truck so it tends to slide off all over the place as soon as the truck moves - colour issues - i had at least 3 shades of green with the larger plane pieces and noticeable variances even with identical cargo hatch pieces. at least one of them also came quite scratched, which was a little disappointing - at $79.95 aud it's $10 more than the passenger plane was with less pieces and figs, and no printed pieces whatsoever! more $ for less, methinks. pros: - lots of nice cargo crate pieces and even the stickers for these are pretty good. - landing gear piece adjusts very well to height differentials so the plane doesn't lose its gear as often as the earlier passenger planes - the hinging mechanism works very well to open the cargo holds - opens very smoothly and is not noticeable - i'd definitely like to see more of this technique - the little vehicles work well chained together and are all good small designs overall: - i really like the large planes since 06 but i don't think they've still quite hit the nail on the head. whereas the earlier planes were a little flimsy, this one is sturdier but has its own issues. the look of the cargo plane is nice, and the new landing piece and cargo hatch pieces are really great, but some design weaknesses and colour issues detract from the overall product. it's a shame as with a bit of tweaking this could have been a must-have set.

1 wow, that's a great review of a great set dr s! *y* as you yourself have already noted, this has the potential to be a fantastic military moc! with a bit of modification you can get the engines to be rounder, or perhaps do away with them completely and replace them with jet engines. *sweet* though i can't think of a system to retract the undercarriage at the top of my head it seems like there's indeeed more than enough potential to do so. it reminds me rather of an ilyushin il-76, one of my favourite cargo planes. :'-)

-1 thanks for the review that seems to be a nice set but as far i'm concerned, i don't think it's worth eur 49.99. there aren't so many parts though those new curved slope will add some more building possibilities. *y* what lacks : - a 2 x 4 cut out in the lower part of the nose to retract the landing gear. - a 4 x 6 cut out in the lower part of the tail to allow passagers to get off through the back like in a dc-10 - some real plates and tiles instead of these crappy wings. this part is the useless one that tlc ever produced *n*

0 nice review, dr. s! i have been thinking long and hard about the scale of the planes in my town. i would like to keep my passenger planes in their classic 4-wide fuselage style, but i really don't mind the new plane hull pieces if they are used as an enormous transport plane like the ilyushin-76. unfortunately i can't afford this lovely new green one at the moment (which would be perfect to go with my green army) as i took too much of a hit buying the new 2008 star wars sets! but i have modified my white one to take huge cargo loads, in fact my apc is designed specifically to fit inside. unfortunately i'm a bit busy to take pics at the moment, but hope to put some up soon.

1 dr. s: i was not planning on buying this set after my disappointment with the other large airplane, but after looking at this image review, i just might buy. the green color is really the aspect that makes this airplane stand out. i think it looks great! thanks for the review.

0 if i do end up geting this set it will be for my slowly growing army. btw nice review *y*

0 at my local wal*mart there was most of the 2008 sets including the indiana jones ones :'-) i picked up this one and the motorcycle chase! name: 7621 lost tomb price: $20.00 parts: 277 figs: 3 *box art first off we have the great indiana jones box art!! i must say the designers did an excellent job on it! i love the little temple design with skulls! as well as including indy in the right hand corner. the back of the box is just as cool showing all the neat play features of the set as well as an advertisement for the indiana jones game *figs first off we have our hero, indian............. what the hell? why is there a freaking cw anakin head on indy!! there was a production slip up as instead of indy's head i get anakin's! :-| |-/ i open the box up and there staring me in the face is his ugly face!! tlc is defiantly doing to here a gnarly complaint from me!! >:-( ok now here we have the " real" indy fig that is supposed to come with the set :-d i just noticed that his fedora hat goes down in the back! bonus picture time, here is a jacketless indy with his sleeve torn off, like he looks in the temple of doom *sweet* the next figure up is our lovely marion *wub* *wub* *wub* plus her head is reversible with a scared face x-d love the new hairpiece in black!! finally we have our undead skellie with second style head and poseable arms *the well of souls the set itself is a nice model and playset! the anubis statues are very cool and i love all the hieroglyphs on the walls 8-? here is the sw link with artoo and 3p0 x-d the ark in its resting place the ark removed, its very cool indeed, but tlc should have made the whole thing in chrome gold |-/ not metallic gold with brown and yellow!! the closeup of the anubis statue, yes the eye is a sticker but at leasts a gold color! *playability first off you can pull the pin on the anubis statues which send them falling and taking out the walls. behind the wall a skellie swings out! there is a lever in the back of the model where you push down and the snakes shower down upon the figs hehe with the snakes all around, marion is both modeling with the new carrot torch and fending off viscous cobras :-d in the meantime indy uses his whip to scale the wall and avoid all the snakes which he is afriad of. in the meantime leaving marion behind to fight them off. :-p the whip is bendable but it will always snap back into a coil, its some type of bendy hard plastic *scoring figs- 9/10 model- 8/10 playability- 8.5/10 overall satisfaction- 4/10 (would be 9/10 if it wasn't for the stupid anakin head error!) in the end this is a charming set and could easily fit in with the adventurers! it has the cool anubis statues as well as the ark. plus indy, marion and a skellie, great selection of figs but sallah would have been better since he actually removes the ark with indy however i am still wondering the point of the anubis statues, this set does seem pretty silly :-p p

1 thank you for this review! it is a brilliant set! i am definitely getting this set once indy is released in new zealand hurry up tlc! >:-( ps:could i have pic of what indy looks like with an old classic whip?

-1 wow what a screw up from lego! that one is even more out there than the extra obi wan in the rc. x-d

1 nice review, all the important stuff is there. weird cock-up by tlc to put an ani face on indy... i didn't encounter any mistakes in my four indy sets. great selfmade temple of doom indy fig, piranha! so uhm... has anyone found out yet what the extra hieroglyphic stickers are for?

0 wow i can't believe other people have had this same head error mistake! x-o i thought it was one of those extreme cases of production slip up! the good thing is i will get a replacement indy head, and get to keep that anakin head!! i forgot to mention that my set was also missing 1 black ear piece for the anubis statues there also are extra stickers for my set, i can't figure out what they are for though? hehe, i too like my tod indy fig 8-| :-d p

1 i got mine today! x-d i too got an anakin clone wars head, although i'm not really complaining since i already have an indy head from the motorcycle chase set. it is really odd that they would pack in such a different looking head though. also, for those that think the head has no use, try placing it under one of the braided new brown dwarf beards. it looks pretty nice, i think! *y* on the set, it's wonderful! the hieroglyphic stickers are wonderful, marion (especially her head and hair) is wonderful, and the anubis statues are nice too. there's also lots of nice tan parts, such as 20 round 2x2s, and 8 1x8 bricks. all in all, it's a great set for the price, and i can't wait to get race for the stolen treasure and temple escape now! *sweet*

1 dammit indy, you weren't supposed to open the ark!!! i really like this set, i only brought it for marion but its a nice set and fun to build.

1 welcome to: my sigfig sgt. joey sh. will lead trough this review of the new city 7743 police surveilance truck. first of all the box: front back the minifigs: 3 police officers and a bad guy now the vehicles: the cute little atv *wub* the main part of the set: the surveilance truck a shot of the interior the trailer back of the trailer the truck back side the little building: front the interior and last but not least: spare parts and not needed stickers that?s it! hope to see you again at the next episode of sgt. joey?s reviews.

0 great review stealth hunter, a bit blurry in places but overall nice shots of the truck. it is much, much better than i expected, but i still won't get it, i have no need for more police. thanks for the great review! batbrick away! >:-)

0 thanks for the review, that truck is actually better than i first thought! i am still tossing up getting it, as i am getting the police station, and where would it park?! :-p i quite like the little building though, but still... i am so confused *wacko*

0 i like the new station but the truck is a good question. i still like the classic 1994 one and the 1980's can that was one of the first units i got

0 it looks to me that the little building is supposed to be like some sort of customs checkpoint between one nation and another or like a toll facility on a highway. i like the little checkpoint but i think that should be part of a separate set and 7743 just having the police mobile command center truck.

1 hello and welcome to another, oh wait, first batbrick and iamded review! today us two sworn enemies will be reviewing the creator cargo chopper, here is the front of the box: and while pushing iamded to his doom, here is the back: haha! ouch! oh dear...here are the parts anyway... here is the instruction of the first model, the cargo chopper. i love creator sets for the different models, they always excite me. just ignore me finishing off my nemesis in the background. something very interesting that i liked in the instructions was this step where you must add those three 2x2 yellow rounded pieces under the chopper. this is for support while you build, which is handy, and later you take it off: and even later use it as the cargo. i found that to be rather innovative and clever, as well as - hey! what are you hitting me for? both instruction booklets have the same back: now heres the chopper itself. i love the design of it, it isn't quite minifig scale but its great all the same. this is my first non-xpod or house creator set, and it sure is fun. here me and iamded go for a dizzy ride. i love the nose of the copter, and the landing gear is fantastic. a shot from the other side. oh dear, it seems we've been a bit sick from that ride, and were vomiting transgreen 1x1s. the cargo itself is nicely made, though i forgot to put on two tiles here :-$ . it fits in real well with the chopper to, and the line is great for giving iamded the wedgie he deserves: this is my first power function set, so i was pretty excited. the motor is intergrated really well into this set, and is activated by pushing that little 3x2 plate with the 1x1 slopes on it forward, until it hits the motor button, that orange knob. another point of interest is the use of bley barrels on each side. i like this as i don't have those pieces in that colour. a shot of the motor. its really simple, all you do is pull the hook out to any length that allows, then press the orange button and it will wind it back up. this makes the chopper pull the cargo up into its bay, and iamded pull me here reluctantly to a whacking: a top view, is that my head? a view of the chopper without the cargo in it. i love the lowered cockpit: the leftover pieces from building: (note: iamded's head does not count as set piece) and a final shot of the set with me and iamded. oh, it appear we're dead, oh dear... hope you enjoyed this review, soon i will post the two alternate models. i loved this chopper, its great to play with and has nice construction. it also has some handy pieces too. the motor function sounds like a gimmick but is well intergrated into this model. well worth the price, so far this is another win for creator i say! so far i recommend this model, but later we'll see if the alt models are up to scratch. also, since this is my first review, comments and criticism welcome on everything. batbrick away! >:-) edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 06:37 pm. indexed

1 great review, batbrick! iamded got what he deserved. x-d

1 thank you very much for a fine review, batbrick. *y* what the.... i never realized these cool grey barrels till now.... that?s pretty interesting. :-) the whole chopper looks very good, with a well fitting power function. it?s for sure a rewardable work to change that baby into a real mf version with accessible cockpit. :'-)

1 i am definitely getting this set. thanks for the nice review!

-1 i wish i could just get those grey barrels alone, the rest of the set doesnt really intreigue me much :-$ thanks for the review.

1 thanks everyone, heres part 2: the second instruction booklet includes instructions for both alternate models, which is good, i hate having too many manuals: here she is, the plane: its very nice and well proportioned, but where did iamded get that laser? overview, the landing gear is very sturdy and nice, and the wings are surprisingly good: top view, iamded's head fell into the propellers, i was trying to save him, honest! a view of how the motor on this one works, by pushing the orange button you can make the prop spin. it is well integrated like the chopper, though the prop only spins for about 2 1/2 seconds. still, its a nice feature: the tail is also well made, simple, but lovable. oh, and check out that tank! the prop spinning, agh! is that my hand? final view, there seems to be some sort of explosion here 8-| well i think i got iamded more than me atleast. the second model is also great, though not as good as the chopper. the lack of space to fit something into the cockpit brings it down a bit, but it is a very nice model overall. i recommend it, though unlike the chopper it will be hard to mod into minifig scale. so far so good with 4995, here are the leftover pieces from the model: enjoy! batbrick away! >:-)

1 haha your review are so funny and so lego cool

1 lt. veers, on feb 11 2008, 11:55 am, said: great review, batbrick! iamded got what he deserved. x-d x-o :'-( :-p great review, batbrick! this looks like a wonderful set, i love that plane! it doesn't bother me that it's not mini-fig scale, as it looks more for display imo. *wub* looking forward to seeing the final model! *y* ~peace

1 i really like this set... even though i was hoping for a mini-motor! :-d chock full of great parts too. thanks for the review. *sweet*

1 thanks guys, heres the final part: the instructions for the boat begin on page 46: the overall set, its actually much nicer than i thought it would be, the pictures on the box make it look ugly. top view, tommy guns do not actually come with set ;-) side view, the designers have done an excellent job with the hull, considering the lack of many slopes pieces. you can see it is pretty much minifig scale too: here you can see that by pushing in the red technic axle, the "anchor" on the front will be hauled back into the boat: back view, these outboard motors are pretty cool, though i wish they could go own into the water more: overall, though the weakest model, its still a lot of fun, and has a clever way around the lack of a shapely hull. i was impressed with it after the building it, it even has two rounded snotty bottom pieces on the nose of the boat to give the impression it is speeding through the water with the front lifting up. lots of leftover pieces for this one: the pieces: sorry about the poor photograph there, it was getting late :-$ overall the cargo chopper is another great set in the fantastic creator line. loads of fun, great play, and some clever designs, it challenges you to make your own things, and even includes some nifty pieces (bley barrels! *wub* ) i won't give it a rating, but i'll just say i certainly recommend it to fans of the theme and lego fans in general. now, finally, iamded and i teamup in the face of a larger foe. get that lord of pies! batbrick away! >:-)

1 howdy how , my batman fellows! today i was in a toy mart - and i was looking for a sw set - but all were that expensive! then i saw this batman set ! for -> 13 ? yea ! 13 euros! :-p i had to pick it up! as i came home i started building! figs: i really like them both cause they are new to me ! the green dude x-d looks cool! batman is also very cool! building it : first there was this speeder boat from this green dude :-p , it looks really cool and these shark eyes ( or what are that) look also really nice! then there came batmans speeder boat - its a nice little ship! then the boat : its really cool the simple makes it that good ! at the end i got that : ranking : figs 10/10 parts : 8 /10 playablity :8/10 price 10/10 -> 13 euros there .. thats a good price! overall ranking of aayla : i think i got batman feever - am guessing wich set i pick up at next .. any ideas wich is good - or wich you can say me .. was good is good?! batman collection deffinitly on!!! aayla

1 congrats to that nice review.... i like the batcave set, you should also been able to find it at discount....

1 thank you for your wonderful review! ) i was done very well.... ) i suggest that you will find "two-face's escape" set a very interesting one to build.... it also provides great playability and is not very expensive for what you will get. ) good day to you. )

1 it is a tie between two face's escape and the batcave... but i would go with the cave... over 1000 pieces, nifty submarine, penguins, alfred, mr freeze, and and and.... it is wonderful...! especially for 38?!! :-) ol' style batman on! (yep, this is a lil' rant on 2008 batman.. :-p )

1 6258 smuggler's shanty overview smuggler's shanty was released in 1992, it consisted of 69 pieces, 3 minifigs (two pirates, one imperial) and it cost $9.25 (usd). the set itself is a small but rather sturdy den for the pirates! review: the minifigs consist of two pirates and one imperial. the minifigs are not all that rare, which is disappointing, i would of liked a rarer fig! but still it is a good cheap source of pirate and imperial figures. here is an overall shot of the set, which includes the three figs, the shanty which is made using palm leaves pieces, and a nice grey shark nibbling at the soldier's oar. a close up of the soldier rowing hard in his boat. i would have preferred to have a normal soldier with shako hat, as i have more officers than normal soldiers now!: and a close up snap of the main structure. note the wine glass, which was a nice touch! funnily enough, only 4 pieces of treasure were included in this set, compared to the usual 8 gold coins in other sets. a view from the back, which also gives a good view of the pieces used to construct the shanty mainly simple black 1 by 1 bricks: the shanty looks good from most angles but their are a few where the roof construction looks rather odd, but that is just a minor nitpick! yet another view from the front,, this time at a slightly different angle. the yellow base plate looks rather nice too, i prefer it over the tan pieces we trend to get nowadays: "attack!!" the stupid drunk pirate in the background does not even notice! overall i think this is a rather good set, despite some shortcomings, such as the lack of treasure and odd roof from some angles. the shark, imperial soldier and useful parts make up for it, and of course the price is cheap on most auction sites, i got mine for a mere ?5 ($10), with the cheapest price on bricklink being $8. rate the set then leave your comments, thoughts and opinions!!!

0 first i'll comment on the review and at a later date i'll comment on the set. you've done a top job lord of pies *y* you've captured the set from a variety of angles and posed the mini-figures interestingly.

1 simonwillems, on feb 19 2008, 07:47 pm, said: nice poll as well, but you made sure nobody can give this set a 1 which is very nice (but probably a little mistake :-d ). i gave it the top-rating. *y* so i have, oops! i never was very good at maths. :-p

1 wow. i remember this set from when i was a kid. i got it for my birthday and opened the package first. sadly, i had to go to school so i had to leave it at home and not build it or play with it until i got home. needless to say that was one of the longest days of school ever. good review, great set.

1 i bought one of these new from bricklink a few months ago as part of my pirate splurge i went on. i really enjoyed this set because of the amount of figs in such a small set, though pirates were always pretty good about their fig count. also the neat little hut is nicely done for its purpose. great review, btw!

1 a very nice review of a pretty and neat little set, thanks lord of pies, guess its a 3 for me, with strong tendencies to 4....

0 woow :d this was my first lego set ever!

1 this set shows the awesomeness of classic pirate sets. i really have to get me some more! xd great review on a great set!

0 a nice review and a nice little set for anyone's pirate collection. a 5/5 for the review.

0 i'd give the set a 3 1/2 out of 5. it needed 1 more imperial to get a 4. a bigger basplate would have been nice as it appears to hard to fit all the minifigs on the island. thanks for this great review

0 laurinator- i don't mind an occassional old review coming back to life for discussion, but it seems you've replied to many old reviews that have been stagnant for years. please try to refrain from "bumping" a lot of old topics as it pushes down new content that should really be the focus of discussion now.

0 well since this topic has resurfaced, i would add my 2 cents about my appreciation of this set. it was the first and (unfortunately) the largest pirate set i owned as a kid, but i played the wazoo out of it. some of the minifigs have lost almost all their face printing after so many play sessions! theres just something about the hut that appealed to me more than the cheesy skull-face islands we keep getting.probably that it wa kind of neutral, good for my pirates, settlers or islanders. though the palm leaves were rather fragile and used to break off the studded parts. it would be nice to get more of these "beach village army builder" sets. edited by ardelon, 21 september 2014 - 03:40 pm.

1 hi guys. i picked these up the other day, but it's taken me this long to get round to posting the reviews. so, here we go: tub comparison with a minfig (thanks brainbox): the lighting changes a bit throughout the photographs, as it was going dark outside, so i only really had my desk light, and i kept getting in the way. 4837 mini trains now the box i really like. it's no different to those of last year's sets, but the colour here is simply fantastic, and really seems appropriate for the theme. so this is what you get inside. all the pieces are still inside the bag, the optical illusion was accidental :-d . no pieces of particular outstanding interest, but the dark green cheese slopes are rather nice. look out for those later. 1 2 3 this is the main model, and uses all the pieces in the set (bar these two, which according to the inventory are spares, but as with all my other creator sets, i'm cheating and leaving them in). this is far and away the best model of the three, and evokes the iconic version of a steam train. the green looks superb, but i'm not sure whether that's due to the model itself or the actual colour. moving on, we get to the second model: 1 leftovers (yes, i admit, i was using a piece of paper) this isn't actually a bad model. i don't think it's quite as nice as the previous one, but it's not bad. it's different from the first model as well, which is good. too muich of the same can be a bad thing. finally, we come to the third model: leftovers now... i'll be honest. i don't really know what this is. it's not that good a model compared to the other two. that's all i can say, really. and of course, all the pieces fit into the tub. overall: i have to say, i do like this set, despite the weak third model. the strength of the primary and secondary models make up for any weaknesses in the third, and i can imagine the pieces being fully usuable in building other trains. while the basic idea of these tubs isn't quite as good as the x-pods with regards portability and general 'niceness' they aren't bad. and for a fairly cheap price (?3-4) as well. 4838 mini vehicles this is one of those set boxes that you see because of the ridiculously loud colours. sound marketing scheme if you ask me. i've managed it again. there are pieces outside the bag. or are there? now these i like *y* . 1 2 (i don't know what the clip is for, there isn't one on the other side) 3 4 5 this is the main model of the set, and again all the pieces are used bar these three, the spares. it's quite a nice model, although the car's a bit odd. still, i like the ramps, and the colour scheme reminds me just a little of g1 ultra magnus. hmm, i think that boom arm could do with refixing... 1 2 leftovers this is actually quite nice as well. it's that classic breakdown truck, and the boom arm itself is quite nice, with quite a bit of movement. another solid model. 1 leftovers i'm surprised by the amount of detail here actually. not only have tlc included a spare wheel at the back, but also what looks like a trailer hitch, which all adds to the 'realism.' another nice model to round out a nice set. and in the tub. overall: i'm not sure which of the two i like better. when i bought them, and on the way home, i much preferred the train set. but after building this set, i'm not sure. this is another good set from the year when tlc seems to be giving us so many. there are some good pieces in here too, and while there's nothing unique, they're still good. so, thanks for reading, hope it helped someone, and if there are any requests, i'll see what i can do. that's requests for pics, not songs ;-) . edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 06:56 pm. indexed

1 tks for that nice review, brainbox! i recieved the construction diggers set like this last year. gee what a nice parts pack. i like that orange lidded set, the truck. so nice. i won't get it though.

0 why not? they are all very nice (i have all six of them), especially the helicopter, my least anticipated, but one of the most detailed!! thanks for the review brainbox!!

0 thanks for the review brainbox. *sweet* these look really nifty* i might pick up a couple of these as for the parts, i'm sure they could come in handy for something. and so cheap as well. i still miss x-pods though. :'-( *do the kids still say nifty these days? *wacko*

1 thanks for these great reviews brainbox, i never expected you to do a review for some reason. i love these mini sets, the train in particular is great. i won't get any though, those indy sets are coming in fast and i'm gonna need all the money i can muster. still they are nifty little sets. batbrick away! >:-)

1 brainbox, on feb 20 2008, 02:55 pm, said: you're welcome guys. :-d sorry, that just made me laugh. i did some research and re-read tyour review. i will pick this up this weekend. quote yeah, so do i. they really were a neat idea. i had all the x-pods. they were awesome. i haven' collected all of these though.

1 so here it is finally, my first ever review of a lego set..oh wait, it's actually 2 sets. so i don't really know how to do it right, but i'll try the best. (sorry if some pictures are a litte bit dark, but i'm not really into photography and i got bad light here) let's start with the dwarf's mine defender: theme: castle 2008 set name: dwarf's mine defender number: 7040 pieces: 86 price: ?9,99 (eur) first, as always, the box: the back, a few instructions on how the defender works, for those how don't know ;-) : and the instructions: we continue with the minifigs, sorry i forgot to make a closeup of the dwarf: and finally the mine defender itself, i personally think it isn't as bad as maybe some people think. the chain for the catapult is great i think: i kinda love those controls, the mechanism with the rubbe rband actually works pretty well, but only on a not-glossy underground. that's pretty much all of it, it's small but i like it a lot. so let's go on to the tower raid now, which would be my absolute favorite of those new sets. -------------------------------------- theme: castle 2008 set name: tower raid number: 7037 pieces: 364 price: ?29,99 (eur) again, first the box & instructions: we got 2 sets of instructios here, one for the tower and one for the siege tower: the minifigs, we got one archer and one soldier here, both with the torsos of the 2007 sets: now thw orc side, starting with the great leader, with the new armor and the golden helmet (i love those pieces!): closeup of the armor & helmet: then we got another orc-knight: and the prisoner, with handcuffs! the crownie tower looks great overall, though there is something i don't really like about it, but later on that. now the back, and that is what really bothers me, there areno walls on the first floor except the one with the wall-piece and the door, and theprison also is open at the back. the orc easily could jump out there: not sure what these are all about, they really don't add much to the set: enough rant now, let's go on with a pretty sweet detail, the golden crystal on the little table: the wall piece on the first floor you can ram in: and finally the very best thing of this set, the amazing orc siege tower! from the front: the great working ram, you can pull it back very far and it got pretty much power: here we got another sweet detail, the siege "platform" that moves out by pulling a cord in the back of the tower: finally a picture of a bit siege action: if you ram in the lower wallpiece, the brown shelfs of the prison-floor collapse and the prisoned orc is finally free! summary: likes: as i mentioned before, i really think that's the best ever produced siege tower, it's got so mich details and works extremely well, also the overall look of it is magnificant. the destroy-mechanism of the tower is pretty cool too, the brown door is a fine detail too. nothing much to say about the mine defender, i like this little set, and there's nothing really to bother about it. dislikes: the back of the tower. that's really the only thing that's a bit bad imo, they could have put there 2 more walls on the first floor and something to lock the prison easily. final thought: the tower raid for me personally is the best of the 2008 sets so far, it's got great playability and looks simply good. my opinion: buy it!

1 great review, pictures and all! thanks for showing all the mechanisms of the tower, i didn't notice them from either the pics we had or the instructions--it didn't hit me that when you knock down the wall the second floor breaks. that is a genius idea. this looks like a superb set, unfortunately my priority right now is the troll warship. still, if that really is u.s. $80, i might skip it and go for this instead, which is only $20 us. one note, though. i think there might not be a back cage on the second floor of the tower so that the mechanism can work. did you try to see if the second floor ground still falls if you add it a fourth cage wall? also, you could just pretend that the tower is built against a mountainside. it would fit perfectly and add more defense to the knights. great review! :-) vk

0 thanks for these fantastic review. it's the first time i take a good look at these sets. there is a good chance i'll buy the dwarf's mine defender, especially for that price.

1 thank you for these fine reviews, metalandi. *y* there?re really some nice playable features in the tower raid set, and all these great orc torsos, just sweet! and it even looks like that black orc-armor?s a new piece, lovely.... :'-)

1 cheers for the reviews. they're both nice sets, and i think i just may have to buy both. or maybe i'll get two of the dwarf set? the figs in each are really cool as well. the dwarf, well, they're just cool anyway, but the troll with the golden helmet and armour, that's just *wub*

1 thanks for the double review, i like the dwarf catapult but the real deal is the tower raid set. i love that siege tower and love that new armour, can't wait to get it. thanks for the review! batbrick away! >:-)

1 the tower raid has the best price per piece ratio in the whole 2008 line. thanks for the review ^_^

1 thanks metalandi! these are 2 great sets, i'm definately looking forward to seeing these in new zealand stores! the collapsing floor/prisoner freeing mechanism on the tower is wonderful, a great touch. some slight modifications, like, some walls, will make this perfect. and the dwarf's mine defender is a sweet little set, with some neat minifigs. thanks for the reviews! *y* ~peace

1 thanks for the review, i personally think the siege tower is probably the best one which lego has ever produced.

1 well, i don't think orcs are that sturdy, seeing that they'd have to jump from the second level of the tower, i don't see survival as his chief objective! :-p awesome review! i'm loving these sets more and more! the tower raid is definitely the best and the cheapest set there! >:-) oh, and pirhana, it's not really a 'king', it's more like an officer. remember, the wizard rules these goblins! edited by trooperdavinfelth, 22 february 2008 - 02:49 pm.

1 thanks for the great review. *y* the siege tower does look great. i'll have to look out for these sets. edited by zouave, 14 march 2008 - 07:24 pm.

1 hello eurobricks! my first post yesterday i will buy this two sets! i'm waiting for the packs! sorry but my english isn't good

0 well you didn't say anything wrong yet undead army officer i perfer using the batle wheel to knock down the tower's walls, not the seige tower

1 the rancor, on apr 22 2008, 05:54 am, said: i perfer using the batle wheel to knock down the tower's walls, not the seige tower i love all the siege machines the orcs have, they are certainly a much bigger threat than the skellies. batbrick away!

1 green grocer reviewed by dunamis set 10185 2,352 pieces $149.95 from the lego store (glendale, ca) build time 6.5 hours holy guacamole! almost exactly one year after caf? corner was released we get the third installment in the increasingly popular lego exclusive town series. combined with the famous 10182 caf? corner and its trusty companion 10190 market street this trio makes the foundation for an amazing city block of lego goodness. for those new to this series of sets, check out my reviews of the two previous sets in this line: cafe corner market street i would not necessarily recommend reading too many of my reviews in one setting as you might experience loss of brain cells and/or drowsiness. you have been warned. so, how does green grocer stack up to the two previous sets you ask? well, follow along kind reader and i shall attempt to unravel this question. the box: the gigantic box is pretty standard and looks amazingly similar to the caf? corner box. the back of the box shows some of the features of the green grocer as well as a lot of the cool interior that was absent from the previous sets. in addition, we are shown an image of the three sets together and a small insert image showing how they connect together (as if we could not master that difficult maneuver?) opening the box is a matter of breaking two seals. as it seems to be the norm now, we have the reusable cereal box type tab system that we saw so often in 2007 sets. however, upon opening the tabs we are pleasantly surprised to find a cardboard tray! have not seen one of those in a while. as you can see in the photo, we have two 32x16 green base plates, three instruction manuals and a bunch of bags that are broken into four groups: group 1 has 12 bags and goes with the first manual and builds the first floor. group 2 has 9 bags and goes with the second manual to build the second floor. group 3 has 14 bags and goes with the third manual for the top floor and roof. and one bag that is not numbered and hence you can open it whenever you feel like it. there are no stickers ? yay! moving right along, we get to the three instruction manuals. the manuals: the three manuals are 55, 47 and 47 pages in length. they are laid out well and are pretty standard with all the usual trimmings: - piece call outs for each step - parts inventory at the end of the second manual - page numbers color separation in these manuals was fine for me except dark bley and black. we get a nice photo of all three sets together: plus, we get a nice tip showing how to split up the bags and what goes where. those additional pieces you see in the photo just below the numbered bags are the pieces that come from the single un-numbered bag (along with the base plates). parts list random manual shot the pieces: upon opening the first set of bags, one thing is clear; there are a ton of little tiny pieces! the minifigs are included in this first section as well. interesting to note that there are a handful of printed pieces and as i mentioned previously, no stickers. we also get a host of new and exciting pieces to add to our collection. keep in mind my scope of lego sets is generally centered around star wars, technic, creator and the occasional racer set so what is new to me might have been around 15 years. at any rate, here are some of the more interesting pieces: again, note the printed tiles. this time around, lego has decided to include 33% more minifigs than the caf? corner and market street sets. yes, we get four minifigs instead of three! here are the cast of characters: pictured (left to right) is sir top hat, miss jenny blue overalls, patti o? furniture and little timmy cub scout. i?ll leave it up to the minifig aficionados to decipher which torsos are new and to tell us all about the hairpieces. i can say with reasonable certainty that the four yellow smiley heads are not new (somebody check that?) don?t forget the lovable little cat named ?tom?. he is the arch-rival of the mouse ?jerry? that lives downstairs: overall, there are a lot of pieces, large variety and wide range of colors. the build: if you have either of the two previous sets, you will feel right at home here. just like in the previous builds, it seems like the first ten build steps are consumed with laying a bunch of 1x1, 1x2 and 2x2 tiles everywhere. almost feels like 30% of the pieces are used up right away (see below). there are several sections where you build various parts of the interior. take a look at the cash register/counter below: and the beverage cooler: and the produce stand and everything that goes in it: looks like someone has mail: looks like someone just had a baby: this set is incredibly well done and gives inspiration to go back and add similar items to caf? corner and market street. as before, the average builder is introduced to some new building techniques like using the hinge plates to make the angles on the front of the building as shown below: also the top of the roof shows some interesting ideas: overall, it is a really fun build that kept me entertained the whole way. the design: this is a great set with lots of little details. i especially like the little mouse hole in the wall leading to the jerry the mouse?s area. they even included a little slice of cheese! it seems the designers can?t get away from the ?usual? staircase which i always feel is way too big. maybe future designs can incorporate a spiral staircase to save room for other things in the model. one welcome addition is the fire escape as seen below: i?m going to show a bunch of examples of various items in the set so you can get the feel of the amazing detail in this design. take a look at the lamps (torches?) just outside the door: and the streetlight with fire hydrant: brickwork and archway: awning: here is the back side of the building. note the trashcans and yard tools: here is a close-up of the railings on the second story balcony and the second photo is the finished product with curtains in the window. nice use of cups to make the banister on the second floor: here is the fireplace on the second floor: second floor staircase with tom?s hiding spot: check out the radiator on the third floor: more third floor: nice grandfather clock and rug (third floor) check out the deck that is up on the roof. complete with two chairs, table, umbrella, flower pots and grill: interesting use of minifig hammers on the roof: finally, here is what is left over when we?re done: a couple of shots of the front: a shot of the back: and here are all three together: overall thoughts: this is an incredible set and the best of the three in my opinion. it is hard to top caf? corner but i believe green grocer just did. i absolutely love all the details and building techniques that went into making this set. there is a ton of different parts and wide color selection. as usual, we get a bunch of tiles and small plates, but that goes with the series. also, we get four minifigs and lots of minifig accessories. i?m giving this set a score of 100%! i thought about it and i really don?t know how they could have made it any better. in short, run don?t walk to go pick this set up! final rating: 100% build 10/10 (excellent - lots of nice interiors, details and accessories to build.) functionality 10/10 (outstanding. raises the bar with interior and detail. think caf? corner on steroids.) design 10/10 (excellent ? can?t say enough good things about it.) parts 10/10 (great selection and diverse colors. great minifigs.) price 10/10 (price ratio is excellent but lots and lots of little parts. well worth the price.) as alway, feel free to comment, complain and question what you see here. i'd like to hear your feedback on this amazing set.

1 wow! that's a great review i'm glad you took so many pictures, this set is far better than i ever expected it to be, the detail inside is great. is it the first set you'e given 100% to?

1 a great reveiw dunamis *y* . you have only backed up what i thought when the pictures first appeared, if you are a lego fan there is no excuse not to buy this set. it is a must have! i love the mouse hole and the mouse and his cheese *wub* .

1 damn you to hell dunamis >:-( now tks to you i really want the 3 sets put together x-d wow that is what i call a sweet review 8-? tks for taking the time to make once again such a fantastic one ;-) the overall look of the building is brilliant and i love the nice additions they did: the cheese and mouse (jerry :-d ) is hilarious !! i didn't know green grocer had a rodent infestation !! and the use of the new built furniture and detils like the radiator is freaking awsome !! also that set has a definite plus for me: its the back details !! i love the stairs, the deck with table !! wowx that is what i call sweet backdoor details !! now its clear that i will need to buy the 3 sets asap !! tks once again dunamis ;-) *yoda*

1 very nice. very nice, indeed. lots of lovely, little details, even at the back. this review hasn't changed my opinion one bit, i'm still looking forward to when i can finally pick up mine at the post office. i'm crossing my fingers that there will be more buildings following after this one. i'm guessing that lego's just testing the waters to see how far afol's are willing to go regarding price vs. details. green grocer is still epic, though.

1 what a beautiful set, tlc give the designer a pay rise immedietly. i was lucky to order one of these while they were on sale to us aussies ;-) but dont worry lego the $100 you saved me will be spent on more sets like this. carn't wait to watch my kids rescue residents in distress from those upper level windows with the fire fighters.

1 man, these sets are so awesome. incredible work done by the designers there, must have took a long time to get all this ogether. if they weren't too expensive i would go and buy them all 3 right away *wub*

1 like the set, this review also deserves a 10/10. i've ordered this set yesterday on s@h. seeing and reading this review, i'm convinced it will be worth the money. so, bonaparte is finally entering the city theme !!!

1 this is a nice review, thanks for all the great pictures!

1 truly an awesome review. thanks dunamis. i ordered my two copies (one to build, one to store in the "vault") last week. can't wait to get this one! the attention to detail here is what makes the set great. there's nothing to criticize about this set. it's really the closest thing to perfection that i have seen from tlc. the difference between this set and cc is the interior detail, and because of that, gg now become (in my opinion) the best set ever released by tlc. do the cc/gg/ms sets fit well with the 50th anniv. town plan? my impression is that out of the box, at least, they don't. which is too bad. however, i don't think it would be hard to mod the town plan so it looks like it belongs in the same town as cc/gg/ms. these sets, to me, are what i have always wanted from tlc as an adult. i hope they keep up the line, and add more elements to this excellent lineup.

1 wow,, thanks for the nice review! i have the other 2 sets and waiting for this to come to our shores. stupendous design and details! i really like the "hammer-rails" on the roof. cant wait!!! *wub*

1 thanks for all the feedback. as you can tell, i really enjoyed building it. cardinal brick, on mar 8 2008, 09:26 am, said: is it the first set you'e given 100% to? yes, it is. i gave cafe corner a 96% and i felt this was a better set and improved on the things that i dinged cafe corner on (lack of minifigs was one thing.) that's why i enjoy reading the comments so i can see if my ratings are in line with what everyone else thinks and to see if i missed anything. i can't wait for some of you to build it and share your thoughts as well.

1 a very fine review with great and informative pictures, thanks dunamis! *y* and what a wonderful set, a masterpiece and far beyond everything i would?ve expected just one year ago.... the amount of details is exceptional, from the different railings to the mousehole and the radiator.... sheer brilliant. :'-) and two female mfs (or hippies, you never know....) and a child.... only one adult male character who nearly looks like.... well, anyways. it?s simply a milestone, and a very creative and inspiring beauty. *wub* easter parade on! and, sweet gg.... will you marry me? :-$

1 o. m. g. i must have that set!! :'-) *y* *wub* i remember you telling me that you were going to do a review of this set, and i was so anxious! i love these reviews! thanks so much! great pictures. *wub* *y* *y* this will dent my wallet. 8-| i am so envious!

1 a very informative review, indeed. thank you so much for doing so. now i know that the price is worth every penny leaving my pocket. ;-) what do you guys think is tlc putting up as the next modular set? is it asking too much of tlc to produce 1 modular set each quarter (4 times a year)?

1 a million thanks for this review. this is greater than i thought. i especially like that clock. i'm going to get this set as soon as possible.

1 :-) amazing!!! great review!!! :-d u have totalyl convinced me to get this set! its so wonderful, filled with great details. what a waste, i can't order it in s@h because i am from singapore :'-( i hope it will come to my country, so i am able to buy it!!! :-)

1 thank you for the amazing review dunamis! this set looks amazing *wub* i won't be able to afford it though :'-( congrats! this is on the frontpage *y* *sweet*

1 great review. thanks for taking the time to do this. this has been a great line. at the risk of abandoning my castle/adventurer loyalties. i've got to say this is rapidly becoming my favorite line and this set looks to be the best of the lot. while it still hurts to shell out $150, i think i'll still be happy to do so. steve

1 i?ve got something, i want to share with you. a beautiful dream came true: #1: the box: top: back: the alternate model is also very well done. the pneumatics dump the bucket and open the flap (?). open: you can see a diagram how the pneumatics work. just a happy kid playing. the plastic inlays (?): all: #2: the parts: as you can see, 8854 offers a very large variety of different parts. loads of technic bricks, gears and even plates. also note the threaded axle 10, 5 large pulleys, a big turntable and the 1x20 rack. #3: building: the mechanism for the outriggers and the rotation of the turntable: the turntable: the pneumatics are finished: the mechanism for the telescope: the finished model: #4 random shots: you can see how the turntable will be rotated. thanks for reading- erm? viewing the pictures! please comment if you want to!

1 really cool set! this has convinced me that i really want it!

1 wow, another old technic set review by you. nice set, and thanks for that review.

0 looks like you have the original 1989 version with the yellow top cylinders. :-) i got one too several years ago, although i probably paid too much for it. :-p on a side note, if that pneumatic tubing feels harder and stiffer than the modern type, i highly recommend that you don't use it and buy some of the newer stuff off bricklink instead. tlc originally used a different material for the tubes and this stuff degrades the nozzles (on pistons, switches and so on) over time. the old tubes also grip the nozzles much more firmly and if you aren't careful when removing them, it's actually possible to rip off the nozzles completely. x-o i had this happen a few years ago, although tlc replaced my broken pistons for free. i got rid of that stuff for good after that, although the pistons on my power crane still have slightly discolored nozzles. edited by cp5670, 10 march 2008 - 04:57 am.

0 this was my first pneumatic set

1 this was my first technic set, aged 7! still a great one in terms of function density, and a great b-model. in the uk i'm certain it was called the "salvage hoist".

0 hi! this is my third (old-school) technic set review! i don?t want to talk much, please enjoy just the pictures! #1 the parts: #2 building: the two axles, you can see in the middle, are not connected and don?t belong to each other. the axle on the left side is for the steering, on the right side for the engine. the dark-gray ?technic gear 16 tooth with clutch? allows the connection from the differential gear to the engine, trough the axle for the steering. the v6-engine: the winch: that?s a part you don?t see everyday: a 1x2 rack. it only reappears in 2 sets from 2001 and 2004. (the rebel wrecker has been released in 1994.) the ?front double wishbone with anti-sway bar?-suspension (yeah, i got it from technopedia! x-d ) the finished model: #3 random shots: i really like this picture! authoritative, isn?t it? 8-? :-d thanks for viewing the pictures! please comment if you want to!

1 thanks for reviewing all these old sets! will you be doing any more?

1 this set is really cool. i might actually get it!

1 nice pictures. i also sort out the pieces the same way if i'm rebuilding a model. *y* this set packs a lot of functionality into a fairly small size, but was rather expensive for its size ($70) when it was still available, compared to other sets of that time. you can also rig up the technic flag sticker that it comes with to the main model. i've done that on mine. you may want to reinforce it with tape if you're going to leave the model on display though, as it will break up over time due to uv exposure like many stickers do. i had to do that with mine after it started to crack, although it still looks pretty good.

-1 the only original stickers are the front headlight-patterns on the 2 red 1x2 bricks. the others have been destroyed - must have been the bad decaying sticker quality that breaks when you'll remove it - so i printed them. i didn't print the flag for only the alternate model needs it, although it's a neat idea...! and lordgalewind: clickey! i keep that in mind. one of my 8880 is already dusty enough!

1 thanks for reviewing this classic set. i got it when it first came out and still love it: the suspension, steering and robust look of the model haven't been done that well ever since. this set puzzled me though, back in the days. the rear suspending part containing the differential and some gears was shown different on the box from the instructions. in the instructions it showed that the (grey part of the suspension) in the back had to be made using a 1x2 smooth tile and 4 cornerplates (2x2) in grey. the box however showed a much sturdier solution using a 1x8 tile and a 1x8 plate. it is also visible on the cover of the instructions. the pieces i mean are in this picture: bernddasbrot, on mar 9 2008, 07:05 pm, said: otherwise, great set!

1 natelite, on mar 10 2008, 05:57 pm, said: hmm, seems like the wheels are recycled into the harley truck in the 2008 batman set! nope. the harley-truck-wheels are thinner and somewhat more modern. i do believe they're the same like in 8274. aaaaaaaand: for a long time in my life these wheels have been the best and coolest looking i've ever had! so where's your deference? :-d recycled... |-/ x-d

1 bernddasbrot, on mar 10 2008, 05:56 pm, said: you've just motivated me to go on a "senseless-preliminary-design-errors-hunt"...! man..., this set is a disaster what were they thinking! :-d :-p i just remembered one other fun aspect of this set: the crane hook can be attached to the underside of the rear bumper, to hold it in position while driving along, but when things are like this and you try and wind up the cable the winch is strong enough to break the (original provided lego) rope.... it 'worked' with my copy. :-d so this set is capable of demolishing itself.... but still, one of the best technicsets i have, with all stickers intact. i'm not so sure about that flag though, must check on that.

1 wow, that first picture is great! you must have a very wide angle lens with the capability to focus very close (macro). the perspective makes the model look huge. nice work. i think the suspension on this set is my favorite of all technic. it has such large travel and is so.... what word should i use..... "bouncy". hey, why do you only review sets which are red? :-d eric

0 blakbird, on mar 10 2008, 09:35 pm, said: hey, why do you only review sets which are red? :-d i exactly thought that today as i made the pics for my signature...! x-d at my school leaving examination i made a model in blender3d and explained to the board of examiners how to build a car and how to animate it. it needed a color, so i took red "because all beautiful and fast cars are red..." my physics teacher contradicted. :-)

1 a neat review of a cool set with very informative pictures, thanks bernddasbrot! *y*

0 bernddasbrot, on mar 10 2008, 01:41 pm, said: at my school leaving examination i made a model in blender3d and explained to the board of examiners how to build a car and how to animate it. it needed a color, so i took red "because all beautiful and fast cars are red..." my physics teacher contradicted. :-) did you use ferrari to prove your point? any physics teacher would have to admit that a really fast car, approaching the speed of light, will always look red as it drives away due to red shift!! x-d on the other hand, 8880 looks pretty fast and it is black, although i have seen pictures of one that someone built in red. yellow might be good too. some cars even look fast in green. eric

1 i can remember that i've seen a few color variations on brickshelf and on ebay (they sold well). it's new and familiar at the same time. that makes it more interesting!

1 i also happened to receive this set this weekend, virtually misb (the seals on the side of the box were loose, however everything inside was untouched). this little beast a joy to build and even more so to play with! as indicated by eric on the technicopedia page, it's crammed with functions for a medium-sized set. i think i love it even more than my son does

1 i read blackbirds technopedia page on this truck the other week, went onto ebay and picked up a misb copy for 25 gbp bargin, great to get old sets unopened, peeling the plastic off of the specialist parts was always cool! love the front suspension

0 that price is exceptional. it's less than what i paid for mine 9 years ago, and is even less than the original price of the set. note that the stickers in this set are the bad variety that will crack and peel over time. if you want to preserve them (the technic flag in particular), you will need to tape over it.

1 somehow i also managed to get this set in very good condition (including box, instructions and all stickers) for a mere 22 a few months ago. this is indeed a very special set, and was a pleasure to build. the only flaw i noticed was weak support of the rear drivetrain, which was easily corrected with a few extra plates.

0 junkstylegio, on mar 23 2010, 11:17 pm, said: huh? like where? don't have that much problems with that rear train. (at least if i you don't trow the model down the stairs or something like that...) maybe it's unusual, but this section of the drive train didn't hold that well on my model: this is how it looks now: the parts made redundant were left in the built model, that's why there's that useless 8-tooth gear there :p

1 thanks for the great review vbbn! *y* i already own 2 of these x-d on your camera there should be a little flower sign, switch to that to go to micro mode ;-) it's a really good first review *y* *sweet*

-1 a nice review, well done! *y* the set itself doesn?t look quite interesting to me, compared with some of the newer ones like 7647 or 7648.... the way the driver fits into the cockpit looks not very clever and pretty uncomfortable as well.... x-d

-1 my friend has this set and the alien ship's wings are wobbly and overall :-x he may have built it wrong, i'm not sure, i didn't see the build. anyways, nice review! *y*

1 sweet first pic review! *y* i got this set for a birthday present last year, and it is pretty fun overall. the alien ship in this set is actually one of my favorites. it just looks cool, and the way you can fold it out is really clever. the only negative for me is the cockpit of the mining unit. not really because it isn't detailed, but because mine is top heavy, and keeps falling forward. it's kinda funny if you think about him driving along and then falling forward...but not funny at all when you're playing. |-/

1 cool review. makes me want to get the set. *y*

0 thank you for your nice review, vbbn! *y* but it only confirms: this theme is not my cup of tea. weird aliens, strange colors, parts stuck together with no idea. :-| i always hated this big wheels - it?s even worse in orange. :-x saving money for different sets on! (and that doesn?t mean it was a bad review ;-) )

1 ~vbbn~, on mar 12 2008, 11:37 pm, said: those new alien commanders for summer look promising though. i've not heard of these. can you direct me to some pictures? steve

1 holodoc: i agree with you. and the buety of being a custom parts maker is that i can recolor these... :-) *y* athos: sure, buddy. they have moving arms, legs, (a real mf!) the arms and legs are the same just flipped. :-) edited by ~vbbn~, 14 march 2008 - 01:12 am.

1 well, as bad a concept aliensvshumans is for a theme... i really do like this set. the human rover has nice parts for reuse, especially those oldschool space wheels. and despite those wobbly wings, i really like the alien ship. goes from a flying saucer-ish shape to a spread winged almost raven shape, very ominous and cool looking. now that 'alien commander' is terrible... if i don't buy bionicle minifigs already, why would i be interested in that thing? kinda wish they'd take the drones from the retiring exoforce theme and do them in green, they'd make nice alien robot things...

0 anytime, ~vbbn~!!! *sweet*

1 hi! this is my forth (old-school) technic set review! since blakbird pointed out that all my technic reviews are red, i chose a yellow dune blaster for today! just kidding. this set is red as it should be! (don't worry my next reviews will be yellow and black... uhhh forshadowing... ;-) ) i will start with some facts! 277 elements and released in 1994 that's enough. #1: the box: #2: the parts: #3: building instructions and catalogues: wow! no folds, no wear marks - simply: *wub* "was lesen coole kids?" - "klick! das super magazin fuer coole kids!" (how obvious...) #4: building: no differential. i really love the way the 1x8 technic bricks on the sides will be positioned later. fun fact: the engine contains no 2l-technic axle. ...and finished. a real quick build. #5: spare parts: ...for the alternate model. the yellow technic handle should be from 8412. maybe a bonus feature from the seller! #6: random shots: #7: final thoughts: this is my second 8829 and i also noticed that the engine turns very hard. the alternate model is really (sorry to all those of you who like it) crappy. i mean- a nice idea, but not with this wheels! :-| anyway: a really beautiful technic-set! *reminiscing* (this word exists, does it?) thanks for viewing the pictures, i hope you enjoyed it! please comment if you want to! edited by bernddasbrot, 21 march 2008 - 02:09 pm.

1 that looks like a very nice set! :-) in your opinion, how does it compare to the current dune buggy? -toa of justice

0 i don't own the 8296, but what i can see from the pictures, i would say that 8296 is very similar to 8829. the only things that are different ist that 8296 is studless and features a steering wheel for the seat. but 8829 has got bigger wheels... >:-) it also would have been nice, if the wheels from 8296 could have the same tread.

1 great set, great review, although the set looks better in yellow. :-d

1 hello all apologize for digging out a such old post. recently i got a bag of lego technic parts where there have been mixed three sets: 8858, 8829 and 8235 the resurrection of 8858 has been described by me in a separate post. going back to the dune buggy  when i saw it for the first time back in 1994 i did not like it, as i was always big fan of 8840 (which i consider to the day the best looking buggy) and set 8829 looked to me ugly. so there were those all parts in the bag then i though why not build it ? and i started to do it. when i finished i was very surprised how the final look of this set is! really taking my words back. unfortunately in the bag there were missing some parts and i could not rebuild the back spoiler. so i made some changes to it and make it from spare parts that i have and it came out acceptable. i also added some additional parts such as fake steering wheel, rally logo, antennas. i have also reverse mounting of the rear tires  why lego did them like that i never know  as i think they look better this way. set: well the review has been already made by owner of this post so i will only add few things into it. engine  v2 (aired cooled?) is driven by 4 gears -> from the single wheel (no differential as in 8840) using two old school z14 tooth bevel , then by z24 tooth crown and z8 tooth type 1. actually the (as in most old sets) the pistons are moving very fast (not as in current sets) and smooths  i needed to extra clean all engine parts as there was a lot friction. suspension  set has engine bay working using two old gray shock absorbers 6,5l  the movement is not big but works very nice, better then in 8840 in my opinion. steering  this is a bit odd as there is no direct connection to hog as in most old sets, but first the gear rack is moved by z8 then two z14 tooth where reverse movement is taking place. later connection of two old school z14 tooth bevel goes to hog details  this is the most that i like in this set, specially how the use of axle pin connector perpendicular and 1x10 bricks with 3x3 cut corners and plate 1x5 toothed ends 2 studs with center axle hole are making the body shape  is just wonder. tires  the balloon rear are pretty nice the front is a new version of those that were in 8840. what i do not like: 1. missing of technic figure (8840 had it.) 2. no steering wheel in the original set 3. no differential  but having in mind that lego has introduce 24-12 teeth would be difficult to build the transmission in such small space where the engine is. i will shortly upload new pictures and post them here later on . over all  i think it is worth buying it as it is very payable ! actually very payable and runs smoothly , the steering, suspension  perfect thank you and regards

1 wow! this buggy was my very first lego set. i like this review - it remembered my childhood. i also liked its body with those 8 studs long bricks on sides. i can also remember trying to build engine in such way that it works smooth without success. anyway i think its "studless version" - set 8048 is much better.

1 finally, after a very frustrating incident with the internet explorer 7's 'back' button, i present to you my very first review. this is a review of set 8158 speed racer vs snake oiler, it's also the first review of a speed racer set on eurobricks. also you should know that i didn't put the stickers on as they can be quite valuable later on down the road, so i'm sorry for the lack of stickers. :-$ so without further ado i present to you my first review. he he, that rhymes. :-d edit: i just finished resizing the pics and uploading them to brickshelf after having a heated argument about when my bedtime is with my mother. so, i will be doing a complete redo of the picture portion of my review of set 8158. i'm going to work on that as soon as i finish typing this message... edit 2: review fully redone now, *sighs*, that took forever. edit 3: almost forgot to put in a new link to its brickshelf folder. this is v.2 of my review of set 8158, enjoy... theme: speed racer set:8158 speed racer vs snake oiler price: $19.99us pieces: 242 minifigs: 2 first off pics of the box, instructions, dss, minifigs, and new parts: there are so many stickers they had to number them! x-o so's sunglasses are chrome gold. 8-? close-up of the hemets. new parts include, first system lego hubcap, new more curvy fenders, curved windshield, and a s-shaped connector piece. now onto the build, first speed racer's mach 5: back part of the car. the cockpit of the car. they connect with the new s-shaped piece. front part of the car. front and cockpit also connected using the new s-shaped piece. side view of the car, so far. underside of the car, so far. adding more detail. ground level front view of the car. side view with added detail. underside with newly added axles. demonstrating how the new hubcaps are put on. now on to building snake oilers orange-ilicious racer: back part of the car. the cockpit of the car. they are connected using the s-shaped piece. front part of the car with seemingly random color choices. *wacko* the front and cockpit are also connected using the new s-shaped piece. adding orange-irific fenders. side view of the car so far. adding more detail. smoothing things over. ground level view with lime green "eyes" and white "fangs". side view with more detail. rearword view of the car with newly added cuve-acious windshield. no hubcaps!?! :-| now onto finished views of both cars, first the mach 5: side view with sweet hubcaps. up close and personal with the mach 5. a rearend shot. "i got hubcaps, i got hubcaps!", speed racer. now so's snake racer, yes thats what i'm calling it. :-p :-d beautiful! blurry, :-$ rearend pic. "watchout it bites!", snake oiler he's ready to take on sr, hubcaps or no hubcaps! >:-) racin'! now for some comparison shots: hope you all like v.2 better then v.1, i know i liked it better. x-d seriously though i even learned a thing or two doin' this last version. ;-) now it's time for my summary: overall a very well designed and executed set. it's only downfalls are that there are way too many stickers, 32 to be exact, :-| and there are no cool contraptions on the cars to take out the other racer. a great buy for $19.99, i reccomend this set to everybody because of the reasons i staed above and because even i, who is not a big fan of speed racer, x-o was drawn to this spectacular little set. price: 10/10 pieces: 8/10 too many stickers. minifigs: 9/10 needed some accessories. playability: 8/10 needs some cool contraptions on the cars to take out the other racer. overall: 35/40 general tarful edited by imperialshadows, 01 june 2008 - 12:07 pm.

1 thanks for the review, i think i'll certainly get these sets. they look very nice and have nice minfigs (i love racing, as long as minifigs could sit in them). the fact that there are so much stickers make me think this is an model building theme, like when you build plastic cars (with all those tiny pieces and a load of stickers). but that 's'-shaped thingy does already exist, doesn't it? edited by matn, 23 march 2008 - 11:40 am.

1 sinner, on mar 23 2008, 11:55 am, said: yes, i have a few of them. great pieces too! i don't think i've seen them in a set for years though. it's good to see them back. but... 32 stickers? that's more than any of the first wave of ef ever had! still, the set itself is very nice, with some nifty new pieces, and the minifigs are pretty cool too. i may not be familiar with speed racer, but i still may get this. i'll go and see the film as well, to fill in the background (of the set).

1 i definately prefer 8159, in terms of minifigs, and useful parts colors to me :-$ but the cars are all the same basic design. thanks for the review. and i actually love the stickers. this means i won't have to rub off all the print, and if wanted, i can use stickers elsewhere :-$

1 as i said elsewhere i couldn't see this reviewed anywhere so here you are! to start with, a couple of box shots: the contents and the parts laid out: the instructions: this is what was left over from the build: and here's the kit complete. build time, about ten seconds if you pick your nose whilst you are doing it. :-d i love the little robot, it reminds me of that weird machine in the first wallace and gromit adventure, in fact, give it some skis and you are away. oh, and it has a metal detector thingy which i might have to borrow for a future episode of grunts (i'm not sure if i have any already...who knows...) cost - 2.49. value for money? erm, no, knock a quid off and i'd say yes. dr. s.

1 nice review the set doesnt seem as good as the crystal hawk and there colouring mistake with gun is just well bad and not the kind of thing i expect tlc to do something that stupid edited by pencoin, 03 june 2008 - 04:51 pm.

-1 i don't even see why you reviewed this set... it didn't tell us anything that isn't perceivable from the box, being so simple. though i do appreciate the effort.

1 big or small we all love our legos, and for that i thank you for the review. i would have had liked to see your opinions though, about the price, the playability, or anything else you'd care to share about it and perhaps how it fits with your collection. i've always been hesitant about getting this set because to me i feel like i have it all already, but i'm missing that dog, radar gun and, 50 mph sign :-/

1 a very neat and useful little set, thank you for the nice review. *sweet*

1 ah, what a very fine classic set.... and all these lovely technic beams with studs! *wub* thank you very much for that excellent review, bernd, and you did a fantastic job with all these great pictures! :'-) *y*

1 another nice review. the slow shutter speed pictures are great. i think that was the only set with 8 distinct functions for a very long time and was only displaced by the 8455 backhoe in that respect. the turntable on the back doesn't turn very well though, as the weight is all distributed on one side. the screw axle prevents it from popping off but there is still a lot of friction in it. i don't have mine built anymore but it might be worth trying to put a weight brick or something on it. quote do you have 8455 as well? i'd love to see how they compare side by side... it looks bigger than 8455 but i don't own any of the big old chuncky tires so i find it so hard to tell. yeah, it's quite a bit bigger. when everything is fully extended, it becomes something like 26" long. although the 8455 actually has more/better functionality. edited by cp5670, 24 march 2008 - 08:15 am.

1 bernddasbrot, on mar 23 2008, 02:32 pm, said: hi! this is my forth pre-old-school review. as promised: a yellow-set ! my 8862 arrived today, survived the washing machine coaster and actually was real fun to build! the finished boom / jib / scoop thing (=bjst) :-| x-d thanks for viewing the pictures, i hope you enjoyed it! another great review and a wonderful set of pictures. i like your nomenclature for the bjst. acronyms always sound nicely scientific; much better than "digger". no one would know you made it up until they found out what it means. i also really like what i will call your "kinetic photos". they convey a sense of motion and show the range of the mechanism without the big file sizes of animations. how long of a shutter speed did you use? the secret to not getting too much friction in the turntable is using extra nuts and jamming them together. you don't want to actually clamp the nuts tight across the turntable. you want to jam two nuts tightly together at each end which prevents them from unwinding, but still leave a little free play (gap). this way it will hold the assembly together but not prevent it from moving. mine moves quite easily. this same concept is used on the pen plotter or 8094. "slewed"? i think that's a word. how about "slewn" or "slain" or "slewifacated"? i think "rotated" is best. *sweet* eric

1 by the way, don't forget to build the alternate model of 8862. it is a combine (farm equipment) which is just as good as 8274. i liked it so much that i bought two copies of this set so i could display both. my favorite alternate model (not counting universal sets) is the 8480 submarine. maybe it is time for a white set review? *skull* white is pretty rare. for your blue set, i recommend you review 8462. there are only a couple of green sets, and 8479 is the best. and then of course, 8458 is silver!! i think we all know what the best black set is. and according to your photography, you have lots of them! but don't forget 8868. eric

0 bernddasbrot, on mar 24 2008, 05:39 pm, said: could you explain your thoughts please? you know: my english skills ;-) i was thinking you could somehow attach a 16-tooth dark gray gear (the one that spins freely around axles) to the nut, which would make the axle move in and out when the gear turned and convert the gear's rotary motion to linear motion in a fairly compact package. although there are other ways of doing the same thing that don't use such rare parts, and the 2008 technic sets will come with pre-built linear actuators anyway.

0 blakbird, on mar 25 2008, 06:42 pm, said: wow, that's a long exposure. i would think you would get way too much light and overexpose the image. the aperture must have been tiny. for the aperture i don't know what i've used, but my room was already very darkend as i tool the photos. it was actually serendipity. ;-) blakbird said: cool. i am also planning to write about the combine on technicopedia. i will but i'll need some time. i really shoud do a few things for university (that's also the reason why i succeded in so many other things... :-| ) blakbird said: you don't own 8480? that is unacceptable. it is imperative that you put a mortgage on your house immediately to get it! not again!!! *sing* (just kidding. my parents will. x-d ) blakbird said: while the assembly you have drawn would work as a linear actuator, i would not recommend it. the torsional stiffness and strength of an axle are proportional to the polar moment of inertia, a section property. most of the stiffness comes from the outside of the cross shaped axle. but in the threaded axle, you lose all the stiffness of the outer area because it is not continuous. this means you only get stiffness and strength from the small core. i think the threaded axle would bend and break very easily if subjected to much torque. the toothed 10l axle doesn't look very robust, you're right. on brickshelf i once saw another version using a worm gear and a halfbush being moved along another axle. edited by bernddasbrot, 28 march 2008 - 05:12 pm.

0 i'm very sorry for that doublepost... i made a picture for you, sinner, but forgot to upload it: your dad, patrick parrot, driving a giant backhoe. sadly his second job as photojournalist and the fact that bianca lamb was strolling by, distracted him. as a consequence he spoiled the whole construction site bringing death and doom with a technic backhoe to fabuland. and a little walrus baby. *y* :-p

1 thanks for another classic review! man, i wish i had this set. the shovels should have been black though.

0 @ black shovel: i just tried a black shovel but i can't / don't want to determine which looks better. front, on mar 30 2008, 11:40 pm, said: a great review. i only have new sets, so looking at old ones like this is great. i would suggest multiple pictures

1 some time ago i sort of complained about the fact that there was not much technic represented in the eurobricks community (this was the topic, if someone is interested). i am glad to see someone took that complaint serious and started reviewing technic sets on large scale to show us how fascinating the theme really is! this review is once again an excellent one, i really enjoyed reading it. i must buy this set sometime soon because i always liked the three-way pneumatic system it came with and the overall look of the machine. for many years it seemed out of reach, much to expensive and hard to come by as a kid. now as an adult there are many ways to acquire this wonderful set. keep on reviewing! *y*

1 this is a review of speed racer set 8159 raxer x vs taejo. this is my second review and the first review of this paticular set and the only one on eurobricks... at the moment x-d so without further ado i present to you my review... (i like that saying so much i decided to use it again in this review, it's originally from my review of 8158, which can be seen here.) note: sorry that this review got delayed, but there was a hostile takeover of the computer, x-o don't worry everythings fine now. x-d set: 8159 racer x vs taejo theme: speed racer price: $19.99us pieces: 237 minifigs: 2 note 2: i did not take photos of just the new pieces this time because they're the same "new" pieces as in 8158, just in diff. colors. if you want to see a picture of them click here. first off pictures of the box, instructions, dss, and minifigs: not quite as many stickers as set 8158, but there still are quite a few. can you guess which ones which? :-d yes, taejo's hair really is red and black, for racer x's head tlg just reused the baddie's head from 7620. |-/ now onto the build: first racer x's x racer :-d (thats not it's official name.. i think.) :-$ back end of the car. the cockpit, and yeah there are no seats for racer x's hiny, just a flat 2x2 dark bley plate. the cockpit and rearend of the car connect using an s-shaped connector piece. the front part of the car. the fornt and the cockpit are also connected using an s-shaped connector piece. adding some details including yellow fenders. the underside of the car, so far. adding some more detail. newly added motor vents and smooth details. adding a front bumper, amongst other things. side view of the car, so far. "no backseat driving, wait a minute, there's no backseat!" the underside with newly added axles. demonstrating how hubcap piece is put on the car. now onto taejo's grr (glorious red racer) :-p front part of the car. cockpit, regular seats... check. cocpit and rearend of the car connected using s-shaped connector piece. adding some detail. the front part of the car. front and cockpit connected also using the s-shaped connector piece. adding some fenders to the car. underside of the car, so far. adding some smooth details. taejos is the only car with an actual hood. side view of the car, so far. underside of the car with axels. now some finished shots of both cars: first racer x's fine black and yellow racer reminds me of an older ferrari from this angle. up close and personal. i'm guessing the 3 holes are exhaust outlets. racer x rollin'. now it's time for taejo's red racer "i could've sworn i ordered some hubcaps!" -guess who... taejo racer x admiring taejo's fine red automobile. up close with 'big red'. rearend shot of the car. "i challenge you racer x!" -taejo racer x bein' a complete badass and smokin' taejo. >:-) now for some comparison shots: (the silver pocket knife is just to hold up taejo's car.) now a shot of the extra pieces: now if you combine 8158 with 8159, you get this: "go, go, go!" now it's time for the summary: this set is an excellent buy at $20 dollars, it's well designed and has lot's of details, it also has very unique minifigs. (which are always good in a set.) it's only downfalls are the lack of acessories for the minifigs and that there are no cool contraptions on the cars, and by "cool" i mean lethal to the other racer(s). now to the scoring of the set: price:10/10 pieces: 8/10 too many stickers for such a small set. minifigs: 10/10 unique and creative. playability: 9/10 would have been perfect except for the lack of acessories and cool contraptions on the cars. (but both are easily modified/fixed hence the nine.) overall: 37/40 a great set! bonus: try and count how many times my silver pocket knife appears and win... the knowledge of knowing how many times the silver pocket knife appears. :-p :-d this concludes the review, more pictures of either set 8158 or 8159 or both available through request, via pm-ing me. ;-) see ya' next time folks... of course i don't mean that literally x-d ... general tarful edited by imperialshadows, 01 june 2008 - 12:05 pm.

1 nice! it is probably the only speed racers set i will buy - and i will buy multiples! those cars look awesome.

0 thanks for the review. and for giving me directions :-p i think the design of these two cars looks to be better than in the other set. the drivers are positioned lower compared to the windscreen and the design of the front on th red car is really nice. i'm missing details of motors and cars this big could use a working steering mechanism.

0 thanks for the review, mate. i may get this as well, so i can get racer x. axctually, i see what tlc's done here, splitting up the two more well-known characters, speed and racer x, so you have to get both sets. matn, on mar 25 2008, 08:09 am, said: lego should have used this for their helmets, you can put a (protecting)glasses(don't know the name) in front of it: visor? i'd have to agree with you with regards the helmet. i would've preferred this, especially for speed. interestingly, my pocket knife is the same as that one. i didn't count its appearances though.

1 speaking of pocket knives, i just got speed racer and snake oiler at k-mart and might mod the helmet so it actually looks like the cartoon. the problem is - i don't want to shell out two bucks for a clear visor! >:-( by the way, i know trans-clear visors are non-production, but where did they come from? a pick-a-brick? if so, what store? well at least if i do go through getting the elusive clear visor, it's not as bad as the insane $25+ red vader helmet! this set is great. i would have gotten this along with the one i purchased, but i didn't have enough dough with me to get both.

1 crap, now i want these sets!! great review!

1 as promised, and with only a single day of delay is my review of the 2008 set: 4994 creator fierce creatures. this small set is the same size and price range as last year's 4939 cool cars reviewed by prateek and dillthepill. the box general info you get 193 pieces (vs 206 for cool cars) which is quite a lot, but most of them are small. there are a lot of hinges and some good slopes and wings. the building instructions contains three models, but no further ideas for inspiration. primary model: spider the first model is a big spider which shares some similarities to the secondary model of 4895 power in the design. the legs each have 3 joints, where the ones in the middle have "stud joints" to be moved sideways while the rest use hinges for all joints. there are 8 of them and it does get a little tedious with all the repetitive building in this relatively small model. i like the design of the face with a lot of eyes and a big and ugly mouth, but the real gem is the x-pattern on the opisthosoma made using double/inverted slopes. it is poseable and i think it looks more "fierce" when inverted. secondary model: snake the face of the snake is nicely detailed with a splitting tongue and a mouth than can move a little. there is a problem with the construction. it uses stacked hinges for some of the joints, which are hard to pull apart without stressing the pieces. tertiary model: fly i'm not completely sure what this insect is. i will say it's a fly, although the tail and head are too pointy. this is a neat little thing. conclusion primary model: 8 it is a good design, but lacks some sturdiness in the legs. they fall off a little too easily. secondary models: 6 they are pretty good when you look at the bricks that are available, but they don't wow you in any way and they suffer from the same issues as the primary model regarding sturdiness. alternate models: 3 it is hard to come up with alternate models with so many small pieces and plates that are only 1 stud wide. the colors might make you want to build a spyrius space ship. playability: 8 the models have many movable joints and you can put quite a scare into your minifigs when their town gets attacked by these creatures... unless some en forces are there to protect them. price: 6 creator sets are known for their great price to bricks ratio, but this set doesn't quite measure up to sets like cool cars. pieces: 7 the pieces aren't great by themselves, but who doesn't need a fist full of hinges, slopes and basic plates in standard colors? i don't think this is a must-have set like the big rig was last year. the pieces are great and it has a nice primary model, but the set lacks a bit when it comes to the usual strong creator qualities like alternate models and price.

1 thanks for this review, it's a nice set with some cool pieces and nice techniques, i like the way the roof pieces are used to make the spiders back, for instance lasse d, on mar 26 2008, 09:48 pm, said: alternate models: 3 it is hard to come up with alternate models with so many small pieces and plates that are only 1 stud wide. the colors might make you want to build a spyrius space ship. ouch! that's not a good thing, let's refrain from that.... ;-)

1 a fine review of a fine set, thanks lasse d! *y*

1 thank you for your detailed review, lasse d! *y* the only problem about this set is, that most of the people here will regard this as a pure parts pack. x-d oooh - i just found out about the red "teeth" - cool. i want that! *wub*

1 thank you for review very good army builder i see

1 excellent review! *y* getting a better chance to look at this set actually makes me interested in it. i was in my dark ages throughout the islander days, though i have built up a small force of them (10?) from ebay buys, but no actual sets. if this is really as reasonable as you say there, i may just have to pick one up soon. oddly, i do own the baseplates to this set, having also picked them up in a lot on ebay, so i might be able to recreate it manually, but i think i'd rather pick one up whole. it looks like a great mix of parts and makes a decent looking display piece. thanks again for the fine review! *y*

1 a mighty fine review you've created slyowl! *y* after some sleep i shall immerse myself more fully within it.

1 nice review ( although i'm pretty sure eldorado fortress has 8 minifigs, making this set no 4 in the minifig count.) i gave it a 5. the number of islanders and vegetation pieces comes in very handy for land based scenarios. i've got 3 copies of this set, 1 of them costing me less than 2euro's from an ebay auction in scotland. along with forbidden island it's easily one of the most common and affordable pirate sets to be found on he second hand market.

1 a great and informative review with very fine pictures, thanks slyowl! *sweet* a wonderful set this is indeed, full of nice details and pretty playable, and a cool subtheme that offers a lot of fantasy and charming characters in a marvelous layout. i really love that little boat with the outrigger, and the neat buildings and sweet landscaping works together very well. tlc got sued for using some names of native sounding origin? now that sounds really strange to me.... such namesre widely spread within novels, movies and such stuff, i didnt know that theres some kind of copyright on them.... 8-|

1 good review, mr. slyowl! and good pics too! i know it probably deserves better but i only give him a 3. i'll be surely the only saying that i don't like this set but i remember i had it for christmas when i was a child and it disappointed me very much because i expected it much larger after seeing it in the lego catalogs. well it's just a little trauma i had :-p lol anyway i must admit it's an interesant set, specially because of the large number of mini-figures and accesories it brings with and the two little "ships" edited by bluebard, 31 march 2008 - 01:13 am.

1 it's a great set and one i have yet to add to my collection despite my large number of islander extras. enchanted island, aside from having so alluring a name was good value for money in that you only needed this one set and you had a good representation of the islanders both in the size of the set and the number of minifigs. the flipping rope bridge and the river give it a great rainforest retreat sort of feeling and one is inclined to think of this set as more inland than directly coastal for me. whilst the islanders were never seen in the same light or popularity as pirates and imperials they were an obvious and colourful addition that to me added a whole new depth to the pirate system and one was now able to play a 3 or 4 way war adding a greater political element to the sets. enchanted island is probably the 3rd most appealing of the large land bases for me after port royal and eldorado fortress. good review and glad to see the set recognised!

1 wow, that is one great review you made sly! i gave it a four, only thing i don't like is the raised baseplate. it does get you a lot of figs, two ships and some nice assecories, great set!

1 great review! i think this set looks great. i really like the islanders and that statue is really nice. it comes with a lot of nice leaves and i like all of the secret compartments and the like. thanks for the nice review!

1 i was just going into my dark ages when lego began the islander themes, so i've never really cared for them. but this review actually made me want this set real bad. i guess this is what reviews are for then - good job on the review

1 great review! i recently got this set for only 150 sek, around $17, and its really good!

0 hello eldiano. although the review is fine and you have memories related to that set please have in mind that the post you were replying to was in fact some 7 years old. this is what we call "bumping of old topics" and it shouldn't be done. you might want to take a look at our faq: posting tips and etiquette edited by phred, 06 april 2015 - 03:47 am. by phred: read next post please.

1 eldiano, thank you for posting about your desire to have this set. i do own the set, and i do recommend it to others if they somehow find a used one. the bricks are kind of sparse, but the the bricks it does come with are really nice, i love the figs, and the base plates are by far my favorite made by tlg. captain braunsfeld, i suggest that you read through the link that covers topic bumping more clearly. i apologize for the confusion eldiano. i do believe that i have found a way to remove the confusion of posting in old topics soon among the pirate staff and to the other members of eb, please stay tuned. sinner, on 18 july 2010 - 03:16 am, said: 3. lego reviews don't date. thus if you have something relevant to say then feel free to post in a topic, but if it's more than a few months old please make sure it's good.... and if it's been a few years it better be really good! for example, if you liked the review or set and want to say so you probably shouldn't. if you've got an answer to a question (such as "does anyone have pictures of the alternate model?) then by all means post! what you shouldn't do is ask questions to the original poster; he/she may not even visit eb any more.

1 fortunately i got this set on 2000 (not the released version, the original one). and i said "fortunately" because it's a lovely set. how could i rate it, but awesome? a little islander "army", the islander girl, ironhook and that cool boat with two sails, the jail-polynesian statue. i must recognize that i have a thing with the islanders. i know that they are weird, poorly based on the polynesian aborigens, etc. but they are very original, broke with the traditional enemies, and gave to the pirates theme an exotic and wild look.

-1 i realized that building the chess set from the new pirates theme, they are two grey heads that reminded me of the king kahuna throne, which goes to say that i am hoping they bring back new sets, i just wish they were bigger. i would love to build the old ones, but i would side more towards the newer model if they ever released them.

0 here is a preview of my review of speed racer: grand prix race i will try to get a full review up later today pics (when public) sorry about the blur, i am not a great photographer. also if, there are any pictures you would like (that i haven't included), just ask

1 i will most likely get all the speed racer sets as it was one of my favorite movies(the animated one) i just loved the decked up and tricked out cars >:-) great review and red tux = x-d

1 looks like a great ole set to me. the cars seem abit overly slopey to me though, i'll probably pass on this. but as a note, i especially like the black and yellow car's horizontal wheel covering things. nice :-$

1 thank you for the pics *y* i want a trixie impulse set *wub* and otherwise that little boy with his monkey. i like the print on his t shirt.

0 sorry to bump such an old thread, but ive just discovered this set is on sale at amazon.de - for a mere 25 euros. i am tempted. not because i like the set or the models, but because of the parts. as most of you might know, im especially into exo-force. so would you recommend to get this set just for the parts? are they a good choice to combine with ef-sets? would anyone of you be interested in obtaining the fleshie-parts of the minifigs from me, as i totally dont need those?

1 hi! i've promised a lot lately. i'll review 8868, 8880, space police ii, blacktron ii... and i will. it's just the time that is blocking me. and my university. and the fact that i just picked up 8460 in original box for only eur 36,50...! *sweet* the other reviews will follow - please bear with me. and this set review is also a gift to this nice fellow who gave me the title! that's what i'm talking about: #1 useless information with high numbers: this set contains 841 parts and was released in 1995 in the technic / tech build / advanced (sub-) theme. the bricklink price guide displays for used a qty avg price of $125.85 and for new a qty avg price of $212.82. i got it for $56,98. still cant believe it. :'-) this set was rereleased two times (8431 in 2002 and 8438 in 2003). #2 the box: front: back: open: the box is higher than other technic boxes. why? i dont know. 8460 doesnt have any real large parts. whatever. inlay: i wonder why tlg doesnt make inlays anymore theyre noisy and brake easily but are great for (pre-) sorting. #3 building instructions: i will quote myself from the 8862 review: quote wow these instructions are used! i'm not used to this after all this sets with unread instruction booklets... triple-wow! nuff said. this is the first page. (fortunately peeron offers scans!) the last step for the alternate model and a few nice photos showing how the pneumatic pump will be erm- pumped. yeah. random page: i forgot the overall thoughts to the instructions: these are technic instructions as were used to them: part count, easy to understand (okay, the string part at the end was too much for me) and the color distinction is okay too. 100 pages long and if i can trust my eyes the pneumatics page can be fold out. (i dont have this page but i assume it.) #4 the parts: #5 building: an easy and fun build. okay, this could take some time. my longest building review up to date. the front steering: the rear steering. the axle pin between the rear steering is for the axle which rotates the crane. the two worm screws in the front are for the outriggers (theyre not linked. one for each side.) the small wheel in the back is for the rotation. adjusting front and rear steering. outriggers are finished. you can notice a 8 tooth gear that will rotate the technic turntable. a steering wheel has been added. could be the same stickers like the alternate 8880 used to have. the steering can be operated with both actinic lights (?) no. were far from finished. ive got a lot of parts left at this point. wow. a 4x4 corner plate! pneumatics and a winch: if you cant recognize it on the photo: the technic beams are the erm- wrong/other side up. the 1x6 technic beams on the left side are normal. the axle that will extend the crane: 7 gear racks 1x4 the 1x6 technic plate will keep the two pneumatic cylinders straight. *sad* 8-| huh? did you blink? you missed a special part: the whole rotatable thing will be attached to the technic turntable using two long technic pins. the pin on the right side should be in the middle of the three turntable holes. on the right side, its the first hole. asymmetric! why? because well add a cute cab! #6 functionality: you can find the features in comparison to other technic cranes here. technopedia, of course. i made one "sentence" out of it: (please dont find any mistakes.) :-p two axle rack and pinion steering, pneumatic luffing and gear driven telescoping via crank for the boom which can slew 360 on turntable driven via gear, crank driven hoist and gear driven outriggers at four corners which snap over center. #7 random shots: comparison to 8854: uuuh once again a depth of field. i tried to make it look authoritarian like 8858 but i failed. somehow 8460 looks cute. #8 comparison to 8421 mobile crane / crane truck: i feel that a question concerning this will be asked, so i deal with it right now. first of all: i dont own 8421 yet. i know. a technic freak really should own it. anyway: 8421 has more than twice as much parts as 8460, is motorized, features a v6-engine and a very neat mechanism to extend the crane/boom twice using a braided string with end studs. try to find out how! of course 8421 features (far) more than 8460. imho 8421 should have been a copy of 8460, a set so successful that it has been rereleased two times, but the designers overshoot the mark. 8421 is a (breathtaking) monster. compared to it, 8460 looks cute - not pale! #9 final thoughts: i got it on ebay in kind of good condition, for about 50 dollars. i know that it has been worth the money in any point of view. *wub* i didnt use the word old-school for now. ill change that: 8460 belongs to the favored few of old-school technic sets! thanks for reading and viewing the pictures, i hope you enjoyed it! please comment if you want to!

1 somehow i competely missed your review when you first made it, i saw your pics on brickshelf and wondered about the review... you have managed to review my all time favourite technic set! it was the first large technic set i was given by my parents, when it first came out in 1995. i played for hours with this set, making minifig seats in it (it was so huge there was room for four minifigs to sit next to eachother in front....) i made various applications for it, a bungee-jump system with a large rubber band, and lots of containers to be lifted. the first changes i made included the inverting of the wheels and the disabling of one of the flashlight-steering wheels because they obstructed eachother. by the way, the nob for your winch is yellow instead of black (i know this set by heart, so watch out :-p ). i always liked those nobs. i do own the 8421 and i can tell you: this 8460 is much, much stronger, it can carry more weight because the boom is lighter then the 8421: they are powered by the same two pistons... you know when you made it right: when the crane is in upright position, fully extended and you release the brake from the winch. does the hook lower without having to pull it? if it does, you succeeded in constructing the set right. the alternate model was great fun too, the pump is cleverly hidden and the crane folds up great between the cab and the loading platform. you could easily mod it with a pneumatic claw on the crane, a motor to turn it and a compressor. the only flaw was the loading platform which had no floor (only some axles). thanks so much for reviving my memorie concerning this great set! *y*

0 i'm in the same situation as you; i have this set but missed out on the newer 8421. this was a great set for its time but the 8421 definitely looks better to me. i've been trying to find a good deal on it on ebay but it's pretty expensive, considering that it only went out of production last year. quote inlay: i wonder why tlg doesnt make inlays anymore theyre noisy and brake easily but are great for (pre-) sorting. the box designs in general are crappier these days than they used to be 10 years ago. you don't see the old "featured parts" trays anymore and the boxes don't have the different sections either (these also acted as internal supports for larger boxes, so they were less prone to being crushed). the cardboard material is also quite a bit thinner. i think it's a result of tlc's overall cost-cutting moves since then. most people toss the boxes and probably don't care, but i keep all of them. there was actually a time when the boxes used to be even stronger. i have an old 8859 set and the outer box is made of a hard, styrofoam material, although they probably stopped using that for environmental reasons. edited by cp5670, 06 april 2008 - 10:13 pm.

1 a great review, thank you. i do not know these old sets like this one, but it is very cool to see how they were made. i have an un-opened 8421, maybe i should do a small review of that when i get to build it. btw. boxes are expensive, so at a given price point, it's a choise between more bricks or nicer boxes. i have no doubt what most people would chose. front edited by front, 06 april 2008 - 10:21 pm.

1 great review! while i admit i wasn't into technic at the time this came out (i was a mere child, give me a break! :-d), i can see now why it was featured so much. from the booklets to display stands at toy stores and at my local lego center (when it was still around), this thing was everywhere! with your review, i can now truly appreciate all the details of the set. i got to admit, i can see the appeal now! that comparison shot you took is amazing. i love not only just how it included the little details such as the stabilizers, but also looks incredibly fun to play around with. great set and an even greater review!

0 thanks guys! @ sinner: i hope you refered to 8285 so my answer will match: 8285 is interesting: main model: american styled truck, alternate model: european styled truck. i don't think tlg produced many european styled truck. edit: i just found a wonderful moc-alternate on brickshelf: 8436 by industrialdesigner. if i got him right, he designed a few offical technic sets for tlg. @ all: promises, promises, promises... hm. and again it's ebay that's blocking me. i want to foreshadow my next review (although it'll take some time to make it): i know, you know. but please act inconspicuous until you'll can act very astonished...! edited by bernddasbrot, 09 april 2008 - 03:25 pm.

1 actually they are ants. spiders have 8 legs while ants have only 6 like these. the two thing that look like legs in the front are the antennae. back on topic, i think this set looks great and i can't wait until i can get my hands on it and the other new ij sets. edited by erdbeereis1, 15 april 2008 - 09:26 pm.

1 thanks for this review alex54, this looks like a great set. i love the new hair molds and faces, plus al those extra pieces are fantastic! batbrick away!

1 can't wait to get this one (ants!!!) i don't have a tent either, so that'll be a great pickup. i'm surprised, though, that it includes the gold exo-force sword. i didn't expect this to come in any other sets besides the tower. <faramir-<

0 i have no idea why they dont use that female hair piece on trixie in speed racer. it would be perfect! greta review!

1 i'd buy a bunch of these just for the ants to make an ant farm! i also like the bowl cut.

1 thanks for the excellent review alex! this is so far my favorite crystal skull set (released) the cargo plane is however the best i love the small accessories like turkey leg, banana, golden sword and giant ants! mutt's torso is very nice! i love the leather jacket print irina is just a another hottie, but i would like to see her smile oh and another indy...........

1 ok! i think, it''s a no-brainer that this is a must-have for pretty much anyone who likes lego! it's cheap and a great minifigs & parts pack! i'll be getting at least 1 of these! here is what i like about it: 1. great minifigs with nice torsos, sweet faces, and awesome hair! (gotta ask 'em where they get it done! ) 2. golden katana! 3. chicken leg! yum! 4. nice campfire! and this is what i don't like about it: 1. dark bley knife! seriously, they could have at least made it silver like the sword, if not chrome! 2. rehashed tent. 3. spiders with 6 legs!!! i actually don't really care about the tent and the multi-legged creatures. those go straight into the sorting boxes. perhaps i might use the tent someday for a steampunk moc of some kind, or a stop-motion film, or maybe some kind of contest... anyway, what's up with that thing that holds the katana, the sword, and the saber? it's in the airplane set too! is it perhaps one of the treasures of the new movie or is it something indy takes with him everywhere in this film? 44however, nice pics, nice review! thanks, dude! edited by oky wan kenobi, 16 april 2008 - 09:38 am.

1 mhm...i really need this set! there are various things im interested in: the minifigs (hey, i still have no indiana jones figs!), the new hairpieces, a gold katana, a dark bley pirate cutlass (is this the first one?), a dark bley knife (could be useful..), those giant ants, yet another silver broad sword (you never have enough of those).....great parts pack indeed. shakar

1 great review; i will definitely get this, if not only for the hair but the ants, melee weapons, and new faces and torsos!

1 i simply that tent! i guess ill have to buy three of these just to make a proper expedition moc somewhen.... a great little set indeed, with marvelous new mf torsos and that new black feminine hairpieces also great and very useable for creating some characters related to the sixties and seventies. and finally a pan thats not black and a knife in grey. thats very handy indeed, the chrome one always looked a bit too shiny to me.... thanks for that sweet review, alex!

1 thanks for that great review! this is a very interesting set filled with nice parts for customisation. somemore, the price is not that steep. i will need to get ready for the second wave!

1 set ref: 7625 name: river chase number of minifigs: 4 number of pieces: unknown price: 22,90 a general view of the set: weve got an amphibious vehicle, a small boat, an observation post and a dark green croco (so beautiful! ). for the figs, weve got indy of course, marion and two russian soldiers, nothing special here. in the back of the tree, there is a box, to put some things: the amphibious vehicle is very nice! the proportions are really great (not too big, not too small) and there are a lot of details everywhere, like the propeller: a back view: an inside view: the small boat is a dark grey zodiac, but the details are nice too, giving it a retro look, in the same way of all the indy vehicles: the outpost has a net to permit to the bad guys to capture some nice guys and girls but it seems that the girl marion is scared of the nice croco! so indy comes and help her pushing the technic axle with this round inversed tiles, which push out the net and capture the croco. now marion feels happier! and she takes a can of oil and whacks the poor croco, without defences! who has said marion is a nice girl? so, ive bought this set like an add on to my city. in fact, the elements of this set can easily be integrated in a town layout. i plan to use the outpost for my forest section, and the amphibious vehicle is always a nice touch of originality in a layout. yes you can use all those military things without creating an army in a layout: just put the violent parts out, and youve got nice things, like a biologist car in the case of the amphibious vehicle!

1 great set, i'll definitely get it. is there any sign of flesh on the soldiers, like at the collars?

1 is that a laptop it's on? does it come with the set? seriously though, it looks liek it has some good pieces, particularily the soldier's clothing and the crocodile hehe. hooray for new indy sets, lets hope the film is as good (it will be).

1 nice little review here alex, i like your idea to make the aquatic car into one for a geologist! i really like the little details in this set such as the little petrol can and the propeller at the back of the car, a must buy in my view! thanks again!

1 what are those bricks with the guns attached supposed to be? great review and set btw...

1 my favorite part of this is prob the amphibious vehicle! looks really neat! nice to see another (different) torso for marion...

1 thanks for the review! i really like this little-ish set, quite alot of detail, it reminds me of sets from the late 90's more soviets are always welcome too, and the new torso for marion is nice, as is the new dark green alligator all of the neat little accesories are great too, a cup, shovel, binoculars and of course the cans of gasoline again, thanks for the review, alex

0 darthperson8, on apr 15 2008, 07:12 pm, said: what are those bricks with the guns attached supposed to be? great review and set btw... some people have obliquely mentioned this in their responses to the set/review, but to specifically answer your question, it's supposed to be a jerrycan, a.k.a. a gasoline (petrol) container...

1 just like 7626 this is a must buy in my opinion. i just the amphibious vehicle,very nice for army building.

1 this set looks good. about the jerry cans, i like how they give me more pistols. this may be the only indy set i get from this batch. i'll just have to deal with the fleshie heads... (exchange them for yellow.) like stealth hunter said. this will be good for army building. silent help

1 set ref: 7626 name: jungle cutter number of minifigs: 4 number of pieces: unknown price: 39,99 a general view of the set: weve got 5 giant ants, two russian soldiers, a general, indy of course, 3 trees, a small entrance of a cave, and the debroussaillor vehicle (i dont know the english name of it). you cant enter into the cave, because there is a spider web with its spiderunless unless you know how the mechanism works and the spider web go up and reveals a case with diamonds and accessories. a closer view on the mechanism (which is simple but works well), and you can also see the difference, or maybe the same, size of a spider and a giant ant! and ive always thought that those spiders were very big compared to the minifigs! so those ants are really giant! poor small frog! the three trees with the entrance make a nice jungle layout! dont speak too loud, you will wake up the soldier dont worry for him, he will be waken up by the vehicle before being eaten by those giant ants! a front view, making the vehicle really menacing! a back view: push the red part from the back and there are two parts that fall down from the vehicle. i dont know why the movie will clarify this i think and here you can see how the two big circular blades turn when you push the vehicle simple but effective! run indy, run! this set is really nice. the playability of the different elements is great, the colour scheme is nice too (i like those dark green tree parts!). the vehicle is really impressive without being too big and its very well details! in general the designers of the indy sets have made a really nice works, with a lot of efforts in all those details everywhere! ive got some project for this set, to integrate it in my city... im a city mocer, and not an indy fan. so i dont have bought the temple, the bigger set of the series, because it has nothing special for me in term of part selections or in the design, in relation with the town theme, and because my supermarket doesnt have it yet! so, we are waiting for a member to review it and make the part 4

1 i like the creatures in this very much, and it is good to see the vehicle from different angles. thank you i think i shall buy this.

1 excellent review alex. thanks for sharing. i can't wait to buy this set once available. i really like the dark green leaf pieces. i like the cave/temple which will look great in my jungle diorama. blending the dark green and light green works well for the vehicle. overall, a neat little set.

1 great review, thanks for that. i love almost everything about this set. the ants, commies, general (can we please get a shot of his face?), dark green, treads, foliage and other creatures. great stuff, i'll have to get it on sale though. batbrick away!

1 wow in the protype pics i kept thinking this thing looked lame; a boat on treads with saw blades? but this is definetly something i want now. lots of great plant and animal parts. and looks like plenty of wheels with those treads; its just begging to be made into a propor tank.

1 great review, thanks a lot for all the pics. i agree that this is probably the nicest set of the indy 4 wave. so much dark green and i love all the plant pieces. it's been ages since we've had enough pieces in a regular release to build nice forests so it's great to see 11 of the dark green leaves in one set and all the vines! the design of the cutter looks very solid and brick built as well. giant ants are great looking too.

1 a great, detailed review for an excellent set! i love the jungle cutter vehicle itself, and all the dark green! it's great to have the trees and cave entrance; you can never have enough extras! the figs are nice too; two russian soldiers, the cool-looking general (i think his name is dovchenko or something) and the repeated-but-still-nice indy with rpg. thanks again, looks like i'll be picking this up along with jungle duel. (by the way, i think this set is called jungle cutter).

0 wow those trees look so weak compared to those enormous blades. anyway, a high-possibility-and-appeal-to-us-compulsive-lego-shoppers set, so, i'll try to get it, which means i'll obsesively look until i find. deforestation of puny trees, on!

1 thanks for the review alex i agree that this is the best set of kotcs sets (although the airplane comes quite close..). although i'm not too fond of the trees, the cave is good, and the jungle cutter is brilliant. plenty of great features, and very detailed, with much of the engine showing and a decent cockpit (if that's the right word..). the general and the two soviets are great too (could we have a close-up pic of them please? ), good to see that neither torso has exposed fleshy skin like the nazis. as said though, it is quite a pricy set, i was expecting it to be just over the price of race for the stolen treasure. great set, thanks again, alex!

0 here some close-up pics of the russian soldiers and the general : and i know that you have seen that i don't have put the stickers on...

1 ahhhhh now this swamp vehicle looks great to me, when i first heard lego were making it i was worried that it would be a poor version. however im pleased to see that it's not, even though i'm not a great fan of those treads. the trees don't really add anything to the set which is a shame, still the parts are welcome at least. the entrance is good though it could do with being bigger, but i guess we can moc that. i really like the commie general, he looks like a real bad megablocks

1 great review again alex !! same question (in case you didn't se it in my reply to the other set): where did you get those new sets ?? i really love that set !! its called jungle cutter the trees are really cool and make a great adition to it imo. that temple entrance or monument is really cool !! those bionicle parts do make fantastic vegetation !! i totally forgot about that green frog !! thats cool , those are so cute !! 5 more ants is great !! the vehicle look really sharp (ah ah ah). 2 more commies yeay !! that officer is really freaky actually !! could have been a high rank under pol pot's regime in the s21... yeay looks more asian than russian imo now its time for my grips: * same bloody rant about indy !! * i haven't read the instructions before but once again there are so many parts in crap colours that need to be changed look at all the crap red and yellow in there !! i will need to look for those parts before buying the set like i always do !! mod while building on !! i am really soimpressed with that indy line !! i sincerely hope it will have a long and healthy life !!

1 looks great

1 what a lovely set! i think i have to put this on my wishlist,just for that beautiful woodcutting tank thingie. 2008 is gonna get expensive for me

0 the thing and the set is called jungle cutter and the reason the front pops off is because indy blows it up with a bazooka incase you wanted to know. thanks for the nice review

1 this is the 3rd review, that i had read. it's very tempting to fly over and get those sets from there. because, i may need to wait for some months before it arrived. it seemed we will have a new small little creature to add into the ranks. these "red ants" is cute and of course looks nasty too. haha. i love those trees, foilage and plants very very much. it can be used for my moc and is good for any "green" project related expansion. i love it. about the vehicle, i find it abit wierd. it seemed too big in the set-up. hehe, but still i love this set. mainly, i will get it for the green parts

1 here's a review of the second largest set in the dragon masters subtheme for castle month, dark dragon's den! figs: the set comes with 3 dragon knights, two of which have the dragon wings on their helmets(sad thing is, one of my knights was missing the left wing on the helmet). there are also the definitive dragon, wiz the wizard (or majisto if you prefer)two horses, and a hawk( try to find him in each picture!) the set: there's a large spot under the mountain for the dragon to guard the treasure chest. the chest has 2 red and green 1x1 circles in it. another gate in the back, along with a door for knights. the right side of the mountain has a ladder and a removable rock face. the left side has some stairs leading up to the top. i love this tree design. simple yet effective. a shot of the top- hey, what are you doing?!? no!! throw him in the dungeon! overall: this set when first released in 1993 was priced at $43usd, although that might just be because of the juniorised pieces (6 burps!). it's a fun set that provides excellent playability. if you can find it at a $20-$30 price point, pick it up. overall grade: 8/10 edited by kimt, 10 august 2008 - 01:33 pm.

1 thanks every much for the review! i remember having this set, and making really terrible stop-motion movies with it. very playable. this brings back lot's of fond memories! thanks! majisto on!

0 ah, the wonderful dragon knight (or was it dragon masters?) sets. i personally preferred the black knights, but these guys still had some awesome sets! thanks for this review, this looks like a neat little set, although those modern stairs look a little out of place. that tree design is indeed a neat one, i remember having that in one dark forestmen set i got. the interior sure is roomy. may i suggest for future review you photograph the set on a cleared table, that way you won't get distracted by the clutter in the background and can focus on the main part of the image, the set. ~peace

1 this is probably one of my favourite sets and/or one of the sets which i wish i owned..the 90's was probably my favourite castle era! tobad i was to young to buy this set when it came out man i wish i had one of those dragons, they were one of the best type i reckon although all the dragon's are good thanks for the reveiw edited by hollisbrick, 16 april 2008 - 07:41 am.

1 yay, go dragon masters! i have to agree with iamded, i do like the black knights sets better for their design ( betrayal! ), however, the dragon knights are just awesome, 'cause they have dragons! this is a nice set, with some awesome minifigs and a nice overall design. i wish i had it... go masters!

1 agent rick: you're definately the dragon master around these parts. what a great little set. i really like the classic dragon which reminds me of a similar style used for the lego crocodiles. and the dungeon is pretty slick too. i like the use of the large gates plus the doors. plus the set contains the blue wizard. awesome! great review.

1 a very neat set with charming mfs and a great classic dragon, a good use of burps and a really nice tree indeed. thanks for the review, agentrick57!

1 this was the last castle set i got before my dark age.. really liked it although the big rock parts looked really bad ( i am kind of used to them now) unfortunately i lost the little wand.. and i never understood who is "good" and who is "bad" does the wizard own the dragon? well they dont seem to be enemies but isnt the dragon supposed to be evil??

1 i own this set and i think its a great for a smaller fortress building. there is a good selection of mini figs, the burps do detract somewhat from the set, but they do make it feel as if its in a large cave. the cloth flags that are included are really nice and mine have lasted a long time.

1 the 8291 dirt bike comes from a long line of technic bikes, and i think it's the best ever. it looks great, and it's fun to ride around in the house. i hoped to find a figure the right size for it, but none of mine would fit. unlike a lot of technic models, it looks good from all angles. considering the size of the model it has a complicated way of connecting the engine to the wheel. the rear shocks are just the right stiffness... ...and they have a good amount of travel. i thought these shocks were new. i need to get out more... functions: shocks: two front, one stiffer one in the rear. drivetrain: 2 piston engine linked to the rear wheel via gears and a chainlink. steering: yes it does... stand: retractable. for the price, size and subject, what else could be added? 10/10 parts: considering that it has three shocks and a 40 chainlinks it's a great set for parts. some hard to use large parts are included, but they are not overused. the usage of the green does limit part usage somewhat though, and i'll be struggling to find a use for those wheels for anything other than a motorbike. 8/10 price: at $39.99 aud for 248 parts it isn't the best value set. the us price is $25.00 which is somewhat better. it does have some more complicated parts however. 7/10 looks: lego seems to be moving away from the see-though look for technic sets and this is a good example of it. i'm not a big fan of fairings but i think they work great in this set as a fuel tank. 8/10 fudge: this set was great for me as i have never had a technic bike. however for those that want this for just parts or have other bikes it could be a hard sell. the alternate model (a chopper) is a complete rebuild (which i didn't make), and it's great that lego have been including these most of the time lately. 7/10 overall: recommended. 8/10

1 i think the green motocross bike looks great. i like the use of fairings on this bike. the only thing i really don't like about the technics bikes in general, is the "clumsy" design of the chaindrive. it sticks way to much out to the side. if they made a really big bike model, it would be more in place with this chain drive. i'm not sure if it wouldn't be possible to design a shaft drive to the rear wheel, ala bmw style. but the green "kawasaki" look great with the front and rear suspension. i have the street bike, 8420, a somewhat larger and more complicated set, and will probably add the motocross bike to my collection soon. it would be great if lego could make a line of bikes, like they do the ferrari line. front

1 a very good review, thanks, sinner. thats really a pretty cool model, very detailed with useful parts too.... hmm, perhaps that ones gonna get the first technic set ill buy, beside that 4481 hailfire droid.... um, thank you, sinner....

0 sinner, on apr 23 2008, 10:37 am, said: i'll try to take a photo this weekend. well, i took the photo but didn't get around to posting it! here it is with a smaller gear. i think it looks better... ...the problem is that it's too tight and it doesn't rotate as freely anymore. adding another link makes it too loose! thus the set is probably the way it is as it's the gear that fit best.

0 how did i manage to miss this review? i must have overlooked it somehow... thanks for making this one sinner, it's always nice to see reviews of technic sets. i'm not so sure whether i like this set, i am not that much into motorbikes, but lego did a good job on this one. it looks a lot like an upgraded version of one of the first bikes lego made, namely the 8838 shock cycle. i also believe the back gearwheel is somewhat oversized, it looks better with the smaller one you attached. it is good to see that lego is back to making the technic sets the way they were (except for the green, that is )

1 i wasn't very interested in this set at first. it seemed to be just a nice looking truck with a small motor... but when i found out it had a transmission i changed my mind! here is the transmission. it allows the single motor to be used for two functions. this system has been around for a while, and lego seem to be using it more and more. the transmission driving ring alone (the red circle) goes for $5-15 usd on bricklink, and you also need the catch and clutch gear so i have been buying sets that have them instead. i now have enough parts to make a supercar gearbox. (i bet a new supercar comes out next year now...) this is the gear that rotates the arm. note the colour of the 24 tooth gear; it seems to be a new gear trend. a lot of work has been put into this truck looking real. personally i think they went too far as the truck seems to have been designed for a tilting cab, but it's disabled to prevent breaking the front. bottom of the transmission. the bottom shaft lifts the arm. note that there are more dark grey gears. the motor fits in very well also. the bottom of the arm. i was surprised by the usage of a 12 tooth bevel to link with the 36 tooth double bevel as i had never seen that done before. as you can see there is no room for any drive train. standard steering for a recent technic truck. there is a hand-of-god at the cab top that links via two knob wheels. it looks good from the back. you can also see the white clutch that connects the transmission to the motor to avoid burnouts. it goes decently high, and can go a bit higher if you use the crane arm. compared to last years fire truck. (if i didn't buy the fire truck for half price i would have been annoyed that lego brought out what is almost a motorised version of the same set.) functions: cherry picker arm: motorised rotate and lift that links to a motor via a transmission and anti-burnout clutch. steering: rack and pinion controlled via a hand-of-god linked by knob wheels doors: open and close. good functionality that works well, but i wish they made the cab lift and i'm a bit sick of the lame fairing door trick. 7/10 parts: motor, battery box, transmission, clutch, practical wheels, only two fairings, compact turntable... this is a great parts set. 10/10 price: at $99.99 aud for 726 parts it's ok value when you consider what you are getting. the us price is $60.00 which is better, but still not great. i bought mine for $80 aud which was good however, and i suspect that the price is designed for easy sale...8/10 looks: i'd buy this for the looks alone! 9/10 fudge: the functions work well and i llked it more than i thought i would. oddly mine seemed to be missing a axle pin with friction, but since it includes extra parts for the alternate model i didn't mind using one of my spares. on the subject of the alternate model, it is a dump truck which is made out to be a total re-build, but it isn't. it could have easily been done like super street sensation was, but lego have probably determined that instructions like that confuse people. 8/10 overall: recommended. 8/10

0 great review! i never have been interested in this set. i am saving my money for a grey technic set or thatt technic ferrari set...

1 thank you for that fine review of a pretty cool and nice set with a very good amount of functionality and, um, playability, for sure.

0 thanks for the review! i think i am going to get this set for it's many technic pieces. i could really use those for a rig i'm going to build.

0 looks like an interesting set. i didn't realize the motor controlled two functions through a transmission switch. that's always good to see. i'll probably pass it up though until the price falls a bit. the overall design is a bit too studless for my liking (i think the 8275 bulldozer has a much better balance of studded and studless pieces), and the wheels somehow look too small to me. i also have something of a backlog at the moment; i still need to pick up that bulldozer along with the 8421 mobile crane (on ebay).

0 wow, it's a smarty set with drive shafts (we are everybody!) and technical junk. the specs and stuff kind of lose me but the walrus looks really cute in the cherry picker! i imagine he's saving a kitten. but really, this is a great review and has a wealth of detail and knowlege for techni-philes! thanks for providing such a cool resource for eb! i really did enjoy delving in to the world of technic for a few moments. the walrus rides it ... oh, he's so smart.

1 svelte_corps, on apr 30 2008, 10:44 pm, said: and what everyone's been waiting for, the skullies - three of 'em and a conquistador skellie - very cute. note the backs of the crystal head have a plume-sized hole - or maybe that's just where they injected the blue brain-plastic. spooky! i love these skulls, i wasn't sold from the initial pics but they have a very creepy smile and the head shape is just... weird. with the large eyes, it's kind of homer simpson-esque. they reminded me more of the movie "coneheads", but i think your description is more accurate. looking forward to the rest of the review!

0 tinypiesrus, on may 1 2008, 12:18 pm, said: i was really hoping that the conquistador helmet would end up being silver in the final set, but i suppose it's good to know that the helmet is being porduced again anyway. and is the armour the skellie is wearing pearl gold? hi tinypiesrus - i love that helmet too! if only we had plumes again... soon hopefully! the armour is pearl silver, not gold.

0 tinypiesrus, on may 1 2008, 12:57 pm, said: oh sorry, my mistake. so is it pearl silver, as opposed to metallic silver? definitely pearl edit: btw, the sets are now appearing on shop at home! edited by svelte_corps, 01 may 2008 - 06:03 am.

1 thanks svelte_corps for the great review, if it's out in aussie then it should hopefully be reaching nz soon. i can't wait! this looks like a great set, for me at least. i too am a great fan of spooky old temples, they are such fun. i love the look of the base plate, but the stickers don't look all that great. i wish they printed it like they always used too. i have to get this set. and the other ones too. thanks again, you have brightened this sad day.

1 outstanding review! your efforts have totally convinced me to get this set no matter what! it really looks very great and funz reading that review. i will be looking forward to the new addition of those mini-figs. just love the layout of this temple. a great addition indeed

0 thanks for the reveiw it was a enjoyable and good one! i really like this set!!! too bad it's beyond my price range, i guess i'll just get the smaler set. what suprised me is that there is no giant ants i'm guessing you live in aus.? where did you get this set from???

0 great in-depth review!!! svelte, i love your cat! :) :)

1 i was going to review this on monday but my camera ran out of batteries! anyways, great review! as i have the set built, it's a really fantastic set. the waterfall is a reall cool sticker, and the flick fire missiles are quite interesting. another point of interest: there are seven of the new flick fire missiles overall, if anyone cares.

1 nice big set ! thanks for the review. the skellies seem to me as the only really big plus of the whole lot. i agree on the homer simpsons' paternity to them...

0 great~!! your cat is soooooo cute~

0 thank you for the nice review. off-topic: i heard something on lowlug that tlc cancelled 2624 (little set with indy, mutt, irina and tent). have anybody heard something about that? that would be not so nice.

1 svelte_corps, on may 1 2008, 02:44 am, said: (e) central turret thing this thing is kind of annoying and doesn't really sit or work well. it's kind of like a laser beam sending messages to space, i guess. as the central dome rises, the two plates peel away. i find it is a little bit tight to work smoothly and the two plates doesn't really sit well together at the top. maybe i just need to rebuild it. i'm sure this will also be explained in the movie. great review! now i'm really truly convinced that i'm gonna buy this set. my faith was a little wobbly, but its benn restored anyway, i just wanted to point out that the temple's entrance might actually be the turret thing. if you watch the teaser, there are some very similair stone pillars surrounded by sand (there are 4 not 2 though ) and when they close up it looks like all our characters are sucked into the sand and magically appear underground going through some stone plates(which act like steps to go down) that dissapear. so, in theory those steps beneath the turret are actualy the entrance, and i'm asumming from this picture that the steps with 1x8 bricks with the dragon heads at the end lead us of somewhere else. all in all this temple looks like a mixed up version of the real temple, which is fine by me (sidenote: i'm not sure but based on minifig inclusion, either lego was cheap or colonel dovchenko is dead by the time irina and her goons reach the temple, i'll wait till i see the movie. ) edited by belloq, 02 may 2008 - 02:14 am.

1 nice review! got this set yesterday and u have to say, that amphibious vehicle rocks!!!

0 great review, thanks! as i thought, amazon did send out my pre-ordered sets not until yesterday evening, so i should receive them (hopefully) on monday or tuesday. can't wait for them! btw., i wonder what's up with all these sticker leftovers in the indy sets..this hasn't been the case in any other set with stickers, right? edited by metalandi, 03 may 2008 - 01:56 pm.

0 i brought this set a few days ago and agree with everything you say. i would have never noticed that the boat sticker is the set number unless you pointed it out. glad to see that one set of fuel can stickers was extra, i spent ages looking for a place to put them. cool review btw

0 nice review! although you need to use the macro setting(a.k.a. the flower setting) for better pics. are you using a digital camera? you really need macro... the idea is, turn it on and hold down on the 'take picture' button halfway until the pic focuses. then press it down all the way to take the pic. i'm glad this one also comes with the new uzi; i wanted an extra...

1 thank you for the nice, in-depth review! i have to say, lego did a good job on the amphibious vehicle. p.s.- if you need photo taking help, pm me and i can give you some handy tips.

0 nice review wilhelm screamer! very thorough. the pictures are a little dark and blurry, though. i made a tutorial here for amateur photography tips. i also edited your first post to include a link to alex's review. great job!

1 very good for a first review! i bought this set and jungle duel at target the other day (i was going to wait and buy them when i go to downtown disney this summer, but how could i pass up saving four bucks that i can spend on store-exclusives? ) and i have to say i absolutely love them. the amphibious vehicle (don't they call it a duck in the movie?) is definitely my favorite lego vehicle i've ever built. everything about it is wonderful- the size, the colour scheme, and it's accurate to the one in the movie. and irina spalko's hair is to die for. on a side note, i don't get why they made marion's arms white in the set. the shirt underneath her vest in the movie is obviously blue. i switched the arms out for light blue ones and it looks a lot better, and it makes marion's eyes look great. -ryan

0 what a fantastic set. i'm overwelmed with feelings of nostalgia by seeing this review. the playability factor of this set is as high as it can be. thanks for making and sharing this awesome review !

0 metalandi thanks for this wonderful lovely review. i enjoyed myself very much when i am looking through at the lovely pictures. i must admit, this is what i called a "real classic" race prix i miss those cute sweet little race cars which is able to contain a mini-fig. furthermore, this set offers 4 race cars and 13 mini-figures in addition, if town collectors remember, the car number tiles are printed instead of using stickers. this is the other set i owned, which holds the similarity above. 6381: motor speedway overall, great review! simonwillems, on may 9 2008, 02:20 am, said: i recently made an entire racetrack together with this set and to promote myself i will place a link here i saw your entire racetrack. it looks real exciting and i love your layout, real nice! edited by whitefang, 15 may 2008 - 09:56 am.

0 nice reveiw i would fork out $100 aud for that set its just so bueatiful if only tlg re-released this

0 thank you for the nice review metalandi, and thank you for the nice story and selfpromotion simon willems. the racewaytracks were always nice dioramas in the catalogues of the eighties.

1 i can remember when i saw this set in lego catalogues, looking at it, dreamin to have it.... like so many other sets... and this one is still a dream... i really like the design of this set, it looks really complete, with some nice details. there are no lost place. the strairs withe the foot bridge add a lot to it imo. looking at the pics, i've got a question : is the "rescue rig" trailer one piece or is it brick build?

-1 awesome review batbrick! i don't see any appeal at all really in this set, but that's okay, as i want to stick to castle anyway. the car is the best part imo, which you can get in a different set with another cool car and for a cheaper price. but the main downfall to this set is the fact that the truck's trailer is half blown up and the survivors are magically staying inside and not being sucked right out of there, as you have mentioned. i would have thought tlc would at least included some sort of cover that you could take on and off easily (kind of like the modular buildings). having said all that though, the front of the truck does look incredibly cool, and those minifigs are sweet. too bad they all have flesh tone printed on them. so, while this may not be my set of choice, i can see the appeal... well, really i can't, but it's just my opinion! i'm sure there are plenty others who would love to scoop this set up. ~peace

0 thanks for that fine review, batbrick. the most interesting part of the set, for me, are the neat mfs.... the trailer looks really pretty skeletal. however.... its a nice little play set andll fit its purpose i guess.

0 nice review. good pictures, thanks. i think i may get a couple of the smaller sets, as i think these will become collectors sets in years too come, not sure this range will be that popular? love the minifigs though.

-1 batbrick thanks for the sweet review. you give me great insights into this set. hehe, i agreed that racer x is nice, but i believe we can get it in the other set for a much lower price. for me, the trailer which does not have a cover is bugging me alot. that's why, i holding my reservations against this set. at most, i will consider the other 2 smaller sets for collection purpose. nevertheless, batbrick great job

0 thank you for the nice review

1 i really like this set: my favorite parts are the minifigs and x's car. vrooom!

0 i enjoyed the review. some cool fleshie heads and parts, but it does seem a bit lamer even than i imagined from the box (the "airy" truck is rather slyly disguised on the box art). i would like to get it if it is ever on sale, 50% off would be nice :) speed racer lego doesn't seem to be selling too well in local shops here.

0 nice review--i'm surprised these are out already. i'll probably end up passing on this one. even with the surprise. :)

1 good review.i think the sets amazing!

1 the batman minifig have a detailed and cool torso. thanks for the review brickbitz. edited by darkrebellion, 16 may 2008 - 07:31 pm.

0 that is a very nice and quick review! thanks for giving us a quick summary. not much comments on this set, as i do not really go into batman theme yet. however, the ice cream truck in the set interest me. apart from that, nothing much yet. who knows, maybe i will change my mind in the future.

1 nice review, brickbitz. i actually think this kit is really very nice for the size. true, you only get three figures, but it seems that's a norm in most batman sets. besides, everything else is great. the tumbler looks like an amazing build - they really nailed this tank of a ride. and the ice cream truck... plus, this set does seem to have some neat pieces in it (trans green popsicles and lime hubcaps, anyone?). i think this far beats the rest of the batman lineup this year, which seems quite disapointing overall. edited by grevious, 16 may 2008 - 08:12 pm.

1 it's on the way! and also the buggy!

0 oh wait, is that torso dark grey or light grey?

0 ronan nissen, on may 16 2008, 10:05 pm, said: oh wait, is that torso dark grey or light grey? it's definitely dark grey.

0 great review, as always! although i know you don't take many pictures in your reviews(imho, ) but can we see a little more about the tumbler? is that little windshield down near the bottom front a third seat? what is in the framework of the back, behind the cockpit? i know there's a blunt shooter and flick fire missiles, but is it all framework?

0 trooperdavinfelth, on may 16 2008, 11:11 pm, said: although i know you don't take many pictures in your reviews(imho, ) but can we see a little more about the tumbler? i'll get some set up tomorrow in better light. to be honest there isn't a lot to see, most of it is just basic technic blocks underneath with all the slopes built up on top.

1 nice review i really can't believe that it is out already! i love that new batman suit and the tumbler have they made the posicles before? this is sure a must have!

0 brickbitz, on may 16 2008, 11:41 pm, said: i'll get some set up tomorrow in better light. to be honest there isn't a lot to see, most of it is just basic technic blocks underneath with all the slopes built up on top. some more pics of the tumbler.

1 the tumbler is massive! i'll struggle to fit it into the cave, but never mind. the figs are nice, the tumbler is pretty accurate (or at least, it will be after i've moded it), and joker's tainted ice cream van is so very joker. thanks for the review, btw.

0 hey brickbitz, i love how your review is not biased 10 ups. in the end, you said, "overall slightly disappointing." most people post reviews only with praise, but i'm glad you take both sides . enjoyed the review just like others have, thanks so much

1 general grievous reviewed by dunamis set 10186 1,085 pieces $89.95 from lego shop @ home build time 3.5 hours it is the start of summer here in california and along with the weekly deluge of new action films we start to see some of the next wave of star wars lego sets. the latest offering from our favorite building toy company is none other than the infamous general grievous! no doubt you all know the story of grievous; two parts technic and one part human and his hatred of the jedi. follow along as we get a close-up view of the mighty general. no doubt the observant will wonder why i purchased this set from shop @ home instead of my trusty lego store in glendale. well, its really as simple as two things: ive been traveling a lot and didnt have time to drive to the store to get it and gas is now $4/gallon and i would likely spend more in gas than the $9 shipping cost to get it to me. so there you have it. the box: a gigantic box (much larger than expected) held the mighty general. were back to the perforated tabs on the side and two stickers on the front that let the box lift open: inside, we have 17 bags, two manuals and three stickers on a relatively small sticker sheet. the manuals: the manuals are not terribly thick in fact the second manual is noticeably thinner than the first. they come in at 75 and 31pages. interesting to note on the back we see the next (and more interesting) wave of sets later this summer. nothing new to report on the manuals as they provide the lego standard of high quality and features we expect. - piece callouts - models divided into sections - large images - page numbers since there were links posted to the .pdf files of the instructions online, im sure you can all get an idea of the manual and the parts inventory. however, for those of you without access to the internet here are photos of the parts inventory pages: random manual image: features page: the pieces: the short answer is you get lots and lots of little pieces in white, gray and black plus some big pieces in white, gray and black. mixed in the set is a fair amount of oddball pieces like minifig tools, jedi hood and trans yellow dome. fear not, despite the eclectic collection of parts, it all comes together in the end (not unlike a typical day at work for me) it is probably worth noting again that there is a heavy amount of technic parts and pieces here. the build: the build starts off with a rather in-depth build of the stand in which general grievous stands on. once you think you are done, you keep adding on to this (rather solid) base. i bet there are 250 pieces just in the base alone! it is quite nice when you get done with it though and really adds to the display. im glad lego didnt skimp on the base as it completes the model. once you get through all that, the rest of the build is a real thumb-bruiser. anyone who has built a decent size technic set knows the feeling of your thumbs being sore when you are done. you get the same effect here. it is actually a fun build and i really liked seeing how the designers used all the various pieces to recreate a fairly accurate model of grievous. the model is built from the ground up as seen in a few of the progress shots: here is what is left over: the design: the design is quite good and is very accurate. some might be disappointed that since this is a technic set we dont have more articulation in the shoulders and have the ability to separate two arms into four as seen in the movie. however, it would seem the real intent is for display and not functionality. here is a shot of the torso and the detail involved: here are grievous organs: careful observers will note that my model is lacking two arrow stickers from the two white chest pieces. i failed to see these on the sticker sheet and only grabbed the large grievous sticker. so, note that there are actually three stickers and not one. chest protector and respirator: head and arms: i was a little disappointed that we got two yellow blades and no green blades on the lightsabers. note how all the lightsabers have different hilts which is a nice touch: here are some shots of the completed model with a few other sets shown for scale. he is actually pretty tall: you have the option to remove the top two arms and put in shoulder plates if you so desire: detail on the back: overall thoughts: ive been saying for a few years that we should have a technic grievous set and we finally got one. designed more as a model and not a fully functional swooshable figure, grievous is a tad flimsy. you wont want him to veer too far off his massive and sturdy base. it would have been nice to have is cape with him (like the technic vader set). i do like the size of the model and it is impressive to look at. lego star wars system fans will likely want to think twice before purchasing but technic and ucs fans should be satisfied. final rating: 75% build 8/10 (very good  fun, relatively quick build. technic fans will be more pleased than others.) design 8/10 (very good  some nice snot and technic techniques. a bit flimsy but the base is kind of cool.) parts 7/10 (a mixed bag of stuff. probably cant get too many diverse builds from this except for other robot type models.) price 7/10 (just ok  a bit stiff at $90 usd for a nice display model with limited functionality.) as always, lets hear your thoughts and feedback.

-1 thanks so much dunamis for your awesome review . yeah i think tlc miss the cape, it would be cool to own one but when we were talking of the 2008 sets around july of last year i can remember someone said it would come with cape. finally is a little dissapoint tlc miss it . edited by darkrebellion, 16 may 2008 - 07:20 pm.

1 excellent review, dunamis. this set looks great. the designers really though the kit out, it seems. the internal organs have got to be my favorite part, but everything is good. now all we need is a ucs obi-wan with a laser pistol to finish off grievous in a totally anti-climatic way!

0 i do a easy answer to you dunamis and just double post cms answer... i was there as well! copmike, on may 17 2008, 12:42 am, said: nice review dunamis ! i built it two weeks ago on the legoworld speedbuild in oslo and didnt have time to get the "feel" during that crazy race. i agree with you that the base is nice & sturdy, makes it stand real still ! im looking forward on your next score! four eyes arms on copmike sturdy on!! -ras-

1 cool! i like the idea of using the hood as an organ! dunamis reviews on!

1 thanks for this very detailed review dunamis! didn't think that gg were that big he looks pretty good to me, but i'll save the 90 for the upcoming cw sets

1 thanks for that fine review, dunamis. i really like that set.... ggs an interesting and well designed movie character and that lego version of hims indeed well done and very detailed. and although i would wish for a some more functional (or playable ) feature of move- and even splitable arms i guess its an already very cool ucs version of that grumpy old kaleesh....

1 awesome review, dunamis! that's such a sweet set, i loved it as soon as i thoroughly examined the online instructions. it looks way awesome in the brick, my favourite part has to be the eyes. very cool, and creepy. thanks again for the info, and of course the pics! ~peace

0 welcomestranger, on may 17 2008, 06:14 am, said: luckily for me i have access to the internet to read this review in the first place lol, i was wondering if anyone would get my lame attempt at humor

0 dunamis, on may 16 2008, 07:01 pm, said: two parts technic and one part human one part kaleesh, actually

0 an excellent review with superb presentation dunamis . when the time comes i hope your able to get your hands on the other new sw sets and review them just as good.

-1 snice review! (super nice) though i think i'll pass on this one, i really dislike the head. what's with the frame around the neck and the clip under the head? that, and i don't really care for ucs or technic stuff. the base looks nice though!

1 this is a very nice, i never gotten to chance to own or buy one of the sw big sets. i'm definitely getting these one.

0 legoscum, on may 17 2008, 04:03 pm, said: you forgot to add the stickers to the chest plates too. jeremy yeah, i know. i mentioned it in the review that i completely blew past the other two stickers. if you look closely, you can see that the big grievous nameplate sticker is off-center as well. me and stickers don't get along...

0 great review, very detailed indeed!

0 nice review i hope to get this set for my birthday!

0 thanks for the great review! sad to say, as cool as he looks, he's a sale-only set for me.

1 the walker reminds me of the old kenner cap-2 captivator which is good.

1 thanks very much for the review brickbitz! i love this year's mars mission line, and though this is the weakest set, it is still a major improvement. the mech is very cool and well made, and the commander is one of my favourite alien figs ever. the alien ship is pretty good, better than last years ones but not extremely good either, but i still like the set. batbrick away!

1 thanks for the sweet review, brickbitz! that really is a neat little set, that walker is fantastic, most likely the best part of the set. though the alien craft does also look neat, and it's cool how it can fold down into aa walker. or rather, a sentry turret, seeing as it can't really move while in that mode. still, it's nice. my favourite part is the mini mining robot though. so cute! ~peace

1 thanks for that interesting review, brickbitz. the alien fighter looks pretty nice, nothing special but streamlined and fast nevertheless. that transforming features a nice addition for sure, and these new flicker missile with its launch apparatus.... hmm, i hope i wont spend quite some time in search of that little 'rocket' piece.... however, theres still something i miss with these alien crafts.... i dont know.... i like some more organic looking design, and they even come in some nice and different shapes, but still.... perhaps a real space fighter just needs a solid cockpit, cool windscreens and controls to satisfy my odd likings. that 'exo suit' looks really good and i wonder why its a little underrepresented on the box art. the jet pack/space scooters a really good idea, and the only thing i hatere those darned studless technic beams.... it could look so much better with a studded version of these parts. but of course thats only due to my personal preferences.

0 thanks for the review brickbitz i don't normally come into the space forum but this set it tempting me, on the basis of you review i think i might aquire one at some point.

0 the rancor, on may 18 2008, 01:38 pm, said: damn!!! i was just about to post a review on this why not.... multiple reviewsre doing no harm, and its always interesting to see reviews with a perhaps different point of view too....

1 thanks for the review nice little set and its around $20.00!

0 the rancor, on may 18 2008, 06:38 am, said: damn!!! i was just about to post a review on this here's the infiltrator with the nice shiny holographic stickers! mars_mis...tor_tiny.jpg there's nothing stopping you from posting a review as well...

1 hi y'all! guess what happened today? when walked into my toys 'r' us in fullerton, ca, just to buy a simple tiny turbo racer, what do i see? all the agents sets sitting on the shelf, ready for the taking! i didn't have too much money with me, so i just got 2 of 8631 mission 1: jetpack pursuit! it's a really cool little set, so i thought i'd review this puppy for you! i shall proceed in the order of the instructions. so, let's get started! the minifigs let's begin with the minifigs, saw fist and agent chase! they are really cool, some of the coolest minifigs i have seen in a while! i took off saw fist's wig & chainsaw so you can see his head and cybernetic arm better! here is a back view of saw fist, and - surprise! agent chase has a double sided head! one side with his cool "mission face" with sunglasses and headset, and one with his casual bruce wayne type face (note, though, that it is not really the bruce wayne face). his wig, btw, is mutt's hairpiece in black! very neat! poor saw fist seems to be forced to always drag his chainsaw around for it is way too long to just hang down from his shoulder like a normal arm. the snowmobile next up, we have the snowmobile, a sleek little vehicle with only minor design flaws! the container with the jewel is attached to the vehicle by a single stud, so it doesn't fall off, but is easy to pick up! in the pic below you can see the only two tiny design flaws: thanks to the exhaust pipes, the laser cannon (or whatever it's supposed to be) can't be lowered any further than this. also, the corners of that slope-ish piece that the handle bar rests on are sticking out a little at the sides. other than that, it's pretty well done! the jetpack finally, there is the jetpack! imo, a name like autogyro-pack or something would make more sense, but whatever. although a little bulky, the jetpack is very well designed! the rotor can be tilted back, and at the lower back of the jetpack, there is hook with which you can grab the container with the jewel from the snowmobile. what i like best about the jetpack is that although it is attached to the minifig in kinda the same way as that of the riddler, this one doesn't rotate around. so, the agent is being held in place steadily! "see ya later, chainsaw-cyborg-dude!" stickers this set comes with a surprisingly large sticker sheet. the reason is that half of it are extra stickers! there are two large agents logos and one inferno logo - perfect for agents mocs! there are also a star and a small, round sticker portraying the number of the mission. the star seems to be part of some kind of game where you collect the stars from all sets on an agents id that you get from the mission 5 set. i don't know, though, if you get any gain from this except for becoming a full-status lego agent! below, you can find the list of parts from this set! click here for a better quality pic! that's pretty much it! i hope you liked this review and will run straight to your next toy store to get one or more of this set! this was my very first set review! so any questions, comments, or requests? any more pics you want me to take? would you like me to exchange the chainsaw with something else, or do you want me to try the agent's new hairpiece out on another fig? if so, just tell me! see ya! edited by oky wan kenobi, 25 june 2009 - 08:21 pm.

1 thanks for the excellent review oky! judging by this set, the line is going to be promising. i really like the figs and i'm glad to see that robot arm is actually a new arm mold. awesome!! can a minifig hand fit in the end or just the chainsaw attachment? could it fit an exo-force robot claw? there's a lot of detail in the torsos and i like that the agent's suit is like a moto-cross uniform. i love that the snowmobile has a working tread. copmike, ras and i tried to build a snowmobile with working treads, but we ended up using chainsaw blades in the end. great work oky!

0 that's a great review for your first one. i think the jet pack if far to bulky it could do with some minimising but thats life. i assume that you cant fit a standard hand in the chainsaw arms are the hole would be to large but would you be so good as to confirm this for me? overall i quite like the jet ski and the ability to lower the arms to much doesnt both me. how much was it just so i can get an idea of the price? finally thanks for posting this review so quickly.

1 this is much much much more promising than the 2008 batman set for $10.00. the vehicle looks like someone took time to design it, but the batman one looks like . lego dear lego, where is the quality for batman??!?! i really like the new cyborg arm, and the propellers on that thing : ), it is a really promising line although i would get rid of all those bionicle pieces.

1 thanks for the great review oky wan the two vehicles look quite nice for a small set and the minifigs look great! the two sided head is nice, although it would've been nice if it was a new head rather than the standard frowning face. the cyborg looks good, nice and cartoony, i like the printing on his back. the belt on the hips should be useful, not to mention the robotic hand. i assume that anything that fits into a 1x1x1 cylinder can fit in it? i hope so thanks again oky. any chance you can get any more sets?

0 thanks for the review. i'm looking forward to some of the new parts and ideas in this line. the figures look great. the actual sets themselves don't really appeal though.

0 huhm .. i like the idea of the agent-id .. but offcourse all they want with that is that you buy all six sets .. but it can be a good idea for children, they wouldn't think of "hey they get all money only because i have a little card with stars" or something. well, not to rant, i think it's good. also, can you make that name yourself? maybe set 5 comes with a extra stickersheed with all letters, that would be nice "agent rupee" a very nice review oky wan kenobi. =rupee

0 thanks, guys! i really tried to make it a good first review! now to answer your questions: the robot arm can fit ef robot claws and anything that a minifig can hold in his hand or that would fit into a 1x1x1 cylinder, so normal minifig hands are too small to fit. tlg is using the robot claw idea for the main villain of the agents line! do you still want me to try it out and take pics? the price was 10.99 usd at the tru i bought it at. i bet it'ss be a dollar less on s@h! and i'm sorry, but i probably won't get any more sets any time soon. i have to save my money for all the other good set that are to come. but if i would get another set, it would just be the one with the helicopter and the all-silver car! if anyone gets this set, can he/she please review it? thanks! any other questions i can answer for you guys? edited by oky wan kenobi, 18 may 2008 - 08:59 am.

1 nice first review oky wan ! id say this is better than we first thought. the minifigs looks cool and the overall look is ok. and the excaustpipe is a new peace also i think? agents on copmike

1 i kind of like the set. as said it has a very cartoonish style to it so i'm guessing the kids are going to love it. and as a parent i'll love it if the construction isn't to fragile. ;) i'll probably be getting a few for myself but only as parts pack. copmike, on may 18 2008, 11:29 am, said: and the excaustpipe is a new peace also i think? yeah and it's all over this years releases. from what i've seen so far it's found in: racers, speed racers, mars mission and exo-force sets. i just wish that instead of a 2x1 plate with an exhaustpipe in each end they would have made it an 1x1 plate with a single exhaust. that would have been a lot more useful.

0 omg omg omg. im coming to the us in just under two weeks, really hope i see them somewhere! does anyone know what ny times square toys r us is like for new sets?

-1 good review! thanks oky wan. hmm, although i really like the villain (not just the new arm, i think the color is very... villanous, as all bond-villains with class have minions in uniforms. it's even possible to fill out their numbers with exo-force grunts of the same color) i'm not that hot for the agent himself, his uniform... nah. it doesn't even look like clothes, just give the man a suit or some nifty leather. i think i'll try to grab some sets from the agents line just for the new parts (to begin with... mocs may follow, who knows?) when they are available in stores here in sweden. haven't seen them yet, though indiana jones just got here so there might be some further waiting for me. now i want to see reviews of the other sets :)

1 what a lovely set, thanks for that fine review, oky wan kenobi! the mfsre wonderful, that helipack looks solid and well done and i especially like the slightly asymmetrical design of the neat snowmobile. a very playable little set for sure, and the most interesting parts for sure that new cool mf arm....

0 they are already on the shelfs? that's kinda weird, since there aren't even the instructions online yet

0 yay, oky wan! wow, the agents line is looking good so far. the jetpack is pretty nice, and the minifigs... my dad was in portland just yesterday, and if i'd have called an hour sooner, he might have been able to get to the tru...

0 great review!thank youvery much! i think this line is much more promising than most orginally thought it would be. i'm onmy way to see ifican find the big rig right now!

0 thanks for the review! do i see a little indy hint on that map? oh and btw., the map looks like it actually is printed am i right?

1 looks good, and i'll bet that jaw and wire could be used for lots of mocs... is this the only agents set that contains the wire? while i'm here: i got the third mission, would anyone like a review of that? faramir

0 that would be great! i still wonder why the instructions aren't up yet, though..

1 mmm this set looks amazing. lovely pieces. and i actually like the minifig faces. that jaw helmet is cool aswel . are those stickers on the crocodile heads or is it printed?

1 not many words this time, but as they say: a picture is worth a thousand words - and your pictures are lovely! once again, agents is turning out to be a cooler and cooler theme with each new review. this set looks like an awesome parts pack, and i love the bike! btw, anyone else notice the possibly accidental reference to alpha team? agent charge is back, it looks! edited by grevious, 21 may 2008 - 09:05 pm.

1 thanks for the review, this set is wonderful! u love the two dark green crocodiles and awesome minifigs, especially break jaw that bike is awesome and the base, like all agents sets, comes with great pieces, like the barbed wire, orange anything, leafy pieces and brown log pieces. thanks for the review, i'll definitely get this one! batbrick away!

1 great little set, nice to have a small building instead of all vehicles. plant pieces and dark green crocs always welcome. good parts selection for the price. thanks for the review! can't wait till we can get our hands on these!

1 like all the others, (except the truck) this set is great. love the figs and the green crocidiles.

1 nice set... im definately gonna pick it up when i see it. i like the design of the base and it comes with lots of usefull an neat pieces.

1 great looking set! im determined to get all the agent sets this summer. comments: swamp tower-the barbed wire is cool, but it seems like its only for looks. bike-cool looking, but doesnt seem to have any controls. cybercrocs-wow, havent seen any of these pieces for a while, and in dark green, awesome! agent charge-sweet head, definitely cool. break jaw-he looks like the result of some animal testing on humans gone horribly wrong. i hope they come out near me soon.

1 wow, thanks for the great review, sirnadroj! the overall set is what attracted me in the first place, that elevated hut and swampy setting just sucked me right in! it all looks really nice to me, a definite buy. that agents head would make a great indy, for those opposed to fleshies. and that monobrow, i mean, villain guy looks very... er... well, the monobrow is unique, thought i noticed the suit looks a bit skin tight in the crotchal area. don't look at me like that, you saw it too! anyway, the helmet's the best part about the villain, great for warhammer 40,000 orks. ~peace

1 very useful pieces, that new agent head (i think it's new) could be used for a gordon freeman minifigure, and break jaw's head for otis the security guard when you take his donuts away from him.

1 i always joked that our house would have a moat around it with mechanical alligators. now i can build the house in lego! thanks sirnadroj for the review and pictures. this is definitely my favorite agents set.

1 sirnadroj, on may 21 2008, 08:36 pm, said: agent charge: looks like indy with 'roid rage... sirnadroj, on may 21 2008, 08:36 pm, said: treasure: map! nice map. is it a sticker or printed? steve

1 thanks for the review. i the bike and the bad guy's helmet.

0 why do all of the reviews that we have for agents sets have the agents getting hurt? is this a new trend? plus unibrow man doesn't have a unibrow. his eyebrows are really close together and bushy!

-1 agentrick57, on may 23 2008, 09:17 am, said: why do all of the reviews that we have for agents sets have the agents getting hurt? is this a new trend? no, it's an old trend. and it's because villains are cooler. actually, it could be long-simmering resentment towards the not-highly-regarded alpha team/ dino attack sets bubbling forth. see dr lucky's hilarious post here for an example of what i mean... i'm sure the new agents will learn to fight back soon

1 i've copied another thing because i don't know how i must do a review. and i can't do long reviews! set ref: 7884 name: the buggy: the escape of mr freeze number of minifigs: 2 number of pieces: 76 price: 13,95 front of the box: back of the box: the comic: very close: what's in the box: without: the set: the set with the box: the time: wow, this is a funny set, but it's a little expensive, and a little to small, but i like some pieces like the fire, and the mr freeze gun. and the best of all, here it comes, no stickers! that's one of the greatest things. but i understand why lego has made this set, some people want batman lego, and they are most of the time expensive, and the mr freeze set is also expensive, but this set not. if you want more pics, you msut ask! for exaple for the minifigs, or the mr freeze and the blaster. ask it, and this is my first review and sorry for the great and blurry pics! the final verdict: 7.5/10 figures: 8/10 playability: 6/10 build: 7/10 pieces: 7.5/10

0 thanks for an interesting review, ???theriddler???. the sets cheap and very useful to get two fantastic mfs, a great mr. freeze and a very cool new batman. but i have to say that these two small vehicles just look plain ugly imho, without any inspiration nor orginality.... sorry, tlc, but you can for sure do better than that, and even with less pieces....

1 nice review, thanks! i really like those little go-kart thingies, they've got a fantastic mario kart look to them

0 thanks for the review... ill probably get one copy of this set. mr. freeze and his cart look neat. i dont like the huge wing on the back of batman's buggy so ill probably mod that out.

0 quote but i have to say that these two small vehicles just look plain ugly imho, without any inspiration nor orginality indead. the only reason to get this set is if you couldn't afford the batcave back in 2006 and want a mr. freeze fig for a cheap price. and anyone who did get that kit really have no reason whatsoever to get this. wait, did i forget something? oh yeah - thanks for the review, riddler. edited by grevious, 22 may 2008 - 11:54 pm.

0 as others have said, this really is a set for those that didn't buy the batcave. thus i want it! the cars are pretty horrid though... thanks for the review ???theriddler???!

0 thanks for the review! for such a high price that we need to fork out, compared to a total pieces of 76. it's is very expensive to pay for such poor design. but then, i will still considered to get them. as what sinner had said, this is a very good way to get mr freeze without getting the batcave. and it so happened that, i do not have the batcave too. i believed that is the cheapest set among the four. so, for the mini-figs only, this set is recommended. other than that, i am sorry.

-1 like many others, i'll buy this just for mr f, quickly recycle the parts, and pretend this set never existed. the flame detail is indeed terrible. the bat is back - and he's flatulent! this third bat-wave isn't really doing anything for me. i'll get the penguin set as well for pretty much the same reason - although the sub on that is pretty cool - but skip the others. maybe batbrick can make us all nice alt-mocs to improve these sets... thanks for the review though!

0 wowie!!!!!! i'm glad you like it! maby i'l do the tumbler also! but soon the batcycle and the scuba also come!

1 neat little set. i do like the parts a number of hard to find bits all in one pack, depending on how much it costs in usd i'll have to consider it. and while the buggy designs kinda suck, i'm a little happy to see them, its been years since tlc made any small go kart style vehicles. i guess tiny turbos have been overshadowing that market?

0 thanks for the reveiw the figs are bloody great! but those cars are a bit... well i'll put it blantly, retarded!!! although they shall be good after some modding! and whats with that grapple hook? does it even have a rope, so i guess batman will hokk it to mr freeze so his ride looks more ugle anyway, can you pleese take some pics of the figs

1 that's a great set. it'd be even better if it were sold as two separate little cars. they remind me of the dozens of little lego cart vehicles i got as a kid. those were always fun, quick builds that resulted in lots of cool play. i think this set is aimed more at kids and, in that respect, it's a pure winner. it doesn't hurt that you can get freeze and the newly designed batman both in this set for a reasonable price.

-1 thanks for the review. this set was poorly design, when i first heard of it i think it was like a car with a much better design than this one. i think i will get it for the minifigs.

1 thanks for the extra pics, i don't think you could have gone into much more detail than that! nice pics of the joker van too, will you do a review of that one? batbrick away!

1 in actuality, i think that this may be my favorite batman set of all time. i know, i know - it's a small set with crappy tiny vehicles; so it probably sucks for the fan who likes to display sets; but look at the mocing side and you see this set has a ton of potential: -new batman fig. well, mainly the torso; but it looks nice, sleek, and armored! a definite plus whether you're a mocist or batfan. -mr. freeze. because nobody bought the batcave when they should have...and by nobody i mean me. plus, i love that head! -cheapest way to amass the lightning piece. the other sets that have it are lolhueg (well, not really, but i don't have $50 to toss around on a little skeleton tower...), and it's a great piece. -two little blue gems. i may be alone on this, but those are my favorite parts (the gems), and that's my favorite color for them! <3 <3 <3 -several other useful parts, including a +o piece in black, some light/medium blue bits from mr. freeze's kart, the oddly placed grappling hook, and some cheap wheels. now, i don't know about you guys, but this is as close to a batman battlepack as we're going to get, lol - i'm buying at least three, maybe more once i get my summer job ^.^ (oh, and the fact that the us price is only $10 helps a little, but this year you guys can't complain - you got practically every set first, especially the new castle! t.t) ~trexxen

-1 i got this yesterday and built it this morning. apart from the figs, it is very crappy. mr freeze's buggy is ok but the bat buggy is easily the worst vehicle i've seen for years. colours are all over the place, the grappling hook feels cheaply made, the inclusion of those odd pearl silver parts which have been in the exo-force sets seem especially random here, the terrible bionicle flame piece... it's the first lego vehicle i've built where i've immediately had the urge to disassemble it and pretend i never bought it! really, i only got it for mr freeze so i shouldn't complain. but still. it's a real step backwards. the comparable catwoman dragster set was heaps better. the penguin sub is sweet though thanks for the review anyway!

1 coming in at around $50 us, turbo car chase is one of the bigger of the new agents sets. a big box with a helicopter, car, and gate in it. seems like a winner, but how good is it really, and is it worth the cash? let's start with the minifigs. this set comes with a standard inferno henchman, spy clops, and agent chase. the henchman is you basic lego criminal type with a gun and a jumpsuit, nothing real groundbreaking here. spy clops, on the other hand, is very cool for, technically, half of a minifig. his head has a neat electronic goggle print and the rest of him is a torso mounted onto a set of six legs made from exo-force robot arms. the whole thing is really well done and neat as hell. agent chase (turbo car chase! ) seems to have a standard agent body and a double-printed face with one side a sunglasses and headset print. the other face is a determined agent look. the set also includes a laptop with doctor inferno wallpaper. the laptop is a new piece and works like the lego books that are in a lot of harry potter sets. molding on the keyboard is really well done and the thing can be held by a minifig along either corner, but not in the middle and not while closed. the gate in the set is nothing revolutionary by itself, and i sort of get the feeling that it was included to drive up the piece count and the set price point. that being said, there are some things to like here. for instance, the gate has four wheels of barbed wire attached to it. the barbed wire is new and makes me want to start building some world war i trench mocs. the rest of the gate is fairly big and it has a handy ramp attached so that vehicles can roll through it easily. the main feature of the gate is a sound brick. it's much better then lego sound and light units of the past, when the gate is opened it depresses a button and an alert klaxon blares that sounds every bit like a prison-beak in progress. the triggering action works surprisingly well and it's pretty much for this feature alone that i'm not going to immediately break the gate back down and add it to my parts bin. the designers did make an effort to create more then just a fence though. a nice control panel connected to a big spotlight crowns the piece, and a pair of cameras watch the opening. it's really hard to mess up a lego helicopter, and this set is no exception. the inferno chopper is a nicely proportioned and well built machine. it looks properly menacing and has the uniform orange and black of other inferno property. it's armed with a set of four technic pegs cleverly used as guns on outriding mounts, as well as a pair of the newer-style flick-fire missiles. i personally don't care for flick-firing missiles, but these look decent enough and seem to stay put so i really can't complain about them. along the fuselage are a pair of intake pieces that i've never seen before and i'm guessing are new. they're pretty well designed and will come in handy for mocing down the road. the action feature of the aircraft is the wench system. this is very different then other lego wenches in that you build the entire mechanism and housing. you can then use it to raise spy clops up and down from the bottom of the chopper using the rotor. now, this also keeps you from sitting there and just giving the rotor repeated spins to simulate flight. i'm not too thrilled with that, but there are a hundred other lego helicopters out there with fully rotating rotors, so i guess i can let it by just this once. as you'd suspect, the bottom of the cockpit is completely open, which makes this a vehicle pretty much solely for spy clops (sorry henchman). but there is plenty of room beneath the body to attach a plate with some seats on it to accommodate another pilot without drastically altering the design, or even removing existing pieces. the turbo car is a slick little honey of a lego car, and the silver pieces that make up the body work contribute a lot to that fact. the front license plate appears to be an exo-fore code brick. but it also hides the activation lever for the passenger ejector seat. the seat works about as well as the spruce goose, which is to say not well at all, but here it's the thought that counts. the interior of the car is really well done. there's even a radar screen for keeping track of pesky helicopters. but the bond-like features don't end there. a lever in the compartment raises pair of guns in the hood and a knob on the rear deploys a quad rocket system with more flick-fire missiles. this is a car that won't be stopped easily! the rear has two cones sticking out. i'd like to think they're smoke nozzles or oil-slick sprayers. all-in-all, this is a really good set. the car is pure lego vehicle love and looks fantastic. the silver pieces are very nice and it's a shame lego doesn't use metallic colors in system sets more often. there are, however, a lot of sticker for this set and i know how much that bugs a lot of people. i personally like how much detail the stickers add to these sets and don't mind them so much. the set also comes with an agents id card for chase which you can put little star stickers on from other sets as you get them. it's printed on a real nice piece of sturdy plastiboard and would be cooler if you could put your own picture and name on it instead of pretending to be chase. sold by themselves, the car and chopper would be must-haves. all tossed together with the gate sort of makes the set a little less then the sum of it's parts. and with 498 parts (most of them small) that's not so hot. it's only slightly over-priced in my opinion, but if you do shell out the money you won't regret it. i'm very comfortable recommending this set to anyone. close to perfect, but the price and some minor flaws bring it back just a little. i'd say 4.33, but out of 5 is close enough!

1 chrome..... can't wait for the review, deino!

1 can't wait for the review the car is ly!!!

1 deinonychus, on may 23 2008, 10:12 pm, said: pics and thoughts tomorrow! i picked up this set earlier in the week and was quite pleased with it (in fact i have missions 1-5 and am happy with all of them - this series is much better than the old alpha team ever was). i look forward to reading your thoughts on it. i will say 2 things about it now though. 1)my set came with defective instructions. in 2 places pages are missing and duplicates of other pages repeated. for instance, the car instructions are missing steps 16-21. fortunately, i was able to make out what pieces went where in the missing steps by studying the illustration in step 22. i hope you have better luck with your instructions. 2)this set contains the best lego sound brick ever (it's just begging to be incorporated into my arkham asylum).

0 yay! can't wait for your review. i plan to get this and the giant truck. the brick rat, on may 23 2008, 07:31 pm, said: 2)this set contains the best lego sound brick ever (it's just begging to be incorporated into my arkham asylum). what is a sound brick?

0 mr. mandalorian, on may 24 2008, 11:58 am, said: what is a sound brick? ditto. maybe its like the exo-force light-up brick, only with sound instead of light. that would kick [innapropriate word deleted].

1 wow, thanks for the great review deino this set is really a must have for me. the sound brick seems great, the helicopter looks very nice and the car is superb! all of the james bond features are really cool, though i'm very interested in how the ejector seat works (or doesn't work..). the car itself is very sleek and full of beautiful silver, and the inclusion of the new rims and windshield mean that i won't have to buy many speed racer sets. as for the minifigs, they all look great, especially spyclops. though it looks rather easy for him to fall off of his spider legs. can you confirm this? a great review of a great set, thanks deinonychus

1 thanks for the awesome review, deinonychus! this really is a sweet set, a bit expensive a set for me, as i only get the cheaper non-castle sets, which is a shame because i love that head! it would be great for some more cyborg troops. the car is awesome, i didn't expect it to have that many silver parts, that's fantastic! heaps of play features too, that ejector seat mechanism sounds interesting. thanks again for the sweet review! ~peace

0 deinonychus, on may 23 2008, 09:12 pm, said: the rear has two cones sticking out. i'd like to think they're smoke nozzles or oil-slick sprayers. according to page 14 of my brickmaster magazine, the left cone is for smoke screen and the right cone is for oil slick.

0 es.jpg 47.94k 110 downloads the ejector seat a long technic axle runs the length of the front of the car. it comes in to the seat area here and nests into the gray joint which is attached to the small gray technic beam. the beam is attached to the ejector seat (bottom white 3x2 plate) with a technic pin. the seat, in turn, is attached to the side of the car with a technic pin. the result is, when the axle is pushed forward, the gray joint and beam tilt the seat and "eject" a minifig. after about 20 shots the minifig only went outside of the car 3 times...the rest of the time he just bounced around the inside of the car. so they get an a for effort, but an f for execution

1 thanks deinonychus for another great review. i must say i do look forward to people uploading reviews of new sets, it really helps me decide if i want it or not. if it's a good set (imo) then it adds to the excitement of picking up one myself! this, i must say, is one of those sets! the only concern for me, like alot of others, is the price. i will just have to wait and see and continue to look at these photo's deinonychus has provided for us!! so much for thinking the agent line was going to be weak! i wonder if the exoforce style code brick number plate is a hint from tlc as to what will replace exoforce at the end of this year? jb

1 thanks for the great review! i'm really liking these agents sets the more i see them. the car seems to have alot of features. its to bad the the ejection seat doesn't work as well as one would hope. oh well. makes me want the big rig even more now!

1 thanks for your great review! it looks very nice indeed! the gate have very interesting mechanism. the car looks very slick and cool. it looks like those typical kind of james bond car. this review gives me very good insights.

1 great review deinonychus i really like it! can someone record the sound os the sound brick(maybe on youtube?) i really want to hear it. this sets are really cool deino can you post a picture of the agent card it comes with?

0 dragonator, on may 25 2008, 08:21 pm, said: thanks for the review whitefang. i love these sets, and i wish they were available in nz. so far, it seems they may never come here... but i can sit and hope. i like the look of them after your make-over, a real skeleton army there! did you say you've bought 12! tht's lots of skelies. are you planning a big moc or something? no problem! i had bought it last month. i thought it was so simple to do a review for this. was looking through the thread, then i realised there is a request for it. it was an unexpected shipment that send to singapore. it came in very limited quantity. most of the battlepacks were snapped within a day or two when it arrived. well, i am thinking of building something big in the future. it's just a plan that i have not decided yet. for me, i always love to see the beauty of a big army with different battalions, forming a kingdom. that's why, i always buy many many sets that have figures that attracts me. and for this battlepack, it served a very good purpose for it!

1 thanks for the review!!! it wasn't "really" a request but more of an imply to do it anyway great review! can't wait til these come to aus. probably when the rest of the castle comes out in september though

1 thanks for the review i wanted to see what was in this set looks good! is it sold in stores? edited by mammymarf, 25 may 2008 - 03:38 pm.

1 thanks whitefang! i love this battlepack, but can only really hope to get one. still, great accesories and a spider! that's great! batbrick away!

0 sdpirate, on may 26 2008, 10:40 am, said: no offence- make this 7.99 can. too expensive to be coming with only a few figures. 20$ earns you the same amount of figs, plus a catapult, barricade, two horses and a jousting divider. are you refering to these following sets? both these sets adds up to $18.00 (cad) and the skeleton pack have the same price of $18.00 (cad) *prices quoted from s@h i understand that 7009 and 7090 offers more pieces, horses and same amount of mini-figs compared to a typical battlepack. imo, i feel that all 3 sets are all army building sets. 7009 offer small catapult, 3 mini-figs, a skeleton white horse. 7090 offer a joust divider, weapon rack (good accessories), 2 mini-figs, a horse with barding and a skeleton black horse. these sets have different purpose. for me, buying multiples of 7009 is to build its catapult, white skeleton calvaries. while 7090 is to build on crown calvaries and black skeleton calvaries. however, battlepacks have a different agenda. it offered some castle accessories that is not available commonly. for a castle army builder like myself, castle accessories are always in demand. the black robe, silver armor, silver short-axe are not very common castle accessories. it can be used as a good stock up too. i am not saying this battlepack is an one way solution to solve everything. that's why, different sets are released to target on different purposes.

0 whitefang, although i realize that the battle packs are great specifically for building armies, and castle accessories (which is why its such a shame that i won't be able to buy these things ), while sdpirate's sets are more for a catapult, calvary whatever. the fact to the matter is with the battle pack you get: 5 minifigs with lots of accessories. while with the sets that sdpirate showed us you get: 5 minifigs with an okay amount of accessories 3 horses (including two skeleton ones) a ballista a weapons rack, and a jousting barricade. you cannot say that the battle pack contains the same amount of stuff that the other two sets have and therefore should be priced the same. it just seems that lego is ripping off canadian army builders, to me if the battle pack contained a small catapult, or wall so that it contained about the same amount of stuff that the other sets had it would be fair. it seems stupid that you will only get minifigs from one set, while you can get about the same amount of minifigs plus a bunch of other stuff from two other equally priced sets. thats why to me these battle packs are a rip off, because of what they contain, imho the battle packs seem to be only worth about 10 dollars.

0 thanks for sharing these close-up images of this battlepack whitefang. i actually had this set in my hand at legoland cal. and could not decide if i wanted it. i'm currently out of "castle-mode" with my large indy jungle set up on the table, and creating ghost train mocs that are starting to line up on the bookshelves. once i buy the troll ship, i'll want to start collecting these great fig sets. thanks again for sharing.

0 thanks for the nice review whitefang! i got the knights bp just for the scared face.

0 sorry to be going a little off topic here but personally i have just bought 40 crowny battle packs for the only reason that i am running out of space to store the left over blocks. about 500 of my crownies came from sets (mentioned above) on sale which would have been cheaper than the battle packs. thanks for the review whitefang but i dont think i will be buy any skeleton battle packs, that army is large enough.

0 for those of you who buy so many of this and the other battle pack with crownies, what do you do with all of them? is this simply to create a large-scale army, or do you plan to build large castle scenes with all the figs. i'd love to see some pictures (on the "share your castle army" thread).

1 i've always wanted to see this set close-up voltio. thanks for sharing the image review. this is the only jungle adventurers set i don't have and it's got some great unique pieces (esp. those leaf brick pieces). what's great is they're not stickers. this is a really a nice review of a neat set; with the extra little humor you shared. thanks again for taking the time to photograph and share over eb.

1 i'm gonna start searching ebay!

1 i've always wanted this set, ever since it came out in '99. i have never seen it close up (unless you count driving over it in lego racers 2), so thanks for the pictures and the great review. voltio, on may 26 2008, 04:43 am, said: el conde: "you are too beautiful a woman to be wandering alone in the jungle, miss storm. please, allow me to accompany you." gail storm: "i'm with johnny, and i have a cutlass." el conde: "i'll be on my way." hehe.

1 a real classic, thanks for that nice and funny review, voltio! a well designed set, very playable with a lot of nifty traps, a very good use of that raised baseplate and really nice crafts. the mf charactersre excellent too! and although the color schemes great and original, especially with all these neat printed pieces, its perhaps the only part of that set that looks a little out of date today.... nevertheless, the sets plain charming and shows clearly that tlc dont need licenses to do some distinct adventurer sets.

1 great review! i just barly missed the jungle series, growing up with half a year of jungle and mainly orient expedition and dino island. i like egypt more, but this set (despite the 4x4 palm tree) is practically perfect. i love the detail and vibrant colours. gotta say, i've got a thing for pippin reed myself. by the way, what does "vhtf" mean? edited by sdpirate, 28 may 2008 - 01:06 am.

1 vhtf= very hard to find. to answer some earlier replies... no, there are no stickers in this set. while some adventurers sets of the era had stickers (the 5956 zeppelin had tons), all of the interesting mesoamerican designs from this set are printed. also, simonwillems was correct; my mechanic is missing his hat, which should be a black kepi. they're extremely expensive on bl, though (proving once again that this set has some awesome parts), so i ordered a replacement from lego. it's in the mail and should come soon.

-1 athos, on may 28 2008, 07:47 pm, said: the printed pieces are the real gems of this set. beyond them, there isn't much to this set, though the boat hull is nice. the model itself, isn't all that great. the new akator temple is definately a superior model (at least in piece count), but those printed pieces are hard to resist. steve i have to agree. too few pieces for such a high price- but amazing figs too, and a nice baseplate! despite a 4+ palm tree, you get more palm tree leaves for moc's. plus, i think a monkey? and that sweet achu figure.

1 i absolutly love this set. this is in my opinion the best adventurers set. it has it all; the falling bridge, the falling skeleton, the spear trap, and the classic trapdoor. it is a must-have set. thanks for providing such a nice review.

1 this set is awesome .......... gr8

1 i just rebuilt this entire set today, and the nostalgia was totally worth taking bits and pieces from a few of my own mocs. only now did i realize how rare some of those pieces are, and i'm rather thankful that i have all of the printed pieces, and achu. the only pieces i am missing is a transparent orange headlight (3 out of 4), black minifigure hammer, light gray chain(replaced it with a dark gray chain), and one whole minifigure, which is the mechanic guy. i still have both the instructions and the box, and both are in appalling conditions. kudos to the pre-2000s lego sets like this one! love 'em

1 wow, good review! i used to love this old sets, as i was greatly fascinated by inca and aztec cultures, and the mayans technological marvels astounded me. i was thrilled to death when lego released little aztec figures, so of course i jsut had to buy some your narration with the sig fig was hilarious, and the review was all around wonderful, keep up the good work mate!

1 thanks for the awesome review voltio. el conde is the man!

1 great review voltio, i never actually owned this set but my friend does, he gave me some of the peices, but he burnt the base (don't know why)

1 i got this as a birthday gift when i turned 7 years old or so. i can still remember the big box with the brown bridge in its display! so many hours of fun. one of the most amazing sets i own. a lot of play value. a true classic!

1 i had one of these! it was awesome, it went well with the zeppelin. i can't remember if the box was one of those fold up the lid ones though. can't tell from the picture. anyone want to jog my memory, i always thought the sets with the flap lids were the best, i kept those! edited by giantdinosaur, 26 september 2011 - 08:38 pm.

0 the images are obsolete, please fix it.

1 welcome to cardinal brick's review of 7736 it's a small set but as i bought it the other day i felt that it probably did merit a short review. the box is ofcourse far larger than necessary! there's plenty of air inside. the contence is one bag and the instruction booklet, you could proably build it inside the bag if the desire took you. we have one new coastguard with the slightly stubly head found in the castle range and a trans-clear visor. the build was challanging and arduious the final product is quite nice at one ?3.00 it's a good set only 50p more than an impulse set and with enough extra parts to justify the increase in the price. a good set for a little gift or so on, the buggy moves well. there's not that much to say really for i can't really think of additional models to build with the parts but then what do you expect for the price. edited by cardinal brick, 26 may 2008 - 06:47 pm.

1 thank you very much for the review, cardinal brick! that's indeed a very nice little set! klaus-dieter

1 i recommend this lil set, it's a nice small set, and the vehicle does roll well. i'm sure many young builders would love it

0 i might buy a second one of that set, and build it in the bag. i just wanna prove that it is possible.

1 wow. i was skeptical of this coast guard line. though getting to see some detailed pictures of this set i really want to get get it. alas, i have not the money to get it and it isn't available in my town. oh well. maybe i can catch it on a sale at some point. good review!

1 great review 5150 lego! the new camera was well worth it. youve got everything well done. im looking forward to your next review. meschepers, on may 27 2008, 06:22 am, said: wow. i was skeptical of this coast guard line. though getting to see some detailed pictures of this set i really want to get get it. same here. maybe in two days i can see it in real.

1 nice review. a must have for my city collection.

1 great review! this does look like an excellent set; great chopper!

0 thank you very much for the nice review, 5150 lego! the helicopter is - apart from that it is very, very big and that it does not include any interior - a very nice set . the most i like the life raft becuase it is simply . nevertheless i don't know if i buy it (probably not) - but it's very nice! two questions : -where can you fasten the stretcher on to haul it up and down? -is the motor working with batteries? klaus-dieter edited by klaus-dieter, 28 may 2008 - 09:19 pm.

1 very nice job on the review 5150!! i definitly like this set much better now that i have seen good pics of it. i am definitly picking this up as soon as i can. again, great review . model on!!

1 great review! i will get this, but i will wait for a sale. edited by ~vbbn~, 28 may 2008 - 10:54 pm.

1 thank you for that fine review of a really excellent set, 5150 lego. i never saw a little 'juniorization' done that good before!

(as long as you don't have anything to heavy) one detail i forgot to meation is the shark. its nothing new, just the basic shark lego has had around for nealy 2 decades, but it was a detail nothing less.

1 nice review! the helicopter reminds a sikorsky chopper,isn't it?

-1 i could tell from the pictures that a lot (maybe all) the designs on the raft were stickers. in the whole set are there any printed parts besides the torsos or is it all stickers?

-1 all stickers i'm afraid. though i'mnot a fan of stickers myself. some sets (like ferrari for example) take longer to put on than building the actual set. this one is not as sticker heavy as it seams though, and the ones that areon there really give the set that extra touch. printed would have been preffered of course, but in this case i didn't mind it.

1 this is a very good review, thank you! but i have some questions about the grey new parts in the life raft. are they 1x1 like their counterparts with the clips or 1x2? and can they be held by a minifig by the handle? if so, these could be very useful for brick-build weapons & tools! also, i'm looking forward to some orange eta 2 jedi interceptor mocs now! who wants to be the first to make one? btw, which jedi has an orange eta 2?

-1 i noticed that you said the torsos are the same as the last line; the last line had orange torsos, this one has yellow torsos. -chuck

1 thanks for the review! this set looks great and i really wish i had the money to buy the entire line. but unfortunately, i don't. i love the way tlc used the wing parts to the jedi interceptor for the life raft - very well thought of. anyhow, great review!

1 i will certainly add this one to my collection, i already own every other rescue helicopter and i have a feeling this will be the best. just love how its completely enclosed, thanks for the review.

1 thanks for the nice review, ???theriddler???. a neat and funny ice cream truck and a pretty detailed yet perhaps a little big tumbler. an overall cool set for sure!

0 thanks for the review riddler. your pics are a bit blurry though, if you want them a bit better you should sit your camera on a hard surface so you don't wobble it as much i love the tumbler, though it is quite massive, but either way i'll be glad to get it. the figs in my opinion are really bad, joker should atleast have a different suit. oh well, it's worth it for that awesome van, and instance where the stickers are totally worth it. thanks again! batbrick away!

1 great looking set, loved the review, pictures were good... sometimes blury but i think i will pick this up after i get the rest of the kotcs sets. riddler a tip i learned in photoclass is to take a breath in and hold it while pushing the shutter so you don't accidentally move while breathing. i thought it was silly, but it does work. again great review! looking forward to more...

0 uncle joker's cheap technic missile surprise great review, however, there isn't much appeal to the set after you see what the "surprise" is, though i can modify the truck to have an evil gas-ice cream making interior

-1 the stickers ruin the tumbler but the truck is very good if it was cheaper id get it

0 i am gonna have to pick this up, what a grand representation of the tumbler and it would be my first joker minifigure. my lego bat-life is looking up! )tnr(

0 looks like a nice set, thanks for the review! i can't get over how enormous the tumbler is, they should have made it smaller (the price too )i fthey did that and threw in a dark knight joker and henchman i would totally buy it. enjoy your new set! darthperson

1 i have been thinking about buying this set just for the tumbler, and now i am sold one more set for the shelf. great review!

1 nice review m8. shame that most of the pictures are blurry but nonetheless. just wanted to say that out of all my lego sets, this one, 7888 is the best. the tumbler is so cool once it is put together! those four huge wheels at the back make it quite unique! if you do not have this set i highly recomend it. edited by 4olic, 30 august 2009 - 02:59 pm.

1 thank you for clearing that up i felt that it was ok to review an old topic, as stated, rather than just go ahead and start a new one. a shame that this set, as all other batman sets, have gone up so highly in value but still all things considering (general after market lego price hikes) it is still a wonderfull set even with its market value today (that is if you can ignore the mrsp).

0 great find and thanks for the review. inertia, on may 28 2008, 11:08 pm, said: undoubtably better than it's newer counterpart the mt-101 armored drilling unit.... care to explain why? personally i think that aside from the colour scheme the new one is far better. why? suspension, more enclosed cockpits, bug-like appearence.... i suppose it's a matter of personal opinion though.

1 great review of a great set. i always figured the hoses were welding torches (attached to jetpacks, yeah!) as the whole thing had the vibe of a mobile repair center. much like many of my favorite sets, this one has a base of simple bricks and plates and then from that solid foundation the rest is built out to be decorative or have the action features. this gives sets a very solid feel as demonstrated in this set, the first snowspeeder, and galaxy explorer. the mm armored drilling unit has a more technic base giving it a less solid appearance and though i like the set, that jet that luanches from the back is horrible, partially because of the useless orange containment things. the mega core has a nifty crane instead of a big useless jet. -tohst

1 sinner, on may 28 2008, 02:35 pm, said: care to explain why? the mcm has a pure weight of parts that i find hard to quantify but love... it is just so dense when you build it, full of nice surprises, no technique required, and a wonderful stearing mechanism that i rank as more important than the suspension of the mars version. this thing was meant to crush anyway, who needs suspension? i also like the way you never felt that the m-trons deserved a base after building this, it was that good... the colour scheme was perfect... it's space and i like it... enough said great review btw god bless, nathan naturally you're entitled to your inferior opinion...

1 thanks for those wonderful pictures and congrats! i think buying this on ebay was a good decision! i have no m:tron sets at all, but i like the mcm very much. it's just a wonderfully big set with many nice detials. lots of playing possibilities! i wish i had it too.

0 fluyt, on may 28 2008, 01:56 pm, said: since when is that? the new train couplings have magnets, only with a special casing. you're right, i should have clarified -- it's the old loose magnets that apparently are being discontinued, not all magnets altogether. as you noted, the new train couplings still have magnets, but they appear to be permanently attached to a fairly large housing, which i guess will prevent kids from eating them. but the old m:tron round magnet pieces are presumably discontinued.

0 zero1312, on may 29 2008, 08:22 am, said: thanks for the review, maybe i can pick one off ebay. yeah, i got this for only like 19 pounds, pretty cheap. it's a great set! cp5670, on may 29 2008, 08:55 am, said: it looks like you're right about the old magnets. i got a few off pab two months ago but they no longer have them. i guess i should grab some while they're still widely available on bricklink, as they can be useful in a number of situations. on a side note, one interesting thing about this set is that it seemingly had two us/canada names, mega core magnetizer and multi core magnetizer. brickset, lugnet and all the other sites i've seen call it mega, but i have some north american catalogs from that time period that call it multi and the box also says multi on it. i actually didn't know the mega name at all until many years after the m:tron line. hmm... i've never seen it listed as multi, but now i guess it has three names, strange that m:tron is basically the only space theme that had different names depending on region... clonecommando007, on may 29 2008, 10:11 am, said: this does look alot better than the new mm drilling tank. great work! yeah, i should take a comparison, yet the boxart on the mt-101 was pretty cool. sinner, on may 29 2008, 12:29 pm, said: thanks for an answer. i'll shut up now so we can focus on your review... it's okay, i have a question kind of not related to the review.. is there still a space review/moc index now that docking bay has closed? thanks again!

0 asuka, on may 30 2008, 02:17 am, said: of course i dont want to offend some technic lovers, and although i always was more the system kind of guy, why cant they just use some technic beams with studs at least? that's because of cost. the older beams needed a four sided mold, and the newer ones need only a two. lego do seem to be using both types more as of late though. asuka, on may 30 2008, 02:17 am, said: i grew up with 'just imagine', with pictures of alternative models on the box, and i dont think its that easy, especially for younger kids, to mod some of these terrific blown-up sets like it once was with sets like this one here.... implosion off! i've never heard an official word (...perhaps i should raise a topic...) but i think that they don't show them any more because it became a support nightmare. what do i mean? i bet tlg was tired of letters and calls saying "timmy can't make this model shown on the box. can you send instructions and the extra parts..." i know that for some recent models they were designed but not published. how do i know this? the creator said so!

0 sinner, on may 30 2008, 01:38 am, said: that's because of cost. (...) i've never heard an official word (...perhaps i should raise a topic...) but i think that they don't show them any more because it became a support nightmare. what do i mean? i bet tlg was tired of letters and calls saying "timmy can't make this model shown on the box. can you send instructions and the extra parts..." of course its a money issue.... my question was more rhetorical. but i still dont like how they sacrifice inherent set design on the altar of cost saving efforts. to be even more correct, i dont understand why they try to make extraordinary cool looking sets with a pretty weak 'inner life'. yeah, they want to sell sets with something that looks exciting on the box art, but.... lego was (and fortunately, is, with many recent sets too) always more than just an impressive spaceship or s.f. tank vehicle.... its the sum of the set itself and its parts and what you can do with it that makes out the full fun of it. the best thing you can do with a new set, beside some ucs sets perhaps, is to mod the set according to your own likings. this is where 'just imagine' begins, and how kids start to learn how to moc, at least it was like that to me.... individualizing official sets, and looking on some cool alternative models gave me my first ideas and helped my imagination and skills to grow, back in these days when i was a wee child. books, movies and t.v. series as a source of inspiration just came a little later.... i can see many people complaining about how to make the alternative models, yes, but just stop using them on the box arts a very poor solution and a dangerous one too, at least in long terms. of course i know that you know all these things too, sinner. i just think its a shame, and a risk too, because tlcs perhaps sacrificing more than they might know by yet.... building with bricks is the main attraction of lego, not just some cool crafts to play around with.... others can do this too and maybe better than tlc. if the kids of today ever forget about the fascination of being imaginative, tlcll only lose in the end.

1 this super set contains many of the city sets you can get for your mini city hospital. the smallest set is the 7902 car with a doctor. i thought it looked a bit too slow. here is a car you can build with the same bricks. the instruction manual for the ambulance does contain a picture of an alternate model, but it is actually quite hard to build something significantly different. this sets lacks some snot-bricks, so i had to be a little more creative and came up with this ambulance. it is more a hearse than an ambulance. the helicopter has a lot of slopes, so i built a speed boat for those special emergencies. unlike the first two sets, i used far from all the bricks in this. this set does really have some great parts. the brickshelf gallery with some more pictures. is anyone up to the challenge and build some alternate models of the last set in the super pack - the hospital?

1 a great and very creative work, i especially like the speed boat and the smaller car, just splendid!

0 thank you very much asuka, but i get the hint. last.

1 these are great! i especially love the speed boat and your ambulance reminds me of ecto -1! (i would take you up on your challenge but i don't own the hospital. it seemed overpriced to me...)

1 harley & mistah j. i want to preface my review by admitting that im an unrepentant harley quinn fanboy. ive been enamored with the character since she first appeared in batman: the animated series back in the 90s, and ive since followed her misadventures through her introduction into the regular batman series during no mans land, into her own series, and even on the short-lived and not-so-good birds of prey tv show. so please excuse any pro-harley bias. so, down to business. the 267 piece set retails for $30 us ($35 at toys r us) and builds up very fast and easy. it consists of batmans bat cycle, harleys hammer truck, and brand new batman and harley quinn minifigs. there is also no lack of weapons. in addition to the usual bag of bat-accessories and guns, the set also comes with a pair of gray revolvers. batman in this set has the new armor torso print and the hips are the same color as the legs, hinting that this is supposed to represent the movie style batsuits more so then the traditional comic book underwear over tights look. harley quinn is a very cool looking minifig, and i havent grinned so much at a new batman character figure since my first batman minifig a couple years ago. the figure is very true to the character, and the torso has been accented with a few shape lines to try and distinguish her as a female despite the boxy body. harleys jester cap is an interesting new piece. it seems (to me at least) to be made of a slightly different grade of plastic then were used to. its molded in red and painted with black and white, and it comes packed in its own separate little baggie. i expect that this piece may have cost lego a little more then usual to produce. harley also has a buildable accessory, a giant mallet. sure, she cant stand up all that well unless its held in specific ways, but its neat and most importantly, its funny. its especially fun for smacking the everloving crap out of other minifigs with. the bat cycle is in bag number one and is a very fast build. this isnt some little japanese sport bike like nightwings cycle. this monster is almost a car and seems to pack just the right amount of intimidation for the caped crusader to exploit. thanks to the thick tires (two in front, one in back) it stands up just fine on its own and rolls very well. the huge exhaust pipes are a nice touch and give the thing a look of engine power. the only real flaw is the inclusion of the flick-fire missiles mounted on the sides. but, as with any lego model, they can be easily left out without hurting the look of the vehicle. the hammer truck is the bulk of this set and a lot more fun then it looks. of the monster truck persuasion, the vehicle is designed and built with a surprising level of solidity. the axle mounts are particularly impressive. the big wheels and tires just beg you to drive this thing right over the bat cycle (or batman). the mega-mallet gimmick is also a surprise. not so much for its technical complexity, there isnt any really, but for the fact that once you start turning the knob at the rear to swing the mallet back and forth, its really a lot of fun. there are some low points to the truck design. again the flick-fire missiles are tacked on and theres a cargo crate/bed set into the back for harleys loot of jewels. the crate would have looked a lot better molded in black. in brown it breaks up the look of the truck a little. speaking of which, the look of the truck is very pleasing. the red and black harley quinn color scheme works really well on the vehicle. there are a few stickers here, and unfortunately, the diamond patterned ones are applied over multiple bricks. the rest, however, are great. not only does she have an i love joker bumper sticker, but she has a joker playing card taped to her dash, i guess serving as a picture of her beloved puddin. there is also a sticker for activation of the hammer, which boldly shouts hit me! this is a fun set. a neat new batman vehicle and a big truck with lots of playability. the harley minifig is a must-have for any bat-fan and, if you only get one of the batman sets this year, id recommend this one. the price versus piece-count on this set is a little bit of a deterrent though. this might not be the best set for collectors on a budget or people looking for something completely new and innovative, but anyone buying this for a child can rest assured that the kid will get your moneys worth out of the set through its play value. when added together and averaged out, the pros and cons of this set combine to give it a score of out of 5. even if harley herself is a clean 6 out of 5

0 darn you! making us wait like this. meanie.

0 why!?

0 what a showman!, guess you have to get in before someone else does the review! looking forward to the review....

0 looking forward to the review, this looks to be the best of the new batsets. funnily enough, it took me a while to realise ms quinn whacking deino was not on the boxart batbrick away!

0 darn i was going to review this set. i gues my review will be second.

0 i look forward to seeing the review. novelty sized hammer on!

0 thanks deino! btw, i told my psychiatrist to send you the bill....

0 monday my review, i hope you like that one also! but i can't wait for your review. who want's the second riddle?

-1 quote looking forward to the review, this looks to be the best of the new batsets. *gasp* are you kidding me? honestly, i hate this set. the batbike looks far too blocky, and that hammer truck looks super shoddy and thrown together. the only real reason i'd get it at all would be for the harely quinn figure - but i'd probably just get her separately on bricklink. besides, the tumbler and robin's jetski sets look far better to me. they actually seem to have great vehicle designs. no new villian figures, i know, but still some great old ones. er, wait a minute... oh yeah, hope your review gives the real scoop on this kit, deino.

0 thanks all, i hope my hq wil arive today, and deinonychus i don't wanna do stupid to you but must i do also a review of the hq set, i want to do that also a review of hq without the blurry pics. who want's the second riddle?

1 harley, the fig, is amazing. love that hat. batcycle, meh...ok. truck: flick fire missiles!!?!?? lego have you no sanity! sure they're great but you're putting them on every single action set!! hammer thingy; win. nice truck! great review!

-1 so, down to business. the 267 piece set retails for $30 us what? but it's 30 in the uk! why, lego, why?

0 thanks for that great and creative review! ) could you, plese make a picture of hq's back? ) goiod day, gentlemen! )

1 this set looks really fun! the figs are sweet, can't wait to see that jester in the flesh. of course, the jester i'm talking about is the castle one but that doesn't mean harley isn't a sweet fig! thanks for that awesome review, deinonychus! ~peace

1 thanks for the review deinonychus! this is an awesome set, it may just be my first batman set

1 hi all, so i was at "the wal-mart" yesterday and had the munchies and was looking for something to eat. somewhere along the line, i stopped caring about food and decided to browse the toy department to see what they had lego-wise. usually, they have jack squat, but on this particular day they had a lot of new sets. i impulsively picked this set up, along with harley quinn's hammer truck and the new little campsite from the indy 4 line. i must say, when i first saw images of this set i wasn't exactly thrilled or anything. i mean, i didn't really see anything particularly special about it, but after purchasing it, i must admit that i would consider it a must buy for any lego fan. but enough babbling about myself. onward with the review (my first of an official set)! in this picture, you can see everything you get with the set. i thought the box-art was pretty nice looking. the manual, on the other hand, took somewhat of a beating within the box, a common problem with most more recent sets. i do have to say that i wish they would at least make some effort in fixing this. they could just make a little thin cardboard "folder" to minimize bending and tears. for batman minifig collector's, the highlight of this set are the robin and penguin figs. previously, you could only get them in the pricey bat-cave set, but this set provides a much cheaper alternative. one thing you will notice, however, is that robin's hairpiece is a new mold, as it is actually a black version of mutt's hair (from the indy 4 line). personally, i think it actually looks better than the hairpiece used on the older version of robin. as the batcave had before it, this set comes with some bricks to make two cute (but deadly) penguins. they help add more charm to an already charming set. when you're finished building, you'll end up with a nice little assortment of extra parts; 1 black "cheese slope," 3 1x1 tile (black, yellow and white), a revolver, a technic pin, and a 1x1 red round plate. here's robin's scuba jet. it's nice and sleek looking. notable parts of interest would probably be the green turbine engines. my only complaint on this one would have to be the use of decals on the 2x2 round yellow tiles. for that type of a part, printing seems as though it would have been the best way to go. now for, in my opinion, the best part of the set...the penguin's sub. this set has more decals than robin's scuba jet, but they seem more necessary in this case. i actually wanted to put the decal's on the sub, as i think the it looks great with them. obviously, it looks like a penguin, but wow, does it ever do it with style! it has a lot of interactive features, the first of which i will mention, being the periscope which raises up and down. and for the collectors of parts in new colors, it has a few parts in medium orange?, such as 2x2 tile. here's a shot of the bottom of the sub. another nifty little feature is how you can lift the top off and fit the penguin inside. and there is enough room inside, so that you can firmly place top on again, and without interference to the movement of the periscope. another little feature is the rear spring-loaded missile. you just tilt the small lever toward the front of the sub, and it fires. and the last small feature are the flick-missiles on each side. overall, this is a great set with a lot to offer for a decent price. a lot of fans might view the only drawback to it as being the use of decals, but if you plan on keeping the kit together they make it look really fantastic. buy it if you can. matt edited by imperialshadows, 01 june 2008 - 11:42 am.

-1 great review! though you really seem to like this set, and it probably is a great one, i'm not a fan of the penguin sub, or at least i'm not from what i see.

1 thanks a lot! ) i've already ordered it but now i'll be waiting for it even more! ) thanks! )

1 thanks for the review! i love this set, i didn't think it was much at first either, but i really love it. another cheaper robin and penguin is great, and those nifty mini penguins are awesome. the spare pieces are even nice! i love robin's little scuba jet, those green engines are very nice and i love it compactness. penguin's sub is even better, at first i was annoyed at getting two subs but now i realise it means i can have a fleet of them i'll be sure to mod over those cannons though, but the details are very slick. thanks again. batbrick away!

1 thanks for the great review, brickadier general! the sub looks very nice, and i like the idea of a raising periscope (did the batcave sub have that feature?) and the details on the sub look very nice. the inclusion of the penguin, robin and two of those great brick-built penguins really confirms that i'll be getting this, considering that i didn't purchase the batcave. however, i am rather dissapointed that this set is so similar to the vehicles of penguin and robinin repectively in the batcave set. i feel that it only really caters to those who havn't bought the set, and i would've much appreciated different vehicles. overall, a very nice set, perhaps the best of the 2008 wave, despite it's lack of originality. thank you very much for the review bg

1 i was never considering getting this set as i don't really like batman, but if i found this set and had some money with me, i would buy it! ii would use it for indiana jones or something, and the revolevers and top hats! the only problem i see with the box-art is that the penguin is drowning!

-1 looks like a cool set, but the hairpiece for robin is vary disapointing, i would be so glad is they used the regular hair you see all the time. i hope lego will not make a habit of using that hairpiece on other figures.

1 i see you've also learnt to call dibs. looking forward to seeing your review!! edit: oh, i see! i just arrived early. a truely fantastic review, you make me not want to pass this set up, even though i can't possibly afford it without leaving my beloved castle collecting. it really looks like a fun set, so many neat vehicles, and two laptops, i can't wait to see what other sets we'll see them in. thanks again, great job! ~peace edited by iamded, 31 may 2008 - 09:56 am.

1 man i was hoping to be the first to review, ordered from tru 2 days ago. oh well this set looks sweet, can't wait for your review.

1 man, tohse mini vehicles and minifigs are sexy as all heck! i love dr.inferno and the female pattern for agent trace (is it just me or she almost "busting out"? ). i love the dr. inferno hair, and the reappearance of spy-clops and gold tooth is simply gold (yes yes, pun intended!) i have to say this is shaping up to be one of my favourite sets, well, ever! batbrick away!

0 can't wait for the kick @$$ trailer review :d

1 me want this set

1 must. get. two thanks so much, this review has truly shown this set as a brilliant one. even those who hate this theme must admit it is greatly designed. i love the way the mini vehicles fit. i love the light brick. i love the truck front. i love the trailer. i love the missions bay. i love holding cell. i love everything! edit: and i second dragonator's response when i say thankyou svelte-corps for this grand review, you have convinced me utterly to get this! batbrick away! edited by batbrick, 31 may 2008 - 10:49 am.

1 that's an awesome review. and a great set, it seems. with all of this year's star wars (i still haven't got rogue shadow) i can't afford agents too, which is a shame looking at this.

1 wow! great review of what seems to be a great set. i love that ponytail. this looks to be a must have set! (it probably won't stay together for long though...) thanks very much. (i fixed the header for you; that's two you owe me. the other is for making me think that this set was in australia... )

1 svelte_corps, a fanastic review of this biggest agents' set. at first, i was not very keen to have this set. however, after reading your review, you have make me swing up and down. its simply fabulous! thanks for your hard work. i am sure it's not easy to do this review. i love that female mini-fig. she looks awfully sweet especially with her new hair. great job!

1 omg! thank you, thank you, thank you! you made my day! so that means dr. inferno's hair isnt rubber! but one question, is it like that weird funny soft plastic like the ants from indy 4? please answer

1 thanks for another wonderful review, svelte_corps a very fine set indeed, i absolutely love the way all of the vehicles fit into the command centre, very clever. the projector is really cool, it looks very nice. it's great to see these light and sound bricks in the agents sets. all of the little nooks and crannies in the centre are great too, i really love the amount of detail featured, mixed with all of the playability of this set. the minifigs - as usual - are brilliant, the uniforms look fantastic. dr inferno looks especially great, i love his white suit with hints of orange, and who can forget his hair? i'm really tempted to buy this beast now, though i'm not sure my wallet will forgive me for it. i suppose i'll have to cut back on indy and castle multiples for now... thanks for the truly great review, svelte_corps, nice work

1 wow this set looks so amazing! amazing! genius! da'vinci art i say! you've done an excellent job reviewing, and really, this is the review i've been waiting for. so cool! so classy! i love the mission briefing feature. to think that lego could go so high as to put something ingenious like that in there! too bad lego figures don't have fingers to make shadow shows, eh? genius! the jet lauching feature is pretty slick, and they even put a control center in there too! that's beast. loving that. the bottom...i don't see how that big buggy can get out or in there, but, awesome too! the back of the truck could use more detailing i think, but the jail pop-open feature is pretty cool, as is the speed boat storage rack. cabin; it's great! that roof opening feature is a great part of this set. also i think you can have multiple figures up there...maybe you can mod it to put a bed in there! it certainly looks big enough! inferno plane, wow that think is smooth, baby! i love how the wings contain rotors inside of them!!! that's awesome detail right there. that is a sweet ship thingy, so slick. the rest of the command center is pretty awesome too; we get a 4x4 wheeler and a crane, and lots of room! wow! just wow! great review, great set! you are well worthy of your custom title! i'm gonna go buy this for only $90!!!! woot!

1 woah, i got to have this set! i shall buy it asap! thanks for the review! expertly done.

1 wonderful review - one of the best i've ever seen on this site. man, we thought this might be the weakest set in the line, but it turns out it may be the strongest! everything about this set - from the color scheme to all the details to the minifigures to the piece selection - is just wonderful! i think this set has finally confirmed it: agents is everything alpha team wasn't, and is how they should have done a spy theme from the start. kudos to tlc for finally getting it right - and i sure hope there's a second year!

1 excellent review by an excellent reviewer on and excellent set. this theme really does seem to be one of tlc's best. edited by plural, 31 may 2008 - 03:24 pm.

1 i first i thought the whole agents line would not be very good. but boy have i changed my mind! this set looks amazing, as do all of the other sets in the line. i really like how the small vehicles all fit into the truck. i don't like it when sets come with smaller vehicles and don't have anywhere to store them, so they just float on the side. that light projector is fantastic! i can't believe they are actually printed! this is definitly on my to-buy list! thanks for the amazing review!

1 7645 - mt-61 crystal reaper piece count: 600 price: $aud79.95, 49.95 euros (in most countries), 39.99 gbp, usd 49.99 it's happened in the wider world, and it had to happen to lego - yes, the 80s are back. space invaders, holograms, compulsory seat-belt wearing legislation, and the return of classic space. ok, we don't have a fully fledged classic space theme back yet, but if 7645 is the way of the future, i think lego is ready to do it properly. i wasn't a huge fan of last year's mars mission sets and only picked up a few on clearance, but this set is light years (excuse the pun) ahead of 2007's offerings. this mining vehicle is solid, compact, and well-designed. it looks impressive, and even better, it has fantastic power functions operability! behold 7645 - mt-61 crystal reaper! (ps i wasn't joking about the holograms or seat belts.) part 1: box, instructions, dsss (dreaded sticker sheets), parts front of box: back of box: 2 x instruction booklets: dss numero uno - for the reaper dss number two - apologies for the blurry pic but i wanted to capture the sweet shimmy of the metallic holographic background on this sheet the way it catches the light really makes a difference to the small alien craft and makes it look much more interesting from the plain stickers of last year. there's heaps of spare silvery stuff once the stickers are applied for those who use the leftover sticker material for customising. parts bags - 4 numbered with one extra with larger pieces parts everywhere - woo! i know the lego instruction books scold me if i mix bags, but i'm a devil-may-care kind of guy. in your face, tlc. i love mixing all the parts together before i build, it reminds me of my youth when the days were long, anything was possible, and i didn't need strict instructions not to build on grass or poke my eye out with a technic shooter. interesting parts - these may or may not be new, my technic knowledge is not that detailed. the little scoop parts are so cute and have a heap of potential uses. i love 'em. they're like smurf hats at miniland scale. these technic wheel things in orange are also cute. they kind of remind me of marigolds. giant fabuland marigolds! the track pieces - you get 70 of these - here's the section of track for one side - as you can see it's about 52 studs long. these hold together better than the small ones on the hailfire droid/ jungle cutter. part 2: minifigs, small mining transport, alien ship i have to confess - i forgot to take an individual snap of the astronauts . it's the usual bunch though - scaredy face guy, sunglasses in space man and a third one i can't remember. you don't really care, though? you're only interested in the alien commander and his matching arms/ legs combo deal. as brickbitz noted in his review of the smaller set, the glowy eye is just a 1x1 cylinder. the set also comes with 2 normal jellies - one pictured here for size. you'll see what happened to the other one soon enough... the alien craft is nothing exciting, apart from the gorgeous glinting stickers. here's the road safety angle. the commander actually clips onto a 1x2 plate with handle so he can't fall out! then the lime tentacle thing descends on top of him to keep him firmly there, like a baby seat. not very brave for an alien commander, is he? i mean, did darth vader ever use a seatbelt? tssk. with cradle up: this part of the build also includes the small astronaut mining buggy - small and effective. (please note in this build i've applied stickers to everything bar cockpit pieces.) this comes with radio and saw piece. part 3: the reaper! the first part of the build is the detachable shuttle. i really like the retro aesthetic of this with the angled wings and the side hoverpod things. it is much better than the comparable vehicle from 7699. the new flickfire piece is a waste of space - it's fairly limp. i prefer the simple flickfire technic pin to be honest. there's also a very nice little side workshop as you can see. i really like how the control unit is 'plugged' into the wall via 5 1x1 round plates (third pic, it's a bit dark). great detail. [the technic pins on the back are there to connect the power functions battery box. it's odd they're included at this stage of the instructions - maybe the intention was to release it originally with all the necessary motors etc but the price point was too high and they scaled it back] the base. the shuttle sits on that bley technic axle in the middle when the reaper is fully assembled. the little vehicle scoots down the ramp at the rear, which folds up to hold it in place when the reaper is in motion. you can see there's a crystal container here as well - another nice small detail which i found the 2007 sets lacked. there's also an alien here - thankfully not in those horrendous trans-orange tubes so prevalent last year. the complete assembly. isn't it snug? it's just the right size too - not massive but large enough to be a serious mining vehicle. the ominous black treads contrast nicely with the white/ orange colour scheme of the vehicle itself. the trans detailing - blue for weapons, neon green for energy - is carried nicely through the whole set. the blades and the scoops whirl nicely as the machine trundles along. top down view: tread detail: whirling blades of death! the buggy descends: probably the most disturbing aspect of the whole set is this pic: the jelly has an orange pump plugged into its heart which is connected to an energy supply on the left hand side! this vehicle runs on alien jelly juice! either that or it's milking the jelly in some equally disturbing fashion. how amoral is that! i know there's been debate about this - the jellys aren't innocent, they're evil energy crystal thieving maniacs etc - but i find it a bit odd that the humans respond by chaining the jelly up to the bowels of their mining vehcile and suck energy from its heart. people debate about violence in lego as represented by realistic minifig weapons, but i think the moral lesson here is even worse - it's ok to exploit foreign life forms for our own gain if they treat us badly first! (who-fans, i think the ood should have a word with the jelly commander ) that aside, this set is well-designed and fairly good value at $aud79.95. it's definitely a notch above last year's mars mission sets overall, with improved detailing and more useful functions. the holo-stickers are fab and it's nice to have an alien commander, even if he is a bit bulky and his fingers are identical to his toes. however, if all these reasons by themselves weren't reason to recomend this set, the following is.... part 4: power functions the best part of this set - and the reason i bought it, really - is the integration of power functions. bizarrely this isn't mentioned at all on the box and i only found out about it from the instructions when they were posted on eurobricks! (instructions for book 2 which has the power function stuff available here.) this is a great idea and hopefully we will see more new sets take this kind of approach (especially with the new train sets). luckily i got monster dino 4958 on sale for half price earlier this year so already had most of the necessary motors etc - the only one needed was an extra small one. what you need is listed in the instructions below with redirections to shop @ home to buy the motors. note there's actually a mistake on this page. the 2 small motors you need are both 8883 not 8882 (which is the large xl motor). way to confuse the kids there, lego! attaching them was a dream and only took a few minutes (in contrast to 4958 where it was almost impossible to remove motor elements without dismantling the model). basically the back platform and some plates and orange slopes come off, you attach the motors, and then the smaller plates go back on. these parts are now left loose: overall the look of the reaper isn't badly effected as you're mainly viewing from the front anyway: sadly i can't show you how it moves, you'll just have to trust me that it does ! the way it is steered is demonsrated in the instruction pages above. basically each motor is controlled by a corresponding switch on the remote. move them both forward to move forward, move one right to turn right, move both back to move back etc. it zips along! it's a speedy little thing! personally i wouldn't want to be in it's path as it comes roaring down the martian canyon! (my cat was scared as it was.) it is oodles of fun and definitely worth trying if you have the motors or can get them cheaply, and adds a whole new dimension to the 'play' aspect of 'playset'. it is also as i said very quick to switch between modded and non-modded reaper in contrast to the more fiddly dino creations. the only problem i had is that if it moves too fast, the weight of the battery box at the back tends to pull the whole thing back and it rears up. it does correct itself though. i only trialled this on carpet last night so it may behave differently on other surfaces - i will need to experiment! part 5: summation this is a great set made even better with the addition of power functions. at $aud79.95 it's well-priced. buy it! buy the motors as well (k-mart still has stock of 4958 at $89, wait for a 15% off sale)! you won't regret it. buy 2 and make competing battle machines! the only thing is... just don't torture that poor jelly edited by sinner, 24 june 2008 - 03:25 am.

1 im not that into mars mission... but this set reminds me of the jungle cutter

1 you really are an awesome set reviewer, svelte_corps!! thanks very much for this sweet review, so in-depth and detailed, that is one sweet vehicle! it's got three of my favourite things, treads, orange, and big slicey blades! thanks again! ~peace

1 another great review. i'm looking forward to getting this set sometime soon. i wasn't aware of the power function aspect, similar i suppose to the old technic sets which had an additional instructions for those with the relevant motors. i knew those dino's i got at clearance would come in useful. nice to see the recent "bulldozer" treads appearing in black. grey seemed a slightly unusual colour choice.

1 these new sets are just totally off-the-wall radical :d. it's the little details like the scoops on the blades and the alternate alien energy source (lego didn't even have to include those, but they did!) that show lego are really getting back into their groove this year. the ability to add power functions is just so cool as well, i'm going to pick-up the creator monster dino set for the electronics when the sales hit as svelte has suggested. a very entertaining review, just like the agents mobile command center one :d

-1 this set looks 10 times sweeter with the power functions, too bad i'll have to buy some extra.

1 wow, this thing is very cool. definately no lack of details, and is quite cheap for the bang of the set that you get. for some reason i really love the bay in the back of the detachable ship. quite an improvement from last years line. thank you for the review.

1 thank you for that fine review, svelte_corps. thats a pretty cool set, much more solid than the armoured drilling unit, with a nice little transporter and some for sure pretty interesting additional power functions. a very smart idea indeed! did i miss something or is there really only one (and probably improved) shooting device? and therere even some levers to control the vehicles.... wow. a matured marsmission on indeed! now lets get rid of these poor utilized jellies and were right on the way....

1 isn't it a lovely set? i too have one. (modded, of course )

0 so, is there some way to get all those motor bits at once, or do you have to buy them on their own? i don't think i've ever seen them in a store here...

(if people have the ferris wheel set as well i think the small motor comes in that.)

0 this should be reported to the news .

1 well i guess its nice that they're making the story background a little more clear. with that jelly plugged into the power cable... hmmh, both jellies and crystals can be used as power sources, think theres a connection? both of them are transparent and greenish... maybe jellies hatch from crystals like eggs? or need them as food? or something important like that? yay for evil humans.

1 thanks for the great review sveltecorps. i bought some of the mm last year and ended up selling them off for sw. this new set has got me interested in mm again, partly due to your cool review! one question though, did you get this set in aust shops or s@h, just wondering if i should be looking for it yet? edit: sorry just saw your other post saying it was ordered from s@h cheers isc edited by i scream clone, 04 june 2008 - 08:08 am.

1 excellent review. loving. this. set. i mean, come on, it's a flipping tank! awesomeness is written all over this - from all those blades and scoops at the front to the mini rover. and yes, you can even turn it into a motorized battle tank! reminds me of the old technic days when they advertised in the manuals how to hook up the kits with separately sold motors. another day, another review of an awesome set. yes, this is sure tlc's year!

1 svelte_corps, on jun 3 2008, 12:09 pm, said: the only thing is... just don't torture that poor jelly i smell another "dont hurt the dragons/jellies" or something group nice reveiw i dont realy like the mm sets [we want more starjustice/space skulls!!!!!!] but this one looks ok i guess suprised they dont say that it has power functions on the box

1 really nice review! i love those sweet looking power functions on it, if only the orange bits could be replaced, then you could have a futuristic and motorized jungle cutter anyway, the alien bit was disturbing, but the overly-tall new commanders look very, very cool! all in all, a great set, but i won't be able to buy it, because, in a few days, s@h will become 600$ richer and my wallet will writhe around in pain on the floor.

0 algernon, on jun 5 2008, 02:03 pm, said: why is it that agents and star wars get their own news articles but this fantastic set is totally ignored? i think maybe there's a bit of star wars excitement on the front page which has probably got a few members frothing with excitement. not every review needs to be frontpaged anyway .

1 i appreciate your review mr. mandalorian, but why the negativity?. i'd try to find more positives about the set instead of kinda criticizing it after each picture. i personally think it looks freakin' awesome!. the size is very impresive and i nearly fell of my chair when i saw the first pics earlier this year. it's quite unlike anything i've ever seen from lego. edited by radiant7, 04 june 2008 - 08:27 am.

0 thanks for the review. i really like all the mars mission sets this year. the usage of the big wing is a bit annoying, but you can't blame lego for re-using the mold. i've been considering doing the same with mine! mr. mandalorian, on jun 4 2008, 02:19 pm, said: so, that's all folks. shall i include one last "bar" joke? i wouldn't have a bar of it...

1 thanks for the review, mr. mandalorian! this is an, er, interesting set. lots of frontal fire-power. very big too, and i like the idea of those two little craft that attach on the sides. sort of like little escape pod things. anywho, not one of the things on my to buy list, but i do like that radio-active sticker, that could come in use. looking forward to seeing your modifications, too! ~peace

-1 thanks for the great and very detailed review. i love the new holostickers! i'm still not sold on this set though. i'm not sure why... i think it's the big wing piece and the too-technicy build (from looking at the instructions). the platform seems kind of out of place. and for the size of the set, the functionality doesn't seem as good as it could be. it reminds me of 7699 armored drilling unit - looks impressive but doesn't seem to do that much. i do think mars mission has improved this year though. bar none, this is the weakest of the new mm sets i think.

0 thanks for the review. i have to concede this does appear to be the weakest set of the summer mm lineup. i've noticed a trend that the larger sets have plenty of parts potential but when assembled the model is not more than the sum of the parts... eagle base certainly didn't seem worth the asking price, at least this is one large model. on a positive note the lame aero tubes, darts and martian carrier pods have disappeared. don't get me wrong, i love mm and most of the lineup is great, this one just seems to fall a little short of the bar.

0 sinner, on jun 4 2008, 03:44 am, said: having a name like that is a good start! my screen name largely sums up my interest in lego, but is not soley limited to space. thanks for the warm welcome.

0 wow! i'll definately have to check this one out. i always tried making a big mining deployment ship, but it always turned out crappy. edited by maiq the liar, 04 june 2008 - 10:52 pm.

1 thanks for the review. i actually quite like this. i can't afford it, so i'm not getting too attached to it, but in its own way, it's great. it's certainly reminiscent of space sets of the past, as others have said, and the drop-down ramp section is just really cool. as an idea, you understand. sure, the lab is a little crap, but at least the effort was made (sort of ). the sheer fact that it's so big though, really makes me like this. there's just something appealing about large spaceships. not capital ships, just big space ships. with lots of guns! spacefan, on jun 4 2008, 10:34 pm, said: anyway, i hope were not breaking forum protocol by not discussing the 7644 review of the original poster or that particular set in general. hey, it's no worse than batbrick and i. no, really, it isn't even in the same league!

1 thank you for that nice review, mr. mandalorian. wow. somehow its almost like classic spaces back indeed.... its a great star ship. it looks stream lined, original and impressive and even the huge plane wing part looks rather cool and smooth on it. its equipped at least with some kind of engines on top of the wings and although theyre made with only two a little 'juniorized' parts its better than nothing. theres a lab or some sort of engine room with enough space inside to allow one or two mfs to play scotty.... yeah! the two cockpitsre nicely detailed with a cool use of these orange 1x1 round plates and to detach one or all two of them reminds a lot of the playability of the good old space sets. it seems even like its easy to attach them to some kind of cloud city twin-pod car thanks these hinged wings. looks like some solid fun to me. of course.... the cockpits arent airtight and even this reminds unfortunately of the post blue, grey and trans yellow era of cs. anyway, theres no real fun without some moding i guess. another great advantage of the sets that its not overpacked with shooting things. one technic shooter, cool in grey and only one trans orange prison pod too. well, i can surely live with that especially since its nicely asymmetrical. the drill rovers very charming, a little like a rebuilt oldsmobile convertibe stranded on mars. sweet! and that platform features plain nifty and well done too, very playable and useable for a lot of things. hmm.... recently i complained a lot about the dense use of studless technic beams for the inner structure of vehicles like these exoforce tanks par exemple which makes moding (in an economical way) pretty frustrating.... but the beams herere used in a very proper way. it should be fairly easy to mod, lets say, the back of that lab section up to perhaps even the cockpits to create a larger airtight area that could be boarded from the platform.... just to fit this certain spacers need for, um, realism.... therere many more nice details too like that 'satelite t.v.' thingy and that cylinder with trans blue 2x2 dish for the knob or these cylinders with cones on that handle, and that alien crafts pretty nice and detailed as well. like i said before.... i really feel like classic spaces back.

1 i think this thing is compensating the poor lab with the bar army.

1 sorry mr. mandalorian, i guess i was just getting a bit defensive because when this set first appeared here, there were literally 2 pages of people just bagging out the new mm sets (but then the thread took a turn and people started to warm to them, much like the agents). i do agree that it definitely needs some mocing, but with that work i think it has the potential to be a really amazing set in terms of what you could cram into it. the lab is a little disappointing, i've always wanted an enclosed cabin space in a vehicle this size because then all the little space guys can have a true meeting place! the drop-down landing ramp is my favourite part, it has lots of potential uses. maybe it's even possible to integrate pneumatics :d

0 hello shefols and afols, as well as tfols, welcome to eb news reviews, i am your host...for tonight anyway... shadows will take over after this episode, if we make more... today we are reviewing mars impulse sets 5616 and 5617. starting with 5617 alien jet, i must say it is a small and quick build, the jellie, is made of hard plastic, which surprised me, as i had expected jellies to be a soft plastic. the jet is mainly 2x4 plates, some swingy hinges, the "seatbelt" and a thing which i cannot seem to name my one gripe about it is that the jelly cant see where he is flying, it looks better with a mf in it. there was a red 1x1 as a spare part. we move on to the 5616 mini robot, which is basically a "safe" brick, with binoculars, soem cheese slopes, little arms, and legs. the best part i must say was the metal detector and "safe" brick, as these seem to be quite rare in sets (by my knowlage anyway). the austronaut has a face, shown in dr. sinsters review. the set also comes with a pick-axe and lime green gem. extra peices where a cheese slope, a green 1x1 and a white droid arm. that concludes these mini-reviews. i also will use this opportunity to show my photo setup. both sets are reccomended, if you either need a army, or are just trying to get a variaty of figs like myself. next wee-*camera fades* edited by sinner, 24 june 2008 - 04:17 am.

1 nice and pretty funny.... i dont like that little alien thingy but the other sets quite nice.

0 hello all eurobricks members, i will be presenting my first review on one of the harry potter's set. firstly, i must emphasize that i am not a very big harry potter fan or owned many harry potter sets. for this review, i will be highlighting what is the beauty of this small little set, and the reasons to own multiple sets of it. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. this set is featured in the harry potter movie, prisoner of azkaban. this set is orignally released in 2004, align with the harry potter's movie. this was actually one of the movie scene where buckbeak the griffin is appeared in the movie. the group of students are supposed to be having up close and personal with him. however, draco decided to disturb our lovely buckbeak. enough of this movie synopsis, i am sure fans of harry potter will know this better. box art featured mini-fig/creature background scene the scene is a simple garden, which had a very good mixture of spare parts for your mocs building. on its own, there is nothing outstanding about this set, except for the griffin. you can buy multiple sets for the griffin alone and for draco mini-fig. well, you don't need lots of draco. but for castle lovers, black cap are exceptionally useful, at least from my view. now, i will point out the following why this sets is so great for other reasons. hidden cover note that, this is the only mechanism which you can find in this set. it looks rather simple but quite useful. there are some little things hide in it too. greens, foilage and brown parts needless to say much, it offer 3 foilage, a green plant, 3 brown slopes, 2 ideal bricks and 1x1 brown brick for building a tree. great for jungle building, forest building and etc. i am sure there are many builders will look out for these. interesting parts it comes with a wizard book, owl, 2 printed tiles with a spider and stone prints on it. the far right, seriously i don't find any good use for it. can any eb members enlighten me on that gray thing on the right? grey parts it comes with a good 10 x 4 green plate. useful for adding as a platform. some more grey slopes for your mocs. there you have it, draco encounter with buckbeak comparing with deep forest ambush as you may remembered recently, there was an impulse set competition. one of my entries, which is under the history theme. the deep forest ambush was firstly inspired by this set, and made an improvement out of it. look at the improved tree compared with the orignal. summary review playability: 4/10 (not much to play with, except swooshing around the griffin) design: 5/10 (too simple and its defintely not related with the movie scene) parts: 10/10 (great for parts, explained by the review. a great deal of green and brown parts) price: 9/10 (an inexpensive set based on the 2004 pricing) overall: 7/10 (a must have for all harry potter fans and collectors whom needs a great use of green and brown parts) hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. more pictures can be found in my brickshelf (when moderated) let the potter magic begans! edited by whitefang, 09 june 2008 - 02:45 pm.

1 i own about 6 copies of this set!

1 this is one of the few sets i've bought more than one (2!) of. it has a really good selection of pieces, and your review really does it justice, whitefang. multiple hippogriff/griffins on! edited by shoc, 11 june 2008 - 05:58 pm.

0 thanks for the review, you made me very jealous... i want it also in multiple... but i don't own any of it. oh, well for later then...

0 thanks for that nice review of a really interesting and pretty cool set. at least, a griffin, i guess, is pretty close to an unicorn or a dragon, huh?

1 ohhh great idea to review the "old" potter sets! especially the line from prisoner of azkaban... i was in my dark ages then. luckily i was able to catch up on the missed figs with one internet order. this draco is the best tlc has made, if you ask me. the new one (also doubling for belloq and "guards" in the indy line) doesn't look quite as hautain as this one. buckbeak looks cool. looks like his neck/head can be moved, right? rather similar to lego horses. well designed. the orange brick doesn't have a pumpkin face on it, right? unlike the one from philosopher's stone in the set with the troll. i'm looking forward to more reviews by you, sir whitefang! good work

1 i bought about 5 or 6 of these sets when they were on sale in mid- 2006. i still have a few of them laying around unopened. i think i payed like under $5 for each and thats a great deal for all the variety of neat parts you get with this set.

0 nice review. i like the treemaking pieces the most of this not very expensive set. the buckbeak fig is very nice and can bow his head like the horses. i was annoyed to get another draco without some other not made figs (pansy parkinson for example). about the dark bley feathers; in the second version of hogwarts there were several of these feathers put in little 1x1 cones like it was a feather to write with it. i bought 2 sets of these and when they were for sale i just bought +/- 6 more of it. only annoying that i had then even a bigger army of draco's.

1 yay! the monster book of monsters! now i want this! i also love the buckbeak figure! it looks very realistic for a lego version of something, usually they are much worse (look at the goblins, for example)

1 hello eb! yes, i'm cranking out the reviews! the other day i picked up this gem for an okay sales price at devonport, tas, while searching for the new batsets. i informed iamded of this as he is a spidey-suckup ( ) and he informed me this was the only set he didn't have of the wave 2 of this theme. so i ask you great eb members to please remind him of this when commenting! here we go with the review of doctopus' lair: anyway, unlike other reviews, this stars more people, the batbrick-iamded-dragonator-daisy review! (daisy is the mouse that came in the set) first up re the figs, and i must say they are great. i love fleshies and these are excellent to expand my batman world, plus having a spiderman to beat up is good too doctopus is great, though his tentacles are annoying to keep in order. peter parker is a nice addition, i love that torso. eve though harry osborn was totally absent from this scene, i welcome him as he is a good fig also. best of all is mary jane, fleshie females are hard to come by and i love that hair, my very first one! oh, and even better is bley daisy on the far right: another fantastic thing is that by mixing mj with doctopus you get a far more deadly and real villain than anyone could've forseen - the hippy! oh c'mon, tell me that ain't cool? anyhoo, here is a pic of doctopus showing his might: random fact: did you know i influence both dragonator and iamded in their sigfigs? dragonator adapts his from my ia series while iamded added mutt hair when i had him like that in a pic i posted. now onto the box, sorry about the lighting. the art is good and the cartoon spidey in the corner may have beenthe inspiration for a similar style in the new batsets: back of the box. again, sorry about the lighting and blur, it was gtting late and these were the last pics: finally we get to the first part of the set: the catapult. is that movie accurate or what? i love the part in sm2 when he uses his homemade genetic spider powered catapult to launch himself to the scene! oh well, it does comes with a cool spider web an trans blue spider, so it gets some points: and it is really fun! i launched spidey several metres once, i don't think he ever recovered. infact, he almost certainly webbed himself slightly cooler extras are these two. this awesome little boat is great for city, as is the simple but nice bouy, daisy approves: naturally dragonator ruins everything when he found out the "dragon" that would be riding with him was our nickname for daisy now finally, the main attraction - coctopus' dock. iamded and i threw dragonator in the water to see if he could swim. he er, couldn't one sweeney todd later, we continue! the overall construction of the building is very good. i know a lot of people hated stickers and i hated applying these, but they do look spectacular and perfect for any city setting, like a bank, a gotham bank as iamded has already noted below me the black lifesavers a very cool as are the web piece and log pieces: the inside contains the neutron copperplate triple bypass humdrum holy hum 5000, which does does, see movie. anyhoo, it is very cool, and includes a little control thingy on the yellow brick next to it. unfortunately, the inside is plain but for that: the other side has no wall too which is a bit of a letdown really, but atleast it allows daisy easy access. one gripe is those yellow 1x1 bricks, they serve no purpose and break up the colour scheme: better shot of the thingy thing. i quite like it, the use of technic parts actually works, and the whole set is worth it for those purple flames and dishes alone it closes up pretty well too, unable to hit the dish which is a nice feature: me and iamded liked it so much we threw a revived dragonator into it. unfortunately it disagreed with him, but it was fun: another shot of the dock. i like how they have gaps in the jetty, i know the movie version was pretty wack, and although the set isn't very faithful to it (looks more like a seaside library to be frank) it still is very nice. this is my first large blue baseplate too which is wonderful, though funny how the set only uses about half of it: the roof is a well designed and fun feature, it uses some technic connections to render it flexible of any degree, as you can see here by my opening of it: better shot of the roof design, it can lie flat or at any angle. i might use the design myself in the future: as much as i love the building this feature bugs me, for in order for it to work this wall has to stick out, which not only looks ugly but makes you be able to see through the corners. still, easily modded, and log pieces are fantastic for mocing. it also means that there are 7 windows all up for a good, sizeable building: by pulling out the piece in the center the walls both collapss sideways outwards, which is actually pretty fun and works everytime: overall view of the set including characters: now for the story that makes no sense....at all: spiderman is dead after falling down the wall mechanism (see above): only daisy can save the day! for dragonator is being held by the evil doctopus! and iamded and dragonator are too busy not caring! and brainbox is too busy complaining that this goes against all marvel continuity! unfortunately daisy is on a lunchbreak so tough luck dragonator: and daisy goes on a search for fortune and glory: okay, this is what i think of the set: build: 3/5 - fun, but those stickers ruin the experience somewhat, and if you don't apply them the instructions are a bit hard to follow. playability: 4/5 - great little gizmos and bits, not the kind that keep you going like with the 2007 aquabase, but good fun still. design: 4/5 - not very movie faithful no, but still a great little building and a smart design for certain aspects. minifigs: 5/5 - great figs with all different faces and very useful bits. price: 2/5 far, far overpriced even on sale sadly total: 18/25 - a good set that could've been better with a few minor changes. nothing wrong with it, but it doesn't really cross the line to greatness. that said, it has a lot going for it and definitely worth buying or atleast a look! thanks for reading batbrick away! edited by batbrick, 13 june 2008 - 12:21 pm.

1 lookin' good so far! though i must say it's doc ock, not dok ock... the catapult is, well, ridiculous, but the boat is very spiffy, and the buoy is a nice addition! i actually like the stickers on the window pieces, perfect for this building, and great for post-apoc scenes. black life-saver rings are a nice addition too.anyway, hurry up dragonator and batbrick! and daisy! i want to see the rest of the review! ~iamded away!

0 great review as always, batbrick! ) i always enjoy reading them because they really make my day! )))) i hope that we shall see more and more.... good day, gentlemen! )

0 i got this set in 2006 in a 'byrnes world of wonder' toy shop. i dont remember how much, but it was a deal. the box was all battered but it had everything. good review batbrick.

1 thanks for the review, even if it is a number of years late. i picked this up whn it came out, and thought it was a rather cool set (besides the catapult). plenty of cool pieces, and the baseplate has found a use in the batcave. although i think my dad managed to spill some beer on it at one point. that was awful to clean off... batbrick, on jun 13 2008, 10:44 am, said: and brainbox is too busy complaining that this goes against all marvel continuity! i wasn't expecting that! there i was, casually scrolling down, when i stumbled onto a picture of me.

-1 where is my soap????!!!! haha, anyway, nice review as always, batbrick! i too have the set and hate the wall jutting out, catapult, and missing wall. but hey, review.

0 great review batbrick, i was curious as to what the interior of the building looked like, i still think that there should have been a few random chains or something lying around as they may add to the abandoned feeling that the ware house had. though i have to admit that i really like the roof dock and minifigs as some of them make good average civilians that are somewhat hard to come by in todays sets . great comic as well it seemed to add a lot to your review, hope you can review another spider man set soon . btw as adam mentioned i believe you owe me a bar of soap, for reading your review ... edited by mack, 14 june 2008 - 12:59 am.

1 very good review! i always wanted this set, shame i didn't get it.

0 a few years late, but great review! i really want to get this set!

0 great review! i wish i'd bought this set when it came out. oh well...

1 nice review! i would have snapped this up back in 2006 if i was not in my dark ages!

0 great review! and what are the stands that you used? they look much better than the white bricks that i use.

1 nice review! thanks valentin and a cool collection of prequel fighter you have there 'want'

0 commanderbly42, on jun 16 2008, 11:11 pm, said: great review! and what are the stands that you used? they look much better than the white bricks that i use. oh, those stands were once cd-r spindles. it's from the container that can hold 100 cd-rs. hi whitefang, can't deny that they were once my fav. hunts for lego, and yes, that price tag is a tad hard to remove. well, while am delighted at the v-wing, i still kinda wish it had come with a printed brick for its instruments panel.

1 thanks for the review; i've always liked that one but haven't had a chance to get it. now i'm sold- or the set will be sold- to me !

1 hmmm i must rebuild my sw ships [a-wing,jsf & v-wing just to name afew] nice review this is probable one of my favourite sw ships i cant belive i broke it for pieces [just to make small crap mocs] next time my friend comes over we will rebuild some of my sw ships [he always asks me if we can rebuild them so i finaly said yes ]

1 mofo jones, on jul 15 2008, 01:39 am, said: nice review, but i have to correct something for you: this quote is wrong - here's a link to the hasbro v-wing photo archive over on rebelscum.com and i have something to correct for you! valentin, on jun 15 2008, 09:53 am, said: hi everyone, please note that this review was done back in 2006, so do forgive me if you happened to notice any dated comments. the first sentence is your best buddy, my friend! anyway, nice review! love this set. dsr

0 oops. sorry, valentin!

1 imo, this set is the best sw set of 2006. its cheap and sturdy for me its 9.8/10

1 yes i recommend this set it was my second star wars set ever and i must say it was a stunner for me commanderfox

1 here's the 3rd of the whole batch of complete reviews done back in 2006. hope you guys enjoy them so far. product: 6206 tie interceptor theme: star wars no of pieces: 212 release date: february 2006 rrp: sgd39.90/usd19.90 availability: lego shop@home, target, toys 'r' us (us & europe), bricksworld (sg). lego.com said: challenge the rebels! blasting out of star wars episode vi: return of the jedi, the tie interceptor is the fastest fighter in the imperial fleet! open the cockpit canopy and fold down the instrument panel to put the tie pilot inside and recreate your favorite classic star wars battles! includes tie fighter pilot! cockpit opens and instrument panel folds down! it does seem to have more pieces than the average tie fighter, but this is actually cheaper than the 7263 tie fighter. of course, there's no light-up feature in this set. :sweat: yesh!! finally... a... tie interceptor!! this is probably the most anticipated for all set for all lego tie collectors worldwide, since the fighter, bomber, advanced, and even the expanded universe droid fighter had been released by the lego group. this set is near movie-accurate, since the bottom part of it ain't. :p the cockpit and pylons uses the same design as that of the tie advanced piloted by darth vader. except for one minor change, that is the aft interior of the cockpit is strengthen this time. and this is indeed good news, since the older models had a problem of hard hinge and loose brick connection. there's no landing gear for this set, but it doesn't require it anyway. this tie interceptor balances perfectly on its wings. standard instruments panel and, of course, standard imperial pilot. the "swoosh-able" or play factor of this set is definitely very high... just take a look. :d *camera view from own craft* *camera view from tie-advanced* *combat simulation of endor's battle from the archives* no bomber, since i started late in re-collecting. :p to conclude, for a typical lego fan, this set is a 60/40, 60 due to it's good design, and for a typical star wars fan, this is a must-get. the only flaw for this set is the same flaw for any lego set in sg, the price. :doh: comment(current in 2008) being a starwars fan... no... being a typical toy collector, space is definitely a premium... so much so that i turned to lego starwars to sate my appetite for more starwars products when i already have no more display space. for the next few non-lego pictures, they are the crown of my starfighter collection in 1/18 scale. so just view them for fun, eh? and no, i haven't had the chance nor the time to do up a scene of my lego starfighters blowing up spectacularly since the pieces would be very hard to put back... hmm... then again, isn't that what lego is about. "doh".

0 why have you uploaded this twice???

0 skipper 24, on jun 15 2008, 08:02 pm, said: why have you uploaded this twice??? because this review is very good! thanks for all the pics! i want to buy that set too! they are so big! but why did lego made them in these strange black/d.blue colors? this set is very old, i saw it one time in my local toyshop for 69 euro and now it's gone, pitty. will look on ebay.

0 great review!! thanks for posting!

0 y'know you can open the bag

0 it's called challenging one's self :-p plus you can resell it as misb since it's still sealed in the polybags lol

0 there's something called opening the bag do you do this with everything lego set there's something called opening the bag do you do this with everything lego set

0 now now, don't judge people who do this. there have been bigger sets that were done in the bag. to each his own :)

0 ahhh bag building... that takes me back. i suspect that if i didn't do my bag building topic my eb life would have turned out very differently. for the negative nancies, i suggest you try it. i bought a set just so i could, and i found it fun. (not fun enough to do it again though!) thanks for the interesting review.

0 i bought a tiny turbos set(a no-no for me) after i saw this "bag building." it's actually pretty fun. i built it faster than i would if i had opened the bags!

-1 nice review, i have the original at-at and i like it a lot. considered buying this one but it being motorized made me not. also, i think a set this size could really come with some more snowies! benny

1 great review indexing it, as i write this. how come you think the ctt is the at-ats predecessor? do you mean the motorized at-at or at-at's in general? i think this is a great set and i am very fond of mine. it's one of the few sw sets of mine that is on "parade" at all times. most are packed away in the attic. kimt [btw it's not alone, the older version of the at-at is keeping it company]

0 nice job with this review skipper

-1 nice review ! the "driver/pilot whatever you call him" ( ) 's helmet looks kind of odd, and why does have a long red pole instead of a kick-butt lightsaber?

0 smith_boy, on jun 20 2008, 06:01 pm, said: i doubt that. the atat was used in the clone wars. well you never know, maby veers was around then, just because it was used in the clone wars dosent mean that veers didn't design it. to wookiepedia!

0 vader had a red pole because i think it makes him look bigger and in the films i doubt it is but i think his saber might be bigger.

-1 i never got the set. it looked way to skinny. i came close to buying it for the figs but then decided not to. if you compared this one to the later one there is a big difference. this one just didnt seem proporshined with the legs and its body.

1 thank you for the review, skipper. i never got this set because it was too expensive, and motorized. it completley reminded me of the old robotic toys called zoids, or maybe even gundum. at least the figs are great. a chrome lightsabe hilt for luke, ecxellent. and the pilot is cool too, and another snowie doesnt hurt. and i didnt even know about the commander guy (whatever you call him), so people could have made a custom ds this whole time?! thanks again!

1 this is one of those sets that you just have to have, i mean a motorised at-at is a dream set for original trilogy fans and has an awesome set of minifigures.

1 10143 death star ii production year: 2005 pieces: 3441 minifigs: 0 price: 299 usd peeron.com 10143 gallery the review ph4tdud3:"ds review!!!?!!! - u 2 kewl 2 do diz" me:"yes" ph4tdud3:"kewl..do u have pix of the minifigs?" me:"erhm..what minifigs?" ph4tdud3:"the ph4t figs from the ds!!1" me:"this is the other death star" ph4tdud3:"omfg there's more than 1" me:"yes" ph4tdud3:"keeeeewl. must have!!" me:"goodbye" [pushes the incinerator button] ph4tdud3:"wut?! nooooooooooooooooooo..........." and on that note, let's start the reivew of the ucs death star ii. now this is an older set (2005) and i've only gotten around to buying it a short while ago. it took me around 2 evenings to build it and i must say that i am fairly impressed by this set. time for a box pic: the build: since i started building this huge (small moon size) set at morten's appartment, i wanted to keep as few polybags open at any given time as possible. with this set it is actually possible to have a minimum of bricks scattered over a table or two while building. not sure why, but the division of bricks in the different polybags just work very well. and that is great with a set this size - 3441 bricks. the building of the set is divided into several "build this times x". for example the upper and lower part of the "unshielded" ds are completely alike. this is difficult to see when looking at the model, but heaven when building it: and this is how they solved the problem of having the wings connected to the buttom of the death star - geniously done imo: note that in the first pic the "skeleton" is easily seen. "the skeleton" holds the x to which both the upper and lower part is "clicked" on with technic pins. also there's a steering wheel (i'm sure there's a pirate name for that ) like the one in the bottom, in the top of the model to hold the upside "wings". so after having build duplicate wings (upper and lower), the "belt" (all the way around the star) and the upper and lower part of the "unshielded" side, it was time to step back and watch the death star ii in all it's glory: such a great ucs set. now i did have a few "huh's" during the build: huh! #1 in the instruction the technic lesser-dragon-head should be dark grey, but i got it in light gray. go figure and thank you replacement parts. i've experienced this before and apparently tlg uses different colours when "out-of-stock". all one has to do is call them and ask for the right colour and it's on it's way still a huh! experience. huh! #2 again it appears that tlg changed the design of the technic axleholed 1x2 bricks. the bottom has changed and i got the set where it was mixed up between "old" and "new" version. not that annoying, but still got me perplexed as to: "am i doing this right?" kinda stressing to consider taking most of the star apart to check the remaining 231 technic bricks 1x2 with axlehole. now for a verdict: : 1: looks great 2: even my "wife" likes it - female appeal 3: it's a great build 4: the polybags work for you 5: it's star wars 6: the design is awesome : 1: it wobbles if you touch it 2: very small parts come off, if you touch it 3: parts come off when you try to move it somewhere safe 4: zero swooshability so in short (yes even shorter]: the dsii is a well designed ucs set that has a great design. like most other ucs sets, it is not meant for play - hence don't play with it. ucs verdict (the numbers) 5/10 (design++/instructions+-/bricks+-/sturdiness--/colourscheme+-) design: awesome look and great greeble set instructions: easy to follow steps with bricks mentioned hard to see wether it's black or dark grey bricks: loads of great bricks a zillion bricks of the same type sturdiness: don't touch colouscheme: grey in grey with a little touch of black need a missing instruction? then click the logo

-1 thanks for the review kimt - it comes at a... confusing time you can take off the top disk and lift it like the millennium falcon from the top now. i actually don't like this set that much. it takes about 5 hours and 15 minutes to build if you do it in one go, but the repeating sections makes this built the most tedious i have experienced. it has way too many holes from which you can see the colorful skeleton and is overpriced compared to the older 10030 isd. i remember thinking it was too expensive when it was 50% off at s@h! even the snowspeeder was "kewler" to less than half the price:

-1 hmmm, ive still got this set and i must say, i think you did a good job of reviewing it. but... overall, i hate the set, probably the worst ucs set so far (apart from the naboo fighter but that hardly even counts as ucs) from my experience. unless you really really want it and have nothing better to spent your $$$ on, in that case go for it. but in my case, it was a very repetitive build and final model was quite... well, bland, not must variety to it, if you know what i mean.for the price, i would really reccomend the ucs star destroyer, because thats a much better story..

-1 thanks for the review. eh, honestly, i though this was awful ever since i first saw the pictures. to me, an incomplete grey ball doesn't really work as a special ucs kit, for the sole reason that it's boring. extremely so. now, the new death star playset is a whole different story. they should have done that in the first place. edited by grevious, 24 june 2008 - 09:12 pm.

1 great concise review kimt, though its not for me, you held my interest all the way through! thanks isc

-1 i think it's a very weird and boring ucs set, but... what a lot of grey plates! you could build something much better out of them, but it would be fairly flat. it looks very fragile though , my ucs at-st is... edited by shoc, 25 june 2008 - 10:28 am.

-1 thanks for the review kimt! honestly, like the others have said, i don't find any appeal in ucs sets, especially this one. it's just a big, incomplete, grey ball.

1 kimt, on jun 25 2008, 08:34 am, said: i don't agree that the isd is better - imho they're exactly them same - big and grey this is a question of personal liking - which is the coolest ds or isd. not comparative. here are some advantages that makes isd win for me: - a lot more fun to build with less repetitions - it is easier to build alternate models from it! (how many alternate models of the ds2 have you seen?) - the bricks are more varied. - you get magnets! - it is a larger set if you look at the size

-1 wow, what a letdown. i recently picked up this set, and i looked up this review to see what i was getting into. not good news. the silver lining is that it was a "damaged box" deal at brickworld, so it only cost me $100 (half off the already lowered price) so it was definatley worth it as a parts pack, if nothing else. it's the last unopened/unbuilt "large" kit in my collection, so even if it is repetetive, i am going to build it anyway. it is likely however that i may substitute pieces to do away with the colored interior. i've already determined that after it sits on display for a while, i want to do a zepplin as an alternate build. looking at the parts list it looks like its the perfect set for such an undertaking.

0 i'd love to get my hands on one of these, but you'd need about three jobs to justify the prices of this guy on ebay. fantastic review kimt!

1 kimt, on jun 24 2008, 03:22 pm, said: 4: zero swooshability i think its very swooshable, assuming you swoosh it at the same speed it moves in the movie. :d while i would never do something like this, i bet if you packed this sucker with a bunch of m80 firecrackers it would make for a fantastic end to a stop motion movie. with it being as delicate as you say it is i bet you wouldn't destroy any parts. edited by gotoandlego, 03 april 2010 - 02:57 pm.

0 i decided to re-read this review because i just got this set today. i dont really have a concern over the design or repeating build process because owning this set was never an option for me as i collect ucs sets... but i am surprised to see an almost total lack of positive posts. i really hope that i enjoy this build.

-1 i bricklinked it too back in the day. it was an interesting build - just thought building the "unfinished" hemisphere was kind of tedious.

1 i've just ordered the bits for this from bricklink (i'm awaiting the final order now) so i'm interested in these comments. i can see that, since i'll be building it with the kids, i'll have to plan in plenty of breaks and do lots of parallel building to keep us all from getting bored!

0 sorry about that skipper, i added the topic after the first pic was uploaded just to make sure the pics would be in the post. you probably posted while i was editing it. and i had to go to visit my grandparents, im at their house right now. sorry if you got freaked out!

0 very nice review jim! i haven't bought this set yet, but am planning to just to get a gg fig as i don't have one already. bought an imperial landing craft instead this week as it was on sale, but after this review, gg's fighter is sure to follow soon benny

0 the set no longer looks as ugly as i've always thought. thanks for the review - i might have to pick one up now to go with the magnaguard fighter.

0 hey, thanks for all the feedback, guys! ill try to do the sith infiltrator this weekend.

0 yesterday i buy this set,and i'm waiting for a pack! this review is very helpful! jimbutcher, on jun 27 2008, 08:34 pm, said: ill try to do the sith infiltrator this weekend. i wait!

-1 jameseh, on jun 28 2008, 08:24 pm, said: does the sliding cockpit come off easily? my friends brothers breaks everytime you touch it, but he may have built it wrong. it put me off the set. im very sad to say that sometimes it does. but thats only if you hold it from the top and bottom with your fingers and thumb respectivly. but if you hold it in your palm or from the sides, it wont break. emphasis on sometimes. but dont try to mess around with it by removing its pieces or adding new one, or modding it in any way, because the sliding mechanism wont agree with the mods and break. but this hardly takes away from anyone liking this set because, imo, its perfect just how it is.

1 yeah! general grievous starfighter will land in my house! greate set, i love decals - brown and sandy pattern... ingenious! btw. when you show sith infiltrator review? i wait... :)

0 nice review, i bought a couple of these for parts, the only thing i dont like about the ship itself (not the lego version, it does fine) is why is the grand droid general flying around in in a small fighter like this, i prefer the battlefront interpretation witch uses it as a bomber. anyway, great review! -york

1 it's all good... but!(i know, you expected a but ) it's a rat.

1 thanks for the review. bearing in mind that the whole point of this set is to get a cheap troll warrior, i actually quite like it. the cart isn't brilliant, but for 13 pieces it's not that bad. the troll fig is great as always, and i guess the rats are always nice to get (not so much in real life though). the sets that contain the trolls have a fairly solid number each (i mean, tower raid has three!), but nevertheless i think i may have to pick up a few of these. whitefang, on jul 2 2008, 02:49 pm, said: in addition, the flick missile really works. use a little bit of force from your finger and flick it, the missile will fly. well, it certainly does not impress me at all with such playing feature. the troll's hands are going to get quite sore then aren't they?

0 trooperdavinfelth, on jul 2 2008, 03:15 pm, said: it's all good... but!(i know, you expected a but ) it's a rat. or maybe a very large mouse

1 its a good review but you forgot another thing. the troll needs a shiled like they used to in the 2007 castle line the sets always had shields for the minifigs and it could be better if it was 3.00 instead of 3.50 but yes it is a good impulse great army builder.

1 a more affordable troll warrior for those of us avoiding the large sets (me) is always nice! thanks for the review! god bless, nathan

1 very good, nice to see how its all played out. nice review!

1 grrr... you beat me to it! i got two of these in the mail today and was so eager to do a review of it. thanks for saving me the work. edited by wilhelm screamer, 03 july 2008 - 03:30 am.

1 ah, sweet! thanks for the review, whitefang! i hope this set shows up in nz soon, i can't wait to get my hands on it! troll warrior on! ~peace

0 hey, your review is great (as usual!!) as for the set itself - well, it's an impulse set after all - small and cheap, nothing special. well, the rat is special, hehe, for me the rat is the most interesting in the set (cause i don't have a rat). i don't have a troll warrior either, but i'm not very interested.

1 nice review, i will definately need a few of these!

0 whitefang, on jul 3 2008, 04:06 am, said: i thought by calling it as a "mouse", it will be a little much friendly unlike calling it a rat. why is mouse friendlier than rat?

0 whitefang, on jul 4 2008, 05:43 pm, said: well, mouse sounded more friendly, because it can associate with tom and jerry. but, calling it a rat equal calling it a pest.. it's just a matter of putting it in different terms. that's all. the thing i dont get is how jerry is friendly

1 this is a nice way of building up orc armies, but i do wish it was designed like the knight impulse set. there you have a minifig, enough weapons and armor for two figs and a weapons rack made out of basic pieces. add a generic fig from your collection and you have two knights and the pieces from the rack can be easily used in mocs. the pieces that make up the siege weapon in the orc impulse are not as easy to use in other creations. i'd rather have seen a "orcish" weapons rack (different from the knights rack, but like it, using basic elements) with a second helmet, another weapon, the orc armor and a shield to put on it. still, although not as good as the knight impulse, it's a nice little set. whitefang, on jul 4 2008, 03:43 am, said: tom and jerry is reflected as a cartoon. children associate jerry as a mouse, since its supposed to be heart-warming and make us laugh. in real life, there are many different pets we raised. one of the possible pets we considered is a mouse. mouse are supposed to be shy and friendly creatures that live in harmony. while rats lived in packs, hunt food in the dark and is widely regarded as a "pest". where i come from people keep both as pets. however, if either are found in the house uninvited, they are considered pests. and if you look at the chinese zodiac, rats are very well thought of and are symbols of prosperity. the brick mouse rat

1 thank you for the review. the set is nice, i didn't need the flickfire missiles and would have rather a orc/trol shield instead, but i think i will pick one up.

1 hello all eurobricks members, i will be doing a continuation of my impulse set reviews. i was pretty excited when i laid my hands on these new impulse sets yesterday. hope to give most of you a good insight for this set. name: street cleaner theme: lego system / town / city year: 2008 pieces: 22 minifigs: 1 an image of a 5620, street cleaner let the cleaning begin the street cleaner has a job to do. it is to clean the rubbish on the streets, after a new year countdown. it seemed the cleaning agency have a new equipment to use. it's not as big as the previous street sweeper machine. the cleaner will need to operate the equipment manually, by pushing it. look at the mess after sorting out look at the pieces offered. it's not a very complicated set, since it's an impulse set. there are some pretty useful parts lying around such as the broom, spade. however, i was quite surprised when i could not find the lid of the rubbish bin. i can't used this rubbish bin to place it around my town, without a lid on top of it. i believed it is not a norm, by not including the lid. look at that bin well, that rubbish bin seem to be containing his equipment in it, instead of the rubbish. the cleaner's face looks pretty sad. i think he wants to have a change of job. front view i love that blue brush very much. quite fun to play with, especially pushing the rubbish aside. that's why a spade is there to help him to dig out the litter and the broom to brush it away. ok, now i know why his face looks so sad! where is that street sweeper machine? summary review playability: 6.5/10 (not bad to play with) design: 7.5/10 (the design is relatively interesting, with the use of the technic part, to be its foundation.) price: 8/10 (an inexpensive set to get another cleaner and some neat accessories.) overall: 7/10 (not a bad set after all. pretty average, but still quite good to buy if your towns required more cleaners.) hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my brickshelf(when moderated) edited by whitefang, 04 july 2008 - 03:44 pm.

1 thanks for the review . not a bad price (of course, its impulse) for a fig, a little cleaner thing, and two accesories. the brush, fig, and spade i dont have yet, so i might just pick this up.

1 looking at this is making me want to build one of the favourite sets of my childhood, 6649 street sweeper (might do that today actually). cheap. good pieces (despite the lack of a bin lid... that's just inviting disaster isn't it?), nice fig, and one of those blue brushes, which i've always loved but never managed to use. thanks whitefang.

1 glad you guys like the review. brainbox, on jul 3 2008, 06:19 pm, said: looking at this is making me want to build one of the favourite sets of my childhood, 6649 street sweeper (might do that today actually). cheap. good pieces (despite the lack of a bin lid... that's just inviting disaster isn't it?), nice fig, and one of those blue brushes, which i've always loved but never managed to use. the 6649 looks lovely, and i hope you managed to restore it. indeed, a bin without a lid is inviting trouble.

1 thank you for the nice review. this set looks good. i have too many of the blue sweepthings, but the fig is nice and i didn't have this face, so i will pick up one some day.

1 wow, what a great little impulse set! i relly dig the face as well as a chance to get some cool accessories like a broom, bin (no lid....sigh) and a mushroom top (hat). a really nice review and story too whitefang, i think this guy will be joining my set of lego when he shows up in australia. cheers isc

1 thanks for the review! poor little minifig: this guy has to haul the heavy machine all the way from the depot onto the littered streets to locate some trash, but when he has finally found some and switches on the machine everything will be launched towards his pants.... no wonder he's looking sad.... a nice set though, and inventive too! when it comes to streetsweepers, i remember getting the first of it's kind on my birthday in 1991.

1 hello all eurobricks members, i will be doing a continuation of my impulse set reviews. this will be the third review at a go. hope everyone of you will find this review useful in a way. name: coast guard kayak theme: lego system / town / city year: 2008 pieces: 21 minifigs: 1 an image of a 5621, coast guard kayak roll roll, roll your boat it seemed the coast guard has a kayak of his own, roaming in the sea, making sure that swimmers will be safe in the beach. now, i am illustrating him as a life guard instead. this set is simply wonderful. among the 4 new impulse sets, coast guard kayak is the best looking set in my opnion. the kayak design is very simple but looks realistic . furthermore, if you don't need it to be a coast guard kind of stuff. use it as a leisure water spot instead down in the marina. i will think any lego citizen will love to have some water spot in their busy life. so come down here and wind down with this new sport. bits and pieces kayak and the bouy the bouy is very useful to position it at the coast of your water to highlight the boundaries in the sea, and warning incoming ships or vessels. oh, i did not make it tilted purposely. there is a white round base which allow it to tilt on both ends. useful parts these parts are useful to add on in your city. somehow, when i see that red cone, i can use it as a police stop, to inspect vehicles on the road or form a barricade with it. the bouy base shape is unique too. i like it very much. it is great to attached it by the side of the boat as a life bouy. the coast guard's life vest and helmet are very useful for water activites. the life vest was produced in past sets, and now it re-surfaced again. i am glad these vests made their way back. a look of him, without the life vest summary review playability: 7.5/10 (fun to play with, especially the bouy when you see it moving up and down.) design: 8.5/10 (design is simple but straight to the point, especially the kayak design.) price: 8/10 (an inexpensive set to get more coast guards and more kayaks.) overall: 8.5/10 (a very good set to have in your lego town. the kayak is simply so lovely to me.) hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my brickshelf (when moderated)

1 thanks for doing these impulse sets, whitefang. this set looks like it has a good number of useful parts. i dont have the minifig torso or head, nor the oar or the life jacket.

1 whitefang, on jul 3 2008, 03:18 am, said: this set is simply wonderful. you know, that's exactly what i thought. i love it! it's simple, well designed, and cute. there are some nice pieces in there as well, and i really do quite like the fig- the new coastguard torso looks great. thanks!

1 excellent review; i like how the new coast guard sets blare out new when you see them.

1 i really enjoyed your review of the kayak! so many little things in one set that aren't currently in my collection. i didn't even realise it came with a buoy! cool helmet, lifejacket, face, and oar, i will definitely need one of these! cheers isc

1 hello all eurobricks members, this will be my last impulse set review for the second wave. hope everyone of you will find my reviews useful and helpful in your purchase. name: crystal hawk theme: lego system / mars mission year: 2008 pieces: 26 minifigs: 1 an image of a 5619, crystal hawk alpha 3 in sector 5, reporting to base alpha 3, crystal hawk, reporting for duty, sir! may i present mars mission, latest scout craft, code named "crystal hawk". this spacecraft looks very sleek and cool with its usual white and orange color combination. i am not a fan of mars mission, but these white mini-figs simply attracted me for it. in fact, i only owned its impulse sets, and none of its main sets. nevertheless, this set has the "swoosh" factor. i was swooshing around in my home last night. well, i am not swooshing it like kimt though. am i seeing double? haha, the answer is "no". it has double sided face. i combined the pictures, to illustrate the two facial expressions. bits and pieces different angles love the way how the wings bend upwards and downwards. the only thing i find it a little bit wierd for spacecraft. normally, i thought joystick is the typical navigation controls for a spacecraft instead of a steering wheel? i am not complaining about a steering wheel in a spacecraft. to me, it's quite an uncommon sight. anyway, the white steering wheel is an useful part for making vehicles mocs. summary review playability: 8/10 (fun to play with when you bend the wings up and down.) design: 8.5/10 (design is simple, but creates a sleek and cool look.) price: 8/10 (an inexpensive set to get more scout craft and mars mission mini-figs) overall: 8.5/10 (a very good set to have for any mars mission fans, and for collectors like me whom can't afford all mars mission sets, this set is a very great alternative.) hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my brickshelf (when moderated)

1 one of the better impulse sets imo.

0 thanks for pics. the hawk, it seems to me, lacks a cockpit, theres not even a seat to keep the pilot from falling off. perhaps it they'd redesigned it to be a backpack jetpack sort of unit using similar pieces, it'd at least make some sense? based on the other mm impluses, can we assume this goes for 3.5$usd? at that price it seems to me, that the astro fighter at 5$usd was already a superior impluse set. guess i'd buy one on clearance, for the minifig.

1 thanks for another review whitefang! this is quite a nice set actually. it evokes some of the design elements of the mx-11, while looking different enough to justify me buying it. the head on the astronaut is one i like, so even better. i hadn't realised it was that one actually. does 26 pieces make it one of the bigger impulses sets? i think i may have to get one, if not two... plus it's called 'crystal hawk'. how can that not be considered cool?

1 thanks for your comments, guys! i really appericate it. brainbox, on jul 3 2008, 06:11 pm, said: this is quite a nice set actually. it evokes some of the design elements of the mx-11, while looking different enough to justify me buying it. the head on the astronaut is one i like, so even better. i hadn't realised it was that one actually. does 26 pieces make it one of the bigger impulses sets? i think i may have to get one, if not two... imo, impulse set total piece count should be 30 or less. it will be ideal and more ways to construct a much better impulse sets such as past impulse sets that we came across. i may be wrong, on the 30 piece count thing. but, this is how i view impulse sets. brainbox, on jul 3 2008, 06:11 pm, said: plus it's called 'crystal hawk'. how can that not be considered cool? do you know i bought this set, mainly because it have such a cool name attached with it. "crystal hawk", i simply fell in love with that name.

1 thanks for the great review. now i just have to have that set!

1 i like this one aswell, it has a couple of parts i need for an moc train locomotive and i don't have any of those space guys yet. and a double faced guy is always a winner in my book

1 once again, another outstanding review by svelte_corps! i am not a very big fan of agents, but this theme defintely offer plenty of useful parts. this volcano base is simply fanastic for parts usage, especially in doing up landscaping, with mountains, by making use of the brown burps. i must admit that the exterior looks real cool, but the interior looks rather empty. these orange slopes certainly make a great illustration of the larva, which gives the agents a hard time to infiltrate within its compound to save his comrade. i am quite sure, this set will defintely attracts lots of kids to coax their parents to buy it, since the bright colors will defintely caught their attention. with all those hi-tech, sleek weaponary, i am sure this is the next big thing for kids out there. well, i am not sure if this theme works for me as well. but this set defintely works well for landscaping project.

1 thanks for another great review! i definitely like this set. sure, the interior might be a bit bare, but i think that the outside of the base with all of the great lava and rocks more than makes up for it. it is a bit weird that on the one side there is nothing on the inside. but that's easy to fix. anyone know when this will be out in the u.s.? thanks again for the fantastic review!

1 droool must buy!!!!!! to svelte_corps: how on this wonderful planet, did you get that??? i thought it was coming in september!!!

0 darth_legois_619, on jul 7 2008, 11:33 pm, said: and thats not including 2 other sets that i dont want yeah, break jaw sets are generally worse than the other ones. anyway, the review was great. can we have a close-up of fire-arm's face?

-1 honestly i'm too much of a space fan to be interested in this set. i'd rather have the sub. good review though. :d

0 nice set review i really liked the narrative for the review. i must have missed your custom base back in june, also well constructed and great story too!

0 awsome review dude im proably getting this though the main downfall is there is hardly an inside

1 thanks for the step-by-step!! set looks great! mmmmm, clawdette....

0 great review!!! realy thank you svelte_corps! maybey you can put al the agents villains round dr. disco like a sort of dicussionroom or something...just an idea undersigned mowo

1 thanks for the review svelte_corps, i have yet to purchase an agent set but i think that will change shortly. i am not a big fan of the stickers but the huge laser gun, the unique minifig design, and beaucoup trans-orange pieces have me sold.

1 i know the word "secret" base but whats this! the base is hardly secret with a massive laser gun and wide screen sticking out it looks good, lots and lots of orange! woo!

1 i'm still keeping my money payments until july 26th ...so i won't be able to buy this set unless i get some money prize or something however, i appreciate the review, and hopefully i will get this set sometime in the near future. i just love these new cybernetic arms

1 this will be a wonderful set for a mustafar moc

1 i didn't exactly know where this belongs the best but i think it fits the best in here cause it's somewhat space related. i got this nifty little set yesterday from an auction ebay, new and sealed! i think the rock raiders theme was a great theme, and i wish they would have continues id back then. but anyway, let's see what we got here: set nr.: 4910 name: hover scout number of minifigs: 1 number of pieces: 39 release year: 1999 first, a picture of the little box & instructions: a general overview of the set: and here we have the lovely (?) miss jet! (yes, the minifigures had odfficial names in this theme ) the little vehicle: and finally the crystal analysis station. i like that very much, even if it's simple, but it does a good job and the amount of equipment also is cool: that's it, little set, little review, but big fun. i can recommend that to everybody, it's great for the parts, and the minifig is lovely. gets a 10/10 from me

1 omg iamded's torso! [ spoiler] oh my god!![ /spoiler]

1 great review . man, this brings me back! i still have like 5 of those rock monsters. in response to your statement, rock raiders does belong in this forum, being everything space related. 1) it's on an alien planet 2) in the computer game's start and in the story (yes, there was a computer game-my cousin has it) they are in a space ship 3) there are huge alien rock monsters trying to kill them.

0 great review and such a nice figure! i consider rock raiders space too. i also consider many of the diver themes space as well... i've yet to own a rock raiders set. i have tried to buy a few off ebay, but they always went too high...

0 sinner, on jul 20 2008, 04:56 pm, said: i consider rock raiders space too. i also consider many of the diver themes space as well... me too. the rock raiders are very sci-fi, with the best lego space storyline. the aquazonies would be inner space rather than outer space though, but they look very 'spacey'. edited by shoc, 20 july 2008 - 07:45 pm.

0 7663 sith infiltrator year: 2007 number of pieces: 310 number of minifigs: 1 price: 29.99 usd brickset hello everyone, and welcome to my second review on eurobricks, the sith infiltrator! lets start with a pic of the box, shall we? as you can see, its a limited edition set, meaning the fig and set could be worth a lot in the future. this set takes about 20 minuets for the seasoned builder. an overview of the infiltrator (also know as the scimitar): as seen in the picture, this ship is very sleek, with very few studs on top (snot= studs not on top). basically, its the cockpit with two wings (with two "fins" on each wing), attached to the hull. heres a side view of the scimitar: very cool- looking! it lands on two "feet" in the front while the cockpit rests on the ground. rear view: the back. the outer cockpit is beautiful, a printed piece on the back (no dreaded sticker sheet! (dss)) and a large printed disc on top: heres a look at the middle: there is a flick-fire missile (trans-red cone attach to technic pin) on the inner wing, a trans-red lightsaber blade in the back of the hull, and a trans-red lightsaber blade in between the fins on either side. all of those lightsaber blades may come in handy... hey, look: the fins open from the wings!: the fins open due to double hinges on each fin. unfortunately, you have to hold the ship up in order for the bottom fins to open. now, lets have a look inside the cockpit: to open, you lift the back printed part, which is attached to the printed disc on top, which is attached to a hinge. it opens pretty smoothly, but is somewhat loose, so sometimes it closes on its own. also, the disc isnt secured well enough to the door, and often breaks off, even with the smallest movement to it. inside, there is an elevated control panel and two sliding pieces near the floor. this ship also comes with a small speeder bike: its very cleverly built, and is a really neat addition. see that clear disc on the bottom? it fits perfectly into the sliding pieces in the cockpit: hmm... whats this?: a hidden compartment! now this was a very cool idea by tlg, a secret compartment found by taking off the top slope of the hull contains darth maul's weapons and tools which include: a (chrome!) lightsaber hilt, a pair of electrobinouculars, and three probe droids. a closeup of a probe droid: just a plain, black minifig head with a black lever on top. finally, the fig: darth maul in the flesh plastic. a good fig altogether, with a black hood and lightsaber blades taken from the ship. he did come with a crisp, new black cape (packaged in a small, white cardboard box), but i am currently using it for another fig. note that this is a limited edition fig, so stock up. a comparison pic of the two mauls: the 2007 version is on the left, and the 1999 version on the right. note a few key differences between the two: the new one has smaller red tattoos and a smoother torso. also, the new one has bigger eyes and a more cartoony look. maul on the speeder bike: of course, he fits perfectly in the cockpit wile sitting on the bike, and he can reach the controls: well, thats about it, here is the... final verdict: build: 8/10, easy and fun, breaks every once in a while. playability: 7/10, this set has many features, but is very fragile between the cockpit and hull and between the two cockpit pieces. swooshability: 1/10, too fragile to fly around, plus the flick fire missiles fall out. minifigs: 9/10, a great fig with a chrome hilt and a double sided blade. a little cartoony. design: 7/10, very clever techniques, very sleek, but very fragile. price: 8/10, fair enough, could be a few dollars cheaper. overall score: 6.5/10, a very sleek ship with clever building and play techniques, but very, very fragile, and shouldnt be picked up off of the shelf too often. and with that, my review is over, but all of yours are not: comments and thoughts very welcome!! edited by jimbutcher, 15 september 2008 - 02:59 am. indexed

0 jimbutcher, on jul 10 2008, 09:44 pm, said: a hidden compartment! now this was a very cool idea by tlg, a secret compartment found by taking off the top slope of the hull you're supposed to slide the front of the hull off, rather than lift the top piece off.

0 led zeppelin, on jul 10 2008, 04:46 pm, said: you're supposed to slide the front of the hull off, rather than lift the top piece off. yeah, i was looking at the construction booklet and it reminded me of that (i forgot about it), but that makes it more fragile.

0 nice review jim, i think i would only buy this for darth maul though you definitely showcased all the cool features really well!

0 i got this set last year. and i think you made a mistake when you have remove a piece to access the probe droids and equipment, you just have to slide the entire main part. and i have a question, is this equipped with the new flick-fire missiles that don't fall off?

0 thank you for the nice review. i like the design, although i didn't want to buy it. the new little speeder is very nice, but maybe a little to small.. darth mauls eyes are looking a bit more dangerous now.

1 hey all! so i purchased the remaining three agents sets i needed, and saw that there was no review up yet for this set! heres the first batch of parts, and the first instruction bits. the mini figures. the first small vehicles. heres a mistake that i found in the instruction booklet. there is no difference between steps 2 and 3. the team inferno boat. this is a nice chunky boat, that looks fairly heavy duty and evily. its nice to see the smooth disks on the bottom, that lego seemingly havnt done in recent boat/plane sets. and the agents submarine! this is a nice build aswell. nice and long, with a few hidden compartments. one for missiles. a place to put the treasure! some final shots of the completed set! the spare bits! another special mention has to go out to slime face. i think he is my favourite ever lego character. the detail on his unique torso is brilliant! his head is fantastic! and his costume just looks great, with the black and green (plus green is my favourite colour!) check out the back of his torso, with the slime pouring down! deep sea quest was 34.99 price ; 9/10 - this is a pretty reasonable price for a fairly substantial set. parts ; 8/10 - a lot of nice bits, few nice boats bits, and a lot of smooth disk things. minifigures ; 10/10 as i said slime face is my favourite lego character, and the details brilliant! vehicles ; 8/10 both very good, with some interesting features. build ; 8/10 a pretty fun build. overall ; 9/10 its gotta be, if just for slime face alone, but this really is a great set!

-1 i'm not real fond of slimeface. he looks too much like the joker-bombs. i was hoping for something newer. the slime printing is a nice touch though. steve

0 great review. i love that slime face !

1 thanks for review...(i hope svelt corps still reviews it ) slime is pretty cool, i knew about the torse for a while but its no less cool now

-1 great review, rezourceman! your pics really show off the sub well and it's good to see the build in progress. i also have this set but i didn't apply stickers to the sub as i was planning to reuse the nice dark blue pieces. however as shown in your review they do brighten it up a fair bit. i can't say this is my favourite agents set; the boat is a little oddly proportioned and the sub, although retro looking, has practically no interior and would be difficult to customise to put more in (unlike, say, the clever job batbrick did with the penguin sub in his review). the sub kind of looks like some jules verneish sea creature - i would have liked it if they'd gone all the way and made it some kind of giant robot jellyfish or squid i do agree with you about slime face - he has a fantastic torso with all the slime dripping down which is a bit obscured by the air tank. it's really encouraging that in the last 2 missions we've had great extra villains added in. the only thing i would add about the octopus is that the glow in the dark plastic is mixed in unevenly with the aqua blue, so it doesn't glow in the dark evenly - it's kind of like the mars mission jellies in that respect though much cooler! thanks again for the great review!

0 thanks for the review! it's great to see detailed pictures of slime face. the set looks good but not as good as some of the others in this line. great review!

0 i feel like a n00b asking, but what is the usd price? i didn't see a price in the review.

0 it was 34.99 so usd its likely to be $45-$55 i would imagine.

1 nice review, thanks! tlc is really going all-out with the agents theme. i wonder if it will last longer than one year (unlike other recent one-and-done themes). my only real criticism of the theme is those freaking stickers. my god, look at the size of that dss in this set!

0 great review!! really thanks i slime face, even slimey as my slime sense nice that break jaw is also in it! undersigned mowo

1 great review. this set totally owns alpha team deep sea. the sub design actually looks like a sub, the figures are way better, the acessories are better - everything is better! agents may have my vote for the best theme of the year. quote i wonder if it will last longer than one year (unlike other recent one-and-done themes). oh don't worry - a second wave will be coming next year. this was confirmed by both legomilk and in an interview with an agents designer.

1 i forgot to comment on this review! great job rezourceman, like svelte-corps said your pics really show off the set and what there is to it. i just ordered this and the volcano base off s@h and i can't wait for them to come, so i'll comment on these reviews i forgot about i love the inferno boat, as you say in your review it looks very heavy duty and ready to take on the agents. the sub i quite like from the look of it, though there is the problem of too little space i will try and correct that. the dark blue is especially good. and i love slime face, his torso is very cool. svelte_corps, on jul 11 2008, 09:14 am, said: i can't say this is my favourite agents set; the boat is a little oddly proportioned and the sub, although retro looking, has practically no interior and would be difficult to customise to put more in (unlike, say, the clever job batbrick did with the penguin sub in his review). wow, thanks for that little mention is it impossible or just very hard to mod? svelte_corps, on jul 11 2008, 09:14 am, said: i do agree with you about slime face - he has a fantastic torso with all the slime dripping down which is a bit obscured by the air tank. it's really encouraging that in the last 2 missions we've had great extra villains added in. the only thing i would add about the octopus is that the glow in the dark plastic is mixed in unevenly with the aqua blue, so it doesn't glow in the dark evenly - it's kind of like the mars mission jellies in that respect though much cooler! the octopus sounds great, thanks for that, is he meant to be on any side? i'm guessing he's a mutant inferno creature. about slime face, is his head much different to the joker bombs? i know he has slime marks on his head, are they very apparent? thanks again for the review! batbrick away!

0 batbrick, on jul 19 2008, 09:53 am, said: is it impossible or just very hard to mod? nothing is impossible to mod! probably the easiest part to change would be the front where the missiles are and the treasure chest slides out - you could make a sizeable compartment there. however the middle section is so narrow and the end fins are just that - fins - that it might be harder to expand without changing the shape of the sub. you'll find out soon when yours arrives! batbrick, on jul 19 2008, 09:53 am, said: the octopus sounds great, thanks for that, is he meant to be on any side? i'm guessing he's a mutant inferno creature. about slime face, is his head much different to the joker bombs? i know he has slime marks on his head, are they very apparent? it's not really clear but since all the other mutants are evil (or at least controlled by dr inferno), it's probably a safe bet the squid is too. slime face's head is different to the joker bombs - different eyes and teeth (although the smile is similar i guess) and the slime marks are much more apparent in the flesh (or abs) although they don't photograph that way. joker bomb face below for contrast:

1 wow, thanks for the review, that is one awesome set, slime face is excellent! i must add him to the collection, i think we need some new agents, there's so many inferno minifigures now... maybe next year? thanks again!

1 great looking set. and that glowy blue octopus is really cute, i might just get it for that. be great in a space moc.. wondering, from the pdf instructions i saw, it wasnt clear what the agent in the sub is sitting on, hows his seat work? and it looks like theres a compartment below him...

1 6927 all terrain vehicle year released: 1981 piece count: 167 minifigs: 2 list price: $14.50 a very unique vehicle in the classic space collection was this "all-terrain vehicle" which i always considered more along the line of a mobile lab. the set introduced/infused white and black bricks with classic blue space pieces. the result was this great classic vehicle. the set includes two figs (still red and white): here's a view of the vehicle which is really two components, the vehicle itself and the lab section: i absolutely loved the the blue windshield slopes (2 included), and the unique upside-down large blue slope: in the back of the vehicle is the blue lab: the back section of the vehicle has hinges that allow the jets sections to open: the brick design fits perfectly into the lab, and when opened, the lab falls to the ground: note: the little round trans. red 1x1s allow the lab to slide up and forward when the jet sections are closed. i tried taking off the red 1x1s and the lab does not lift as easily with them. the design is very clever, esp. for a classic set. here's a shot of the stand-alone lab: unlike earlier classic space windows, this set has train window frames with yellow windows. the top of the lab lifts up for playability: inside the lab are several computers and a swivel chair: back to the vehicle, here's a shot of the cockpit with white steering wheel: the left side has an upside-down wrench and black antenna: the right side, a walkie-talkie and another antenna. the antennas can be used as breaks to keep the middle wheels from moving: here's ashot of the under carriage: and a final shot of the complete set: for those of you following my classic space reviews, this is review number 9 of 10. my final review of an-all time favorite will be coming soon. hope you enjoyed this review. comments are always welcome.

1 give me an excuse to sneak into your house, and let me have a feel of these classic space sets. i never had a chance to have any experience with the classic space sets. through your recent reviews on these, it gave me a wider perspective of space. i loved to play space as a child such as the late classic and futuron sets. back to the review, this 6927 is a great mobile command center vehicle suitable for all kinds of harsh terrain in the unknown space. the 6 big wheels are real solid and firm back in those days. transparent blue windscreen at the front, is wonderful. i just love these parts, especially when it's in blue. 4 computer printed tiles. aren't lego so generous back in those days, when printed parts are more commonly available unlike now. it's a real nice set. however, there is one thing i don't understand about this design. why is the driver seat has a wide back with no cover behind? and, the command center has no door at the back? i understand that these space guys are always carrying their helmet around, for oxygen supply. i wonder if there is a better answer to it.

1 oh man, this review takes me back! i got this set when i was 8 years old, and loved it. i remember modding it to remove the lab in the back, and i put in a giant laser cannon instead. 'cause when you're 8 years old, everything needs a giant laser cannon. cp5670, on jul 11 2008, 12:43 am, said: the only bad thing about this set is the name. it can't even roll over a single plate's height. not very "all terrain" at all. ha! very true. the vehicle is built so low to the ground that the front end catches on everything.

0 quote great buy on this one. what did it cost you? it was $30, which was a pretty good price given the condition. it had no box or instructions though. this set is actually fairly common on ebay though, considering how old it is. i see them pretty frequently on there. quote it's a real nice set. however, there is one thing i don't understand about this design. why is the driver seat has a wide back with no cover behind? and, the command center has no door at the back? i understand that these space guys are always carrying their helmet around, for oxygen supply. i wonder if there is a better answer to it. i just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed: edited by cp5670, 11 july 2008 - 06:39 pm.

0 thebrickster, on jul 11 2008, 10:16 pm, said: yes. the extra space was probably for the oxygen tanks on the figs. it makes taking them off a lot easier. as for the lab/control center, i never had an issue with it being open. i think this was just for playability. one could always "pretend" that some sort of invisible force ray closed the side when activated. invisible force field/ray? that is a very neat idea. i don't have much problem with it either. was just curious about the design, as i am not very familar with classic space. i supposed the oxygen tanks is quite big to carry around, especially when the vehicle is so cramped. these allowance of space, makes them much mobile to move about in the vehicle. cp5670, on jul 12 2008, 02:39 am, said: i just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed: great job! thanks for sharing and answering the question i posted above. i love the way you modify the front and back. now, i need to find where is the entrance to the mobile command center.

1 i've always associated this set with 6929, the voyager. they're of the same timeframe and more or less the same style. 6927 is without any doubt my favourite ground vehicle of space. it was pretty simple, but it was such a creative set. the stories you could tell with this model... g... most defenitely in my top 5 of space sets...

1 this set never got me as a kid. i suspect it was because of the wheels; i had mostly basic sets so it would have been more of the same. looking at it now i can see i have misjudged it, and i love the lab-lift method. i'm going to have to build this to see it in action! thanks for another great review.

0 great review! all-terrain vehicle was one of my two favorite lego sets ever. i have to include a shot of the back of the box, because i love the ideas lego provided for this set: hewman, on jul 11 2008, 01:11 am, said: very nice blacktron-themed 6927! cp5670, on jul 11 2008, 01:39 pm, said: i just modified mine to make everything fully enclosed: i love your modified 6927 with the enclosed front. 2 weeks ago i modified my all-terrain vehicle as well, in a similar way, but just *slightly* more modified from the original. i call it: 6927-c 'all-terrain vehicle improved class' a few clues for anyone to easily build this themselves: also, a much more extensive modification/moc that i call 6927-w "all-terrain warrior" quote 6927-w 'all-terrain warrior' i wanted to make a combat variant of 6927, so i used the 6927-c improved class as the starting point and went from there. i added a completely new forward-cab, close to the ground, for a ground--observer to monitor the terrain. i added even larger wheels, allowing this variant to truly be "all terrain", ...besides, what good is it having a combat vehicle if it gets stuck in the middle of a firefight? the 6927-w has a five man crew: a driver, a gunner who also serves as overall-commander, a terrain observer in the very front. in the lab are the weapons systems officer and computer/tech specialist. the all-terrain warrior vehicle portion is armed with lasers and blaster cannons, with options for other weapons. there are short-range nuclear rockets on the lab, guided by the rader control. the lab now has blast-proof shutters on the windows protecting the crew from rocket blast. additional protection can be added to the lab, if-need-be, such as more extensive blast-shielding. all-in-all, the all-terrain warrior is a beast of a machine. two 6927s can protect an entire convoy of standard 6927 or 6927-c. these are my very first attempts at modification and doing a moc of classic space lego! edited by parallaxscroll, 29 august 2009 - 03:03 am.

1 awesome review brickster! i didn't you are also a space fan oh how i love classic space the all time perfect lego space related theme everytime i see one i want to buy them more and more, when compared to modern fang dangled sets with detailed figs and cool new accessories, they have nothing on classic space, simple beauty maybe its the blue/grey/trans yellow color scheme classic space forever edited by piranha, 30 august 2009 - 07:51 am.

0 wow! that brings back memories. i have that model too (in storage somewhere). the pictures are great. i will definitely be checking out more of your reviews.

1 yeah, first time that i am getting a set before everyone.^^ first of all: the package the european version has no "limited edition" button. hooray!!! sorry for the blurry back-shot. we see the hospital back, a few bubbles with set functions and a little comic. comic: bubbles: the figures are injured spongebob, patrick and the new fish doctor. spongebob has a headprint... ...and a backprint (other than the normal spongebob). spongebob and injured bob: the set comes with two litters. the ambulance car is a bit extraordinary. i dont know how the car is like in the show (and i saw a lot of episodes) but it looks a bit strange, mostly because the weehls are too small. of course we get another ss (not so d this time). the litter fits in the back, with help of this lid. i wish it would be the hinge-lid from before 2004... now we come to the meanpart of the set: the hospital! the entrance has got babyblue traindoors and a hudge sign that shows "emergency". the tubes are nearly everywhere in this set. i was getting insane when i came to the part, where i must put the stickers on the tubes. this parts are very usefull, but i wanted that the set looks good, because i will display it. so i stickered just two of the parts and not all four. now we come to the interroir: the doctor has a desk with computer. sadly its not very well placed and he must duck because of his fin. next to the door, we get this little case, wash basin and two drawers. again we get stickers... not that i dont like stickers. its just: everytime i get to the part where i must put the stickers on, i think how i can re-use the model and if i rebuild the model, later and and and... i hate it to deside! a few posters are in it, too. the set is a great addittion to your own bikino bottom, but the playability is not very big for the kids. they can just play that patrick steals the ambulance car, like shown on the package, and is hitting spongebob. than the drive back, the doctor gives spongebob two medicines and let him go. i bought the set mostly because of the parts (tubes in lightbley and a few woodpieces). but i am thinking about let it stand in my little bikini bottom (just consist of crusty crab and chum bucket). playability: 3/10 figures: 10/10 price: 8/10 design: 9/10 total: 30/40

1 thanks for the review, looks like a great set. i'm surprised that spongebob's bandage has a full body headprint so kudos to lego for that

0 oh so spongebob was the injured one. i thought this set depicted the episode wherein mr. krabs was the one rushed to the hospital.

1 i love the sponge bob sets, i have all of them! nice review.

1 thanks for the review! the interior looks nice, better than i expected, lots of great parts but, as you say, so many of them are stickered. after rocket ride, the stickers in the sb sets seem to have gone crazy - the early sets weren't slathered in them. 2 new figs though is most welcome.

0 great review. as much as i hate spongebob lego, i just might get this set. it has a good number of useful parts, like the computer and keyboard, and all of the brown pieces. how much does this set cost in usd?

0 great review! i want that set, mainly for patric and the spongebob with the bandage. but: why does bob have full length pants? i thought he wore briefs?

1 lots of yummy pics in the review thanks! hmm a double sidied minifig, with a painted top! thats the first time i have ever seen this done!?!? this is a great set and has recieved as evideneced by a lot of "is it new" questions, is sponge bob sets available in auzzi land? i have not seen them in shops... regards cpt. pb

1 how much euro did you pay for it? it looks a great set, great interior, nice figures and funny posters. :) it's also nice: the newest spongebob sets are now also available in our stores and they are the coolest (belgium)!

0 cpt. pegleg blockbeard, on jul 12 2008, 04:23 pm, said: is sponge bob sets available in auzzi land? i have not seen them in shops... regards cpt. pb generally not, although as a special sale promotion target has 3830 bikini bottom express and 3831 rocket ride available now (although the sale starts 24 july for 20% off) and k-mart briefly had the krusty krab set last year.

0 i ordered the set via s@h and it cost 34.99 in germany, 37.99 in belgium and 50$ in australia. it looks like its a exclusive set, but without the 2limited edition" sticker on the package. in the usa its not aviable, now. i think it costs as much as the rocket ride (30$). @ mrs pegleg: he has the same, short pants, like in the other sets.

1 nice review, the set looks promising.

1 thanks for the pics, this set is necessary for each spongebob-fan, it looks so great

-1 the fish doctor is supposed to have a new torso.

0 i never have buy a sponge bob set but this looks so cool so maybe... (just maybe) i will buy it . i am curious of why tlc havent done the flying dutchman ship, it was in the first rumor list of sponge bob sets, that surely will be a must .

1 the official name for this lego set is "the emergency room". i have all the other spongebob sets, including three krusty krabs, two bikini bottoms, as well as one of everything else , now all i need to do is wait until next month to buy this set if i find it at my local toys "r" us. that spongebob minifig looks cute.

1 i'm not a huge fan of spongebob, but this set i might want also have. maybe i can combine it with the city hospital.

-1 i recently bought this set for my daughters birthday. it's the first belville set that i've bought for her so it's a bit of an experiment. the house is 5 rooms and it's made up of mostly large pieces. there still is a decent amount of normal lego in it though. the doorways in the house align when it is opened out. starting with the bathroom, included is a shower, toilet, sink with vanity and a baby potty. the mirror sticker is one of the few that i put on. the open plan lounge/kitchen/dining room is well appointed as well and it has a nice glass table and coffee machine. the kitchen chairs are fabuland parts... and don't work really well. it seems they are having jellyfish for dinner! the clock is the only printed part in the set. upstairs is a baby room and the master bedroom. the radio and the tv (not shown) were stickers to my disappointment. up top is an extra room suitable for reading. (those antenna things were made from spare parts by my daughter. i have no idea what they are supposed to be... ) there are some stickers that go on the back, but i didn't put them on. as it is the set looks ok this way, but since it is a dolls house it doesn't really matter. i do think though that the fireplace should have been given a back. the bbq is made from normal parts and is quite effective. i think it uses the same light brick that's in the 4998 stegosaurus set. my kids were using it as a torch before my grumbling ruined their fun... like all belville sets, the highlight is arguably the accessories. i'll be borrowing a few of these from time to time... here is the controversial baby catapult. as you can see, it works ok, but lego probably should have tried a bit harder. we also bought for her 7583 playful puppy. it also comes with some nice accessories, but not enough to justify buying unless you want the rest of the parts. poor puppy; where does he sleep? here is my daughter assembling it. she made me make the house though as she wanted to play a game we bought her. (note the lego drink bottles! ) i didn't take any photos of the figures as they don't seem to be anything new, but i can if people want me to. at the time i was in bit of a hurry as i took these before bed so i wouldn't be stressed if the kids broke it the next day. overall, these sets seem overpriced to me, and hard to justify unless you actually want a buildable doll's house. (which we did.) it's still too early to tell if my daughter likes it or not... but at this stage it seems she lost interest in a few days. she does tend to go back to toys though. edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 07:03 pm. indexed

0 mommy and daddy are naughty!

0 yay! it's good to see your kids get to build some stuff too, sinner . all through the review i was thinking 'this was a present - but who actually put it together?' so i'm glad the last pic cleared things up as for the set - it looks much bigger than i expected - i think it does make a good sized dollhouse. there are a stack of nice pieces in there - cupboards, oven, trans-blue 2x5 bricks, all the accessories, plants, flowers, food, the light-up brick, the pink roof slopes - but not enough to justify the $aud129 retail price. maybe on sale i'd pick it up and resell the belville figs but david jones hasn't even had a regular 20% off lego sale for the whole of this year that i've seen. i think the playful puppy set is a horrendous ripoff for $aud20 though. i agree with the baby catapult - the range is terrible. lego just isn't trying any more, is it? at least they've moved on from throwing cats off three storey buildings. 2 questions though. 1) was it a fun build? 2) are those large figs anatomically correct under their frou-frou finery? if not, what the hell are they doing in the second pic whilst baby sylvia explores the oven?

1 baby catapult you say? puts a basenet to shame! top review by the way, lego drink bottles for the win! edited by mrs pegleg blockbeard, 12 july 2008 - 06:37 am.

0 i was sort of hoping for a flick-fire baby. still, this looks decent, for what it is, i guess. obviously, it really is all about the accessories, and it's got 'em, but not enough to make me spend that kind of cash, and i don't even mind having a pile of pink parts around. if you throw in a complete turkey or some birthday cakes, it's a slam dunk, but as it is... eh. thanks for the review, though, it's very nicely presented and leaves no doubt in my mind as to just how easy this set would be to misuse for other purposes.

1 nice review, good to see your almost letting your kids play with your lego i like the functionality of the baby catapult, its good that they include some working features in a build this big! are you not showing the figures because its really hugh hefners playboy/belville mansion? i dont see the grotto though, must be an add on set like the poor puppy! its just so darn pink

1 a nice review with a nice touch of sinner which made me laugh. the playfull puppy set has saussages i think i would buy a playfull puppy, it has nice pieces and the puppy can also be used for minifigs as a big dog. why haven't they not made a saussagesseller for city. maybe in the future. there are already more chickenlegs in minifigs sets.

0 hinckley, on jul 13 2008, 01:55 am, said: this reminds me of that popular tv game show in the states: identify the bucket vs. the watering pale. no one's won the million yet... i was on that, came close to winning too, but the one i picked was too well tanned. wah-wah-waaaaaah.

1 sinner!!! you know, i had never seen a belville set in any review with such great pictures before! i just can't take my eyes off, in the master bedroom. the scene is quite, a little hot. enough of me, peeping up there. let's take a look at the interior. i am very surprised by its construction of the house. it's quite big and is nice of you to buy a great sweet gift for your daughter. i am very sure, she will enjoyed playing with it. somehow, it reminded me of barbie doll products. maybe, its too pinkish for me. the accessories is the "plus factor" in any belville sets. it offered quite a handful of great accessories to add into any types of mocs construction to add in the plus factor in it. sinner, you are a very nice dad! i like how parents, buy educational toys for their children to expand their imaginations instead of sitting in a couch playing video games and etc.

1 thanks for your report and the pics, my sister wants this set, but she's already got the last house and she doesn't play very often with it, but the new one looks very good, too

0 i'm confused... the finale of big brother australia was last week. so why only now are we seeing pictures of housemates brigette and ben performing a striptease? and where is rory in his signature g-string? very odd.

1 sinner, on jul 25 2008, 09:47 pm, said: i'm still undecided on if it was a smart buy. she played with it a lot this week, but last week she ignored it... and i had to fix it twice! my daughter is 12, and she still plays with all her belville stuff (mostly the fairy princess castle sets). if your daughter is anything like mine, you will definitely get your money's worth out of it. however ... as soon as my daughter says she's done with it, i plan on raiding the sets for all those great food and accessory bits. patience .... great review, by the way. the belville sets are indeed overpriced, but they're probably lego's best attempt at wooing the girl audience (i still hate the fact that tlc thinks they need separate "boy" themes and "girl" themes, but whatever). they're a very nice alternative to barbie -- you get posable figures with realistic body proportions, plus some creativity and building aspects thrown in.

1 i bought this today, mainly because it was 25% off, but i'd been eyeing it for a long time. the accessories truly are brilliant! there's so much here to be pillaged for other uses, as people have said. i picked up heaps of new parts i've never had, or rare ones in even rarer colours. to be honest, i was surprised and impressed by the range and versatility of the regular bricks as well. when you look at the box art, what jumps out at you are the giant pink walls and curved pieces, but there's a nice amount of white arches and lime green bricks, not to mention all the windows and the trans blue 1x2x5 bricks. and plants! it's a good thing the target audience likes stickers though, there's more here than i've seen on any set except the 7709 sentai fortress! i think they were aiming for one sticker per page of instructions i hope belville returns in 2010 thanks for the review, sieggy! did your daughter ever go back to it?

0 i recognize the clock! it came with my old airport set 6392 back in 85! in fact according to peeron it mostly came out in train stations link belville looks horrible to me too barbie-ish and does not look lego at all. would prefer they went with paradisa instead.

1 7655: clone battle pack year: 2007 number of pieces: 58 number of minifigs: 4 price: 9.99 usd brickset welcome to my third review on eurobricks, i hope you enjoy! while at any store that sells lego (target, wal-mart, tru, etc.), you will notice that the clone battle packs on the shelf are way fewer in number than the droids battle pack. as you might guess, the clones are way more popular, and finding them gets harder and harder as the release date of this set goes farther into the past. so stock up! alright, heres a pic of the box: a small box, as expected for inexpensive sets like these. note the "build your army" button on the front: tlg obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples, and with good reason, which will be explained later in this review. well, lets get straight to it: the contents of this set. you will notice a speeder bike, a gun turret, and some clones. looking good so far! lets have a look at the turret: an excellent star wars element to have around, especially for mocing. it is very cleverly built, using a tire guard from city sets for the general shape of the turret mount. all you have to do is attach the (new mold! explained later) gun to the 2x1 plate with the center stud, and... presto! i wonder how the clones build these turrets to fast in the middle of battle... a rear view: with a clone mounted: my only gripe about the turret is that you have to take off the gun in order for every clone to have a gun. now, we move on to the vehicle of the set, the speeder bike: a rather sleek and good looking bike, with some useful pieces on it as well, such as the blue cones, the megaphones, and the engines. some say it looks bare without the figs mounted on it, but i think it looks just fine. the commander drives while a trooper shoots on the back. a side view: and a rear view: my only gripe is the same as the turret: you have to remove the back gun for all the clones to have weapons while on foot. the back pistol attaches to a 2x2 round studded plate with a technic hole in the middle. finnaly, here are the new guns: this set comes with 1 new blaster rifle and three new pistols. it could have included one more rifle for the turret. and of course, the figs: includes: 1 yellow commander (lovely fig), 1 shocktrooper (comes with a pair of elctrobinouculars), and two regular troopers (so clean and white). the figs are excellent, all that any sw or lego fan should want. it could have maybe included one more regular trooper, but that might be pushing it. thats all for now, folks, here is the... final verdict: build: 8/10, extremely easy, should take the seasoned builder about 5 minutes to complete. a fun build, though. playability: 5/10, i guess you can get this with the droid battle pack and make them battle, but this set has no real play features of its own. but it is good for collecting troops and using them for mocs. swooshability: 9/10, i guess you can zoom the speeder bike around... minifigs: 10/10, four great figs that should be bought in multiples, a great army builder. design: 10/10, a clever turret, an awesome speeder, and four great clones. what more do you need in a 10 dollar set? price: 8/10, not bad i suppose, but if you calculate a dime for each piece, this set should come out to 5-6 dollars. but still, billions of these are being sold world-wide, and tlg is making a ton of money off of them. overall score: 9.5/10, a truly memorable set, one that will be a favorite for ages to come, and very popular. a great army builder for a small price, plus vehicle and turret! with only a few very minor flaws, this set is one of the best of star wars. and this concludes my review, and as always, comments are most welcome.

1 nice review! i got over the gun problem with the shockie since the rebel in the y-wing doesn't need one. i wish i could have gotten more of these but i'll know for next time.

1 when i saw this topic i was like : "oh my god this set is out since 2007. this guy is so late!" but i read your review and this idea got out of my mind! thank you jim! i have 2 of these and i even have twice more droids than clones! i should have buy more but it's sold out now

1 7654: droids battle pack. year: 2007 number of pieces: 102 number of minifigs: 7 price: 9.99 usd brickset hi everybody, and welcome to my fourth review on eurobricks. today, i will review the droid bttle pack set. note: this set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid, but i replaced them (along with the crooked arms) with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms. a picture of the box: as it is on the shelves of major-retail stores. a small box, as expected for inexpensive sets like these. note the "build your army" button on the front: tlg obviously is encouraging customers to buy multiples, and with good reason, which will be explained later in this review. an overview of the set's content: you can see a droid carrying vehicle, a stap, and some battle/ super battle droids. a look at the carrier: a light tank. note the guns on the front: the guns and cockpit can turn a little bit left and right from the main body. also, the guns can move up and down, free from the cockpit: and check out the cockpit: two 2x1 center studded plates side by side for the pilot to stand on. now, moving on to the stap: a small, very useful vehicle in the sw universe. these are seen frequently in both the movies and games (as well as other multimedia). the design is very clever, using vertical building and a clear stand. rear view: the guns/ handlebars can go this far back: and finally, the figs: the figs are very good, but very common. we havent seen sbds in a while, and now instead of metallic blue, they are metallic dark grey. the worst part of this set is that the battle droids have the old arms and guns, while the droids in the mtt and clone pack (both of the same year as this) have the new ones. i wonder why tlg decided to do that... again, this set originally came with four megaphone blasters for each battle droid, but i replaced them (along with the crooked arms) with the new blaster pistols and new twisted arms. so thats about it, heres the... final verdict: build: 8/10, very easy, should take the seasoned builder about 5-10 minutes. playability: 6/10, has a few play feature, but nothing exciting. is good for mocs and army building. swooshability: 8/10, i suppose you could fly around the stap... minifigs: 7/10, the battle droids are good, but very common, and the dont come with new arms or guns. the sbds are very nice, and in a new color. all figs are great for army building. design: 8/10, the stap was clever, but the carrier was a little bulky. price: 10/10, as fair as it gets. overall: 7.5/10, the figs are great to have and make mocs and armies, and the vehicles are pretty cool (the carrier is a little lame). the main problem with this set is that the bds dont get the new guns or arms, so they dont fit in with all the new sets. also, droids arent as cool as clones. but the price is very fair. and now, my review has ended. unfortunately, i believe this will be my last review for a long time for two reasons: one, the remaining sets that arent done (according to kimt's index) i either don't have or are broken or have missing pieces. and two, my budget is low right now, and i wont be able to get the clone wars sets right when they are released, so someone will probably beat me to reviewing them. too bad, because i would love to do an rgs review... well, as always, comments very welcome!

0 thanks for the review... ...unfortunately the droid battle pack is discontinued for the uk s@h ...also the clone battle pack is discontinued for the usa s@h ( for the americans)

0 that's strange. i saw about 20 of them in my tru. anyways, nice review. i thought this set was great for armies.

0 thanks for the review. i want to add that the few parts which are contained in this set are very usable for own mocs. the rancor, on jul 12 2008, 11:11 pm, said: ...unfortunately the droid battle pack is discontinued for the uk s@h ooops - it's also not available in germany any more.

1 thanks for the review jimbutcher . i think this set is cool especially the cool redesigned stap i just it.

1 hello all eurobricks members and town lovers, this is my first classic town review. for today, i will be featuring the 6641, 4-wheelin' truck which is produced in 1987. for some younger members in eb, you might not have encounter such a baby roaming down the streets, horning at others with its big massive truck. considering this is a 1987 set, such a vehicle size is considered big in those days. name: 4-wheelin' truck theme: lego system / town year: 1987 pieces: 80 minifigs: 1 price: usd$6.50 an image of a 6641, 4-wheelin' truck *hello everyone* why the name 4-wheelin' truck? it is because this truck is equipped with 4 heavy duty wheels which is considered "big" among other small vehicles in classic town. please take note, most of the vehicles that are produced in classic town era, are 4-studs wide. this truck is no exception. meet the driver and his truck! this truck has a very good combinations of different colors that are common for most town vehicles. it made used of blue, white and red as its primary combinations. i find that this combinations is quite soothing to its eyes especially the blue bricks. in addition, the mini-fig torso is superb. the driver must be a great fan of this vehicle. i realised most truck drivers in the classic town era wear this most of the time. i wonder if its some kind of an organization? front view there is 2 red doors coupled with the truck, to enable the driver to get in properly. this vehicle is considered big in the 1980s. however, if you compared it with the current city vehicles, this truck certainly will not outsize the current designs. please take note of the wheels. the wheels are pretty different. i don't remember seeing these wheels in many other vehicles, maybe some members can help me on this. most of the classic town vehicles have a window frame on top which is known as a "sun-roof". in this set, this feature is also included. furthermore, the vehicle frame has a simple mechanism which all town lovers love. it is to lift it up and place their driver in and out the seat. most importantly, you do not have to take off the entire window frame just to put in the driver. different angles of the 4-wheelin' truck snot technique? back 20 years ago, lego had been experimenting with snot technique. you can see that the back looks very neat without the studs. in addition, it can be quite useful to place a mini-fig on top of it, or throw some baggage for some quick getaway. summary review playability: 8/10 (great addition to your town collection.) design: 8.5/10 (very good design. i love 4-studs truck. at least, it is able to occupy one side of the lane) price: 9/10 (an inexpensive set based on the 1987 pricing) overall: 8.5/10 (a must have for all classic town lovers, we have been complaining for more wider range of vehicle) i gave it a "4" based on my review score card. what about yours? hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. pictures can be found in my brickshelf (when moderated) edited by whitefang, 13 july 2008 - 12:08 pm.

0 whitefang, on jul 13 2008, 11:25 am, said: the wheels are pretty different. i don't remember seeing these wheels in many other vehicles, maybe some members can help me on this. first of all, another great review! thanks for doing these! as for the wheels, these were primarily technic wheels but did find their way into some other models. in white, i can only find a handful of minifig sets that they are included with. there's half a dozen space sets but, apart from the 4-wheelin truck, the only other town set appears to be the 6524 blizzard blazer (tractor with snow plough). the wheels were also in a train set called 4549 road & rail hauler where they were the wheels on a big forklift. cheers rog

1 love this set! nice review also.. i had the set in my hands a few times but never bought it, though i drooled at it, i remember. i guess i didn't get pocket money at that time, it was not that common around europe in the 80s i guess. so better to say that no one bought it for me.. a few years later i got the safari truck, which is also really sweet. i like the colors of this model and the detail of it. the minifig is really classic, made only for this set (appears in some later train sets as well) and shows the exact image of the truck on the shirt, including the motor piece. one of the most detailed and loveliest little sets from a sweet era of legoland city! ps voted "o" for outstanding. edited by zzz, 14 july 2008 - 09:50 am.

1 dear afol friends, due to leakage of production plant in our country one member of our lego club had bought a new promo set. until now he placed only photo of the box, later on promissed to make a review. heavenly god, i wanna one at all costs! most were found here... edited by sinner, 17 july 2008 - 12:47 am. put photos in

1 wow! oh set 4999, how do i love thee, let me count the ways: 1)an attractive cottage 2)a usefull service van 3)great parts including green burps! 4)responsible energy for my lego town! this would be the perfect addition to my seaside village. by the way, what is vestas?

1 o....m.... g!!!!!!! that looks sweet! how much did he say it was?

1 wow, it does look really cool. i love that...oops! it's gone. can't post pics of that yet, sorry. it was requested that we remove those pics. sorry everyone. have a nice day.

0 i wish i had seen it.... judging by the reactions it is a pretty good set!

1 i had saw the earlier image just now. it looks very nice. just to share some information with you guys. vestas, an global company which is an expert in "wind energy" this is a tie-up with lego. i feel its an illustration on how our world will benefit by applying and believing its technology to make use of re-useable natural resources. hinckley, is it ok for me to share a picture or two on the vestas exhibition that happened few months ago in singapore? don't worry, it's not anything related "directly" to the vestas promo, wind power plant.

1 it would appear that lego wants this beauty kept a secret...=p anywho, this is amazing. i found pics...somewhere...and...oh wow. this thing is a must-have, and i'll be saddened so much if i can't find it anywhere. i doubt they'd keep a set like this promo, though. those parts are great for town fans, castle fans, space fans...you name it, that set could be useful for it. ohhh goodness... ~trexxen, who is blown away by this amazing set...

1 omg! omg! wow! that's simply amazing. wow! i can't say more... wait, i can. this is such a beatiful set. i sure hope it will be available for us to, like european people. it's so nice. it looks like the real thing, great cottage, great pieces, great van and figures. and the windthing. wow!

0 god save the save as-function

1 wow! i searched on brickshelf and saw pictures that is just amazing! i can only imagine the cost though. will it be on s@h? or will it be sold elsewhere? cant wait! -darthperson edit: heh, see those cool little chairs on the patio made of the city mudguards? edited by darthperson, 14 july 2008 - 05:58 pm.

0 sounds cool but i can't seem to find any of these leaked pics, not even on brickshelf. maybe i am not searching under the right phrases. oh well. i guess i can wait patiently.

0 wow! managed to find a pic on brickshelf and this is a great set. hope it going to be released properly and not just a promo. one thing though, would it not be quite noisy if you lived in that house

0 that sounds amazing! a wind power plant as a lego set is absolutely awesome and helps the lego city to get environmental energy. regrettably i missed the pics. when browsing through bs i didn't find them, too . can someone please post a link or sent me the link/picture via pm ? thanks. klaus-dieter

1 filefolders, on jul 14 2008, 07:29 pm, said: what's so great about the cottage? i do agree that the generator and van are teh pwnzorz. i think the great thing about the cottage is its very reminiscent of classic holiday home type houses that lego used to make like this one from the late 80s which a lot of people (me included) believe lego need to make more of.

0 i now found pics, too. that's absolutely ! after 10188 town plan this is the best city set ever! i really like the neat landscape with the little hill (there are a bench and some flowers on it, too ) and this brilliant cottage ! great idea with that power function that the wind mill turns and then enable the lights of the cottage ! concerning the city theme i must say: in the last time tlg comes up with one great surprise after the other. does anyone know where and when it'll be available (this year i think - otherwise there wouldn't be already pics, would they?) and how much it'll cost (i think about 70 euros, what do you think?)? i only hope that it'll be available in germany, too, otherwise i would be really if i am not able to get it since it is a must for every city and environment fan! klaus-dieter edited by klaus-dieter, 14 july 2008 - 06:49 pm.

0 i also found the pics, and most of what i can say is: it's kind of funny how it's a small house with a gigantic windmill over it, though.

0 ok guys, respect tlc? crazy policy (they dont take care about thiefs selling those sets long before official release,but they complain about one small photo on web ). if someone still needs photo, simply email me on josefzizka@post.cz, i will be glad to send you three pictures

1 i recently got a few still sealed and new sets from the 90' on ebay, and after the rock raider's hover scout this isthe second one i'll review. i really like the space port theme, even if the sets may be more simple than earlier space city sets, i like the overall look and the color scheme. but enough of that, let's go on with the pictures! set nr.: 6455 name: space simulation station number of minifigs: 3 number of pieces: 240 release year: 1999 first again a few pics of the boxes and the instructions: the main box: this theme had a kinda strange seperation of the pieces, the parts for the control center and the shuttle are in seperate little boxes, and the others are in polybags with the models printed on them. also seperate instructions for each step: a general overview: we got 3 lovely minifigs here, from left to right the control engineer, the mechanic and the astronaut: the -i dont know the english word for it- testing-thing, the astronaut is being tested to hard nerves there the mechanics little car, on the back an extinguisher and a radio device is attached: the take-off station for the little shuttle with the shuttle itself on it: and without it: tools, tools, tools! the shuttle as stand-alone: i think that would be fuel tanks, i like this little detail: and finally we have the controll room, would have been better with seats, but it's alright: a really sweet mid-sized set if you ask me, a few juniorized parts, but it fits perfectly with the set. the theme itself is also great, and i wish that tlg brings it back, i could see stunning sets with the quality city sets have right now!

1 you just bring memory's back i never had one of the space port sets, but i know that as a little boy i visited my toy store and kept on looking to the boxes. on bl those sets cost too much for what ist worth today. really, tlc should bring this theme back! space port on!

1 i got this set for christmas, and you gave me the feeling for wanting to build it again. thanks for the review!

1 my sister got this from our grandparents once when she was interested with space but it fell into my hands later. i had a lot of fun with that. by the way, the name for the test thing is called a centrifuge. it tests a person's ability to withstand high g-forces. edited by filefolders, 15 july 2008 - 03:55 pm.

1 *mini-bump* wow, i'd completely forgotten about this theme, which is suprising since i absolutely loved this theme as a kid (minus the sound n' light brick, which i thought was pretty big and ugly). sure brings back memories of looking at those little catalogue booklets that came with the sets.

0 wow!!!! i'm just surprised...i thought these were all street dated for the 26th of july. at least that's what i read according to lucas information. oh well, gratz on getin one of the new sets. i'm looking forward to seeing the droid gunship and the twilight real, real, real soon!

1 the figs they're possibly the best part of the entire set, all in all. nice new head, although the glasses limit its usability. i am in love with the head on that fig. it's perfect for any number of figures - a good 'scarred hero' face has always been on my want list. i'm turning him into my viking warlord after i post this review. again, a new head. great stubbly beard thing going on. my second-favorite head of the lot. great for warriors, especially with helms. the torsos are fantastic for special forces figures, if anyone's planning to do something like that. not too fond of the lime green on there, but it's still extremely usable. this is actually a really cool machine gun. i like it. i think this would be a good point to note that all designs you see - outside the figures and dinos - are stickers. that means a crapload of stickers. if you can't stand stickers at all in a set, don't buy this.

1 the copter this is one bigass copter. the photos really don't do the size justice. lower cockpit with cool computer. too bad it's a sticker, although i'll definitely leave this one on. upper cockpit with cool computer. see above. awesome gatling gun. yes, even the technic beams have stickers. i'm actually really fond of that little canister thing. i can see using it elsewhere. yes - that's a sticker. the rope and hook. i forgot to mention it before, this set comes with two accessories besides the machine gun - binocs and one of those little things to slide down the rope. also, the thing that 'extends' the rope turns. the other side, because they're slightly asymmetrical. one of my favorite stickers. the door says 'survival equipment'. it's on both sides. definitely a keeper.

1 the base of the propeller. it wobbles a bit, but doesn't fall off. very sturdy. right side of the rear propeller. and the left (and better) side. the tail. it uses construction similar to the x-wing's nose, but on a larger scale. definitely cool. a very neat part of the copter. the guns are constructed so that... ... they turn without turning the cockpit. the interior is rather blase, though.

1 i really want those figs.....damm you bloody jay!!!

1 thanks, bloody_jay. another brilliant review. i really like the helicopter. though i hate the stickers (it seem like there are a lot of it), it won't stop me from buying it. too bad that when will the dino line arrive in singapore. . . :'( guess i've have to wait for the meanwhile.

1 that looks like a really great set, although i don't think i'd have anywhere to put it. i don't think i'll ever be able to get the set anyway, since it doesn't come out over here.

0 hmmmm . . . . interesting. it's a shame though, because i really like the guns. any idea when it should come to europe? edit: i've just scene the official dino attack site, which says they're coming to europe in october.

0 photos are not available, but basically it is: -guns +chains +ropes +crates

1 wow, great review, for a great set. thanks jay. i really like it, although to big for my city. :( i too really like the mfs. because of your review, i am definitely considering it. thanks again, legobmw.

1 that's interesting news about the european release. i'd definitely be interested to see how they modify the set - chains, ropes, and crates are definitely useful pieces. can't wait for pictures. to everyone looking for just the figures - don't skip out and get the smaller set and the tank. spend the extra $20 and get the t1. it's well worth it. i might pick up the steel sprinter and the fire hammer myself, still trying to decide. if i do, i'll review them.

0 i guess we'll have to wait for the photos! officially announced by lego, the dino attack line is going to be made available in europe in october 2005... edit: check out the official dino attack site here!

1 the... weapon. whatever it's called. this uses the same mechanism as the longboat (for those that don't have either, you snap the little sports stand thing, which hits the 'missile', which fires, and since there's nothing holding the technic beam up to that height any more, it drops down so that the next missile drops into place. pretty cool, if unrealistic.). the two on the side do not fire, i think they're mainly there for 'extra ammo'. my biggest problem with this set. open bed. this could have easily been remedied with a few plates. interior opened. the fire hammer next to the t1. they look very cool together, don't they? you can also see my curio shelf. final score: 7.4/10 dinos: 1/10 fig: 8/10 (but that's just me) hummer: 8.5/10 parts: 9/10 i'm a harsh reviewer. i still think that if space/vehicles are your thing, you should buy this. however, if you're a bigger castle fan, or just like to get all sorts of lego, i would still suggest buying the viking catapult before this. however, i do think that these are some of the coolest sets of 2005. this is something you will eventually want to get. until next time, bloody jay

0 thanks bloody jay! any chance you could be reviewing the other dino attack sets?

0 mr. lego_bildur, on jul 25 2005, 10:11 pm, said: thanks bloody jay! any chance you could be reviewing the other dino attack sets? possibly the steel sprinter and urban avenger, but i can say with finality that i will not buy the tank until i find it available for $30 or less. on that note, if anybody does find it for $30 or less, shoot me a pm. ;)

0 mr. lego_bildur, on jul 25 2005, 10:53 pm, said: sorry for the double post, but i just had another question in mind: how long/high/wide is this "badass" copter? (including rotors). have have heard of as long as 25 inches for the length, but is this true or is it just an exaggeration? 25" long, and the rotors are 10" long each (making it 20" wide). hope that helps!

1 wow, i think this is the first time i'm the first to have a new set (at least here) and review it. got it 2 days ago, thanks to a fast shipping from s@h this time, and i found time now to review it now. enough of the babbling, let's let the facts and pictures speak, which actually turned out pretty well this time. set nr.: 4210 name: coast guard platform number of minifigs: 4 number of pieces: 469 release year: 2008 a few shots of the box first: 2 books of instructions we got here, first one for the helicopter second one for the rest and the platform itself: a general overview of the platform from above: the 4 minifigs, 3 rescue guys and one oil rig worker (?). the pilot seems not very happy that he has to work in the middle of nowhere at sea right beside the entry of the tower we have the diving equipment holder: next, the guy can jump in this little speedboat... ...and another guy brings it down to water with the crane: if somebody is rescued from the air, he arrives here and is brought to the tower with the little moving platform than runs on "rails": down under we got a buoy and several life belts and extinguishers: with the lift somebody who is rescued by the boat can be brought up. i think it would been better if they would have made a mechanism there to bring it up, but it's okay: a few floors higher the sea is being observated and watched: on the ground level we have the medical station/warm-up room: the helicopter as stand-alone: all in all for me this is besides the police station the city set of this year. it's got great features, and looks fantastic and also has many useful pieces. you can't do anything wrong with buying it, 10/10 for me! that's all for now, hope you liked my review. edit: oh damn, i forgot to write "review" in the topic title, can a mod please add this? thanks!

1 i love this set... and i wish i thought of the bridge piece idea! the only part i don't like is the lift... thanks for the great review. metalandi, on jul 18 2008, 06:53 pm, said: edit: oh damn, i forgot to write "review" in the topic title, can a mod please add this? thanks! done!

1 thanks for the awesome review, metalandi! your pics are very clear and you go into detail about all the functions of the set. i agree, this is a great set - one of the best of the cg line for sure, way better than the boat set with the tower on the bionicle baseplate, and cheaper too. i even like the helicopter better than the oversized version. lots of great parts and a really nice build by the looks of it too. i can't wait for this to be released in oz!

0 seeing the pictures in this review certainly reinforce my original thoughts on this set: here's an oil-rig mod waiting to happen...

1 very nice review and nice set to boot. lots of little features that increase the playability. great pics too (i remember you had trouble before with the tower raid castle set, as i just got mine and was looking to review it, but saw your review in archives.....shakes fist at how slow aussies get sets ) great reviews on!

1 good review ;) i will buy it this year :)

1 great set and great parts pack as well! i guess im gonna buy this when its on sale, just for the orange parts. excellent for exo force

1 thanks for the great review. i'm loving this set a lot - it looks well designed, and the helicopter is awesome! plus, i love the new worker figure with the beard. quote i agree, this is a great set - one of the best of the cg line for sure, way better than the boat set with the tower on the bionicle baseplate i wouldn't say that at all - true, this base is bigger, but the other set was well designed as well - plus the included boat is wonderful.

0 metalandi, on jul 19 2008, 01:28 am, said: i don't know really. in which country do you live? i haven't been to my local stores for a while now, so i don't know if they have it there, but maybe i'll find some time tomorrow to check it out. heh, i live in japan (probably the only one here who does), so i don't have s@h at all. if s@h us or canada had it (which they don't), i could probably get it forwarded.

1 i think it looks good on the real set. i thought, the darker glass might be good on the ground level so the rescued guy has it nice and dark in there

1 nice review! this is just the "crown jewel" for the coast guard theme. i love the layout of its platform. it looks real neat to have it placed it in the midst of the deep blue sea, awaiting of any emergency rescue. sometimes, i feel that this set can used it to merge with my aqua raiders sets. i thought of using it as a land base, for the raiders to dock in their stuff before submerge into the ocean. ok, it's just a wierd idea of mine. just feel that aqua raiders and coast guard can work hand in hand, since they are naval expertise! it seemed, i can't view all the pictures somehow. nevertheless, i can still view some of it quite well. i love the command center. the amount of computer printed pieces simply make me smile, with the monitor, keyboard, radar screen and etc. the helicopter is cute too. however, i pity the victim that is loaded at the back. it seemed a little bit too dangerous. in addition, this set seemed to have quite alot of stickers, which can be quite discouraging. i do hope to see this set soon. so far, i quite like the current coast guard sets.

0 i agree with both of you. first, i have to add, that a few of the stickers were a bit annoying as it comes to put them on espacially the ones on the helicopter, where you have to put them on round parts. but i didn't really see this at a bad point, i really can live with it. second, it was a very hard decision, believe it or not, on which new set to buy, cause i got a huge 2008 set-wantlist. i guess it'll take some time before i can get most of the other sets i want

0 tenorikuma, on jul 19 2008, 08:26 pm, said: sorry, i mean physical retail stores (toys-r-us, etc.) as opposed to online stores (like shop@home). can you walk into a shop in brisbane and buy this set off the shelf? if so, i'll get my wife to buy me one when she visits the land down under next month. well some sets [this cg platform is one of them] a store exclusive to toys r us but most cg and all other lego can be found in shops like target, bigw, kmart, myer, mr.toys toy world & david jones & then there is toys r us of course but they are usualy abit more expensive then other retailers but they usualy have the exclusive sets like this one. and its funny you are from japan because i'am going there in september with my dad [he's a missionary] and i was wondering where i can find lego in japan since i have not been to japan since 2001 and i was not into lego much then. im sure you guys have a toys r us right?

1 that's a great review of a great city set! thank you very much, metalandi! first of all i wanted to buy the 7999 cg petrol boat & tower. but now i surely will buy this amazing platform instead of the 7999 if my local toy seller sells the 4210. reason: 4210 is something very unusual set (i think we won't get a set similar to that in the next 20 years) and because of i don't like the petrol boat inside (no backwalls , nearly no interior ). klaus-dieter

0 thanks a lot for the review, brickster! i never had the chance to get some classic town sets, but i wish i couldve! i just wonder why lego cant release sets like this anymore....

1 paramedic unit, does not seem to suit well for this set's name. it should be named as clinic, outpatient treatment, family doctor and etc. from what i understand, parmedic unit, is a stand-alone unit, that is on standby, 24/7, ready for any emergency rescue in lego town. ambulance, with a group of paramedics will be ideal for this kind of situation. i love female doctors, especially with that lovely hairpiece! the cruiser, is a neat 4-studs wide design. just love these small car designs back then. i wonder what can be used at the back of its boot. the clinic is neat. maybe, we can send holodoc for some medical audit, to make sure that this clinic is up to standard. what surprised me the most, is the neat little eye chart. you don't see such details in any regular lego set. the red and white color combination for the building, works well for me. most of the hospital buildings and vehicles, always revolved in red and white. i gave this a "4" thanks you so much, brickster!

0 thebrickster, on jul 19 2008, 02:30 am, said: i just can't believe someone would rate this set a 1. it appears to be a trend among these classic reviews, never with a comment of why. maybe a tfol... it is our "destiny" to show them that lego existed before 1997 and was -imho- way better than today. we need more classic reviews. i hope i can continue with technic sets.

0 people giving this "1"? g... i'd give it a "4". i'd give it a "3" but added a point out of nostalgia... i think it's a nice town set from the old days. the only problem i always had is the lack of an ambulance... and we got a female doctor! :-)

1 gave it a 4. it's not exactly town plan, but it's above average.

0 whitefang, on jul 18 2008, 09:11 pm, said: paramedic unit, does not seem to suit well for this set's name. it should be named as clinic, outpatient treatment, family doctor and etc. the definition of a paramedic is "...someone who assists physicians in providing medical care..." i think in more modern times a paramedic is generally thought of as a more qualified and experienced ambulance technician but the dictionary definition would seem to fit with the lego model quite well. cheers rog

1 i like this set, like most i view it more as a clinic, it sits nicely in my town plan. these old sets are all very cool

0 wow! old thread. just for the record, so long as it is here. paramedic's are advanced ambulance technicians. unlike standard emt's they are trained for advanced cardiac life support. they can push drugs, defibrillate, place a breathing tube etc. in the 1980's when the set was made, it was quite common for paramedics to respond to calls in "fly cars" or special response units. they would join up with ambulances at the scenes that required their skills. if you ever watched the old american tv show "emergency", johnny gage and squad 51 were one of these response units. they were mostly phased out in the 90's in favor of simply putting the paramedics and als gear in the ambulances.

0 hello all eurobricks members and town lovers, today, i will be doing up a review on hook & haul wrecker. this name is quite wierd to me. i will prefer to call it the regular tow truck. this is one of the service and repair vehicle that are always ready 24/7 on stand-by for any emergency towing in our towns. name: hook & haul wrecker theme: lego system / town year: 1989 pieces: 44 minifigs: 1 price: usd$6.00 an image of a 6660, hook & haul wrecker let the towing begins hook & haul wrecker is the typical 4-studs wide vehicle that takes care of broken vehicles that is left stranded on the roads. this tow truck is pretty useful. as you can see, current city sets hardly have any tow trucks available to tow new cars design. this tow truck is catered for 4-studs vehicles for classic town. can you imagine yourself this truck towing a speed racer car? i think it looks really out of proportion. in addition, the mini-fig which is included in this set has the regular truck print on its torso. i am very sure they must be a fan club for "trucks". otherwise, they should really need a change of clothes. nevertheless, in my honest opnion. i really love this torso very much. somehow, it makes them look tough even though their face looks very friendly. side view this vehicle has a combination of two primary colors which is white and red. this color combination looks very good. you cannot mistook it for an ambulance since they made use of this two colors too, in most emergency vehicles. this is my guess, i supposed the designer will have tow truck concept as a form of emergency and considered red and white as its combinations. this vehicle set-up has the typical sun-screen on the top of the vehicle frame. however, this baby has more unique features installed in it. these are the source of its brutal strength all-terrain vehicle??? this tow truck equipped with the best wheels. in fact, these wheels offer suspension on the roads. even when its travelling uphill, the truck will move accordingly with its tyres. when you act pressure on the top of the vehicle, it will either be shifted leftwards or rightwards. close-up of these unique tyres take a careful look. these wheels have springs installed in it. that is the magic of these vehicle and is defintely suited to run on any rough roads with least problems. if any eb members know which other vehicles has this unique features, please highlight it to me. because, if i remembered correctly. i only remember seeing this pair of tyres in this great set. he is ready for some serious towing. the driver had finished hook up the pizza van on its back. it's pretty simple. you just have to lift the back of the vehicle and placed it onto the hook. presto, the van is ready to go. this vehicle provides so much fun. you can really tow any 4-studs vehicle in your town. and, here we go! to the service station. poor pizza guy. summary review playability: 10/10 (superb fun. you will love to use this truck and tow any vehicles) design: 9.5/10 (excellent design. especially with the use of the suspension tyres) price: 9/10 (an inexpensive set based on the 1989 pricing. this set is made up of less than 100 pieces) overall: 9.5/10 (every town must need a tow truck. if a vehicle breaks down, whom will be ready to tow?) i gave it a "5" based on my review score card. what about yours? hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my brickshelf(when moderated)

1 i rate this a 5! one of my last sets before my dark age. suspension wheels are superb and are rare! the minifig, although smiling, really looks tough because of the tanktop. oh did i say im giving it a 5?

1 another great review, whitefang. this is a wonderful 80's vehicle - and i think it might be one of the first - if not the first - that had the spring suspension system. i know of at least one other set that had that: the biggest extreme team set from 1998 had a vehicle with those pieces. quote this tow truck is pretty useful. as you can see, current city sets hardly have any tow trucks available to tow new cars design. this tow truck is catered for 4-studs vehicles for classic town. can you imagine yourself this truck towing a speed racer car? i think it looks really out of proportion. firstly, speed racer cars are out of scale even with city vehicles. also, i have hope that in the next few years we will get more octan sets to go with the wonderful gas station - and i suspect that a 6-wide tow truck will be at the top of the list. it wouldn't be a hard set to make, and i bet it would sell well. edited by grevious, 19 july 2008 - 05:31 pm.

0 oh! never seen that set before! fun and strange that wheel supension system. has it ever been used in any other sets?

0 indeed they have; they've appeared in 15 different sets, in total. they also have an identical width with the wide 2x2 wheels holder which is used on cars today. they are still excellent today, since retrofitting these suspension parts onto today's off-roader trucks won't give them weird proportions or any problems, and it looks perfect. plus they are useful if you're lazy and don't feel like constructing the pin-suspension used in the early 90's for truck-trailers, altough stability probably will suffer.

1 4/5. i've had this set since i was young. never understood why a tow truck needed to be an off-roader; maybe it was used to tow the other off-road vehicles. the suspension made the truck too tall to tow some cars, so i often took the hook out and use the truck as just an great off-road truck like 6672 (which also had the suspension wheels). other tow truck sets better filled their roles better, but that doesn't diminish this set at all. whitefang, on jul 18 2008, 09:19 am, said: i think it looks really out of proportion. no, for 25-odd years this vehicle was perfectly proportioned with all others in the town/city line. it's all these new 6 and 8 and 20 wide vehicles that are ignoring convention and making it look out of proportion. granted speed racer sets are more of their own line, but 6660 is smaller than most of the cars produced in the last few years.

1 cheers for taking the time to put together this review, whitefang. considering the year of release of this set, i love it. would still fit in nicely in any city.

0 three cheers to classic town trucks! it felt nostalgic to see this appearing at the surface after seven years. time really flies and may classic town continue to be close in fellow townies' hearts.

1 u took me long way back in memory. thank you as it was a great memories with legos edited by vintagelegoera, 04 august 2015 - 07:04 pm.

1 cool set i really loved the classic town sets. this set has lots of detail, great reveiw. do you know what is exxon?

1 skipper 24, on jul 19 2008, 07:25 am, said: cool set i really loved the classic town sets. this set has lots of detail, great reveiw. do you know what is exxon? thanks skipper. exxon is a big fuel company here in the us. there's a lot of exxon gas stations throughout the country.

1 great review of a classic set. man, this is sure a wondeful kit, even today. the level of detail is astounding for the time, and the whole kit is really cute. you know, i honestly don't get why some people have complained about the city gas station's figure count - the majority of lego gas stations had no more than three figures - including this one and the wonderful gas and wash express (which i actually own!). i also don't get why people complain about the stickers so much - because even older kits often had a lot. personally, i think stickers are okay, because printed pieces can't be used in as many places if the stickers are really specialized.

1 i love this set, it's nice and simple. maybe it's because i build this set by myself by ordering all parts and buildinginstruction. and i made one extra tanktransporter :

1 brickster you need your own sticky review section, i love looking at all of these old sets, as i have said before you take me back to a much simpler time. thank you and on to the set. i love this gas station lego really needs to look to it's past on some of these sets for the time the level of detail is great. i wish i still had this one in one piece as well.

1 okay guys, i have built the set! so let's review! set name: 7649 mt-201 ultra drill walker price: $69.99 pieces: 759 bought from: tor r us in michigan, us. the box: first we have the front. it shows the set, it's functuns, and the limited edition sign. the box is huge, about the size of the dino attack chopper set or the mars mission base. nowadays, most set that are $50.00 or more have a flap displaying the sets functions. opening theflap on this box reveals a gigantic picture of the set. and the back. the bags, numbered: next, the manuals. they have piece call outs, page numbers, etc. there are 2 manuals with this set. sticker sheets: they actually aren't all that bad. random manual image: build: first, we open bag 1. this will build the alien craft and the minifigures. now here we have some interesting parts. a green spine from exo-force, and a black rim for the set container stacker. next we start the build on the alien craft. it is pretty sturbdy, but has no cockpit for the alien. the alien stickers are really cool. they are rainbow-ish, and has a silver back. next come the build on the wings: and the finished craft. it is pretty good, and has a nice sleek design. however, i think i will use the large ship for the commander out this year to fight the driller instead. next is bag 2, which builds the rover and astro ship. first is the ship. it starts off with doctor inferno's colors. it builds up very nice, and the detail is absolutley amazing. next the roof is built. it has some speed racer slopes. the hinge piee now has a hole through it. sorry for the blurry pic: more is added: then comes the bottom piece. the detail is very nice, and the hinge piece has a use later on. then you build the crates. each one holds two crystals. added to the ship, also a pic of the finished ship. here we start the rover. it sports anice detail- the orange studs get coveded by the grill to look more like an engine. the detail in this thing is pretty good. it has a gun and shovel. here is how it fits into the ship: it slides in... and is secured thanks to the hinge. okay, so next we open the number 3 bag, which builds the body. here are some interesting pieces: then we start the build. it begins nice and study: i just love these stickers with the bulldogs on them: more of the build, with the stickers added: next we add in the front part. the detail is again, outstanding. with the turntable added. it can move down as well. the next step is to build the water tank. it utilizes the bionicle boosters(big white things) and added to the walker: then we build that drill. it uses a lot of rims and such. with the gears added: the front part uses a lot of those new droideka 3-prong things. and bionicle eyes. the drill can spin thanks to the gears. and added to the vehical: next is the cockpit. it has a nice space for the astro's bckpack. added: the final stage is the legs. thank god they aren't like striking venoms. they are all the same, however. see those two rubber parts? those keep it in place when on surfaces like glass. next come the large part of the legs. these are similar to the assault tiger's legs. the final result is very sturdy, thanks too... notice the amazing classic space sticker? so we finally come down to this: the final result is amazing. it is sturdy, and has great detail. it is very realistic. and, when the ship is removed, the drill goes down, and the turret is aimed up... hope you all enjoyed the review!

1 i can't wait, that thing looks amazing. also, the new lego idol episode i told you about a few weeks ago is up. edited by cyclone titan, 19 july 2008 - 06:02 pm.

1 best mars mission set ever deserves a great review. :d

1 wow! this is a great mm set! and i wouldn't say that, but wow! this looks awesome. it's not the theme i really want, but if i get this set by accident ( ) i won't mind! hope to see your review soon.

0 anyone know the us release date?

1 wonderful review. i'd die if i had to upload that many pictures... man, this is it: the pinacle of mars mission's second and final year. man, this baby is flawless. there are so many indications that the designers took care in designing this kit - like the space for the pilot's backpack, the compartment for the mini flier, the sturdy leg design - etc etc etc. kudos to tlc for making mars mission go out with a bang. i have high hopes that whereever the space theme goes next year, tlc will make it worth the wait. edited by grevious, 20 july 2008 - 05:43 pm.

1 is it seriously? this set was a must-buy for me in the first place, but now that i see it in so much detail, it's just perfect... even the alien ship is better than usual. i love the scooter that flies out of the escape pod, the backpacks, bulldog stickers, and water tank. :d i'll be getting this one! space fans unite!

1 nice review! i really want this set, but i love most mars mission sets so it shouldn't be a surprise! it's great to see a good driller at last. iamded, on jul 20 2008, 02:36 pm, said: anyway, i don't normally like it when people make a topic to say they'll review a set soon, but i'll let you off since this is one of the few mars mission sets i really like, and i'm glad to know somebody has the set and will be reviewing it. ~peace i feel the same way... we have been considering closing topics like this. in ~vbbn~'s defense, he was fast.

1 ok, minus ten for the placeholder, but plus about ten million for the review. this set is just amazing. it's really earned it's colors, and i'm sure no classic space fan can complain, even snefroe . i didn't know it had the tilting function for the drill- s@h is so pathetic with its pictures, and they really missed this amazing function. the detachable ship is so cute, it's almost classic space in it's design. major thumbs up to tlc. hell, make it a hug, even.

0 this review should be put on the front page!

0 algernon, on jul 21 2008, 01:36 pm, said: this review should be put on the front page! i agree. i told him that if nothing more exciting turned up i would... and thus i have.

1 excellent review, it's a great set, i really love the look of the little ship. would it be possible to get some walking pictures of the walker?

1 wooha! i thought i never would see a nice mars mission set, but this walker ist the best proof i was wrong. it really looks good and i love the bricks used to make the shape. the airtank is cool and for once i have to say even the stickers are looking good. man, did i really say that? normally i hate stickers. nice review (some pictures would have gotten better with macro on, but as it seems to be time to forgive i wont point on that any longer) thank you very much vbbn!

1 holy brick! i just love the water tank and those legs are soooo cool! i dont think i have enough cash to buy after the star wars release...yikes...! thanks vbbn,for a super review!

1 grevious, on jul 20 2008, 12:43 pm, said: wonderful review. i'd die if i had to upload that many pictures... man, this is it: the pinacle of mars mission's second and final year. man, this baby is flawless. there are so many indications that the designers took care in designing this kit - like the space for the pilot's backpack, the compartment for the mini flier, the sturdy leg design - etc etc etc. kudos to tlc for making mars mission go out with a bang. i have high hopes that whereever the space theme goes next year, tlc will make it worth the wait. thanks! and yes, it took me half an hour just to resize them, and an hour to upload them to brickshelf. algernon, on jul 20 2008, 01:09 pm, said: is it seriously? this set was a must-buy for me in the first place, but now that i see it in so much detail, it's just perfect... even the alien ship is better than usual. i love the scooter that flies out of the escape pod, the backpacks, bulldog stickers, and water tank. :d i'll be getting this one! space fans unite! ah, very good! and the detail is truley a part in this set. the water tank is actualy pretty nice. sinner, on jul 20 2008, 07:29 pm, said: nice review! i really want this set, but i love most mars mission sets so it shouldn't be a surprise! it's great to see a good driller at last. i feel the same way... we have been considering closing topics like this. in ~vbbn~'s defense, he was fast. thanks! mr. mandalorian, on jul 20 2008, 08:17 pm, said: ok, minus ten for the placeholder, but plus about ten million for the review. this set is just amazing. it's really earned it's colors, and i'm sure no classic space fan can complain, even snefroe . i didn't know it had the tilting function for the drill- s@h is so pathetic with its pictures, and they really missed this amazing function. the detachable ship is so cute, it's almost classic space in it's design. major thumbs up to tlc. hell, make it a hug, even. lol, thanks. i just wanted to claim my place for the review. however from the looks of it, only me and another member have this set. sinner, on jul 21 2008, 02:52 am, said: i agree. i told him that if nothing more exciting turned up i would... and thus i have. thanks! cardinal brick, on jul 21 2008, 02:55 am, said: excellent review, it's a great set, i really love the look of the little ship. would it be possible to get some walking pictures of the walker? thanks! and sure. i shall have them up tonight. holodoc, on jul 21 2008, 03:08 am, said: wooha! i thought i never would see a nice mars mission set, but this walker ist the best proof i was wrong. it really looks good and i love the bricks used to make the shape. the airtank is cool and for once i have to say even the stickers are looking good. man, did i really say that? normally i hate stickers. nice review (some pictures would have gotten better with macro on, but as it seems to be time to forgive i wont point on that any longer) thank you very much vbbn! thanks! and i keep forgetting to put on macro... i really need to. gloriusshadow, on jul 21 2008, 05:48 am, said: holy brick! i just love the water tank and those legs are soooo cool! i dont think i have enough cash to buy after the star wars release...yikes...! thanks vbbn,for a super review! welcome! few things: build time: 3.0 hours and my favorite stickers of the set...

-1 nice review! i don't mind the set, but, at the same time, i'm not particularly fond of it.

1 i don't like mars mission sets but this one is just spectacular! it is beautiful! i must have this set, even if it means selling my kidney! i only have one mars mission set, the etx alien mothership assault, which is okay. but this set blows my mind! two thumbs up!

1 looks like a great set, i may consider making this the first mars mission set i buy. nice review also. but quote lol, thanks. i just wanted to claim my place for the review. personally i don't think you had a place to claim. somebody else could have also gotten this set and had a proper review ready before yours but felt it was wrong to post because you had posted a placeholder ( clubninja in this case). i think placeholders should be banned and if you are not ready to post a full review you should not post anything. simple really. either that or what is the policy on here regarding more than one review of a set being posted - then you could have both posted reviews and it wont really matter i guess. just my 2 cents worth thanks for the review though.

-1 @iamded: yes it seems the dragon is used as such in the picture of the alternate model, but i guess bad and evil knights also wanna have some fun sometimes you are right with the green plate on the second floor, it does look a bit disturbing. but that can

1 i thoroughly enjoyed your review metalandi, thank you especially for taking photos of all the contraptions and detailing exactly how they work. as a member of classic-castle, the census always seemed to be that fright knights were a class 4/10 or 6/10 but as sandy stated above, it is one of the closest you can get to an evil faction. by today's standards, the contraptions seen here are much much more sophisticated and well thought out and are definitely missing in 2007's king's castle siege. i enjoy the design of this castle much more even if the towers are taller simply because the design in the king's castle siege left builders with an empty space right in the courtyard without even a base plate! and it's nearly impossible to get your hands in and play in the enclosed space (why would anyone unless you're simply posing figs, and even that was difficult). this castle instead, had a variety of trap doors and surprises, so despite the varied colors used here, it's not that hard to realize that the designers for this castle really took time to think things out and tried to make the castle enjoyable for the children that will play with it whereas our 2007 castle was strictly built to give kids the impression of an enormous magnificant castle with little to nothing inside. it's like comparing beauty (2007) to brains (this castle). edited by legobear, 20 july 2008 - 01:32 am.

1 very nice of a very nice set. the revolving fireplace - i wonder what movie that could possibly be from?

1 i have this set, and ilike it! 6097 have many usefull parts! greate review!

0 metalandi, thanks for doing this fright knights review, by opening up a misb set which you have bought recently. i am very sure the feeling is very nice, especially touching the bricks which is preserved for 11 years sealed in bags. i am quite fond of the fright knights theme. unfortunately, this theme was released during my dark age. i never really bought sets from fright knights. instead, i bought plenty of minifigs to build an army. if i could turn back time or find another misb set with a reasonable price, i am very sure i will get it. my soldiers need a castle to stay in. i will be looking forward to your next review. keep up the good job

1 wow, what a cool castle and set in general! i had no idea that this set existed (long dark ages) thanks to you metalandi for such a great review! the figures look really nice and the set is full of lots of little trinkets , details, traps etc! i have already had a look on ebay for this set. looks like a great set for parts too. i give the review 4.5/5 evil witches. cheers isc

1 my first post in this topic looks foolish now that i bought this set from ebay. i just really wanted the minifigs (although i already had the batlord and the black dragon) and the parts. they will help me greatly in building the impenetrable fortress of the dragonwarriors for my princess quest comic. by the end of this week, this set will be in my clutches!

0 well, that the bricks look new comes from that they are new. i got this set new and unopened

1 metalandi, on aug 6 2008, 01:40 pm, said: well, that the bricks look new comes from that they are new. i got this set new and unopened i know, pretty good deal!

1 ahh... i remember how badly i wanted that set when it was new... oh well... definitely one of the most original castles, if not the most. i actually liked how the 1st floor was made into a throne room. the tower looks pretty impressive, too. of course, the castle has a flagrant flaw -- the walls on the sides are open. i also think it lacks in the minifig count, though that is understandable for a castle with a dragon. quote the fright knights are probably the closest you can get for an evil human castle faction. totally agreed.

1 quite the topic bump, but dang, what a cool set, and so tall. this is the kind of sets i had as a kid, but i don't remember this one. i'm jealous.s

1 fire station set #: 6382 year released: 1980/1981 piece count: 368 minifigs: 4 list price: approx. $20 lego's third fire station was this little gem, 6382. the set offered new design elements not previously offered in previous sets. what really stands out for me is 1x3 car doors and torsos with printed designs. a decal was used for the large sign on the building and the #1 on the hood of one of the vehicles. i think this was also the first set to offer the sliding garage mechanism, a feature that added a great amount of realism and playability. the set also included two blue doors and the new fire hose with pre-connected faucet/spicket. getting on to the pictures. i saved the cover of the box for this set but lost the instructions over the years. i was able to download some instructions from the web. here's a shot of the box cover: and the back of the box: the set includes four figs, three of which are fireman, and a lady who can serve as a dispatcher. as mentioned above, the torsos are printed on: my favorite of the two vehicles included, i love the design of fire engine #1: i always loved the fire hoses included in this set. no string to have to tie or freyed ends: engine #2 is this much larger engine with ladder. i like how it contains an oxygen tank and fire axe: on the other side of the engine are two shutter doors that reveal the hose and ladder controls. these are stickers: the ladder is much wider than previous lego ladders and extends a good length: i like the baseplate of this set which has the numbers one and two marking each garage: the building is simple but has a nice design. i love the sliding garage doors: note: notice the two windows of the 2nd floor. the actual set should have blinds on these windows. i've lost one of the stickered windows, so placed the single blinded window on the 1st floor. each of the two sides of the garages are the same. here's a shot of the right side: on the first floor is the dispatch area and a classic blue space computer: the 2nd floor has a bed and a chair: here's a shot of the entire backside: and lastly, a shot of the entire station: this set is one of my favorite fire stations that offers a great amount of playability. hope you enjoyed the review.

1 this is a great set and a great review - thanks for doing these! i remember my brother getting this set (i got the police station 6384 on the same day). truly classic sets - it's a shame that i don't have them anymore although i do have the two immediate descendants of the sets... cheers rog

1 great review again it's nice to see old sets reviewed. i love the control stickers there's a great level of detail this is really the second best fire station in my opinion.

1 lovely!! i can't stop making comparisons between this fire station and last year's, which is also very well detailed, with great features and awesome playability. the concept design of the second one it's very much like the one reviewed here. this is good as tlg is taking back those great values to make the new excellent sets we all are enjoying by now!

1 a 5/5. the set is beautiful, both the remake and the original. a classic and a beautiful thing, like dos. edited by maiq the liar, 20 july 2008 - 09:45 pm.

1 i am a proud owner of this set this is one of the best fire stations ever. what amazes me is what the designers made with only 368 pieces. you get a very nice looking building in good size, a good baseplate, 2 cars, 4 minifigs, accessories... and great alternative ideas in the back of the box (like the fire boat or helicopter). this is a great example of lego design.

1 thanks everyone for the comments. it's great to see that you enjoy these classic reviews, esp. this set. panda9001100, on jul 20 2008, 03:10 pm, said: i made a little modification: excellent! you've also got some other very nice sets there, like that awesome monorail! you should share a review. rupi, on jul 20 2008, 04:25 pm, said: i am a proud owner of this set it's great to hear that some of you have this classic fire station. it really is a nice set with great vehicles and accessories. i also think the overall design is excellent.

1 i must agree great fire station, i love the fact that in the classic sets you were given a base plate and some other great idea's. i do miss the addition of base plates and alternate building idea's. the only newer set i have seen with any alternate build photo's is the 7239 fire engine. i miss back when.......

1 im glad you are reviewing 4-digit sets now, brickster! thebrickster, on jul 20 2008, 07:14 pm, said: this set is one of my favorite fire stations that offers a great amount of playability. this pretty sums it up! the firestation was one of the few sets in my childhood i owned and was not classic space! i especially liked the roller doors, this was one of the first sets they came with. in the late 80s i sold it to my nephew. darn, i really regret it. when i asked him a couple of years ago if he still owned it (and i could buy it back) he also had made cash out of it. i gave it a "4". there is always room for improvement, like the helipad mentioned. so it cant be a "5" in my opinion. take off you rose coloured glasses.

0 i honestly glad i got the latest fire station [cant remember set number] its waayyy better i voted 3 its realy not that great but its ok.....

1 fire copter 1 this is fc-1, over. i'm making my way to main street now. the smoke is coming from the legoland hotel, over. that's a roger. i'm going to shoot the 500 gallon now, over... fire in your tabletown? no problem. lego's set 6685 fire copter is sure to put it out - classic style. set #: 6685 year released: 1982 piece count: 99 minifigs: 1 list price: unknown here's a great fire-themed addition to your classic legoland display. starting with the instructions: the set includes one classic fireman with a nicely printed fireman torso: what a great little detailed helicopter. i love the use of the red and yellow colors: the front opens to allow your fireman to quickly climb in: in the back are two round yellow 2x2 bricks for the water supply and a hose connected on each side. unfortunately, i lost one of the hoses. and the entire set. isn't she a beauty? 6685 fire copter 1 is a great supplement to set 6382 fire station released one year earlier. after buying this great little set, i had fun puting out fires all over my tabletown. oops, i think i smell one now...

0 thebrickster, thank you so much for all these reviews of classic town sets!! omfg, this set was released in 1982 and i was born 1 year earlier, hehe :) nice little heli!

-1 a nice little model with some neat features for it's age plus the all-yime classic fireman as a bonus. however, this design of chopper (the police station around the same time was the same design) i think dated very quickly. while is was good to use the hinged car roof - which was relatively new at the time - together with the inverted screen it was superceded very quickly by designs that stood the test of time far better (for example 6657). also, i don't think i could everbuy a lego fire helicopter because it is not something we have in the uk/eire. police, coast guard, ambulance, military, etc, etc but no fire helicopters. not something i would therefore want in my lego town. great review though. many thanks again for doing these. cheers rog

1 i vote outstanding because it makes excellent use of the pieces that were available at the time. that cockpit makes excellent use of an inverted windshield.

1 hello all eurobricks members and town lovers, today, i will be doing up a review on snorkel squad, one of the most important and basic vehicle in any fire department. snorkel squad, in simple english terms, it refers to fire engine, fighting fire, always on standby, ready to save the citizens from crisis. trust me, you will understand why this snorkel squad is superb impressive by the end of this review. on a side note, there is only part that is replaced by another color. can you find the difference? name: snorkel squad theme: lego system / town year: 1987 pieces: 151 minifigs: 2 price: usd$13.50 an image of a 6358, snorkel squad looking smart on their stand-by this snorkel squad is a fanastic fire engine, that is ready to save people from the fires. it's primary color "red" is used in all fire emergency department and vehicles. in case of any emergency, this snorkel squad will be activated and arrived at the scene as soon as possible. no time to waste! personally, this is the best fire engine that i had ever seen. meet the fire fighters it comes with two brave fire fighters. both of them wear the standard fire fighter outfit that is present in almost all fire station sets in classic town. the torso is very nice and formal, and looks real impressive onto them. i love the buttons on them. furthermore, these white helmets are a symbol to the world of fire fighting. these are the people whom save lives by risking their own lives in dangerous situations. water hose compartment the water hose is a string that is stored in the front. it can be rolled out, and the fire fighters are able to use it without much difficulty. they will just pull out the hose and spray onto the fire. the next picture, shows a much clearer look in its interior. in addition, the fire logo that is on the compartment, is actually printed. yes, it's not a sticker, and that is great news for us! interesting features these clamps on both sides, is supposed to stablise the fire engine when the ladder is heading upwards. it is a simple mechanism, which illustrate clearly what it does. this feature is recently seen in construction vehicle such as the mobile crane. of course, it is not a complicated feature. it just made use of three quite common white parts. swivel mechanism these swivel mechanism, in my opnion are very fun to play with. these connectors on the front and the back, enable the long fire engine, to make sharp turns on any junctions, arriving at the scene fast enough. this is not a fire engine that only travel straight roads. try it onto your base plates, and you will be surprised, how well it can turn. best playable mechanism in 6358 the driver will be activating the ladder at the back of the vehicle. in order, to adjust the height and making sure that the ladder do not fall short, the tiles on the plates are acting like a stoppage. the ladder are able to rotate 360 degree without much problem, if you removed the driver out of the control panel. it goes up as tall as 30cm! look at that amazing height. too bad, i have not constructed my cafe corner yet. otherwise, i can give you a better feel of how amazing this baby can go. i used the old road baseplate as a guide, and roughly it can goes as tall as 30 to 35cm. look at the black hinges below. by shifting it to the last, that was the maximum height it can move. this is a very good way to adjust the height. oh, and i forget to mention that there are 2 storage compartments for the fighters to place their equipments behind. quite easy to access. no doors? apart from the standard roof top on the driver's seat, there is no doors present at both side. i am quite sad to see that there are no doors. maybe, these fighters are supposed to jump off the seat, instead of opening the doors? well, i guess this is the only major flaws that i had found in this set. heading off *got you* meet the model 6358 fire engine summary review playability: 10/10 (superb fun. the ladder and swivel mechanism is really very fun to play with.) design: 9.5/10 (excellent design. it got an almost full 10. the lack of doors, dropped my ratings slightly.) price: 8/10 (a very mid range price. i don't think it cost very expensive. but, i am not sure how much it cost now.) overall: 9.2/10 (best fire engine ever, and one of the great looking one too. get this model now.) i gave it a "5" based on my review score card. what about yours? hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my brickshelf (when moderated)

0 thanks for another great review. i can remember the 6358 very vividly. my parents bought the 6340 for me and a girl friend got the 6358. i'm quiet sure it's my envy because until now i want to believe that the 6340 is better. my reasons were these: i own the 6340 (and on the instructions of the 6358 stood "legoland" which i thought of as old.) but this review induced me to get over this humiliation from my childhood ( ) and check ebay for the 6358. edited by bernddasbrot, 21 july 2008 - 04:07 pm.

1 a truly great set. i always loved the mobile crane and was gobsmacked when this popped up using some of the great features from the crane but also making it an emergency vehicle too! great classic firemen and - in your version - a suspiciously blue fire extinguisher great review of a great set - just a pity i no longer have it... so many sets i used to have got lost during the period at the end of my childhood before i rescued what was left from my dad's house once i realised what i had left behind!! hindsight is a great thing?? cheers again rog

0 a great review, i like this set it captures the classic town feeling well, and the ladder is cool! i can't help but feel thought that these reviews are being churned out to quickly, you should leave a gap, i am being flooded with all these great reviews!

0 nice reveiw it looks like a great set i think i know what i will do tonight- rebuild my lego fire department it has- [fire pickup truck, fire truck [from 2005 sorry cant remember set number] and the most recent fire station if i can find all the pieces......

0 nice review, whitefang, with lots of photos - exactly as a good review should be! as for the set - i own it and it's a very good one! the fire squad vehicle is a nice addition to my other fire dept. vehicles. it offers very good playability and this ladder is so long! you can have so much fun with it.

1 that's a great review/poll, whitefang! i gave this set a 5: it's simply ! the only thing which i miss are the respirators for the firemen since they already own air tanks. but otherwise this set is brilliant! i like it much more than the new one from 2007 since it's not that big and juniorized. klaus-dieter

1 great set. i found only one major fail - this - the hands of robot arms gets easly broken.

1 thanks for the review. this set was outstanding for its time with all the features and detail. the extending basket is just wonderful. however, i honestly wouldn't consider it the best firetruck ever. i actually like the one from 2005 even better - becasue like most of the city vehicles, it adds the needed bulk big engines like fire trucks need. many of the older kits, while awesome, were honestly a little too skinny imo.

1 guys, thanks for all your great comments! nikola bathory, on jul 22 2008, 06:57 pm, said: it offers very good playability and this ladder is so long! you can have so much fun with it. yes, the "extended length" of the ladder provides great playability! klaus-dieter, on jul 25 2008, 03:01 am, said: i like it much more than the new one from 2007 since it's not that big and juniorized. thanks k.d. i owned the 2007 fire engine as well, as this set was not restored back then, and i needed a fire engine very badly. i managed to restored it somehow, and i compared it with the 2007. the older design is still the best. osakana, on jul 25 2008, 04:03 am, said: great set. i found only one major fail - this - the hands of robot arms gets easly broken. yes, this is an interesting finding. i remembered when i was a child. that robot arms always come out of its own, when i fiddle with it. i was so annoyed by it and i just kept it there whenever i deployed it for rescue missions. grevious, on jul 26 2008, 02:00 am, said: however, i honestly wouldn't consider it the best firetruck ever. i actually like the one from 2005 even better - becasue like most of the city vehicles, it adds the needed bulk big engines like fire trucks need. many of the older kits, while awesome, were honestly a little too skinny imo. grevious, i appericate your honest comments, and given me your insight towards this set, and state a comparison as well. i agreed with you, that fire engines need to be big and sturdy. on the other hand, it can be nice to have the fire engine to look slim as well, to cut through the traffic easily. i am not against with the newer sets. it just that, part of the reasons which reflected in the review had fufill the basic key factors of a typical fire engine. in addition, it was my all-time favourite under the "fire-fighting" theme.

1 one of my all time favourite i still love it even after all these years, though it did always seem a bit out of place as when i was a child id never seen a similar looking fire appliance in the uk.

0 nice pictures, but three questions: 1. how many pages do the instruction books have? 2. what are the spare parts? or: does this laaty come with two clone-commander-equipment sets and four assaij ventress lightsaberhilts? 3. where did you get it? 4. how much did it cost?

1 it looks like a really good set and like it is a lot larger than the old one. thanks for the review!

0 thanks for the reivew. could you post a few pics of the at-te in all it's glory? kimt

-1 i just got this set sunday, and it's so huge that i can't put it anywhere. it is pretty sturdy and heavy, that's where the handle comes in. i'm pissed that you only get 2 clones. rex has to fight on the ground while you need more clones to man the guns/cockpit. the legs were the most annoying and time consuming part of the build. and yea i agree, that if tlg had made numbered bags, it would have taken only 2 hours rather than 4. edited by ih master 13uilder17, 14 october 2008 - 11:38 pm.

1 i bought this a few weeks ago and absolutely loved making it. it's amazing how the paneling comes together to make such a tight fit, but can easily open up. the legs could have been a bit more poseable, and the guns don't launch easily unless you push hard and fast. i'd like the firing mechanism to launch more smoothly. but it looks absolutely amazing. about price, it was 13,000 where i am, but i'm used to lego being expensive in japan, so it was good value.

1 funny minifig actions there. i do love the at-te, a definite buy for walker fans.

-1 probably my most wanted set(rgs is too much), but this seems a 'lil overpriced, i mean $90 for a skeleton? ii'll wait fr it to go on sale(which i doubt it will)

0 sorry for reanimating this topic. there is a technic brick in the mid section of this set. does anyone know the function of that ??

0 thank you that was what i guessed :) but i didn't see any detailed pictures of 10195, do we have the instructins or something now? is that how dropship lifts the walker ?

1 cagri, on mar 11 2009, 12:03 am, said: exactly kim, that's what i meant. i pondered and wondered that for a long time :) i decided to ask here when a friend wondered the same thing. i hope it fits with the new droship. it would be really cool. and it's also great that tlg knows what they'll be prodcuing a year later.. it does. the description of the new 10195 dropship and at-ot states that the at-te can be carried too. they've planned this for quite a while.

0 yeah, when i built it, i wondered for a long time. i considered many possiblities temporarily, like either tlc had gone crazy or i had missed a page in the instructions.

1 7676: republic attack gunship number of pieces: 1034 number of minifigs: 5 price: 119.99 usd brickset hey everyone, i just got the rgs yesterday at tru after i came home from camp. i saw all of the topics that i missed, and noticed a mini-review and a review with one pic, so i thought i'd make a huge, shiny new review that has lots of pictures and all of the requirements of kimt's index. note: i did not apply any stickers to it, as a personal liking. so, lets start by looking at the box: a shiny, clean, and futuristic box, quite different from the other star wars box designs before this. there was so much clone wars merchandise with this font and design in the huge display at the front of my local toys r us store, and not just lego. it so beautiful, with the white and sky blue... anyways, for some reason, the boxes of the new clone wars sets seemed more shiny than usual. maybe it's because they were just shipped, but once you pick up the boxes, they will feel really good in your hands, despite the fact that only about half of the space in the boxes are used... the back of the box: the back shows all of the main features of the set, plus pictures of the three other clone wars sets meant to be released alongside this one (although i did spot the twilight and homing spider droid, which were supposed to be released in september or october). so, on to the gunship: built straight from the bags. it took me about 4 1/2 hours, with breaks. it has an overall great design, but somewhat fragile, especially when building it. the cockpits always fall apart when opened, as well as the bubbles on the wings (which i will get into more later). the color scheme is very well done. you can always find the piece you're looking for thanks to the color diversity: red, dark red, lime green (ooh!), blue, black, tan, light bley, dark grey, yellow and white. also, split down the middle vertically, the ship is almost all symmetrical. front: side: now, lets start with the many features that this set is hiding. the front has lots of lime green, a rare color. but more importantly: ...a rotating gun is found on each side. they rotate in a pretty wide range, although fragile. cockpits: there are two main cockpits, right next to each other. not very detailed, and are the same. and for some reason, the whole cockpit element flips up to reveal: ...nothing. just the skeleton of the ship. probe droid storage: above the cockpit lies a plate that can be flipped up to reveal a storage area that holds: two of these probe droids. at least, that's what i think they are. hull: in this pic, two features are hidden. mobile command center: the first of the two is a mobile command center, but essentially just a hover chair. it is found by flipping up the two panels on either side of the hull. bacta tank: the second is the bacta tank found by just sliding it out of the storage area behind the mcc. one half of the tank opens: ...so a minifigure can go inside and heal his/her wounds obtained in battle. cargo hold: now, this is probably the main feature for this set. the two sliding doors (two on each side) slide open thanks to a clever technic mechanism. not much in here, just a gun holder and a place where the passengers wait to be dropped off in battle. speeder bike: i guess you guys saw it, the speeder bike. it is found by opening the rear flap. the bike is very cleverly designed by using a brown trike body. it's only a few centimeters shorter than the bike found in the clone battle pack. rear gun: just a gun similar to the front ones. engines: huge engines (or are they cannons?) that are really fun to build. they really give that cartoon feel to this set. missiles: in between the engines are two sets of four flick-fire missiles. bubble cockpits: there is one bubble cockpit on each wing that supposedly control the turrets at the front. very fragile. storage containers: two storage containers on each side hold the clone accessories. but, i wouldn't recommend putting them in there, because the antennae can fall out, or you might forget about them. sticker sheet: the dreaded sticker sheet (dss) has all of the stickers you need for this set. unfortunately, mine was crunched up. i don't like stickers much anyways, but i might still apply some. note the republic symbol stickers, why couldn't tlg just use that printed piece from a few years back? also, you get to choose between a bird-rat thing or a sleeping twi'elk as your hull decal. what they're for, i don't know, looks like the movie or show will explain it though. minifigs: finally, the five minifigs of this set. they are all great figs, including: commander cody: amazing, especially with the gear. the orange is nice, but i thought he was yellow. clone trooper: again, amazing. the gear is great, and the new helmet and torso are great! all of the clones in the clone wars line have the same heads. also, you can see the flesh beneath the helmet. asaaj ventress: not so happy about this one. the torso and dark blue legs are cool, but the dress is pretty ugly. the head is alright, but could do without the cartoon-y face (yeah i know, its from a cartoon). also has purple markings on back of head. obi-wan kenobi: pretty cool, besides the face. cool hair and torso, though. plo koon: beautiful! the true gem of this set, in my opinion. the head is the same material as kit fisto's. and the tosro is awesome, good for making a custom ki-adi mundi. well, that's about it, here is the... final verdict: build: 8/10, very fun and easy, should take the seasoned builder about 4 hours. somewhat fragile. playability: 9.5/10, lots of fun features, although some can break easily. swooshability: 3/10, i wouldn't recommend flying it around much, as you can barely pick it up safely. but with two hands gripping the bottom firmly, it can be moved around, but not spun or swooshed, etc. minifigs: 8/10, all very great figs, especially plo koon, but could have included more clone troopers. design: 7.5/10, some excellent ideas included in here, although some spots are very fragile. price: 7/10: should have been only 100 usd if not for the new molds. plus, at tru, it was 130 usd. overall score: 8.5/10, a great set to have for your star wars/ clone wars collection, with some flaws. save up for this one. so, how did you like my review? your feedback is much appreciated! jimbutcher, out. edited by jimbutcher, 15 september 2008 - 03:06 am. indexed

0 okay, if this were the first review of the set, i'd understand your want to reserve a thread for your review, but seriously, there are already reviews out there. couldn't you have just waited at least until you had actually built the thing, or even better, until the review was actually done? sorry if i'm being to harsh but i'm quite sick of these "blablabla set review - will be up soon...". it's getting quite annoying. ~peace

-1 the cockpit piece doesnt hold well when you try to "swing-it-open" most of the time it just pops off

1 very good review! i just checked my ep. ii vehicle encyclopedia (yes, i'm a total sw geek) and tlg got it pretty accurately with the rgs.

1 i really like the new gunship. different enough from the old one to be better, but similar enough that they don't look totally weird together. really like the new minifigs. didn't think i would like the new clone troopers at all. the accessories are fine. i would never use them on the regular clones, but to each their own.

0 ah yeah, sorry ! of course ! i see. thanks.

1 thanks for the review jimbutcher . i really like this new gunship but i cant own one until like two or three months and this is with all the clone wars sets .

0 thanks for all the feedback so far, guys! i meant yellow for cody's color.

1 jimbutcher, finally i had seen something that is worth reading and viewing. imho, this is your best star wars review i had ever read. most importantly, it is a complete review which has substance. you have my thanks! keep up the good job back to the rgs, this is the next star wars set i will be getting. i can't wait to lay my hands on this set, and start building. basically, how bad this set can be, it can't be worse. republic gunship is one of the all-time favourites, in star wars prequel and ot. i can't find any faults, except being too expensive due to the licence cost. in addition, the mini-figs are the next big thing. seriously, i am quite impressed with it. on the down side, my rating will go up if there is an additional clone trooper instead of one. nevertheless, this is a "must get" set, no matter what!

0 thanks for the review. i havent seen any other clone flashligh pics, so thanks for that one "starting tonight, people will die... i'm a man of my word." jifel

1 i got this set in the spring during my "buy every new castle set available"-season. granted, i couldn't afford all of them, but i do have most of them now. anyway, i love the action elements to this set, and the siege tower really does look wicked. i'd like to attach the crownie tower to the king's castle to see how it fits, but i unfortunately don't own that set (yet). i also love the turning head of the soldier, and i've used it in my princess quest-comic as well, along with the turning head of the princess. the troll leader brings good variety to the army of trolls, but they still could use another face type and more torso options. it's a nice review, in any case, although the set pretty much speaks for itself.

1 hey, good review and good photos. i also got this set just recently, and i wasn't very enthusiastic about it at the beginning, but after i built it i could appreciate it. the siege engine is very nice, but my complaint has do with the proportions of the knight's tower in respect to the trolls' machine - it's a bit smaller, and less bulkier. that complaint has to go with some other sets too. for example the troll warship is really humongous - it feels like it can load the evil wizard's tower and sail off. other than that - a good set, i like it, 4/5 from me.

1 excellent review and your pictures are very good, i look forward to seeing more review. i really like this set i got it some time ago and keep meaning to post some pictures of it going up against some of the older castles.

1 very nice review pedro! you beat me to it. there was a review done about january, but i wanted to have a go, just haven't opened the box yet..... great pics and well demonstrated action elements too. i rate this as one of the coolest castle sets just for its playability and 5 figures. this will def add to my orc army, and i may purchase more of this set if they dont release a orc bp. keep up the good work!

0 great review! this is an awesome set. besides knocking down the wall at the side, can the battering ram do any other damage to the tower (ex, reducing it to rubble bricks)? and why can't the orc just jump out of the hole in the back? do they need to do that much unnecessary damage to the tower?

1 when i first saw this topic, i thought, "oh, great, another review of this set..." however i'm glad you posted it now, your pics are great and, well, it was just a generally good review! i'm looking forward to seeing more... ~peace

1 thanks for the review! from this set, i prefer the crown knight's tower - it's a very good-looking structure!

1 whitefang, on jul 30 2008, 12:56 am, said: pedro, for your first review, you have amaze me with your photo session and the strucutre of your review. i am very impressed by your high quality pictures. you have done an excellent job! i completely agree. this is an amazing review - bits of humor, great photography, and detailed descriptions/photos. based upon this review i've placed an order for this set (along with some convincing from amazon's 20% sale ). the only drawbacks in this set that i can see concerns the tower with it being 1) small compared to the seige tower and 2) missing a few walls. however, this is also the joy of lego as one can simply purchase a few bricks and build their own walls and/or expand the tower's size (or even attach it to a castle). of course, this increases the price of the set, but considering how cheap bricks are on bricklink, tower raid is still a very good value. i hope you continue doing reviews, pedro.

1 i have one of these and must say that this is the best castle set in the theme, and the most useful parts pack for its size yet.

1 nice short review, although a little hard to read. i agree that this set is a really great one.

1 i really liked this set, it's cheap and comes with a good supply of flesh heads and the new hair mold. i love the tent too. i'd give it a 10/10.

1 i give it a 10/10 for the parts. that's the reason i got mine.

1 a great price point for a nice bunch of figs and accesories. pity about the fleshies though... god bless, nathan

1 fleshies sometimes come in handy. great review and good set, but as said by other: another russian soldier (or two) would be fine, tlc is being a bit too much of a cheapskate regarding minifigs lately.

1 good review. this is my second ij kit that i got and i think it is a great deal. only 10$ and get 3 figs and great parts to use. i may pick up 2 more so i have penty of ants and other goodies that this comes with.

1 hmm. a tougie. i really like the world city one, yet the dino one is a better deal. i'll vote for the dino, because i (regretably) don't even have the world city one...

1 the coast guard quad, because i live in the netherlands, and we don't have the 'dino attack theme', we have dino 2010, which have a diffrent quad. so i would like to chose the dino attack one, but as i don't one him, goast guard. though. but i also don't have the coast guard one, but i like him, but i also don't have the coast quard one as well. greets the-force! edited by the-force, 01 august 2008 - 11:18 pm.

1 that was an intresting race and i was split between the two until i saw whitefang`s reply and the fact you can use the sprinter as a militery thing(which you could do for both but sprinter just pulls it off better) and i like the radar on the back of it so i`ll have to go with the street sprinter. thanks for the nice topic brickster

1 i've got to go with the town one, since you have to stand on the dino one. steve

1 i vote for the dino quadbike, definately! i wish i had that but i'll have to make do with the much less violent european version (dino '2010' not 'attack') here's a comaprison... european version: usa etc. version: there's a subtle difference, but i prefer the us one as for the coast guard quad, i think it's ok but not as good as the new one.

1 i like the dino thingy because of the pieces and the dino is a lot of fun on its own (i know, thats akward)...

1 dino attack for me! you just cant say no to a huge bazooka! though the tan and dark red works for me too

1 dino attack quad for me. no, this isn't because i own it and not the other one, but because i think just about everything is better in it - the design is better, the colors are cooler, and it has a better figure. i don't like the figure in the coast guard quad at all - but since it was from world city, i'm not suprised. i also kinda like the dino, actually. it's flexible and fits in with the previous dinos a lot better than the cruddy bigger ones with bright red, yellow, and green highlights.

1 price: 569 kr minifigs: 2 pieces: 592 stickers: 9 (my sticker sheet wasnt curled up) overview: before i start i will apologize for the bad quality of the pictures. it is getting dark here right now, so some of the pictures are a bit dark. 1) minifigs: the set comes with two of the new clone wars clone troopers, which in my opinion are pretty cool. it also comes with two short blasters and a bag of clone accessories. figs with helmets: figs without helmets: 2) the tank: this thing is huge (25cm long and 22cm wide), and far oversized in my opinion, but looks great nonetheless. i very much like the white and dark red color scheme, mixed with a bit of lime green (even though there is no lime green bricks ;) ). left side: right side: back side: both of the wings contain a hidden compartment to store the blasters and a part that rotates to reveal three flickfire missiles. the front opens up as well to reveal the engine. the side guns and the gun on the top rotate. inside the cockpit is space for two figs; one seated in front of two computer screens and one placed in a moveable seat, which moves up and down, allowing the fig to pop up the top hatch and staying hidden while the hatch is closed. this function is triggered by opening the backdoor. hidden compartment and missiles: engine: top hatch (open/closed): interior: 3) rating: build: 9/10 not much to say here. minifigs: 7/10 an extra fig or two would have been great; eventually a jedi or a commando. design: 8/10 this only looses a couple of points for being oversized, but its a great looking model. parts: 10/10 at 592 parts, this is one of the cw sets with the best parts/price ratio. price: 8/10 sure this thing is great, but i think its overpriced at 569 kr. (approx. $120). when build it feels more like a 450 kr. set. final verdict: 9/10 despite some flaws this thing is definitely recommended, and it looks great on your shelf, too ;)

-1 i know it would really go well with the rgs but it is not enough for 50. ill wait for the sales at christmas.

-1 nice review , for portugal it costs 60. i also consider it oversized, it shold be the third of that size... portugal and spain may have good prices but 90 for the v-19 must be a tippo.

-1 finally a review of this, thanks! 120 bucks? this tank looks tiny and though it's amazingly detailed it should have been smaller and only 40/50 bucks at most. it just doesn't play that big a part man. good pieces and mechanisms but no one's going to both buying a 120 buck tank, no offence, not unless it it's the at-te.

-1 im really mad. this isn't even out in the us. i want this set really bad.

1 thanks for the review! i think this is my favourite clone wars set, behind the republic gunship.

1 thanks for the review, christian, i was hoping for one soon . this set really looks good, but as you said, rather big. the figs are good, and i agree that ki-adi mundi should be included. i like the hidden compartments for the blasters and missiles, and the cockpit is really cool, considering it seats two (i thought only one). i will surely pick this up sometime.

1 nice review, thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts. looks like a really nice set and i'll be picking it up eventually when it makes it to the us.

0 do you have any pics of the wheels? i wanna see what those are like.

-1 thank you for the first ever review of the fighter tank. i like this set and every features it offers. but i think that the engine could have a better look than just four green cylinders in a grey piece.

1 i am 100% going to get this set! it should be about $55 and if it is, i'll get it without a doubt! i just hope that this set is $50-$60. if it isn't, then we have a problem...

1 this and the at-te and the spider tank and maybe the droid gunship are the few clone wars sets i'll buy. i loved playing as this tank in the clone wars video game( even better with cheat codes for extra missile spam ), so this is a must get.

-1 thanks for posting the review, ive been wondering about this set. to me it does feel a bit fig light, for 50 id expect maybe one or two more clones. im not to sure about the oversized issue, it seems to me its better to have something a bit to large and have a better level or features than something smaller will less.

0 this set costs a s$100 in singapore.i went to hng kong too see lego and the shops there are more expensive by a few dollars.however,i went to australia before and everything there is the same price but when there is a sale it becomes very cheap!anyway, thanks for the review!i was wondering about the details of this set.the clone's faces look a lot like anakin's face.why is that so?i thought it is supposed to look like jango's?

1 im definatly gonna get the atte. im thinking about getting the spider droid and fighter tank. i alredy own the older version of the republic gunship (but i still want it) agentrick57, on aug 1 2008, 08:44 pm, said: i loved playing as this tank in the clone wars video game( even better with cheat codes for extra missile spam ) sorry to get off topic... but i own that game! i liked playing as the republic gunship the best!

1 4478 geonosian fighter review parts:169 figs:4 price:?15.00 (i think) here is a review of the amazing geonosian fighter set, it was my first ever star wars lego set! here go's... 1. manual not much here although it's an old style manual cover. random shot. back. 2. general set and minifigs a pic of the entire set, it has 2 reddish tan battle droids geo pilot, geo soldier, geo star fighter and geo turret. the 4 figs, the droids come with backpacks. geo soldier. i prefer this gun. give him a cane to become poggle the lesser the geo leader. detailed legs are always nice. the bodies are a little fat for geonosians i guess but nice printing on them. the head. the wings. 1. 2. 3. voila! all done 3. the star fighter it has a landing gear type thing. the detail on those plates. the pilot in the cockpit. cockpit with canopy. 1 of 2 ball joint things, this is the engine. 2nd ball joint which is the front gun. 4. the turret the turret by itself. turret with the soldier. a printed round plate. 5. overall build: 7/10 a little repetitive but enjoyable. minifigs: 9/10 4 that's pretty good for a set this size. design: 6/10 the fighter dosen't really look right nor does the turret but they are both strong. parts: 8/10 lot's of interesting parts and comes with two of the ball joint things as well the minifig parts being good. price: 10/10 cheap (for the uk) considering the amount of minifigs and parts. playability: 5/10 not much but you can have mini battles with the turret and starfighter. overall: 8/10 i gave it 8 because of the design which was not accurate and the low number of parts. thanks for reading and hope you liked it as much as i did . edited by kimt, 04 august 2008 - 11:42 am. indexed

0 good review. i would get this set, but sadly they don't have it anymore.... i wish they did to get those sweet figs! the battle droid colors are sweet! the only set with geonosians....

0 i wish they made more sets with those colored droids as well. we should have got them with the hailfire droid and dwarf spider set i think. i also just noticed look the ball turret on the manual there's no markings on it.

0 thanks for the review. i love these affordable little sets. not so affordable now because of the cool figs but i'm going to have a look on ebay and bricklink right now just in case! an army of tan red droids would look great. maybe we'll see some if geonosia appears in the new seires somehow unlikely since the confederacy was defeated at the battle of geonosis. i wish i could have bought this set when it came out but i'd just left university so i was super skint and had to miss all the ep.ii sets now they all cost loads even in used condition. at least now there has been a re-design of the gunship and at-te from the clone wars series that i can buy.

1 great review! man doi wish i had those red droids. i'm using the dell xps-1, and holy crap is it clear. those pics were beautiful!

0 ~vbbn~ the pics were 12 mega pixles which is quite a lot i think, although i had to scale them down to 800x600. i used to dream that tlg would bring out these sets of the geonosis arena and you could join them together to make a massive arena but i doubt they would ever do that. also look out for my forth coming reviews of 4500 snow speeder, some tie fighter with a lul dv, and gg wheel bike chase. i have taken all the pics all i need to do is upload them. also i would review the jango fett's slave 1 but i have customized it so much i don't really want to revert it back to it's original state. edited by skipper 24, 02 august 2008 - 07:18 pm.

1 thanks for the review skipper. this is one of my favourite sets. i really like the colour scheme and the geonosians are awesome. keep up the good work kimt

1 i always thought this looked liek a cool set, with lots of nice (and sadly unique) pieces. unfortunately the only attack of the clones sets i got were the jedi starfighter and yoda vs dooku. amazing sets, but i would love to have owned them all. i'd never really looked into this set very much, so thanks for the review!

1 this is actually one of my favorite star wars sets. awesome rare pieces, and excellent construction. geo figs are a plus too. best of all, it's nice and cheap.

1 good review! i really liked the detailed geonosians, and i hope theyre in a later set so i can get more. knowing lego they'll release a huge arena playset with a few geos and sand red droids so people will buy the set just for them. jifel

1 great review! really shows off the main aspects of the set. wish i had picked up a tie when they were around... dsr

1 thanks for the review. i'll definately get this set sooner or later. imo the tiny turbos are awesome. i actually bought nearly every set so far, built the models, added the stickers and packed them away in zip-lock bags in the attic. sadly i don't have display room for them (yet). a fine set, carwise.. dump the slammers and buildings into the spare bag and keep the cars. kimt tiny turbos on!

1 tiny turbos are good for parts, but i'm not so keen on them as they have no minifig drivers. so, i wasn't sure about this set. but your review has made me like them more, i probably won't buy the set but i appreciate it more. thanks for the review!

1 kimt, on aug 3 2008, 01:06 pm, said: thanks for the review. i'll definately get this set sooner or later. you better hurry. they are not at s@h any longer! quote a fine set, carwise.. dump the slammers and buildings into the spare bag and keep the cars. thats exactly what i did. the slammers are already seperated to our color boxes.

1 thanks for the review! i have quite a few tts.(tiny turbos). i never got this one, but if it's on sale....

1 as my summer holiday was kinda wet for 2 weeks, i decided to shop some sets. i crossed the german border and bought me this one mainly for the parts. to get time going, i built the models and made this small review for you to enjoy (or hate) high resolution pics can be found here when public. set# 4994 title: fierce creatures price: 9.99 euro / 12.99 usd pieces: 193 minifigs: 0 the box: the box looks awesome! it has some great animations of the 3 models in the instruction. the rear of the box shows some nice up-close-and-personal drawings of each model. i think it works better having the models drawn instead of a mere photo of them. somehow it allows the great colour-scheme to really show. the instructions: the instruction is easy to follow and shows which pieces are used in each building step. that makes it all a lot easier, especially with so many small pieces as in this set. the bricks are divided into 3 polybags and the instruction is a fine small book, which can be easily stored along the rest of your ever-growing amount of booklets and pamphlets printed by tlg. the models: model 1 is a spider and its nasty. the 2x2 modified brick with the hole would allow one to hang it from a string. this beast is sure to give you several nightmares, were it hanging from a string in your bedroom.  so i wouldnt do that (plus the fact that my wife threw away the box and ordered me to take the spider apart when she saw it  shes an arachnophobian and does not take spiders lightly). it looks real, in a brickish-non-real-way. model 2 is a snake. theres not much to say other than the head is awesomely designed and the rest is bad. the body is poorly designed and does not live up to the coolness of the head. build the head, ignore the rest. model 3 is a flying scorpion or something. not as realistic as the spider, but still a great model with a cool head. the tail is a bit poorly designed, but itll do and it does offer some good ideas on how to use bricks. all in all verdicts: this is an ok creator set. it holds a lot of fine pieces and the models are an ok inspiration. given its size, its an ok set. but its nothing more than that. ill give it an average score. i enjoyed building the models and fumbling with the bricks in the shade during a siesta on my vacation. and thats what it is, an enjoyable build and a little inspiration on a hot day with a erdinger dunkel weissbier in my other hand. kimt edited by whitefang, 23 may 2009 - 06:29 pm. indexed

1 looks like a pretty good set with a some nice colors. the spider is probably the best model in my opinion, but i mean look at the wasp kinda weak it you ask me. nice review .

1 thanks for the review, kim! kimt, on aug 3 2008, 01:01 pm, said: i crossed the german border and bought me this one mainly for the parts. what parts were you looking for? or just for all of the parts? i like the story with your wife. the spider is really cool. nice photo shots on the grass, kim! too bad the other alternative builds are kinda odd. always creators on!

1 thanks for the review. this is another good sw set. a true classic. i especially like the colourscheme of this set. the rebel gun is crappy though, but overall the set rocks. kimt

1 i once bought a entire lego collection including this set. however, i never have build it. seeing this fine review has given me new motivation to do so. nice work again skipper!

1 my review gave you motivation to build a set. my review was better than i thought.

1 skipper, thanks for doing up all these sw reviews. it certainly had given me some valuable insights on these sets especially on the snowspeeder. it kind of making me regret to pass off this set. however, i had bought the hoth base instead but had never built it. i am just wondering if the snowspeeder had any difference? keep up the good work and always strive your best to make each upcoming review a better one.

0 there isn't much difference apart form it has stickers on and is grey. also the guns and tow cable gun are different as well as the engines. but if you look at pictures of the hoth base speeder not to much is noticeable.

0 i have mixed feelings about this set. it's one of the sets that sent my into a dark age (the birth of my son contributed heavily). when i first saw this set i was convinced that the earlier snowspeeder (7130) was superior in every way. i liked the look of the 7130 version better, i liked the coloration of it better. the turret was better (it used a webbed 6 x 6 dish). after seeing this review, i realize i was wrong on some accounts. the cockpit is much more movie accurate. the 7130 version had two separate compartments. this version also came with a tow cable, something that was lacking from the previous set. while i still am unimpressed with the overall look of this set, it is much less blocky, which is always a good thing. overall, i still prefer 7130 to the 4500 version. but the 4500 isn't nearly as bad as i first assumed, and i regret never buying one of these when i had my chance.

1 great review! i bought this set when it came out but sold it a couple years later for some extra cash. i have no regrets selling this one, as i was never really impressed with it (different story for the 4483 at-at - oh how i wish i still had that one). the snowspeeder was alright, just didn't have any sort of "wow" factor to it. the best part of the set is probably the rebel trooper. looking at the last photo in your review, looks like you're about to have a major battle in your hallway. apart from the snowspeeder & motorized at-at, i see the arc-170 fighter, grievous's starfighter, and is that a podracer i see -- and what is the set with the treads? it's not star wars, but looks like a pretty cool set (maybe a mission mars vehicle).

0 skipper 24, on aug 4 2008, 12:52 pm, said: podracer not sure where you got that from (i didn't have them out)? i noticed the minifig between the grievous starfighter & the mod-dino2010 vehicle and it looked like a little person sitting in the pod of his podracer. guess my eyes are playing tricks on me -- my eyesight is shot & my wife keeps pushing me to go visit the optometrist.

0 skipper 24, on aug 3 2008, 11:09 pm, said: the minifgs on the box top. they spelt dack's name wrong good set though.

0 kimt, on sep 11 2008, 08:29 pm, said: no they didn't. read this. you'll find the answer close the end of the article. oh, nevermind. thanks!

1 i really liked this set. it was simple to build, yet detailed and included three figures, which was nice. if only lego would do a few more hoth sets, then we could make a real battle.

1 i find myself so stupid i didn't bought this set. it was 30 euro and i thought that it would be for sale after a half year. (it was with earlier sw sets also). nice review.

1 thanks for the rewiev! a nice set indeed, to bad i dint buy it when it still was in the stores.

1 you have to love the originals, well i didn't like the very first snowspeeder so this is the original to me. i like it more then the new one that comes with the echo base, beter color scheme and more realistic i think. i got this set in stores and still love it to this day =]

1 good review, i like it a lot. nice job

1 this is one of my favorite sw sets. it is a good size to the hoth base and the at_at.

0 7255 general greivous wheel bike chase review parts: 111 figs: 2 price: 10.00 the first set to include gg. 1. general set and minifigs (not manual because i don't have it) the contents of the box after being built. both minifigs. the set includes 5 lightsabers! my own design gg. gg's cape on the outside. gg's cape on the inside. 2. the wheel bike front view standing on legs. side view. gg can't hold the controls because of his arms. roller mode. the legs are a bit to chunky so to roll it has to be tilted forward. 3. boga the lizard. grey tip to the tail. the front back and saddle split in to three sections. 4. overall build: 4/10 there isn't really much to build. minifigs: 9/10 it comes with gg with the special cape and obi-wan in rots gear which is hard to find i think. design: 5/10 not really to scale but otherwise okay apart from boga which just looks like any old dinosaur. also the controls on the wheel bike aren't really right. parts: 6/10 comes with some dark green bricks and lots of rods ( the guns on the wheel bike) the boga feet are also nice. price: 8/10 10 for 2 figs isn't bad it could have a few more parts though. playability: 10/10 you can easily recreate the movie scenes with this set. overall 7/10 it would be better if the bike and boga were more to scale and more accurate as well as the set having more parts.

-1 not one of my favourite sw sets. kinda boring and the set is poorly designed imho. we do get the general, but that's not nearly enough. thanks for the reivew and fine pics. kimt

0 i had this set (15 rrp actually ;-)) and agree mostly with your review, although on the wheel bike itself two legs can be placed at the front end and two at the back to enable it to 'roll' properly. boga is very juniorised, and the set itself is very simple and contains many large pieces. the minifigures are good though (i traded my gg however ). just to offer my personal thoughts; build: 5/10 minifigs: 10/10 parts: 3/10 price: 7/10 playability: 10/10 overall 7/10 -- (not an average) tk

0 my brother had this set, and i think it isn't the best set, but great minifigs. could use a star corps clone or 2 from the bp.

1 7153 jango fett's slave 1 review parts: 358 figs: 2 price: 20.00 (i got it on offer i think the rrp was 40) the only set to include jango fett and young boba. also the decals on jango are from fine clonier. (i'm trying to say they don't came with the set) 1. manual worn manual. random page. another random page. looking at this page you can that this set has numbered bags. back cover. look how old yodas computer looks . 2. general set and minifigs the sets contents. jango with his hair on. jango with helmet on with front view of face. twist jango's head to initiate super bounty hunter mode. jango's doubled sided head. boba. nothing to special although i think the torso and head are exclusive to the set. 3. the ship not really scaled up right as you can see. the guns can rotate. the central sections interior. not sure what this is. is it a hyperdrive or a bomb or something? there are these side panels on both sides. behind the panels. a secret compartment. trans orange minifig heads in the compartment. i think they're supposed to be saturnic charges. side storage compartment. the back of the ship. how those trans orange minifig heads fallout. there is a magnet on the inside of the ship. but for what... the secret prison which also has a magnet on the top so it can stay on but easily come out. the doors on it can lift up to put prisoners inside. 1 of 2 identical wing things. they can fold for flight mode. the controls. bottom jet thing. let me out of here! the prison is great for capturing small children. 4. overall build: 7/10 impossible to build without a hard stable surface. minifigs: 10/10 2 exclusive figs. design: 7/10 nowhere near to scale but has some nice features. parts: 8/10 good parts like that big cockpit canopy. price: 9/10 for the price i got it was pretty good especially with the figs it comes with. playability: 7/10 lots of features but it would be better if it came with a jsf. overall: 9/10 lots of features and comes with exclusive minifigs. edited by kimt, 04 august 2008 - 11:44 am. indexed

1 i have all three of the slave i ships, and i agree with kimt...although it is a very small, compact ship, the first slave i (boba fett) is still the sturdiest. the newest slave i (boba fett) is not bad, and is of much better construction than this slave i from jango fett. even though i like the size and scale of the jango slave i and the newest boba fett slave i...when you pick that very first one up, it had the feeling of....."you can throw me against the wall, drop me off the roof of your house, or let 4 two year olds play with me...i'm not gonna break!" at least thats's my opinion. good review

0 i never got the original boba fett's slave 1. i wish they would make one to scale with the minifigures. i would be so cool. i am also putting up a review of the clone turbo tank probably tomorrow. it is a different variation to the one in the index. edited by skipper 24, 03 august 2008 - 07:12 pm.

-1 personally, i hated that set. i fell apart way to easily and was just not built well.

0 thanks for the review. it looks like an interesting set, even if not as good as boba's. skipper 24, on aug 3 2008, 08:11 pm, said: i never got the original boba fett's slave 1. i wish they would make one to scale with the minifigures. i would be so cool. you mean it would be so cool? i agree that it would be, if they made a large minifig scale version like with the ucs millenium falcon. i would probably try to buy that. edited by shoc, 03 august 2008 - 08:31 pm.

1 i got the original jsf for christmas, which i might buy and review. wonderful set, the obi in this one is really awesome and it's really just a great ship, sticker free. probably my favourite, i'd fly it if any ship from star wars. maybe i should get it and the slave i from episode ii... after all, i like jango despite having a crap story.

0 very good review! i have he newest slave i and i like it more than this one. dsr

0 you added some decals to the jango figure, right ? they seem to be suffering a little. i remember buying this set from the discount tent after my first visit to legoland windsor. i wasn't sure whether to buy it, even in their sale ... but i was glad i did once i'd built it :)

0 i really want one of these, if only it wasn't expensive. i probably won't buy it because it'd be scraped for parts too quick. great review though.

0 good review. i always wanted to know how it was different to the boba fett slave i. i would probably only get this though for jango fett. the newer one looks sturdier and proportioned better imo.

1 a very nicely done review. i remember getting this slave i - it was my first large star wars set.

1 this set looks liek a good buy for $4. wish it was still around, but like you said, it needs accessories.

1 manta, on aug 3 2008, 10:33 am, said: wish it was still around. even though, little sets <$10, like the new coast guard 4wd & jet, and the quad are great little city sets. lego seems to be returning to good quality small sets with their latest city line-up. metalandi, on aug 3 2008, 10:46 am, said: i remember having this set (actually i even still have it, at least the pars are somewhere ) when i was a child, and i used it for making races, as it is there for. you should look for them and resurrect it. it really feels good after you've found all the pieces and put a set back together again (as it was when you first bought it).

0 this little set really makes my point small playable inspiration to build the set into a few other models, great set i wish i had it my town is going to need more vehicles. i really miss main model instructions with alternate build idea's.

0 i can prodly say i own this little bugger. it's not much, but it is a nice addition to the series. they are also easy to build, so you can get a rally going quite fast. stauder.

1 7261 clone turbo tank parts: 801 figs: 8 price: 70.00 (ouch! ) edit: new box pics added. my version of the set comes with a normal mace windu figure and an extra clone trooper. also the mace windu, barc trooper and jet trooper minifigs were exclusive to the set (well you could make the jet trooper yourself) . also my set came with 4 extra blasters (you'll see them later) and baby blue vent things instead of trans blue. 1.manual & box the front of the box. the box compared to the motorized at-at and the hailfire droid and dwarf spider droid. minifgs. the back which has pics of the sets functions and alternate models. inside the box it has a white cardboard divider probably for strength seeming as the box it so flimsy. pretty hefty manual. the tt manual compared to the one of the at-at ones. random shot. another random shot. poster at the back of the manual 2. general set and minifigs the whole set. i accidentally left one of the plates up when i took the pic. close up of the figs. two battle droids come with blasters and a mini turret. the republic. from l-r: jet trooper, mace windu (not lul), barc trooper, normal clone, the commander, look out. jet pack. mace's torso. barc trooper legs. barc trooper torso. he has got to be my favorite clone trooper by tlc. the mysterious commander. on lsw he was called cody (right) but he has star corps armour making him commander bly (left) . normal clone and the look out clone with electro binoculars. 3. speeder bike side view of the barc speeder. menacingish front view. (is menasingish a word?) printed back engine piece. one of my shield things came with a crumpled handle it is worse than it looks in the pic. 4. the turret the turret. it can rotate and point upwards. but what if you want to blast all those battle droids that are shorter than the height of the turret blasters... add another hinge in! that extra hinge in action. 5. the tank it's to big to get a decent side view pic johnny the cabin boy on the crows nest. front 2 seater cockpit. the 2 seats. better be careful you don't fall off your seat there are some pretty big gaps down the sides. back cockpit with dual missile launchers. the back seat. the engine. the large central storage. the turret controls fold down to lock into place so it doesn't fall out when driving. you can put 2 minifigs up top. mace and a clone driving. you can see those 4 extra blasters, 2 orange at the front of the pic and 2 between the chairs. the turret and jet trooper. barc trooper on the barc speeder. the commander on the lift chair in the back cockpit. another shot of that chair. 6. overall build: 8/10 quite enjoyable because it incorporates technic and system parts. minifigs: 9/10 on a set this size it has quite a lot including some exclusives such as the barc trooper but it could of had a droid or 2 more. design: 7/10 way out of scale but generally pretty strong due to the technic frame. parts: 7/10 lots of plates and nice minifig parts. price: 6/10 justifiable because of the amount of figs in the set. playability: 7/10 includes some cis units to fight the clones. overall:8/10 needs more droids and it could be bigger. i will also probably have a break form reviewing for now seeming as i have just put out a whole load of reviews. edited by kimt, 09 august 2008 - 08:51 pm. indexed as 7261 review 2

1 nein! you rejected lul. lul's are awesome! thanks for the review! i like the set a lot, mace is only featured here. great fig of him too, i like the grey jedi robes torso. cody is great as with the other figs. the tank's probably a second favourite, next to the mighty at-at of course.

0 did your version without the lul mace have trans blue grill things (like the ones on the back of the speeder) ? or was my set a one off.

0 hanks for the price. i got the set a while ago and couldn't remember correctly i have now changed it.

0 skipper 24, on aug 4 2008, 04:04 pm, said: did your version without the lul mace have trans blue grill things (like the ones on the back of the speeder) ? or was my set a one off. i bought mine online, thinking it was the new version but i ended up with that very lame lul fig. i just hate that fig... it's completely useless, we can't use any part of it for anything (although, i only discovered yesterday that the lightsaber blade was a standard one and not glued, as i always believed, so all isn't completely lost) in the end i still was rather disappointed by the set. it's too full of holes ( hum; i think there's kind of a paradox in that sentence...)... but the barc speeder and green clone are indeed fantastic. oh, and yes, mine came with sand blue grill parts instead of the trans-yellow ones... didn't realise it at first, and i spent half an hour cursing, thinking they forgot to put them in the box. but in the end, i don't know if the replacements are any better , since they're supposed to represent some kind of thruster light or something... all in all, i think it's my worst set... not necessarily for the set itself which is ok, but psychologically, there's too many things that went wrong with it...

1 nice review again, skipper. i passed on this one because of the price, but it's a nice set. good for you for getting the newer version with non-lul mace and an extra clone. that purple blade sure is a beauty. the tank itself is alright, just an at-at on wheels, in my opinion. the turret is great, though, and so is the speeder bike. i didn't realize that the jet pack had two "nailguns" (harpoon guns) on it. i thought that the nailgun was a new piece... but the jetpack is very cool.

1 the kid, on aug 4 2008, 08:20 am, said: i got the original version of this set with the luls mace windu figure. when tlc released the non-luls version i managed to swap - they sent me the new version (and a clone trooper iirc) and i mailed them back the old version. this was a great set; the suspension worked great and it rolled magnificently. nice review with good photos, but again your price is a little off: 69.99 is the rrp (unless the price you paid was 80). tk that was a great idea. i never even thought to send it back and get the new one with the other clone and the non lul windu.

0 thanks for the review kimt. i gave this "above average". i believe i had this one, but it was so long ago... i'm still a bit freaked out by the yellow ones! when i emerged from my dark ages i kept thinking "gee, i miss the people packs", but now that i have over 500 mini-figures i don't feel that way anymore. even so, i wish they would re-release some of the classic old ones.

0 i wonder why this set had no blue or black astronauts? whatever the case, i always loved the small minifig sets that lego released, as i could never get enough astronauts. my favorite was the set of futuron astronauts. why would the yellow astronauts freak you out, sinner? is it because they look nekkid? ;-)

0 lol, i don't know what's going on there!

1 7674 v-19 torrent number of pieces: 471 number of minifigs: 1 price: 49.99 the v-19 torrent starfighter was an assault fighter with exceptional speed and maneuverability used by the galactic republic during the clone wars.it was a predecessor of the alpha-3 nimbus-class v-wing starfighter, in terms of purpose and usage. it first appeared in the genndy tartakovsky?s clone wars 2d series. basics box front: the box art shows the torrent flying above tatooine, with the new blue and white ?clone wars?? style packaging, box back: the back shows some of the features of the set including the lifting mechanism and adverts for 7679 republic gunship, 7675 at-te and the 7673 magnaguard starfighter inside the box, there are 2 instruction books, a very small dss and 9 bags that are not numbered. bags: instruction books random manual shot parts list book one is mainly the construction of the body and one of the engines, book 2 is the other engine and the wings. for better pics of the manual look on lego's website. sticker sheet: a very small sticker sheet is included, which includes 2 republic insignias and a nose sticker. minifigure one minifigure is included, a clone pilot. the whole "omg only one minifigure in this set" and "its not movie accurate, i hate you tlc!!!11one2" has been beaten to death, so please don't make this review turn into that and to be honest i don't care because its an awesome figure. tlc have made the effort to print the life support device onto the chest plate so props to them. he has the "clone head" like the rest of the clones have in the cw releases, there are no extra clone bits apart from a long blaster, that's not included here. interesting/other pieces printed piece! rare/unusual pieces: there are 2 pistons included, as well as 2 weird looking technic pieces that serve as the landing gear during the build. which might explain why the set is quite expensive, it musn't have been cheap to manufacture them. the build it starts off relatively simple, the first 16 steps is getting the basic shape of the cockpit and the mechanism to make the middle wing move up and down. after that the next few steps are getting the landing gear/wing folding device done, it's actually the same thing so when the wings move into attack mode the landing gear retracts. this is then locked into place by the white beams that form the basic shape of the fuselage. up to step 46 is the fuselage, as well as fitting the hydraulics. this is what it looks like when the fuselage is complete. the cockpit is not "air tight", there's is quite a big gap top: bottom: the final few steps of book 1 is the construction of one of the engines, here it is attatched : the yellow bar is not permanent, its used to keep the white bit at the top from moving downwards. the steps are repeated in the second book so that both engines are now in on to the wings! first one attatched, the middle one is attached now: and finally the last one: it is now finished! the pieces that are left: so, you're probably wondering, how does it enter attack mode? well can you see this bar? push that bar to the center, and pick it up, the hydraulics move the central wing downwards as well as the side wings to enter attack mode: the outer wings have flickfire missiles on them, they obviously don't work, but it increases the playability of the set. the cockpit opens in a similar way to general grevious's starfighter released last year, using a sliding mechanism for other pics see here : http://s25.photobuck...eview/?start=20 and i'll be taking other requests for pics, maybe a video of it switching between modes. build: 7/10 very symmetrical build, the mechanism to move the wings might annoy some people. minifigs: 5/10 1 fig in a 50 set, however it is a starfighter design: 9/10 very accurate to the source material, lego have really made the effort to make the movement feature work. parts: 8/10 lots of technic, white and dark red pieces price: 7/10 could be slightly cheaper, playability: 6.5/10 need to buy some enemy sets to get the most of it, flick fires don't work. comments, requests, questions and criticisms welcome. edited by kimt, 04 august 2008 - 06:48 pm. indexed and poll added

0 erhm... where's the review? it would be nice to have a few pics of the v-19 itself and a few comments on it. could you please add that? kimt

0 i'm still reviewing it, the internet broke half way through it

1 first, thanks simonjedi for a great review. i'm interested in what you think of the hydrolics. i could spend hours just deploying and undeploying the wings and landing gear. i'm a little worried, the very first batch of the hydrolic piece for, umm, i think it was the off-road 4x4 technic set, was very fragile and broke after a few uses. these seem to be holding up but i'm anxious to see if they hold up after 100-200 uses. quote name='walter kovacs' date='aug 4 2008, 11:47 am' post='337841'] those black pieces used on the landing gear look very bionicle-like. if they haven't been used before, i'd suspect they will be. not that i'm a bionicle expert or anything. [/quote] right you are. they are bionicle bohrok head pieces. so pretty old in bionicle terms and fairly useless in my opinion but they do make interesting looking landing gear as i deploy and redeploy the wings and landing gear. hopefully, we'll get a pilot in the battle pack to help mitigate the fact we only get one here. -tohst

0 the printed part isn't new it came with 10178 motorized at-at walker. also nice review, i would get the set if it was a little cheaper or came with more than 1 fig. whyhas it got 2 instruction books the set isn't particularly big?

1 thanks for the review. i've added it to the index and added a poll in which members can vote their opinion on this set. i think this is a very good set. i like the colours and the very playable feature that allows the wings to lock in attack formation. now all i need is to buy this baby. edit: i gave it an above average rating, since it's well designed, looks sturdy and fits the sw theme sets perfectly.

1 the v-19 was my first tcw set. i buyed it, when i was visiting my father. i just wanted to build it there, and i do so. but how do you will get sth.big like this with in the train?? so i had to destroy him. when i was still home again, i had to build it 3 times, because the mechanic dont works i only can say that the v-19 is one of the best tcw sets. thanks to you for the review simonjedi , i just wanted to make one in german. but now i needn`t to make it

1 the ability for it to fold in and out of attack position has wowed me. this is my top priority now. thanks for making up my mind.

0 rayman, on oct 4 2008, 11:11 pm, said: hydraulic wings! i am very impressed and am now considering getting this set purely because of this funciton. i am just curious as to know why are there sand green parts on the bottom of the v-19. is it visible when the model is completed? i am also pleased to see tlc giving us a printed cockpit computer this time around. while i do like the functions and they way it is built, i cannot get into this model. first the price is a bit steep. i know all the cw sets are expensive but this one just seems more so to me. i mean there is only 1 fig in here. second to me, there is no playability or display-ability. i gave below average.

-1 in addition to my last comment am i correct in saying that the left over yellow technic part was merely to hold parts together while building? edited by skipper 24, 10 october 2008 - 09:10 pm.

-1 i built mine today. as soon as i tried to put it in attack position, the thingy rotates the wrong way and it falls apart. what a waste of $55

0 rayman, on nov 29 2008, 10:16 pm, said: yes i believe that the yellow technic is only used for the building. however i didn't find it neccessary. what a strange step... its to hold the wing connectors in the the same place while the wing is being attached.

0 actually we should care that there's only one fig in it since it's kind of expensive (though that's my opinion) , but the ship is really awesome . it's too bad there's not a battlepack that includes clone pilots. edited by bricklanta, 30 november 2008 - 06:15 am.

1 i love this set and i gave it "outstanding". i might note though that the cylinder is just there as a dampener; when disenegaged the wing function still works, just not as smoothly. interestingly though the cylinder is an old piece, (i have a few others) it's just that this is the first time it's been used without a spring... i had no problems assembling this set.

1 having just bought myself a copy of the wonderful metroliner (4558) i felt like doing a review. before we start i'd like to thank greenhair for selling me one of his metroliners for a mere 80 euros. granted, the motor, "trainstation" and tracks weren't included but i did get an extra railcar instead. - * (please note that i have included the fourth wagon in the final pic but that the official set includes just three wagons.) the metroliner was released in 1992 and was extremely popular amongst lego fans. the set a picture of the box showing the set completely. (pic taken from peeron) and one of the minifigs and the accessories.: as you may notice, tlc was extremely generous, supplying us with a grand total of 11 minifgs amongst which no less than 4 female minifigs. ah, the population crisis is finally over we also have three suitcases, three cups and a small freight parcel and freight handling thingy. normally this would include two bicycles; a red and a black one. a general side view of the three carriages. (thanks to greenhair and the brickster) and here's one of the extra carriage. (thanks to greenhair and the brickster) moving onto the front and back carriage, which are externally identical. please note that greenhair changed my back carriage's headlights. these would be yellow in the normal set. all the doors in the entire set are printed pieces. (sorry for the bad picture quality in this one) the interior of the two however is laid out a bit differently. the space in the front carriage is occupied by a cockpit (or whatever it is called in trains) and some space to store your cable connecting the front lights with the engine. i can imagine it must get quite cramped and dangerous for the minifig driver with all the cabling. further back we have a quite random, weird looking engine. one part reminded me rather of a jet engine on a commercial airplane. the engine is accessible by means of the two side cargo doors. at the end of our first carriage we hit what looks like the train's restaurant, two tables and no chairs. the two middle carriages are identical, both have a small sink nicely hidden from the intervening and impolite looks of fellow passengers. the carriage further contains two tables and four seats. two cargo spaces are nicely tucked away from view below the tables. our final carriage has a back cockpit as well but differs from the front carriage in the central cargo area - where our train employee is hard at work earning his lego nickels - and the rear sleeping area. the bed is a double one, the upper one able to be flipped up for somewhat difficult access to the lower one. the train station i could not take photos off since it was not included in the purchase. judging from the building plans however i feel it was thrown in at the end just to add 'something' to the set. its construction is very simple, consisting of a few grey plates on top of a few pillars. access is provided by a plate which is connected to the platform with a few hinges. there are however two lamp posts, a timetable and a few chairs so if you don't like the platform you can still use these parts in a variety of other constructios. to end off i took a pic of the complete set (with extra wagon) and a friendly surprised train driver opening the door and greeting the camera man. conclusion being a '90s set, the train basically builds itself. the entire build cost me two hours and a half (i lost quite some time simply admiring the set) and was extremely straightforward with no suprises at all, but i need to admit it has its charm. the exterior is simply amazing. the sleekness of the design, the colours, it matches perfectly! i believe however that a width of 8 studs would be more to scale but 6 wide still looks amazing. the interior is somewhat simplistic but is easily moddeable with a few extra pieces. i basically bought the train as a parts pack. the standard set (three wagons) includes no less than 8 train doors with windows, 14 train windows, 4 smaller longer ones and 4 freight doors. the front and back of course count as unique pieces as well. one feature i am displeased with are the printed doors. i like printed pieces and while the blue-white-red stripe looks beautiful on the side the printed doors kind of limit mocing capabilities to carriages with a stripe on the side. i considered simply removing the stripe but i found out i could just get normal grey ones from bricklink for a fair price. i am very pleased with the train but since you already know my opinion, feel free to tell us yours of this fabulous set! edited by thebrickster, 09 july 2009 - 01:51 pm. poll question was not multiple choice, switched to radio group

1 i remember to literally jump of joy when my grand-father offered it to me for christmas... it's an amazing set, the train is really beautiful and it comes with 11 (!) mfs, so can somebody ask for more?

1 oh ruben you lucky so and so this set is one of the most beautful i have ever seen! splendid looking build and 11 figures, all the same faces like but still you get that old woman pig-tail head piece which is just great! i thought you meant the monorail set when you told me about this but guess i was wrong (don't laugh i've been away from lego for quite some time) and for 80 euros it was a real bargain from a great friend! really nice review hope this sets brings you years of joy!

1 cool review. i actually have two of these. i got one for christmas when it was rereleased in 2003 and another one in a charity shop a few months later for 5. i love the minifigs even if they all have smileys, and having two sets of them can really fill up a town.

1 it's great to see someone reviewing a train! this set is definately a five! lego hasn't made a complete train set like this in a long time. the metroliner is really a legend among classic trains. the great level of playability and detailing makes it a terrific model. specifically, i was just noticing the details of the passenger car. it has a sink! - how cool is that? and 11 minifigs - when was the last time lego included 11 figs in a single set? a truly outstanding train set. thanks for sharing images as i've always wanted to see it up-close. it would be awesome if you could share some single side shots of the cars.

1 i'm not normally that big into trains but this set has a real coolness factor that sets it apart from most of the others. the color scheme is the same one that amtrak and many local subway systems use. i picked it up along with the club car expansion when they were re-released in 2001. i have made various modifications to mine, rearranging the car layouts and adding a second train motor into the rearmost car along with another set of lights, so that both ends light up. as you said, it would be great to have an 8-stud version of this, so you could fit in two rows of seats side by side. that might make a nice mod project at some point.

1 outstanding train set. the legend of the entire train series, is the metroliner. this is a "super 5" set. the color, design, minifigs is just so perfect and lovely. it resemble the trains which we see on our rails in our daily life. i can't find any flaws on this at all. the only flaw i noticed is my mistake of not able to buy this set at all. in fact, i had never seen this set in the shops before in my entire life. thebrickster, on aug 5 2008, 09:23 am, said: how cool is that? and 11 minifigs - when was the last time lego included 11 figs in a single set? there is another set fufil the criteria above, which is also a well known legend. it has 12 minifigs which is the 10159 city airport aka century skyway airport.

1 ahh, the good old train theme. how i wish tlg would make such great trains today, now that the quality of city sets has improved so much. that really brings back memories, even if i didn't have this one, but a cargo train that came out about the same time period, maybe plus a few years. i don't have any trains myself at the moment, mostly because i'm afraid i haven't got enough space to put in on display with all the rails and stuff.

1 this is a great review of a great set, hairy ruben! i voted for outstanding since the only thing you can say about this train set is that it is outstanding. it has been the best passenger train in all the time from lego's beginning on until now. i bought the rereleased version of it in 2003 - and i really, really do not regret it! klaus-dieter

1 i also voted "outstanding", for the simple reason that i've owned this set for a long time, but for most of the time it's been an anonymous heap of bricks mixed with all the other bricks i have. so about a year ago i started rebuilding it, and it now sits proudly next to (also rebuilt) 2150 on my shelf. imo; it's an excellent set, best of the 9v passenger trains, no doubt. and it combines the best of the 80's trains with that of the 90's - it's not some futuristic panorama-glassed low-slung train, but an honest, realistic-looking train that captures many of the features that passenger trains used to (and in some cases; still) have.

0 i don't like the set and i do like the set. the reason why i like it: it looks good. the reason why i hate it: this train was the first train for the new 9v system and it means to me the end of the beautiful 12v series. for this last reason i own this set. i voted average. only strange they named it metroliner. in holland when we speak of a metro, i need to think at short distance trains only used in big cities like rotterdam. and your minifigs at pic ain't right according the instruction .

1 my favourite, favourite, favourite old set. it's too bad i was born 2 years after its release, i would have had a major interest in classic town. i might actually get this one on bricklink... not that it'll go for a good price (i'll only buy if it does you see). an "outstanding", a highly useful and well-made set that really just stands out from its counterparts. edit: nevermind. edited by dovchenko, 16 august 2008 - 10:25 am.

1 super review, thanks. simply put, i'd have to admit this is one of the best indy sets. and in such a small package. it's a very detailed lil' jeep, and that's why i like it. i have this too, but i don't want to open it since it's exclusive. wait, i thought we were calling it "rown" and not "frown"

1 nice review hinckley. i just got mine as well by paying quite a high price for it since its exclusive to us. however, i had not opened it yet and i left it in my friend's car. i gave it for an above average for that cool little jeep. for an exclusive brickmaster set, this is certainly one of the best vehicles i had ever seen. i like its construction built. if this is ever released in the main stream, i am sure it will be a hit to get a small sized indiana jones set.

1 outstanding set and review, thanks for presenting it! i've had this since it first came out, but didn't think it would be that impressive, so i didn't bother opening it. now, i'm tempted. aside from the slight size issue, i can't find anything here to gripe about, except for the limited availability. i want 5. i think that makes me a parts monkey. eek eek. you're exactly right about this selling like mad. it's another one of those missed opportunities for tlg. sure, it's nice to get people to subscribe by offering it as part of brickmaster, but in the long run, put it in the stores for $6 and sell a million. just give us indy's manbag, we need it for postal employees and such. as is the running joke whenever i comment on one of your reviews, i'd give this a solid 985. not out of anything, just 985. or, in clearer terms: + 1/2 (though i voted 5)

1 nice review! i would like to get this set... unfortunately i don't get brickmaster mag, and the prices on bl/ ebay will most likely be ridiculous. i wonder why indy doesn't come with his murse (man purse) in this set? thats the best part of the fig. the jeep itself is very nice, especially with the dark green. by the way, what is frown? brownish... something, i guess. oh yeah, and funny comic.

1 looks really nice, if they keep making bm sets like this, i might actually subscribe... nice comic too, remind me not to run into copmike and his gloveless hand...

1 thanks for this great review hinckley! i agree with you this set has to be released as normal set. i just recognized how clever the building technique is, you couldn't see that on the packaging shots we got before. hopefully i'm able to grab this off ebay or somewhere else sometime!

1 surprisingly well designed set for lego overlords... i mean brickmasters!

1 thanks for the good review ! i cant wait for mine to arrive! and just think how close paulc was in his reverse building of this which turned into a event exclusive in billund ! he was just wrong on the color of the headlight bricks (black instead of frown) and the rear bumper stuff which couldnt be seen on the bag picture! kudos paulc! as for my badass patrol car and the sop (standard operation procedure) of cavity searches theres more to see here over at brickzone - heres a teaser: copmike

1 6804 surface rover review set#: 6804 set name: surface rover released: 1984 pieces: 16 minifigs: 1 (white classic space minifig) brickshelf gallery peeron.com bricklink brickset.com introcomment: i have to keep my fondness for space going and since i'm no fan of the still "new" life on mars mars mission theme, i've decided to give you another review of a small classic space set. more to come in the following days. the box. unfortunately i haven't got the box for this set. but peeron.com was kindly enough to support me with a proper pic. and as usual this is a small easily brought home sized box. oddly tlg doesn't add the "flip" on top anymore. i remember standing in toystores, pulling 6 or more sets down from the hanger before accesing the one i wanted. it gave buying lego sets that threasure hunting touch. [snaps out of his daydreaming]... a small box with a picture of what you get. i've got no rear pic, so i can't tell if tlg did the same as on the 6701 set (split up the inventory). the fig: one single white classic space minifig. this is the worst one in my opinion. i never liked those white guys. and they get easily damaged by the sun. nah! give me a red or yellow instead (later blue or black). the surface rover: both i am the lucky owner of two of them. (yes this is a small showoff ) side though small, i still think this is a neat little set. compared to the modern "impulse" sets, this is high competable. i like the simplicity of the small classic space sets and this is no exception. the sr is made from very usable bricks, that can easily be used for making ship/base/craft mocs. rear as you can see, one of them has been used for surface exploration for many years. it could do with some replacements, but i haven't had the time, yet. the verdict: a fine little classic set. not much more than that. it holds some useful bricks and worked fine as an "impulse" back then. the classic children's birthday presents during the early 80's. i got quite a few space and town sets back then. remember to vote your opinion on this set. i gave it "average" for the bricks, the price (back then) and as an all in all conclusion. kimt

-1 i voted below average since i'm not a big fan of classic space.

1 thanks for this review, if you'd only know what memories you brought back! i think i remember this set better than any other i had, when i was a child. some time after i got it, i decided to disassemble it and combine it with the jeep from 6552 rocky river retreat. it came out pretty good, though. as it became the main attraction point of my town (beeing the car of my favourite minifig back then, and, and, and... looong story ), i kept it assembled that way from this day on until earlier this year, when i finally disassembled it because i needed the parts. edited by metalandi, 06 august 2008 - 03:57 am.

1 a nice set to go with the outback theme. i am kind of dissapointed they they didint continue the theme, as i only managed to grab 6487 and 6550, none the less, this set is very interesting as it's one of the few to feature working suspention. stauder.

1 great review brickster why exactly did the outback, adventure etc. themes never quite catch on......just a thought. what a great set! i wish i had it, but in 1997 i was just back from my whirl wind trips around the world and had drifted away from lego i don't know why. but i will say this i love the actual suspension that came with this set and the trains sets i have been trying to buy up as much of it as i can, and now i see i need to add one more set to the "i need to get that"

1 nice review of an interesting set. but i have a query... anyone know why it is actually called amazon crossing when it's meant to be in australia? also, the amazon runs through a jungle anyway. edited by shoc, 10 august 2008 - 03:44 pm.

1 nice review. this set looked very nice for it's time.

1 oh i loved this set when i was young! i think i got it for my birthday, and it was one of my favourite sets at the time. funnily enough, i was thinking about it the other day, and how i really should build it again... thanks for the nostalgic review.

0 ok, this is the big one. the controversial one. the one everyone either hates or defends... what do i think? read on. the figs: bandana man masked dude dude with shades good figures, i miss scarface. comes with his torso, though, which is my favorite (the one with the ammo strap across the chest). one figure short of the figure-to-price value, but we can deal with that. the dino: the dino. it's the one that comes with the chopper, in green. any questions? the tank: and so it begins. i think it looks a lot better in person than on the box. the left side. good time to mention that the treads run pretty easily, and this is a very playable set. right side. keep an eye on that flap in the center... ... and we have a folding ladder! the back. probably the weakest point of the set, apart from the dino. the turret, turned and tilted. the mechanism works extremely well, and the gun seems to work better than others for some reason (or maybe it just seems that way). the front of the cockpit. i'm at a loss trying to figure out how those tiny windshields defend them against 40-foot mutant tyrannosaurus rexes with radioactive breath, laser eyes, and what have you... anyway, another one of those neat steering wheels, some viking horns, and some stickered control panels (oh yeah, this set has a good amount of stickers. probably around 20-ish.). the back of the cockpit. i love the little gun, it turns 360 degrees and tilts up. oh yeah, and those green barrels they've been using are awesome, i can think of tons of uses for them. the verdict: 7.6/10 playability: 9.4/10 pieces: 7.5/10 figures: 8.8/10 dino: 3/10 value: 4/10 the main downfall of this set is the price. i would easily pay $30 for this, no questions asked. but $40 was a hard sell for me - i gave in merely to see what i would think of it, and also to help you guys find out the same. this is a great display set, and a great play set. the pieces are good - lots of nice blay beams used in the construction. but the price, people. that's the killer. pick this up only if you have everything else or you find it on clearance. and thus ends my dino attack review series. hope you enjoyed them! until next time, bloody jay

1 very interesting indeed! i especially like the folding ladder. i never thought of making such a clever function. i might have to use it in my future lego models. another great reveiw bloody jay! ;)

1 sam89, on aug 5 2005, 01:33 pm, said: thanks for the reviews once again. it looks like qite a nice set to me, although the european version will lose the big gun. i like some of the stickers (although i wish they were printed), and i actually quite like the dinosaur. i probably won't get it though, the set i'm most likely to get is the fire hammer. yay!!! some one that agrees with me!!!!!!!!! >-|

0 this is an ok set....

0 this is my first review, so i thought: the smaller (the set), the better! 6626 snowmobile year: 2000 subtheme: arctic pieces: 20 (+1 extra) note: polybag; 6577 is the boxed version price: .1 + s/h on ebay misp (mint in sealed polybag!) building time: less than 2 minutes. if it came out in the last months, if would be called an impulse set. it actually came out a few years ago; being those my "dark years", i missed the arctic line. now that i'm back into business, i wanted some! but not all of the sets were good (or easily available). i had the chance to buy this one, and i0'm happy with it. as you can see below, it consists of a figure on a scooter; the only accessories are those chainsaws that lie on the sides (unless you take the skis from the scooter and have the minifig wear them!). the extra piece is a transyellow 1x1 round plate. according to brickset and peeron, the difference between box and polybag is the sticker "sheet". you choose whether the nose is better with or without the sticker: i'd say "with". the judgement: it's cheap, it has a cool minifig with a cool head accessory and a nice torso. i don't think i like that orange colour that much (and i can't understand why those blue pieces have to be... blue; i guess it's beacuse the whole line uses blue with orange!), but i have to say this is definetely a good set. i'd give it a 4 out of 5 in its category. if you want to own at least a set per every theme, this could be your arctic one. packaging: content: minifig (i hear you ask: what's that yellow thing on the left leg? dust, or something alike): the snowmobile: edited by the cobra, 07 august 2008 - 02:33 pm.

1 nice review cobra. thanks for sharing. i think arctic was one of those neat themes that never really took off. i like these little poly-bag sets as they make great starters/introduction sets for themes (or) serve as a nice supplement or add/on to an existing collection. i've always liked the thick green hood piece used in the arctic theme and have thought about using it in a sw hoth scene. in any case, nice review! i've got an arctic set that i built recently and will share a review soon.

1 here we are, my first clone wars set, and my first star wars review. here we have the wonderful droid gunship, one of the cheaper of the clone wars sets. this set is exclusive to wal-mart, and its one of the better exclusives out there (i'm looking at you, twilight ). first off we have a shot of the entire set with the box. a random page shot, along with pics of the parts list. the build is split up into three sections: the back, the cockpit, and the missles. the back has a lot of nice dark blue plates, and is the only part of the set which uses stickers. the bottoms shows various technic systems, which i'll get to later the cockpit has many details (mostly guns), and the rotating guns are a nice touch. the cockpit can fit a battle droid, but not a minifig. i'm not sure why a droid would want leather though the last part is loading this baby with the missles there are four black(small) and two dark bley (large) missles which are loaded in groups of three as sls. the middle mechanism is for the missiles, and the back part with the bionicle teeth are used ad landing gear the knob on top turns... to release the missiles on the clones ... leftover bits and the used ss(not so d this time around) the gunship versus a time traveling agent charge . overall build: 8/10 a basic build, but at some points repetitive. minifigs: 10/10 just your basic droids, you can't go wrong. design: 7/10 a basic design, with some interesting techniques. pieces: 9/10 a mix of old and new pieces, along with the return of this lovely piece which hasn't been seen for almost 10 years price: 8/10 $30 for a gunship? i'll take it! final verdict: 8/10 a great price for a small set like this, and it has a great bit of swooshability

1 nice review agentrick.$30 is a good price, but tlc think thats 40 so i'll have to pass. btw i thought this ship was supposed to hold many droids like in sw battlefront. oh well, its good for show. edited by skinny boy, 09 august 2008 - 09:31 pm.

-1 i'm confused there's two topics of this . anyway allon-sy,nice review i quite like this set i'd buy it if it had just 2 plain clones please tlg how are we supposed to army-build!!! edited by foxy, 08 august 2008 - 12:59 am.

1 so it comes with an extra gun-holding arm? it looks like it, and that's great. that way you can make all of the droids gun-totting ones.

0 what? my st came up as the first post....

1 this is a very nice looking set. it could do with a few more clones, but hopefully that will be fixed next year with battle packs. back to the set, i think the colors on this are great (i love dark blue) and the design is pretty good too. it seems to be pretty accurate compared to the real thing. thanks for the review!

0 my one post was deleted, so i shall remake it: thanks for the review! i really want this set! and i will get it. as kim said, perhaps it could be taken in sunlight?

-1 i don't really like this set because it isn't my idea of the droid gunship, which is from sw battlefront, which can hold as many droids as a rgs can hold clones. if i buy this, it'd be for the dark blue pieces, which is the signature color of one of my castle nations ( dark red and dark blue ).

-1 this is a great set it's too pricey though if it was $10 or so cheaper i'd get it!

1 emergency evac set #: 6445 theme: town res-q year released: 1998 piece count: 97 minifigs: 1 list price: $8 (usd) in 1998, lego introduced a new theme called res-q. the theme was really a quasi-coast guard sub-theme of classic town. the theme included boats, helicopters, emergency vehicles, and even a water hovercraft. most notable was the black and yellow color combination that predominated the sets. i only picked up a couple of sets from the theme including this emergency evacuation vehicle that i consider a van. i never got into the theme, but looking back at these sets, i have gained a better appreciation for their value in classic town. let's take a look at 6445 in greater detail. starting with the box: the back of the box providing a few alternate models: and similar imagery on the instructions: the set includes one small sheet of decals for the van: 6445 has one res-q minifig that i find pretty nice. i like the neon orange reflectors: he has a nice printed backside with the word res-q prominently displayed: this little set includes an abundance of tools: a black walkie-talkie is not pictured here's the emergency van: i like the back section that has a nice winch with turning wheel and a few hooks for tools: here's the minifig pulling the grappling hook for some res-q action. this is my favorite part of this set: the van isn't too fancy but has some neat features: while i like the blue windshield piece for maybe space sets, i'm not really fond of its use for the van: the van has no steering wheel, but rather two levers for steering: on the top of the vehicle are two emergency alarms and some extra lights: the back of the van has a large opening piece that allows wide access to the back section: it comfortably fits a long gurney/stretcher: here's the driver resting on the gurney: he should never have tried to pick up the gurney without a 2nd res-q minifig. and a shot of the back section without the gurney: lastly, a picture of the complete set: final thoughts res-q is really a neat theme that has great play value for kids. while it's not one of my more favorite town sub-themes, it does offer some nice pieces and an abundance of black and yellow pieces. i think a few of the res-q sets go nicely with the divers theme released one year earlier in 1997. i had a chance to purchase the largest set of the theme, 6479 emergency response center, at half the price, but passed back in the late 90s. i'd be interested in finding out what other eb members think of this set and the res-q theme.

1 wow, and people complain that a military type line would be to violent. here we have half dead soilders and a space shuttle bombing people with severed skeleton heads! i have to say this is the first time i've heard of this theme. i like the colors as most have pointed out. the base plate is preety cool two. could use it to moc up some garages.

-1 i am a proud owner of this set. like others, i got it discounted and couldn't resit the parts pack. this is the type of lego sets that bothers me. when you look at it now, you'd be tempted to say "hey not bad", but at the same time, some years ago, it wasn't good enough to buy it full price. i was kinda disappointed because usually sets using that kinda baseplates are excellent (castle, paradisa), and this one is just "ok". one really minus point would be the lack of any opponent faction in the set

0 thanks for the review pmj . i like the play value in this set even if i dont own it . the way the orbs are put into the rocket is awesome and i really like it, but at the end the set have some lack of detail .

0 set: 7680 - the twilight theme: star wars year released: 2008 piece count: 882 price: $aud149.99 (or $159.99 if you buy at tru!), 99.99 euro, $us99.99 pity the twilight. when rumours of the set name first circulated, speculation was swift: 'twilight - that suggests something sleek, elegant and mysterious.' anticipation mounted! fan-frenzy grew! finally a pic leaked! and the verdict was... 'clunk-a-dunk' it appeared that in the jedi off-season, anakin was running something that looked like an intergalactic garbage scow, like roger wilco in the old sierra space quest pc games. blocky and bley seemed to sum it up. the set went from being one of the most anticipated to one of the least liked of 2008 pretty much instantly. it's a mark of that dislike that in the eb clone wars review feeding frenzy nobody has so far even bothered to post a few pics of this set even 2 weeks after it's official release! i'm here to redress that imbalance now and find out if 7680 is as horrendous as everyone originally thought part 1: box & parts front of the box. it's quite big, same size as the 10144 sandcrawler. annoyingly, it's the old style with the perforated corners that you have to tear to flip open the lid. detail of the back, showing set functions: interior of the box - a lot of wasted space. the set comes with 2 instruction manuals, each 76 pages. and no dss sheet! polybags! 13 of 'em. like the other cw sets, these are unnumbered. parts ahoy! you can tell at a glance that this set is comparable to the at-te, although there a large proportion of the 800+ parts here are technic pins and bley plates. part 2: minifigs and build the set comes with 4 figs (or 3.5, depending on how you look at rotta ): anakin, ahsoka, r2-d2 and rotta. very disappointing that there's nothing new here for such a high-priced exclusive, although i guess it is maybe movie accurate. anyway, to paraphrase the wise patsy stone, you can never have enough hats, shoes or new anakin/ ahsoka hairpieces so it's not too bad. pics of the build in progress. a quarter of the way through we can already see that this is one of those 'convoluted technic frames with some plates affixed' type builds: half-way and the smaller wing is added: at the three quarter mark the giant single wing is added: and voila! done! the final quarter is a race to attach all the exterior surfaces and details such as the engine and escape pod. the build itself is a mixed blessing. it is very technic oriented. i'm not a technic-ally minded person and don't really have much of a conceptual grasp of how everything functions until i see the final result, so i find these type of builds a little uninteresting. pins, axles and beams? give me bricks any day! i really liked the 7676 gunship and the 7679 fighter tank although they do contain some technic framework, they are largely brick-built ships, especially the fighter tank which is solid, largely brick built and full of neat functions. the 7680 build is one of the most technicy builds i've ever undergone in a system set, akin to the experience of building the 10178 motorised at-at. but whereas with that set you could understand the need for a technic framework (the thing walks!) a lot of this seemed excessive. yes, the twilight does some have nice functions, and it is so large and heavy it does need a strong skeleton, but to me it just seemed too much and aesthetics have been sacrificed for (in some cases limited) functionality. i will discuss in more detail what i mean as i look at different parts of the set. on the upside, this is the only non-symmetric set in the cw range, so at least every page and new step brings something different! part 3: a closer view close-up of the main body of the ship: front-on. it is well-designed how the figs appear in line of sight (unlike the 6211 where jabba and leia were photoshopped in to the box art). don't ask what rotta is doing out of the line of vision there. some things are better left unsaid. side view, showing escape pod (smaller cylinder) and drive: top view: rear view, showing back door. the rear deck is huge. indeed, the whole ship is huge. oddly so. i don't know if this is movie-scale or not, but i've seen people complain the fighter tank is too big (!) and that set is nothing compared to this baby! it's wider than the gunship and in wingspan and length is almost bigger. here's a few pics next to an mtt for comparison. pretty big, hey? turning to the dark side must be good for business. even if all you can buy is a rusty old beast like this, at least you could comfortably squash pretty much every vehicle in the opposing fleet just by landing on it. at least now you can see why it costs so much. the official pics make it look smaller, somehow, by truncating the rear and wing. the ship is in fact so big you can't really pose it with wings open - only hold it that way. i was too lazy to build a giant trans-clear support strut so propped it up on a shoebox instead. the wing opens very neatly - you push a technic lever and a pin holding the bottom wing pops out quite smoothly. the little top turret can move up and down as well to get the full cross-shaped effect. part 4: features and functions the front cockpit folds down very neatly, although i find the build here a little weak. whee! it goes all the way down to the floor. the mechanism is cool, but it takes up an awful lot of space. basically the whole front is cockpit and all lego could manage for controls is 2 printed 1x2 tiles as well (not pictured here, but they're attached to the part that folds up and down). there's also no way for anyone to get in or out of the cockpit. and an invisible windscreen! technology has come a long way. side view, looking from wing. r2d2 is here as well as some tools. you can also glimpse here one of the main problems with the set. despite being a huge boxy ship, there's no interior! none! the twilight doesn't even have an internal floor. all the room inside is taken up by the landing gear which folds up - again, a clever function but it really gets in the way of the set as a whole. kudos to the designer for coming up with stable, working landing gear, but too clever by half if it means that this giant ship ends up basically being one tiny cockpit and a rear door at the back that doesn't lead to any interior! underside showing landing gear when open: and closed - when the wing is folded down, the gear is locked in place, which is pretty neat. space-consuming, but neat. the rear section. the door, when opened, reveals an orange cupboard and a tow-line, as ahsoka uses in the box art. the door clicks into place when open and can be released by pressing the technic bit at the top. again, clever, but pointless as you can't get inside! ahsoka can indulge in a little recreational bungee-jumping if she so wishes: the rear deck is so large that it is wasted just being used so ahsoka can bungee-jump. i came up with a much better use for it. outdoor garden! despite having one roboticised hand, anakin was still quite the green thumb. and his light-saber was very useful as a hedge trimmer. so much so that he set up a side business between rotta-rescue missions. here's a promotional postcard: a few other bits and pieces. the gun turret on the enormous mega-wing can only hold one flick fire missile at a time (you do get two, though ) rear engine detail: the escape pod sits neatly on the side and is basically built the same way as the gunship bacta tank: the pod sits on these tehcnic pins and is held in place by the light bley parts: part 5: in conclusion the twilight is a huge ship, with a huge amount of great functions - folding wing, folding cockpit, rear door, escape pod, retractable landing gear! but this functionality comes at a price - a very complex technic build and zip interior. compared with the gunship, for example, which is stuffed with nooks and crannies, the twilight suffers in this respect. i also think it is just too large - it doesn't really fit with the other craft and vehicles released with the clone wars line. i may be wrong and it is movie-accurate, but when you have all the cw sets laid out it does stick out like a poor thumb. part selection is ok, with the only interesting things being a few dark orange plates, the orange cupboard and the big trans-neon green radar dish. don't get me wrong, i don't think this is a bad set at all. it's just the other cw sets are so sweet! i would say it's an above average set in a field crammed with excellent ones. if you're a completist, buy it, but if for example you'd rather invest in another at-te to upgrade your republic army, then i couldn't really disagree with you either and to finish on a light note, i'd like to remind you that you do get another ahsoka hairpiece, which can be used for all sorts of things. ugha warrior upgrade: dr inferno hair transplant: and finally, attack of the deadly blue-ringed octopus, native to australia's beaches and oceans! thanks for reading!

0 another outstanding review by the "awesome set reviewer"! i enjoyed reading this review very much and i felt that you have redress twilight in an approriate manner. i have very mixed feeling about this set especially with its design. it seemed i will need to watch the clone wars movie in the theatre before i compared with it. most of the time, when this lego set is used in a movie, you will tend to compare it and what is the actual purpose for twilight, same as the rest of the sw vehicles and aircraft. for a high price like this, i can actually top up a little more and get the at-te, with the same batch of minifigs plus commander rex. if there is a special figure such as the v19 torrent (clone pliot), it will be a much ideal scenario. at the moment, i have not bring in any clone war sets into my collection, and i am quite sure twilight is not in my priority list especially when i am not a full-pledged star war collectors or i have strong intentions to complete the entire range in this recent release. therefore, i need to prioritise my purchase, and likely to get two rgs, since that is my favourite ship in clone war era. i am not comparing it with rgs. both sets defintely have their pros and cons. oh, i love that postcard you made. certainly looks very nice! svelte_corps, thanks for doing up this superb detailed review which had given "twilight" the neccessary attention it should have.

0 darkrebellion, on aug 12 2008, 12:17 pm, said: i like this ship even if it looks so bulky but i need to buy first other sets, so maybe this beast will be landing in my collection the next year (or this one if i am lucky ). i can just ask for something, can you post a pic of all your clone wars sets together with this one (all the sets in one pic, not many pics with this an each set ) please . i think a lot of people feel the same way - there was so much good stuff to get in the first wave that this is probably a backburner set for a lot of people, and some are probably waiting to see the movie to see how prominently it features. i will try and take a pic with some other cw sets, i don't have all of them though and some need to be reassembled as i built them on holiday and then had to pack them away i do think this line of sets has been the best sw lego wave released though. all of the recent releases have been amazing in their own way.

1 thanks for the review. now i thinnk i will buy this set. btw, i really like what you did to the back. i might do the same to mine....

1 this is probably the best review i've ever seen. why? it put the set in context with people's changing thoughts about it. it commented on the box, why do such expensive sets have such ordinary boxes? the photography was outstanding. every issue that a builder could have with it was discussed in a calm and rational manner. i have the same issues with technic structured sets, and svelte_corps summed up my feelings on this beautifully. this was an even handed review, so thoughtful. finally, you gotta love a bit of humour in a review, that gardenis brilliant. i was probably never going to get this set anyway but it sets a new world's best standard for reviews. i strongly encourage anyone that's going to review a set to have a good look at this to see how well it can be done. thanks for the magnificent review!

1 oh no! anakin has gone over to the green side of the force! well, i guess someone had to review the clunkadunk eventually. and you did a good job at it, svelte corps! i liked the punchline with the ahsoka-hairpiece swapping. the "ugha warrior upgrade" is an interesting way of creating male togrutas. and ahsoka looks even hotter with inferno's hair! matteo kenobi, on aug 11 2008, 09:30 pm, said: if i am really impressed with it in the film i suppose that would change things, but i will have to see =] i wouldn't count on it. spoiler after its first flight, the twilight will crash and burn! wookieepedia says so, and you can see it in one of the trailers. so, i guess the twilight will stay mostly unbought. poor clunkadunk.

1 zzz, on aug 12 2008, 09:00 pm, said: and i simply love that there is space inside. you said there is not really some cause of the landing gear mechanism, but it seems it should be easily fixed. do you think there is enough space to put some plates over the landing gear and add some beds, kitchen und tv? i think this set is so perfect to mod it into a clone wars mobile home, your back garden ist just perfect for this. it does have that homely feel! there is room inside with technic beams to lay plates etc on, the only issue is that it's kind of fiddly to access. you could do it from either the side door or rear door though, maybe move that tow line at the back. i have to say, it is a set that grows on you

0 thank you svelte_corps for the review! i like the inside, nice and cosey! i also like your little garden! for me, this put the twilight different in a better perspective than my first perspective of the twilight. i voted outstanding. greets the-force!

-1 i will not be picking this one up. the main thing is that it simply looks akward. it is big and bulky, and seems to have random pieces on it with not reall streamline feel to it. i also agree that for an exclusive that it $100, it needs more than just 3.5 mini figures. anikan and ashoka and rotta already come in the at-te, which is cheaper and has more figures. r2-d2 is a figure that i am sure everybody has at least 4 or 5 of. for that kind of money, i expect something with at least one unique figure, and more than 4. i also want just a cleaner and better designed set. this is probably the letdown of the collection so far. every collection needs one.

0 seems like tlc has done a pretty accurate representation of the ship. the real fault for the ship's messy design has to go to lucasfilm, not tlc. my guess is lucasfilm is trying to recapture that "what a piece of junk!" magic of the millennium falcon. i guess we'll have to wait to see the movie to see if they succeeded or not. the idea of a "space mobile home" reminds me of the winnebago from "spaceballs." great review!! informative, entertaining, and opinionated. so many people shy away from stating an actual opinion in their review for fear of offending anyone. what's the point of making a review if you don't state what you think about it???

0 svelte_corps, on aug 12 2008, 02:19 am, said: hmm... dior. i can smell it now the ship doesn't look too swooshable (but, then again, more than the heavy rgs) i really like that review svelte corps! so much detail! unfortunately i would only get this if it was a very low price, like in a sale.

-1 thanks for yet another awesome review. quote seems like tlc has done a pretty accurate representation of the ship. the real fault for the ship's messy design has to go to lucasfilm, not tlc. my guess is lucasfilm is trying to recapture that "what a piece of junk!" magic of the millennium falcon. i guess we'll have to wait to see the movie to see if they succeeded or not. this sums up my opinion exactly. i can easily admit that the design of the kit is spot on - but unfortunately, the actual design of the ship in the new movie is garbage. actually, despite the millennium falcon's odd design, i really think it's a pretty appealing ship - and its really cool! i can't say the same for the twilight, though.

1 i think some people agree that this ship is better than when we first saw those pictures, at least i do. it looks like it has some nice accessories that come with the ship as well. my favorite of you custom things has got to be the octopus it's so funny and a great use for the headdress thing. great review. edited by skipper 24, 13 august 2008 - 11:24 am.

-1 thanks for the review. i for one will get this set. i collect and therefore i need it. i vision something like this: a: i buy the set b: i built the set c: pics for my bs account d: set taken apart. sad, but true. it's not much, but super for parts. i agree (from what your review showed me) that this set is a little too much technic. a thing that's been invading our beloved brick built sets in the past years. i really have no need for a retractable front or functioning landing gear. what i need is a kick-ass ship with neat design and cool interior. the twilight does not offer that. "look at the size of that thing"

1 good review there! my daughter loves the backyard garden of the twilight my opinion of the ship has changed after reading this, thanks!

0 [/quote] part 3: a closer view[/b] close-up of the main body of the ship: front-on. it is well-designed how the figs appear in line of sight (unlike the 6211 where jabba and leia were photoshopped in to the box art). don't ask what rotta is doing out of the line of vision there. some things are better left unsaid. [/quote] rotta: can i get on your knee to look outside? anakin: no! rotta: can i pull this lever? anakin: don't touch it! rotta: i want to drive! anakin: if your not quitting i will get you back to that mean white woman. rotta: i need a clean diaper! anakin: ashoka, get of the toilet! it's my turn to get some rest. ashoka: i thought i would become a padawan, not a babysitter!

1 argh! what i was typing kept getting deleted by my stupid keyboard!!!!! on topic: this looks like a great little set, i could use a few of these, but i haven't seen any at a local store. too bad for me i suspose . great review, and i like the green plate on the bottom, never can have too many greens for my small but expanding swamp i'm building. hope i can pick some of these up eventualy.

1 time for another of the great castle sets. and yes this one is a great army builder set as well :d set# 7090 set title: crossbow attack price: 5.29 euro / 5.99 usd pieces: 54 release: 2007 the box: and as the other two sets reviewd so far (7009 and 5615), this one has a fitting box that is too easily snatched from the shelf and put into your shopping cart. - not sure it's a great thing...too expensive in the end :d the crossbow attack cart: the cart is a neat little build that actually works. and for once we're not given that awful technic launcher, but a "build-it" launcher! it actually works just fine for it's purpose. the addition of two crossbows makes it worth buying. never can get enought weapons for the evergrowing crownie army. the figs: oddly i've not taken any pics of the figs and therefore i'll illustrate using the s@h pic. the figs are great. i love the silver helmets and in this set you get 2 crownies and a skeleton plus a white skeleton horse. that's a lot of figs for a set this size. a true army builder. thumbs up for that. the all in all verdict: another small, yet super set in the castle theme. i bought several of these to make a fine little army. it's cheap and often found on sale! i can hardly resist buying it when i see it kimt

1 hard to find (in italian shops); i had a friend buying one for meas soon as the set was available. i always wanted another one, so while in switzerland (see kimt's 7009 review for the full story), i bought two. for 5 uros you get two knights, a skeleton and a skeleton horse, some hand weapons and a shooting device (please remember, don't aim at the eyes!) just great.

1 this little bugger brought me back from my dark ages! as a movie fan, i just couldn't resist the thought of making an animation with living lego skeletons (i'm referring to ray harryhausen's work on the classic jason and the argonauts here). buying the indy sets stopped me from getting a lot more castle sets. though in time i added the final joust, the wizard and the impulse knight to my collection, as well as buying more unique figs (king, princess) from expensive castle sets off bricklink. so yeah. great little set. two crownies, a skeleton and a skeletal horse, you just cannot resist that! even if you hadn't been buying lego for 5 years. as far as i'm concerned, this set is one for the ages! i love it!

1 this is an awesome set in my opinion. i scraped my crossbows for mocing recently, but the set is still an amazing army builder. for the price for the sw battlepacks, which have 4 minifigs and a cheap vehicle, you get 4 knights ( this is 2 sets to equal the price of a bp ), 2 skellys and 2 skelly horses, plus 4 crossbows, 4 good wheels, and some other good dark blue and brown pieces for my ever expanding castle town. great buy.

1 lovely set. nice collection of weapons. cool horse-accesoires for the white knight, cool black skeletal horse on the dark knight's side. loving the printed armours of both knights! and, as opposed to kimt apparently, i really dig the black helmet. i feel there's a lord of the rings-flavour to it with those curves. well designed!

1 another small set my local target doesn't have. they don't have the best castle selection, they only really have dwarven mines and castle seiges. i'll buy this if i see it there though, because it looks like a great little set. i could use the awesome knight, and a skeleton that has a regular body so he looks like he is in armor!!!!!

0 i should really get one more of these for the figures, shields, and weapons. this set is the only one with the scythe in pearl-grey, by the way. "the only thing that puzzles me is; why would a crown knight joust a skeleton?" good question. for a joust to make sense, this set should contain two human knights instead -- which would be fine with me so long as they had differing armour and colours. edited by tenorikuma, 13 august 2008 - 03:51 am.

0 i'm not a huge fan of this set but it is a great way to nab a fully mounted knight complete with a very attractive barding. given that in prior years it wasn't possible to get a barded horse in such a small set, this set is actually a decent way to build a mounted cavalry for your kingdom. looking at bricklink, it would probably cost as much to buy the knight, horse and weapons separately, and that doesn't take into account the skeleton or the extra bricks. despite my indifference to this set, i actually have purchased four of them in the past year simply because there isn't a cheaper way to acquire a mounted knight.

1 this set is a great little bundle, the kitted out knight, skellie knight, weapons, and the few bricks for the fence and weapon rack. the castle 07 barding here is very nice, indeed the colour scheme of the new castle guys is great imo, the light blue and blue work nicely together and against the grey background. i don't really like the pearl grey helmet - it would be nicer in metallic silver like the visor i think. interesting comment re: the skellie helmet - i guess black normal knight's helmet with visor would be quite nice for him. i got this set as part of the complete castle collection from s@h. however, i have extras of all the smaller sets and skeleton tower, except i don't have another one of this set. it's on my list of sets to buy. unfortunately it wasn't on s@h for ireland when i was making later orders - quite an odd omission. also last year castle '07 was exclusive to argos (uk catalogue retailer) who only had three sets (not the joust). i should see if the local toy store has it now though, as they did stock some '07 castle in addition to '08 at the start of the year. i think small sets like this should be well stocked in shops for a year or two - it surely doesn't do their sales much good to be so sporadically available? sorry, turned into a bit of a ramble. anyways, the point is that this set is good enough i'd pick up another. the cobra: that sucks about customs. i try to keep my orders to within the 23 duty-free limit for here in ireland. if your imports are waylaid you pay 20% import duty, 21% sales tax, and a postage fee for the diversion to customs. nasty! edited by brickzone, 13 august 2008 - 11:15 am.

1 you know what i think this set has? charm. lots of it. i'm not a big fan of castle, having very few sets, all of them spanning different nations/armies, but i couldn't resist this set. and while not obvious at first, it really is backwards compatible with every castle set with a horse in it. nonetheless, i think this set is great. it's simple, cheap and has charm. that's good enough for me. plus it has that fantastic grinning knight and the black skeleton horse. those just made it better.

0 brickzone, on aug 14 2008, 07:42 pm, said: perhaps he meant the pearl light grey lance, which is not that common. could be, it's not that uncommon. it's in several sets. now red is uncommon.

1 first things first. the knight's helm does have a spot for a plume. now, i really like this set and it was the first one i dug into when i got my collection in the mail. it has a great selection of equipment for good or evil figures and the barding for the horse is outstanding. my only wish was for one of the long chrome swords for the knights. i think the new knights with the tall shield and chrome sword look excellent on foot and on horseback. it would definitely be neat to revisit this set with another human knight instead of the skeleton. make that change and add a lady to joust for and it'd be bang on.

1 indexed name: holiday villa theme: lego system / town year: 1988 pieces: 197 minifigs: 2 price: usd ? there were quite a few sets in the 1980's that weren't sold in the us. i remember reading once that it was because they contained wine glasses and tlg felt they wouldn't be able to market a toy that encourage the drinking of alcohol. this set was one of them. i remember seeing this in a catalog that came with a fabuland set and wondering what it was and where i could get one. i wrote to lego and got an overseas catalog which had the futuron 6990 monorail transport system in it before it was available in the us. i was amazed. i ended up buying 6349 holiday villa from that catalog but, for some reason, gave it to my best friend for his birthday. i've always wanted this set and finally bought it from bricklink this year.... my purchase included everything except the box. i really like the boxes. but, in lieu of a boxshot, here is the instruction manual: i imagine this was the image on the front of the box: the parts one of the things that appealed to me about this set is it's abundance of rare parts. this base plate is an excellent piece and was only available in two sets: classic lego telephone: technically, these blue windows 1 x 4 x 5 windows are only available in this set, according to bricklink. it was available in different form (with and without fixed glass, trans blue glass) in other sets. regardless this size and color window is rare and the blue door was only available in 4 sets. this was a huge selling point for me as i'm a window monkey. never heard that term? it's like a parts monkey (a collector who buys mulitples of sets just for parts or large lots of bulk from bl and sorts them into bins) but just for windows. tell your friends i coined the term: these sloped windows have endless possibilities in many themes (maybe not with the curtain decals applied) but are another great rare part that appears in this set: the build remember this piece? i'd like to see a badass agents car built on this car base! : i am a fan of the six-wide car but i see the appeal of the four wide. it has a very nostalgic feel to it: there's no denying that this is a beauty of classic lego 4-wide cars: this set comes with two mini-figures, one of which appears to be a painter. classic vintage lego figs: onto the house which begins with the basic floorplan: a kitchen that's open to the rest of the house and a little oven and hood vent is one of my favorite touches. it's one thing to throw an oven into a house set, but the designer of this set made it a cool part of the architecture of the house which gives it a unique feel: the completed first floor and carport: i do wish the sides of the roof were white with a little overhang like an actual roof. this method of white on bottom, red on top looks more like a child's drawing than a real house. this is easily fixed with some modifying. still, you get a lot of roof pieces in this set: here we have the completed set. the husband cleans the yard while the wife gets plastered on wine. don't tell the american kids! another angle: working in the kitchen: getting smashed before dinner. i think she may have a serious problem: the bedroom. a little stark, but the bed looks comfy: overall shot of the interior: rating playability: 9/10 (the possibilities are endless with drunky mcwine-wine and husband. really, playability is up to the imagination of the player. it's a house, not really very action-packed.) design: 9.5/10 (great design with plenty of rare parts. love the classic car, too! loses half a point for the all red roof...) price: na (i believe this was inexpensive, but since i have no proof, i will have to leave this factor out of the overall rating.) overall: 9.25/10 (classic sets like this all deserve 10s in my book, but looking at it with an objective eye it's excellent, but not perfect.)

1 this looks like a really great set! i wasn't around in '88 to get it but i like it! it actually has things inside the interior! thanks for the review. hinckley, on aug 13 2008, 06:11 pm, said: there were quite a few sets in the 1980's that weren't sold in the us. hooray!

1 that's a great review of a great set, hinckley! i voted for outstanding : this set is simply amazing! i regrettably don't own this set since it's very hard to find on ebay and/or the stickers are missing. but nevertheless i hope that i one day will be able to get this awesome set - or even better - see tlg releasing a new city villa in a style similar to that brilliant set . klaus-dieter edited by klaus-dieter, 13 august 2008 - 06:30 pm.

1 nice set what a great find, this is one thing i think the tlg has forgotten about, the creator houses are nice but they are not really geared toward a town them (no mini figs, cars etc) these sets were and that adds so much to a town layout it can't be overlooked. i really like this i may have to start my ebay searching..... thanks hinckley

0 great review! i'd give this set an 8 at the least. it's just a tad too simple for my liking but other than that it looks great! while i'm a 4 wide car man i actually think this car looks rather horrendous. the main body seems way too low in comparison with the windows. the rare parts however do make up for it. hinckley, on aug 13 2008, 11:23 pm, said: yes yes. in the states, horrifying and deplorable violence is fine, but drinking and swearing sends kids directly to hell. somehow, i feel like watching south park now ... that was such a good episode

1 this is my favourite house which i owned during my childhood. although it's in the crypt, but i hope to build it back one day. looking at your review makes me so envy of you to own a complete set. the baseplate is very unique especially for its stoned pattern. classic lego telephone is just so lovely especially when its printed. the entire house layout is simple and very nicely constructed. in fact, the simplicity just showed how much lego could do with such parts. there are many nice furnitures included in this set such as the little oven/stove, dining table, bed and car porch. the little black car is a classic example of a true 4-studs car. i love this house very much, and my verdict is a full "5". no doubt about it. thanks hinckley for this lovely review.

0 i've 2 of these sets. one is for sale .....

1 this is a really good set. what makes it nice is that it is so simple but perfect, a feeling that sets don't emit often these days. i voted outstanding. hinckley, on aug 13 2008, 07:11 pm, said: remember this piece? i'd like to see a badass agents car built on this car base! i was bored and i needed inspiration... it's not agents but hey, nothing is perfect. dr. brick

1 thanks for the wonderful review. this is really a beautiful set - i love the old lego houses from the 80's and 90's - they were always very quaint and well designed. actually, i like the old car designs too, but only for their nostalgic value (in reality, they are very unrealistic and look more like go carts). that said, not all four wide cars are silly looking - the 4-wide cars in these city sets are awesome and fit in with the modern city style great.

0 cool review! i never knew that those wine-glasses could be the reason for this not being sold in the us!

1 i just bought this! it's truly a wonderful set and i love the houses from that era as well. very charming. great review!

1 i wish i could find this set some day (including the right baseplate). some of my house mocs are styled after the classic 6349. and sometimes i've rebuilt it after instruction scans exchanging the baseplate (i don't own one of these) with 2 at 16x32 each. and this city house out of an older thread of mine. it's offensive, that i've used styling elements of 6349's just enlarged. in terms of interior details: not much, but still enough for classic town. i voted outstanding mfg widdi edited by widdi, 09 october 2008 - 01:22 am.

1 this is an awesome set, man... and a great review. just too bad it is so rare! i voted 5. by the way, does anyone know if there is a review for this? or other sets that come with a camper, perhaps? also, i was wondering if the creator houses are in scale and could be used with minifigs and such.

1 this would be great for any pirate fan, the extraback pack for the soldiers, some spare owes for the row boats, a female face for a wench, and a rather simple raft for that unlucky pirate lost at sea! over all a nice set, i am a little confused by the dynamite though... perhaps an easy way to go fishing or perhaps to clear a rock in the forseen future? or is it that she is just a suicide bomber attacking the white house water (joke not ment to be tasteless or offensive to those lost in the act of terrosim, greatest respect to those who have lost loved ones) great review, regards cpt. pb

1 good set, i laughed at the dynamite, but not as much as that axe... not many trees on the rapids. looks like she's got more than dynamite to cause havoc in the harbour...

0 again a great review, whitefang! i voted for average: the minifig and the accessores are excellent - but the raft itself is very poor. klaus-dieter

0 water and lit dynamite isn't a good match.

1 thanks for this review thebrickster, i also have this set and think it's one of the best helicopters tlg made in the 90's. it's quite big and has got place for 2 minifigs in the cockpit. i also like the fact that there's a victim included in form of the x-treme diver, which also is a theme i always loved as a kid. do you have any other res-q sets left to review? it would be an honour for me to also do a review of one or more sets which are left, but unfortunately i got not much time at the moment.

0 metalandi, on aug 15 2008, 07:16 am, said: do you have any other res-q sets left to review? it would be an honour for me to also do a review of one or more sets which are left thanks metalandi. this and the emergency evac set are the only re-q sets i have. i would encourage you to share a review as you have done some very nice reviews.

0 cool, then i think i'll do a review of 6451 river response later today or tomorrow, stay tuned!

1 the helicopter looks nice and the resq minifigs were nice. the diver minifig had once been a personal favorite of mine.

0 thanks for the review brickster, i do own this set in it's original form, the only drawback that i have noted previously is the lack of rotor's and the cobraesq of the copter body i wish it had a larger fuselage but i still have it and i still like it despite my criticism....which i am sure is in my eyes only. thanks again brickster. i wish i had bought some of the other res q sets but of course i only bought three.

1 a neat set with lots of accessories, but i never liked any of the lego helicopters with long streamlined canopies, as they are obviously more influenced by military helicopters and space ships, than by real civilian transport helicopters. i'd give it a 3 at best. very good and thourough pictorial review though!

-1 i think the set is too unrealistic, i like the new resq sets better (and i'm somewhat a lifeboat freak so i'm always following such a sets with interest). i would like to see some rigit inflatable boats some day ;) but about the chopper, i like the accessoiries.

1 what exactly makes you feel this set isn't realistic? it has got nothing what wouldn't be on a real helicopter, imo. and for the futuristic design, yes, it looks modern, but it works. and actually, most of today's real helicopters also don't look like in the 70's anymore.

0 metalandi, on aug 24 2008, 04:17 pm, said: what exactly makes you feel this set isn't realistic? since the question was asked... 1) tiny rotors 2) dual cockpits (only seen on a few military copters) 3) stretcher extends beyone edges of fuselage when inside the vehicle 4) extra long canopy (really only seen on military helicopters), and "military" design. 5) black colorscheme for rescue vehicle. the the stretcher, minifig designs and rescue logo are the only things about this copter that really suggest that it is a civilian rescue aircraft. it's a toy set with alot of play value, but i agree with karto that these kind of desgins really turned me off to alot of the town and city sets of the 90's. on the positive side, the new city sets, with thier realistic non-futuristic designs have really tempted me to buy more vehicles.

1 it took quite some time, but now i'm finally continuing with city reviews. this one beeing about a really good set of the res-q theme, and also one of my favourites of this theme. it brings a lot of playability and an incredible amount of useful pieces, even with only 145 bricks in complete. set nr.: 6451 name: river response number of minifigs: 3 number of pieces: 145 release year: 1998 price: ~20 usd (back then, when it was new) unfortunately i haven't got the box of this set anymore, but the instructions are still there in good condition: we get 3 res-q minifigs in this set, from which i really love the detailed torso's: a shot of the complete set with both the boat and the little car off board: the before mentioned car is really, really little, but it still got enough space to transport 2 minifigs: a closeup of the rubber dinghy: the speed boat as stand-alone: as already said before, this set brings a big count of equipment and accesoires with it, which is really good for a set this size: in the middle section of the boat there is enough space for a minifig to sit in and put on his diving equipment: and last but not least, a shot from the whole set wirh everything attached, at the front section you can see a wench which also adds a lot to the set: when i got this set back in the day, i was really happy about it and for sure spent a lot of tie playing with it, because of it's great features as the wench in the front of the boat, or the car the boat can transport. i hope you like my little review, stay tuned for more in the next days! edit: i forgot the poll, can sombody add it please? i don't know how to do or if it is possible to do that myself edited by metalandi, 15 august 2008 - 03:59 pm.

1 this set was my first set ever from the resq series, and i loved it entirely! ofcourse i modded it slightly here and there after hours and hours of fun and excitement, it has great play value, even for a set in this size

1 this is one of my favourite sets. i remember getting it in tesco soon after it was released. those were the days... the res-q line was good, and this set made it better.

1 wow. i loved this set, i still have it actually... in pieces though, i took it apart quite soon after i got it, then managed to lose the instruction manual

1 if you still have all the parts, try to rebuild it, you'll see that it's a great feeling!

1 6004 crossbow cart review because i may start collecting castle here is a review of one of my few castle sets. please note i hurriedly put his together meaning some parts are the wrong color, look out for them! this review will also be done in my star wars review style. the lighting is also particularly bad in the pics. on with the review... parts: 20 figs: 1 price: ????? 1.overview and fig the whole set. the fright knight's knight. the disemboweled knight. the head printing is just longer then the helmet visor. 2. the cart the cart has 3 crossbows and 2 norman type shields. the cart's advanced defense and weapons systems. all the parts from the cart. (forgot to add the fig in) 3.extras & overall here are all my castle figs. remember i don't collect castle. (yet ) oh yeah i forgot to put one of the old skellies and a ghost on there. could a castle fan tell me if any of these minifigs are rare. i have no idea because i don't collect castle. build: 6/10 pretty standard for a impulse. minifigs: 7/10 nice minifig with lots of accessories. design: 8/10 this set made way for some of the new castle carts of similar size. parts: 10/10 3 crossbows, 2 shields, arrow quiver, and spear as well as cool minifg in a 20 piece set! price: 10/10 well i don't know but lego was cheaper in '97 so it gets 10. playability: 5/5 pretty much standard for a impulse set. overall 8/10 good parts and price as well as minifig scores this set an 8. thanks for reading.

0 nice review i collect castle too and the ghost isn't really rare (i have one too) but it's not really found anymore so it would be a good thing to keep it. anyway great review edited by mammymarf, 15 august 2008 - 08:48 pm.

0 about the rarest one up there is that black ninja. i only have one ninja and he is dark grey. i also have five samurai. the witch may be fairly rare but i am not sure. i didn't really collect much in the fright knight era.

1 very nicely done - this cart is a striking resemblance to the crossbow cart we got in 2007.

0 nice review i agree with thok its quite similar to the more recent crossbow attack, though this one has the added benefit of two shields. this set would i fleet be more useful to army builders than most of the modern castle sets, even though many people dont like frightknights.

0 looks great, and the figures up there are old, and kinda rare. i don't really like fright knights though, so i probably won't get this set.

0 thanks for the review. i've added it to the index. i'm not a fan of this theme. but i have to say that this is a neat little set, that does hold some good things. figs and weapons are always welcome and one can never have to many wheels. so i rate this "average."

1 originally shared in the history & adventure forum for its adventure attributes, here's my favorite of the outback collection: first, let me say that this little set is one of my all-time favorites because it can be used to sumplement a number of different themes. 1) the set makes a great little adventure airstrip for adventurers and more recent, the indiana jones theme (see also german headquarters and port adventure). i've also used the set as an addition to my wild west town. the tan baseplate and windmill works great, just subtract the plane, modern equipment, and figs. and lastly, as the set was intended, as an outback/desert airstrip. set description: outback airstrip set # 6444 pieces: 157 minifigs: 3 release date: 1997 original price: $20 (usd) starting with the box: and the backside. notice the alternate models. i love the swamp boat: the building is my favorite part of the set. it is simple, has a little detail, two great roof pieces, and a single green window (great piece!): check out the great windmill piece. it's my only one and makes a great part for wild west and that farm you always wanted to build. i used it for the barnhouse of barnabas higgens and spring valley ranch on the side of the building is a great radio and a clear glass: unfortunately, no furniture can be found within the building: and now the airplane: front view; i love the twin propellors: side view: and the rear section: the back has a small cargo hold for some boxes/freight or some gear needed in the outback: the set includes three figs, two with cool shades: and some great equipment. i love the boom box: a shot of the whole set: and another: summary: as i mentioned above, this set is very versatile and can suplement a few different themes. it's my personal favorite of the outback collection and i'm really glad i was able to find the set in the late 90s (i almost didn't buy). sets like this are timeless and so much fun to build and display. hope you enjoy the review. edit: additional reviews: review by agentrick57 (december 24, 2007) outback airstrip review in history & adventure forum (february 10, 2008)

1 great review! this set has cool features. i just wish that lego would release this as a lego legend and release it to australia too, since this is a set about australia. i would've bought two if this were a lego legend. that is how good it is. i like the building with latticed window and windmill. i also like the cargo airplane, windsock, and radios. plus it looks like it's got great minifigs.

1 this is probably my all-time favorite lego set. it was originally given to me for my birthday by a close friend of mine back in the release year of 1997. the cargo plane was, by far, my favorite vehicle ever. unfortunately, someone stole the plane from me when our families went on vacation and the rest of the set was given to my cousin's oldest son when i was no longer interested in my lego collection. now that i'm back into lego, i use that building's construction for various projects, especially as a dr. inferno look-out shack using parts from extra mission 3: swamp raid. the shack compliments the original set greatly. edited by skorpius47, 19 august 2008 - 01:44 am.

1 the building is great and detailed, with a few mods it could be added to my castle town. i don't really like the plane though, seems kind of abstract, not really good in my opinion, but i bet it would be easy to mod to look better.

1 one of the best in my humble opinion. as far as i know it was never released in the uk so the only reason i managed to get my hands on it was on a family holiday to the us, i think theyd only recently opened the lego store in disney. arguable the best feature is that it seems to fit into a wide selection of themes, is it a airstrip in the middle of nowhere, is it next to a only mining town thats not deserted the possibilities are rather open and thats truly great.

1 legoman132, on aug 18 2008, 09:36 pm, said: this was a cool set i thoght of it as i was building the post plane. interesting thought. i have the post plane but i haven't opened it yet. i suppose it's the yellow. the plane in this set is much different than most of the other classic town airplanes in that it has the double tail section. here's a shot of the new 7732 air mail set - definately a nice set:

1 i have had this on my bricklink wanted list for ages, and yet noone with my criteria has it. nice review and brilliant set.

1 you think it's not a great thing that we get a yoda fig in an affordable set like this?!? that was the main reason why i got this set! and what do you mean by "another"? wasn't this the only one that was ever released except for the one in the dagobah/x-wing set? sure, he is not the best fig with the unmovable legs and all, but still: it's yoda! besides, he doesn't move his legs a lot in "real" life either. nice review, though, and thanks for telling me what that liftarm-thingy was meant to be for. i never got that and thought it was supposed to lift up the speeder for some reason. i got two of this set, and the printing on those blue parts were off in the second one i got. edited by oky wan kenobi, 18 august 2008 - 08:45 pm.

0 no, yoda was released in no less than 3(4) sets. ok, so i remembered wrong. i just have plenty yodas and one is more than enough for the set list click here thanks for pointing that out.

0 thanks for the nice review kimt . i like this set especially by the fact that it is the only set containing the dooku minifig and the curved lightsaber , i also think that the minifig is cool but i also own the dagobah x-wing and the wookiee catamaran sets so i have enought minifigs (a clone wars version would be very cool ) and the extra-thingy is well, just ok. the bad part is that i don?t buy the set when it is out and now is go for $40 on ebay and bricklink . edited by darkrebellion, 18 august 2008 - 09:51 pm.

-1 i think this is a pretty lame set. it came with dooku, who i think only came in this set, plus a unique lightsaber. still, they could have made it much bigger, added anikan and obi-wan, and added structures and made it more like the scene from the movie. also, the speeder doesn't seem very accurate.

0 i missed out on this set but it looks pretty good imo. thanks for clearing up what that thing was i thought it was something they flung at eachother in the movie i like the lightsaber also but why did they stop making chrome ones

0 i wonder how expensive this set would be on ebay. (shop victoriously)

1 i missed this set.but i reallly like the yoda and count dooku.i especially like count dooku's lightsaber.one thing though,is it me oris yoda's lightsaber blue in the picture? edited by pr0visorak, 20 august 2008 - 12:21 pm.

1 i was very lucky to get this set and i love it, i dont have it built cause i bought it for parts but it was fun while it lasted. .

0 i got this set a long time ago. the review pretty much says all there is to say about it. (never knew what the red/brown thing was anyway, i used it as a canon.) isn't this also the only set up until now that had count dooku in it?

1 great review, kimt! at that time, it was still in my dark age and i hated myself not to get this set earlier. this is quite inexpensive and you are able to get two greatest characters especially count dooku. the minifigs are excellent, especially the unique design of count dooku's lightsaber. i have no problem with the speedbike, as it looks quite alright to me. as for the elevation of yoda's jump adds some playabilty, but that does not work well for me. nevertheless, the main attractive factor is count dooku and i have to rate it a "5". i never own a yoda, except for the magnet version.

0 cheers for the review kimt! of the initial episode ii lego releases this set was the least inspiring, but the minifigs were must-haves. you can't go wrong with count dooku and yoda! i like the design of dooku's speeder in the movie but lego missed the mark a bit with it here and gave him a dodgy flying boat instead! the speeder cradle/yoda jumping mechanism was just a waste of parts unfortunately. i'd like to see dooku's speeder re-imagined by lego. they've come a long way in the way they design a lot of the new star wars sets

1 very nice review. one thing you have to consider: when lego sees pics of the star wars universe, they have to decide which would be the easiest set to make with the most playibility. therefore, they chose the hmp. quote thanks for the review. it's always good to have a 2nd opinion on a set. i've added the usual poll and i'll index it tomorrow (must sleep). super pics and great to have "in-build" pics default_thumbup.gif a fine set which i'll surely buy when i find it. default_hmpfbad.gif where? edited by lt. col. thok, 18 august 2008 - 10:07 pm.

1 it took a long time, but now here it is, the review of the x-treme team set 6584 extreme team challenge. thebrickster asked me a few weeks ago to do this, since he unfortunately never owned this great set, so here we go! first i have to say, that i really love this late 90's town theme, and i wish there would have been produced more sets. this is the only one i own, well, beside that i also still have 6572 wind runners, but the car is missing. anyway, let's face the facts and let the pictures speak for themselves! sub-theme: x-treme team set nr.: 6584 name: extreme team challenge number of minifigs: 4 number of pieces: 354 release year: 1998 let's start off with a few quick shots of the box & instructions: inside of the box: we got some ideas for alternative models on the backside (the same ones are also on the backside of the instructions): instructions: here's an overall view of this huge set: we get 4 minifigs, each with different heads and color patterns, which i really like: ...and also a good amount of equipment for them: let's move on with the cool vehicles, there are 3 (!) completely different ones in this set, first is the neat little trike: next, the not less neat "4-wheeled off-road-thing" (don't know what's it called really ): and finally the huge monster truck, i love the chrome sidepipes and the wench with the hook in the back, which adds a lot of playability: oh, i almost forgot our brave adventurers also have got a raft to ride the wild mountain waters: now let's focus on the many details of the mountain base. we got a bridge over troubled waters, but be aware, it's very unstable! love the wood patterns on the yellow 1x6 tiles: on a corner a camera is mounted to document the wild life: for the evenings we also got a little campfire: down by the river sits a grey falcon and watches the guys on their challenges: what's that? seems not very safe, to be honest..be aware when you pass by these rocks.... ....cause it will collapse! let's move up again where the tent is placed, inside is plenty of space to take a rest for the figs and to store their equipment: but i think they should have built the tent on another place cause the ground isn't very good there: when you pull the mechanism, a trap door opens: will the guys all come back home safe and not injured? you decide! all in all this is a really great set, ome may say it is a bit juniorized because of the baseplate, but it really isn't. it's got a lot of playability and some rare parts, the biggest beeing the baseplate which is only available in this set. i hope you liked my review, let me know your opinions! edited by metalandi, 23 august 2008 - 12:56 pm.

1 i remember getting this for christmas, and despite the earthy grey parts i relly enjoyed it, and it is nice to see pictures of it again- thanks.

1 excellent review metalandi! i really think this looks like a fun set. i esp. love the mountain, bridge, and baseplate. it has adventure fun written all over it. thanks for taking the time to review this set. i've always seen it in pictures, but never close-up.

1 cool set! i like the tent and monster truck the most.

1 thank you for that very interesting review, metalandi. a cool set with a lot of features and some nifty vehicles, very playable and well designed indeed. perhaps a bit too colorful for my likings, but pretty impressive in its conception for sure. i wish we could see some more landscaping coming along with todays vehicle sets as well...

0 set data 4920: the rapid rider year: 1999 subtheme: rock raiders pieces: 37 (+1 extra - trneongreen plate 1 x 1 round) price: euro 3,50, used, not including s/h, on ebay building time: less than 10 minutes. more info: bricklink - peeron. i could have owned the 4910 hover scout (see metalandi's review here), but while i was buying some used sets, i forgot to buy that one too! so, here's my only rr set, the second smallest one (if we don't count japanese promos; sweets are surely sweeter if they come with a lego set!) pieces: face and torso closeup; i like the torso, the face is good except for the bandanna. building is based on two big pieces: landing skids and plate 6 x 6 x 2/3 cross with dome. let's go! building is over: review: pros: small set (= cheap), 1 fig, two accessories, some interesting pieces like the rock and the crystal. no stickers but 3 printed pieces! good color choice. cons: tipper bucket is fixed, no hinge. no levers or steering wheel, it probably moves by using the buttons on the 2x2 tile. it deserves a 4/5.

1 this was the first rock raiders set i got. i really like it, and i think i got all of them except the huge cargo airlift thing. i remember these sets coming out and getting the big base for christmas, though they are all destroyed now... sadly... . nice review.

0 when i first saw this review title, i thought it said "rapid river review" thinking it was an indian set (6766). nice review though. i never got into rock raiders. i would have loved the large drill bit piece for set #s 4970 and 4940. this set looks like a little boulder hawler, and a nice set to introduce someone unfamilar with the theme. i esp. like the fig and the little 2x2 drill bit tile. the overall set looks like it has some very useful mining-type pieces. nice review and thanks for sharing.

1 rock raiders was the shit back in the day. awesome theme! i had this set as well as the tunnel transporter, which was amazing.

0 thanks for the review! rock raiders was one of the last new themes i knew as a kid before my dark ages came. unfortunately i never managed to get any sets from it, beside a few months ago the 4910 the hover scout, which i review a while ago. wish i can get some of the bigger sets in the future.

1 hello all eurobricks members and classic town lovers, *** editor's note: to mark the celebration of classic town, this set which is released in 1994 and re-released as a legend in 2002. pizza to go review, is dedicated to classic town's opening cermony and members such as hinckley, brickster, imperialshadows, sinner and many others whom have contributed to the final success of classic town! thank you so much for inviting me to be part of this wonderful project, and i wish all the best to the success of classic town! i urge everyone of you to check out classic town and take alook at the cool stuff we have done! *** today, i will be doing up a review on pizza to go set. this outlet is one of the most favourite eatery for any lego citizens living in their town. when they are driving on the road, they are sure to look out "pizzeria" signage. they offer the best pizza in town. no one in town can resist the delicious aroma of pizza, coming out from the red chimney. let us find out why is this shop so popular among so many lego citizens and was one of the famous sets that is re-released under the "legend" theme. pizza to go is my favourite set of all time. i believed there is no other pizza outlet lying around in any lego city apart pizzeria. it seemed there are the sole outlet that is selling pizza for many years. this set was re-released in 2002 and it is part of the legend theme. this is one of the few sets that are highly demanded to be brought back by many fans of lego around the world. i owned the 6350. any members whom had owned both sets before? is there any difference between these two? because when i searched through peeron, it shown 144 pieces instead of 194 pieces for the 1994 set. name: pizza to go theme: lego system / town year: 1994 (re-release: 2002) pieces: 194 minifigs: 3 an image of a 6350, pizza to go let the delivery begins! pizza to go is the regular pizza outlet that sells nothing but pizza. they deliever pizza to every household in town, with their trusty delivery van. walk-in are welcomed too. there is a stand for customers to dine in their pizza quickly before making their way to their next destination. in my opnon, no town can ever survive without the pizza tradition! devoted "pizzeria" staff every outlet comes with 3 dedicated staff, making sure that operations will run smoothly. on the left, we will have the pizza boy, whom is wearing the regular blue dungarees and its white cap. i wonder who is that boy? on the middle, we will have the pizza girl. she looks like any typical sweet girl in town that the boys will look at. she is wearing a suntop strapless on her. she reminded me of one person though, i think her name is called alice. taking a careful look, i wonder if imperialshadows is the pizza boy back then, without that black patch on its left eye? on another note, this mini-figure was my favourite. female mini-figures are very uncommon back then. i am glad i have this figure, adding to my town population. on the right, we will have the hardworking chef, preparing the pizzas in the oven. he wears the regular white chef outfit, but he wear a grey pants instead of the usual full-white outfit in most resturants such as breezeway cafe (6376). let's take a closer look at the pizza boy's van! this van is very very small looking and very fuel efficient. it is able to cut lanes very fast due to its small size. the pizza van is made up of 4-studs wide design. no doors by the side. however, in this vehicle, i think the doors is not a must to be included in this design. our pizza boy will need to leave vehicle pretty fast, and ensuring that the pizza delivery is on time. common mechanism this van has the regular rooftop that can be lifted up to place the pizza boy into the driver seat. there is a sun roof on its top, which enable him to let him have some sunlight from above! the logo on the side of it, is actually a transparent sticker, which have the pizzeria itallian logo and a tasty looking pizza on both sides of its van. i like that sticker very much. mine looks quite worn out over time. if its a printed piece, it will be a terrific bonus. nevertheless, i can still accept the sticker. our pizza van can deliever up to 2 pizza at a go! at every trip, 2 piping hot pizza will be stored at the back of the van. the pizza is fitted in perfectly in each compartment. furthermore, the white window shutter, is terrific in this design. you don't see this kind of design anymore. i think, i have not seen much delivery vans on the street anymore too. base of the van from the base, you can see that it is using of the regular red car base that is common in most 4-studs vehicle design. in fact, this car base served as a foundation for its vehicle design. back of pizzeria alice and the chef will be showing you around at the back of the kitchen. there is an oven on the left, a water tap and a holder for the oar stick. looks pretty empty right? look below for a surprise! my favourite feature! this oven can be used to heat up 2 pizzas at a go. now, i understand why, this set is named "pizza to go". i have been using their slogan unknowingly. this feature is superb nice. now, we know that the pizza is prepared from the outlet instead of using delivery van to collect it from a factory. alice, what are you waiting for? help the chef quickly! pizzeria! the signage sure looks big from far and catches their attention easily too with its pleasnt looking design. as you have already noticed, this is made up of sticker. i don't mind, for this set, it contains sticker. sometimes, i do hope they can give us spare sticker for us to change, after a long period of time. distinct red chimney this is the front of the oven, and that is where the smoke comes out. using only bricks to construct this, is simply wonderful. i like the use of their white bricks to construct the wall layout, and a combination of red parts, especially on the top. i like the look of this very much. another picture on its side printed parts in this set, you will get a total of 5 pizzas! and, i believed no other sets offer so many pizza. you can placed up to 4 pizzas in the van and oven. alice will be carrying the last pizza around. the green and red round dish is a printed part. most exclusive part in 6350/10036 the most unique and important printed parts that is only exclusive in this set. it's at the front of the pizza van. it is none other, but the pizzeria logo, standing at the front of the delivery van. (forgotten to take a picture of this piece, took it from peeron.) different views of pizza to go outlet another bright sunday day in pizza to go! summary review playability: 10/10 (a lot of playing by doing up the pizza process. from preparing to delivery) design: 9.5/10 (outstanding design, with great use of bricks. i like the structure of it very much) price: 9.5/10 (an inexpensive set based on the 1994 pricing. it comes with 3 mini-figs, shop, a van, and a exclusive printed piece) overall: 9.7/10 (i am not trying to be bias. in fact, this set is absoultely filled with minimum flaws. look at my review again, if you are not satisfied with it, or tell me what you don't like!) i gave it a "5" based on my review score card. what about yours? hope everyone of you enjoyed reading this simple review of mine. comments and critics are strongly welcomed. pictures can be found in my brickshelf(when moderated)

1 easily one of the best town sets ever (and pretty expensive for its size too, is/was it that rare?). i hope i still have all the pieces from mine, unfortunately, my stickers are in pretty bad shape (took them off because i needed the bricks, stupid stickers covering multiple parts , only downside to this set). the design is simple, yet so detailed, and the pizza van looks great. 5/5

"above average" jumps to "outstanding", which is a too big of a gap in my opinion. you should've used "good" or "great" in between them. but these are only minor faults, this is a good review anyway! sandy, i appericate your constructive comments in order to improve the quality of my review. i had amended the word "chief" to "chef". you might want to check it. i did not notice that i was using the wrong word. as for the poll definitions which have been used, for 1 to 5. we used "poor" to represent value "1" while "outstanding" to represent value "5". we need to use clear definitions to illustrate and demostrate non-bias towards the review for the readers to cast their vote depending on their individual liking. therefore, we used a common word which is known as "average". in surveys, for measuring its sample size's liking, we have to use words which is neutral such as strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree. that's why, we used this rating approach to represent the terms. the cobra, on aug 24 2008, 07:37 pm, said: i rate it a full 5 too. and i wish lego would make a set like this in 2010. a town needs pizza! edit: don't always trust peeron. sometimes they miss some pieces, and sometimes they just can't count them! i am hoping to see a pizza outlet again, maybe in 2010. well, peeron can sometimes be not very accurate but it can served as a very useful guide in most areas.

1 a very good set indeed, we have at least 3 of them, but we like them all.

0 jopiek, on aug 24 2008, 10:48 pm, said: a very good set indeed, we have at least 3 of them, but we like them all. what do you mean by "we"? you own three sets of the orignal 1994 series or the 2002 legend series?

0 got this one as well, not much surprises in such a small set, but the fast-food pizza idea is pretty cool. as far as i know only the small mcdonalds promo and this set are related to food/restaurant thing (until the cafe corner that is) but since i have a classic lego city i can't miss this set.

1 this set looks really cool, especially for one this inexpensive. the van is neat, and the hidden storage compartment i back is the icing on the cake. i like the back with hidden oven as well, and the rare sink piece makes it all the better. with five pizzas and three minifigs, it's and excellent set to behold.

1 excellent review white fang! - and a great set to commemorate the establishment of classic town.net. i almost ordered this set back when it was re-released by lego, but passed on it. i'm so mad at myself! this has all the terrific qualities that classic town sets exemplify. i love the delivery truck and the pizza oven. a great review from one of the "master eb reviewers" - outstanding!

1 one of my greatest lacks in my town...i can remember going to the store to buy this one, and ending up with another set (pirates) at home :p thank you for the review, it might put me on track in finding this set on the web and purchasing it to correct my childish change of mind, so long ago ;-)

1 great review! i really like this set and plan on getting it on bricklink. it would certainly add something to my collection!

1 i got the original version as a surprise one christmas. my parents liked the design so much they got it for me. this is one of the best town sets. if it didn't have the delivery van it would have been on par with 6683 hamburger stand, a great set in its own right. the van, and they way the back holds the pizzas, is ingenious and bumps this set up to the highest levels.

1 this set is great and so is this review! i really like seeing reviews of classic sets like this and hope to see more in the future. the chef in this set is the base for my sigfig in fact! the classic sets have a totally different feel to them than the newer sets. they look more human. great review!

1 i remember having this set when it was originally released a good few years back, but i don't think i have it anymore. i remember i thought it was really awesome though. i thought the oven and pizza storage in the back of the car were the greatest parts, the little sink on the inside was cool too. didn't realise they had made a legends set out of it... i'd love to own this set again, but misb examples on bricklink go for an extortionate amount of money. ah well, se la vie...

0 thanks for the nice review of this great set, whitefang! i always want to grab one, but the price to buy it now is too forbidding... i also always think the girl minifig is supposed to be a customer... lego is really up to everyone's own imagination... edited by alywin, 15 may 2009 - 06:27 pm.

0 it's defintely nice to see this past classic town review re-surface again. i tom bricks, on may 15 2009, 10:05 am, said: i used to want this set so badly and i almost got it when it was rereleased. i still wonder why i didn't because with a building, van, 5 pizzas, and a then very rare female fig. this set would have been perfect for someone with a smaller collection like i had then. what surprised me the most is how well this set still holds up to others today. off to bricklink! i agreed that this set is perfect for someone with a small collection. in fact, i feel that this set is one of the "must have" set that can allow you build your pizza franchise in your town. posades, on may 15 2009, 10:45 am, said: definitely one of my favorite sets from my childhood; i still remember my sister getting it for me for my birthday and me building it that same day. too bad i had it displayed all these years on my windowsill so the pizza delivery van and pizzeria have become yellowed. is it possible to restore it by getting those bricks or parts again? yellowed bricks is really very saddening. it reminds me of my breezeway cafe. those were the days where we are too young to know how to take good care of our toys. alywin, on may 15 2009, 10:59 pm, said: i also always think the girl minifig is supposed to be a customer... lego is really up to everyone's own imagination... you are right! the girl could have been a customer. i thought of her as a staff. misrepresentation could be so easy, but then again, the box nevr stated its role too.

1 nice review. i have this set, and i like it alot. its a master peice!

1 indexed allright, hi everybody again! today, i'm gonna review the biggest set of the res-q subtheme, 6479 emergency response center. with this one i think, the reviews of all the res-q sets are complete now, and while i'm in a reviewing mode right now i thought i'd bring that up. this set hast got many nice aspects and also some very rare pieces, and comes with a wonderful amount of vehicles, including a speedboat, a tow truck, a helicopter, and a trike which can pull a little boat. so sit down, get your popcorn and beer, we're off to stormy weather at the coast! sub-theme: res-q set nr.: 6479 name: emergency response center number of minifigs: 5 number of pieces: 420 release year: 1998 unfortunately i don't have many of the boxes of my res-q sets anymore, so i'll start right off with the instructions this time: on the backside there is no alternate model as usual this time, but only a different shot of the whole set: next, a general overview, sorry about the slightly bad picture quality on some pics this time: originally this set has 5 minfigs (which all are really nice!), but the guy who drives the tow truck has been lost in the flood here's a picture of the missing fig: let's move on to the vehicles, we have something for the water, the ground and the air in this set, first the great tow truck: i love the mechanism with the hooks in the back: next on, da speedboat! at the rear, it's got a stretcher and a wench, which adds a lot of playability: if there's a a little accident near the coast, the trike comes to appearance: for more complicated stuff, we have a little helicopter (i broke the rotating piece at the top yesterday, ouch! : ) no space for a victim you say? well, not really, but the helicopter also got a wench with a hook in the back: now it comes to the station itself, at the docks a neat life belt sign is mounted (remember, at this time there weren't real ones as today): a little more right an equipment holder is placed, with various tools on the front... ...and fire fighter equip at the back: at the very front a little lighttower secures the shelter: i haven't quite found out what this thing is supposed to be, maybe somebody knows another equipment holder, this time with all the stuff you need for diving: more equipment... ...and even more! we come to the hear piece of the station, the control room with lots of buttons and scrrens: last but not least, a quick shot of all the accesoires and tools that you get, which really is an a-ma-zing amount! this set might have a few junioriced pieces, as the big window in the front or the "briedge" on the roof, but that doesn't matter, because there is nearly one other set in which you get so much rare pieces and such an overwhelming amount of accesoires, so i can recommend that for everybody who is a pieces-fanatic. not to forget the playability, the great figs and the, in my opinion very good color scheme. once again thanks for taking the time reading and looking at my review, i hope you liked it. edited by thebrickster, 31 december 2009 - 09:19 pm.

0 do you mean this one http://www.brickset....aspx?set=2962-1 ? i would also like to get that, alone for the fact that it's the only res-q set with a female fig

1 i have this set and it's pretty nice. i love the res-q theme in general. i think that tow truck is easily the highlight of this set and is probably the best such vehicle i've seen in any city set. the other vehicles are also great. the base itself is lacking though, as it basically consists of one room that doesn't even have side walls. it does include a cool 3x6 computer sticker and a vast array of minifig tools and equipment though. i have some plans to modify the building and make it larger but have never gotten around to doing it.

1 hi everyone, this is my first review on lego sets here. hope you guys like it. and i would like to apologise for the bad quality pictures. hope you guys don't mind. first i will start with the box art. box art: i guess this is the first time that lego star wars sets use white and blue colour for their box. i like the new colour scheme, a nice blend though. here's the front: the back: not to waste space on the box lego do some advertisement to attract us to buy more sets. :grin:the more the side: at the top side there is this minifigs scale picture. it is great as we get to know the real size of a minifigs. contents: the contents consist of a sticker sheet, instruction book, and 8 packet of bricks. the packer are not numbered. but it is ok as there is not much pieces. instruction book and random page: as usual the instruction book have brick checklist, other sets pictures, and tutorial on how you should assemble your set (i mean the very first page). sticker sheet: there is not much sticker sheet and is a great news that the republic logo on the round plate is printed unlike republic gunship. anyway, i didn't apply the stickers. the commander gear: this is a new thing to minifigs as well. well is like batman accessories, they pack it in one small packet. however, you only get one commander gear pack in this set. anyway, i didn't use them. the minifigs: well, we get the the new minifigs. the ugly face clone, new printed torso and new mold of helmet. however i not really like the new head stud, i prefer a black one or at least the one like jango fett, black colour with face. the helmet: everything is printed, no holes at the visor there, but there are hole on the both side. this new helmet mold also made the headgear turn 360 degree freely. without helmet: with helmet: you can see the flesh tone at the hole beside. the blasters: @ short blasters were given instead of long one. is great, at least they give us two blasters instead of one. the tank: here is the pics of the tank. it was not badly design nor nicely design. but it looks great if you didn't saw the beneath or under the tank. view from front: view from side: view from back: what's beneath? under it was 4 wheels, to make it move fluently. it is made by the thread supporter like the one we fet from tie crawler or bat-tank the functions: well firstly, you can open up the hood (i guess) to see the engine. secondly the side cannon that can move upwards. the thing is quite tight (see random instruction page) and there is barrier to block the cannon from going downwards. the cockpit: well the cockpit is small and the space is limited. the monitor stuff is printed brick and is another great news. you have to remove the piece (pic below) to reveal the cockpit and put your clone to pilot it. pop-up gunner mechanism: well the backdoor have a thing to attack to the seat of the gunner. the top hatch is very loose. so it there is a clone as a gunner and you open the back door, the clone will pop-up and automatically open the hatch on top. this is how the top looks like without a clone. there is this movable cannon (upwards, left and right) and a little keyboard thing with it. but the cannon fall off quite easily. the flick launching missile mechanism: the mechanism is on both side and you need to turn the thing inwards to reveal the flick fire mechanism. below are the pic of how it is turned. you can keep you blaster at the front of the side. there are place for you to store them. it close nicely. completion: this is how it looks like. extra parts: there quite a number of them. overall: this set is not bad. the price is quite expensive but you will like it. the pop-up mechanism is something new (to me) but this set have more function and 2 clone trooper with a pack of commander gear. pros: -2x clone troopers -high playability -nice design cons: -a little expensive -sticker sheet -cannon on top falls off quite easy edited by kimt, 27 august 2008 - 12:16 pm.

0 thanks for that very elaborate review nice to have several pics from different angels. amazingly well done if this is your first i've added a poll and will index this review within this week (along with all the other topics i am to index )

0 yes, the review is great indeed, i love in-depth reviews with tons of photos! as for the set - i'm not planning to buy it, but it looks ok. i think it's a good tank.

0 wow, this is one great review! fantastic pictures, this looks like one cool set with heaps of neat functions. a shame it doesn't include exclusive figures (like ahsoka and captain rex in the at-te or plo koon and asajj ventress in the gunship), but you can't have everything. so again, thanks for this sweet review! ~peace

1 bad quality pictures? what's wrong with them? this is a great review and thanks! i was planning on buying this set and no others but the price stunned me. thus i bought the at-te and the rgs.... the set is better than i thought though; i might do as mutley did and make my own!

0 thank you kimt for adding the poll. hehe. this is my first review so, i'm not so confident about the pictures. thank you guys for viewing and commenting.

0 nice review i hope i can get this set [as well as agents, city & other sw stuff...] and nice pics, i didnt think they were bad, i thought they were pretty good

1 thanks for the really cool review baby . i think this is an awesome first attemp for your first review: it flows well, really good pics and many pics . in the set, i think this is a good purchase i will buy it when it comes out in the us and i think it is cool looking and the fuctions look neat . edited by darkrebellion, 26 august 2008 - 11:12 pm.

1 wow, this ship is really big, judging from the size of its hull!!! wondering where can i keep it when i've bought it. ;)

0 mattzitron, on aug 13 2005, 11:30 pm, said: the strange thing is, for the first time i can remember the minifigs came decapitated, and there's no neckwear. i recall jake saying something about it being new lego policy to supply the minifig heads and torsos separately. what with the expenses-trimming and all, it's apparently one of the many little quirky things they've discovered in the manufacturing and packaging process that people have done for years without thinking (in this case, putting the heads on the torsos) but that turns out to be a surprisingly significant expense (timewise, i suppose). think it was in one of his blog posts, but not sure. too tired (ie, lazy) to go hunting for it now, sorry >-|

-1 but does this mean that they add to the piece count? is it a super secret clever way to make the piece count seem bigger than it is? hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm |:| addition i've built it, review up later tonite but here's this to wet your appetite.

-1 it's a shame it only comes with two figs. it would be great for my ancient middle-east project.

1 thanks for the pics so far. will you have high-res pics of the other sets in the instructions?

-1 mattzitron, you have done well to display images of the dung stain hull... its a darn shame that it can't be extended. however, i see no reason why lego couldn't produce a special middle hull piece that is compatible. although the way they've made the hull is a bit stupid. the old system was a lot more flexible. better still why can't lego design a hull that can be extended in length and width... then they could be as made as long or wide as desired and that would be great!

-1 they have made a special middle piece in this 4+ set: http://www.brickset....aspx?set=7075-1 the only problem is that it's red.

1 good work samsta! no wonder i wasn't aware. 4+ pirates and all...

1 i'm interested in the scan of the back... i have an idea for a new avatar. :)

1 right so here's my review (finally). the whole gallery of box, parts, minifigs and finished model is here, over 2 pages. so on with the show. minifigs http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1340864 in the set you get krakaroff (i dunno how to spell it) and victor krum. the figs are exactly the same, bar their heads. these are two fantastic figures, the expression on krakaroff's face is priceless. judging by the design i think we might get a yellow krakaroff cropping up somewhere, which would make me a happy bunny (he'd make a fantastic viking) ideally i'd have liked more than 2 figures for my money, three would have done it, i think 2 is too few. piece count http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344573 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344571 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344572 for a ?40 set, the piece count is quiet good, i don't know the exact number but when building it, i didn't feel short changed, bar the exception of the hull. now i don't hate the hull, my problem is that is doesn't connect with bricks like the old pirate ships. there are pros and cons to this, on the plus side its more secure, and your whole ship doesn't need to be taken up with support structure. the negative side being, you can't really make it bigger (as they've only released a megablocking 4+ set with the right piece, and its the wrong color). i also like how its wide, meaning you can fit loads of minifigs on the main deck. overall though i liked the pieces. of note are gold studs (http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344510) (5 in total, you get one spare), the return of the black falcon shields (http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1340835) and the new drumstrang shields. the construction a simple fun build. nothing too fiddly. the finished model http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344474 (big picture) i really like this set. there's no bones about it. it seems lego with the latter half of 2005 have given people who loved their original pirate ships hope for the future with this and the fantastic viking longboat. even with the two 4+ pieces (the hull, and front of the ship) i wasn't put off. http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1340841 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344461 the front of the ship is a nice piece, and can be used for stuff like castles. http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344490 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344491 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344492 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344494 and the hull isn't all bad. what i really liked was the little cargo hold, at the moment i have a treasure chest in there, but there' space for about eight of them i reckon. playability wise it does make alot of sense, and as you can see you can imprision minifigs below deck. http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344484 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344488 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344506 http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344500 the quarters are great as well. you can comfortably fit about six minifigs in the main gally, three by the steering wheel, and a couple up above the top cabin. you could fit more, but it'd look strange. my only gripe is the design of the top cabin. when you want to open it up, you have to remove the mast. i know its simple enough, but i think that it wouldn't have taken much for tlc to design it better. but saying that its easily done, and i like how the cabin can be lifted with ease from the steering deck. http://www.brickshel...y.cgi?i=1344540 the final play feature is the plank. you can while away the hours murdering hapless minifigs who've displeased the cabin. a really nice addition for pirate fans. the final verdict[/b playability: 9.5/10 - lots to do for all the kids. piece count: 9/10- a great selection, loses one for the hull. figures: 8/10 - just needs one more! construction: 9/10 - nice and simple. value: 8.5/10 - let down a bit by lack of minifigs, and the cons of the hull. [b]overall: 8.8/10 overall this is a set worth getting, especially if you miss proper pirates. it wouldn't take much to turn this into an amazing pirate ship moc. hope you liked my review. matt

1 [burns]excellent...[/burns] i love those parts shots, great stuff in there! this really is a good sign for the new line, hopefully there'll be the same level of usefulness in the others. thanks for taking the time to finish it up! did you scan the back of the instructions?

1 i received this set with a $25 gift card, so it was a great buy. it follow with a similar build to the 2007 trucks, but has a few improvements. of course, the name of the set could have been a bit more creative... and yes, this was an academy review. set name: truck and forklift number: 7733 pieces: 343 theme: city year released: 2008 price: $25.00 usd, ?19.99 gbp, 24.00 euro 1/box now the box follows a design similar to most other city sets. it has the set information and photo of the set on the front, (sorry for it getting cut off, i will remake it). now the back of the box shows what each bag builds. bag 1 is for the forklift, bag 2 is for the cab, and bags 3 and 4 are for the containers. it also has the set's features. 2/contents the instructions: there are 2 books included with the set: one for the forklift, and one for the truck. minifigure(1) the first minifig you build is a simple cargo worker. interesting/new parts: here we have some interesting and new parts. they include a yellow seat, a 1x2 plate with clips, and a 1x4 slope. 3/the build cargo1 the first cargo palette has a few crates on it. i really like the sticker on the small box. forklift: the forklift is a very fun extra to build, and it is probably the best forklift that we have had so far. it is very realistic and is very strong. cargo2 the next piece of cargo is some octan barrels on a meter. i am not sure what it is supposed to be, but it is still a nice addition to the set. minifgure(2) the second minifigure is a classic driver with sunglasses and a coffee mug. very nice. new piece! this is a very nice new piece that is included in the set, a hollow canopy. i believe it is also in white with the police mobile command station. truck: now anyone who has had one of the lego city harbor sets from last year, then you will probably find this build to be very similar. mostly in the cab part of the truck. the trucks build is very solid, and very realistic. i sense ths will bring the ratings up quite a bit. mystery cargo: for some time specualtion has been going around, what exactly is this? it seems like nuero poison.. i am very happy with those 2x2 cylinders in trans-yellow. in fact, you can join in and guess what it may be in this topic. containers: the first container is built to hold one palette. it fits onto the truck. it produces a very pleasing result, and has a better look to it than the containers from last year had. the second container has the ability to hold two palettes, and has a design similar to the first. then, you build on the wheels. the back ones have beautiful mudflaps! finshed set: ---------------------------------- parts: 10/10 (lots of useful pieces, great colors, and some very cool new pieces.) minifigs: 8/10 (i would have liked another but it was $25, so i guess its okay.) price per part: 10/10 (almost 350 pieces for $25. ) playability: 8/10 (forklifts are always fun, and there are lots of things to do with this set.) overall: 36/40 90% a- this is truley an outstanding set, and it will make a great addition to anyones collection. mocers would aslo like this, due to the fact that it has some really nice parts. it has a great build, and utilizes some awesome new techniques. it also has details, something you might look for in a set. highly recommended. hope everyone enjoyed the review! if you have any pic requests, questions, etc., please ask! i look forward to hearing your comments, and the judges comments as well. 7733 peeron.com 7733 bricklink catalog 7733 shop at home

1 very nice review of a set that i've been dying to get, but my friendly neighborhood lego store never seems to have in stock. the yellow seat is most definitely not a new piece. i had two of those in my old beta-1 command base, almost 30 years ago!!

1 metalandi, on aug 27 2008, 03:26 pm, said: thanksfor this review, i also got this set recently, and i'm very happy about it. i live the design of these new trucks, and the forklift is also great. not to forget the good amount of cargo. btw., i think the "mysterious cargo" only are normal fuel barrels thanks! normail fuel would be in those octan barrels...

1 a very fine set indeed and something at least a little different to the more usual city sets. sweet! and it could even be a little sweeter to me with car doors... well, nevermind. thanks for that very nice review, ~vbbn~!

0 great review! i dig this set. it could have only been better if it had been a 6-wide version of the old 6367 semi-truck. still i ask: what's so special about the special edition?

0 kimt, on aug 27 2008, 05:00 pm, said: hmm...good question. let's hope our reviewer can help us out here. and i can. the set is exclusive to lego brand retail stores, lego s@h, and toys "r" us only.

0 that explains why it isn't in our local stores. i also got it from s@h, but my box hasn't got the "special edition printing" on it, surprisingly.

1 nice review, vbbn! i stumbled upon your yellow seat as well. didnt you have one already or what made you think its new? the big letdown on this set is the big canopy. i would have preferred single bricks for that. and for this truck there is no real need for a hollow canopy - it could as well have been made of solid bricks. maybe we get another set with different use of the canopy. this is one of the reasons i didnt buy it so far. and im especially not interested in another forklift, i have plenty of those... i agree its the best one we have seen so far though.

1 today i shall be reviewing 8290 mini forklift, which i recieved when i went to tru to get a technic set. so enjoy! set name: mini forklift number: 8290 theme: technic parts: 89 price: $10.99 1/box the box for this set is suprisingly small. it's about the size of a $3.99 set. it shows the main forklift, and the set information. the back of the box features the dragster. a very cool model, and the suspension works perfectly. 2/contents we have two instruction booklets; one for the forklift and one for the dragster. the bags: here are a few interesting pieces: the long double pin in blue, a bionicle connecter joint, and a yellow l joint. 3/build we start off build nice and solid, with your average technic build: the following steps build up the detail of the bottom part. next comes the cab. it's pretty simple yet effective. after that comes the forks. they work very well, but if you have the palatte on them, and you let go, it might topple off. hint: put the edge of the palatte on the small lip on the pieces that connect to the forks. this will hold it on better. the finished product and palatte: extra pieces(keep them, as they are used to build the alternate model): here is something that i found- how to put a minifigure into the cab. first, remove the side doors. then, set the fig into the cab, with his arm sticking slightly out the gap. and finaly, seal off the cab. a nice way to put system into technic for your towns. ---------------------------- parts: 9/10(loving them all.) price per part ratio: 8/10(somewhat pleaseing) playability: 9/10: works in any system town, and has a great dragster alternate model. overall: 26/30 86% b+ overall i would definatly recommend this set to anyone, whether you are a system or technic fan, this is perfect. it has great parts, and is pretty cheap. the alternate model is also very good. i hope you all enjoyed my review! i have made the pictures the requested size on my camera. i look forward to hearing your comments. edited by ~vbbn~, 27 august 2008 - 07:02 pm.

1 thats really a sweet and charming little technic set, thanks for that fine review!

0 what that? looks like a walker! an imperial walker? no??.. theme: space, blacktron i set name: alienator set number: 6876 number of pieces: 82 figures:1 released: 1988 list price: ?.99 (it seem no source online has the price) peeron.com bricklink.com as always lets have a look at the box first as i?m luck to own a boxed version of this set. walking across a planet with a grid pattern sky! the back shows a great selection of alternative models. after opening the box we find a single instruction booklet inside the instruction booklet now we come to the man in the black visor the mark i blacktron and black and industrial he look. in my opinion i think he probably has the second best lego space torso. before the focus group decided they needed to be brighter now turning to the walker itself, it?s a simple build which i don?t think even i with my great skills for messing up could get wrong. the final unit is built in three key parts. the command pod which is attached to the body by two pins at the back. the walker legs, this is pure design genius. simply built easy to replicate and no fancy parts. the top section which open to reveal the blacktrons high-tech tools. time to put the entire set together, i think you?ll agree it looks great for such a simple build. looking like you could take on the universe. a side view of the finished product. a frontal view of the alienator what the hell! how did that take down an at-at. this is one of my all time favourite lego space sets. actually i didn?t have it pre-dark age and only recently bought one. what attracted me to it was an old boxed set, but since then i?ve discovered a set that i wished i?d owned long ago. the rating system figures: 8/10 (i love the dark industrial space look) parts 7/10 (yes it may be nearly all black with some yellow highlights, but is have a good range and they fit to make several great models.) fun fun fun 8/10 (it walks well and it?s a great set, it has a large number of possible mods.) design 10/10 (it?s ingenious the walking mechanism is so simple and yet so good i can?t fault it price ?/10 (while i could tell you how much i paid i was luck on ebay so this remains a question mark) grand total 33/40 (reduced top level due to lack of price knowledge) conclusion. a set which in my opinion showcases what lego was about in the 1980?s. the set has an excellent design ethic and looks great, with very limited parts it retains great action and functionality. twinned with the great main model you?re shown that there are a number of other great models you can make with the same parts. this set is what it?s all about for me, i?m very glad i bought outside my normal theme when i saw this. actually on the strength of this set i recently order 6894 blacktron invader and can?t wait to get it and see if it lives up to the alienator.

1 a very original and perhaps even a little weird design indeed, but nice and creative for sure! thanks for that good review!

1 i loved all of these "walker" sets. it was such a smart technique. i made one myself with what i had ...ahhh good times! thanks for the great review.

0 the y-wing is the work horse of the rebel alliance. its well armed and heavily armoured, but youll need it because youll be moving like a sleepy hut!  general rieekan set name: y-wing starfighter set number: 7658 number of pieces: 454 figures:2 released: 2007 list price: 39.99 lets us begin with the box. the front shows it in all its swooshing glory. http://tdy.org.uk/images/7658-02.jpg the back shows some of the many features of the set and also others you might like to buy in the star wars range. after opening the box we find a single instruction booklet now we come to an important aspect of any star wars set the figure, here were provided with an anomalous rebel pilot and his faithful r5 droid. the pilot comes with the fairly standard lego star wars non-hero helmet printing. whats he going to do with the blaster taken on the entire empire? one of the more interesting parts is the assembly of the engine, which if like me you dont pay enough attention to the instructions when building you can end up getting wrong. the key detail i got wrong. just before fitting the last engine. if we look carefully on the side we can see a missile launcher. i didnt think torpedoes or concussion missiles were fired from there but i may be wrong. after fitting the engine the models looks like this. in all its glory. manning one of the alliances fighters. not so ready to take on the empire was he? so overall we have a well designed model, which is in my opinion far superior to the original we were offered with darth vader way back when lego star wars was new. this y-wing is sleek and looks great in my opinion, the firing missiles are also a great touch. the rating system figures: 5/10 (for the same price the last x-wing had far more figures) parts 6/10 swooshability 9.5/10 design 9/10 price 3/10 grand total 32.5/50 not to shabby. conclusion. so finally the answers to the questions youve no doubt want to know is the set worth the price. ill be frank 39.99 is too much for this set. despite this i currently have a squadron of three y-wings, the reasons is this set has been on sale a number of times at 30 its certainly worth the money. lego recently placed them online with a price of 20, this i think was a great price for the set and well work picking one or more up if you wanted to start your own rebellion.

1 thanks for the review. i'll add it to the index. the y-wing is one of my favourite rebel fighters and this set justifies the coolest fighter

1 a wonderful set and a really charming design, well detailed and pretty smooth at the same time. perhaps that small gap at the cockpits an a little weak point, but we can always mod a little. thanks for that very neat review, cardinal brick!

(yoda has my email :p hehe) actually i had read of the naked swooshing before, but alas, my y-wing swooshing was in my workplace where it's generally accepted that you keep your clothes very much on. it's a completely different story when i'm at home though...

1 i like the model, it is one of the best rebel sets out there. but i don't like it that there is no landing gear. when you set this one on the floor/ your rebel base it looks like it crashed or something and looses its look of superiority actually quite fast. it needs to be at least 2 studs high, if not more, from the ground. tlc is in these days afraid of flimsy landing gear, as they gave to us in the early sw time. now they want something sturdy for playability. but i think there should have been some details on the bottom, especially a landing gear that unfolds. i also don't like the mistake of tlc (that they changed this year with the release of indy hopefully) to give the pilot a usual smile face. the old yellow version of gold leader even had a headgear. i hope tlc realised this year that we want more detailed faces. well, the licenced sets we got proved that, but who knows. the upsides of this set are the amount of pieces and detail, especially the engines were fun to build and perhaps the most interesting construction i have seen in years. also it is big, bulky and looks sleek at the same time, just wonderful. and next to the 4502 x-wing it looks in the perfect size! i gave this the highest rating, even if the underside disappoints. but whatever, it is lego, you can add some landing gear on your own! thanks for the review, your pics were really really good, next time make more of them please!

1 stauder, on aug 29 2008, 12:37 pm, said: don't aregue with him when it comes to y-wings. he offerd to swoosh one in the nude... stauder. indeed...

0 i think it is a fair to ask questions here with the expectation of a new y-wing in the coming year. i came here to look at the review even though it is a few years old. no images to go with the review. bummer. i'd like to see a more friendly tolerance on dated threads being bumped.

-1 maybe the thread should be locked or taken down since the pics consist of broken links. kind of a pointless review without the pics. and for the record, there are other websites with preliminary images of some the new 2012 sets that are not on the eurobrick star wars 2012 rumors thread. perhaps that banned fellow was hoping some of the lego insiders had some knowledge about it. i guess we'll never know now. edited by sharky, 22 september 2011 - 09:22 pm.

1 and lo! it came from the east (denmark) the set which had been foretold the cheap army builder and there was much rejoicing amongst the castle fans. the cardinal then asked was all the rejoicing justified.. set name: the knight set number: 5615 number of pieces: 21 figures:1 released: 2008 list price: 2.00 lets us begin with the box. the front shows us are knight and his rack of arms. the back shows us two sets from the castle range. moving inside the box now. the contents of the box, it doesnt look like much. the instructions to help you through the build. now the reason you probably bought the set, well at least why i did the knight. this features the new torso for 2008 and is the height of fashion. this brings the number of printed torsos from the crown knights to three, which allows for a greater variety in building your armies. a new fashion sensation and all the must have accessories for this season. with a more heavily armoured look hes ready for anything. the rest of the set is a weapons rack, i assume that once youve got a few of these set youll probably like me give up building them and part them out. but anyway here are some pictures of what the rest of the elements are spent on. a long and complex build begins. after 360 hour finally its finished sadly five minfigs were hurt in the construction of this rack. now the money shot, where we can see it all come together. it looks great even the rack doesnt look to bad. sadly are hero wasnt ready for other themes just yet. in total we have a good army builder which castle fans have wanted. however there remains a question in my mind as to if this set is good enough on its own. without any other castle sets i cant see it being to much fun so its not a good present. the rating system figures: 9/10 (great new fashion for this season ) parts 8/10 (shield, sword, spear, helmet and armour what more could i want? well two shields.) fun fun fun 3/10 (sadly its rather dull on its own i cant think or to much else to do.) design 7/10 (yes its the army builder ive wanted design, well apart from that pirate one.) price 9/10 (at 2.00 what more can i say.) grand total 36/50 (let down by being to small to stand alone..) conclusion. so lets answer the question, is it the army all castle fans have wanted? well yes and no is the answer. while it is a great set and at the now reduced uk price of 2.00 amazing value. i still think its inferior compared with the army building capability of cross bow attack, i much prefer army building both factions at once.

-1 do we really need more construction works? legoland is just one huge building site. theme: city set name: mini digger set number: 7246 number of pieces: 36 figures:1 released: 2005 list price: $3.50 (usd) 7426 peeron.com 7246 bricklink catalog diving right in let get some photos of the box the digger at work. the back just has more of the same not to inspiring. once we open the box we find two poly bags and some instructions the total contents of the box, well minus the air instruction booklet short and simple. now the single minfig of the set, nothing new of special that i can see. got a job working construction for the johnstown company. moving onto the digger itself, its one of those builds where all you really need is a quick glance at the instructions and off you go. side view of the finished product. alternative view, it doesnt look to bad. now lets add our construction worker. looks rather good, though the lifting action isnt smooth. its nothing special, its not the greatest construction set that lego have ever produced but i think it is worth the money. the arm action really does bug me though. the rating system figures: 5/10 (just another construction peon.) parts 4/10 (nothing novel and i dislike the new digger arm system.) fun fun fun 7/10 (i think the playability is high and you can get a good load of bricks in the bucket.) design 6/10 (not the best designed digger but not the worst.) price 7/10 (a reasonable price for what you get) grand total 29/50 still halfway decent but nothing to write home about conclusion. this set is yet another in a long line of lego digger and to be honest its not the best in my opinion. i still hold nostalgic memories for 6504 which i still think is a great digger. from my point of view the set sits to high off the ground and make me wonder how the worker gets in. i really dont like the digging arm action it will never be smooth and while it poses better i just think its inferior. despite this i still think its not a bad set, id just like it to be so much more.

1 another fine review! i love the last (action) picture. thanks for sharing! btw, i am so looking forward to that 384 london bus review.

1 cardinal brick, on aug 27 2008, 10:02 pm, said: got a job working construction for the johnstown company. one of the greatest songs ever written. but now onto the review, i really like your pictures the quality and lighting is amazing. i never gave this set much attention, but now it looks pretty good to me, also can't wait for your next review, i have never seen this bus before!

1 finaly we get a new mech for takeshi. and yes, it's yellow. it brings back some flashbacks of supernova. good times. anyways, i recieved this set at christmas last year, with 3 other ef sets. set name: assault tiger number: 8113 pieces: 163 theme: exo-force year released: 2008 price: 15.00 usd, 18.95 eur 1/box the boxes this year are much different than those from previous years. it has some gaps in it, and has a cardboard backround inside of it. the box itself shows assault tiger and the set information. the back shows a combiner. the cardboard backdrop: a very nice jungle look to it. it has lots of fog as well, creating a pale effect. 2/contents the instructions: the instructions are clear, and straight-forward. also included is a lego "blooper." the remains of the sticker sheet: the stickers aren't too bad. i didn't apply the saw sticker as i wanted it to be left plain. the buzzsaw: a very cool piece. mocists will love this. 3/build the figures: the figures included are takeshi, who features a nice new torso. also included is the mini robot. his is a very neat little guy, but sadly, he doesn't really become a weapon. more of a block of red and black bricks. the torso: now the torso design for assault tiger is very different from the past years. it now uses a castle-like piece as the main structure. also of note is that he has a mini throne. no controls, sadly. and with the orange cockpit piece, it's impossible to see takeshi when looking at the at close on. see the third pic. the legs: the legs are slightly similar to the mt-201 ultra drill walker's, but have been modified to fit the at. they are quite large, and suit their purpose. the arms: the arms follow a new design, but the only problem is, they have no elbow or hand articulation. nice weapons though. the finished product: ----------------------- parts: 10/10 (lots of useful pieces, great colors, and some very cool new pieces.) minifigs: 8/10 (a robot would have been nice, and a better weapon mode for the mini-robot would have been good.) price per part: 7/10 (a stretch...) playability: 8/10 (the lack of elbow and wrist articulation isn't the greatest. overall: 33/40 82.5% b- assault tiger is a nice set, but some of those small little things can truly take a toll on the final rating. i think that i would only recommend this set to anyone who wants the yellow, and hardcore exo-force fans. s@h link peeron link i hope you enjoyed the review, and if you have any pic requests or questions, please ask. edited by sinner, 01 september 2008 - 01:52 am.

1 thanks for the review, ~vbbn~. i have to say, ef has never really caught my attention, but this set seems alright. to be honest, when i saw the topic title, i was expecting a tiger- looking mech. the mech itself is cool, except for the huge leg pieces. i think the minifigs are great in ef sets, with the dark colored outfits, like dark red or dark green.

1 thanks for that good review, ~vbbn~. thats really a fine and pretty solid looking mecha. i think that the designers did a good job on this last wave of ef sets, and the inclusion of these mini robots was also a pretty smart idea!

1 nice to see a well done review. this set is one of the few exo-force sets i haven't built myself yet, but i will get it on sale, guess soon. i'm do not like the use of slizer-style ball-joints in exo-force, even though they are modified to 2x2 bricks. in this particular set i think the arms look weak, and they lack elbow joint like the "green 2008 mech" set. (forgot name of this years green mech). quite a shame, i find it really hurts the functionality of that "green" set and could imagine the same with the "tiger". i guess with the new pyramide brick as cockpit, the cockpit is still open from the sides and the back. i modified my "green 2008 mech", which use the same cockpit design, with a few green bricks, and it is now completely closed from all sides. i rate the tiger at average, but i may change my mind when i get to build it myself. front

1 since my last post i've had the chance to build the tiger, and i was surprised in a good way. a much better set than i actually thougth. front

1 i just bought 2 of them since they were 5$ each from lego. i really wish they did not cancel this series.

-1 i voted "average". i think this is the least attractive among the 2008 exo-force sets. i saved my money to buy some of the 2006 mechas.

1 i think this is almost the best set in the exo force line. i really like the orange cockpit peice

1 what do you mean the trolls should outnumber the crown knight? how are you going to manage that? well heres the answer. theme: castle set name: troll warrior set number: 5618 number of pieces: 19 figures:1 released: 2008 list price: 2.50 (gbp) $3.50 (usd) 2.99 (euro) 5618 peeron.com 5618 bricklink catalog 5618 shop at home lets us begin with the box. the troll warrior and his might cart. set sets for children to pester for at christmas. now for whats inside. the contents of the box, it doesnt look like much. now for the troll himself, im glad they selected this troll torso rather than the other one for the impulse set i think this one is the superior one. also he comes well armed with a spear and sword but no shield sadly. someone really needs to look at the rodent problem in the castle sets.. now the cart, nice easy construction as with all impulse sets, im still not convinced by the flicking missiles. a line of those would do some damage. what an oncoming army can expect to see.. all together now and it looks rather good. so there we have it a cheap way of bolstering the troll army and outfitting them with some more weapons. also for anyone planning a pied piper moc another set with a rat in it. the rating system figures: 8/10 (|preferred troll torso and helmet style. ) parts 7/10 (two spears and a sword but sadly lacking that all important shield.) fun fun fun 4/10 (somewhat more to do on its own that other impulse at least the troll can fight the rat!) design 7/10 (well designed even the flicker missile doesnt look bad) price 8/10 (at 2.50 more than the other castle impulse.) grand total 34/50 (lack of a shield and to small to stand alone for my rating system..) conclusion. castle fans got a great army builder with the knight and theyve been lucky enough to receive another one with this set. im glad weve got a troll impulse as it allow for enlarging the armies of evil some the crown knight dont totally outnumber all their opponents.

1 best impulse set so far. thanks for sharing your thoughts and yes, someone should look into that rodent issue. i'll add this to the index within long

1 good review. i got 2 of those. wheels are very useful, especially if you don't have any :) as for shields - i don't imagine trolls use them too much. i think that they fight berserk style - all out assault. one complaint is the piece that the wheels are attached to - its a single piece, with smaller than the standard pin connection. so you cant change the width of the cart for your mocs using the wheels. i don't know if a piece with such a connection only on one side exists though ....

0 thanks for the interview, i nearly forgot this set is out yet. maybe i'll grab one off my local store tomorrow.

0 wait a second, a "troll"?? isn't that an orc? i thought that this is a troll:

1 nice review, makes me want 3 honestly. and comgratz on becoming a teacher in the reviewer's academy.

-1 i'm not really impressed by this set as much as other impulse sets. the knight impulse set #5615 offers more in my opinion since it gives two helmets, two weapons, a shield and an armor piece along with the weapon rack. i'm not a fan in the slightest of flickfire missles and projectiles like on the cart, and the previously mentioned one piece axle limits the wheel usage in other mocs. i would've liked to see an added chest armor piece at the very least and a shield would've made this great. those things are so rare and it would've bumped the piece count up to 21 to match the knight set. since both are showing the same price on s@h(in us dollars at least), it would've made sense.

-1 thank you for the nice review. the set is not that bad, but a shield would be a nice addition. i also don't like the flickfire missile. a camp site with a fire and a chickenleg would also be nice about the rat; isn't it just foodsupply for the troll? the only problem would than be that the food is running away.

0 thats the problem i couldnt quite tell what, its a bit of a problem in a reviewer. maybe a hose to clip to the fire hydrant i dont know.

1 brick built robot, surely we?re getting near classic space now? theme: space, mission mars set name: mini-robot set number: 5616 number of pieces: 24 figures:1 released: 2008 list price: 2.50 (gbp) $3.50 (usd) 2.99 (euro) 5616 peeron.com 5616 bricklink catalog 5616 shop at home let look at the box first. space man approaching the robot from behind. i?m not sure you can still buy the base easily anymore. the contents of the box. the contents of the box, it?s rather white. fairly standard mission mars spaceman, he?s got printing front and back but sadly no air tank! how does he breath? *as has been pointed out he does have a printed tank but i'd rather a physical one* note the megaphone is in flashlight mode not weapon mode, that?s important.. the robot itself feels a bit clumsy the metal detector is never going to touch the ground and it feel a bit wide. i don?t like the look of him something in the eyes. the reason why so we can have a box to put crystals in. both together and ready to explore new worlds etc. sadly the robot was homicidal, remember in space no one can hear you scream. it?s not a bad impulse set and if it marks the return of brick built robots to space then it?s a good thing. i just feel the robot could have been better built. the rating system figures: 6/10 (not to bad but nothing wonderful) parts 6/10 (lots of white and not much orange, but where?s the air tank!) fun fun fun 6/10 (probably the best impulse set as a stand alon toy lots to do with a robot and his human boss) design 5/10 (the robot feels clumsily put together i think it needs work) price 8/10 (can?t fault the impulse price.) grand total 31/50 (not well designed but does have more play value than other impulse sets.) conclusion. i was surprised that mission mars got impulse sets as it didn?t seem to sell as well as other lines last year. however i think this is a fairly good set, it has more playability than other sets and does come with a metal detector been a while since i?ve seen one (though i could be wrong) sadly the robot isn?t as good as it could be. edited by sinner, 01 september 2008 - 01:30 am.

0 opps well thatll teach me to do reviews without my glasses! thanks for pointing that out stauder.

-1 nice review and quite funny now i'll never turn my back on a robot again. poor set. i find this set bad, even for an impulse,. the robot is poorly designed and without any use. the space minifig is ok. i'd rather get another impulse set than this. except the other life on mars mars mission impulse sets.

0 something i forgot to mention is that great review xenologer, on aug 28 2008, 08:28 pm, said: makes me think i ought to try modding the robot later... mod the robot? why? you should see the interior! stauder.

1 kimt, on aug 28 2008, 09:52 pm, said: i'd rather get another impulse set than this. except the other life on mars mars mission impulse sets. actually i kinda like the crystal hawk impulse. the default model isn't that great but you get a few nice wing plates to work with (after rearranging it looks pretty good). i guess this one though, is good for some nice parts, tho its pretty limited in what you can rebuild it into, and it seems less value because the astronaut has no vehicle... best impulse set has to be the troll warrior... feels very 'complete', and space orcs are always nice to have...

1 this here was a set that i new i had to get. a beautiful minfig, amazing minfigs, what more could you want? so was this set worth it? i guess you will just have to read the review to find out! set name: the batcycle: harley quinn's hammer truck number: 7886 pieces: 267 theme: batman year: 2008 price: 35.00 usd, 44.96 euro 1/box the new box art for batman is pretty stunning. it's clean, and really sells the set. for this set, harley quinn's truck is pictured attacking batman, with the set information. the back of the box shows a nice little comic, the other sets, as well as the set functions. 2/contents the instructions: the instructions for the set are, as always, clear and straightforward. they display the colors well, and have what we expect in an instruction book. 3/build minifigs: the stars of the set! batman is back with a new torso, much more metalic than before. harley had all new printed torso, legs, a new head, and that sweet new hat. batcycle: the bottom part is very sturdy thanks to a small bit of technic. the red throws it off a bit, but it isn't seen once the top part is put on. it has a nice use of the smoke stacks, and looks very nice in the end. the top part is simple, but suits the purpose well. it has handle bars, and a nice motor. the blue is a little strange though. hammer truck: the hammer truck begins with a very sturdy base. it has lots of detail, and really looks cool. rims added: lego did a very nice job at giving it a checker board appearence. the only problem here is that you stick a sticker over two bricks, multiple times. jewels: inside of the crate are these shining jewels. look how they illuminate the darkness in gotham... more added: then, we add on a spoiler and the crate. looking very nice now. the detail is again, outstanding, and it has a good amount of smoothness to it. the infamous hammer! okay, i haven't said this yet, but the square pieces need to stop. first on those sw backta tanks, now on the hammer? it creates a sloppy look for the hammer. still, this is the ultimate wacking weapon. added to the truck: on the truck it works pretty well. but the handle is to short, and it's near impossible to smash batman. the finished truck: the finished truck is really nice. the big wheels give it the monster truck feel, and the way that lego alternated the colors works well. the cockpit is a little palin, but that's not a major issue. the "i love joker" sticker is one of the best stickers i've seen. it's simply a classic. the finished set: ---------------------------- parts: 9/10 (lot's of good mocing pieces, and red and black are always usefull.) minifigs: 10/10 (awesome!) playability: 9/10 (the hammer is a little short) price-per-part: 8/10 (it's a liscensed theme, so meh.) set 7886 is a very nice set, and has some great details in it. the minifigs are very cool as well. however, their are some flaws. first, the hammer is two short, and is kind of square. the batcycle has a few awkward colors in it, which throws it off a bit. this set is definatly worth the money. batman fans will love it. and also wacking fans will like it, for that hammer... and if you would like to buy this set, here are a few useful links: s@h link peeron link please let me know your comments. and pic requests and questions are welcome!

0 i saw two stickers next to the window. one said "whack him" but i can't make out the other one. can you post a picture of it? good review, by the way!

1 cues the indy theme song let's follow indy on his pursuit on the stolen ark. indy rides full speed ahead on his white horse, but the nazis are pulling away! will indiana jones be able to grab on to the truck and reclaim the treasure? or will the nazis and their high-powered mercedes trucks prevail? let's find out! 7622 race for the stolen treasure set info set name: 7622 race for the stolen treasure theme: indiana jones released: 2008 price: 29.99 usd 34.95 euro 24.99 gbp pieces: 272 minifigs: 4 price per piece: about 11 cents and now, the main event! first, the box shots the front shows a nice image of indy on his horse, trying to make it on to the truck, and the attack truck taking aim. the back this side shows some of the features of the set, in little pictures on the left. instruction manual not much to say here, as it's the same picture as on the box. inside the manual on one of the last pages we have a nice picture like the one on the back of the box, showing some features of the set. random manual pic here we have the nice piece call-outs that we have come to expect lately. the bags were numbered as well. the pieces a nice selection here, especially if you like black, dark bley and bley. "cool" pieces the golden treasure chest has a really nice sparkle to it. the set also has a good assortment of coins and jewels, and some wonderful silver 1x1 dots. the canvas covering this is quite nice. it has a nice dark tan color, and some nice detail on it as well. the minifigs first comes indy's beautiful white horse. i always like lego animals and this one is no exception. here are the figs on the left indiana jones, and his nice stubble, printed legs, side bag and the best lego hat in history. and the nazis, peter, hans, and klaus. their torsos are very nice and the hats are amazing. they look really nice with all of their tan. the extra parts here you get two of the nice silver 1x1s, some clear 1x1s, and the usual technic pins and levers. now the finished set! first we have the attack truck the truck looks very good. it looks very military like with the colors and the design. it is designed wonderfully with really nice mudguards and a well-detailed front. the only fault of this is i think the top part where the gunner stands is a bit bare. the front here you can see the front, which has a nice smooth look with some nice details as well. the front ridged piece works well here. the gun this is well made. it is built by attaching a lightsaber hilt in a sort of videocamera piece. the actual area where the guy stands is pretty bare, but not too bad. backside of the truck the spare tire here is a simple, but nice touch. a side view the mudguards are smartly built by clipping wing flaps on to handle plates. this part gets a bit tedious, but the end result is worth it. the big boy cargo truck! this is another really well built truck. it has a lot of the same design elements as in the smaller truck, such as the mudguards. front view the front of this truck is as nice or better than the other truck. it uses good snot building, and everything fits in well. a close-up view of the tire area just behind the tire you can see those silver 1x1s being used as the suspension. this is a really nice addition and it looks great. note: it's only visual suspension. it is not supposed to work. the canvas cover in action now the canvas attaches by putting the holes in the canvas, on some little blue technic pins and then clamping them down with the hinged pieces. it looks really nice and curves nicely. the windscreen treasure! my favorite piece in action. i took this picture with the flash on, so you can see how it sparkles. i think we have waited far too long for this great piece. the complete set! everything all together. indy is chasing fast! indy's got it! brickshelf folder now, for the ratings! price: 9/10 (not bad, but could have slightly more pieces. at least it has 4 minifigs and that makes up for it.) parts: 9/10 (a nice selection of parts, lots of greys and black.) design: 10/10 (the trucks are really well-designed, the mudguards are excellent.) playability: 8/10 ( i always like rolling the trucks across the floor. ) build: 9/10 (pretty good, but gets a bit repetitive in some parts.) overall: 45/50 brickset bricklink entry peeron lego s@h even after intense fighting, everyone always gets along when there's food to be eaten... "hey indy! vant some mustard?" "how about some ketchup?" summary this, and all of the other indiana jones sets are some of my favorites. they all have nice colors, good design, and great minifigs. although i need indy in a different outfit pretty soon. his outfit is starting to smell a bit ripe . this set in particular is very well designed, and i can't wait for some more indy next year. thanks, and happy building! edited by erdbeereis1, 29 august 2008 - 03:47 am.

0 great review! hmm, i notice that the leg of that old guy is not so perfect. perhaps you want to push it?

-1 nice review. i really want this set, but i think the 35 here is too much (more like 25 would suit) and haven't found it cheap enough on ebay yet incl. shipping.

1 very good, informative review. i really want this set but i never got around to buying it. i thought all of your photos are great and of good quality. keep it up!

1 great job on this review. i just that last picture. i've got a small remark to add. the first picture is not hosted on in your bs account. i suggest you download it on your pc and move it to your bs account. that way you can make sure it isn't going to disappear in the near future.

1 i love this set... indy is what got me back into lego.

1 i discovered this review a month ago and since that point in time, i could not get the image of the sparkling golden chest out of my mind. i finally just purchased the chest for myself. i suppose this is a testament to how well honed your picture taking skills are. this set is definitely a nice one. i'm not a lego indy collector, but i was tempted to purchase this set several times. the vehicles are very nicely detailed and have some cool building techniques, such as the wheel guards.

1 very good review

0 i keep looking at this set to buy. since i have 3 10$ cards now maybe i will go pick it up at the lego store next month. so many things i want.

1 great review, i was debating on whether or not to snag this up before its gone, and i think i will, great review and thanks again!

1 this set is nice it looks like a dhl van

1 legoman132, on aug 29 2008, 03:35 pm, said: this set is nice it looks like a dhl van funny, thats what i thought when i first saw the pics good review btw oh and i keep meaning to get this set but keep forgeting..

-1 good review, thanks! for the mail van, while it certainly adds interaction and fun to a lego town, it alone lacks details and playability, and thus not a good set, especailly taking its price into consideration. its value is pretty much just like, if not less than, some impulse sets, in my opinion...

1 it's a good set, but i think the first sticker shouldn't say "7731"

1 legoman132, on aug 29 2008, 06:35 am, said: this set is nice it looks like a dhl van makes you wonder if there was some kind of promo or hookup in the pipeline that never happened?? i have this set and i really like it. it works well with either the new city sets or with my older 1980s/1990s sets. i actually like the use of the old style car base and mourned the day that these became exitinct the first time round (c1990). thanks for the review! cheers rog

-1 it's an ok set. i just don't really like the look of the van much. too rounded for my liking. what happened to the box like cars??

1 thanks for that very nice review, erdbeereis1. its great to see some other city sets beside the usual hospital, police and firefighter mayhem, and this is a really nice little one. now give me some car doors and a kevin costner-like mf and im a happy camper indeed, tlc...

1 nice review. i like this little set. some how it reminds me now of "postman pat" in dutch "pieter post", an english childrens tv series about a postman in a little village somewhere in yorkshire. aah, sweet memories i would rather have seen a postoffice released (with some women minifigs) instead of the green post bigplane. but maybe in a couple of years.

-1 rriggs, on aug 31 2008, 02:55 am, said: i actually like the use of the old style car base and mourned the day that these became exitinct the first time round (c1990). i don't hate the piece, but i did object to the way this set fills in the middle recessed area with a 2 x 2 plate that is nearly impossible to get out again without doing some damage to it. what's more, if you fill in the recessed area, you've eliminated the only rationale for using the car base in the first place.

1 what an outstanding review of a great set. i esp. like your intro. i have this set, but have not opened it yet. it looks like a fun little beach set. the new coast guard theme is very nice! edit: this set could almost pass for classic town, except for the use of orange and the lack of opening doors on the car. 5 stars!

1 great job! i will want to get this set soon. it's a lovely set, with some coast guard saving on the jet ski. what i don't like about this set, is the lack of doors. everything about this is nice, but i still have to give it a "4". as for the entire flow of review, i agreed with brickster that your introduction is very good. with the little amends i had added earlier, it turns out to be very good. keep it up.

1 a very good review of an especially charming and lovely set, thanks! the whole cg theme looks very nice to me with a good and detailed set design, and this ones no exception. although it would be nice to see more car doors and some new mf faces, though.

1 thanks for this review. i was thinking of getting this set and having read your review went out today and got it. what a great little set. what i particularly like: very sturdy build. feels very solid as you build the pickup (compared to the fire pickup & trailer i also have) the orange pieces (my first pieces in this colour!) the tyres which give the smoothest ride of any lego town/city vehicle i've ever built the raised suspension and side runners the coast guard dude (again a first for me) and his mega-cool flippers and aqualung the jetski controls - the handlebars actually move left to right which is a great detail little details that lego didn't have to do (the grey handle by the ball joint; moving handlebars; the new tyres) as you can probably guess, i have voted outstanding for this set! erdbeereis1, on aug 29 2008, 06:02 am, said: color separation is not a problem here, and since it is a small set, the piece call out is not a necessity. you do get a piece call out with this set (i did anyway). it's on the back of the small poster that is included in the set! thanks again cheers rog edited by rriggs, 02 september 2008 - 02:53 pm.

1 thanls for the review, i was looking at this set last time i went to the lego store, but in the end decided not to get it. now youve made me really doubt my decision. one question though do you think the jet ski is as good as previous ones?

1 rriggs, on sep 2 2008, 08:50 am, said: you do get a piece call out with this set (i did anyway). it's on the back of the small poster that is included in the set! i meant the piece call outs during the build that show which pieces you need for that step. and cardinal brick, i'm not quite sure what you mean, but i cetainly think that this jetski is wonderful.

1 erdbeereis1, on sep 2 2008, 09:15 pm, said: i meant the piece call outs during the build that show which pieces you need for that step. oh! cardinal brick, on sep 2 2008, 09:05 pm, said: one question though do you think the jet ski is as good as previous ones? i have to agree that the jetski is an awesome little piece of design. apart from the handle bars it has a really cool orange piece on the front (a piece i've never seen before) - the 4x3 wheelarch sort of thing... cheers rog

1 nice set, nice review, i already have one coastguard set (that truck) but i like the idea very much. however, the rigid inflatables could be much improved (see the real ones at www.rnli.co.uk or www.knrm.nl)

1 the coast guard sets are very eye catching. the color scheme is making me want to pick up the entire line, although the off-shore platform hasn't been released state-side yet. i've had my eye on this particular set for a few weeks now and is near the top of my to buy list. with instructions provided on lego.com, i build a dr. infero version of the jet ski to replace the one used in mission 2: swamp raid. it's a very sturdy design, bulky enough to make it feel like a real vehicle. great review, too. thank-you for the closer look at the set.

(i don't know the original price. i got it from bricklink with no box for $17. unfortunately, i was not able to locate the euro or pounds price.) pieces: 123 minifigs: 5 off we go! unfortunately, i don't have the box because i didn't like the idea of spending over $50 for a set with under 200 pieces. so sorry, no box pics. instructions i think the image on the front is very good. it seems less setup somehow than the instructions these days. it looks more like someone snuck up on them while they were going about their duties and snapped away rather than something that was planned. the parts a nice selection here. there is a pretty good amount of printed pieces in this set which is always nice. for example, the zebra print tile, as well as the pirate flag nowadays would almost certainly be stickered. the set also comes with a nice dark grey burp and a red boat for the pirates. the minifigs the main buying point of this set for me were the minifigs. this set comes with 5 of them which is quite good for a small set like this, especially when compared to the sets of today. the set comes with 1 alligator, 2 pirates, 2 islander warriors and king kahuka himself. i really like the islanders' torso and leg prints. the leafy skirts are a nice touch and the make-up on the faces is superb. some parts i liked these shields have a nice design on them and i always like the treasure chests. a picture inside the manual this is a feature that i liked in the manual, it shows an overhead view of the baseplate so it's much easier to find where to put the piece. i certainly could have used this feature in last year's aquabase invasion set. a close-up of the king the face print is nice. i wonder who kahuka's make-up artist is.... the finished set! first, the pirates' boat the boat is really nice. the sail is made out of a nice cloth, and connects simply to the mast. and now, the main part of the set, the throne! this is a really nice model. i think the colors and the design make it really feel like a different part of the lego world. the rock sculpture looks fantastic as well. the throne, which is sort of a stretcher thing attaches here. it connects on a 1x2 tile with a stud in the middle for easy removal here is the treasure that the pirates seek the treasure rests on tiles inside of the rock. the zebra print tribal drum this is simple but nice. one thing that's great about this which i mentioned earlier, is that this and all of the other pieces with designs on them are printed. that's right, no stickers to be found here! i have used these zebra-print tiles many times for mocs, as they make a great exotic detail piece. the lovely rock head i think this is wonderful. it really adds a lot to the set. it is well built with grey slopes, curved pieces for the mouth and nose, headlight bricks for the eyes and feathers and horns for detail. the backside the complete set! overall, this looks great in my opinion with great landscaping and some fun parts. well, it looks like the pirates walked all over the islanders and stole their treasure... in fact, it looks like it was pretty brutal. brickshelf folder now, for the the ratings! price: 8/10 (for $17 not a great price per piece value. but when you add 5 figs in, it makes it a decent price. plus this set hasn't been in stores for 14 years so that adds some cost) parts: 9/10 (the set has some really nice printed parts, as well as a baseplate, which in my opinion, is great) design: 9/10: (no flaws that i can think of right away. the rock face is very well built) playability: 8/10 (not really anything to play with, although you can sail the ship and steal the treasure) build: 9/10 (rock face uses nice techniques and the rest of the set is simple but looks good) minifigs: 10/10 (the minifigs are just fantastic. great prints, and just overall fun. overall: 53/60 bricklink entry peeron brickset it looks like the pirates have picked up a new recruit from the island... summary the older lego sets have a really different look to them than the new sets, and i think it's nice to have a mix of new and old. this is definitely a great set with a nice build and great minifigs. add to this the great printed pieces and that old pirate charm, and you get a very nice set that i can certainly recommend. thanks, and happy building! edited by erdbeereis, 17 august 2009 - 02:39 am.

0 erdbeereis1, i've had a quick look your review and i must say it's quite superb! i'm dead tired so i'm going to take a nap but i'll be back later to read it more thoroughly.

0 i feel the same way about the islanders sets brickster. they are a nice change from the regular pirate versus soldiers that is the norm. i think it would be interesting to see some new islanders sets released in the new pirate line to see how tlc would make them.

1 great review, well done for sure!! i love these reviews of old set, and this one is especially unique. i must agree with you the color scheme is magnificent. makes me want to go to ebay and buy it now! to bad for spongebob though, he got in with a real bad crowd...

1 excellent review! i want this set now!

-1 thanks for the great review. this set is pretty standard as islanders go, but it is such a cool subtheme that i don't care a bit. i totally agree with your comment about old and new sets. i don't think i would enjoy lego as much if i didn't have a decent amount of kits from pre 1999.

0 another very nice review, and im glad to see it has some nice pieces as well as characters too. looks to me that no one on bl has it in australia for sale so i may pass on this beauty. though i did pick up king kahuka recently. he makes an appearance in my medium entry

1 an outstanding set because who doesn't love islanders. outstanding review as well.

1 an outstanding set, too bad that i couldn't get this set set when it came out ...

1 very solid set. 5 minifigs and plenty of weapons to go around, adding up to great playability, what more could you want? (aspecially from a set this size) only i would have liked another cutlass, a musket (instead of 1 of the pistols) and for 1 of the pirates to have another head, but those things are no big deal, it is still a lot better than sets nowadays. edited by fluyt, 23 december 2008 - 09:50 pm.

0 those indians look useful for indiana jones in the future {as long as the have the new skin color} i wish i could have picked one of those up when i could.

1 well, for some weird reason i missed this before, so i tell you now: very good review (as we are used of you, erdbeereis1). i like all the islander sets, and own quite a few myself! for people that don't own any of the islander sets yet, the 6262 king kahuka's throne is a great way to start! lots of minifigs and accessories!

-1 i agree, the pure white legs are odd, as is the inclusion of shocks instead of pilots or regulars. or maybe even kashykk troopers; that might have been better.

0 stauder, on aug 29 2008, 02:45 pm, said: has anyone noticed the boxart includes the 3rd leg both in the lowerd position as well as the raised one? stauder. it's not the 3rd leg, it's the other main leg. zoom in and take a closer look.

-1 i like this set, but i don't like the pure white legs for the shock troopers. it looked better with the black leg joint piece. i also think the set looks like half an at-te.

0 did anyone encounter the problem with the main turret? apparently, the very tip of the piece (cone shape) can't be put onto the "pole" piece. i check the instructions 2 times and still can't find what i'm doing wrong. is it just me or did anyone else got this problem as well?

-1 i could have gotten this set if i wanted to but it seemed like a waste of money to me. i don't like the shock troopers helmets that much. i feel they should have printed visors instead of cut out ones like they have in my opinion it would make it look a lot better. the at ap itself sounds like it has a lot of holes in its cockpit which drags the set down and make it seem like they haven't exactly put a lot of effort into it. great review!

1 wow talk about a bumper! nice review baby! this set is quite nice, i would have goten it if i had had the money but didn't back then so didn't get it. it has a nice parts selection! why did lego do the shock troopers with white hips? and the bp ones have black hips. confusers me. commanderfox

1 product: 7681 separatist spider droid (ssd) theme: star wars: the clone wars no of pieces: 206 release date: 26 july 2008 rrp: sgd59.90/usd29.90 availability: lego shop@home, target, toys 'r' us (worldwide). quote conquer the galaxy, one planet at a time! unleash the power of the separatist spider droid! this towering engine of mechanical destruction from the clone wars strides across hostile terrain on four independently positionable stilt legs, then uses its movable laser cannons to blast republic forces. includes commander fox, clone trooper, battle droid, super battle droid and battle droid commander minifigures! rotate the laser cannon on top! laser cannon underneath bends to change direction! measures 6" (15cm) tall and 10" (27cm) wide! also known as the homing spider droid, this is what i would usually reckon as a mini-fig set if not for the high price point. since there's a total of 5 mini-figs to be had, and at least 3 of them are going to be high sought after.(commander fox, clone trooper, battle droid commander). at first glance, it looked like there's only 3 packets. actually, it's a total of 4 packets, 1 of the packet is inside the biggest packet. it's not a very complex build. took me around 25min since i was playing around with the mini-figs more than i was building up the spider droid. though finally, here's the completed build-up. usually for lego products, what excites me are the vehicles, yet this set is the other way round. yes, the mini-figs are definitely the crowd-pleaser this time. on with the review. here's the close-ups of the droids in the following order, battle droid commander, battle droid, & super battle droid. there's not much to comment on the droids, except that the battle droids come with the new arm that's able to hold the blaster properly upright. the sbd is the same dude that can be found easily in the previous droid battlepack. and now the good part... clone troopers. and that's commander fox, and his trooper. i was quite mystified by the amount of accessories given to the clone troopers as per the instruction booklet, as there wasn't any indication of what they were... (commlink, grenades, sensor scope, range finder?!?) then it hit me... real hard. notice anything yet? yup, it's a night scope, and a range finder. that, plus the visor that's available to fox too. now, this is really a good time to start troop building for the clone wars. :twisted: here's the weaponary. of course, let not forget the main dude... fore: port: aft: starboard: the ssd looks very similar to the actual screenshots from aotc, though am still wondering what's that little translucent red piece for... a re-enactment. and a comparison. this set is really either a miss or a hit. for me, it's a hit, due to the mini-fig count, and the wide array of accessories. it's going to probably be a hit depending on the movie that's coming out this month, since we have commander fox here(i heard that c.fox hasbro figure is a target exclusive, meaning it's gonna be another highly sought after). this set is also stated to be a limited edition, and seeing as how it's only available so far in only 1 toys r us in sg, this just might not be available anymore after the movie starts. :d comments: this review was done immediately after the launch of the clone wars toys at the midnight launch on 26 july on a local starwars fan forum. and after having caught the movie only yesterday, i now only have this to say, "it's not part of the movie!?!". oh well, cmdr. fox probably will fair better once the tv series starts proper. then again, that less-than-one-minute cameo of him, i do find it unforgivable. this being the 2nd review available, i sincerely hope you guys enjoy it.

1 i did enjoy it thanks for sharing your thoughts in this set and reviewing it. i'll add it to the index. maybe you should consider joining the reviewers academy and rule the galaxy (or something )

0 doctor sinister, on aug 30 2008, 08:22 pm, said: i assumed it was the droid's eye. great review btw. now i know what all the little bits are! i have this set as well, i quite like the droid. dr. s. dr. s. yup, only notice it after re-watching aotc. it's the sensor for visual data. tlc gave the better effect than hasbro, since they made it glow like in the movie. kimt, not at the moment, since i have slowed down quite abit due to my day job. though, i still definitely enjoy the company here to contribute more reviews when available(meaning after i find a better way to co-exist both my hasbro and lego stuff spending). millacol88, yup, those accessories definitely makes me want to start lego clone troop building.

1 valentin, nice review! i was thinking of doing this review, and realised there were 3 reviews being done for this lovely set. i must admit this is an amazing set, after buying it in tru for sgd$49.90 (15% discount). i like the comparison of both spider droid even though one is not lego. thanks for doing this lovely review. it's enjoyable to read.

1 thanks. keke, imagine the horror that gripe my heart to see the discounted price on the sg's toys 'r' us flyer about a month after its release into retail. anyway, looking forward to your other reviews too.

-1 there's plenty of reviews in the review index. (pinned topic)

0 alakazam! the good wizard is the wisest minifig in all of legoland. he is a master of the wand and can see the future. with these abilities, he helps the knights predict where the trolls will strike next. because this set is not in stores in the u.s., i was luckily able to buy this set on my vacation to germany. it is interesting that it is a euro exclusive. 5614 the good wizard set info set name: 5614 the good wizard theme: castle released: 2008 price: eur 2.95-gbp 1.99 pieces: 16 minifigs: 1 the review unfortunately i don't have the box, because in got smushed in my suitcase on the plane, so needless to say, it was not in top condition... the manual the manual is an extremely small fold-out. but the image on the front is nice. on the back of the manual, there is a picture of some of the 2008 impulse sets. this is a nice feature. the parts for an impulse set this has a pretty good selection. a very nice owl, and an interesting clear ball piece. all built this set took me forever to build. i had to take numerous breaks as it was the toughest, longest build i have ever faced! for an impulse set, this actually looks pretty good. the owl perch is nice, also the crystal ball table. the wizard is a very nice fig, with great printing on the legs and hat, and i love his beard. brickshelf gallery the ratings price: 8/10 (not bad, but i feel that impulse sets are slightly overpriced) parts: 7/10 (impulse sets are focused around the minifig, but the parts in this set are pretty good) design: 7/10 (the crystal ball is a good idea, and the owl perch is simple but nice) playability: 6/10 (there is not much to play with here) build: 8/10 (as i said before, it took forever. really it took all of 1 minute) minifig: 10/10 (the wizard is fantastic) overall: 46/60 bricklink lego s@h brickset abracadabra, blades of four... you are now a dinosaur! summary for an impulse set, this is very nice. the wizard is an excellent fig, and getting an animal in a cheap set is always great. i would definitely recommend this set. thanks, and happy building!

0 good review for a simple set. while it does come with the basics for an impulse set, i just feel that it lacks something though i am not sure what. perhaps a printed magic scroll? i am still not a fan of the printed cap (especially the stars), but i do like the printed pants displaying his various goodies hanging from his belt. the plain torso is to be expected from a wizard minifig i suppose. overall, it's not a bad set but it certainly feels to be lacking something, imo.

0 kudos on a well presented and written review. i think the reason this set didn't release in us was because it didn't have any warnings about choking anywhere on the box, therefore no lawsuits in us for lego. cheers isc

-1 worst set of the year? worst set of all time? the pictures say it all, no ratings necessary. a waste of paper for box and instructions, and waste of plastic for bag and jelly alien. the little alien ship that comes with the switch fighter beats this one hands down, as well as any other lego spaceship i have ever seen and i have seen many. thankfully this set isn't available in my country, which is something i never thought i would say. anyway, i hope tlg makes these awful jelly aliens disappear forever after this year.

-1 thanks for this review. as for the set? well, i am not to crazy about this set, but i want some sort of small alien fleet vehicals, and this would work well. but i would rather ave my money to buy classic town. edited by ~vbbn~, 01 september 2008 - 02:48 am.

-1 i already don't liked the aliens, but if the fighter was better i would already bought him. now i will maybe buy one of it just for the 2 limegreen pieces.

1 sets we miss include minfig sets like this one?? theme: space set name: space mini-figs set number: 6703 number of pieces: 30 figures: 6 released: 1988 list price: ? (unknown) 6703 peeron.com 6703 bricklink catalog lets begin by admiring the outside of the box. wow 6 figs and all equipped, i was four more of these. we don?t get instructions so the back show how to put the figs together. now for the men themselves. the complete line up, of all six figs, it seems strange half are in black. a closer look at our four futrons. a look at the blacktrons looking like nice guys with their visors raised. time for a closer look at the range of tool these good men received from the lego company. yep one accessory per person. the question is what could you do with this set, i mean it?s just spacemen in a line? do you see the man who mugged you ma?am?. a good set from an age when we could look forward to every few years a new set of minfigs and just a box of them the rating system figures: 10/10 (an excellent selection for the time) parts 4/10 (good accessories but nothing else.) fun fun fun 7/10 (i can see lots of opportunity for fun with this set..) design 8/10 (well it?s not really designed much but it?s a great idea.) price ?/10 (unknown at this time though mine was from woolworths!) grand total 29/40 (a good mark for a great set.) conclusion. until the castle battle packs came out this year we?ve been suffering from a lack of minfig based sets, and from this review i think you can see why. for many of us and i include myself here lego minifig are one of the best parts of the hobby and sets like these allowed you to build up a much larger number of figs. lego did well with this set a nice range of figure and also a good selection of accessor

1 cardinal brick, on aug 30 2008, 06:23 pm, said: the question is what could you do with this set, i mean its just spacemen in a line? what could you do? the possibilities are endless!! 1. you can stand them in a line 2. stand them in a circle 3. stand them in a square 4. sit them all down 5. sit some of them down and leave some standing up (adult supervision may be necessary for tfols attempting this one) 6. take them all apart and scatter the pieces like some kind of huge space mine has gone off 7. yeah, ok. that's probably enough for now seriously, i love all the sets of minifigs from all the different themes and this is a great one. i always wanted them when i was a kid but never did. my focus always was on town sets (petrol stations and police sets please stand up) and there was never enough pocket money left over for space. sigh! you are so lucky to have this great set! thanks for sharing cheers rog

1 thanks for the review! the latter space mini-fig sets were great as they gave a nice variety of men. i'd love this one...

1 fantastic review! this is one of the classic minifigs pack which is so great for gathering massive number of minifigs. i miss those days where they sell 5 minifigs together in a set. thanks for this lovely review.

1 nice set, lucky you! the only reason i buy the mm impulse sets is lack of good space minifig packs like this nowadays ...

1 7670: hailfire tank and spider droid number of pieces: 249 number of minifigs: 4 price: 19.99 usd/ 25.99 eur/ 19.99 gbp brickset hello everyone, today i will review the extremely underrated hailfire tank and spider droid set. i hope this review does it justice. so, let's start with the box: note: this picture is not mine. standard box for star wars in that time. the background on the box looks like it's from geonosis, indicating that this set is from episode ii, and not iii or the clone wars. the back of the box (not shown) shows the playability functions and some other sets that were released at the same time as this. overview here is an overview of the whole set. it comes with one construction manual and no sticker sheets ( ). this is a very simple set, but with not much to it, it is still a very important part of the cis army, especially if you are interested in army building. i like to call this set a "super battle pack", and you'll find out why soon. let's get right to it, and look at the feature of the set: the hailfire tank. front a front view of the very cool tank. here you can see two triangular shields on the hull. the main body is very simple, but altogether very effective and clever, and making it really look like a hailfire tank, although a little bit sized down from it's movie version. the trans-red stud used as the "eye" makes the tank look more menacing. side the side view. the wheels are very easy to make, but it's a real pain to connect all of those chain links together. i don't see what you could use the links for, except for another tank, but maybe someone creative will find something for these. the dark tan is nice though. the wheels are held on by technic poles, and the tank rolls on the wheels fairly well on carpet or a hard surface. back this is the back of the tank. here you can see eight flick-fire missiles (four on each side) of the new type, so they don't easily fall out. also note the modified 2x2 with extended hole piece sticking out of the back. this may be used to easily push around the tank. i just wish you could fit a droid in the body for the cockpit... now we move on to the spider droid, or what i like to call "the dwarf spider": the front. this one is also simple, but very cleverly built. the main body is two semi-spheres connected together for rotation, and an antenna, a cannon, four legs, and eyes made out of a useful telephone piece. the picture speaks for itself as far as how the gun and eyes are built. side a side view. you can now see the legs better, which are more sturdy then you would think. each one is made out of two pearl bronze exo-force robot arms, a useful bley handgun piece, and a dark bley battle droid body, all connected to the under body (a big knob-like piece). back the back. not much to say here. i like this spider droid because it is very sturdy, and the legs are easy to adjust. finally, we look at the minifigs: there are four minifigs in this set, which is quite generous for a set of this size. it comes with a yellow battle droid commander (i really like this one), two battle droids, and a super battle droid. all three battle droids have the new blaster pistols and one twisted arm. that's about it for the review, so here is the final verdict: build: 8/10, very fun and easy, besides the chain links. should take the seasoned builder less than 20 minutes. playability: 7/10, the flick-fire missiles are fun, as well as just zooming around the tank. could use some clones for a battle. swooshability: 8/10, you can roll around the hailfire fairly well. minifigs: 9/10, a generous amount of figs, and all are pretty good. design: 9.5/10, a really simple and clever set, although a little too small for the movie version. price: 10/10, a very fair price considering the price-per-parts ratio and the coolness of the set. overall score: 8.5/10, a very neat set to have, a great army builder, and great for display next to all of the other cis sets. the price is fair, the figs are good, and the build is very clever. that's all for now, folks. please feel free to give some feedback! edited by jimbutcher, 15 september 2008 - 03:08 am.

-1 thanks for sharing this review with us. i think this one of the sets. in europe this thing is waaaay overpriced and thus makes it a crappy set. we pay nearly double the us price. so i rated it poor. also because the figs included does not make it great. the hailfire is well designed and looks great, but that's just about all there is worthy of a positive mentioning. sorry. [on a side note: as a bronze-awarded student, where's the price in eur and gbp? and where's the poll?] [nevermind the poll, i've added that one for you ]

1 thanks for the review, jimbutcher. i really like that set. it combines interesting and good design with some awesome cool parts and a neat amount of charm.

1 great review. i agree that this set is underrated. the hailfire is supposed to be a little taller than two battle droids, so scale-wise it's nice. the dwarf spider droid is amazing in my opinion. i just wish it wasn't brown, it makes me feel like it's on geonosis. we never saw a grey varient of the hailfire, so it's fine with me that it's brown.

1 this is a great set, i have 2 of them now, and i plan to get more. it is much better than the droid battle pack. for 10 bucks more, you get better battle droid arms and some canon "vehicles", good enough for me.

-1 thanks for the review. is a great one. this set is not really a good set but i like the spider droid. the hailfire droid scale is not right, i think it is suppose to be even bigger. anyway, this is the first set that re-release the commander droid. so i grab it.

0 this is a must have set for aotc fans and i really love the hailfire droid but it costs like $80 or more now that its discontinued.

1 7681: homing spider droid (limited edition) number of pieces: 206 number of minifigs: 5 price: 34.99 usd/ 29.99 eur/ 19.99 gbp theme: star wars: episode ii year released: 2008 brickset folder bricklink catalog welcome to my sixth review on these boards, of the mighty homing spider droid. at first glance, this ball on legs may not seem like much, but hopefully this review will change your mind. the box. this box is the standard for all of the new clone wars sets: sleek, shiny, and a right-out-of-the-factory look. the blue-and-white color scheme is fantastic, and portrays that the sets are based off of a cartoon well. this box has a "limited edition" (in spanish, too! ) seal slapped on the front, although you won't have trouble finding this in your local toys "r" us, because of the big clone wars display in the front of the store that you can't miss. overview in this picture, you can see the contents of the whole set (minus the instruction booklet) built. you can spot five minifigures (which i'll get to later), and a very tall cis weapon, known as the homing spider droid. this weapon of destruction is a must-have for your cis army, although the color scheme (mostly dark bley and light bley) is a change up from the regular colors (brown or blue) of the cis. this may have something to do with the blended armies of the trade federation and corporate alliance, but i don't know for sure. the instruction manual is very thin, only about twenty pages. homing spider droid this is the main part of the set. four huge legs, two mounted guns, and a red sensor eye are the highlights of this artillery unit. there's not many playability factors to this one, but sometimes its just fun to squash the little clones, a change-up of the contrary. it also looks good next to all of the other cis sets, but you might want to clear some room in your display area; the legs take up a lot of room! this thing is also massively tall, about the same height as the republic cruiser. main body this is the main body of the spider, which has no cockpit and is remote controlled. this spherical body (not in that sort of way...) is a very quick build, and features a big, red eye connected by a red stud and hinge. top gun here is the top gun (not with tom cruise), which is connected to the body using a clever technic system (pun not intended). as you can see from this picture, you can see that it can rotate a full 360 degrees, but only if you remove the eye. also, the gun can be pulled back, and if you let go, it will snap back, like the a gun does when fired, due to the force of the shot. i'm not sure this was intended by tlg, because it wasn't showed anywhere on the box or in the manual. lower gun here is the gun attached to the under body of the main part. it is attached using a hinge, which allows it to move up and down. i also like the cord (that presumably transfers power) included on both guns. hips here is one of the hips attaching the legs to the body. there is one on each side, with two legs each. the are attached to the body and legs with technic pieces. legs you can see the tall legs in this pic. they are basically just technic poles and connectors. feet this is one of the feet, the essential to balancing the whole vehicle. these and the legs are repetitive, so i suggest doing them all at the same time to avoid flipping back in the manual and repeating the process three more times. the picture speaks for itself for the design of the feet. all are connected to the legs using a double-holed technic piece. one massive son of a gun this thing is so tall! it frightens the skin off of even the toughest, most experienced soldiers. run for your lives!! look at how much havoc and fear it causes! family photo enough of the battle scenes, here is a shot of this spider with it's smaller cousin: the dwarf spider droid. minifigs finally, here are the minifigs that come with this set. there are five in all, which include: battle droid: nothing special, but still an addition to your army commander battle droid: i love that yellow torso! super battle droid: again, nothing special clone trooper: i'm glad they gave us one in this set, i can add it to to my other phase 1 clones. commander fox: i love it! everything from the dark red markings to the accessories are fantastic! the head is just the regular anime style clone wars face. this set comes with two flashlights, two antennae, one visor, one pauldron, and one kama. close-up of fox here is a close-up of fox, so you can see the detailed insignia of the republic guard. that wraps it up for the review, here is the final verdict: build: 8/10, very easy and straightforward, a little repetitive with the legs. should take the seosoned builder around 20 minutes. playability: 6/10, not many play factors, but it's fun to just squash puny clones with this giant arachnid. swooshability: n/a minifigs: 10/10, you really can't ask for more in this sort of set! design: 8/10, not very sturdy, but it is altogether clever. price: 5/10, yes, it is limited edition, but pumping up the price fifteen dollars more than it should be is a little ridiculous. overall score: 8.5/10, an excellent set for display, although not very sturdy. minifigs are superb, but the price could be better. in the end, i would highly recommend this to any prequel trilogy fan looking to build up his/ her army. well, that's about it for this review, please feel free to leave your opinions!

-1 i just bought this set the other day and i must admit that it gets a "below average" from me. the price is not corresponding with what you get. which would be implied, had jim added the eur or gbp price in the info[hint hint ] the spider droid is flimsy at best. making it stand or even move without tumbling over is hard. also why the brown cylinders on the legs? keep the colourscheme clean, please. the figs are fine, except that i dislike the clone headgear and the fact that the helmets now have holes in the sides, allowing the flesh head to show within = goofy looking. i am soo replacing the clone heads with black ones. great review of an acceptable set

1 thank you for that good review, jimbutcher. i think that this is really a pretty interesting and original looking set. maybe its not very stable, but it owns some special 'war of the worlds' charm for sure...

1 thanks for the great review jimbutcher! this looks like a pretty decent set, i might get this if i find it on discount.

0 mass-manufactured and designed to withstand extreme amounts of punishment... it's an iron drone, and it's marching on its sentry! set data 7711: sentry year: 2006 theme: exo-force subtheme: robots pieces: 74 (+4 extra) <- both counting hinge control stick and its base as two separate pieces price: euro 7 circa, misb, including s/h, on ebay; rrp was euro 5 circa / 5 usd. probably 5 ukp. building time: 20/25 minutes (10 minutes building, the rest of the time placing stickers!) more info: brickset - peeron being 2006 my last dark year, i wasn't a big exoforce fan but they were ok. i tought 2007 models were better, and still think 2008 models are the best. that basically means 1) it's a shame that there will be no more of this line and 2) this is my first 2006 model, yet i bought in in july 2008. ok, let's do this one. box front: box was battered due to italian post; they'll do their best to give lego boxes a "war" outlook. close-up: the japanese katakana read "tokushu butai" -> special (military) force(s) box back: amazing alternate model; some like it more than the original design. box content: a small but capable sticker sheet, two bags and instructions. sticker sheet: and they're numbered! random instructions page: connecting legs to the body instructions page - sticker detail: that's why they're numbered. instructions page - parts inventory: does anybody check if they're all there before building? surely not me. loose pieces: nothing rare, i think; small techinc parts come in different colours, as usual (you often don't see them when the model is complete, but sometimes you do) the iron drone: "strong and durable" (and much better looking than those crappy mm jelly aliens) building starts. the open cockpit - front and rear view left leg - front and rear view; right leg is built of the same pieces. left arm - with laser cannon the cannon - great use of the hollow studs with the "plant tree palm top" right arm - with twin missiles complete model - front view complete model - side view and rear view rating and review. parts and building: nothing new, but both models are o.k. instead of waiting the last page of the manual, you'd better put the stickers in place while building. looking at the box you'd tell stickers background is (trans) purple. it actually is trans clear (excpet for the yellow and black stripes - warning: hazard!). try not to put your fingerprints on the sticky side! consider using tweezers. posability: both legs and both arms feature three joints; and that's good, so that the weight doesn't have the sentry falling down. final model: smaller compared to 2007 claw crusher and 2008 batlle arachnoid, but cheaper and surely worth the money. the "minifig" is just another iron drone, not much to say. final rating: 3,5/5 edited by sinner, 01 september 2008 - 02:22 am.

0 thanks for the review. i really do like the first year of ef. nowadays they mecha are perhaps more cleverly designed, and use ball joints for playability. but i really love the blocky bulky look of the first drone's machines. and somehow the older ones seem a better value of parts. i'm more inclined to buy duplicates of them than the newer models.

0 this is polar-1, over... it's day 5 at arctic research base 76. we are experiencing radio difficulties since discovering a number of strange radioactive arctic life forms which seem to be effecting our signal, over. we have encountered a large polar bear which by all account appears to be friendly and playful. our food supply; however, has diminished quickly, and we have to venture north from the base to a frozen lake in search of fish. our cordinates are currently 4645?4?n, 74121?7?w. we do plan to take the snowmobile to the lake after we get our provisions in order. this is polar-1, out. polar explorer bonus pack set #: 6569 theme: arctic year released: 2000 piece count: 76 minifigs: 2 list price: $10 (usd) in 2000, lego introduced a new theme called arctic. it was something completely new and different for lego as no mini-fig scale sets and/or adventurers had ever ventured to the arctic. the set offered new orange pieces and combined elements of blue and white pieces to provide a number of sleds, vehicles, a mobile outpost (6520), and even a large polar base (6575). the theme was unfortunately short lived and did not see 2001. this particular set is a "value pack" that combines sets 6578 (polar explorer) and 6586 (polar scout) at a reasonable price of $10 (usd). i may have even paid a few dollars less at a discount toy store back in the early 2000s. a picture of the "bonus pack" with the two sets combined within the box: the backside features an advertisement for the lego club and pictures of other arctic sets: starting with the smaller set, the polar explorer (just a tip of the iceberg ): instructions front of box back of box both sets include the same minifig, an arctic fig with glasses and a thick arctic coat: here's a shot of the fig with his hood on. i always thought the hood is a nice piece that would work well for hoth rebel snow scenes. the set includes a few nice accessories: the set actually creates a small ice/snow formation that can even be placed on water to represent an iceberg: here's a close-up with the blue ice spider: the complete set: next, the polar scout: front of box back of box the polar scout instructions picture the same image as the box: but i really like the real arctic imagery on the backside: the set includes a small sheet of decals: included are some great arctic accessories: and some interesting arctic creatures, like this neon orange scorpion in a ball of ice: i love the polar bear, a great addition to snow scenes: but the best part of this set is the orange and black sled: the back sled attachment (u-haul) has some tools and a removable storage cover: the top comes off easy to store tools and equipment: here's the arctic fig with a great metal detector (or other snow research device): and the sled itself: lastly, a picture of the complete polar scout: final thoughts: i'm a little disappointed that arctic was a short-lived theme. at the time, i wasn't too interested in the arctic, but i still regret not buying the large polar research base after seeing it at a discounted price. i was able to pick up this set and the mobile outpost that i never opened. i'd be interesting in reading your thoughts in regard to this set and the arctic theme.

1 i like the theme very much, but sadly, i don't own any sets of it. it brings such a great feeling, it's fresh and has great parts and sets. and it brought the polar bear! your review is very good and informative, thanks! (i voted wrong, i meant above average, but i clicked below average )

1 thank you for that fine review, thebrickster! i really like how this two small sets create an intense and adventurous atmosphere against the backdrop of a pretty exotic region. the setsre well designed and very nice with a fine amount of rather unique and well fitting gear. the whole theme offers a lot of playability in a set-up thats a little different to tlcs standard sceneries for sure. and... it always reminded me of 'who goes there?', too...

1 hi! great review on one of my favourite themes! i never realized how cool it was until just now, when you did your review. anyways, i remember my one set of the arctict expedition, the arctic expedition pack

-1 a nice set review. as for the theme itself, i though it was a very interesting theme. sadly i dont think lego put enough effort into it, i was personally upset not to se a second year even if i didnt buy any of the sets. it reminds me of the artic theme playmobil did at one point in the distant past to be honest. i think a number of good artic scenes were missed, when it came out a really wanted to get a ski plane but it never came, i built it myself in the end but i dont know how lego missed that one. on a slightly random note i do know that at least one lego minifig did make it all the way to the real artic with a research team, sadly i dont have any pictures to offer you.

0 i find it amusing that the numbers on the decal (for the flag) were chosen so that it wouldn't look stupid if you put it on upside-down by accident.

0 4645?4?n, 74121?7?w??? those are some wierd coordinates.

1 nice review brickster! the arctic theme is very nice. the minifigs have a great look to them especially with the hoods. the colors for the arctic sets i have always liked, and somehow the idea of minifigs exploring the arctic is fun to me.

1 thanks very much for this great review thebrickster! i love the arctic sub-theme, but unfortunately i never got my hands on any of the sets, since this theme had its time during my dark ages. this one is a really neat little set with a great amount of accesoires, especially these snow shoes and the backpack which i love

1 great review, i hope tlc does another. i rember reading a book once based on the theme which stated the scorpions and thespiders and such were aliens .

1 it's amazing! it's stupendous! it's almost like whitefang is a reviewer with previous experience! it's almost like i wrote all of shadow's lines! it's almost like staudie is being as annoying as ever. oh wait, that's all true! great review of a neat little set. i used mine as the air conditioning unit on the roof of my chinese restaurant. then some dork told me it didn't look believable or something. i liked it. um... so. great review! thanks for presenting it! i give you a and, let's just take a moment to get sentimental. a year ago, today, staudie had a lame idea: interview the members of eb. he flailed around with it for a few interviews, including the infamous one where hinck attention whored sinner into a corner and sinner were featured, reprising their roles from the whacker and the walrus. it was quite memorable, but then, a short time later, someone new joined the team, bringing it to a new level of polish and bad jokes. still, this tribute isn't dedicated to that genius of the written word, nay, it's dedicated to the whole staff, including the new guy who is still a secret so don't bother asking, i'm not telling! ha! i salute you, eb news, it's been a damn fine year! i hope i can survive another.

1 great review, whitefang and co.! a thoroughly enjoyable one, i'm glad we have a series of reviews that you can expect to be packed with humour and craziness. looking forward to the next! ~peace

1 i chose above average. it has a great minifigure.... i wish i had it....someday i will!

0 you already know how i feel about the review. as for the set, i'm not entirely sure. it's a fine witch, but you've already gotten her in the witch's windship and a few other sets. i vote average on this. a good minifig (though one does not have the need for more than one witch) and some fine additional parts.

0 this is a very good review, no doubt about it. about this set, this is a cheap way to buy this set with a witch and some nifty accessories such as the black cat. in fact, i think this is the first time i had ever seen a black cat. it's simple, but not very useful in my collection. because other fright knight sets also offer the witches too. i don't need many witches. overall, i feel that this is an average set.

1 yay, another fright knights review! odd comic at the end. skipper 24, on sep 1 2008, 07:05 pm, said: ever wanted to turn into a animal, wanted to curse your enemy or just wanted to be rich beyond your wildest dreams. you should go visit the witch and her fireplace. she can brew you up a potion for any occasion or purpose. so head down to see the witch right now. sounds like a song or nursery rhyme, somehow. anyway, to the review, it is a great review, such a small set but you've summed it up well. this is one of the few unpromo fright knight sets i didn't get, sadly. not 'sadly' because of willa the witch, i have about four of her, but the special cat, and the other bits (one can never have too many lego bats). i voted the set outstanding, i think it is for its size. kimt, on sep 1 2008, 08:16 pm, said: you already know how i feel about the review. good or bad feelings? edited by shoc, 02 september 2008 - 11:45 am.

1 thanks for the cool review! as for the set: a witch, a bat and a black cat!!! that's more than enough for such a small set!

0 thanks for the review skipper. i've added it to the review index

0 i voted "average" think the minifig and black cat are great.

1 huzzah! the king has declared a royal tournament pitting the brave knight in his shining armour, against the feared skeleton warrior and his shadow horse. the jousting arena is set up so let the joust begin! 7009 the final joust set info set name: 7009 the final joust theme: castle released: 2007 price: usd 7.99-gbp 5.99-eur 7.95 pieces-62 minifigs: 2 figs 2 horses price per piece: about 13 cents let the games begin! box shots the front has an image of the knight and skeleton jousting with lightning in the background. the back show the two now fighting with an ax and ball and chain. i don't really like the box image, as i think the background looks too dark. manual the front has the same picture as on the box. on the back some of the other 2007 castle sets are displayed. this is better than the usual sweepstakes image that we get. the pieces nothing really special here. but you at least get a good assortment of weapons. shields i always like lego shields and these are no exception. the patterns are great. minifigs first the horses. these are great, the knight's horse's coverings are really nice. now, the minifigs. the knight and skeleton both have nice armor. the torsos are plain black for the skeleton and bley for the knight. the finished product in the middle is the jousting barrier which is simple, but serves its purpose. on the left we have the weapon rack which is good. it would have been nice if tlg had included a rack for the skeleton as well though. extra parts only two extra white parts here. you can use them if your knight's horse wants to retire and look like a normal horse again. oh! that has to hurt! it seems that the skellie has won this round! poor knight... brickshelf folder now, for the ratings! price: 7/10 (not a very good price per piece ratio, however at least 2 figs and 2 horses are included) parts: 7/10 (the shields and log bricks are nice, but most of the others are nothing spectacular) design: 8/10 (relatively well designed, but a bit boring) playability: 8/10 (you can joust with it and that's about all) build: 8/10 (short and easy) overall: 38/50 brickset lego s@h peeron bricklink strike! it seems that the horses have rebelled against their riders... summary this set although not amazing, is still a very solid set. the minifigs are great and so are the horses, but the rest of the set kind of feels like an afterthought. even with its negative aspects i still recommend it, especially if you are a castle fan. thanks, and happy building! p.s. if you want to see how i made this set a bit more fun, check out this click

1 6205: v-wing fighter number of pieces: 118 number of minifigs: 1 price: 9.99 usd/ 13.99 eur/ 8.99 gbp theme: star wars/ episode iii year released: 2006 brickset folder bricklink catalog welcome to this review of the v-wing fighter. this will be my eighth review on the boards. strangely enough, there was another set called the v-wing fighter that came out in 1997 for the space theme. note that i am missing several small pieces to this set, but they are mostly insignificant to the overall look. the box this is the standard box type for all 2005-2006 star wars sets. i can't say that i like it as much as the 2007 or 2008 box types, but it'll do. it features a profile view of darth vader and silver text. overview this is the whole set. this ship is meant to protect the chancellor at all costs. they are usually found in groups of three or four. front this ship is very sleek, and you'll notice that it's colors are dark red, light bley, and dark bley with a touch of black. it starts at the nose very narrow, but as the body progresses to the back, it gets wider, like a "v" (hence the name). back here is a view of the rear. note the trans-neon green discs used to represent the boosters. also notice the dark red r4 astro droid and the hinges used as aromor. flight all four wings (two on each side) can open up for flight/ attack mode. they can open even farther then the pic shows, but it's not an intended function. the wings a great, but it's a real pain to position them correctly, and the bottom wings close when you set the ship down. tail fins this is what the tail fins look like on each side, with two flaps attached to the top and bottom. if you look closely, the tail fins and wings look a little bit like a mini ship themselves, maybe controlled by remote. no, this is not an intended function, either. guns, side the guns are very simple but very clever, using a double technic hole piece, two black bars, and two technic pins. also note the landing gear. minifig finally, here is the minifig: a clone pilot. it has light blue arms and legs, white hands, a helmet with black markings and republic insignia on it, and a double-sided torso. the front of the torso is great, featuring shoulder straps, armor plating, and a life support system. while this minifig is not altogether accurate to the movie, it has still been one of my favorite star wars figs. back the back of the fig that can double as the front of clone marines. this side features shoulder straps and armor plating. cockpit lastly, here is the pilot seated in the cockpit. he fits perfectly, although it is not air-tight. we wouldn't want the poor guy to suffocate, now would we? that wraps up the review, here is the final verdict: build: 8/10, a nice, easy, build, and the last of the small sw ships ($10 or less). playability: 6/10, pretty fun to swoosh around, but that's about it. could use a vulture droid, but that would take away the 'small' factor. swooshability: 10/10, very fun and easy to swoosh around endlessly, without fear of it breaking. minifigs: 9/10, there really is no need to have more, although a palpy fig would be outstanding. the pilot is a great figure though. design: 9/10, extremely accurate to the movie, but the cockpit is not airtight. price: 10/10, you couldn't ask for a better deal! overall score: 8.6, an excellent set. unfortunately, this is the last of the small sw ships currently. the fig is great, and the sleek design is accurate. that just about sums it all up, feel free to leave your comments! edited by jimbutcher, 15 september 2008 - 03:11 am.

1 this was a great set for the price. ten dollars for a cool minifigure and a decent sized ship is great.

0 yeah this was an ok set. i remember getting a few of these at tru. the boxes were smashed up and i got some 30 percent off. (still not as cheap as regular us price ) some ok bricks and a great minifig. thanks for sharing your thoughts and opinions on this set i'll rate this set as average. oh, yeah i've added the review to the index.

1 is your knight army feeling short? do your knights get consistently run over by the skeletons? if so, this is the set for you! 852271 knights battle pack set info set name: 852271 knights battle pack theme: castle released: 2008 price: usd 12.99-gbp 6.49-eur 9.95 minifigs: 5 it's army building time! packaging the figs come in a plastic box with a slide out tray. to open, you slide out a tab on the bottom, and pull the tray out. the weapons one plus of this set is the good weapon selection. you get a whopping 5 shields, a spear, a lance, acrossbow, a pointed lance thing and a lovely chrome sword minifigures now the main focus of this set, the figs! one thing that's nice here is that you get a good selection of different knights. the figs are quite nice, with different faces and helmets for almost every one. minifig backsides! i really like the archer's quiver. two sided head the archer has a scared head on the other side. brickshelf folder and now, the ratings! price: 6/10 (certainly a bit overpriced. it should have been $10. the star wars battle packs have only 1 less fig plus some parts for $5 less) parts: 8/10 (no bricks, but a nice selection of weapons) minifigs 9/10 (the figs are great) overall: 23/30 lego s@h brickset bricklink even with a bigger army, the poor knights are no match for modern technology... summary even though the pack is a bit overpriced, it is still great for increasing your army's size. i would get this set if you are a castle fan looking to expand your army, otherwise don't worry if you pass on this set. thanks, and happy building!

1 very good review! i enjoyed reading this. i want to buy these battlepacks. until now, my country has not re-stocked these battlepacks. i wonder will they ever arrived again. i want to build massive armies with this outstanding battlepack set. hope it will arrived soon.

1 great review of a neat way to bulk up your castle guards and their associated weapons and shields. i hope we continue to see sets like this in the future, they have to be a good money maker for tlg and they always please the fans. francis marion, on sep 2 2008, 10:39 am, said: they should have given him a horse ... with that lovely new barding. nobody would complain about the price then, even if it was $15.

0 the cobra, on sep 2 2008, 11:33 am, said: - why are the figures already built? are today's kids so dumb? let's go back to those old minifig packs! probably to reduce the size/complexity of the package, thus, saving tlc money. i don't see it being a big deal as customization is always an option. concerning the set: not much to say other than it does what it's suppose to do: build up one's army of knights. the variance of faces and accessories are great. i especially love the chrome sword. the price isn't bad either since the package comes with five nice figs and some great equipment. edited by dj2005, 03 september 2008 - 06:46 am.

0 i was going to get this, but when i rang up s&h, apparently they'd sold out already. price is a little on the steep side as well, and i can only see it going up on sites such as amazon as the number of people wanting them goes up, which it will it it's anything based on the star wars battle packs.

0 after reading your review i might buy me one of these. at first i thought it was quite useless, but i must admit that your review kinda changes my mind on this bp. i've added it to the index

0 how were you able to get three small shields. i only got two in mine. i am going to check the trash just in case.

0 swman, on oct 6 2008, 07:27 am, said: how were you able to get three small shields. i only got two in mine. i am going to check the trash just in case. i think it only comes with two. the extra one probably slipped in from another set. sorry for any confusion!

0 i think this battle pack is a little expensive, but the minifig ,their heads and weapons and stuff are very very nice! but because of the price, i'll rate it " average" ^^

1 i love this set. i bought one when i went to the lego store at downtown disney, and went home and bought another online. i love that it gives you a variety of weapons and figures. i like using the bowl helmet guy to man my catapults and crossbows.

1 great review! i still don't plan on getting this set. i want to get more important stuff like the new medieval market... edited by lego12, 07 october 2008 - 12:19 am.

0 it's an ok set, but it's extremely overpriced where i live. i simply couldn't justify paying $17.99 +tax for 5 minifigs. the fact that these figures are featured prominantly in other sets makes this set a difficult purchase. given the price, i find it hard to look at this set with much enthusiasm.

-1 it's way to expansive for what you get, besides you pay more for the package then its containts...

-1 i like your review on this battle pack. but i think that this battle pack was over priced. $12 for this? i am not paying that much for 5 knights.

0 dear all, i found this to be a very usefull army building set. at 2 euro per minifig it is relatively cheap in my book, so i bought 4 battle packs recently. although, it could be difficult to integrate all of them in your army. personally, i reshuffled some of the weapons as to integrate them better. but that is a personal preference ofcourse. kind regards, teddy

1 today we will be joining mr. brickop and his dog stud on the tough job of being a police officer. let's join them now! 5612 police officer set info set name: 5612 police officer theme: city released: 2008 price: usd 3.49-gbp 1.99-eur 2.95 minifigs: 2 let's begin! the box a very nice small square box with the policeman and his dog on the front. and the back which shows the officer running to the scene of the crime, walkie-talkie in hand. instruction manual the back of the manual has the 2008 police sets and impulse sets pictured. it is interesting that the good wizard is on here even though i bought this set in the u.s. on this side you see how to build the model in 8 grueling steps... the parts not much out of the ordinary here except for the lovely printed road sign. minifigs here are the 2 figs, stud and mr. brickop! they make a great team don't they? extra parts this set comes with a surprisingly large amount of extras for such a small set. all built after it's all built, you get a pretty nice set. the road sign looks nice, but it is a bit strange seeing that arm stick so far out. the little equipment rack is pretty nice. brickshelf folder the ratings price: 8/10 (decent price, but could be 50 cents cheaper) parts: 8/10 (nothing special except for the road sign which is a big plus) minifigs: 10/10 (you can't wish for more than 2 in an impulse set!) overall: 26/30 lego s@h brickset bricklink mr. brickop has finally put legoland's most notorious criminal behind bars... summary this is a great impulse set. having 2 minifigs really sets it above some of the other ones. the set make a great gift, or a good cheap present to yourself. it is great if you need to expand your police force as well. i would definitely recommend it. thanks, and happy building!

1 i really love these impulse sets at a low price point for lots of minifigs this police one doesn't appeal too much to me at the moment, but who knows, with your reference i may need it with a future project! hmm... it's actually a good way of getting those dogs cheaply

0 i also love the impulse sets, but we have already too many policemen (although i actually bought this one). our bobby isn't looking very nice is he?! we normally but policemen in a pool or sea with sharks at events like legoworld, so maybe that's because of me edited by jopiek, 02 september 2008 - 11:00 pm.

0 tanks for the review erdbeereis1 but i don't really need to buy this set since they're are always loads of police sets and it's not as if i need anymore cops, although stud makes it tempting...

1 set name: crossbow attack set number: 7090 theme: castle pieces: 54 minifigs: 3 released: 2007 price: 5.99usd, 3.99 eur, 7.99 cdn legoshop.com description: ready, aim, fire!it's a battle of brave knights against the evil skeleton rider! includes 2 knights, skeleton and a skeleton horse! rolling wagon has a launcher that really fires! bricklink inventory peeron inventory brickshelf gallery now, on to the review! the box as you can see, the front of the box illustrates the set very nicely, showing the skeleton warrior attacking and the knights firing their crossbow. the back the back of the box shows a small battle happening between a knight and a skeleton, as well as the main feature of the set, the firing crossbow (more on that later.) the instructions not much to say here, its the same as the front of the box. the back of the instructions this merely shows pictures of other sets in the castle line. random instruction page this set does not use piece callouts to tell you what parts you will need in each step. however, the set is so small you should never have trouble finding a piece. the minifigures this is the main reason i bought this set. you get two knights, one with a standard helmet, and the other one with a new mold. you also get a skeleton warrior. the horse the set comes with a skeleton horse that looks great. however, it is a single molded piece that has no articulation. close-up of the warrior riding his horse here you see the brave skeleton riding in on his...ah......er......um......noble steed! the accessories/weapons for minifigure accessories, you get an axe, a skeleton sword, and a skeleton shield. extra pieces i was left with one skeleton arm and one leg when i was finished the build. the crossbow wagon and now, to the main part of the set, the crossbow wagon. it is really just a plate with some whells attached and a lot of those cheese wedge pieces to create the track for the projectile. back view this view shows the mechanism that makes the crossbow fire. it is powered by a rubber band. you pull back on a technic piece, which creates tension in the elastic band. when you let go, the elastic pushes the piece forward, which in turn hits the projectile and makes it fire! it works fairly well, but i would have prefered it fired farther. entire set the skeleton charges at his adversaries! the knights prepare to counterattack! overall build: 10/10 the build is simple, easy and quick. set design: 7/10 the crossbow could have worked a bit better. playability: 8/10 the crossbow is fun to shoot. minifigs: 10/10 it doent get much better than this. i love that domed helmet mold! price: 8/10 the set is very affordable and worth the price. overall score:43/50 conclusion overall, this is a great set and a solid army builder. you get three minifigures for a fair price and the crossbow wagon adds some much-needed playability. i bought two of these to bolster my army and to stock up on those rare domed helmet pieces. basically, get this set! thank you for taking the time to read my review. i hope you liked it!

0 i agree that this set is worth the price considering the amount of minifigs and even a skeletal horse. it also comes with a lot of blue 1x1 slopes that are always useful and quite rare to obtain. another weapon for the soldier operating the catapult (or a shield for the other soldier) would have been great, but that is pushing it. the crossbow itself is quite nice and is better than what most $6 sets come with, imo. overall, a good set indeed. thank you for the review and the other review concerning the knight, of which i hope to buy in the near future as it looks like it comes with a great deal of goodies. the weapon rack is useful, too.

0 i like this set mostly because it has some very usable pieces, but also because of the amount of minifigures in the set, which is a whopping three and one large animal (skeleton horse). the one thing, however, that i don't like about it, is that one of the catapult operators isn't armed. in my opinion, this would have been a good time for tlg to release a suitable dagger piece (not the kitchen knife) for its castle line. great review, by the way, it captured the key elements of this fantastic small set.

0 nice review, to start off. you got all the details someone could possibly need, in my opinion at least. i do enjoy this set as well, and i've bought only one to keep my minifigs as unique as possible. despite my personal preference, i still find this a nice army builder. good amount of minifigs for the price, as mentioned earlier, with each being different from the other. though i would like the catapult manager to be armed with at least something, i still feel that he can just flee if he's ever in trouble. he's a good guy to use for the castle gimmics if you have it. one more small comment. i also love those domed helmets, even if they aren't actually new. my favorite of them all, being followed up by the racer helmet.

0 nice review . i still thing sets like this are the reason castle has done so well, it allows you to collect a large number of minfig for not very much cash, which i certainly indulged in. my only complaint is that you end up with the evil skeletons out numbered, however heard of the good guys winning with the numbers in their favour.

0 millacol88, on sep 6 2008, 01:55 am, said: i've experienced that problem too. i find my knights outnumber my skellies about 3:1. a crownie dies easyer than a skeleton. it's so hard to perforate the lungs or pierce the heart on a skeleton with a spear or crossbow bolt, isn't it? a great set with a reasonable price. thanks for sharing it with us. added to the index.

1 dark times in lego castle land... the poor knight is being held prisoner in the skeletons' prison carriage. we must help the brave knight on horseback free him at once. let's ride! 7092 skeletons' prison carriage set info set name: 7092 skeletons' prison carriage theme: castle released: 2007 price: usd 19.99-gbp 14.99-eur 19.95 pieces: 193 minifigs: 5 animals: 4 price per piece: about 10 cents review time! box shots our first pic is the front of the box, which shows a dark image of the knight attemping to free the prisoner. and here is the back, showing some features. the manual the image on the manual is the same as on the box front. random manual shot no piece call-outs, but the color distinction is not a problem. the parts 193 pieces doesn't seem like a lot, but many of them are quite large. the selection is pretty good. lots of greys and black. minifigs with this set comes a whopping 5 minifigs which is amazing for a $20 set. the knights are very nice and one has a double-sided head. the horses adding to the already large minifig count are the 4 horses. 3 skeleton horses, and 1 great brown horse for the knight. extra parts now, the finished set! first, we have the brave knight on his brown stallion. the horse's head covering looks very nice. and the knight gets a nice long pointy stick. the main event, the prison carriage! the design of this is excellent. with the bionicle piece and the white horns, it looks very spooky. the tower this part is one of my favorites. it uses white horns to give it a great creepy look. one problem is that there is barely enough room for the 2 skeletons. the driver here you can see the driver and his whip. you can also see the bionicle spine. a side view when you look from the side, you can see the great design of the prison. it is placed on tiles for easy removal and looks great with the round white 1 x 1s on the corners. horses' harness this is another very well designed portion of the set. the harness attaches easily to the horses and to the carriage. the prison look at the poor imprisoned knight. let's try to free him! the back of the prison hinges down! the knight is freed! everything together all together, the set looks fantastic. the carriage has a great creepy skeleton feel, and getting 9 minifigs is amazing. brickshelf folder ratings price: 10/10 (193 pieces and 9 figs is fantastic for $20) parts: 9/10 (lots of good large pieces) design: 10/10 (captures the spooky skeleton look very well) playability: 8/10 (it's fun to try and free the prisoner and the carriage rolls well) build: 9/10 (easy but fun) minifigs: 10/10 (the sheer amount of figs is great and they look great) overall: 56/60 the future of lego castle... summary this is an amazing set for the price. a huge amout of minifigs, combined with a great design and good playabilty makes the set a winner. i would certainly recommend this set to anyone that remotely likes lego sets. thanks, and happy building!

0 you're really rolling these reviews out, huh? i am not sure how i feel about this set. while it does include five figs, three are skeletons and are generally worth much less than say three trolls/orcs (i know they didn't exist at this point in time so this is understandable). the amount of horses is nice, but i'm not a big lego horse fan. what this set does have is a great appearance and brings atmosphere to the table. $20 is an affordable amount for those of us who do not wish to splurge too much on a toy while being enough to actually get a large enough set to create something out of. personally, i'd rate it in between average and above average. like another castle set (i can't remember which), i just feel this one also lacks something.

0 i really like this set, and it's probably my next purchase from a store (if i can still find it). there's alot of great pieces (i especially like the spiked thingy on the front), and it makes a great addition for any skeletal army. above all, i just love the spine-chilling feeling of it. if i were a minifig in a legoland, i'd be scared out of my pants-piece if i saw a carriage like that rolling towards me in a dark night.

1 one of the best sets from the new castle theme. we havent seen a carriage in a long long time. and it looks so spooky and sceary! lots of minifigs new skeleton horses (3!) this was the first set i got from the new castle theme!! outstanding!

1 i bought this set to have the scared minifig, but i found a lot of cool pieces and stuffs... i love this set ^^

1 that's a super review erdbeereis1, as usual and as we can expect from one of the academy teachers. i gave the set a 4 (above average) because i think there are quite some minifigs included for its price (which is, i think, not that expensive at all) i also like the parts that are included, like the sceleton horses and weapons, wheels,... imho this set is a great armybuilder ! btw: in belgium i have seen this set being sold for 15,99 euros.

1 i really do love this set. it has 5 figures, which is unheard of for a $20 set. it comes with plenty of weapons and accessories and has a great design. the detail is really well done and for anyone who wants to just buy one set, this set allows for hour of fun just by itself. i already have one of these, and hopefully will be getting a second.

0 this was my first set from the new line, so i'm rather partial to it. i'm glad to see it get such high praise. it's quite the lovely little halloween-y set. i wonder if thebrickster could modify this for his ww grave stone mocs? (hint, hint, hintedy, hint, hint. ) edited by pirates forever, 13 june 2009 - 02:02 am.

1 yaaaay! this set is outstanding! it was first set i have bought for pieces! seriously! if you like skellies its mustbuy for you!

0 this set is alright but it doesnt have that pizzaz feeling you know what i mean. i would prefered a knights carrage realy but the design is ok.

1 i'm a little late in the coming (okay, a lot ), but regardless, i'd applaud you for another fantastic and insightful review, erdbeereis. out of all the castle sets, this one remains one of my favorites. i got it for christmas in 2007, before i intended to spend much money on the new castle theme (that changed once i managed to get the king's castle siege for a very good price). it's really a wonderful set all around - the design accomplishes the spooky undead feel very well, and it contains a good piece selection and a phenomenal amount of minifigs. seriously, this set is almost unrivaled in modern lego in the final area - i'm still amazed at how many minifigures tlc put in the kit. i also appreciate that the carriage has a far more realistic horse arangement - after all the sillyness of the one-horse pulled siege engines in kk, it's good to finally see a carriage pulled by multiple horses again. all in all, an excellent set, and well worth $20 imo.

1 great review erdbeereis this is a cool set! pics are great! love that shot of the lightsabers! well done! commanderfox

0 big cam, on nov 20 2009, 10:41 am, said: you say in the review it's great to get 9 minifig's, but there are only 2 minifigs and 3 skeletons?? he's probably counting the four horses as well.

1 thanks for the great review! this is one of my favorite city kits from 2007. i think it's a lot better than the cement mixer from the classic town theme - and it has some cool pieces too.

1 i voted outstanding, because i think this is the best cement mixer tlg ever made, also love the 6-stud wide based vehicles, as you mentioned. i both bought and sold it again this year, and i already regret it, but i had to sell some stuff because of a loss of space

1 7040 dwarves' mine defender theme: castle released: 2008 price: 10 usd pieces: 73 (3 minifigures) introduction: here i am, with one of the newest castle sets realeased in early 2008. it's a small battle wagon with blades on the front, probably to demolish rocks in mines. but in this case, our hero dwarf has to use his machine against the evil trolls who want to destroy his happy kingdom. there is only one small booklet for instructions, no alternate model: parts come in two bags, one for small pieces and one for bigger ones: apart from the lovely figures, the brown parts will be quite useful for any castle builder. extra parts are not even worth mentioning, there are no stickers: figures are detailed enough, dwarf is lovely with his beard but his legs won't move because he is short: figures are the main attraction for adult players. we haven't seen castle army builder sets for a long while and this is closest we've got in recent years. the dwarf is a little taller than it should have been but it's not possible to do so without creating a completely new mould for figures and that would be expensive. its beard is oversized as well but that gives him a legoish look which i like a lot. the trolls - that's what everybody calls them but i say they are orcs - are obviously evil but they are friendly enough not to scare our munchkins. but i wish they had different torsos or at least different faces like crownies. there are not enough weapons to arm everyone but the flag pole is really nice: unlike the star wars army builders, this set has very little weaponry. only one sword and one pike creates scarcity for 3 figures - star wars sets had 4 figures for same price! so i hope our middle age warriors don't come across any stormtroopers :) building in progress: when you pull the chain the catapult fires a round brick: the set has quite good playability, moving blades and firing catapult should be fun for little children. i wouldn't expect more functions for such a small sized model, it hardly covers my hand. the blades move with the front wheel on the right: there is only one little downside, there is too much friction for the wheel and blades won't move synchronized. you may come over this problem by adjusting the blade height and lining them with the wheels. mow the little buggers! you can adjust the blade height: there isn't enough room for the dwarf: folder when public: http://www.brickshel...ry.cgi?f=338578 rating: -figures: 8/10 dwarf is amazing, trolls are great too but i wish they had different faces. -parts: 7/10 brown slopes are new, rest is ok too. -price: 7/10 acceptable but we have seen sets with more figures for less. -design: 6/10 it looks kind of steampunkish but could be better with a little detail. -building: 6/10 not repeating itself, still nothing exciting. -total: 34/50 castle fans will definetely order this one but average lego player may not be interested. conclusion: overall, it's a nice set and i'd recommend it if you like the castle theme. you'll find some good use for the figures and this is the cheapest figure set of the year - at 3.33 usd each. it could have more armory and weaponry but otherwise it's quite alright. skip lunch today and order this little set! links: brickset reviews bricklink entry peeron inventory

1 tacitus, on sep 4 2008, 09:57 am, said: lovely review, really. but the sad fact is we've seen it before, twice. http://www.eurobrick...showtopic=20293 jeez your comments are getting on my nerves. more than one review per set is allowed here. thanks for sharing your thoughts on this set with us. a great set now has (another ) great review. i'll add it to the index. as soon as the poll on "how the index is to look", is over (phew...long sentence) oh yeah and i'll rate this as above average. i think it needs at least one minifig more than there is.

1 i've skipped a few lunches on behalf of this set. it's a great army builder, but so are many of the new castle sets. what makes this great in my opinion is the figs - 2 orcs and 1 dwarf - what else could one want? thanks tlg for making this set and thank you for reviewing it for us review added to the index

1 i got this set last month and i can definitely say that even if you think it is one of the best sets ever, you won't fully appreciate it until you build it yourself. the elevated city station is much more complex than it looks, and the whole set is extremely detailed. the good: - as stated in the review, there's a lot of track, roughly twice as much as the last monorail made, 6991. 5 long straights too! - the designers didn't need to put in the hamburger stand or the ticket readers, but they did and made it even better - great figure selection; airport workers as well as civilians the bad (if you can call it that in such a great set): - hard to incorporate into an existing town if using the default track layout. the center loop would be inaccessible to vehicles and the layout is very large. - the monorail needs nearly a full straight section on either side of the city station or it will impact the corner of the station and stall if a curve is too close. - as far as i know the only town set with road plates that doesn't have a wheeled vehicle. a car would have been nice, a bus would have been incredible. but these small things in no way diminish from the fact that this is one of the best sets ever. edited by section8, 05 september 2008 - 01:17 pm.

1 this is an outstanding review which deserved to be featured here! after seeing this set, it prompts me to own this set, and match with my 10159 legend city airport. it's very nice to see such outstanding set being reviewed and presented to our very screens. everything about this set is simply outstanding. i can't imagine that such incredible set actually released before. why don't they ever continue with this anymore? sigh, it's nice to see so much detailed from its shuttle, snack bar, stairs, waiting platform, validating machine and etc. this is an instant "5" set! if given a chance to own a misb set, i will defintely seriously consider about it.

1 best. set. ever. i got my copy years ago from a guy on the old rec.toys.lego newsgroup (anybody here still remember that newsgroup??). i traded him a guarded inn, a black falcon's fortress, and a couple other small castle sets for it. no regrets on that trade. it is hard to incorporate a monorail into a town, especially if you have a bunch of trains too! i ended up making my entire monorail system elevated. there's just no easy way to make a monorail / road crossing. i also gave up on having it run in a loop. instead, it runs back and forth between two endpoints.

1 thanks for that splendid review, simonwillems! i clicked on "outstanding," of course! i also like those little details, especially the ticket validating machines. you're very fortunate to own this wonderful set! i hope you have an airport to go with it. edit: and bricklink is wrong giving 1991 as the release date. you're right; it was 1990. edited by legotrainfan, 05 september 2008 - 06:57 pm.

1 who was the one who rated it "above average"?

1 sets like this just don't come around too often do they... i didn't realize exactly how much detail really was in this set. tlc should bring back the monorail! great review of an amazing classic town set!

1 this remains the definitive city set in my eyes. i never managed to get one but from the instructions it seems to be perfect in just about every way. i got the two space monorails a while ago but the much higher prices on this one have kept it out my reach. this set is a lot bigger than either of those though. i always liked the monorail system a bit better than the trains because you could easily incorporate height into the tracks and spread them out in all three dimensions. quote edit: and bricklink is wrong giving 1991 as the release date. you're right; it was 1990. it was apparently released in 1990 in europe and 1991 in north america, going by some us and german catalogs i have from that time period. edited by cp5670, 06 september 2008 - 06:06 am.

1 very nice review indeed. b.t.w. a lot of children just love this set. one year we had it with us to legoworld and children asked a lot of questions about it.

1 *gasp* blasphemy! someone voted this set "below average". *brings out hunting rifle* ahem, back on topic; i remember wanting this set badly, for years. and i still want it, just no as much, because it's expensive and, as this review proves, takes up a lot of room. i've already got my trains to think about, and i won't be getting this set anytime soon. i also have a faint memory of this set being featured in one of lego's advertisements, more specifically someone narrowly missing it, hitches a ride, races the monorail to the airport and catches the plane. i am yet to find it on the net, as old lego adverts are hard to come by, especially the european ones. now, to more important matters... *starts hunting* edited by freddie, 07 september 2008 - 10:03 pm.

1 what an amazing set and a truly wonderful review! thanks simonwillems for the work you spend on this.

1 good review, who voted this below average??? i own one and managed to pick it up off ebay a few years ago now with the track expansion pack for 150, in very good condition so glad i did, an all time classic

-1 judging from videos i've seen it seems that the monorail does very well on slopes. i wonder why there haven't been more or at least an updated set? i also wonder why the trains can't incorporate some slopes like the monorail.

0 it would be cool to see a review comparing this set with the newer orange garbage truck.

1 definitely the best garbage truck ever, the color scheme is great and the design is awesome. outstanding, without a doubt. i must have it sometime

1 yeah its very nice along with all the older sets. i've got the cement mixer that was released around about the same time as this.

1 thanks for the review. like many such town sets, i would characterise it as cute. contrasting it to the new bin lorry, it's nice that this set has two minfigs (more realistic) and two bins. those bins are a great addition to lego, although wheelie bins would be nice now (need some kind of 2x2 container you can clip a plate onto as a hinging lid, and clip mini-wheels under the back two studs). having two minifigs is a superior point for this earlier lego rendition of a bin lorry. in fact, even though our bins are now emptied by a private company rather than the local council (as was the case up till the mid 90s), and of course for the last two decades there have been wheelie-bins, bin lorries have three guys - the driver and two collectors. however, our bin collectors for sure don't use a broom or shovel! indeed on occasion they've befouled the street themselves if something goes wrong with hoisting the bin on the mechanism! the shape of the lorry in the set is still quite accurate, pretty good for a four-wide vehicle (i must admit to preferring the newer vehicles).

1 thanks so much for the great review, i love that truck! i hadn't realized there was a real 4-wide recycle truck out there. i must get it one day to replace this abomination currently doing garbage duty in my town: i think that truck has seven pieces total in it. i do like the blue color though ...

1 greetings! just looking through the review index when i came across this one. i recently acquired this set through ebay which came with a practically perfect box and instructions. i would almost say that no one played with it much as all of the parts were brand new. anyway, i just wanted to say that this is a great set that was worth the $14.99!

1 great to find this review of a classic set and it's far better than any yuk set from 1997 omg what were they thinking ! i prefer the six wide for trucks, but for the 80's it was perfect and even today still holds it's own !

1 great review, and i love the soft yellow effect to the pics imo, the most recent garbage truck should've used the same piece for lifting the cans into the big bin instead of the droid arms

1 i did not see this! nice review and beautiful truck. i like it!

0 6206: tie interceptor number of pieces: 212 number of minifigs: 1 price: 19.99 usd/ 17.99 eur/ theme: star wars: episode vi year released: 2006 brickset folder bricklink catalog welcome to my ninth review the boards, today's review is the long awaited tie interceptor. but does it live up to expectations? well, let's find out. i believe this is the first and only time tlg made this set. so, let's begin the review. the box the box is standard for it's time, with silver font. the background on the front has some planets and the death star ii, clarifying that this set is from episode vi. overview this set comes with the interceptor model and one fig. the interceptor has a very sleek, futuristic design, with four wings and a ball-shaped cockpit. the tie interceptor is a stealthy, speedy vehicle in the imperial fleet. it is used for scouting missions, and not meant for attacking due to it's weak structure and low arsenal. front this version of the tie group is very attractive and cool-looking. it has an aerodynamic shape, giving it looks and speed. while not accurate to the movie's grey and black colored ties, the blue in place of the grey is just fine, and does not alter the "coolness" of the design. thankfully, there are no stickers in this set. cockpit here you can see the ball-shaped cockpit. be very, very careful when opening it; it's very flimsy and breaks off almost every time. fortunately, both the windshield and the dish on top are printed, and not stickers. please don't mind the dust. cockpit interior this is the inside of the cockpit. it is very roomy, airtight, and one of the few cockpits in sw sets that are this good. it makes up for lack of detail by giving the pilot plenty of room, so you should have no trouble there. it is also very smooth in the back and where the windshield folds down. this is by far the best sw cockpit i have ever seen done by tlg, good job! the only bad thing is the two tan bricks that clash with the rest of the color. wing attachment this is how the wings are attached to the cockpit on each side. unfortunately, the design on this part is not so good, and sometimes the wings break off. plus, this part is very blocky, and there is a big juniorized piece on the base of the wings. wings here is what each wing looks like. there are three parts on each wing: a middle and two fins. the wings are very aerodynamic, with a diamond-like design. note the imperial insignias and the blue tiles lining the wings. wing attachments cont'd here, again, you see how the middle wing part is attached to the base (juniorized piece), and the fins attached to the base by hinges. the hinges allow the fins to fold in and out a bit, but again, this is very fragile, and the fins often break off. gun placements this is an example of four guns on the ship, one on the tip of each fin. the guns consist of a tile with a tenic tunnel hole on the bottom attached to a technic pin, which is attached to a black bar. a good design altogether. back here you see the rear of the cockpit. you can see why the opening mechanism is so flimsy: the whole top and front is connected to the body only by a weak hinge system, as seen in the picture. also note the small, trans-blue dish and the four trans-red studs. minifigure finally, here is the single figure that comes in this set, a tie pilot. it is an all black figure, with a life support system decal on the front and a helmet with silver imperial insignias. an overall good minifig, with a different helmet mold than the stormtrooper or shadowtrooper. well, i suppose that's about all, let's get to the final verdict: build: 6/10, a little difficult due the flimsiness of the ship, but should only take the average builder no more than 30 minutes. playability: 7/10, it's fun to fly around ( ), but has no real functions. swooshability: 7/10, you can swoosh it around fairly well, just be careful not to accidentally break it. minifigs: 8/10, a good fig, although having only one leaves something more to be desired. design: 4/10, very, very flimsy with the wings, windshield, and fins, but good for display. price: 7/10: i think it was actually 30 usd when i got it, but i'm not sure... overall score: 6.5, an average set. very delicate, so much that you can hardly pick it up, but good for display. the minifig is okay, and having no stickers is good. i would recommend this to a hardcore ot fan. that wraps it all up, please vote your opinion on this set in the poll, and i'll see you next review! edited by jimbutcher, 15 september 2008 - 03:10 am.

1 nice set, but nicer review! looks like the set has quite some nice parts.

1 thanks for sharing your thoughts and opinion about this set with us. i've added it to the index. this is one of my favourite ties and i think tlg did a good job at designing it.

0 i owned it and loved it when i was young ^^ i really miss it.

0 a very robust set. the fact that it seats two figs plus has l&s makes it a unique set. i definitely liked the big airport subtheme tlg created in the early 1990s.

0 perfect perhaps the front sprouses are for foaming the runway? you've certainly kept that set in near mint condition, haven't you? now all we can wish for is a new firetruck combining this l&s version and the new

1 i remember my cousins having this set. both are in their permanent dark ages now but are not willing to give their lego to me if you have one of those old airports, then this set is what you need to have even more fun since it makes a great addition to the airport. excellent review! 10/10.

0 jopiek, on sep 8 2008, 12:24 am, said: thanks of course for the flattery but, do you then from your profession understand what the purpose is of the front 'spouts' that even can be hide, since that puzzles me. it can be that the lego designers thought it was a nice touch and didn't bothered about the realistic value of such a feature but i don't suppose that that is the case here. somehow, i had just noticed your reply. to be honest with you, the aes in my country does not have front spouts in their fire engine. i do not remember seeing this feature before. it is a possibility that this feature is included in some models or an imaginative addition from our lego designers. i will need to check this out. kimt, on sep 9 2008, 03:16 pm, said: perhaps the front sprouses are for foaming the runway? that is a logical answer.

1 nice review cobra. thanks for sharing. i esp. like the doctor's torso. i rate this little set a 4 based on the design of the vehicle and the classic doors. blogged! edit: i must have missed this review after it was posted back in sep. i went ahead and kept the blog, since it's always enjoyable to look at these reviews.

0 name: cargomaster crane set no.: 6352 @ peeron.com theme: lego system / town year: 1991 pieces: 133 minifigs: 1 price: usd $26.00 / gbp unknown / eur 19,95 aargh stupid tree! for more than fourty years this 'megabrick' has tormented our town! we need some help! long before my dark ages lego released this relatively small set. since they didn't have a construction site like nowadays, they released these small road-works. i was only six years old and really into small sets since my adhd didn't allow me to sit and build for long periods of time. so these smaller sets were ideal for me. the instruction booklet. the complete set. the set itself is not really a surprise to set up and play with. first you'll build the smaller parts of the set like the container and the small verhicle. no real surprises there, except for the smaller car that fits perfectly in the cargo container. just pull off the seat and steering wheel, and the car just fits. the crane itself is just as easy to build as the smaller parts. just place bricks on top of eachother. although you'll still have the wire to connect and pull through a diversity of bricks and plates. the carco container and small car. being out of my dark ages really tunnelled my vision toward bigger sets and completing my town. this set really comes in handy if i need construction or traffic workers in my town, i can just moc a few containers for tearing down trees, fixing traffic lights, and so on. behold the mighty cargomaster crane! it's pretty easy to say that a set as simplistic as this one is not much fun to play with. however if you see the bigger potential in your town this one could be of great value to any city. playability: 7/10 (with only one container it gets a bit boring) design: 9/10 (it's small, and fits perfectly) price: 7/10 (average, but not really cheap.) overall: 7.7/10 (a nice overall set if you're building on minifig scale) gimme my pizza! every town should have a pizzaria! more information: bricklink search results brickset lugnet edited by crazydance, 07 september 2008 - 03:52 pm.

1 mhh maybe put the pizza horizontally ^^ and gimme some! it was a nice set, it's a nice little crane !

1 information name: fire control center set no.: 4953 @ peeron.com theme: lego, legoland year: 1991 pieces: 516 minifigs: 4 price: usd $85.00 / gbp unknown / eur unknown bricklink search results brickset lugnet introduction this week i got the flu. so since i have to stay home and get better, i might as well make a review. it's one of the most amazing older city sets, thus making it a really valuable review. this is the story about four handsome firemen living in one of the most amazing city structures out there. the 6389 fire control center. the box i actually didn't remember the box to be that small. (borrowed from peeron) the four hunky firemen oh jeah what women doesn't like a man in a uniform the manual even the manual is aging... but then again it's 17 years old! review as you all know a city must have some standard civil services, like a hospital and a police station. a fire house also is a must for any lego city. this particular fire house is one of the most amazing sets ever to be released. in this cool set you get 4 minifigs, all fire fighters, two verhicles, and a helicopter firefighters have to move around the futuristic fire truck is definately my favourite! chief's car the smallest verhicle of the set, it's a small all-terrain jeep for the fire chief. pretty much a standard car in those days. a real simple layout, and a trunk which holds a small fire hose. it's lucky to be in this set, because it complements the whole thing the car luckily it's red and it has de cool signs on the side. helicopter another great addition to the whole set is the helicopter. again in a basic setup for that kind of verhicle at the time. this one has the nice addition of two hoses to put out the fires raging in lego city. the chopper no, it doesn't really fly really cool fire truck thingy this fire truck is definately the best of the verhicles in this set. it's actually a futuristic model of fire trucks. i haven't seen any other fire truck like this. i saw a police truck like it though. but we're talking fire fighters right? actually the whole thing han open up to reveal a number of fire fighting appliances such as a hose, a computer, and a oxygen tank. the fire truck click for bigger version! the main building actually looks kinda empty when the trucks and chopper are gone. however, this still is realistic compared to a real fire house. also the front has those amazing sliding doors, which make this thing really look cool and clean. off to fight a fire main structure, with the slinding doors pulled down actually those sliding doors are also the hard part of the model. since all the bricks must be perfectly aligned, or else the doors will stutter. but if you're a little familiar with lego then you don't need to worry. from the back enough room to play with i'm going to give my perspectives on each of the sides on the left we have the garage for the bigger fire truck. the only real flaw about this set is that this garage isn't long enough for the fire truck. this could have been solved by making it two or three studs longer. notice the cool sunroof! in the middle we have the chief's office. complete with coffee machine, a diversity of computers, and a tape recorder, most likely to tape any incoming calls. a lot of details are crammed up in there. just like in the rest of the set. to the right is the helicopter platform. i really like the grey-blue-yellow of the platform because it doesn't look so red anymore. don't get me wrong, red is a cool color, but not too much red! and the helicopter actually fits, and stays in place during playtime. the baseplate filled up this picture says it all. again the four lego hunks are greeting all the ladies the minifigs are from a classic series, this happens with more of my lego sets. bottom line is that this set is one of the best fire houses lego created. verdict the build is pretty easy but takes a while to really see where you are with your building. it's nice to have a hospital from the same era, this create a more uniform look to your city. once you completed the model your baseplate is pretty filled up but still has a lot of opportunities. playability: 10/10 (cool trucks, a chopper, and sliding doors, nuff said!) design: 9/10 (insanely good design) price: 10/10 (couldn't get better than this) overall: 9.6/10 with a score like that one can only say... get one... now! time to go home the trucks and chopper back on their rightful spots

0 i have this one. the newer 6571 station is better in some ways, but i always liked the big airport-style fire engine in this and the windows covering the garages. one mod project i have in mind is to expand the base, adding a second room in the area beneath the control center. interestingly, this set had two different box pictures. there was the original 1989 yellow legoland box and a 1991 blue system box, and the blue box has the vehicles in different places. quote price: usd $85.00 / gbp unknown / eur unknown if this is referring to the original price, it wasn't that much. $50 is more like it.

0 this set looks real nice, but a wall in the middle with a stair and a few desks/containers.

0 i think the 6382 fire station is the better one from the 80ies.

1 big supie, on sep 7 2008, 09:46 pm, said: i think the 6382 fire station is the better one from the 80ies. i agree, have that 6382 set for about 27 years now, but i have always like that one 'futuristic' truck when i was a child so i also still have some feelings for this set as well. @crazydance: nice review after all!!!

1 from memory argos sold it originally for about 21 gbp. i seem to remember this as i could not afford the airport released the same year as this was about 29.99! seems such a small amount of money now, now have 2 copies of this set, only 1 boxed :-)

1 found this set on a flea market in munich, yesterday. just 25 years after its release. the instructions for a total of five models, two of them printed, the other 3 are just photo instructions in the book. it still has the box in good shape, despite some wear from the age. sadly five little pieces were missing, and 5 wrong pieces inside instead (2 complete wheels and a classic 80s-90s plane wing (dumped into my bricks). but i was able to replace the missing minifig torch and the 4 missing plates with identical pieces from my collection. the box and contents the set still has the original box. inside the pieces, plastic insert, instructions and a 1987 technic catalogue, imagine that set livespan today. four years and the 8841 is still in the catalogue. classic technic design from early 80s showing a function drawing of the steering and the main model a small set, but with a flap shoeing the contents. all pieces in the inner box and the papers included. 5th model: soapbox racer this is more or less a soapbox racer with working steering, but no engine. it's got a rather blocky design, but still looks sleek enough and is a simple build little over 100 pcs out of 180. the soapbox at step 2 just included the steering at step 6 completed and ready to race downhill. total: 7/10 simple, but effective 4th model: simple chassis very simple and boring alternate using just 1/3 of the 180 pieces in the set. it even hasn't got a seat construction. it's just a plain steering mechanism attached on wheels with a spartan chassis of just a few pieces. this is the whole model at step 5 just attach the steering mechanism and wheels and you're done total: the worst alternate model of the complete set. just a boring 4/10 3rd model: balance very original small model. it's a small model of a working classic balance. and it works with small parts laid on the scales, altough they've got just a 4x4 footprint. it's a fast build. just 15 minutes and you've done it. the model as it looks at step 3 finished. easy build with just 63pcs out of 180 total: very original model, it actually works with small weights, but a very simple build. still a 7/10 alternate model: tractor with equipment this is the second model. it's a simple but boxy design featuring a harrow and a plough. the tractor has a similar design to the very first tractor set, but much smaller. the plough is about 24-wide and the harrow is completely snotted even back in 1983. has two functions: working steering and the coupler for the equipment. uses almost all pieces of the set. the tractor at step 8, the steering isn't completely attached now this is the completed tractor the complete harrow finished alternate with the plough attached. total: nice, but quite ugly and boxy design for a tractor with 4 wheels of the same size. takes me to a 6/10 main model: desert racer this is the main model, with a nice (for early 80s) but boxy design. it has two functions. steering and a working 1-cylinder rear engine, which is of the old 2x2 piston type, since the small piston design wasn't invented back then. this is the only model of the set, which has piece callouts in the instructions. the printed alternate model has no callouts, they weren't invented on both models back in 1983. the three smaller photo instruction alternates have a piece callout at the beginning showing all needed pieces. the seat is a nice, but blocky design and use a primitive snot technique. this is the model at step five. the piston is already attached. imagine this state on step 5 in modern sets. back then lego had challenging instructions, not the step madness like today this is the engine just made of plates with a hole in the middle for the piston step 9. the piston engine is completed. on step 12 the roll bar and the seat are installed. only the steering isn't completed yet. front view of the finished model. just 15 steps needed back then. bird's eye view of the whole set displayed on the box model verdict: nice design, especially the colorful seat in snot technique, but quite boxy especially the engine, since there were only the huge pistons. still a 9/10 set verdict: design and models: 7/10, very boxy designs, due to the age. the chassis alternate sucks build: 9/10 classic 80s technic building. quite challenging but fun sturdyness: 7/10: rear section damaged after the table fall, but rather easily fixed fun: 9/10 blast from the past. overall: 8/10 mfg widdi edited by widdi, 07 september 2008 - 04:11 pm.

1 great review! i really love the seat and the great possibilities with the alternate models. also congratulations for getting that set in perfect condition!

0 name: electric passenger train set no.: 7725 theme: lego / system / trains / 12v / train set year: 1981 pieces: 485 minifigs: 1 price: usd 70.00$ (which equals about eur 50 and gbp 40) introduction: our most favorite theme is 12v trains. actually i got my first 77-series back in 1981 (5th of december, i was 2,5 years old) just a week before my brother was born. some years later i got the 7740. after our dark ages we (my brother, cousin and myself) got all 12v trains at least once. this 7725 was gathering dust in my brothers' room. the train in all its splendor. as you can see it doesn't occur at the back of the 12v era train instructions although its larger brother the 7740 does. some investigation learned that all the sets at the back of the instructions date from 1980 so the 7725 wasn't released yet. here you can see the front of the 7725 with the driver in the cockpit. the driver is in fact the only minifig that was included in the set. as you can see, our version of the train has a different front than the one in the instructions. apparently the former owner used 7861 (lighting set (12 v)) to upgrade the train with working back- and frontlights. i like the original lights but didn't notice that the train had those double lights until i did the review. maybe we will give the train again it's original signs and put custom leds in it or so so that the train can drive into two directions with accurately working lights. another thing about the lights that puzzle me are the backlights. while typing this i realise that the former owner might have added those, so let's have a look at the instructions then. as it turns out, the lights are there also in the instructions. i recently learned that only the last car or coach of a train has it's red lights on. so unless the train drives with only the front car it will never use those red backlights. here you can see the cockpit with the engineer. the cables don't look very pretty but well, the train at least has working light. here you can take a look at the inside of the engine car. while the 7745 has a nice 'fake engine' there, just the weight bricks and the ugly cables, apart from the engineer and his cockpit, no other nice features here. b.t.w. lego always used tiles in such a trains to make it easier for kids to take off the roof and have access to the minifig passengers etc. here the 'proof' that it is an electric train. the pantograph of the front car. it has the same kind of panthographs that the 7745 has. the middle car has 4 chairs. as you can see, some vandal must have nocked over this one. hope they leave the cables alone. this early morning train seems to have one passenger: a workman. i like the small 2x3 windows from this car very much! they give this care a nice look. also the door in the middle adds something special to the train. as far as i know, no other passenger train has the doors in the middle. here you see the side of the train, just after the train has left brickingham station where the worker, probably from set 6647 (highway repair) that was also released in 1980. a closeup of the last car with steering stand to allow the train to travel back and forth without having to 'make head', in other words: putting the engine in front again. the train, shunted to an end track so it can be cleaned (i think it is apparent that it definitely needs cleaning very badly). this set can be found on: peeron lugnet brickset bricklink entries playability: 5/10 (the train is fine, but with only one minifig not very playable without other sets; also no accessories at all!) design: 7/10 (nice train, the inside could have been a lot better, but i really like to original front lights!) price: 7/10 (the train came with motor so not a bad price, goes now for quite some money at ebay.) overall: 6.5/10 (nice set but the 7745 is a better train i'm sure) well that was it for today. i hope you have enjoyed this review and got tears in your eyes seeing how nice the 12v era was... it never comes back, but maybe lego rereleases some of this sets in the 2009+ train era (very likely that this is just wishful thinking). edited by jopiek, 12 september 2008 - 04:56 pm.

1 a very nice review, jopiek! you know, i was wondering how lego could justify having two 12v-powered passenger trains at the same time, but after reading the review, and seeing the lack of figures and accessories, i guess i understand why (plus the train is rather compact). oh, and i can't help but think that the chairs in the middle carriage are somewhat oddly placed, because those placed next to the door are unusable because the door takes up room needed for figs' arms. also, it appears that your set also has the newer couplers, i.e. there's no hooks for the decoupling rail to grab hold of. with the light assembly it really won't matter, play-wise, or if you don't have any decouplers, but it's still a bit of a bummer.

1 a nice old classic, the driver has a nice hat and torso, and the train is well designed, except for that thing on the roof.

0 jopiek, on sep 8 2008, 12:20 am, said: the chair was just loose so it should be placed on the 2x2 plate that is also visible in the picture of the middle car. b.t.w. the front magnet is the old type. i have some decouplers but we don't use them because they are not really that reliable. lego just release a whole line of trains at the same time. i just discussed with my parents and they told be lego had those sets longer in store back then. i must have gotten the 7745 somewhere in 1983 or even 1984 although it was released in 1981. i started of with the 7710 (push along train) and then upgraded the tracks with current rails when i got the 7745. the 7745 was realsed in 1985 ;) lego had 2 12v passengers trains between 1981 and 1984 (the 7740 & 7725) during the 80s the avergae life of a train was about 5 years.

0 jopiek, on sep 7 2008, 11:20 pm, said: the chair was just loose so it should be placed on the 2x2 plate that is also visible in the picture of the middle car. that's not the one i was thinking of, it was the other two chairs towards the middle of the wagon that i was thinking of. if you try to seat a minifig in either of them, you'll quickly find that it's impossible, beacuse the door interferes with the figs' required personal space. if you move both of them one stud forward (so that the back of the seat lines up with the edge of the window), it'll solve the problem, and still leave space for a figs to be seated in the other chairs.

1 a great review for a great set. thanks for sharing it with us. a like the older lego trains. btw i think you need to fix this: quote name: jetport fire squad (light and sound series)

1 a set from the "golden age of lego". it brings back a lot childhood memories seeing this review. i was 5 and just starting to play with lego around that time. i could look for hours the lego catalogs dreaming of sets like this one. thanks for this wonderful review!

1 the best 12v legotrain is for me the 7740. the 7725 is still a goodlooking train and the only one with short wagons in a electric version. before i started to with bricklink, i started to build this train in blue. i've build 4 trains of it and sold 2 of them. still one for sale . you can also build this in other colors, like a yellow one: or you can build a black version, which i made a death train of it. driven by a skeleton . edited by panda9001100, 17 may 2009 - 08:01 am.

0 beach cruisers set #: 6445 theme: island xtreme stunts year released: 2002 piece count: 97 minifigs: 2 list price: $7 (usd) during a trip to legoland california in 2002, their big store had a neat little display of some new sets and themes including island xtreme stunts. the new theme offered great colors including orange, tan, and light blue; which immediately caught my eye. the theme focussed on island fun with some adventure, and included some great figs like the brickster. i had to buy at least one set choosing truck & stunts trike (review coming soon) at the time. the theme was short lived and many of the sets were on sale at discount toy stores not too long after their initial release. i picked up this set, 6445 beach cruisers for $3.33 (usd), which will be my first of three island xtreme stunt reviews. starting with the box, a race between the street surfer and skate boarder: the back shows some alternate models including a sail boat and jet ski: same image on the instructions as the box: but the backside shows the island xtreme stunts video game for different platforms: the set includes a small decal sheet for the skateboard: i love the two figs included within this set. one is a "hippie-type" with shades and leafed muscle short, and the other "pizza boy" skateboarder. check out the "pizza boy" on his skateboard: two green brackets are included for attaching each fig to the long grey bar. using this piece, one can make the skateboarder do tricks and flips. the "street surfer" vehicle is pretty nice to: the sail is placed on a black bar and lance, then attached to the vehicle: here's a picture of the vehicle. to me, it has that old "soap box derby" look to it - like something kids would create to race down a hill: the vehicle doesn't have a steering wheel, but rather two levers which i think work well in the cockpit: here's the underside: the set has three neon orange wheels that attach to technic axle pins to attach to the vehicle: lastly, the entire set with a few extra pieces: final thoughts while island xtreme stunts is not the best city/town sub-theme, esp. for the traditional lego classic town fan, it does have some fun sets like this little beach cruiser. good figs, a skateboard, and a very "rollable" (fun word equivalent to "swooshable" but for vehicles with wheels), vehicle. you can even blow on the sail to get it to roll across the floor. this set is a lot of fun!

1 great review! i would buy the sets, but sadly tlc doesn't sell them anymore. i have one question only: how can you be reviewing at this time at night!?! i would never dream of doing that! well i can't wait to see the other reviews!

1 like whitefang i too only remember this line in computer game form. i used to love that game! i actually have never seen a review for an xtreme stunts set, so this was nice to see. as for the set, i think it looks pretty good. i really like the hippie guy. the windboard thing is nice as well, but looks a bit strange somehow. i give this set a solid 3 out of 5. thanks for the nice review! edited by erdbeereis1, 08 september 2008 - 04:05 am.

0 wout, on oct 16 2008, 01:00 pm, said: the hippie guy is called " snap lockit" and the pizza guy is called " pepper roni". i think the legodesigners had a cosy evening with much beer when they thought about the names. thanks for that bit of info. i'm not familiar with the computer game or the characters, although i may have heard the name pepper roni. do you know the island girl's name (not included in this set though)?

-1 her name was sky lane. it's quite sad, though, to actually play the game--the "xtreme tower" is the only set that made it into the game itself, and it was a really watered down version of the information center from the first two games. but the island was, in the game, filled with incredible buildings that would have made really cool sets.

-1 nice review. is that one minifig breaking out of prison? (just wondering about his clothing.) the worst thing is the name. anything with xtreme in the title almost deserves the lowest score possible on principle.

0 hippie dude? thats snap lockitt, island xtreme is one of the best themes ever, im trying to get the sets off bricklink, thanks fo the review i need this now.

0 thanks for the review! i loved this theme, it had some of the greatest pieces ever arranged in any theme, brilliant printed parts and figures, and some good colours. snap lockitt (hippie dude ) is a great figure with a cool name, i own him from another set, but unfortunately not this one. it looks like a very good set, no stickers and good printed parts too. nice review. pencoin, on sep 9 2008, 05:21 pm, said: hippie dude? thats snap lockitt, island xtreme is one of the best themes ever, im trying to get the sets off bricklink, thanks fo the review i need this now. hahaha. that made me laugh for some reason... i don't know why though, i agree with it.

1 this is a really nice small set i think. it fascinates me that those are actual printed parts. that's something we don't see too often anymore. the figures are very good, although i must say i like the name hippie dude better than snap lockitt. does anyone know why the brickster has one blue hand? thanks for the great review! edited by erdbeereis1, 09 september 2008 - 06:45 pm.

0 i knew this set looked familiar... thank you, brickster for bringing one of my first lego sets ever back to my memory. unfortunately, i don't have many of the pieces left... but thank you!

0 thanks erdbeereis1 for your kind words. glad you liked this set. just wondering whom has rated poor and below average. i will like to know why you voted this way. perhaps, you could share with me and the rest on your thoughts and views.

1 nice review white fang. this really reminds me of an "all-american" set with its red, white, and blue colors (and the white stars). although i really like the fig with its scruffy bearded face, i find the green torso a bit odd for this set. i suppose i would expect some sort of red/blue racer fig with a white/blue racing helmet. swamp sharks - too funny! . you always add a nice addition of humor to your reviews. now i'm going to check out some wonder woman clips on youtube.

1 i love the classic sets of that era and a great review helps show off the simplicity of some older sets.

1 what would we do without the trucks of legoland to clean up our town? well, i didn't want to find out, so i bought this set straight away! 7991 recycle truck set info set name: 7991 recycle truck released: 2007 theme: city price: usd 14.99-gbp 12.99-eur 14.95 pieces: 206 minifigs: 1 review time! leading off, the box the front shows the recycle man loading up... the trash can? one thing here is really bizarre. on lego s@h and everywhere else, it says that this set is called recycle truck. which makes sense as it has a recycle logo on the truck. however, on my box, it says the set is called garbage truck has this happened to anyone else? or is it just me... here is the back of the box which shows some of the things you can do with this set. the bags with this set you get 3 bags which are numbered. and do you see what i see? yes, that's right, the dss is in a bag so it doesn't get bent! why tlg doesn't do this more often is beyond me... bag #1 the set comes with a very nice selection of pieces. a large number of these are orange. manual silly me, i forgot to take a picture of the front of the manual. the picture is the same as on the front of the box. the back shows some of the 2007 city sets in a nice little scene. and inside. minifig here is the friendly garbage/recycle man. he looks nice but with the same head as so many other city figs before him. come on tlg! give us some new heads! the sticker sheet the stickers actually are pretty decent as far as stickers go. i like the recycle sign. after bag #1 this is where we stand after the first bag is built. bag # 2 the parts contained in the second bag. more nice orange pieces here. extra parts some nice 1x1 slopes and 1x1 round plates. everything built now that everything is built, let's check it out! the design of the set is very nice and the color scheme looks great. when you see it, you immediately know what it is. the back has a droid arm that acts as a handle to dump the trash/recycling in the truck. it's simple, but works well. here you can see the dumping mechanism. it works by a sliding technic beam with a stopper on top of the truck you can store the worker's cart. this works really well. i think though that the top of the truck overall looks a bit jumbled up with a few too many different colors. the bottom. trash dumping time! this is a good feature of the set. a very well built snot front section. this looks fantastic with the grills and number plate sticker. someone has left a big mess on the street... brickshelf folder ratings! price: 10/10 (for $15 this is a very good deal at 206 pieces) parts: 9/10 (lots of orange) design 9/10 (a very well designed set. especially the front) playability 9/10 (the trash dumper is fun and the added broom and cart make for good play value) build: 8/10 (simple, but stayed interesting) overall:45/50 brickset lego s@h bricklink peeron taking out the trash... summary this is a great small set for the price with fun features, nice colors and good design. i would certainly recommend this set, no matter what it's really called thanks, and happy building!

1 this is one of those sets that make me really want to start building up a city. it's a great value, has a lot of useful pieces, and is just plain fun to play with. i do miss vehicles having doors though. great review. i was a bit curious as to how the dumping mechanism worked. as well as the sticker count.

1 yeah, the name on this set is strange. i think all the boxes say garbage truck. i guess it's up to each builder to decide whether 1x1 round plates are recyclable material or not. it's a great model in any case. i love these highly detailed city trucks we've been getting during the last year or two. i used to have a preference for the late 80s/early 90s city line but some of these new sets have really surpassed them in detail and functionality.

1 nice truck indeed, but the yellow one is better i think, at least if you put them on a roadplate it seems to me that those road plates are too small for that. also it will not empty completely because of that panel. well, for the rest it is a nice set and a fine review!

1 i own this set and i think it's a really nice truck, but there is two little details that i didn't like : 1/ a recycle truck really needs 2 minifig, one to drive, one to put the garbage on the back. 2/ the big hole behind the driver seat, it was easy to fill it like this : with hole pouf ! no more little hole! but this is really a great set anyway. 4/5 for me ( above average )

0 nice review. this is a very nice vehicle, one of my favorite of the newer city ones. jopiek: there are two generations of road plate that are wide enough for six-wide vehicles like this. the current plates are dark grey with plain white printing, and look not great in my opinion. the previous ones are imo the best road plates of all time - green with dark grey road, white dotted line/zebras, drain covers and yellow verge markings (just like we really have here in ireland). for urban area i would still choose the green-edged plates and just cover up the green - the markings are so much better than the current plates.

1 trop beau

1 jopiek, on sep 10 2008, 01:45 am, said: also it will not empty completely because of that panel. actually, it does. the back part of the truck with the panel hinges up, so that when you want the truck to dump, it doesn't get in the way.

1 a good set, with a nice color scheme. i still prefer the last one that had a removable bin.

1 what a great set and a very nice review erdbeereis. i think the only improvement to this set would have been the use of chrome exhaust pipes and front grill. i bought this set with a lot of excitement, but unfortunately have not put it together yet. what are your thoughts on these larger 6-stud wide detailed vehicles as opposed to 4-stud wide classics? here's an image of 6668 recycle truck released in 1992: ps. i like the use of "taking out" sponge bob in your review.

1 this looks like a great set, and i'm happy you were dumping spongebob, he deserves that. this set looks very nice, and if i see it i will probably pick it up.

1 thanks for the review! this is one of the few city sets that i own (despite loving the theme so much, most of my town is either custom or classic), and it's about as beautiful as a big garbage truck can ever be. quote nice truck indeed, but the yellow one is better i think, at least if you put them on a roadplate it seems to me that those road plates are too small for that. also it will not empty completely because of that panel. well, for the rest it is a nice set and a fine review! well, the truck barely fits onto the old roadplates (not on curves though), so if you put it in a display it probably won't look bad. i think from what i see, this and all the other 6 wide vehicles will fit much better on the newer roadplates, which are four studs wider than the old ones.

0 hi, i bought this set a while ago, and have since remodeled it into a larger 8 wide truck. now it can hold a driver and passenger. its kind of boxy, i may redesign it in the future.

1 that's a really nice mod badsneaker! the added bulk serves it well.

-1 i like this set, but i can't give it a good grade for playability, as the rearmost hinging section is too stiffly hinged, so when you open it, it's likely to break if you hold it just over the shovel and broom. my truck thus has that function, and with it of course the whole container tipping, disabled. i also moved the cab a bit forward and the front axle rearward to give the cab the typical garbage truck look, as they are often very low slung. this also created space behind the cab for some equipment.

1 nice review i realy need to pick up this set! and the cement truck too!
